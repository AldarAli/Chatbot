Abstract—These days, many people use a social networking
service (SNS). When we use SNSs, we carefully protect the privacy
of personal information: name, age, gender, address, telephone
number, birthday, etc. However, we often reveal birthdays on
SNS, not only ours but also of others. Birthday information can
threaten our privacy and security when combined with other
personal information. In this study, we investigated Japanese and
English tweets where birthdays were revealed to other people,
including unwanted audiences. We collected 1,000 Japanese
tweets and 1,000 English tweets including word “birthday” and
found about 30% of the collected Japanese tweets and 70% of
the English tweets were tweets revealing someone’s birthdays to
other people. Furthermore, about 70% of Japanese tweets and
90% of English tweets revealing someone’s birthdays to other
people were ones where receivers’ birthdays were revealed. We
obtained 88% accuracy when we applied support vector machine
(SVM) machine learning techniques to classify Japanese and
English tweets including word “birthday” into ones revealing
birthdays of senders, receivers, and others. However, the recall
rate of Japanese and English tweets revealing senders’ birthdays
were only 17% and 30%, respectively.

INTRODUCTION
These days, many people use a social networking service
(SNS). These users, especially young users, tend to disclose
personal information on their SNS proﬁles seemingly without
much concern for the potential privacy risks. They seem
to believe the beneﬁts of disclosing personal information in
order to use SNSs is greater than the potential privacy risks.
Furthermore, they often reveal personal information on SNSs,
not only theirs but also of others. For example, (exp 1) is a
comment on a Facebook user proﬁle.
(exp 1) I hope you had an amazing birthdayyy!
This comment was time-stamped. As a result, anyone, includ-
ing unwanted audiences, could understand this user’s birthday
even if the user did not disclose his/her birthday on the proﬁle.
Also, we often ﬁnd tweets where we can understand someone’s
birthday.
(exp 2) Atashi no tanjyobi ha 8 gatu youka yo, Risshu
tte itte 1 nen de mottomo atsui hi rashii wane–.
Koyomi no ue deha dayo?
(My birthday is August 8th, that is, the beginning
day of autumn, and seems to be the hottest day
of the year. Well, it is according to the calendar,
you know?)
Figure 1. Twitter recommends us to add our birthdays to our proﬁles.
(exp 3) @kahuhi kahuhi san tanjyobi omedetou goza-
imasu!!
(@kahuhi Mr. kahuhi, happy birthday!!)
Both (exp 2) and (exp 3) are tweets on Twitter. The sender
of (exp 2) disclosed her birthday by herself. On the other
hand, the sender of (exp 3) revealed his/her friend’s birthday.
In this paper, we focus on birthday information because we
treat it different than other personal information. For example,
if someone revealed our name, address, age, gender, telephone
number, or social security number on a SNS, we would get up-
set with him/her for doing it. On the other hand, interestingly,
if someone revealed our birthday in his/her birthday message
on a SNS, like (exp 3), most of us would appreciate what
he/she does, like (exp 4) and (exp 5).
(exp 4) message kureta minna arigatou. yoi tanjyobi ni
narimashita – (*ˆˆ*)
(Thank you for birthday messages. I have a nice
birthday – (*ˆˆ*))
(exp 5) @taguma6 reina no mama no tanjyobi oboete

(@taguma6 I’m glad to hear that you remember
my mother’s birthday. Thank you. Amazing.)

Birthday messages often give us opportunities to start new
communications. As a result, as shown in Fig. 1, Twitter
recommends us to add our birthday to our proﬁles. It is likely
that these kinds of recommendations let SNS users discount
the potential risks related to disclosing personal information.
However, birthday information can be linkable to a speciﬁc
individual when it is combined with other information. In order
to deal with the privacy risks, it is important to investigate
how we disclose or reveal personal information on SNSs,
not only ours but of others. Birthday information especially
should be investigated carefully because we treat it different
than other personal information. Furthermore, it is important
to investigate whether unwanted audiences can collect revealed
personal information automatically. To solve these problems,
we investigated Japanese tweets where birthdays are revealed
to other users and showed how Japanese Twitter users commu-
nicate with each other about their birthdays [1]. In this paper,
we investigate not only Japanese tweets but also English tweets
where birthdays are revealed to other users. Furthermore,
we discuss whether unwanted audiences can collect revealed
birthday information from tweets by using machine learning
techniques.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section
II, we survey the related works. In Section III, we report
how we disclose or reveal birthday information on Twitter.
In Section IV, we discuss whether unwanted audiences can
collect revealed birthday information from tweets by using
machine learning techniques. Finally, in Section V, we present
our conclusions.
II.
RELATED WORK
Personally identiﬁable information is deﬁned as informa-
tion which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s
identity such as social security number, biometric records,
etc. alone, or when combined with other information that is
linkable to a speciﬁc individual, such as date and place of
birth, mother’s maiden name, etc. [2] [3]. Internet users are
generally concerned about unwanted audiences obtaining per-
sonal information. Fox et al. reported that 86% of Internet users
are concerned that unwanted audiences will obtain information
about them or their families [4]. Also, Acquisti and Gross
reported that students expressed high levels of concern for gen-
eral privacy issues on Facebook, such as a stranger ﬁnding out
where they live and the location and schedule of their classes,
and a stranger learning their sexual orientation, name of their
current partner, and their political afﬁliations [5]. However,
Internet users, especially young users, tend to disclose personal
information on their proﬁles, for example, real full name,
gender, hometown and full date of birth, which can potentially
be used to identify details of their real life, such as their
social security numbers. In order to discuss this phenomenon,
many researchers investigated how much and which type of
information are revealed in SNSs, especially, in Facebook.
Stutzman investigated Facebook proﬁles of University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill freshmen and found that 96.2% of them
published their birthdays on their Facebook proﬁles, 74.7%
their political views and 83.2% their sexual orientation [6].
Gross and Acquisti investigated Facebook proﬁles of Carnegie
Mellon University students and found that 87.8% of them
reveal their birth date on their proﬁles, 39.9% list their phone
number, and 50.8% list their current residence [7]. Taraszow
et al. observed Facebook proﬁles of 131 young people (68
females and 63 males, ages ranged from 14 to 29 years)
and found that all participants disclosed their birthdays and
54.2% list their hometowns on their Facebook proﬁles [8].
Taraszow et al. also observed Cypriot Facebook users and
found that they were willing to share personal information. All
of them published their real names, 97% revealed their gender,
97% published their facial proﬁle pictures, 51% indicated their
hometowns and 88% published their date of birth [9]. Huffaker
and Calvert studied 70 teenage bloggers and found that 70%
of them published their ﬁrst names, 20% list their full names,
67% list their ages, and 39% list their birthdays [10]. Based
on these results, researchers discussed the reasons why users
willingly disclose personal information on their SNS proﬁles.
Dwyer concluded in her research that privacy is often not
expected or undeﬁned in SNSs [11]. Barnes argues that Internet
users, especially teenagers, are not aware of the nature of the
Internet and SNSs [12]. Hirai reported that many users had
troubles in SNSs because they did not mind that strangers
observed their communication with their friends [13]. Viseu
et al. reported that many online users believe the beneﬁts of
disclosing personal information in order to use an Internet
site is greater than the potential privacy risks [14]. On the
other hand, Acquisti and Gross explain this phenomenon as
a disconnection between the users’ desire to protect their
privacy and their actual behavior [5]. Also, Livingstone points
out that teenagers’ conception of privacy does not match the
privacy settings of most SNSs [15]. Joinson et al. reported that
trust and perceived privacy had a strong affect on individuals’
willingness to disclose personal information to a website [16].
Also, Tufekci found that concern about unwanted audiences
had an impact on whether or not students revealed their real
names and religious afﬁliation on MySpace and Facebook [17].
Next, we survey studies that focus on the issue of potential
privacy risks of disclosing personal information. Birthday
information alone cannot threaten the privacy and security of
users. However, it can expose users’ identities and threaten
their privacy when combined with other personal information
disclosed in their proﬁles. Sweeney reported 87% of Ameri-
cans can be uniquely identiﬁed from a birth date, ﬁve-digit zip
code, and gender [18]. Acquisti and Gross reported the exis-
tence of a potential ability to reconstruct users’ social security
numbers utilizing a combination of information often found in
proﬁles, such as their full name, date of birth and hometown
[5]. Many banks and credit-card companies recommend their
customers to select a personal identiﬁcation number (PIN)
that cannot be easily guessed, for example, birth date [19]
[20]. Bonneau et al. investigated 805 participants and found
that 23% of them chose their PINs representing dates [21].
Furthermore, Bonneau et al. asked users about the signiﬁcance
of the dates in their PINs: 29% of them used their own
birthday, 26% the birthday of a partner or family member, and
25% an important life event like an anniversary or graduation.
As a result, we should be aware of the potential privacy risks
on SNSs and manage our personal information carefully. SNSs
do not force users to reveal personal information. However, we
think, they actually recommend and encourage them to do so.
As shown in Fig. 1, Twitter recommended users to add their
birthdays on their Twitter proﬁles. On the other hand, Twitter
enables each user to set the visibility preferences for his/her
birthday on the proﬁle from options [22] [23]:

Fig. 2 shows a Twitter proﬁle where a user sets the visibility
preferences for his/her birthday. However, even if a user set it
closed, his/her birthday would be revealed to others when the
following kind of tweets was submitted.
(exp 6) @446xx110rn tanjyobi omedetou!!
(@446xx110rn Happy birthday!!)
We found many tweets where someone’s birthdays were re-
vealed and linked to speciﬁc Twitter accounts. We may say that
Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 show a disconnection between the Twitter’s
desire to protect their users’ privacy and their actual behavior.
III.
INVESTIGATION OF TWEETS WHERE BIRTHDAYS ARE
REVEALED TO OTHER PEOPLE
In this section, we show how we disclose or reveal birthday
information on Twitter.
A. The investigation object
We collected
•
1,000 Japanese tweets including word “tanjyobi (birth-
day)” in December 2015 and
•
1,000 English tweets including word “birthday” in
December 2016.
We used these 2,000 tweets for investigating tweets where
birthdays were revealed to other people.
Tweets can be classiﬁed into three types [24]:
•
reply
A reply is submitted to a particular person. It contains
“@username” in the body of the tweet. For example,
(exp 3), (exp 5), and (exp 6) are replies.
•
retweet
A retweet is a reply to a tweet that includes the original
tweet.
•
normal tweet
A normal tweet is neither reply nor retweet. For ex-
ample, (exp 2) and (exp 4) are normal tweets. Normal
tweets are generally submitted to general public.
Fig. 3 shows the numbers and percentages of normal tweets,
replies, and retweets in the 1,000 Japanese tweets. As shown in
Fig. 3, there were no retweets in the 1,000 Japanese tweets. On
the other hand, Fig. 4 shows the numbers and percentages of
normal tweets, replies, and retweets in the 7,085,267 Japanese
tweets obtained in November and December 2012 by using
the streaming API [25]. The comparison of Fig. 3 with
Fig. 4 shows that word “tanjyobi (birthday)” was used more
frequently in replies than normal tweets. We classiﬁed these
1,000 Japanese tweets into three types:
TYPE S
tweets where senders’ birthdays were disclosed
by themselves,
TYPE R
tweets where receivers’ birthdays were revealed
by senders, and
TYPE N tweets where no one’s birthdays were revealed.
Table I shows the classiﬁcation result of the 1,000 Japanese
tweets. We corrected the classiﬁcation result reported in our
previous study [1]. Especially, we carefully classiﬁed replies
submitted to user accounts that were not open to the public.
In our previous study [1], all the replies submitted to closed
user accounts were classiﬁed into TYPE N. However, in
this study, replies disclosing senders’ birthdays and receivers’
birthdays are classiﬁed into TYPE S and TYPE R, respectively,
although they were submitted to closed user accounts. As
shown in Table I, there were 326 tweets revealing senders’
or receivers’ birthdays. Furthermore, the number of tweets
revealing receivers’ birthdays (234 tweets) was more than
twice the number of tweets revealing senders’ birthdays (92
tweets). In this study, a tweet where someone’s birthday was
revealed but could not be linked to a speciﬁc Twitter account
was classiﬁed into TYPE N: tweets where no one’s birthdays
were revealed. For example, the birthdays of oniichan (brother)
in (exp 7) and Chihiro Iwasaki in (exp 8) were revealed but
could not be linked to their Twitter accounts. As a result, in
this study, these tweets were classiﬁed into TYPE N.
(exp 7) kyou ha jikkei no tanjyobi! oniichan tanjyobi
omedetou – ! 18 kin kaikin toka otona yana...
(Today is my elder brother’s birthday! Happy
birthday, brother. Now, you can watch movies for
adults only...)
(exp 8) Iwasaki Chihiro san no tanjyobi nanoka
(Today is the birthday of Chihiro Iwasaki.)
Chihiro Iwasaki was a famous Japanese artist.
Fig. 5 shows the numbers and percentages of normal
tweets, replies, and retweets in the 1,000 English tweets. As
with the Japanese tweets, Fig. 5 shows that there were no
retweets in the 1,000 English tweets. On the other hand, Fig.
6 shows the numbers and percentages of normal tweets, replies,
and retweets in the 31,253,241 English tweets obtained in

November and December 2012. As with Japanese tweets, the
comparison of Fig. 5 with Fig. 6 shows that word “birthday”
was used more frequently in replies than normal tweets. Table
II shows the classiﬁcation result of the 1,000 English tweets.
As shown in Table II, 70% of the 1,000 English tweets were
tweets revealing someone’s birthdays to other people. Further-
more, 90% of English tweets revealing someone’s birthdays
to other people were ones where receivers’ birthdays were
revealed.
B. Tweets where birthdays are revealed
1) Tweets where senders’ birthdays are revealed (TYPE
S): In order to start new communications on Twitter, many
users submitted tweets where their birthdays were disclosed by
themselves. The point is that senders disclosed their birthdays
not only in normal tweets but replies. Both (exp 9) and (exp 10)
were normal tweets where senders’ birthdays were disclosed
by themselves.
(exp 9) kyou tanjyobi nanode dareka nonde kudasai!!!!
(Today is my birthday. Does anyone keen to go
drinking with me!!!!)
(exp 10) shi-a-wa—se suggoi tanoshii tanjyobi deshita–
!!! minasan no okagedesu. arigatou gozaimasu.
toriaezu ashi itasugiru. hayo ie tsukan ka na-n
(H-A-P-P-Y I had a very happy birthday!!! I do
appreciate you. Thank you. Just say my foot hurts.
I want to go home soon.)
On the other hand, (exp 11) was a reply where sender’s
birthday was disclosed by himself/herself.
(exp 11) @takutwu w takuto kun– kyou tanjyobi nanda
oiwai rep hoshii na
(@takutwu w Takuto kun–, today is my birthday.
Give me your birthday message, please.)
As shown in Table I and Table II, senders’ birthdays were
disclosed in normal tweets more frequently than replies. (exp
9) and (exp 10) were normal tweets and the senders of them
wanted to communicate with anyone. On the other hand, (exp
11) was a reply and the sender of it wanted to communicate
with a particular person (@takutwu w). However, all of (exp
9), (exp 10), and (exp 11) were submitted for starting new
communications on Twitter. On the other hand, (exp 12) was
a reply where the sender disclosed her birthday not because
she wanted to start a new communication but because she was
asked when her birthday was.
(exp 12) @kmns6 n teru-chan kon (*´ ∇｀*) sou nano–
kinou tanjyobi deshita. arigatoune– ♡ mata hi-
totsu toshi wo totte shimatta wa zutto nannimo

(@kmns6 n Teru-chan hello (*´ ∇｀*) Yes.
Yesterday was my birthday. Thank you ♡ I got
another year older again. I have got your birthday
message out of my mind because you said nothing
for a long time. I am happy ♪)
All of (exp 9), (exp 10), (exp 11), and (exp 12) were submitted
within one day of senders’ birthdays. On the other hand, (exp
13) and (exp 14) were not. The senders of (exp 13) and (exp
14) disclosed their birthdays by showing the dates.
(exp 13) boku no tanjyobi ha, 2007 nen 9 gatsu 20 nichi
goro da nya– (ˆˆ)
(My date of birth is September 20, 2007 –(ˆˆ))
(exp 14) @alex hayate shigusa...uwame dukai toka? a,
tanjyobi ha 8 gatsu nanoka desu
(@alex hayate gesture... up-from-under look? Oh,
my birthday is August 7.)
The sender of (exp 15) disclosed his birthday by showing not
the date but the festival day, Tanabata, when he was born.
(exp 15) bokura no tanjyobi wa tanabata. orihime to hiko-
boshi ga, chotto shita kiseki wo purezento shite
kurerun da.
(Our birthday is Tanabata. Orihime and Hikoboshi
will give us a little miracle.)
All of (exp 9), (exp 10), (exp 11), (exp 12), (exp 13), (exp 14),
and (exp 15) were classiﬁed into TYPE S. On the other hand,
(exp 16) was classiﬁed into TYPE N: tweets where no one’s
birthdays were revealed. This is because the sender of (exp
16) disclosed his birthday by using a metaphorical expression,
mid-summer Christmas Eve. As a result, we determined that
sender’s birthday of (exp 16) was unclear. We shall discuss
tweets classiﬁed into TYPE N later.
(exp 16) @keirin55keigo
@yuma123007
manatsu
no
Christmas Eve ga boku no tanjyobi!
(@keirin55keigo
@yuma123007
mid-summer
Christmas Eve is my birthday!)
Sender’s birthday of (exp 17) was also unclear. The sender of
(exp 17) disclosed her birthday by showing not the date but
whom she shared the same birthday with.
(exp 17) masaka no furukawa yuuki kun to onaji tanjyobi
ww majime ni ureshii desu
(Oh, I share the same birthday with Yuuki Fu-
rukawa kun ww Very happy.)
Yuuki Furukawa in (exp 17) was an actor and his birthday
might be published. However, we did not understand his
birthday with just (exp 17). As a result, we determined that
sender’s birthday of (exp 17) was unclear. In this study, tweets
where birthdays were revealed unclearly, such as (exp 16) and
(exp 17), were classiﬁed into TYPE N.
2) Tweets where receivers’ birthdays are revealed (TYPE
R): As shown in Table I and Table II, tweets where re-
ceivers’ birthdays were revealed by senders were all replies.
Furthermore, almost half of Japanese replies including word
“tanjyobi (birthday)” were ones revealing receivers’ birthdays.
Also, 90% of English replies including word “birthday” were
ones revealing receivers’ birthdays. Tweets revealing receivers’
birthdays were almost birthday messages to them, such as (exp
18).
(exp 18) @nami 1215
nami tanjyobi omedetou!!!
(@nami 1215
Nami happy birthday!!!)
Birthday messages were mainly submitted into Twitter on
receiver’s birthdays. However, we often found belated birthday
messages on Twitter, such as (exp 19).
(exp 19) @identity u 1 nichi okure desu kedo, tanjyobi
omedetou gozaimasu?
(@identity u one day late, but anyway, happy
birthday?)
91
International Journal on Advances in Internet Technology, vol 10 no 1 & 2, year 2017, http://www.iariajournals.org/internet_technology/
2017, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org

Belated birthday messages can be classiﬁed into two types:
•
belated birthday messages from which we can under-
stand when receivers’ birthdays were, and
•
belated birthday messages from which we cannot
understand when receivers’ birthdays were.
For example, (exp 19) is classiﬁed into the former type. On
the other hand, (exp 20) and (exp 21) are classiﬁed into the
latter type. This is because it is unclear how late (exp 20)
was submitted into Twitter from receiver’s birthday. Also, it is
unclear how early (exp 21) was submitted into Twitter before
receiver’s birthday. In this study, the former type of tweets
were classiﬁed into TYPE R. On the other hand, the latter
type of tweets were classiﬁed into TYPE N.
(exp 20) @ayaka li u3u ayaka osoku natta kedo tanjyobi
omedetou
(@ayaka li u3u ayaka, belated happy birthday to
you)
(exp 21) @0218tom0 tanjyobi wa, mada, dakedo, tanjyobi
omedetou?? ToMo ga, shiawase tte omotte kure-
tara, watasi ha, cho shiawase dayo??
(@0218tom0 a little bit early, but, happy birth-
day?? If ToMo feels happy, I am very happy,
aren’t I??)
3) Tweets revealing no one’s birthdays (TYPE N): Tweets
where birthdays could not be linked to speciﬁc Twitter ac-
counts, such as (exp 22), (exp 23), and (exp 24), were classiﬁed
into TYPE N: tweets where no one’s birthdays were revealed.
(exp 22) ke-taman tanjyobi omedetou –
(ke-taman happy birthday –)
(exp 23) kyou ha daisuki na aya chan no tanjyobi!!!
(Today is my favorite Aya’s birthday!!!)
(exp 24) @hokoa a Valentine Day- yade w Jingu no tanjy-
obi ww tsuraa www watashi ha iroiro dashi sugite
tsurai ww
(@hokoa a Valentine’s Day w Jingu’s birthday
ww hard www I had a hard time of it ww)
(exp 25) was also classiﬁed into TYPE N. This is because it is
unclear whether (exp 25) was submitted on sender’s birthday
or before.
(exp 25) @AhyonCulturismo,@is9 miku N? ore heno tan-
jyobi puresento youi shite kureteru no ? sho–ga
nai na–. morai ni ittya ou kana (ˆoˆ)
(@AhyonCulturismo,@is9 miku
Oh?
Do
you
prepare a present for me? Oh, well. I’m gonna
get it (ˆoˆ))
It is unclear whose birthday live streaming the sender of (exp
26) provided. As a result, (exp 26) was classiﬁed into TYPE
N.
(exp 26) kyou ha 0ji kara kossori tanjyobi oiwai CAS
shimasu (● ´ ω ｀● )
(I will secretly provide a happy birthday live
streaming from midnight tonight (● ´ ω ｀● ))
It is clear that the sender of (exp 27) and chiipopo shared the
same birthday. However, it is unclear when their same birthday
was. As a result, (exp 27) was classiﬁed into TYPE N.
(exp 27) watashi chiipopo to tanjyobi onaji yawa
(I share the same birthday with chiipopo.)

tweets where someone’s birthdays are revealed. In this section,
we discuss whether we can automatically detect tweets where
someone’s birthdays are revealed by using machine learning
techniques.
In this study, we used the support vector machine (SVM)
for data training and classifying. Table III shows feature
s1 ∼ s16 used in machine learning on experimental data.
s1 ∼ s7 were obtained by using the results of morphological
analysis on experimental data. In the experiments, we used a
Japanese morphological analyzer, JUMAN, for word segmen-
tation of Japanese tweets [26]. Also, we used the TreeTagger
for annotating English tweets with part-of-speech and lemma
information [27] [28] [29]. s8 ∼ s10 and s12 ∼ s14 were
obtained by extracting character N-gram from experimental
data. Odaka et al. reported that character 3-gram is good for
Japanese processing [30]. s4 ∼ s7 and s12 ∼ s15 were
obtained from ﬁrst sentences of tweets. This is because, we
thought, clue expressions of birthday messages are often found
at ﬁrst sentences of tweets.
In this study, we used the 1,000 Japanese tweets and 1,000
English tweets investigated in Section III for the experimental
data. We conducted this experiment using TinySVM [31].
Table IV shows the experimental result of the 1,000 Japanese
tweets. The experimental result was obtained with 10-fold
cross-validation. As shown in Fig. 3, the experimental data
of the Japanese tweets consisted of 560 normal tweets and
440 replies. We divided the experimental result of the 1,000
Japanese tweets (Table IV) into those of 560 normal tweets
(Table V) and 440 replies (Table VI). On the other hand, Table

VII shows the experimental result of the 1,000 English tweets.
As shown in Fig. 5, the experimental data of the English
tweets consisted of 332 normal tweets and 668 replies. We
also divided the experimental result of the 1,000 English tweets
(Table VII) into those of 332 normal tweets (Table VIII) and
668 replies (Table IX).
As shown in Table IV, 881 Japanese tweets were classiﬁed
correctly and 119 tweets incorrectly in this experiment. 76
tweets out of the 119 incorrectly classiﬁed tweets were ones
where senders’ birthdays were revealed. As shown in Table
IV, the recall of Japanese tweets revealing senders’ birthdays
were 17%. As shown in Table V and Table VI, many Japanese
normal tweets and replies revealing senders’ birthdays were
classiﬁed incorrectly into tweets revealing no one’s birthdays.
On the other hand, as shown in Table VII, 871 English tweets
were classiﬁed correctly and 129 tweets incorrectly in this ex-
periment. 58 tweets out of the 129 incorrectly classiﬁed tweets
were ones where senders’ birthdays were revealed. As shown
in Table VII, the recall of English tweets revealing senders’
birthdays were 30%. As shown in Table VIII and Table IX,
many English normal tweets and replies revealing senders’
birthdays were classiﬁed incorrectly into tweets revealing no
one’s birthdays and receivers’ birthdays, respectively. As a
result, it is difﬁcult to detect Japanese and English tweets
revealing senders’ birthdays and give warnings to senders
before they submit tweets revealing their birthdays. On the
other hand, Table IV shows the precision of Japanese tweets
revealing senders’ and receivers’ birthdays were 84% and 90%,
respectively. Also, Table VII shows the precision of English

tweets revealing receivers’ birthdays was 93%. Our method
is useful for collecting tweets revealing birthdays, especially
tweets revealing receivers’ birthdays, precisely. As a result, it
is easy for attackers to collect birthday information related to
speciﬁc Twitter accounts by using our method.
Next, we discuss the number of tweets for data training.
We conducted closed and open tests to measure the accuracy
of the SVM classiﬁer developed by using tweets investigated
in Section III. In this experiments, we introduced the following
data sets for the open tests:
•
500 Japanese tweets including word “tanjyobi (birth-
day)” (obtained in December 2016) and
•
500 English tweets including word “birthday” (ob-
tained in December 2016).
Table X and Table XI show the classiﬁcation results of the 500
Japanese and English tweets, respectively. There were no du-
plicate tweets between these data sets and tweets investigated
in Section III. The accuracy values in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 are
ten times average values of the accuracy of classifying tweets
into ones revealing birthdays of senders, receivers, and others.
Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 show that, both in the closed tests and open
tests, we obtained about 80% accuracy when we used only 100
tweets for data training. The accuracy was slightly improved
as the number of tweets for data training increased. The point
is that, as shown in Table IV and Table VII, the recall of
tweets revealing senders’ birthdays was low even if we used
1,000 tweets for data training. The recall rate of Japanese and
English tweets revealing senders’ birthdays were only 17%
and 30%, respectively. As a result, it is difﬁcult to develop an
SVM detecting tweets revealing senders’ birthdays.
V.
CONCLUSION
Many people willingly disclose their birthdays on their
SNS proﬁles and reveal others’ birthdays on their SNS mes-
sages. They seem unaware of the potential risks of doing
it. Birthday information alone cannot threaten their privacy
and security. However, it can expose users’ identities and
threaten their privacy when combined with other personal

information disclosed in their proﬁles. Interestingly, we treat
birthday information different than other personal information.
For example, if someone revealed our personal information
except birthday on a SNS, we would get upset him/her for
doing it. On the other hand, if someone revealed our birthday
in his/her birthday message on a SNS, most of us would feel
happy and appreciate what he/she does. However, we have not
sufﬁciently investigated how we reveal birthday information
on SNSs. As a result, the authors investigated how we reveal
birthday information on SNSs, not only ours but of others.
In this study, we investigated tweets where someone’s
birthdays were revealed to other people. We collected 1,000
Japanese tweets including word “tanjyobi (birthday)” and
found that about 30% of them were tweets where someone’s
birthdays were revealed to other people. Furthermore, about
70% of Japanese tweets revealing someone’s birthdays were
ones where receivers’ birthdays were revealed by senders. We
also collected 1,000 English tweets including word “birthday”
and found that about 70% of them were tweets where some-
one’s birthdays were revealed to other people. Furthermore,

about 90% of English tweets revealing someone’s birthdays
were ones where receivers’ birthdays were revealed by senders.
In this study, we proposed a method of detecting tweets reveal-
ing someone’s birthday by using machine learning techniques.
The experimental results showed that our method was able to
classify Japanese tweets including word “tanjyobi (birthday)”
and English tweets including word “birthday” with accuracy
of 88% and 87%, respectively. However, the recall of Japanese
and English tweets revealing senders’ birthday were only 17%
and 30%, respectively. As a result, in our method, it is difﬁcult
to detect tweets revealing senders’ birthdays and give warnings
to senders before they submit them. On the other hand, the
precision of Japanese tweets revealing senders’ and receivers’
birthdays were 71% and 82%, respectively. Also, the precision
of English tweets revealing receivers’ birthdays was 93%. As a
result, in our method, it is not difﬁcult to collect tweets reveal-
ing birthdays, especially tweets revealing receivers’ birthdays,
precisely. We recommend that birthday messages should not be
sent via SNSs. This is because unwanted audiences can read
and collect them. We are now investigating other language
tweets where birthdays are disclosed or revealed to other
people.
