Abstract—The metro system is an important transportation 
mode for urban cities. This system has had a long operation 
time since its construction, is still operating, and will not be 
replaced easily. Hence, it can be classified as a legacy system. 
Moreover, the metro system requires preventive or corrective 
maintenance, because there are still situations and occurrences 
that cannot be properly predicted. During the corrective 
maintenance, the metro line is still running while the railroad 
worker is also on the railway. In this situation, the operator, 
from the Operations Control Center (OCC), must create a safe 
area for the railroad worker to carry out the maintenance. 
Although the metro line has safety procedures, training, and 
rules for this situation, a miscommunication or leak of the 
operator’s attention might make the railroad worker 
vulnerable to accidents. Based on that, this paper focuses on 
providing an architecture in which the railroad worker is 
considered protected automatically. The railroad worker 
protection system architecture is modeled using the Production 
Flow Schema (PFS), as well as the metro one, to present the 
architectures` operation and the interaction between the two 
architectures. 
Keywords: metro system; legacy system; protection system 
architecture; production flow schema. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
      The metro system is a transportation mode characterized 
by being capable of transporting people or goods, at high 
velocity and with a high level of safety [1]. In a big city, 
such as São Paulo (Brazil) for instance, approximately 81 
million people used metro lines 1, 2, and 3 in January 2020. 
Beyond that, the metro system is the most efficient option to 
be implemented in urban areas based on the space occupied 
compared to the other types of transportation [1]. 
      Another characteristic of the metro system is the long 
operating time. In some cases, the metro system in London 
(England) has been working since 1890, in Chicago (USA) 
since 1897 [2], and in São Paulo (Brazil) since 1974 [3]. 
Considering this operating time and the old technology used 
on these systems, they can be regarded as legacy systems. 
Legacy systems are running systems that do not comply 
with the emerging architectural standards but still meet 
some functional business needs [4]. Moreover, legacy 
systems cannot be easily stopped because of the critical 
information in their operational code and database. Lastly, 
legacy systems demand frequent and complex maintenance 
[5]. 
      The metro system comprises different equipment 
responsible for controlling energy consumption, passenger 
flow, managing rail devices, and supporting operating the 
line. Equipment or devices in general need maintenance, 
mainly when they have a long operating time, such as the 
ones that belong to the metro system. When maintenance of 
railway equipment is required during metro line operation, 
such as a broken rail, for example, some safety actions are 
required to allow local safe maintenance while the 
remaining line continues to run. The operator, who is 
monitoring and controlling the line, takes these actions 
manually. If these actions are not taken properly, the 
railroad worker, carrying out the field maintenance, is 
unsafe. 
      According to the company responsible for managing the 
metro lines in São Paulo, there were 57 accidents between 
2017 and 2021 on the railway in São Paulo. These accidents 
are related to inadequate management of the tools, same-
level fall, not following the internal procedure, and bumping 
on objects or equipment. Although none of the accidents 
reported by the company were fatal, fatal ones were found 
in the São Paulo metro history. 
      A 30-year experienced railroad worker was run over by 
a metro car. He was wearing Personal Protection Equipment 
(PPE). The accident’s cause was the lack of communication 
between the operator and the railroad worker [6]. In another 
case, the railroad worker was electrocuted, while he was 
executing maintenance on a circuit breaker that was badly 
signalized. In addition, the railroad worker reported 
communication issues between him and the operator. 
Although the railroad worker was wearing PPE, he was 
aware of the safety rules, and had years of experience, these 
were not enough to protect him [7]. 
      Some similar cases were found outside Brazil. In New 
York (USA), for instance, a railroad worker was taken to a 
hospital with severe injuries [8]. According to the news, he 
had five years of experience and there were lights and 
signals to avoid accidents. However, this was not enough to 
stop the train on time. In London (England), an inspector 
was run over by the train during his work routines [9]. In 
this case, there was a system to alert the inspector about the 
train arriving, but this was also not enough to protect him. It 
was described by the local news that this system was only 
able to alert the inspector, not to take action to guarantee the 
inspector’s protection.

      The common reason for these accidents is the 
miscommunication between the railroad worker, who is 
executing the maintenance on the field, and the operator, 
who is the Operations Control Center (OCC) monitoring not 
only the maintenance activities, but the whole metro line. 
This issue is also highlighted in [10] as the main reason that 
keeps the railway insecure in London. Hence, a system 
focused on automatically protecting the railroad workers 
during their activities shall create a new layer of protection 
for them and avoid miscommunication-related accidents, 
such as touching an energized power rail, being hit by a 
train or energized switch rail, and not being quickly notified 
about a fire detection on the railway. 
      Although a new system needs to be added to the metro 
architecture, the metro system is a legacy system, and as 
such, cannot be changed easily. Hence, the new system 
architecture shall run separately of the metro architecture. 
Furthermore, the interface points between the two 
architectures shall be mapped to reduce the changes needed 
in the metro architecture. In summary, the contribution of 
this paper is the presentation of a railroad worker protection 
architecture that protects the railroad worker and can 
communicate with the metro architecture with minimum 
interference. Beyond that, this paper shows a railroad 
worker protection system architecture and metro system 
architecture modeled using the Production Flow Schema 
(PFS). 
      The remainder of this paper is divided into five sections. 
Section II presents the projects and papers related to worker 
protection in railway/metro systems. Section III describes 
the metro system architecture. Section IV focuses on PFS. 
After this, Section V models the metro and railroad worker 
protection system architecture in PFS. Finally, Section VI is 
the conclusion. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
      The section lists projects/papers that highlight solutions 
to improve the railroad worker safety during his tasks on 
field. 
      The authors of [11] propose a system to detect if the rail 
vehicle is next to the railroad worker location. This system 
uses fiber optic interferometers as vibration sensors to detect 
the rail vehicle next to him. Once a rail vehicle is detected, 
the authors suggest optical or acoustical signal to alert the 
railroad worker. 
      The authors of [12] present a wearable Global 
Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) sensor to track the 
railroad worker in rail worksites. His position is used to 
verify if the railroad worker is in any dangerous area. 
Although this paper focuses on protecting the railroad 
worker, it does not clarify how to protect him, only how to 
detect if he is in a dangerous area. 
      The Litum company developed a safety system that 
monitors in real-time the construction workers during the 
construction of the Paris subway expansion [13]. This 
project 
used 
Ultra-Wideband 
Radio-Frequency 
Identification (UWB RFID) attached to the 400 construction 
workers’ helmets. Beyond that, the tunnel where the 
construction workers were is 33km long in total and they 
received alarms by e-mail through Wi-Fi. The goal of this 
system was to ensure that only authorized construction 
workers were in the restricted areas, the number of 
construction workers in specific areas were not exceeded, 
confirmed that all workers followed the directions, and the 
system was capable to react quickly in potential cases of 
emergency. 
      The author of [14] suggests a safety mechanism that 
uses image analyses to verify whether a track segment is 
damaged or not. The author focuses on the SkyTran track, 
but this solution can be applied to other rail tracks. 
Although this solution can prevent derailing, 
and 
consequently damage to the railroad worker, this paper does 
not present how this system will be integrated to any 
railway system. 
       Lastly, the authors of [15] propose a solution in which 
the railroad worker is alerted when the train arrival time to 
his position is 30 seconds or less. In this solution, the 
railroad worker wears wearable device that contains a 
Global Position System (GPS) sensor, radio receptor device 
and actuators to create tactile, visual, and sound alerts. 
Moreover, a GPS sensor and radio transmitter, signaling on 
broadcasting mode, are attached to the train. 
      Although the solutions presented in this section focus on 
the railroad worker safety, gathering more data from him 
and keeping him updated, most of them require that he or 
any other operator react to guarantee the railroad worker 
safety. The goal of this paper is beyond that; it is to monitor 
and protect the railroad worker automatically, not depending 
on anyone’s reaction, once activated. 
III. 
METRO SYSTEM 
      The São Paulo’s metro system can be divided into two 
main systems: Signaling and Control System (SCS) and 
Central Control System (CCS). The SCS is responsible for 
rail equipment management, metro position and protection, 
and passenger safety on the metro. The CCS is responsible 
for station management, equipment monitoring and control, 
and passenger safety in the station. These systems 
interchange information, such as train position, fire 
detection, power consumption, etc. These systems can be 
seen in Figure 1. 
      According to [16], the SCS follows the IEEE 1474.1-
2004 [17], which described the requirements to execute the 
Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC). In other 
words, it describes the system requirement to allow the train 
to run safely and automatically. The SCS is divided into 
three subsystems: Automatic Train Protection (ATP), which 
certifies that the train has a speed-maximal threshold for the 
metro car in each section of the railway to ensure a safe 
road, protecting the train from collisions; Automatic Train 
Operation (ATO), that shall define the metro road, metro 
velocity (following the maximum speed established by 
30

ATP), and the waiting time in each station; and Automatic 
Train Supervision (ATS), that is the SCS supervisory, 
presenting the position and status of the metro and rail 
devices on operator’s screen. The ATP and the ATO are 
usually defined by regions. Hence, they are presented as 
Regional ATP (RATP) and Regional ATO (RATO). 
 
Figure 1. São Paulo’s metro system architecture translated into English 
[18]. 
      The CCS has a central Supervisory Control and Data 
Acquisition (SCADA) component that monitors and 
controls the equipment in the metro line. The CCS is also 
divided into three subsystems: Electric Control System 
(ECS), Passengers Flow Control system (PFC), and 
Auxiliary Equipment System (AES). For instance, the ECS 
monitors and controls electric devices, such as feeders, third 
rail, and circuit breakers. Beyond that, the ECS monitor the 
demand and power consumption. The PFC controls the 
passenger flow. Therefore, this subsystem monitors and 
controls cameras, elevators, escalators, etc. Finally, all other 
devices, such as fire detectors, cooling devices, pumps, 
tanks, networks, and multimedia devices are included in the 
AES. 
       The metro system has an OCC where the workstations, 
SCADA server, ATS server, videowall, and others are 
located. From the OCC, the operator can monitor and 
control the metro line. Furthermore, the operator can 
communicate remotely with the railroad worker through 
Walkie-Talkie. 
      It is important to highlight that, besides the metro 
system being a legacy system, the metro architecture also 
follows the automation pyramid proposed by International 
Society of Automation (ISA) in ISA-95 [19], as can be seen 
in Figure 1. This means the three bottom layers of ISA-95 
(field, control, supervisory) are present in this architecture, 
from bottom to top: field layer is indicated in yellow; 
control layer is shown in green; and supervisory layer in red. 
Lasty, due to a huge number of devices present in each 
system, this paper will focus on two of them from each 
system: 
• 
CCS: we present the behavior of the feeder, a circuit 
breaker used in middle voltage to feed the power rail, 
because the power rail is not directly controllable, and 
the fire detector. The feeder status is opened or closed, 
and can be commanded to open or close. The fire 
detector status is activated or not activated. Note that 
there is no command for the fire detector; 
• 
SCS: we present the behavior of the rail switch and the 
metro car. The rail switch status is like the CCS 
equipment. In other words, the device status is 
energized or de-energized, and can be commanded to 
energize and de-energize. Whereas the train can be 
understood in a different way, the train behavior is 
based on the speed thresholds in a specific area. The 
ATP defines this and can be controlled by the ATS. If 
the speed threshold is 0, the area is blocked for the 
train. If it is not 0, the train can pass through that area. 
IV. 
PRODUCTION FLOW SCHEMA 
      Production Flow Schema (PFS) is an interpreted graph 
from Petri Net (PN) to model Discrete Events Systems 
(DES) in an abstract level [20]. The PFS was designed to 
systematize and facilitate the modeling process, because 
system modeling processes are done in a natural language, 
and the mathematical formalism is guaranteed due to the net 
structure. 
      The PFS allows abstract model improvement using a 
top-down approach exploring the macro events [21]. 
Furthermore, this graph does not have a token, different 
from the PN, because the PFS focuses on the structural 
description of the items flow and system data. However, 
when reaching the appropriate level of detail for the study, a 
PN or Colored Petri Net (CPN) model can be directly 
generated to carry out analysis through simulation. 
      The PFS is also considered a bipartite graph compound 
of activity elements (action, execution), distributing 
elements (collect, accumulate and/or store items), and 
31

oriented arcs to connect the elements [22]. These elements 
and the different structures allowed in PFS can be seen in 
Figure 2. 
      It is important to highlight that the communication flow 
between different modules can only be used, if the data/item 
used in each net is different and if this arc represents the 
data flow between the activity elements. 
      According to [23], EN 50128, which defines software 
development requirements for railway applications, highly 
recommend the use of semi-formal methods (like PN, and 
consequently PFS and CPN) for developing safety related 
software for railway application to satisfy the safety 
requirements. In addition, [24] presents the advantage of the 
PN comparing it to other safety analysis tools, such as 
expanded Failure Mode & Effects Analysis (FMEA), and 
Hazard and Operability (HAZOP). Based on that, PN, PFS 
and CPN are applicable for safety applications. Lasty, there 
are several applications of the PN and CPN in railway 
applications, for instance [25] and [26], but they do not 
focus on protecting the railroad worker. 
 
Figure 2. Elements, structures and flows in PFS [21]. 
      The conversion from the PFS to the PN was used in 
[20], and can be explain through an example in Figure 3. In 
this picture, the PFS model can be seen in the left side, and 
the equivalent of this PN model in the right side. Note that 
the activities can be replaced by one or more places in the 
PN model, and the brackets by transitions. If there is an arc 
entering or leaving the activity in the middle, a transition 
shall be added. Moreover, the communication flow between 
different modules is represented by a transition fusion in the 
PN, as can be seen by the transition {t1}. The mark position 
should be decided at the end of the modeling process. 
 
Figure 3. Example of conversion from PFS to PN. 
      Since the PFS focuses on the architecture structure, the 
model of the metro system architecture, more specifically 
São Paulo’s one, and railroad worker protection system 
architecture in the PFS are presented in the next sections. 
Thus, the architecture structure, through the architecture 
models and interaction between each other, must be defined, 
before executing simulation analysis. If the architecture 
structure is wrong, it will be useless, even though the results 
of the simulations are positives. Moreover, this paper will 
present only PFS due to space available. 
V. 
ARCHITECTURES MODELING 
      The railroad worker protection architecture shall follow 
the same division in three macro activities, and color, as 
shown in Figure 4. The goal is a system that works 
automatically. Hence, it needs to acquire railroad worker 
positions in real-time to know which equipment and area 
shall be interlocked. Beyond that, it needs a real-time 
channel to inform the railroad worker of alarms. These two 
requirements are related to [Railroad Worker Protection 
Field]. 
 
Figure 4. Main activities of the metro and rail worker protection system 
architecture. 
       [Railroad Worker Protection Control] shall start and 
stop the railroad worker position request if there is any on 
the railway. Moreover, this layer shall also prepare a 
database of pre-recorded voice message to be sent to 
railroad workers based on the alarm message. 
      Finally, [Railroad Worker Protection Supervisory] 
shall monitor and manage the protection of the railroad 
worker. Moreover, it shall interface with the other systems.  
      Since all equipment data in a metro architecture are in 
[CCS Supervisory] and [SCS Supervisory], this system 
architecture will interface with the existing metro 
architecture through the supervisory layer. In addition, the 
equipment commands shall be executed initially by [CCS 
Supervisory] and [SCS Supervisory]. Finally, [Railroad 
Worker Protection Supervisory] shall be responsible for 
identifying the equipment to be interlocked in each system. 
      Although CCS and SCS supervisory are interchanging 
information as reported in Section III, this information does 
not affect the railroad worker protection system architecture. 
Hence, this connection is not presented in PFS model.  
A. Metro System Architecture 
      [CCS Supervisory] and [SCS Supervisory] can be 
modeled as represented in Figure 5 and Figure 6. First, they 
receive equipment status from the control activity {1} {5}. 
The equipment status can be transferred to other systems 
{A} {C}. From the CCS or SCS to other systems, such as the 
32

ICONS 2023 : The Eighteenth International Conference on Systems

railroad worker protection system. Subsequently, data from 
the other systems is received {B} {D}, and then, the 
equipment command to the control activity can be sent. For 
instance, when the equipment command to interlock from 
the railroad worker system architecture is received, the 
command shall be sent to the control layer in this step 
{2}{6}. Finally, restart the loop. 
      [CCS Control] and [SCS Control] have two main 
tasks: (1) Receive the command from the supervisory {2} 
{6} and deliver to the field equipment {3} {7}; (2) Receive 
the equipment data from the field {4} {8} and deliver to the 
supervisory {1}{5}. 
 
Figure 5. CCS architecture modeled in PFS. “A” and “B” continues in 
Figure 7. 
 
Figure 6. SCS architecture modeled in PFS. “C” and “D” continues in 
Figure 7. 
      [CCS Field] and [SCS Field] have the same structure, 
but equipment used in each model are different. Therefore, 
to each loop, the last equipment data acquired is sent to the 
control layer {4} {8}, and the command, received from 
control activity {3} {7}, is executed. If the equipment does 
not have command, this layer shall only send the equipment 
status. Finally, as discussed in Section III, the behavior of 
the Feeder and fire detector is highlighted and modeled for 
the CCS Field. The behavior of the rail switch and the metro 
car is highlighted and modeled for the SCS Field. 
B. Railroad Worker Protection Architecture 
      The railroad worker protection architecture requires 
tracking the railroad worker in real-time, and according to 
[15] can be used a wearable device for this task, represented 
in [Railroad Worker Protection Field]. Beyond that, the 
railroad worker can be updated automatically through audio 
messages on Walkie-Talkie [Messages received via 
Walkie-Talkie], such as fire alarm messages. In this case, 
the railroad worker can also manage his safety once he is 
well-informed.  
      [Railroad worker Protection Control] shall acquire 
the railroad worker position [Railroad worker data 
request]. This data shall be shared to [Calculate railroad 
worker protection area]. In addition, this layer prepares 
the message to be sent via Walkie Talkie [Send audio 
messages to railroad worker].  
     On [Railroad worker Protection Supervisory], there 
are six main requirements that this macro activity shall 
accomplish: 
1) [Calculate railroad worker protection area]: 
calculates based on the railroad worker position and position 
lost alarm; 
2) [Recognize the equipment to be interlocked]: 
compares the railroad worker position with the equipment 
status, and train location to select the equipment that shall 
be interlocked to guarantee the railroad worker safety. This 
information is sent to the [Middleware] to forward to metro 
system; 
3) [Show on screen the railroad worker data]: 
indicates on screen the railroad worker position and his 
status in real-time; 
4) [Alarm management to keep railroad worker 
updated]: gathers alarms from the [Middleware], for 
example fire detection to update the railway worker; 
5) [Middleware]: allows the communication between 
the metro and railroad worker system. This activity shall 
send the device list and commands to the metro system, 
gather the device status from there and filter the status that 
are alarmed; 
6) [Railroad worker registration management]: the 
operator shall insert the railroad worker in the system, to 
trigger the logics, and remove it, in case the maintenance is 
over. 
      Each activity listed above can be detailed in Figure 7 
and each activity will be explained hereinafter. 
      The operator, knowing the necessary maintenance, shall 
insert the railroad worker into the system through [Railroad 
worker registration management] {1}. This triggers the 
33

ICONS 2023 : The Eighteenth International Conference on Systems

other activities to run {15}. The activities shall continue 
until the operator removes the railroad worker from the 
system {2}. 
 
Figure 7. Refined railroad worker protection architecture modeled in PFS. 
“A”, “B”, “C” and “D” continues in Figure 5 and Figure 6. 
      After receiving the data that the railroad worker is on the 
railway, [Railroad worker data request] starts looking for 
him. First, the signals are sent to the railway, looking for the 
railroad worker {3}. If he is found, his position is calculated 
{4}. If he is not found, a flag is set to alarm the operator {5}. 
This data will be used to calculate his protection area in 
[Calculate railroad worker protection area] {6}. 
      The [Wearable Device Operation] starts off {7}. The 
railroad worker shall turn on the wearable device to be 
found. In case of success, the wearable device is on and 
ready to be found. Once a request signal for data is received 
{3}, the reply signal is sent back {4}. The wearable device 
keeps in this loop until the railroad worker turned the 
wearable device off {8}.  
      The railroad worker position and position lost alarm are 
used to calculate a protection area around him in [Calculate 
railroad worker protection area] {6}. The area value are 
variation of x and y position called delta X and delta Y. In 
case of position lost, the railway worker protection area 
results in a bigger area than the last calculation to protect 
him, if he is nearby. After calculating the delta X and Y, 
these values with the railroad worker position (x and y 
values) are sent to other activities {9}.  
      [Recognize the equipment to be interlocked] uses the 
protection area {9} to match the devices position and 
identify the devices in that area. After that, the list of the 
SCS and CSS equipment that shall be interlocked is sent to 
[Middleware] {10}. 
      [Alarm management to keep railroad worker 
updated] uses the protection area {9} to match the alarms 
activated on SCS and CSS {11}. Once the alarms that apply 
to the railroad worker area are recognized, the messages are 
converted to the voice message in [Send audio messages to 
railroad worker] {12} and then sent to railroad workers via 
Walkie Talkie in [Message received via Walkie-Talkie] 
{13}. In addition, the railroad worker shall be also informed 
through Walkie-Talkie in case of losing his position {14}.  
      [Show on screen the railroad worker data] uses the 
position and area of the railroad worker to show his position 
on the screen. The screens are maps of the railway with 
alarm banner. Therefore, the operator can see the railroad 
worker position, his protection area, and any alarm related 
to him, such as loss of his position. 
      Lasty, the railroad worker protection system architecture 
must interface with metro one, considering it as a legacy 
system, through [Middleware]. Therefore, the devices and 
command devices shall be sent to metro system in a way 
that it can process this information {B} {D}. Furthermore, 
this architecture shall be capable of collecting device data to 
inform him properly {A} {C}. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
      The metro system has been demonstrated to be essential 
to urban cities, mainly because of its capability of 
transporting, occupying less space in comparison to other 
transport modes. This legacy system, compounded of many 
devices, requires repair. Once a maintenance is needed, the 
railroad workers are sent to the railway to fix the issue. The 
accident reports during maintenance have shown that 
34

current safety actions are insufficient to protect the railway 
worker. Hence, a railroad worker protection system 
architecture is needed to protect him automatically. 
      It was concluded that the interface between the metro 
and railroad protection system architecture shall be done 
through the supervisory layer, because metro’s SCADA 
gathers the metro line data. The metro system architecture 
shall command the equipment to an interlock status. The 
PFS can be used to generate the model of the railroad 
worker protection system architecture. 
      Finally, the contribution of this paper is the presentation 
and modeling of an architecture that focuses on protecting 
the railroad workers automatically since activated, taking in 
consideration that metro system is legacy system, in other 
words, reducing changes on the metro system; and on 
simplifying the supervision procedures in OCC. Although it 
was applied the architecture to São Paulo’s metro system, 
this architecture shall be applicable for any metro system. It 
has only to understand the system that the railroad worker 
protection system architecture is being applied to and where 
this architecture can communicate with the metro one. 
Furthermore, its construction in PFS allow the uses of 
formal method as PFS to convert into PN [20] or CPN, and 
subsequently into programming languages [27]. 
A. Further work 
      The PFS model presented will be used to generate the 
CPN model of the railroad worker protection system 
architecture, metro system architecture and their interaction. 
Finally, the CPN model will be simulated to verify and 
validate the proposed architecture. It will be verify if all 
states reachable are safe and there is no deadlock or live lock 
in the modeled system, as done in [25] and [26].
