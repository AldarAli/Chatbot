Abstract— Caregivers face numerous challenges when dealing 
with chronic diseases such as cancer. Ageing populations and 
environmental factors account for increasing numbers of people 
suffering a variety of cancers, and inevitably the increase in 
caregivers. Caregivers may be the influencers for cancer 
treatment decisions by patients, hence their needs as caregivers 
warrant study. This paper focuses on identifying factors of 
cancer caregivers’ needs in the context of an information and 
communication technology oriented society. A total of 84 
caregivers were recruited for the study from two cancer clinics 
in a hospital, located in Kuala Lumpur. Quantitative research 
using a survey instrument was conducted. Factor Analysis was 
used to identify the need factors, that are communication, 
personal well-being, basic healthcare, information access, 
coping with change, and learning needs.  This study identified 
the need for improving communication between cancer 
sufferers and caregivers, from the caregivers’ perspective is 
seen to be crucial. Facilitation on communication needs should 
be incorporated into any patient-centered healthcare system for 
establishing a comprehensive healthcare model. Future 
research is proposed to look more specifically into information, 
communication and learning needs. 
Keywords- Cancer; caregivers’ need; communication; 
information; factor analysis. 
 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
Being in the socially connected and information era, 
caregivers face challenges in selecting and using information 
for decision making in their caregiving tasks and decisions. 
Reference [29] identified the importance of health (cancer) 
literacy for caregivers. They mentioned that “accessing 
information from the internet may entail additional demands 
and capacities compared to traditional health literacy due to 
the factor of competing sources, identifying accurate and 
trustworthy resources, technological and internet literacy, as 
well as access to technology and the internet” (p.12). They 
propose future research could examine various strategies in 
providing information to caregivers through eHealth 
modalities. Reference [18] suggested that innovative health 
education such as mobile learning applications will further 
expand the context of a smart learning ecosystem for cancer 
education.  
Caregiver is defined as “someone who performs hands-on 
care and/or provides emotional support to patients, such as a 
partner, relative or friend” ([6], p. 388). “Formal caregivers 
typically undergo training and certification, and may 
inherently have greater health literacy capacities compared to 
informal caregivers” ([29], p. 12). The term “caregivers” used 
in this study is to encompass both partners and family 
caregivers, who are inherently informal caregivers.  
Caregivers to elderly recipients have a significant 
influence on their treatment [17]. Support is needed for 
caregivers, such as physical, psychological, social, and 
spiritual [1] [20] and encompass many decades of care for 
patients with chronic neurological conditions such as multiple 
sclerosis, Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s disease, stroke and 
Parkinson’s disease [22]. However, the capacity of informal 
caregivers to source and utilize information in order for them 
to perform their tasks is not well understood [30], especially 
in the current socially connected world. Caregiving tasks are 
complex. Increasingly, the family and society are aging and 
the chance of elderly affected by the disease is higher. The 
roles of family caregivers are multifaceted and understanding 
their needs are crucial. 
The purpose of conducting this study is mainly to identify 
the cancer caregivers’ needs within the context of information 
seeking and informal learning model.  The need factors were 
adapted based on [6], with additional factors on informal 
learning in the information era as highlighted in the literature 
review. The study reported a detailed process of Principal 
Component Analysis (PCA). The identified need factors may 
contribute to the model of cancer caregivers’ needs in the 
information era.  
In Section II and its sub-sections, the relevant literature is 
reviewed on the aspects of dealing with cancer, information 
access on caregiving and cancer caregivers’ needs. The rest of 
the sections report the methods, analysis and findings, 
discussions, conclusion and future works of the research.

II.  LITERATURE REVIEW  
A. 
Dealing with cancer  
Annual cancer cases globally are expected to rise from 14 
million in 2012 to 22 million within the next 2 decades [26]. 
Cancer rates increase according to age [16].  A total of 18,219 
new cancer cases were diagnosed in 2007 and registered with 
the Malaysia National Cancer Registry, with 8,123 (44.6%) 
males and 10,096 (55.4%) females [16].  
Giving care to cancer patients is a challenging task for 
family caregivers [2] [20]. Informal caregivers are untrained 
[22]. This affects the quality of care in a patient-centred care 
model, especially when the care is carried out at home without 
the guidance or support from healthcare professionals. There 
is a need to increase the awareness of cancer care for 
caregivers.  
According to the President and Medical Director of 
National Cancer Society Malaysia (NCSM), Dr Saunthari 
Somasundaram, there is a need to provide awareness about the 
misconceptions and myths around cancer in Malaysia’s 
culture, and requires a ‘whole-of-society’ approach to tackle 
this issue [3] [10]. Prompt actions need to be taken on the 
misconception to decrease the risk of cancer, and detect cancer 
earlier for faster access to treatments. Reference [8] urged that 
the cancer care system in Malaysia requires an urgent reform 
as their study found that “…Out of the 2,312 deaths due to 
breast cancer, 2,048 (88%) were avoidable. Of these avoidable 
deaths, 1,167 (57%) were attributable to late stage 
presentation while 881 (43%) were due to lack of access to 
optimal treatment” (p.32). This statistic shows an under-
performing outcome of the cancer care system in Malaysia. 
Reference [8] further identified a Malaysian cancer divide 
between the rich and poor, mirroring the global cancer divide 
between rich and poor countries. They said, “…the huge 
number of avoidable deaths highlights the high cancer 
mortality rate among the deprived and the vast disparity in 
access to cancer care between the rich and poor within 
Malaysia.” (p.32)  
Dealing with the cancer demands both the management of 
the disease and its consequences emphasise that “cancer is a 
societal issue and is not confined to health” [28], which 
undoubtedly needs more attention in research. The social 
groups for cancer support could play a more proactive and 
important role to promote early treatment or disseminate 
accurate information about cancer.  There is also a need for 
palliative care to reduce caregivers’ burden [1] [4]. Compared 
to caregivers of other types of illnesses, cancer caregivers 
spend more hours providing care and the intensity of their 
caregiving is increasing due to the nature of active treatments. 
They are definitely in need of assistance and information to 
make the best decision regarding cancer treatments [11]. The 
length of time spent on caregiving determines the stress levels 
among the caregivers.  Access to caregiving support in the 
society or community is often limited in Asian countries. 
According to [28], support was mainly acquired through non-
governmental organizations (NGOs). Access to integrated 
care that extends from hospitals to the community is lacking, 
especially for healthcare needs, and trustable informational 
needs [28]. Access to information is mostly informal, 
influenced by many viewpoints, ranging from information 
provided by medical professionals, to information retrieved 
from the internet, friends, family, and social media sites that 
are often conditioned by the belief system grounded within the 
various cultural groups. These multiple views clearly pose a 
challenge for patients to make wise treatment decisions. It is 
the responsibility of the government, civil society and 
communities to support the process and education of patients 
and caregivers in dealing with cancer. Healthcare expenses 
have risen in recent years, hence cancer care is a financial 
burden for most households and the country [13]. Treatment 
costs in the first year after diagnosis can exceed 30% of 
household income in ASEAN countries [13] [28]. 
 
B. 
Information access on caregiving: A mixed 
blessing 
We acknowledge the idea of a Seamless Learning Model 
in the context of caregivers’ informal learning and information 
seeking pursuits, implemented seamlessly via the internet and 
social media, which impacts their public and private learning 
spaces.  Many activities of learning and information seeking, 
especially for caregivers are inherently informal, self-directed, 
independent, and critical as they are frequently influenced by 
online technologies and social media.  There are many 
internet-based information platforms for supporting and 
developing skills in caregiving and social care, for example 
[33] [34] [35]. It is also recognized as an authentic and just-
in-time learning (or training), especially for caregivers or 
informal caregivers who need some help and guidance during 
challenging times. 
Many countries have developed their national health 
websites and awareness programs to spread knowledge about 
healthcare and promote a healthy lifestyle by using the 
internet and social media platforms (e.g., Myhealth Portal and 
Infosihat for Malaysia; Singapore Health Promotion website). 
However, according to [2] (p. 627), the importance of these 
online media and technologies has not been clearly revealed 
in previous studies, especially on the information-seeking 
behavior of family caregivers. More research should be 
conducted to add literature on the information seeking 
behaviours among caregivers.  
Through seamless technologies, [21] propose the use of 
tools to design diverse learning experiences such as creating 
extended learning communities, linking people in real and 
virtual worlds (connectedness), providing expert knowledge 
based on demand, and to supporting learners in many ways. 
Reference [14] proposed a Seamless Learning Framework 
(Figure 1) to explain the learning environments or dimensions 
experienced by most of the learners. The learning space is no 
longer defined by a “physical / formal class” but by “learning 
unconstrained by scheduled class hours or specific locations” 
(p.156), thus promoting seamlessness, with informal learning 
and information access at learners’ fingertips. The seamless 
environment is labeled as “community” which comprises 
different categories of people such as teachers, experts and 
learners. The community has access to any relevant sources of 
knowledge through cognitive tools, within the dimension of 
10

time (anytime), space (anywhere), and artefacts (any learning 
artifacts / contents).  
 
 
Figure 1. A Seamless Learning Framework [14]. 
 
This concept can be applied to fulfil the informal learning 
needs of cancer caregivers since caregivers interact with all 
kinds of information and materials seamlessly.  They interact 
with internet support groups or cancer survivors through 
social media; and also conduct discovery learning about the 
disease from the cancer journeys shared by others. There are 
also professional cancer learning and sharing materials which 
can be accessed with ease.   
The internet is a ‘mixed blessing’ for the healthcare sector. 
Reference [25] suggested that public health information 
campaigns could be conducted using social media. This new 
means of communication, especially for prevention purposes, 
will complement other methods of communication. However, 
the challenge will be to adhere to the legal framework that 
preserves the quality of the healthcare information provided 
on the internet.   
Consumption of online healthcare information and 
services is increasing [15] and has empowered caregivers (and 
patients) to enhance their health literacy for improved decision 
making [9].  
Reference 
[18] 
conducted 
a 
quasi-experimental 
effectiveness study of a new mobile learning tool for cancer 
education and the results showed that the application has 
significantly increased cancer prevention knowledge among 
the users. However, the main drawback of online healthcare 
information is its credibility. Diagnostic information online is 
sometimes used to confront doctors [12] [15]. Reference [15] 
suggested that users, such as caregivers must critically analyze 
and select information posted on YouTube in order to make 
effective healthcare decisions.  
A. Cancer caregivers’ need 
Reference [19] - Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (2013) 
listed the challenges of caregiving:  caring for themselves 
(self-care), supporting and caring patients emotionally and  
physically,  maintaining the home environment for patients, 
gathering information, helping with decision-making on 
cancer care or treatment, arranging patients’ hospital visits 
and patient’s financial support. These tasks are complex 
especially for the new caregivers. Roles of family caregivers 
are multifaceted, and adequate support is required for them 
(Glajchen 2004 in [2]). According to Wingate and Lackey 
cited in [2], family caregivers need knowledge, information, 
or understanding that can be gained through education, 
experience, study, or through explanations by qualified cancer 
specialists. Reference [2] reported a qualitative study that 
discloses the information needs of cancer family caregivers 
are varied along the cancer journey, and they used diverse 
information sources, including healthcare professionals, 
hospital booklets, interpersonal networks, besides the internet, 
mass media, and books - to satisfy their needs. Her study 
found that demographic variables of caregivers (such as 
gender, age, level of education, socioeconomic status and 
culture) affected their information-seeking behaviors.  
Reference [6] measured the psychometric properties to 
capture the multidimensional supportive care needs of cancer 
caregivers. The instrument used was given to 547 cancer 
caregivers. Psychometric analyses found four dimensions of 
need: healthcare service, psychological and emotional, work 
and social, and information. Individuals with anxiety and 
depression were more likely to report at least one unmet 
moderate or high need in comparison to non-anxious 
participants. Younger participants experienced at least one 
unmet moderate or high need in the area of “psychological and 
emotional”, and “work and social”, as compared to the older 
participants. Reference [6] suggested the findings can be used 
to prioritize healthcare resources and tailor supportive cancer 
care service accordingly.  
In summary, the study intends to explore the properties or 
dimensions of needs faced by caregivers, especially the four 
dimensions namely healthcare service, psychological & 
emotional, work & social, and the last dimension is the 
information need. Additional dimension of learning need is 
also an interest of the current study. 
III.  METHODS 
A survey was conducted in a hospital with two cancer 
specialist clinics run by NCSM, an NGO for cancer awareness 
and cancer care. Permission was granted from NCSM in order 
to conduct this study at the waiting lounge of the two cancer 
clinics. The population of the study involved all cancer clinics 
run by NCSM across the country. However, only two cancer 
clinics were purposively selected to participate in this study 
due to their strategic location in the center of Kuala Lumpur 
city. A total of 84 participants were involved in this study. 
Majority of them were Malaysian Chinese. This is because the 
hospital is traditionally or historically relevant and popular 
among Malaysian Chinese community. In addition, the 
Chinese in Malaysia have the higher lifetime risk for cancer 
compared to Indians and Malays. Chinese is the second largest 
ethnic group in Malaysia who form approximately 24 percent 
of the Malaysian population [16].  
Previous reports of the National Cancer Registry (NCR) 
[16] have revealed that cancer seems to be predominant 
among Chinese as compared to Malay and Indian. “The Age-
Standard-Rate (ASR -  a measure for cancer incident) for 
Chinese male was 111.9 per 100,000 and for Chinese females 
was 115.0 per 100,000 while for Indian male was 68.2 per 
100,000 populations and for females was 99.9 per 100,000 
populations.” [16] (p. 23). According to the same report, “the 
11

GLOBAL HEALTH 2020 : The Ninth International Conference on Global Health Challenges

ASR among Malay male and female were 66.9 per 100,000 
and 79.0 per 100,000 populations respectively.” (p. 23)  
A. Instrument 
The instrument of the survey was adapted from [6] to 
study needs in the context of informal learning environments. 
Items related to this context were added to the instrument. The 
instrument was then reviewed by three experts in the area of 
wellness and preventive medicine (Expert 1), management of 
a cancer wellness center (Expert 2), and healthcare 
informatics (Expert 3) respectively. Items were reviewed; 
some were dropped and merged because of overlapping 
meaning; some were rephrased for the suitability of local 
caregivers in Malay and English. 
The items were analysed using factor analysis. Factors on 
the needs of cancer caregivers were then identified in the 
analysis. There are two key sections of the questionnaire: 
Section A – Profiles, caregiving experiences and online 
activities behavior, Section B – Needs measured by Likert-
type items, adapted mostly from [6], that is ranging from “1 
denotes no need (either satisfy or non-applicable), 2 denotes 
low need, 3 denotes moderate need, and 4 denotes high need”.   
B. Procedures 
The caregivers in the waiting lounge were invited to 
participate in the survey. The researcher assistant took turns 
to be in the waiting area for two or three days in a week for 
two months. The data collection process stopped when there 
were very few new caregivers in the waiting area.  
Caregivers who agreed to participate in this study were 
asked to sign a participation consent form. They were briefed 
that at any time, they could freely withdraw from the study. 
Some caregivers were assisted by the researchers to clarify the 
meaning of items. Overall, the total number of usable 
responses was 84 out of 91; seven responses were not included 
due to incompleteness. 
IV. ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS 
There are two main stages of factor analysis conducted for 
extracting and determining factors in this study. Firstly, factor 
extraction was performed focusing on making initial decisions 
about the number of factors that primarily satisfies a set of 
measured variables based on the Principal Component 
Analysis (PCA).  Secondly, factor rotation was conducted to 
ensure the underlying factors were more interpretable. 
A. Description of the demographic information 
More than half were females, the majority of them were 
Chinese (83%) with their religion Buddhism or Taoism, 
middle income or lower (77%), holding diploma and above 
(59%), aged more than 30 years old (73%). More than half of 
them (62%) have been caregiving for 6 months and above, 
mostly the care recipients were affected with female related 
cancer (54%). The caregivers were quite active online to look 
for health information and connection with others via online. 
About 60% of them were in this category.  
 
B. The steps of factor analysis 
Factor analysis was employed to establish factors of needs, 
through extracting factors and factor rotation procedures as 
recommended [24]. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is 
chosen because it is a common method for exploring loadings 
of survey items into the components and it is frequently used 
in research of education and psychology [23] [24]. The PCA 
allows transformation of a set of inter-correlated variables into 
specific components or factors to extract distinct factors from 
the variables in the analysis which involves reduction of 
dimensionality among the variables. In the process of 
extracting factors, suitability of data was tested, and hence 
actual component extraction was retrieved for getting a 
smaller number of items to best represent relationships among 
those items.  
1) 
Stage one: Extracting factor 
In PCA, the suitability and adequacy of data in terms of 
variability of data were tested based on Kaiser-Mayer-Olkin 
(KMO) measure of sampling adequacy. In this study the value 
of KMO is 0.842 which is greater than 0.7 which indicates a 
very good condition to proceed with the factor analysis. In 
normal practice, the value of KMO should be larger than 0.5 
for achieving a condition of satisfactory.   
On the other hand, the Bartlett Test of Sphericity takes 
consideration of testing of correlations among the variables. 
This value is referred to ensure that there are sufficient 
correlations among the variables. The sufficiency of 
correlations is indicated in the associated probability in the 
chi-square. If the p value of the associated chi-square statistic 
is less than 0.5, it shows the items are sufficiently correlated 
for further analysis in PCA. In this study, the results of Bartlett 
Test of Sphericity show that value of chi-square is 2470 with 
df=703 and p-value < 0.05, indicating that the variables were 
sufficiently correlated to form the specific components and 
factors.

The number of extracted factors or components is 
determined from variances explained among the variables. 
The factor extraction also depends on eigenvalues. An 
eigenvalue is the variance or the variables accounted for by a 
factor. The six components which have eigenvalues more than 
one (namely between 1.187 ≈1.2 to 16.714≈16.72) were 
selected into the factors. These values provide a guide to 
ensure that the variances of components are all contributed 
from more than a single observed variable (item). 
In this study (Table 2, refer to the last page of this paper), 
the examination of the total variance explained by the 
components extracted were displayed in Table 2: An analysis 
of the total variance explained by components (refer to the last 
page of this article). Component 1 shows a very high 
12

GLOBAL HEALTH 2020 : The Ninth International Conference on Global Health Challenges

eigenvalue and a high percentage (14.57%) of variance 
explained. Component 2 until component 6 has the total 
variance explained value of greater than 3% (both for Initial 
Eigenvalue column and other columns) were chosen.  Other 
components have lower value of initial eigenvalue, which are 
lower than 1.187 (or its initial percentage of variance 
explained, which are lower than 3%, i.e. the bold number) are 
not planned to be selected for the next step of analysis. Thus, 
the six factors are explained with the total variance 64.1%. 
An examination of the scree plot of the Eigenvalue versus 
Component has shown a clear “knee point / elbow”, that is at 
the point of component number of 6 (refer to Figure 2). Other 
components have lower eigenvalue, which will not be 
considered for the next step.  
 
Figure 2. Scree plot showing the elbow at the point of the sixth component 
at the value of Eigenvalue >= 1. 
 
2) 
Stage two: Factor rotation 
The final step of PCA is to examine the factor loadings of 
each item in relation to the first six components. The factor 
loading presents the results of component rotations and 
interpretation of components.  
The factor rotation method used in the analysis is Varimax 
rotation, a method used frequently in social science and 
psychological study. A check on oblique based rotation has 
also produced the similar set of items according to these 
components. In determining the factors from the factor 
loading, the loading of absolutes 0.4 is used as a cut-off value 
[7]. For practical significance, loadings of absolutes0.4 and 
above, but less than 0.5 are considered just enough to be 
significant. Loadings above 0.5 indicate highly significant. On 
the other hand, if the factor loading difference between two 
factors across a particular item is less than 0.2, the item should 
be dropped. 
Table 3 is a matrix table showing the rotated components 
and their related items shows the loading value of each item 
which are greater than 0.4 in relation to the six identified 
components in the factor extraction, and other components 
(i.e. Components 7 and 8).  The bold loading values are the 
selected items according to components; items which loading 
values are italicized due to the difference of loading values 
less than 0.2 were discarded (i.e. Item 18, 35, 26, 33 and 32). 
Components 7 and 8 were also not considered for 
interpretation.

The bold items were retained and used for interpreting the 
need factor. In total, there were 29 items to explain six (6) 
components of need factors.  Table 3 shows a matrix of the 
rotated components and their related items. A total of 9 items 
were discarded, and not included for further interpretation of 
the construct or need factors.  
The internal reliability analyses with the Cronbach’s 
Alpha values for the items emerged for six components / 
factors are stated in column 3 of Table 4: Factors with items 
loaded to the six-factor of needs (Refer to the last page of this 
paper). All factors have the alpha values greater than 0.7 (α > 
0.7), indicating an acceptable internal reliability measure for 
the factors. 
Collectively, none of the factors scored ‘high need’ and 
there is no factor indicating “no need”. The need for 
communication is at the level of ‘moderate’. Other need 
factors such as personal well-being, basic healthcare, access 
to information, coping with change are between ‘low’ to 
‘moderate need’. The need for learning through online 
information and connection is ‘low’.  
V.  DISCUSSION 
Six-factor of needs were identified in this study; they are: 
 
 
Factor 1 (F1): Regular communication for better 
understanding and balance of needs between caregivers 
and person with cancer;  
 
Factor 2 (F2): Personal well-being especially on the 
control of emotion, communication and spiritual beliefs 
mainly on the quest of meaning of life and the faith in the 
healing process;  
 
Factor 3 (F3):  Basic healthcare, counselling and service;  
 
Factor 4 (F4): Access to information related to cancer or 
patient care information and Services;  
 
Factor 5 (F5): Coping with change especially the change 
of life routine and perspective on life;  
 
Factor 6 (F6): Learning through online information and 
connection with others on cancer care. 
 
These factors are aligned with the study conducted by [6] 
which proposed four domains of need, namely Healthcare 
Service (F3 of the current study), Psychological and 
Emotional (F2 and F5 of the current study), and Information 
(F4 of the current study). The last factor by [6] is Work and 
Social Needs. This factor was not emerged in the current 
study.   
A. The emergence of communication as a more important 
need factor 
The current study has revealed that Communication (F1) 
is a more important need factor. Communication shows the 
highest percentage of variance explained. Its mean value also 
shows the highest need compared to other factors.  
Reference [5] argued that, “…effective communication 
for cancer patients and/or caregivers can meet information 
needs, reduce caregiver burden, improve physical and mental 
health, and promote intimacy.” (p. 1) According to their 
critical review findings, the communication needs identified 
are multifaceted nature of cancer patients and/or caregivers in 
terms of communication target, content, style, timing, and 
preferences. For example, communication targets included 
health professionals, peers, caregivers, and patients. 
Communication content included illness-related, emotional 
support, daily life, sexuality, death, and a way to communicate 
with health professionals [5].  
Other major contributing factors of need are Psychological 
and Emotional (F2) and Healthcare Service (F3). By taking 
emotional support as an example, evidence shows that both 
negative 
and 
positive 
emotions 
are 
important 
in 
communication [32].  A study found that cancer patients who 
expressed negative emotions and received an empathetic 
response from their oncologist perceived communication as 
being more favorable [31]. 
Reference [30] found the caregivers’ needs which are: 1) 
accessing and understanding the information, 2) relationship 
with healthcare providers, 3) relationship with the care 
recipient, 4) managing challenges of caregiving and support 
systems. Other areas of need mentioned by [30] are basic 
healthcare, communication with care recipients, and support 
systems; these needs are also aligned with the findings of the 
current study.  
According to [30], caregivers’ health literacy is 
multidimensional. The current study has also found the need 
for multidimensional support for caregivers and their personal 
well-being. Support is not just on communication or personal 
well-being, but also involves other needs such as health and 
physical care, finance, dietary, learning and access to 
information and supportive people. They need guidance in 
communication for their preferred way or form of counselling 
methods. They need a credible source of information through 
consultation with their healthcare professionals. Caregivers 
need to communicate with the cancer patient and their family 
members. 
One factor found is the need for coping with change 
especially the changes to the life routine and perspectives on 
life. The study in [27] also identified the need for coping with 
change. In their study, they observed that detection of “cancer 
creates the context for the caregiver’s relationships (with 
patient, and the healthcare system), and the cognitive, 
behavioral, affective, and spiritual responses” (p.775); the 
caregiver’s prior experiences and social support network 
influence the caregivers’ perception towards the diagnosis,

relationships, and personal responses. Mainly there is a need 
to cope with change in relationships among key parties who 
are involved in a patient-centered healthcare system, such as 
the healthcare providers, doctors, friends and relatives and the 
communities. 
B. 
Learning need through online information and 
connection 
The current study identified “learning through online 
information and social connection” as an emerging factor of 
need. Some input from open feedback indicated that online 
technologies can be used for seeking “reliable” information 
about cancer care, healthy lifestyle and diet. However, it is at 
the lower need level compared to other needs which are more 
critical during the caregiving period. This could be due to the 
support by doctors and healthcare teams to provide reliable 
information that are able to meet their needs.  
Overall implication is that the present study has identified 
six-factor needs with communication need being perceived 
higher among all factors. The authors discovered that 
communication need is multifaceted, with communication 
target, content, style and timing should come at the right and 
in guided ways. Effective communication with the person 
with cancer, the other family members and healthcare 
professionals should be considered the aspect influencing 
caregivers’ well-being. Usually, the content and style of 
communication are often neglected. This study found the 
various aspects of communication to be complex but 
interesting for future research.  
C. 
Limitations 
The study has sampling limitations, the caregivers are 
mostly from one ethnicity and the number of respondents is 
less than 85. Most of the samples are from the middle income 
group, which biases towards the needs for financial and 
healthcare. The convenience sample for this study comes from 
one hospital. The type of cancer patients and their caregivers 
were selected purposively from cancer clinics in a hospital, 
they were affected by different kinds of cancer. Hence, it is 
difficult to gather data of different samples based on different 
cancer types due to sampling limitations.  All these limitations 
are acknowledged. Future research is proposed to incorporate 
more participating hospitals and caregivers.  
VI.  CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The study provides a systematic approach of identifying 
needs of cancer caregivers. The factors derived from this study 
have not only highlighted the common domain of needs such 
as Basic Healthcare, Access to Information, Psychological 
and Emotional (personal well-being, coping with change), but 
also encountered other need factors, namely communication 
and learning need which are corroborated with some scholar 
works such as [5], Yuen et al.’s works [29] [30] and the works 
by [14] respectively. These factors should also be considered 
for any policy decisions or training modules for caregivers, in 
line with the importance of a seamless learning model in 
health education. The need factors found are proposed to be 
incorporated into the patient-centered healthcare system for 
creating a more comprehensive healthcare model in cancer 
care involving the support towards the needs of caregivers.  
This study can be a source of information or as an added 
literature for cancer caregivers’ needs.  
Future directions of this research will consider to study 
further on one or two aspects of well-being dimensions, for 
example on trustable information need in decision making. 
Future research will also consider the different duties of 
caregivers and the level of quality of treatment received by 
patients. These variables may influence the requirement of 
needs by caregivers and subsequently affect the quality of life 
for the family.
