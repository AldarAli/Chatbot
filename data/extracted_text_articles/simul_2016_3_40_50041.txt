Abstract—A pitch-roll simulator platform has been designed and
built for the validation and analysis of control systems algorithms
in vehicle dynamics. The system consists of a real time industrial
computer, and an instrumented three degrees of freedom plat-
form. A motion cueing algorithm has the function of translating
the movement of a vehicle to the platform, moving three rotary
actuators, while satisfying all boundaries. A set of encoders feeds
back the actuators angle. Two control strategies has been designed
and tested through simulation and experiments. Results show that
a simple control scheme allows the driver assess the pitch and
roll, however, a better control scheme is needed for vehicle design
purposes.

INTRODUCTION
Driving simulators are found in several areas of application:
entertainment, research and advanced training. These simu-
lators deliver motion cues to the driver. The ﬁdelity of the
cues depends on the degrees of freedom. These systems are
called also motion cueing systems. Motion cueing systems in
driving simulators join the physical motion of the simulated
vehicle with the real-time image generation system. It allows
the drivers to perceive and control their vehicle motion [1] as
if he were inside the vehicle. Motion simulators have been a
topic of great interest in last years [1]-[9]. The applications
of interest are to test Advanced Driver Assistance Systems
(ADAS), In-Vehicle Information Systems (IVIS), and the effects
of noise and vibrations on driver performance [6].
The automotive industry in Mexico has a boom in manu-
facturing and investment [10]. However, important challenges
remain for the future, such as the development of more
research and development centers, local design and validation
for automotive components [10][11]. Some efforts are being
done between universities and automotive industry [12][13].
This research is under the goal of having better capabilities
for the development of new technology in partnership between
mexican universities and companies.

Motion cueing allows the simulator driver to feel inside a
vehicle in motion. The realism of simulation depends strongly
on the ﬁdelity of the motion platform and the motion percep-
tion by the human driver [3]. The human vestibular system
located in head is found to be dominant in human motion
sensation. It senses the rotational and linear motions, more
details on [14]. Rendering vehicle motion cues in a driving
simulator is possible within a small displacement envelope. Its
physical validity is limited to the mid-frequency range, but its
perceptual validity may be extended in the low frequencies by
tilt coordination techniques [1].
A driving simulator typically consists of a seat, a vehicle
dynamics model interacting with a driver through a steering
wheel and pedals with haptic feedback, a sound feedback, a
set of screens with a visual engine reproducing the vehicle
dynamics results of the simulator’s driver manoeuvre, and,
in some cases, translational and rotational actuators for the
motion cueing system. The driving simulators are mainly
classiﬁed by the ﬁdelity of the simulation level and its ap-
plication. The simulation ﬁdelity cllassiﬁcation corresponds
to low-level, mid-level and high-level ﬁdelity. At a low-level
simulator, the driver sits in a car seat, which is ﬁxed to
the ground. The driver looks at a screen, which is ﬁxed to
the ground too. The screen is designed such that the view
angle is as large as possible. The driver manipulates a set
of driving controls such accelerating, braking and steering
wheel in order to receive visual cues corresponding to the
actual driving situation. In some types of applications, it is
desirable to provide a motion and haptic restitution to improve
the simulation ﬁdelity. Therefore, the driving simulators use
a moving platform to restitute, in a limited and constrained
workspace, a sufﬁcient sensation of movement as closely as
the one sensed in a real vehicle [1][2][15][16]. Low level
simulators can include longitudinal axis motion in one axis
while the mid and high level simulators include more motion
axis, a detailed state of the art can be found in [9]. The main
applications are Entertainment (E), Training (T) and Research
(R). Table II shows a complementary summary.

A three Degree of Freedom system is designed to have a
rotation about the x, y, and z axes and it allows to simulate
main vehicle dynamics variables. This system causes the
sensation of acceleration through rotation around these three
axes, maintaining a tilt angle (typically to a 45 degrees angle)
and it uses the gravity. The tilt limitation in this system
prevents to create an acceleration sensation over 0.707gs [9].
This research is focused in a 3DoF driving simulator.

Figure 1. Washout ﬁltering approach for motion cueing systems.
The control algorithm for motion cueing systems is called
washout ﬁltering with classical, optimal and predictive ap-
proaches [1][14], proportional-integral-derivative washout ﬁl-
tering [2], and optimal and model predictive control [4][8]
among others. However, the classical washout ﬁltering is the
most common because of it is implementation simplicity and
fair simulation results [9], Figure 1. The classical washout
ﬁltering consists of a combination of high-pass and low-pass
ﬁlters. Commonly, the parameters of these ﬁlters are empir-
ically determined. Its inputs are vehicle-speciﬁc longitudinal
accelerations and angular rate and expressed in vehicle-body-
ﬁxed frame. Acceleration (angular rate) is high-pass ﬁltered,
and yields the simulator translations (rotations). To simulate
the motion platform tilt, a tilt coordination algorithm supplies
the low-frequency component of acceleration for rotation cal-
culation.

VEHICLE DYNAMICS SIMULATOR
The Vehicle Dynamics Simulator (VDS) consists of a real
time vehicle dynamics model system interacting with a driver
through a steering wheel, acceleration, brake and clutch pedals,
speed control, a set of three ﬂat screens and a set of speakers.
The real time vehicle dynamics model simulation system
consists of the Dynacar system [17], which is a low level
driving simulator, and a three Degrees of Freedom (3DoF)
platform, Figure 2.

the angle measurement of the crank. The upper base has one
sensor: a gyroscope. It is located under the driver seat. A
Real Time (RT) computer (same as for the Dynacar system)
reads the gyroscope and encoder signals. A set of reference
signals is delivered from the selected vehicle dynamics model
and compared with the measurements. The control algorithm
computes in the RT computer the commands for each electric
drive.

Figure 6. Control system proposal: a) physical-limits-based, b) washout

The conditional control is a physical-limits-based control
using a continuous comparison of signals with a priori deﬁned
thresholds. The Revolution Per Minute (RPM) of each AC
motor is constant. The signal conditioning consists of: a)
processing of sensor signals in order to obtain crankshaft
angles, b) acquisition from Dynacar of roll and proportional
values of throttle and brake pedals, and c) digital outputs
activation according to controller output. The controller inputs
are roll, proportional brake, proportional throttle, and degrees
of each motor shaft. The controller outputs are sixteen digital
outputs whose control three motor conditions in the AC drive
are: move forward, move reverse and stand by. When the driver
accelerates/brakes the vehicle, the front motor ups/down the
platform. The control system emulates proportionally the pitch
motion. Regarding to the roll platform emulation, when the
simulated roll (reference) from Dynacar is between a priori
interval, the platform moves in a direction according to the
sign of the reference until a threshold is reached. Then the
platform stops and the control system waits until the change
of sign in the reference signal. This sequence is repeated during
all VDS driving operation. For a higher speed platform motion,
the RPM in each motor must be set according to the driver
assessment.
The washout ﬁltering with feedback control consists of

a physical limits validation including backslash exclusion, a
classical washout ﬁltering algorithm, Figure 1, an estimation
algorithm of pitch and roll, and a proportional gain. The
physical limits validation is continuous in each sample time,
however the algorithm adds an offset to the controller output
voltage in order to avoid the inertia under two system con-
ditions: stand by and low speed of the motor. The controller
computes the RPM of each AC motor and the sense of rotation
around the zero angle. The signal conditioning consists of:
a) processing of sensor signals in order to obtain crankshaft
angles, b) acquisition from Dynacar of longitudinal and lateral
accelerations, c) conversion from pulses to angle for each
motor shaft, and d) conditioning of controller output in order
to obtain the AC motor drive input voltage (proportional to
the revolution per minute of the AC motor). The controller
inputs are longitudinal and lateral accelerations from Dynacar,
angular speeds for x, y, and z from gyroscope, and each
motor shaft angle obtained from encoders. The outputs of the
controller are three: voltage command for each AC motor drive.
The command has a range with an offset. The magnitude of
this signal indicates RPMs of the AC motor. Over the offset
the voltage indicates forward direction, below the offset it
indicates reverse direction. The control system emulates both
movements: the pitch and the roll. The estimated pitch (ˆθ)
is subtracted from the simulated pitch (output of washout
ﬁltering, ˜θ) conforming a pitch error signal (θd). Then θd is
validated through a physical limits algorithm and multiplied by
a gain (P controller) and it becomes controller output uθ as
the command voltage to the AC motor drive. The same control
sequence applies for roll control.
The power driving (using any control algorithm) converts
the controller outputs in mechanical motion.
V.
METHODOLOGY
The design and validation of the control system in the VDS
consist of open loop and closed loop tests. The computation
of parameters and the programming of the control algorithm
are done with Matlab®. The methodology consists of:
A. Design of Experiments
The main goal is to deﬁne the frequency response of the
platform from the manipulation variable to the pitch and roll
motions in open loop. A set of experiments is applied to
the platform in order to analyze the input-output relationship.
There are two experiments: (a) driver test under random
scenario, and (b) sinusoidal test for actuator characterization.
1)
The driver test under random scenario consists of us-
ing the Dynacar system with an speciﬁc driver, track
and vehicle in order to get the frequency response
of the simulated roll and pitch of the given vehicle
model. The experiment considers ten replicates. The
peak value of the roll (φmax) and pitch (θmax) as
well as the cut-off frequency fcut off for each one
are the experiment outputs computed with the Fast
Fourier Transform, Figure 7.
2)
The sinusoidal test for actuator characterization
explores the frequency response according to the
bandwidth and magnitudes obtained from the ﬁrst
experiment. Each experiment consists of a sinusoidal
excitation of the electric drive manipulation in order

to observe the encoders and the pitch (roll) responses
with a constant frequency and amplitude. The am-
plitude remains constant and at least ﬁve cycles are
completed ending the experiment. Then the frequency
is incremented and the experiment repeated. This
DoE ends when the cut-off frequency is reached. The
magnitude of roll and pitch at the given frequency
of each experiment allows to build a pseudo-bode
diagram. This DoE consists of a total of three repli-
cates, Figure 8. The function of this experiment is
to obtain the frequency response of the motor under
controlled inputs in the operation domain according
to the vehicle model. The control algorithms will take
into account this information for its design and to
consider these parameters for a safety operation.

B. Domain Operation and Design of Control Algorithms
The results of the DoE will allow to specify domain
operation of the VDS as well as the parameters for the control
algorithm. The domain operation consists of the electrical and
mechanical thresholds of the 3DoF platform . The electrical
thresholds consider the maximum frequency and amplitude to
be applied as input to the AC motor drive, The mechanical
thresholds consist of the initial motor shaft positions as well
as the angle intervals of safe motion for each crankshaft
mechanism.
C. Control Algorithms Performance
The driver test under random scenario is repeated with
the VDS: Dynacar and the 3DoF platform simulating the pitch
and roll vehicle motion. The goal is to evaluate the closed loop
performance under the two control modes. The assessment of
the driver and qualitative plots are the results of this test.
VI.
RESULTS
The results of the control algorithm implementation are
presented.
The driver test under random scenario shows the frequency
domain to explore is 0.5-2.0 Hz according to the pitch and
roll frequency content. This bandwidth has been obtained from
data analysis from DynaCar simulated variables. The ranges
of the simulated pitch and roll are ˜θ = {−5, 5} degrees and
˜φ = {−8, 8} degrees.
The sinusoidal test for actuator characterization shows a
linear relation between shaft speed and drive command, Figure

to 60 Hz of AC voltage frequency in the AC drive. So, this is
the maximum speed.
A comparison of the command voltage versus motor an-
gular speed versus initial angle in the motor shaft shows
non linearities on the speed regarding low command voltage,

requires 5 V in order to stop motor. Any voltage over/below

The design of the conditional control algorithm utilizes
thresholds for roll from Dynacar, two absolute encoders, and
throttle and brake pedals. Pitch and roll functional values are
between deﬁned parameters, greater than 0.8 or less than -
0.8 in the case of the roll. In the case of the pitch, it was
established the minimum of acceleration greater than 0.5 and
the brake greater than 0.4. In the case of pitch, it has to be
in the limit of 10 degrees and in the case of roll, the limit is
between 0-5 degrees.
The design of the washout ﬁltering with feedback control
considers the design of low and high pass digital ﬁlters
using Matlab, Figure 12. The output of this algorithm is the
simulated variables pitch and roll. Classically these signals
will be converted to voltage and then feed to the AC motor
drives. However, this control system considers the feedback
of measured pitch and roll. In order to translate the rotational

angular speeds delivered for gyroscope using the proposal from
[18]. An offset of ± 0.7 is added to each controller output in
order to avoid the dead zone of the command versus the shaft
speed response. The proportional control gain multiplies the
controller output. The complete scheme shows the computation

Both approaches move the platform in the right direction.
The frequency response is limited by the frequency response of
the AC motors and its manipulation. The conditional control
performs an inertial control where the motion is felt by the
user. However, the ﬁnal application of this control can not be
training due to the lack of ﬁdelity of the pitch and roll platform
simulation. The delay of this algorithm is enough to be notice
by the user. However, its simplicity allows to tune the control
system with thresholds under constant motor speed, see second
column of Figure 14.
Regarding to the washout ﬁltering with feedback control it
can be seen a high ﬁdelity in the platform motion regarding the
simulation in Dynacar. The control is continuous and tracks
the reference delivered by the washout ﬁltering algorithm. The
user experiences a real time motion synchronized with the
visual engine of Dynacar. This experience is a added value that
allows to use this control mode for training and for evaluation
other vehicle systems in the full user experience. The delay
is considerably small when compared with the one of the
conditional control, see ﬁrst column of Figure 14.

CONCLUSION
The control system of a VDSwith three degrees of freedom
motion platform has been developed. It uses the positions of
each motor shaft and the angular speeds of a gyroscope. The
variables of interest are the pitch and roll and simulated in real
time according to the DynaCar software. Two control schemes
have been validated. Despite the conﬁguration of hardware
is commercially available by several companies, the control
algorithms always are the challenge. This platform has a low
cost in the hardware because the use of AC motors and it can
be integrated to another vehicle model simulation using the
proposed algorithms. The results show it is possible to use
this AC motors for motion control in this application.
