Abstract— There is a controversial debate about the effects of 
the promotion of renewable energy and electric power sector 
reforms on electricity prices. This paper explores the impact of 
renewable energies and other environmental and economic 
variables on electricity prices in Spain. However, information 
available regarding renewable energies is scarce so when 
trying to estimate the electricity price model through 
regression procedures a dimensionality problem arises. 
Therefore we use a Maximum Entropy Econometric approach 
which allows estimating models when information is limited.

 INTRODUCTION  
The promotion of renewable energies is a key concept in 
European Union by environmental and economic reasons. 
This type of energy contributes to obtain the objectives 
established by Kyoto Protocol. Besides, it allows the 
obtaining of various social-economic advantages, such as the 
diversification of energy offer, the improvement of 
opportunities in regional and local development, and the 
creation of a domestic industry and employment1. 
In contrast, the renewable energies also have some costs 
related to the adjustments in production, prices and 
transportation systems. 
 
Regarding the price effects, since the majority of 
renewable energy technologies are not profitable at current 
energy prices, they are expected to increase energy costs. In 
order to make them profitable, there are several public 
supports. The support scheme used in Spain is the feed-in 
tariffs. This system requires that distributors acquire, in first 
place, the energy produced by renewable energy sources at a 
determined price established by regulator during a specific 
time period (generally, around fifteen years). From generator 
view point, it operates as a subsidy. 
                                                           
1 Several studies have reviewed the effects of the introduction of renewable 
energies at EU country levels. This is the case of [1] for United Kingdom 
or [2] for Germany.  Other studies as [3] have analysed the macroeconomic 
impact of renewable energy at local level. 
In addition, environmental costs related to CO2 emissions 
in electricity generation in general have a significant 
negative effect on energy costs as a CO2 emission trading 
scheme exists [4].The substitution of conventional electricity 
generation by renewable energies could reduce the cost 
derived from environmental emissions and the electricity 
price. Besides, it is necessary to consider that a higher use of 
renewable energies could reduce even the final electricity 
prices because its promotion stimulates the generation of 
renewable energy which is characterized by variable costs 
lower than fossil conventional technologies [5].  
Therefore the cost disadvantage of renewable compared 
to conventional energies is crucially dependent on future 
prices of energies used in power plants as well as on the 
amount of CO2 emission permits. The expansion of 
renewable energy could affect electricity price. 
 
Moreover, the regulatory reforms in the Spanish 
Electricity Market also could have its effect on electricity 
prices. In fact, the introduction of liberalization in the 
retailing activity could reduce electricity price as a 
consequence of the competition system. 
Since in Spain there is a part of the electricity price paid 
by the government, it could be interesting to study the effect 
of the general economic activity on electricity price. 
Therefore, there are several variables affecting electricity 
prices.  
 
In this paper, we explore the effect of electricity 
generated by renewable energy and other factors (matrix X) 
on household electricity prices in Spain (y). Our data sets are 
provided by Eurostat during the period 2002-2007. 
During the last years, several studies have been 
developed using cross-sectional or temporal data to explain 
the effect of several variables on electricity price. Some of 
them include explanatory variables related to energy use or 
technology [6][7] or market liberalization [8][9]. Our 
empirical study takes into consideration all effects together. 
Traditional parametric methods require an elevated 
sample size for the efficient estimation of the coefficients in

techniques requires that the number of observations was 
superior to the number of independent variables.  
However, information available regarding renewable 
energy and electricity market liberalization is scarce so it 
limits the sample date. Therefore, when trying to estimate the 
electricity price model through regression procedures a 
dimensionality problem arises. 
 
As an alternative to estimate the model, when a 
dimensionality problem arises, we propose a Maximum 
Entropy Econometric approach, which has been defined by 
[10] as “a sub-discipline of processing information from 
limited and noisy data with minimal a priori information on 
the data-generating process”. This approach has its roots in 
Information Theory and builds on the entropy-information 
measure [11], the classical maximum entropy principle 
[12],[13], which was developed to recover information from 
underdetermined models, and the Generalized Maximum 
Entropy Theory [14]. 
The maximum entropy Econometric approach was 
developed to estimate models using limited or incomplete 
data. Therefore, we investigate its possibilities in the 
estimation of household electricity price. 
 
This paper is divided into two more sections. The first of 
them (Section II) makes a revision of the functioning of 
Spanish electricity market and analyzes the important role of 
the renewable energies in such electricity system. 
The next section (Section III) assesses the problem of 
electricity price model estimation through regression-based 
procedures when a dimensionality problem arises. It also 
contains a brief description of some of the uncertainty 
measures provided by the Information Theory and the 
requirements to optimize their values. Furthermore, we 
describe the Maximum Entropy Econometric procedure in 
order to estimate the model.  Moreover, we present an 
empirical application of the proposed method to Spanish 
household electricity prices over the period 2002-2007. 
Some concluding remarks complete the paper. 
II. 
ELECTRICY MARKET IN SPAIN. AN OVERVIEW  
In this section, we analyze the characteristics of the 
Spanish electricity market after the liberalization process and 
the role of renewable energies in such market. 
Liberalization of the Spanish electricity system is begun 
with Law 54/1997 [15] where the key element is the creation 
of the wholesale electricity market (pool2). 
In daily market, electricity companies determine, for 
every generation unit, the offered amount and price. In 
parallel, electricity consumers establish the demanded 
                                                           
2  Spanish electricity market is structured on various markets where 
electricity demand and offer is adjusted. Daily market is emphasized 
because the electricity price shaped in it supposes around the 89% of final 
electricity price. In this market, electricity energy is negotiated for every 
one of the twenty-four hours of the following day. 
 
amount and the maximum prices that they are ready to pay. 
In this context, the use of an algorithm based on auctions of 
first price establishes the wholesale electricity price (see 
Fig.1).  
On the other hand, liberalization of Spanish electricity 
system entails too the creation of a retail electricity market. 
In this market, consumer can choose distributor freely and 
negotiate with them the price and the conditions of the 
electricity supply. Therefore, consumers have two options of 
supply: regulated (by means of the payment of a “integral” 
tariff where all supply costs are included) and competitive or 
of market (by means of the payment of an access tariff to the 
networks plus the energy contracting costs and other 
services). 
Regarding the role of renewable energies in the 
electricity generation the European Community Directives 
2001/77/EC [16] and 2009/28/EC [17] give freedom to each 
member state for choosing the support mechanism of 
renewable resources.  
 
In the case of Spain, the current legal framework of 
renewable energy is the Royal Decree 661/2007 [18] whose 
aim is to minimize the environmental impact of electricity 
supply. Like that, the basic instrument introduced is feed-in 
tariff. This mechanism entails two possibilities in the sale of 
electricity, generated by renewable energies: a) to sell the 
electricity to distributor at a regulated tariff or b) to sell the 
electricity directly in the market where the remuneration is 
given by the negotiated price in the market plus a feed-in 
tariff. 
 
This legal framework has allowed that Spain was a 
pioneering and leader country in the integration of renewable 
energies as the wind or solar energy in the electricity system 
(Spain is the second European country in terms of installed 
capacity and production of these types of energy, only 
behind Germany).

III. 
MODELLING THE IMPACT OF RENEWABLES ON 
ELECTRICITY PRICES. A MAXIMUM  ENTROPY 
ECONOMETRIC APPROACH.  
Our goal is to estimate the effect of several variables (m) 
on electricity prices (y) by using data of several years (T).

vector of coefficients to be estimated (vector mX1) and 
vector of disturbances u.  
A. Maximum Entropy Econometric Approach. 
The estimation of y
X
u
=
β +
 by regression techniques 
requires that the number of observations (T) has to be 
superior to the number of independent variables (m).  
Nevertheless, information available regarding renewable 
energy and electric liberalization market is scarce. Therefore, 
in a situation of limited sample data the estimation of the 
model by regression procedures (OLS) is not possible as the 
problem is undetermined or ill-posed.  
However, when these circumstances of small amount of 
information available make it unfeasible to combine 
forecasts through OLS procedures the Maximum Entropy 
Econometric approach allows us to recover the estimates of 
1
, 2
,...,

β
 in the corresponding parameterized model 
without making distributional assumptions. The approach 
consists of developing a non-linear inversion procedure [14] 
which requires the application of the tools provided by the 
Information Theory ([11], [12], [13]).  
Consider a regression-based method: y
X
u
=
β +
 in a 
situation of limited sample data where m>T. A probability 
distribution should be used in order to represent partial and 
limited information regarding the individual observations so 
they are consistent with the observed sample data. Therefore, 
following [14] it is possible to define an inverse general 
problem 
for 
recovering 
β
 defined 
as: 
=

=
+
y
X
u
XP
u
β
, where 
1
m
P:(p ,…,p )'  is a m-
dimensional vector of unknown terms related to the 
probability distribution. The main objective is to estimate a 
probability distribution P given the limited information and 
minimal distributional assumptions and therefore recover β  
as 
ˆ = ˆ
P
β . 
However, as the number of observations (T) is smaller 
than the number of independent variables (m), if we attempt 
to recover P by using traditional procedures of mathematical 
inversion, there is more than one vector P making the 
solution feasible. Therefore the problem is ill-posed and we 
have no basis for picking a particular solution vector for P 
from the feasible set. Thus, if we ask for a particular set of 
probabilities considered as most likely, it seems reasonable 
to favour the one that could have been generated in the 
greatest number of ways given the available data.  
The definition of the entropy measure H(P) and the 
formulation of the Entropy Maximization problem can help 
us to estimate a unique P distribution since the principle of 
Maximum Entropy provides a basis for transforming the 
sample information into a probability distribution that 
reflects our uncertainty about the individual outcomes.  
The measures of entropy H(P) quantify the uncertainty 
associated with a random experiment. In particular, given a 
random variable X with values xi and probability distribution 
(

1,...,

n

ip ≥ 0
 (i=1..., n) and

p . 
The value of the entropy is maximum when all the values 
xi have the same probability (and then P is a uniform 
distribution). This situation would be justified by the Laplace 
Indifference Principle, according to which the uniform 
distribution is the most suitable representation of our 
knowledge when the random variable is completely 
unknown. Nevertheless, sometimes the ignorance of the 
probability distribution of X is not absolute and we have 
some partial information on the distribution such as the 
mean, variance, moments or some characteristics which can 
be formulated as equality constraints. In such a case, it is 
possible to estimate the probability distribution through the 
application of the Maximum Entropy principle ([12], [13]) 
choosing the distribution for which the available information 
is just sufficient to obtain the probability assignment. 
Thus, if we know certain values 
ra  (r=1..., s) associated 
with functions 
(
)

X  of the values of X but we do not know 
its distribution, the problem consists of estimating a 
nonnegative distribution that fulfils the conditions

i=1..., n and

By solving the maximization problem we can obtain the

, if 
there is no evidence that a specific independent variable is

distribution (P) would be the uniform (according to Laplace 
Indifference Principle). However, the principle of maximum 
entropy provides a basis for using the sample information in 
a probability distribution P that reflects our uncertainty about 
the individual independent variable. Therefore, the problem 
consists of estimating a nonnegative distribution P by 
maximizing the value of the entropy H(P)  subject to the 
available information. By solving the optimization problem 
the estimated probability distribution ˆP  is obtained.

If the vector of disturbances, u, is assumed to be a 
random vector with finite location and scale parameters, we 
can represent our uncertainty about it by treating each 
tu  
(t=1, ..., T) as a finite and discrete random variable with 
2 ≤
J ≤ ∞
 possible outcomes.  
Thus, it is assumed that each 
tu  is limited by an interval 
(
1tv ,

Pr( 1

[

 is a 
vector of error weights.  Furthermore, 
J ≥ 2
 can be used to 
assume certain characteristics of symmetry and kurtosis 
about the error distribution. 
Because there may be different levels of uncertainty 
underlying each 
iβ , for more general inferential purposes, 
point 
estimates 
may 
be 
limiting 
and 
unrealistic. 
Consequently, it is possible to generalize the maximum 
entropy problem to permit a discrete probability distribution 
to be specified and obtained for each 
iβ . Rather than search 
for the point estimates of β , each 
iβ  is viewed as the mean 
value of some well defined random variable z. 
Then, for each 
iβ , we assume there exists a discrete 
probability distribution that is defined over a parameter space

Using the Maximum entropy econometric approach, one 
investigates how “far” the data pull the estimates away from 
a state of complete ignorance (uniform distribution). In order 
to measure the reduction in the initial uncertainty, the 
information index entropy measure R is defined ([19], [20], 
[21]) and where
[
]
R
∈ 0,1
. A high value of R implies the data 
tell us something about the estimates, or similarly, there is 
valuable information in the data. 
Moreover, we can define measures to evaluate the 
information in each one of the variables i = 1,2,...,m as the 
normalized entropy: (
S piˆ )
. 
These variable-specific information measures reflect the 
relative contribution (of explaining the dependent variable) 
to the independent variable. Where

reflects no uncertainty while one reflects total uncertainty in 
the sense that P is uniformly distributed.  
 
B. Estimated Models. 
The basic time series data for the period 2002–2007 were 
taken 
from 
Eurostat 
(available 
at 
the 
web 
site 
http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu): 
Dependent variable y:  
Electricity prices for household consumers: This 
indicator presents electricity prices charged to final 
consumers. Electricity prices for household consumers are 
defined as follows: Average national price in Euro per miles 
kWh without taxes applicable for the first semester of each 
year for medium size household consumers (Consumption 
Band Dc with annual consumption between 2500 and 5000 
kWh).  
Independent variables, m:  
Electricity generated from renewable sources (% of gross 
electricity consumption): This indicator is the ratio between 
the electricity produced from renewable energy sources and 
the gross national electricity consumption for a given 
calendar year. It measures the contribution of electricity 
produced from renewable energy sources to the national 
electricity 
consumption. 
Electricity 
produced 
from 
renewable 
energy 
sources 
comprises 
the 
electricity 
generation from hydro plants (excluding pumping), wind, 
solar, geothermal and electricity from biomass/wastes.   We 
also have information about Electricity generated from wind 
power and Electricity generated from hydroelectricity as % 
of gross electricity consumption) 
Electricity generated from nuclear- % Total gross 
electricity generation  
Electricity generated from natural gas- % Total gross 
electricity generation  
Electricity generated from petroleum - % Total gross 
electricity generation  
Electricity generated from hard coal- % Total gross 
electricity generation.  
These two last variables are used also as proxy of the 
effects of GHG emissions on prices as electricity generated 
from petroleum or coal (thermal power stations) are the 
energy industries with more GHG emissions. We also have 
considered the variable Greenhouse gas emissions by Energy 
industries (-% total Greenhouse gas emissions). 
 
As variables related to electricity market and its 
liberalization we consider: 
Number of enterprises dedicated to generation of 
electricity 
Number of enterprises dedicated to distribution and 
trade of electricity 
24

GDP per capita (thousands of euros): Since in Spain 
there is a part of the electricity price paid by the government, 
it could be interesting to study the effect of the general 
economic activity on electricity price. 
Moreover as Spain has a high level of energy 
dependency (around 80% levels) we also have into 
consideration this fact. The most imported energy is gas and 
petroleum so petroleum prices could have some impacts on 
electricity price. We use the brent crude petroleum price by 
barrel (in dollars). 
For the solution of the optimization the GAMS program 
version 21.3 (General Algebraic Modeling System) is used. 
This is a programming language which allows diverse 
optimization problems to be solved. 
We first deal with a general maximum entropy model 
with a reparametrized error. We establish an a priori range 
for the possible values that may be assumed by error u in the 
model, which may be employed to assume certain 
characteristics of its distribution: V. Since this decision is 
arbitrary, we have assigned a support vector for the errors:  (-
v, -v/2, 0, v/2, v) for v>0, which guarantees its symmetry 
around zero. The decision regarding the amplitude of the 
range of values which it may assume is arbitrary. According 
with [22] support vector v can be assessed if we perfect 
knew the variability presented on y and we can use the three 
standard deviation rule as estimation for v. In fact we follow 
the proposal of [23] who use the sample variance of y  (5,38 
miles de euros and then v=16.15) as an estimate for v. 
However, as a widening of the error bound by increasing v 
the estimated weights converge on the uniform distribution 
(the difference between the weights of the variables is 
reduced) we have used the most reduced v that makes the 
solution feasible (v=7).  
Moreover, we establish an a priori range for the possible 
values that may be assumed by β  in the model. Thus, we 
should choose the support space Z, and then use the data to 
estimate the P which in turn yields β . The restrictions 
imposed on the parameter space through Z should reflect our 
prior knowledge about the unknown parameters. However, 
such knowledge is not available as the estimated models are 
scarce, and we may want to entertain a variety plausible 
bound onβ . However, we have considered a vector support 
symmetrical and centered on zero and in accordance with the 
value ranking that the independent variables may take. 
Moreover, as an initial approximation, we have calculated a 
covariate matrix finding negative values in β . So, we 
consider Z= (-z, 0, z) for z>0, which guarantees its symmetry 
around zero. We consider the same z for all coefficients 
(z=0.7). It implies that we have to be very cautious in the 
interpretation of the estimated ˆβ . As we report (
S piˆ )
 and 
(
S piˆ )
1
≅ implies 
iˆ
β ≅ 0
a natural criterion for identification 
of the information content of a given 
ix  is just the 
normalized entropy.  
Table I shows our estimated weights for the electricity 
price (β ) under the reparameterized system. We report the 
estimated coefficients for the model with highest R obtained.  
The results are those obtained under the narrowest V vector.  
The estimated information index R=0.722 indicates a 
reduction of the uncertainty by using the maximization 
entropy approach, however, the findings yield that the 
variable Electricity generated from renewable energies 
(RES) does not have sense to explain electricity prices as 
(
S piˆ )
1
≅ .  
Therefore, we tried to study separately the renewable 
energy sources. In Spain, the largest part of the electricity 
generation by RES is devoted to wind power and hydro, so 
we estimate the model with Electricity generated from wind 
power and Electricity generated from hydroelectricity 
variables. Table II shows our new estimated weights for the 
electricity price (β ).

The results give us additional information with respect to 
the first model about the direction in which the RES affect 
the dependent variable. Electricity generated from wind is a 
very important variable ( (
S piˆ )
= 0.095
) which contributes to 
reduce electricity prices. Moreover, when electricity 
generated from hard coal increases the electricity prices, 
these increases could be in part due by the cost of the GHG 
emissions which have to be paid by hard coal based energy 
industries.  Energy dependence has also an important effect. 
Regarding to the electricity market liberalization 
variables, the number of enterprises dedicated to electricity 
generation does not have sense to explain electricity prices. 
However, the Number of enterprises dedicated to 
distribution and trade of electricity gives more information 
to explain y as (
S piˆ )
= 0.298
, nevertheless it has a positive 
effect on electricity prices. Electricity market opening does 
not necessarily imply effective competition and competitive 
prices. Achieving competitive prices depends on the number 
of the players and the nature of consumer demand as 
consumers could be resistant to switching.

MAIN FINDINGS AND CONCLUDING REMARKS 
We have analyzed the role of some economic and 
environmental variables on electricity price in Spain for the 
time period 2002-2007, applying Theory Information 
Approach due the small sample size.  
By applying the General Maximum Entropy Estimation 
Approach, it becomes possible to estimate a model bearing 
in mind all, and only, the limited information available 
which would not be possible with more traditional estimation 
methods.  
Regarding the price effects of renewable energies, since 
the majority of renewable energy technologies are not 
profitable at current energy prices, they are expected to 
increase energy costs.  
In addition, environmental costs related to CO2 emissions 
in electricity generation in general have a significant 
negative effect on energy costs.  Moreover, the regulatory 
reforms in the Spanish Electricity Market also could have its 
effect on electricity prices.  
The results showed that electricity generated from wind 
contributes to reduce electricity prices. Moreover, when 
electricity generated from hard coal increases the electricity 
prices, these increases could be in part due by the cost of the 
GHG emissions which have to be paid by hard coal based 
energy industries.  Energy dependence has also an important 
effect on electricity prices in Spain. 
The liberalization of electricity industry, in retail 
activities, has a positive effect on electricity prices. 
Electricity market opening does not necessarily imply 
effective competition and competitive prices. Achieving 
competitive prices depends on the number of the players and 
the nature of consumer demand as consumers could be 
resistant to switching.
