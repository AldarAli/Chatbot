 INTRODUCTION 
In this paper, we propose a recommender system for 
supporting the professors in higher education of midwifery 
and maritime in understanding their students’ needs so that 
he/she adapts the e-learning process accordingly. This 
research work extends our previous work [1] in the following 
directions: (i) We incorporated X-means clustering for 
dynamically creating the clusters corresponding to learning 
profiles; (ii) we enriched the model with the learning 
profiles; (iii) we applied our proposed approach in an 
additional higher education institution for further validation. 
According to a European Commission’s report on digital 
skills in education in 2013, an average of 65% of students in 
EU countries never used digital textbooks, exercise software, 
broadcasts/podcasts, simulations or learning games [2]. 
Since then, higher education institutions have shown a 
persistent concern with enhancing students’ academic 
performance through the use of innovative technologies that 
offer new ways of delivering and producing university 
education [3]. From an economic point of view, the industry 
of e-learning has developed considerably in the last decade. 
The market of e-learning all over the world will be over 243 
billion dollars in 2022 [4]. 
The pandemic of COVID-19 led most of the 
governments around the world to impose lockdown, 
social/physical distancing, avoiding face-to-face teaching-
learning, and restrictions on travelling and immigration [4]. 
It caused the closing of classrooms all over the world and 
forced 1.5 billion students and 63 million educators to 
suddenly modify their face-to-face academic practices [4]. 
This closure led to an unprecedented impact on education. 
Higher education institutions were forced to shift rapidly to 
distance and online learning. On the one hand, this fact 
revealed the weaknesses of adoption and utilization of e-
learning strategies and technologies [5] [6]; but, on the other 
hand, it resulted in a digital revolution through online 
lectures, teleconferencing, digital open books, online 
examination, and interaction at virtual environments [7]. 
E-learning is the use of new multimedia technologies and 
the Internet to improve the quality of learning by facilitating 
access to resources and services, as well as remote exchange 
and collaboration [8] [9]. It has a great potential from the 
educational perspective and it has been one of the main 
research lines of educational technology in the last decades 
[4]. Particular attention has been given on understanding the 
adoption factors related to e-learning services satisfaction 
and acceptance by students and tutors [6] [8] [10].  
However, the wide use of e-learning due to COVID-19 
demonstrated inequalities as a result of previously 
underestimating the potential of e-learning and its exclusion 
from the digital education projects of educational institutions 
[4]. A considerable amount of literature has investigated 
inequalities between developed and developing countries [3] 
[11]. However, the wide adoption of e-learning strategies and 
technologies and the complete transformation of the physical 
learning process to a virtual one pose the challenge of 
personalization according to different learning profiles [12], 
a research area rather underexplored. E-learning provides 
people with a flexible way to learn allowing learning on 
demand and reducing the associated costs [8]. E-learning 
personalization is emerged as a major challenge [12] [13], 
especially in today’s fast adoption of this alternative way of 
learning.  
Despite the large amount of research works dealing with 
learning profiles in physical classrooms, these models should 
be further investigated and validated in the virtual 
classrooms, during the e-learning process. To this end, the 
contribution of e-learning to several learning factors 
according to the learning profiles has the potential to reveal 
the acceptance of e-learning by different learning profiles

and to result in e-learning process personalization in order to 
mitigate the respective inequalities. 
The objective of the current paper is to develop an 
intelligent 
recommender 
system 
for 
supporting 
the 
professors in higher education in understanding their 
students’ needs so that he/she adapts the e-learning process 
accordingly. In addition, the proposed recommender system 
is able to classify new records (i.e., students) to the 
appropriate learning profiles, e.g., in order to support the 
organization of the class groups. The proposed approach was 
applied to a maritime educational institution. The rest of the 
paper is organized as follows: Section II presents the related 
work on methods and approaches for evaluating students’ 
acceptance of the e-learning process as well as learning 
profile models for learning personalization. Section III 
describes the research methodology and the proposed 
approach for the development of an intelligent recommender 
system for e-learning process personalization. Section IV 
presents the results from the adoption of the proposed 
methodology in the maritime and the midwifery education. 
Section V discusses the results and the implications of the 
proposed methodology. Section VI concludes the paper and 
outlines our plans for future work. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
In this section, we present the related work in order to 
present the current status in the literature and to identify the 
challenges 
and 
the 
research 
gaps 
on 
e-learning 
personalization. Section II.A reviews related research works 
on e-learning acceptance, and Section II.B reviews works 
related to learning personalization with a focus on learning 
profiles and their applicability to the e-learning process. 
A. E-learning Acceptance 
Existing literature is quite rich on evaluating students’ 
experience, satisfaction and acceptance of the e-learning 
process. In general, earlier studies focused more on content, 
customization and technology, while more recent studies 
focused on students' attitude and interaction, expectations, 
acceptance and satisfaction [10] [14]. To this end, there is an 
emerging trend towards the identification of the key factors 
for the adoption of e-learning strategies and technologies. 
Several studies have used the original version of the 
classic model, the DeLone & McLean (D&M) IS Success 
Model [15] to measure and evaluate the success of e-learning 
systems [16]-[18]. Holsapple and Lee-Post [16] introduced 
the E-Learning Success Model, which posits that the overall 
success of an e-learning initiative depends on the attainment 
of success at each of the three stages of e-learning systems 
development: system design, system delivery, and system 
outcome. Lin and Lee [17] proposed a research model to 
examine the determinants for successful use of online 
communities based on structural equation modelling (SEM) 
approach. The analytical results showed, among others, that 
system quality, information quality and service quality had a 
significant effect on member loyalty through user 
satisfaction and behavioural intention to use the online 
community. Lin [18] examined the determinants for 
successful use of online learning systems. The results 
showed that system quality, information quality, and service 
quality had significant effects on user satisfaction. 
The use of virtual learning environments in addition to 
classroom study (blended learning), were surveyed by [19]. 
They concluded that the students' performance of the virtual 
learning environment support had better results than those 
having only face to face learning. The identified key 
satisfaction factors are information quality, system quality, 
instructor attitude toward e-learning, diversity in assessment, 
and learner perceived interaction with others. The authors in 
[8] identified clear governance structure and the need of 
organized distribution of planning responsibilities and 
implementation as the main adoption factors. In [20], the 
authors concluded that perceived usefulness, ease of use, 
perceived enjoyment, network externality factor, system 
factor, individual factors, and social factors are the main e-
learning acceptance predictors. Student interface, learning 
community, content, and customization as well as ease of use 
of web courses have also been identified to have a significant 
impact on e-learning acceptance [21] [22]. 
In [23], the authors concluded that student e-learning 
adoption and attitudes in the university context are academic 
achievements mediated by digital readiness and academic 
engagement. In [24], the authors proposed an e-learning tools 
acceptance model in order to examine the level of acceptance 
and critical factors of virtual learning tools among university 
students in developing countries. Results confirm a strong 
relation between the perceived usefulness and the instructor 
preparation and autonomy in learning, as well as between the 
ease of use and the perceived self-efficacy perception. The 
reseach work of [25] developed a Technology Acceptance 
Model (TAM) for e-learning. The results indicated that 
system quality, computer self-efficacy, and computer 
playfulness have a significant impact on perceived ease of 
use of e-learning system. Furthermore, information quality, 
perceived enjoyment, and accessibility were found to have a 
positive influence on perceived ease of use and perceived 
usefulness of e-learning system. 
The authors in [26] applied process mining methods in 
order to discover students’ self-regulated learning processes 
during e-learning. They identified a high presence of actions 
related to forum-supported collaborative learning among the 
students who finally passed the exams and an absence of 
those in their failing classmates. The research work of [6] 
concluded that the main factors affecting the usage of e-
learning are: technological factors, e-learning system quality 
factors, trust factors, self-efficacy factors and cultural 
aspects. Therefore, apart from the challenges related to the 
technological infrastructure, change management, course 
design, computer self-efficacy and financial support are also 
issues of outmost importance.  
B. Learning Personalization 
Learning personalization is an important topic in 
educational sciences. Since different people learn in different 
ways, it is important to create and adapt the e-learning in 
order to maximize and speed up the learning process [12]. 
The need to adapt teaching strategies to the student’s 
preferences is a reality in classrooms, be they physical or 

75

virtual [27] [28]. However, this does not mean that a method 
should be created for each student in a classroom, but that 
the best form of interaction for each of them be identified, 
building groups of learners with common characteristics 
[29]. 
Learning 
styles 
are 
cognitive, 
affective 
and 
psychological traits that determine how a student interacts 
and reacts in a learning environment [30]. The idea is to 
identify the marked characteristics of a given learner so that 
these traits influence his learning process. 
Several learning profile models have been developed in 
the literature, such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator – 
MBTI, Kolb’s Experiential Learning Model, the Hermann 
Brain Dominance Instrument (HBDI), the Dunn and Dunn 
Model, the Felder-Silverman Model, and the Honey and 
Mumford Model [27] [28]. With the wide adoption of e-
learning strategies and technologies, there is the need for 
applying and validating learning profile models in the digital 
and online learning era. For example, in [12], the authors 
investigated the e-learning personalization aiming at keeping 
students motivated and engaged. To that end, they proposed 
the use of k-means algorithm to cluster students based on 12 
engagement metrics divided into two categories: interaction-
related and effort-related. The research work of [28] 
presented the architecture of a system that realizes an 
evaluation of learning profiles based on categories of student 
preferences. The profile models were built according to 
categories of student preferences based on the proposal of 
learning styles put forward by [30]. 
III. 
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
In this section, we present the adopted research 
methodology for e-learning personalization forming the 
basis for the development of an associated intelligent 
recommender system. The methodology consists of six steps 
that are described in the following sub-sections: (A) Data 
Collection; (b) Learning Profile Model Selection; (C) 
Classification for Structuring the Learning Profiles; (D) 
Validation 
of 
Learning 
Profiles 
Classification; 
(E) 
Modelling the Relationships between Learning Profiles and 
E-learning Preferences; and, (F) Predicting the Class 
Attribute of E-learning Impact. 
A. Data Collection  
The data was collected in the form of an online 
questionnaire of 80 questions addressed to students of higher 
educational institutions. Each question was in the form of 
Likert scale (1: Strongly Disagree – 5: Strongly Agree) and it 
was related to one out of the four learning styles as defined 
by the Honey and Mumford Model [31]: activist, reflector, 
pragmatist, and theorist. For example, in an ideal scenario 
that a student has answered 5: Strongly Agree to all the 
questions matching to the “activist” learning profile and 1: 
Strongly Disagree to all the others, he/she is classified as 
“activist”. 
B. Learning Profile Model Selection 
As it was mentioned, the selected learning profile model 
is the Honey and Mumford Model [31], which includes four 
learning styles: activist, reflector, pragmatist, and theorist. 
However, this classification is usually not straightforward 
since most of the students belong to a mixture of learning 
styles, meaning that they incorporate characteristics from 
more than one profile [31]. The main characteristics of these 
four learning profiles are described below [32]. 
Activist refers to an individual’s preference for active 
involvement in the learning activity (through problem 
solving, discussion, creating their own models). Activists are 
enjoy new experiences and are not willing to participate in 
repeated tasks. They prefer brainstorming as a format of 
discussion. Therefore, the teaching and learning activities 
that are effective for this group need to provide new 
experiences, problem-based learning, games and group 
research. The teaching and learning activities that are not 
effective for this group are one-way lecture, passive learning, 
learning that involves many mixed and unarranged data, 
repeating the same activity. 
Reflector prefers learning by watching and thinking. The 
reflector responds more positively to learning activities 
where there is time to observe, reflect and think and work in 
a detailed manner. Reflectors like to collect and analyse data 
and are careful at making decisions. They do not like to 
become leaders. The teaching and learning activities that are 
effective for this group need to be stimulating and to provide 
them with time to think before reacting and to provide 
conclusions without pressure. The teaching and learning 
activities that are not effective for this group are placing 
them in the role of leader or having them perform in front of 
people. They experience stress if required to perform 
immediately after a brief instruction 
Pragmatist wants to know how to put what they are 
learning into practice in the real world. They experiment 
with theories, ideas, and techniques and take the time to 
think about how what they’ve done relates to reality. 
Pragmatists prefer to come up with new ideas, and solving 
problems especially for real life situations. The teaching and 
learning activities that are effective for this group are 
demonstrating practical techniques, providing them with the 
opportunity to express what they have learned and focusing 
on the practical issues. Learning methods that are not related 
to immediate need and performance with no clear practice or 
outline are not suitable for this group. 
Theorist seeks to understand the theory behind the action. 
They follow models and reading up on facts to better engage 
in the learning process. Theorists are quite objective, and 
they do not enjoy things that are subjective. They prefer to 
make conclusions based on evidence, data analysis and logic. 
They have clear minds. The teaching and learning activities 
that are effective for this group are providing them with time 
to organise their feelings and to ask questions and process 
the methodology, assumption or logic in detail. The teaching 
and learning activities that are not effective for this group are 
learning that involves emotion, feelings, and activities that 
are unstructured. 
C. Classification for Structuring the Learning Profiles 
The classification of the student to the learning profiles is 
not straightforward since they may have characteristics of 

76

more than one profile. Therefore, according to the given 
answers, the k-means clustering algorithm was applied in 
order to assign the respondents to 4 clusters (k=4) matching 
to the aforementioned learning profiles.   
k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization 
that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which 
each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean 
(cluster centers or cluster centroid) [33]. k-means clustering 
minimizes the within-cluster variances (squared Euclidean 
distances). Given a set of observations (x1, x2, …, xn), where 
each observation is a d-dimensional real vector, k-means 
clustering aims to partition the n observations into k (≤ n) 
sets S={S1, S2, …, Sk} so as to minimize the within-cluster 
sum of squares (WCSS) (i.e., variance). Formally, the 
objective is to find:  
 
 
 
(1) 
 
where μi is the mean of points in Si. This is equivalent to 
minimizing the pairwise squared deviations of points in the 
same cluster: 
 
 
 
(2) 
 
The equivalence can be deduced from the identity: 
 
 
(3) 
 
Because the total variance is constant, this is equivalent to 
maximizing the sum of squared deviations between points in 
different clusters (Between-Cluster Sum of Squares, BCSS), 
which follows from the law of total variance.  
D. Validation of the Learning Profiles Classification 
As it has been already mentioned, students may belong to 
a mixture of learning styles, in the sense that that they may 
incorporate characteristics from more than one profile. In 
order to validate the k-means clustering results of the 
previous step, i.e., the classification to the aforementioned 4 
discrete learning profiles, we implement the X-means 
clustering algorithm. 
In contrast to the k-means clustering algorithm which 
requires the number of clusters k to be supplied by the user 
and its search is prone to local minima, X-means searches 
the space of cluster locations and number of clusters to 
optimize the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) [34][35]. 
In this way, it can identify additional clusters representing 
mixtures of learning profiles. After comparing these results 
with the ones derived from the k-means clustering algorithm 
of the previous step, the domain expert is able to validate the 
applicability of Honey and Mumford Model according to the 
similarity of the two resulting sets of clusters. Moreover, 
they are able to select whether they will be based upon a pre-
defined model of learning styles or they will create 
dynamically learning styles in order to tackle with the 
mixtures of learning profiles that most often exist in reality. 
The X-means clustering algorithm starts with k equal to 
the lower bound of the given range and adds centroids until 
the upper bound is reached. During this process, the centroid 
set that achieves the best score is recorded. The algorithm 
consists of two operations repeated until completion:  
• 
Improve Parameters: which runs conventional k-
means to converge. 
• 
Improve Structure: which finds out if and where 
new centroids should appear by splitting centroids. 
In this operation, the advantages of two splitting 
approaches are combined: (i) One at a time: picking 
one centroid, producing a new centroid nearby, and 
running k-means to completion; (ii) Half the 
centroids: Gaussian mixture model identification 
and heuristics criteria for assessing the usefulness of 
splitting. 
 
The selection of the k values is performed according to 
the BIC. Given the data D and a family of alternative models 
Mj, X-means adopts the posterior probability P(Mj|D) to 
score the models derived from k-means clustering. To 
approximate the posterior probabilities until normalization, 
the following formula is used [36][37]: 
 
 
 
(4) 
where 
 is the log-likelihood of the data according to the 
j-th model and taken at the maximum-likelihood point, and pj 
is the number of parameters in Mj. This is also known as 
Schwarz criterion. 
 
The maximum likelihood estimation for the variance, 
under the identical spherical Gaussian assumption is:  
 
 
(5) 
The point probabilities are: 
 
 
(6) 
The log-likelihood of the data is: 
 
 
(7) 
Focusing on the set Dn which belong to centroid n and 
plugging in the maximum-likelihood estimates yield: 
 
 
 
 
 
(8) 
The BIC is used both globally, when X-means selects the 
best model, and locally, in all the centroid split tests. Finally, 

77

the algorithm generates the number of the clusters X, 
corresponding to the unsupervised set of learning profiles, as 
well as the students assigned to each cluster. Comparing 
these results to the ones derived from the k-means clustering 
with the pre-defined 4 learning profiles, the consistency of 
the Honey and Mumford Model is evaluated in a data-driven 
way. 
E. Modelling the Relationships between Learning Profiles 
and E-learning Preferences 
Subsequently, the proposed approach models the 
relationships between the learning profiles and e-learning 
contribution to learning factors as derived from the 
questionnaire. The input to this step is typically the outcome 
of the step “C: Classification for structuring the learning 
profiles” provided that the step “D: Validation of the 
learning profiles classification” provides acceptable results. 
Alternatively, the user of the recommender system may 
prefer to use the outputs of the X-means clustering 
algorithm, instead of the ones of the k-means, in order to 
apply an unsupervised approach. The latter is especially 
useful when the X-means algorithm does not approach the 
results of the k-means. 
To do this, a Bayesian Network (BN) is applied aiming at 
identifying these causal and uncertain relationships. A BN, 
also known as belief network, is defined as a pair B = (G, 
Θ). G = (V, E) is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where V 
= {v1, …, vn} is a collection of n nodes, E ⸦ V × V a 
collection of edges and a set of parameters Θ containing all 
the Conditional Probabilities (CP) of the network [38]. Each 
node v ϵ V of the graph represents a random variable XV with 
a state space XV which can be either discrete or continuous. 
An edge (vi, vj) ϵ E represents the conditional dependence 
between two nodes vi, vj ϵ V where vi is the parent of child vj. 
If two nodes are not connected by an edge, they are 
conditional independent. Because a node can have more than 
one parent, let πv the set of parents for a node v ϵ V.  
      Therefore, each random variable is independent of all 
nodes V \ πv. For each node, a Conditional Probability Table 
(CPT) contains the CP distribution with parameters θxi|πi 
:=P(xi|πi) ϵ Θ for each realization xi of Xi conditioned on πi. 
The joint probability distribution over V is visualized by the 
BN and can be defined as:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(9) 
 
With BN, inference for what-if analysis can be 
supported, either top-down (predictive support) or bottom-up 
(diagnostic support). If a random variable which is 
represented by a node is observed, the node is called an 
evidence node; otherwise, it is a hidden node [39]. Based on 
the learning profiles derived from the questionnaire, a BN 
with two layers was developed: at the top layer (i.e., learning 
profiles), there are 4 parent nodes matching to the respective 
clusters of students.  
At the bottom layer (i.e., e-learning contribution to 
learning factors), there are 9 child nodes referring to 9 e-
learning factors grouping the questions. In this way, the 
model identifies the preferences of each learning profile by 
assessing the impact of e-learning on the learning process of 
each profile. Therefore, according to the learning profile, the 
user is able to select the appropriate learning strategies 
aiming at personalizing the e-learning process. 
The e-learning factors are constructed based on the 
groupping of the various questions of the questionnaire. 
Below, we describe their meaning: 
F1: Comprehension: the level of comprehension of the 
course content with e-learning. 
F2: Content digestion: the satisfaction by the content 
presented in comparison to the contents of the course. 
F3: Knowledge generalization: the capability of 
understanding practical examples and how they support the 
overall concepts and theories. 
F4: Guidance and monitoring: The level to which the 
interaction between the tutor and the students facilitates 
guidance and monitoring of students’ preformance. 
F5: Tutor communication: the level to which the 
communication between the tutor and the students is 
efficient. 
F6: Active participation: The level to which e-learning 
enables the active participation of the students, e.g. by posing 
questions, participating to discussions, etc. 
F7 Effective learning: The level to which the learning 
procedure is performed in an effective way.

F8 Communication among students: The degree to which 
e-learning includes discussions among students and 
teamwork. 
F9 Approach by the tutor: the extent to which the tutor 
applies pedagogical approaches that are personalized to the 
learning needs of the students. 
F. Predicting the Class Attribute of E-learning Impact  
At any time, the user of the recommender system is able 
to make queries in order to investigate particular 
relationships along with their associated CPTs. Moreover, 
the model incorporates a Naïve Bayes classifier for 
predicting the class attribute of a learning profile as soon as 
new records of students’ responses are inserted into the 
database.  
Naïve Bayes classifier is highly scalable, requiring a 
number of parameters linear in the number of variables in a 
learning problem. Maximum-likelihood training can be done 
by evaluating a closed-form expression, which takes linear 
time, rather than by expensive iterative approximation as 
used for many other types of classifiers [40]. Prediction of 
the class attribute can be performed even if the questionnaire 
is not completely answered. 
IV. 
RESULTS 
The proposed approach was applied on a dataset of 524 
students: 268 from a maritime higher educational institution 
and 256 students of a midwifery department in a University 
in Greece. Following the research methodology described in 
Section III, the data was analyzed both as separate cases, one 
case in maritime students and one case in midwifery 
students, and as a whole. The implementation and execution 
of the experiments were performed using the sklearn.cluster 
library of Python [44] for the k-means clustering algorithm 
and the BN functionalities of the pgmpy (Probabilistic 
Graphical Models using Python) package [45].  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Section IV.A presents the results from the dataset of 
maritime students. Section IV.B presents the results from the 
dataset of the midwifery students.  
A. Dataset from Maritime Institution 
The transformation of maritime from highly labour- to 
capital-intensive industry contributed to the presence of 
tertiary education in maritime studies [41]. However, the 
learning process in maritime education faces additional 
challenges due to the structure of their programs, the 
tendency of undergraduate students to combine studies and 
work, 
the 
internationalization, 
specialization, 
and 
standardization [42][43]. These make maritime education an 
interesting case study for the validation of e-learning process 
personalization.

After having structured the learning profiles of the 
respondents, the BN is created and the CPTs are calculated, 
as shown in Figure 1. Table I presents the highest and the 
lowest CPs of the e-learning contribution to learning factors 
given the learning profiles for the maritime institution. 
Therefore, the highest CP is the one of a student being 
activist given the answers of the second row that is 38.6%. 
The lowest CP is the one of a student being activist given the 
answers of the last row that is 5.6%. According to the queries 
posed by the user, various calculations can be done.  As 
already mentioned, the model can also serve as a classifier 
for predicting the class attribute of learning factors as soon as 
new records of students are received and classified through 
the k-means clustering algorithm.  
In order to evaluate its classification effectiveness, we 
inserted 
additional 
records, 
derived 
from 
more 
questionnaires addressed to students of the maritime 
educational institution, and we created the confusion matrix 
according to Table II in order to estimate the precision and 
the recall of the classifier using (5) and (6) [46]. 
The Precision results are quite satisfactory, while the 
Recall results can be further improved. We should also take 
into account that modelling human behavior, such as the 
learning process, has a high degree of uncertainty [47]. 
Moreover, the BN model sticks to the initially identified 
relationships, i.e., the ones that have been mined during the 
model training. Therefore, when new relationships, not 
previously identified, are added, they are not classified 
correctly. These records include values that are not frequent, 
so they are not critical for decision making

Evidence within higher education clearly identifies that 
the academic and personal development of students is 
enhanced by engagement with the academic and non-
academic life of college [48][49]. It is necessary for the 
development of important capabilities including critical 
thinking, problem-solving, team work, and written and oral 
communication skills, all of which are essential midwifery 
graduate competencies for practice in modern, dynamic and 
complex healthcare services [50]. 
After having structured the learning profiles of the 
respondents, the BN is created and the CPTs are calculated, 
as shown in Figure 2. Table III presents the highest and the 
lowest CPs of the e-learning contribution to learning factors 
given the learning profiles for the midwifery institution. 
Therefore, the highest CP is the one of a student being 
pragmatist given the answers of the second row that is 
37.8%.  
The lowest CP is the one of a student being activist given 
the answers of the last row that is 6.2%. According to the 
queries posed by the user, various calculations can be done.  
As already mentioned, the model can also serve as a 
classifier for predicting the class attribute of learning factors 
as soon as new records of students are received and classified 
through the k-means clustering algorithm. The confusion

DISCUSSION 
E-learning provides people with a flexible way to learn 
allowing learning on demand and reducing the associated 
costs. The wide adoption of e-learning strategies and 
technologies and the transformation of the physical learning 
process to a virtual one pose the challenge of personalization 
according to different learning. E-learning personalization is 
emerged as a major challenge, especially in today’s fast 
adoption of this alternative way of learning. The proposed

approach was proved to be effective in classifying the 
students’ learning profiles in order to adapt the learning 
process and to provide personalized recommendations for the 
learning style. It validated in two diverse educational 
institutions and the results show a stability in students’ 
classification according to their answers to the questionnaire. 
The proposed approach can work either with a pre-defined 
learning profiles model or with a learned set of learning 
profiles. 
In the first case (i.e., pre-defined learning profiles 
model), the proposed approach was based on the Honey and 
Mumford Model, which includes four learning styles: 
activist, reflector, pragmatist, and theorist. Therefore, the k-
means clustering algorithm takes as input k=4. This case 
refers to a supervised learning approach. It should be noted 
that the learning profiles model can be a different one. Then, 
X-means clustering algorithm validates the assumption about 
the number of the clusters that was derived from the learning 
profiles model. The user may define a threshold of outliers 
that is acceptable for the model validation. If this threshold is 
not exceeded, the learning profiles and the learning factors 
along with their values feed into the BN. The latter is able to 
perform predictions and to provide useful information upon 
user’s queries. 
In the second case (i.e., learned set of learning profiles), 
the clusters corresponding to learning profiles can be created 
dynamically directly by the X-means clustering algorithm. 
This case refers to an unsupervised learning approach in 
which the learning profiles are not known in advance, and 
the resulting clusters should be interpreted by a domain 
expert. Then, the BN is structured accordingly with its nodes 
of the upper layer corresponding to the resulting number of 
clusters by the X-means algorithm. 
In both cases, the proposed approach takes advantage of 
machine learning algorithms in order to form the basis for a 
recommender system capable of supporting personalized 
teaching and learning procedures according to the students’ 
learning profile.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
During the last years, e-learning has been gaining an 
increasing attention in higher education. Especially during 
the last months, higher education institutions were forced to 
shift rapidly to distance and online learning. On the one 
hand, this fact revealed the weaknesses of adoption and 
utilization of e-learning strategies and technologies, but, on 
the other hand, it resulted in a digital revolution in education. 
A major challenge was to apply e-learning strategies and 
technologies for supporting e-learning personalization. In 
this paper, we proposed an intelligent recommender system 
for e-learning process personalization.  
The proposed approach is based on the Honey and 
Mumford Model of learning profiles and utilized k-means 
clustering, X-means clustering, and BNs in order to classify 
the students to learning profiles and to reveal relationships 
with the contribution of e-learning to several learning 
factors. The proposed approach was applied to maritime and 
midwifery education. We validated the model in terms of its 
precision and recall in predicting the learning profile when 
new records are inserted into the database. 
Regarding our future work, we plan to incorporate 
additional learning factors with respect to the e-learning 
impact. Moreover, we plan to apply more machine learning 
and data analytics methods, with an emphasis on fuzzy 
methods, in combination with different learning profile 
models. Finally, we will plan to expand our research to 
various universities in order to obtain more generalized 
results.
