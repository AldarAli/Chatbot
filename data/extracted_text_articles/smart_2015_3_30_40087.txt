Abstract—Studies conducted around the world show that 
school infrastructure impacts the academic performance 
of students. The participation of students in the 
identification of school infrastructure problems is an 
exercise of citizenship. Taking the opportunity provided 
by the increasing popularity of smartphone use, this 
paper, as a work in progress, is aimed at assessing 
whether there is room for the design and development of 
a platform which would use smartphones as a 
crowdsourcing tool in order to allow students to report 
infrastructure problems in public schools from Recife, 
Brazil, so those issues would be easier to prioritize. The 
interviews performed with students showed a high level 
of engagement to solve problems they find at school, 
which points to a positive answer to the question above.

INTRODUCTION 
Smart cities are based on efficient management of 
infrastructure and urban services, the democratization of 
access to information for citizens, and the improvement of 
conditions for decision making in the private and public 
spheres [1]. 
A smart city should be seen as an organic whole, as a 
network. In a smart city, attention is given to connections 
and not only to the parties. The open model of the Internet 
has contributed to the consolidation of a new type of social 
worker, immersed in the emerging social networks, that is 
both consumer and producer of information and knowledge, 
the prosumer (producer+consumer) [1]. 
Civic improvement stems from improvement between the 
interfaces and integrations. That means a smart city believes 
that the most important connectors between the various 
subsystems are people turning it from a set of mechanistic 
infrastructure elements 
into a 
set of 
vibrant 
and 
interconnected human communities [1]. 
Brazil is ranked as the 6th country in smartphone use, with 
38.8 million users. It is estimated that this number will 
increase to 71.9 million by 2018 [2]. 
It is important to notice that most of the new smartphone 
users in Brazil are young people. In 2011, 48% of children 
and teenagers with ages ranging from 10 to 14 had 
smartphones, an increase of 12.6 percentage points since 
2009. Between the ages of 15 and 17, 67.5% of teenagers 
had smartphones in 2011, which corresponds to an increase 
of 15.7 pp during the same period [3]. 
Also, there has been an increase in smartphone use by 
people with low income [4]. This part of the population 
makes up 80% of the public education students who took 
ENEM (the Brazilian national high school education 
assessment, often used as the admission test for public 
universities) in 2011 [5]. 
The increase in smartphone use has affected a great many 
sectors of our society, and education isn’t an exception.  The 
debate around the actual use of smart devices as a 
technological learning tool has been in vogue lately. While 
some would see smart devices in class as an obstacle for 
education (as demonstrated by the hereinafter research), 
institutions such as UNESCO reinforce mobile learning as a 
viable and encouraged use of smartphones [6]. 
Ironically, despite the technological aspect smartphones 
may bring to a student’s life, infrastructure in schools is still 
a major education issue [7]. In Brazil, less than 1% of 
schools have the ideal infrastructure [8]. In fact, 
infrastructure impacts the well-being of students and their 
satisfaction levels while attending classes and, consequently, 
their average scores [9]. It is important to point out, though, 
that basic infrastructure standards, when not met, take their 
toll on other infrastructure areas. 
While learning support facilities (such as libraries and 
computer labs) often provide a higher impact on test results 
[4], lack of water and sanitation facilities, for instance, 
affects not only students’ enrollment and completion rates, 
but also teacher absenteeism [10]. 
Considering that students are the most affected party 
from infrastructure problems, this paper is aimed at assessing 
the usefulness for a platform where they would be able to 
report these issues themselves. Such a solution would 
inevitably rely on civic engagement. 
Civic 
engagement 
or 
civic 
participation 
is 
the 
involvement of citizens in the political process and issues 
that affect their lives. It is aimed at ensuring the rights of 
citizens to participate and contribute to the development of 
their communities, cities, and country. It determines the 
policies by which well-being will be seeked collectively by 
the members of a community [11]. 
    A school is a place where students spend much of their 
time and, besides providing academic education, it also has 
the purpose of contributing to the development of new 
citizens, as it is a great place to exercise civic engagement 
and develop values and motivation. 
In fact, youth civic engagement in the school community 
is not unheard of. It is possible to point out examples of 
initiatives both to help improve other students’ skills [12] 
and report school infrastructure problems [13].

II. 
METHODOLOGY 
This paper started with a research on information about 
the context of education problems in Brazil. As 
infrastructure problems proved to be shockingly present in 
schools in this country, this kind of issue was selected to be 
addressed by a solution which has yet to be designed, but 
whose embryonic concept would take form in this paper. 
As reference, some solutions which help solve 
infrastructure issues were examined. It was noted, then, that 
all those similar solutions which achieved some degree of 
success relied on crowdsourced problem reporting to feed 
their platform with data. Also, two of those solutions were 
smartphone applications, which demanded some research on 
smartphone popularity among the youth, especially those 
from families with low income. 
Crowdsourced data depends on community engagement 
and easy access to the platform. In order to assess whether 
these requirements would be met, interview guidelines were 
prepared with two main goals: understanding the actions 
taken by students when they found or faced problems at 
school, and understanding students’ relationship with their 
smart handheld devices. 
Some interviews with students were conducted, then, and 
the results led to a rough sketch of an architecture to the 
solution this study aims at. The solution still needs input 
both from a larger number of students and from the other 
end of the information flow (i.e.: desirability from those in 
charge of the strategic decisions which define the course 
education in Brazil will take). 
III. 
DESCRIBING RELATED WORKS 
It is possible to list several solutions regarding civic 
engagement in both community problem solving and 
infrastructure problem reporting. Those listed below use 
crowdsourcing as a means to advise the relevant authorities 
of issues the communities cannot normally solve by 
themselves. 
A. Chinese 
Sidewalk 
Repair 
and 
Improvement 
Crowdsourcing Website - Developed by the Beijing 
Transport Research Center, a crowdsourcing website 
asks pedestrians to identify areas in need of repair or 
improvement in Beijing. The system aims to help 
transportation planners to know how roads and 
sidewalks are being used by the public [14]. 
B. Colab - A social network for citizenship that helps 
citizens communicate with government. Their goal is to 
promote civic engagement and create better cities 
through citizen-govenment collaboration [15]. Colab 
won 2013 AppMyCity! Prize for world’s best urban app 
[16]. 
C. SITA (School Infrastructure Tracking Application) - 
A mobile-based application that will allow stakeholders 
(SMC members, NGO staff, Government officials) to 
track the status of infrastructure facilities in schools, 
such as toilets, drinking water, barrier-free access etc. 
and provide feedback on their maintenance [17]. 
D. UnB Infrastructure Mapping Platform - The Central 
Students Directorate (DCE) of University of Brasilia 
(UnB) released the university's infrastructure and 
salubrity map. The problems reported are taken to the 
university mayor every other week. By the end of 
Janurary 2013, more than 70 complaints had been made, 
and they ranged from lack of toilet paper to classrom 
floods. The DCE asks students to take photos of the 
problems and report issues “pinning” them to a digital 
map of the campus [18]. 
IV. 
INTERVIEWS WITH POTENTIAL USERS 
Based on the studies referenced in this paper, interviews 
were conducted in order to understand students’ relationship 
with their schools and the way they used smartphones. The 
interviews also included general questions, such as age, 
gender, schooling, and graduation year. 
The questions were divided into two groups: 4 questions 
concerning smartphone use, and 4 other about their 
relationship with their school. Two of them were multiple-
choice questions (device brand and operating system). 
The survey respondents consisted of 13 people from 
Recife, Brazil, with ages ranging from 18 to 20. All of the 
participants had graduated from high school between the 
years of 2011 and 2013. The collected data analysis is 
presented below. 
First, the participants were asked about their age and 
grade, for what they used their smartphones the most, how 
often they used their handheld devices, and how they 
accessed the internet at school while using their handsets 
(e.g., Wi-Fi, 3g). 
After the first part of the interview, they were also asked 
how long they studied at their current school, what they liked 
the most about their school, what they disliked the most 
about it, and how they proceeded when they found or faced a 
problem at school.

V. 
RESULTS 
The 
interviews 
found 
that 
all 
respondents 
own 
smartphones 
of 
various 
models 
and 
from 
various 
manufacturers. During their schools years, even though the 
use of handheld devices was banned in school, 7 of the 
respondents claimed to have used cell phones in the school 
dependencies. Moreover, 12 of the 13 participants said they 
used smartphones several times a day. 
The research revealed that the respondents used their 
smartphones mainly for instant communication (such as 
instant messaging apps and phone calls), asynchronous 
communication (such as emailing) and social networking 
(e.g., Facebook). 
Among the instant messaging applications used by the 
participants, WhatsApp [19] was the most popular one 
despite its need of internet access. Only two respondents 
claimed to not use the app. 
SMS, on the other hand, was the least popular means for 
instant communication. According to the participants, texting 
is still relatively expensive when compared to WhatsApp 
messaging. 
Using smartphones to make actual phone calls is 
common, but it is important to point out, though, that, by the 
time the interviews were conducted, WhatsApp had not 
allowed users to make voice calls [20], a fact that might 
impact future user research. 
Facebook was mentioned by the respondents as the only 
real popular social networking application, as they did not 
see WhatsApp as such. The use of other social networking 
apps (e.g., Twitter and Instagram) was minimal. 
On students’ relationship with their schools, the 
interviews highlighted that the main problems reported by 
students revolved around relationship issues, whether they 
were among peers or between students and the school staff 
(i.e., teachers and the principal’s office). 
When asked about how they normally proceeded when 
they found or faced problems at school, the participants 
displayed a high level of engagement and participation, as 
most of them would either try to solve problems by 
themselves or discuss the issue with friends and teachers. 
 
VI. 
THE PROPOSED SOLUTION 
Despite the active behavior the students would normally 
present while trying to solve problems at school, 
infrastructure issues cannot be resolved directly by them. 
They can still be part of the problem solving process, though, 
and the architecture below addresses their proactive attitude. 
The proposed solution is a platform aimed at informing 
the government authorities of infrastructure issues in schools 
in order to achieve better resource distribution. The data fed 
to the platform would be crowdsourced from students. 
Taking into consideration the increasing popularity of 
smartphones, especially among the youth, these devices can 
be seen as a viable technical requirement for a 
crowdsourcing solution, so the data would be entered 
through a smartphone app. 
Features present on most smart handheld devices 
nowadays, such as GPS tracking and digital camera, can 
provide invaluable precise data about infrastructure issues 
the students may find. 
This way, a student would be able to photograph the 
problem and describe it textually. Through GPS, the location 
for the problem would be sent without the need of entering 
the information manually (i.e, address, name of the school 
etc). The app, then, would either upload the report to a cloud 
server or save it to be synchronized later, depending on 
internet connection availability (e.g, 3g, 4g, or wi-fi). 
The data the students would provide would then be stored 
to a database so it would later be accessed by the relevant 
authorities through a web application which would present 
the data in the form of graphs, charts, heat maps etc. The 
problems would, then, be prioritized so the available 
resources could be better managed. 
The proposed solution architecture can be better 
visualized on Figure 1. 
 
Figure 1.  The proposed solution architecture. 
VII. CONCLUSION AND NEXT STEPS 
The results presented herein reveal that there is room for 
the development of a technological solution which can be 
used by students as a crowdsourcing tool. Such solutions 
would work not only to improve the school environment, but 
also to help develop civic engagement in students. 
On the other hand, smartphone use restriction may be a 
challenging issue. It is a matter that needs further 
investigation, as smartphone use policies vary among public 
schools and may render the significant use of any handheld 
device based solution unattainable. 
The existing tension between students and faculty is 
another obstacle to be surpassed. It creates an environment 
that may be unfavorable for a solution that requires 
unobstructed 
communication 
channels 
among 
those 
involved. 
As following steps, it is important that the user research be 
expanded to a larger number of respondents from a wider

variety of schools. Moreover, teachers, principals, school 
staff, and government authorities should also be interviewed. 
As mentioned above, it is needed to investigate the policy on 
smatphone use in public schools from Recife, Brazil.
