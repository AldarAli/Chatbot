Abstract—After a comeback in recent years, In-memory IT
systems are among the most promising solutions to solve present
and future IT problems. The use of the In-memory technology
promises a massive acceleration of query executions, as demanded
by the industry in the face of future challenges such as big data
and the internet of things. Despite the increased interest in the
technology, however, there is a still hesitant spread. One reason
is the lack of practical application scenarios that decision makers
can apply to their business context. It has been shown that the
sole acceleration of the IT-processing is not sufﬁcient for the
dissemination in the business environment. The aim of this work
is to introduce a framework to support the evaluation of potential
In-memory applications. This design science based framework
gives practitioners the opportunity to assess the suitability of
In-Memory IT-Systems based on their speciﬁc demands. The
underlying decision factors have been separated based on their
characteristics into value-creation dependent and independent
attributes. Appropriate methods were evaluated and selected for
the collection of the respective signiﬁcance. The decision model is
implemented using the concept of multi-criteria decision making.
The framework is applied using 10 potential real-world In-
memory use case scenarios. The results show that the presented
approach in this work is suitable to both, assess possible use cases
and determine cases with high potential.

INTRODUCTION
In this work, we introduce a design science based frame-
work which reﬂects both, the industrial as well as the scientiﬁc
claims to identify and evaluate potential In-memory IT-system
(IMIS) scenarios [1]. The decision whether to use an IMIS
in a company or not is a complex and multi-criteria decision
problem. Because of the fundamentally different approach of
IMIS, numerous other aspects beside traditional IT require-
ments have to be considered. This includes aspects such as,
relations to employees, customers and suppliers. Furthermore,
possible changes in the company’s infrastructure [2] has to
be evaluated. The representation of this complexity requires a
corresponding model which covers all these different aspects.
Due to the versatility of the IMIS technology and its potential
use in different use cases, the scenarios may strongly differ.
Some aspects may be speciﬁc and unique, meaning only
relevant for a certain scenario. These aspects are directly
linked to the creation of business value and are therefore
called value-creation dependent. On the other hand, there
will be aspects of a scenario that are not directly linked.
These are called value-creation independent. According to their
speciﬁc characteristics the weightings of the value-creation
independent factors are determined by the analytic hierarchy
processing and the dependent factors are determined by the
direct ranking method. The evaluation and interpretation of the
framework is presented based on 10 cross-industry use cases.
Enterprises are faced with the challenge of constantly
growing data volumes, increasing competition pressure and the
permanent need to instantly react to events. This is one of the
main reasons why choosing the “right” IT-systems has become
a major strategic decision for companies. The selection of the
appropriate system may determine the success of a company
or in other words, the selection of the wrong system might
lead to serious business disadvantages [3]. The challenges and
possibilities associated with the term Big Data characterizes
today’s IT landscapes. In this context, IMIS represent a key
technology [4]. Despite promising expectations, the technology
has not yet been signiﬁcantly established in the industry.
Companies mainly criticize the lack of reproducible use cases
[5][6]. Since the beginning of the boom of the technology,
a whole series of application scenarios have been advertised.
Based on these examples, which were often tailored to speciﬁc
sectors and ﬁelds of application, many companies could not
derive their own beneﬁts and lead in-memory techniques to
fruition. According to a study by the consulting company
Pierre Audoin Consultants [7], many companies see great
potential in the technology, yet there are only a few cases
where the beneﬁts are exploited extensively. This is interesting
in contrast to the expectations put on the technology to create
business value along all steps of the value chain. This accounts
for a vertical as well as a horizontal integration. In addition to
these open issues in the corporate sector, there is a clear need
for a generalizable reference model to analyze and evaluate in-
memory scenarios [8][9] from a scientiﬁc perspective. Hence, a
universal evaluation tool is needed to determine whether IMIS
are beneﬁcial or not suited in a speciﬁc scenario and vice versa.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the
research background, the existing literature in the ﬁeld of IMIS
and the overall structure of the framework. Section III presents
the research methodology including the analytic hierarchy
process (AHP) and the direct ranking method (DRM). In
Section IV the application of the framework is shown. The
ﬁnal section summarizes the contributions of this work.

RESEARCH BACKGROUND
For a better understanding of the evaluation framework it
is necessary to gain a deeper understanding of the technical
characteristics of IMIS. The idea of using main memory for
the storage of data goes back to the 1980’s [10] and 1990’s
[11]. Caused by the high costs and relatively low storage sizes
IMIS were basically a niche technology in the past years.
With the introduction of the SAP HANA platform [12], the
technology experienced some kind of a comeback. Originally,
the SAP HANA platform was developed for accelerated and
ﬂexible analysis of large data sets. This new generation of
IMIS includes a totally different storage concept in comparison
to relational databases. The data in In-Memory systems is

mainly stored in a column-based manner [13]. The advantage
is a better data compression [14]. At the same time a column
oriented data storage suits better for analytical tasks [15].
The difference between column and row based data storage
is shown in Figure 1.

In the recent years, the focus on analytical tasks has
been extended to hybrid IT-systems. The idea is to store the
operational and analytical data entirely in a main memory
database [16][17][18]. These hybrid systems are referred to as
Online Mixed Workload Processing (OLXP) [19] and Hybrid
Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP) [20]. Through a
common data storage expansive and time consuming extract,
transform, load (ETL) processes from the transactional into
the analytical system are no longer necessary [15]. As a result,
operational data can be used for analysis without major time
delays [21].
Due to the different characteristics of analytical and opera-
tional tasks, problems and difﬁculties arise for hybrid systems.
The column-based storage of data was originally designed for
read-oriented and read-only analysis tasks. A higher proportion
of write access typically characterizes operational systems, i.e.,
enterprise resource planning systems [22], [23]. The merging
of these two approaches is often associated with complex join
procedures [24][25]. In read-oriented environments, this can
reduce the achievable performance improvement promised by
IMIS.
A. Problem Context and Related Work
The majority of the early publications in the ﬁeld of IMIS
were characterized by the strong focus on rather technical
aspects. To a great proportion, only technical features, such
as the column-based storage of data [13], data compression
[14] or the persistence of volatile storage media [26] were
investigated. The dominance of technical investigations illus-
trates the strong technologically driven development. Despite
its potential, only few studies about the evaluation of IMIS
use cases have been published to date. Investigations in the
intersection between technology and corporate context have
shown that the use of IMIS is not suitable for every application.
The speed advantages in comparison to traditional relational
databases are related to the number of users and the workload
characteristics [27].
The ﬁrst studies in this ﬁeld have been carried out by Piller
and Hagedorn [8][28][29]. The authors evaluated ﬁrst case
studies in the retail sector. The case studies were evaluated with
the aid of various inﬂuencing factors. Based on the factors,
ﬁrst application patterns were derived. Another approach to
characterize and classify In-memory systems was presented
by Winter et al. [30]. They identiﬁed stereotypical patterns
based on the data volume and the degree of hybrid work-
load. An alternative approach for the analysis of In-memory
applications addresses the business process characteristics of
IMIS use cases. Pioneers in this area were vom Brocke et
al. [31][32][33]. They developed a value-creation oriented
model, which considers ﬁrst- as well as second-order effects.
They conclude that the value-creation is closely related to
process change. The evaluation of several IMIS use cases
by B¨arenf¨anger et al. [34] conﬁrmed this results. Cunduis
et al. [35][36] considered IMIS from a workﬂow perspective
and developed a framework for the value creation. Another
approach focuses on the cost beneﬁt effects of IMIS. In this
context, Meier et al. developed a model for the economic
evaluation of IMIS. Like vom Brocke et al. they distinguish
between direct and indirect beneﬁts. Another work following
a cost-beneﬁt perspective can be found in [37].
In their publication, [38] Ulbricht et al. introduce a frame-
work combining the ﬁndings of the scientiﬁc approaches with
practical issues from companies and IMIS system vendors.
They presented a structured model for the evaluation and
analysis of IMIS use cases, taking various factors into account.
Despite the different focuses, one thing all approaches have in
common. They all consider the characteristics of IMIS use
cases from a quite abstract level. The degree of dissemination
in individual sectors, however, indicates the different impor-
tance of the particular inﬂuencing factors. The question arises,
why this technology has already been used quite frequently in
some sectors and is hardly ever noticed in other areas.
B. Approach
As mentioned before, the evaluation and analysis of IMIS
use cases is a complex, multi-criteria decision problem. In
order to represent and solve this problem the concept of the
multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) is used. This model
allows to consider both, the system requirements as well as
the corresponding importance. To determine the total utility
U, the weighted sum model (1) of the MCDM [39] is applied.
In this model, the system requirements are represented as xi
and the signiﬁcance (importance) as wi.
U =
n
X
i=1
wixi
(1)
The creation of the framework follows the concept of the
design science research [40]. A fundamental requirement of
this approach is the proof of the relevance of the developed
artifact [41]. The created artifact in this work is represented as
a framework. The overall goal of this framework is the decision
support regarding the use of the In-memory technology. The
relevance of our investigation can be conﬁrmed both from a
scientiﬁc and a corporate perspective. In order to meet the
scientiﬁc requirements, the whole design process is based on
proven and context-appropriate methods. The applicability of
the artifact is demonstrated by real use cases. The overall
approach is summarized in Figure 2.
In order to provide a better complexity handling, we
characterize the several inﬂuence factors and bring them into a
hierarchy in the ﬁrst step. In the second step, we select suitable
methods for the determination of the signiﬁcance depending
on the characteristics of the inﬂuence factors. The different

characteristics of the factors lead to a trade off between the
operability of the methods and the quality of the results. In
the ﬁnal step, we reveal the results of the utility methods
and evaluate the overall framework based on 10 case studies.
In this part, we demonstrate the feasibility of our concept
by evaluating potential and existing IMIS use cases. Both
practical and theoretical aspects are considered in the presented
approach. The several steps of the design process are presented
in the following sections.
III.
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
After the basic features of the framework have been
described in the previous section, the question arises how
the respective relevance regarding the evaluation of IMIS is
represented. To consider all relevant aspects of an IT invest-
ment decision process it is necessary to extend the existing
IMIS model by an additional weighting factor. The disjunctive
characteristics of the inﬂuence factors demand the selection
of appropriate weighting methods. Therefore, the decision
model was subdivided into a operationalisable goal hierarchy.
The categorization as well as the selection process of the
corresponding weighting methods is explained in the following
part.
A. Characterization and Categorization of the Inﬂuence Fac-
tors
In [2], DeLone et al. divided the inﬂuencing variables of
information systems into success dependent and independent.
Analogous to this approach we categorized the inﬂuence
factors in our framework into value-creation dependent and
independent. The categorization is presented in the following
section. The starting point of the considered inﬂuence factors
is the IMIS evaluation model from Ulbricht et al. [38]. An
overview of the extended framework is given in Figure 3.
Value-creation-dependent inﬂuence factors
This category includes the factors, which are crucial for
the creation of an economic beneﬁt. Due to the strong impact
on the business success, they are particularly important for
corporate decisions. These factors comprise the internal as well
as the external realization conditions, e.g., the capability to
realize the results from the IT-system in an appropriate time.
Another inﬂuence factor in this category is the potential beneﬁt
regarding the use of IMIS. This means value-creation through
faster data processing or more detailed analysis. In most cases,
business value is the most important decision criteria for
companies. In this consideration, this point also includes non-
monetary beneﬁts and second-level effects like an improved
customer satisfaction. In addition to these stakeholder-oriented
factors, this category also includes technical aspects, which are
related to the value-creation. These include, for example, the
frequency of change and the range of variation. One of the
probably most important advantages of IMIS is the capability
of fast data processing. Expert interviews and case studies in
this area have shown, however, that the requirements regarding,
e.g., the urgency vary signiﬁcantly between different business
areas. In order to achieve independence of the factors, it is
important that the potential value generation is considered
independent of the other factors. The independence of the
decision factors is the prerequisite for the application of
methods for the assessment of alternatives[42].
Value-creation-independent inﬂuence factors
This category includes factors which are of minor im-
portance from a solely business perspective. This means that
these factors have no direct relation to the value-creation. An
economically oriented decision maker is in most cases not
interested in the underlying data volume or the data structure.
On the other hand, these factors play a very important role
for the technical evaluation of In-Memory systems. In order
to consider all relevant aspects for the evaluation, company
representatives, scientists as well as IMIS vendors are involved
in the determination of these factors.
B. Method Selection
The determination of weights in the context of infor-
mation systems have already been the subject of numerous
research projects. There exists a plenty of methods to deﬁne
the relevance of decision alternatives. The challenge for the
determination of the weightings is the complexity of the inves-
tigated inﬂuencing factors in this work. Caused by the distinct
characteristics of the factors it is necessary to select appropriate
methods for the particular categories. The speciﬁcation of
the value creation dependent weighting factors require the
involvement of corporate representatives with a comprehensive
understanding of the business processes. As already mentioned
in the previous section the signiﬁcance vary according to the
regarded use case. This results in the requirement that the
selected method should be easy to use and time-efﬁcient. The
value creation independent factors, are determined by technical
experts in the ﬁeld of IMIS. For these factors, however, other
properties and corresponding requirements apply. In order to
obtain reliable results it is necessary to avoid inconsistencies.
At the same time, the method should be proven and well
applicable. In the following section the most common proce-
dures are presented and evaluated regarding to their suitability
regarding the described requirements.
Direct Rating Method
The direct rating method [43] is a rather straight forward
rating method and is applicable to almost every objective
target. Given a discrete objective, the direct rating method
assignes a value directly to each relevant result xi of a discrete
or nominal target size. In order to keep the evaluation effort
manageable, possible alternatives are determined ﬁrst. In the
next step all possible result values are ordered in respect to

the given target objective. The lowest result is assigned the
lowest value of usually 0 points and the best or highest value is
assigned 100 points. For all other result values in between the
lowest and highest value, the person evaluating has to assign
utility values in order to reﬂect the pre deﬁned order. There are,
however, some issues with this method since there is virtually
no support given to the evaluating person on how to assign the
actual values. Researchers argue that the direct rating method
is more a backup method and should only be used in cases
of missing alternatives [42]. If a direct assignment is difﬁcult,
e.g., for subjective target objectives such as image or taste,
proxy attributes should be considered.
Point Allocation Method
In the point allocation method, the decision maker has
a given budget of points. The points are assigned to the
alternatives and reﬂect the relative importance. For example,
the decision maker may be asked to assign 100 points between
four alternatives that are relevant to a particular decision. With
this method the weights do not have to be normalized since
the sum of all assignments has to be 100 points [44]. There
is, however, a drawback in the assignment process [45]. In
contrast to other methods where the decision maker will assign
the value of 100 points to the best alternative and will derive
the importante or value of the other alternatives by relating to
100 points, there is no such ﬁxing point in the Point Allocation
Method. Especially if there are many options or alternatives,
this classiﬁcation can be difﬁcult. This is because, for example,
if the sum of 100 is exceeded, all assessments must be adjusted.
In contrast, the assessment of single alternative of the direct
rating method has no effect on all other assessments. Jia et
al. [46] showed that the point allocation and the direct rating
method lead to heterogenious results in terms of the decsion
weights when applied in practice.
SWING
As part of algebraic methods, the SWING method was
introduced by von Winterfeldt and Edwards [47]. It requires
the decision maker to make a cardinal assessments of fully
deﬁned (hypothetical) alternatives. In a ﬁrst step the decision
maker deﬁnes the null alternative x with all possible attribute
values set to the worst possible value. In the next step, possible
alternatives yi, i = 1..n with different attribute values are
deﬁned or extracted from the problem context. During a survey
the respondent is asked to order all alternatives. The best
alterantive y1 is assigned 100 points and the null alternative
x is assigned 0 points. Now the respondent is asked to assign
points to all other alternatives y2..yn. In order to determine
scale factors, the points of the second best alternative y2
shall reﬂect the percentage of the perceived use gain if the
respondent swings from the null alternative x to the alternative
yi. The best alternative y1 was already pre-deﬁned with 100
points. Normalized factors are derived through dividing each
scale factor by the sum of all scale factors.
To assign atribute weights, the respondent is asked which
attribute the respondent would like to change from worst
to best, based on the null alternative x. Subsequently, the
respondent is asked which attribute should be changed in the
next step, until all attributes are assessed. One possible way
to determine attribute weights is to set the 100 points to the
highest ranked (ordered) attribute and aks the respondent to
assign points to all remaining attributes as a scale of 100 points
reﬂecting their importance. Edwards et al. [48] note that it is
important to cross check the results with trade off questions,
especially when cost is a possible attribute.
Direct Ranking Method
The direct ranking procedure is one of the simplest methods
to determine the importance of attributes. At the same time,
this method produces the least accurate results of the weight
determination methods. In practical environments, the direct
ranking is frequently used because of its simple and fast
applicability. Compared to other procedures, it is not possible

224

to check the consistency or plausibility of the answers. The
evaluation is carried out by assigning ordinal scaled preference
values. In our framework, we use a range from 1 to 10 for the
scale. Due to the normalization of the values, the range of the
scale is of minor importance. The weighting of the particular
factors is obtained by dividing the individual preferences pi
by the total sum of the preferences. The equation for the
determination of the weighting is shown in (2).

(2)
In spite of the missing methodological variety the direct
ranking method suits well for the usage in corporate environ-
ments due to its simple applicability. For these reasons, this
method was selected for the determination of the value-creation
dependent inﬂuence factors. To determine the independent
parameters more complex methods are necessary.
Analytic Hierarchy Process
The analytic hierarchy process, developed by Saaty [49],
is a widely used method for multi-criteria decision problems.
This method has been applied in comparable research projects
like the selection of enterprise resource planning [50] or the
selection of software as a service products [51]. It uses a
pairwise comparison of the alternatives to determine ratios
and scale priorities. Each factor is compared with every
other factor. This kind of comparison improves the decision
making within sophisticated problems. On the other hand, with
numerous alternatives this leads to an increasing complexity.
To reduce this, the alternatives are divided into hierarchies in
the AHP. A major advantage with this method is the built-
in ability to check the results for inconsistencies. Through
the avoidance of inconsistent answers, it is possible to obtain
better results in a qualitative manner. However, this requires an
increased degree of attention from the participants of a study.
Despite the relatively simple use of pairwise comparisons,
the AHP method can produce reliable results. Due to the high
complexity and the high demands placed on the participants,
this procedure is only suitable to a limited extent for the uti-
lization in companies. This method was selected to determine
the weightings of the value-creation independent factors.
IV.
APPLICATION OF THE FRAMEWORK
In this section, we present application examples of our
IMIS evaluation Framework. In the ﬁrst part, we determine
the weightings of the inﬂuence factors, applying the direct
ranking method and the AHP. Afterwards, we demonstrate the
results of the case studies. For the evaluation of the framework
we conducted and analyzed 10 case studies. Thereby, a wide
range of companies were involved. This includes, for example,
a smaller IT service provider, a medium-sized online travel
provider up to a large retailing company. The characteristics
of the investigated use cases are shown in Table I. Aimed
by the characteristics the evaluation process becomes more
comprehensible.
A. Weightings for the Value-Creation Dependent Factors
To determine the business-related signiﬁcance of the value-
creation dependent factors, it was necessary to include only
experts with an appropriate extent of knowledge in the ﬁeld of
data analytics. Therefore, we asked senior corporate represen-
tatives in analytic-aware IT positions to rank the importance of
each IMIS inﬂuence factor. The application of our framework
is shown in more detail based on 3 selected use cases. The
sample use cases have been chosen considering their business
and technical characteristics. In doing so, it is possible to
illustrate all aspects of a IMIS use case evaluation. The
resulting weightings of the use cases are shown in Table II.
It becomes clear that the signiﬁcance of the inﬂuence
factors vary only a bit in the analysis and data categories. Sig-
niﬁcant differences can be seen within the economic factors.
As expected, the potential added value is the most important
attribute. Nevertheless, the weightings varies quite strongly.
The relatively high inﬂuence of the other factors illustrates the
need for an overall assessment.
B. Weightings for the Value-Creation Independent Factors
As already mentioned in Section III-B, the mainly techno-
logically driven factors are more complex in their examination.
A one-sided investigation from a business perspective does not
cover all relevant aspects. It is necessary to involve a broad
ﬁeld of knowledge and experience in this consideration. For
this reason, we have included business experts, scientists and
experts from system providers to determine these factors. The
involved corporate representatives originated from the high-
tech industry, the retail sector and online retailing. All these
branches are characterized by their high demands regarding
the data processing. The representatives have been selected
according to their knowledge and experiences in the area of
data analytics. The scientiﬁc experts were selected from the
related work in the context of IMIS. To avoid a technical
bias in the investigation the participants from the IMIS system
vendors have both, knowledge in the development of such
systems but also experiences with the practical application and
the customer needs.
A strength of the AHP method is the possibility to detect
inconsistent answers. In overall the AHP process includes four
phases: the decomposition, the comparative judgements, the
determination of priorities and the consistency checking. For
a better comprehensibility the proceeding of the AHP as well
as an extraction of the results are explained in the following
part:
Decomposition
During the decompensation, the underlying decision prob-
lem is subdivided into a hierarchical goal system. This step
reduces the complexity of the decision-making process. In
our example the decomposition is already done through the
structuring of the framework into analysis, data and economic
factors. Additionally, the elements of the categories were
subdivided into value creation dependent and independent.
Comparative Judgements
In the second step the decision criteria are compared
pairwise. This comparison is based on a 1 to 9 scale. Where
a rating of 1 indicates the equal importance of the considered
criteria and a score of 9 indicates the absolute dominance of an
attribute over the other. The further meanings of the judgement
scale can be found in Table III.
The result of the pairwise comparison is a matrix A with the
relative importance of the criterias. In the case of the evaluation

Determination of Priorities
For the calculation of the weights the results of the
comparison (matrix A) are initially normalized. Thereby, the
values are divided by the sum of the respective column values.
Formally this relation is shown in (3). In Table V, the results
of the calculations are demonstrated based on the continued
example. Thereby, it becomes clear that the weightings reﬂect

Calculation of the Consistency
The possibility to detect inconsistent answers helps to
ensure the quality of the results. Judgements of persons are of-
ten not completely consistent. Especially in complex decision
situations the individual judgements do not conform perfectly.
The AHP method includes techniques for the detection of
contradictory answers. The consistency ratio (CR) calculates
the relation between the consistency index (CI) of the matrix
and the random index (RI). The equation for the calculation of
the consistency index as well as the results of the continued
example from the part before can be seen below. The term
λmax represents thereby the maximum eigenvalue of the
matrix A [52].
CI = (λmax − n)
n − 1
(7)
CI = (3.039 − 3)
3 − 1
= 0.0195
(8)
In the ﬁnal step, the consistency ratio is calculated. The
included term RI is an consistency index for randomly chosen
results. It is assumed that the random results are highly
inconsistent. The consistency ratio thus compares the quality
of the examined example with the quality of arbitrary results.
The corresponding values for RI are provided by Saaty in [53],
as shown in Table VI.

The unanimous opinion about the consistency is that only
answers with a consistency ratio lower or equal 0.1 are con-
sidered. In the example shown equation (10), the consistency
ratio is about 0.034 and thus can be accepted. Throughout the
investigation in overall two data sets had to be revised, due to
the exceeding of the consistency ratio.

The aggregated results of the AHP in Table VII reveal that
for the evaluation of the value-creation independent analysis
factors the complexity of analysis and the hybrid workload
have the main impact. The amount of source systems is in this
context only of minor importance. A more notable tendency
can be seen between the data volume and the data complexity.
The results of this category show, that the signiﬁcance of
the data volume is much higher in comparison to the data
complexity.

C. Evaluation Examples
In the following part, we will apply and interprete the
results of the IMIS framework based on three selected use
cases. The ﬁrst chosen example comes from an early adopter
of IMIS systems. The analysis of point of sales data in the retail
section is one of the ﬁrst examples in this area. The company
participating in our case study is a leading retailer in Germany.
For reasons of space and legibility we only show some key
attributes of the example. The major goal for the use of an
IMIS was the analysis of sales and inventory ﬁgures. The use
case demands, besides current sales ﬁgures, the consideration
of ﬂuctuations due to promotions as well as external inﬂuences,
like the weather conditions. The example is characterized
by a high demand regarding the urgency, data volume and
the complexity of analysis. The extensive and unpredictable
variations of the sales ﬁgures require a very fast recognition
of anomalies. The calculation includes transactional as well as
analytical tasks. Despite, the rare and minor data changes the
overall assessment of the data requirements is quite high. This
is due to the extremely high volume of data combined with the
high weight of this category. The economic evaluation reveal
that the most important obstacle concerning the realization of
the potential added value is the long implementation duration.
The second example is a real-time reporting case from the
insurance sector and is characterized by very high requirements
in the analysis as well as in the data area. For this use case,
it is necessary that the results are based on up-to-date data
and are processed in near real-time. The analyzes are based
on large amounts of data directly from the transaction system.
The case is characterized by high demands in terms of urgency,
degree of detail and the complexity of the analysis. The same
accounts for the data factors, showing a extreme high data
volume, frequent changes in the data, high effects of the data
change and strong changes in the range of variations. From an
economic point of view, this case is characterized by a very
high added value and a high target group willingness. There are
neither internal nor external obstacles that avoid the realization
of the results. For these reasons, this example is assessed very
high in all categories.
The last example shows very clearly the diverging signif-
icance of the inﬂuencing factors. The use case comes from
a supplier company in the medical ﬁeld. This company uses
IMIS to improve their ﬁnancial and controlling reports. Despite
relatively small changes to the data base, it is important that
the data is up-to-date and the results of the analyzes are
available very quickly. In comparison to the other use cases,
the overall technical requirements are on a lower level. The
same is true for the economical factors. Especially the high
legal regimentation stiﬂe/obstruct the economical assessment.
For a better clarity and easier interpretation, we assigned
the results of the use case evaluation to a portfolio chart (Figure
4). This chart is comparable to the strategic portfolio matrix
of the Boston Consulting Group [54]. The advantage of this
representation is the possibility to have a visual indicator for
the evaluation of the complex underlying decision problem.
The dimensions of the chart are based on the categories of
the presented framework. The analysis and data requirements
built the axes of the chart. The radius of the data points reﬂect
the economical assessment. The chart is an easy to use tool to
indicate promising use cases. The provided example is based
on the assessment of 10 use cases, as seen in Table I.
As mentioned at the beginning of this contribution the total
utility is calculated using the weighted sum model (11) of the
multi-criteria decision making. The calculations of the ﬁnal
metrics is shown for the analysis requirements of use case 1.
The weightings are based on the results from the direct ranking
and the AHP method (see Sections IV-A and IV-B). The system
requirements (xi) are represented by the results of the use
case assessment (as seen in Table I). For the calculation, the
assessment have been decoded. The answers are based on a
ordinal scale and therefore they can be easily transformed. The
sample calculation is shown in (11).
UA = 0.62 × (0.31 × 3 + 0.42 × 5 + 0.27 × 3)
+0.38 × (0.42 × 4 + 0.44 × 5 + 0.14 × 4)
= 4.21
(11)
An interpretation of the calculation only makes sense in
comparison to the other results. The visualization indicates
that the evaluation of the use cases is quite diverse. The use
case Finance Reporting for instance, may be characterized
by a rather low economical assessment on one side, having
medium to low data and analytical requirements on the other
side. Although an evaluation of a use case scenario is still
subjective to the decision maker’s assumptions and weights,
the chart provides a tool to either choose, rule out or change

possible use cases. This may also lead to the decision to
only use IMIS in parts of the originally planned scenario
or to switch to substitute technologies. The process of the
application scenario deﬁnition, which could be a repetitive
process, is also supported by the framework.
V.
CONCLUSION
Recent research as well as practical applications of In-
memory systems have shown a research gap concerning the
structured consideration of IMIS use cases. The aim of this
work was the development of a ﬂexible framework for the
evaluation of IMIS use cases. Previous IMIS examples have
shown a varying importance of the individual inﬂuencing
factors. To address these variations the decision factors were
subdivided into the categories value-creation dependent and
value-creation independent. The methods for the determination
of the weightings were selected according to these categories
and the characteristics of the factors. The weightings of the
value creation dependent attributes are determined by the direct
ranking method for each investigated use case. For the weight-
ings of the technology oriented, value creation independent
factors the analytic hierarchy process was applied. In order to
map all factors and their signiﬁcance to the additive model of
the multi-criteria decision making was applied. The presented
framework allows to examine existing, as well as exemplary
future use cases with regard to the inﬂuence factors of In-
memory based IT systems. The approach considers both, the
system requirements and their corresponding importance. This
enables decision-makers to investigate IMIS scenarios for their
application potential.
In future work, the framework should be extended to other
industries. A broad selection framework is also conceivable
that shows reasonable conditions for the use of the In-memory
technology. With the aid of the framework, catalogs could be
created for suitable and tested application scenarios.
