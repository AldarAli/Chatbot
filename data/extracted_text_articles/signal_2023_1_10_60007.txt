Abstract—The main goal of this paper is the evaluation of the 
potential of Fisher-Shannon statistical method applied to 
MODIS evapotranspiration satellite time series to explore the 
inner time dynamics of vegetation cover. In particular, we 
focused on two types of vegetation areas, peri-urban parks and 
olive orchards. For the first, we selected five sites in Italy, one 
of which (Castel Volturno) is affected by Toumeyella 
Parvicornis, a parasite that has been adversely impacting the 
Pinus trees of that area in the recent years. For the second, we 
selected seven sites in Southern Italy, four of which are 
affected by Xylella Fastidiosa, considered one of the most 
dangerous phytopathogenic bacteria in the world. For all the 
investigated sites, to remove the trend and seasonal variability, 
we firstly applied the Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA); then, 
we analysed the de-trended series by means of the Fisher-
Shannon statistical method, which combines the Shannon 
Entropy Power (SEP) and the Fisher Information Measure 
(FIM). In the Fisher-Shannon Information Plane (FSIP), the 
infected vegetated areas appear well characterized by the 
lowest FIM and the highest SEP. These preliminary results 
seem to envisage the usefulness of the Fisher-Shannon method 
as a reliable statistical tool to be included in an operational 
system for early diagnosis of status of deterioration of 
vegetation.

 INTRODUCTION 
With the worsening of climate change and the increasing 
of global trade, plant diseases have been accelerating in 
outbreaking and spreading out. Invasive pests and alien plant 
bacteria are considered one of the major threats worldwide, 
because they can induce serious plant diseases with 
devastating impacts on both natural ecosystems and 
agriculture production with huge environmental (loss of 
biodiversity) and economic damage. For instance, Xylella 
Fastidiosa, considered one of the most dangerous plant 
bacteria in the world, causes a number of devasting diseases 
of significant economic importance in many crops as, but not 
only, grapevine, Citrus, Olive trees etc.  As an example, in 
the EU only considering the impact on olive trees, it has been 
estimated that this bacterium has the potential of causing an 
annual production loss of 5.5 billion euros, affecting 70% of 
the EU production value of older olive trees. Thus, detecting, 
quantifying and identifying plant diseases is extremely 
crucial for assessing tempestive measures to contrast them 
[1].

have been gaining special attention in monitoring vegetation 
dynamics resulting, among the others, from plant diseases

[2]. Several RS applications in phytopathology have been 
focused on the development of methodologies based on 
multi-temporal 
and 
multi-spectral 
satellite 
data 
for 
monitoring land-cover changes. Statistical approaches, such 
as principal component analysis [3] and curve fitting 
methods [4], are well known for detecting vegetation 
changes of land surface. 
In this paper, we present a statistical approach, namely 
the Fisher-Shannon (FS) method, to capture evidence of the 
presence of plant diseases. The FS method relies on the 
informational content of a time series and, in our case, is 
used 
to 
analyse 
the 
time 
dynamics 
of 
MODIS 
Evapotranspiration (ET) satellite data of different vegetation 
covers, affected by Toumeyella Parvicornis and by Xylella 
Fastidiosa.

The MODIS ET product is based on the logic of the 
Penman-Monteith equation, which includes inputs of daily 
meteorological 
reanalysis 
data 
along 
with 
satellite 
information. It is expected that ET will suitably characterize 
and capture the impact of plant infected by Toumeyella 
Parvicornis and by Xylella Fastidiosa, since one of the 
recognizable effects is that the plant dries up and dies.

DATA AND METHODS 
For the purpose of this study, five peri-urban parks in 
Italy were selected, Milano, Torino, Appia, Castel Porziano 
and Castel Volturno, the last one attacked by the Toumeyella 
Parvicornis since 2015. Furthermore, seven olive orchard 
areas were selected, Foggia, Potenza, Matera, X2013, 
X2015, X2016 and X2017, the last four located in Southern 
Apulia and infected by Xylella Fastidiosa in different periods 
from 2013 to 2017 (Figure 1). For each site, one MODIS-
based ET time series was obtained by averaging the ET 
values of all the 500m resolution pixels covering each 
investigated site. The sampling time of the MODIS ET 
satellite data is 8 days. Some examples of the analysed 
MODIS ET time series are shown in Figure 2. 
The statistical approach used in investigating the data is 
composed by two steps: the singular spectrum analysis and 
the Fisher-Shannon method, described in the following 
subsections. 
A. Singular Spectrum Analysis 
The decomposition of a time series into independent 
components can be performed by using several techniques, 
among which the Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) [5] 
represents an efficient and well-known tool based on phase-
lagged copies of the series. 
 The independent components obtained by means of the 
SSA can be easily recognizable as slowly changing trend, 
oscillatory components and structureless noise [6]. 
Let us consider a time series yi (i =1, .., N) and a lag M, 
then the Toeplitz lagged correlation matrix can be 
constructed:

Sorting its eigenvalues λk in decreasing order, the 
corresponding eigenvectors Ek,j  where j and k vary from 1 to 
M, are used to calculate the k-th principal component i

for M≤i≤N-M+1. Since the eigenvalue λk represents the 
fraction of the total variance of the original series explained 
in k-th reconstructed component Rk, the decreasing order of 
the eigenvalues also reflects the decreasing order of the 
reconstructed components by the fraction of the total 
variance of the series [7]. SSA requires that the lag M is 
properly selected, on the base of a trade-off between the 
quantity of information extracted (large M) and the degree of 
statistical conﬁdence in that information (large ratio N/M). 
Khan and Poskitt [8] calculated the maximum M = (log N)c, 
1.5 ≤ c ≤ 2.5.

is used to separate the series into two parts that we can 
define as trend and detrended series; λk are the eigenvalues, p 
is the number of eigenvalues, identical to M, and N is the 
length of the original series. The separation occurs at the 
value of k ∈{0, 1, 2, …, p-1} for which the MDL is 
minimized. 
B. Fisher-Shannon method 
The informational properties of a time series can be 
analysed by the Fisher Information Measure (FIM) and the 
Shannon entropy (SE) that quantify respectively the local 
and global smoothness of the distribution of a series. The 
FIM and SE can be utilized for characterizing the complexity 
of non-stationary time series described in terms of order and 
organization [10]. The FIM measures the order and 
organization of the series, and the SE its uncertainty or 
disorder [11]. The FIM and SE are defined by the following 
formulae:

where f(x) is the distribution of the series x. Instead of 
SE, it is generally used the Shannon entropy power (SEP) NX 
, 
(
(7) 
 
that is defined positive. FIM and NX are not independent 
of each other due to the isoperimetric inequality FIM⋅NX≥D 
[12], where D is the dimension of the space (1 for time 
series). 
FIM and NX depend on f(x), whose accurate estimation is 
crucial to obtain reliable values of informational quantities. 
For calculating FIM and NX we applied the kernel-based 
approach that is better than discrete-based approach in 
estimating the probability density function [13]. Thus 
applying the kernel density estimator method for f(x) [14],

f(x) is estimated by means of an optimized integrated 
procedure using the algorithms of Troudi et al. [16] and

Due to the isoperimetric inequality, the Fisher-Shannon 
information plane (FSIP), which has the NX as x-axis and 
FIM as y-axis, represents a very useful tool to investigate the 
complexity of time dynamics of signals [18]. For scalar 
signals, the curve FIM∙NX=1 separates the FSIP into two 
parts, and each signal can be represented by a point located 
only in the space FIM∙NX>1.

RESULTS 
The SSA requires that the phase lag M is selected to 
capture the main periodicities of the series. Thus, we firstly 
calculated the power spectrum of each ET time series (Figure 
2) and identified the annual cycle as the main periodicity. 
 Thus, to detect at least the annual cycle, M was set as 46, 
consistently with the sampling time of the data, which is 8 
days. As an example, Figure 4 and Figure 5 show the 
application of the SSA to the ET time series of two sites. 
After normalized the series, the SSA eigenvalue spectrum λ 
was obtained along with the reconstructed components; each 
eigenvalue represents the contribution of the corresponding 
component to the total variance of the original series. The 
behaviour of the reconstructed components varies from 
oscillatory trend with amplitude modulation to seemingly 
noisy. Applying the MDL criterion the signal is separated 
into a trend and a de-trended series; the value of kmin 
corresponding to the minimum MDL represents the number 
of the first reconstructed components to sum up for obtaining 
the trend. For the series Foggia, for instance, kmin=9; thus, the 
trend is obtained summing up the first 9 reconstructed 
components and the de-trended series by subtracting the 
trend from the original normalized series. Table I and Table 
II show the SSA parameters (phase lag M and kmin) used for 
each time series.  
The trend is featured by an oscillatory behaviour and 
represents the seasonal cycles of meteo-climatic origin. The 
de-trended series, although apparently noisy, represents the 
inner time dynamics of the series that might not be 
influenced by external driving mechanisms. Thus, since our 
aim is the characterization of the time dynamics of inner 
vegetation by using the Fisher-Shannon method, for each site 
we analysed the de-trended series. Figure 6 and Figure 7 
show the FSIP of de-trended MODIS ET time series of the 
peri-urban parks and the olive orchard areas, respectively. 
The FSIP indicates that among the peri-urban parks Castel 
Volturno that is effectively attacked by the Toumeyella 
Parvicornis is characterized by the lowest FIM and the 
highest SEP. Among the olive orchards, the four sites 
X2013, X2015, X2016 and X2017 that were infected by 
Xylella Fastidiosa occupy the bottom-right part of the FSIP, 
indicating a higher level of disorder and lower level of 
organization of the vegetation index, similarly to Castel 
Volturno.

DISCUSSION 
The fatality rate for both Toumeyella Parvicornis 
(affecting pines) and Xylella Fastidiosa (affecting olive 
orchads)  is as high as 100%, and their early detection is the 
critical issue to eradicate the disease and stop tree mortality. 
Therefore, the main question is how to quickly find the 
infected trees? 
From the operational point of view, the existing solutions 
are only based on in situ analysis and visual inspection, and,

therefore, are not suitable to identify early signals of plant 
diseases not visible at a naked eye.  
Earth Observation (EO) technologies  provide, instead,  
imaging beyond the visible and therefore much more 
information than those obtained solely from the ground.  
Moreover, EO undoubtly offer cost-effective tools for 
monitoring wide areas at both local and global scale.  
Nevertheless, previous studies based on satellite EO or 
drone surveys did not utilize analyses of long term time 
series that enabled the identification of early signals of 
degradation. Moreover, the use of evapotranspiration time 
series as proxy indicator of plant conditions also improved 
the early detection capability (and facilitate the forecasting of 
pest outbreak) that is the critical issue to eradicate destructive 
disease and pest infestations, as those from  both for Xylella  
and Toumeyella Parvicornis. 
There is a strong requirement for reliable operational 
tools for multiscale, multi-sensor, multi-temporal monitoring 
of biophysical parameters relating to the state of vegetation 
to assess and monitor land degradation and capture early 
signs of both degradation productivity declines and related 
temporal dynamics that often precede tree mortality years to 
decades before death. In more details, the following tasks 
would be useful to implement: i) setting up of EO-based 
metrics/indicators suitable for an early diagnosis of 
vegetation deterioration trends to improve ability to forecast 
tree disease and mortality  from local up  global scale; ii) 
effective satellite-based near real time monitoring of forest 
disease and pest damage for the development of prevention 
and control strategies.

CONCLUSIONS 
The vegetation of several study areas from the North to 
the Southern part of Italy was analysed. The study areas were 
peri-urban parks and olive orchards. The peri-urban parks 
were selected as key in improving environmental quality, 
being rich in biodiversity and allowing urban areas to be 
more sustainable, helping to combat climate change and 
make cities more comfortable. The olive orchards were 
selected as extremely important for the economy of Southern 
Italy; in fact, Apulia (were some of the investigated sites are 
located) accounts for about 40% of Italy’s olive oil 
production. 
Thus, for each site we focused on the SSA de-trended 
series since this represents the inner time dynamics of the 
vegetation. 
Our findings point out to the following results: (i) the 
trend of each series is characterized by an oscillatory 
behaviour that might be linked with the meteo-climatic 
cycles, (ii) the de-trended series, although apparently noisy, 
might be not influenced by external driving mechanisms; (iii) 
among the investigated peri-urban parks, Castel Volturno, 
and among the olive orchards, X2013, X2015, X2016 and 
X2017 are characterized by the lowest FIM and the highest 
SEP; (iv) Castel Volturno, X2013, X2015, X2016 and 
X2017 share similar phytopathogenic conditions, which is 
induced by Toumeyella Parvicornis for Castel Volturno and 
Xylella Fastidiosa for the remaining four sites; (v) a plant 
disease seems to be well revealed by analysing the 
informational properties of MODIS ET time series.

methodologies able to diagnose the deterioration and 
operational tools for the monitoring of biophysical 
parameters of the status of vegetation.
