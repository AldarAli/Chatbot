Abstract— In the Service Web, a huge number of Web services 
compete to offer similar functionalities from distributed 
locations. Since no Web service is risk free, this paper aims to 
mitigate the risk in service selection using “Follow the Leader” 
principle as a new approach for risk-reducing strategy. First, 
we define the user credibility model based on the “Follow the 
Leader” principle in web-based social networks. Next we show 
how to evaluate the Web service credibility based on its 
trustworthiness and expertise. Finally, we present a dynamic 
selection model to select the best service with the perceived 
performance risk and customer risk-attitude considerations. 
To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the new 
“Follow the Leader” driven approach to alleviate the risk in 
service selection, we used a Social Network Analysis Studio 
(SNAS) to verify the validity of the proposed model. The 
empirical results incorporated in this paper, demonstrate that 
our approach is a significantly innovative approach as risk-
reducing strategy in service selection. 
 
Keywords - Web service selection, credibility assessment, risk, 
web-based social networks, Follow the Leader. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In the Service Web, Web services and Web-Based Social 
Networks will emerge to create an environment where users 
and applications can search and compose services in an 
automatic and seamless manner. The Service Web is 
expected to be a place where a huge number of Web 
services will compete to offer a wide range of similar 
functionalities. It is expected that Web services will fully 
leverage the Semantic Web to outsource part of their 
functionalities to other Web services [1]. In this case, some 
services may not have interacted before, while others may 
act maliciously to be selected. A key requirement is to 
provide trust mechanisms for quality access and retrieval of 
relevant Web services with perceived risk considerations.  
In the Web service selection, reputation assessment 
mechanisms are used to establish trust between Web 
services. The notions of “trust” and “reputation” are both 
used to evaluate an entity’s trustworthiness [2]. Recent 
research [3] shows that a good Web service reputation 
positively affects the consumer's trust and negatively affects 
the consumer's perceived risk. For example, consumers are 
hesitant to transact with a service provider who has a history 
of failing to honor its obligations, whereas it is relatively 
less risky to transact with a vendor who has a history of 
honoring its obligations.  
Web service selection is a complex process where a 
service that best satisfies user preferences is selected from a 
set of candidate services based on user requirements [4] As 
per the selection criteria, various non-functional properties 
such as quality of service (QoS), can be used and expressed 
as user preferences. QoS such as response time, throughput, 
availability, reliability and privacy are difficult for the user 
to determine and control. Users are usually not willing to 
spend time describing their detailed preferences to the 
system. They are even less inclined to assign weights to 
them, especially if they do not have a clear understanding of 
the effects and results of this input. Moreover, users may not 
even be aware of their explicit preferences. Hence, risk-
averse users who want to use Web services often seek help 
from their friends, peers, experts and business partners who 
may have relevant expertise or experiences. 
In this paper, we propose a service selection approach 
based on a credibility framework that models user and Web 
service credibility with Web service perceived risk and user 
risk attitude. Our work is the first that uses a formal “Follow 
the Leader” model [5] based on web-based social networks 
and service credibility to mitigate risk in service selection 
using the most trustworthy and experienced users in the 
social network. 
In order to simplify the paper, we will refer to customers 
/ users as human users, and a Web service as an atomic 
service such as a home loan or a home insurance service. 
The proposed approach can be used as a module of Web 
services personalized recommender system where user 
behavior can be captured from his/her interactions in WBSN.

MOTIVATIONS AND CONTRIBUTATIONS 
Decision making in risky complex situations has always 
been a very difficult task. Traditional decision models for 
Web service selection based on utility only are no longer 
adequate; service selection is more complicated with 
traditional approaches because the consumers may not even 
know with whom they are interacting. 
To illustrate the challenges involved in Web service 
selection we provide the following example, which illustrates 
the key difficulties and at the same time motivates our 
approach.

Motivating Example: 
Bob just moved to the USA. By nature he is a risk-averse 
person. He is seeking an insurance company to insure his 
home. Bob lives in the same area as his friend Adam who 
has already taken out home insurance. This is Bob’s first 
house, and he does not want to spend too much time on 
analyzing insurance features he would rather have the same 
insurance as his friend Adam. What if Bob did not know 
Adam? Can he get reasonable advice from somebody who 
lives in his area? If not, then he would have to embark on 
tedious and time consuming process of differentiating 
between the vast number of home insurance services in 
which all of them may match his request from a functionality 
perspective, but vary in their non-functional properties. 
 Using trust in social networks provides a promising 
approach to make recommendations to other users based on 
trust propagation in finding a friend or a friend of a friend 
with similar interests. However, even when the user relies 
on a trustworthy friend there is still an amount of perceived 
risk to be considered in adopting the Web service 
recommended. The quality of the selected Web service can 
be improved further by assessing its credibility by 
incorporating its trustworthiness and expertise at the same 
time. Our key contribution in this paper is threefold: 
1. A user model with risk-attitude based on user credibility 
that captures trust relationships between users. 
2. A Web service credibility metrics that incorporate 
trustworthiness, expertise and perceived risk. 
3. A Web service selection approach based on the service 
credibility and Follow the Leader to mitigate the 
performance risk in service selection. 
 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section III 
presents a review of some related works. In Section IV we 
propose a credibility based framework, next in Section V we 
model perceived risk and risk attitude in Web service 
selection, followed by simulations. Finally, we conclude by 
summarizing our findings and future plans for further work.

RELATED WORK 
In the following section, we present the synergies which 
are used in our framework.  
A. Web-Based Social Networks and Trust 
Web-based social networks (WBSNs) are online 
communities “people, organizations or other social entities” 
[6] connected by a set of social relationships, such as 
friendship, co-working or information exchange in varied 
contexts e.g., entertainment, religion, dating, or business.  
Over the last few years, interest in social networking 
websites such as MySpace, Twitter and Facebook have 
increased considerably [7]. Hundreds of millions of people 
are members of social networks online and many of those 
networks contain trust data [8]. With access to this 
information, trust has the potential to improve the way 
recommendations are made and services are selected.  
In WBSNs, the trust inference mechanism is becoming a 
critical issue when participants want to establish a new trust 
relation or measure trust values between connected users 
[9]. The idea is to search for trustworthy users by exploiting 
trust propagation [10] over the trust network.  
B. Trust and Risk in Service Selection 
Trust and risk are two tools for making decisions in 
uncertain environments [11]. In such environments, where 
the service consumer often has insufficient information 
about the service provider and the offered services, this 
forces the consumer to accept the risk of prior performance 
[12], i.e., to pay for services before receiving them, which 
can leave her in a vulnerable position. Trust comes into play 
as a solution for the specific problems of risk. Trust 
becomes the crucial strategy for dealing with an uncertain 
and uncontrollable future. So, trust is particularly relevant in 
conditions of ignorance or uncertainty with respect to the 
unknown actions of others. 
There are only a few computational trust models that 
explicitly take risk into account. Studies that combine risk 
and trust include [13] and [11]. In PET, Liang and Shi [13] 
their conclusion highlights that risk is important in 
designing a personalized trust system.  
Trust can be described as a positive state of mind caused 
by the perception that the risk resulting from collaborating 
with the trusted party is acceptable [14]. Trust systems 
enable parties to determine the trustworthiness of 
participating parties. Trust is relevant in situations where 
one must enter into risks but has incomplete control over the 
outcome, hence any act of trusting implies some bet and 
some risk [15]. A recent study [3] concludes that as trust 
increases, consumers are likely to perceive less risk than if 
trust were absent; i.e., the consumer's trust negatively 
affects the consumer's perceived risk of a Web service 
transaction.  
C.  Follow the Leader  
As pointed out by social psychology theory [9], the role 
of a person in a specific domain has significant influences 
on trust evaluation if the person recommends a person or an 
object. Follow the leader in dynamic social networks [5], is 
a formal probabilistic model of opinion formation with 
dynamic confidence in agent-mediated social networks 
where the profiling of agents as leaders or followers is 
possible. An opinion leader is specified as a highly self-
confident agent with strong opinions. According to [5], in a 
social network, a member is either a leader or a follower 
who adopted another leader’s opinion to use a Web service. 
Subsequently this member adopts whatever her best friend 
adopted, otherwise the member has no active friends and 
consequently it acts as an independent user.  
Ramirez-Cano and Pitt [16], define the relationship 
between two agents as a confidence function, such that: “an 
agent (i) increases its confidence in another agent (j) based 
on how well (j’s) opinion meets the criteria specified in i’s 
157

mind-set. A mind-set represents the set of beliefs, attitudes, 
assumptions and tendencies that predetermine the way an 
agent evaluates a received opinion”.  
IV. 
CREDIBILITY BASED FRAMEWORK 
A. Web Based Social Network (WBSN) Interaction Model 
In a WBSN, as shown in Fig. 1, let a set of users 
   , … . , 	    interacting in a set of contexts or 
domains    , … . ,   , such 
as 
categories 
in 
EPINIONS.com. In each domain there is a set of Web 
services (K), such that:    , … . ,   ,    . 
Each user (u ∈ U) rates a set of Web services M denoted 
by:  
   
 , … ,  
 … . ,  
 ,     , and ! 
 " is 
the rating value of user u for Web service Si. The rating 
value can be any real number, but most often ratings are 
integers, e.g., in the range [1, 5]. 
In a trust-aware system, there is also a trust network 
amongst users. We define !# 
$ "  to be the direct trust 
between user u and user v, trust value is a real number in the 
range [0, 1]: 0 means no trust and 1 mean full trust between 
users. 
 
 
Figure 1.  WBSN user interaction model 
B. User Credibility Based Clustering - Follow the Leader 
The “Follow the Leader” model [5], provides us with 
insights to identify users based on their roles in the WBSN 
i.e., either leaders or followers. Enriching the “Follow the 
Leader” model with trust, gives us the potential to analyze 
WBSN based on user’s credibility. Fig. 1 shows the basis of 
our approach. User credibility measure reflects their 
trustworthiness and expertise and provides us with the 
means to identify users’ roles in a specific context. Some 
users can be classified as leaders others can be classified as 
followers according to their credibility level. 
User credibility is a synonym of believability [17]. 
Credibility of an agent can be measured by its 
trustworthiness, expertise, and dynamism [18]. The majority 
of researchers identify two key components of credibility: 
trustworthiness and expertise. In our previous work [19, 20] 
we derived a formula to express user credibility in a WBSN. 
This formula is expressed as: 
 
Cr!'"  α ) Cr* + , β1 ) Cr!#/ 
" ,  γ ) Cr!#1 
"    (1) 
 
User credibility components consist of: (1) Cr* + refer to 
user credibility expertise from user ratings component, (2) 
Cr!#/ 
" refer to user credibility trustworthiness from direct 
followers trust and (3) Cr!#1 
" refer to user credibility 
trustworthiness from indirect followers trust, where 
α , β1 , γ  1, and α, β1, γ are system tuning parameters 
representing the importance of each credibility component. 
In our experiments, we use the values (5/9,3/9,1/9) 
respectively.  
Credibility of Web service is a crucial part in service 
selection. In the following section we define Web service 
credibility and show how to compute it in a dynamic 
environment. 
 
 
Figure 2.  Web service Credibility Model 
C.  Web service Credibility Model  
We define a credible Web service as a service that 
performed consistently, accurately, and has proven to be 
dependable over a period of time (t). Credibility of a Web 
service Cr2!3" as shown in Fig. 2 can be measured by its 
trustworthiness Cr2*# +, expertise Cr2*4 + and dynamism 
[18]; so we address these components as follows:  
1) Web service credibility from Trustworthiness 
Trustworthiness is the property of an entity of being 
“able to be trusted”, while trusting is “to have belief or 
confidence in the honesty, goodness, skill or safety of a 
person, organization or thing” [21]. Trustworthiness of a 
Web service is the property of being “worthy of confidence” 
and therefore related to past consistent reputation in specific 
context and time.  
We define Web service trustworthiness Cr2*# + as a 
measure of its reputation and is regarded as a predictor of its 
future behavior [1]. Reputation is what is generally said or 
believed about a person's or thing's character or standing 
[14]. It is a collective measure of the opinion of a 
community of users (humans or agents) regarding their 
158

actual experience with the service [22]. It is computed as an 
aggregation of users’ feedbacks and reflects the reliability 
and trustworthiness of the service and its provider. Web 
service reputation is impacted by the following factors [23]: 
1. Customer feedback: represents the extent of customer 
satisfaction from providers' performance based on the 
interaction with the Web service, and the opinion of the 
customer on the fulfillment of the service considering the 
agreement [22] between the user and the service provider. 
2. Credibility of a rater: indicates how credible the rater is 
in providing feedback. Malik and Bouguettaya [24] define a 
credible rater as one who has performed consistently, 
accurately, and has proven to be useful (in terms of ratings 
provided) over a period of time. Ratings from highly 
credible raters weigh more than ratings from consumers 
with low credibility’s. 
3. Customer preference weight: each customer has a 
specific preference weight for each QoS attribute j denoted 
by 5
6 in the range [0,1]. Reputation of attribute j at time t 
denoted by 47*38
6+;  is the weighted average of all 
feedbacks from all customers N who rated attribute j. For 
the (jth) attribute, reputation in time (t) can be defined as:

where L44MNOP *3

the rater i in the range [0, 1] at time t, P

credibility in the range [0, 1]. For the (jth) attribute:

2) Web service Credibility from Expertise component 
Expertise, a key dimension of Web service credibility is 
defined as the degree of a Web service competency to 
provide accurate results as promised and exhibit high 
activity [25]. The expertise dimension captures the 
perceived interoperability and skills of the Web service. 
QoS monitoring for Web services described in Zeng, Lei et 
al. [26] can be used as a reference model. We model Web 
service credibility drawn from its expertise component as: 
 
Cr2*4 + 

where (N2
b) refers to engagement frequency in a specific 
period t, and defined as the number of times the Web 
service was engaged in an execution process. (Ncde

" is the 
maximum service frequency in that domain; considered as a 
reference point. (7`
8) is the performance of service [0, 1]; and 
computed as the aggregation of all QoS performance. 
Considering that a quality management system provides 
temporal information about each attribute performance 
!7`
6", i.e., the extent of the service meet the SLA between 
the user and the provider for that attribute; then we define 
QoS attribute performance from one transaction 7`

(jth) attribute as follows:

where (l` 
6>m$nE8`nm, l` 
6WnEon$nm" in the range [0, 1] and 
refer to the advertised and perceived quality values 
respectively. When the QoS attribute is maximized, means 
the higher value over the promised (advertised) value is the 
better, such as security. When the attribute is to be 
minimized, means the lower value below the promised 
(advertised) value is the better such as response time and 
duration. For example, if the advertised response time which 
needs to be minimized; is (0.8 ms) and the perceived 
response time is (0.95 ms), then the performance of the 
response time is (0.8125). While when the perceived 
response time is (0.75 ms), then the performance of the 
response time is (1).

3) Computing Web service Credibility 
Web service credibility is computed by aggregating the 
credibility components: trustworthiness component from 
reputation and expertise credibility component; hence Web 
service credibility at current time (t) is given by: 
 
Cr2!3"   ) Cr2*# + , !1 w  " ) Cr2*4 +          (10) 
 
where  in the range 0, 1, represents the importance of 
each credibility component. For example; when (  0.5" 
the system relies on trustworthiness less than expertise 
credibility component. 
4) Credibility Decay 
In Web service selection; recent credibility components: 
trustworthiness and expertise attract more importance than 
old ones; considering the decay factor km!t" to control this 
impact; credibility of service (s) can be defined as:

V. 
PERCEIVED RISK AND RISK ATTITUDE IN WEB 
SERVICE SELECTION 
Since no Web service is risk free, there is always some 
degree of risk or uncertainty associated with Web service 
selection decisions. In the following section we explore the 
perceived risk of Web service performance and show how 
customers have varied risk attitudes towards handling the 
perceived risk. 
A. Perceived Performance Risk in Web service selection 
During Web service selection consumers often act on 
information that is incomplete and far from perfect [3]. As a 
result, they are often faced with some degree of risk or 
uncertainty in their selection decisions. Kim, Ferrin et al. [3] 
formally define perceived risk as a consumer's belief about 
the potential uncertain negative outcomes from the online 
transaction. Featherman and Pavlou [27] view perceived 
risk as “a combination of uncertainty plus seriousness of 
outcome involved”. Perceived risk is commonly viewed as 
uncertainty regarding possible negative consequences of 
using a Web service.  
In Web service selection, perceived risk has different 
dimensions such as reliability, availability, response time, 
security and privacy; we refer to these dimensions as 
performance risk. When the service provider does not 
respect the SLA in any of advertised QoS attributes the Web 
service performance suffers from such behavior; which in 
turn increases the severity of the associated risk. For 
example, when a consumer submits credit card information 
through a transaction she can feel the threat of the 
possibility of credit card fraud or even disclosure of 
consumer information to non-authorized people when the 
security or privacy performance is low or unknown.  
In this paper, we follow [28] and define perceived 
Performance Risk (PR) in [0,1] as: Consumer assessment of 
potential performance problems, malfunctioning, transaction 
processing errors, reliability and/or security problems, that 
cause the Web service not perform as expected.  
B. Risk Attitude and Perceived Risk 
Risk attitude represents how willing the customer is to 
take on the perceived risk which is largely dependent on the 
character of an individual [21] and their position, e.g., 
financial position or their role such as followers or leaders. 
Different factors affect risk attitude such as personality type, 
gender, age, culture, etc. Furthermore, we believe that risk 
attitude is context based; for example, a customer can use a 
Web service without any monetary transaction or even a 
cheap service with a high attitude to accept the risk, while 
when using a monetary Web service with payment she 
would usually have different trade-offs between utility and 
perceived risk in making her decision.  
Consumer risk attitude determines the courses of action 
to be followed. Consumers who are cautious by nature may 
avoid risky situations and fail to capture opportunities as a 
consequence. Since all decisions have an element of 
uncertainty about them, all decision-makers are risk takers 
[29]. The degree to which decision-makers enjoy taking risk 
depends upon individual attitudes.  
The risk attitude of the customer plays a vital role in 
selecting the most attractive choice. However, in Web 
service selection users may have different risk attitudes; the 
risk attitude (RA) of a customer is given by a real number in 
[0, 1]. Customers with risk attitude 0 are the most risk-
averse customers, while customers with risk attitude being 1 
are the most risk-seeking customers.  
C. Perceived Risk from Risk Attitude Perspective 
Risk evaluation involves the consumer determining the 
possibility of the failure of the interaction with the Web 
service and the subsequent possible consequences for their 
resources involved in the interaction. In general, it is 
accepted that the higher the perceived risk the lower the 
likelihood of the transaction. We believe that credibility, 
perceived risk and expected utility of the Web service from 
risk-averse customer perspective are related according to the 
following the axioms: 
1. When WS credibility goes to zero, perceived risk goes 
to one consequently utility goes to zero.

2. When WS credibility increases, perceived risk 
decreases and consequently utility increases. 
3. When WS credibility goes to one, perceived risk 
approaches zero, consequently utility goes to the 
maximum value depending on the customer risk 
attitude [0, 1].  
To model the relation between service credibility, 
perceived risk and risk attitude, we propose the following 
formula that satisfies the above axioms: 
 
PR!"  e¡                                                      (12) 
 
where ¢ is customer risk attitude coefficient in the range 
[1, 5] and given by ¢  4O , 1.  For a risk-averse 
customer with risk attitude RA = 0, ¢  1; while for a risk-
seeker with RA = 1, ¢  5.  
In [30], Sitkin and Weingart (1995) argue that the higher 
the perceived risk, the greater the perceived chance of 
experiencing a loss, therefore, the lower the consumer’s 
expected utility from the transaction. Thus we can model the 
relation between perceived performance risks (PR) from a 
Web service (S), and associated utility U(s) as: 
 
PR!s" , U!"   1                                             (13) 
 
 
 
Figure 3.  Perceived Risk variation with Different risk attitudes 
Fig. 3 shows how the perceived risk (PR) related to the 
credibility and varies with risk attitude (RA) for the 
following cases: (1) RA = 1 for risk seeker, (2) RA= 0 for 
risk-averse customer. From the above formula we conclude 
that risk-seeker customers gain more utility than risk-averse 
customers as shown in Fig. 3, consequently risk-averse 
customers perceive more risk than risk-seeker customers. 
In summary, we believe that the perceived risk is a 
reflection of user risk attitude i.e., how much risk is the 
customer ready to take as shown in Fig. 3. For example, if 
the credibility of the service = 0.7, then from a risk-averse 
customer perspective with risk attitude = 0 the perceived 
risk is 0.5, while from a risk-seeking customer perspective 
with risk attitude = 1 the perceived risk is 0.03. 
VI. 
 SERVICE SELECTION WITH RISK ATTITUDE AND 
PERCEIVED RISK  
Customer self confidence assessment is the final 
determinant in the selection decision process. We argue that 
customer risk attitude enrich customer confidence-when 
customer risk attitude increases then customer confidence 
increases and when customer risk attitude decreases the 
customer’s confidence decreases. The following scenarios 
describe different customers’ behavior in service selection: 
1. Risk-seekers customers (Leaders): select the service that 
maximizes their utility based on Web service credibility 
and accepting the perceived risk; they usually select the 
service with the highest credibility score when the 
perceived risk is within the customer risk attitude. Risk-
seeking customers may adopt new services that have 
never been used before, or they can use a service that 
they know the perceived risk is high because they have a 
high risk attitude and choose to accept the perceived risk 
in order to gain higher utility. 
2. Risk-averse customers (Followers): benefit from their 
social relations and their trust in others, they usually 
prefer to use a service even if it is expensive it was used 
by other friends with a proven successful performance. 
Risk-averse customers usually like to avoid risky 
situations; they prefer to mitigate the risk by following 
other trustworthy advice from leaders or other friends 
than acting themselves. 
3. Risk-neutral customers make their decisions based on 
their risk attitude and the perceived risk from a Web 
services in hand. They make their decision either to 
follow other friends to mitigate a high perceived risk or 
acting as independents if they are confident that they can 
accept the perceived risk from the transaction. 
VII. SIMULATION AND EVALUATION  
To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of 
“Follow the Leader” as a new approach to alleviate the risk 
in service selection, first we developed a Social Network 
Analysis Studio (SNAS) using NetLogo platform [31] that 
analyze user and Web service behaviors in a social network 
based on our simulation tool “4S: Service Selection 
Simulation Studio” [32] inspired by Goldbaum (2008). User 
interface is shown in Fig. 4. We use it to evaluate the 
validity of our approach. In the following sections we 
outline the testing environment and outcomes.

A.  Simulation Model 
Our simulation model is composed of a fixed number of 
atomic services (9) with the same functional properties and 
varied in their QoS attributes. Each atomic service maintains 
a list of QoS attributes and promised values, where QoS is 
static during any simulation session. Web service credibility 
is dynamic and computed after each round.  
 
 
Figure 4.  SNA Simulation Tool – User Interface 
Each simulation session is composed of a fixed set of 
rounds (25). Each round represents a time unit e.g., one day. 
In each round a fixed number of customers (100) enter 
his/her queries into the system. Each customer has a varied 
list of preferences and corresponding values and weights. 
Each customer has a random number of friends (1-6) with 
corresponding trust values. By the end of each transaction, 
the system implements credibility computation based on 
service performance. Each service has an initial credibility 
at the beginning of each session based on its capabilities.  
Each simulation session starts by importing the services 
and setting customers with their corresponding information. 
In each round every customer passes its query to the system. 
The system identifies leaders based on their credibility level 
and expressive queries. If the customer qualifies as a leader, 
then the system enables the leader selecting the best service 
from available services based on the expected utility. If the 
customer acts as a follower, then the system either: (1) 
Selects the best friend with highest credibility from the 
customer’s friends, i.e., the confidence in that friend is 
higher than the confidence in herself, or (2) Allows the 
customer to act as independent if the confidence in herself is 
higher than any of her friends. By the end of each round, 
each customer provides a feedback to the system about their 
satisfaction from the service; this feedback is used to derive 
service reputation which has impact on service credibility. 
B. Simulation Results 
To test the hypothesis that using the “Follow the Leader” 
approach is an applicable approach to mitigate the perceived 
risk in the service selection we perform the following 
experiments:  
1. Impact of Trustworthiness and Expertise on WS 
Credibility: in this experiment we show how Web 
service credibility varies with Trustworthiness and 
Expertise credibility components over time. Fig. 5 shows 
how credibility components Trustworthiness CR(T) and 
Expertise CR(E) vary with time, with importance weight 
(β = 0.4) for CR(T) and (1 - β = 0.6) for CR(E) to give 
CR(Global) for each round.

Figure 6.  Dynamism of utility and Perceived Risk for Different Risk 
Attitudes RA = (1, 0) 
2. Utility based Credibility vs. Perceived Risk for Different 
Customers Risk Attitudes RA = (1, 0.5, 0); in this 
experiment we show how different customers with 
varied risk attitudes perceive the risk PR from 9 
services. In Fig. 6, WS=1 shows the highest credibility 
(0.73). From a risk-seeker perspective with RA = 1, the 
perceived risk PR is the lowest (0.026) with the highest 
utility (0.974); while from a risk-averse perspective with 
RA = 0, the perceived risk PR is the highest (0.481) with 
the lowest utility (0.519). This emphasizes the 
relationship between utility and perceived risk as (U + 
PR = 1), from any customer perspective (i.e., when the 
utility increases the perceived risk decreases) and vice 
versa. 
3. Dynamism of Utility and Perceived Risk for Different 
Risk Attitudes RA = (1,0); Fig. 6 shows how credibility 
and corresponding utility of Web service varies with 
time from a customer varied perspective (i.e., with risk

attitude as risk-seeker RA=1 and risk averse customer 
with risk attitude RA=0). 
4. Malicious Web service behavior – (Facebook’ Privacy 
Scenario): In this experiment we simulate malicious 
service behavior after its approved credibility over a 
specific period of time (first 11 rounds) then acts 
maliciously by performing inadequately with one of its 
QoS such as privacy issue [33] for Facebook users. Fig. 
7 shows how the service behaves consistently in the first 
11 rounds with the highest credibility overall other 
services, but when one attribute of its QoS suffers, then 
associated credibility suffers as well. By calculating the 
impact of this change, we note that Round Credibility 
(RND-CR) decreased from an average of (0.59) in the 
first 11 rounds to an average of (0.35) in the rest of 
simulation rounds, with overall loss in its credibility of 
(39%). These figures reflect the sensitivity of the model 
against malicious behavior of Web service.

Figure 8.  Service Selection based on customer Risk attitude and Service 
credibility –Follow the Leader Model 
5. In Web service selection with risk considerations as 
shown in Fig. 8, Leaders (Black and Red agents) make 
their selection choice based on their risk attitude and 
Web service utility. Since leaders risk attitudes are high, 
they select the service with the highest credibility, 
whereas for customers with low risk attitude they make 
their decision based on the confidence that one of their 
friends selected a high utility service to follow (Green 
agent). If their confidence in themselves is higher than 
any of their friends then they take the risk and act as 
independent (Blue agents). Consequently they select 
their best service based on service credibility. 
C.  Results Summary 
We summarize our observations from the previous 
experiments as follows: 
1. In a Web based social network (WBSN), customer 
credibility is the determinant of its behavior. 
Credibility of a customer in a specific domain/context 
is the predictor of her risk attitude. Usually customers 
with high credibility act as leaders, while customers 
with lowest credibility act as followers.  
2. Web service credibility is the determinant of its 
behavior; different services in a specific domain have 
same functionalities and vary in their QoS attributes. 
Each service has its unique credibility computed based 
on trustworthiness and expertise. Trustworthiness 
component is drawn from its reputation while its 
expertise represents to what extent the service provides 
promised QoS according to the SLA.  
3. Proposed Web service credibility model shows its 
sensitivity to Trustworthiness and expertise. Web 
service Credibility drops significantly when one or 
more of its QoS attributes behave maliciously. 
4. Proposed Web service selection based on risk attitude 
approach is an efficient approach to alleviate the risk 
of Web service selection for customers with low risk 
attitudes i.e., followers. This approach explores the 
confidence relation between the follower and her 
friends which is a function of customer credibility.  
VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS  
In this paper, we proposed a centralized credibility based 
framework for users in WBSN and for Web services in a 
specific domain which are similar in their functionality but 
vary in their QoS. Credibility in both models is drawn from 
trustworthiness and expertise components of users and Web 
services. Users’ credibility is an indicator of their risk 
attitude and self confidence; while service credibility is an 
indicator of its consumption. 
We showed how risk-averse customers make their 
decisions in Web service selection and follow the best 
trustworthy friend in their social network; in order to reduce 
the perceived risk from the available choice based on 
“Follow the Leader” approach.  
We proved the feasibility of our proposed framework in 
providing 
accurate 
Web 
service 
selection 
through 
simulation. The results of the experiments included in this 
paper show the applicability and scalability of the proposed 
credibility assessment based on “Follow the Leader” Model 
to mitigate the risk in service selection. We have shown how 
different users with varied risk attitudes make their 
decisions in the Web service selection process with the 
perceived performance risk and utility considerations.  
Although we handle the risk for followers with low risk 
attitude in the service selection by following one of their 
best friends who selected a service that increase the follower 
utility, considering the confidence relation as the 
determinant to which is the best friend to follow, notably the

omission of social influences between WBSN members is a 
limitation which will be explored in a future study.
