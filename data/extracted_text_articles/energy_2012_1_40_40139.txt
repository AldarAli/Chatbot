Abstract—The Unit Commitment Problem (UCP) is an im-
portant category of power planning problems. The purpose of
UCP is to determine when to start up and shut down the
generator units and how to dispatch the committed units to
meet the electricity demands, ancillary services requirements and
security constraints. In this paper, we improve the traditional
Lagrange Relaxation (LR) approach and analyze the effectiveness
of using parallel computing in solving large unit commitment
problems with wind penetration and investigate the potential
of combining parallel computing with a rolling horizon scheme
to improve the solution quality when a large amount of wind
power is present. In particular, we ﬁrst formulate a security
constrained unit commitment problem by taking into account
power generation costs, ancillary costs, wind power and a variety
of security constraints employed in real New York State day-
ahead power market. We then propose a parallelized version of
the LR method to solve the problem in a single step, analyze
the scalability issue of parallel computing, and investigate the
impact of increased wind energy penetration. Finally, when a
large amount of wind power is present, we further propose an
approach that combines parallel computing with a rolling horizon
technique to solve the UCP online.

I. INTRODUCTION
The goal of unit commitment problems is to ﬁnd the optimal
production schedule for the power generation units and the
production level of each unit over a short term period in order
to minimize the operational cost of the power grid [1]. To
maintain the security of the electric grid, a variety of security
constrained, for example, reserve constraints and transmission
constraints, are enforced, and the resulting problem is usually
called Security Constrained Unit Commitment (SCUC) prob-
lem. In New York State, UCP is solved by New York Inde-
pendent System Operator (NYISO) in the day-ahead power
The research of Eugene Feinberg was partially supported by NSF grants
CMMI-0900206 and CMMI-0928490. The work of Jiaqiao Hu was sup-
ported in part by the Air Force Ofﬁce of Scientiﬁc Research under Grant

market based on the generation and ancillary service bids,
which give generation and ancillary service cost of each power
generator, from Independent Power Producers (IPP), Loads bid
from Load Service Entities (LSE) and Security Constraints set
by NYISO and other power regulation authorities. Because of
the importance of UCPs, broad and intensive study has been
carried out in this ﬁeld, and many methods have been proposed
in literature and used in practice [2].
Depending on the system conﬁguration of a power grid,
different optimization objectives and security constraints are
considered. For the basic UCP formulation, the objective is
simply to minimize the power generation cost subject to the
electricity demand. However, as the liberalization of the elec-
tricity markets and advancement of optimization techniques,
more and more elements are introduced. In [3], a security
constrained unit commitment problem (SCUC) with trans-
mission constraints was tackled using a lagrangian relaxation
approach, where the transmission and reserve constraints were
relaxed to form a dual problem and subsequently solved using
subgradient methods. The test result showed that the proposed
direct method can reduce the generation cost over the indirect
method that does not consider transmission constraint in the
dual optimization process. The algorithm was improved in [4]
to address the feasibility issue, and a unit de-commitment step
was added to achieve a better solution. The AC constraints
were considered in [5], and Bender’s decomposition technique
was used to solve the problem. Furthermore, ancillary ser-
vices has been gradually introduced into the unit commitment
process. In [6], Z. Li and M. Shahidehpour used Lagrangian
Relaxation technique to solve the security constrained UCP
with the ancillary service constraints and costs; moreover, they
also calculated the market clearing price of both generation
and ancillary costs. Their work is important because there is a
conﬂict between generation service and ancillary service when
a generator is turned on. Additionally, some environmental
elements, such as carbon tax, were introduced into the UCP in
the past two years [7]. Because of its complexity, it is unusual

for ISOs to solve the problem in a single step. Instead, a
multi-step approach is often adopted. For example, in the New
York State, different constraints are added at different steps to
decrease the complexity of the problem [8]; however, this will
decrease the solution quality. Therefore, how to solve a SCUC
problem in a single step with a certain time limit becomes a
challenging problem.
The presence of renewable energy sources such as wind
power can further increase the complexity of the unit com-
mitment problem, and a common method to handle this is
to use the scenario tree technique [9] to simulate the un-
certainties and dynamics of wind power. However, to make
the problem computationally tractable, only a very limited
number of scenarios can be used. Many research projects
proposed to use a rolling horizon optimization scheme rather
than the traditional day-ahead scheme; see for example, the
Wilmar project [10][11][12]. An alternative method is to
use a probability measure to set up a probability level to
limit the probability of power outage within the prescribed
threshold [13]. To meet these probability requirements, one
needs to set the operation reserve based on the variability
of wind power. A rolling horizon approach can also be used
to dynamically locate the operation reserve when new wind
forecast information is available. Note that the rolling horizon
approach is more computationally demanding as compared to
traditional UCPs in day-ahead scheduling, as decisions need
to be made at every time step in an online manner and every
decision requires solving a nonlinear optimization problem
involving both continuous and discrete decision variables.
In this work, an improved Lagrangian Relaxation (LR)
method, which is adapted for parallel computing, is proposed
to solve a large scale SCUC problem. Because linear genera-
tion cost functions are used, a greedy algorithm is proposed to
optimize the generation and ancillary service when a generator
is on. By using the proposed algorithm, we expect to solve the
large-scale SCUC in a single step and dramatically reduce the
computational time. A system based on the features of power
system of New York Control Area (NYCA) is simulated to
test the signiﬁcance of our algorithm.
To address the variability of wind power, we follow the
idea of [13] and use a probabilistic reserve constraint to
describe the uncertainty of wind power. Since the wind power
forecast is more accurate over shorter time periods [14][11],
the probabilistic reserve constraints method is combined with a
rolling horizon scheme to dynamically update the reserve con-
straints when more accurate wind forecast becomes available.
the computational time issue is addressed by implementing
our proposed solver on a parallel computing facility, and the
research results show that parallel computing has the potential
to satisfy this computational speed requirement of Rolling
Horizon Scheme.
The organization of this paper is as follows. A security
constrained unit commit model is formulated in Section II,
and a solution algorithm is given in Section III. Section IV
gives the probabilistic formulation of reserve constraints and
the method used to handle the constraints. In Section V,
we provide case study to illustrate the performance of our
algorithms. The nomenclature is given in the Appendix at the
end of this paper.
II. FORMULATION OF SCUC MODEL
In this work, a SCUC model is formulated based on the
realistic problem solved in New York State. Both generation
service and ancillary services, including reserve services and
regulations services, are optimized to minimize the total op-
erational costs. Realistic security constraints, including bal-
ance constraints, ancillary service requirement, load capacity
constraint, transmission constraints, etc, are considered in this
research. Unlike some other research, which is based on
benchmark problems with up to 100 generators and limited
security constraints, this work is trying to solve large-scale
problem with more than 600 power generators and realistic
security constraints enforced in daily power planning process
in New York States. The formulation is given in the subsec-
tions below.
A. Objective Function
In this work, the total operational cost, including both the
power supply cost and ancillary services cost are optimized.
The power supply cost includes power generation cost and
start-up cost. The ancillary service cost includes reserve ser-
vice cost and regulation service cost. Moreover, reserve service
is divided into spinning service and non-synchronous service.
The formulation is given in (1).

The ﬁrst line in equation (1) includes power generation
function, which is formulated as a piecewise linear function,
and a startup function, which is formulated as a stepwise linear
function. The second line includes the reserve cost function,
which is a linear function with respect to the 10-minute and
30-minute spinning reserves and non-synchronous reserves.
The third line is the linear regulation cost function. It should
be noted that a generator can provide spinning reserve or
regulation services only when it is turned on, and provide
non-synchronous reserve service only when it is turned off.
B. Load Balance
In this work, we assume that wind power can be integrated
at no additional cost, and that there is no wind curtailment.
Thus, wind power will always be delivered to customers. Then,
wind power can be considered as negative load in this research.

Here we deﬁne the term “net load” as the difference between
the electricity demand and the predicted wind power, i.e., the
load that needs to be supplied by the traditional generators,
including steam generator, gas turbine and hydro power. In
day-ahead planning, the hydro and thermal plants should meet
the sum of net loads of certain control areas. The mathematical
formulation is given in equation (2).

C. Ancillary service requirements
For the entire control area, there are three kinds of re-
serve requirements: 10-minute spinning reserve, 10-minute
total reserve, and 30-minute total reserve requirements. The
mathematical formulations are given in (3), (4), and (5),
respectively.

In real power market, a control area is often divided into
several individual areas, which are usually called “zones”. And
for certain collection of zones, there are several location based
reserve constraints. Letting Λj be the jth collection of zones,
the location based reserve constraints are given by (6), (7),
and (8).

In a control area operated by an ISO, those collection of
zones are called “super-zones”. Equations (6), (7), and (8)
should be satisﬁed for all those super-zones.
Additionally, due the ﬂuctuation of power demand and wind
power, ISOs has certain requirements for regulation services,
which are expressed in (9).

mission line l due to the net power injection of zone m.
E. Single generator capacity constraints
A generator that has been turned on might provide genera-
tion and reserve simultaneously. In practice, the sum of these
services should be within the maximum power output limit.
These requirements are given in (11), (12), (13), and (14).
When a generator is off-line, it might be used to provide non-
synchronous reserve services, the sum of which should also be
within the maximum output limit. The formulations are given
in (16), (17), and (18). In addition, regulation service should
also be within a certain limit, which is given in equation (15).

(16)
r10sm,im,t ≤ r10sm,im,max(1 − zm,im,t), ∀m, im, t
(17)
r30sm,im,t ≤ r30sm,im,max(1 − zm,im,t), ∀m, im, t
(18)
F. Other constraints
Some other constraints such as minimum up time and down
time constraints are also considered in our model. The detailed
formulation can be found in, e.g., [15] and [16]. In addition,
the maximum number of stops will be considered in our
model, which means that a generator can only be turned off
for a limited number of times on a single day. This constraint
has never be considered in previous studies.

III. SOLUTION ALGORITHM
As proposed in [4], a direct method is used to solve
the SCUC problem. Compared with the work in [3], we
introduced the ancillary service costs in the objective function,
and single generator capacity constraints are added to the
model. Moreover, a parallel computing scheme is developed
to enhance the computational speed.
A. Lagrangian Relaxation Algorithm
To solve this problem, Lagrangian Relaxation method is
used to relax the demand, reserve, transmission, and regula-
tions constraints. A dual problem is thus obtained, and its
objective function is given in equation (19).

where “Cost" equals the cost function in equation (1).
The second

equation (19) is

the

the relaxation of reserve constraints of the whole control
area, while lines 8 − 13 are due to the relaxation of
location reserve constraints, line 14 is due the relaxation or
regulation constraints, and lines 15 − 16 are the relaxation
of transmission constraints. λd,t, λ10s,t, λ10t,t, λ30t,t,λj,10s,t,
λj,10t,t, λj,30t,t, λreg,t, and λtran,l,t are the corresponding
lagrangian multipliers. For simplicity, we deﬁne λt
=
{λd,t, λ10s,t, λ10t,t, λ30t,t, λj,10s,t, λj,10t,t, λj,30t,t, λreg,t}.
The dual problem is to ﬁnd maxλt[min(Dual Cost)]. A

Then the dual cost can be express as follows.

DualCostm,im + Extra
(21)
where Extra is the difference between equations (19) and
(21). It could be seen that the term Extra does not depend
on the status of power generators, and is a constant if the
values of multipliers are given.
A subgradient method is used to solve the dual problem.
The value of λt is initialized ﬁrst, and its value can be used
to minimize dual cost function. Because the term Extra is a
constant, we just need to minimize the term DualCostm,im
individually. Dynamic problem is used to solve the single
generator problem. To calculate the one-step reward, we need
to optimize the allocation of generation services and ancillary
services when a generator is on or off. When a generator is on,
it could provide generation services, spinning reserve services,
and regulation services. The one-step cost optimization prob-
lem (22) should be solved subject to constraints (11), (13),
(14), and (15). On the other hand, when a generator is off, it
could provide non-synchronous reserve services. Another one-
step cost optimization problem (23) should be solved subject
to constraints (17) and (18).

General linear programming techniques can be used to solve
these two problems; however, it is time consuming. Since
piecewise generation cost functions and linear ancillary service
cost functions are used in this work, we propose to use a
greedy algorithm, which can signiﬁcantly reduce the compu-
tational time. Let

When a generator is “on", the greedy algorithm works as
follows:
1) Initialize the power generation and ancillary service
levels to 0.
2) Sort the linear cost coefﬁcients, including those in gen-
eration cost function F ′ and ancillary cost functions R′
and CReg′, in equation (24), to form a non-decreasing
list {ch}, where h ∈ {1, 2, ..., K + 3}.
3) Let pm,im,t = pm,im,min.
4) From h = 1 to h = K +3, consider the following cases:
a) ch is a generation cost coefﬁcient; if ch > 0, stop;
else, ch should be the generation cost coefﬁcient
of the kth segment and
ak + r10sm,im,t + r30sm,im,t ≤ pm,im,max,
then pm,im,t = max(ak, pm,im,min).
b) ch is a 10-minute spinning reserve cost coefﬁcient;
if ch > 0, stop; else,
r10sm,im,t = min(r10sm,im,max,
pm,im,max − pm,im,t − r30sm,im,t).
c) ch is a 30-minute spinning reserve cost coefﬁcient;

if ch > 0, stop; else
r30sm,im,t = min(r30sm,im,max,

d) ch is a regulation cost coefﬁcient;

When a generator is “off”, a similar algorithm can be applied:

2) Sort the linear cost coefﬁcients of ancillary cost function
R′ to form a non-decreasing list {c1, c2} .

coefﬁcient;

B. A Parallel computing scheme
In the LR algorithm, the dual problem is decomposed into
identical single generator problems. Therefore, it is natural
to assign those problems to individual CPU’s and solve
them simultaneously. In every iteration, the root CPU will
“broadcast” the values of lagrangian multipliers to the branch
CPU’s, where the single generator sub-problems are solved,
and the solutions are “collected” to the root CPU to update the
value of the multipliers. The computing scheme is illustrated
in ﬁgure III-B. Suppose there are N power generators, then the
computational time required to solve the dual problem can be
estimated by equation (26) if the computational load is equally
distributed to each branch CPU.
tdual ≈ (
N
# of CPUs ×tsingle +tupdate+tcomm)×niteration
(26)
where tdual is the computational time needed to solve the dual
problem, tsingle is the computational time in solving a single
generator problem, tcomm is the communication time between
the root CPU and branch CPU’s, and niteration is the number
of iterations in the subgradient search process.
IV. PROBABILISTIC UNIT COMMITMENT MODEL AND
ROLLING HORIZON (RH) SCHEME
For simplicity, we only consider the probabilistic reserve
constraints. Without loss of generality, we can replace the
reserve constraint in Section II-C with the following constraint
(27).

Equation (29) may not accurately describe the reserve require-
ment, because the wind power in different zones are in general
correlated. Nevertheless, for simplicity we assume that they are
independent, and the general correlated case will be considered
in our future research. This reserve constraints is very similar
to the constraints in Section II-C, and a similar LR algorithm
can be applied to solve the problem.
If we assume that wind power forecasts are updated every
hour, we can update equations (2) and (29) and solve the cor-
responding UCP on a hourly basis. The RH scheme considers
the updated wind power information in both unit commitment
and economic dispatch processes, while in traditional day-
ahead scheme, the updated wind power information is only
considered in economic dispatch process. Thus, by involving
more accurate information in the optimization process, we
expect to get better solutions with decreased operational costs.

V. CASE STUDIES
A. New York Control Area
To study the effectiveness of our approach on large scale
problems, we simulated a SCUC problem based on the char-
acteristics of New York State control Area. NYCA is divided
into 11 sub-zones with transmission interface between adjacent
sub-zones. The detailed zone map is given in ﬁgure V-A.
One feature of power grid in New York State is that most
of the electricity demand comes from the southeast area of
New York state, i.e., Long Island and New York City, while
a large portion of the power resources are located in the west
and north parts of the state. Additionally, in the near future,
most of the power farms will be located in zones A − E [17],
and will bring more burden to transmission lines. This uneven
distribution of power generation sources and power demand
makes transmission constrained unit commitment an important
problem in NYCA. Moreover, locational reserve requirements
are enforced to maintain the safety operation of the power
grid.
We follow the practice of NYISO and divide NYCA into
two super-zones, where west super-zones include load zones
A − E and east super-zones include zones F − G. Additional
reserve requirements are enforced for east super-zones. In
addition, similar reserve requirements are also enforced on
zone K, which is Long Island. The reserve requirements can
be formulated in the forms of equations (6), (7), and (8). The
transmission constraints are formulated in the form of equation
(10).
In accordance with the day-ahead power market in New
York State [18], piecewise linear generation cost functions and
stepwise startup cost functions are used. Each generation cost
function can have up to 12 pieces. A total of 641 power gen-
erators, including nuclear plants, hydro plants, steam plants,
and gas turbines, are simulated in this work. The net load
for each zone is calculated by subtracting the forecasted wind
power from the forecasted electricity demands. Four different
wind penetration level cases are used: 1275MW, 4250MW,
6000MW, and 8000MW. According to the penetration level,
the regulation requirement is adjusted as proposed in [17]. A
single day (24 hour period) in August is used for the study.
Because currently, the report [17] by NYISO indicates that the
current reserve level is enough for the 8000MW penetration of
wind power, so we will not consider the probabilistic reserve
level management in this case.
The LR algorithm was coded in C++ and implemented on
New York Blue Gene, a distributed-memory supercomputing
cluster. Up to 50 nodes were used, while each node has
two 700MHz PowerPC processors and 1G DDR memory.
Figure 3 shows the computational time required to execute
the algorithm v.s. the number of CPUs used. The minimum
computational time is around 180 seconds, which is much less
than the 1600 seconds computational time when 1 CPU is
used. The total operation costs, which is the sum of generation
costs and ancillary costs, are given in table I. It is interesting to
note that the costs are all negative. This is reasonable because

case
for some IPP’s, they want to assure that some plants will be
selected for generation, for example, nuclear plants and some
coal steam plants. Because whatever they bid for generation,
they will be paid by the positive market clearing price. Thus,
they have the incentive too keep those cheap power sources
online. From the table, it is obvious that high penetration
of wind power will save money for the New York control
area. The plots for marginal regulation costs are given in
ﬁgure 4. Because the increment in regulation requirements, the
marginal costs for regulation generally increase. Because of
the location-based reserve services, different sub-zones might
have different marginal reserve cost services. Besides, we
note that the Lagrangian multiplier for transmission constraints
increases as the penetration level of wind energy grows. This is
reasonable for New York state because most of the wind power
resources in NYCA are located in north parts while most of
electricity consumption are located in southeast regions. Thus,
the increased power penetration will bring more pressure on
transmission lines in New York State.

B. Rolling horizon study
The proposed method has been applied to solving large
sized problems based on the ten-unit system of [19], which
has been repeated 100 times so that the problem comprises
1000 units. The generator parameters are slightly perturbed
because it is unrealistic to have so many identical generators.
The load proﬁle is based on the System D in [20], which
has been multiplied by 100 accordingly. We assume 25% of
wind penetration level, which is close to the 8000MW case in
NYCA. Figure 5 shows that the computational time decreases
dramatically when the number of processors increases from 1
to 20, and the minimum computational time is about 20%
of the sequential computational time. This result is not as
good as that for the NYCA case, which involves much more
constraints. For NYCA case, the computational time decreases
from 1600 seconds (around 0.5 hours ) to 3 minutes, which
make it reasonable to restart the UCP solver every hour when
new information is available.
The result of rolling horizon approach was compared with
the traditional day-ahead planning method. In current market,
the stochastic problem was solved once every day, and only
dispatch problem was solved when the real data was available.
The operation costs of the next 24 hours of both approaches
were compared. The result is shown in Figure 6. A signiﬁcant
reduction of cost is observed when applying rolling horizon
approach. For stochastic problem with wind energy, the cost
reduction (approximately 3%) is more signiﬁcant.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have formulated a security constrained
unit commitment problem by incorporating complex ancillary

Approach
services, security, and local reserve constraints, and applied
this model to the New York Control Area. We investigated
the impact of the increasing penetration of wind power on the
New York state day-ahead power market. Additionally, the test
results show that parallel computing can signiﬁcantly reduce
the computational time, which makes it possible for rolling
horizon implementation of the algorithm. Our testing results on
a standard test system show that the rolling horizon approach
may lead to signiﬁcant cost reduction over the traditional day-
ahead approach.
