Abstract— Recently, rapid changes in IT environment have
shifted
the
security
paradigm
from
data
protection
to
protection of people. As a result, IT-related government
policies have also changed. In terms of IT compliance,
government
bureau
have
suggested
diverse
laws
and
guidelines. Under these circumstances, this study attempts to
determine IT compliance issues from the perspective of IT
security personnel in a public agency and derive the related
issues from the information security standpoint. Furthermore,
it targets to address how to develop the IT security compliance
in a progressive manner, focusing on the case of the public
authority ‘K Agency’ after checking current IT security
compliance issues.

INTRODUCTION
Security Resilience refers to the ability to continuously
deliver the intended outcome despite adverse cyber events.
[1]. According to the National Information Protection White
Book [2], the government passed the ‘National Cyber
Security Bill’ during the National Assembly due to the
continued threats to national security by North Korea and
other serious cyber security issues on January 3, 2017. In a
public sector, for the establishment of cloud security policy,
an Act on the Development of Cloud Computing and
Protection of its Users was put into effect in September
2015. In case of the Personal Information Protection Act, in
addition, privacy protection has been stricter every year. In
fact, many public agencies have made a lot of effort to
examine and implement IT security compliance requests
whenever they occur.
As a result, the security officers at various levels of the
organizations
are
continuously spending
administrative
expenses to implement IT security compliance for the public
sector in Korea and abroad. In addition, there is the burden
of the implementation.

IT SECURITY COMPLIANCE IN KOREA
Domestic compliance has been proposed starting from
2009 with the focus on the financial sector. Since IT
compliance is an information technology related to internal
control, it is closely related to information security and IT
systems of each organization are met with the requirements
of government policies and guidelines, as well as to
establish information systems in the direction that they can
achieve.
According to Financial Security Institute (FSI) [3], it has
reviewed and analyzed domestic and international laws &
standards and industrial standards for IT system security
management and published the compliance (2000). Then,
the guidelines (2015) have been provided to each financial
institution [4].
In the public sector, an FSI guide-level promotion
system is not available yet. The administrative body
‘Ministry of the Interior and Safety’ and professional
agency ‘Korea Internet & Security Agency’ have promoted
IT security-related compliance. The major IT compliances
are listed in TABLE I.

Public sector IT compliance major issues can be divided
into information security, privacy, and informatization. The
Ministry of Public Administration and Security is promoting
related
policies
to
establish
information
system
and
information management system for the public sector based
on the National Informatization Basic Law and the Personal
Information
Protection
Act.
The
Information
Security
Division is responsible for assessing the level of information
security at various levels of the National Intelligence
Service (NIS), which acts as the National Cyber Security
Control Tower, and has designated and managed major
information and communication infrastructure.
In
particular,
the
national
information
security
management system is structured for the NIS to handle the
national information security planning and coordination, as

stated in Figure 1 (defined by Kim [5]). This management
system is handled separately from the informatization and
privacy protection which is done by the Ministry of the
Interior and Safety. Therefore, the information security
manager from a public agency is required to respond to each
compliance issue by informatization, information security
and privacy protection individually.

CASE STUDY : ‘K’ AGENCY’S IT SECURITY
COMPLIANCE
The ‘K’ agency affiliated with the Ministry of Science
and Technology is a government-funded research institute in
the IT infrastructure field of science and technology, and
operates more than 100 information systems. To operate on
many information systems and informatization projects, the
information security system of ‘K’ agency was divided into
information
security
governance
(Figure
2)
and
the
following information security management system (Figure
3) was drawn as follows [6]:
Figure. 2. Information Security Governance
Figure. 3. Information Security Management Frame (Process)
In information security governance, ‘K’ agency has
responded to the related information and compliance issues
in real-time through the information security portal. In 2017,
the security management was integrated with the intranet
and provided in an electronic payment format (11 duties in
total). As a result, the duties of security managers from each
department and agency became more convenient (TABLE
II).

CONCLUSION
In order to secure resilience, close implementation of
government policy should be preceded. The government-
level IT compliance has been performed in accordance with
its related laws. Under some laws, a fine is charged on the
un-fulfillment. Under these circumstances, IT departments
can
fulfill
their
role
provided
that
there
is
close
implementation
with government compliance, and
the
related duties in the agencies are efficiently integrated.
Then, the tasks should be promoted to improve the
management
level
in
each
category
(informatization,
information security, personal information).
For this purpose, it is necessary to take active role in
ensuring the information security dedicated organization
and actively participate in the project in terms of the
working organization, the management, the staff, and the
auditing, and public relations activities of the government IT
compliance are the most important.
This study approached what should be fulfilled first
from the IT security compliance’s perspective in a public
sector. It is anticipated that it would suggest specific
guidelines for the public sector and make a contribution to
the improvement of the information security management
level in a public sector.
