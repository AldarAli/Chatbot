Abstract—Thanks to the numerous attempts that are being 
made to develop autonomous robots, increasingly intelligent 
and cognitive skills are allowed. This paper proposes an 
automatic presentation generator for a robot guide, which is 
considered one more cognitive skill. The presentations are 
made up of groups of paragraphs. The selection of the best 
paragraphs is based on a semantic understanding of the 
characteristics of the paragraphs, on the restrictions defined 
for the presentation and by the quality criteria appropriate for 
a public presentation. This work is part of the ROBONAUTA 
project of the Intelligent Control Research Group at the 
Universidad Politécnica de Madrid to create "awareness" in a 
robot guide. The software developed in the project has been 
verified on the tour-guide robot Urbano. The most important 
aspect of this proposal is that the design uses learning as the 
means to optimize the quality of the presentations.  To achieve 
this goal, the system has to perform the optimized decision 
making, in different phases. The modeling of the quality index 
of the presentation is made using fuzzy logic and it represents 
the beliefs of the robot about what is good, bad, or indifferent 
about a presentation. This fuzzy system is used to select the 
most appropriate group of paragraphs for a presentation. The 
beliefs of the robot continue to evolving in order to coincide 
with the opinions of the public. It uses a genetic algorithm for 
the evolution of the rules. With this tool, the tour guide-robot 
shows the presentation, which satisfies the objectives and 
restrictions, and automatically it identifies the best paragraphs 
in order to find the most suitable set of contents for every 
public profile. 
Keywords- Cognitive systems; learning; autonomous robot; 
fuzzy systems; decision making. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Autonomous robots are intelligent machines capable of 
performing tasks in the world by themselves, without explicit 
human control over their actions [1].  
Within the development of multiple applications for a 
mobile robot, probably one of the first real world 
applications of indoor service robots has been mobile robots 
serving as tour guides in museums or exhibitions. We have 
developed our own interactive mobile robot called Urbano 
specially designed to be a tour guide in exhibitions [2]. The 
basic characteristics of Urbano are described in Section 3. 
Our goal has been to create an automatic presentation 
generator that allows the flexible and dynamic display of 
information depending on the distinct kinds of audiences and 
other parameters that characterize the presentation. The 
automatic selection of contents for composing sophisticated 
presentations is a non-trivial task. If the aims of the 
presentation, preference and interest for a particular subject 
have to be taken into account, it becomes even more 
complex. 
The knowledge is based on an ontology of domain-
specific concept words. Ontologies have been known in 
computer science as consensual models of domains of 
discourse, usually implemented as formal definitions of the 
relevant conceptual entities [3]. 
Some of the most recent works about automatic 
generation are: [4][5][6][7][8]. These works propose 
different architectures and methodologies than those 
presented here. What is original is the introduction of fuzzy 
logic in the pruning of the resulting tree and in the quality 
index of the presentations. 
This paper is focused on the automatic generation of 
presentations by a robotic system. The MINERVA robot 
from Carnegie Mellon University was one of the first service 
robots for guiding tours. Others were Rhino,  from  Bonn 
University,  or  Xavier,  built  to  participate  in  AAAI  Robotic 
Competition in 1993. 
Aspects concerning the grounding of the symbols used 
by the robot, e.g., paragraphs in the presentation or the 
learning of new concepts – have been circumvented for 
problems of space. In [9], the authors explore the problem of 
learning and the symbol-grounding problem, and propose a 
systemic and integrative approach both problems. 
II. 
AUTOMATIC TEXT GENERATION  
The 
history 
of 
natural 
language 
processing 
is 
characterized by the influence of artificial intelligent 
[10][11]. A natural language generator generally has access 
to a wide knowledge field from which it must select 
information to present to the users in various formats. 
Generating text is, therefore, a decision-making problem 
with multiple restrictions: knowledge, available linguistic 
tools, the objectives of the user to whom the text will be 
directed, the situation, and past discourse. It deals with 
identifying the factors involved in this process and 
determining the factors that intervene in this process and its 
consequences [11][12][13].  
An additional contribution of our work is to provide a 
dynamic framework that allows us to take into account each 
possible scenario. On the other hand, there can be no single 
general-purpose presentation format for all users, because

each user differs in all aspects of interests and expertise 
levels, and in the devices used to visualize the requested 
information. These aspects are used as restrictions. 
As a result, to prepare a presentation, the candidate items 
can be multiple, depending on knowledge server. The items 
selected in the generation process contain information about 
the theme of the presentation, but must as well include the 
items that are semantically related to the presentation. Thus, 
for example, a discussion of the painter Velazquez will also 
speak about the Italian painter Caravaggio due to his 
influence on Velazquez.  
In our case a presentation generator is considered as a 
Cognitive Skill. It is assumed that skill development, e.g., 
giving presentations progressively more suitable to the 
public being addressed – is a fundamental architectural 
epiphenomenon. Rather than viewing a presentation as a 
mere form of communication, the focus here is on 
leveraging it as a means of expanding socio-communicative 
skills.  
Several research projects have been undertaken to 
develop software tools for generating narratives, histories or 
presentations, and they have described many characteristics 
for generating presentations, but the quality criteria vary 
[14][15].  
The decision rules to establish the fact that a particular 
swap in the presentation strategy is useful and required are 
not clear yet. An interesting situation arises when the data 
changes and the environment are dynamic. 
A. Quality criteria of a presentation 
The quality of a presentation is defined by the different 
aspects that it characterizes, referred to in [16], as: nature, 
purpose, duration, and number of participants; for other 
authors, such aspects as connecting with the audience, the 
interests of the participants, the first and last minute, changes 
of rhythm, and “being natural and having fun” are very 
important. All the aspects have in common the difficulty of 
being effectively quantified for a computer program. 
The prototype as developed has proposed the following 
quality criteria:  
• 
Differences in time used and the anticipated time 
• 
Time dedicated to the theme 
• 
Time dedicated to entertainment 
• 
Difficulty in understanding the theme 
• 
Interest in the theme 
• 
Time dedicated to related information (anecdotal) 
• 
Time for interaction with the public 
• 
Original information 
• 
Non-conventional focus 
These criteria are also used to obtain the assessment of 
the public.  
III. 
URBANO 
This Section describes the Urbano robot system, its 
hardware software and the experience we have obtained 
through its development and use until its actual mature stage. 
A. URBANO, an interactive Mobile Tour-Guide Robot 
This Section doesn´t pretend to be an exhaustive 
technical description of algorithms, mathematical or 
implementation detail, but just an overview of the system. 
Urbano robot is a B21r platform from iRobot, equipped 
with a four wheeled synchrodrive locomotion system, a 
SICK LMS200 laser scanner mounted horizontally in the top 
used for navigation and SLAM, and a mechatronic face and a 
robotic arm used to express emotions as happiness, sadness, 
surprise or anger.  
The robot is also equipped with two sonar rings and one 
infrared ring, which allows detecting obstacle at different 
heights that can be used for obstacle avoidance and safety. 
The platform has also two onboard PCs and one touch 
screen.  
The software is structured in several executable modules 
to allow a decoupled development by several teams of 
programmers, and they are connected via TCP/IP. Most of 
these executables are conceived as servers or services 
providers, as the face control, the arm control, the navigation 
systems voice synthesis and recognition, and the web server. 
The client-server paradigm is used, being the only client a 
central module that we call the Urbano Kernel. This kernel is 
the responsible of managing the whole system [2]. 
URBANO robot has a technology based on distributed 
application software. The recent version is an agent based on 
architecture that uses a specific CORBA approach as an 
integration tool.  The robot has many functions: speaks, 
listens, navigates through the environment, moves his arm, 
responses to stimuli that affect its feelings.

B. URBANOntology 
The knowledge server consists of a Java application 
developed using the libraries of Protégé-OWL API. The tool 
is capable of reading and editing files in “.owl” format 
where the knowledge is stored in the form of ontologies and 
the management of the information from the kernel is made 
by means of messages that codify the request of specific 
information, and the reply is obtained from the server or the 
introduction of new data.  
67

The functions of the knowledge server are: loading and 
saving ontologies; creating, renaming, and deleting classes or 
instances; displaying properties of a class; showing 
subclasses or superclasses; showing or entering the value of 
a property; integrating one ontology into another; handling 
queries. 
IV. 
APG AGENT  
APG agent software has been developed to be integrated 
in the architecture based on the agents that constitute the 
software of the Urbano robot. The developed computer 
application is activated on receiving a request from a user 
that selects a file that contains the pattern to be developed. 
APG will request all the information from the knowledge 
server agent, using restrictions that it needs to generate a file 
with the best presentation to be used by the system in the 
next performance by the robot. 
Figure 2 shows this flowchart. It must be mentioned that 
presentations have been stored with quality indices (QI) for 
each of them, and in some cases, when faced with a request 
very similar to a presentation already performed with high 
quality indices; this presentation will be used without 
needing to generate a new one. 
 
Figure 2.  Flowchart APG 
V. 
PARAGRAPHS 
The paragraph is used by the robot as the minimum 
element of expression. It is assumed that the paragraphs have 
a size such that coincidences or references between them 
lack meaning, and that they express a meaningful content. 
The following paragraph introduces the painting “Las 
Meninas” by Diego Velazquez: 
 
“A portrait of the infanta Margarita, daughter of Felipe 
IV (1605-1665), surrounded by her servants or ‘family’ in a 
hall of Madrid’s Alcázar Palace. 
This, the most famous of Velasquez’s works, offers a 
complex composition built with admirable skill in the use of 
perspective, the depiction of light, and the representation of 
atmosphere. 
There have been innumerable interpretations of this 
subject and later references to it. The most numerous 
emphasize a defense of the nobility of painting versus craft. 
Velasquez portrays himself, painting the painting itself, on 
the left of the canvas, thus affirming the supremacy of the art 
of painting. The infanta Margarita (1651-1673), wears white 
and appears in the center of the composition, surrounded by 
her ladies in waiting, the “meninas” María Agustina de 
Sarmiento and Isabel de Velasco, along with two court 
buffoons, María Bárbola and Nicolasito Pertusato, and a 
mastiff. Behind her, the duenna Marcela de Ulloa converses 
with the quartermaster, José Nieto, who is in the doorway. 
The King and Queen, Felipe IV and Maria de Austria 
(1634-1696) are reflected in the mirror at the back of the 
room, leading to series of extraordinarily complex spatial 
relations.” 
 
For each of the paragraphs there also exists a script that 
specifies the facial expressions and arm movements of the 
robot, the tone of voice and type of voice to use, the position 
in the floor plan, and various details for interaction with the 
public. 
But in the ontology, each paragraph is “related” to the 
categories, which it belongs (e.g., in the previous paragraph: 
Is_a Painting, Is_a Description, Is_a Adult Level, Painted_by 
Diego Velazquez, etc. These relationships are used for the 
selection of the paragraph). 
VI. 
PATTERNS AND TREES 
The pattern, defined by the user, signals the elements that 
should form part of the presentation. For each item, these 
elements are established: its identification, its priority, its 
numerical order, its reference to the theme within available 
knowledge. There could be a limitation of time and a very 
large patter, in that case the priority index indicates the most 
important content to be included, but there could be the 
opposite case, that there is time left, then the system 
incorporates content that it is not initially considered.  
It uses XML as the language to represent the patterns, 
which guarantees an easy use with different tools and 
programming languages. XML has emerged as a de facto 
standard for encoding and sharing data between various 
applications. XML is also useful for structured information 
68

management, including information contained in knowledge 
server [18]. Our proposal is to design a software tool that 
helps the user to create and maintain the patterns. 
APG requests from the knowledge server the paragraphs 
available for each theme, identified by its reference. The 
knowledge server will submit one or more paragraphs, 
because of a same concept can have several versions. Thus 
the pattern indicated in Figure 3 shows that first item of the 
presentation will be “museum_presentation” identified on 
the knowledge server as “Greetings” and it could involve, for 
example, three possible paragraphs, which will be included 
in the tree of possibilities, as is shown in Figure 4. 
Some global restrictions including the level of audience 
will be used to prune the tree, eliminating the paragraphs that 
do not correspond to the requested level.  
Three typical alternative heuristic searches have been 
tested to trim the tree. The first uses “brute force” to generate 
all the possible combinations and to group all the numeric 
values of the “quality criteria” of the paragraphs that form 
the presentation, and then, using a set of fuzzy rules, 
estimates the quality index. It selects the presentation with 
the highest index. See Figure 5.  
The second alternative uses “best-first search” so that as 
it goes along it takes the option that partially presents the 
best index. This alternative is without a doubt the fastest, but 
it cannot guarantee the selection of the best option. 
The third alternative modifies the previous one so that it 
generates “backtracking” if the quality index falls below a 
minimum.

Figure 4.  Tree Data Structure 
 
Figure 5.  Different options 
The presentation generated in this way analyzes the 
estimated time for its execution, and if this is greater than 
anticipated, it eliminates the paragraphs with the least 
necessary priority. On the other hand, if there is enough time, 
it includes some socially-oriented paragraphs such as jokes 
or comments about sports, politics, or local events. 
VII. DECISION-MAKING 
Decision-making is a part of the paradigm proposed by 
Zadeh [19] that has been currently examined in [20]. In a 
dynamic scenario as ours, and because of the nature of the 
information that the system will handle, proper tools are 
needed to provide the intelligence for decision-making and 
supervision. 
Decision-making is the cognitive process of selecting a 
course of action from multiple alternatives. Fuzzy set 
approaches to decision-making are usually most appropriate 
when human evaluations and the modeling of human 
knowledge are needed [21]. 
The proposed solution uses fuzzy rules to prune items to 
submit from the tree. It will use a variable that indicates the 
likelihood of inclusion in the submission of a particular 
content. The fuzzy system will generate these values.  
The fuzzy rules enable more flexibility. These rules will 
be adjusted and expanded. 
All information available at the moment about the quality 
criteria and its influence on the quality index is stored in the 
ontology of the knowledge server. 
The semantic network will indicate that the influence of 
time dedicated to the theme, expressed in a percentage, is 
 
<pattern> 
<id>children_visit_museum</id> 
<date_creation> … </date_creation> 
<date_lastused>…</date_ lastused>

VERY favorable if the time is VERY_HIGH but LOW 
favorable if the time is HIGH or NORMAL, and VERY 
unfavorable in any other case. This relationship is defined by 
belonging to specified categories. In the developed 
prototype, the fuzzy rules used to calculate the quality index 
are obtained by consulting the categories that belong to a 
criteria in the knowledge server.  
Five linguistic terms are defined: VERY_HIGH (VH), 
HIGH (H), NORMAL (N), LOW (L), VERY_LOW (VL). 
The fuzzyfication phase uses the function of membership to 
initially equidistant triangles, but in the learning phase their 
centers can vary. The exit variable quality_index is also 
modeled with five terms and triangular functions. The 
technique of centroid method is used in the defuzzyfication 
phase. 
  
Figure 6.  Inputs variables of the fuzzyfication phase 
 
An interesting aspect is the partial quality estimation for 
the presentation. When considering three paragraphs 
(#p1,#p2,#p3), for example, it may happen that some criteria 
have unrepresentative values; if, for example, #p1,#p2,#p3 
correspond to paragraphs of technical description, the 
entertainment criteria will be null and the presentation will 
have a low estimation. In the tests made using pruning the 
best-first search, presentations are obtained with very poor 
estimations, and to compensate for this effect, an option of 
the best-first was introduced, but rejecting presentations with 
a low index. 
If the categories of information expressed in the pattern 
are very generic, the number of possible presentations 
increases enormously, but it permits the robot to generate 
higher quality presentations.  
VIII. LEARNING PHASE 
The most important characteristic of the proposal is the 
ability of the robot to learn. Initially it is thought that the 
robot will have a small number of quality criteria available to 
evaluate some presentations as good and others as bad, 
corresponding to the minimum level of education for a 
professional guide, in order to guarantee a minimum level of 
quality in its presentations. 
A simple questionnaire has been designed that the public 
can fill out after attending a presentation by the robot. It asks 
for an evaluation of each quality criteria known at the time, 
indicating whether the robot should spend more or less time 
on each item, and a percentage evaluation of what the public 
considers valuable in the presentation. The Table I shows an 
example. 
 A proper statistical treatment of the questionnaires, 
eliminating the extremes and requiring a minimal quantity of 
data is performed.

A genetic algorithm is used, an adjustment of linguistic 
terms and the membership functions, will permit the quality 
index to be the closest to the average expressed by the 
public. To get a greater accuracy, the genetic algorithm is 
simultaneously used over several presentations as an attempt 
to offset the local minimals for a presentation.  
Learning is realized when new criteria of quality are 
incorporated in the paragraphs. 
 The genetic algorithm realizes a readjustment of the 
rules when it produces a disparity between public opinion 
and the IC. It utilizes a genetic algorithm for the evolution of 
the rules  
The + and – indications are used to eliminate individual 
cases generated by the genetic algorithm in which, while still 
generating a correct quality index, the evaluation of the 
criteria runs contrary to public opinion. 
In the tests carried out, it was shown that the “beliefs of 
the robot” about the quality indices converge toward public 
opinion, and as a result generate presentations that are 
evaluated more favorably. 
IX. 
CONCLUSION 
As a conclusion, special attention has been given to a 
mechanism for automatic generation of presentations, 
analysis 
of 
search 
algorithms, 
learning 
phase 
and 
optimization of fuzzy logic rules, taking into account the 
intrinsic difficulty of natural language processing and 
automatic generation. 
The generator is a dynamic system where knowledge will 
increase and, therefore, it will do the quality of the 
presentations. The robot will become increasingly better 
when making tour-guided visits. It also adds the ability to 
gesticulate while is conducting the presentation: it specifies 
the facial expressions and arm movements of the robot, the 
tone and type of voice to use, the position in the floor plan, 
and several other details for interaction with the public. 
This development will allow tour-guide robots to offer 
more affective learning and a dynamic tour-guide visit, 
because the public generally has become more sophisticated

and, also, its expectations and demands. It provides a better 
use of knowledge management. At the same time, advances 
in a new visitor-oriented approach, progress towards the 
creation of modular and scalable scenarios.  
It presents a novel approach to the use of a computer 
ontology to represent the corpus that the robot works with, 
and the quality criteria for a presentation.  
Methodology designed for the automatic generation of 
presentations can be used for other applications related with 
decision making for autonomous robots. In the Urbano 
project design; there is a scheduler agent that selects the best 
task between different tasks, which the system has to do in a 
day. The criteria used for selecting the adequate task in 
short-term plan can be revised to optimize the long-term 
objective. A happiness model, as long-term objective, and a 
decision-taking mechanism, as short-term planner, was 
modeled for Urbano. Both use fuzzy logic and are adjusted 
by genetic algorithms that use the public opinion to learn to 
be a good tour-guide robot.     
These systems have special importance to develop 
learning support for environments that require greater 
motivation and commitment, such as classrooms and 
workshops for students with special educational needs.
