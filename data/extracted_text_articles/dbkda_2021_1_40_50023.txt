Abstract—Social networks have become a primary commu-
nication tool and are used by hundreds of millions of users
daily. They bring together a wide variety of people, individ-
uals, companies, public ﬁgures, media, inﬂuencers, etc. Users
have different behaviours on social networks, such as different
publication frequencies, number of followers or different user
interactions. In the Twitter social network, for instance, users
do not reply, quote or use mentions in the same way. Our
intuition is that these interactions may characterise different user
types and we consequently present in this work a non-supervised
classiﬁcation method based on interaction scores. We propose and
experimentally compare different score estimations, leading our
experiments to conﬁrm the relevance of our approach.

I. INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, Online Social Networks (OSN) are omnipresent.
There are different kinds of OSN, providing different services.
Among the most famous ones, we can mention Twitter, which
allows users to share short messages, media (videos and
photos) and private messaging, Facebook, which proposes to
share with friends photos, videos, messages and even to sell
items or services, LinkedIn, which targets professional users
and proposes a recruitment service and YouTube that hosts
entertainement videos that users can stream. For several years,
these social networks have been analyzed in different contexts.
For instance, the content of some messages is analyzed to
deduce users sentiments regarding a company or a product for
marketing purposes. Recommendation systems use sociolog-
ical studies in attempt to understand users behaviour for ad-
vertising purposes or recommendations of friends connexions.
Other applications analyze content and/or user connections to
detect inappropriate content or criminal activity.
Community detection in social network analysis is also
gaining increasing attention as shown by the current tremen-
dous amount of researches in this area. Existing approaches
generally rely on the underlying social network graphs and at-
tempt to group highly connected or frequently communicating
users. Our goal here is quite different since we group people
according to their type of proﬁle: individuals, media, inﬂu-
encers, etc. The underlying assumption of this classiﬁcation is
that users react differently to messages contents, depending on
their proﬁle. We make use of interaction analysis to classify
user accounts and to automate users classiﬁcation.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In the Section
II, we present a state of the art on online social networks
researches. In the Section III, we present our datasets. Then,
in Section IV, we explain our data model. In the Section IV,
we present an analysis of our model on a global relational
graph from our dataset and the obtained results. Then, in the
Section VI, we present the same analysis, but this time on
speciﬁc relational graphs and the obtained results. Finally, in
the Section VII, we summarise the different analysis and future
work.
II. RELATED WORK
Twitter users classiﬁcation is mostly based on messages
content: some studies use linguistic content [11] to clas-
sify users by their political orientation [7] or ethnicity. [3]
proposes six different approaches to classify tweets content
based on different symbols, keywords, categories or interact-
ing messages into different groups, such as “Information”,
“Conversation”, “Broadcast”, or “Other”. Content analysis is
also employed by [2] which identiﬁes and classiﬁes users
in three categories: “Bot”, “Human” or “Cyborg” based on
message structures of entities such as URL, images, mentions,
etc. [13] and [1] identify users sub-graphs (i.e., community
detection) by using a PageRank-based clustering that spreads
computation scores through a random walk computation on
the graph structure. Network structure-based users clustering
and community detection are proposed by [10] and by [8].
The detected communities mainly reﬂect users’ connectivity
and messages spreading across the network.
Several approaches have been proposed to perform commu-
nity detection in social graphs, based on the follower/followee
graph. Users exchange information in a privileged way inside
the detected communities. Some existing methods determine
a measure of users authority inside a social network based on
node degrees [9]. Other approaches are based on the between-
ness centrality measure proposed by [4]. They compute node
authority depending on the distance between nodes, therefore
highlighting users who are in the middle of the network.
There are also approaches which consider recommendation
scores provided by a PageRank-like algorithm that considers
incoming links of nodes and that takes into consideration user
centrality. A node with an high score of PageRank is a popular
user with a high probability to propagate messages.

III. PRESENTATION OF OUR DATASET
To build our dataset, we use the Twitter API Stream that
allows us to collect 1% of all tweets published on the platform.
We collected tweets during a 5-month period of observation.
We ﬁlter them to obtain two datasets: the ﬁrst dataset gathers
tweets about COVID, and the second dataset is composed of
all tweets about NBA (National Basketball Association). Our
ﬁnal datasets consist of around 24 millions tweets.
NBA Dataset
The NBA dataset consists of 5M tweets produced by 2M
unique users. From this 5M tweets, we identiﬁed 4.9M in-
teractions (Retweet, Quote, Reply and Mention). It is
important to note that not all tweets correspond to interactions
while, at the same time various tweets may contain several
interactions (such as retweets and/or quotes). To build the
interaction graph used in our experiments, we only kept users
that performed at least two interactions. Then, we computed
the largest connected component (we used the NetworkX
Python library [5]). This pre-processing step avoids to get a
small sub-graph with isolated nodes that can reduce the global
PageRank score of graph nodes.
The main characteristics of the NBA dataset are presented
in Table I.
COVID Dataset
The COVID dataset consists of 21M tweets which allow to
build an interaction graph of 6 million unique users and 17
million interactions. The extraction of the largest connected
component during the pre-processing step produces a graph
with 2,789,316 users.
The main characteristics of the COVID dataset are presented
in Table II.
IV. THE DATA MODEL
We introduce in this section our notations and our data
model. We consider the Twitter platform and its underlying
directed graph of interactions G = (U, E) where U denotes the
set of nodes, i.e. users, E ⊆ U ×U is the set of edges, such that
(u1, u2) ∈ E means that user u2 performed an action on the
tweets of user u1. We denote A the set of possible interactions
that a user can execute on another user tweet. In the following,
we consider that A = {art, aqt, arp, amt}, which corresponds
respectively to the actions of Retweet, Quote, Reply and
Mention.
The restriction of the interaction graph G to a given action
a ∈ A denoted Ga is the graph Ga = (Ua, Ea) with Ua ⊆ U and
Ea ⊆ E such as (u1, u2) ∈ Ea if u2 performed an interaction
of type a on a tweet of u1.
Obviously, all edges from an interaction graph do not
represent the same level of interaction between users. Some
interactions may happen frequently, while others may happen
rarely. To capture this notion, we deﬁne an interaction weight
ω as follows:
Deﬁnition 1 (Global interaction weight): The global interac-
tion weight ω is a function ω : E → R that takes into account
all interactions between user couples.
Deﬁnition 2 (Speciﬁc interaction weight): The speciﬁc
interaction weight ω for an action a ∈ A is a function
ω : E ×A → R. This score is mainly based on the interactions
of a type a ∈ A and gives less (or no) importance to other
types of interaction.
Finally, we assume the existence of a function count :
E × A → N, such as count((u1, u2), a) is the number of
interactions of type a that u2 performed on tweets of u1.
V. GLOBAL INTERACTION SCORE-BASED CLUSTERING
This approach is a little different from our original goal,
which aimed to identify users with the same “proﬁle” (role)
within the social network using different interactions. Our
intuition is, that clustering based on diff Better interactions
between users provide more relevant clusters.
A. Global interaction occurrences-based clustering
Deﬁnition 3 (Occurrences-based global interaction score):
The occurrences-based global interaction score σg
u for a user
u is deﬁned as:
∀v ∈ U, ω(v, u) = Σa∈A count((v, u), a)
σg
u = log

Σv∈U ω(v, u)
maxw∈U(Σv∈U ω(w, v)

(1)
Note the normalization of the score and the usage of the
log function to smooth the differences between accounts.
According to this interaction score, since data is not tagged,
we decided to use a non-supervised clustering. More precisely,
we chose the K-Means clustering algorithm for its scalability
and because it is known to give good clustering results. To
determine the number of K-clusters, we rely on the Silhouette
Score [12].
For the occurrences-based global interaction score approach,
we observe that the Silhouette score is increasing with the
number of clusters (see Fig. 1). It illustrates that no clusters
number appears to be better than another (except maybe
clusters with a single user). Moreover, the manual analysis
of a clustering, for example with K = 4 or K = 5 reveals
that the clusters obtained contain very heterogeneous classes
of users.
B. Global interaction PageRank-based clustering
It has been shown that PageRank can accurately compute
inﬂuence ranks since it is not inﬂuenced by the number of
followers but by the user interactions [6]. Consequently, we
expect that a PageRank-based global interaction score will
provide a better user classiﬁcation. The PageRank score for
a user ui ∈ U is estimated by the following formula:
PR(ui) = (1 − α) + α
X
uj∈In(ui)
PR(uj)
Out(uj)

Fig. 1. Log Basic Approach: K-Means silhouette
where In(ui) denotes the set of users that have an interac-
tion with ui (i.e., {uj ∈ U, (ui, uj) ∈ E), Out(uj) the out-
degree of user uj, α is a dumping factor.
We take into consideration multiple occurrences of the same
interaction between two users by supposing that they illustrate
a strong interaction between those users. This is modeled by
the edges weights of the interaction graph G. The weight of
an edge between two users is the total number of interac-
tions between them. In order to compute a PageRank score
using edges weight, we use the Weighted PageRank (WPR)
Algorithm [14]. WPR assigns higher scores to more important
nodes instead of dividing the score between their neighbours.
Nodes will get a value proportional to their number of in-
interactions (interactions a user had with his tweets) and out-
interactions (interactions a user had with tweets of other users).
Consequently, we adopt the following deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition 4 (Interaction weights):
The in-interactions weight Win
(i,j) and out-interactions weight
Wout
(i,j) for an edge (ui, uj) ∈ E are estimated as:
Win
(i,j) =
P
a∈A
count((uj, ui), a)
P
v∈In(ui)
P
a∈A
count((v, ui), a)
Wout
(i,j) =
P
a∈A
count((ui, uj), a)
P
v∈Out(ui)
P
a∈A
count((ui, v), a)
(3)
Finally, we adapt the Weighted PageRank proposed in [14]
to take into consideration interaction weights on edges.
Deﬁnition 5 (Weighted interaction PageRank score):
Using the previous PageRank formula and the interaction
weights deﬁned above, we estimate:
WPR(ui) = (1 − α) + α
X
pj∈In(ui)
WPR(uj) × Win
(j,i) × Wout

VI. INTERACTION PROFILES-BASED CLUSTERING
By considering all interactions as similar, we are masking
differences in the user behaviours. Indeed, the analysis of a

few accounts seems to reveal that some users appear to favour
certain interactions over others and this could be a relevant
classiﬁcation criterion. To verify this intuition, we built an
interaction proﬁle for the users that is deﬁned as follows:
Deﬁnition 6 (Interaction proﬁle): The interaction proﬁle of
a user u is a quadruplet σp
u(σrt(u), σqt(u), σrp(u), σmt(u))
where each dimension σa is the speciﬁc interaction score
determined on the graph restriction Ga.
As for the global approach, we compare the straightforward
approach with speciﬁc interaction scores estimated with the
number of interactions of the corresponding action, and the
PageRank one.
A. Occurrences-based interaction proﬁles
For this approach, we consider that a speciﬁc interaction
weight for an interaction a is estimated on the restricted graph
Ga as:
∀(u, v, a) ∈ U2 × A, ω(u, v, a) = count((u, v), a)
(5)
Consequently, our interaction proﬁle scores are estimated as
follows:
Deﬁnition
7
(Occurrences-based
interaction
proﬁles
scores): The scores for the occurrences-based interaction
approach σp
u for a user u is deﬁned as:
∀a ∈ A, σa(u) = log

Σv∈Uω((v, u), a)
maxw∈U(Σv∈Uω((w, v), a)

(6)
Once these scores are computed, we perform the K-Means
non-supervised clustering. To evaluate the clustering quality,
we have performed a human validation which consists of
manually analyzing a sample of 50 accounts randomly chosen
inside each cluster.
We observe that, with the occurrences-based interaction
proﬁle approach, our clusters remain heterogeneous, as well as
with the occurrences-based global approach: all kinds of users
are present in each cluster. This phenomenon can be explained
by the fact that this method only uses in-degree values. How-
ever, we aim at classifying users based on interactions on their
messages. It has been shown that messages shared by popular
or central users of the graph can be spread efﬁciently [15].
B. PageRank-based interaction proﬁles
Instead of a straightforward interaction scores computation,
based on the number of occurrences, we estimate them using
a PageRank approach. Therefore, we considered the graph
restriction Ga of each interaction and performed the weighted
PageRank algorithm to compute the associated dimension
of the interaction proﬁle. Our intuition is that capturing the
“inﬂuence” of a user on a given interaction ( i.e. his capacity
to generate a given interaction on the network) better charac-
terizes a user behaviour.
Deﬁnition 8 (PageRank-based interaction proﬁles scores):
The scores for the PageRank-based interaction approach σp
u
for a user u is deﬁned as:
∀a ∈ A, σa(u) = WPRGa(u)

where WPRGa(u) is the Weighted PageRank score com-
puted for u on the graph Ga, and Ga is the reduction of the
graph G for the interaction a.
Once these scores are computed, we also perform the
K-Means non-supervised clustering. The clustering produces
clusters with very different characteristics (see Table III).
Globally, we see that Reply actions are what is mostly done
by real individual users. On the contrary, entities (companies,
media, etc) generate more Retweet actions. Mention can
be generated by both human and entities. As there is also
a correlation between popularity and Retweet actions, we
can consider Quote as a kind of Retweet. Using weighted
PageRank on the different interaction graphs to estimate the
interaction scores allows to demonstrate the importance of
the nodes that interact with the user. This is why we obtain
homogeneous clusters with a large majority of similar users.
As for the occurrences-based interaction proﬁle approach,
we evaluated clustering quality with a human validation by
manually analyzing (i.e Read users timelines, descriptions,
photos) a sample of 50 accounts randomly chosen inside
each cluster. Since the clusters are more homogeneous, it was
possible to qualify the different classes of users we identiﬁed.
Table IV presents the results of our analysis where Types are
deﬁned from our manual analysis of each account.
Finally, we perform a last experiment to validate our clus-
tering. We consider 100 new users we manually “tagged”
with a cluster id, according to the cluster composition we
observed with our initial dataset. Then, we use our clustering
algorithm to allocate them in a cluster. For these new users,
we obtain that 96% of them were tagged with the good cluster
id, which means that the clusters we obtained correspond to
well-identiﬁed classes of users.

VII. CONCLUSION
This article presents a method to cluster Twitter users
based on the interactions on their tweets. Based on interaction
graphs and Weighted PageRank computation, we determine
the user interaction proﬁles. Then, we perform a K-means
non-supervised clustering which groups users with similar
interaction proﬁles. Our experiments and manual validation
conﬁrm that this approach provides relevant clusters. As future
work, we intend to study the parameters that inﬂuence the
differences between the number of followers within the same
cluster. We will also consider the graph dynamicity to propose
an adaptive cluster re-computation on a sliding window.
