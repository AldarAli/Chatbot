Abstract—Related to the quality of the agricultural spraying
processes, the variable hydraulic pressure plays an important
role. All spray nozzles when operating are subjected to the
hydraulic pressure along the boom. Furthermore, in real sprayers
systems the losses in the hydraulic pressure which occur along
the boom, where one may ﬁnd the placed nozzles, are in general
veriﬁed with the use of pressure sensors in each nozzle. However,
such arrangement has high costs for the agricultural producers
and involves a larger complexity in the electronics for signal
processing, monitoring and control. The hydraulic system of
agricultural sprayers has a direct analog in electric circuits, and
thus, it is possible to be represented as an equivalent circuit
formed by a voltage source and a resistance which characterizes
the internal loss of the system. This paper, presents a method
that makes possible the evaluation of the hydraulic pressure
drop in bars of sprayer systems considering the ﬂuid hydraulic
resistance as a part of a sensor element, associated with a point-
wise Thévenin’s equivalent measurement method. This makes
feasible such evaluations with lower cost and greater accuracy,
as well as the control of the pressure drop. Thus, taking into
account a metering-based approach it was possible to obtain a
parametrized relationship among operating conditions and ﬂuid
resistances. Therefore, it was possible to obtain the hydraulic
equivalent of a sprayer system with direct injection based only on
the hydraulic ﬂow and pressure measurements. The results have
shown that is possible to get the hydraulic equivalent resistance
with a relative error equal to 2.1529%.

INTRODUCTION
Today, hydraulic systems can be found in a wide variety
of applications, also in agriculture. For such systems it is
important the determination of the internal losses occurring
not only for the establishment of valves’ upstream and down-
stream pressure but also to calculate the ﬂow rates through
piping systems. Additionally, such information can help in the
establishment of the ﬂow rate range, associated with the design
and size of the pumps, compressors, turbines and the relief
headers to ensure that back pressure on the relief devices not
preventing them from functioning properly [1].
The ﬂuid hydraulic resistance is a function of the ﬂow
regime, therefore being dependent of the Reynolds number and
the relative pipe. The Reynolds number for pipes, in turn, is a
function of the velocity (m/s), density (kg/m3), and viscosity
(Pa·s) of the ﬂuid, as well as of their internal diameters. Since
the temperature also affects the Reynolds number, it becomes
important to take that into account when one is working with
sprayers systems [2], [3]. Besides, the ﬂuid hydraulic resistance
is subject to temporal variations, and requires considerable
effort for its determination. In this scenario a sensor that can
measure the internal losses of the hydraulic boom pressure in
sprayers is very much required.
Pesticide application is a vital component for food security,
whose production is directly connected to pest control. Sprayer
is the machine used to apply liquid chemicals on plants to
control pest and diseases. In addition, it can be used to apply
herbicides to control weeds and to spray micro nutrients to
enhance plants growth. There are many types of sprayer’s
commercially available for producers and they are designed for
its own particular duties and use. Regarding to such matter one
may ﬁnd backpack sprayers, hand compression sprayers, self-
propelled sprayers and pull-behind sprayers, among others.
The manual application method was the ﬁrst to be used in
agriculture, but they have the disadvantage to present a higher
risk to the human resources. On the other hand, turning off
sprayers when there is no target, or adjusting application rates
based on canopy size and density became to be essential for
production with sustainability, i.e., in such matter the auto-
mated sprayers play an important role. Close to the 90 decade,
manufacturers introduced precision spraying technology in
boom sprayers [4]. Despite being still an open ﬁeld for research
and innovation, in this direction the variable rate methods,
using the Global Position System (GPS) and the Geographic

Information System (GIS) technologies were integrated into
boom sprayers and became already commercially available.
The GPS and GIS have been popularized and the com-
bination of these two technologies allowed the diffusion of
Precision Agriculture (PA) in the entire world. The PA brings
together the use of technologies for the management of soil,
inputs and crops, in a manner appropriate to the spatial and
temporal variations in factors, which affect their productivity,
in order to increase efﬁciency.
The adoption of PA for localized application of agro-
chemicals can reduce pesticide wastage and environmental
aggression, providing a more efﬁcient production of large-scale
food and increasing agricultural productivity. With localized
application of agrochemicals, herbicide savings is in the order
of 30 to 80% compared to the uniform application in the total
area. Automatic sprayers designed and developed for localized
application are currently available, allowing the use of large
volume of syrup, covering large agricultural areas [5]–[8].
In this ﬁeld of knowledge, there are the use of conventional
and direct injection sprayers system. The ﬁrst type of direct
injection system was developed between the 70’s and 80’s
decades. However in that time such a system presented high
cost, complexity of operation and low performance. According
to Baio and Antuniassi [7], the main characteristic of direct
injection systems is related to the storage of the diluent (water)
and the pesticide in separate containers.
The mixing is carried out only at the time of application,
by injection of the pesticide into the piping, which carries
the syrup to the nozzles of the sprayer. The amount of
injected pesticide can be accomplished, among other ways,
by controlling the rotation of the piston or peristaltic injection
pumps. The main advantages of the injection system are the
reduction of risks involved during the application process [9].
Other aspects one should be taken into account, in relation
to this matter, is the beneﬁt/cost rate is terms of the use of
energy in the agricultural machinery. The success of agri-
culture, manufacturing, transportation, military systems and
construction machinery owes much to the efﬁcient use of
ﬂuid energy. Most ﬂuid energy systems are conﬁgured with
a positive ﬂow displacement pump that is large enough to
meet the ﬂow requirements of many circuits. Different work
functions require a variety of ﬂow and pressure values to
provide the desired operation. Branches of the system therefore
must include speciﬁc ﬂow and pressure regulating valves.
In the process of agricultural spraying, it is of great
importance to know the value of the ﬂuid resistance of the
spray boom since, variations in this resistance can affect the
quality of the application, i.e., size and volume of drops,
distribution of drops on the crop and the drift of the drops
produced by the wind [10]. Droplet size and distribution are
critical factors in such processes because can be affected the
penetration, coverage and drift of the application on the crop
[11].
The design of a hydraulic system can be improved with
the use of mathematical simulation. Numerous approaches to
energy systems modeling ﬂuids and components, can be found
in the literature. Analysis of a ﬂuid feed system can cover
the ﬂow distribution, the functioning of components, or a
combination of both. Most of the useful equations for ﬂuid
analysis are derived from the law of conservation of energy,
the principle of continuity, and Newton’s second law [12].
Equations used to calculate ﬂow in circuits involve the
use of empirical expressions or laboratory-derived ﬂow co-
efﬁcients. Therefore, when two or more circuits are used
simultaneously, the principle of continuity may not be obeyed
exactly, because of the use of such empirical coefﬁcients. To
model a ﬂow regulating valve, a good medium must also
be used to deﬁne how the ﬂow divides in the active circuit
branches.
Usually, this is done by writing a set of equations to
determine the desired pressure and ﬂow values, which can be
solved via an iterative method. Iterative methods work well for
steady state ﬂow conditions, however, they are difﬁcult to apply
to non-steady state operations. In relation to such subject Akers
and collaborators have shown a method based on electrical-
hydraulic analogy was proposed [2]. In this method, ﬂuid
pressure, ﬂow, and ﬂow resistance are analogous to voltage,
current, and electrical resistance, respectively. The method uses
the basic principle of the Ohm’s law, also referred to as the
hydraulic Ohm.
On the other hand, a ﬂuid moves inside a pipe occurs a
ﬂuid friction with the inner walls of this pipe and a turbulence
of the ﬂuid with itself. This phenomenon causes the pressure
inside the pipe to gradually decrease as the ﬂuid moves and the
pressure decrease is known as the pressure drop. In this way,
the load loss would be related to a resistance to the passage of
the ﬂow of the ﬂuid inside the pipe, this resistance is known
as ﬂuid resistance and affects directly the monomeric height
of a pump denoted H and its volumetric ﬂow denoted Q. The
pressure (p) can be related to the volumetric ﬂow rate by:
p = fa
Lρ
2DA2 Q2
(1)
for a rough pipe with turbulent ﬂow or:
p = 8πLµ
A2 Q2
(2)
for a ﬂat tube with laminar ﬂow, where fa is the coefﬁcient
of friction [dimensionless], ρ is the speciﬁc mass of the ﬂuid
[kg/m3], L is the equivalent pipe length [m], D is the internal
diameter of the pipe [m], A is the inner area of the straight
section of the pipe [m2] and µ is the absolute viscosity of the
ﬂuid [Pa · s].
The coefﬁcient of friction fa, sometimes known as a
Moody friction factor or also as a distributed load loss co-
efﬁcient determined by mathematical equations, is a function
of the Reynolds number (Re) and relative roughness. Exper-
imental identiﬁcation of fa is more common due to the non
linear characteristics involved. For pipes that undergo changes
in pipe diameters, in general, ﬂow type or over-curves, ﬂuid
resistance may be related to the remainder of the ﬂuid system
by:
√
∆P = RQ
(3)
where ∆P is the pressure drop across the hydraulic element
and R is the ﬂuid resistance. For a tube, the ﬂuid resistance
is given by:
R =

The next sections of the paper are organized as follows. In
Section II, the methodology used to obtain the function relating
the hole diameter with the ﬂow in a nozzle is given. In Section
III, an experimental validation of the pointwise Thévenin’s
equivalent and the nozzle ﬂow using a laboratory sprayer setup
is performed. Finally, some concluding remarks are presented
in Section IV.

METHODOLOGY
The well known Thévenin’s equivalent circuit of a linear
circuit is composed of an equivalent impedance and voltage,
which for some cases are organized just with a resistor and
a source of continuous voltage. This equivalent circuit is
obtained through Thévenin’s Theorem:
Theorem 1 (Thévenin’s Theorem):
Vth
=
Voc
(6)
Rth
=
Voc
Isc
(7)
where Isc is the short-circuit current and Voc the open circuit
voltage [13]–[16].
The Thévenin’s equivalent circuit can be represented by
Fig 1. In Fig. 1, the voltage and current are described by:
I
=
Vth
Rth + R
(8)
V
=
RI = −RthI + Vth.
(9)
Figure 1. Thévenin’s equivalent circuit.
Let y(1) and y(2) denote current measurements taken with
values of load R in Fig. 1 for R(1) and R(2), respectively.
According to Bhattacharyya and collaborators [17] and Mohs-
enizadeh and collaborators [18], the Thévenin’s equivalent can
also be obtained by solving the linear equation system, in terms
of α0 and β0:

y(1)

y(2)
−1
 
α0
β0

=

−y(1)R(1)
−y(2)R(2)

(10)
where α0 and β0 are given by:
α0
=
Rth
(11)
β0
=
Vth.
(12)
if one is considering a linear characteristic then is possible to
write:
Voc
=
Vth
(13)
Isc
=
Vth
Rth
.
(14)
Otherwise, one can consider, as a further step, the electric
analog already described in Section I, then V = √∆p e Vth =
√∆pth. Now, let y(1) e y(2) be a measure of ﬂow in the boom
with the nozzles of interest, where R(1) and R(2) correspond
to the equivalent ﬂuid resistance of the nozzles of the boom
of interest, thus:

Q(1)
−1
Q(2)
−1
 
α0
β0

=

−√∆p(1)
−√∆p(2)

(15)
where α0 e β0 are given by:
α0
=
Rth
(16)
β0
=
∆pth.
(17)
where Rth and ∆pth are the internal loss equivalent and the
internal pressure equivalent, respectively. As the behavior of
pressure and ﬂow is non-linear, then there will be more than
one possible representation of the Thévenin’s equivalent. If the
measurements are taken as close as possible to each other, it
is then said that a pointwise Thévenin’s equivalent is obtained.
It is known that the ﬂow in a nozzle is a function of the hole
diameter denoted d, pressure and other hydraulic parameters,
which may change with different types of nozzle. Then, it is
possible to ﬁnd a function which relates the hole diameter
with the ﬂow in a nozzle. If consider the rank in relation
to parameter d and pressure p of the matrices appearing in
the description of the ﬂow Q as one, again according with
Bhattacharyya and collaborators [17] it is possible to ﬁnd:
Q = β0 + β1d + β2p + β3dp
α0 + α1d + α2p + dp
(18)
where β0, β1, β2, β3, α0, α1 and α2 are constants and (α0 +
α1d+α2p+dp) ̸= 0. To ﬁnd these constants, one should take
just 7 measurements with different values of d and p and solve
the following linear system:

EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION
The Agricultural Sprayer Development System (SDPA)
used is located at the Laboratory of Agricultural Precision
Spraying of the Embrapa Instrumentation (Fig. 2) in São
Carlos, SP, Brazil [9], [19], [20]. The goal is to obtain linear
pressure and ﬂuid resistance equivalent by selecting a boom
with nozzles of interest using regular measurements. This is
possible by solving (10).
Figure 2. Hydraulic and electrical conﬁguration of the SDPA for testing and validation.
A. Thévenin’s Equivalent Validation
To obtain the hydraulic Thevenin equivalent, according to
the proposed methodology, only two different ﬂuid resistances
are required. However, it is necessary that when the ﬂuid
resistance changes, a signiﬁcant variation of pressure and ﬂow
occurs at the point of interest. Otherwise, if any of these
measures are kept constant, the equivalent will have the trivial
solution.
As the pressure is regulated in the system, a pressure
variation of approximately 0.1 bar was considered signiﬁcant
because of the inherent noise of the spray sensors. The
objective is to extract the Thévenin’s equivalent of the central
sprayer boom which is also shown in Fig. 2. All nozzles of
the central spray boom are of type CH05.
1) Measurements set up: Each sprayer boom has 3 spray
nozzles. First, the pump pressure was set at 3.5 bar and the
pressure at the center boom spray nozzles was found to be
about 3.48 bar. After this veriﬁcation, just one nozzle was
changed to type CH3. The pressure in the spray nozzles rose
to 3.47 bar and was therefore considered as noise. Another
attempt was made on in the same nozzle that was replaced by
a nozzle type CH6 (which allows the greatest possible ﬂow
between the nozzles of this line). The pressure in the nozzles
rose to 3.46 and was again considered as noise. Two nozzle
were then replaced by CH3 type nozzles and the pressure in
the spray nozzles was found to be 3.44 bar, also considered
to be noise. In this way, all the nozzles of the central bar
were changed to type CH3 and the pressure in that time was
equal to 3.39 bar. This pressure drop was then considered as
signiﬁcant and thus concluding that for the system to stop
regulating the pressure in the bar it became necessary to change
all the nozzles of the bar.
To extract the Thévenin’s equivalent, only two different
nozzles are required. However, to validate the obtained equiv-
alent, three nozzles were used, where the third nozzle has an
intermediate ﬂuid resistance between the other two nozzles
used for extraction of the equivalent. Then, the nozzles of the
central boom were changed in the row of full cone nozzles
and the pressure and ﬂow measurements taken. The data are
shown in Table I.
2) Results: Using (15), the following equivalent was ob-
tained:
∆Pth = 3.4394 [bar]
Rth = 0.0649 [bar · min · L−1].

To validate (18) which relates the ﬂow to the hole diameter,
a single nozzle was used. The datasheet of a nozzle MAG CH,
produced by MAGNOJET R

ﬁnd the values of pressure and ﬂow for each nozzle. The
hole diameter was measured using a pachymeter. The 7 points
shown in Table II were selected, which cover all the producer
table, and were used to solve the linear system (19). With the
solution of (19), it was possible to generate the surface shown

CONCLUSION
In this paper, the measurement-based approach was used to
emulate the behavior of a sensor to allow the quality analyses
of direct injection sprayers. With few measurements, the ﬂuid
resistance equivalent of a piping system was obtained. In
addiction, a ﬂow function of a full cone nozzle relating the
nozzle internal diameter and pressure were estimated. The
results obtained were satisfactory and the extension of this
work includes the hardware implementation of the sensor and
the application of the measurement-based approach to quality
control of spray droplets in agriculture.
