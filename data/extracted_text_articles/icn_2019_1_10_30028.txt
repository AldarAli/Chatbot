Abstract—The growing interest in Internet of Things (IoT) has 
facilitated the appearance of applications which use Low-
Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN). Networks based on the 
Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) standard 
highlight among these. This paper presents a wide overview of 
this recent technology and some practical experiments. The 
developed LoRaWAN devices that compose the network as 
well as the server used to collect data are presented. Based on 
this testbed, some experiments are performed in two different 
scenarios to check the performance in terms of coverage, 
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Received Signal Strength 
Indicator (RSSI). Results show that LoRaWAN networks can 
be a useful solution to implement monitoring networks.

 INTRODUCTION 
The evolution of technologies and the ability to 
interconnect different devices have led to the existence of 
networks capable of communicating and acting together, 
creating what is known as Internet of Things (IoT) [1]. 
Thanks to sensors and actuators, it is possible to measure our 
environment and share data which, collected by platforms, 
allows the developers to create useful applications for the 
society [2]. The critical point in many scenarios resides in 
the energy consumption due to the batteries which feed these 
things. This is why so-called LPWAN technologies, which 
permit low power transmission, have been developed. In 
return, the transmission data rate is reduced (e.g., hundreds 
of kbps) but it is still enough for many IoT applications. 
Because of their standardization and the usage of non-
licensed spectrum, these technologies have become serious 
competitors of solutions based on cellular networks, such as 
Long 
Term 
Evolution-Category 
M 
(LTE-M) 
or 
NarrowBand-IoT (NB-IoT) [3]. The most popular LPWAN 
technologies are Sigfox, LoRaWAN, Ingenu TPMA, and 
nWave. Their main characteristics and differences, assuming 
European parameters, are shown in Table I. 
In this paper, we present the LoRaWAN technology and 
its main features to be considered for deploying this kind of 
networks. The paper also presents the devices we develop 
that compose our network and the server used to collect the 
data. Finally, practical experiments are carried out in two 
different scenarios to check the actual performance of this 
kind of networks.

RELATED WORK 
In this section, we present the related work on LoRa and 
LoRaWAN 
performance 
evaluations 
and 
LoRa 
implementations.  
A performance analysis of the LoRa FABIAN network 
protocol stack for IoT, that employs protocols, such as 
CoAP, HTTP and DNS, was performed by Tara Petrić et al. 
in [4]. Authors evaluated the Packet Error Rate (PER), the 
Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the Signal to 
Noise Ratio (SNR) of three LoRa stations deployed over 
Rennes, France. They highlighted the importance of the 
location and elevation of the antenna on the performance. 
Results showed frame losses of 3% under the best 
conditions. Authors concluded that SNR could be the best 
metric as RSSI did not present strong correlations.  
A performance analysis of LoRa over critical noise 
conditions was performed by L. Angrisani et al. in [5]. For 
the transmitter, a LoRa STM32 Nucleo pack comprised of a 
SX1272 low-power RF shield and a NUCLEO-L073RZ 
board was utilized. The testbed utilized a master-slave 
configuration between the transmitter and receiver and 
employed LabView to perform the measurements. Results 
showed worse communication with larger bandwidth 
configurations. High SF (Spreading Factor) values achieve 
better performance. Finally, higher CR (Coding Rate) values 
obtained lower improvements in packet loss.

LoRa servers have been implemented in order to be 
utilized for different types of applications. Jaeyoung So et al. 
implemented in [6] a LoRa server on OpenStack called 
LoRaCloud. Authors employed four virtual machines to 
implement the functions of LoRaCloud. These functions 
were the application server agent, the gateway agent, LoRa 
data and LoRa control. The gateway was implemented 
employing the SK-iM880A and the LoRa device was 
implemented with the 868 IoT station (Kerlink), using 
Semtech’s HAL as software.  
T. Hirata et al. presented in [7] a rice field management 
system employing LoRa servers. The servers were 
comprised of an AVR microcontroller, an SD card module, a 
LoRa module and a battery. The master was implemented 
utilizing a Raspberry Pi. Experiments were performed for 
seven days employing seven field servers. Results showed a 
power consumption of 75.36 mW per day providing the 
system with a 995-day continuous operation time.  
Lastly, W. Zhao et al. implemented in [8] a smart 
irrigation system that utilized LoRa as the communication 
protocol. The system was comprised of a LoRa server for 
validation, description and data analysis, a cloud server for 
data storage and, as an interface between the applications and 
the LoRa server, the irrigation nodes and the gateway. Real 
experiments were performed measuring SNR and RSSI 
every 500 meters. Results showed that the SNR decreased 20 
dBm and the RSSI presented a sharp decrease in the first 
kilometer. However, the SNR presented a slow decrease and 
RSSI remained stable in the last 7 km. Moreover, a 
communication distance of 8 km was achieved between node 
and gateway. 
Other papers have studied performance analysis of LoRa 
or have used LoRa for diverse IoT systems. In this paper, we 
focus on the performance analysis of LoRaWAN with the 
implementation of TTN (The Things Network). 
III. 
LORAWAN OVERVIEW 
This section presents some of the most important issues 
to be taken into account for deploying a LoRaWAN netwotk. 
A. LoRa Modulation 
LoRa® (Long Range) is a proprietary modulation of 
Semtech. It is based on CSS (Chirp Spread Spectrum) and 
aims at increasing the communication range while keeping 
the same low power characteristics of the FSK modulation. 
This modulation uses the full channel bandwidth to send 
signals, making a distinction between ’up-chirp’ and ’down- 
chirp’. ’Up-chirp’ refers to transmissions in which the 
frequency changes from the lowest to the highest value, and 
’down-chirp’ refers to the opposite situation. This technique 
allows LoRa to modulate its symbols in ’up-chirps’ with a 
bandwidth of 125 kHz, 250 kHz or 500 kHz and with 
different Spreading Factors (SF) depending on the required 
data rate and channel conditions [9][10]. 
B. LoRaWAN Networks 
The LoRaWAN standard, which is managed by the LoRa 
Alliance, defines a protocol architecture (specifying the 
Medium Access Control layer or MAC) and a system 
architecture. This standard allows devices to use either FSK 
or LoRa as modulations on the physical layer. 
Regarding its architecture, it uses a star topology with a 
central device known as gateway. End- nodes communicate 
directly with the gateway through the radio interface. The 
gateway uses a normal network interface (e.g., Ethernet or 
Wi-Fi) to communicate with an application server through a 
network server. The usage of a star topology, instead of mesh 
network architecture, increases the lifetime of batteries, 
network capacity, security and quality of service (QoS), 
among other characteristics. In a mesh network, each node 
would act as an end-node and as a gateway (router) [11], 
which causes a greater number of hops and their 
corresponding packet forwarding, hence producing higher 
power consumption. 
Nodes are not associated with specific gateways. Instead 
of this, any message received by a gateway will be 
forwarded to its network server, and these, in turn, will 
forward it to its application server.  
Bi-directional 
communication 
between 
nodes 
and 
gateways are allowed by LoRaWAN. In particular, there are 
three classes of end-nodes named A, B and C [10]. Class A 
must be implemented by all the nodes, and all the classes are 
able to coexist in the same network. The characteristics of 
each class, whose transmission is depicted in Figure 1, are 
defined below: 
• 
Class A: It is the class that consumes the lowest 
possible power. It is used in applications with 
unidirectional communication (from nodes to 
gateway), allowing a transmission in the downlink 
direction just after the node has finished its 
transmission. It is suitable for battery-based sensors. 
• 
Class B: It is characterized by the possibility of 
opening 
extra reception windows 
at 
certain 
moments, in order to increase transmissions from the 
gateway to the nodes. For this reason, the 
consumption is higher than that of class A. This class 
is suitable for battery-powered actuators. 
• 
Class C: The devices that implement this class are 
able to receive data from the gateway at any time 
(except when the device is transmitting). It is 
suitable for nodes connected to the electricity grid. 
The prototype presented in this paper will employ class A 
devices. 
C. LoRaWAN Security 
LoRaWAN uses two security layers characterized by 
protecting data at the link layer as well as at the application 
layer. As for the application layer, data is encrypted between 
the node and the application server, which implies end-to-
end confidentiality. As for the link layer, a field (MIC), 
which allows guaranteeing data integrity between the node 
and the network server, is included. Figure 2 summarizes 
LoRaWAN security, which is explained below:

• 
Authentication: A shared key is known by the node 
and the network, and it is used by AES-CMAC 
algorithms which are employed when a node joins 
the network. Two keys named AppSKey and 
NwkSKey, which are used for the data encryption 
and data integrity, are derived from the previous key. 
• 
Integrity and confidentiality: The previous session 
keys are used for protecting all the traffic in a 
LoRaWAN network. Therefore, the NwkSKey is 
used for the end-to-end encryption between the node 
and the application server. Similarly, the AppSKey 
key is used to calculate a Message Integrity Code 
(MIC) in order to guarantee the integrity between the 
node and the network server. Finally, a sequence 
frame counter is included to prevent replay attacks. 
There are two activation methods for initiating the 
connection: Over the Air Activation (OTAA) and Activation 
By Personalization (ABP). OTAA uses the parameters 
JoinEUI (Application ID), DevEUI (Device ID), NwkKey 
and AppKey (end-nodes specific keys). The previous session 
keys are obtained from these parameters. On the other hand, 
using 
ABP, 
these 
parameters 
must 
be 
previously 
personalized in both the node and the servers. 
IV. 
LORAWAN NETWORK PROTOTYPE 
In this section, the implemented prototype is presented. 
This prototype will be used for the performance assessment 
in several scenarios. 
The first components of a LoRaWAN network are the 
end-nodes and the gateway. The components are shown in 
Figure 3 and are described below: 
• 
DIY multi-channel Raspberry Pi Gateway: the 
chosen gateway is composed of a Raspberry Pi 3 
Model B, an IMST ic880A concentrator with a 
maximum transmission power of 20 dBm and an 868 
MHz antenna with 2 dBi gain. 
• 
End-Device: the used end-device is based on the 
development board ’WeMos D1 Mini’, which uses 
the ESP8266 chip. A shield with the RN2483A chip 
(up to 14 dBm of TX power), which implements 
both the physical and the MAC layers of the 
LoRaWAN standard, is connected to the WeMos 
board. These are supplied by a external power bank. 
As shown in Figure 4, the gateway is connected to a 
network server by an Ethernet, WiFi or 3G/4G connection. 
The most popular LoRaWAN network infrastructure is 
called The Things Network [12]. This infrastructure is an 
open and collaborative LoRaWAN network. There are also 
other network infrastructures which allow creating a private 
environment, such as the LoRa Server [13]. The main 
characteristics of those servers are described below. 
A. The Things Network (TTN) 
TTN is a community which offers open source software 
projects to its users to make possible the connectivity 
between different elements in a LoRaWAN network. One of 
its main strengths is the capability of connecting any 
LoRaWAN gateway to its network servers, so no extra 
infrastructure is required. In addition, it allows the 
configuration and data gathering through a simple but 
complete graphical user interface. Even if TTN offers a 
simple and scalable solution for servers, they are still 
external and therefore data is shared with the organization. 
B. LoRa Server 
LoRa 
Server 
(LS) 
project 
provides 
open-source 
components for building LoRaWAN networks. It provides 
the necessary and MIT licensed software components. Those 
are depicted in Figure 4, which shows the architecture of this 
project. 
Packets are sent to the “LoRa Gateway Bridge”. This 
component could be installed both on the gateway and on the 
server environment, and it is in charge of the transformation 
of the packet-forwarder UDP protocol into messages over 
MQTT. The Broker will forward packets received by the 
Lora Gateway Server to the LoRa Server. This last 
component is in charge of the control and management of the 
network state as well as of the knowledge of active devices 
and their uplink/downlink frames.

Lastly, LS project provides an application server called 
LoRa App Server, which allows the configuration of users, 
devices and applications by a graphical user-friendly 
interface. It is also responsible for handling of join-request 
and the handling and encryption of application payloads. 
The main difference between both projects is the privacy. 
Using TTN you are able to create a collaborative network 
which allows you to use other gateways to reach your 
network and application server. However, if you are running 
a commercial solution and data is sensitive, you may create 
your own private solution with LoRa Server. 
Although TTN has been used for the deployment done in 
this article, we have deployed a private environment using 
Ubuntu 16.08 Xenial EC2 instances of Amazon Web 
Services. This server will be used for future works.

RESULTS 
This section shows the results of the network 
performance registered in our test bench. In order to evaluate 
the received signal strength by the nodes, an obstacle-free 
scenario and a coast rural scenario have been chosen. 
A. Highway Scenario 
The selected scenario is a road environment very similar 
to a highway (See Figure 5). It has three lanes in each side 
and also, pedestrian and bike lanes which lets us walk to take 
the measurements. Measurements have been taken while 
walking. The evaluated parameters have been the SNR, the 
RSSI, the packets loss ratio and the coverage of the end-
device. 
This road joins together the road named A-4006 on the 
north area of Granada with the street named Camino Nuevo 
at the entrance of Maracena. The route has approx. 3.3 km 
with 74 m of gradient. The gateway, whose location is in  
(37.2136373, -3.5951833) geographical point, is placed on a 
bridge which crosses the road as shown in Figure 5. It is 
almost a straight route without buildings or obstacles.  
 
Figure 5.  Gateway Placed. 
Figure 6 shows the results obtained as a function of the 
distance, taking the gateway as reference point. The X axis 
of Figure 6a and 6b represents the distance from the end-
device to the gateway. By performing an analysis of the 
results (Table II), it is possible to split them into four 
distance ranges. As shown, at 1000 m from the gateway, the 
average and maximum SNR values are 8.56 dB and 11 dB, 
respectively. In addition, Table II shows the 5 and 95 
percentiles of the SNR, showing e.g., that 95% of the 
measurements are above 5.53 dB. The SNR decreases as the 
distance from the gateway increases. At 2.5 km, we can 
observe negative SNR values, which indicate that the noise 
level is higher than the received signal. Despite this, LoRa 
modulation robustness lets the gateway receive the packets 
correctly up to 3.3 km (see Figure 6c). It should be pointed 
out that the urban area of Maracena starts at this point, so the 
presence of buildings significantly reduces the SNR and the 
level of the RSSI. 
Finally, Table II also shows the percentage of packet 
losses as a function of the distance to the gateway. As 
shown, the number of wrong packets received by the 
gateway increases as the distance to the gateway increases, 
being these losses more problematic for the last range (from 
3 to 3.3 km).

B. Coast Rural Scenario 
In this case, the gateway with coordinates (38.932457, -
0.099974) is placed on the terrace of a second floor house 
(~9m of height). The building is found at Oliva, a coast 
village of Valencia (Spain). The path followed and the 
coverage map is shown in Figure 7. The maximum measured 
distance is about 615 meters. As we can observe, this 
scenario has very different conditions. The scenario is 
composed by several small houses and the climate conditions 
are also different (higher humidity). 
Taking the position of the gateway as the reference point, 
the measurements show the SNR (see Figure 8a) and RSSI 
(see Figure 8b) values as a function of the distance. It is 
remarkable how those values decrease with respect to the 
highway scenario. This is due to the presence of different 
obstacles like houses and vegetation. Table III summarizes 
the performance results. These results can be split into three 
distance sections. First one ranges from the first 200 meters 
and it includes the urban core. Considering the height of the 
gateway, there is practically direct vision with the end-node. 
The average SNR is 5 dB and the highest value is 8.2 dB.  
According to the 5 percentile and Figure 8a, we observe 
that a 95% of the measurements are over 0.1 dB.

The rest has a negative SNR value due to the non-direct 
vision with the gateway. The second section ranges from 200 
to 400 meters. In this area, we find the beach (in front of the 
gateway), a nautical port (right) and houses with empty 
parcels (left). As we can see, SNR and RSSI values start to 
decrease because of the distance and the different nature of 
the environment. The average RSSI decreases by 20 dBm, 
which implies that the strength of the signal worsens 
considerably.  
Last 
section 
ranges 
from 
400 
to 
615 
meters 
approximately. The majority of those measurements are 
taken in the left area of the gateway. This part includes 
empty parcels so the measurements improve with respect to 
the total of measurements in the second area.

As shown in Table III, the average SNR is still positive 
and the 95% of the SNR measurements is over and above -
9.8 dB, two points lower than in the second area. Even so, 
the 95% of the RSSI measurements are two points better 
than in the previous section. Regarding the percentage of 
packet losses, the RSSI and SNR are more affected by the 
presence of buildings, reaching values of 57% for distances 
of 600 m.

CONCLUSIONS 
The aroused interest in LoRaWAN networks and the lack 
of practical experimental studies have generated the need of 
deploying these networks in several scenarios to get valuable 
information regarding aspects of maximum coverage and 
network performance. This article has presented the main 
characteristics of the LoRaWAN architecture and how these 
networks work, including as well, a real experimental study 
performed in two different scenarios. From the analysis of 
the results, we can conclude that a LoRa network based on 
our devices could be cover a distance higher than 3 km, in 
free-obstacle scenarios, since our gateway is still capable of 
receive packets correctly. Thus, LoRa networks would be an 
interesting solution for getting data in scenarios, such as 
crops or rural areas where we want to cover a very large 
area. As future work, we would like to test new networks and 
application servers which allow us to deploy completely 
private environments. The different power options will be 
also measured. Finally, we will perform real experiments in 
urban and indoor environments in order to compare the LoRa 
performance in several scenarios, such as agricultural 
holdings [14].
