Abstract—Web search engines are equipped with query expansion
facilities to reformulate a seed query and improve retrieval
performance. However, such techniques are usually used in
accordance with traditional Information Retrieval approaches,
which do not distinguish between creative and conventional uses
of languages, or between literal and non-literal meanings. But to
support a more creative search, with the ultimate objective of
being surprised or inspired by the results, non-literal relation-
ships between queries and the texts that they match should be
facilitated. This paper presents a query expansion method with a
lateral thinking approach, by suggesting, starting from a seed term
given by the user, a set of lists of terms representing conceptual
paths, each of which starts from the seed term. Each term in
the path is reached by traversing pre-identiﬁed relationships in
a given semantic network, while the selection of a speciﬁc term
is driven by the assessment of a distance metrics between terms.
The paper also presents a software implementation of the method,
which can be accessed as a mobile web app.

INTRODUCTION
Lateral thinking [1], the term was coined by the physician
Edward De Bono, is an attitude for addressing problems
through an indirect and creative approach. Lateral thinking
leverage reasoning that is not immediately obvious, involving
ideas that may not be obtainable by using only traditional
step-by-step logic. When we search for something, we are
used to follow traditional pattern-based approaches. But in
any patterning system, how argued by De Bono, there is
an absolute, and even logic, need for something like lateral
thinking, in order to yearn for something new that can further
trigger creative and innovative behaviors [2].
The most common engines for searching resources over
the Web evolved a lot. Currently, they do not just search
for resources that exactly match keywords representing users’
criteria. Indeed, most of them are equipped with query expan-
sion facilities [3], whose aim is to reformulate a seed query
to improve retrieval performance. Common query expansion
techniques involve: ﬁnding synonyms of words, ﬁnding all the
various morphological forms of words by stemming each word
in the search query; ﬁxing spelling errors and automatically
searching for the corrected form or suggesting it in the results;
weighting the terms in the original query.
In [4], a classiﬁcation of automated query expansion tech-
niques is presented. Such a classiﬁcation is organizaed into: (i)
linguistic analysis, which leverages global language properties
such as morphological, lexical, syntactic and semantic word
relationships; (ii) corpus-speciﬁc (global) techniques, which
analyze the contents of a full database to identify features used
in similar ways; (iii) query-speciﬁc (local) techniques, which
take advantage of the local context provided by the query;
(iv) search log analysis techniques, which are based on the
idea of mining query associations that have been implicitly
suggested by previous users; (v) web data techniques, which
are based on anchor texts that are often succinct descriptions
of the destination page and as such, can be very similar to
search queries. However, such techniques are usually used in
accordance with traditional information retrieval approaches,
which do not distinguish between creative and conventional
uses of languages, or between literal and non-literal meanings
[5]. But to support a more creative search, with the ultimate
objective of being surprised or inspired by the results, non-
literal relationships between queries and the texts that they
match should be exploited.
This paper presents a query expansion method enforcing a
lateral thinking approach, by suggesting, starting from a seed
term given by the user, a set of lists of terms representing
conceptual paths, each of which starts from the seed term.
Each term in the path is reached by traversing pre-identiﬁed
relationships in a given semantic network, while the selection
of a speciﬁc term is driven by the evaluation of a distance
metrics between terms.
The method does not stick to any speciﬁc implementation
constraint or to any speciﬁc knowledge resource needed for im-
plementing the method itself. However, the paper proposes an
implementation of the method based on the use of Wordnik[6]
as the knowledge base the conceptual paths belong to, and the
Lin similarity method [7], applied to WordNet[8], for evaluat-
ing the distance between terms. The described implementation
has been also released as a mobile web application named
LaSearch [9].
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
reports about some computational creativity works for query
expansion and engines for inspiring creativity. Section III
presents the proposed query expansion method. Section IV
describes the architecture of the query expansion engine and
its current implementation. Finally, Section V presents the
conclusions and future works.

RELATED WORKS
Considering the classiﬁcation elaborated in [4], and brieﬂy
presented in the Introduction, the proposed method belongs
to the family of linguistic analysis techniques, which are
typically based on the exploitation of dictionaries, thesauri, or
other similar knowledge representation sources. Some related
initiatives are here reported.
Concept creation is based on the ability to hypothesize and
create new concepts to suit a given situation [10]. [11] presents
a model of exploratory creativity that uses the WordNet on-
tology [12] as a basis for inducing the concepts that WordNet
appears to lack and which should be proﬁtably added.
Analogical expressions use terms from one domain of
discourse to allude to terms in another systematically parallel
domain of discourse. Analogy is thus useful when one knows
of, or suspects, the existence of a given concept but does not
know how it is lexicalized (e.g., the bible of Islam to mean the
Koran). [13] uses a lexical ontology like WordNet to resolve
analogies to be used for query expansion. [14] envisages a
creative process that can take any given target description and
using a pre-stored collection of domain descriptions, identiﬁes
potentially creative source domains with which to re-interpret
the given problem.
Concept combination is a family of conceptual mech-
anisms whereby a concept is used as a referential proxy
for another strongly associated one, e.g., lexical metaphors
or polysemy. For instance, metaphor is a highly-generative
conceptual phenomenon that can be used to create a wide
range of linguistic expressions that refer to the same concept
[15]. The metaphor process could be directly applied if we
wish to retrieve documents that allude to a search concept
ﬁguratively rather than literally, in order to expand the search
query with plausible ﬁgurative lexicalizations of this concept.
With this respect, [16] introduces a computational model based
on creative metaphors to address non-literal meanings of terms
in information retrieval systems.
Bisociation [17] seeks to combine elements from two or
more incompatible concepts or domains to generate creative
solutions and insight. [18] provides a formal deﬁnition of
bisociation in order to facilitate bisociation by connecting the
knowledge bases of an intelligent agent in the context of a
concrete problem, situation or event.
Finally, recent proposals of inspiration and creative search
engines are worth mentioning. Seenapse[19] is an inspiration
engine that helps people to come up with creative ideas, by
allowing users to browse mental associations made by people
all over the world, in order to expand their own possibility of
having a Eureka moment. YossarianLives[20] is a metaphor-
ical search engine, designed to spark creativity by returning
disparate but conceptually related terms. ELISE (Evolutionary
Learning Interactive Search Engine) aims to decrease search
results precision in order to keep some diversity in the retrieved
documents. ELISE is based on the cost-efﬁcient Parisian
approach and interactive evolutionary algorithms to specialise
existing search engines with evolved user proﬁles [21].
III.
OVERALL APPROACH
The proposed method is based on the exploitation of a
semantic network aiming at suggesting a set of query expan-
sions in the form of paths of terms all starting from a seed
term speciﬁed by the user as the initial search criterion. A
conceptual path is a list of terms that belong to the semantic
network and that can be reached by traversing a given rela-
tionship in the semantic network itself, starting from the seed
term. The length of the path, which depends on the number of
iterations of the algorithm at the core of the proposed method,
is decided by the user, while the method deﬁnes the criteria
for traversing the semantic network and applied to build the
conceptual paths.
At each iteration, the method ﬁrst identiﬁes the most
”promising” current paths to expand, and then, for each of
them, builds all the possible expansions. For each path, all
the terms that in the semantic network can be reached from
the tail of the path (the tail of a path is the last term added
to the path), by traversing a given relationship, are used to
generate the same number of expansions. Speciﬁcally, if the
tail of a path is related to n terms, not yet belonging to that
path, n expansions of the path will be produced where only one
term will contribute to each path. The most ”promising” paths
are identiﬁed by ranking the tails of the paths with respect to
the deﬁned expansion divergence function, which is computed
by applying a distance metrics between terms. In particular,
the expansion divergence function, which represents the lateral
thinking component, privileges those terms that are closer to
the mean distance of all the possible candidates with respect to
both its generator (i.e., its preceding term in the path) and the
seed term. The mean distances are taken as references, because
the method wants to add a new term to a path by expressing
a lateral thinking attitude in a ”prudent” way, that is, avoiding
that the distances of an added term from both its generator
and the seed term increase too much and too fast (i.e., in very
few iterations). In addition, the method requires that a term
can be added to a path if its distance from the seed term is
higher than the distance from its generator term (Expansion
Constraint).
As a convention, in the rest of the paper, any lower case
letter represents a term, and in particular, t represents the seed
term. The description of the algorithm is supported by the
following deﬁnitions.
A. Deﬁnitions
Deﬁnition 1 (Relatedness): the Relatedness relationship rel
between terms is a linguistic or semantic relation in a given
semantic network SN, i.e., (x, y) ∈ rel if y is directly linked
to x in SN.
Deﬁnition 2 (Conceptual Path): A conceptual path (cp)
starting from the seed term t1, and having lenght equal to
n, is a list of n terms belonging to SN that can be reached,
starting from t1, by traversing the Relatedness relationship.
cp = [t1, t2, ..., tn],
where ∀ tk (tk, tk+1) ∈ rel, k = 1...n − 1.
(1)
Deﬁnition 3 (Possible Expansion): the Possible Expansion
PExp(x) of a generic term x is the set of terms y, such that
(x, y) ∈ rel, where y ̸= x and y ̸= t.
PExp(x) = {y|(x, y) ∈ rel, y} ̸= xandy ̸= t.
(2)
Deﬁnition 4 (Term Distance): the Term Distance dist(x, y)
between the terms x and y, is the distance between x and y, in
38

accordance with a given metrics (e.g, a linguistic or semantic
distance metrics).
Deﬁnition
5
(Mean
Distance):
the
Mean
Distance
md(PExp(x), y) of the terms in PExp(x) with respect to a given
term y, is the arithmetic mean of the Terms Distance between
each term w in PExp(x) and y.
md(PExp(x), y) =
X
w∈P Exp(x)
dist(w, y)
|PExp(x)|
(3)
Deﬁnition 6 (Local Mean Divergence): the Local Mean
Divergence lmd(y, x) of a term y in PExp(x) is the absolute
value of the difference between the Mean Distance between
PExp(x) and x, and the Terms Distance between x and y.
lmd(y, x) = |md(PExp(x), x) − dist(x, y)|,
where y ∈ PExp(x)
(4)
Deﬁnition 7 (Absolute Mean Divergence): the Absolute
Mean Divergence amd(y, x) of a term y in PExp(x) is the
absolute value of the difference between the Mean Distance
between PExp(x) and t, and the Terms Distance between y
and t.
amd(y, x) = |md(PExp(x), t) − dist(y, t)|,
where y ∈ PExp(x)
(5)
Deﬁnition 8 (Expansion Divergence): the Expansion Di-
vergence div(y, x) of a term y in PExp(x) is the sum of the
Local Mean Divergence of y in PExp(x) and the Absolute Mean
Divergence of y in PExp(x).
div(y, x) = lmd(y, x) + amd(y, x)
(6)
Deﬁnition 9 (Suggested Paths): the Suggested Paths
SPaths(t, h, maxexp) of the term t in h iterations (hops) is the
set of conceptual paths, all having t as the head, having length
equals to h+1, and resulting by h iterations of the algorithm
in Figure 1, in which, at most maxexp terms are expanded at
each iteration.
Deﬁnition 10 (Expansion Constraint): Given a conceptual
path cp = [t, t1, ..., th] belonging to SPaths(t, h, maxexp), and
any two adjacent concepts tkandtk+1 in cp, the Term Distance
between the seed term t and tk+1, must be greater than the
Term Distance between t and tk.
dist(t, tk+1) > dist(t, tk),
where tk and tk+1 ∈ cp = [t, t1, ..., th],
cp ∈ SPaths(t, h, maxexp), k = 1, ..., h − 1.
(7)
The rationale behind the Expansion Constraint is to enforce
the following two principles:
•
laterality, that is achieving an incremental growth of
the lateral thinking attitude in the expansion of the
seed term at each iteration (hop);
•
reliability, that is guaranteeing that whenever a bound-
ary term (i.e., a term presenting the maximum distance
value with respect to the seed) is considered in a given
hop, it will not be expanded in the subsequent hop;
intuitively, a boundary term saturates the admissible
lateral thinking attitude, and thus, the ﬁtness of the
terms belonging to its possible expansions cannot be
properly characterized.

Figure 2 elaborates about SPaths(t, 2, 2), that means to search
for conceptual paths of length 3 (applying two iterations of
the algorithm in Figure 1), by expanding at most two terms at
each iteration.

At the ﬁrst iteration, the algorithm ﬁnds that PExp(t) = {x,
y, z, w}. Consequently, it builds the following set of paths {[t,
x], [t, y], [t, z], [t, w]}, and then orders these paths with respect
to the Expansion Divergence of their tails.
At the second and last iteration, the algorithm has to select
the most promising two current paths to expand, on the basis
of the Expansion Divergence value of their tails, which are
shown in Table I. According to such values, the paths [t, y]
and [t, x] are further expanded. Then, the Possible Expansions
of y and x, that are PExp(y) and PExp(x), respectively, are
computed, and corresponding paths are built.
PExp(y) = {y1, y2, y3, y4, y5}, but y4 does not satisfy the
Expansion Constraint, since dist(y4, t) < dist(y, t), as can be
seen by considering Table I and Table II. At the same time,
PExp(x) = {x1, x2, x3, x4}, but x2 and x3 do not satisfy the
Expansion Constraint since dist(x2, t) < dist(x, t) and dist(x3,
t) < dist(x, t), as can be seen by considering Table I and
Table III.
Table IV summarizes by ordering terms in PExp(y) and
PExp(x) with respect to their Expansion Divergence values,
plus the information regarding the respect of the Expansion
Constraint. According to that, the ﬁnal Suggested Pahs are
provided, such that SPaths(t, 2, 2) = {[t, y, y1], [t, y, y5], [t,
y, y3], [t, x, x4], [t, x, x1], [t, y, y2]}.

IMPLEMENTATION
In this Section, we introduce the prototypical implemen-
tation of the approach presented in the previous section for
expanding search queries. For the realization of the algorithm,
we adopted: (i) the open linguistic knowledge base Wordnik,
as semantic network for computing the possible expansions
of terms, and (ii) the Lin metrics [7], computed by exploiting
the hyponym hierarchy of the WordNet lexical database, as
linguistic similarity criteria. According to these choices, which
rely on agreed and robust solutions for natural language
processing, we have:
•
the Relatedness relation rel is represented by the Same
Context relation in the Wordnik thesaurus, which links
terms that might be used in a similar context;
•
the Term Distance is computed as the complement of
the Lin similarity value, i.e.:
dist(x, y) = 1 − sim(x, y), where 0 ≤ sim(x, y) ≤ 1
is computed according to the Lin similarity.
In Table V, we show some examples of expansion of
the seed term “innovation”, obtained according to the current

implementation. Each row of the table reports the ﬁve best re-
sults computed by performing #hop iterations of the algorithm,
hence achieving paths of different lengths. In the experiment,
the constant maxexp has been ﬁxed to 10, in order to bound
the computational cost of the algorithm. The ranking is then
computed according to the least Expansion Divergence (see
Deﬁnition 7).
A. LaSearch Architecture
The developed LaSearch tool (Lateral Search) is a Web-
based application, developed in Java, whose main components
are depicted in Figure 3. The client side has been designed
as a mobile application, which interacts with a REST Web
Server exposing (i) the query expansion procedure (Section
III), implemented in the Query Builder, and (ii) methods for
gathering data from external repositories or search engines,
implemented in the Data Source Library.
The core component is the Expander, which implements
the suggested expansion procedure, as deﬁned in the algorithm
in Figure 1, relying on: (i) the Thesauri Manager, which
computes at each hop the possible expansion of the given
terms according to the integrated thesauri, e.g., Wordnik is
currently supported; (ii) the Ranker, which is responsible for
assessing the expansion divergence of the terms at each hop;
(iii) the Similarity Reasoner, for computing the linguistic term
distance. The latter, in turn, depends on the NLP module, based
on WordNet and the Semantic Measures Library (SML)[22],
which provides the implementation of the Lin similarity met-
rics.
Finally, at the current status of the implementation we
integrated in the Data Source Library three connectors for

extracting: (i) hashtags from Twitter, through the Rite-
Tag API[23]; (ii) images from Flickr, through the exposed
APIs[24]; (iii) quotations from ThinkExists, by using the
boilerpipe library[25].
B. Mobile Application
The client side of the current prototype (upper part of
Figure 3) is implemented as a mobile application, runnable
on Android devices. It allows the user to input a term to be
expanded, specifying the length of the conceptual path, i.e.,
the number of hops to be executed by the algorithm (Figure
4.a). The results of the expansion can be browsed (Figure 4.b),
in order to select the terms to be used as search request by the
Query Executor. The latter invokes the Data Source Library,
which in turn retrieves data from a set of external repositories
through the connectors implemented on the server side. In
particular, we focused on three categories of data considered of
particular interest in this context, namely, quotations, images,
and user-generated contents on social media platforms.
The results collected by the Query Executor are then
aggregated and presented to the user by speciﬁc browsers that
allow the user to navigate the results. As an example, Figure
4.c shows popular Twitter hashtags related to the keyword risk,
while Figure 4.d shows images retrieved on Flickr using the
keyword adventure.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS
In this paper, we presented a method for the expansion
of search queries, based on the use of a semantics-enabled
approach, tailored at enforcing lateral thinking mechanisms in
order to achieve more creative, inspiring and evocative results.
Our initial results have been implemented in a tool, LaSearch,
that allows the users to expand a seed term, obtaining concep-
tual paths whose terms are reached by traversing pre-identiﬁed
relationships in a given thesaurus and evaluating linguistic
distance metrics. Query expansions are then used to gather
results from external sources, such as images and quotation
repositories, or social media.
Figure 4. Screenshots of the user interface
The preliminary results presented in this paper open up
several directions for future research. First of all, we plan
to push forward the empirical evaluation of our proposal,
to assess the quality of the results as perceived by human
users. For what concerns the performance point of view,
ﬁrst experiments are encouraging and show that during the
interactive usage of the tool, expansion and search tasks can
be performed in an acceptable amount of time and memory
resources.
Secondly, since the method is sensitive to the used se-
mantic network and the relationship(s) in it (in the current
implementation we used Wordnik as the semantic network,
and ”same context” as the relationship), we plan to test
additional knowledge sources (e.g., dbpedia [26], ConceptNet
[27]), and relationships in them, as well as to consider, in
the identiﬁcation of terms in a path, criteria depending on the
domain of corresponding concepts, in order to select terms
from different contexts, which would be much related to lateral
thinking. Furthermore, another initiative could be to integrate
heterogeneous creativity-based approaches (e.g., analogies,
metaphors [28]) for suggesting terms to the conceptual paths.
Finally, the most challenging initiative is go towards a
formal deﬁnition of lateral attitude, introducing a computable
metrics in order to be able to assess its increment at each

iteration of the method. Many expansion results shown in
Table V, such as [innovation, research, education], [innova-
tion, investment, risk] or [innovation, achievement, enterprise,
ambition], are signiﬁcant examples of the kind of expansion
we want to achieve. Indeed, while the terms in the paths in-
crementally diverge from the seed from a semantic perspective
and, intuitively, increase their ’laterality’, at the same time they
maintain a ﬁgurative connection with it. However, translating
this intuition into a structured method still remains an open
issue. One could argue that precise calculation rules prevent
creativity, while introducing random and chaotic behaviors
could foster lateral thinking. So, is it ﬁnally sufﬁcient to be
crazy, free and nonjudgmental to be more creative [29]? We
guess that it is not as simple as that.
