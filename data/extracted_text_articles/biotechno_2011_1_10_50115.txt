Abstract - Stress Urinary Incontinence is a common 
form of women urinary incontinence and has some 
surgical therapeutic methods. The quality of surgery 
merely depends on the quality of diagnosis. Before 
deciding a surgery type, urodynamic testing is applied. 
Since urodynamic testing is invasive, and difficult to 
apply, many subjects do not seek therapy. A non-
invasive method can encourage more subjects for 
searching a remedy. At this point, Doppler ultrasound 
can be a good choice. In this study, we have 
demonstrated that the blood flow characteristics of 
healthy subjects and intrinsic sphincter deficiency type 
stress urinary incontinence subjects have different 
characteristics and can be classified by using Doppler 
ultrasound recording.

I. INTRODUCTION 
 
Urinary Incontinence (UI) is a common disorder 
[1]. It negatively affects the lifestyle of women, 
although it is not fatal [2]. 
 
UI has four basic types; namely Stress Urinary 
Incontinence (SUI), Urge Incontinence, mixed 
incontinence, and overflow incontinence. Each of 
them has different grounds and needs a different 
method of handling. SUI is described as the 
involuntary leakage of urine under stress conditions 
like coughing, sneezing, laughing. For only SUI, 
there are some therapeutic surgeries [3].   
 
The International Consultation on Incontinence 
(ICI) set a series of guidelines for the diagnosis of 
urinary incontinence [4]. The first step is taking the 
history of the patient followed by physical 
examination [5]. For SUI suspected cases, the stress 
test is applied. In this procedure, the patient who is 
under the stress condition is examined whether there 
is any leakage or not. 
 
If surgery is needed, urodynamic methods are 
involved to decide the appropriate surgical method. 
Pressure 
profiles, 
water-filling 
cystometry, 
electrophysiological 
studies, 
Postvoid 
Residual 
(PVR) measurement, urodynamic testing, cystogram 
are some examples of diagnostic methods. These 
methods very helpful but they are invasive.  
 
Invasive methods like urodynamic methods are 
more successful but less comfortable for patients. 
Therefore, a new method that is non-invasive will 
encourage subjects who are suffering from SUI is a 
necessity. In this point ultrasonography can be an 
alternative method because of its noninvasive nature. 
Perineal ultrasound is applied in some studies [6] [7] 
[8]. In these studies, some parameters of blood flow 
dynamics and some angles, orientations and distances 
on ultrasound image are used. Unfortunately, these 
methods have low accuracy.   
 
In urodynamic testing, Abdominal Leak Point 
Pressure (ALPP) is measured for deciding a surgery 
type. If it is less than 60 cmH2O, then it is called 
Intrinsic Sphincter Deficiency (ISD). If ALPP is 
greater than 90 cmH2O, it is named as Urethral 
Hyper Mobility (UHM). The ones who have ALPP 
value between 60 and 90 mH2O are called as mid -
type.  ALPP is also high for continent subjects.  
 
Since the ground of SUI is the physical changes in 
the anatomy of the pelvic system, it is natural to 
expect some changes in the blood flow characteristics 
of SUI subjects. In our previous study, power 
spectral density of healthy subjects and SUI subjects

are used for classification [9]. In this study, it is 
aimed to differentiate healthy subjects and ISD type 
SUI subjects by analyzing Doppler ultrasound 
records. Nonlinear analysis was successfully applied 
for Doppler signals in some studies [10]. 
 
In this study, Empirical Mode Decomposition 
(EMD) is used to estimate Intrinsic Mode Functions 
(IMF) first, and then Singular Spectral Analysis 
(SSA) of each IMF is calculated. Features extracted 
from SSA result are used for classification of healthy 
subjects and ISD subjects. 
 
This article is prepared as follows. In section II, 
materials used in this study and the methods for 
classification of healthy subjects and ISD subjects 
are given. The results of the study are given in 
section III. In section IV, the discussion and 
conclusion of the study are given. 
 
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS   
 
A.  Subjects 
 
Doppler ultrasound signals were recorded from 
GE Logiq 9 Doppler Ultrasound Unit in the 
Radiology Department of Haseki Training and 
Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey. Output of 
Doppler Ultrasound unit was connected to an 
Olympus LS-10 Digital Voice Recorder, thatstores 
data in (.wav) format. Recorded signals then 
transferred to a Laptop where the signal processing 
and classification processes were performed. The 
MATLAB® program is used at the signal processing 
and the classification steps. The study was approved 
by the ethic committee of Haseki Training and 
Research Hospital, and informed consent was given 
by the participating subjects. 
 
A perineal ultrasound probe (7.5 MHz) was used 
to transmit pulsed Doppler ultrasound signals to the 
urethral artery. The reflected signals were recorded 
by the digital sound recorder. These signals give 
Doppler shift frequencies for healthy and ISD 
subjects. During recording, the insonation angle and 
the presetting of the ultrasound were kept constant. 
This angle was tuned via electronic steering methods 
to keep at 45° on a longitudinal view and the 
sampling volume was placed within the center of the 
artery. The audio output of the Doppler ultrasound 
was recorded at 44100 Hz, 16 bits, in a stereo 
channel format. The graphical illustration of data 
recording scheme is given in Figure 1.  
 
Urethral arterial signals were recorded from 16 
ISD patients and 18 healthy volunteers. Patients were 
clinically tested and proved to be ISD by urodynamic 
testing. SUI subjects are between 37 and 56 years old 
(average is 49). Control group was formed from 
young volunteers whose age is between 38 and 55, 
with an average of 46.

B. Data Analysis  
B.1. Empirical Mode Decomposition 
 
The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) was 
proposed by Huang et al., [11]. It is a numerical 
model to decompose the signal into a finite number 
of IMF.  The IMF function must satisfy two 
conditions: 
 
(a) The number of the zero crossings and the 
number of extreme must be either equal or differ 
by one. 
 
(b) The mean value of the local minima and 
maxima envelope of the function must be zero. 
 
Once the first IMF is obtained, the restingportion 
can also include more IMFs. The remaining data can 
be further decomposed successively to get other 
IMFs by utilizing EMD. 
 
In the representation of signals in IMF forms, the 
lower order IMFs hold fast oscillating components. 
Similarly, higher order IMFs represent slow 
oscillations.  
 
B.2. Singular Spectrum Analysis 
 
Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) is a power 
time series analysis technique.  It is a nonparametric 
spectral estimation method that is based on 
embedding a time series X(t):t=1..N in a vector space 
having M dimension. Here, the time series assumed 
to be stationary.  
 
 SSA is suitable for extracting meaningful 
information from noisy time series. For the 
assumption of being stationary, the time series must

have a short duration. It performs an eigen 
decomposition of the lagged covariance matrix, that 
is constructed from the time series. 
 
SSA approach is an effective tool for nonlinear 
analysis and has an important advantage over other 
time series analysis techniques; it does not need any 
priory information.   
 
III. RESULTS 
The classification features are extracted from 
SSA calculation of IMFs. First three IMF of Doppler 
ultrasound signals recorded from healthy subjects 
and ISD subjects are extracted, firstly. Then SSA is 
applied for each IMF and covariance matrix (M=10) 
is calculated. From the covariance matrix, Eigen 
values are calculated.  
In Figure 2, EMD view of one subject is given. 
The top three are the first, second, and third IMFs of 
Doppler ultrasound record of the subject. The last 
plot is the residue of EMD.  
In Table 1, the data used for classifications of 
healthy subjects and ISD subjects. In this study, 16 
ISD subjects and 18 healthy (continent) subjects are 
used. Healthy subjects are called as CONT. 
The classification parameters (features) are given 
at the second and third columns of Table 1. The 
explanation of the classification parameters extracted 
from SSA of IMFs.

Where 
AreaRatio1 and AreaRatio2 are classification 
features. Here Area1 is the sum of Eigen values for 
IMF1. Similarly, Area2 and Area3 are the sum of 
Eigen values for IMF2 and IMF3, respectively. 
In the Figure 3, scatter plot of classification 
parameters is given. The difference between two 
classes is seen clearly in this illustration. When 
considering the class centers, these classes are 
separated definitely. There are some members of ISD 
and CONT classes very close to each other, so the 
separation is difficult by pattern recognition 
techniques.

In the first step, signal is divided into IMFs by 
using empirical mode decomposition. Then Singular 
Spectrum Analysis (SSA) is applied to each IMF. 
Then the area ratios of SSA of IMFs are calculated as 
the feature for classification.  
 
When the scatter plot of classification parameters 
given in Figure 3 is analyzed, AreaRatio2 values of 
ISD subjects are generally higher than that of healthy 
subjects. It means that the ratio between IMF2 and 
IMF3 of ISD subjects shows the greater difference 
when compared with healthy subjects. This is 
actually theoretically expected. In ISD subjects, since 
the sphincter muscles loose their contractility, the 
blood flow of the urethral artery should be more 
laminar than healthy subjects. In this type flow, the 
Eigen values should be concentrated in a few IMFs. 
In other words, the area ratios of more laminar flows 
are higher than more complex flows. This is proven 
in this study. 
 
SUI is the result of physical deformation on the 
continence supporting system. It is natural to expect 
some changes in the blood flow dynamics of urethral 
artery that feeds the pelvic region. In this study, we 
have demonstrated that healthy subjects and ISD type 
SUI subjects can be classified by using Doppler 
ultrasound records of subjects. 
 
The noninvasive nature of Doppler ultrasound 
makes it a suitable candidate for diagnosis of SUI. 
The gold standard method used in diagnosis of the 
disorder is invasive urodynamic testing that prevents 
many subjects from seeking a remedy. Method 
proposed in this study can be a good alternative for 
urodynamic testing.  
 
In future studies, the discrimination of subtypes of 
SUI subjects (UHM or ISD types) will be tried by 
using Doppler ultrasound records of urethral artery.
