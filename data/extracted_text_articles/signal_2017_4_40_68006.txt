Abstract—This paper proposes two strategies for retransmission
control of backlog trafﬁc in the family of algorithms known
as Network Diversity Multiple Access (NDMA). This type of
algorithm has been shown to achieve (in ideal conditions) the
following aspects: 1) collision-free performance for contention-
based trafﬁc, 2) low latency values, and 3) reduced feedback
complexity. These features match the machine-type trafﬁc, real-
time, and dense object connectivity requirements in 5G. This
makes NDMA a candidate for contention trafﬁc support in 5G
systems. However, existing analysis ignores the effects of backlog
trafﬁc generated by the imperfect detection conditions that arise
in settings with ﬁnite Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). This paper
aims to partially ﬁll this gap, by providing analytic expressions for
the performance of symmetrical training-based NDMA protocols
with two different types of backlog trafﬁc retransmission schemes.
In the ﬁrst strategy, all terminals involved in an unsuccessful reso-
lution period retransmit immediately in the subsequent resolution
periods or epoch slots. This procedure is repeated continuously
(persistent retransmission) by inducing the same collision event
under different channel outcomes until all the contending signals
are correctly detected and received. In the second retransmission
strategy, the terminals in backlog state retransmit at a randomly
selected time-slot with a probability that that is assumed (for
simplicity) to match the transmission rate of the system. In
both strategies, expressions are here obtained of the maximum
stable throughput and the average delay experienced by any
packet to be correctly received by the destination. This allows
us to determine the capabilities of NDMA for achieving low-
latency, reduced feedback complexity, as well as highly stable
and real-time throughout performance. The results shown here
suggest that NDMA can achieve attractive low latency and high
throughput ﬁgures mainly at high SNR values and moderate
trafﬁc loads.

INTRODUCTION
Some of the main requirements in future 5G systems are
the following: 1) low latency for real-time and machine-type
communications, 2) increased spectral efﬁciency and through-
put performance for broadband high speed and industrial
applications, and 3) reduced signalling load and feedback
complexity to cope with the large number of objects and
terminals that will be competing for access to network re-
sources. Network Diversity Multiple Access or NDMA is the
family of signal-processing-based random access algorithms
originally proposed in [1] that represent a good candidate
to achieve the main goals of contention-based access in 5G
networks. In NDMA, adaptive retransmissions are used to
resolve collisions of variable size. For example, if a collision of
K terminals occurs, then the system attempts to induce enough
diversity via retransmissions to create K or more degrees of
freedom. These degrees of freedom or sources of diversity
will allow the system to recover the signals of the colliding
terminals via multi-user detection tools. NDMA is the perfect
example of cross-layer interactions: PHY (PHYsical) layer
diversity is created explicitly by retransmissions induced by
MAC (Medium Access Control) layer processes.
Training-based NDMA protocols have been proposed in
[1] and [2] for non-dispersive and dispersive channels, respec-
tively. Blind versions based on rotational invariance techniques
and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) were proposed
in [3] and [4], respectively. More recently, a combination
of NDMA, Multi-Packet Reception (MPR) and Successive
Interference Cancellation (SIC) was shown in [7] to potentially
break the barrier of M packets per time-slot, where M is the
number of antennas at the receiver. This is the highest through-
put potentially found in random access theory. Performance of
NDMA combined with Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) has
been investigated in [8]. NDMA is expected to be an attractive
solution for future 5G systems, mainly because it achieves (in
ideal conditions) an almost collision-free throughput perfor-
mance with low values of latency or access delay and reduced
signalling feedback complexity.
There are several open issues that need to be solved in the
design of NDMA systems, particularly related to stability. Sta-
bility of asymmetrical NDMA systems under perfect detection
and reception conditions using the Foster-Lyapunov criterion
and the Loynes’ theorem were presented in [5]. Stability of
symmetrical NDMA protocols with ﬁnite SNR using a Markov
model for backlog states of the system was presented in [6].
Stability is loosely deﬁned here as the ability of a network
to deal with the trafﬁc requests of all the terminals within
a ﬁnite period of time. Stability is often more important but
also more difﬁcult to investigate than throughput or delay.
Exact stability boundaries of NDMA in the case of imperfect
collision multiplicity estimation have not yet been obtained in
the literature.
This paper attempts to partially ﬁll this gap, by obtaining
more accurate predictions of the stable throughput of conven-
tional NDMA systems considering backlog trafﬁc with two
different types of retransmission strategy. In the ﬁrst strategy,
also called persistent retransmission strategy, the backlogged
terminals immediately engage in a new resolution period in
an attempt to correctly decode the colliding packets. This
procedure is repeated until the conﬂict has been successfully
resolved. In the second retransmission strategy, backlogged ter-
minals retransmit randomly in future time slots assuming, for

convenience, a retransmission probability that exactly matches
the transmission rate of the system. For both cases, the stability
condition is evaluated by means of a balance trafﬁc equation
which is the result of a particular application of Loynes’
theorem of stability in queuing systems. Delay is evaluated
by means of the M/G/1 queue analytical framework, which is
commonly used in the literature of NDMA to estimate average
delay. The results show that NDMA is capable to surpass by a
signiﬁcant margin its ALOHA counterparts, and when the SNR
is high enough and with moderate trafﬁc loads, low latency
values and high throughput performance could be attractive
for future 5G networks.
The organisation of this paper is as follows. Section II
presents the system assumptions and deﬁnitions. Section III
presents the details of the ﬁrst retransmission strategy (also
called here persistent retransmission strategy) where back-
logged terminals continuously retransmit information until the
BS correctly resolves the collision. Section IV details the
random retransmission strategy. Results of the retransmission
schemes are displayed and discussed in Section V. The con-
clusions of the paper are then presented in Section VI.

SYSTEM MODEL AND ASSUMPTIONS
This section deals with the system model and the assump-
tions used throughout the paper. The subsections are organised
as follows: Subsection II-A describes the scenario and the steps
of the original NDMA protocol. Subsection II-B describes
the backlog retransmission strategies. Subsection II-C deﬁnes
the types of collision resolution periods or epoch-slots, and
ﬁnally Subsection II-D provides illustrative examples of the
two proposed retransmission strategies.
A. Scenario description and NDMA protocol operation
Consider the wireless random access network depicted in
Figure 1 with one base station (BS) and J terminals. All
network elements have only one antenna. Each terminal is
assumed to have a buffer experiencing a packet arrival process
with Poisson statistics described by the parameter λ. The
transmission probability of any terminal at the beginning of any
resolution period is denoted by p. All channels are considered
non-dispersive, ﬂat and block fading with Rayleigh statistics.
Whenever the terminals are allowed to transmit a packet,
they do so at the beginning of a new collision resolution
period or epoch-slot. At the beginning of every epoch slot,
the BS proceeds to obtain an estimate of the identity of
the contending terminals by means of signal processing tools
(details can be found in [1]). Each terminal uses as packet
header a unique orthogonal code previously assigned. The BS
exploits this header using a matched ﬁlter receiver and energy
detection processing to estimate the presence of each terminal
in the collision event. Since this process is prone to errors due
to fading and noise, the probability of detection conditional
on the terminal having transmitted a packet in the current
time-slot is given by PD (probability of correct presence
detection). On the other hand, the probability of presence
detection conditional on the terminal not having engaged in
transmission is given by PF or probability of false alarm.
In Rayleigh fading channels, it has been shown in [1] that
the Receiver Operational Characteristic (ROC) of the terminal
presence detector is given by PD = P

, where γ is the
average post-detection Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).

Scheme 1 is also called persistent retransmission scheme. Scheme 2 is also
called random retransmission scheme
The detection of the presence of the different active
terminals provides the BS with an estimation of the colli-
sion size. Based on this information, the BS proceeds to
request retransmissions from the contending terminals so as
to construct a virtual Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO)
system with the convenient rank conditions that will ensure
that the collision can be resolved via multi-user detection.
B. Backlog retransmission schemes
In NDMA, it is conventionally assumed that any detection
error at the BS side yields the loss of all packets involved
in the collision. Conversely, the collision is successfully re-
solved only when all the terminals are correctly detected (both
active and idle terminals). This paper proposes two backlog
retransmission schemes to deal with the packets that were
involved in an unsuccessful resolution period or epoch-slot.
The ﬁrst scheme (also called persistent) allows the contending
terminals to engage immediately in a new resolution period.
The BS indicates to the terminals that the previous resolution
process did not succeed, and therefore the same contending
terminals are induced to collide again at the beginning of
the new resolution period. This procedure is repeated until
all the packets involved in the collision are correctly decoded
by the destination. In the second retransmission strategy, the
backlogged terminal retransmits randomly in a future epoch
slot with probability p, which is exactly the same probability
as the overall system attempt rate. This scheme is also called
random retransmission scheme.
C. Epoch-slot deﬁnition and feedback model
The collision multiplicity at the beginning of any epoch
slot will be denoted by the random variable K. The length

of a simple collision resolution period will be denoted by the
random variable l. The period of time used for a packet to
be correctly decoded by the destination will be denoted by L,
and it will also be called super-epoch. Two types of epoch and
super-epoch are further deﬁned: relevant, where a particular
terminal under analysis is always present, and irrelevant, where
such incumbent terminal is idle.
The BS has two feedback ﬂags that are considered to
be ideal and instantaneous. One ﬂag is used to indicate to
the colliding terminals that retransmission is needed in the
next time slot for purposes of diversity. The second feedback
ﬂag occurs at the end of a collision resolution period and
indicates whether the epoch was successful or not. Based on
this information, the colliding terminals decide to enter in one
of the backlog retransmission schemes presented in this paper.
D. Examples
To further illustrate the proposed algorithms, Figure 1
shows the realization of the two retransmission strategies
over 4 epoch-slots. In the ﬁrst epoch (e = 1) of scheme
1, three terminals collide at the beginning of the epoch slot
({1,3,8}). However, only two of them were detected correctly
as active ({3,8}). The system has requested only one more
retransmission when indeed it was necessary to collect two
more retransmissions to resolve the collision. This means
this epoch e = 1 is unsuccessful. The terminals are now in
backlog state and retransmit immediately in the next resolution
period. Once again, the detection process was incorrect, by
miss-detecting two of the contending terminals ({3,8}) and
estimating one of the idle terminals ({5}) as active (false
alarm). The backlogged terminals proceed then to retransmit
again in a third consecutive epoch slot (e = 3). This time
all terminals were correctly detected and the collision is
conveniently resolved. The fourth epoch (e = 4) allows new
terminals to transmit, and it can be observed that this case
was a successful epoch. Note that the ﬁrst collision took three
epoch slots to be correctly resolved with total length of L = 7.
This set of epoch slots that a collision experiences to be
resolved is called super epoch.
In the second retransmission strategy, the three contending
terminals involved in the ﬁrst resolution period ({1,3,8})
become backlogged. However, they start retransmission ran-
domly over the next epoch slots. In the second epoch slot,
terminal j = 1 retransmits the backlogged packet and this
time the resolution is successful. By contrast, the third epoch
sees terminal j = 3 to experience again an incorrect detection
with one case of false alarm. The last epoch shows that two
non-backlogged terminals experience a successful collision
resolution. Note that the super-epoch for terminal j = 1 is
given by the ﬁrst and second resolution periods with a total
length of L = 4.
III.
PERSISTENT RETRANSMISSION STRATEGY
In the ﬁrst retransmission strategy, all the terminals in-
volved in an incorrect resolution period are forced to retransmit
immediately in the next resolution period(s). This process is
repeated until the collision is correctly resolved. The steps of
the persistent retransmission strategy are described in Algo-
rithm 1. Stability will be investigated here by using a modiﬁed
trafﬁc balance equation. This equation has been used before
in [5] for stability analysis of NDMA. The expression states
the balance between the incoming and outgoing trafﬁc in the
NDMA system. It is a modiﬁcation of the Loynes’ theorem
of stability in queuing systems, and it can be written, in our
context, as follows:
p = λE[L],
(1)
which states the balance between the transmission attempt rate
p and the incoming trafﬁc rate per super-epoch-slot. In con-
ventional NDMA, correct resolution occurs when all terminals
are correctly detected. This occurs when all K contending
terminals have been correctly detected with probability P K
D
and all J − K idle terminals are not incorrectly detected as
active with probability ¯P J−K
F
, where ¯PF = 1 − PF .
Consider now a collision of K out of J terminals. The
probability of correct resolution is equal to the joint probability
of correct detection of all terminals (active and idle), which
can be written as follows:
Pc,K = P K
D ¯P J−K
F
.
(2)
To obtain the expression for the average length of a super
epoch E[L] we consider that the resolution of any collision
of size K takes a random number of attempts described by a
geometric distribution with parameter ¯Pc,K from (2) and with
average number of attempts given by 1/Pc,K. Therefore the
average length of a super epoch conditional on the collision
size is given by:
E[L|K] = E[l|K]
Pc,K
,
where
E[l|K] = KPD + (J − K)PF + ¯P K

RANDOM BACKLOG RETRANSMISSION STRATEGY
In the second retransmission strategy, backlogged terminals
use a random retransmission scheme with a probability that
is forced to match the transmission probability of the system
p. This assumption simpliﬁes the derivation of metrics in the
system. In the case of different selection of retransmission
probability, it is necessary to use a Markov chain model of
the system and a two-state model for each terminal in the
network (see [6]). Terminals involved in a collision with an
unsuccessful ﬁrst epoch will retransmit at different time slots
randomly selected. The steps of the random retransmission
scheme are enumerated in Algorithm 2. To investigate this
scheme, we will use a modiﬁed trafﬁc balance equation written
as follows:
p = λE[L] = λ(pE[Lr] + ¯pE[lir]),
(11)
where Lr and lir indicate, respectively, the length of a relevant
super-epoch and irrelevant epochs. It is called relevant because
it denotes the super-epoch where a given terminal is involved
in transmission. In the random retransmission strategy, the
average number of attempts is dictated by the probability of
success resolution, denoted here by Pc and given by:
Pc = PD(pPD + ¯p ¯
PF )J−1
The number of attempts has therefore a geometric distribution
with parameter ¯Pc and with average given by
¯
Pc
Pc . Now, since
the retransmission attempt is randomized, there is a number of
resolution periods ignored by the backlogged terminal. Another
geometric distribution of this inter attempt process is modelled
with parameter ¯p and average given by ¯p
p. The ﬁnal expression
is thus given by:
E[Lr] =
¯Pc
Pc
 ¯p
pE[lir] + E[lr]

where the average length of a relevant and an irrelevant epoch
can be written, respectively, as follows:

and
E[lir] = (J − 1)PA + PF + ¯PF ¯P J−1

RESULTS
The results discussed in this section have been obtained
with a network conﬁguration with J = 16 terminals with
an average SNR γ of 7, 10, and 15 dB. The detection
threshold has been adjusted to obtain a probability of false
alarm of PF = 0.01. Figure 2 shows the stable throughput
T = Jλ versus different trafﬁc load values. Figure 3 shows
the delay experienced by the two retransmission schemes.
It can be observed that the persistent retransmission scheme
only slightly outperforms the random retransmission strategy,
particularly at low SNR. Both strategies seem to be able to
achieve the maximum throughput previously estimated in [1]
for the conventional version of the protocol without backlog
trafﬁc. This is a signiﬁcant result that paves the way for further
analysis about the equivalence of stability and throughout
metrics of the protocol.
It is worth pointing out that the main virtues of the random
retransmission strategy cannot be fully observed in the ﬁgures

provided here. The random strategy will be optimum in net-
works affected by deep and long fades, or with terminals with
long term degrading channel conditions. Therefore, the reader
should keep in mind that random retransmission will play an
important role in particular network situations. Future networks
are meant to be more adaptive and cognitive to network and
channel conditions, and therefore it is expected that different
backlog retransmission strategies can be adopted on the ﬂy
to maximize performance. Another aspect to point out is that
in comparison with ALOHA solutions, NDMA protocols are
capable to adopt persistent retransmission strategies, which
in ALOHA is practically impossible. Once a collision event
occurs in ALOHA, terminals must engage in random backlog
retransmission algorithms, mainly because the repetition of
the same collision event (used in persistent retransmission
schemes) leads inevitably to unstable performance. This is
another proof that NDMA is considerably better in terms of
stability than its ALOHA counterparts.
Regarding delay in Figure 4, both algorithms seem to
achieve the same performance. Delay is degraded as trafﬁc load
reaches the maximum channel transmission rate. The values of
delay suggest that NDMA has good performance for real time
systems only at moderate trafﬁc loads and at relatively high
values of SNR. To further illustrate the difference between
the conventional NDMA and the proposed retransmission
algorithms, Figure 4 shows the average length of the super
epochs of the two algorithms. It can be observed that the
super-epochs clearly are larger by several orders of magnitude
than the conventional NDMA, which is consequence of the
retransmission schemes. However, the reader must remember
that the original protocol ignores the effects of backlog trafﬁc,
whereas in the present approach we estimate the effects of
backlog trafﬁc by inducing further retransmissions so that
we can evaluate the performance of the algorithm in such
conditions. Note that at high SNR the retransmission schemes
are closer in performance to the average length of the epoch
in the conventional NDMA protocol.

CONCLUSIONS
This paper has presented two retransmission schemes
of backlog trafﬁc for the conventional NDMA protocol in

Rayleigh block fading and non-dispersive channels. It has
been observed that under these assumptions the persistent
retransmission strategy, where terminals involved in an un-
successful resolution keep retransmitting until the collision is
resolved, provides the best results achieving an almost identical
value as the throughput without backlog trafﬁc consideration.
However, the random retransmission strategy with a retrans-
mission probability equal to the system transmission rate
performs almost identically, but it has the further advantage
of being suitable for scenarios with deep and long-term fades
or with terminals with persistent bad channels conditions. The
results show that NDMA considerably outperforms stability of
ALOHA solutions. It has been also shown that for high SNR
values, the persistent retransmission scheme boils down to the
conventional NDMA solution. The importance of the results
in this paper is that NDMA shows great potential for handling
future low-latency trafﬁc, particularly at high values of SNR
and moderate trafﬁc loads. Additionally, we have obtained for
the ﬁrst time a ﬁgure of the performance of NDMA with
backlog trafﬁc, thus helping in the evaluation of the stability
properties of this type of protocol.

A. Derivation of the ﬁrst- and second-order moments of the
length of an epoch-slot in (3) and (10), respectively, condi-
tional on the number of contending terminals K in the ﬁrst
retransmission scheme (persistent retransmission)
The length of an epoch in NDMA can be regarded as
the linear combination of the contribution of the following
terms: 1) active terminals correctly detected, 2) idle terminals
incorrectly considered as active (due to false alarm), and
3) the contribution of only one time slot when no terminal
is detected (either active or idle). The ﬁrst contribution of
active terminals conditional on K contending terminals has a
binomial distribution with parameter PD. Using the properties
of the binomial distribution, this component has an average
given by KPD and a variance given by KPD(KPD + ¯PD).
Similarly, the contribution of the remaining J − K terminals
has also binomial distribution with parameter PF , average
(J − K)PF and variance (J − K)PF [(J − K)PF + ¯PF ].
Finally, the probability that no terminals is detected as active
is given by
¯
PD
K ¯P J−K
F
with one time slot contribution to
the average and the variance of the length of the epoch slot.
The expressions for the ﬁrst order moment is given by the
combination of the average lengths:
E[l|K] = KPD + (J − K)PF + ¯
PD
K ¯P J−K

,
while the variance is given by the second-order combination
of the three components:
E[l2|K] = KPD(KPD + ¯PD)+(J −K)PF [(J −K)PF + ¯PF ]
+2KPD(J − K)PF + ¯P K

B. Derivation of the ﬁrst- and second-order moments in (12)
and (16), respectively of the length of a relevant epoch-slot in
the second retransmission scheme
A relevant epoch is deﬁned as the resolution period where
a particular terminal under study is assumed to be always
present in the collision event. Since the detection of a persistent
terminal has two detection cases, the derivation of the average
length of a relevant epoch is split into two cases: when the
persistent terminal is correctly detected with probability PD,
and when the terminal is incorrectly detected with probability
¯PD = 1 − PD. When the persistent terminal is correctly
detected (j ∈ ˆTd ∩T , where T is the set of colliding terminals
and Td is the set of terminals detected as active), the Probability
Mass Function (PMF) of the length of an epoch is given by a
modiﬁed binomial distribution with parameter PA considering
one terminal j is always present in the collision set and is
always correctly detected:
Pr{l = m|j ∈ ˆTd∩T }

and in the case the persistent terminal is not detected as active
(j ̸∈ ˆTd; j ∈ T ) we obtain:

The unconditional average length of a relevant epoch is ob-
tained by averaging over these previous two PMFs weighted
by their probability of occurrence as follows:
E[lr] = PDE[l|j ∈ ˆTd ∩ T ] + ¯PDE[l|j ̸∈ ˆTd; j ∈ T ],
which can be proved, using the properties of binomial distri-
butions, to lead to:
E[lr] = PD[(J − 1)PA + 1] + ¯PD[(J − 1)PA + ¯P J−1
A
],
which after some algebraic operations yields the desired ex-
pression in (12). Similarly the second order moment can be
computed as follows:
E[l2
r] = PDE[l2|j ∈ ˆTd ∩ T ] + ¯PDE[l2|j ̸∈ ˆTd; j ∈ T ],
which yields:
E[l2
r] = PD{(J −1)PA[ ¯PA +(J −1)PA]+2(J −1)PA +1}+
¯PD{(J − 1)PA[ ¯PA + (J − 1)PA] + ¯P J−1
A
]},
which after some algebraic operations yields the desired ex-
pression in (16).
