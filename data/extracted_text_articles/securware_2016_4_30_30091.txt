Abstract – The security futurology is the science of the future,
which deals with the theory, study and creation of variants of
possible developments in the security situation. When creating
reliable forecasts, it is necessary to use the scientific methods.
Futurologists use a wide range of qualitative and quantitative
forecasting
methods.
This
article
describes
the
basic
assumptions of the proposal of a new universal prognostic
method. An important aspect of the proposal is the efficiency,
reliability, speed and the verifiability of method of forecasting
of the security situation. An universal prognostic method for
the creation of security forecasts does not currently exist.

I.
INTRODUCTION
Futurology
(also
called
futures
studies)
is
an
interdisciplinary science which aims to create forecasts in
the form of visions and scenarios of possible developments.
These forecasts are based on the application of rational and
scientific findings and methods. Security is a subject of
theoretical research, as a specialized part of social sciences.
A part of future studies is a security futurology, which deals
with the future and development of the security situation in
social groups, objects, sectors, companies, regions, states,
the universe, etc. Security futurology field includes:
•
Military security,
•
Economic security,
•
Political security,
•
Societal security
•
Cultural security,
•
Environmental security [1].
Besides the above mentioned sectors of security, many
specific types of security exist, e.g., cyber security, data
security, network security, energy security, food security,
public security, human security, communications security,
etc. [1].
Future studies are also classified according to the
approach to the creation of a forecast into the following two
groups:
•
Explorative futurology (the aim is to search for
answers to the question "What happens if….?"),
•
Normative futurology ("What must be done for
something to happen ....?").
Many predictions (technology, military, information
technology (IT) security, etc.) were mistaken. For example:
"I think there is a world market for maybe five computers,"
(T. Watson, CEO of IBM, 1943), “Cellular phones will
absolutely not replace local wire systems,” (M. Cooper,
inventor, 1981), “I predict the Internet in 1996 [will]
catastrophically collapse,” (R. Metcalfe, 3Com, 1995), etc.
In the case of forecasting security situations, reliable and
verifiable forecasts must be processed that help especially in
the decision-making. Forecasts can be verified in several
ways (application of multiple methods, expert correction,
etc.). Other benefits of futurology studies include:
•
Warning of the impacts of adverse developments,
•
Support in seeking optimal solutions to the problems
of society,
•
Forecasting of future states,
•
Support the preparation for the negative impacts
•
Search for new ideas and of long term targets,
•
Learning, extension of knowledge of stakeholders,
•
Adaptation, increasing the ability to adapt.
Prognostic methods should permit the processing of
forecasts in accordance with the fundamental principles of
prognostication (complexity, systematicness, verifiability,
determination,
continuity,
coordination,
fortuitousness,
efficiency, focus on practice, dynamism, quantification,
method, etc.) [2].
Futurologists
use
a
lot
of
scientific
methods
for
predicting the future, but there is no universal method that
can be used in forecasting of the security situation [5]. The
procedure for designing new methods should include:
•
Analysis of the subject of security futurology,
•
Comparison of forecasting methods,
•
Reliability
analysis
of
forecasts
of
security
development,
•
The relationship between attacks (threats) and the
technology and tools,
•
A proposal of the optimal process of security
forecasts formation
•
A proposal methods and tools,
•
Availability of techniques and tools, processing large
volumes of data.

Section
2
describes
the
basics
of
forecasting
methodology.
A
summary
of
forecasting
methods
is
presented in Section 3. All specific methods will be
explained in greater detail in future works.
There is no universal method that can be used in
forecasting of the security situation. The main objective of
this proposal is fast and reliable forecasting method. This
method should be based on the specifications of the
individual sectors of security.
II.
METHODOLOGY OF FORECASTING
Future studies in their current form mainly include
forecasting, planning, programming, future studies, future
research, technological and social forecasting (foresighting),
creation
of
alternative
scenarios,
the
construction
of
indicators of future development etc.[5]
The prognosis is a key outcome of the process of
forecasting. The prognosis is a statement about the future of
the object or condition that is based on scientific facts. The
prognosis does not indicate what will happen, but what could
happen [6].
The forecasts should be based on the analysis of
regularities
of
social
and
economic
development,
identification and evaluation of social needs and interests,
identification and evaluation of economic and security goals
and development priorities.
Basic phases of forecasting include:
•
Identifying and defining the problem of prognosis,
•
Preparation of process of developing forecasts
•
Obtaining information,
•
Sorting of information,
•
Analysis of information
•
Select suitable methods for creating forecasts,
•
Implementation of selected methods,
•
Elaboration forecasts,
•
Stylization of forecasts,
•
Verification of forecasts [5].
III.
FORECASTING METHODS
Futurologists
use
a
lot
of
scientific
methods
for
forecasting the future. Application of an appropriate method
is dependent on many factors, such as fields, type, range and
target of forecast, time horizon, available data, knowledge
and experience, etc. During the processing of a forecast, a
combination of several forecasting methods is usually used.
A basic classification of forecasting methods includes:
•
qualitative methods
•
quantitative methods [3].
Qualitative methods are based on knowledge, experience
and opinion of experts. These methods are also referred to as
subjective, reflection or intuitive. These methods are used in
situations where there is not enough data from the past. The
advantage of quantitative methods is the use of a relatively
large
amount
of
expert
information.
Conversely,
the
disadvantages
are
unsystematic
evaluation
of acquired
information and also bias of experts. These methods are
more suitable for long-term prognosis [4].
Quantitative methods (also referred to as objective
methods, statistical methods) are based on application of
statistical analysis of historical data [10]. These methods use
mathematical models and equations for determining of time
horizons in the future. These methods assume that the
identified
trends
and
their
measurable
indicators
will
continue well into the future [7]. The main advantage of the
application of quantitative methods is an objective and
accurate verification of predictions. These methods are
suitable for the formation of short- and medium-term
forecasts [2].
Figure 1.
Classification of forecasting methods
In contrast to the aforementioned classification of
forecasting methods in accordance with the degree of
subjectivity, the same group of methods can be classified
also according to the application within the prognostic
activities:
•
Universal method
•
Structured methods,
•
Procedural methods [3][4].
Universal methods are widely used and are suitable for
processing of most types of forecasts within different time
periods
and
different
sectors.
Structural
methods
are
applicable in identifying and exploring the object of interest
and its structure. Procedural methods are used primarily for
processing of chronological sequence analysis of monitored
indicators in different periods of time. Procedural methods
are particularly suitable for creating of development trends of
monitored objects to the future [7][11].

methods. A more detailed explanation of the methods can be
found in [4].
IV.
APPLICATION OF METHODOLOGY
The new method (universal quantitative and qualitative
method, which is based on the specifications of individual
sectors of security) can be applied for example in military
security.
Military
security
includes,
for
example,
the
following predictions:
•
Military conflicts,
•
Arms spending,
•
Development of missile technology,
•
Development in military structures, organizations,
•
Development of the number of persons in the armed
forces, and determining the roles of the armed
forces,
•
The cooperation of the armed forces and their
participation in the Alliance,
•
Methods of warfare,
•
Content of military doctrinal documents,
•
Military art, strategy, operational art, tactics,
•
Military education,
•
Development of science and research in the military,
•
Method of preparing troops,
•
Military capabilities,
•
The possibility of the defense industry, etc.
The new approach is especially well suited for predicting
military security [8][9].
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Futurologists
use
a
lot
of
scientific
methods
for
forecasting the future. The field of security futurology uses
universal, structural and procedural methods. There is no
universal method that can be used in forecasting of the
security situation. The new method should be based on the
specifications of the individual sectors of security (military,
political, societal, economic and environmental security).
The method should combine and optimize the qualitative and
quantitative methods. Scenario methods are very useful for
predicting the security situation. An important requirement is
the rapid collection of expert and statistical data and
processing them using computer technology.
