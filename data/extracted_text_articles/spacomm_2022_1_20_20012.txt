Abstract - A miniaturized selective composite microstrip Band Pass 
Filter (BPF) with a 3-dB fractional bandwidth of 52.5% (14.2 GHz 
to 
24.5‚ÄâGHz) 
with 
wide 
upper 
stop-band 
for 
satellite 
communication (SATCOM) application is proposed. The design 
consists of a composite BPF implanted with a pair of quarter-
wavelength open-circuited stub and spurline. These elements are 
combined to form a miniaturized filter with a compact occupied 
area of 0.72Œªg√ó 0.55 Œªg (‚âà 0.26‚Äâcm2). The filter is simulated on 
0.008‚Äù (0.203 mm) Rogers 4003C with dielectric constant, …õr=3.55 
using commercial full-wave electromagnetic simulator HFSS v16. 
Simulated results show that BPF has resonant frequency (f0) as 
14.2 GHz and wide (>3f0) stop band without increasing the circuit 
size. Further, Spurline behaves as notch filter to suppress the first 
harmonics (or second pass band) of the proposed BPF.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
     Band Pass Filters (BPFs) have found numerous applications 
in satellite communication and play a vital role in several 
microwave and Radio Frequency (RF) applications. A high 
filtering performance, compact size, wide bandwidth, low 
insertion loss, wide upper stop-band and low cost are amongst 
the desired criteria while designing a band-pass filter [1].  In 
recent time, a significant amount of research work has been 
going on to design a compact BPF with high selectivity and 
good stop band performance for Ku/K band applications. Due 
to scarcity of the bandwidth in lower bands and availability in 
higher bands, the Ku/K band has become very popular for 
various satellite communication (SATCOM) applications [2]. 
     Significant studies have been done over the past few years 
on the design of wideband band pass filters for Ku/K frequency 
bands using microstrip and Substrate Integrated Waveguide 
(SIW) [3] technology. Xu et al. [4] projected a Ku band BPF 
using folded feedlines and quarter-wavelength stepped-
impedance resonators to generate multiple coupling paths. Lin 
et al. [5] proposed a compact novel K band BPF based on 
Photonic Band Gap (PBG) structure. Owing to its slow-wave 
characteristics, the PBG structure reduces the filter size to one-
tenth of conventional filters with spurious free response and 
deep attenuation level. The filter design cascaded several PBG 
structures introducing a coupling gap. Recently, Navya et al. [6] 
proposed the design of a low-profile and broad band BPF for Ku 
band satellite applications which consisted of four Œª/4 
transmission lines and two feed lines to connect the resonating 
lines. In addition, selective band-pass filters for Ku and K bands 
have been reported by [7] using folded SIW technology 
incorporating E shape slot in the middle septum. Also, a 
wideband band-pass filter for Ku band was proposed by [8] 
using multi-mode resonator Substrate Integrated Waveguide 
(SIW) technology. Nonetheless, these filters suffered from 
fabrication complexity due to metallic vias. Further, stop-band 
response was not very satisfactory. In 
the 
past, 
various 
researchers have proposed band pass filters, but either the 
design was quite complex with large size or it suffered from 
poor selectivity or poor stop band. The present work utilizes the 
expediency of open stubs and spurline with a composite band 
pass filter for realizing miniaturized selective band pass filter 
with wide stop-band. Also, the proposed filter is very easy to 
fabricate. The designs are simulated using electromagnetic 
(EM) simulator High Frequency Structure Simulation (HFSS) 
v.16 software [9].  
     Section I explains the introduction and literature review. The 
rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section II explains the 
design of the composite band-pass filter by combing a low pass 
and high pass filter. Section III shows the effect of adding open 
stub on the composite band pass filter for better selectivity. 
Section IV discusses the effect of adding spurlines for 
enhancing stop band performance and, finally, Section V 
presents the conclusion of the proposed work.

II. DESIGN OF THE COMPOSITE BAND PASS FILTER 
      A wideband BPF can be designed by cascade of a Low Pass 
Filter (LPF) and a High Pass Filter (HPF) [10], as shown in 
Figure 1.  In this contribution, a stepped impedance structure 
has been used to design the LPF section as it occupies less area. 
The function of stepped impedance LPF is to attenuate the 
second pass-band (harmonics) in the upper stop-band. For 
attaining the high-pass characteristic, quarter-wave long short-
circuited stubs are tapped to the high-impedance sections of the 
low-pass filter to insert attenuation poles at DC. The objective 
of the proposed band pass filter is to achieve high selectivity and 
roll off rate.  
 
A. Design of Maximally Flat (Butterworth) Low Pass Filter 
(LPF) 
      A butterworth filter has advantage of having more linear 
phase response in the pass-band thereby able to provide better 
group delay performance. The column 2 gives element value 
(g)[10] for maximally flat LPF for N=5. The width and lengths 
of hi ‚Äìlow impedance sections for maximally flat Low Pass 
filter (LPF) with cutoff frequency (fc) = 24 GHz, Filter order (N) 
= 5, substrate RT Roger 4003 (…õr = 3.55) and substrate height 
(h) = 0.203 mm is calculated using [11] and is given below in 
table 1. We have considered Zl (low impedance value) = 20 Œ©, 
Zh (high impedance value) =120 Œ©, and characteristic 
impedance, Ro=50 Œ©. The electrical length (Œ≤l) for C is found 
using expression 
C
Ro √ó Zl  and for L, it is given as

overall dimensions of LPF are:  Length, L = 4.4 mm and Width, 
W = 4.0 mm.

          Figure 3 shows the frequency response of LPF. From the 
graph, it is clear that the LPF possess cutoff frequency of 24 
GHz.

B. Shorted Stub as High Pass Filter (HPF)  
      To realize the lower frequency stop-band, quarter-wave 
short circuited stubs are used with metallic via at the open end 
of the stub which acts as HPF section of the composite BPF. The 
length of shorted stub is Œªg/4 (Œªg : guided wavelength) which 
turns out to be 1.8 mm for lower cutoff frequency (fl). 
C. Design of Composite Band Pass Filter 
      To design a composite band pass filter, a High Pass Filtering 
(HPF) section need to be combined with Low Pass Filtering 
(LPF) section. The quarter wavelength (Œªg/4) long short 
circuited stubs act as HPF. After examining various orientations 
of shorted stubs, it was found that the shorted stubs placed in 
alternating positions as shown in Figure 4, gave satisfactory 
response. The value of various design parameters are as follows: 
diameter (D) =0.25 mm, width (W5) = 0.5 mm and length (L5) 
= 2.6 mm.  The overall dimension of the filter is 6 mm x 4.4 
mm.

         Figure 5 depicts the frequency response of the composite 
BPF. From graph it can be seen that the filter center frequency 
(fo) is 18.5 GHz with % Fractional Bandwidth (FBW) of 48%. 
Further, there appears first harmonic placed near 2fo in the stop 
band which results in poor stopband performance. Also, the 
selectivity of the filter is quite poor.

WITH OPEN STUBS 
         To improve the stop band performance and enhance the 
selectivity of the proposed elliptic filter, open stubs of length 
Œªg/4 are placed opposite to the shorted stubs, as shown in Figure

                        Figure 6. Band-pass Filter with open stubs 
      To generate a band notch in an Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) 
BPF, Shaman et al. [12] has proposed the concept of embedded 
open-circuit stub. The notch effect occurs when the length of 
open stub is quarter wavelength long [13]. The resonant 
behavior of Œªg/4   open-stub can be explained by the equivalent 
circuit as shown in Figure 7.

From the transmission line theory, input impedance for the 
open-stub is given as:

          From (1), the impedance of open-sub is low at integer 
multiple (n Œªg/4 ) of resonant frequency thus achieving band-
stop or notch characteristics. Also, open stub introduces one 
Transmission Zero (TZ) augmenting the selectivity of the filter 
by suppressing the undesired harmonic [14]. The length of the 
open stub to suppress first spurious responses (located near 
twice of the fundamental frequency) is calculated to be:   
L6=1.55 mm. The width W6 is kept at 0.30 mm.                     
Figure 8 depicts the frequency response of composite BPF 
embedded with open stubs. From the curve, it is apparent that 
the center frequency (fo) of the band pass filter is 19.6 GHz with 
FBW calculated to be 54.6%.

Figure 8. Frequency response of band pass filter with open stubs 
       Also it is evident from frequency response that the first 
harmonic (near 2fo) is suppressed up to -10 dB with the addition 
of open stubs, but still stop band performance is not satisfactory. 
IV. COMPOSITE BAND PASS FILTER INTEGRATED 
WITH OPEN STUBS AND SPURLINE 
       Generally, by cascading additional open stubs into 
microstrip filter, a wider and a deeper rejection can be achieved. 
The drawback of this method is high insertion loss in the 
passband and increased circuit size.  A spurline is realized by 
etching L shape slot on microstrip line exhibiting band-stop 
(notch) characteristics and also used for further suppressing the 
harmonics [15][16]. The spur-line filter consists of coupling 
between two microtrip lines. Figure 9 shows a spur-line filter 
configuration. Here, ‚ÄòA‚Äô is the length of the spur-line and B is 
width of the microstrip line. 
 
Figure 9. Structure of spurline 
         
      Figure 10 shows the structure of the proposed band pass 
filter incorporating open stubs and spurline. All the dimensions 
in this layout have been mentioned earlier.

Figure 10. Band pass filter with open stub and spurline 
       Figure 11 shows the parametric analysis of spurline for 
various lengths. The length of spurline (A) is calculated by using 
parametric analysis and it is found that first harmonic (fo = 38.5 
GHz) is well suppressed below -20 dB for spurline length (A) 
equal to 0.75 mm.  
 
Figure 11. Parametric analysis of spurline for various lengths 
      Figure 12 shows the frequency response of final proposed 
band pass filter with open stubs and spurline. It is evident from 
the response that filter has pass-band from 14.2 GHz to 24.5 
GHz with center frequency (fo) at 19.2 GHz and % FBW  
calculated to be 52.5%. As can be seen from Figure 12, that   
additional attenuation is achieved at the first harmonic 
frequency by the incorporation of the spur line without 
increasing the circuit size. The harmonic at 38.5 GHz (2fo) is 
suppressed from -10 dB to -22 dB with the spurline band-stop 
filter (BSF).  
     Hence, an improvement in suppression of 12 dB is achieved 
and out-of-band rejection level is ‚â• 20 dB.

V. CONCLUSION 
       In this paper, a microstrip composite BPF is proposed and 
simulated using shunt open stubs and spurlines. Basically, open-
stub section helps in achieving a wide rejection bandwidth. 
Further, Spurline with its inherently compact characteristics is 
inserted on input/output feed-lines that introduce attenuation 
pole to further suppress the higher harmonic mode resulting in 
better rejection performance without increasing the size. The 
proposed filter has merit of compact size with good filtering 
properties and can be useful for various SATCOM applications.
