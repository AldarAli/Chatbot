Abstract— The main purpose for visualizing medical data in 
Clinical Information Systems (CISs) is to convert the medical 
data in relevant information about the patient’s health status. 
The process of conversion from single disparate data into 
useful information considers as relevant input datasets the 
known clinical problems and their clinical pathway, the 
already collected medical data and the social, demographic and 
administrative data. Visualization of the medical data 
represents the operational decision support system at point of 
care. The concept presented in this paper is a potential solution 
to the existing CISs’ shortcomings, through the extent of the 
timeline-based social networking experience to medical 
software, and at the same time, by applying the industry 
standard of business process modeling, Business Process 
Modeling Notation (BPMN) 2.0 in encoding the clinical 
pathways and administrative processes. The primary goal of 
the Timeline-based Clinical Case Management System 
(TCCMS) is to give a comprehensive picture of patients’ 
condition, both real-time as well as historically, using textual 
and graphic means, and to sustain, in a task-oriented approach 
and based on advanced decision support algorithms, the 
application of accurate treatment plans and actions. This 
paper presents a data visualization concept that hides under a 
simple temporal relation all the complexity of medical field, 
into a familiar Graphical User Interface (GUI), promoted by 
social networks in the last years, finally giving the chance to 
healthcare IT to become completely paperless.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
“The Electronic Health Record (EHR) is a longitudinal 
electronic record of patient health information generated by 
one or more encounters in any care delivery setting. 
Included in this information are patient demographics, 
progress notes, problems, medications, vital signs, past 
medical history, immunizations, laboratory data and 
radiology reports.” [1] 
A large majority of the existing CISs emphasizes the 
need for separating between accessing medical history and 
the operational user interface. 
The current CISs' market covers most of the healthcare 
provider operational needs in regard to clinical services with 
some degree of support for point of care clinical decisions. 
The GUI for documenting clinical cases is centered usually 
on patient and patient banner in order to help the medical 
personnel to easily identify the current patient clinical 
context. 
This ensures a comprehensive standard-based approach 
in regards to CISs functionalities, which is regulated by the 
world’s leading medical informatics organizations: HL7 
EHRS [2], CCHIT [3], Eurorec [4] / Prorec [5], etc. 
In this context, in order to analyze the current state of the 
art, we need to structure the existing knowledge in three 
domains: clinical pathway visualization, relevant medical 
data visualization (medical and administrative) and the 
combination of these two - medical data in clinical context. 
Clinical pathway visualization should be considered from 
two points of view: from the point of view of clinical 
pathway encoder or designer, and from the point of view of 
the one who is executing the patient current clinical pathway 
requested actions. Projects/solutions like Protégé [6], Tallis 
Toolset [7], GUIDE [8], GLARE [9], VisiGuide [10], 
AsbruView [11], etc., are suitable for encoding and/or 
execution of a clinical pathway, but with limited adoption by 
the healthcare providers. 
Not necessary in relation with the clinical context, 
projects like Graphical Summary of Patient Status [12], Time 
Lines and LifeLines [13], PatternFinder [14], KNAVE and 
KNAVE-II 
[15], 
VISITORS 
[16], 
VIE-VISU 
[17], 
Interactive Parallel Bar Charts (IPBC) [18], Gravi++ [19], 
and others moved in the direction of visualizing the medical 
relevant data.  
There are also very few combined approaches of medical 
data in clinical context: Guideline Overview Tool (GOT) 
[20], Midgaard [21], CareVis [22], NHS Common User 
Interface [23], Visual-D [24], but most of them failed to be 
widely adopted. 
The barriers in CISs’ adoption are mainly generated by 
the GUI complexity through the magnitude of change 
perceived by medical personnel accustomed to work with 
paper documents. The CISs usually ignore their practices and 
their social, communication and professional context and this 
is reflected in unified browsing experience for heterogeneous 
data and inefficient decision support at point of care. 
The potential solution to the previously mentioned CISs’ 
shortcomings consists in extending of the timeline-based 
social networking experiences to medical field by hiding 
under a simple temporal relation all the complexity of 
medical field with benefits especially in user adoption and 
learning curve.

II. 
MEDICAL DATA VIZUALIZATION  
The main purpose of medical data visualization in 
patient-centric CISs is to convert the medical data in relevant 
information about the patient’s health status. The process of 
conversion from disparate data into useful information 
should be analyzed at least from several perspectives: 
communication, computer science (and GUI) and healthcare 
domain (especially, clinical context and clinical pathway). 
The relevant input datasets which are used by the data 
visualization process could be grouped in three categories: 
known clinical problems and their clinical pathway, the 
already collected medical data and the social, demographic 
and administrative data. 
Basically, the medical data visualization in a CIS should 
represent the operational decision support system at point of 
care and at the same time a Clinical Case Management 
System (CCMS). 
It is essential to visualize the current clinical problem and 
its corresponding clinical pathway; also, to know what are 
the active problems (including chronic clinical problems), 
what the medical history is, what the recent objective 
observations are, what the social, demographic and 
administrative details are, etc. The progress observed in the 
patient treatment, the definitions of the clinical pathways 
with specific actions, stages, conditions and so on and 
nevertheless the best practices of the clinical problem (to 
treat the health problem) should be accessible. 
It is obvious that the level of adoption of industry 
standards in terms of functionality  it’s quite limited and the 
main barrier in adopting comes from the fact that 
implementation does not take into account the end user 
practices and their context. 
Medical personnel are accustomed to work with paper 
documents and previous attempts to create paperless 
solutions have failed due to the magnitude of change 
perceived by the often non-technical end users mainly 
because of GUI complexity. 
So, the medical professionals need a Clinical Case 
Management System, developed around their current social, 
communication and professional context, able to manage 
operational processes and, at the same time, to provide an 
efficient point of care decision support. 
III. 
TIMELINE-BASED CLINICAL CASE MANAGEMENT 
SYSTEM 
The concept presented in this paper is a potential solution 
to the previously mentioned shortcomings in order to extend 
the timeline-based social networking experiences to medical 
software and at the same time to introduce the industry 
standard of process modeling, BPMN [25], in encoding the 
clinical pathways. The primary goal of the Timeline-based 
Clinical Case Management System (TCCMS) is to offer a 
comprehensive picture of patients’ condition, both real-time 
as well as historically, using textual and graphical means, 
and to sustain, in a task-oriented approach and based on 
advanced decision support algorithms, the application of 
accurate treatment plans and actions. 
Furthermore, using clinical protocols and timelines, in 
combination with the visualization of patients’ relevant 
medical data, dramatically improves the point of care 
decision support. 
Another important characteristic of TCCMS is the fast 
development and reusability of medical templates, achieved 
through an external component, part of a Business Process 
Management Solution (BPMS) [26] also used to execute 
clinical protocols and guidelines that encode and organize 
the decisions and action tasks for the medical personnel. 
A BPM-based case management solution in healthcare 
offers the benefits of configurable workflows for both the 
medical areas (clinical pathways) 
as 
well as 
the 
administrative areas (Admission, Discharge and Transfer). 
An example of BPM implementation of administrative 
processes (outpatient encounter) is presented in Figure 1. 
The presented process allows the basic management of the 
outpatient encounter, managing also the exceptions like 
encounter reactivation, automatic checkout or canceling the 
encounter. The notifications are also part of the process 
definition by the fact that the process can be started based on 
a received message from the appointment system, and also, 
the process contains a throw notification event designed in 
fact for the communication with inpatient encounters 
systems. 
Based on the medical documents associated with a 
patient and on a complex array of business rules as a part of 
the current clinical pathway, relevant alerts regarding a 
specific patient (e.g., allergies, high cardiovascular disease 
risks etc.) will be triggered. Moreover, the alerts must 
suggest recommended actions to be taken as a consequence.  
During clinical pathway encoding, using the clinical 
pathway development environment as a collection of 
workflows designer, advanced business rules designer, 
process simulators and execution engine, the clinical 
pathway encoder has the possibility to define customized 
alerts based on a patient conditions, in order to generate at 
runtime all sorts of critical patients’ status notifications.

Figure 1. TCCMS - Simple BPMN representation of outpatient encounter 
 
TCCMS overcomes the problem raised from the 
unavailability of easily interpretable clinical guides within 
existing medical applications and takes the recording of 
clinical information beyond historical and statistical reasons, 
by being a proactive solution that is giving a strong 
decisional support to the medical personnel. As a concept, 
TCCMS targets directly any type of healthcare provider. 
 
The central piece of this approach is the Clinical 
Timeline, representing a historical view of clinical 
documents disposed along a vertical time axis as thumbnails, 
which offers a clear and actionable insight into the patient’s 
clinical history, as presented in Figures 2 and 3.

As medical data sit at convergence the episode of care 
(the 
administrative 
sequences, 
usually 
collection 
of 
encounters) and episodes of illness (the medical events that 
are performed for treatment of a clinical problem), a 
comprehensive view of a patient’s case must include both 
these interrelated aspects. Moreover, complex clinical 
workflows and treatments available today lead to the 
collection of patient-centric information in the form of series 
of numbers (often representing analyses results), medical 
documents, images and videos, all coming from different 
equipment at different points in time. As such, one of the 
main benefits of this approach, when compared with the tried 
and proven patient encounter-based interfaces, is represented 
by the possibility of dynamically loading a large volume of 
data that is time-sorted, meaning that most recent analyses 
and results will be shown first, allowing physicians to have a 
quick overview of the patient’s situation. Moreover, the 
clinical timeline provides a unified browsing experience for a 
volume of heterogeneous data that was collected at different 
points in time and using a wide range of medical equipment. 
The pervasiveness of computing platforms and their 
wide-scale adoption has led to the emergence of several new 
methodologies for user interface design that have been 
widely embraced by the public. One of the relatively new 
means of data presentation is the timeline. In order to 
provide a gentle learning curve and natural grouping of 
information, TCCMS GUI concept presented in Figure 4, is 
developed around familiarity gained from social networking 
services like Facebook and suitability of this approach to the 
medical domain, and therefore embraced the established 
graphical presentation patterns. 
While not a new idea with regards to the presentation of 
medical information [29], timelines have been embraced 
with the advent of widely used social networks that 
popularized them. As such, they can be considered an 
already mature and well-known mean for data presentation, 
significantly reducing the steepness of the learning curve.

V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Despite the fact that EHR Systems are widely used, the 
paperless CISs are still a desideratum and the previous 
attempts failed due to the magnitude of change perceived by 
the often non-technical end users. 
 
The last decade has created a new paradigm in which 
users have realized the need for systems that do not need or 
have very little need of training. This paradigm is based on 
user habits and their knowledge field. 
Basically, the concept of Timeline-based Clinical Case 
Management System presented in this paper hides under a 
simple temporal relation all the complexity of medical field, 
the complexity of clinical pathways and administrative 
protocols and the decision support into a familiar Graphical 
User Interface, promoted by social networks in the last years,  
finally giving the chance to healthcare IT to become 
completely paperless. 
Part of the concept described above is implemented in a 
Personal Healthcare Record solution [27] since 2012 and in 
2013 was tested on small scale healthcare professionals’ 
pilots on two verticals: oncology and family doctors. All the 
implementations proved significant benefits in user adoption 
and learning curve. 
 Currently TCCMS is under industrial implementation as 
a multitenant/cloud solution and the underlying development 
technologies are: Bonita BPM [28], Node.js [29] and 
AngularJS [30].
