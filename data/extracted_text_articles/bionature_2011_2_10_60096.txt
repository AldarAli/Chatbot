Abstract — The struggle to decarbonise future power systems 
is boosting the diffusion of high-efficiency distributed multi-
generation (DMG) systems. In this respect, small-scale (below 5 
MWe) cogeneration systems for producing heat and power, as 
well as trigeneration systems for additional production of 
cooling, could play a key role. In this paper, a general 
analytical model for assessing the potential CO2 emission 
reduction from DMG systems, in case coupled to heat/cooling 
networks, is presented. Different available solutions are 
analysed. Numerical applications make reference to typical 
emission intensity figures in Europe. The results show that the 
emission reduction potential is primarily a function of the 
electrical efficiency and therefore of the size, and is strongly 
affected by the baseline comparative references. The 
environmental benefits decrease if part of cogenerated heat is 
used to generate cooling power with single-effect absorption 
chillers or adsorption chillers.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The evolution of power systems is being deeply 
influenced by the growing need for cutting CO2 emissions 
from energy generation. Combined Heat and Power (CHP) 
plants allow more efficient fuel energy input utilization with 
respect to classical Separate Production (SP) means in which 
electricity is generated in centralized power plants and heat 
in traditional boilers [1]. This enhanced overall efficiency 
can bring along CO2 emission reduction, also depending on 
the fuel carbon content and on the emission intensity of the 
displaced sources. In the past, economy-of-scale factors 
limited the adoption of CHP plants to relatively large 
industrial users or District Heating Networks (DHN). 
Conversely, today various Distributed Generation (DG) 
technologies, potentially clustered within micro-grids [2] and 
mostly fuelled on natural gas, are available for local 
exploitation of cogenerated heat at different capacities. In 
particular, on a small-scale level (up to 5 MWe) mature CHP 
prime movers include Stirling Engines (SE, available for 
micro-CHP applications in single dwellings, typically up to 
10 kWe) [3][4], Microturbines (MT, in the capacity range 30-
300 kWe), and Internal Combustion Engines (ICE, up to 5 
MWe) [4]. Heat networks may be needed to interconnect a 
set of possible users to a large prime mover, so as to 
establish an adequate overall thermal load. 
As a further issue to be addressed, the profitability of 
CHP systems can be consistently affected by low thermal 
loads in the summertime, when the need for space heating is 
not present and only domestic hot water makes up the 
thermal demand. Hence, the CHP unit, sized on the basis of 
the winter thermal demand, could operate at partial load and 
often be switched off below a certain loading threshold, 
losing all or at least part of the benefits from cogeneration 
production. A spreading solution relies on the possibility of 
exploiting cogenerated heat for cooling production by means 
of Water Absorption or Adsorption Chillers (WAC) [5], 
leading to set up the so-called trigeneration or Combined 
Cooling Heat and Power (CCHP) plants [6]. Hence, in a 
CCHP plant, the CHP prime mover can be operated at high 
loading level also in the summertime, contributing to cover 
an air conditioning demand that is steadily rising even in the 
northern European countries. For larger plants, the DHN 
may be used for heat distribution and the WAC sited at the 
building user interfaces [5]. Smaller plants without heat 
networks adopt a centralized cooling plant sited close to the 
CHP system and to the user. Single or aggregated user 
typologies such as hotels, hospitals, restaurants, department 
stores, offices, banks, residential blocks are typical potential 
applications for trigeneration systems on various scales. 
A CCHP plant is a particular case of the more general 
category of distributed multi-generation (DMG) systems [7] 
[8] enabling the dispatch of different types of energy and the 
conversion from one type of energy to another through 
suitably sized components, with possible other external 
networks for further exploitation of the energy products.  
The authors have illustrated and discussed the DMG 
concepts and applications in recent references, following a 
research line developed to highlight the perspectives and 
assess the potential of DMG applications in terms of energy

efficiency improvement [9]-[12] and environmental impact 
reduction [13]-[16], up to the formulation of a unified 
approach to define structured indicators to quantify the 
technical 
and 
environmental 
performance 
of 
multi-
generation systems [17]. 
The cost effectiveness of distributed CCHP systems, 
above all if coupled to DHN, requires thorough assessment. 
However, before running detailed economic analyses, simple 
and synthetic environmental models are needed to assess in 
which conditions and to which extent combined generation 
of multiple energy vectors can bring CO2 emission reduction 
relative to the status quo. In this respect, in this paper the 
Trigeneration CO2 Emission Reduction (TCO2ER) indicator 
[18][19] is adopted to estimate the potential CO2 emission 
saving 
characteristics 
from 
small-scale 
distributed 
trigeneration systems in different frameworks. The main 
objective is to formulate a simple analytical model, capable 
to highlight the parameters and variables involved in the 
analysis. The dependence of the emission reduction on the 
CCHP equipment efficiencies and on the emission intensities 
taken as reference for the conventional SP is investigated. 
Numerical applications are based on equipment currently 
available on the market and on the energy generation 
environment in Europe, with particular reference to the UK. 
II. 
TRIGENERATION SYSTEM STRUCTURE AND 
PERFORMANCE INDICATORS 
A. Structure, Components and Characteristics 
A CCHP plant is composed of the combination of a CHP 
plant (with auxiliary boilers for thermal back-up and peak 
shaving, as well as, in case, thermal storage), and a cooling 
plant fed by cogenerated heat, with possible heat networks. 
The CCHP plant is further interconnected with the electrical 
distribution grid, to enable buying/selling electricity 
according to the rules for electricity provision (depending on 
the tariff system or electricity market structure). 
Focusing on small-scale applications, we consider 
different types of technology, that is, SE, MT and ICE, all 
fed on natural gas. The WAC-based cooling plant can be 
composed of different technologies [6], to be suitably 
coupled to the CHP side. Single-effect absorption chillers, 
typically fired by hot water at around 90 °C, are considered 
in this paper for coupling to MT and ICE. Adsorption 
chillers, instead, may be fired by lower temperature sources 
and are available at capacities smaller than absorption 
chillers [5]; thus, they are adequate for combination with 
dwelling-sized SE. The CCHP system is usually electrically 
connected to the distribution network or to a microgrid. 
B. Energy

Models 
for 
Trigeneration 
Equipment and Heat Networks 
The energy performance of CHP prime movers can be 
synthetically described by means of the electrical efficiency 
W
 and the thermal efficiency 
Q
 . In addition, it is possible 
to characterize the CHP energy production in terms of heat-
to-electricity cogeneration ratio

(1) 
The terms W, Q and F in (1) respectively denote 
electricity, heat and fuel thermal energy, while the subscript 
y points out cogeneration entries.  
As for cooling generation equipment, the energy 
characteristics of a WAC are described by means of the COP 
(Coefficient Of Performance), ratio of the desired output 
(cooling energy R, in the form of chilled water for instance at 
7 °C) to the input (heat QR in the form of cogenerated hot 
water) [5]: 
COP  RQR
 
(2) 
All the above efficiencies depend upon the technology 
and upon several variables such as the loading level, the 
outdoor conditions, and so forth [4][5][20].  
As far as heat networks are concerned, two types of 
losses are in general present, namely, heat losses QL due to 
heat transfer with the colder external environment, and 
parasitic electrical pumping losses WL to overtake the 
hydraulic friction in the pipes. These loss contributions can 
be for instance expressed with respect to the cogenerated 
heat, as

Typical values of percentage heat losses εQ range 
between 1% for small networks (few hundreds meters) to 
10%-15% for large DHN (tens of kilometers). Typical 
percentage electrical parasitic losses εW due to pumping are 
of the order of 1% or even less for various applications 
[1][5]. 
C. CO2 Emission Performance Models for Trigeneration 
Equipment 
A consistent approach to evaluate the environmental 
performance of a trigeneration system by resorting to a 
system-orientated black-box representation is based on 
taking into account the mass of carbon dioxide involved in 
the exploitation of the energy system.  
The mass 
mX
 of CO2 emitted to produce the useful 
energy output X can be worked out as 
X
m
X
X

 
, where 
X
 is the CO2 emission factor (specific emissions) related to 
the generic useful energy output X (e.g., electricity or heat). 
With very good approximation, it is possible to consider the 
emission factor 
F
  related to the fuel thermal energy as a 
constant depending only upon the fuel carbon content and its 
Lower Heating Value (LHV). Hence, once given the fuel, the 
energy output-related emissions can be evaluated as a 
function of the device efficiency only, as [18][19]:

F
  can be averagely 
assumed equal to 200 g/kWht, on a LHV basis [21].

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT MODEL 
A. General 
Trigeneration 
CO2 
Emission 
Reduction 
Assessment Model 
In order to compare different energy generation 
alternatives, it is convenient to establish a reference scenario 
and to assess the various alternatives against this reference. 
For trigeneration systems, this can be carried out by 
introducing the TCO2ER indicator [18][19], expressing the 
relative reduction of the mass of carbon dioxide due to the 
use of a trigeneration system to displace the energy 
production needed to serve a certain energy output in the 
combined production of multiple energy vectors. From the 
conceptual framework used in cogeneration system analysis, 
the SP of electricity and heat comes from classical and 
standardized references (power generation system and 
boilers). It is however less immediate to identify the 
reference technology for SP of cooling. The authors in [9] 
introduced the assumption that the baseline technology 
reference for cooling power generation is an electric chiller, 
in turn supplied by the electrical network. Under this 
assumption, the TCO2ER indicator is expressed as

(5) 
The expression (5) applies to a general trigeneration plant 
with Fz as the energy fuel input and electricity Wz, heat Qz, 
and cooling energy Rz as the threefold useful energy output. 
The subscript z points out net input-output entries for the 
overall plant. Setting Rz = 0 in (5) leads to cogeneration 
assessment as a sub-case. In terms of emission mass, 
SP
mF
 is 
the CO2 mass emitted by combustion of the fuel thermal 
input FSP in order to produce the same amount of 
trigenerated energy in SP, while 
F
m  is the CO2 mass emitted 
by combustion of the CCHP fuel thermal input. The model 
(5) can also be extended to entail the presence of distribution 
networks; in this case, the output entries are considered net 
of the distribution and parasitic losses. In terms of baseline 
references, the specific emissions
SP
W
 and 
SP
Q
 represent the 
equivalent emission factors for SP, while 
F
  refers to the 
CCHP fuel thermal input. Emissions from cooling generation 
are assessed through the reference electricity emissions, and 
considering an electric chiller with cooling-to-electricity 
efficiency equal to COPSP. The emission factors and the 
chiller efficiency for SP are evaluated as conventional 
values. As such, they may be related to the underlying 
assumptions of the study, as illustrated in Section IV. 
Positive 
TCO2ER 
values 
represent 
the 
existing 
convenience 
of 
adopting 
trigeneration 
to 
displace 
conventional energy generation in the supply of the 
corresponding energy demands. The maximum positive 
value of TCO2ER is unity (or 100%), ideally representing 
the adoption of a trigeneration system supplied by carbon 
dioxide-free fuel. Negative TCO2ER values (not limited in 
amplitude) indicate that introducing trigeneration to displace 
SP is not convenient. 
B. Specific 
Energy 
System 
Model 
for 
CHP-WAC 
Trigeneration and Heat Network 
A more specific formulation of the expression (5) is 
derived here for the CHP-DHN-WAC energy system under 
analysis. In this respect, let us consider the plant model in 
Figure 1, in which all the equipment and the relevant 
efficiencies are schematized as black-boxes. All the energy 
produced is assumed to be utilized. More specifically, the 
cogenerated electricity Wy coincides, net of the pumping 
losses for heat distribution, with the overall trigenerated 
electricity Wz, and goes to supply the local user or is injected 
into a local microgrid or the distribution network. The 
cogenerated heat Qy, net of heat distribution losses, splits 
into two components, namely, Qz corresponding to the net 
trigenerated heat output for direct thermal purposes (for 
instance, domestic hot water generation and space heating), 
and the other one to fire a WAC for generating the 
trigenerated cooling energy Rz. The “splitting variable” is 
indicated as αR, and corresponds to the relative amount of 
cogenerated heat going to feed the WAC.

The TCO2ER model in (10) yields an analytical

trigeneration as a function of the plant component and 
network-related efficiencies, the splitting factor, and the 
emission factors for the input fuel and the SP references. 
Therefore, it is possible to run various analyses to highlight 
the role played by the specific entries involved in the study, 
as shown in the following section. 
IV. 
NUMERICAL APPLICATIONS 
A. Energy System Description 
Different equipment typologies available for small-scale 
applications are considered, namely, an SE coupled to an 
adsorption chiller, and a MT and two ICE coupled to a 
single-effect absorption chiller. The average performance 
characteristics (assumed to be constant and equal to nominal 
values, for the sake of simplicity) and typical capacities for 
the equipment analysed are shown in Table I. In addition, 
also average energy penalties due to heat networks are 
considered, with heat losses increasing with the CHP 
typology and size, assuming that larger heat networks are 
subsequently needed. The pumping electrical parasitic losses 
are instead assumed equal to 1% in all cases. For SE, no 
DHN connection is considered. All CHP systems are natural 
gas-fuelled.  
The TCO2ER indicator is plotted in Figure 2 assuming 
R
  as the independent variable. Two cases are analysed: 
 Case 1): The SP emission factor for electricity refer to 
average emissions in UK (
SP
W
= 430 g/kWhe) [3], while 
the heat-related emission factor is calculated assuming 
average boilers with efficiency 
SP
Q
 = 0.8, fed on natural 
gas, thus obtaining 
SP
Q
= 
F
 /
SP
Q
 = 250; finally, for the 
reference chiller COPSP = 3; the results are shown in 
Figure 2a. 
 Case 2): peak (“marginal plant”) emissions for the UK 
power system (570 g/kWhe) [3] are considered, also 
introducing lower (with respect to case 1) average 
efficiency values for boilers (0.7) and chillers (2.5); the 
results are reported in Figure 2b.

B. Discussion and Comments on the Numerical Results 
The analysis presented has been carried out by using only 
the parameters of the CCHP systems and of the SP 
equivalents, with no need to specify the amount of 
electricity, heat and cooling involved. The rationale of this 
procedure is that the emissions reduction depends only on 
the contribution of the trigeneration systems in efficiently 
displacing SP of the various energy vectors needed. In the 
energy system, the possible excess of demand of any energy 
vector is covered by external supply coming from the 
additional components in place (that is, the electricity 
14

distribution grid for electricity, boilers for heat and electric 
chiller for cooling; these components are not explicitly 
shown in Figure 1), whose characteristics are the same as the 
ones assumed for the corresponding separate production 
equivalents. The analysis based on the TCO2ER indicator 
then refers to the effectiveness of displacing part of the SP 
with trigeneration, for the same amount of the energy 
demand supplied through the trigeneration chain shown in 
Figure 1. For instance, when R = 0 there is no cooling 
demand supplied through the trigeneration chain, meaning 
that any cooling demand is covered by electric chillers with 
parameter COPSP supplied by the electrical network with 
equivalent emission factor 
SP
W
. Likewise, for R = 1 there is 
no trigenerated heat, and the entire heat demand is 
conventionally covered by boilers with equivalent emission 
factor 
SP
Q
. The amounts of energy not provided by the 
trigeneration system are then excluded from the analysis. 
From Figure 2, when operating in electricity and heat 
cogeneration mode (R = 0), all the technologies considered 
bring CO2 emission reduction with respect to the base case 
references, increasing with the electrical efficiency (and 
size). The emission reduction potential for CCHP systems 
decreases with increasing R. The cooling production 
through thermal power in a WAC, in fact, although from 
wasted heat, is energetically inefficient compared with a 
relatively higher-efficiency reference electric chiller. Thus, it 
is more environment-effective to cogenerate heat and 
electricity (R = 0) than cogenerating cooling and electricity 
(R = 1). In particular, considering average UK emission 
intensities (Figure 2a), the emission reduction becomes 
negative beyond a certain R, whose values increases with 
the CHP electrical efficiency (and size). More specifically, 
an SE coupled to an adsorption chiller proves to be 
ineffective in terms of CO2 emission reduction already for R 
above 0.2. The environmental performance is instead much 
better if the CCHP systems are compared to peak UK 
emissions (Figure 2b: for the various technologies, the 
emission reduction almost doubles for R = 0 and even 
triplicates for R = 1 with respect to the average baseline 
reference. In this case, the MT and the two ICE, coupled to 
absorption chillers, could bring emission reductions of the 
order of 20% to 40% in the whole range of R, while the SE 
would bring benefits for R < 0.75. 
The environmental evaluation of CCHP systems is 
strongly affected by the selection of the reference scenario. 
What rationale is more correct to adopt in terms of baseline 
reference may be policy matter. In particular, it is possible to 
argue that DG is likely to displace marginal plant operation 
[3], since renewables and nuclear plants are usually operated 
with the flattest possible profile. In addition, in a deregulated 
environment it is often tough to figure out what plants are 
being offset, with older coal plants that may be preferred to 
newer gas plants on the basis of economic reasons. In any 
case, marginal power plants are the most likely to be 
displaced by CCHP systems producing cooling power in the 
summer peak hours. In addition, the actual efficiency of 
boilers may be much less that the rated one, above all in the 
summertime, as assumed when drawing the picture in Figure 
2b. On the other hand, an average generation mix reflects, 
somehow, the more decarbonised future UK and several 
European countries are committed to. However, in the next 
years also CCHP efficiencies are expected to improve, so 
that again the overall emission reduction resulted from 
distributed trigeneration could be of the order of magnitude 
of the ones obtained for marginal plant operation. 
In order to highlight the effectiveness of CCHP 
introduction in various countries, a further analysis has been 
made by considering the potential emission reductions an 
ICE2 (the technology leading to the highest CO2 emission 
reduction among the ones tested above) could bring in 
different jurisdictions or national contexts, considering the 
emission factors referring to average specific emissions. For 
this analysis the TCO2ER equation (10) has been used by 
changing the value of average specific emissions 
SP
W
 and 
maintaining the same values for 
SP
Q
and COPSP. In addition 
to the UK case already shown (with 
SP
W
= 430 g/kWhe), the 
values considered, taken from [19][22], refer to Norway 
(
SP
W
= 3 g/kWhe), France (
SP
W
= 78 g/kWhe), the former 
EU15 (
SP
W
= 362 g/kWhe), and Italy (
SP
W
= 525 g/kWhe). 
Figure 3 shows the relevant results.  
It is conceptually evident that trigeneration can be more 
effective in jurisdictions with higher electricity-related 
specific emissions. However, TCO2ER analysis provides 
clear emission reduction quantification in the various 
contexts. The application of the same technology (ICE2) 
with the purpose of reducing CO2 appears to be effective in 
Italy and UK for every usage (i.e., for any value of R), 
while it would never be effective in Norway or France. The 
results for EU15 are of course of an intermediate nature. 
However, EU15 specific emissions are obtained by 
averaging out values referring to very different jurisdictions. 
The use of an overall value masks the possible benefits in 
jurisdictions with prevailing fossil fuels, as well as the total 
inadequacy of putting natural gas-supplied trigeneration 
systems in other jurisdictions with almost CO2 emission-free 
electricity production. This confirms how making global 
averages in very heterogeneous contexts can lead to results 
that are not useful for any of the individual communities.

FINAL REMARKS AND FUTURE WORKS 
In the development of energy systems with enhanced 
energy efficiency and environmental performance, the 
exploitation of distributed multi-generation systems based on 
combined generation of multiple energy vectors is a 
particularly significant and promising option. 
This paper has introduced a general analytical model 
based on black-box representations for CO2 emission 
reduction assessment from distributed trigeneration (as well 
as cogeneration) systems, in case coupled to heat networks. 
Dedicated assessment of the carbon dioxide reductions that 
can be obtained from the deployment of such trigeneration 
systems has been performed by comparing the trigeneration 
systems outcomes that satisfy the energy demand of different 
energy vectors with the separate production baseline 
references to supply the same demand of the corresponding 
energy vectors. In particular, the numerical analyses have 
been focused on small-scale energy systems currently 
available in the market.  
The results show that consistent benefits can be obtained 
when the reference case points to marginal generation in UK, 
that is, the one most likely to be displaced by DG systems. 
Electrical efficiency, which is also a function of the plant 
size, plays a key role in the overall assessment, while the 
losses due to heat network affect marginally the results. 
Hence, micro-CHP Stirling engines prove to be the least 
effective, mainly due to their low electrical efficiency. The 
emission reduction performance is also a function of the 
quota of cogenerated heat feeding the chillers. With the 
cooling equipment considered here, in general the emission 
reduction decreases if the cogenerated heat firing the chiller 
increases. Although trigeneration allows for potential 
recovery of otherwise wasted heat, negative emission 
reduction (i.e., emission increase) could arise in certain 
operation points, also depending on the baseline reference. 
This assessment should be carried out at the planning stage, 
in order to avoid the setup of environmentally inefficient 
solutions. 
The analysis has then been extended to show that the 
same trigeneration technology can be effective in certain 
jurisdictions characterized by fossil fuels in the energy mix 
used to supply the national electricity generation system, 
while it may exhibit total inadequacy of being adopted in 
other jurisdictions in which fossil fuels are almost unused. 
The analyses presented here are meant to be a 
preliminary assessment of the potential emission reduction 
from distributed multi-generation systems. In particular, 
further analyses are in progress, including more detailed 
models of heat networks, and based on time-domain 
simulations that take into account load variations and actual 
operating conditions for all the equipment. In addition, the 
environmental benefits of different distributed energy 
solutions are to be assessed against their cost effectiveness 
and their impact on the electrical network. This may also 
require sensitivity studies on the underlying economic 
assumptions, such as the fuel and electricity rates, as well as 
analysing the possibility of operating CCHP systems within 
microgrids.
