Abstract—Technology is influencing education, blurring the 
boundaries of delivery modes. A combination between online 
and traditional teaching style, the hybrid/blended course, may 
present a solution with many benefits. This paper provides 
definitions of the different delivery approaches, and then 
evaluates four years of data from a course that has been 
converted from traditional face-to-face delivery, to a hybrid 
system. It is determined that the revised course, in hybrid 
delivery mode, is at least as good, if not better, than it 
previously was.

BACKGROUND 
The Gartner Group Research Institute in the United States 
anticipated that the world’s e-Learning sales would grow 
14.5% annually from 2006 to 2011 [1]. Over a similar 
timescale, government policies in the UK also indicated that 
the effective use of technology-assisted student-focused 
learning is essential for the future of higher education [2]-
[5]. In a review of higher education and the future role of the 
university, Ernst & Young [6] have suggested that “… 
campuses will remain, but digital technologies will 
transform the way education is delivered and accessed, and 
the way ‘value’ is created by higher education providers, 
public and private alike.” (p. 4). 
Greater, and smarter, use of technology in teaching is also 
widely seen as a promising way of controlling costs [7]. 
When compared to other service industries, higher education 
stands out as being particularly affected by what has been 
described as the ‘‘cost disease’’[8]. Universities have large 
costs for infrastructure and labour, with reliance on 
expensive face-to-face provision. The urgent need to boost 
university productivity has been noted by many [9]-[11].  
Lectures are accepted as being a very inexpensive way of 
presenting new ideas and concepts to students. Additionally, 
lecturing has been described as an ineffective tool for 
promoting theoretical understanding [12], as it rarely 
stimulates student thinking beyond the short-term memory 
[13]14]. The passive role assumed by students in lectures is 
too focused on the subject being delivered, rather than the 
learners and their individual needs [15]. But, teaching the 
same content can be made more interesting, and students can 
become active, independent learners, if different delivery 
methods are used [16].  
Implemented proficiently, online or hybrid/blended 
provision has the capacity to lower costs and at least sustain, 
if not boost student outcomes [17]-[19]. Hybrid/Blended 
learning can ease some of the economic strain on students, 
as it reduces commuting expenses and allows for a flexible 
timetable that may better accommodate the students’ 
personal circumstances [20]. Cost simulations, although 
speculative, have indicated that adopting hybrid models of 
instruction in large introductory courses has the potential to 
reduce costs quite substantially [7]. 
This paper begins in Section 2 by introducing definitions 
of the terms in use for educational delivery. The 
“Fundamentals of the Internet and the World Wide Web” 
(CSCI 1150) course is then described in Section 3. The 
methodology for data collection is outlined in Section 4, 
with Section 5 exploring the evaluation of said data in terms 
of student outcomes and attrition rates. The relationship 
between 
assessment 
weighting 
and 
online 
student 
interactions in discussion forums is also measured. Section 6 
identifies the limitations of this study, with Section 7 
concluding that CSCI 1150, in hybrid delivery mode, 
continues to provide as good, if not better provision, than the 
previous traditional face-to-face delivery method.  
 
DEFINING HYBRID/BLENDED LEARNING 
The boundaries of educational modes are blurring due to 
the introduction of technology [21]. A wide range of terms 
are in use to describe ways in which students may engage 
with their studies, including on-campus, face-to-face, off-
campus, open education, distance education, external study, 
online education, e-Learning, flexible learning, blended 
learning and hybrid. There is limited consensus on the 
meanings of these terms [22][23] resulting in confusion for 
academics, administrators and students.  
For each method of engagement, there are distinct 
attributes that help define them, for example, it is suggested 
that an on-campus mode relates to “courses that deliver 
material face-to-face and students interact with instructors 
face-to-face” [24], whilst distance learning can be described 
as “the various forms of study at all levels which are not 
under the continuous, immediate supervision of instructors 
collocated with their students in the same physical location 
but which, nevertheless, benefit from the planning and 
guidance of a supporting organization” (p.4) [23].  
The terms Blended learning and Hybrid learning are 
being used interchangeably with increasing frequency in 
academic writing, but again, there is no consensus on their 
48

meaning [25]. In their most basic form, Hybrid is defined as 
being of “mixed character; composed of different elements” 
[26], whilst Blended is “an unobtrusive or harmonious part 
of a greater whole” [27]. In an educational context, a 
Hybrid/Blended course does not necessarily use a computer 
and the Internet, but it is increasingly common for this to be 
the case. 
Further defining these approaches, but mixing the two 
terms, Blended learning has been described as a hybrid 
instructional approach combining aspects of e-learning and a 
traditional classroom environment [28]. An alternative 
description, favoured by the authors, is “courses that deliver 
material both face-to-face and online … [where] … students 
interact with instructors both online and face-to-face” 
(p.142) [24]. Research shows that this combination may 
promote learner-centred and active learning [29], however it 
has been suggested that this hybrid mixture of off-campus 
and on-campus activities is difficult to explain to prospective 
students [30]. 
A potential solution to the confusion is to define courses 
specifically by their construction. The public University 
System of Georgia (USG) [31] defines the following: 
• 
Fully online: All or nearly all the class sessions are 
delivered via technology (96% to 100% online).  
• 
Partially online: Technology is used to deliver more 
than 50% of class sessions (51% to 95% online).  
• 
Hybrid: Technology is used to deliver at least one class 
session up to 50% of class sessions.  
• 
Campus/on-site: No 
class 
sessions 
are 
replaced 
by online technology. 
The relationship between traditional, online, and hybrid 
courses, is displayed in Figure 1.  
 
COURSE DESIGN 
The CSCI 1150 course had traditionally been taught face-
to-face, in both spring and fall semesters. In 2011, a Desire-
to-Learn (D2L) component was developed, (a tool the 
students have previous experience of), where the content 
was made available online, with PDF ‘slides’ that closely 
followed the associated textbook. Students were also 
provided with access to interaction tools (e.g., e-mail, chat, 
discussion forums) as well as a set of assessment tools (e.g., 
quizzes, assignments and exams).  
The course content has been refined in subsequent years 
(2012-2014) to include additional required reading material, 
as well as a better-defined set of discussion forums, (one per 
textbook chapter) where students are encouraged to interact 
during the semester. 
This refinement aims to provide fresh stimuli to the 
course, in order to promote students’ learning through 
questioning, investigating, challenging, seeking feedback, 
and learning through interactions with peers and tutors [32]. 
Technologies such as discussion forums can provide the 
opportunity for learners to be active in creating their own 
knowledge and understanding by allowing them to create, 
own, retrieve and exchange information within them [33]. 
The face-to-face sessions are then used to explore the course 
content, and the online interactions, in order to further 
develop the students’ understanding. This overall course 
design may be seen as consistent with the “flipped 
classroom” [34], and is presented in a 50:50 ratio, causing it 
to be described as Hybrid delivery under the University 
System of Georgia [31]. 
From spring 2012, the course assessment has also been 
completed online, with each element assigned a proportion 
of the overall grade: Assignments – 40%; Quizzes – 10%; 
Midterm exam – 25%; Final exam – 25%. This was then 
further supplemented from fall 2013, with the online forum 
interactions being rewarded 2%, of the weighting, reducing 
the Midterm and Final exams to 24% each. The online 
interaction based on Discussion Forums weighting has 
subsequently been increased to 10% in spring 2014, causing 
the Midterm and Final exams to be reduced to 20% each.

advantages to both instructor and student. It is possible to 
automate the process of quiz/exam delivery as well as 
grading, subsequently freeing significant instructor time.  
The online quizzes for the hybrid course have 10 
questions each, which are automatically generated from a 
database of 3000+ questions, all of which have the same 
difficulty level. The quizzes are automatically graded, 
immediately after the deadline, providing students with 
instant access to both the grade and the correct solutions. 
Students can then use this information to identify where they 
went wrong, which can then be discussed with the instructor. 
The drawback in automating the process of delivery and 
grading come from the fact that some type of problems, such 
as those requiring essay-type answers, are difficult to 
automate, as they require manual grading for optimum 
accuracy and to provide personalized feedback. For this 
reason, the manually graded assessment has greater 
weighting in the overall final grade.   
B. Deadlines and Penalties 
     Each assessment component has strict completion 
deadlines. Assignments have to be completed in 3 weeks, 
with a deadline enforced through the D2L submission 
system. Late submission was not accepted, and failure to 
submit an assignment would almost certainly result in 
dropping a grade, as the assignment weight was 10% of the 
final outcome.  
For the Quizzes, each weighted at only 1% of the final 
grade, there is a 2-3 week timeframe during which each can 
be taken, offering the students flexibility in their learning. 
As previously identified, the Midterm and Final exams 
were also given online, with a 12-hour window where they 
are ‘live’ and can be taken. Each exam consists of 10 
problems, with 80% of the responses being manually graded. 
Each exam is weighted at 20%, with no late submissions 
permitted. 
The final, newest element of assessment, which is based 
on the interactions in the discussion forums, has a one-
month timeframe where posting is allowed to a particular 
forum. After the expiration time the students can still read, 
but not post, to the specific forum, providing a continuous 
source of information. The discussion forum contributions 
are weighted at 10% of the final grade, with contributions 
evaluated subjectively by the instructor; being measured 
both quantitatively and qualitatively. 
C. Interaction  
Two types of written discussions are frequently used in a 
hybrid course: synchronous and asynchronous. Whereas 
synchronous discussion requires participants to log in at a 
predetermined time and simultaneously join the discussion, 
asynchronous activities allows users to organize, read, and 
post messages at their own pace, as dictated by their 
preferred schedule.  
Where online/hybrid course designers have opted for the 
use of discussion forums, they play an important role, often 
making up the major part of the students’ activities and 
providing evidence of attendance, class participation, and 
sometimes assessment [35]-[38]. The delayed element to 
asynchronous communication, can allow participants more 
time to consider their responses, promoting deeper 
consideration and reflection of the subject [39][40]. Despite 
this, it has also been argued that scholarly thinking regarding 
assessment of online discussion has not kept pace with the 
growing popularity of such practices [41]. 
The asynchronous interactions in CSCI 1150 employ e-
Mail, a News system, and Discussion Forums, the latter 
consisting of one primary thread per textbook chapter. The 
News system is an efficient tool for the instructor to provide 
students with updates about the course, however it is a 
unidirectional communication tool - from instructor to 
students.  
Online synchronous interaction was implemented in 
CSCI 1150 through a Chat channel. It has been observed 
that the channel is mainly used immediately prior to the 
Midterm and Final exam period, serving as an emergency 
notification tool for the student if/when something goes 
wrong with the online exam session.  
The other synchronous interaction occurred in the 
traditional in-class face-to-face meetings. As part of the 
Hybrid course, students meet with their instructor once a 
week, for a 75-minute session, where they can discuss and 
ask/answer questions. Attendance is not mandatory and it 
has been observed that by the middle of the semester an 
average of 60% of the students attend these sessions.  
Online 
interaction 
was 
stimulated 
through 
the 
relationship between this activity and the assessment. Ten 
per cent of the final grade is awarded for the discussion 
forum posts, with each student being expected to provide at 
least three posts per thread, each of 200 words or more, as 
well as responding to classmates’ questions. At the end of 
the semester, the student with the highest number of quality 
posts receives a further 10% towards their final grade; the 
other students receive lower additional percentages, 
representative of their contributions. 
 
METHODOLOGY 
The CSCI 1150 course, a service course at Armstrong 
State University, Georgia, USA was observed over a period 
of 4 years, through seven semesters (Spring and Fall, 2011 
to 2014). The course was delivered by traditional face-to-
face methods in 2011, and was then converted to Hybrid 
delivery for 2012-14. There is no entry requirement for the 
course. 
The average class size was 25, and the students included 
in the data collection ranged from 19 to 42 years of age, with 
a female to male ratio of 1.7 to 1. The analysis of the 
experimental data is straightforward. The outcomes for 
students previously undertaking the course in the traditional 
format are compared to the outcomes for students 
undertaking the hybrid formats. 
The data collected consists of the students’ final grades, 
failure rates and withdrawal rates. To further evaluate the 
hybrid delivery method, the students’ asynchronous

interactions are also investigated. The rate and volume of 
posts in the online forum are analysed in consideration of the 
changes in the course structure. 
 
COURSE EVALUATION 
The final outcomes for the students are displayed in 
Figure 2, and these show no significant difference between 
the traditional course that was delivered in 2011, and the 
subsequent hybrid delivery, with the course mean grade 
fluctuating between B and C (except for the anomalous D 
mean for the Spring 2011 Section 1). There is, though, some 
suggestion, albeit slight, that the course outcomes may be 
improving, with a median of grade B appearing more 
regularly in the recent hybrid courses (Table 1); but whether 
this is due to the delivery method, or some external factor, 
cannot be determined.  
The goal of a blended/hybrid learning experience is “to 
provide a mix of both on-line and face-to-face experiences 
which support each other in achieving desired learning 
outcomes” [42], and whilst Universities are already 
experimenting with this style of learning, “the term is still 
relatively new therefore leaving many to question how the 
mixing of online and mobile learning with face-to-face 
interaction will actually improve student experience now 
and in the long term” [43]. 
However, it has been demonstrated that traditionally 
delivered, subject-intense courses can be converted to a 
‘blended/hybrid’ delivery approach with “as good, if not 
better outcomes”, if they are well-designed with high quality 
content and regular interaction [44]. Students in the hybrid 
format pay no “price” for this mode of instruction in terms 
of exam scores, and overall performance [7]. 
In other sectors of the economy, the use of technology has 
increased productivity, measured as outputs divided by 
inputs, and has even often increased output.  Bowen at al [7] 
showed that a hybrid-learning system did not increase 
outputs (student learning) but could potentially increase 
productivity by using fewer inputs. 
When considering the course attrition rates, it is important 
to note that students are allowed to withdraw without 
penalty before an identified deadline – usually just after the 
Midterm exam. This allows failing students to leave with a 
‘clean record’, meaning they can retake the course in the 
future, should they wish to. Despite this, there is positive

indication that attrition rates are reducing, as illustrated in 
Figure 3. However this is unlikely to improve significantly 
under the current withdrawal policy. 
     As previously identified, asynchronous interactions 
through e-mail are primarily exchanged around (1-2 days, 
before and after) a major deadline for an assignment or 
exam. For example  76.5 % of the e-mails received for 
sections 1 and 2 during Spring 2014, were specifically 
targeted on questions around major assessment components. 
Students also tend to interact little amongst themselves using 
the e-mail system, with only 36% of the e-mails sent being 
student to student communications.   
For the online interactions measured only through the 
Discussion Forums (from Fall 2012 to Spring 2014), a 
quantitative analysis of the forum contributions (number of 
authored posts and number of read posts) reveals, 
unsurprisingly, that there is a direct dependency between the 
grading weight of the online interaction and the number of 
posts in the forum. Evidence shows that the higher the 
assessment grade percentage, the higher volume (and 
quality, in the instructor’s opinion) of forum posts made by 
the students, as shown in Figure 4.  
 
LIMITATIONS 
This is a small-scale study and the data was drawn from a 
specific course, with a limited number of participants. The 
study may have been influenced by factors specific to the 
student groups, which are not immediately evident from the 
findings. Also, experiences external to the course content 
and delivery may have contributed to student outcomes and 
opinions.  
 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, Hybrid/Blended learning is discussed in the 
context of the existing terminology. The design and main 
components of a course that was morphed from a traditional 
format to a hybrid one, is then described.  
The course analysis and evaluation focuses on the

outcomes for students that undertook the course in the 
traditional 
format, 
and 
the 
outcomes 
for 
students 
undertaking the revised hybrid formats. It is shown that 
students in the hybrid format pay no “price” for this mode of 
instruction in terms of pass rates, exam scores, or 
performance. Moreover, they can be motivated to interact 
online with slight adjustments in the grading policy, which 
promotes participation, and improves students’ computer 
skills. 
The evidence supports the hypothesis that well-designed 
interactive hybrid systems in higher education, have the 
potential to achieve at least equivalent educational outcomes 
as traditional courses, while opening up the possibility of 
freeing up significant resources that could be redeployed 
more productively. This alone is cause for this style of 
delivery to be recommended. 
The course structure will continue to be reviewed, in 
consideration of student outcomes, to promote higher final 
outcomes.
