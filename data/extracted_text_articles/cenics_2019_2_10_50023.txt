Abstract—In this paper, we present a 60 GHz Low-Noise Ampli-
ﬁer (LNA) to improve the performance of multi-band detection
systems. The LNA is designed in 70 nm GaAs metamorphic High
Electron Mobility Transistor (m-HEMT) technology and occupies
an area of 1.47 x 1.0 mm2. The inductive degeneration technique
is used for a suitable trade-off between gain and noise. The three-
stage LNA achieves a gain of 14.3 dB and a noise factor of 2.1 dB
at 60.2 GHz, while consuming 13.5 mW. The simulated non-linear
characteristics show an IP1dB (Input 1 dB compression Point)
of -9.6 dBm and an IIP3 (Input third-order Intercept Point) of
-4.8 dBm.
Keywords–LNA; 60 GHz; GaAs m-HEMT; Millimeter wave
technology; Multi-band detection system.

INTRODUCTION
Advances in integrated circuit technologies are generating
great interest in the evolution of standards in millimeter-
wave bands. The availability of unlicensed bandwidth around
60 GHz in several regions of the world (57-66 GHz in
Europe) is a real opportunity for new systems development
and frequency harmonisation. Advances in SiGe [1] [2] and
III-V [3]- [5] technologies nowadays allow the production of
devices and systems for a variety of applications in millimeter-
wave bands. These opportunities create a need for increasingly
high-performance devices. In this way, this work adresses the
design of a wideband ampliﬁer, wich has low-noise, low power
consumption and is small in size in order to improve the
performance of detection systems.
This study is part of the development of an Ultra-WideBand
(UWB) millimeter-wave detection system for short-range ap-
plications. We consider the monostatic radar context, Figure 1,
with a cylindrical metallic target of radius r and height h (r; h).
The detection system is schematized by a transceiver (TX-RX)
using the same antenna. The incidence angle θ is determined
by the orientation of the target with respect to the antenna
boresight.

This paper proposes the design of a low-noise ampliﬁer
with the 70 nm GaAs m-HEMT technology from OMMIC. It
is structured as follows: Section II presents the principle of
detection. Section III presents the sizing of the system and
LNA speciﬁcations. Choice and technology description are
presented in Section IV. Then, the design of the circuit is
detailed in Section V. In Section VI, we present the results
of the post-layout electromagnetic simulations in comparison
with those in the literature before concluding in Section VII.
II.
PRINCIPLE OF DETECTION
The angular dependence of the Radar Cross Section (RCS)
of objects often results in a limitation of the detection range
when moving away from the normal incidence. To overcome
this limitation, we use frequency diversity [6]. The proposed
detection principle is then based on the impulse technique,
using a multi-band approach [7] [8], to improve detection
coverage, particularly the continuity of detection according to
the target orientation angle θ. Frequencies around 60 GHz
were chosen for spectrum availability, but also for short
wavelengths (5 mm at 60 GHz) to detect small objects (< 10
cm). The architecture associated with the detection principle
is shown in Figure 2 for a dual-band system at 57.8 GHz
and 62.8 GHz. In the transmitter, Differential Structure Power
Ampliﬁers (DSPAs) whose operation is based on the even
mode rejection are used. DSPA1 provides both signal division

performance. The received signals are selected by a ﬁlter bank
identical to the one in transmission before being subjected
to the detection and decision process. More details of the
architecture operation are given in [8]. This architecture can be
applied in a more general case with N bands. The processing
of the received signals can be done by different techniques,
such as: selection combining, cumulative detection [8], or non-
coherent integration [9].
III.
SYSTEM SIZING AND LNA SPECIFICATIONS
The sizing of the system is based on the monostatic radar
equation expressing the maximum detection range (Rmax) as
a function of the minimum detectable power Smin [10]:
R4
max = PtG2λ2σ
(4π)3 Smin
(1)
where Pt is the transmitted power, G is the antenna gain, λ
the operating wavelength and σ the RCS of the target.
Since Smin is related to the thermal noise power of
the receiver and the minimum Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
required to detect a target, the radar equation (1) can be written
in the form:
R4
max =
PtG2λ2σ
(4π)3 · kT∆f · F · SNRr
(2)
where k is the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature, ∆f the
receiver bandwidth, F its noise factor and SNRr the required
SNR at the output of the receiver to ensure detection.
In the equation (2), the transmitted power and the antenna
gain are determined by standardization. The wavelength λ is
chosen according to the application and the dimensions of the
targets to be detected. The receiver bandwidth ∆f is deﬁned
by the bandwidth of the front-end ﬁlter which will set the range
resolution ∆R of the system (∆R = c/2∆f). The SNRr is
deﬁned by the desired performance in terms of detection and
false alarm probabilities. The proposed detection principle is
based on the frequency and angle variations of the RCS. Thus,
the receiver noise factor F is the only adjustable parameter to
maximize system performance. Due to the position of the LNA
in the receiver architecture, shown in Figure 2, the impact of
its noise factor is more signiﬁcant over that of the total RF
chain according to the Friis equation:
F = F1 + F2 − 1
G1
+ F3 − 1
G1G2
+ ... +
Fn − 1
G1G2...Gn−1
(3)
where Fi and Gi are the noise factor and the power gain,
respectively, of the i-th stage, and n is the number of stages.
By setting the objective of detecting a cylindrical target (r =
0.6 cm; h = 5.4 cm), up to 2 m at normal incidence, we
will determine the characteristics of the receiver stage and in
particular those of the LNA. For this purpose, we consider a
system with four bands in 57-66 GHz, distributed around the
frequencies 57.8 GHz, 60.2 GHz, 62.8 GHz and 65.2 GHz.
The output power of each channel of the DSPA2 is set at
15 dBm (taking into account frequency bands standardization)
and the gain of the antennas at 12 dBi (which can be achieved
with 4 patches of 6 dBi each). The bandwidth of each band is
1.6 GHz and the SNRr depends on the detection technique
used. Filter losses are set at 3.5 dB [11]. For a conventional
single-band conﬁguration, the SNRr to ensure the detection
of a nonﬂuctuating target with a detection probability of 90%
and a false alarm probability of 10−6 is 13.2 dB [10]. In the
case of a non-coherent integration of 4 pulses in 4 sufﬁciently
spaced frequency bands, the SNRr is only 8.3 dB for the
same detection and false alarm probabilities. Based on this
case of non-coherent integration, using (2), we established the
technical speciﬁcations of the LNA given in Table I, to ensure
the targeted detection.

CHOICE AND DESCRIPTION OF THE TECHNOLOGY
To realize the LNA, we have two design technologies:
SG13S from IHP (Innovations for High Performance) Micro-
electronics [12] and D007IH from OMMIC [13]. The choice
of technology was ﬁrst based on a study of passive elements.
This revealed that SG13S is better suited for highly integrable
components (small capacitors and resistors). On the other
hand, it has very high losses (≈ 0.7 dB/mm @ 60 GHz)
for low-noise applications. Unlike SG13S, the D007IH has
the advantage of lower losses (≈ 0.22 dB/mm @ 60 GHz)
and more integrable inductors in terms of shape. For example,
Figure 3 shows simulation results of grounded transmission
lines of the same characteristic impedance of 75 Ω. It can be
seen that the D007IH has a quality factor (Q-factor) more than
5 times higher than that of the SG13S at 60 GHz for the same
inductance of 268 pH.

Figure 3. Comparison of grounded transmission lines
At high frequencies and especially at 60 GHz, the use of
transmission lines is often preferred, so the D007IH seems
more suitable for low noise applications. However, in mi-
crowaves, the overall performance of a circuit depends not
only on the passive elements, but also on the characteristics of
the transistors. Thus, the choice of technology must be based
on an analysis of the global circuit. For this purpose, we com-
pared single-stage ampliﬁers designed with both technologies,
Table II. This comparison clearly shows that the m-HEMT is

the only one of the three transistor models that can meet the
technical speciﬁcations of the LNA, particularly in terms of
noise. To satisfy the gain performance, the use of a multi-
stage structure will be necessary. In addition, with regard to
sizing, it appeared that the noise factor is more signiﬁcant over
the gain because its inﬂuence is much greater in the range of
the system. So, D007IH technology is chosen for the design
of the LNA.
D007IH is a 70 nm gate length GaAs technology providing
fT /fmax of 300 GHz/450 GHz. It offers a depletion transistor
m-HEMT with very high transconductance of gmmax = 1600
mS/mm, that can support a voltage VDSmax of 3 V and a max-
imum current IDSSmax of 400 mA/µm. This type of transistor
offers good performance in terms of noise, with a noise factor
of only 0.5 dB at 30 GHz, giving it a privilege for security
applications (millimeter-band imaging), telecommunications or
radars. The process of the technology consists of a 3.5 µm
metal in its underside, a 100 µm thick GaAs substrate above
which different metallization levels can be distinguished. The
most used metal layer for transmission lines realization is the
IN metal with a thickness of 1.25 µm. It is also possible to
associate this layer with a gold layer of the same thickness for
less losses.
V.
CIRCUIT DESIGN
The circuit is designed with Keysight Advanced Design
System (ADS). The LNA consists of a three-stage structure
using identical transistors. The size of the transistor is chosen
so as to ensure a better trade-off between gain and noise. A
parametric study allowed us to choose a transistor of 2 x 25
µm grid development. The optimal bias point then corresponds
to a voltage VDS = 1 V for an IDS current of about 4.1 mA.
Unconditional stability has been ensured both by inductive
degeneration of the source, but also by the use of a resistance
in the bias circuit. This resistance allows stability at low
frequency; its value must be chosen meticulously because
it inﬂuences the gain and noise [14]. The degeneration also
brings the circles of gain and noise closer together and thus
facilitates the input matching [15].
The ﬁrst two stages are almost identical and are matched
with a good trade-off between gain and noise. Matching of the
third stage is optimized in gain because its inﬂuence is less on
the noise factor of the whole structure (3). The LNA’s ﬁrst
stage schematic is presented in Figure 4.
The bias circuits are made with quarter-wave transmission
lines. They include GaAs implanted resistors (RD and RG) for
improving low frequency stability and by-pass capacitors (CD)
to short RF (Radio Frequency) leakage to the ground. The
degeneration of the transistor source is ensured by the shorted
transmission line TLS. The capacitor C1 and the transmission
lines TL1 and TL2 form the input matching network. TL1 is
an open line smaller than λ/4 and therefore acts as a parallel
capacitor. C2, TL3 and C3 form the inter-stage matching and
DC (Direct Current) isolation between stages 1 and 2. The
same topology is used between stages 2 and 3. The output
matching of the LNA is performed by a simple L-C series
topology. The output inductor is achieved by a transmission
line whose dimensions are optimized for a better gain, without
degrading the noise factor, while respecting the design rules.

POST-LAYOUT SIMULATIONS RESULTS
The layout of the LNA is shown in Figure 5 and it includes
RF and DC pads. All transmission lines are made with the
same IN metal layer. Ground connections are made using vias
holes. The size of the circuit is 1.47 x 1.0 mm2.
Figure 5. Layout of the LNA
For layout realization, small transmission lines have been
added to transistor accesses (gate and drain) to reduce the
coupling between components. The resistor in the drain bias
drops the voltage at the DC pad from 1.1 V to 1 V at the
transistor drain for each stage. Thus, the overall consumption
of the circuit is approximately 13.5 mW. Layout simulations
are done with Momentum Microwave. The layout was done
in two main steps. Initially, electromagnetic simulations were

carried out in a partial way, i.e., by considering each element
separately (p index). Then, in a second step, we simulated the
whole structure of the LNA (g index). The results obtained then
present differences related to the coupling phenomena between
the different elements of the LNA, which are not taken into
account in the partial simulations of these elements. These
couplings result in a more or less pronounced degradation
of the circuit’s performance. In our case, we were able to
distinguish the degradation of reﬂection coefﬁcients both at the
input S11 and output S22. Since then, we have re-optimized
the layout in order to minimize these degradations, but also
to improve its gain and noise performance, see Figure 6 and
Figure 7.

A ﬁnal optimization of the layout was done to reduce
the size of the circuit which was initially 1.29 x 1.56 mm2.
This allowed us to obtain the layout seen in Figure 5. The
optimized LNA thus offers unconditional stability over a wide
frequency range, see Figure 8. Post-layout simulations results
are presented in Figure 9. There is a gain of 14.3 dB and
a noise factor of 2.1 dB at 60.2 GHz. The reverse isolation
is about -34 dB at 60.2 GHz and the reﬂection coefﬁcients
S11 and S22 are less than -15 dB at 60.2 GHz. The 3 dB
bandwidth (for S11 < − 10 dB and S22 < − 10 dB) ranges
from 54 to 62.5 GHz with a ﬂuctuation of about 0.17 dB
in noise factor. The non-linear characteristics of the LNA are
shown in Figure 10 and Figure 11. The simulated input 1 dB
compression point of the LNA is IP1dB = −9.6 dBm, while
the input third order intercept point is IIP3 = −4.8 dBm.

The performance parameters of the designed LNA com-

Table III. Our LNA shows good performance, especially in
terms of noise factor, even if some of the results in the
Table III are based on measurements. With a moderate power
consumption compared to same type of technologies [4] [14]
or even the 40 nm CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide
Semiconductor) [16], it presents a good gain to meet the
targeted detection objectives. More gain can be achieved by
increasing the drain voltage of the output stage or adding a
fourth transistor. This would increase the power consumption
and a little more the noise factor. The non-linear characteristics
of the designed LNA are much better than those of the m-
HEMT and CMOS technologies presented in Table III. For

example, its IP1dB is -9.6 dBm, while it is less than -18 dBm
for [4] [17]- [19]. It is the same for input three order intercept
point (IIP3). The LNA occupies less space (1.47 x 1.0 mm2)
compared to the 50 and 100 nm GaAs m-HEMT technologies
which occupy 2.3 x 1.6 mm2 and 3.5 x 1.0 mm2, respectively.
The performances thus obtained satisfy the speciﬁcations
established in Table I, and allow, with the multi-band system,
to detect up to 2.3 m the considered target (metallic cylinder
of radius r = 0.6 cm and height h = 5.4 cm) at normal
incidence, with a non-coherent integration. This represents an
improvement of 30% in range compared to the conventional
single-band detection system. In addition, by referring to [8],
the overall detection coverage is also improved.

CONCLUSION
A 60 GHz LNA designed in 70 nm GaAs m-HEMT
technology was presented. The design was done with ADS
Keysight in D007IH technology from OMMIC. Inductive
degeneration of the source and inserting resistance in the bias
circuit was used to better scale the transistor with a good trade-
off between gain and noise, while ensuring unconditionnal
stability. Our design was compared to other recently published
milimeter-wave LNAs. Post-layout electromagnetic simulation
results with momentum microwave show good performance,
especially in terms of noise. With a noise factor of 2.1 dB at
60.2 GHz, our LNA is much better that those commonly found
in the state-of-the-art. For a moderate power consumption of
13.5 mW, which is relativeley low for III-V’s technologies,
it presents 14.3 dB of gain at 60.2 GHz. The reﬂection
coefﬁcients of the designed LNA are less than -10 dB in
54-68 GHz. The input power at 1 dB compression point is
IP1dB = −9.6 dBm and the input third order intercept point
is IIP3 = −4.8 dBm. The results of the designed LNA show
the potential of III-V’s technologies, especially the 70 nm
GaAs m-HEMT for very low noise applications, particularly
to improve the performance of detection systems.
