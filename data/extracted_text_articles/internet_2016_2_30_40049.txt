Abstract—These days, many people use a social networking
service (SNS). When we use SNSs, we carefully protect the privacy
of personal information: name, age, gender, address, birthday, etc.
However, we often reveal birthdays on SNS, not only ours but
also of others. Birthday information can threaten our privacy and
security when combined with other personal information. In this
study, we investigated tweets where birthdays were revealed to
other people. We collected 1,000 Japanese tweets including word
“tanjyobi (birthday)” and found about 30% of them were tweets
where birthdays were revealed to other people. Furthermore,
70% of tweets where birthdays were revealed to other people
were ones where receivers’ birthdays were revealed. We obtained
87% accuracy when we applied support vector machine (SVM)
machine learning techniques to classify tweets including word
“tanjyobi (birthday)” into ones revealing birthdays of senders,
receivers, and others. However, the recall rate of tweets where
senders’ birthdays were revealed was only 20%.

INTRODUCTION
These days, many people use a social networking service
(SNS). These users, especially young users, tend to disclose
personal information on their SNS proﬁles seemingly without
much concern for the potential privacy risks. They seem
to believe the beneﬁts of disclosing personal information in
order to use SNSs as greater than the potential privacy risks.
Furthermore, they often reveal personal information on SNSs,
not only theirs but also of others. For example, (exp 1) is a
comment on a Facebook user proﬁle.
(exp 1) I hope you had an amazing birthdayyy!
This comment was time-stamped. As a result, anyone, includ-
ing unwanted audiences, could understand this user’s birthday
even if the user did not disclose his/her birthday on the proﬁle.
Also, we often ﬁnd tweets where we can understand someone’s
birthday.
(exp 2) Atashi no tanjyobi ha 8 gatu youka yo, Risshu
tte itte 1 nen de mottomo atsui hi rashii wane–.
Koyomi no ue deha dayo?
(My birthday is August 8th, that is, the beginning
day of autumn, and seems to be the hottest day
of the year. Well, it is according to the calendar,
you know?)
(exp 3) @kahuhi kahuhi san tanjyobi omedetou goza-
imasu!!
(@kahuhi Mr. kahuhi, happy birthday!!)
Both (exp 2) and (exp 3) are tweets on Twitter. The sender of
(exp 2) disclosed her birthday by herself. On the other hand,
the sender of (exp 3) revealed his/her friend’s birthday. In this
Figure 1. Twitter recommends us to add our birthday to our proﬁles.
paper, we focus on birthday information because we treat it
differently than other personal information. For example, if
someone revealed our name, address, age, gender, telephone
number, or social security number on a SNS, we would get
upset him/her for doing it. On the other hand, interestingly, if
someone revealed our birthday in his/her birthday message on
a SNS, like (exp 3), most of us would appreciate what he/she
does, like (exp 4) and (exp 5).
(exp 4) message kureta minna arigatou. yoi tanjyobi ni
narimashita – (*ˆˆ*)
(Thank you for birthday messages. I have a nice
birthday – (*ˆˆ*))
(exp 5) @taguma6 reina no mama no tanjyobi oboete
kurete runyane, arigatou, sasuga
(@taguma6 I’m glad to hear that you remember
my mother’s birthday. Thank you. Amazing.)
Birthday messages often give us opportunities to start new
communications. As a result, as shown in Fig. 1, Twitter
recommends us to add our birthday to our proﬁles. It is likely
that these kinds of recommendations let SNS users discount
the potential risks related to disclosing personal information.
However, birthday information can be linkable to a speciﬁc
individual when it is combined with other information. In order
to deal with the privacy risks, it is important to investigate
how we disclose or reveal personal information on SNSs, not
only ours but of others. Birthday information especially should

be investigated carefully because we treat it differently than
other personal information. Furthermore, it is important to
investigate whether unwanted audiences can collect revealed
personal information automatically. To solve these problems, in
this paper, we investigate tweets where birthdays are revealed
to other users and show how we communicate with each
other about our birthdays. Furthermore, we discuss whether
unwanted audiences can collect revealed birthday information
by using machine learning techniques.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section
II, we survey the related works. In Section III, we report
how we disclose or reveal birthday information on Twitter. In
Section IV, we discuss whether unwanted audiences can col-
lect revealed birthday information by using machine learning
techniques. Finally, in Section V, we present our conclusions.

RELATED WORKS
Personally identiﬁable information is deﬁned as informa-
tion which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s
identity such as social security number, biometric records,
etc. alone, or when combined with other information that is
linkable to a speciﬁc individual, such as date and place of
birth, mother’s maiden name, etc. [1] [2]. Internet users are
generally concerned about unwanted audiences obtaining per-
sonal information. Fox et al. reported that 86% of Internet users
are concerned that unwanted audiences will obtain information
about them or their families [3]. Also, Acquisti and Gross
reported that students expressed high levels of concern for gen-
eral privacy issues on Facebook, such as a stranger ﬁnding out
where they live and the location and schedule of their classes,
and a stranger learning their sexual orientation, name of their
current partner, and their political afﬁliations [4]. However,
Internet users, especially young users, tend to disclose personal
information on their proﬁles, for example, real full name,
gender, hometown and full date of birth, which can potentially
be used to identify details of their real life, such as their
social security numbers. In order to discuss this phenomenon,
many researchers investigated how much and which type of
information are revealed in SNSs, especially, in Facebook.
Stutzman investigated Facebook proﬁles of University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill freshmen and found that 96.2% of them
published their birthdays on their Facebook proﬁles, 74.7%
their political views and 83.2% their sexual orientation [5].
Gross and Acquisti investigated Facebook proﬁles of Carnegie
Mellon University students and found that 87.8% of them
reveal their birth date on their proﬁles, 39.9% list their phone
number, and 50.8% list their current residence [6]. Taraszow
et al. observed Facebook proﬁles of 131 young people (68
females and 63 males, ages ranged from 14 to 29 years)
and found that all participants disclosed their birthdays and
54.2% list their hometowns on their Facebook proﬁles [7].
Taraszow et al. also observed Cypriot Facebook users and
found that they were willing to share personal information:
All of them published their real names, 97% revealed their
gender, 97% published a facial proﬁle picture of themselves,
97% published their facial proﬁle pictures, 51% indicated their
hometowns and 88% published their birth date [8]. Huffaker
and Calvert studied 70 teenage bloggers and found that 70%
of them published their ﬁrst names, 20% list their full names,
67% list their ages, and 39% list their birthdays [9]. Based
on these results, researchers discussed the reasons why users
willingly disclose personal information on their SNS proﬁles.
Dwyer concluded in her research that privacy is often not
expected or undeﬁned in SNSs [10]. Barnes argues that Internet
users, especially teenagers, are not aware of the nature of the
Internet and SNSs [11]. Hirai reported that many users had
troubles in SNSs because they did not mind that strangers
observed their communication with their friends [12]. Viseu
et al. reported that many online users believe the beneﬁts of
disclosing personal information in order to use an Internet
site as greater than the potential privacy risks [13]. On the
other hand, Acquisti and Gross explain this phenomenon as
a disconnection between the users’ desire to protect their
privacy and their actual behavior [4]. Also, Livingstone points
out that teenagers’ conception of privacy does not match the
privacy settings of most SNSs [14]. Joinson et al. reported that
trust and perceived privacy had a strong affect on individuals’
willingness to disclose personal information to a website [15].
Also, Tufekci found that concern about unwanted audiences
had an impact on whether or not students revealed their real
names and religious afﬁliation on MySpace and Facebook [16].
Next, we survey studies that focus on the issue of potential
privacy risks of disclosing personal information. Birthday
information alone cannot threaten the privacy and security of
users. However, it can expose users’ identities and threaten
their privacy when combined with other personal information
disclosed in their proﬁles. Sweeney reported 87% of Ameri-
cans can be uniquely identiﬁed from a birth date, ﬁve-digit zip
code, and gender [17]. Acquisti and Gross reported the exis-
tence of a potential ability to reconstruct users’ social security
numbers utilizing a combination of information often found in
proﬁles, such as their full name, date of birth and hometown
[4]. Many banks and credit-card companies recommend their
customers to select a personal identiﬁcation number (PIN)
that cannot be easily guessed, for example, birth date [18]
[19]. Bonneau et al. investigated 805 participants and found
that 23% of them chose their PINs representing dates [20].
Furthermore, Bonneau et al. asked users about the signiﬁcance
of the dates in their PINs: 29% of them used their own
birthday, 26% the birthday of a partner or family member, and
25% an important life event like an anniversary or graduation.
As a result, we should be aware of the potential privacy risks
on SNSs and manage our personal information carefully. SNSs
do not force users to reveal personal information. However, we
think, they actually recommend and encourage them to do so.
As shown in Fig. 1, Twitter recommended users to add their
birthdays on their Twitter proﬁles. On the other hand, Twitter
enables each user to set the visibility preferences for his/her
birthday on the proﬁle from options [21] [22]:
•
public,
•
limited audience, or
•
closed.
Fig. 2 shows a Twitter proﬁle where a user sets the visibility
preferences for his/her birthday. However, even if a user set it
closed, his/her birthday would be revealed to others when the
following kind of tweets was submitted.
(exp 6) @446xx110rn tanjyobi omedetou!!
(@446xx110rn Happy birthday!!)
We found many tweets where someone’s birthdays were re-
vealed and linked to speciﬁc Twitter accounts. We may say that

INVESTIGATION OF TWEETS WHERE BIRTHDAYS ARE
REVEALED TO OTHER PEOPLE
In this section, we show how we disclose or reveal birthday
information on Twitter.
A. The investigation object
We collected 1,000 Japanese tweets including word “tanjy-
obi (birthday)” in December 2015. We used these 1,000 tweets
for investigating tweets where birthdays were revealed to other
people.
Tweets can be classiﬁed into three types [23]:
•
reply
A reply is submitted to a particular person. It contains
“@username” in the body of the tweet. For example,
(exp 3), (exp 5), and (exp 6) are replies.
•
retweet
A retweet is a reply to a tweet that includes the original
tweet.
•
normal tweet
A normal tweet is neither reply nor retweet. For ex-
ample, (exp 2) and (exp 4) are normal tweets. Normal
tweets are generally submitted to general public.
Table I shows the numbers and percentages of normal tweets,
replies, and retweets in the 1,000 tweets. As shown in Table I,
there were no retweets in the 1,000 tweets. On the other hand,
Table II shows the numbers and percentages of normal tweets,
replies, and retweets in the 7,085,267 Japanese tweets obtained
in November and December 2012 by using the streaming API
[24]. The comparison of Table I with Table II shows that

word “tanjyobi (birthday)” was used more frequently in replies
than normal tweets. We classiﬁed these 1,000 tweets into three
types:
TYPE S
tweets where sender’s birthdays were disclosed
by themselves,
TYPE R
tweets where receiver’s birthdays were revealed
by senders, and
TYPE N tweets where no one’s birthdays were revealed.
Table III shows the classiﬁcation result. As shown in Table III,
there were 294 tweets revealing senders’ or receivers’ birth-
days. Furthermore, the number of tweets revealing receivers’
birthdays (211 tweets) was more than twice the number of
tweets revealing senders’ birthdays (83 tweets). In this study,
a tweet where someone’s birthday was revealed but could not
be linked to a speciﬁc Twitter account was classiﬁed into
TYPE N: tweets where no one’s birthdays were revealed. For
example, the birthdays of oniichan (brother) in (exp 7) and
Chihiro Iwasaki in (exp 8) were revealed but could not be
linked to their Twitter accounts. As a result, in this study,
these tweets were classiﬁed into TYPE N.
(exp 7) kyou ha jikkei no tanjyobi! oniichan tanjyobi
omedetou – ! 18 kin kaikin toka otona yana...
(Today is my elder brother’s birthday! Happy
birthday, brother. Now, you can watch movies for
adults only...)
(exp 8) Iwasaki Chihiro san no tanjyobi nanoka
(Today is the birthday of Chihiro Iwasaki.)
Chihiro Iwasaki was a famous Japanese artist.

B. Tweets where birthdays are revealed
1) Tweets where sender’s birthdays are revealed (TYPE
S): In order to start new communications on Twitter, many
users submitted tweets where their birthdays were disclosed by
themselves. The point is that senders disclosed their birthdays
not only in normal tweets but replies. Both (exp 9) and (exp 10)
were normal tweets where senders’ birthdays were disclosed
by themselves.
(exp 9) kyou tanjyobi nanode dareka nonde kudasai!!!!
(Today is my birthday. Does anyone keen to go
drinking with me!!!!)
(exp 10) shi-a-wa—se suggoi tanoshii tanjyobi deshita–

toriaezu ashi itasugiru. hayo ie tsukan ka na-n
(H-A-P-P-Y I had a very happy birthday!!! I do
appreciate you. Thank you. Just say my foot hurts.
I want to go home soon.)
On the other hand, (exp 11) was a reply where sender’s
birthday was disclosed by himself/herself.
(exp 11) @takutwu w takuto kun– kyou tanjyobi nanda
oiwai rep hoshii na
(@takutwu w Takuto kun–, today is my birthday.
Give me your birthday message, please.)
As shown in Table III, sender’s birthdays were disclosed in
normal tweets more frequently than replies. (exp 9) and (exp
10) were normal tweets and the senders of them wanted
to communicate with anyone. On the other hand, (exp 11)
was a reply and the sender of it wanted to communicate
with a particular person (@takutwu w). However, all of (exp
9), (exp 10), and (exp 11) were submitted for starting new
communications on Twitter. On the other hand, (exp 12) was
a reply where the sender disclosed her birthday not because
she wanted to start a new communication but because she was
asked when her birthday was.
(exp 12) @kmns6 n teru-chan kon (*´ ∇｀*) sou nano–

Yesterday was my birthday. Thank you ♡ I got
another year older again. I have got your birthday
message out of my mind because you said nothing
for a long time. I am happy ♪)
All of (exp 9), (exp 10), (exp 11), and (exp 12) were submitted
within one day of senders’ birthdays. On the other hand, (exp
13) and (exp 14) were not. The senders of (exp 13) and (exp
14) disclosed their birthdays by showing the dates.
(exp 13) boku no tanjyobi ha, 2007 nen 9 gatsu 20 nichi
goro da nya– (ˆˆ)
(My date of birth is September 20, 2007 –(ˆˆ))
(exp 14) @alex hayate shigusa...uwame dukai toka? a,
tanjyobi ha 8 gatsu nanoka desu
(@alex hayate gesture... up-from-under look? Oh,
my birthday is August 7.)
The sender of (exp 15) disclosed her birthday by showing not
the dates but whom she shared a birthday with.
(exp 15) masaka no furukawa yuuki kun to onaji tanjyobi
ww majime ni ureshii desu
(Oh, I share a birthday with Yuuki Furukawa kun
ww Very happy.)
Yuuki Furukawa in (exp 15) was an actor and his birthday
might be published. However, we did not understand his
birthday with just (exp 15). As a result, we determined that
sender’s birthday of (exp 15) was unclear. In this study, tweets
where birthdays were revealed unclearly, such as (exp 15),
were classiﬁed into TYPE N.
2) Tweets where receiver’s birthdays are revealed (TYPE
R): As shown in Table III, tweets where receivers’ birthdays
were revealed by senders were all replies. Furthermore, the
number of replies where receivers’ birthdays were revealed was
almost half of the number of replies including word “tanjyobi
(birthday)”.
(exp 16) @nami 1215
nami tanjyobi omedetou!!!
(@nami 1215
Nami happy birthday!!!)
Tweets revealing receivers’ birthdays were almost birthday
messages to them, such as (exp 16).
3) Tweets revealing no one’s birthdays (TYPE N): Tweets
where birthdays could not be linked to speciﬁc Twitter ac-
counts, such as (exp 17), (exp 18), and (exp 19), were classiﬁed
into TYPE N: tweets where no one’s birthdays were revealed.
(exp 17) ke-taman tanjyobi omedetou –
(ke-taman happy birthday –)
(exp 18) kyou ha daisuki na aya chan no tanjyobi!!!
(Today is my favorite Aya’s birthday!!!)
(exp 19) @hokoa a Valentine Day- yade w Jingu no tanjy-
obi ww tsuraa www watashi ha iroiro dashi sugite
tsurai ww
(@hokoa a Valentine’s Day w Jingu’s birthday
ww hard www I had a hard time of it ww)
Just like (exp 15), we did not understand chiipopo’s birthday
with just (exp 20). As a result, (exp 20) was classiﬁed into
TYPE N.
(exp 20) watashi chiipopo to tanjyobi onaji yawa
(I share a birthday with chiipopo.)
The senders of (exp 21) and (exp 22) showed what had
happened or would happen on their birthdays. However, they
did not show when their birthdays were. As a result, (exp 21)
and (exp 22) were classiﬁed into TYPE N.
(exp 21) 22 sai no tanjyobi ni −20 ◦C no yukiyama de
fuhatsudan shori shiteta.
(On my 22th birthday, I did bomb disposal work
in a snowy mountain, minus 20 degrees.)
(exp 22) tanjyobi ni intern kakutei shita shini tai
(I have to work on an internship program on my
birthday. I’d rather die.)
The sender of (exp 23) asked the receiver when her birthday
was. We could not understand her birthday with just (exp 23).
As a result, (exp 23) was classiﬁed into TYPE N.
(exp 23) iku chan kyou tanjyobi jya nakatta?
(Iku chan. Is today your birthday?)
Tweets dealing with topics related to “birthday”, but not
someone’s birthday, such as (exp 24) and (exp 25), were
classiﬁed into TYPE N.

DETECTION OF TWEETS WHERE BIRTHDAYS ARE
REVEALED TO OTHER PEOPLE
If we detect tweets revealing someone’s birthdays automat-
ically, we can give warnings to users before they submit their
tweets where someone’s birthdays are revealed. In this section,
we discuss whether we can automatically detect tweets where
someone’s birthdays are revealed by using machine learning
techniques.
In this study, we used the support vector machine (SVM)
for data training and classifying. Table IV shows feature s1 ∼
s16 used in machine learning on experimental data. s1 ∼ s7
were obtained by using the results of morphological analysis
on experimental data. In the experiments, we used a Japanese
morphological analyzer, JUMAN for word segmentation of
tweets [25]. s8 ∼ s10 and s12 ∼ s14 were obtained by
extracting character N-gram from experimental data. Odaka
et al. reported that character 3-gram is good for Japanese
processing [26]. s4 ∼ s7 and s12 ∼ s15 were obtained
from ﬁrst sentences of tweets. This is because, we thought,
clue expressions of birthday messages are often found at ﬁrst
sentences of tweets.
In this study, we used the 1,000 tweets investigated in
Section III for the experimental data. We conducted this exper-
iment using TinySVM [27]. Table V shows the experimental
result. The experimental result was obtained with 10-fold
cross-validation. As shown in Table III, the experimental data

consisted of 560 normal tweets and 440 replies. We divided
the experimental result (Table V) into those of 560 normal
tweets (Table VI) and 440 replies (Table VII).
As shown in Table V, 865 tweets were classiﬁed correctly
and 135 tweets incorrectly in this experiment. 66 tweets out
of 135 incorrectly classiﬁed tweets were ones where sender’s
birthdays were revealed. As shown in Table V, the recall of
tweets revealing senders’ birthdays were 20%. As shown in
Table VI and Table VII, many tweets revealing senders’ birth-
days were classiﬁed incorrectly into tweets revealing no one’s
birthdays. As a result, it is difﬁcult to detect tweets revealing
senders’ birthdays and give warnings to senders before they
submit tweets revealing their birthdays. On the other hand, as
shown in Table V, the precision of tweets revealing senders’
and receivers’ birthdays were 71% and 82%, respectively.
Our method is useful for collecting tweets revealing birthdays
precisely. As a result, it is easy for attackers to collect birthday
information related to speciﬁc Twitter accounts by using our
method.
V.
CONCLUSION
Many people willingly disclose their birthdays on their
SNS proﬁles and reveal others’ birthdays on their SNS mes-
sages. They seem unaware of the potential risks of doing it.
Birthday information alone cannot threaten their privacy and
security. However, it can expose users’ identities and threaten
their privacy when combined with other personal information
disclosed in their proﬁles. Interestingly, we treat birthday
information differently than other personal information. For

example, if someone revealed our personal information except
birthday on a SNS, we would get upset him/her for doing
it. On the other hand, if someone revealed our birthday in
his/her birthday message on a SNS, most of us would feel
happy and appreciate what he/she does. However, we have not
sufﬁciently investigated how we reveal birthday information
on SNSs. As a result, the authors investigated how we reveal
birthday information on SNSs, not only ours but of others.
In this study, we investigated tweets where someone’s
birthdays were revealed to other people. We collected 1,000
Japanese tweets including word “tanjyobi (birthday)” and
found that about 30% of them were tweets where someone’s
birthdays were revealed to other people. Furthermore, about
70% of tweets revealing someone’s birthdays were ones where
receivers’ birthdays were revealed by senders. In this study, we
proposed a method of detecting tweets revealing someone’s
birthday by using machine learning techniques. The experi-
mental result showed that our method was able to classify
tweets including word “tanjyobi (birthday)” with accuracy of
87%. However, the recall of tweets revealing senders’ birthday
was only 20%. As a result, in our method, it is difﬁcult to
detect tweets revealing senders’ birthdays and give warnings
to senders before they submit them. On the other hand, the
precision of tweets revealing senders’ and receivers’ birthdays
were 71% and 82%, respectively. As a result, in our method, it
is not difﬁcult to collect tweets revealing birthdays precisely.
We recommend that birthday messages should not be sent via
SNSs. This is because unwanted audiences can read and collect
them. We are now investigating other language tweets where
birthdays are disclosed or revealed to other people.
