Abstract—In this paper, we propose an equalization algorithm 
for M-PSK constellations that greatly improves the convergence 
features and reduces steady-state error rate of the conventional 
Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA). The proposed algorithm 
introduces a buffer and multiple step-size decision layers to the 
existing Variable Step Size Modified Constant Modulus 
Algorithm (VSS-MCMA) equalizer. The buffer is employed to 
combat the convergence issue while the additional layers have 
been introduced to improve sensitivity of the step size in both the 
convergence state and the steady-state. Computer simulations 
reveal that the proposed algorithm has better convergence rate 
than the VSS-MCMA and the CMA. 
Keywords—Blind equalization; constant modulus algorithm; 
step size  
I.   INTRODUCTION  
     In wireless communications, one of the most important 
transmission problems is the channel distortion. Channel 
distortion leads to InterSymbol Interference (ISI) between 
transmitted symbols. There have been many blind equalization 
techniques to combat this effect. Constant modulus algorithm,   
originated by Godard [1] and Treichler and Agee [2], is the 
most popular equalization technique among all blind 
equalization methods. As all blind equalizers, constant 
modulus algorithm works in absence of the training sequence. 
In the algorithm, step size is a crucial parameter to determine 
the convergence speed and steady-state error rate. A small 
chosen step size will result in a low steady-state error rate. 
However, convergence will be slow. Conversely, a large value 
of step size will result in a faster convergence yet a higher 
steady-state error rate. Therefore, the Constant Modulus 
Algorithm (CMA) has a trade-off between these two criteria. 
Another drawback of the algorithm is that it is unable to 
correct phase rotations induced by the channel [3].  
Oh and Chin propose the Modified Constant Modulus 
Algorithm (MCMA), which resolves phase rotation problem 
of the CMA. This is achieved by minimizing two cost 
functions, which are separately computed for real and 
imaginary parts of input signal. The algorithm applies both 
equalization and phase correction. 
 Variable Step Size Modified Constant Modulus Algorithm 
(VSS – MCMA) [4] is an algorithm that applies phase 
correction and makes the step size more sensitive. In this 
algorithm, a circular area is defined around each likely-
transmitted symbol in the constellation and the step size is 
changed between two values according to whether equalizer 
output symbol is located inside an area or not. 
    Many other algorithms [5]-[17] have been proposed to 
combat the problems encountered in CMA. Zarzoso and 
Comon [5] suggested an algorithm that finds optimal step size 
in each update operation. Tugcu et al. [6] employ cross 
correlation between channel output and the error signal to 
overcome the convergence problem. Song et al. [7] employ a 
signal steering vector and its oblique projection for updating 
filter coefficients in order to avoid signal steering vector 
mismatches. Lin and Lee [8] introduce an algorithm that finds 
a gain factor by the least-mean-squares method when updating 
filter coefficients to avoid gradient noise amplification 
problem. Demir and Ozen [9] proposed a new algorithm in 
which autocorrelation of error signal is used for updating filter 
coefficients. Gao and Qiu [10] employ a momentum term and 
autocorrelation of error signal for updating filter coefficients. 
The additional momentum term improves the convergence 
rate. Li et al. [11] utilize singular value decomposition of 
input signal to obtain a new step size in order to improve the 
convergence rate. A new update equation is proposed by 
Abrar and Nandi [12] to improve the convergence rate. A 
nonlinear estimate of error signal is used for updating the 
equalizer coefficients, and a novel deterministic optimization 
criterion is given. Ikhlef et al. [13] employ the prewhitening 
technique and the complex Givens rotations to improve signal 
to noise and interference ratio performance. Yan et al. [14] 
employ nonlinear transformation of error signal to suppress 
the alpha-stable noise. Nassar and Nahal [15] recently 
proposed Exponentially weighted step-size recursive Least 
Squares Constant Modulus Algorithm (EXP-RLS-CMA), 
which can be considered as the combination of the 
conventional CMA and the exponentially weighted step-size 
recursive least squares algorithm. The EXP-RLS-CMA 
provides higher convergence rate than the conventional CMA 
at minimum mean-squared-error. Liyi et al. [16] introduce a 
new variable step size algorithm in which a nonlinear function 
of error signal is employed to calculate the step size in each 
symbol period. Baofeng et al. [17] employ cross-correlation 
between the input signal and the error signal to control the 
step size for a better convergence rate. 
    In this work, we have generalized the VSS-MCMA to 
multi-layered case in order to make the step size more 
sensitive.  Moreover, we have added a buffer to the equalizer    
to overcome the convergence problem.

    This paper is organized as follows. We have introduced the 
general transmission model and system models of the CMA, 
MCMA and VSS-MCMA equalizers in Section II. In Section 
III, we have presented our Buffered Multi-layered Modified 
Constant Modulus Algorithm (BML-MCMA). We have 
examined the simulation results of the proposed algorithm and 
the other two algorithms in Section IV. Finally, we have 
drawn the conclusions in Section V.

wN-1(n)]T. R(n) is the tapped delay line vector of received signal 
r(n) and it is defined as R(n) = [r(n), r(n-1), ... , r(n-N+1)]T.

     MCMA blind equalization algorithm in [3] applies 
modifications to CMA in calculation of cost function. 
Computations are performed using real and the imaginary parts 
of equalizer output separately. The purpose of separating the 
real and imaginary parts is to correct phase rotations 
encountered in CMA. The cost function for MCMA has the

where s(n) = sR(n) + jsI(n). 
 
C. Variable Step Size Modified Constant Modulus 
     Algorithm  
 
    The VSS – MCMA algorithm proposed in [4] is an 
improvement on MCMA. The algorithm employs step-size 
adaptation to boost the performance in both the convergence 
state and the steady state. The change of step size depends on 
the regions defined in the signal space. 
     Let the signal space contain M  regions, namely, a circular 
area with radius l is placed around each of total M likely 
transmitted symbols. One of two step size parameters is 
selected according to whether the equalizer output is located 
inside the circular area around the nearest symbol or not. In 
other words

     The above equation indicates that if equalizer output is not

      In the proposed system, existing VSS – MCMA algorithm 
is generalized to a multi-layered system and parallel buffer-
delay elements are added before the equalizer. The purpose of

system is shown in Fig. 1. In the system, initially, first S baud 
segment of input signal r(n) is used for updating the equalizer 
coefficients only. At the end of S baud periods, namely, at time 
STS, thanks to the control element, the system turns off the 
counter and switches to delay output.  This time, input signal is 
fed into the equalizer through the delay element. Although a 
delay of S baud periods is introduced to the signal, because the 
equalizer coefficients are updated previously, the convergence 
problem is removed on a large scale. 
     To begin analysis of the system, let the signal space contain 
D regions around every symbol, namely, around every symbol, 
D circular layers are constructed. This is depicted in Fig. 2, 
where D has the value of 2. Here, li,j (i = 1,2, … , D, j = 1,2,…, 
M)  denotes the radius of ith layer around jth symbol. Let us 
denote radius of the outmost layer by l and the distance 
between two nearest symbols by p. Then, the restriction to the 
size of outmost layer is l<0.5p. The step size is selected 
according to whether the equalizer output is located in a layer 
around nearest symbol or not. The general selection rule can be 
expressed as

                IV.  NUMERICAL RESULTS 
 
     In this section, we explore the convergence rate 
performance of the proposed algorithm through computer 
simulations. We also compare performance of the proposed 
algorithm with the conventional CMA and the VSS – MCMA. 
     In the simulations, we have used the 2-tap complex channel                        
h(n) = [1 + 0.5δ(n-1)] + j[1 + 0.4δ(n-1)] [13] and the 3-tap 
Proakis B-channel h(n) = 0.407 + 0.815δ(n-1) + 0.407δ(n-2) 
[18], where δ(n) is the Kronecker delta function. The channel 
is normalized such that the total power is unit watts. Equalizer 
tap number is selected as 11. For the 2-tap complex channel, 
all of the taps are initialized to zero except the first tap is 
initialized to one. For Proakis-B channel, all of the taps are 
initialized to zero except the center tap is initialized to one. 
Additive noise is assumed to be zero-mean complex white 
Gaussian noise. Transmitted signal length N is chosen as 106 
symbols, which is assumed to be long enough to examine the 
performance of the three systems. Number of buffer samples S 
is chosen as 104 for the 2-tap complex channel case and 5×104 
for the Proakis B-channel case. 
     We present the performance of the three equalizers through 
constellations of equalizer outputs. Constellations of outputs of 
the three equalizers at QPSK, 8-PSK, 16-PSK and 32-PSK 
under the 2-tap complex channel, are given in Fig. 3, Fig. 4, 
Fig. 5 and Figs. 6 and 7, respectively. SNR values at which the

simulations are performed, are chosen as 15 dB, 20 dB, 30 dB 
and 40 dB respectively. Optimum values of µ and l parameters 
of the three equalizers are obtained heuristically.                                       
      In Fig. 3, it can be seen that BML-MCMA has the lowest 
Mean-squared Error (MSE) by having less scattered symbols 
than the two other. In the case of VSS-MCMA, a clear QPSK 
constellation is not visible. Therefore, the VSS-MCMA has the 
highest MSE and Symbol Error Rate (SER).  
From Fig. 4, one can note that the BML-MCMA 
outperforms the two other. The employment of buffer and 
multiple step size layers results in a better output constellation. 
Because there is no buffer used in conventional CMA and 
VSS-MCMA, number of highly scattered symbols are much 
greater than those of the BML-MCMA. The conventional 
CMA has a better constellation than VSS-MCMA. 
Fig. 5 clearly indicates that BML-MCMA has the best 
performance by having the clearest constellation. Here, again, 
there are large number of highly scattered symbols in 
constellations of CMA and VSS-MCMA. The BML-MCMA 
overcomes this problem thanks to its buffer element and its 
output constellation yields better overall MSE than those of the 
other two. 
Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 show that the BML-MCMA has the best 
MSE performance and convergence rate. Conventional CMA 
and the VSS-MCMA have many highly-scattered symbols and 
they cannot yield a clear constellation. Consequently, these two 
equalizers have much lower convergence rate.

     Fig. 8 shows the constellation of first 20000 output symbols 
of equalizer at 8-PSK modulation under Proakis B-channel. 
Since the Proakis B-channel is a harsh channel, we have 
increased the buffer size to 50000 symbols. From Fig. 8, it can 
be observed that BML-MCMA outperforms the two other in 
convergence rate. Conventional CMA takes the second place 
and VSS-MCMA again has the lowest convergence rate. 
     In the second part of the simulations, we have investigated 
the effect of buffer size S on the convergence rate of the BML-
MCMA equalizer through the constellations obtained for 
various buffer size values. Fig. 9 shows the constellations of 
first 20000 elements of equalizer outputs for S = 10000, 25000 
and 50000 symbols, respectively. The modulation is 8-PSK 
and we have used the Proakis B-channel. The SNR value is    
16 dB.  Fig. 9 shows that using only the first 50000 symbols of 
the input, the BML-MCMA equalizer reduces the convergence 
problem greatly and results in a clear constellation. For a 
buffer size of 25000 symbols, the equalizer significantly 
reduces the convergence problem so it   can resolve the 8-PSK 
symbols. Due to the harsh Proakis B-channel, a buffer size of 
10000 symbols is not enough to eliminate the convergence 
problem.

   V. CONCLUSION 
 
Despite there is no need for a training sequence, 
conventional CMA and VSS-MCMA have convergence 
problems. In this paper, we have proposed our BML-MCMA 
algorithm to eliminate the convergence problems and further 
improve MSE performance of VSS-MCMA. We have 
presented numerical results which indicate that through using a 
buffer, the proposed algorithm resolves convergence problem 
greatly. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm has better MSE 
performance. Although using a buffer introduces some initial 
delay to the equalizer, considering the overall performance, 
BML-MCMA is a good alternative to the existing blind 
equalization algorithms.
