Abstract—With the rapid rising of the number of cellular 
phone users, accessing the Internet via handset devices is 
becoming a standard configuration in terms of network 
activities and people’s daily life, resulting in an ever-increasing 
usage of the Mobile Internet. Yet, there were little knowing 
about how users’ behavior on Mobile Internet is. Considering 
most Mobile Internet users satisfy browsing, the browsing 
traffic is focused in this paper. Through studying on users’ 
browsing behavior on Mobile Internet with an extended On-
Off model to understand generation mechanism of browsing 
traffic, this paper proposed a browsing traffic model in which 
such results as self-similarity of traffic volume and following 
Pareto and Weibull distribution of File Size, View Time and 
WAP Gateway Response Time were found out by investigating 
real data sets. This paper launches a primary research on 
traffic model for Mobile Internet browsing behavior.

INTRODUCTION 
Mobile Internet has become a profitable and promising 
business. According to CNNIC‟s (China Network Information 
Center) report [1], there were about 35,558 netizens 
investigated had Mobile Internet surfing experience with 
mobile phone in 2011, while 11,760 in 2008 which have 
increased about 3 times in these years. The report also shows 
that 62.1% and 60.9% Mobile Internet netizens habitually 
use news and search service [1]，respectively, which means 
that browsing traffic is the main stream of Mobile Internet 
traffic now in China. 
However, there were few studies on user behaviors on 
Mobile Internet while such throne market. Some previous 
researches [2] [3] [4] [5] focused on WAP-based (Wireless 
Application Protocol) mobile network behaviors. The model 
of the WAP traffic generated by requesting web pages that 
reply with Wireless Makeup Language (WML) files in 
General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) network was studied. 
Varga et al. [2] provided a traffic model based on long-term, 
live measurements, and observations to estimate the user 
behavior and the workload in GPRS network. Irene C. Y. Ma 
et al. [3] constructed a model of WAP traffic based on a 
number of user scenarios to study the characteristics of the 
WAP traffic. Toshihiko Yamakami [4,5] studied user 
behaviors on mobile Internet in Japan. By examining the 
long-term mobile Internet user transaction logs, he analyzed 
the long-term usage pattern to study the notion of user “age” 
(the length of user experience [4]) and explored regularity 
measures to track user behaviors based on an ad-hoc 
assumption that the user loyalty relates to the web visit 
regularity [5]. In some newest research on Mobile Internet  
traffic, Lymberopoulos et al. [20] proposed to use a machine 
learning approach based on stochastic gradient boosting 
techniques to efficiently model the signature of Mobile 
Internet users whose web access traces were analyzed. Chuan 
Xu et al. proposed a new method of measuring the similarity 
of daily clicks distribution by Pearson Correlated Coefficient 
and introduced various means to describe the heterogeneity 
of clicks distribution both in users and in websites [21]. 
Some interesting results (like users‟ obeying 20/80 rule) 
were found in [20][21]. 
Being a basic theoretical issue, the research of traffic 
model is valuable for WAP/Web site owners and network 
operators and also useful in study on future network. Most 
users of Mobile Internet, as page browsers, are satisfied with 
viewing page such as news and search. Thus, browsing 
traffic (or HTTP traffic) is the dominating traffic of Mobile 
Internet. This paper aims to build a traffic model of page 
browsing for describing the browsing traffic behaviors on 
Mobile Internet. The contributions of this paper are 
summarized as follows: 
 
An extended On-Off model is used to help 
understanding the mechanism of traffic generation of 
page browsing behavior on Mobile Internet. Traffic 
Volume, File Size, View Time and WAP Gateway 
Response Time were determined to describe the 
traffic model of page browsing behaviors. 
 
We analyzed the parameters of model through a real 
data set from methods such as Hurst coefficient [12] 
and K-S test [2]. 
This paper is organized as follow: We constructed a 
browsing traffic model in Section II. In Section III, data sets 
obtained in two years is presented. With these data sets, we 
worked out the analysis of the browsing traffic model by 
Hurst coefficient and K-S test with data we contained in 
Section IV. Finally, this paper is concluded in Section V. 
II. 
MODEL CONSTRUCTION 
A. Communication Mode 
In user‟s browsing behavior on Mobile Internet, there are 
three kinds of communication entries involved. They are user, 
gateway and WAP/Web server as shown in Figure 1. On the 
Mobile Internet, the requests of users have to be transpond 
by the gateway before arriving servers. The same thing 
259

happens to the responses from server. Users‟ browsing pages 
of WAP site or Web site cause their sending two kinds of 
requests to servers: WAP browsing refers to the browsing 
demands for the hypertext pages that respond with the WML 
language following the WAP suite. Web browsing refers to 
the browsing demands for the PC-based pages to Web 
servers but through mobile terminals. Yet either the requests 
of WAP browsing or Web browsing should get through 
gateway on Mobile Internet. Thus, the traffic of Mobile 
Internet has to go through the gateway [2].

Being in such a special network structure, the traffic 
behaviors on Mobile Internet are different from that of PC-
based Internet. 
B. Extended On-Off Model 
The On-Off model is introduced in many researches of 
network traffic [6] [7] [19]. In analyzing the user traffic 
behaviors, each user is recognized as an On-Off source in 
which On-State represents traffic generating process and 
Off-State represents silent period.

Fig. 2. The Extended On-Off Model. 
 
To explain how the page browsing traffic is generated on 
Mobile Internet, we extend the On-Off model by adding 
details from the WAP gateway and WAP/Web server as 
shown in Figure 2. When a user launches a session, the WAP 
gateway and WAP/Web server should be ready for serving. 
It is explicit that user‟s behavior still can be recognized as 
two states, On-State for requesting hypertext page started by 
clicking which generates traffic and Off-State for reading. 
Consequently, WAP gateway and WAP/Web server would 
be on On-State for handling requests and sending responses 
back and Off-State for waiting for serving.  
C. Browsing Traffic Model 
As stated in previous section, the mechanism of traffic 
generation of page browsing for the traffic situation depends 
on the way users switch between On-State and Off-State and 
network structure. To study browsing traffic we need to 
answer such questions like how often the user clicks pages, 
how the pages traffic volume is and how the delay of Mobile 
Internet network is. Thus we consider 4 factors influencing 
page browsing traffic which are  
 
Traffic Volume (TV);  
 
File Size (FS), including main object size (MS) and 
embedded object size (ES); 
 
Viewing Time (VT);  
 
WAP Gateway Response Time (GRT). 
Traffic Volume can directly descript the traffic situation. 
File Size indicates the traffic volume generated by browsing 
the traffic of which is also the main traffic of the network. 
Viewing Time denotes the user reading and clicking 
frequency. Moreover, WAP Gateway Response Time show 
how the WAP gateway affects browsing time consumption 
which is the very procedure delaying the traffic transmission. 
With these 4 factors, we primarily establish the browsing 
traffic model on Mobile Internet. In the rest of this paper, we 
investigated this model by real data sets. 
III. 
DATA SETS 
The dataset in this paper is obtained from the log files of 
a WAP gateway which belongs to China Telecom. These 
WAP gateway logs record all the information of Mobile 
Internet users‟ online activities for one week from Apr. 5, 
2010 to Apr. 11, 2010, and the other week from Apr. 4, 2011 
to Apr. 10, 2011. Each record in the log files contains request 
and response information including Time, Destination 
Domain, URL, Client IP Address, User Agent, etc.  
A basic statistics of these data sets is shown in table, as 
appendix. The change proportion of WAP traffic and Web 
traffic can roughly label the change of mobile terminal 
performance for users tend to abandon WAP page with high-
performance terminal which also reflects the change of user 
behavior pattern.

Here, base on the data obtained, we would like to study 
data characteristics by statistically analyzing. As shown in 
Figure 3, we worked out the total number of users, clicks and 
total flow traffic of the data of the two weeks which have 
increased about 4 to 8 times in these two years. We can infer 
that the WAP gateway burdens a higher workload at 2011

comparing 2010, indicating the exploding growing of Mobile 
Internet.  
With the overview of our data sets shown above, we can 
get an outline about the development of Mobile Internet. 
However further study is still necessary for practical 
purposes. 
IV. 
ANALYSIS OF MODEL 
A. Traffic Volume 
Traffic Volume (TV) is an indicator to simply describe 
traffic situation of network. Self-similarity is an important 
characteristic of Traffic Volume as mentioned in [7]. Thus at 
the beginning, we analyze the elementary daily Mobile 
Internet traffic pattern to find the law of user behavior by 
investigating self-similarity of Traffic Volume. However, the 
traffic analyzed is from macroscopic view, the analysis bases 
on statistic.  
Here are the traffic distributions on statistic for a week in 
Figure 4. The daily Mobile Internet service condition could 
easily show the daily user behavior as users browse in day-
time and sleep at night. The traffic is high in the daytime 
because people are active while the traffic stays low after 
about two hours in the early morning because most of people 
fall asleep. The relations between traffic of different days are 
not clear. Yet, we can think over the self-similarity of the 
Traffic Volume.

Fig. 5. Sample Aggregation Plot for Mobile Internet Traffic 
 
The self-similarity of network traffic has been proven in 
many studies [8][9]. The studies on WAP traffic, for the 
most part, base on simulated WAP traffic or small data set of 
real trace which only comprise of pure WAP traffic [10][11]. 
The paper give a self-similarity study based on the data from 
a large scale data set of real trace of mobile Internet, which 
not only contains the WAP traffic but also the traffic 
generated by the connecting between the mobile terminals 
and Internet.  
Mobile Internet traffic was aggregated into various time 
frames to roughly be observed self-similarity. For 27 
consecutive hours of monitored mobile Internet from April 
2010 trace, Figure 5 shows a sequence of simple plots of 
requests which counts for 3 different time frames, each 
subsequent plot is included in the previous one by increasing 
the time resolution by a factor of 10 on a random subinterval. 
Intuitively, the curves of days in Figure 5 are „similar‟ to 
one anther. To prove the self-similarity of daily mobile 
Internet traffic, R/S algorithm is used to calculate the Hurst 
coefficient of daily traffic.

In this experiment, Mobile Internet traffic was collected 
consecutively for a week, and the time series was partitioned 
according to 10 sec. We separately give the results under two 
different time scales, days and weeks, shown in the table I 
and the result of R/S for a week is shown in Figure 6. 
The parameters of Hurst in Table I are all around 0.8, 
where a value above 0.5 indicates self-similarity. This 
compares to the Hurst parameters in the range between 0.76 
and 0.83 exhibited by the actual traces captured from web 
browsing activity [13]. We believe that Mobile Internet in 
China now being in the preliminary stage, its properties on 
traffic and some other aspects may be similar with that of 
PC-based Internet traffic in the early stage. 
B. File Size  
Though the study on TV above provides the outline of 
the traffic model, we still need some more details about it. 
Through the On-Off model, we can understand how a page is 
generated. Main object, the response to user‟s clicking, 
constitutes the page associating with embedded object. As 
embedded object is requested by browser acting differently 
from user‟s clicking, it is necessary to study their traffic 
pattern respectively. File Size which refers to the size of 
page objects (such as html, flv and gif) from server is the 
source of browsing traffic. The investigation to MS and ES 
can clarify the detail of page browsing behavior.  
We can easily obtain File Size by extracting information 
of DOWNLINK_CONTENT_LENGTH domain of each 
record in the data set. We distinguish main object record 
with embedded object record by  the analysis of URL 
domain and Content_Type domain which are recording the 
URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and type of resource (text, 
img et) of the object. The two kinds of objects and the results 
are shown in the Figure 7.

Having obtained the CDFs (Cumulative Distribution 
Function) of File Size, we perform the K-S test on them 
whose results are also shown in Figure 7 and Table II. In our 
testing, the samples of our data set follow the Pareto 
distribution. In Figure 7, we can find that the curves of 
empirical data fit theoretical curves perfectly. The result 
comes as the same as [14]. In Table II, the parameters of the 
fitting Pareto curves are shown.

In Figure 7(a), the curve rises directly at about [80,120] 
which means most MS ranges between 80 to 120 byte. As 
the main object often carries the information the users going 
to read, we deem the trend of MS reflects the fact that one 
page usually provides few information for user on Mobile 
Internet. This is a normal phenomenon for the small screen 
of the terminal and specially arrangement of the WAP/Web 
site owners. The same trend also happens in Figure 7(b) 
plotting the curve of ES CDF. The ES concentrate on the 
range between 50 bytes to 200 bytes. It actually can be easily 
inferred by considering the simplicity of browser and the low 
capability of terminal. Thus, we believe the Pareto 
distribution is appropriate for describing the File Size. 
C. Viewing Time 
The Viewing Time (VT) denotes the timespan that a user 
browses a web page. The exact Viewing Time actually is 
difficult to count because we cannot trace the time that the 
user finishes receiving the web page, so the error is 
transmission time. However, the transmission time exists in 
every user click and is transitory compared to the whole VT. 
We roughly consider the timespan between two user requests 
in a session to be the view time on mobile Internet. Now, the 
problem is how to determine each user session (it refers to 
the course from spanning users‟ opening to closing browser 
software.) because the timespans between each user session 
are contained in the timespans between two user requests.

The user session could be determined exactly by Client

system randomly assigned Client IP when user logged on 
Mobile Internet, thus through tracing user log we could 
easily abandon the timespans between user sessions. 
However, when the user left idle for a long time (idle time) 
for some reasons, this timespan was still considered as VT. 
In PC-based Internet, 79 percent of our test users always 
scanned any new page they came across; only 16 percent 
read word-by-word [15], and our trace showed that 97.9% 
users‟ VT last within 150 seconds. Thus, VT on Mobile 
Internet could not be long. So, we give a threshold 150 
seconds to determine the idle time, which means that VT 
lasts within 150 seconds while idle time last longer than it. 
According to the statistic, VT less than 10 seconds account 
for 62.85% of all VT of users; viewing time between 10 and 
20 seconds is responsible for 17.97%. The CDF of VT is 
plotted in Figure 8. 
In [16] and [17], VT follows Pareto distribution. The 
sample from our data set, through K-S test mentioned above, 
is proved to have no best fitted distribution, but the largest 
vertical distance of Pareto distribution in Figure 8 indeed 
turn out to be the minimum. It is obviously in Figure 8 that 
the curve of our sample rises relatively slower than the 
Pareto distribution. On the average Web page, users have 
time to read at most 28% of the words during an average 
visit; 20% is more likely [18]. Comparing to PC-based 
Internet, the reading habit of user on Mobile Internet is 
similar. However, because the size of screen for each mobile 
terminal is much smaller than ordinary computer screen, 
information delivered from mobile terminals is so limited 
that users are more willing to read word by word, and taking 
transmission time into consideration, the VT of mobile 
Internet users is relative longer than PC-based Internet, 
which is the reason why the curve of our sample rises 
slower than Pareto distribution. However, the details of how 
mobile Internet user read is still not clear, which will be our 
next work. We believe there is a certain reading habit rule 
for each user. 
D. Gateway Response Time 
Because of particular communication structure, the total 
response time of Mobile Internet is relatively longer than 
PC-based Internet for one request process. Firstly, the WAP 
Gateway Response Time (GRT) accounts for a significant 
part while there is no such period in PC-based Internet. 
Secondly, computing the Mobile Internet response time for 
one request need take many environmental factors such as 
weather conditions, geographic location into consideration. 
In this part, we observed the response time of the two main 
elements on Mobile Internet and explored their relations. At 
the same time, the Viewing Time from Mobile Internet will 
be made comparison with it on the PC-based Internet. 
We observed the GRT for consecutive 168 hours and 
were looking forward to find its evolution with time. For 
better observation, the GRT for 168 hours was analyzed by 
dividing all the response time into several time ranges, and 
we explored how the different requests distribute in various 
time ranges, which is shown in Table III. 
After exploring the response time in detail, we give a 
macroscopical description on GRT distribution shown in 
Figure 9. It could be predicted from Table III, which exhibits 
most of requests were processed in a certain time range.

In Table IV, the K-S test was applied to measure the data 
set of the response time and no distribution was shown to be 
well fitted. The reason, through analysis, is that most of the 
requests were processed within the “normal” response time 
while few of requests for some reasons exceeded. Therefore, 
it is obvious to notice from Figure 10 that the curve is steep 
at beginning. The normal response time mentioned above 
refers to the response time within 20 milliseconds. We found 
that the normal response time well fitted the Weibull 
distribution through K-S test with c(α)=1.358 and 
significance level of α=0.05, which is shown in table 5 and 
Figure 10 demonstrate the CDF of aggregated normal 
response time. By visual inspection, we can find that the

CDF curve of Weibull distribution most closes to that of the 
sample. 
In [2], non-rejects of K-S test occur rarely because the 
large size of data sets generated by some underlying 
mechanisms cannot be easily modeled. In our experiment, 
frankly speaking we didn‟t make clear of detailed 
mechanism in WAP gateway but depicted the data set from 
statistic. We found that the goodness of fitness for a certain 
function distribution changed with its parameters when 
applying the K-S test to the data set. So the fitted distribution 
we give maybe not the best one, but we want to do is to give 
an appropriate and exact description to our samples and 
elaborate its properties. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
Considering the different network structures between 
Mobile Internet and PC-based Internet, we utilized the On-
Off model extended to understand how the user‟s behavior of 
browsing page influents traffic situation of Mobile Internet. 
Based on that, we built up a model for the user‟s page 
browsing behaviors on Mobile Internet. 
We performed an analysis of the traffic model by 
methods such as Hurst coefficient and K-S test with the data 
sets collected at the same period in 2010 and 2011 which 
also indicate a development of Mobile Internet in these two 
years. It was found that Traffic Volume was with the 
property of self-similarity; File Size followed Pareto 
distribution; Gateway Response Time followed Weibull 
distribution; yet the property of Viewing Time was hard to 
determine. These results are significantly valuable in 
assisting network operators to further optimize Mobile 
Internet network settings.  
However the further works is still necessary. In the future, 
we will study the browsing traffic model established in the 
paper more deeply. We could try to find out the relation 
between the parameters of this model. This will help us get a 
better understanding of traffic situation of Mobile Internet.
