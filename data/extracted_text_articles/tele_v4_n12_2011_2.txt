Abstract—High-altitude platforms (HAPs) are one of the most 
promising alternative infrastructures for realizing next 
generation mobile communications networks. This paper 
utilizes a recently proposed three-dimensional (3-D) reference 
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel model for 
HAPs and investigates the capacity of spatially and temporally 
correlated HAP-MIMO channels. The effect of several 
parameters, such as the elevation angle of the platform, the 
configuration and displacement of the antenna arrays, the 
Doppler spread, and the 3-D non-uniform distribution of the 
local scatterers, on the capacity is studied. Based on the 
reference model, a 3-D sum-of-sinusoids (SoS) deterministic 
simulation model for HAP-MIMO channels is proposed. The 
results show that the simulation model is a good approximation 
of the reference model.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Wireless communications services are traditionally 
provided by terrestrial and satellite systems. Terrestrial links 
are widely used to provide services in areas with complex 
propagation conditions, while satellite links are usually used 
to provide high-speed connections, where terrestrial 
infrastructure is not available. These systems represent two 
well established infrastructures that have been dominant in 
the telecommunications arena for years. Recently, an 
alternative wireless communications technology has emerged 
known as high-altitude platforms (HAPs) and has attracted 
considerable attention worldwide [1]-[6]. The term HAPs 
defines aerial platforms flying at an altitude of approximately 
20 km above the ground, in the stratosphere. Among the 
frequency bands that the International Telecommunication 
Union (ITU) has licensed for communications through HAPs 
is the 2 GHz frequency band for mobile communications 
services [7].  
The growing exigencies for spectral efficiency and higher 
data-rates have prompted the development of advanced 
physical layer techniques. Hence, it is crucial we apply 
and/or originate techniques in order to construct high-
performance HAP-based systems. At these measures, the 
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology is a 
potential candidate, since it can significantly upgrade the 
performance of wireless communications networks and 
surpass the conventional single-input single-output (SISO) 
technology [8]-[11]. The performance of MIMO systems 
strongly depends on the channel characteristics, which are 
mainly determined by the antenna configuration and the 
richness of scattering. Therefore, the signals coming from 
HAPs to terrestrial stations are affected by the physical 
environment and the geometrical characteristics of the link.  
Recently, the authors proposed a three-dimensional (3-D) 
geometry-based model for HAP-MIMO channels and 
justified its geometry [2]. In this paper, which is an extended 
and thorough version of [1], the reference model is utilized 
to analytically study the capacity of HAP-MIMO channels. 
Several parameters are considered, e.g., the elevation angle 
of the platform, the array configuration, the Doppler spread, 
and the 3-D non-isotropic distribution of the scatterers. The 
impact of each parameter on the capacity is separately 
examined and extensive numerical results are provided. The 
stratospheric winds may cause variations in the position of 
the platform [12][13]. Hence, this paper extends [1] and goes 
further to investigate the influence of any possible 
displacement of the HAP antennas on the channel capacity.  
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there are no 
experimental data available in the literature to verify the 
theoretical results. However, simulation of fading channels 
in software is commonly used as opposed to field trials, 
because it allows for cost-effective and time-saving system 
analysis, 
design, 
test, 
and 
verification. 
The 
prime 
requirement of a simulation set-up is to capture the fading 
effects created by the radio channel and the goal of any 
simulation model is to properly reproduce the channel 
properties. Many different methods have been adopted for 
the simulation of fading channels. Among them, the sum-of-
sinusoids (SoS) principle introduced by Rice [14] has been 
widely accepted by academia and industry as an adequate 
basis for the design of simulation models for cellular 
channels [15]-[17]. According to this principle, the overall 
channel waveform is the sum of several complex sinusoids 
having frequencies, amplitudes and phases that are 
appropriately selected to accurately approximate the desired 
statistical properties. Indeed, the complexity of the SoS-

based models is typically reduced by cleverly choosing the 
model parameters to reduce the computation load. 
Furthermore, SoS-based models can be easily extended to 
develop simulation channel models for MIMO systems due 
to their explicit inclusion of spatial information, e.g., the 
multipath angles of arrival and departure.  
Owing to these advantages, this paper proposes a 3-D 
deterministic SoS-based simulation model for HAP-MIMO 
channels. The deterministic models are easy to implement 
and have short simulation times. Specifically, they have 
fixed parameters for all simulation trials and converge to the 
desired properties in a single simulation trial leading to 
deterministic statistical properties [16]. The simulation 
results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed simulation 
model. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II 
briefly reviews the 3-D reference model, while Section III 
describes the channel statistics. Section IV studies the HAP-
MIMO channel capacity and provides numerical results. 
Section V details the deterministic simulation model and 
provides simulation results. Finally, concluding remarks are 
drawn in Section VI.

THE 3-D REFERENCE MODEL 
This 
paper 
considers 
a 
downlink 
HAP-MIMO 
communication channel with 
T
n  transmit and 
nR
 receive 
omni-directional antenna elements at a quasi-stationary 
Stratospheric Base Station (SBS) and a Terrestrial Mobile 
Station (TMS), respectively. The antennas are numbered as

 respectively. Frequencies 
well below 10 GHz are utilized. Hence, both line-of-sight 
(LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) links are considered, 
while rain effects are insignificant.  
The geometrical characteristics of the reference model 
and the definition of the Cartesian coordinate system are 
discussed in Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 shows the 3-D model 
for a 2 2

 HAP-MIMO channel, while Figure 2 presents the 
projection of this model to the 
-
x y  plane. Based on this 
simple configuration, uniform linear arrays (ULAs) with an 
arbitrary number of antennas can be constructed. The -axis
x
 
is the line that connects coordinate origin O  (centre of the 
projections of the SBS antenna elements to the -
x y  plane) 
and O  (lower center of the cylinder), while 
T
O  and 
R
O  
represent the centers of the SBS and TMS arrays, 
respectively. The elevation angle of SBS relative to 
R
O  is 
T
  and the heights of the SBS and TMS arrays are 
T
H  and 
HR ,
 respectively. Then, the distance between O  and O is 
/ tan
.

 The spacing between two adjacent antenna 
elements at the SBS and TMS is denoted by 
T
 and 
R ,
 
respectively, while 
Rl
aLoS
 denotes the azimuth angle of arrival 
(AAoA) of the LoS paths. The angles 
T
  and 
R
  represent 
the orientation of the SBS and TMS antenna arrays 
respectively, and the angle 
R
  describes the elevation angle 
of the th
l
 TMS antenna element. Moreover, TMS is moving 
with speed 
R
v  in the direction determined by the angle 
R.
 
It is assumed that N    scatterers in the vicinity of the 
TMS are non-uniformly distributed within a cylinder of 
radius 
RS,max
 and height 
HS,max
 [2]. Then, the 
nth

 Finally,

 denote the 
azimuth angle of departure (AAoD) of the waves that 
impinge on 
 
S n
 and the AAoA of the waves scattered from 
 ,
S n
 respectively. 
The displacement due to the winds or pressure variations 
of the stratosphere is a major problem to be faced [12], [13]. 
In practice, there are 6 degrees of freedom to which HAPs 
are subjected. Specifically, HAPs may be displaced in any 
direction at a varying speed, and the displacements can be 
shifting along the x-, y-, and z-axes, as well as roll, pitch, 
and yaw. Considering that SBS antenna elements are 
installed along the SBS, rotation with respect to the -axis
x
 
corresponds to pitch, rotation on the -axis
y
 corresponds to 
roll and rotation along 
z-axis
 corresponds to yaw (see 
Figure 1). Note that pitch corresponds to an elevation of the 
pth
 SBS antenna element, which is described by the angle 
T .
 For ease of reference, the parameters of the reference 
model are summarized in Table I.

CAPACITY ANALYSIS OF 3-D HAP-MIMO CHANNELS 
In this section, the HAP-MIMO channel capacity is 
defined and the utility of the reference model is 
demonstrated. Numerical results are provided and the 
influence of the model parameters on the capacity is studied. 
It is assumed that the channel is known to the TMS and 
unknown to the SBS. Then, the HAP-MIMO channel

A. Numerical Results 
This subsection investigates the effect of the model 
parameters on the capacity of space-time correlated HAP-
MIMO channels. These parameters control the correlation 
between the subchannels [2]. In particular, the correlation

the matrix into a column vector. Specifically, the vectorization of a 


 column vector obtained by 
stacking the columns of the matrix A  on top of one another. 
depends on the degree of scattering in a specific propagation 
environment and the antenna inter-element spacing at both 
the transmitter and the receiver. Hence, dense scattering in 
the propagation environment in combination with adequate 
antenna spacing ensure decorrelation. Considering coherent 
diffuse components or sparse scattering and increased 
correlation, the rank of the channel matrix is deficient and 
the spectral efficiency is low. Therefore, the model 
parameters control the performance issues, i.e., the spatial 
multiplexing gain and the capacity enhancement. Unless 
indicated otherwise, the values of the model parameters used 
to obtain the curves are

 architecture by varying the Ricean factor 
and the received SNR. One observes that maximum capacity 
is obtained in an ideal HAP-MIMO Rayleigh channel 
scenario. Then, the capacity increases up to 10.6 bps/Hz 
compared to the capacity of a HAP-SISO channel. However, 
the potential MIMO gain drastically degrades with the 
strength of the LoS component, i.e., increasing the Ricean 
factor increases the correlation and decreases the capacity 
gain. Providing that the propagation conditions are 
characterized by rich multipath, e.g., in dense urban areas, 
the benefits of MIMO technology can be even more 
obvious. On the contrary, HAP-SISO channels take 
advantage of the existence of a strong LoS signal, i.e., 
increasing the Ricean factor drastically increases the 
capacity. Note that the difference in capacity between HAP-
MIMO and HAP-SISO architectures increases, as the SNR 
increases. However, this difference is nullified, when the 
SNR is low. Then, the rank of the channel matrix plays an 
important role. In addition, the channel capacity achieved 
using both architectures is invariable for 
K 10 dB.
 
Figures 5-9 investigate the effect of spatial correlation on 
the channel capacity. Figure 5 shows the ergodic capacity as 
a function of the spacing

capacity. According to [3], [4], HAPs are either airships (up 
to 200 m in length) or aircrafts (up to 30 m in length). 
Considering 2.1 GHz carrier frequency [7], the wavelength is 
equal to approximately 0.14 m. Hence, Figure 5 implies that 
applying MIMO techniques to a single HAP offers 
considerable capacity gain, as soon as the Ricean is small. 
Figure 6 depicts the complementary cumulative 
distribution function (CCDF) of the capacity and examines 
the effect of SBS antenna array orientation on the capacity. 
One observes that SBS broadside antenna arrays, i.e., 
90 ,
T

  provide maximum capacity. Moreover, decreasing 
T
  from 90  to 60  has a negligible effect on the capacity. 
However, further decrease of 
T
  significantly decreases the 
capacity. The capacity also depends on the relative angle 
between the TMS antenna array and the local scatterers 
around the TMS, i.e., 
R - ,
  and is maximized when the 
difference between 
R
  and   is 90  [17].

Figure 7 depicts depicts the CCDF of the capacity and 
examines the influence of the parameters ,k  ,a  and 
RS,max
 
on the capacity, i.e., the influence of two-dimensional (2-D) 
scattering. The effect of each parameter is examined 
independently (keeping all other parameters fixed). Note 
that as k  increases, the scattering becomes increasingly 
non-isotropic and the capacity decreases (due to the increase 
in spatial correlation [2]). Moreover, increasing a  decreases 
the spread of scatterers and decreases the capacity (due to 
the increase in spatial correlation [2]). However, changing 
RS,max
 has a negligible effect on the capacity and the spatial 
correlation [2].  
Figure 8 shows the CCDF of the capacity, when the TMS 
antenna array is horizontally, i.e., 
0 ,
R

  or vertically 
placed, i.e., 
90 ,
R


 for different 
HS,mean.
 Note that 
changing 
HS,mean
 has an insignificant influence on the 
capacity, when the TMS antenna array is horizontally placed. 
However, the capacity depends on the degree of 
urbanization, i.e., the heights of the scatterers, when the TMS 
antenna array is vertically placed. Then, increasing 
HS,mean
 
increases the capacity. The difference between capacities of 
systems with horizontally and vertically placed TMS antenna 
array is nullified in highly urbanized areas. Figure 8 suggests 
that if the available area in the 
-
x y  plane is limited for 
antenna array realization, the TMS antenna array can be 
tilted without significant loss of capacity.  
Figure 9 examines the effect of the temporal correlation 
by separately varying the normalized Doppler frequency 
nf  
and the moving direction 
 R
 of the TMS. Observe that an 
increase in 
nf  results in an increase in channel capacity due 
to the decrease in temporal correlation. Furthermore, as 
R
 
increases (up to 180 ), the TMS moves toward the SBS and 
the channel capacity increases.

Figures 10 and 11 investigate the effect of HAP antenna 
displacement due to the stratospheric winds on the capacity 
of HAP-MIMO channels. The influence of each degree of 
freedom on the capacity is examined independently (keeping 
all other parameters fixed) in the following figures. Roll and 
pitch can be considered identical to each other, since both are 
based on similar principles. In addition, yaw corresponds to a 
change in the orientation of the SBS antenna array, which is 
described by the angle 
T
  Therefore, Figure 6 represents 
also the yaw effect and the effect of only pitch and yaw on 
the capacity is studied. 
Figure 10 demonstrates the influence of up to 5 km 
shifting along either -,
x
-
y  or -axis
z
 on the capacity. One 
observes that the capacity is relatively insensitive to 
displacements along -
y  and -axis.
z
 However, the capacity 
fairly decreases up to 0.5 bps/Hz or 4%, when the 
displacement takes place along x-axis.  
Figure 11 depicts the effect of pitch on the capacity. 
Note that increasing 
T
 from 0  to 45  has a negligible 
effect on the capacity. However, further increase in 
T
  
drastically decreases the capacity.  
V. 
SIMULATION OF 3-D HAP-MIMO CHANNELS 
The reference model assumes an infinite number of 
scatterers and prevents practical implementation. Hence, 
simulation models with finite number of scatterers are 
desirable. Under the framework of the reference model, a 
stochastic simulation model can be directly obtained by 
using a finite number N  of scatterers. Then, considering a 
Ricean HAP-MIMO channel, the impulse response of the 
sub-channel 
-
p l  associated with the stochastic simulation 
model is given by

However, due to the high degree of randomness during the 
computation of these variables, an infinite number of 
simulation trials is required and the stochastic simulation 
model is still non-realizable and inefficient. Hence, one 
must otherwise determine the model parameters, in order to 
fully exploit the inherent advantages of the SoS principle. 
This procedure is called the parameter computation method 
and the type of a simulation model is directly related to this 
method. 
A. A 3-D Deterministic Simulation Model 
This subsection proposes a SoS-based deterministic 
simulation model for HAP-MIMO channels and derives the

can be fully described by

 the entire 
scattering region is considered as a 3-D point lattice 
partitioned into three scattering sub-regions, which are 
individually associated with one of these random variables. 
In particular, it is considered that

N  scattering points are 
non-uniformly placed around a ring, 
2
N  scattering points 
are non-uniformly placed along a radial line, and

Notwithstanding, the interest reader is referred to [28],

Following a similar approach to that proposed in [17], the

 Hence, 
the proposed deterministic model computes constant values 
for the model parameters, needs a single run to obtain the 
desired statistical properties and hence has short simulation 
times. However, it is important to properly determine the 
number of scattering points, i.e.,

to achieve a desired convergence level. Indeed, the 
complexity of the deterministic simulation model is 
controlled by 
N1,
 
N2,
 and 
N3.
 Thus, 
N1,
 
N2,
 and 
3
N  
should be carefully determined to reduce the computation 
load of the complete channel simulator and improve the 
efficiency and the reliability of the proposed model. 
The MIMO channel models are generally classified into 
physical or non-physical (analytical) models based on the 
modeling philosophy [29]. Physical channel models depend 
on the characteristics of the propagation environment and 
allow for an accurate reproduction of the real channel. On 
the contrary, non-physical models synthesize the MIMO 
channel matrix in the context of system and algorithm 
development and verification and can be further subdivided 
into propagation-motivated models and correlation-based 
models.  
Due to the different way of generation of 
HNLoS ,
 the 
reference model is referred to as the non-physical model, 
while the deterministic model is referred to as the physical 
model. In particular, the reference model generates the 
elements of 
HNLoS
 using (11)-(14), (19) and (20). On the 
contrary, the deterministic model generates the elements of 
HNLoS
 using (30) and hence 
HNLoS
 is given by

The goal of any simulation model is to reproduce the 
channel's desired statistical properties. Figures 12 and 13 
investigate the performance of the deterministic model for 
different complexity, i.e., different 
N1,
 
N2,
 and 
N3,

terms of the temporal correlation function (TCF), i.e.,

 respectively. As 
soon as the value of the Ricean factor is sufficiently small, 
the maximum values of the range of the inter-element 
distances chosen, i.e., 200  and 3 ,
  ensure low spatial 
correlation in many propagation scenarios, as shown in [2]. 
The effect of the variation of each number of coordinates of 
scattering points is examined independently, provided that 
the other numbers are sufficiently large and do not affect the 
simulation results. The performance evaluation is realized in 
terms of the root mean square error (RMSE) between the 
absolute TCFs and SCFs of the simulation model and the 
reference model. According to Figures 12 and 13, the 
performance can be improved by increasing the number of 
the discrete local scatterers, i.e., 
N1,
 
N2,
 and 
N3,
 and thus 
the complexity of the proposed model. Figures 12 and 13 
also suggest that reasonable values for 
1
N  (associated 
with
aR
), 
2
N  (associated with 
S
R ), and 
3
N  (associated 
with

model and the reference model is 0.026 for N1 = 30, N2 = 20, 
and N3 = 5, and 0.018 for N1 = 40, N2 = 30, and N3 = 10. 
Hence, increasing the number of scatterers, enhances the 
performance of the deterministic model.

) obtained using 
the reference and the deterministic models. The results show 
very good agreement between the non-physical and the 
physical models and verify the usefulness of the proposed 
simulation model. These results also show that increasing 
the number of antenna elements, increases the prospective 
MIMO capacity gain. Nevertheless, when multiple antenna 
elements are utilized, these antenna elements should be 
placed at significant distances from each other to ensure that 
the paths are really diverse. Hence, the HAP length should be 
adequate to accommodate two or more antenna elements.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, the channel capacity of a HAP-based 
communications system equipped with multi-element 
antennas at both sides has been defined and investigated. 
Specifically, the capacity has been studied taking into 
account a recently proposed 3-D reference model for HAP-
MIMO channels. The numerical results have demonstrated 
that the MIMO architecture outperforms the conventional 
SISO architecture in terms of the channel capacity. These 
results have also shown that the capacity depends on the 
strength of the LoS signal and the received SNR. 
Specifically, increasing the Ricean factor decreases the 
capacity, while increasing the SNR and the number of 
antenna elements increases the capacity. Furthermore, the 
results have underlined the effects of spatial and temporal 
correlation on the capacity of ULAs and have suggested that 
applying MIMO techniques to a single HAP can effectively 
enhance the capacity, as soon as the Ricean factor is small. 
In particular, the influence of the elevation angle of the 
platform, the antenna configuration and displacement, the 
mobility of the terrestrial station, and the non-uniform 
distribution of the local scatterers on the capacity has been 
analyzed. It has been shown that increasing the elevation 
angle of the platform increases the capacity, while increasing 
the density of the scatterers in the vicinity of the user and the 
spacing between the antennas increases the capacity. 
Moreover, broadside HAP antennas maximize the capacity, 
while vertically placed antennas at the mobile terminal 
provide considerable capacity gain in highly urbanized areas. 
Finally, the results have underlined that changing the 
velocity and the moving direction of the user significantly 
affects the capacity. From the non-realizable reference 
model, a 3-D deterministic simulation model for HAP-
MIMO mobile fading channels has been proposed. The 
simulation results have shown that the simulation model 
satisfactorily approximates the reference one in terms of the 
correlation properties and the channel capacity.  
The capacity analysis and the proposed deterministic 
simulation model provide a convenient framework for the 
analysis, design, test, and optimization of future HAP-
MIMO communications systems. Nevertheless, this work 
could be further improved or extended into different areas. 
Due to the lack of channel-sounding measurement 
campaigns, the contribution of this work has been limited to 
developing a simulation model for HAP-MIMO channels. 
However, it is important to verify the theoretical model in 
real-world propagation conditions. Specifically, HAPs could 
be emulated by using a helicopter, a small plane or a balloon

containing two or more antennas sufficiently separated. 
However, access to a real HAP would be even more ideal. In 
addition, the analysis in this paper is restricted to HAP-
MIMO systems employing ULAs at both sides of the 
communication link. The HAP-MIMO channel models can 
be modified to employ other antenna array geometries, such 
as uniform planar arrays (UPAs), uniform circular arrays 
(UCAs), and spherical antenna arrays (SAAs), or a 
combination of them. Apart from considering only single-
bounce rays, this work can also be extended to additionally 
support double-bounce or multiple-bounce rays (due to 
multiple scattering, reflection or diffraction of the radiated 
energy). Then, more sophisticated and realistic channel 
models can be obtained. Finally, there is perhaps an 
opportunity to extend the material in the paper by taking into 
account the energy efficiency issues, i.e., investigating the 
impact of possible power constraints at the wireless devices 
on the available channel capacity of HAP-MIMO channels.
