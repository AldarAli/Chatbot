Abstract‚Äî It is essential to synchronize the receiver and the 
transmitter during any transmission. In a given receiver, the 
sensitivity of the synchronization system is usually higher than 
the sensitivity of the detection system. The performance of the 
synchronization system and the detection system in a given 
receiver depends on the signal to noise ratio at the input of the 
receiver. Phase noise must be carefully considered when 
applying any signal processing method, which involves 
synchronization. The effect of amplitude noise on the sensitivity 
of the receiver is a well-studied subject. On the other hand, the 
impact of phase noise on the phase synchronization process is 
not well-studied in literature. In this paper, the effect of phase 
noise on the Minimum Shift Keying (MSK) modulator is 
studied. The Bit Error Rate (BER) is used to demonstrate the 
impact of the different phase noise levels. Based on the 
simulation results we can conclude that the effect of phase noise 
on the synchronization system is negligible.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The communication range and power efficiency are 
considered among the most critical issues for system design 
in the domain of Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) 
technologies dedicated to the Internet of Things (IoT) 
communication.  
All LPWAN standards and technologies, such as SigFox 
[1], LoRa [2], Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) [3], try to increase 
their efficiency in terms of both power consumption and data 
range. There are strict limitations by communication 
regulators like the Federal Communications Commission 
(FCC) [4] and the European Telecommunications Standards 
Institute (ETSI) [5]. These factors are related directly to the 
receiver sensitivity. Increasing the receiver sensitivity 
improves the link budget, which increases (under certain 
circumstances) the propagation distance. 
A well-known technique to improve the receiver 
sensitivity is to increase the bandwidth, which can be viewed 
as a solution in the frequency domain. For example, in the 
spread spectrum technique, a narrow-band signal spreads 
over a wider frequency band. The power remains the same, 
but the power spectral density decreased as the signal spreads 
over a larger band and the receiver sensitivity improvement 
is related to the spreading factor.  
Another solution to increase the sensitivity of the receiver 
is to decrease the data rate. Retransmitting the signal and 
process it later in the receiver is an example of this method. 
This can be viewed as spreading the signal over the time of 
the transmission (a time-domain solution).  
In [6], the Time Synchronous Averaging (TSA) method 
is proposed to increase the sensitivity of a digital receiver 
based on the signal retransmission. It is shown that the 
synchronization system limits the performance of the TSA 
method. A new synchronization method was developed later. 
The performance of the TSA method with this new 
synchronization method is presented in [7]. Processing the 
signals and extracting the synchronization information from 
the transmitted signal with very low Signal to Noise Ratio 
(SNR) (even signals with SNR smaller than 1) is possible 
with this new synchronization method. TSA method is widely 
used in communications [8], medicine [9], mechanics [10], 
electronics and all scientific fields which treat periodic weak 
signals corrupted by noise [11].  
Generally speaking, in the TSA method, the sampling is 
initiated by a trigger pulse as an input to the analyzer. These 
trigger pulses must be synchronized with the periodic signal. 
Time alignment is an essential parameter to the analysis of 
the repetitive signals, especially in the TSA method [12].  
The efficiency of the TSA method is limited by the 
synchronization of the received data blocks. Synchronization 
is divided into synchronization in phase and frequency. Phase 
noise impacts the synchronization by varying the length of 
the repetitive data. The oscillator phase noise is presented 
briefly in Section II. Section III presents the applied method 
to study and simulate the effect of phase noise. In Section IV, 
the simulation results for the effect of the phase noise on the 
MSK modulator are presented. In this section, the phase noise 
effect is also simulated for a given transceiver, and the results 
are compared with other RF components. We conclude the 
work in Section V. 
II. PHASE NOISE IN LOCAL OSCILLATOR

any random fluctuation in the phase of a waveform in the 
frequency domain is presented by phase noise. Oscillator

imperfection is one of the primary sources of phase noise. 
The noise in the local oscillator could be some multiplicative 
phase distortion during the up/down conversion at the 
transmitter and the receiver. The intensity of this noise 
depends on the quality of the RF component used in the 
transmitter/receiver.  
Phase noise could be regarded as either natural phase 
noise caused by the local oscillator itself or ‚Äúexternal‚Äù phase 
noise caused by vibration. In both cases, it is an essential 
problem for dynamic applications. The natural phase noise is 
mostly because of the oscillator‚Äôs frequency instabilities. It is 
relevant for both static and dynamic applications. Any net 
changes in phase angle will result in an inaccuracy in the 
output frequency. The stability of the output frequency of the 
local oscillator is essential for any synchronization method. 
The output signal of a typical oscillator in the presence of the 
amplitude and phase noise is: 
 
ùëâ(ùë°) = ùê¥( sin(2ùúãùëì( ùë° + ‚àÜ‚àÖ(ùë°)) 
 
(1) 
 
A0 is the nominal peak voltage and will establish the SNR 
and ‚àÜ‚àÖ(ùë°) represents the phase noise. Fig. 1 [13] presents the 
effect of phase noise on the oscillator output signal. 
 
 
Figure 1. Oscillator output signal in the presence of phase noise 
All oscillators have an amplitude limiting mechanism. 
The amplitude fluctuations are usually significantly 
attenuated and could be almost completely removed from the 
carrier at some frequencies [14]. Despite amplitude noise, the 
phase noise could not be reduced or filtered as it is very close 
to the carrier. However, phase noise in an oscillator can be 
reduced by various architecture choices and manufacturing 
technologies. The bipolar transistor and the Heterojunction 
Bipolar Transistor (HBT) are more efficient compared to the 
Field-Effect Transistors (FET), for example. 
The Leeson model is essential to illustrate the phase noise 
spectrum concerning the carrier. The model is simple and 
effective and forms the theoretical basis of an oscillator phase 
noise. It is expressed as the following formula [15] and [16]:

spectral density, F is the noise figure, k is the Boltzmann 
constant and equals to 1.38x10-23 (J/K), T is the absolute

frequency, fc is the corner frequency, f0 is the carrier 
frequency, and QL is the loaded quality facture. The phase 
noise curve based on (2) is illustrated in Fig. 2 [16].

The phase noise shows various behaviours depending on 
the frequency region and the distance from the carrier 
frequency. For example, a 1/f 3 noise (30 dB per octave) is 
respected for the frequencies which are very close to the 
offset frequency. The Leeson model suggests increasing the 
resonator Q and signal amplitudes as a solution to reduce the 
phase noise. In this research, we are mostly focused on this 
region.  
III. METHODOLOGY 
 
Regarding the application goal (synchronization for the 
TSA method), the communication range, the receiver 
complexity as well as the energy efficiency, the MSK 
modulation technique was used in these simulations. The 
simulations were done in Matlab by generating the 
transmission data with time series. Amplitude noise and 
phase noise were added to the transmitted signal via Additive 
White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel and the phase noise 
block, respectively. The schematic of the simulation model is 
presented in Fig. 3.  The simulation results are compared with 
theoretical BER for the MSK modulation to examine the 
accuracy of the proposed models.

modulation with Phase noise block in Simulink 
BER graphs are used to demonstrate the results. The 
precision of the BER graph depends on the number of 
transmitted bits. The Monte-Carlo [17] method is a common 
technique for estimating the BER of a communication 
system. The number of required data symbols to achieve the 
desired accuracy is [18]:

œÉn2 is the normalized variance of the estimation error and 
Pe is the desired bit error rate. The small value of BER 
requires a considerable number of transmitted symbols. 
Otherwise, the estimation variation shall be significant when 
the error is too small. For example, N ‚âà 100/pe is needed 
while counting 100 errors for œÉ = 0.1. Therefore, at least 108 
bits are needed to study a system with BER of 10-6. 
The BER was calculated by comparing the received and 
the transmitted signals. Fig. 4 presents the BER result with 
no additive phase noise in comparison with the theoretical 
BER graph of the MSK modulation. From this figure, the 
reliability of simulation models can be justified. The BER 
result from the proposed simulation method follows precisely 
the theoretical curve of the BER of the MSK modulation. To 
calculate the BER with higher precision, we need to transmit 
and process more bits, which will increase the time of 
calculation significantly. The difference between the two 
graphs of BER at the very low BER value is due to this issue. 
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS 
The BER graphs at different phase noise levels were 
traced for different values of the bit energy over the noise 
variance (Eb/N0) to study the effect of phase noise on the 
efficiency of the communication systems in terms of BER for 
the MSK modulation. In each run of the simulation, Eb/N0 
varied from 1 to10 dB for a constant level of phase noise. In 
Fig. 5, the BER for different values of Phase Noise Level 
(PNL) from -96 to -80 dBc/Hz are presented. These results 
are compared with the BER for the MSK modulation in 
theory. By varying the phase noise level from -96 dBc/Hz up 
to -80 dBc/Hz, the bit error rate varies from almost the 
theoretical BER (for -96dBc/Hz) to the weakest BER result 
(at -80 dBc/Hz). The effect of phase noise on the MSK 
modulator is negligible for PNL equal or below -90 dBc/Hz,.  
It is possible to simulate the phase noise effect for a 
specific RF component. In this case, a set of different phase 
noise levels are attributed to different frequencies. This 
information usually comes with the RF component datasheet. 
The precision of the simulation increases by having more data 
about the component phase noise level at different 
frequencies.

Figure 5. Phase noise effect on the MSK modulator, PNL from -96 to -80 
dBc/Hz  
Here, we consider the phase noise level for ADF-7021-V, 
which is a standard RF transceiver. The frequency offset 
were: [10Hz, 100Hz, 1000Hz] and the corresponding phase 
noise level for these frequencies were: [-71.5, -82, -92.5] 
dBc/Hz. Fig. 6 presents the result of the simulation in the 
presence of phase noise (in yellow) and without phase noise 
(in orange), in comparison with the theoretical BER for the 
MSK modulation (in blue).  
 
Figure 6. Simulated effect of phase noise on ADF7021 transceiver  
(without phase noise (red) and with Phase noise (orange)) 
The simulation results with and without phase noise are 
almost the same. As we can see, the phase noise does not have 
a significant impact on the BER of the MSK modulation. 
These results should be compared with the phase noise 
level of other RF components. Tables I, II  and III present the 
phase noise level for a standard RF transceiver, a mixer and 
a synthesizer, respectively. From these tables, we can note the 
maximum phase noise level of presented components and 
compare their phase noise level with the simulation results. 
The highest phase noise level in these tables is equal to -106 
dBc/Hz for Si4464 at 460 MHz with ¬±10 kHz offset. 
 Respecting the simulation results, we conclude that the 
impact of the phase noise on the MSK modulator is 
negligible. This conclusion is proven with experimental tests 
for the transmission of a very noisy signal (SNR¬ª0.3dB). The 
results of experimental tests were published in [7].

V. CONCLUSION 
LPWAN, as a novel communication paradigm, has been 
investigated as a solution which improves the communication 
range while enhancing power efficiency. These parameters 
can be enhanced by increasing the sensitivity of the receiver. 
Any variation in the frequency stability of the local oscillator 
has an impact on synchronization. In this article, the effect of 
phase noise was studied on the MSK modulator. The results 
of the simulation model were first compared to the theoretical 
result to verify the reliability of the proposed model. Various 
phase noise levels were analyzed and the results were 
compared with standard RF components. BER was used to 
compare the effect of phase noise for different signal energy 
levels. The simulation model was customized to study a 
specific RF transceiver (ADF7021). 
By comparing the phase noise level for standard RF 
components and the simulation results, we can conclude that 
the effect of phase noise on the MSK modulator is negligible. 
Performing the TSA method during experimental tests on a 
very noisy signal (SNR around 0.3dB) presents the same 
results.
