Abstract—In this paper, we study a performance analysis of a 
surveillance camera system with image recognition server based 
on frame discard rate and server utilization. The states of 
surveillance cameras are divided into recognition and silence 
states to analyze the parameters, such as the optimal number of 
image frames and cameras based on processing capacity of the 
recognition server. The result of the analysis will be useful for 
effective operation of the evolving surveillance camera systems.

 INTRODUCTION 
The image recognition server located in the central 
surveillance system can perform well when receiving as many 
image frames as possible from the surveillance cameras. 
However, the surveillance system operator may not allow 
frames to be transmitted continuously because it must pay a 
lot to the network depending on the number of transmitted 
image frames. Therefore, in this paper, we consider a system 
where the image recognition server analyzes the received 
image frames from surveillance cameras and determine 
whether there is an object of interest, and accordingly sets the 
state of each surveillance camera to a recognition state for 
transmitting a large number of frames and a silence state for 
transmitting a small number of frames. In such a surveillance 
camera network system, the system operator also needs to 
optimize the number of cameras arranged in accordance with 
the processing capacity of the image recognition server. 
Many researches have been conducted on the number of 
transmission frames, network bandwidth and security method 
in surveillance camera systems. In [1], an optimal scheduling 
has been studied for storing the camera image data based on 
the network bandwidth and limited processing resources in the 
CCTV(Closed-Circuit TeleVision) system. In [2], the authors 
proposed a method to provide streaming service over HTTP 
(HyperText Transfer Protocol) by interworking with user and 
server. In this method, the user can predict the next segment 
resolution by providing current channel resource information. 
In this paper, we perform a numerical analysis and discuss 
results in Section 2 and make a conclusion in Section 3. 
II. 
ANALYTICAL MODEL AND NUMERICAL RESULTS 
In the analysis, we assume that N surveillance cameras are 
connected to the image recognition server through the 
surveillance network. The image recognition server analyzes 
the arrived image frame and sets the camera to a recognition 
state with frame rate 𝑅𝑅𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟  when the object of interest is 
recognized, otherwise sets it to a silence state with frame rate 
𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 ( 𝑅𝑅𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟> 𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠). Figure 1 shows the transition between the 
two states in surveillance cameras where the recognition and 
silence states of each camera alternate, and we assume that 
this transition process is independent of other cameras. This 
assumption is not appropriate when the surveillance cameras 
are concentrated at a short distance. However, in this study, 
we assume that the surveillance cameras are scattered in a 
large area. Also, for the sake of analysis, it is assumed that the 
state characteristics of all cameras are the same. 
 
 
Figure 1.  Transitions between recognition and silence states of 
surveillance cameras. 
In Figure 1, we represent the recognition state interval 
length as a r.v. (random variable) 𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 and the silence state 
interval length as a r.v. 𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠. We assume that the number of 
frames processed per second in the image recognition server 
(processing capacity) is C. Generally, the surveillance system 
is effective in real-time monitoring, therefore we assume that 
the image recognition server has a small waiting queue to 
guarantee real-time performance and we also assume that for 
the sake of analysis, any frames received beyond the server 
capacity C in seconds are discarded. 
Based on the above assumptions, the probability of a 
surveillance camera being in the recognition state and in the 
silence state are given as 𝑃𝑃𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 =
𝐸𝐸(𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟)
𝐸𝐸(𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟)+𝐸𝐸(𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠) and 𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 1 −
𝑃𝑃𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟, where E(⋅) is the expected value. Also, the probability 
that k cameras are in the recognition state can be calculated as 
𝑃𝑃𝑘𝑘 = ൫𝑁𝑁
𝑘𝑘൯(𝑃𝑃𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟)𝑘𝑘(1 − 𝑃𝑃𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟)𝑁𝑁−𝑘𝑘 , (0≤k≤N). In terms of 
reasonable operation, the minimum total number of 
transmitted frames per second should be equal to or less than 
the processing capacity C. Also, processing capacity C should 
be equal to or less than the maximum total number of 
transmitted frames per second. That is 𝑁𝑁⋅𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 ≤ 𝐶𝐶 ≤ 𝑁𝑁⋅𝑅𝑅𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟.

The average total number of frames transmitted per second is 
𝑁𝑁⋅𝑃𝑃𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟⋅𝑅𝑅𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟  + 𝑁𝑁⋅(1 − 𝑃𝑃𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟)⋅𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 . If the server processing 
capacity C is designed to be equal to 𝑁𝑁⋅𝑅𝑅𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟, there will be no 
frames that are not processed by the server and discarded. 
However, in this case, the waste of processing capacity of the 
server is on average C −𝑁𝑁⋅𝑃𝑃𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟⋅𝑅𝑅𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 − 𝑁𝑁⋅(1 − 𝑃𝑃𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟)⋅𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 
frames per second. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the 
utilization of the server by allowing some frames to be 
discarded. Thus, we analyze the relationship between the 
processing capacity of the server, the number of discarded 
frames, and the number of cameras. Given the server capacity 
C, the corresponding number of cameras m can be calculated 
using C=𝑚𝑚⋅𝑅𝑅𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟+(𝑁𝑁 − 𝑚𝑚)⋅𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 where m is an integer that is 
equal to m = ቔ
𝐶𝐶−𝑁𝑁⋅𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠
𝑅𝑅𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟−𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠ቕ. Now the expected average number of 
frames that are discarded without processing at the server is: 
 
𝐹𝐹𝑑𝑑𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑟𝑟𝑑𝑑𝑟𝑟𝑑𝑑𝑟𝑟𝑑𝑑 = ∑
𝑃𝑃𝑘𝑘⋅[𝑘𝑘⋅𝑅𝑅𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 + (𝑁𝑁 − 𝑘𝑘)⋅𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 − 𝐶𝐶]
𝑁𝑁
𝑘𝑘=𝑚𝑚+1

In this study, two performance measures are considered. 
The first is the ratio of the number of frames that are discarded 
at the server to the server's processing capacity that we call 
Discarded Ratio (DR). The discarded frames consume 
network resources without being processed at the server. So 
the larger the number, the greater the inefficiency. The second 
is the utilization of the server, ρ, which is expressed as a ratio 
of the number of frames actually processed by the server to 
the capacity of the server. High utilization means the high 
operation efficiency of the server. 
DR is calculated as

DR  =

Figures 2 and 3 are numerical results of the analysis when 
C=100, 𝑅𝑅𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 =5, 𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 1 and 𝑃𝑃𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5.

 Figure 2 shows the relationship between DR and N, and 
Figure 3 shows the relationship between ρ and N. As shown 
in Figures 2 and 3, when designing DR = 0 which means no 
frames to be discarded at the server, the number of 
surveillance cameras is limited to N = 20. However, in this 
case, the utilization, ρ, is 28%, 36%, 44% 52%, 60% for 𝑃𝑃𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 
= 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 respectively, which means the server 
efficiency is not high as one expects. To increase the server 
efficiency, we need to allow some value of DR. For example, 
when DR=0.01 (1%), and 𝑃𝑃𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟= 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, the 
number of cameras can be increased to N= 64, 49, 40, 34, 29, 
respectively. In this case, the server utilization is 88.8%, 
87.3%, 87.1%, 87.4%, 86.4% respectively. Hence, as we 
allow the number of unprocessed and thus discarded frames at 
the server to be 1% of the server processing capacity, the 
utilization of the server rapidly increases to 86% through 89%. 
III. 
CONCLUSION 
In this study, we analyzed two performance factors that are 
required for an efficient surveillance camera system with 
image recognition server, i.e., server utilization and frame 
discard rate. We believe the results obtained in this study will 
be useful for the efficient design and operation of surveillance 
camera system, which has been widely used recently.
