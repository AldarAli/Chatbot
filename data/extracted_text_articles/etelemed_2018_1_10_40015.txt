Abstract—In the present work, changes of the overall quality of
life and general health related to the retirement threshold are
studied. In particular, the inﬂuence of different factors on the
satisfaction with health and the quality of life is evaluated. The
results show that education, job position and activity, as e.g., the
attendance of the University of the Third Age, strongly inﬂuence
the satisfaction level on the overall quality of life and general
health after the retirement threshold.

INTRODUCTION
Usually, critical moments in our life inﬂuence our lifestyle
and health. One of the most important moments is the retire-
ment. Changes in health related to the retirement threshold
have been observed in numerous studies [1]-[6]. In particular,
changes of the physical activity [2][7]-[17] and changes of the
quality of life in different domains [18]-[22] have been broadly
discussed. Some problems may be speciﬁc for particular
countries, as for example depression related to the loss of the
employment-based insurance [3]. Aging is a natural process,
however different factors may inﬂuence it. In particular, a high
level of education is known to have a positive inﬂuence on
health and on the quality of life. Recently, Universities of the
Third Age (U3A) became popular, and their positive inﬂuence
is broadly discussed [23]-[28].
In this article, we focus on the problem from the Polish
perspective. We concentrate on changes in the overall quality
of life and general health related to the retirement threshold.
The article is organized as follows: in Section II we
describe the applied methods, in Section III we describe the
groups of the individuals who participated in the studies and
the results related to the overall quality of life and to the
general health. A summary is given in Section IV.
II.
METHODS
The studies are concerned with the Polish society. In
order to check changes of the quality of life and of health
after the retirement threshold, we compare the results for the
employees and for the retirees. The quality of life and health
have been determined by using the Polish version of the World
Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF)
questionnaire [29]. Additionally, each respondent answered
several question about his/her education and the job position
during the employment.
For the graphical representation of the results we apply the
correspondence analysis originally introduced by Hirschfeld
[30] and later improved by many authors. In this method,
one obtains maps in which the objects under consideration
are represented by points. In the present studies, the points
represent particular groups of individuals and the answers to
the questions. This kind of approach has an interdisciplinary
character. In particular, we have created an analog of this kind
of method in the theory of molecular similarity [31] and in
bioinformatics [32].
III.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The sample consists of 449 individuals who are the citizens
of one of the Polish cities, Bydgoszcz, about 350 000 citizens.
In the studies the whole group of individuals is split to 160
employees (100 females and 60 males) and 289 retirees (186
females and 103 males). Additionally, the group of retirees is
split to two subgroups: 106 students of U3A (79 females and
27 males) and 183 non-students of U3A (107 females and 76
males).
In the present work, we study the overall quality of life
and general health. Figures 1-9 show maps obtained using
the correspondence analysis. Figure 1 shows the degree of
satisfaction on the overall quality of life and general health
of particular groups of individuals with vocational education
in a 3-point scale (positive, negative, neutral). Figures 2 and 3

present the same relations but for the individuals with different
education: high school (Figure 2) and university (Figure 3).
These relations are also shown in a 5-point scale (A-1,A-2,...A-
5) for the individuals with the vocational education (Figure
4), with the high school (Figure 5) and with the university
education (Figure 6). The number of individuals with doctor’s
degree is small and therefore the correspondence analysis can
be applied only to the 3-point scale (Figure 7). Figures 8 and
9 show the degree of satisfaction on the overall quality of
life and general health of particular groups of individuals with
different job positions in the 3-point scale (Figure 8) and in
the 5-point scale (Figure 9).

Figure 1. Map obtained using the correspondence analysis (rectangles denote
groups of individuals with vocational education, circles denote answers in
3-point scale).
In all the ﬁgures, two kinds of points appear: empty
rectangles and full circles. Empty rectangles denote three
different subgroups of individuals: employees, retirees1 (non-
students of U3A), and retirees2 (students of U3A). Full circles
denote answers to the questions in the WHOQOL-BREF
questionnaire. The answers are labeled as A-1, A-2, ...A-5
in Figures 4, 5, 6, and 9, respectively. The respondents could
choose between these ﬁve answers, where A-1 corresponds to
very poor quality of life and health and A-5 to the very good
ones. In order to consider the problem in a lower resolution
we collect two negative answers, A-1 and A-2, to one negative
answer and two positive answers, A-4 and A-5, – to one
positive. In Figures 1, 2, 3, 7, 8 full circles denote the answers:
positive, neutral (A-3), and negative.
Figures 1-7 show maps for the individuals with different
kinds of education: vocational (Figures 1, 4), high school
(Figures 2, 5), university (Figures 3, 6), doctor’s degree (Figure
7).

general health both for the group of employees and for
the retirees strongly depends on the level of education: the
structures of maps are different for the vocational, the high
school, and for the university educations. Also, the intellectual
activity during the retirement, such as attending the University

of the Third Age, inﬂuences the degree of this satisfaction. We
observe that in the maps, the points representing retirees2 and
retirees1 are located rather far away from each other. In the
cases of the dependence on the job position, the observations
are similar. The structures of maps for position1 and for
position2 are different. The job position is an important factor
inﬂuencing the satisfaction level on the overall quality of life
and general health. The point representing employees is close
to the neutral answer for position1 and close to the positive
one for position2 (Figure 8). In the higher resolution this is
A-3 and A-4 respectively (Figure 9). The group of students of
U3A (retirees2) is the most satisﬁed group both for position1
and position2: the closest point to A-5 is retirees2.
IV.
CONCLUSION
Summarizing, we have shown that both education level and
the job position are important factors inﬂuencing the change of
the satisfaction level on the overall quality of life and general
health related to the retirement threshold. We have also shown
that the correspondence analysis is a convenient tool for such
kind of studies.
The same methodology we are also going to apply for the
studies on changes of the quality of life in different domains
after the retirement threshold. Some preliminary results have
already been obtained.
