Abstract— Biodiesel is a biodegradable and non-toxic fuel 
which can be produced through transesterification reaction. 
However, it is impractical to use the refined vegetable oils as 
the feedstock for biodiesel production due to its high 
production cost and priority for food products. Thus, low-
grade oil with high free fatty acids (FFA) content, typically 
waste cooking oil has been a promising choice to improve the 
economical feasibility of biodiesel.  In the present study, 
superacid sulfated tin oxide catalyst, SO4
2-/SnO2 has been 
successfully 
prepared 
through 
impregnation 
method. 
Bimetallic effect was also studied at which SnO2 mixed with 
SiO2 and Al2O3, respectively at different weight ratio in order 
to enhance the catalytic activity of SnO2. The effect of different 
reaction parameters such as calcinations temperature and 
period, reaction temperature, catalyst loading, methanol to oil 
ratio and reaction time were studied to optimize the reaction 
conditions. It was found that SO4
2-/SnO2-SiO2 with weight ratio 
3 exhibited an exceptional high activity with optimum yield 
92.3% at reaction temperature 150oC, catalyst loading 3 wt%, 
methanol to oil ratio 15 and reaction time 3 hours.

I.         INTRODUCTION 
Rapid diminishing of energy reserves and fluctuating 
petroleum prices has intensified the search for renewable 
energy sources, globally. Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) or 
better known as biodiesel can be a potential renewable 
energy re-placing petroleum-derived diesel [1-4]. Biodiesel 
can be easily synthesized through transesterification of virgin 
vegetable oils, animal fats or even recycled grease from the 
food industry [1, 5-6] in the presence of short chain alcohol 
and catalyst. However, high cost of the most common 
biodiesel feedstock, virgin vegetable oil, has hindered wider 
utilization and commercialization of future biodiesel plant 
[7]. Therefore, to overcome this limitation, cheaper feedstock 
such as low-grade oil, typically waste cooking oil can be a 
better option as this can reduce the overall biodiesel 
production cost significantly.  
Recently, researchers in this field are focusing on 
developing 
solid 
acid 
catalyst 
for 
heterogeneous 
transesterification reaction, typically from low-grade oil [2, 
6-7]. The advantages of solid acid instead of liquid acid 
catalyst are; (1) the catalyst is insensitive to FFA content, (2) 
can 
simultaneously 
catalyze 
esterification 
and 
transesterification reactions, (3) easier catalyst separation 
and (4) easily incorporated into a packed bed reactor for 
continuous production of biodiesel [1,7]. Among various 
solid acid catalysts available, many studies have highlighted 
the application of sulfated metal oxides in biodiesel 
production, especially sulfated zirconia (SO2-
4/ZrO2) due to 
its high catalytic activity [1, 6, 8, 9]. Sulfated tin oxide (SO2-
4/SnO2) is another potential catalyst for transesterification 
reaction due to its strong surface acidity that is reported to be 
stronger than SO2-
4/ZrO2 [10-12]. Nevertheless, study 
concerning the usage of SO2-
4/SnO2 catalyst in biodiesel 
production is still very limited. 
Thus, this study is aimed to provide supplement technical 
information on the application of SO2-
4/SnO2 catalyst for 
transesterification reaction. Firstly, the effects of calcination 
temperature and calcination period towards the reaction 
performance were studied. This is followed by optimizing 
transesterification process variables including reaction 
temperature, catalyst loading, alcohol to oil ratio and reaction 
period. The effect of using mixed-metal was also 
investigated.

B.  Transesterification reaction 
 
50 ml of waste cooking oil and a pre-determined amount 
of catalyst and methanol (parameters to be varied) were 
charged into a 300 ml stainless steel batch reactor equipped 
with thermocouple and magnetic stirrer. The reactor was 
then pressurized to 10 bars to ensure that all reactants remain 
in liquid phase for the entire duration of reaction. The 
reactants were stirred at 350 rpm in order to maintain 
uniform 
temperature 
and 
suspension. 
The 
reactor 
temperature was controlled by a heater with a programmable 
PID temperature controller. After running the reaction for a 
desired duration, the reactor was cooled to room temperature. 
After cooling, the product was discharged out and filtered 
using filter paper to separate the solid catalyst from the 
mixture of FAME-glycerol.  
 
C.  Method of analysis 
 
The identity and relative composition of fatty acids 
present in the methyl ester product were analyzed by Perkin-
Elmer Clarus 500 gas chromatograph equipped with flame 
ionization detector (FID) and NukolTM column (15 m × 0.53 
mm × 0.5 µm). Helium was used as carrier gas. Oven 
temperature were held at 110 oC (0.5 minutes) and was then 
heated at a rate of 10oC/min to 220oC (8 minutes). The 
temperature of injector and detector were set at 220oC and 
250oC, respectively.  
 
III.     RESEULT AND DISCUSSION 
A.  Effect of reaction temperature and mixed metal oxide 
 
Fig. 1 shows the effect of transesterification reaction 
temperature (100 to 200°C) on the yield of FAME using 
various bi-metalic catalysts at different weight ratio. When 
the reaction was increased from 100 to 150°C, there is a 
significant increase in the yield of FAME for all types of 
catalyst. However, beyond 150°C, except for bi-metalic 
catalyst prepared with ratio 1, the yield of FAME seems to 
level off as the batch of reactants had reached its equilibrium 
conversion. On the other hand, the increase in yield when 
reaction temperature increased from 100 to 150oC could be 
justified as follows. Waste cooking oil and methanol are 
immiscible, therefore reaction with heterogeneous catalyst 
would create a 3-phase system at which the mass transfer 
rate of reactant molecules between the three phases is very 
limited [13]. As the reaction temperature is increased, all 
reactant molecules will gain more kinetic energy that will 
eventually accelerated the mass transfer rate between the oil-
methanol-catalyst phases that resulted in the formation of 
more FAME in a shorter time. 
The effect of mixed metal oxide (bi-metal oxide) on the 
yield of FAME was also studied and the results are given in 
Fig. 1. SiO2 and Al2O3 were chosen to mix with SnO2 at 
different weight ratio as both metal oxides were reported to 
be able to stabilize the crystalline structure of SnO2 [14, 15]. 
The weight ratio of SnO2:SiO2 and SnO2:Al2O3 were varied 
at 1:1, 3:1 and 5:1 (hereafter refer to as 1, 3 and 5) and 
impregnated with 2.0 M H2SO4 to become sulfated mixed 
metal oxide. Since 150°C was found to be the minimum 
temperature to achieve equilibrium conversion, discussion in 
this section will focus on the data trend for reaction 
temperature above 150°C. Furthermore, when the reaction 
temperature was below 150°C, no significant data trend can 
be observed. From Fig. 1, it is obvious that the weight ratio 
between the bi-metal affect the yield of FAME significantly. 
For all sulfated mixed metal with ratio 1, the yield of FAME 
was even lower than SO4
2-/SnO2 with exceptional at the 
extreme end of higher reaction temperature. However for 
sulfated mixed metal with ratio 3 and 5, the yield was 
significantly higher than SO4
2-/SnO2 with ratio 3 giving 
higher yield. These results showed that with appropriate 
amount of SiO2 and Al2O3, acid sites on the surface of SnO2 
can be enhanced and therefore increases its contact with 
reactants that led to higher reactivity [16]. The optimum 
yield for SO4
2-/SnO2-SiO2 (3) and SO4
2-/SnO2-Al2O3 (3) was 
82.1% and 79.6%, respectively at 150oC.

2-/SnO2 
and its sulfated mixed metal oxide. Reaction condition: methanol:oil ratio 
10, catalyst loading 3 wt %, reaction time 3 hours. All samples were 
calcined at 300 °C for 2 hours. 
 
B.  Effect of catalyst loading 
Catalyst loading is an important parameter that needs to 
be optimized to increase the FAME yield. Fig. 2 shows the 
effect of catalyst loading on the yield of FAME. The value of 
catalyst loaded into the reaction mixture was varied from 1 to 
8 wt% (based on weight of waste cooking oil). From the 
figure, it can be noted that the yield of FAME increased with 
higher catalyst loading up until a value in which higher 
increment no longer increase the yield of FAME. This is 
because with more catalyst addition, the total number of 
available active sites increased resulted in faster reaction rate 
to reach reaction equilibrium [17]. However, further increase 
in catalyst loading beyond its optimum value will have 
negligible increase in FAME yield. This might be due to the 
immiscibility of waste cooking oil and methanol, which 
causes the reaction to be rate limiting step at the beginning of 
the reaction. However, as catalyst is introduced in the 
18

reaction mixture, it provides an external contact surface area 
that facilitates the formation of FAME. As more FAME is 
produced, it eventually acted as co-solvent, by dissolving 
both reactants to become a single phase reaction system. 
Subsequently, the reaction rate is being controlled by the 
diffusion of the reactants to the active sites, instead of 
catalyst loading. Hence, increasing the dosage of catalyst in 
the reaction mixture will have an insignificant effect on the 
yield of FAME. The optimum catalyst loading for SO4
2-
/SnO2, SO4
2-/SnO2-SiO2 (3), and SO4
2-/SnO2-Al2O3 (3) are 6, 
3 and 3 wt %, respectively. 
 
 
Figure 2. Effect of catalyst loading on FAME yield using SO4
2-/SnO2 and its 
sulfated mixed metal oxide. Reaction condition: reaction temperature 150oC, 
methanol:oil ratio 10, reaction time 3 hours.  
 
C.  Effect of methanol:oil ratio 
Basically, for a reversible reaction like transesterification 
[1], reactants (methanol) are normally used in excess to push 
the reaction forward for formation of products (FAME). 
However, care must be taken as to how much excess 
methanol is to be used because too much methanol may 
dilute the system and eventually cause a drop in the yield of 
FAME due to slower reaction [18]. Fig. 3 shows the effect of 
methanol to oil ratio on the yield of FAME using three types 
of catalyst.  In the present work, methanol to oil ratio were 
set at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 in order to optimize the 
transesterification reaction as shown in Fig. 5. From the 
figure, the yield of FAME catalyzed by SO4
2-/SnO2 increased 
abruptly from 69.0% to 91.5% as the methanol to oil ratio 
increased from 5 to 30. Nevertheless, the observation for 
transesterification reaction catalyzed by SO4
2-/SnO2-SiO2 (3) 
and SO4
2-/SnO2-Al2O3 (3) showed a different pathway as the 
yield of FAME decreased at a certain ratio, indicating an 
optimum value. The maximum yield obtained by SO4
2-
/SnO2-SiO2 (3) was 92.3% at ratio 15 whereas for SO4
2-
/SnO2-Al2O3 (3) was 82.3% at ratio 10. It can be clearly seen 
that due to the high reactivity of sulfated SnO2-SiO2 catalyst, 
methanol to oil of 15 is sufficient to achieve a high yield as 
compared to the original sulfated SnO2 whereby this can 
only be achieve at a ratio of more than 30. 
 
 
 
 
D.  Effect of reaction time 
Fig. 4. shows that the yield of FAME increased steadily 
as the reaction time was increase from 1 to 3 hrs of reaction 
time. After 3 hrs., the yield level off as near-equilibrium 
composition was achieved. This shows that sulfated SnO2 is 
a very suitable solid catalyst that has a very high reactivity to 
catalyze transesterification reaction as typical solid catalyst 
requires more than 10 hrs. of reaction time. The optimum 
yield obtained for reaction catalyzed by SO4
2-/SnO2, SO4
2-
/SnO2-SiO2 (3) and SO4
2-/SnO2-Al2O3 (3) was 91.5%, 92.3% 
and 87.4%, respectively corresponding to their optimum 
reaction time.

IV.     CONCLUSION 
 
The present study had open a new synthetic route in 
application of modified SO4
2-/SnO2 as a promising catalyst in 
biodiesel production, typically from low grade oil with high 
free fatty acid content. It was found that adding appropriate 
amount of SiO2 or Al2O3 to SO4
2-/SnO2 will eventually 
enhance the catalytic activity of the catalyst leading to higher 
yield of FAME with minimum catalyst loading and methanol 
to oil molar ratio. The highest FAME yield of 92.3 % was 
obtained by using SO4
2-/SnO2-SiO2 (3) catalyst in which the 
catalyst was calcined at 300oC for 2 hours, while the 
optimum transesterification reaction condition was at 150oC, 
3 wt% catalyst, 15:1 methanol to oil ratio and 3 hours 
reaction time.
