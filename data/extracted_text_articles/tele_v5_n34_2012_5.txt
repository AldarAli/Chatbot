Abstract—Understanding user behavior and Internet usage
patterns is fundamental in developing future access networks
and services that meet technical as well as end user needs.
User behavior is routinely studied and measured, but with
different methods depending on the research discipline of
the investigator, and these disciplines rarely cross. We tackle
this challenge by combining measurement methods from dif-
ferent research disciplines, with the purpose of ﬁnding a
complete picture of the user behavior and working towards
a uniﬁed analysis methodology. In this paper, we provide
results, based on measurements performed with three different
methods: Internet trafﬁc measurements, web questionnaires
and diaries. All measurements were performed in the Acreo
National Testbed, where we have access to both the network
infrastructure and the end users. By comparing the different
measurement methods we ﬁnd that it is difﬁcult for the end
users to estimate the time they spend on different Internet
activities although they are fairly well able to estimate the
frequency of usage. We see that it is more difﬁcult for end
users to estimate their usage of streaming media applications
than their HTTP trafﬁc. We also ﬁnd that though the diaries
are quite accurate, the trafﬁc measurements give us a much
more detailed picture of the end user activity. We conclude that
having a testbed with real end users is invaluable to this kind
of study and we emphasize the importance of having access to
Internet trafﬁc to gain detailed knowledge of end user behavior.

I. INTRODUCTION
In a previous paper [1], we have described our work on the
development of a uniﬁed methodology for Internet behavior
usage measurements. In this paper we will expand the
work concerning the methodology description and include
additional results.
As the Internet continues to evolve and offer new services,
it takes up a larger part of our lives. We ﬁnd new ways
to communicate, interact and entertain ourselves. This puts
new demands on access networks [2] and requires new
insights into the behavior of those who use them. We believe
that understanding user behavior and needs is the key to
developing future networks and services that are accessible,
reliable and that address the needs of real end users.
There are several ways to study user behavior. From the
technical side, the data trafﬁc can be measured and analyzed.
Other common ways are to use surveys or diaries. Trafﬁc
measurements are routinely performed by operators, but re-
sults are rarely published because the operators are unwilling
to share this information with competitors. On the other
hand, published behavior studies are almost always based
on surveys with individuals (e.g., telephone interviews with
a large population). Such surveys often attract considerable
interest in the public debate, and far-reaching conclusions
may be drawn.
The question that we deal with in this paper is: To
what extent are such surveys reliable? People can forget
about their Internet activity, they may not know what they
did, they may not know what their children did, they
may lie about sensitive subjects, etc. We believe that in
order to get a comprehensive picture of the evolution of
Internet behavior, a combination of methods from different
disciplines is needed. This will lead to a more detailed
knowledge of the user behavior, and, by evaluating results
from different methods we will obtain a better knowledge
of their respective limitations. Furthermore, this way it can
be veriﬁed whether surveys are correct or whether there
perhaps is a systematic bias in survey answers that may lead
to misleading results.
The purpose of this study is to develop a uniﬁed method-
ology where different kinds of surveys are combined with
actual trafﬁc measurements. We compare three different
methods of looking at Internet user behavior;
1) Internet protocol (IP) trafﬁc measurements,
2) web questionnaire and
3) diary.

Combining technical measurements with surveys requires
test subjects in order to get statistical data. At Acreo we put
a lot of effort into developing the Acreo National Testbed,
ANT, which enables us to perform in-depth measurements
and test new technology and equipment as well as to interact
with end users. We have signed agreements with the end
users where they agree to give feedback and participate
in surveys and investigations. This means that the network
conditions such as network topology, link speeds, service
setup, etc as well as user metadata such as the number
of people in a household, age, etc are known. This gives
us a unique opportunity to perform measurements of user
behavior, and to compare the results from different mea-
surement techniques in order to evaluate the validity of the
results since we have access to real user trafﬁc measured on
a household level.
The rest of the paper is organized in the following way.
Section II describes the state of the art. Section III outlines
the details and limitations of the speciﬁc methods. The test
environment and the test population are described in Section
IV, while data on the speciﬁc measurements is detailed
in Section V. The measurement results are compared in
a systematic way in Section VI, where we make some
general observations and go through the results from the
respective methods one-to-one. In this systematic review, we
also discuss the limitations of the methods and the currently
performed measurements in Section VII. Section VIII is
dedicated to conclusions and future work.
II. STATE OF THE ART
There are trafﬁc measurement studies in the literature.
Most of these are based on trafﬁc from campus areas [3]
[4] or measure highly aggregated trafﬁc [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]
[10] [11], which makes it very difﬁcult to draw conclusions
about detailed user statistics. IP network trafﬁc studies on
a household level can be found in [12] [13] but as far as
we know trafﬁc measurements have not been used together
with questionnaires and diaries, which are well known and
often used methods [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21]
[22].
Surveys, administered to a sample of the population, are
the most common method to get information about Internet
behavior [16]. An interviewer can ask questions by phone
or at home. The questionnaire can also be sent by post or
be available online and be administered by the individuals
themselves. Questions can be asked about attitudes, beliefs
and past behaviour, i.e., what people generally think and do.
Another way to get to know how people use the Internet is
to let them ﬁll in a diary, where they make notes about what
they do during the 24 hours of the day. The diary method
has a long tradition in social sciences and is normally used
in ﬁeld studies where the data is collected in situ, from real
people in real situations [23]. Notes about what the person
is doing during the 24 hours of the day are written down.
The method has been used to measure different aspects of
Internet behavior such as time displacement [24] or usage
patterns [25] although not as frequently as surveys [26].
Both diary studies and surveys are prone to human error
in answering questions and ﬁlling in diaries. We know
that answers gathered from these types of surveys have
systematic errors due to the difﬁculty of estimating time
and the unwillingness to answer questions regarding certain
areas of Internet usage (e.g, illegal such as ﬁle sharing and
personal, such as sites with adult content) [27].
A third method, without these limitations, is Internet
trafﬁc measurements. This method measures all trafﬁc going
in and out from a household or user to the Internet. It can
be used to register for example trafﬁc volumes, applications
used and web sites visited as well as background trafﬁc such
as automatic updates.
III. PROS AND CONS OF THE METHODS
In this section, we will discuss the strengths and weak-
nesses of the different measurement methods used in this
study: web questionnaires, diaries and trafﬁc measurements.
A. Questionnaire
A questionnaire is an efﬁcient way of collecting infor-
mation from a large number of respondents. Questions are
administered to individuals, by phone or at home, by post
or online. Questions can be standardized; the sample can be
representative of the population, which is a major strength.
This method also gives the possibility of covering many
areas from attitudes and reﬂections to general behavior and
very detailed information.
A weakness of this method is that the outcome is strongly
dependent on the ability of the respondents to answer the
questions. This depends partly on the ability of the re-
searcher to formulate relevant and understandable questions
and partly on the willingness of the respondents to answer
sensitive questions in a truthful way. Also their ability to
estimate how often they perform different activities on the
Internet and how much time they spend online during an
average week is crucial for the outcome of the method.
Triangulation with other methods of measuring Internet
behavior can help resolve these issues.
B. Diary
If a questionnaire measures past behavior, a diary focuses
on the present. It is about real people in their everyday
life, at a speciﬁc time and in a speciﬁc place. This is also
the strength of the diary. Diaries also have an exploring
quality that surveys lack, which can lead to unexpected
discoveries. To keep a diary during a few days requires a
high level of commitment from the participants, which is a
weakness. There is therefore a need for detailed instructions
and frequent administrative contacts [28]. To what extent the
behavior noted down in the diaries is exhaustive and reﬂects

the simultaneous measurements of Internet trafﬁc as well as
their regular Internet behavior will become obvious during
the triangulation.
C. Trafﬁc Measurements
Trafﬁc measurements record actual network trafﬁc captur-
ing all user activity without bias or human error. Depending
on the equipment and methods used, a deep level of detail
can be achieved. It is also possible to measure activities
that are not induced by active end users such as automatic
updates or applications that are left running with no user
present such as ﬁle sharing applications. This may be both
a possibility and a disadvantage, since it may be difﬁcult
to distinguish between user induced activities and computer
induced activities.
One disadvantage of this method is the enormous amount
of data generated. It requires large storage space and efﬁcient
analysis tools. The important question is whether the analy-
sis and classiﬁcation of trafﬁc measurements can make these
data comparable with data from the questionnaires and the
diaries. There is also the problem of coupling measurements
of trafﬁc from an IP-number to a speciﬁc end user for
example with shared computers or in family households.
Having the possibility of addressing a test population with
a given proﬁle is also a limiting factor of the method. In
general, trafﬁc measurements are collected in geographically
speciﬁed populations, whereas for a speciﬁc test one may
require a population which is representative of the country,
i.e., deﬁned by parameters such as age, sex, occupation, etc.
IV. TEST ENVIRONMENT AND POPULATION
As mentioned in the introduction, the measurements in
this study were performed in the Acreo National Testbed
(ANT), which has previously been described in [29] and
[30]. The purpose of ANT is to provide an environment for
testing new technology and equipment as well as a way to
interact with end users. Contrary to lab based testbeds, this
is a live network with real end users or test pilots. In return
for being test pilots the end user households are given free
access to services like Internet and IPTV. Fiber to the home
(FTTH) is the main access technology in the testbed, and a
schematic picture of the network is shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Schematic picture of the Acreo National Testbed, ANT.
The FTTH installation at the test households is active
Ethernet providing 100 Mbit/s symmetrical connections to
each household. The number of households in the testbed
changes over time according to the current tests that are
being performed. At the time of this study, there were
approximately 40 active households in the testbed. Approxi-
mately 20 were apartments in a building centrally located in
a town in Sweden. The rest of the households, approximately
20 single dwelling units, were connected to the testbed via
a ﬁxed wireless access network, depicted as HSPA (High
Speed Packet Access) in Figure 1.
A letter of invitation was sent out to all users in the testbed
describing the measurements to be performed and asking
for volunteers. A form was attached to the invitation letter,
where detailed information about the household was to be
ﬁlled in, such as the number of people in the household,
number of computers, ages, etc. The test pilots were also
assured that their answers would be treated anonymously.
Based on the response from the test users, 5 households
were selected to take part in this study. The selection criteria
for the 5 households were that different kinds of household
constellations should be represented. Thus 2 single house-
holds and 3 family households were chosen. Of the family
households, one had preschool children, one had teenaged
children and one had both younger and older children. The
household details are summarized in Table 1. Household
number 2 had two IP-numbers, one used by the parents that
will be denoted 2.1 and one mainly used by the teenagers
of the family that will be denoted 2.2.
All the participants, except those twelve years or younger,
were later classiﬁed into different user groups according
to usage patterns revealed by their answers to the web
questionnaires. The typology has been accomplished through
two separate studies which encompass 2000 telephone inter-
views, based on a random sample of the Swedish population
from 16 years of age and older [31] [32].
Characteristic for the groups of Internet users that turned
up in the cluster process is that there were two extremes. One
group, the advanced enthusiasts, has access to everything and
uses Internets potential fully. The other group, its opposite,
the cautious, have limited access to new technology and use
it very restrictedly. Between these two extremes there are
a number of groups whose usage patterns differ in various
ways. But they are essentially variants of two basic pat-
terns: the traditional and the modern. The traditional usage
pattern is built around the Internets informative qualities
and the modern usage pattern, supported by the young
Internet generation, rests on the interactive, communicative
characteristics of the Internet.
The participants in the study were sent gratiﬁcations in
the form of movie tickets when their responses had been
received. They were not informed that they would receive
any gratiﬁcations beforehand and the gratiﬁcation was thus
not an incentive for taking part in the study.

The measurements in this paper are based on data from 5
testbed households. The reason for using a small population
in the study is that we wanted to perform a qualitative
analysis of their Internet usage, i.e., the main point is not to
gather data for statistical analysis, but rather to study the user
behavior in depth, as we have not found any similar studies
in the literature. As this is a novel comparative methodology
it was also important to develop methods and analysis tools
that can be scaled up to considerably larger populations [33]
where the amount of data to be handled will be much more
extensive. That is, we do not claim to be able to make
statistical conclusions in this study, but interesting trends
for further study will be pointed out.
We are not able to include all types of users detailed in
Table 1 with this small population. We have however made
an effort to include households with different proﬁles to be
as inclusive as possible. Nevertheless, before extending our
population, we would like to establish a solid foundation for
our work on developing a uniﬁed methodology that can be
used for more substantial conclusions at a later stage.
V. MEASUREMENTS
The combined methodology consists of three parts: trafﬁc
measurements, web questionnaires and diaries. The details
of each type of measurement are given below.
A. Trafﬁc Measurements
The trafﬁc measurements have been performed using
PacketLogic (PL) [34], a commercial trafﬁc management
device used in many commercial broadband access networks
all over the world. Trafﬁc is identiﬁed based on packet
content (deep packet inspection and deep ﬂow inspection)
instead of port deﬁnitions. The device can identify more
than 1000 Internet application protocols, and the signature
database is continuously updated. The identiﬁcation process
is connection-oriented, which means that each established
connection between two hosts is matched to a certain appli-
cation protocol. When a new connection is established, the
identiﬁcation of this connection begins. The identiﬁcation
algorithm searches for speciﬁc patterns, signatures, in the
connection. The patterns are found in the IP header and
application payload. The PL uses the trafﬁc in both direc-
tions in the identiﬁcation process. The measurement point
is depicted as deep packet inspection in Figure 1.
The PL can track and identify several hundred thou-
sand simultaneous connections, storing statistics in large
databases. The statistics database records the short-time
average amount of trafﬁc in inbound and outbound directions
as well as the total trafﬁc for all nodes in the network. Data
may be stored aggregated over 5 minute periods or detailed
on a per connection basis.
The measurement setup, although giving detailed mea-
surements, has certain constraints. First, the trafﬁc is mea-
sured per household and not per person and the analysis in
this paper is therefore done on a per household basis. There
is also a 5 minute resolution in the measurements, which
may have an impact on measurements of applications that
are used in short time periods such as instant messaging.
The data cut-off is 1 kbps, which may inﬂuence the mea-
surements of certain applications such as gaming where the
amount of data is generally very low. The signature database
in this study was not up-to-date due to old hardware, which
may result in a larger amount of unknown trafﬁc. An upgrade
will be performed before follow-up studies are performed.
The Internet trafﬁc of each household was measured both
during the days when the household recorded their diaries
(17-18 May 2009) and for a complete month (May 2009) to
get enough statistics to compare with the web questionnaire.
Statistics on what web sites were visited by the different
households were monitored for two weeks.
B. Web Questionnaires
Each household member was asked to answer a web
questionnaire regarding their long-term media and Inter-
net activity/behavior in general during the last weeks and
months. In the case of preschool children, the parents were
asked to answer for them. The questionnaire used was
basically the same as the one used by the World Internet

Institute in their yearly study of the Internet behavior of 2000
Swedes [35]. It contained basic questions concerning family
situation, education and occupation as well as questions
about attitudes, computer knowledge and Internet activity.
The Internet activity questions included questions about the
frequency of use of different Internet applications and how
often different types of web sites are visited such as banks
or newspapers, etc. Finally, the respondents were asked to
estimate the total time they usually spend online at home,
at work, at school and in other places.
C. Diaries
The members of each household were asked to complete a
24-hour diary logging their activities during two consecutive
days, Sunday and Monday 17-18 May 2009. In the diary the
test pilots were asked to ﬁll out four columns:
• Daily activity (sleep, work/school, leisure time activi-
ties, meals etc.)
• Media usage (TV, newspaper, radio, book, etc.)
• Internet activity when at home (web browsing, playing
games online, visiting community, downloading mate-
rial from the internet, etc.)
• Web address or service/application used
Each day was divided into 15-minute intervals. In the case of
preschool children in the household, the parents were asked
to note down their Internet activities.
VI. RESULTS
In this section, the results of the measurements are pre-
sented. First, some general results are given and then the
results from the different methods are compared.
A. General Results
Comparing data from the questionnaires with the results
from a representative study of the Swedish population using
the same questionnaire, we can classify the Internet usage
patterns of the test persons according to the four typical
usage patterns that have earlier been found in [31].
The most striking usage pattern is that of the advanced
enthusiasts. Two teenage boys in households 2 and 5 belong
to this group. They use the Internet for everything to a much
larger extent than most people. They share ﬁles, use social
networks and read blogs. The Internet is very important to
them. Their opposites are the cautious. They do not spend
much time on the Internet and when they do, its in order
to look for facts or ﬁnd information. No one in this study
belongs to this group.
Between these two extremes we ﬁnd the majority of
Internet users, the traditionalists and the modernists. The
modernists are mostly interested in communication and
entertainment. But they also use the Internet for information
and fact-ﬁnding. There are three modernists among the test
persons. They are all women and two of them, the teenage
girls (household 2), are so called enthusiastic modernists as
they spend a lot of time online.
The traditionalists are the largest group in the population
as well as among the test persons. They do not spend as
much time on the Internet as the preceding groups and
are mostly interested in its traditional role as a source of
information, for checking facts and for practical matters.
They are generally positive to the Internet but regard other
media as more important. Two women (household 2 and 5)
and ﬁve men (household 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) can be classiﬁed
according to this usage pattern. The Internet usage patterns
among the test persons are shown in Table 1.
The trafﬁc measurements show that the households partic-
ipating in the study are active mainly during afternoons and
evenings with shorter bursts of trafﬁc during the morning
and lunch hours. This corresponds to the trafﬁc patterns
established both in the ANT-testbed, see Figure 2, and in
municipal networks of similar characteristics [36].

We also note that the average time spent online calcu-
lated from the trafﬁc measurements is greater during the
weekend than the weekdays for the family households while
the opposite is true for the households without children,
see Table 2. The assumption here is that for the family
households, the time of day when household members use
Internet applications will be more spread out during the
weekend and of course there are more people at home with
leisure time. However, this assumption should be conﬁrmed
for a larger population.
B. Trafﬁc Measurements (Long Term Behavior) vs. Web
Questionnaires (Long Term Behavior)
The over-all estimation in the questionnaires (Q) of the
frequency of use of the Internet corresponds to what is
shown in the trafﬁc measurements (TM). All households use
the Internet daily. However, one older man, a traditionalist in

Household 4, underestimates his general frequency online.
Trafﬁc measurements show that he uses the Internet daily
but in his answer to the questionnaire he states that he uses
Internet a few times a week. At the same time he says that
he visits certain web sites daily, which corresponds with
the results from the trafﬁc measurements. So in the main,
the questionnaire answers as to how often the test pilots
were online, were conﬁrmed by the trafﬁc measurements,
see Table 3.

In the families with teenagers, the questionnaires show
that the children are the main users of the Internet. The
trafﬁc measurements cannot couple a speciﬁc person to a
speciﬁc Internet activity. However the measurements show
a trafﬁc mix corresponding to the expectations from the
age group with parents visiting banks and web shops and
teenagers using instant messaging, gaming, blogging and
visiting social communities [35].
The user penetration of a number of applications seen in
the trafﬁc measurements is found in Table 4. This is in good
agreement with the answers from the web questionnaires.
As is expected, HTTP is used by all households as well
as the SSL protocol, which is used by for example Internet
shops and banks. All of the households also use HTTP media
stream as well as ﬂash video, which means that they look
at streaming material on the Internet.
The frequencies of use reported in the questionnaires
were seen, on a general level, to correspond well with the
measured data. The questionnaire also posed questions about
the frequency of use of more speciﬁc Internet activities such
as using e-mail, visiting banks online, reading newspapers

phoning online, listening to music through Spotify or using
ﬁle sharing applications to download music or ﬁlm. The
answers from the questionnaires are for the most part
conﬁrmed by the trafﬁc measurements, see Table 5. This
includes activities such as ﬁle sharing and listening to
streaming music online through Spotify. The test pilots were
able to give estimations of how often they used for example
Spotify or ﬁle sharing applications and how often they
visited certain types of web sites such as newspapers or
banks.

One test pilot reported a high online gaming activity in
the web questionnaire, which was not recorded by the trafﬁc
measurements. A factor inﬂuencing the trafﬁc measurements
is the cut-off of 1 kbps for the data collection. The transfer
rates are usually low for gaming applications and the trafﬁc
may thus not register in the statistics. However, the discrep-
ancy between the measurements and the questionnaire is in
this case so large that at least a great part of it is deemed
to be due to other circumstances for example that he used
a computer in some other place for gaming. It has been
discussed whether questionnaire answers give a true picture
of activities that may be illegal or not socially acceptable.

In this study, the majority of the households answered
that they used ﬁle sharing applications occasionally, which
is in agreement with the measurement results. We thus
conclude that the households are comfortable with answering
questions about ﬁle sharing activities and that eventual errors
are not a result of unwillingness to divulge this information.
It should be noted here that the test pilots are used to answer
questionnaires and may not be representative in the sense
that they may be less shy than other users when sharing
sensitive information.
Considering streaming media, the estimations of the test
pilots were seen to be reliable when answering questions
regarding speciﬁc streaming media applications, such as
Spotify, or speciﬁc web sites with streaming media content,
such as YouTube. But more general questions concerning
how many hours a week they listened to streaming music
or watched streaming video, were more problematic for the
test pilots to answer and the answers were in some cases
incomplete. The result is shown in Table 6. The reason
for this difﬁculty is probably that the question was difﬁcult
to understand. The test pilots may not be aware of what
using streaming media means although they are familiar with
Spotify and Youtube.

over HTTP, HTTP media stream and Joost. The numbers represent

We have up to now looked at frequency of use. Now we
will compare Internet usage time, in hours and minutes.
The question asked in the web questionnaire was: How
many hours and minutes per week do you usually use
Internet at home? As can be seen in Table 7, the answers
correspond well with measurements of http trafﬁc. But the
trafﬁc measurement method measures all Internet trafﬁc such
as ﬁle sharing, streaming media, IP telephony, automatic
updates, etc as well as http trafﬁc. As long as the computer
is connected to the Internet there will be trafﬁc going to
and from the computer. This total Internet time is for every
household more than 100 percent longer than their own
estimations of their Internet activities. It seems that the
Internet users are not able to estimate this total Internet time,
at least not without much more detailed and comprehensible
instructions.

C. Trafﬁc Measurements (Long Term Behavior) vs. Diaries(
Short Term Behavior)
All test persons were asked to ﬁll in a diary and to make
notes about what they were doing during two days (48 hours)
chosen to be a Sunday and a Monday, 17 and 18 May
2009. During the same time, all Internet trafﬁc going in
and out from their IP-number was measured and the web
sites visited were logged. On a general level, there was
a total correspondence between the diaries and the trafﬁc
measurements as to when the test persons were using the
Internet, which is shown in Table 8.

ments and a two days diary given to the members of 5 households
about their Internet behavior at home. D=Daily, day 1=day 1 of
the recorded diary.

The activities noted down in the diaries were compared
to the trafﬁc measurements and we can see that the same
activities were registered in both, see Table 9. Although the
diaries generally correspond well with the measured Internet
activity, there are also some exceptions. For household 5
the measurements show Internet activity that is not noted
down in the diary. The trafﬁc consists of HTTP, HTTP media
stream and HTTP download trafﬁc. Also for household 4 one
household member has at several times noted down that Spo-
tify (music streaming application) was used in conjunction
with either at work or outside. The measurements however
show no trafﬁc from this application. Either the usage of this
application has taken place away from home or on a device
that does not send trafﬁc via the IP monitored by the trafﬁc
measurements.
Another noteworthy discrepancy is a number of visits by
one of the households to websites containing adult content,

which was registered by the measurement instrument. Com-
pared with what is detailed in the diaries of the household
members it is seen that HTTP activity has been written down
without any indication of the speciﬁc web sites visited. In
the case of these types of web sites we would expect both
diary and questionnaire material to show less activity or to
be less speciﬁc than what is actually the case.
One of the households also shows activity from the
ﬁlesharing application Bit Torrent KRPC which is a protocol
keeping track of seeders and content for the Bit Torrent
application. In the diaries, no such activity has been noted
down. The conclusion here is that there is a computer in the
household causing the activity without the presence of an
active user. This type of activity that is not user induced is
in fact difﬁcult to measure using questionnaires or diaries
and adds important details to the results concerning user
behavior.
A more general observation is that the Internet usage
registered by the trafﬁc measurements seems to be, in several
cases, more versatile and complex than what can be found
in the diaries. We exemplify this by looking at some of the
teenagers participating in the study. They use the Internet in
several ways at the same time. They watch TV online while
at the same time communicating with friends and visiting a
social network site. This combination of activities is not seen
in the diary. In the diary they may have noted down only
one activity like watching TV online or just surﬁng. There
is a need to deﬁne more carefully what is meant by certain
concepts and to be aware that several Internet activities can
go on at the same time as the main activity.
D. Diaries (Short Term Behavior) vs. Web Questionnaires
(Long Term Behavior)
The general usage pattern that can be extracted from the
questionnaire also shows up in the diary. The advanced
enthusiasts and the enthusiastic modernists are very ac-
tive according to the diaries, and traditionalists with very
restricted use of the Internet are the same both in the
questionnaire and the diary, see Table 10. Most of the
activities the test persons say they perform daily in the
questionnaire can also be found in the diary.

web questionnaire and a two days diary given to the members of

There are exceptions such as when the test pilot is away
from home during one of the two days when the diary was
scheduled, or is busy with something completely different
from what he/she usually does. But in most cases there is a
high correspondence between the daily activities marked in
the questionnaire and what is noted in the diary, even if two
days are not enough for the whole repertoire of activities to
show up. This is especially evident among the frequent users
who use the Internet several times a day, as an important part
of their everyday life.
VII. DISCUSSION
Three different methods have been used to measure the
way people use Internet in their homes: A questionnaire, a
diary and trafﬁc measurements. There is a high agreement
between the methods. People who are active users of the
Internet according to the trafﬁc measurements are also active
users according the questionnaire and the diary. Those who
say in the questionnaire that they use the Internet rarely
also show low Internet activity in the diary and in the trafﬁc
measurements.
There is also an agreement on a more speciﬁc level.
The different activities that the respondents say that they
usually do when going online can be found in the technical
measurements of the Internet activities, and these activities
also show up in the diaries. In most cases there is also a
rather good ﬁt between the time of Internet use measured
from the trafﬁc measurement and the users own estimate of
the hours and minutes online. We found one exception of
an underestimation. We also found a boy of 15 years who
reported a lot of gaming that was not found in the trafﬁc
measurements.
This high level of agreement applies to the use of http
websites. There seems to be more problems when it comes
to streaming audio and video applications. The reason for
this can be that the more passive use of streaming media
as a second hand activity is more difﬁcult to estimate, but

161
International Journal on Advances in Telecommunications, vol 5 no 3 & 4, year 2012, http://www.iariajournals.org/telecommunications/
2012, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
also that the questions were not formulated in a compre-
hensive way. Not everyone knows what streaming audio
is. Supporting this conclusion is the very good ﬁt between
the trafﬁc measurements and the estimates of those Internet
users who listen to the music service Spotify. When the
question is speciﬁc and tied to a single activity it is also
easier to give a good estimate. However, the questionnaire
and especially the diary do not give the full picture of the
Internet usage. In many cases, a lot of different activities go
on at the same time. This is typical of the Internet usage
of teenagers and younger people. They visit social websites,
communicate with instant messaging, at the same time as
they listen to music and watch TV. All these activities do
not show up in the diary. Behind the term surﬁng a lot
of activities can be hidden. Only trafﬁc measurements can
uncover this more complicated interplay between different
activities although the diary form can be further elaborated
to cover more complex situations.
At last, there is a more general problem. A direct com-
parison between trafﬁc measurements and answers from a
questionnaire and a diary can be problematic, as they do not
measure exactly the same things. There is lot of network
trafﬁc that is not directly induced by the user, such as
automatic updates and ﬁle sharing activities that happen in
the background. For the most part, this is something that the
users are unaware of. It is therefore necessary to develop
a way to ﬁlter out those activities and further develop the
trafﬁc measurements, before a fair comparison can be made.
VIII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we have proposed and applied a uniﬁed
methodology using three different methods to study Internet
user behavior; trafﬁc measurements, web questionnaires and
diaries with the purpose of verifying and comparing the
different methods as well as gaining more insight into user
behavior.
From the measurements, we conclude that the test pilots
are well able to describe some of their short term behavior
seen in the diaries, although some activities were not noted
in the diaries. The long term behavior seen in the web ques-
tionnaires are fairly accurate in describing frequencies of
use speciﬁc applications and visits to speciﬁc web sites. The
estimation of the amount of time spent on different activities
was seen to differ from that of the trafﬁc measurements, with
a slight tendency to underestimate the time spent. An even
more powerful conclusion is the complex and rich picture of
user behavior, which is obtained via trafﬁc measurements.
Here, details and behaviors that are not exposed in diaries or
questionnaires are visible. This gives new insights into user
behavior as well as valuable feedback for better construction
of question based investigations in the future.
The study was conducted in 2009 and since then, the
amount of time people spend on the Internet has increased,
especially when it comes to the use of smart phones. This
will make it more difﬁcult in the future to estimate the total
time of Internet use, as the number of ways you can connect
to the Internet increases: computer, mobile phone, TV, game
console, etc. It will be more difﬁcult but not impossible.
Another major result is the importance of the testbed to
the study. Here, we have the possibility of making measure-
ments in a controlled environment with real end users. From
the trafﬁc measurements we gain much more insight into the
behavior of the end users than can be obtained from only
questionnaires or diaries. However, from the questionnaires
and diaries, we also gain a better understanding of how
the end user perceives speciﬁc services giving valuable
information when interpreting the results from the trafﬁc
measurements. From the network side, this can be used to
improve the quality of service both from the technical and
the end user perspective.
We will continue to develop our testbed under the Central
Baltic Testbed project. In this project, we will work towards
creating a distributed measurement platform. In this way we
will have data from a large population spread out across the
country. Our future work will continue with a wider study
to follow up on the results presented here.
