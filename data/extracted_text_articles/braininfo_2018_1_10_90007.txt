Abstract—Thanks 
to 
brain-computer 
interface 
systems, 
patients with muscular impairments could have control of a 
device to communicate with people and manipulate their 
environment using only their brain signals, without the need of 
any muscular activity. The present preliminary study with four 
subjects is focused on the control of a 3x4 P300-based speller 
matrix which allows users to write and communicate. Seven 
different types of flashing stimuli were used to highlight the 
letters: i) white letters, ii) colored letters, iii) white blocks, iv) 
colored blocks, v) neutral pictures, vi) positive and excitatory 
pictures, and vii) negative and excitatory pictures. These 
preliminary results showed that conditions with pictures could 
offer the best performance, specially the set of negative and 
excitatory pictures. Regarding the other conditions, those ones 
with blocks presented better results than the standard letter 
paradigm.

 INTRODUCTION 
A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a technology that 
lets  establish a communication channel between a person 
and a device just through his/her brain signal [1]. Thanks to 
these systems, a user could interact with the environment 
without needing any kind of muscular activity. Thus, this 
technology can offer a significant improvement in the life 
quality of, for example, those patients affected by some 
lesions in the spinal cord or motor neuron diseases, such as 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).  
Most of these interfaces use electroencephalography 
(EEG) as the method to record the brain signal due to its 
combination of adequate temporal resolution, portability, and 
relatively low cost [2]. The EEG can register various types of 
brain signals such as Sensori-Motor Rhythms (SMR), Slow 
Cortical Potentials (SCP), Steady State Visual Evoked 
Potentials (SSVEP) or P300. Concretely, P300, which will 
be used by the proposed device in the present paper, is a 
positive deflection in the voltage of the EEG signal and is 
generally registered from the parietal lobe of the cortex, 
around 300 ms after the presentation of an uncommon target 
stimulus. According to [2], the main advantages of the P300-
based systems are: i) they do not require extensive training 
for management, only a small calibration to adjust the system 
settings for each user system; ii) they tend to have high 
success rates and iii) they offer a high number of options to 
be chosen by the participant, due to the large number of 
stimuli that these systems allow using an oddball paradigm 
(e.g., [3]). 
An interface which allows patients to communicate with 
people in their environment (e.g., [4]) could be considered 
the most widely studied application since the publication of 
[3]. The authors of this last proposal presented a virtual 
keyboard composed of a matrix of letters in which any of 
them could be selected by the user to communicate through 
typed (spelled) words. Their devised communication 
paradigm presented a 6×6 matrix of letters and numbers, 
whose rows and columns were briefly intensified (i.e., 
flashed) a given number of times in a random order. The user 
should keep his/her attention over the target character and 
count the number of times that it was flashed. As this 
character was presented in one specific row and column, the 
P300 can be used to find the target stimulus using the 
oddball paradigm. Once a sequence of flashes was over, the 
symbol that belongs to the row and column that had 
produced the largest P300 was regarded as the attended 
character and given as feedback to the user. 
Following the paradigm presented by [3], numerous 
variations have been proposed to improve the use of a P300 
speller matrix. Some works have been focused on certain 
parameters of the keyboard such as variations in lighting 
patterns [5], presentation times and brightness intensity [6], 
size of the stimuli and distance between them [7], color [8], 
number of stimuli [9] or even the nature of these, i.e., letters, 
faces, geometrical figures, etc. [10][11]. In addition, some 
studies pointed out outside the BCI field [12] that the 
emotional charge of  stimuli can modify the amplitude of the 
Event-Related Potential (ERP) signal, such as the P300 or 
the late positive potential. 
Comparing different conditions in the same experiment 
could be interesting to obtain a preliminary overview about 
the proper flashing stimuli set to control a P300 speller 
matrix. The flashing stimuli are those that appear when the 
letter is highlighted for a few milliseconds and trigger the 
P300 signal. Specifically, the present paper will test seven

conditions in order to assess the influence of different 
flashing stimuli set. 
Therefore, we hypothesized that four main factors may 
affect the speller performance: i) the size of the stimuli, two 
sizes were used, one size being the letters themselves and 
other a whole rectangle covering the letters; ii) the 
heterogeneity, i.e., if the interface uses the same flashing 
stimulus for every item or, otherwise, it uses different 
chromatic stimuli composition for each letter, as in [4] using 
different colored letters; iii) the nature of the stimuli, where 
letters, monochromatic blocks and images will be compared; 
and iv) the emotional charge of the stimuli, two sets of 
emotional pictures (excitatory positive set and an excitatory 
negative set) will be compared in terms of accuracy to 
neutral sets (neutral pictures, blocks and letters). 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 
II (Method), it is described who participated in the 
experiment, the different spelling paradigms, the procedure, 
and the data acquisition and signal processing that were 
carried out. In Section III (Results and discussion), the 
gathered data are shown and discussed in order to identify 
the main findings. Finally, in Section IV (Conclusion and 
future work), the paper is concluded offering possible 
proposals according to the obtained results.

 METHOD 
A. Participants 
The study involved four participants (aged 30 ± 8.72, one 
female, all heterosexuals) who had normal or corrected-to-
normal vision. Two subjects had previous experience 
controlling BCI systems and the other two did not. The study 
was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of 
Malaga and met the ethical standards of the Helsinki 
Declaration. According to self-reports, none of the 
participants had any history of neurological or psychiatric 
illness or were taking any medication regularly. 
B. The spelling paradigms  
The present work employed seven paradigms that were 
used by participants. All these paradigms were initially based 
on the previously mentioned row-column lighted paradigm 
of [3]. However, the current proposal used a 3x4 matrix of 
25 cm x 17.2 cm displayed on a 15.6-in (39.6 cm) screen at a 
refresh rate of 60 Hz. A Stimulus Onset Asynchrony (SOA) 
of 304 ms was used, and an Inter-Stimulus Interval (ISI) of 
96 ms, so each stimulus was presented for 208 ms. A 3500 
ms pause was established between letters. The only 
difference between the compared paradigms was the 
employed flash stimuli for each condition. Thus, the seven 
presented paradigms were: i) White Letters (WL), ii) 
Colored Letters (CL), iii) White Blocks (WB), iv) Colored 
Blocks (CB), v) Neutral Pictures (NP, low arousal and 
medium valence images), vi) Excitatory Pleasant Pictures 
(EPP, high arousal and valence images), vii) the Excitatory 
Unpleasant Pictures (EUP, high arousal and low valence 
images). All conditions are presented in Fig. 1. The font used 
for the letters in all conditions was arial bold in capital

letters. Moreover, the size of the stimuli (i.e., letters, blocks 
and pictures) was adapted to the same space, 4.7 cm x 3.5 
cm, presented at a distance of 60 cm, approximately. 
Regarding the conditions with figures, they were 
obtained from the International Affective Picture System 
(IAPS; [13]). On the one hand, the images of the EPP and 
EUP conditions were selected using the following procedure: 
i) those images with high value of arousal (above the 90th 
percentile) were collected; ii) the 12 pictures with highest 
and lowest valence for the EPP and the EUP conditions, 
respectively, were finally selected. On the other hand, for the 
NP condition: i) the selected images were those that placed 
below the 10th percentile in arousal level, and ii) the first 12 
images whose valence was nearer to the mean were selected. 
Only those images that maintained the proportion of the 
aforementioned size were selected, i.e., the images that filled 
all the space and did not have black paddings. Those images 
with high predominance of black color or those that were 
excessively difficult to be recognized were also removed. 
The IAPS’ codes of the selected pictures are presented in 
Table 1. In all conditions, the letters were adapted to the 
same size of the figures, so they occupied the largest possible 
space within the aforementioned dimensions.

C. Procedure 
The experiment was carried out in an isolated room 
where only the participant was present at the time he/she was  
performing the task in order to concentrate on it without 
external distractions. It consisted of only one exercise: a 
calibration task to adapt the system to the user. In addition, 
there was no writing task in which the user actually 
controlled the interface. Consequently, the study was 
performed in one session. 
An intrasubject, also called repeated measures, design 
was used, and so all the users went through all the 
experimental conditions. The conditions order for each 
participant was selected pseudo-randomly to prevent any 
unwanted effect, such as learning or fatigue, and all 
conditions were equally distributed. 
We used three words for calibration purpose and each 
one had four letters, having a total of 12 characters per 
condition, with a short break between words (variable at the 
request of the user). Each letter flashed 20 times and the user 
was asked to count these flashes to maintain the attention. 
The writing time for each character in this phase was 25.77 s. 
The specific Spanish words were: “PLAN” (plan), “TRES” 
(three) and “CUBO” (cube). 
D. Data acquisition and signal processing 
The EEG was recorded at a sample rate of 500Hz using 
the electrode positions: Fz, Cz, Pz, Oz, P3, P4, PO7 and 
PO8, according to the 10/20 international system. All 
channels were referenced to the left earlobe and grounded to 
position AFz. Signals were amplified by an acti-CHamp 
amplifier (Brain Products GmbH, Munich, Germany). 
Neither online nor offline artifact detection techniques were 
employed. All channels impedances were reduced below 
10.0 kΩ before recording. All aspects of EEG data collection 
and processing were controlled by the BCI2000 system [14]. 
A Stepwise Linear Discriminant Analysis (SWLDA) of the 
data was performed to obtain the weights for the P300 
classifier and calculate the accuracy.

III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Fig. 2 shows the mean classification accuracy achieved by 
users for each of the seven conditions, as a function of the 
sequences (due to the small simple size, statistical 
significance is not considered). Each sequence is composed 
of two flashes, namely, the corresponding flash from the 
column and other flash from the row. 
Despite the low number of users, these preliminary 
results showed some trends that are worth to be mentioned. 
Firstly, the three different conditions with pictures produced 
the best results, especially the EUP paradigm, which has 
shown a 100% accuracy since the first sequence by the four 
users. Then, it seems that the CB paradigm had better results 
than the remaining non-picture conditions, since it achieved 
100% accuracy at least in some point (sequence = 5, i.e., 
with 10 flashes). Regarding the standard condition of white 
flashing letters, i.e., the WL paradigm, it started with the 
lowest performance in the first sequence but it gradually 
improved until it achieved its maximum accuracy of 93.75% 
in the second-to-last sequence, i.e., with 18 flashes. 
A remarkable detail that should be inspected in later 
experiments is the apparent superiority of the WL paradigm 
versus the CL paradigm, which is the opposite of what [4] 
and [15] showed using a slightly different paradigm. It is 
also important to highlight that WL and WB paradigms start 
to improve equally from the fifth sequence. 
Regarding the superiority of the conditions with pictures, 
it should be studied more deeply with a larger number of 
participants. In addition, despite the hypothesis about the 
excitatory and emotive pictures that could modify the brain 
activity and improve the attention [12] and, thus, it could

improve the performance of the user, Fig. 2 shows that the 
NP paradigm obtained better results than the EPP paradigm, 
at least in the three first sequences. Therefore, it would be 
interesting to study which variable is actually improving the 
performance of the users while using pictures on the speller. 
Another interesting result is that the hypothesis about the 
stimuli

significance 
described 
in 
this 
paper’s 
introduction, seems correct since, in general, the conditions 
with figures and blocks obtained better results than the 
conditions with letters. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The present preliminary study about the effect of 
different set of flashing stimuli using a P300-based speller 
has shown some trends that should be further explored in 
future proposals. The main finding is that the use of pictures, 
especially with the negative and excitatory pictures, could 
improve the performance controlling this device. However, 
for future experiments, it should be considered the 
application of an online phase where the user can write and, 
thus, obtain some feedback. Moreover, it would be 
absolutely necessary to use a larger sample of participants to 
obtain stronger results and conclusions before we move 
forward to the next step: to test the hypothesis with patients.
