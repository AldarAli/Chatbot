Abstract—For an enhanced automated usage of 3D-printers in
case of multiple available 3D-printers, such as in Cloud Man-
ufacturing or Cloud Printing services, the requirement arises
to select and provision suitable resources for user provided
model ﬁles. As Additive Manufacturing (AM) consists of a
number of different technologies, ranging from fabrication using
thermoplastic extrusion to electron beam based curing of metal
powder, the necessity is evident to enable users to describe
limitations, capabilities, interfaces and requirements for a these
resources in a machine readable and processable format. This
resource description enables the discovery and provisioning
of appropriate resources within a service composition, where
3D-printing resources are regarded as manufacturing services
themselves. In order to compose a service from these hard-
ware resources, the comprehensive description of such resources
must be provided. With this work, we provide an abstract
and universal capability description framework of such 3D-
printing resources. The framework consists of an ontology for
the resources of the AM Domain, a ﬂexible Extensible Markup
Language (XML) schema and the implementation in a cloud-
based 3D-printing system. With this resource description both
hard- and software resources are universally deﬁned. Applied
to systems with multiple 3D-printers, a scheduling component
is capable of resource discovery. This selection is based on
the matching of described capabilities, status information and
derived requirements from speciﬁc 3D-printing job deﬁnitions.
This work provides a framework for the description of resources
in the AM domain with an ontology, based on a collection of
identiﬁed resource descriptors extracted from literature.

I. INTRODUCTION
This work is an extension to Baumann et al. [1], presented
at the ADASERC conference 2017.
For the efﬁcient usage of 3D-printing resources in Cloud
Manufacturing (CM) scenarios, it is necessary to identify
and schedule the existing resources. This scheduling is in
accordance with the requirements of the user and the rele-
vant 3D-printing application or request. 3D-printing resources
are mainly 3D-printers of various types, makes and models.
These 3D-printers are characterised and differentiable by their
capabilities, speciﬁcs and constraints for their usage. Similar
usage of an abstracted description of resources is described
in Grangel-Gonz´alez et al. [2], where industrial machinery
is equipped with an “Administrative Shell”, which is used to
interface with various devices. In a cloud printing environment,
where these resources are considered part of a service, it
is possible to compose them into new services to achieve
tasks such the efﬁcient execution of 3D-printing requests.
This work offers a practical service composition framework
and tool for the description required to establish service
compositions within a 3D-printing service in the domain of
Additive Manufacturing (AM). For this work, the applicability
of the proposed resource description is analysed.
As 3D-printing is comprised of a number of different
technologies, ranging from thermoplastic extrusion fabrication,
over photopolymerisation to other methods, it is a prerequisite
to understand these technologies and their speciﬁc parameters
and differences. One thermoplastic extrusion based method is
called Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) (also Fused Fila-
ment Fabrication or Free Form Fabrication (FFF)). Fabrication
on the basis of curing of photopolymers in a vat is called
Stereolithography (SLA). Laser-based fabrication methods are
either Selective Laser Melting (SLM) or Direct Metal Laser
Sintering (DMLS). Other methods exist to create physical
objects directly from digital models, such as Laminated Object
Manufacturing (LOM). Besides the understanding of these
technologies and methods, it is important to be able to de-
scribe them in a comprehensive and machine-understandable
way. Furthermore, it is important to express the inherent and
derived capabilities and restrictions of these technologies and
machines. The different technologies do not only differ in
the materials they are able to process but also in the quality
that is achievable. They further differ in the geometric and
structural features they can reproduce, in the cost they effect,
and the means they are controlled by or programmed with. For
the automated usage in a distributed service scenario, with a
number of different 3D-printing resources involved, the service

must be able to select an appropriate device or devices for any
given user submitted task.
For the hardware providers, it is beneﬁcial if their equipment
is utilized to a high degree. This is required in order to
amortise their assets on time and also to be ecologically
sound [3]. For the users, such an automated and swift resource
allocation is pertinent. This equates to a reduced turnaround
time and also the promise of higher product quality due to
optimum capability and requirements matching. For service
operators, the automated resource allocation is an intrinsically
motivated requirement for the operation of such a service.
With this work, a solution for the description of differ-
ing capabilities, restraints and requirements of various 3D-
printing resources is provided. This solution provides an ex-
tensible, ﬂexible, comprehensive and usable description format
for the use in AM scenarios. The solution combines existing
approaches for the description of resource capabilities and
extends these for the usage in 3D-printing. The proposed
solution is currently implemented in a prototype service to
facilitate scheduling and selection of AM resources.
This work is motivated by the following ﬁve use cases:
3D-printer selection: The resource description, applied to a
database of commercially available 3D-printers can serve
as a purchasing guide for end-users/consumers or other
potential buyers of 3D-printers [4], [5]. This will espe-
cially be the case if the information is readily available as
a Web-service and supports pro-active user-questioning,
e.g., a wizard.
Automated facility planning: In future modular factory de-
signs, the dynamic reconﬁguration of the shop ﬂoor [6]
is becoming relevant. With a machine readable resource
description, layouting and planning software can place
the manufacturing resources at an appropriate location.
Scheduling in 3D-printing services: In this use case the re-
source description is the foundation for the scheduling
algorithm that selects the most appropriate available 3D-
printing resource for any given processing request, based
on the constraints and preferences provided by the user
and derived from the model data [7], [8].
Recommender systems for CAD development: Based
on the resource description, a software system can
support
Computer
Aided
Design
(CAD)
designers
with information and recommendations for geometrical
and
topological
features
within
models
that
are
manufacturable with 3D-printing resources available to
a company.
Technological improvement: Through an extended under-
standing of the speciﬁc resources for different technolo-
gies, commonalities can be identiﬁed and improvements
on speciﬁc technologies and implementations can be
enabled.
This work is an extended version of [1] and structured
as follows: Starting with related work in Section II, a re-
view of existing publications is performed. In Section III,
the approach for the resource description is described, its
underlying concepts and sources as well as the implementation
and evaluation. In Section IV, the implementation and its
results are discussed and analysed. Lastly, Section V provides
a summary of this work.
II. RELATED WORK
In the work by Pryor [9], the implementation of a 3D-
printing service within an academic library is described. The
system consists of two low-cost hobbyist 3D-printers and a
3D scanner. Of relevance to this work is the description of the
workﬂow for the user handling. Pryor describes the processing
workﬂow as purely manual with the data being deployed by
the users either via a web form or email. The library staff
performs sanity checking, pre-processing (i.e., positioning,
slicing, machine code generation) and manual scheduling of
the 3D-printer resource. The text does not provide an analysis
of the time required for the staff to perform these tasks.
In the article by Vichare et al. [10], the authors propose
a Uniﬁed Manufacturing Resource Model (UMRM) for the
resource description of machines within the manufacturing
domain. Speciﬁcally, the authors aim to describe Computer
Numeric Control (CNC) machines and their associated tools
in a uniﬁed way to represent the capabilities of these systems
in their entirety. Their work provides a method to describe
a CNC machine in an abstract sense for use in software,
e.g., for simulations. As part of the collaborative peer-robot
control system described in the work by Yao et al. [11],
an ontology for a resource description is partially described,
on which we build our work. This ontology distinguishes
between hardware and software resources, as well as capability
and status description. The authors provide an exemplary
Extensible Markup Language (XML) schema deﬁnition for
such a resource description, on which we extend upon. The
3D Printer Description File Format Speciﬁcation (3PP) by
Adobe [12] is very relevant to this work, as it describes the 3D-
printer’s capabilities in XML format as deemed necessary by
Adobe, presumably for the application within their software.
This work contains an extensive listing of possible attributes
relevant to a resource description, on which we base our
work. The 3PP format is limited to FDM 3D-printers. The
deﬁnition includes hardware and material description but only
partially caters for software support. In the publication by
Chen et al. [13], the authors provide another approach to
the problem of model-fabrication resource mismatch by the
introduction on an abstract intermediary speciﬁcation format.
The authors propose this reducer-tuner model to abstract
design implementations for the application to a variety of
3D-printers whereas our work proposes a 3D-printer resource
description that enables the matching of suitable machines
to speciﬁc model ﬁles. In the work by Dong et al. [14],
the problem of scheduling in AM is handled by a rule-
based management of autonomous nodes, i.e., 3D-printers.
This system is based on an ontology for 3D-printing of which
some excerpts are presented in this work. From this example,
our work is inﬂuenced and extends on missing attributes.
Yadekar et al. [15] propose a taxonomy for CM systems
that are closely related to AM. This taxonomy is focused
on the concept of uncertainty and only brieﬂy discusses
the taxonomical components that deﬁne the manufacturing

resources. The main distinction for the authors is the division
into soft and hard resource groups. In the work by Mortara et
al. [16], a classiﬁcation scheme for direct writing technologies,
i.e., AM, is proposed. The authors deﬁne the scheme for three
dimensions, namely technology, application, and materials.
The properties of speciﬁc materials are discussed exemplary
in brief. A listing of potential properties for the varying
technologies and materials is missing.
III. MATERIALS AND METHODS
From existing literature, software and expertise, we con-
struct an ontology that is described in the following Section.
This ontology is the basis for the extension of the properties
proposed, that are relevant to the domain of AM. In this work,
we exclude concepts like business process related capabilities,
and knowledge and abstract ability related mapping, i.e., it
is not possible to express certain abilities of people, teams
or companies, e.g., the level of knowledge for the design
of objects for AM. The properties are derived from litera-
ture, software and 3D-printer documentations. The following
requirements are expressed to guide the generation of the
ontology and properties list:
RQ1 The ontology and properties list must be ﬂexible and
extensible. Flexibility means that for speciﬁc application
scenarios where only subsets of properties and relations
are of interest, these must be expressible within the
proposed ontology or resource description. Extensibility
denotes the property to be able to incorporate future, cur-
rently unforeseen, properties of technology and materials.
RQ2 The resource description must be able to reﬂect tem-
poral, local and other ranges of validity and restrictions.
Conditional validity is to be reﬂected. With this require-
ment we reﬂect the necessity that certain properties, e.g.,
material strength, are only valid and guaranteed for a
certain period.
RQ3 The resource description must be able to distinguish
between general concepts of things, e.g., 3D-printers and
materials, that form a class and its individual instantiation
that might have differing properties and attributes.
In this work, the following separation of information de-
scription is performed for the resource description:
Materials: Encompasses all physical materials that are pro-
cessed, or used during the digital fabrication. Also in-
cludes physical materials that are required for the digital
fabrication process as indirect or auxiliary material.
Software: Encompasses all software and Information tech-
nology (IT) components that are involved in the model
creation phase, the object fabrication phase or that are
used for the control and management of digital fabrication
equipment.
Processes: Encompasses all intangible processes, data and
information that is generated, consumed, transformed or
inﬂuenced by in any phase of the digital fabrication
process. Business processes are part of this grouping.
Technology: Encompasses all hardware and machine equip-
ment that is used for the object fabrication, as well as
pre- and post-processing.
We exclude status information and status dependent prop-
erties from our resource description and ontology.
The resource description must be able to reﬂect required
properties and information of all currently available 3D-
printing technologies, regardless of the technology classiﬁ-
cation following any schema, such as the classiﬁcation by
Gibson et al. [17], the classiﬁcation by Williams et al. [18] or
the ISO/ASTM Standard 52900:2015 [19] classiﬁcation. This
work identiﬁes common attributes between technologies and
enables technology speciﬁc properties. As a guideline for the
creation of the ontology and the resource description itself a
distinction between object classes and their actual instances
is followed. Given the example of a 3D-printer, the class is
formed of all 3D-printers from a certain manufacturer and are
of a certain make share a number of attributes like physical
volume and number of printheads. Those general attributes
might be extended by attributes pertaining to a certain 3D-
printer that belongs to a user and is situated at a physical
location. The general attributes might also be altered for a
speciﬁc 3D-printer, as it might weight more than the original
3D-printer due to added extensions or modiﬁcations, or its
build envelope is smaller than the original’s due to a hardware
defect.

B. Properties
The following properties are identiﬁed from literature and
technology documentation. These properties are listed in the
appendix in order to avoid a disruption of the text ﬂow. The
provided listing is sufﬁcient to describe relevant properties of
AM machinery, i.e., 3D-printers, and the associated materials.
The properties can be further classiﬁed as either static, e.g.,
the serial number of a 3D-printer or its coordinate system, or
dynamic, e.g., the owner or location of a 3D-printer. Dynamic
properties are often dependent properties, which is a further
classiﬁcation applied to the properties. Dependent properties
are inﬂuenced and depend upon a 3D-printer component, e.g.,
the nozzle and its diameter, the material, e.g., surface rough-
ness achievable differs for materials processable or parameters
selected during the 3D-printing process. This classiﬁcation is
not provided with this work due to brevity. The properties in
the listing (see I) are for the hardware resources, i.e., the 3D-
printer as well as its components and the material associated
with the 3D-printer.
In the following table I, we list the an excerpt of the
attributes, the category they belong to, the list of dependent
factors, the unit the attribute is represented in, the source
where the attribute is referenced from, possible restrictions
based on printing mechanism, examples where appropriate
and the respective classiﬁcations. The complete listing is
presented in the appendix. In the listing the abbreviation
EXP indicates attributes that are not referenced from literature
but are either derivatives from literature referenced attributes,
common knowledge or are derived from experiments. The
unit [String] is an array of strings, meaning that the attribute
is described by distinct texts. Furthermore, square brackets
denote other types of arrays as indicated. The unit Int denotes
an integer, Bool a boolean variable.
C. Implementation
In this Section, the implementation of both the ontology
and the relevant core classes are described. Furthermore,
information on a possible scheduling metric based on a cost
estimation method and the resulting information ﬂow in the
implemented service is described.
The ontology is constructed using the prot´eg´e software
version 5.1.0, see http://protege.stanford.edu/. The ontology
is generated based on the properties brought forward in
Section III-B. The guiding principle for the ontology is the
ﬂexibility of the properties that are applicable to 3D-printers,
material and inherent constraints. The ontology is created
based on the identiﬁed properties and derived concepts from
literature and documentation.
The implementation in software to manage the speciﬁc
properties of the resource description and to evaluate the
applicability of the description is performed in the proposed
3D-printing cloud service by the authors [26], [27].
The implementation in the service is performed to enable
provisional scheduling for 3D-printing resources based on
availability, build volume and processable material type. In
scheduling, some form of ordering metric must be provided.
In this work, this metric is based on a proposed cost metric
as described further in the text.
The cost metric is deﬁned in [28] and serves as a prototyp-
ical implementation of cost estimation within AM.
The cost is calculated as (see Equation (1)) follows:
Cost = (Discount(T, P, U) + Proﬁt(U))
× (Machine + Material(O, P, S, SO) × Factor B
+ Duration(O, S, SO) × Factor U + Factor A
+ Factor C(O, P))
(1)
With the following abbreviations used in the equation: 1) T
for team 2) P for 3D-printer 3) U for user 4) O for object 5) S
for slicer and, 6) SO for slicing options The cost for a 3D-
print is dependent upon the 3D-printer selected (base cost),
the material that is consumed and the time required for 3D-
printing. Within the service, these attributes are user selectable
for each materialtype and 3D-printer that is under the control
of the user.
The scheduling of resources is implemented to adhere to
a user selected criterion, e.g., lowest cost possible or fastest
execution available. These criteria are calculated based on the
proposed resource description that ﬁnds suitable and available
manufacturing resources ﬁrst and then calculates the expected
cost. The user and resource operator are queried for conﬁrma-
tion before the actual commitment to ensure legal agreement
on the execution. The operator is able to forfeit the manual
conﬁrmation to enable automated operation.
From Baumann et al. [28] we use this explanation for the
parts of the cost formula (see Equation (1)).
Material is a factor that adjusts the cost to the material
chosen.
Factor A is a factor that compensates for required time
associated with pre-heating of the AM resource and other
preparatory tasks not dependent upon the build volume.
Factor B is a factor that compensates for required material
used for raft and support structures.
Factor C is a factor that compensates for the required cooling
time and the parts removal.
Factor U is an uncertainty factor associated with the 3D-
printing time estimation that is generally unreliable to
a certain extend for which this factor compensates.
Discount is a factor to address requirement of discounting for
certain teams, members or machines.
Machine is a factor representing the base cost of usage of a
certain 3D-printer.
Proﬁt is a factor to address commercial interests of 3D-
printer owners to offset the net-costs of a 3D-print for
a proﬁtable endeavor
Based on the cost metric, scheduling is implemented in the
service as described below.
In Figure 1, the processing ﬂow for the registration of a
hardware resource with the 3D-printing service is depicted.

In this ﬁgure, the user dispatches a 3D-printing requirement
(Job) with the service, for which a number of implicit and
explicit requirements and restrictions are also deposited. A
hardware resource registers its capabilities with the service,
that is then stored with the resource registry. The service
queries the resource registry for a suitable hardware resource
for a job and issues the appropriate commands for a 3D-
printing execution on this resource. On completion or failure,
the user issuing the job is notiﬁed.
1) Core Classes: The core classes in the ontology are
described in this Section. A visual representation of the
ontology is depicted in Figure 2. In this ﬁgure, the classes
are depicted as circles, with the relationships between them
depicted as arrows with the relationship name as labels. This
graph is created using the WebVOWL service [29].
MaterialGroup and Material, these classes denote the mate-
rials that are relevant for the description of the capabilities
of the 3D-printing resource. The materials have an inﬂu-
ence on a number of quality properties, e.g., the surface
roughness. The materials a 3D-printing resource can
process are relevant for the selection of the appropriate
3D-printing resource.

Fig. 2: 3D-printing Ontology
3D-printer class, which can be understood for example
as a speciﬁc model line from a hardware manufacturer
(e.g., the Replicator Series from Makerbot Industries).
Hardware resources of a PrinterType have a number of
common attributes that extend the PrintingTechnology.
The Printer denotes the make of a speciﬁc PrinterType,
e.g., the MakerBot Replicator 2X from Makerbot Indus-
tries. Instances of this Printer class have further common
attributes extending the attributes of the PrinterType.
Instances of the Printer class are actual 3D-printers that
have further attributes like owner and a physical location.
PrinterComponent, is the class for the physical and imma-
terial components that are part of the speciﬁc 3D-printer.
Every component can have a unbounded number of prop-
erties as described below. For example the printhead and
its nozzles are components of a 3D-printer in the case of
FDM technology and an electron source is a component
of a EBM type 3D-printer.
Software, denotes all software that is used in the 3D-Printing
Process (3D-PP). Software is used to control the 3D-
printing resource, to convert ﬁles from one format into
another, to prepare and process the ﬁles required for the
control of the 3D-printer and to evaluate and monitor the
3D-print itself.
MProperty, this class is the generalisation of properties that
are applicable to either the Material, Materialgroup, Print-
ingTechnology, PrinterType, Printer, PrinterComponent,
Software, ProductModel or File. The guiding principle
for the creation of this ontology is to enable ﬂexibility
and expandability, so this generalised property can hold
all properties listed above (see Section III-B) and future
properties.
Restriction, is a class that reﬂects the ability to enable restric-
tions on MProperties as the properties can be applicable
only for a speciﬁed period of time or for a certain group
of people. For example the property of ﬁlament quality
might be linked to a certain expiration date.
InﬂuenceFactor, is a class that reﬂects the multi-dimensional
inﬂuences on properties by a deﬁned number of factors.
For example the nozzle diameter can inﬂuence the extru-
sion rate in case of a FDM 3D-printer.
D. Resource Description Schema
From the ontological concept, an XML schema deﬁnition
is constructed, which follows the principle of ﬂexibility by
encapsulation of properties in a ﬂexible element. The property
element is applicable to all relevant types of the schema,
namely the PrintingTechnology, PrinterType, Printer, Printer-
component, Materialtype, and Material.
All properties are extended to allow for restrictions based
on user, group or temporal conditions. The properties can
be inﬂuenced by any other class of the schema to reﬂect
interdependent relations between components. The following
example justiﬁes this construction: In the 3D-printer, the
property of the material deposition rate is dependent upon
the technology in use, the material processed and, in case
of the FDM technology, the nozzle diameter of the extruder
installed in the 3D-printer. See the following excerpt from
the schema deﬁnition on the components properties and the
implementation on the inﬂuencing factors:

IV. DISCUSSION
The proposed resource description offers the ability to the
user to select the appropriate 3D-printing resource in a sce-
nario where restrictions for the suitable 3D-printing resources
can be derived, from either the users input or from the provided
data ﬁles. Within a 3D-printing service, the user is enabled to
state preferences and restrictions, such as the desired quality
of the 3D-printed object or cost restrictions, based on which
the service itself can query appropriate hardware resources for
their availability and suggest them to the user. Furthermore,
based on the provided models the service can exclude certain
hardware resources if they are not ﬁtting for the task to be
executed. For example, if the model ﬁle is analysed and found
to contain features under a certain threshold, the hardware that
is not capable of manufacturing features of this dimension are
to be excluded.
A perceived problem with the ﬂexibility of the ontology
and resource description is the requirement for contextual
property checking within the service itself. As opposed to strict
formalities possible with the XML Schema Deﬁnition (XSD)
deﬁnition, this ﬂexibility hinders such formality checking. The
3D-printing service must be equipped with a component that is
capable of evaluating the provided properties and check them
for completeness, applicability and correctness. The resource
description also allows for the encapsulation of third-party 3D-
printing services within the 3D-printing service itself, where
the capabilities of these services are regarded as a resource
and described as such.
V. CONCLUSION
This work provides an ontology of the AM domain with
extensible and ﬂexible constructs. The derived XSD provides
ﬂexibility for extensions, based on future developments of
3D-printing hardware. The ﬂexibility also allows for user-
centric extensions and use-cases. The use case for this work
is the deployment in a 3D-printing service but other use cases
are also provided, such as the use within a recommender
system for the design and modelling phase, or purchase
recommendation systems. The list of properties (Table II) can
form a basis for further research and individual extension. The
examples provided are intended to ease understanding of the
list’s compilation.
In future work, it is recommended to extend the ontology
to include concepts that enable the expression of immaterial
capabilities and abilities, such as the expertise in certain
domains, e.g., Aerospace engineering, medical engineering
or bioprinting, in AM. Furthermore, it is recommended to
enable the expression of proﬁciency in areas related to the
3D-printing lifecycle or process itself, e.g., proﬁciency with
the design process, with the software / IT components or with
legal and business concepts for AM.
This schema will be fully implemented and evaluated in an
upcoming project. In this project, the evaluation will be on
the usefulness and usability of the ontology. This evaluation
will utilise both expert and user surveys. Furthermore, the
evaluation will compare this proposed method in respect of
expressiveness and suitability.
