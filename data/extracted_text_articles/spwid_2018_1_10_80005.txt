Abstract— The robot technology is developing to improve 
human life and that substitutes human function and capability. 
The key factor of wearable robot is a human-robot interaction. 
The purpose of this study is to analyze the ergonomic factors of 
a human-robot interaction based on literature reviews. To 
search for ergonomic factors on a human-robot interaction, we 
looked into four databases in Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE 
Explore, and Google Scholar. This study reviewed literature 
including papers, books, international standards published 
from January 1st, 2000 to May 1st, 2018. The title and abstract 
of literature was checked by authors. Selected literature was 
reviewed and the main factors were manually extracted. There 
were twelve literature that met the inclusion criteria. This 
study evaluated the ergonomic factors of human-robot 
interaction categorized as safety, human and robot factors 
which were warning sign, stability, fail-safe, range of motion, 
fatigue, contact pressure, motion intention, misalignment, 
power, closed-loop system, and etc. These ergonomic factors 
are suggested to the safety and usability evaluation systems by 
developing ergonomic design specifications of wearable robots.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The robot technology is developing to improve industry 
productivity and convenience in human life. The application 
of wearable robotics is growing in various fields such as 
industry, rehabilitation, prosthetics, space application and 
defense. A wearable robot can be seen as a technology that 
extends, complements, substitutes human function and 
capability or replaces [1]. 
Previous studies still have focused on developing and 
improving the mechanical performance of a wearable robot. 
However, the key distinctive aspect in wearable robots is 
their Human-Robot Interaction(HRI).  An HRI is a hardware 
and software link that connects to both human and robot 
systems [2]. 
The purpose of this study is to analyze to the ergonomic 
factors of HRI on a wearable robot through a literature 
review. 
II. 
METHOD 
The purpose of this method is to search main factors in 
HRI, and to identify potential ergonomic factors. This review 
details the findings from four electronic databases via 
keyword searches in Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Explore, 
and Google Scholar. For this study, we searched literature 
related with HRI of wearable robot including papers, public 
documents, books, international standards and report 
published from January 1st, 2000 to May 1st, 2018. 
Regarding the search keyword, the search criteria used 
were ‘human robot interaction’, ‘ergonomics’, ‘human 
factor’, ‘usability’, ‘safety’ and ‘comfortability’. To avoid 
literature not falling into the topic under study, the search 
was performed using the Boolean operator “AND”, with the 
search term ‘ergonomics’ [3]. 
The following additional inclusion criteria were used to 
search the literature: 
 
a. 
Published as a full text literature, or in press, in peer-
reviewed journals 
b. Published or in press between January 1st, 2000 and 
prior May 1st, 2018 
c. 
Literature in this study includes that paper, article, 
public document, book, international standard and 
issue report 
d. Literature that considered HRI on wearable robot 
e. 
Literature with an ergonomics studies or application 
purpose 
 
The process of literature review, titles and abstracts were 
checked separately by three of the authors. Prior to literature 
review, inclusion criteria were identified and corresponding 
relevant information required was analyzed. Then, the 
selected relevant literature was reviewed and the main 
factors manually extracted. 
III. 
RESULT 
A total of 51 literatures were searched, of which 12 
literatures that met the inclusion criteria [4]-[15]. Table 1 
shows the reviewed literature evaluated for the ergonomic 
factors. It categorized as safety, human and robot factors as 
follows: warning sign, emergency stop, stability, temperature, 
fail-safe, range of motion, fatigue, contact pressure, motion 
intention, misalignment, power, weight, operation type, 
closed-loop system, and etc.

DISCUSSION 
Based on these results, this study suggested three 
grouped ergonomic HRI factors including the safety for 
human-robot interaction, the usability for human, and the 
mechanical specification to ensure the human safety. A 
factor of HRI on wearable robot are suggested to the safety 
and usability evaluation system by developing ergonomic 
design specifications of wearable robots. This study is based 
on content literature review techniques that briefly reviews 
abstracts, key contents and passages. It means that the results 
of this study do not represent a detailed review of literature, 
or the impact of their findings.
