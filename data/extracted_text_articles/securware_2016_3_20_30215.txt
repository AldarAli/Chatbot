Abstract - The iris recognition is known for a long time. 
Identification by iris is positively perceived by the public, like 
fingerprinting. Devices for acquiring images are cheaper and 
smaller, compared with other technologies. This article aims to 
verify the reliability of the scanner of the iris in different 
conditions. The measurement is performing on the scanner 
iCAM7000. The measurement is performing in different 
lighting conditions, in the artificial lighting, reduction in the 
lighting conditions and in daylight. Thereafter the percentage 
of success of authorization is measured during physical 
activity.

 INTRODUCTION  
Biometric analysis of an iris is relatively new and rapidly 
evolving field, which is primarily used to uniquely identify 
individuals. Identification by an iris is relatively well known 
for a long time [2]. A full implementation of this technology 
in practice was not possible because of low-quality digital 
sensors. Currently, iris recognition is considered to be one 
of the most reliable technologies and one of the most secure 
methods of identification [11] [13] [14] [15]. 
There are several research publications which deal 
biometric devices [3] [4] [5].  However, little attention is 
paid to the effectiveness of these devices. For this reason, in 
this paper, we address the state of the art in terms of 
efficiency of biometric equipment. 
 This paper describes and analyses iris scanner reliability 
under various lighting conditions and the probability of 
correct recognition. 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The Section 
II contains the Introduction to the iris recognition. The 
Section III describes the iris scanner iCAM7000. The 
Section IV contains details of the scanning procedure. While, 
The Section V explains the methods of measurement and 
followed by the results. And finally in Section VI, the 
contribution of our work is described in the conclusion. 
 
II. 
IRIS 
The iris is formed together with the eye in the prenatal 
development in the third month. Within the structure of 
the iris (Figure 1) a pattern is formed until the eighth 
month of gestation, although the pigment will be 
established in the postnatal period.  The iris is composed 
of collagen fibers which form certain patterns. The color 
of the iris is different form person to person, and this color 
is created by the pigment melanin. The size of the iris is 
about 11 mm. The structure is stable during a person's live 
and remains similar after mechanical damage too.  In our 
picture, it is possible to detect 266 features [1] [2] [6].

 
Pigment spots - Random clump of pigment cells 
on the surface of the cornea, ciliary occurrence in 
the area. 
 
Crypts – A dark place where the iris is thin, the 
incidence at the interface between the ciliary and 
papillary zones. 
 
Pigmented folds - The bottom layer of the iris 
around the pupil. 
 
Radial grooves - Occurrence near the pupil and 
extending radially towards the edge of the iris.

THE IRIS SCANNER ICAM7000 
The scanning of an iris was performed by the scanner 
iCAM7000 (Iris identification Systems; series Iris 
Access® 7000) [10].   This scanner scans the iris in a fully 
automatic way and also captures the image of the face

around eyes. iCAM 7000 has a voice and a visual 
interface, which makes it faster and more accurate to scan 
the iris and subsequently identify/verify a person. 60 – 
70% of iris visibility is sufficient for successful 
identification of a person [10].    
   
 
 
Figure 2.  The necessary distance for capturing an image (adapted from 
[10])  
The iCAM is activated when the user approaches or 
provides the identification card. The scanner is able to take a 
picture from the distance of 31 – 35 cm (Figure 2). The 
scanner uses the dot indicated in Figure 2, which is 
projected on the root of the nose; this helps the user adjust 
and correct the eye position. When the user is in the correct 
position, the orange dot is changed to green. The whole 
process is completed with a voice command to easier 
capture the image [10]. 
IV. 
IRIS SCANNING 
The processing procedure is divided into four parts: 
segmentation, normalization, extraction and comparison 
(Figure 3). 
 
 
Figure 3.  The processing procedure of iris (adapted from [9])    
 
1) Capturing an image 
Various negative factors may occur during the image 
capturing from the sensor. They can result in deterioration 
of image processing. There are many negative influences 
(for examples: noise, blur, etc.) After the elimination of 
these effects, the accuracy of the biometric system is 
increased. The sensor transforms all colour images into grey 
spectrum and it eliminates tone colour aberration.   
Color aberrations can arise as a result of charge-coupled 
device sensors (CCD sensors) used. After this process, it is 
necessary to normalize the colour spectrum of the captured 
image for better edge enhancement [3] [4].    
 
 
 
2) Segmentation 
The second step is segmentation, which determines the 
position of the iris and the pupil (Figure 4). This part of 
analysis is among the slowest processes in the whole 
system. This is caused by the necessity to determine the 
position of the iris and the pupil, and to correct all the edges 
of the captured image.  
Various algorithms exist to detect edges of the image, 
such as Cannes’s edge detector algorithm. This algorithm is 
based on identification of gradient among nearby pixels [8] 
[9].

3) Normalization 
The coordinates of points from the scanned iris and its 
centre are the basis of normalization. The method works by 
converting the annulus shaped iris into a rectangular shape. 
The resulting image is a rectangle with coordinates of 
radiuses and angles. On the short side of the rectangle i.e. 
vertical axis, there are radiuses of a circle and on the long 
side i.e. horizontal axis, angular coordinates. This is a 
transfer of Cartesian coordinates into polar coordinates [7] 
[9].    
 
4) Extraction of characters 
The following step is an extraction of characters, when 
the input data are extracted and encoded in major characters. 
The result is a two-bit piece of information that contains the 
coordinates of the iris [7] [9]. 
 
5) Comparison 
This is the last step where the comparison of characters 
with the template stored in the database takes place and the 
result is called the degree of similarity. The degree of 
similarity shows the similarity between the code templates

and the code of the iris. If the characters match the template 
stored in the database, the system allows the access and in 
the opposite case the access is denied. The comparison was 
carried out using the Hamming distance between two points 
[9].    
 
 
Figure 5.  Shifting process (adapted from [7])   
The Hamming distance of two templates is calculated, 
one template is shifted left and right bit-wise and a number 
of Hamming distance values are calculated from successive 
shifts (Figure 7). One shift is defined as one shift left, and 
one shift right of a reference template. In this example, one 
filter is used to encode the templates, so only two bits are 
moved during a shift. The lowest Hamming distance, in this 
case zero, is used since this corresponds to the best match 
between the two templates [7].   
 
V. 
METHODS OF MEASUREMENT AND RESULTS 
Several measurements were carried out in various 
conditions to verify the reliability of the iris scanner: 
 
 
Visibility in poor lighting - The measurement was 
performed in daylight, in poor light conditions and 
under artificial lighting. 
 
During physical exertion - The measurement was 
performed after physical exertion. 
 
Six subjects were used for the measurements. Each time 
there were 10 measurements. The success percentages of 
these measurements were recorded in result tables. 
The first measurement was performed in various light 
conditions in order to investigate the success percentage of 
authorization under these circumstances. Furthermore, the 
influence of glasses and contact lenses was investigated. 
Thereafter, the measurement of success percentage of 
authorization was performed during physical activity.

Table 1 shows a comparison of measurements in different 
light conditions. There are measurements in daylight, in 
poor light conditions and in artificial lighting. In the case of 
subjects without glasses, the success rate is 100%. In the 
case of subjects wearing glasses, the success rate was 
between 60% - 90%.  This may be due to the number of 
diopters of the subject. As can be seen in the case of subject 
6, contact lenses have no effect on identification.

In Table 2, we can see the success percentage of 
authorization after physical activity. The measurement was 
performed on 3 subjects who put a physical strain on their 
bodies, and subsequently used the scanner for identification. 
In all subjects, the physical exertion had no effect on 
authorization. However, in the case of subject 5, who had 
run for 5 minutes up the stairs, the identification took much 
longer in order for the person to be recognized. 
 
VI. 
CONCLUSION  
Iris recognition methodology is known for a long time, 
but its full implementation in practice was possible only 
with the extension of high-quality digital sensors.

Identification by iris is positively perceived by the public, 
like fingerprinting. Compared to other technologies, devices 
for taking pictures are smaller and cheaper. 
The main objective of this paper was to create 
comparative 
measurements 
for 
future 
work. 
The 
measurements were performed on the scanner iCAM7000. 
The measurements were carried out in different light 
conditions, in artificial lighting, poor light conditions and in 
daylight. In the daylight, it was found that the measured data 
showed a lower percentage of success in measuring with a 
lot of diopters. The use of contact lenses was found to have 
no effect on the device function. Another measurement was 
focused on the effect of physical activity on authorization. 
Based on the measurements, we conclude that physical 
activity has almost no effect on user authorization to access. 
The future work will be related to artificial intelligence 
and utilization of neural networks for recognizing and 
identifying persons by iris. The results from artificial 
intelligence measurements and from the measurements 
performed in this work (iCAM7000) will be compared. The 
goal of this work is to increase efficiency of biometric 
identification by iris in various light conditions.
