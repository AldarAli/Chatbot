Abstract—The proliferation of smartphones has lead to the
development of a large variety of applications and the
inverstigation on the use of various sensors through context-
awareness, in order to provide better services. However,
smartphone battery capacity is extremely limited, so that the
applications cannot be effectively used. In this paper, we
propose a low-power context-aware system using modular
Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks are known to respond
flexibly to uncertain situations. However, probabilistic models,
such as Bayesian networks,
have high time complexity,
resulting in high power consumption. To reduce the time
complexity, we modularize the network based on the Markov
boundary, and eliminate the use of GPS because it consumes a
lot of power. We compare the accuracy of the system using a
combination of sensors and confirm the decrease in the time
complexity. Experiments with the real data collected show that
the proposed Bayesian networks yield an accuracy of 92.47%.

INTRODUCTION
With the widespread production of smartphones along
with its diverse array of applications and sensors, the trend of
smartphone applications has shifted towards the personal and
intelligent service route. Many researchers have investigated
the
possibility
of
intelligence
techniques
for
context-
awareness. The battery capacity of a smartphone, however, is
well behind the development of applications. In a typical
case, the user has to carry an extra battery or charge it
frequently. There is the critical issue of how to reduce
battery consumption for the context-awareness on the
smartphone [1].
In this paper, we propose a low-power context-aware
system
using
Bayesian
networks.
We
focus
on
the
configuration of input sensors and the inference time of the
system. In the configuration of input sensors, the GPS sensor
is a very important tool for situational context-awareness
because the state of the user is closely related to the location.
However, GPS usually consumes the highest amount of
power and induces the need for a large location database in
order to convert semantic location. For this reason, we
choose to infer the user position not by GPS, but by
determining whether the user is indoors or outdoors using the
temperature and humidity sensors. In terms of reduction of
time complexity, the Bayesian Network (BN) is modularized
based on the Markov boundary [2].
We compare the accuracy using different combinations
of sensors and evaluate the inference time of the proposed
method against a monolithic network. In addition, we verify
the low-power consumption feature of the proposed method
in a real smartphone environment using the power tutor
application.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the
related works for context-awareness, battery consumption,
and Bayesian networks. Section 3 describes in detail the
proposed low-power context-aware system. Finally, Section
4 reports the experiments conducted to compare the power
consumption of the proposed system with the conventional
system.

RELATED WORKS
A.
Context aware services in smartphone
A context can be defined as information that can be used
to characterize the situation of an entity, such as the person,
place, or device that is considered relevant to the interaction
between the user and the application [3]. Context-aware
applications recognize the situation and provide services.
The services have been studied using various sensors, as
shown in Table I.

Otebolaku and Andarade developed a context-aware
mobile application [4]. The system used classifiers for
recognizing high-level contexts from low-level sensor data.
Wang, et al. presented a probabilistic model to integrate
contextual information with music content analysis to offer
music recommendation for daily activities [5]. Santos et al.
described
the
architecture,

and
potential
applications of a prototype system developed within the
User-Programmable Context-Aware Services (UPCASE)
project [6]. Phithakkitnukoon and Dantu proposed a three-
step approach in designing the model based on the embedded
sensor data for controlling alert mode [7]. Chone and Cha
presented the smartphone-based context provider [8]. The
system
used
the
activity,
connectivity,
location
and
environment for inferring the current context. However,
these previous works focus on the high accuracy of
awareness using as much information as possible. These
researches do not consider the power consumption of the
context-aware system.

Power consumption problem

Trend of smartphone service
Various sensors have been implemented in smartphones,
and the applications are utilizing these sensors. Although the
battery
capacity
of
smartphone
has
improved,
it
is
insufficient to freely use a variety of applications. Fig. 1
shows the trend of smartphone services and the improvement
of battery capacity. The energy consumption of these sensors
is various, depending on the kind of smartphone. Abdesslem,
et al. measured the energy consumption of different sensors
[9]. Each sensor was run continuously on a Nokia N95 8GB
smartphone until the battery was depleted. In this research,
the power consumption of GPS was 623mW, which is 10
times more than the power consumption of the accelerometer
senor. Wang, et al. measured the energy consumption using
Nokia N95, as well [10]. In this research, the power
consumption of GPS was 0.3308W, which is 7 times more
than the power consumption of accelerometer. Although
GPS sensor is more important for detecting user location, it
has high energy consumption.
Many researchers proposed low-power applications using
context-awareness to solve sensor problems. Herrmann et al.
proposed to use context knowledge to dynamically adapt the
behavior of sensing applications running on smartphones
[11]. In the system, a context-aware application manager
starts, suspends and changes the sampling rate of the sensors.
Bareth and Kupper proposed a hierarchical positioning
algorithm [12]. The algorithm dynamically deactivates
different positioning technologies and only activates the
positioning method with the least energy consumption. Seo
et al. proposed a context-aware configuration manager for
smartphones [13]. The system changes the configuration
settings of a smartphone in response to changes in context,
according to user-defined policy rules. These previous pieces
of research focused on the management of the sensor, and
they were not interested in reducing the power consumption
of the inference module.
C.
Context-aware service using Bayesian networks
Bayesian networks is a graph-theoretic concept for
representing uncertain and incomplete knowledge using
Bayesian statistics. BN has a structure of a directed acyclic
graph which represents the link relations of the node, and has
conditional probability tables (CPT). Assume that nodes are
independent of each other.

is a set of nodes, and the joint probability
distribution is computed by the chain rules as equation (1).
For each child node, conditional probabilities are allocated
for each combination of states in their parent nodes, so that
the size of each CPT depends on the number of parent nodes
and the number of their states, as follows:

where S is the number of states, and
iP is the number of

can increase considerably with the number of parents, which
can make the process of calculating the CPT intractable,
especially if this is done through expert elicitation [14].
There are two approaches to identify the structure and
parameter of a Bayesian network model. The first approach
is the learning from the data on problem domains. The
learning of structure is useful if we have a lack of
understanding about the system. The method requires a
sufficient amount of data, but it is not easy to obtain reliable
data in many real-world problems.
The second one is to construct the model based on the
domain knowledge. The experts identify the structure and set
of parameters according to their knowledge, if we do not
have enough data in the domain. In the context-aware service,

Bayesian networks have been used for sensor fusion [15].
Lee and Cho proposed two-layered Bayesian networks for
inference on a mobile phone [16]. This network was
designed with the domain knowledge. The performance of
Bayesian network using the domain knowledge can be
evaluated through the scenarios or collected data [17]. In the
field of context-awareness on the smartphone, the number of
the used sensors is proportional to the number of nodes in
BN. Therefore, selecting the sensor used for context-
awareness is very important to reduce the time complexity.
III.
LOW-POWER CONTEX-AWARE SYSTEM
Figure 2.
System archtecture
In this paper, we propose a low-power context-aware
system. The system considers the power consumption and
the sensors combination which are needed for inferring the
user situation. Fig. 2 illustrates the system architecture for
context-awareness. The system consists of three modules:
sensor collection, data preprocessing, and context-awareness.
In this proposed architecture, we do not use the GPS sensor
because of the energy consumption. The sensor collection
module obtains continuous sensor data in the smartphone.
The data are sent to the data preprocessing module that
discretizes them using a decision tree and a naïve Bayes
classifier. The context-awareness module infers the user
situation using a Bayesian network that is modularized based
on Markov boundary. If the result of inference is higher than
the threshold, it is the current situation. However, if all the
results of a situation are less than the threshold, the module
does not infer the current situation.
A.
Data preprocessing
The purpose of data preprocessing is to reduce the time
complexity of the Bayesian network modules. The number of
states of input node is proporional to the size of CPT,
because the parameter S in equation (2) is selected as the
number of states. There are two discretization methods for
input data. First, the input can be divided into a predefined
number of intervals of equal width such as 0~1, 4~8, 8~12,
12~16, and so on. Second, it can be divided using statistical
methods. For instance, a range between 22~27℃ represents
‘normal’, 10~22℃ is ‘cold’ and ‘hot’ indicates between 27℃
to 34℃. Table II shows the result of preprocessing. In this
paper, we use the two preprocessing methods: Decision tree
and naïve Bayes classifier.

A decision tree is a powerful and popular tool for
classification. This method makes rules which can be
understood by humans. The inputs such as temperature,
humidity, microphone, and so on, make the rules as a range
of the division using the decision tree, because the input data
do not need to change into the semantic data. It just needs to
divide each range.
A Naïve Bayes (NB) classifier is a simple probabilistic
classifier based on applying Bayes’ theorem with strong
independence assumption. We infer the user position and
state using NB classifier, because some input data need to be
converted into semantic data, because if each input data are
independent, we do not need Bayesian network. We use the
two methods for preprocessing because the methods have
low complexity.
B.
Tree structure modular Bayesian network
This section presents a modular method of the types of
situation. We design the tree structure Bayesian network for
reducing the time complexity. We identify the three types of
input nodes: The set of situation nodes

situation node S consists of the associated set of type nodes.
Neil proposed a method on how to separate large-scale
Bayesian networks [18]. We define the two types of structure
according to this research.
•
Definition 1 (Result-Type structure): The network is
used to reason about the uncertainty we may have about
our
own
judgments.
This
structure
represents
uncertainties. We have result of preprocessing.
•
Definition 2 (Type-Situation structure): Inferring the
situation needs to reconcile independent source of
evidence about a single attribute of a single entity,
where these sources of evidence have been produced by

different measurements or prediction methods. In this
domain, the type nodes have different attributes and
components. Therefore, the network is to reconcile
independent response to the type node.
Locality of causal relation in a BN can facilitate
decomposition
of
inference
processes.
A
d-separation
concept describes how different parts of BN can be rendered
conditionally independent [2]. Pavlin et al. analyzed locality
of causal relation with the d-separation concept [19].
•
Definition 3 (Markov boundary of a set of variables):
Markov boundary
B( iV )
of a set of variables
Vi ⊂V
in
BN is the union of parents of set
iV and parent of
children of
iV .

We apply this locality of causal relation to the situation
domain which has the response to type nodes as independent.
For the independence, each module uses the sensor that is
directly related to the situation instead of all sensory
information. In the modules, the relations of nodes consist of
two types: Type-Situation and Result-Type.
•
Definition 4 (Type-Situation structure): The situation
nodes represent the probability of the current situation.
The type nodes denote the factors for inferring situation.
For instance, the location, noise, time, and user is
represented the type node. The situations such as
viewing, moving, and studying are represented with the
situation node.
•
Definition 5 (Result-Type structure): The result nodes
denote the obtained value of the sensor. For instance,
the result node of the user state node denotes the values
of user state: staying, and moving.

Modular structure for inferring user situation
Fig. 3 represents the situation module. Each situation
module consists of one Type-Situation structure and one or
more Result-Type structures.

Situation inference process
Figure 4.
Situation inference process
The inference process of the proposed context-aware
system consists of multiple steps, as shown in Fig. 4. First,
the system preprocesses the sensor data. Next, the system
selects a Bayesian network module randomly. Then, the
preprocessed sensor data set the values as evidence. The
module propagates the probability and gets the result. If the
result is larger than the threshold, the result is pushed to a
current situation queue. The current situation queue has the
candidate of the current situation. If the result is smaller than
the threshold, the result is discarded. This step is repeated up
to infer all BN modules. Finally, the system selects the
highest probability of the result.
Figure 5.
Formation of the context
Statistics Korea surveyed the time Korean people use to
perform different activities [20]. In this survey, the students
used a lot of time for sleeping, viewing, studying, and
moving, in that order. We define the three network modules:

moving in the street, viewing, and studying to infer the
situation of the student, because the user does not use the
smartphone when he is sleeping. Fig. 5 shows the formation
of context. In the preprocessing module, the input data
include six types: temperature, humidity, microphone, time,
state, and position. The sensor data are prepossessed and sent
to the context-aware module. The module infers the three
situations: viewing, moving in the street, and studying.
Figure 6.
Example of moving street network
Fig. 6 shows an example of moving in the street network.
In the network, the white color nodes are result nodes, the
right gray nodes are type nodes, and the black node is
situation node. The parameters are trained using Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (MLE). This is the well-known
method for learning the structure and parameters from data
[2]. We collected the data for training parameters using MLE.
The details about the data will be explained in the
experimental section.
IV.
EXPERIMENTS
This section describes the experiments conducted to
evaluate the usefulness of the proposed method. For the
experiments, the evaluation of the proposed method is
conducted on Android phone datasets. The data was
collected from five graduate students for one week. We used
Samsung Galaxy S4. Android phone collected sensor data
two times per second, and the amount of the collected data is
66,849 line. We collected data in three situations: studying,
moving in the street, and viewing. The students selected the
situation and conducted it. Android phone was put into their
pocket.
A.
Combination of sensors
Accuracy comparison for each combination of sensors
verifies
the
accuracy
of
the
method
using
sensor
combinations except GPS. We conduct experiments of
changing from one sensor to five sensors. Fig. 7 shows the
accuracy comparison for each combination of sensors. As the
result, the network using only GPS sensor has the highest
accuracy among the networks using one sensor, because the
GPS sensor can collect user location and relates closely to
the user situation. However, the network uses about 0.3W per
one time, which is not low. The accuracy of networks using
two and three sensors combination, except GPS is less that of
using GPS. The accuracy of network of four sensors;
accelerometer, gyroscope, temperature, and humidity, is
94.25% whose power consumption is less.

The accuracy of the proposed method is higher than the
accuracy of the network using GPS sensor only, because the
proposed method collects user location using temperature
and humidity sensors. Although the network using all
sensors has the highest accuracy, its power consumption is
very high too.
B.
Energy consumption
To verify the relation of the inference time and power
consumption, we calculate them. The PC configuration is
Intel® Core™ i7-2600L CPU, 16.0 GB RAM, Window7.
The inference time is calculated in the PC configuration.
Table III shows the result of inference time, resulting in that
the proposed method reduces more time of about 34% than
monolithic BN. The structure of monolithic BN is trained
using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm [2].

To verify the relation of power consumption, we

the time consumption of the BN and MBN. The BN

consumes 45,241mW for an hour, whereas the MBN
consumes 31,732mW for an hour.
C.
Accuracy of proposed method
We conduct 10-fold cross validation to calculate the
accuracy of each network, as shown in Fig. 9.
Figure 8.
Accuracy and time comparion for each network
The accuracy of the average of MBN is 1.76% less than
the BN while the inference time is 0.389mS more than the
BN. The system for low-power context-awareness has to
consider the inference time and the power consumption, the
proposed method is better than the BN.
V.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this paper, we have proposed a low-power context-
aware system considering the power consumption and sensor
combination. The system uses temperature and humidity to
infer user location instead of using GPS sensor, because the
GPS sensor has high power consumption. We use the
Bayesian network considering the uncertainty of the situation
and modularize to reduce the inference time. The system
infers three situations: moving in the street, viewing, and
studying. To verify the efficiency of the proposed method,
we compare the accuracy of BN of the combination of
sensors and calculate the inference time. In addition, we
confirm
the
power
consumption
using
power
tutor
application
and
verify
the
system
has
lower
power
consumption than the conventional method.
We will modify parameters using obtained data and will
select the optimal time interval of inference. The system will
apply to various context-aware service applications.
