Abstract—Digital cameras equipped with GPS receivers allow 
storing geographic location into the photograph metadata. 
Geographic location constitutes a very important information to 
be used in systems that retrieve and organize photographs. 
However, cameras equipped with GPS may store either invalid 
or null geographic locations. This is usually due to a delay in 
obtaining the GPS signal. In this paper, we propose a new 
method for detection of inconsistencies of geographic locations in 
photograph metadata and for propagation of the geographic 
location annotation for these photographs. Besides, we also 
propose the incorporation of these methods in a Web-based 
system for correction and annotation of geotags. Another 
contribution of this work is the presentation of a case study to 
validate the system. The results prove that the proposed 
techniques increase precision (through the detection of 
inconsistencies) and recall (through the propagation of the 
geographic 
locations) 
in 
the 
retrieval 
of 
georeferenced  
photographs.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The technological advances in the last years have enabled a 
wide use of electronic devices, such as: digital cameras, 
smartphones, and tablets. This popularization caused an 
exponential increase of the amount of multimedia files 
produced by people, such as videos, photographs and audio. 
This phenomenon can be easily verified in social networks, 
blogs and internet sites. The large number of multimedia files 
that has been generated by people has jeopardized information 
management. For example, imagine an user organizing 
manually a collection with thousands of photographs. Even 
manually organizing hundreds of photographs taken during a 
vacation trip is very time consuming and tedious task. 
Several approaches have been proposed for automatic 
organization of photographs, with the objective of reducing the 
user's manual efforts, such as PhotoGeo [1], Naamanet al. [2], 
Cooper et al. [3] and Tsay et al. [4]. Such systems usually 
make use of the photo metadata to help in the organization 
process. Some examples of these metadata include date, time, 
geographic location of the camera at the moment of capture, 
camera manufacturer and model, tags and descriptive data. 
Some studies argue that the place where the photograph 
was taken is one of the first things people remember when they 
want to retrieve that photograph [2]. This means that the 
geographic location of the camera at the time the picture was 
taken is very important for the process of photograph 
organization. 
The integration of GPS chips into smartphones and digital 
cameras have allowed the storage of geographic location in the 
metadata of photographs automatically. Nevertheless, there can 
be some problems related to this information acquisition such 
as data imprecision, invalid data and indoor difficulties. 
The low power of the GPS chips supplied with those 
devices, and the poor quality of the GPS signal in many places  
may generate imprecise geographic location data. Thus, the 
photographs may end up being indicated in places far away 
from the real point where the picture was taken. 
Another problem is the fact that GPS receivers do not work 
well indoors, possibly generating invalid or imprecise data in 
this situation. Some smartphones uses the A-GPS [5] system to 
minimize this problem. 
In other situations, the georeferencing is either absent or 
taken erroneously. For example, suppose that a given person 
with a camera equipped with GPS has captured some 
photographs. We know that it is necessary some instants until 
the chip receives the GPS signal. While the signal is not 
received, the camera will not make the georeference of the 
photographs, or it may use the last geographic information 
captured 
by 
the 
GPS, 
possibly 
generating 
incorrect 
information. However, if the user remains with the camera on 
and the GPS function activated, within a few instants the 
photographs will be taken with correct geographic information. 
In this work, we propose an automatic and semiautomatic 
photograph georeferencing system based on the detection of 
inconsistencies of geographic location data and correction 
propagation, with the objective of augmenting the georeference 
recall and precision in a photograph collection. The proposed

system uses temporal segmentation and the geographic location 
of some georeferenced photographs to detect inconsistencies in 
the locations. The system also suggests new annotations for the 
photographs with mistakes or without annotation. 
The remaining of the paper is structured as follows. In 
Section II, we highlight some studies related to the subject 
approached in this paper. Next, Section III focuses on the 
prototype architecture. Section IV addresses the solutions 
proposed in this paper, for detection of inconsistencies and 
suggestion of geographic location annotation. Section V 
presents the evaluation of the proposed solutions through 
experiments and analysis of the results. Finally, in Section VI, 
we present the conclusion and discuss further work to be 
undertaken. 
II. RELATED WORK 
In this section, we discuss related work. Initially, we 
present studies dealing with the use of tags. Next, we focus on 
the use of content to make the images georeferenced and, 
finally, we present the studies on propagation of geotags. 
Lee et al. [6] highlight the existence of a strong correlation 
between purely textual tags and the geographic location of the 
photographs in social networks. So, in the proposed approach, 
a computation of the similarity between tags and geographic 
location of the photographs was used to determine the 
relationship between the tags and geotags. 
Hays and Efros [7] propose an algorithm called "im2gps", 
that estimates the geographic location of a photograph based on 
the geographic location of photographs with higher visual 
similarity. For such, they used a database containing more than 
6 million georeferenced photographs. 
Hollenstein 
and 
Purves[8] 
carried 
out 
a 
study 
demonstrating that the geotag must be according to the way 
people describe a place, that is, instead of georeference through 
latitude and longitude, tags like "Eiffel Tower", for example, 
should be added. 
Many studies deal with the propagation of tags based on 
geographic location [9] and infer the geographic location based 
on the image content and tags [10]. 
Vandormael and Courdec[11] used the communication 
between devices to check the coherence of the geographic 
location of mobile devices at the moment the photographs are 
captured. 
Ivanov et al. [9] proposed the propagation of geotags based 
on the combination of detection of duplicated objects and the 
user's confidence modeling. The idea is the propagation of 
geotags using other geotagged photographs. 
CrEve [12] is a collaborative event annotation  framework 
that uses photograph content found in social media sites. One 
of the addressed issues is inconsistency of photo metadata. 
However, the user must create an event using social media and 
this framework does not focus on personal photographs.  
In this work, we propose a new automatic and 
semiautomatic scheme for georeferencing photographs that 
uses other already georeferenced photographs from the same 
personal collection. Furthermore, we propose a scheme for 
detection of inconsistencies in the photograph georeferencing 
that uses the spatiotemporal dimension of the collection. To the 
best of our knowledge, there is no work in the literature with a 
similar approach. 
III. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE 
The proposed approach was integrated to PhotoGeo [1]. 
PhotoGeo is a digital multimedia library specialized in 
georeferenced photographs. It has a multilayer architecture and 
was developed in compliance to the MVC (Model-View-
Controller) design pattern. 
Figure 1 presents the PhotoGeo architecture, highlighting 
the data, business logic and view layers. In this work, we added 
the Photograph Georeferencing module, responsible for 
integrating the detection of inconsistencies and georeferencing 
propagation. This module is described in detail the next 
section. 
 
 
The data layer comprises two databases: an object-
relational database 
(PostgreSQL) 
with 
spatial 
support 
(PostGIS); and the user photograph collections. 
The business logic layer comprises the following main 
modules: Data Management, User Management, Contact 
Management, Photograph Management and Photograph 
Georeferencing. These modules will be detailed next. 
Data Management is responsible for accessing and 
mapping of data in objects. In this module, JPA (Java 
Persistence API) is used to make the data persistence. 
User Management and Contact Management modules are 
responsible for managing of system users and contacts, 
respectively. 
The Photograph Management module is in charge of 
inserting, removing and retrieving photographs, besides

extracting metadata. Moreover, in this module the access 
permissions for the photographs are checked. 
The communication between the view layer and the 
business logic layer is made through REST (Representational 
State Transfer). Figure 2 shows the prototype interface used to 
present inconsistencies, and suggestions for the correction and 
georeferencing of photographs. 
IV. DETECTION AND CORRECTION OF INCONSISTENCIES 
In this section, we present the solution proposed for 
propagation and detection of inconsistencies in geotags. 
A. Geotags Propagation 
In this subsection, we present the solution proposed for 
geotag propagation from georeferenced photographs to non 
georeferenced ones, in the same personal collection. First, we 
perform a temporal segmentation on the set of photographs, 
using the 𝑡max ⁡segmentation time input parameter, in minutes. 
Assuming that F is a set of 𝑛 photographs, the temporal 
segmentation is responsible for separating the photographs into 
𝑘 non intersecting clusters 𝑔, in such a way that: 
 
  𝑔𝑗
𝑘
𝑗=1
 = 𝐹 
(1) 
 
This segmentation produces clusters whose photographs 
have a maximum temporal difference of 𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥  minutes between 
two temporal consecutive photographs. That is, considering 
that 𝑓𝑖, and 𝑓𝑖+1 are two consecutive photographs in the cluster 
𝑔𝑘, and that 𝑡𝑖 and 𝑡𝑖+1 are their timestamps, then 𝑡𝑖+1 − 𝑡𝑖 ≤
𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 . The photograph collection will be segmented based on 
Equation (2) and each photograph will belong to exactly one 
cluster.   
 
𝑓1  ∈ 𝑔1
𝑓𝑖+1  ∈ 𝑔𝑠if  𝑡𝑖+1 − 𝑡𝑖 ≤ 𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑓𝑖+1  ∈ 𝑔𝑠+1if  𝑡𝑖+1 − 𝑡𝑖 > 𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥
 
(2) 
 
For every cluster 𝑔𝑘 and considering 𝑓𝑔𝑖 as the geographic 
location of the photograph 𝑓𝑖, the iteration is made in order to 
find the non georeferenced photographs (𝑓𝑔𝑖 = ∅). For each 
photograph with no geotag, 𝑓𝑟, we search for a photograph that 
is temporally closer, 𝑓𝑠, inside the same cluster, and that is 
georeferenced (𝑓𝑔𝑠 ≠ ∅). In these cases, photographs with 
GPS state in interoperability mode are not considered. This 
mode indicates that the geotag of the photograph may be 
imprecise. The geotag will be propagated from the photograph 
𝑓𝑠 to 𝑓𝑟. The propagation can be automatic, without user 
interaction, or semiautomatic, when the user may accept or 
reject the suggestion. 
When the propagation occurs, the same procedure is done, 
recursively, for other non georeferenced photographs. So, the 
new geotag of 𝑓𝑟, which was propagated from𝑓𝑠, may be 
propagated to other photographs. 
B. Geotag Inconsistence Detection 
In this subsection, we present the proposed algorithm for 
detection of geotag inconsistencies in photographs. This 
algorithm iterates on a subset of photographs, 𝐹, in a personal 
collection of a certain user, locating the georeferenced 
photographs. For each georeferenced photograph, 𝑓𝑖, we 
retrieve the photograph 𝑓𝑗, that has the smallest timestamp 
difference with respect to 𝑓𝑖. Right after that, the maximum 
tolerable spatial distance (mtsd) between the photographs is 
computed, through Equation (3). This computation is made by 
computing the difference from 𝑓𝑖 timestamp (ti) to 𝑓𝑖timestamp 
(tj), and multiplying it by the mean shift speed (mss).  
 
𝑚𝑡𝑠𝑑 =  𝑡𝑖 − 𝑡𝑗 × 𝑚𝑠𝑠 (3) 
(3) 
 
The mss is the speed of the camera. However, there can be 
adverse circumstances, for example, in the case of a 
photograph being captured from inside an airplane which 
travels at 900 km/h. In this case, the photographs will have a 
considerable spatial distance, due to the shift speed. The same 
problem could happen when pictures are taken from inside a 
train, car or any other kind of vehicle which travels at high 
speed. For these situations, it is possible to capture speed 
information from the GPS chip. The mss must be supplied as 
one of the input parameters of the algorithm. 
Right after that, we compute the spatial distance (d) 
between the photographs 𝑓𝑖 and 𝑓𝑗, using their geotags. In the 
case 𝑑 is greater than 𝑚𝑡𝑠𝑑, the algorithm points out that there 
is a georeference inconsistence between the photographs, 
because it is unlikely that, moving from 𝑓𝑡𝑗, with a mean speed 
mss, the user reaches  the location of 𝑓𝑔𝑖. 
 
𝑑 = 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒(𝑓𝑖 , 𝑓𝑗);  
if 𝑑 > 𝑚𝑡𝑠𝑑,
𝑑 ≤ 𝑚𝑡𝑠𝑑,
 𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒
𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒

I. EVALUATION 
In this section, we present the experiments carried out to 
validate the solutions proposed in this work for geotag 
propagation and inconsistency detection, respectively. Besides, 
we also present the methodologies used to perform the 
experiments. 
A. Geotag Propagation 
In order to validate the geotag propagation scheme, we 
performed experiments to  compare the geotags propagated by 
the algorithms, both in automatic and semiautomatic mode, 
with the real location of the non georeferenced photographs.

Figure 2. Photograph georeferencing interface. 
To carry out the experiments, we used the precision and 
recall metrics. Precision is defined as the ratio between the 
correct propagation and all the photographs with geotag 
propagated. The propagation is considered correct when it is 
within a maximum tolerable distance (mtd), in meters, from the 
real geographic location of the photograph (informed by the 
user). On the other hand, recall is computed as the ratio 
between the correct propagation to the all non-georeferenced 
photographs in the collection. 
To perform the experiments, we used a collection 
containing 4,153 photographs, from which 503 (12.11%) are 
not georeferenced. In order to automate the experiments, we 
obtained manually from the users the correct location of each 
photograph using a map. 
Figure 3 presents the results for the computation of 
precision in semiautomatic mode, varying the parameters mtd 
from 10 to 300, with a step of 10. Each line in that graphic 
represents an experiment for a different 𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 . The parameter 
𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥  varied from 5 to 60 minutes, at every five minutes. Figure 
4 presents precision for the automatic mode, with the same 
variations of the parameters mtd and 𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 . 
We notice that precision increases when the segmentation 
time 𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 falls, because the longest the temporal distance 
between the photographs in the cluster is, more distant will be 
the propagated geotag, that is, it becomes more imprecise. With 
respect to the mtd parameter, precision is directly proportional, 
because the longest the tolerable distance is, more propagations 
will be considered to be correct. 
In both cases, the best value of the 𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥  parameter was five 
minutes. So, we chose the value to analyze the best precision 
for both modes. Thus, in semiautomatic mode, we achieved 
precisions varying from 94.89% to 97.08%. On the other hand, 
in automatic mode, we achieved precisions between 92.05% 
and 96.97%. We notice, then, in both cases, high precision was 
achieved, but semiautomatic mode gave better results. 
 
 
Figure 3 -  Precision for the propagation experiment in semiautomatic 
mode. 
For recall, using 5 minutes for 𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 , we did not achieve 
good results (71.3% - 74.9% in semiautomatic mode, and 
71.1%-72.7% in automatic mode). In Figure 5 we illustrate the 
result for recall in semiautomatic mode and in Figure 6 for 
automatic mode. Each line in the graphics represents a 
variation of the 𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥  parameter. It can be noticed that recall is 
inversely proportional to 𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 . This happens because the 
longer is the temporal distance between photographs in a 
cluster, the higher will be the number of geotag propagations in

60 minutes.

Considering a tmax  of 60 minutes, recall varied from

73.97 in automatic mode. 
Figure 7 and Figure 8 illustrate the comparison between 
precision and recall for the automatic and semiautomatic 
modes, for tmax  = 5 minutes (Figure 7) and tmax  = 60 minutes 
(Figure 8).

B. Detection of Inconsistencies in Geotags 
To validate the geotag inconsistency detection scheme, we 
ran an experiment to compare the inconsistencies detected by 
the scheme and current inconsistencies in a database. 
In order to carry the experiments out, we used a real 
collection with 1,040 photographs captured with a camera 
withan integrated GPS chip. From those photographs, 944 
(90.77%) are georeferenced, among which 112 (11.86%) have 
the GPS status in interoperability mode. The user informed, 
through an application, which photographs had inconsistencies 
in their geotags, so that they could be compared to the 
inconsistencies pointed by the system, and possibly has allow 
the automation of the experiment. 
Figure 9 presents a graphic with the precision and recall 
metrics. The parameter mss varied from 1 to 120 km/h, in steps 
of 1 km/h. Through the graphic, we notice that precision is 
directly proportional to the parameter mss, i.e., the higher the 
mean shift speed, the longer will be the maximum tolerable 
spatial distance between the photographs, with fewer

inconsistencies detected. However, with an increasingly 
number of correct indications. For this reason, recall is 
expected to be inversely proportional to mss, since the number 
of inconsistencies pointed by the algorithm becomes smaller.

propagation experiment automatic vs. semiautomatic, for tmax =

Figure 9. Graphic of precision and recall for the detection of 
inconsistencies. 
The parameters were adjusted, and the highest precision 
achieved was 70.37%, for mss of 77 km/h. The maximum 
recall was of 55.81%, for mss = 1 km/h. 
Considering a system for detecting photographs with 
inconsistencies, allowing the user to correct the geotags, high 
precision is more interesting for the algorithms, because it 
avoids the user from getting bored with checking too many 
inconsistencies erroneously reported. So, for this objective, the 
best value for mss is 77 km/h. 
II. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we presented a new method for detection of 
inconsistencies in geographic locations of photographs, and for 
the propagation of geotags to non georeferenced photographs. 
Both approaches presented had good results. The geotag 
propagation achieved precision of 97.08% and recall of 
73.97% in semiautomatic mode, and precision of 96.76% and 
recall of 81.71% in semiautomatic mode. On the other hand, 
the detection of inconsistencies achieved precision of up to 
70.37%, proving to be a good alternative for georeference 
inconsistence correction schemes. 
As future work, we will apply new photograph clustering 
methods and machine learning techniques to estimate the best 
input parameters for the proposed method. Besides, we will 
also analyze the behavior of the proposed ideas for other 
photograph collections.
