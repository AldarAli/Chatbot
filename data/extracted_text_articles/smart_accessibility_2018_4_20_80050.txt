Abstract—If I was a mother of twins, could I find a route to 
enable me to get around with my twin baby stroller using 
public transport? In spite of the relevance of mobility in Smart 
Cities, there are not many websites or apps with which to 
generate public transport routes for people with special needs. 
Of those that do exist, Google Maps is a relevant tool that is 
employed to calculate routes and find points of interest, while 
Google Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) is a format used to 
specify public transport data that allows public transport 
agents to provide a “feed” complying with this specification. 
GTFS is employed by Google to calculate a route and represent 
it on Maps. However, Google Maps does not provide detailed 
information regarding specific facilities such as accessibility to 
transit, and GTFS does not specify the structure required to 
provide that public transport accessibility information. Worse 
still, it is not easy to find specific and detailed accessibility 
information that can be downloaded and processed so as to 
develop services for users. In this work, we propose a 
systematic method with which to provide accessible public 
transport datasets in order to improve mobility in Smart 
Cities.  The steps in the process include the extraction of data 
from the Internet to the generation of open and linked 
datasets. Moreover, we show a case study in which both 
datasets for users with special needs and an app prototype that 
uses those datasets to generate accessible subway routes are 
developed. 
Keywords-Public transport; accessibility; smart city; open 
datasets; linked data. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Smart cities now appear to be ready to meet the challenge 
of a more inclusive society that offers the same opportunities 
for all, and several projects and initiatives have been set up. 
For example, the Global Initiative for Inclusive Information 
and Communication Technologies (G3ICT) [1] works to 
introduce “Smart Cities Programs to Improve Human Rights, 
Civic Engagement, and Business Outcomes”. Another 
example is World ENABLED (WENABLED) [2], which 
promotes more inclusive societies working on policies and 
programs related to human and civil rights. G3ICT and 
WENABLED are working together on a global strategy for 
digital inclusion and have identified barriers to smart city 
accessibility and defined the priority steps required to 
increase accessibility. One of these steps is “Using open and 
accessible datasets that include information by and about 
persons with disabilities” [3]. Smart cities take into account 
aspects as relevant as, for example education, healthcare, and 
transportation. 
With regard to transportation, we feel that it is necessary 
to express public transport accessibility and special needs 
information in a more detailed manner, taking into account 
that this information is extremely important for a more 
inclusive society. As we have said, Google Maps is an 
important tool to calculate routes. To show routes on the 
map, Google takes data specified in GTFS format. Google 
Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) [4] defines a “feed”: a set 
of files that describe data concerning public transport.  
Transport agencies can provide their transport data by means 
this “feed”. Finally, Google employs the “feeds” to calculate 
the routes and represents them on Maps.  
But Google Maps does not provide detailed information 
about specific facilities such as accessibility to transit, and 
GTFS does not specify the structure required to provide that 
public transport accessibility information. In addition, it is 
not easy to find specific and detailed accessibility 
information that can be downloaded and processed. 
In this work, we propose a systematic method to publish 
such public transport accessibility data. This method has 
been validated against real data for the subway in the city of 
Madrid, Spain (Metro Madrid [5]): we had to validate the 
generation of accessible subway routes from these data; to do 
this, we have developed an algorithm which has been 
implemented as part of the Android prototype app. This 
prototype (hence the algorithm) makes it possible to obtain 
an accessible subway route according the Metro Madrid 
user’s needs, a facility that this company does not provide. 
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the 
state of the art of this work. Section 3 describes our 
CoMobility and Access@City projects, which are the context 
of this work. Section 4 introduces some examples of the 
current state of special needs and accessibility information. 
Section 5 describes both our proposal, specifying the process 
used to obtain public transport accessibility datasets, and a 
case study. Our conclusions and future work are presented in 
Section 6.

II. RELATED WORKS 
To the best of our knowledge, currently there are no 
projects which fully define accessibility limitations and their 
relationship to the features of public transport.  
However, there exist several semantic models which 
represent specific aspects of the public transport domain. In 
some cases, they also include accessible wayfinding 
information or/and accessibility features, or elements for 
people with special needs or disabilities. Next, we introduce 
some the more representative among them. 
NaPTAN [6] is a vocabulary with which to identify, in a 
unique manner, the national public transport access nodes of 
the United Kingdom. It does not incorporate any aspect of 
accessibility. The ofi-ontology [7], meanwhile, makes it 
possible to represent whether a place is accessible to people 
with mobility problems by means of classes such as 
AccessFacilities 
and 
properties 
such 
as 
is_wheelchair_accessible, but it does not take into account 
other necessary elements in order to provide blind or deaf 
people with information. DBpedia [8] has a property 
denominated 
as 
isHandicappedAccessible 
to 
indicate 
whether or not a transit station is accessible. Tube Facility 
ontology [9] incorporates only step free and lift facilities as 
accessibility elements (mobility disabilities). Accessibility 
Ontology [10] is similarly also focused on concepts related 
to supporting only mobility disability problems. TRANSIT 
[10] is a specific ontology for transit but it does not 
incorporate any aspects of accessibility to human transport. 
Landmark Ontology for Hiking [12] is focused on older 
adults and allows them to walk less through the use of 
wheelchairs. It formally represents landmarks for hiking. 
The European OASIS (Open architecture for Accessible 
Services Integration and Standardisation) project [13] does 
not incorporate relevant concepts for needs regarding 
accessibility to public transport.  
Transmodel [14] is a European Reference Data Model for 
Public Transport Information, which provides both a model 
of public transport concepts and data structures that may be 
useful when building information systems related to the 
different kinds of public transport. It does not, however, 
provide any information about accessibility. IFOPT 
metamodel [15] was conceived as an extension of 
Transmodel. It is a prCEN (“Comité Européen de 
Normalisation –CEN-“ in French) Technical Specification 
and defines a model (and also the identification principles) 
for the main fixed objects related to public access to Public 
Transport (e.g. stop points, stop areas, stations, connection 
links, entrances, etc.). It already includes specific structures 
with which to describe accessibility data concerning the 
equipment of vehicles, stops and access areas. 
III. THE CONTEXT: COMOBILITY AND ACCESS@CITY 
PROJECTS 
This work is being developed in the context of two 
related research projects: CoMobility and Access@City. 
CoMobility [16] defines a multimodal architecture based 
on linked open data for sustainable mobility. Its main goals 
are to improve citizens’ mobility, optimize their trips by 
combining public transport and the sharing of private 
transport (e.g., car sharing), and also provide a means for 
accessible trips.  
Access@City [17] is a coordinated project that defines a 
technological framework in which to process, manage and 
use open data concerning public transport with the goal of 
promoting its accessibility. One of its subprojects is 
Multiply@City [18], which is focused on processing and 
harmonizing public transport accessibility data in a semantic 
manner, taking into account that data is provided by 
different sources and will have different formats. It is, 
therefore, necessary to integrate accessibility data, obtained 
from open data and by means of Web scraping, and 
accessible routes, obtained by employing crowdsourcing 
techniques with those users who use mobile technologies. 
Figure 1 provides a general depiction of this project.

IV. THE CURRENT STATE 
It is not currently easy for users with special needs to find 
detailed information regarding public transport on the 
Internet. In some cases, no accessibility information exists, 
while in others, it is available only in HTML format (a non-
computable format). Only in exceptional cases is it possible 
to find this information in a computable format. 
In this section, we show some examples of how detailed, 
open and linked the information for users with special needs 
is. First, we present a study concerning the accessibility 
information regarding the metro transport media of fourteen 
European cities. We then go on to describe the GTFS format, 
which provides the detailed structure employed to specify 
public transportation schedules and associated geographic 
information. This can be computable, but has great 
limitations in terms of specifying transport media 
accessibility information. 
A. Accessibility information of European metro 
We have carried out a study on the accessibility of the 
metro and about how computable that accessibility 
information is. Our study is based on the information 
obtained from the official metro websites of several 
European cities (see TABLE I).

We have focused on the fourteen cities, which have the 
largest metro networks -in kilometers-. These cities are, in 
alphabetical order: Barcelona, Berlin, Hamburg, Istanbul, 
London, Madrid, Milan, Moscow, Munich, Oslo, Paris, 
Rome, Saint Petersburg and Vienna. We have then analyzed 
how open, linked and computable the data on the websites 
are, that is, how many stars they have attained in the linked 
open data 5-star classification of Tim Berners-Lee [22]. To 
finish, we have checked, for each city, whether accessibility 
data exists on the website. We concluded that: 
a) no city has four or five stars for the data shown on its 
website, that is, there is no linked open data on the metro 
companies’ official websites; 
b) 10/14 cities provide open data of the lowest category 
(the one-star category); 
c) 3/14 cities only provide data as regards the three star 
category; 
d) 8/14 cities show transport media accessibility. 
 
It is, therefore, possible to conclude that it is not easy to 
find relevant information about public transport accessibility 
on the Internet. 
B. Accessibility information of GTFS 
GTFS [4] is a format for public transportation schedules 
and associated geographic information. A feed of GTFS is a 
collection of a maximum of six CSV files, with a .txt 
extension. Only two of these files currently include some sort 
of information regarding accessibility and special needs: 
stops.txt and trips.txt. 
With regard to the stops.txt file, GTFS states that “A stop 
is a location where vehicles stop to pick up or drop off 
passengers. Stops can be grouped together, such as when 
there are multiple stops within a single station. This is done 
by defining one stop for the station, and defining it as a 
parent for all the stops it contains. Stops may also have zone 
identifiers, to group them together into zones”. The stops.txt 
file 
includes 
an 
optional 
column 
denominated 
as 
wheelchair_boarding to indicate accessibility to this kind of 
information about a stop. GTFS states that “It identifies 
whether wheelchair boardings are possible from the specified 
stop or station.” 
With regard to the trips.txt file, GTFS states that “A trip 
represents a journey taken by a vehicle through stops. So, a 
single trip represents one journey along a transit line or 
route”. This file includes two columns, both optional, related 
to 
accessibility 
limitations 
or 
special 
needs: 
wheelchair_accessible and bikes_allowed. In this work, we 
address only accessibility aspects and will not, therefore, 
discuss the bikes_allowed field. 
In both files, the accessibility information provided by 
GTFS refers only to mobility impairment, while other 
impairment characteristics have not been considered: the 
special needs of deaf and blind people. In a previous work, 
we proposed to enhance accessibility information in Google 
Maps by adding new pieces of information to GTFS [23]. 
V. OUR PROPOSAL  
The intent of our proposal is to improve accessibility 
information in order to support new social accessibility 
services, such as calculating public transport routes that are 
accessible to all. The eventual objective is to provide datasets 
as open data so as to support these services. 
We work with the Identification of Fixed Objects in 
Public Transport (IFOPT [15]) reference datamodel. It is a

prCEN (“Comité Européen de Normalisation –CEN-“ in 
French) 
Technical 
Specification 
and, 
as 
mentioned 
previously, defines a model (and also the identification 
principles) for the main fixed objects related to public access 
to Public Transport (e.g., stop points, stop areas, stations, 
connection links, entrances, etc.). It already includes specific 
structures with which to describe accessibility data 
concerning the equipment of vehicles, stops and access areas. 
In this work, we describe the process defined in order to 
generate a public transport dataset from public transport data 
and to make it accessible. This process consists of the 
following steps: 
1. Study the accessibility features of the public transport 
network included on the official website of the transport 
media.  
2. Identify the data semantics of this accessibility 
information in order to align them with a reference 
vocabulary (MAnto [24]); 
3. If the alignment is possible, obtain the original data 
and semantically annotate them; if the alignment is not 
possible, analyze the difference between the original data 
and the reference vocabulary in order to extend it and, in 
this case, return to the second step; 
4. Use the dataset as a service to improve the lives of 
citizens and public transport users. 
 
In the following subsection, we validate the process 
against real data for the subway in the city of Madrid, Spain 
(Metro Madrid [2]). 
A. A case study: Collecting and annotating data concerning 
Metro Madrid in Spain 
In order to carry out the case study, it was necessary to 
use real data concerning Metro Madrid. We applied the four 
steps defined in the aforementioned process: 
 First, we studied the lines, the stations on each line and 
the accessibility features. Metro Madrid specifies 
accessibility in two different ways. The first is on the 
stations webpage, where the user can determine whether 
a station is accessible and the kind of accessibility 
(universal or partial). The second is on the specific 
accessible stations webpage, where the user can 
determine the kind of accessibility of each station 
(universal or partial). More information on this website 
can be found in [5]. 
 Second, we identified the data semantics of the Metro 
Madrid accessibility features so as to align them with 
MAnto. TABLE II shows the correspondence between 
both.

 Third, as Metro Madrid does not provide the means 
required to download these data, we developed a scraper 
to determine which stations are accessible and their kind 
of accessibility in each case. This information was 
semantically annotated and stored in RDF/XML 
(Resource Description Framework/eXtensible Markup 
Language) 
[25]. 
The 
accessibility 
information 
concerning Metro Madrid is specified at quay level. 
Each stop place has two quays. For example, at the Sol 
stop place, only quay 2 on line 1 is not accessible for 
wheelchairs, as is shown in Figure 2. 
 
 
Figure 2 Quay 2 on line 1 is not accessible for wheelchairs at the Sol 
stop place. 
The following piece of the code describes the 
accessibility for Metro Madrid, focusing on the Sol stop 
place and the two quays on lines number 1 and 2 (see 
Figure 3).

 Fourth, the dataset was used in the Android prototype 
app. It makes possible for users to obtain an accessible 
route on the metro by means of a specific algorithm, 
taking into account their different needs. Perhaps no 
accessible route exists, but if one does, then this app will 
be able to calculate it. The user interface in Figure 4a 
shows the information the prototype requires in order to 
establish the route: first, the origin and the destination of 
the route; second, the list of user’s special needs (people 
with special mobility needs, blind people, hearing-
impaired people), and third, the characteristics of the 
route (minimizing commutes or stations). The list of 
special needs is related to the columns in TABLE II. As 
previously mentioned, the first column identifies 
universal accessibility (everyone can travel), no lifts or 
ramps (blind and hearing-impaired people can travel, but 
mobility impaired people cannot), and only lifts and 
ramps (people with special mobility needs can travel, but 
blind or deaf people cannot).  
 
 
Figure 4 (a) App user interface requesting user needs; (b) Calculated 
accessible route. 
Such accessibility features must match the special needs 
as shown in the prototype app. An example of an 
accessible route (for people with special mobility needs) 
is also shown in Figure 4b. 
We have to underline that the app is just a prototype. A 
prototype because it does not include: (1) an accessible 
user interface; (2) downloading live updates or incident 
locations in the Metro Madrid network; (3) uploading 
updates or incidents identified by the user of the app. 
The purpose of this prototype is to generate subway 
routes from the Metro Madrid data according to the 
specific user’s needs; in this way, it includes: (a) a user 
interface in which a user can select his/her user’s needs 
(only those that the Metro Madrid data can support); (b) 
the generation of accessible subway routes from the 
origin to a destination according to the user’s needs. 
With regard to the validation of the app, we have tested 
that the generated routes are effectively correct (verified 
in real-life), that is, that the routes can be used by people 
with specific disabilities identified in the user’s needs. 
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
One of the major goals of smart cities is to achieve an 
inclusive society through the use of technologies. In this 
context, one important challenge is to facilitate the mobility 
of all citizens. If this challenge is to be met, information 
regarding means of transport and their accessibility features 
is, therefore, required in order to be able to provide 
accessible routes for every user, including special needs 
users. 
As shown in this paper, these accessibility data are not 
easy to find and cannot be processed owing to the diversity 
of sources and formats. We have presented a study of the 
state of accessibility data in several European cities and 
70

shown that GTFS does not provide the constructions 
required to represent accessibility data. In order to resolve 
this issue, we have proposed a systematic process with 
which to gather the information, unify the formats and 
semantically annotate it: the first step is carried out by 
means of a scrapper; in the second and the third steps, we 
represent the data in RDF so as to unify and annotate the 
data for their further use in applications that help citizens 
move in a city. 
As future work, we intend to improve the systematic 
process defined in this work in order to provide fully open 
datasets of different public transport networks. Moreover, 
these datasets must be published in an open platform that 
will permit free access to accessibility and special needs 
data. The process will take into account the accessible 
routes generated using crowdsourcing techniques. These 
routes will be generated by users with special needs. We 
have to developed different apps for these kinds of users 
with the aim of capturing the geographical information and 
the accessibility characteristics of these routes. This 
information will be incorporated as smart data into the 
Multiply@City platform (see Figure 1). Moreover, the apps 
still have to be validated and will be developed following 
the existing standards and initiatives of accessible user 
interfaces. The same directives have to be applied to the 
protoype app presented in this paper.
