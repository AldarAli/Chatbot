Abstract—The extended research presented in this paper focusses
on advanced context creation as practicable in knowledge based
disciplines. This extended research presents methods for multi-
dimensional context creation based on the new methodology of
Knowledge Mapping. The methodology of Knowledge Mapping
allows the knowledge based mapping of objects and entities
for purpose of context creation. The mapping to new context
can improve complex knowledge mining, discovery, and decision
making results. The new context increases the potential for
creating new insights. The paper presents implemented methods
and case studies along with an extended introduction of the
new methodology used with advanced knowledge mining and
provides the latest results of the present research. The different
methodology based knowledge mining method implementations
deploy various spatial representations for illustration. All method
implementations utilise commonly available unstructured data
and create new multi-disciplinary knowledge context. Resulting
entities are spatially mapped. The results can be used for
further analysis in integration with data and advanced tools,
e.g., automated and visual analysis. The methodology can employ
integrated knowledge resources and services for mapping support
and can be applied to any content from arbitrary disciplines. The
results of the mapping to new context can be used for knowledge
mining workﬂows, for gaining new insight, and for creating
and further improving long-term knowledge resources. The
methodology also supports automated learning processes. This
extended research aims on illustrating the ﬂexibility of possible
methods for new practical mining procedures and algorithms
from the knowledge perspective.

INTRODUCTION
Knowledge Mining is a goal, which is required for a large
number of application scenarios but which is nevertheless in
practice widely based on plain methods of data mining.
This extended research is based on the new Methodology
of Knowledge Mapping, which was presented at the GEOPro-
cessing 2018 conference in Rome, Italy [1]. The paper goes
beyond plain methods and the limited view of ‘data’.
The research presented here illuminates the superordinate
knowledge view [2] and is therefore not restricted to a
simple data view and focusses on advanced context creation
for arbitrary knowledge. This paper presents context-methods
for multi-dimensional context creation based on the new
methodology of Knowledge Mapping. The methodology of
Knowledge Mapping allows the knowledge based mapping
of arbitrary objects and entities for purpose of context cre-
ation. The mapping to new context can improve complex
knowledge mining, discovery, and decision making results.
The new, multi-dimensional context increases the potential for
creating new insights. In terms of knowledge, context creation
is a multi-disciplinary effort however limited and strict the
discipline focus is deﬁned.
The implemented context-methods and case studies along
with of the illustrated case studies based on the new method-
ology are used with based on advanced knowledge mining and
provide the latest results of the present research. The different
methodology based knowledge mining method implementa-
tions deploy various spatial representations.
All the context-method implementations utilise commonly
available unstructured data and create new multi-disciplinary
knowledge context. Resulting entities are spatially mapped.
The results can be used for further analysis in integration with
data and advanced tools, e.g., automated and visual analysis.
The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Sections II
and III introduce to the state of the art from previous work,
fundaments and motivation. Section IV introduces the new
methodology of knowledge mapping. Section V discusses
fundaments, components, and used resources. Section VI
presents the principles of multi-dimensional context creation
based on knowledge mapping. Section VII illustrates imple-
mented methods, generated for interactive dynamical context
examples. Sections VIII and IX discuss the multi-dimensional
features of methodology and implementation and summarise
the lessons learned, conclusions, and future work.
II.
STATE OF THE ART OF PREVIOUS WORK
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that any knowledge,
e.g., based on unstructured and structured data, can contain
parts, which may refer to other knowledge but which are
not explicitely linked. Further, existing methods promising
to deal with lexical and term mapping or ontologies showed
deﬁcient and inadequate for coping with challenges of arbitrary
knowledge mapping and multi-dimensional context. Methods
[3] and implementations for automated mapping [4] are not
sufﬁcient, the more as approaches do not span disciplines [5].
Term identiﬁcation [6] is not suitable for mapping beyond
simple context like bibliographic data, too. Available mapping

approaches are very limited to non-general knowledge related
tasks [7], even when dealing with context [8].
Regarding managerial aspects, modern knowledge organisa-
tion systems [9] can support the processes [10], nevertheless,
they are just components — besides knowledge. If system
components are not specialised on knowledge itself but more
or less on functional processes, e.g., tool components for
collaboration [11], collaborative knowledge [12], and ‘knowl-
edge based collaboration’ [13]. An approach with historical
data from many multi-disciplinary sources is the Venice Time
Machine (VTM) [14] project. However, there is no general
methodological approach associated with the project.
The essential fundament for knowledge mapping is the
knowledge. The methodology employed here was developed
in order to create methods for the identiﬁcation of entities
inside of or referenced with data and create new context for
knowledge objects and entities. Besides the context relevant for
this research, further basic terms and deﬁnitions are explained
in the referenced publications, e.g., for data entities, mapping,
and computing [15] as well as for entities and references [16].
The principle of this approach is superior to data and
information based approaches as the methodology takes beneﬁt
of knowledge complements [17]. Knowledge is an excellent
integrator as it can complement, e.g., from [18]
•
factual,
•
conceptual,
•
procedural,
•
and metacognitive knowledge.
Data and information can be associated with all the comple-
ments. In consequence, this methodology allows to deploy a
knowledge based level, e.g., creating knowledge mining where
information can result from information peeling processes [17].
Knowledge mapping is the process of creating mappings
between two data objects. In that way knowledge mapping
contributes signiﬁcantly to data integration and data sciences
methods [19]. The means of referring objects and sub-objects,
“entities”, with a new context is considered as “knowledge
mapping”. Objects, e.g., a document, a part of a text, or an
image may be associated with other objects, by its knowledge,
e.g., its factual or conceptual knowledge. For example, creating
new spatial context for textual entities in knowledge objects
requires to build non-ﬁxed associations, apply a fuzzy spatial
locate, and implement a text location to map-mapping. The
procedure enables to automatically create a spatial mapping
for possible locations in a document, e.g., Points Of Interest
(POI) or other places in a data set or ﬁle.
III.
FUNDAMENTS AND MOTIVATION
The fundaments of terminology and understanding knowl-
edge are layed out by Aristotle [20], being an essential part of
‘Ethics’ [21], which makes Aristotle probably most the primar-
ily relevant knowledge reference. Information science can very
much beneﬁt from Aristotle’s fundaments and a knowledge-
centric approach [18] but information science needs to go
beyond the available technology-based approaches for build-
ing holistic and sustainable solutions, supporting a modern
deﬁnition of knowledge [22]. Triggered by the results of a
systems cases study, it is obvious that superordinate systematic
principles are still widely missing. Making a distinction and
creating interfaces between methods and the implementation
applications [23], the results of this research are illustrated
here along with the practical example of the Knowledge
Mapping methodology [1] enabling the creation of new object
and entity context environments, e.g., implementing methods
for knowledge mining context. This motivating background
allows to build methods for knowledge mapping on a general
methodological fundament.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Devel-
opment (OECD) has published principles and guidelines for
access to research data from public funding [24]. The princi-
ples and guidelines are meant to apply to research data that
are gathered using public funds for the purposes of producing
publicly accessible knowledge. Anyhow, from the knowledge
management point of view they have much wider importance
as they
•
address the protection of intellectual property,
•
deal with knowledge generated from the re-use of exist-
ing data, and
•
describe important aspects when establishing evaluation
criteria.
The guidelines recommend the following items should be
considered in establishing evaluation criteria:
•
Overall public investments in the production and man-
agement of research data.
•
Management performance of data collection and archival
agencies.
•
Extent of re-use of existing data sets.
•
Knowledge generated from the re-use of existing data.
•
The use of targeted foresight exercises to determine the
nature and scope of data preservation activities and the
types of data most likely to be needed in the future.
The means to achieve such recommendations even for complex
scenarios is to use the principles of Superordinate Knowledge,
which integrate arbitrary knowledge over theory and practice.
Core assembly elements of Superordinate Knowledge [2] are:
•
Methodology.
•
Implementation.
•
Realisation.
Separation and integration of assemblies have proven beneﬁcial
for building solutions with different disciplines, different levels
of expertise.
IV.
METHODOLOGY OF KNOWLEDGE MAPPING
The methodology can be used for creating new object
and entity context environments, e.g., in knowledge mining
context. The following steps describe the methodology.
1)
Start is an arbitrary object.
2)
Object / entity analysis.
3)
Object / entity mapping.
4)
Context creation.
5)
Result is an object and / or entity with a new context
environment.

Objects can be arbitrary objects, unstructured or structured,
unreferenced or referenced, e.g., containing different entities
of content. The methodology is not limited to any possibly
restricted implementation or platform. In case of textual objects
and entities, the object can, e.g., be a text document. In
case the mapping targets on geo-referencing otherwise non
geo-referenced objects or entities, then the mapping can be
considered a spatial mapping. With the latter target the context
creation can be considered a spatial visualisation.
The methodology of knowledge mapping for arbitrary ob-
jects and entities can be schematically summarised (Figure 1).
For example (Figure 2): When the object is a plain text-
object and creating spatial visual context is the target, then
the steps can be implemented with object and entity analysis,
spatial object / entity mapping, and spatial visualisation for
creating an object / entity spatial mapping in a new context.
The targets for the case study are spatial visualisation and
context. The implementation architecture of mapping arbitrary
objects and entities to a new object context environment
is shown in Figure 3. Data and modules are provided by
Knowledge Resources. The originary resources deliver the data
objects and entities, which can be unstructured or structured.
The application resources and components contain appropriate
modules for the required steps:
•
The object is retrieved,
•
possible object entities are extracted,
•
object data resources are being analysed,
•
objects are being compared,
•
a conceptual mapping is performed on objects,
•
spatial mapping is performed on objects,
•
appropriate spatial media is generated,
•
including media formats and colourisation, and
•
a spatial visualisation is performed.
•
The result is an object / entity instance in a new context
environment.
The modules and ﬁlters perform the analysis and handle the
objects and entities, e.g.,
•
entities in different context inside an object,
•
transcriptions, transliterations, translations,
•
abbreviations, acronyms, . . .
In many cases, additional handling of data will be desired, even
if not essential for the procedure of a method or the operation
of a service. For example, in case of textual objects and entities
a number of aspects exist, which contribute to the attainment
of a certain quality:
•
Differently organised or structured entities per object.
•
Sub-entities, multiple entities in a pseudo-entity.
•
Inconsistencies in data.
•
Errors in data.
•
Typographic differences.
•
Ambiguous or plurivalent entities.
•
Multi-lingual entities.
•
Different diction.
•
Different syntax.
•
Different element ordering in entities.
•
Different structures.
•
Time dependencies of aspects, mapping, and meaning.

Different character sets.
•

Any of these and comparable aspects are handled by the
modules and appropriate pre- and post-ﬁlters. With the case
study, for the above aspects respective research was conducted
gathering various data and developing suitable methods over
several years, data which can be deployed to create ﬁlters,
which were used for holding the results presented here.
It is required to abstract certain information in many appli-
cation scenarios, e.g., for generalisation or privacy. Besides any
kind of ﬁlter, the method also allows to implement fuzziness
in a ﬂexible and wide range of ways. For example, on the
one hand a precise location can be reduced to city, region, or
country. Comparable but different locations can be uniﬁed to
one different location representing a larger area. On the other
hand, location coordinates can be automatically or manually
reduced in precision and/or equipped with an offset. With these
means, workﬂows can deliver kind of “Fuzzy Context”, e.g., a
fuzzy location, providing a precision level of a public region
instead of showing a certain building in a result.

oped by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research
(UCAR/Unidata), [33], National Center for Atmospheric Re-
search (NCAR) [34] is used for spatial context data. NetCDF
is an array based data structure for storing multi-dimensional
data. A NetCDF ﬁle is written with an ASCII header and stores
the data in a binary format, e.g., with a mapping suite.
The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) [35] suite application
components are used for handling the spatial data, applying
the related criteria, and for the visualisation.
The visualisation ﬁles generated from the mapping results
are using the Keyhole Markup Language (KML), an eXtended
Markup Language (XML) based format for specifying spatial
data and content. KML is considered an ofﬁcial standard of
the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The KML description
can be used with many spatial components and purposes, e.g.,
with a Google Earth or Google Maps presentation [36], with a
Marble representation [37], using OpenStreetMap (OSM) [38]
and national data, e.g., [39].
Modules are employing Perl Compatible Regular Expres-
sions (PCRE) for specifying common string patterns and Perl
[40] for component wrapping purposes with this case study.
VI.
MULTI-DIMENSIONAL CONTEXT CREATION
The following sections provide information regarding im-
plemented components (lxloccoord, module for location
coordinates) and a practical case study, which was done
for demonstrating the methodology of mapping objects and
entities, creating new context environments. The case study
shows components, which were built for mapping scenarios
creating spatial context (Figure 3) and illustrates new insights
and relevance for knowledge creation and advanced mining.
A. The components
All the components and modules required for the architec-
ture (Figure 3) were implemented. The following components
were created for the practical implementation of the three
major central modules, object / entity analysis, mapping, and
context creation, demonstrating all steps of the methodology.
•
The object / entity analysis modules process objects for
entities, which can be fed into a mapping mechanism.
•
The pre-ﬁlters change, mark, and remove entities before
the mapping modules try to create entity mappings.
•
The mapping modules do have the task to deliver spatial
coordinates for appropriate entities.
•
The post-ﬁlters change, mark or remove entities after the
resolver worked on entities for a spatial mapping.
•
The context creation modules deliver the geo-referencing
for a spatial application.
The modules can be centralised or distributed, e.g., imple-
mented as a local directory of comparable and resolved entities
or an online service. Appropriate directories can be provided
by knowledge resources as well as by spatial mapping services.
Change processes in pre- and post-ﬁlters can include uniﬁ-
cation, improvements for resolvability, mapping and so on.
Different application components with different features can
be deployed for dynamical and interactive use and visualisa-
tion, e.g., GMT, Marble, and Google Maps.
B. Case study: From plain text to spatially linked context
The following passages show some major steps for creating
spatially linked context from plain text (Figure 4), which were
used in the workﬂows required for the case studies.

Figure 9. Media representation (KML) of geo-referenced object entities,
resulting from original mapping (excerpt).
A global view of all resulting entities automatically anal-
ysed and mapped from the single object [41] is shown in
Figure 10. The single-object-view integrates the new spatial
context of the object entities with a high precision topographic-
oceanographic thematic view. The bullets are very much over-
sized for this illustration.
The respective components are provided by GMT suite
applications, especially pscoast and gmtselect [17], which
allow a multitude of spatial operations and criteria in context
with the entities. Further, KML can be used with many spatial
applications, e.g., with Marble and Google Maps. Generators
can be conﬁgured to mark different types of locations with
different markers. It is also possible to automatically mark
locations with thumbnail photos being associated with the
respective location and so on.
With a general approach, on knowledge side, the universal
classiﬁcation can classify any location and context, the more,
it allows to integrate any multi-dimensional context with the
full conceptual knowledge. On application component side,
GMT provides many functional features, e.g., spatial math,
map material assembly, and any map projections.
Therefore, the integration of just two but very powerful com-
ponents like UDC and GMT, can provide a huge spectrum of
ﬂexibility and fuzzyness of expressing location and context. As
any documents, e.g., plain texts, Hypertext Markup Language
(HTML), and LATEX documents can be handled for afﬁliation
matching can base on fuzzy algorithms based on matching
knowledge (e.g., item libraries and classiﬁcation).
The knowledge resources and data sets are used for demon-
stration purposes only and, as far as shown here, are pub-
licly available. The used conceptual knowledge framework is
publicly available to the given extent. Further licenses can be
obtained, e.g., from the authors of UDC, for further and wider
use. Adopters are further free to create their own conceptual
knowledge framework to be used with the methodology. The
methodology and resulting method frameworks can then be
used accordingly.
When interactivity in the results is a desired target, then
components like Marble and Google Earth can provide dynam-
ical features in order to create special cognostic features, e.g.,
with focus of special details appearing in cognostic context.
The following implementations show case studies for dif-
ferent context and the resulting output, especially including
context of the necessary topography (longitude, latitude, eleva-
tion), data, and information used, after the result was visualised
via GMT. The examples show automatic spatial mappings
of potential POI locations generated for a simple single text

IMPLEMENTED METHODS: DYNAMICAL CONTEXT
Dynamical application components are focussing on targets,
which are dynamic. From this point of view, the components
themselves are not a matter of change. These components
and their contexts are dynamical as the targets are primarily
refering to dynamics, to something variable.
A. Creating context by knowledge mapping and context data
Context data can be any data, which show a reference with
the knowledge, with which the case is dealing with. This can

be visual context, e.g., concentrations on a thematic mapping,
for example with topographic, climatic or political mapping.
This can also be mathematical background, e.g., mathematical
algorithms being able to describe context and references, e.g.,
GMT math context or spatial tools context. In case of the above
example, such supportive context data can, e.g., be
•
climate data,
•
weather data,
•
political data,
•
historical data,
•
planetary data (eclipse, areas of visibility, . . .),
•
routing / navigation data.
Such context, e.g., data allows
•
spatial mapping and
•
spatial operations.
In consequence, sample facilities are
•
location context,
•
altitude,
•
sea / land / island / . . .,
•
temperature,
•
precipitation,
•
satellite data context,
•
location / POI context.
We can create context-methods for arbitrary knowledge
mapping and context strictly based on the Methodology of
Knowledge Mapping. The following implemented context-
methods directly refer to the above case study and the given
knowledge samples.
B. Political context
If the target is a context creation of possible political context
of object/entities then the steps are:
1)
Start: Unstructured object/entities (e.g., from text).
2)
Analysis of object/entities. Analysis of references, e.g.,
classiﬁcations, concordances, and associations.
3)
Knowledge Mapping for object/entities. Mapping ob-
ject/entities with available knowledge.
4)
Creation of politically referenced context (e.g., political
mapping). Referencing with supportive context data
(e.g., spatial political maps)
5)
Result: Object/entities mapped on a dynamical political
context map (e.g., Marble, political map).
Figure 11 is a screenshot of an dynamical, interactive view
(Marble), a political map context for above created context.

resulting entities of a single object: Political context for labeled entities.
A consecutive mapping allows to analyse the entities in com-
pletely new context. For example, parts of an unstructured doc-
ument can be put into context with any type of n-dimensional
information, e.g., historical and climatological context by using
spatial information [42] and mapping for ﬁnding links. In this

case, data entities can be spatially mapped and associated with
multi-dimensional data from many disciplines, and data entities
can not only be associated in space but also in time. The data
allows to do detailed knowledge mining analysis as well as
visual analysis.
The following method implementations create varying con-
texts and cognostic levels of detail in order to show a small
subset of knowledge dimensions for application with spatial
targets. Some of the features, e.g., interactive and dynamical
features, cannot be illustrated in the ﬁgures but will be dis-
cussed afterwards.
C. Climate context
If the target is a context creation of possible climate context
of object/entities then the steps are:
1)
Start: Unstructured object/entities (e.g., from text).
2)
Analysis of object/entities. Analysis of references, e.g.,
classiﬁcations, concordances, and associations.
3)
Knowledge Mapping for object/entities. Mapping ob-
ject/entities with available knowledge.
4)
Creation of climate referenced context (e.g., climato-
logical mapping). Referencing with supportive context
data (e.g., spatial climate maps)
5)
Result: Object/entities mapped on a dynamical climate
context map (e.g., Marble, climate map).
For the created context, Figure 12 shows a screenshot of an
interactive globe-view (Marble) with climate zone context.
Figure 12. New context for automatically created analysis and mapping of
resulting entities of a single object: Climate zones context in 3D.
D. Topographic context
If the target is a context creation of possible global topo-
graphic earth context of object/entities then the steps are:
1)
Start: Unstructured object/entities (e.g., from text).
2)
Analysis of object/entities. Analysis of references, e.g.,
classiﬁcations, concordances, and associations.
3)
Knowledge Mapping for object/entities. Mapping ob-
ject/entities with available knowledge.
4)
Creation of topographically referenced context (e.g.,
global topographical mapping). Referencing with sup-
portive context data (e.g., spatial earth topography
maps)
5)
Result: Object/entities mapped on a dynamical topo-
graphic context map (e.g., Google Earth, Earth view).
For the created context, Figure 13 shows a screenshot of an
interactive view (Google Earth) with Earth view context.
Figure 13. New context for automatically created analysis and mapping of
resulting entities of a single object: Google Earth context, labeled entities.
Besides the new context of spatial distribution and according
algorithms and math, the new context environments build links
in order to associate entities with knowledge from arbitrary
disciplines and proceed with further analysis.
Due to conceptual attributes of knowledge mapping and
spatial algorithms, the implementation allows high grades of
scalability and fuzziness. New context can also be kept and
used in learning systems components. This, e.g., can provide
conditional object / entity aggregation and time sequences.
E. Super zoom object context
If the target is a context creation of possible super zoom
context of object/entities, including context POI and local
objects, then the steps are:
1)
Start: Unstructured object/entities (e.g., from text).
2)
Analysis of object/entities. Analysis of references, e.g.,
classiﬁcations, concordances, and associations.
3)
Knowledge Mapping for object/entities. Mapping ob-
ject/entities with available knowledge.
4)
Creation of referenced context (e.g., topographical map-
ping, integration of POI). Referencing with supportive
context data (e.g., topic maps)
5)
Result: Object/entities mapped on a dynamical, zoom-
able POI context map (e.g., Google Earth).
For the created context, Figure 14 shows a screenshot of an
interactive context zoom (Google Earth) of a single entity.

Figure 14. New context for automatically created analysis and mapping of
resulting entities of a single object: Google Earth context, super zoom.
This way, any knowledge mapped entity can be made auto-
matically available in its new context. Context can be statical
and dynamical as well as it can consist of combinations.
Many consecutive analysis can be performed as a plethora of
algorithms is available to deal with spatial data. Examples are
Points of Interest in a certain area or distances to other objects.
F. Public transport context
Figure 15 shows a screenshot of an interactive context
view (Marble) of the public transport. The target leading to
this application component is the context creation of possible
public transport context of object/entities.
Figure 15. New context for automatically created analysis and mapping of
resulting entities of a single object: Public transport.
For this target of context creation of possible public transport
context of object/entities the steps are:
1)
Start: Unstructured object/entities (e.g., from text).
2)
Analysis of object/entities. Analysis of references, e.g.,
classiﬁcations, concordances, and associations.
3)
Knowledge Mapping for object/entities. Mapping ob-
ject/entities with available knowledge.
4)
Creation of transport referenced context (e.g., public
transport mapping). Referencing with supportive con-
text data (e.g., spatial road/rail maps)
5)
Result: Object/entities mapped on a dynamical transport
context map (e.g., Marble).
Questions can be addressed, for example, if there is a
correlation between entities referred in an object and the
available public transport facilities.
G. Street map context
If the target is a context creation of possible street map
context of object/entities then the steps are:
1)
Start: Unstructured object/entities (e.g., from text).
2)
Analysis of object/entities. Analysis of references, e.g.,
classiﬁcations, concordances, and associations.
3)
Knowledge Mapping for object/entities. Mapping ob-
ject/entities with available knowledge.
4)
Creation of transport referenced context (e.g., street
mapping). Referencing with supportive context data
(e.g., spatial road/rail maps)
5)
Result: Object/entities mapped on a dynamical street
context map (e.g., Marble, OSM).
For the created context, Figure 16 shows a screenshot of an
interactive context view (Marble, OSM) for Open Street Map.

resulting entities of a single object: Open Street Map.
Analysis addressed with navigational context can provide in-
formation on relations between entities and their infrastructure
based environments.
VIII.
DISCUSSION OF MULTI-DIMENSIONAL CONTEXT
FEATURES OF METHODOLOGY AND IMPLEMENTATIONS
A. Integration of Context
As the same objects/entities can be brought into different
context views, an integration of contexts can deliver new
knowledge and insight.

295
International Journal on Advances in Software, vol 11 no 3 & 4, year 2018, http://www.iariajournals.org/software/
2018, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
In the above cases, contexts have been created for the entities
of a single object, using various dimensions, especially spa-
tial knowledge, time, and other associated knowledge. These
contexts, e.g., global distribution, climate, state afﬁliation,
topography, trafﬁc, and navigation in near environment and
so on can reveal different insights regarding different object
entities.
Even with practical implementations based on publicly
available universal conceptual knowledge it is nevertheless
only possible to demonstrate a very small range of scenarios
of multi-dimensional knowledge context.
Using different spatial framework components, like GMT
and Marble, we illustrated some features and what these
features can provide for text objects and entities. The method-
ology allows an overlay and integration of knowledge dimen-
sions. The methods can integrate important data, e.g., raster
and vector data, basic spatial object types (esp., points, lines,
polygons), and other non spatial data. The implementations
allow various types of calculation, e.g., object distance rela-
tions and geo-statistics. The methods of analysis range from
automated analysis to visual analysis.
A solution integrating GMT can provide practical access to
spatial and non-spatial knowledge dimensions, for example:
•
Categories of arbitrary land data,
•
elevation data, height and depth,
•
colourisation of data,
•
shading of data,
•
borders, political boundaries,
•
coastlines,
•
water bodies, lakes, permanent rivers, categories of in-
termittent rivers, categories of canals,
•
POI (e.g., cities, sites, locations), and
•
context labels.
The individual data can be composed from different sources,
different time intervals. Therefore it is possible to compose
context from an inﬁnite number of possible combinations.
A solution integrating Marble/KML can provide practical
access to spatial and non-spatial knowledge dimensions, for
example:
•
Categories of arbitrary topic data,
•
dynamical changes (e.g., trafﬁc, public transport, POI),
•
interactive features,
•
environmental and disaster analysis,
•
ﬂy-over perspectives,
•
time zones,
•
lighting (e.g., dawn/dusk areas, daylight/night).
Besides referencing in various dimensions, as illustrated,
the methodology allows to create methods for generating time
series and animation sequences as well as to handle scala-
bility targets and learning system components. The following
features were implemented with the above scenarios.
B. Time series and animation context
All the implementations of methods creating dynamical and
statical context, which are based on knowledge mapping –like
the above– include features to further create knowledge and
knowledge-based implementations on top.
On the one hand, for example, the knowledge and implemen-
tations allow to aggregate knowledge, e.g., for creating time
series of data. Aggregated knowledge can be used to create
secondary and consecutive knowledge and to build and choose
appropriate secondary data and applications, e.g., generating
KML data and applying it with appropriate application com-
ponents. The above examples allow animations, e.g., FlyTo
views (ﬂy to a certain point of interest) and Tour views (ﬂy to
a sequence of points on interests).
On the other hand, the context can be variable over time.
This may, for example, be resulting from historical background
data like historical satellite data or by integrating real time data.
To this account, aggregated knowledge is a discrete value.
For many scenarios, aggregated knowledge otherwise cannot
be recreated by other means or at other times. For example,
in the above scenario, it is a common case that afﬁliations
are existing for a certain interval in time. Institutions and
organisations get founded, and can get renamed, relocated or
terminated.
The knowledge to create references is therefore only avail-
able in certain time intervals and will change. If creating
the same mapping, for example, ten years later may show
that references are then missing or having been changed.
Aggregating and persistently keeping the knowledge at a time
can therefore preserve knowledge, which cannot be created at
other times later.
C. Object-entity aggregation
The above object scenario illustrates the multi-dimensional
context of one object. The methods can handle arbitrary
knowledge objects in any context, e.g., refer to multiple objects
and entities in one view, e.g., object instances over an interval
of years or different objects within one year, as well as different
object instances over an interval of years.
Any precomputed or intermediate result that might be in-
teresting for reuse, either from knowledge or from imple-
mentation point of view. There is no general implementation
for arbitrary long-term knowledge objects, which means the
organisation and management may have to include database
components as well as distributed access and interfaces.
Holistic views should also take into consideration that it can
be reasonable to also gather and aggregate supportive context
data, like old map data, historical POI descriptions and so on.
D. Learning system components
Creating learning system components is just one possible
subset within the range of the methodology.
Implementation components and realisations can make use
of learning system components for arbitrary scenarios. Learn-
ing system components can provide modules in scenarios like
the above and reuse knowledge as well as contribute to new
knowledge and insight, which allow to collect knowledge
developing in terms of time, application, and context.
As an example, learning system components can be built to
use aggregated knowledge over long periods of time in order
to extend dimensions in knowledge, e.g., in space and time.

296
International Journal on Advances in Software, vol 11 no 3 & 4, year 2018, http://www.iariajournals.org/software/
2018, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
Entities in objects may require older context, which cannot
created from present objects, independent of the date of the
object. For example, the context of entities in online data does
not need to correspond with the date of the hosting ﬁle. Lost
or missed context may not be possible to be recreated from
present data. Long-term application and archiving learning
components’ results can therefore contribute to a signiﬁcant
quality improvement in many application cases.
E. Checkpointing and knowledge gathering
The methodology allows to create methods, which save
checkpointing information for the mapping process.
It can also be reasonable to save resolved references and
geolocations persistently because of changes over time, which
may not be resolvable later.
When implementing and realising methods, these consider-
ations should be considered with the creation of the modules.
Checkpointing can make use of the mechanisms of knowl-
edge gathering from knowledge as well as from implemen-
tation point of view, e.g., collecting time dependent data,
data aggregation, and inter module checkpointing data during
workﬂows.
F. Compute resources outline
Depending on the details of resources and scenarios, the
computational characteristics can vary. For the case studies
some typical numbers are shown in Table IV.
TABLE IV. CASE STUDY COMPUTE AND MAPPING OUTLINE (LX).
Count
Number of
≈10,000,000
Objects addressed in Knowledge Resources
≈100
Corrective patterns for a single entity
≈100
Entities per object
≈100

≈10,000,000
Comparisons
— 100×100×....
Calculations
As with the implemented methods in the demonstrated case
studies it is not uncommon to have millions of comparisons per
object and consecutive large numbers of calculations and oper-
ations. Multi-dimensional contexts can be much more complex
than simple computational frameworks without a knowledge-
centric focus. Therefore, a certain computational framework
or solution, e.g., parallelisation and linear behaviour related
characteristics, can only ﬁt a context to a certain extent.
G. Scalability
The scalability of solutions is most important for any
assemblies, the more as the implementations of any methods,
which are handling complex context very much correlate with
the complexity involved. Due die the complex conditions nd
dependencies of knowledge, knowledge mapping methods rely
very much on the data delivered by knowledge resources. In
many cases this is increasingly signiﬁcant for realisations after
an implementation. Realisations mean, for example, building
services based on implementations. In the above case study
implementations can handle locations in many ways. Common
targets for realisations may be
•
precise locations,
•
fuzzy locations,
•
location precision restricted by criteria, . . .
The precision is depending on the associated knowledge and
supportive knowledge but also on the intended realisation. The
differences of knowledge involved and the consequences on
algorithmic and computational efforts may be remarkable.
Within each method, it is possible to take advantage of
modifying the contributing factors of scalability when methods
are implemented and realised.
IX.
CONCLUSION
This paper introduces to multi-dimensional context creation
based on the new methodology of Knowledge Mapping and
presents the results of the present research. The methodology
provides knowledge based mapping of arbitrary objects and en-
tities and creating new multi-dimensional context. The research
presented a number of successfully implemented methods, the
fundaments of the theoretical background of the methodology,
and the results of the implementation case studies. Analysis
and case studies implemented advanced context generation,
e.g., with spatial visualisation, 2D, 3D, route mapping, public
transport, the prerequisites of context related animation and ﬂy-
over tours as well as analysing computational requirements,
which are widely scalable, depending on implementation of
components and computing architectures.
The methodology fulﬁlls the goals of successfully creat-
ing new multi-dimensional context. The Knowledge Mapping
methodology can improve complex knowledge mining and
associated tasks as well as it can be beneﬁcial for the develop-
ment of knowledge resources. Practical case studies, evaluated
by groups of independent researchers, showed that applying
the methodology can create relevant new context for entities
in commonly available unstructured data. Regarding the case
studies, mapping to spatial context is just one of an arbitrary
number of possible mappings, which can be created with the
methodology.
The quality of results can signiﬁcantly beneﬁt from a
training and learning phase, depending on context. Here, with
resolving nearly all possible place entities with the used new
resources, the creation and learning phase of the modules
accumulates to several years. The methodology allowed to
implement a data-centric checkpointing with the methods. The
checkpointing corresponds to associated learning processes.
As shown, in most cases it may be advisable for ﬂexibility to
create modular architectures of components instead of mono-
lithic applications. It can further be convenient to consider
robustness and reliability of service modules, depending on
the architecture of an overall implementation. One means of
dealing with infrastructure can be a failure correction, e.g.,
multiple task runs and check modules.
Future work will concentrate on further developing and
improving the mapping modules and features for closer inte-
gration with and fostering an even wider range of application
of multi-disciplinary knowledge resources.
