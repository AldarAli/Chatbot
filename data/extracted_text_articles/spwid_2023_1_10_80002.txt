Abstract— Dioxygen and carbon dioxide arterial partial 
pressures are important clinical parameters that enable to 
assess the respiratory status of a patient. That is why they are 
continuously monitored in intensive care units, where large and 
expensive bedside devices are used. To grant access to 
continuous monitoring of these parameters to a larger portion 
of patients, smaller and noninvasive medical devices were 
developed to measure transcutaneous dioxygen and carbon 
dioxide concentrations. They accurately estimate the partial 
pressures of those gases based on measurements made at the 
level of the skin. These devices are validated through clinical 
trials, which require long and expensive procedures. Developing 
advanced test benches mimicking human physiology is an 
interesting alternative to mature medical devices before 
submitting them to clinical trials. This work presents, to the best 
of our knowledge, a first-of-its-kind test bench prototype that 
mimics blood and skin for testing transcutaneous carbon 
dioxide monitoring medical devices. We also propose a proof-of-
concept method to monitor dissolved carbon dioxide using 
common chemistry laboratory sensors. A similar test bench for 
transcutaneous dioxygen is currently under development. 
Keywords- test bench; transcutaneous gas monitoring; carbon 
dioxide partial pressure. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Blood gas analysis enables to detect and interpret 
respiratory, circulatory and metabolic disorders [1]. It is a 
common diagnostic tool for critically ill patients in intensive 
care departments. The reference method to analyze blood 
gases requires arterial sampling, an invasive and painful 
method. 
As 
an 
alternative, 
medical 
devices 
for 
transcutaneous gas monitoring were conceived in a 
noninvasive approach [2][3]. Developing and validating such 
devices require clinical trials, at the cost of a long and 
expensive procedure. An interesting option is to develop 
these devices using test benches that mimic human 
physiology up to a certain level of maturity before validating 
them in clinical trials [3]. 
Such test benches would require generating a gaseous 
partial pressure starting from a liquid phase. Therefore, 
monitoring the concentration in the aqueous phase is 
necessary for an accurate test bench. The blood gases of 
interest are dioxygen O2 and carbon dioxide CO2 and this 
work focuses on the latter. The classical principle exploited 
by reference sensors for measuring dissolved CO2 
concentration is diffusion through a selective hydrophobic 
membrane to get CO2 molecules in a gaseous phase inside the 
sensor. The gas concentration is then measured using an 
optical method, typically based on infrared absorption. Such 
sensors suffer from a slow response due to the diffusion 
phenomenon in the sensor chamber, leading to a slow 
response time: a 10 min Tr99%  response in the case of 
AquaMS sensor [4], the cost of which is around 10 k€. 
PreSens [5] offers a quicker sensor, delivering results in a few 
seconds, with a principle based on optical quenching using 
selective photosensible spots directly in the solution, getting 
rid of the diffusion part, but for a higher price around 15k€.  
The work described in Section II aims to offer an 
alternative to these sensors by measuring dissolved carbon 
dioxide indirectly, using common chemistry laboratory 
devices. Section III presents a test bench prototype that 
mimics transcutaneous carbon dioxide at the level of the 
forearm. We conclude our work in Section IV.

A METHOD TO MEASURE DISSOLVED CARBON DIOXIDE 
IN A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT 
The controlled environment of interest is the liquid phase 
that is used to simulate blood in the test bench (see Section 
III). A physiological solution is a possible option. In this 
study, an aqueous solution of sodium chloride NaCl at 0.9% is 
used. It allows to monitor the pH and salinity of the liquid 
phase without any chemical reaction between chloride or 
sodium ions and the carbon dioxide CO2 or the ions resulting

from its dissolution in water. Therefore, the dissolution of CO2 
in an aqueous solution of NaCl follows the same steps as in 
water. 
A. Theory 
Carbon dioxide CO2, after dissolution in water, leads to 
the formation of carbonic acid H2CO3 , a weak acid that 
dissociates into bicarbonate ions HCO3
−  then to carbonate 
ions CO3
2− in cascade reactions [4][5] :

(3) 
Reaction 1 represents the CO2 hydration equation, and has a 
low equilibrium constant K0 ≈ 10−7 [6], which means that 
CO2,aq concentration exceeds greatly H2CO3 concentration. 
The concentration of all dissolved CO2 will be referred to as 
the concentration of CO2,aq and the thermodynamic 
equilibrium between a gaseous phase and the aqueous phase 
is described by Henry’s law:  
[CO2,aq] = 𝛼 PCO2 
(4) 
where [CO2,aq ] (mol L−1) is the concentration in the aqueous 
phase, 𝑃CO2(Pa) is the partial pressure in the gaseous phase 
and 𝛼 = 𝐾0 𝐾CO2,0 with 𝐾CO2,0 the molar solubility of carbon 
dioxide in the aqueous solution, which depends on pressure, 
temperature, salinity, ionic strength and dissolved organic 
matter [4][6]. This study is conducted at ambient pressure, 
and the variables are the temperature T (K) and salinity S 
(ppt). Therefore, the solubility is computed as follows [6]: 
ln  (𝐾CO2,0) = −58.09 +  90.05 (T0
𝑇 ) +  22.29 ln ( 𝑇
T0
) 
+𝑆 [−0.68 + 0.40 ( 𝑇
T0
) − 0.06 ( 𝑇
T0
)

] 
(5) 
with T0 = 100 K. The equilibrium constants K1 and K2 of 
reactions 2 and 3 are defined as follows: 
K1 =
[H+][HCO3
−]
[H2CO3] C0
 
(6) 
K2 =
[H+][CO3
2−]
[HCO3
−] C0
 
(7) 
where [X] represents the molar concentration of species X, 
and C0 = 1 mol L−1.  
The electrical conductivity of the solution is a necessary 
parameter for the computation. The Kohlrausch law applied 
to the studied system results in the following equation: 
σ = λHCO3−[HCO3
−] + 2λCO32−[CO3
2−]  + λH+[H+] 
+ λOH−[OH−] + λNa+[Na+] + λCl−[Cl−] 
(8) 
where σ (S m−1) is the electrical conductivity of the solution 
and λX (S m−1 mol−1 L) is the molar conductivity of ion 𝑋. 
The ionic product of water Kw is defined as follows [9]: 
Kw = 
[H+] [OH−]
C0²
 
(9) 
B. Method proposed to measure dissolved carbon dioxide 
The concentration of 𝐶𝑂2 can be computed by combining 
(6), (7), (8) and (9): 
[CO2,aq]= 
 
σ − λH+[H+] −   λOH− Kw
[H+] − λNa+[Na+] − λCl−[Cl−]
λHCO3
− K1
[H+]

[H+]²
 
(10) 
Equation (10) shows that measuring the pH and the 
conductivity allows to compute the concentration of 
dissolved CO2  in an aqueous solution of known NaCl 
concentration. The measurement of temperature is also 
necessary, as the constants used in (10) are temperature-
dependent thermodynamic parameters. The evolution of the 
equilibrium constants with respect to the temperature is the 
following: 
pK1 = T1
T + T
T2
− 14.84  
(11) 
where K1 = 10−pK1 , T1 = 3404.71 K  and T2 = 30.49 K   
[10]. 
pK2 = T3
T + T
T4
− 6.49  
(12) 
where K2 = 10−pK2  , T3 = 2902.39 K and T4 = 42.03 K  
[11]. 
ln (Kw) = 148.98 − T5
T −  23.6521 ln (100 T
T0
) 
(13) 
where T5 = 13847.26 K  and  T0 = 100 K  [9]. 
The evolution of the molar conductivity λX of the ions of 
interest with respect to the temperature was not found in the 
literature. Hence, it was extracted from the Nernst-Einstein 
equation [12]: 
λX = DX ZX F2
R T
 
(14) 
where DX (m² s−1) is the binary diffusion coefficient of ion 
X  in water and  ZX  its charge,  F (C mol−1)  the Faraday 
constant, R (J mol−1 K−1) the ideal gas constant, T (K) the 
temperature. 
To compute the molar conductivity at different 
temperatures, a Taylor expansion to the first order is applied 
to (14) around T6 = 298.15 K, the temperature at which the 
values of molar conductivity are given in the literature. DX is 
also a temperature-dependent thermodynamic parameter. 
However, it will be considered constant and its value is taken 
at T =T6: 
λX(T) = λX(T6) + DX ZX F2
R 
× (1
T − 1
T6
) 
(15) 
In conclusion, we show that injecting the measurements of 
pH, conductivity and temperature in (10) and (15) allows to 
compute the concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide.

III. 
TEST BENCH CONCEPTION 
The test bench aims to generate carbon dioxide to test a 
noninvasive transcutaneous CO2 gas sensor that is yet to be 
developed. The bench has the specifications of the 
measurement site, which is the forearm. The end goal is to 
generate the same carbon dioxide partial pressure PCO2 and 
flux ΦCO2. A liquid phase is used to simulate the blood and a 
membrane to simulate the skin, as shown in Figure 1. A liquid 
phase was chosen instead of a gaseous phase to mimic the 
kinetics of diffusion in the aqueous phase and through the 
membrane. Transcutaneous gas measurement devices can 
heat the skin up to 42 °C, hence the test bench parameters are 
determined at both 37 and 42 °C.  
A. Test bench conception 
PCO2  varies between 2.66 and 13.33 kPa (20 and 100 
mmHg)  [13]. At 42 °C, using (4) and (5), the corresponding 
[CO2,aq] ranges from 0.6 to 3 mmol L−1. In order to mimic 
the kinetics of carbon dioxide diffusion in blood, the bench 
has to generate a CO2 flux of  7.54 10−7 mol m−2 s−1 as it is 
the case at the level of the forearm [14]. To be able to do so, 
simulations at our lab show that the depth of the liquid in the 
tank (see Figure 2 right) has to be 3 and 12 mm for a 37 and 
42 °C temperature, respectively. 
The skin is represented by a polymer membrane that 
exhibits similar carbon dioxide diffusion properties as human 
skin at the level of the forearm. The selection was made on 
the basis of the permeability, defined by Krogh’s diffusion 
constant: 
Kr = k x
Pair
 
(16) 
where 𝐾𝑟 is the Krogh coefficient (m² s−1 Pa−1), 𝑘 the mass 
transfer coefficient ( m s−1 ), 𝑥  the thickness (m) of the 
membrane and 𝑃𝑎𝑖𝑟  the total air pressure (Pa) at the 
membrane temperature. A polydimethylsiloxane membrane 
(PDMS) of thickness 4.3 and 2.8 mm can mimic the skin [15] 
at 37 and 42 °C, respectively. 
B. Experimental setup and results 
To 
create 
a 
liquid 
phase 
with 
the 
mentioned 
concentrations, CO2  stock solutions Standard Hanna HI 
4005-01 at 0.1 mol L−1 and Reagecon SC026C at 6 g L−1 
were diluted in an Otec sodium chloride 0.9% sterile 
pyrogen-free solution. 
The test bench is a closed chamber designed using 
SolidWorks (Figure 2 right) and crafted in non-permeable 
materials to carbon dioxide. It includes a circulatory system 
composed of the inlet, the tank and the outlet in order to 
mimic blood circulation. On top of the liquid phase, sits the 
membrane that represents the skin and finally the connection 
with the carbon dioxide sensor. The test bench is maintained 
at 42 °C using a bain-marie, heated by a temperature-
regulated stirrer. The carbon dioxide generated by the test 
bench was measured using a SprintIR-WP20 gas sensor 
(Figure 2 left).  
Equation (10) requires the measurement of the pH, the 
conductivity and the temperature of the solution in order to 
compute its concentration in carbon dioxide. In this work, 
bench-top measuring instrument Orion™ Versa Star Pro™ 
VSTAR 52 was used. Using an extra conductivity module, 
this device allows to measure the salinity also. These 
measurements were made inside the glass reactor that 
supplies the bench test tank  through a peristaltic pump. 
The [ CO2,aq ] range has been explored through five 
measurement points: starting from a solution of 3 mmol L−1 
and diluting up to 0.6  mmol L−1 . The intermediary 
concentrations at which measurements were made are 1.2, 1.8 
and 2.4 mmol L−1 , they are referred to as measurement 
points. At each point, conductivity, pH and temperature were 
measured to compute CO2,aq concentration using (10). Each 
measurement was repeated five times to create five-fold 
measurement 
points 
and 
assess 
the 
stability 
and 
reproducibility of the experiment. Five minutes separated 
each dilution to allow the solution to reach equilibrium.  
Equation (10) shows a linear relationship between [CO2,aq] 
and conductivity, and between [CO2,aq] logarithm and pH. 
Therefore, three values of each five-fold measurement point 
were randomly chosen to create a linear regression learning 
batch. The resulting linear regression “Predicted value” was

plotted against the experimental values “Experimental value 
1” and “Experimental value 2”.  
Figure 3 shows that the experimental results validate the 
proposed method based on (10). It also proves the 
reproducibility of the experiments and the stability of the 
measurements. 
IV. 
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
The results obtained so far from of this ongoing work show 
that it is possible to compute [CO2,aq] from the measurement 
of pH and conductivity. This indirect measurement is also 
valid for the dynamic regime and not only at equilibrium as 
Figure 3 was obtained by consecutive dilutions. The devices 
used in this approach have a few seconds time response, 
allowing real-time monitoring of [CO2,aq] using the method 
proposed in Section II.B. The aim is to be able to control the 
partial pressure in the gaseous phase above the membrane by 
adjusting the concentration in the aqueous phase. A previous 
study worked on developing a model describing the 
relationship between these two physical quantities [16].
