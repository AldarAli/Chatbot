Abstract—Cambodia’s construction industry is overgrowing 
but faces challenges like cost overruns and delays. This study 
explores collaboration in construction projects involving 
project 
owners, 
designers, 
and 
contractors, 
including 
architecture, structure, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing 
disciplines. The semi-structured interviews were conducted 
with 16 participants, focusing on coordination, communication, 
and co-production. Two construction projects with and 
without Building Information Modeling (BIM) approaches 
were also observed. Our findings identified four workflow 
scenarios linked to different interaction actors’ categories. The 
study demonstrated that the degree and timing of collaboration 
among project owners, designers, and contractors were the 
primary factors influencing the workflow scenarios in the 
Cambodian construction sector. Most participants were 
unfamiliar with BIM and did not apply it to their projects. 
Traditional project delivery methods remained prevalent, even 
in large-scale projects. Participants lacked a common language 
regarding BIM, hindering effective collaboration. It became 
evident that there was a lack of willingness to align knowledge 
and practices to enhance project value. To promote BIM 
collaboration within Cambodia’s construction sector, we 
recommend the development of a centralized collaboration 
guideline tailored to architects, engineers, contractors, and 
project owners.

 INTRODUCTION 
This paper is an extension version of the COLLA 2023 
conference paper [1], which added a research question: 
“How can we facilitate and support Building Information 
Modeling (BIM) enabled collaboration in Cambodia’s 
construction sector?” To answer this, we extended 
experiments by observing two construction projects in 
Cambodia: one that BIM has not been used and one that BIM 
has been used. Moreover, we specifically explained our 
protocol.  
 
The construction industry is pivotal in driving 
Cambodia’s economic growth, contributing 9.1% to the 
country’s total Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2018 [2]. 
Over the past few decades, the number of foreign investors, 
including those from China, South Korea, Japan, Europe, 
and America, has increased [3]. These investments have 
primarily 
targeted 
infrastructure 
development 
and 
urbanization, resulting in a remarkable construction sector 
expansion over the last [4][5]. 
However, 
despite 
this 
significant 
growth, 
many 
construction projects in Cambodia have grappled with poor 
cost management and project schedule performance [6]. It’s 
worth noting that these challenges are not unique to 
Cambodia but are prevalent in contemporary construction 
projects worldwide [7]. The construction sector needs to 
improve its efficiency, which leads to decreased cost and 
improved project performance at various stages of the project 
life cycle. 
Previous research has underscored the critical role of 
collaboration in ensuring the success of construction projects 
[8]. Meanwhile, effectively managing collaboration among 
various specialized actors involved in construction project 
development remains challenging [7]. To address these 
issues and improve the project performance, it is imperative 
to ascertain the current state of the collaborative process 
within the sector.  
The three main parties driving construction development 
are the project owner, the designer, and the contractor, with a 
legal framework governing their interactions stated in the 
contract [9]. Architectural, civil, structural, mechanical, and 
electrical design are five essential disciplines in building 
design [10].

This study is geared towards the collaborative process 
among project owners, designers, and contractors, focusing 
on the architectural, structural, and MEP disciplines across 
various phases of the construction project life cycle. Within 
the context of Cambodia’s construction, this study aims to 
answer the following questions:  
• 
What 
characterizes 
the 
interaction 
among 
Cambodian construction project owners, designers, 
and contractors? 
• 
How do collaborative workflows and processes of 
these actors evolve throughout different phases of 
construction projects in Cambodia? 
• 
Is BIM perceived by industry professionals as an 
alternative to overcome poor cost and schedule 
performance in the future? 
• 
How can we facilitate and support BIM-enabled 
collaboration in Cambodia's construction sector? 
 
Interviews and observations have been conducted to 
answer these multifaced questions. This article is structured 
into six parts. First, we introduce the Cambodian context, 
problem statement, research questions, and an outline of the 
article’s content. The second section presents the specificity 
of the construction sector in Cambodia. The second section 
also delves into the existing literature, outlining the 
definitions and tools of collaboration, and the three 
components of collaborative work. The third section explains 
our data collection protocol, which encompasses semi-
structured interviews and observation case studies. The 
fourth section presents results, including insights into the 
relationship 
among 
project 
owners, 
designers, 
and 
contractors, the four workflow scenarios, the balance of 
collaboration, problem-solving, and BIM experiences and 
perspectives. The fifth section discusses the results. We 
finish this paper with the conclusion of our research findings 
and further work in the last section. 
II. 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
This section demonstrates the existing knowledge, i.e., 
the specifics of Cambodia's construction context, including 
the construction contract, the project lifecycle phases, and 
the importance of adopting BIM. Moreover, this section 
presents the definition and components of collaboration.  
A. Specificity of the construction sector in Cambodia 
Bellowing is the information specific to the construction 
in Cambodia. However, finding this information is 
challenging due to limited resources and research gaps 
within this field.  
 
1) Construction contract in Cambodia 
The interaction, roles, and responsibilities of the owner, 
the designer, and the contractor are typically stated in the 
contract [9].  According to the contract agreement, the 
owners should expect the result, payment, and oversee the 
progress of the work. The structure of a construction 
contract in Cambodia is as follows:  
Within the Cambodian context, the legal framework 
governing construction activities includes the adoption of a 
sub-decree on construction permits in 1997, as well as the 
Civil Code in 2007; and land law in 2001. However, it 
needs more explicit regulations of construction law and the 
establishment of a standardized construction contract. 
Without a locally standardized contract, Cambodian 
construction projects frequently turn to the International 
Federation of Consulting Engineers (FIDIC) standard, 
which was established by Belgium, France, and Switzerland 
[11]. 
 
FIDIC standards published in 1999 have four standard 
forms of contracts: 
• 
Conditions 
of 
Contract 
for 
Construction 
recommended (1) for the project designed by the 
owner or engineer. The contractor builds the building 
following the design provided by the owner [12].  
• 
Conditions of Contract for Plant and Design-build 
recommended (2) for “the provision of electrical 
and/or mechanical plants, and for the design and 
execution of building or engineering works” on a 
design/build basis. The contractor designs most or all 
the work [13].  
• 
Conditions of Contract for EPC/Turnkey projects 
recommended for “a process or power plant, a 
factory or similar facility, an infrastructure project, 
or other types of development [14].”  
 (i) a higher degree of certainty of final price and 
time is required. 
(ii) the contractor takes total responsibility for the 
design and execution of the project, with little 
involvement from the employer.  
• 
Short form of Contract (3) recommended for 
building or engineering works, which is a small 
value (less than US$500,000) or short-term work 
(less than six months) [15][16].  
In our study, we are interested in only the conditions of 
the contract for construction, conditions of the contract for 
plant and design-building, and the short form of the 
contract, which are recommended for building or 
engineering works. The definition of the contractual 
relationship between actors is the aim of these standards 
[17]. 
All contract standards have identified the tasks and 
responsibilities of three actors: employer (owner), engineer 
(designer), and contractor. We compare those contract 
standards based on the duties of actors, as shown in Table I. 
• 
Contractors in (1) and (3) design only for extent 
specification. Otherwise, they design almost all the 
projects in (2).  
• 
The requests for construction and environmental 
permits are the owners’ responsibility.  
• 
Providing 
instructions 
and 
requesting 
any 
requirement to the contractor is the owner's 
75

responsibility in (2) and (3). Otherwise, it is the 
designer's responsibility in (1). 
• 
There is the owner's representative who acts on 
behalf of the owners in (2) and (3)—otherwise, the 
designers who work on the owner's behalf in (1). On 
behalf of the owner, the owner's representative and 
designers have the authority to check, inspect the 
site, join decision-making, and make requests to the 
contractor on behalf of the owner. 
• 
The contractor also executes and completes the 
project. 
 
2) Construction project life cycle phase 
In Cambodia, there is not a standardized national 
framework for delineating the phases of construction life 
cycle. Instead, individual companies, institutions, and 
universities often adopt the standard from United States 
(US) or Europe as a reference. Based on the interviews 
conducted (which will be discussed in the following 
section), we indicated that construction projects in 
Cambodia are typically structured into eight phases: initial, 
conceptual design, schematic design, permitting, tender, 
BID, construction, and post-construction. Thus, this part, we 
will illustrate the difference in nomenclature and the 
structure of the primary phase of the construction project 
life cycle between US, Europe, and Cambodia (Table II).  
In traditional design-bid-build projects, the life cycle 
phases 
generally 
include 
project 
initiation, 
design, 
permitting, 
BID 
and 
award, 
construction, 
and 
commissioning and operation phase. In the initiation phase, 
they study the funding, environmental impact, and the 
potential of the project. The design phase is about 
conceptual design. Preliminary engineering is also a part of 
the design phase. It helps analyze and validate the project. 
From this phase, the owner can choose the option that meets 
their budget and requirements. Then, they detail the final 
design to request the permit. The detailed drawing and 
specifications are also submitted to the contractors' 
companies to bid. The selected contractor must complete the 
project as stated in the contract. The contractor must join in 
operation 
activities 
and 
commissioning 
when 
the 
construction phase is completed  [18]. 
 
Naming these phrases may differ between countries, but 
the principal remains the same. For example, in Belgium, 
the design and construction phase of the project is divided 
into eight main sub-phases: preliminary studies (PRE), 
summary pre-project (APS), detailed pre-project (APD), 
construction of urban planning permit (PDU), construction 
of the contractor consultation (DCE), suit, development of 
works contracts (MDT), work execution (EXE), suit, and 
additional assignments phase (MSU) [19].  
In the PRE phase, the owners gather information about 
their project and define the requirements, including the 
project's characteristics, budget, etc. All that information 
must be provided to the architect to study. Then, the 
architect sketches three proposals to the owner. In APS 
phase, they summarize and search for more information 
from the PRE phase and develop the selected sketch. They 
also study energy performance choice, technical security, 
ventilation, and acoustics. APD is the phase of coordination 
structure and technical design. They choose the material, 
ventilation, etc., and calculate the PEB. The PDU phase is 
the registration for the environment, construction permit, 
and Energy Performance of Building (PEB) certificate. The 
DCE phase is the phase of preparing documents for 
contracts. MDT is a phase of analysis, choosing the 
contractor company, and signing the contract. In EXE 
phase, the site works start and follow the plans in the 
agreement. There are regular meetings and report 
submissions in the phase. The MSU phase is the final step to 
be completed [19].

3) For construction 4.0 in Cambodia: towards Building 
Information Modeling, Models, Management (BIM) 
 
In the 21st century, industrials have a remarkable 
evolution with the advent of Industries 4.0, driven by digital 
technology. This transformation has had a profonde impact 
across various industrial sectors. In the construction

industry, often referred to as Construction 4.0, the goal is to 
promote the integration of advanced information and 
communication technologies into construction services. The 
aim is to enhance collaboration, productivity, and overall 
quality while minimizing project delays and costs. This 
approach also involve effectively managing complex 
construction projects their life cycle [20].

Moreover, Royal Government of Cambodia has issued 
the Rectangle Strategy-Phase IV for Growth, Employment, 
Equity, and Efficiency: Building the Foundation Toward 
Realizing the Cambodia Vision 2050. Within rectangle 2 
(Economic Diversification) and slide 3 (preparing for the 
digital economy and the Industrial 4.0 revolution) express 
the purpose of the government developing forward the 
Industrial 4.0 as stated below [21]:  
• 
“Developing 
and 
implementing 
a 
long-term 
strategic framework for digital economics.  
•

•

•

• 
Developing

and

ecosystem.” 
Towards the Construction 4.0, BIM is presented as the 
most appropriate solution to enable the change and as the 
potential tool/method for solving the problems in the 
architecture, engineering, and construction industry [22]. It 
profoundly impacts how project stakeholders collaborate 
and share information throughout a building’s lifecycle [23].  
 
Numerous sources define BIM. The National BIM 
Standard-United States defines Building Information 
Modeling as “a digital representation of physical and 
functional characteristics of a facility forming a reliable 
basis for decisions during its life-cycle; defined as an 
existing from earliest conception to demolition [24].” 
International standard (ISO 19650-1: 2018) defines BIM as 
the “use of a shared digital representation of a built asset to 
facilitate design, construction, and operation processes to 
form a reliable basis for decisions [25].” 
The letters “B” and “I” represent the civil construction or 
infrastructures (Building) and the information, respectively, 
which represents the real added value of this methodology 
in the context of 3D modeling. Otherwise, “M” has been 
given many definitions. BIM (modeling) is a process of 
creating models; BIM (models) is the model, which obtains 
the data and information for building; BIM (management) is 
the process of information management on the one hand and 
collaboration management on the other [26]. These three Ms 
complete the meaning of BIM and reflect the complexity of 
the resulting collaborative process and data sharing between 
the various actors and protagonists of the project throughout 
the life cycle of the building.  
 
Rezaei and Sistani [27] found that professionals in the 
construction sector are confidential with hand drawing and 
2D/3D CAD software, especially AutoCAD software. 
Otherwise, they lack BIM-based skills and knowledge 
[27][28], even as most companies in the United States and 
Europe actively promote BIM adoption.  
Meanwhile, there remains a lack of studies on the factor 
facilitating or hindering BIM adoption within Cambodia’s 
Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector. 
Previous study demonstrated that project visualization and 
schedule performance are the most significant drivers 
factors, while significant industry resistance to change 
remains a considerable challenge [29]. 
 In the broader Asian context, studies focusing the key 
barriers of BIM adoption, including those in China, 
Vietnam, and Malaysia, have highlighted the importance of 
BIM 
legal, 
regulation, 
and 
standards 
[30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38]. 
Additionally, 
the 
important BIM guideline encompass technology, return on 
investment, and implementation [31][37][39][40]. A study 
by Liu, 2022 presents the hierarchical structure and level 
partitioning of BIM adoption barriers for small and 
medium-sized fire protection enterprise in China [33]. This 
study highlights root barriers, including lack of external 
support from local government and a deficiency of BIM 
laws and regulations applicable to the fire protection 
industry. It also identifies a lack of client demand, and 
internal issues (i.e., training culture), software and 
technology-based barriers, insufficient knowledge and 
experience in applying BIM, and external guidance barriers 
such as pilot and standard. Remarkably, in China, the BIM 
adoption rate has surged from  5% in 2014 to 23.6% in 
2019, following the government’s promoted BIM policies in 
2015 [41]. This rate is expected to further rise if BIM 
77

becomes mandatory for national construction projects, 
increasing client demand. 
Many countries have conducted extensive research to 
customize guidelines or references for their national setting. 
As previously mentioned, fostering collaborative culture 
among project teams is vital for successful BIM 
implementation [28]. Therefore, imperative for us to gain a 
comprehensive understanding of the collaborative processes 
within Cambodia’s construction sector. This knowledge will 
enable us to better prepare for change, overcome significant 
inertia, and promote the adoption of Construction 4.0.  
 
B. “Collaboration”: Many defenition and tools 
 
Several definitions are given for Collaboration. Some 
speak of collective activity in general, and others propose 
differentiating them in terms of collaboration or cooperation. 
Both collaboration and cooperation are inter-organizational. 
Nevertheless, we refer to the definition of collaboration as 
the relationship with a common goal. In contrast, cooperation 
refers to “relationship among participants in a project, which 
does not commonly relate by vision or mission, resulting in 
separated project organization with independent structures, 
where the project culture is based on control and 
coordination to solve problems independently to maximize 
the value of the own organization [42].” 
In our case, we borrow the definition of Wood and Gray 
(1991), who describe collaboration as an interactive process 
of a group of actors that work together to make joint 
decision-making on a problem domain [43] by sharing their 
vision, 
information, 
and 
process 
via 
interacting, 
communicating, exchanging, coordinating, and approving in 
order to meet their common goal [44]. In the construction 
management domain, “collaboration” is defined as “a central 
element of success throughout the lifecycle of construction 
project [45][46].” Schöttle et al. [42] stated that the factors to 
reaching 
a 
successful 
collaboration 
are 
“trust, 
communication, commitment, knowledge, sharing, and 
information exchange [42].” Moreover, “the project-based 
nature of the Architect, Engineer, and construction industry 
requires collaboration, or at a minimum some form of 
negotiated interaction [47].”  
Table III shows the supported system variant of place and 
time which was originally presented by DeSanctis and 
Gallupe [48].

C. Three components of collaborative work 
We base ourselves on Ellis’s model [49], which is also 
used by many researchers [50][51] because it permits us to 
understand collaborative works through three components: 
“Coordination”, “Communication”, and “Co-production”. 
Coordination is how the work is structured [52]. The 
coordinative activities manage the task for actors to perform 
and the relationship between the actors to complete the tasks 
[53]. 
Communication is about exchanging information and 
sharing knowledge [54] to ensure that all actors get a 
common referential [46]. The information can be 
transmitted in different forms, e.g., verbal, written [54]. 
However, the development of technologies has supported 
communication, including “the electronic communication 
system (mail systems, facsimile transfer, voice and video 
conferencing) and shared workspace systems (virtual 
meeting rooms, remote screen sharing and electronically 
aided intelligent whiteboards (shared application) [54].”  
Co-production is the action related to creating or realizing 
the project design or building [53][55]. Those actions can be 
an action of a single actor or multi actors [55]. This concept 
also includes the decision-making of problem-solving.   
BIM capability supports all three components of 
collaboration. 
BIM 
actively 
facilities 
co-productive 
activities. For example, it enables actors to collaborate 
closely with other disciplinary actors. Model-based 
collaboration within BIM includes the interchange of 
models or part-models through both proprietary formats 
“(e.g., between Revit Architecture and Revit Structure 
through the .RVT file format) and non-proprietary formats 
(e.g., between ArchiCAD and Tekla using the IFC file 
format) [23].”  
Furthermore, 
BIM 
enhances 
coordination 
through 
software tools like Navisworks and BIM collab, etc.  These 
tools streamline the coordination of various project aspects. 
BIM also supports communication activities, both 
asynchronous and synchronous. Actors can leave the 
comments, highlight issues, and engage in discussions based 
on information shared through software platforms, i.e., BIM 
collab, etc., thus fostering effective communication among 
project stakeholders, regardless of geographical distance. 
 
Hence, the Cambodian construction context needs 
national common references, including standard contracts, a 
clear workflow of the project lifecycle, and BIM 
implantation guidelines.  Moreover, the research on these 
references needs to be improved; a few studies demonstrate 
the current construction situation.  Our research aims to fill 
this gap and significantly contribute to knowledge in this 
field.   
III. 
PROTOCOL 
This section provides how the study was successfully 
conducted through interviews and observations. The semi-
structured interviews process encompassed two steps 
78

approach. The first step involved interviewing employees to 
establish the relation of actor’s categories, while the second 
step aimed to validate the collaborative activities and 
workflow 
within 
each 
project 
phase. 
Additionally, 
observation of construction project/company in Cambodia 
were conducted to identify practical issues.  
 
A. Semi-structured interviewing 
We employed qualitative research via semi-structured 
interviews to gather participants' thoughts, feelings, and 
perspectives. This data allowed us to collect detailed 
problems in the participants’ practice. The framework for 
these interview were based on the Ellis’s model: 
coordination, communication, and co-production (Cf. II.C.) 
[49].  
We structured the semi-structured interviews around five 
themes: 
• 
Presentation project and company: participants 
described the projects they have been involved in 
and their company's role in those projects. 
• 
Coordination: participants answered questions 
about their roles and responsibilities in the project. 
We defined the participants' tasks (individual and 
overlapping tasks) and participants' roles. They 
mentioned how the work was structured and their 
interactions with other actors to complete the tasks.  
• 
Communication: 
participants 
explained 
the 
communication methods and tools for teams. 
Participants described the procedure of sharing 
understanding, knowledge, and information. 
• 
Co-production: we focused on the action that actors 
produced tasks or projects, especially the method 
and tools they used.  
• 
BIM experience and perspective: we asked the 
participants a straightforward question to see their 
first expression. The question is “Have you ever 
heard of BIM?” If so, participants explained their 
experiences and perspective. 
In total, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 
sixteen participants for approximately fourteen hours, 
divided into two steps.  
In the first step, we interviewed eight participants from 
three disciplines: architecture, structure, and MEP. These 
participants work in different companies and play various 
roles, including MEP engineers, architects, and structural 
engineers (Table IV).  
In the second step is the interviews of an additional eight 
participants (Table IV). The section of participants in the 2nd 
step were based on the outcome of the initial interview, 
aimed at gaining a more understanding of workflow 
scenarios. These eight participants were selected from 
management level, including free-lancer architects, MEP 
manager, CEO of contractor company, general manager, 
CEO of architecture company, BIM modeler and 
coordinator. These participants addressed the same five 
thematic areas but were required to provide a holistic 
account of the entire process, from design to construction 
phase. 
The number of participants is indeed restricted. However, 
qualitative research typically required a sample size of five 
to twenty-five samples are sufficient [56], and our sample of 
16 participants is considered acceptable. We know that this 
size could limit our research, but our work has allowed us to 
trace specific trends in the collaboration sector, illuminate 
the collaboration process and the workflow, and address the 
specificity of the construction sector in Cambodia, all with 
the aim of preparing for the BIM implementation.

B. Case study: Observation the construction projects in 
Cambodia 
In addition to our interview data, we complemented our 
research 
with 
field 
observations 
of 
construction 
project/company in Cambodia. These observations cover 
both projects without and with BIM deliverables.  
 
1) Construction project without BIM deliverables  
We 
received 
permission 
from 
Panhchaksela 
Construction company to conduct site visits to the Ly 
Vouch Leng Condo project in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. This 
high-rise condominium building consists of 30 floors and 
covers an area of 1 150m2. The stakeholder structure during 
our observation is illustrated in Fig. 1, which included 
project manager, site manager, MEP contractor, and 
structural consultant teams. At the time of our observation, 
the construction phase has been ongoing for two months 
with an expected completion date in 2024.

2) Construction project with BIM deliverables 
Our 
study 
concerning 
BIM 
implementation 
in 
construction project aims to address the question of how we 
facilitate and support BIM-enabled collaboration in 
Cambodia's construction sector. To gather insights into this 
aspect, we engaged with Shanghai Baoye (Cambodia) CO., 
LTD (SBCC), a Chinese construction company that has been 
established in Cambodia since 2016. SBCC has an extensive 
experience, having participated in high-rise construction 
more than 25 projects in Cambodia, including those in 
Phnom Penh, Sihanoukville, Siem Reap, Kampot, Koh 
Kong, and other locations.  
The presence of a company utilizing BIM in Cambodia 
is a positive indication. We conducted a questionnaire 
survey with a BIM engineer from SBCC, who was part of 
the project management team. The question covered various 
aspects, including information about the respondent, the 
company’s details, project specifics, BIM standards and 
protocols, 
BIM 
deliverables 
method, 
roles 
and 
responsibilities within the BIM process, workflow, 
dataflow, communication methods, BIM software usage at 
different project stages, and the engineer’s perspectives. To 
overcome language barriers, interviews were conducted 
following a questionnaire. 
 
IV. 
RESULTS 
The research results are demonstrated in the following.  
A. Actor relationship 
The findings from first step semi-structured interviews 
indicated a clear correlation between project tasks and roles 
actors. Subsequently, we categorized the participants into 
four distinct categories, each contingent on the relationship 
among project owners, designers, and contractors. These 
categories are summarized as follows: 
 
1) Category 1 
The owner separated the contract between the designer 
and the contractor. Participants who were involved with this 
project said that “[…] the foreign company provided the 
architectural plan […]”; and a local architect provided the 
finishing plan.  
 
2) Category 2 
The owner owned a company that has a full-package 
team: designer and constructor. He could be a real estate 
agent or own a company with many campuses. Thus, the 
owner used the same design for his many projects. The 
architect participant stated, “I design […], but I had to 
respect the previous project reference or guideline”; “I kept 
its style, function, similar size, and then I suited it in the 
new terrain.”  Projects could be banks, coffee shops, stores, 
factories, or a uniform residential building like Borey. The 
architect proposed and discussed the new architectural plan 
with the owner. The architectural plan must respect the 
standard of the previous project. 
 
3) Category 3 
The owner owned the full package of the design team. 
The contractor company built the project by follow up and 
participating in discussions from owner or his representative 
in construction phase.  
 
4) Category 4 
The owner hired a design-build company to oversee the 
project.  
 
B. Workflow 
Based on the data gathered from both step of semi-
structured interviews, we have identified four workflow 
scenarios that defined in eight phases (referred to as phase 
in Cambodia). These phases are initial, conceptual design, 
schematic 
design, 
tender 
design, 
permitting, 
BID, 
construction, and post-construction (Fig. 2).   
We illustrated Fig. 2 to provide a visual comparison of 
these four workflow scenarios across the project life cycle. 
Additionally, the tools and methods employed for 
communication, 
coordination, 
and 
co-production 
are 
depicted.  
 
1) Scenario 1 
In this scenario, the architect proposed the concept design 
corresponding to the owner’s requirements. The structural 
and MEP consultants also supported and advised on the 
design. They here had a role in giving ideas, critiquing, and 
predicting future technical problems. As the owner’s 
representatives, they also participated in accepting or 
rejecting the architect’s proposal. If the owner requests, the 
architect modifies his proposal until the owner approves it. 
Otherwise, the presence of consultants here was only in 
some cases. They did not participate in the conceptual 
design phase for some projects presented as shown in Fig. 3. 
Schematic design phase, structural and MEP designers 
proposed the structural and MEP design, respectively. Then, 
Figure 1. Stakeholder’s structure. 
80
International Journal on Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 16 no 3 & 4, year 2023, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/

they submitted those plans to the architect, who overlayed 
them and identified the clashes. The architect, structural 
engineer, and MEP engineer discussed solving those 
clashes. They modified those plans until these three parties, 
and the owner approved.   
Then, the architect, structural engineer, and MEP engineer 
detailed their plans. They also must list material quantities 
in detail and submit them to the owner. The owner gave 
these tender documents to many contractors for studies. 
Those contractors’ companies applied their proposal 
attached with cost estimates, build method, schedule, etc. 
Then, the owner chose a company to be a contractor. 
In the construction phase, the contractor submitted the 
progress report to the owner or consultant and completed the 
work mentioned in the contract. 
 
2) Scenario 2 
The architect proposed the conceptual architecture under 
the support of the structure and MEP engineer. If the owner 
rejects the proposal, it must repeat it. If the owner accepts 
the proposal, it moves to schematic design. 
Structure and MEP engineers designed the structure and 
MEP plan, respectively. The architect had a role in 
overlapping the three plans. Then, the architect, owner, 
structure, and MEP engineer discussed solving the clashes 
or technical problems between those three discipline plans. 
After the approval of the schematic design, the architect, 
structural, and MEP engineer provided detailed drawings for 
the building. 
 
3) Scenario C 
The workflow in the conceptual and schematic design 
phase is the same as in scenario B. The difference is the 
designer from the owner teams. The tender, construction, 
and post-construction workflow is the same as in scenario 
A. 
 
4) Scenario D 
An architect designs conceptual design. The Schematic 
Design phase is the same as in scenario A. The workflow of 
the tender, construction and post-construction phases is the 
same as in scenario B. But the contractors who designed and 
built the structure and MEP. 
 
C. Collaborative work: a balance between communication, 
coordination, and co-production  
The participant stated, “architect is remote, and we do the 
videoconference. The participant added, “[…] we sent 
questions via e-mail and got a response one week later.” In 
Cambodia, actors mostly communicate via social media in 
routine work, such as Telegram, WhatsApp, WeChat, etc., 
and in the form of voices, text, videos, and pictures. The 
architect shared all plans in Dropbox. If there were any 
updates, he sent us an e-mail with the link for access to a 
modified plan.  
They discussed it face-to-face. It can be a formal or 
informal meeting. A face-to-face meeting is better than a 
distant meeting to solve the critical situation [54]. Not only 
Computer-Aided (CAD) but actors also printed to make a 
discussion during the meetings. Workers preferred hard 
copies compared to soft copies. After getting the agreement, 
they updated the plan. The participant said, “[…] after 
discussion, I made a cloud in red color on layout and made a 
note, e.g., 3rd-floor modification on the layout plan.” Other 
actors received the updated information.  
In the construction phase, they discussed daily with the 
internal team (MEP management team, subcontractor) and 
finishing team, rarely with an architect. The structure team 
works more often with an architect. One participant 
mentioned using DWG Fast view application to demonstrate 
2D plans. It also allows him to use AutoCAD to verify its 
dimensions and take notes by smartphone. 
 
D. Problem-solving 
The issues on-site have been resolved through 
stakeholder discussions, which encompass both formal and 
informal meetings. These regular meetings are held bi-
weekly and are attended by key participants, including the 
project manager, site manager, MEP contractor, and 
structural consultant teams. The project management team 
represents the owner's interests and is responsible for 
guiding the project towards meeting its planning and cost 
targets. The site manager plays a pivotal role in 
troubleshooting and ensuring the progress of the work aligns 
with the project's success criteria. The consultant teams act 
as proxies for the owner to ensure the contractor adheres to 
the owner's requirements. 
The primary objective of these meetings is to provide 
progress reports on the work, address challenges related to 
retaining wall installation, and seek solutions. The meetings 
typically last for approximately 35 minutes. 
This process is depicted as a recurring cycle in Fig. 4. 
The meetings commence with progress reports and the 
introduction of challenges. The project manager and site 
manager propose solutions, initiating discussions. As the 
highest-ranking authority in the cooperative hierarchy, the 
project manager makes final decisions. Participants with 
specialized knowledge share their expertise with others. The 
information disseminated after each meeting includes 
proposals, opinions, and problem-solving strategies.  
Verbal communication serves as the primary method of 
interaction during these meetings, complemented by hand-
drawn diagrams and hard copies of plans to facilitate 
discussions.

E. BIM experiences and perspectives 
From semi-structured interviews conducted with a 
sample of sixteen participants, it emerged that eleven of 
them used to hear or know BIM. Among these, two 
individuals had received formal BIM training provided by 
their companies, while an additional four had acquired their 
knowledge through online or self-guided learning resources 
such as YouTube. These findings underscore the existing 
limitations in BIM training, highlighting a potential area for 
improvement, particularly within the context of universities 
and educational institutions. 
Interestingly, only one participant reported having 
practical experience with BIM in real application, indicating 
a lack of BIM implementation within the Cambodian 
construction industry. One stated, “Our team utilized BIM 
for quantity and cost estimation, design planification during 
in Bidding phase.” Furthermore, among the sixteen 
participants, 
one 
was 
engaged 
in 
BIM 
modeling 
(architecture) and served as a BIM coordinator. This 
individual had undergone company-sponsored BIM training 
and emphasized the considerable benefits of BIM, 
particularly in terms of reducing rework and minimizing 
wastage of time. They also acknowledged the challenges 
associated with transitioning from traditional software to 
BIM, emphasizing the need for additional expertise to 
address the difficulties encountered. 
One architecture company expressed an interest in 
adopting BIM but voiced concerns about the associated 
expenses and time required to train their staff. Additionally, 
they indicated that their decision would be contingent upon 
project 
owner 
requirements. 
Another 
participant 
acknowledged the advantages of BIM in construction but 
admitted to needing more time for learning. Due to the 
limited familiarity with BIM among collaborators, this 
individual found it necessary to export BIM models to 
DWG format each time they shared documents with their 
partners.  
Shanghai Baoye (Cambodia) CO., LTD stands as a 
pioneering entity in the widespread adoption of Building 
Information Modeling (BIM) across numerous projects in 
Cambodia, 
contributing 
significantly 
to 
developing 
professionals in this field. SBCC has been actively engaged 
in these endeavors, assuming roles as bidders, general 
contractors, and sub-contractors.  
A BIM engineer affiliated with SBCC has diligently 
provided insights through our questionnaires. She/he 
outlined the utilization of several standards, including 
BS1192 (collaborative production, management & exchange 
of AEC information), PAS1192-2 (information management 
using 
BIM 
- 
capital 
delivery 
phase), 
PAS1192-3 
Figure 2. Four workflow scenarios in construction in Cambodia [1].

(information management using BIM - operational phase), 
BS8536 (soft landing - handover & post occupancy 
evaluation), 
and 
PAS 
1192-2:2013 
(information 
management).  
BIM engineer has specified that BIM has been used for 
tasks 
such 
as 
building 
performance 
analysis 
and 
design/draw MEP coordinate. It is important to clarify that 
the reference to "Building Performance Analysis" does not 
exclusively entail the analysis, evaluation, or simulation of 
building performance parameters, which encompass aspects 
like energy efficiency, occupant comfort, and environmental 
impact. To eliminate any ambiguity, we conducted an in-
depth interview to extract more precise information. 
She/he described the communication question in 
general. Effective communication within the team is 
characterized by several principals:  
• 
Team members prioritize communication by 
ensuring that everyone has an opportunity to both 
speak and listen simultaneously during discussions. 
This fosters inclusivity and active engagement. 
• 
Communication is primarily conducted through 
face-to-face interactions, emphasizing the use of 
both verbal expressions and gestures to convey 
information. This robust approach enhances clarity 
and mutual understanding. 
• 
Team members establish direct links with one 
another, promoting open communication channels 
not solely reliant on communication through a team 
leader. This reflects a culture of respect and 
equality within the team. 
• 
Team communication goals encompass both formal 
and informal interactions, allowing team members 
to engage in discussions not limited to official team 
meetings. This flexibility encourages diverse forms 
of collaboration and knowledge exchange. 
• 
Team members regularly venture outside the team 
to 
explore 
external 
resources 
and 
gather 
information. This information is subsequently 
shared with the team, avoiding unnecessary 
duplication 
of 
efforts 
and 
promoting 
resourcefulness. 
In summary, these communication practices underscore 
the importance of inclusive, clear, respectful, and 
resourceful 
communication 
within 
the 
team, 
contributing to effective collaboration and knowledge 
sharing. 
The software tools are employed for various purposes 
within the project workflow. These software tools can be 
categorized as follows: 
• 
Programing: Microsoft office, WPS (Writer, 
Presentation, Spreadsheets), Adobe Photoshop. 
• 
Designing: Revit (Architect, Structural, MEP 
Template), AutoCAD, 3D studio max, CAD MEP, 
ArchiCAD, Lumion,  
• 
Analysis: AutoCAD Civil 3D, Autodesk, Steps 
software. 
• 
Management: Microsoft Project, Synchro, Asite, 
BIM technologies, Autodesk Naviworks, Takeoff 
Cubicost (QS), Review: AutoCAD, Autodesk 
Design Review, PDF, Second life. 
• 
Review: AutoCAD, Autodesk Design Review, 
PDF, Second life. 
 
Fig. 5 illustrates the BIM workflow implemented by 
Shanghai Baoye (Cambodia), as outlined below: 
The project owner provided 2D plans to the contractor 
company. The BIM team’s responsibility generated 
geometrically precise 3D models from 2D Computer-Aided 
Design (CAD) plans. The primary software utilized for 
modeling is Revit. Within the SBCC BIM modeling 
workflow, modeling tasks are distributed among BIM team 
members based on floor levels or towers; the partial models 
are then combined.   
A team member assumes the role of clash detection 
overseer. This individual exports architectural, structural, 
and MEP models from .rvt to .nwd format for clash 
detection purposes.. All identified clashes are screenshotted 
and reported in .doc format. This report is then submitted to 
the project owner for review and feedback. Subsequently, 
the BIM team undertakes corrective actions and revises the 
information or models as deemed necessary after discussion. 
The BIM models serve various purposes, including 
utilization in the bidding and/or construction phase. The 
BIM models are subject to two distinct modes of export: 
• 
Quantitative analysis and cost estimation: BIM 
models play an integral role in conducting 
meticulous quantity and cost estimations pertinent 
to the construction endeavor. To facilitate this 
process, BIM models are exported from the .rvt 
(Revit) format to the Industry Foundation Classes 
(IFC) format. These IFC-formatted models are 
subsequently imported into the Take-off Cubicost 
software. The utilization of Take-off Cubicost 
software allows for precise cost estimations, thus 
aiding in financial planning and budgeting for the 
project. 
• 
Construction planning and execution: the BIM 
models are pivotal in orchestrating comprehensive 
construction planning and execution strategies. 
Furthermore, BIM technology extends to the 
creation of various visual assets (e.g., video, image, 
etc.) and generation comprehensive documentation 
pertinent to on-site construction. 
Based on the questionnaire and interview, the following 
conclusion can be drawn: 
• 
Roles in the BIM process: the BIM process at 
SBCC involves two distinct roles: BIM modelers 
and 
BIM 
coordinators. 
BIM 
modelers 
are 
responsible for creating precise geometrically 
accurate models. BIM coordinators are responsible 
for supervising the BIM modelers, ensuring model 
accuracy, and conducting clash detection checks.

• 
BIM utilization at SBCC: SBCC leverages BIM 
for various purposes, encompassing 3D BIM for 
modeling and documentation, 4D BIM for 
planification, and 5D BIM for cost estimation.  
• 
Lack of BIM procedure protocol: notably, there 
is currently no documented BIM procedure 
protocol in place at SBCC. This suggests a 
potential area for improvement in formalizing and 
standardizing their BIM processes. 
• 
Challenges 
in 
BIM 
questionnaire: 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
BIM-related 
questionnaires 
appears to be hampered by language and 
comprehension gaps among the participants. This 
highlights the importance of clear communication 
and common understanding when collecting BIM-
related information. 
• 
BIM workflow: the BIM workflow was drawn and 
submitted 
to 
Shanghai 
Baoye 
(Cambodia) 
company, and after review, it received approval. 
This conclusion provides insights into the organizational 
structure and BIM practices, emphasizing the need for 
formalized procedures and improved communication 
strategies for BIM-related activities. 
 
V. 
DISCUSSION  
In Scenarios A and D, the project will be challenged with 
many technical problems in the schematic design phase if 
there is no participation of structural and MEP engineers in 
the concept design phase. Engineers will request the 
architect to make many changes affecting the conception 
design that due to wasting time and design costs. Otherwise, 
with the collaboration of other disciplines, the conceptual 
design will easily convince the owner to accept, reducing 
design error, time, and cost. The architect, structural 
engineer, and MEP engineer participated in the project since 
the early design phase in Scenarios B and C. As the claim of 
[41], the actors tend to isolate working, which is the 
roadblock to BIM collaboration. Thus, the collaborative 
culture in our scenarios is a good sight of the construction 
sector in Cambodia to influence BIM collaboration. 
The similarity and differences between our workflow 
scenarios and the workflow we assumed from the FIDIC 
contracts were figured out. Scenario A and C are 
comparable to (1). In condition contract for construction, the 
designer or owner design almost the whole project. At the 
same time, the designer also brings this action in Scenario 
A, and the owner completes this task in scenario C. In 
scenario A and C, the contractor specified the design and 
completed the works as mentioned in (1). 
In Scenario D, the designer designed only the conceptual 
design. The contractor designed in the schematic design 
phase. At the same time, the contractor designed almost the 
whole project in (2). The contractor in Scenario D also 
handled the work after the design phase, such as giving 
instructions, specifying design, method, execution, and 
completing the project, as mentioned in (2). In Scenario B, 
the owner handles everything by himself. We cannot find a 
similarity between Scenario B with any case in FIDIC 
contracts. 
Cambodia’s construction sector still uses CAD as the 
main tool to complete projects, as Rezaei and Sistani 
claimed [40]. Overall, actors are familiar with traditional 
project delivery methods. They are used to the problem and 
resistant to change. The participant stated, “normally, we 
had to re-model, re-check, and re-work. I don’t think other 
tools can reduce it.” Nevertheless, the participants who had 
experience with BIM practice or BIM training strongly 
believe that the waste from poor cost and schedule 
performance will be reduced by BIM adoption. 
The BIM-based processed in the BID phase (Fig. 6). The 
contractor modeled BIM models in different disciplines 
based on the final designs that were provided. The 
contractor also extended the specific details. He coordinated 
the BIM-Models collaboration, identified the clashes and 
co-produced multi-disciplinary model via visualization. 
Moreover, he estimated the cost and scheduled performance 
in the further execution works. In our participant’s case, the 
contractor volunteered using BIM by put a lot of effort and 
had a strong commitment into fighting the barrier of 
adoption BIM in Cambodia’s construction project: “strong 
industry resistance to change [37].”  
A questionnaire survey method was employed for data 
collection, 
with 
participants 
providing 
response 
independently. However, our find revealed significant 
knowledge gaps among participants and researcher, which is 
a challenge of research on BIM in Cambodia due to the 
Figure 3. Scenario A in the conceptual design phase [1]. 
Figure 4. Action in the meeting. 
84

limited common language, knowledge, and understanding. 
For example, while eleven out of sixteen respondents had 
heard of BIM, they were unable to provide an accurate 
definition. Remarkably, BIM was often equated with Revit, 
indicating a need for clarification. Furthermore, as 
mentioned in the results section, respondents associated 
Building Performance Analysis more with the modelling 
process than its energy, structural, and environmental 
aspects. Given these challenges, it became evident that 
questionnaires alone were insufficient, and interviews would 
be a more effective means of data collection.  
 
 
Figure 5. BIM workflow of Shanghai Baoye (Cambodia) Company. 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 6. Workflow of BIM modeling in a project in Cambodia [1]. 
 
The research of Schöttle et al. [42] has identified trust, 
communication, commitment, knowledge sharing, and 
information 
exchange, 
are 
the 
factors 
to 
succeed 
collaboration. However, these factors are dependent on a 
shared 
language, 
common 
knowledge, 
and 
mutual 
understanding. Herbert Clark's psycholinguistic research 
emphasizes the importance of common ground for effective 
communication [54]. In the context of Cambodia’s AEC 
industry, achieving such a common reference is essential.  
To address the challenges faced in Cambodia’s AEC 
sector 
and 
enhance 
BIM 
adaptation, 
several 
recommendations are proposed:  
• 
Establish common reference and guideline: 
Developing a common reference and guidelines 
specific to the Cambodian context is vital to 
fostering 
collaboration 
and 
ensuring 
data 
centralization for future urbanization projects. 
• 
Promoting BIM education: Promoting BIM 
courses within architecture, engineering, and 
construction universities is essential to equip future 
professionals with the necessary skills and 
knowledge. The companies have a willingness to 
use BIM by starting from training their staff. Yet, it 
takes a lot of time and effort. In United States, the 
companies prefer to employ candidate with BIM 
skills rather than those who lack BIM knowledge 
[40].  
• 
Regulatory framework: Introducing government 
or owner requirements for BIM adoption can 
incentivize AEC companies to transition towards 
BIM-based practices. Additionally, establishing 
contractual 
standards 
that 
accommodate 
multidisciplinary 
organizational 
structures 
is 
crucial. The architecture company’s owner said, 
“I’ll accept to move to a BIM-based model if it is 
the 
governments 
or 
owners’ 
requirement.” 
Moreover, it also required contractual standards 
that 
support 
multidisciplinary 
actors’ 
organizational structures [40]. 
 
The workflow scenarios describe the relationship of 
actors depending on the type of each scenario and program 
of construction. However, the current descriptions lack 
precision in elucidating the specificities behind these 
relationships. The limited sample size of 16 interviewees 
and observations from 2 construction projects prevents 
generalization to the broader context of Cambodia. It is 
crucial to explore the complexities and have a more 
comprehensive understanding.  
 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
The empirical findings presented in this study provide 
valuable into the construction sector, particularly in the 
context of Cambodia. The research sheds light on factors 
85
International Journal on Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 16 no 3 & 4, year 2023, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/

that can contribute to the successful execution of 
construction projects in the region. 
 
A. Finding 
The research found four workflow scenarios. The main 
factor differs these scenarios in the Cambodian construction 
sector is the degree and timing of collaboration built between 
the owner(s), designers, and contractor(s). The study also 
underscore that traditional approaches still dominate project 
delivery in Cambodia, even for large-scale projects. 
BIM has not yet gained widespread traction in Cambodia. 
The experts involved in large projects strongly believe that 
BIM can influence their project to be more productive. Yet, 
they still resistance to change. Its adoption requires enhanced 
motivation, training, and practical implementation, with a 
particular emphasis on government support by establishing 
the guidelines and regulations framework. This reference 
shall identify the accurate tasks, duties, and interactions of 
actors involved in the project. These guides will serve as a 
light to aiding the industry stakeholders in the successful 
implementation of BIM in their projects. Furthermore, the 
standards should align with the vision for a new project 
delivery approach, such as BIM, capable of addressing cost 
and schedule performance challenges and fostering more 
efficient project outcomes. The adoption of BIM in 
Cambodia necessitates a focus on human resource 
development. New roles, including BIM modelers, BIM 
coordinators, and BIM managers, will play pivotal roles in 
the BIM process. 
  
B. Further work 
Given the small number of samples, this research seeks 
to deliver valuable insights within its boundaries. Despite 
the modest sample size, the study aims to provide an 
understanding by recognizing its limitations and highlight 
the significance of the findings within the given resource 
constraints. While the findings are based on a smaller 
cohort, they contribute meaningfully to the existing 
knowledge in the field, laying the groupwork for future 
research with a more extensive participant. Future research 
should aim to expand the sample size to further validate and 
build upon the current findings. This broader approach will 
enable 
a 
more 
comprehensive 
exploration 
of 
the 
collaboration sector and the intricacies of workflow in the 
construction industry, facilitating a deeper understanding.  
 
Furthermore, further research should concentrate on 
evaluating the impact BIM adoption within the Cambodian 
context. This assessment will provide valuable insights into 
the effectiveness of BIM in enhancing project outcomes, 
efficiency, and productivity in this specific regional context. 
It is imperative to embark on the development of 
guidelines aimed at facilitating the integration of BIM 
practices into Cambodia's construction sector. These 
guidelines will serve as a critical roadmap for industry 
stakeholders, paving the way for the adoption of more 
efficient and technologically advanced methodologies. This 
objective can be achieved by conducting an extensive 
review of existing BIM guidelines and standards from a 
global perspective. Notably, the study should encompass 
Asian countries such as China, South Korea, and Japan, 
given their significant role as foreign investors in Cambodia. 
Additionally, European nations, including Belgium and 
France, which are pivotal members of the International 
Federation of Consulting Engineers (FIDIC) contract that 
finds extensive use in Cambodia, should be considered. 
Moreover, the examination of BIM guidelines from 
leading BIM practitioners such as the United Kingdom and 
Luxembourg, renowned for their advancements in BIM 
technology, will provide invaluable insights.  
These efforts will play a pivotal role in advancing the 
industry towards heightened efficiency and technological 
sophistication, ensuring alignment with global best practices 
in BIM implementation.
