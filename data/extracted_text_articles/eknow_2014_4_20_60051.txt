Abstract--The goal of this paper is to identify factors that
affect e-Learners’ satisfaction in a large corporation in
Saudi Arabia. By adopting an organisational/technological
perspective to the e-Learning system, the existing body of
literature on e-Learning was reviewed and a suitable
theoretical model was selected as an initial theoretical
framework characterising various underlying factors for
the
e-Learners’
satisfaction
in
today’s
workplace
environments in general. Through four semi-structured
interviews with employees selected from the case study
organisation
the
current
study
attempts
to
identify
additional factors that may be relevant to the large Middle
Eastern
corporations.
This,
in
turn,
will
facilitate
development
of
a
survey
questionnaire
that
crosses
distinctively
different
cultures,
which
constitutes
the
author’s future study.
Keywords—e-Learning; workplace learning; organizational
learning; technology acceptance model.
I.
INTRODUCTION
A. Background
Over the past decade, there has been a sharp global
trend
in
the
adoption
of
e-Learning
systems
by
multinational
corporations.
E-Learning
is
now
considered as a popular approach to learning and
teaching in the workplace due to its flexibility and ease
of access, just-in-time delivery, and cost-effectiveness
[1], as well as ease of access, consistency, and customer
value [2].
Workplace learning is defined by Ellinger [3] as
“the processes, means, and activities in the workplace
by which employees learn from basic skills to high
technology
and
management
practices
that
are
immediately applicable to their jobs, duties, and roles”.
Workplace learning, in general, and e-Learning at
workplace, in particular, is a rapidly expanding sector in
many of the Middle Eastern countries. Based on a
recent study, most large companies in Saudi Arabia
have a long history of adopting e-Learning in their
workplace [4]. The top management is well informed
about e-Learning and its possibilities, and they are
looking for ways to enhance their initiatives with the
latest that is available in the world. Based on a recent
study, the Saudi e-Learning market has been growing at
33% annually during the period 2008 – 2012 [4]. Based
on other studies, the projected growth rate for the entire
Middle East during the period of 2009-2014 is just 8%,
making it one of the slower growth regions in the world.
This may indicate that the Saudi Arabia is one of the
fastest growing countries in the Middle East for
embracing e-Learning methods for workplaces [4].
The current study applies an existing e-Learning
satisfaction model to a workplace environment within a
large petroleum company in the Middle East in order to:
(i) evaluate the applicability of the model to the selected
industry, and (ii) provide insights into additional
underlying industry- and/or culture-specific factors that
affect e-Learners in workplace environments that have
not been explored in previous studies.
The ultimate aim of the study is to gain a better
understanding
of the
above
factors
in
workplace
environments, the latter being severely under-studied.
In other words, by assessing applicability of various
success factors in e-Learning environments in higher
education to the workplace environments the current
study
aims
to
develop
a
specialised
theoretical
framework for e-Learning satisfaction in the workplace
as perceived by the adult learners. To achieve the above
goals,
the
study
adopts
qualitative
research
methodology by conducting various semi-structured
interviews with various stakeholders. Then, the results
are analysed using thematic analysis in order to both
evaluate the applicability of various underlying factors,
as well as exploring additional factors that may affect e-
Learners’ satisfaction in the workplace in a large
Middle Eastern corporation.
B. Case Study
The case study organization is a large oil company
in the Middle East with main activities being crude oil
production and petroleum refining. The company has
almost
52,000
employees
and
the
e-Learning
environment of the study include Area Information
Technology (IT) department with 3,000 user-learners.
Arabic language development is a key requirement of
the company’s e-Learning program in the company,
although many younger generations of employees who
are graduates from the universities in western countries

are comfortable with just English language courses. A
distinct cultural mix exists within the organisation as a
result of the existence of a significant number of
American and British citizens as well as young Saudi
graduates from western universities at senior levels of
company management. As a result of such cultural mix,
one major objective of the company’s workplace e-
Learning
program
is
to
eliminate
communication
barriers throughout the organisation while, at the same
time, hierarchy is to be respected and things may move
slowly when it comes to decision making.
II.
THEORETICAL MODEL
Historically, several theoretical models have been
proposed
for explaining individuals’ attitudes and
acceptance of information systems in general. The
majority of those models are extensions of the original
works, such as the theory of reasoned action [5], the
theory of planned behaviour [6], and
technology
acceptance model [7], and have generalised these
theories to the e-Learning environment by adopting an
organisational approach a combination of organisational
and technological approaches to the e-Learning. On the
other
hand,
researchers
in
the
fields
of
social
psychology and information systems have identified
different sets of factors for the success of e-Learning
and e-Learners’ satisfaction in higher education. A list
of the major factors and brief explanation for each is
presented in Table 1.

A study by Sun et al. [16] provides an integrated e-
Learning model based on the technology acceptance
model aimed at learners in higher education with six
categorical
dimensions
including
student,
teacher,
course, technology, system design, and environmental
dimension. The current study applies a modified version
of the above model to the domain of e-Learning in the
workplace
while
addressing
specific
issues
and
differences between the higher education and workplace
environments. The above model is presented in Figure
1, along with the hypotheses of the study. On the other
hand, some previous studies have provided insights into
the differences between higher education and workplace
environments, and indicate that one major difference
between the two environments is the nature and
motivation of the learners in the two environments [17].
The current study has incorporated these differences
when designing interview questions and analysing the
results.
III.
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
This study adopts a positivist qualitative research
method for the following two reasons: (i) a reasonable
size of literature already exists in the domain of e-
Learning in higher education that can initially be used
for ‘exploring’ relevant and specialised constructs in
workplace environments (hence, adopting a positivist
perspective), and (ii) there are limited prior studies that
investigate e-Learning in workplaces (hence, the choice
of interview method).
Interview
questions
were
developed
using
the
theoretical model in Figure 1 in order to assess the
relevance
of
those
factors
to
the
workplace
environments. By analysing the interview results, we
aim to develop a specialised model that explains e-
Learning effectiveness in workplace environments in
large Middle Eastern organisations. The results from
these interviews provide guidelines for developing a
comprehensive set of survey questions incorporating
large number of respondents for further validation of
the model. However, the latter is subject of future work.

INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
Four interviewees were selected purposefully each
representing sample from various major user groups
within
the
e-Learning
organisation
with
adequate
knowledge about the program. Each interview took
almost 30 minutes. The major aim of these interviews
was to assist in the development of a large survey
questionnaire
instrument
for
a
future
study
by
identifying various hidden factors and measures that
collectively define e-Learning satisfaction in the case
study organisation. More specifically, the interview
questions were developed to achieve the following
goals:

Understanding
the
background
of
the
company’s e-Learning system by applying the
theoretical
model
of
the
study.
Such
understanding was achieved by learning about
various e-Learning environmental dimensions
specified in the theoretical model of Figure 1.

Confirming/assessing suitability of the above
model, and

Discovering possible additional factors that may
be specific to the large corporations in the
Middle East.
A summary of the interview questions is shown in
the following paragraphs. These questions were used to
guide the interviewee towards an understanding of
underlying factors that may affect learner’s satisfaction,
as described by the learners and their management.
Detailed responses are not reported in this paper.

Question 1: What type of computer attitude do you
expect
employees
must
have
towards
successful
completion of this e-Learning course? Do they have to
love computers and feel easy and comfortable about it
OR they can still succeed even if they are not very
comfortable with computers in general? Does such fact
make any difference in the success of employees?
Please explain your reasons in some details.
Question 2: Can you answer the above question
again in relation to the knowledge of the Internet? Do
you
expect
learners/employees
to
be
very
knowledgeable about the Internet? Why and why not?
What is your minimum set of criteria for the learner’s
knowledge of the Internet for successful completion of
the course?
Question 3: Compared with the traditional face-to-
face learning, in what ways do you believe that taking
the e-Learning course will help learners to improve
their work and efficiency? In other words, explain the
advantages and disadvantage of each method in terms
of working efficiently: which method is more useful
and why?
Question 4: Compared with the traditional face-to-
face learning, in what ways do you believe that taking
the e-Learning course will help learners to progress in
their career more quickly? In other words, explain the
advantages and disadvantage of each method in terms
of career progress of the learners. Which method is
more useful and why?
Question 5: Do you believe e-Learning course
motivates learners to learn better? Why and why not?
Question 6: In what ways do you think the e-
Learning course might improve the way learners learn?
Explain
Question 7: How do you think the e-Learning course
can be provided in more useful way?
Question
8:
Do
you
think
that
there
is
any
productivity gains in using the e-Learning courses
compared to the traditional courses? Justify your
answer.
A summary of the results, in the form of the most
frequent responses (as interpreted by the researcher) is

courses.
- Adults like socialization & require
emotional engagement in activities. There
should be opportunities for people to
communicate, collaborate and share
experience
- Use of mobile phones is widespread. Most
people carry two phones. However, data
access is costly.
- In the past, sometimes strictly observing
hierarchy has had negative effects on me

- If it brings various (small/large) groups
together, productivity will increase through
experience-sharing
- It must be directly related to my work
activities

ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
The current study is the first phase of a large
research
project
that
consists
of
a
preliminary
qualitative
study
(the
current
study)
and
a
comprehensive quantitative study (the future study) in
order to enhance effectiveness of e-Learning methods
when applied to large workplace environments. The
goal of the interviews in the current study is to develop
further insights into the design of the main quantitative
study. Based on such objective, the interview results are
analysed in this section.
One major finding from the interviews was that no
instructor was normally present in the case study
organisation; therefore, there were no interactions
between the learner and instructor. As a result, no
questions
could
be
asked
about
the
Instructor’s
Response Timeliness, Instructor’s Attitude Towards e-
Learning and Perceived level of Interaction factors that
appear in the proposed theoretical model originally
developed for the Higher Education.
Furthermore, findings indicated that their e-Learning
system
did
not
provide
any
interaction
and
communication
functionalities
among
e-Learners,
indicating
that
the
current
study
was
unable
to
investigate
the
relationship
between
the
level
of
interaction among the e-Learners and the perceived e-
Learner satisfaction in the workplace. However, the
87

eKNOW 2014 : The Sixth International Conference on Information, Process, and Knowledge Management

interviewees provided insightful comments on this
matter. They suggested that one of the main motivations
for the case study organisation to adopt e-Learning
method is the need for “managing employee’s e-
Learning rather than just promoting rich learning
experiences” as currently the e-Learning courses are
offered
with
little
interaction
and
communication
functions. Confirming the above suggestion, many
researchers have already suggested that interactive
instructional design (highly
communicative)
is
an
essential factor for learning satisfaction and success
[13][18], therefore it is recommended that organisations
implement,
utilise
and
promote
interaction
and
communication functions in their e-Learning courses in
order to enhance the life-long learning experience in the
workplace.
Overall, respondents identified a variety of measures
for measuring various environmental dimensions shown
in Figure 1 that can be utilised when designing the
survey questions of the future main study. For example,
the answers to Question 1 implied that, while some
employees may still prefer ‘paper work’, almost all of
them recognised that the use of computers will certainly
facilitate their task. Such recognition of the benefits that
automated workflows may ultimately be useful to for
them to overcome the short-term difficulties of learning
about
computers
(e.g.,
anxiety
of
working
with
computers,
etc.).
Similar
interpretations
of
other
interview
results
will
provide
useful
hints
for
developing the main survey questionnaire instrument as
was one of the main intentions of the current study.
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH
Among other things, one major objective of the
current study was to act as a pilot study for developing a
survey questionnaire instrument for a large sample
across
multiple
organisational
cultures.
Most
e-
Learning courses are designed in Western cultures,
whereas
the
largest
and
fastest-growing
countries
originate from eastern cultures such as China, Japan,
India, and now the Middle East. With globalisation
increasing and cross-cultural exchanges accelerating in
the recent years, a future similar study that incorporates
various organisational and national cultures would
facilitate success of e-Learning in workplaces. We
intend to extend the current study to other major
corporations in various other cultures in order to
explore culture-specific factors for the success of e-
Learning programs in today’s organisations.
