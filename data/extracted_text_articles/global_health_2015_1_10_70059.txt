Abstract. Health communication and information exchange is 
important in public health. Despite the fact that adequate 
health information is a patient right according to Norwegian 
law, complaints from patients to the authorities on lack of 
information and communication are frequent. The purpose of 
the paper is to discuss health communication and health 
information exchange for patients undergoing vascular surgery 
for abdominal aorta aneurism (AAA), with particular focus on 
the communicative practices in a typical patient trajectory for 
this 
cohort. 
Both 
verbal 
communication 
and 
written 
information exchanged through health information systems 
during the patient trajectory are included in the data. The 
project is theoretically and analytically inspired by linguistic 
and discourse analytical perspectives on information and 
communication about health.

INTRODUCTION 
Health communication is important in public health [1]. 
Information exchange and health communication is essential 
for patients’ confidence in the healthcare services. Trust is a 
basic premise for good patient care, and is an important 
patient right in Norway. The Patient Rights Act [2] is 
specifically designed to "promote trust between the patient 
and healthcare services, to promote social security and 
respect for the individual patient and the user's life, integrity 
and human dignity". However, the feedback from patients 
and clients demonstrates that information exchange and 
health communication are areas for improvement. Also the 
Ombudsman 
and 
the 
authorities 
emphasize 
that 
communication needs to be improved [3].  
Structuring patient care in patient trajectories is a strategic 
move to make patient care predictable for patients. A patient 
trajectory is “the chronological chain of events that concerns 
the individual patients with different healthcare systems”[4]. 
Good patient trajectories are characterized by the fact that 
these events are put together in a rational and coordinated 
way to meet different patient needs. Central Norway 
Regional Health emphasizes in its strategy that: “the 
treatment course should be predictable, coherent and 
effective for patients and their families" [5]. The glue in the 
patient trajectory is the health communication and 
information exchange between health professionals and 
patients. A predictable patient trajectory for patients requires 
that information exchange and health communication 
between healthcare providers and the patient is adequate at 
all levels, both in primary and specialist health services.  
Health communication and information exchange is 
complex in modern healthcare organizations that are 
technology-intensive and consists of professionals with 
different roles and tasks. The healthcare sector is an arena 
that is constituted by different communication practices, 
such as oral conversations (doctor-patient conversations, 
expert talks, the head-staff conversations), written texts 
(invitation letters, information letters, discharge summaries, 
procedures). 
The 
use 
of 
medical 
technologies 
and 
information and communication technology tools with 
different purposes (X-rays, ultrasound, imaging systems, 
patient 
administrative 
systems, 
ePrescription, 
curve 
solutions, welfare technologies) is extensive. 
Good communication between individuals and among 
participants in multidisciplinary medical teams is essential 
for the diagnosis to be correct, for the treatment to be 
relevant and for the information to be maintained. The 
introduction of ICT systems, medical technologies and 
welfare technologies lead to organizational and practical 
work 
changes. 
These 
changes 
challenge 
established 
communicative 
practices. 
Preferably, 
changes 
in 
communicative practices should result in improvements in 
information processing and dissemination, precision in 
diagnosis and effectiveness of treatment. Unfortunately, we 
have seen examples that it rather can result in ambiguity, 
confusion and resistance in terms of application and 
dissemination.  
A successful introduction of new technologies such as 
ICT, medical technologies and welfare technologies requires 
knowledge of the communicative practices that technologies 
will help to address. Therefore, mapping studies of 
communicative practices through a patient trajectory are 
required. Examining the single-case studies may enable us to

understand what improves or degrades the established 
practices. 
The objective of this paper is to discuss health 
communication and information exchange in the chain of 
activity types in patient trajectories for patients undergoing 
surgery for AAA. The goal is to map and describe the 
activity types during a patient trajectory, from hospitalization 
and surgery to discharge. The research questions are:  
1) What characterizes the chain of activity types in a typical 
patient trajectory?  
2) Who are the participants in the activity types?  
3) Which are the communicative practices in the activity 
types? 
 
Section II offers a discussion about the theoretical 
perspectives of the study. Section III presents the 
methodological approach. The results are presented in 
Section IV, and discussed in Section V.   
II. 
THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES 
The theoretical and analytical approach in this project is 
discourse analysis, which offers concepts and tools for 
describing communicative practices at different levels. 
Traditionally the concept of discourse is understood as 
language use in oral or written communication in a social 
context. Candlin [6] points out that oral and written 
language has a constructive and dynamic role when it comes 
to structuring knowledge, as well as for structuring social 
and institutional practices in which knowledge is created 
and used. Discourses influence, and are influenced by social 
practices, 
and 
are 
consequently 
constructing 
and 
reproducing the social interaction. Since discourse is part of 
the social interaction it is culturally dependent.  
Healthcare 
consists 
of 
discourses 
in 
continuous 
development, and because of the many divergent discourses, 
conflicts and misunderstandings may occur. Discourse 
analysis can help to identify the mechanisms in the social 
practices, and to interpret discursive structures, social roles, 
social identities, social behaviour and social practices.There 
are different approaches to discourse analysis depending on 
what you want to study. Through activity analysis this 
project focuses on describing the activity type, and on 
structural, interactional and thematic mapping of the 
consultations [7] [8].  Activity types are examples of 
patterns of the communicative situation, and are referred to 
as a "script" or "form" of the type of activity [9]. An activity 
type is a description of a communication situation. An 
activity type can be described by focusing on the following 
issues: 1) the participants 2) the goals and tasks, 3) the 
phases, 4) the roles and responsibilities of the participants, 
and 5) the contextual framework (time, space and artefact) 
[10] [16]. A structural mapping of an activity type includes 
an identification of communicative markers for defining the 
focused incident phases. For example, Byrne and Long [11] 
proposed the following phases in the doctor-patient 
conversation in primary care:  1) relate to the patient, 2) 
uncover the cause of the patient's attendance, 3) conduct 
verbal and / or physical examination of the patient's 
condition, 4) determine the treatment or more examinations 
and finally 5) the completion of the consultation. Each of 
these phases of the consultation can be subdivided into 
smaller communicative elements. An interactional mapping 
focuses on the communicative relations between the 
participants in the activity type. Through activity analysis 
we may reveal aspects of the interaction between the actors 
in the different phases. Moreover, the thematic mapping 
reveals what issues are at focus in the activity type. This 
type of analysis may provide both an overview, and the 
details of what characterizes the discourse and social 
practice. In this paper, when studying a chain of activity 
types in a patient trajectory, the focus is on identifying the 
types of communicative practices and the participants.  
III. 
METHODOLOGY 
The discourse analytical approach in this project required 
an ethnographic and problem-oriented approach. We studied 
communication in the context in which it normally occurs. 
To identify relevant empirical data, the researcher 
conducted a pilot project where she observed selected 
clinical departments at a hospital in Norway. The purpose of 
the pilot project was to get an impression of the institutional 
practices, and the communicative practices at the 
department. The researcher participated during surgery and 
clinical encounters, and made field notes. After an overall 
strategic, technical and practical assessment, the section for 
vascular surgery was selected as the primary empirical field 
for data collection of communicative practices in patient 
trajectories. The cohort consisted of patients with abdominal 
aorta aneurism (AAA) that would go through either 
Conventional open (OR) surgery, or an Endovascular 
Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) surgery [12]. 
The study is based on participant observation in the 
empirical field. The researcher followed 10 patients from 
admission to the hospital, through all the communicative 
practices that they attended, until they were discharged from 
the hospital. Exploratory and interpretive methods are useful 
to promote knowledge of predefined or open research 
questions [13]. The purpose of this approach is to gain 
detailed knowledge about what actually happens during 
health consultations. The researcher has experience with 
field analysis in general and activity analysis in particular 
[14]. During the fieldwork and the participatory observation 
at a large hospital in Norway, the researcher made detailed 
observation notes and transcripts of the talk of the patients 
and the healthcare professionals. Additional data was 
electronic patient records notes and other written material. 
The purpose of this broad data collection was to gain 
insights about the whole chain of verbal and written 
communicative practices between health professionals 
involved in the treatment of the individual patients.

RESULTS 
This section offers a presentation of the results from the 
study, focusing on 1) the chain of activity types in a typical 
patient trajectory for AAA, 2) the participants involved in 
the different activity types and 3) the communicative 
practices. 
A. The chain of activity types in a typical patient trajectory  
During the pilot project, and in discussions with the head 
of the department, the researcher identified the following 
chain of activity types in a typical patient trajectory for 
patients that are going through AAA surgery: 
 
Figure 1. Example of the chain of activity types in a typical patient 
trajectory for AAA surgery 
 
The patient experiences symptoms, and consults the 
general practitioner (GP). AAA is a condition occasionally 
without symptoms, and is often identified by chance in other 
consultations. The GP consults the patient locally, and 
subsequently refers to a polyclinic consultation at the 
hospital. A consultation with a specialist reveals whether it 
should be further investigated for possible surgery, or if the 
patient can be followed up by the GP. The specialist also 
decides if the patients should be admitted and prepared for 
Conventional open (OR) surgery, or an Endovascular 
Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) surgery. The surgical assessment 
is done at the pre-surgical polyclinic, where a nurse, a 
surgeon, an anaesthesiologist, consults the patient. The 
surgeon present in the pre-surgical polyclinic ideally also 
performs the surgery. After the surgery is performed, the 
patient is transferred to the recovery unit for observation, 
and subsequently moved to the ward for care. The patients 
often go through several days of convalescence before going 
home. Throughout the course of the patient trajectory, 
several communicative practices occur both orally and 
written, such as the doctor-patient conversations, the 
professional conversations in one-to-one relationship or 
team, as well as written referrals, information circulars, 
notes, patient orientation, discharge summaries, and 
electronic patient records and health information systems. 
This identification of the activity types in the ideal patient 
trajectory was useful in order to understand the complexity 
of when health communication and information exchange 
occurs during the patient trajectory. However, as we shall 
see in the subsequent section, the chain of activity types is 
even more complex. 
The fieldwork of this study starts when the patient 
presents at the hospital for a pre-surgical polyclinic 
consultation. The patient trajectories of OR surgery differ 
from those during an EVAR surgery, due to differences in 
participant structure and types of communicative practices.  
 
a) Participants in the different activity types 
The participant structure [15] refers to how the 
organization of interaction in large group work, small group 
work, pair work or individual work. The distinction is 
relevant for how we evaluate the social interaction and the 
distribution of verbal contributions during the activity. One 
activity type, for example the surgical intervention, would 
have different participants and thus another participant 
structure than other activity types, for example the 
consultation between the doctor and the patient. The 
accepted norms, roles and verbal contributions are related to 
the participant structure. An identification of the participant 
structure in the respective activity types requires an 
identification of the participants in the activity types.   
The observation of the OR versus EVAR-patients 
showed several participants in each of the phases of the 
patient trajectory respectively pre-surgery, surgery and post-
surgery.

The basic crew in the pre-surgical activity types for

receives the patient in the vascular surgery ward, and who 
forwards him to the blood test department, where he 
communicates with the blood test nurse. When the patient 
returns to the ward, he is called in for consultations with 
respectively a nurse (who takes personal information notes 
for the record), a surgeon who explains briefly what will 
happen during surgery and an anaesthesiologist (who 
considers allergies, medicines and explains about the 
aesthetic procedure.)  The pre-surgery activity types for the

OR surgery include the physiotherapist, while the pre-
surgery activity types specific for the EVAR surgery may 
include a consultation with the radiologist. 
Additional professionals in the pre-surgery activity 
types are the students training to be doctors or nurses. All 
these 
activity 
types 
include 
different 
kinds 
of 
communicative practices, such as talk, reading electronic 
patient record, writing in electronic patient record and 
occasionally also referring to medical imaging or simple 
drawings to illustrate the medical condition.

In addition to the basic crew, the EVAR surgery 
involves a radiologist and two radiologist nurses. The 
surgery activity type is a complex interdisciplinary team 
communication, and a large number of communicative 
practices are involved, such as talk across professional 
boundaries, reading and writing diagnostic information and 
observations in different databases (according to the 
professional task, for example the anaesthesiologist registers 
in one database, whereas the surgeon registers in another 
and the nurses in the third database).

The post-surgery crew concerned with the patient after 
the OR consist of several health care professionals, both in 
the intensive care unit, the recovery unit and in the ward. 
Since the patient usually is in the ward for several days post-
surgery, he experiences the change of guards as the 
surveillance crew and the ward crew change 3 times in 24 
hours. 
Table 2, 3 and 4 illustrate that the chain of activity 
types is actually more complex than identified in the pilot 
project (see section A), and that a large number of 
healthcare professionals are involved during both the OR 
and the EVAR patient trajectories.  
 
b) Identifying communicative practices 
The communicative practices referred to here are the 
different types of interactional activities, be they verbal or 
written that concern the patients.  
The communicative practices have different 
characteristics: 1) where the patient is explicitly involved, 2) 
between healthcare professionals within the department 3) 
healthcare professionals within the department and “satellite 
professionals”, 
such 
as 
the 
anaesthesiologist, 
the 
physiotherapist, etc., and 4) healthcare professionals across 
departments (surgery, recovery, and ward). 
 
Pre-surgery 
Based on our observations, we have identified 
numerous communicative practices in pre surgery.

In the pre surgery phase, numerous communicative 
practices take place concerning the patient. The patient is 
involved in consultations, and will be able to influence the 
communication, 
through 
questions 
and 
information. 
Moreover, there are communicative practices where the 
patient is not involved, and where information is exchanged, 
discussed and decisions are being made about the patient.

During surgery of OR, the patient receives full 
anesthesia. He is unconscious, and is only involved in talk 
before going into anesthesia and after wakening post-
surgery. Contrarily, during EVAR, the anesthetic is local, 
and the patient is involved in talk. The nurses, surgeons and 
radiologists can communicate with the patient, and the 
patient is an eavesdropper to the professional talk.

In the post-surgery phase, the patients that have 
undergone OR wake up, and are immediately drawn into 
communication with the anesthetics doctors and nurses for 
them to check his state of consciousness. In the intensive 
care, the patients are tired, but are still approached 
communicatively by the nurses, the surgeon and the 
intensive care doctor with information about the operation. 
Reports where given from patients that did not understand 
any of the communication in the intensive care due to 
drowsiness. 
Table 5, 6 and 7 give an indication of the communicative 
practices in the respective patient trajectories. There is a 
large number of communicative practices during the 
trajectory, be they verbal practices (talk) of written practices 
(ICT or paper based), each with different characteristics.

DISCUSSION 
The identification of the chain of activity types in a 
typical patient trajectory enables us to get an overview of all 
the activities that concern the patient during his stay at the 
hospital. In this paper we saw that a patient trajectory in 
AAA from identification of symptoms (Figure 1) only gives 
a very general overview of the activities that will concern 
the patient that has to go through the surgery. A narrow look 
at the activity types taking place at the hospital between 
admission and discharge from the hospital, illustrates that 
the patient takes part in many activities, with a lot of 
participants with different tasks who are communicating in 
different ways and with the use of different tools.  
The identification of the participants in the different 
activity types gives an idea of the social organisation, work 
tasks, norms and roles in the activity types while the 
identification of the communicative practices in the activity 
types helps us to pinpoint how information is transferred 
from one participant to the next in the trajectory. 
Information is likely to be missed and misunderstood during 
such a chain of complex communicative practices. In 
addition, the complexity of participants and communicative 
practises is likely to influence the patient’s possibility for 
informed decision making, as she has not access to all 
information.  The mapping of the complexity of health 
communication and information exchange in the patient 
trajectory suggests that patient involvement and decision 
making, as emphasised in the user centred perspective, and 
manifested by the for example the slogan No decision about 
me, without me!, may be difficult to obtain. 
Identifying these three structural elements (activity type, 
participants and communicative practices) in actual patient 
trajectories can be useful both from a patient centred-, a 
clinical- and an administrative perspective.   
In general, the identification of these elements is useful 
for pinpointing where and when communicative challenges 
may and do occur between patients and healthcare 
professionals or between healthcare professionals of 
different disciplines. From an administrative level, an 
identification 
of 
activity 
types, 
participants 
and 
communicative practices are tools for making the trajectory 
more efficient.  
Once the structural elements are identified, we can study 
the activity more closely, by analysing how and what the 
participants are communicating about. In the two following 
papers, the focus will be on respectively interactional 
mapping and thematic mapping of selected activity types in 
the AAA patient trajectory.
