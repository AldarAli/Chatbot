Abstract—The re-perimeterization and the erosion of trust
boundaries already happening in organizations is ampliﬁed and
accelerated by Cloud Computing. Security controls in Cloud
Computing are, for the most part, no different from security
controls in any IT environment from a functional perspective.
However, because of the Cloud service models employed, the
operational models, and the technologies used to enable Cloud
services, Cloud Computing may present different risks and
additional requirements to an organization than traditional IT
solutions. This paper focuses on security management issues
for vertical and horizontal Collaborative Clouds. Based on a
detailed and comprehensive analysis of requirement domains,
currently offered solutions, security management objects that
have to be managed, integrated or adopted, we introduce
a Cloud Security Management Reference Model (CSMRM),
integrating various Cloud security services of an organization
and providing interoperability to identiﬁed stakeholders. This
new model adopts the Security Management Infrastructure
(SMI) approach and establishes the basis for a global and
consistent management of the Cloud security infrastructure
according to organizational goals.

ive Clouds, Cloud Security Management Reference Model
I. INTRODUCTION
Today, every new trend in the Information Technology
(IT) has to face issues about security. Most current Cloud
offerings are all over the map on the security issue, ranging
from largely insecure installations for some commodity and
private Cloud offerings to about half of the way towards
meeting that goal for the best enterprise public Clouds [1].
One of the most important security challenges is to assure a
predeﬁned security level of trust over multi-provider Cloud
Computing environments with dedicated communication
infrastructures, security mechanisms, processes and policies
[2]. Thus, it is necessary to overcome ‘security islands’
and vendor lock-in. Inadequate security management (in
order to establish trust and prevent risks) can be the show
stopper for ubiquitous Cloud Computing usage, as Cloud
Computing services will multiply and expand faster than the
ability of Cloud Computing consumers to manage or govern
their usage [3]. Ubiquitous connectivity, the amorphous
nature of information interchange, and the ineffectiveness of
traditional static security controls which cannot deal with the
dynamic nature of Cloud services require enhanced security
approaches with regard to Cloud Computing [2], [4].
The aim of Security controls in Cloud Computing is, for
the most part, no different than security controls in any IT
environment from a functional security management perspect-
ive. The Security Management Infrastructure (SMI) approach
of the EU [5], NATO [6], the USA [7], or the UK [8],
includes security management capabilities such as Identity
Management, Privilege Management, Metadata Management,
Policy Management, and Crypto Key Management. These
functional capabilities will be adopted for Cloud Computing
usage [9]. However, the private and public sector needs
an objective about how this new computing paradigm will
impact organizations from a security management perspective,
how it can be used with existing technologies, and the
potential pitfalls of proprietary technologies that can result
in a lock-in effect or limited choice. To overcome this
situation, we present a Cloud Security Management Reference
Model (CSMRM) that allows to manage Cloud security
management services and to integrate Cloud Computing
security management into the (pre-existing) SMI of the whole
organization. This CSMRM addresses further challenges
and bridges the gap between current insufﬁcient Cloud
security management approaches and future Cloud security
management.
This paper is structured as follows: In Section II, we
provide a detailed description of a collaborative scenario
covering all deployment types and delivery models in order
to identify Cloud security management relevant components,
requirements, and interfaces. In Section III, we provide
the results of the requirements analysis, which guides the
evaluation of related work in Section IV and the identiﬁcation
of security management objects in Section V. Finally, we
introduce the CSMRM in Section VI. Section VII summarises
and concludes this paper.
II. SCENARIO
The communication and information infrastructures of
private and public sector organizations that are collabor-
ating according to agreed security policies are shown by
a scenario in this section (visualized in Figure 1). This
infrastructure is controlled and managed traditionally and

includes various security devices, services, and processes
from various manufacturers in order to manage IT security
capabilities. The organization constructs an internal Cloud
Computing infrastructure upon the existing IT infrastructure
using open-source or commodity software that includes the
Cloud Security Management Infrastructure (CSMI).
A single Cloud (e.g., PrC-A2 in Figure 1) comprises Cloud
services (of one or all types) and additional control and
management elements, such as Service Management, Security
Management, Service Catalogue, or Collaboration Service.
These Cloud services can be used by individuals (e.g., the
members of branch A2 within organization A, members of
other organizations or external users), and can be a single
service or comprise other Cloud services in order to provide
the desired functionality.
Services of the same type (SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS) are referred
as horizontal Cloud services. In many instances, Cloud
computing service provider will provide a value-added service
on top of another Cloud provider’s service. For example, if a
SaaS provider needs ﬂexibility, it may be more cost-efﬁcient
to acquire necessary infrastructure from an IaaS provider
rather than building it. These more complex and integrated
services are termed vertical Cloud services.
A private Cloud of an organization A may contain several
Clouds itself (e.g., the Cloud of a branch). The integrated
Clouds of organization A can be deployed on different geo-
graphic locations and organizational branches, subsidiaries,
and units. This Cloud can be seen as a Collaborative Cloud,
even when it is assumed to be a private Cloud from the
perspective of organization A. Note that a private Cloud
service from organization A may consist of several Cloud
services from partners or from a public Cloud service provider.
For example, a Cloud storage service from the private Cloud
(PrC) of organization A may use another Cloud storage
service from PrC-B, together with a storage system of Cloud
PuC-I, a ﬁle system, and a tape storage system of Cloud
PuC-II, in order to provide a new compound Cloud service.
A Collaborative Cloud may also offer Cloud services which
use several other Cloud services, for example an Information
service that interacts with various stakeholders of an inter-
organizational project.
Clouds are connected via Intranet (private) or Internet
(public) connections. In addition, Cloud service brokers—
providers that offer intermediation, monitoring, transforma-
tion, portability, etc. between various cloud providers—can be
used while building compound services. Managers can make
intelligent and ﬂexible decisions about what parts of their
application loads runs internally and what parts externally.
As a rule of thumb, computation-intensive Cloud services
are better provided and used by public Cloud providers, but
as dynamic security policies may deﬁne other risks for the
transferred data, such a Cloud service could be moved and
deployed back into the private Cloud.
III. REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS
This section deﬁnes the requirements for a uniﬁed and
collaborative Cloud security management, based on, but
not limited to, the scenario given in the previous section.
There are several sources [2], [10]–[12] providing questions
with regard to Cloud security management (e.g., ‘How do
I manage and control my security policies along the whole
Cloud Service Life-cycle?’). Based on these questions we
discovered and deﬁned four domains for Cloud security
management requirements to cluster identiﬁed requirements.
These domains are (1) Security Management Functions,
(2) Collaboration, (3) Integration of Security Management
Objects, and (4) General Requirements.
A. Security Management Functions
In a hybrid private and public Cloud scenario there is
a signiﬁcant incremental risk if outsourced services to the
public Cloud bypass the technical and administrativ controls.
Customers are ultimately responsible for the security and
integrity of their own data, even when it is held by a service
provider [13]. Due to this complexity and opacity, policy
enforcement becomes critical at all possible enforcement
points. Since it is difﬁcult to ascertain where data may be
directed to it becomes imperative to encrypt all data, whether
it is in motion or at rest. The biggest question here is key
management (e.g., single key for all users, one key per
user, multiple keys per user, etc.) [14]. The trend toward
multiple service providers has the potential for creating
an identity nightmare unless it is coordinated across all
platforms. Each service will need to identify the user and
may carry a number of user attributes including preferences
and history. Federated identity solutions are necessary for
service providers to standardize on mechanisms for sharing
authentication, authorization and access (AAA) information
with each other.
B. Collaboration
Collaborative Clouds are built upon private and public
Clouds of various organizations. The following aspects
are presented to highlight the requirement spectrum for
security management. We probably won’t know exactly
where or in which country our information is hosted [13].
In addition, information in the Cloud is typically in a
shared environment alongside data from other customers.
Therefore inter-security management information exchange
is necessary, where Cloud security management applications
of two or more organizations share information. The use of
standardized and non-proprietary protocols to communicate
and exchange information between security capabilities will
support this inter-organizational sharing of information to
prevent vendor lock-in threat, resulting in problems with data
transfer between Cloud vendors [15]. Furthermore distributed
time zones have to be considered in order to support adequate

timestamps (e.g., security auditing). But also from an intra-
organizational perspective security management information
exchange between the Cloud security management system
and the overarching security management system of the whole
organization has to be established in order to fulﬁll security
policies comprehensively.
C. Integration of Security Management Objects
Cloud security management will allow a central operative
management of all security capabilities. Therefore it has to
provide interfaces and APIs in order to integrate all security-
related data stored in the concrete security capabilities
including Web-based ones. This will foster the move from
manual to automated security management operations. The
range of security capabilities that have to be considered by
a security management depends mostly on the degree of
integration and complexity of the provided services by the
Cloud service provider. In the case of SaaS, this means that
service levels, security, governance, compliance, and liability
expectations of the service and provider are contractually
stipulated; managed to; and enforced. In the case of PaaS
or IaaS it is the responsibility of the consumer’s system
administrators to effectively manage the same, with some
offset expected by the provider for securing the underlying
platform and infrastructure components [2]. However to
achieve this integration the adoption of a standards-based
system design and implementation to enable interoperabil-
ity, facilitate federated security management operations is
necessary. This allows the use of commercial products, too.
D. General Requirements
As the number of Cloud services and their potential
security management capabilities can get quite high in
collaborative environments a scalable architecture is required.
Additional ones may need to be conﬁgured if the collabora-
tion grows or if components are replaced dynamically. But
also the set of supported security management capabilities
is not static. Continuously, new types of these capabilities
evolve and manufacturers are extending their Cloud portfolio.
In addition there is the need to operate in a multi-national
or multi-cultural environment. Therefore the design and
development of the system have to meet the requirements of
a speciﬁc geographic or linguistic market segment.
IV. RELATED WORK
The following section is structured into two parts. First
we provide some theoretical foundations concerning security
management models and cloud security areas. Secondly, we
present an overview of current Cloud security management
approaches and exchange standards.
The FCAPS model (ISO 10164) describes security man-
agement functions generically as goals in order to be imple-
mented by security management tools. While the ISO/IEC
27001 offers a methodology and implementation guideline
for providing and managing security services. [16] presents
a Service Oriented Security Architecture (SOSA) as a col-
lection of security services forming a security infrastructure
used by Web Service providers. The Security Management
Infrastructure approach, also known as Enterprise Security
Management (ESM) will serve as an overarching security
architecture integrating security capabilities (e.g., Identity,

Credential, Crypto Key Management, etc.) and managing
them according to an organizational security policy [9].
There are several sources that describe Cloud Computing
security areas [2], [14], [12], [1]. Unfortunately they differ
in deﬁning and covering necessary security management
functional areas and collaboration aspects that can be used for
a comprehensive Cloud security management. For example
the management of meta-data or conﬁguration management
of security capabilities are not covered. Mainly they focus
only to Identity, Privilege, Access and Crypto Key Man-
agement. The adaption and reuse of existing, traditional
security management applications for Cloud Computing is
proposed as one way-ahead [12]. A detailed summarization
of fundamental characteristics and shortcomings of 14 of
these security management systems are shown in Figure 2,
which compares along a list of 5 design and 9 functional
criteria c.q. requirements, indicates that neither of the
observed approaches addresses the required range of security
management functions, nor do they provide mechanisms for
composed Cloud services [17].
Unfortunately only few applications c.q. models that
focus unique to the Cloud security management aspect like
Zscaler, Panda and the security management model [18]
exist. But they only provide single security management
function areas like policy-based secure web access or provides
complete protection services. Furthermore there are services
like PingIdentity, Sympliﬁed, etc. that covers the federated
management of identities. Mostly there are some security
management elements included within Cloud management
applications. For example enStratus provides management for
Amazon and The Rackspace Cloud infrastructure including
security management functions like authentication and au-
thorization, key management and audit. Further examples of
Cloud management services like Scalr, Kaavo, CloudKlick,
CloudStatus, RightScale, Elastra, Enomaly, Cloud42, etc.
exist ( [2], [14], [12]). DeltaCloud is an open source
project aiming to develop an ecosystem of tools, scripts
and applications for the Cloud. The project also aims to
write a common, REST-based API to enable developers
to write once and manage across multiple Clouds. One of
the biggest challenges to Cloud Computing is the lack of
standards as many efforts centred around the development
of both open and proprietary APIs which seek to enable
things such as management, security and interoperability
for Cloud. Some of these efforts include the Open Cloud
Computing Interface, Amazon EC2 API, VMware’s DMTF-
submitted vCloud API, Sun’s Open Cloud API, Rackspace
API, SNIA Cloud Data Management Interface (CDMI) and
GoGrid’s API, to name just a few. Beside these solutions,
there are some standards and approaches for speciﬁc security
areas. For the exchange of authentication and authorization
data, standards as OASIS SAML, speciﬁcations of Liberty
Alliance, and the Web Services Federation Language are
implemented with their main focus on Web-based services.
Furthermore in the security area of crypto key management
the Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) can
be used.
To summarize current Cloud security management ap-
proaches cannot fulﬁll all requirements put forward for an
security management of Collaborative Clouds. The range of
security ﬁelds supported is often limited and none of these
tools are ﬂexible and holistic enough to ensure the required
level of interoperability and ﬂexibility by implementing the
presented Cloud standards.
V. CLOUD SECURITY MANAGEMENT OBJECTS
There are signiﬁcant trade-offs to each Cloud model
in terms of integrated features, complexity vs. openness
(extensibility), and security. The key takeaway for security
management is that the lower down the stack the Cloud
service provider stops, the more security capabilities and
management consumers are responsible for implementing
and managing themselves. However, there is still the question,
what are the ‘target objects’ that have to be managed within
the CSMI. In this section three domains for these objects
are introduced that have to be addressed by a Cloud security
management system.
A. Security functions provided by Cloud service providers
Various Cloud service providers add security functions cov-
ering also some parts of Cloud security management to their
proprietary Cloud service offerings. For example Amazon
Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Security supported
a multi-factor authentication (knowledge and ownership) to
gain access, control privileges and supporting of credentials
like X.509 Certiﬁcate or proprietary Amazon Secret Access
Key (e.g., to sign API calls). A key management allows
the multiple concurrent usage of these certiﬁcates and keys.
Beside that the access is logged and audited. Furthermore
ﬂexibility to place instances within multiple geographic
regions as well as across multiple availability zones is
possible, however the choice (e.g., region, continent) is
limited [19].
B. Cloud security management services
PingFederate is a Cloud-based Identity-as-a-Service pro-
vider that focus in federating identity management and is
integrated by a provider speciﬁc API. These kind of Cloud
services can be classiﬁed as SaaS. The IdP (Identity Provider)
sending identity attributes (from an authentication service
or application) to PingFederate. PingFederate uses those
identity attributes to generate a SAML assertion. PingFederate
extracts the identity attributes from the incoming SAML
assertion and sends them to the target application of a service
provider as consumer of identity attributes. Initial user au-
thentication is normally handled outside of the PingFederate.
PingFederate offers integration kits (Windows IWA/NTLM,
X.509 Certiﬁcate, LDAP Authentication Service), that access

provides the access identity attributes or provided integration
kits for CA SiteMinder, Oracle Access Manager (COREid)
and Tivoli Access Manager. PingFederate allows a service
provider enterprise to accept SAML assertions and provide
single-sign-on to applications for Citrix, SharePoint and
Salesforce.com [14], [20].
C. Security management objects within interfaces
Interfaces and APIs, for Cloud portability and interoperab-
ility, include management and security issues. For example,
security in the context of Cloud Data Management Interface
(CDMI) refers to the protective measures employed in
managing and accessing data and storage. CDMI can be
accessed by protocols like SAN, NAS, FTP, WebDAV or
REST. Security management measures within CDMI can be
summarized as user and entity authentication, authorization
and access controls, data integrity, data at-rest encryption,
crypto key management, audit and meta-data management
[21]. Some of these security management attributes are
cdmi_security_audit (If present and ‘true’, the cloud storage
system supports audit logging), cdmi_security_data_integrity
(If present and ‘true’, the cloud storage system supports data
integrity/authenticity) or cdmi_security_encryption (If present
and ‘true’, the cloud storage system supports data at-rest
Encryption).
VI. CLOUD SECURITY MANAGEMENT REFERENCE
MODEL
In this section an reference model for Cloud security
management is presented based on the detailed require-
ment analysis and the Cloud security managed objects.
The CSMRM, which is shown in Figure 3, will serve
as a comprehensive guideline in order to implement and
design Cloud security management systems that address the
highlighted security spectrum.
Within the requirement analysis we identiﬁed four domains
in order to cover the range of requirements and functions
for security management. Consequently the CSMRM con-
sists of four interoperating layers - Adapter and Libraries
Layer, Platform Service Layer, Functional Service Layer,
and Collaboration Service Layer. The CSMRM adopts a
standards-based system design and implementation that en-
able interoperability, facilitate federated security management
operations, allow the use of commercial products and ease
evolution. Therefore, it includes 5 domains of interfaces
and APIs for the Collaborative Cloud environment. Here a
Cloud security management system has to interact with (1)
the Security Management Infrastructure of the organization,
(2) the security managed objects, (3) other Cloud security

management systems (e.g., Cloud Broker, partners, public
Cloud providers), (4) Cloud Service User, and (5) Cloud
security roles within the organization (e.g., administrator,
security ofﬁcer, etc.). The lowest layer is called Adapter
and Libraries Layer, which integrates and accesses various
Cloud security management objects. These objects differ in
two dimensions: First, how a the object is interfaced with.
Each one may have its own protocol for communication
(e.g., LDAP, proprietary APIs, or Simple Object Access
Protocol (SOAP) in case of a Web Service). Second, the
function a concrete object provides. The requirement to
map all these different protocols and function sets to a
Cloud security management system bears therefore a high
degree of complexity. The proposed solution is abstraction
and service decomposition, as the Adapter and Libraries
Layer consists of different types of adapters and libraries,
where each type may have a number of security management
object-dependent implementations. Each adapter has two
interfaces: a primitive function interface, which is common
for all adapters of one type, and a object-dependent interface,
which implements the (proprietary) interface of the concrete
security managed objects. If available the adapter type will
be deﬁned and implemented according to standards like
SAML, KMIP, OCCI, or CDMI. Above that the Platform
Service Layer provides basic services to the Cloud security
management system and implements the integration within
the SMI of the organization. For example a Database Service
including backup functionality will serve as the underlying
security management data storage for the future system. For
speciﬁc purposes different database types like structured
and unstructured ones are offered. A Registry Service is
necessary in order to have an overview about all system
components within the Cloud security management system.
Further a Multi-lingual Service allows a user to deﬁne, select,
and change between different culturally-related application
environments to support the usage within Collaborative
Clouds. The Functional Service Layer includes all security
management functional areas like Identity Management,
Privilege Management, Metadata Management, Policy Man-
agement and Crypto Key Management. These services
comprise all elements of their area within one organization. A
Collaboration Service Layer is at the top of the CSMRM that
support the inter-security management information, where
Cloud security management applications of two or more
organizations share information in Collaborative Clouds.
The use of standardized and non-proprietary protocols to
communicate and exchange information between security
capabilities will support this inter-organizational sharing of
information to prevent vendor lock-in threat. A Security
Policy Service guarantees that regulations and constrains
of the organization are enforced even when the combined
Cloud service respective security data is distributed and
located at various geographic units within the collaboration.
In addition a Topology and Localisation Service provides an
up-to-date view of the orchestrated collaborative environment,
that supports other services of that layer. Underlying to these
is a Synchronization Service that allow the exchange and
transaction between various technologies and timezones.

VII. CONCLUSION
Identifying and deﬁning security management issues for
Cloud Computing are challenging tasks. Though inadequate
security management in order to establish trust and preventing
risks can be the show stopper for ubiquitous Cloud usage
as Cloud services will multiply and expand faster than
the ability of Cloud consumers to manage or govern them
in use. Ubiquitous connectivity, the amorphous nature of
information interchange, and the ineffectiveness of tradi-
tional static security controls which cannot deal with the
dynamic nature of Cloud services, all require new security
thinking with regard to Cloud Computing in the context of
Collaborative Clouds. However an objective about how this
new computing paradigm will impact organizations from a
security management perspective, or how it can be used with
existing technologies, and the potential pitfalls of proprietary
technologies that can lead to lock-in and limited choice, is
needed. To overcome this situation we presented a Cloud
Security Management Reference Model that enables potential
users to manage various horizontal and vertical Cloud security
services independent of their complexity. The adapter and
library layer allows the integration and clustering according
SMI functions that guarantees a comprehensive coverage
of all security management aspects. Furthermore it support
the collaboration with Cloud service users and other Clouds.
Due to the fact that such a comprehensive Cloud security
management model does not exists yet, it will serve as a
guideline to design and implement future Cloud security
management systems.
