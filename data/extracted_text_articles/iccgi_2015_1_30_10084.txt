Abstract—In this paper, we present an innovative idea to build 
a software system that allows detecting and locating fiber cuts 
in Passive Optical Networks (PON) prior to the incident being 
reported by the customer to the provider’ helpdesk. This early 
detection helps reduce the service restoration time and the 
number of customer service repair claims.  
Keywords- PON; OTDR; Fiber cut.  
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The idea presented in this paper aims at detecting fiber 
cuts in advance, accelerating failure resolution, minimizing 
impacts on the service provision and reducing the number of 
claims from end customers in a PON [1][2]. We propose to 
design a software system that generates location information 
automatically in case a fiber cut occurs. At present, if this 
happens, users contact the provider’s helpdesk, the 
technicians test the PON in order to find the failure point, 
and solve the problem on-site. The novelty of this research 
lies in expecting to detect  the fiber cuts before the user’s 
claim occurs, which allows reducing the elapsed time until 
the problem is solved and improving the customers’  
perception. 
There are works present in the literature that address 
techniques used to monitor PONs. In [3], Hasegawa et al. 
propose pulse-Optical Coherence Domain Reflectometry 
(pulse-OCDR) as a new monitoring method for PONs. The 
work presents the results of a laboratory demonstration, 
where reflections from the Fiber Bragg Gratting (FBG) 
filters installed at the end of drop fibers in a 32-branch PON 
with a 15 km feeder line are identified with 2.6 cm spatial 
resolution, and a fault in drop fibers is detected as the 
absence of one FBG reflection. Although the location of a 
fault is not implemented because the used OCDR does not 
detect Rayleigh scattering [4] from the drop fibers, fault 
detection alone is valuable because it can tell whether the 
fault is in fiber or in the Optical Network Terminal (ONT) 
and hence reduces the number of times service personnel is 
dispatched on troubleshooting. In [4], Costa et al. propose a 
strategy to monitor the fiber plant failures by implementing 
an Optical Time Domain Reflectometer (OTDR) subsystem 
in the physical layer. The procedure is evaluated analyzing 
its theoretical performance limits. 
Our technical solution suggests storing the signal that is 
reflected back from several points along the fiber in the 
OTDR to check later against a blueprint when a fiber cut 
arises. The analysis will allow to detect the cut location and 
to identify those customers who are impacted by the network 
failure. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 
characterizes the Passive Optical Networks (PON), in 
Section 3 the Optical Time Domain Reflectometer (OTDR) 
is described, in Section 4 the method of analysis is presented, 
and finally in Section 5 we end with some conclusions.

PASSIVE OPTICAL NETWORK 
A PON [1][2] is a telecommunications network that 
employs point-to-multipoint fiber to the premises in which 
unpowered optical splitters are employed to make possible a 
single optical fiber to serve multiple premises. A PON 
includes an Optical Line Terminal (OLT) at the service 
provider's central office and a number of Optical Network 
Units (ONU) close to end customers. A PON minimize the 
amount of fiber and central office equipment required 
compared 
with 
point-to-point 
architectures.

technologies: Broadband Optical System Based on a Passive 
Optical Network (BPON) [6][7][8], Ethernet-Passive-
Optical-Network (EPON) [9] and Gigabit Passive Optical 
Network (GPON)  [10][11][12][13] are compared in Table

OPTICAL  TIME  DOMAIN  REFLECTOMETER 
An OTDR is used to test PON, combining a laser source 
and a high resolution detector to give an inside view of the 
optical link. This device is connected to the end of the link, 
the laser source injects a signal into the fiber and the detector

receives the light reflected from the different connection 
elements. 
The 
main 
OTDR 
features 
are: 
working 
wavelength, pulse duration, maximum measured distance, 
resolution (attenuation or distance), difference between the 
largest and the smallest value of pulse that can be measured, 
linearity, i.e., error resulting from nonlinearity ranges over 
the measured attenuation. 
IV. 
ALGORITHM 
Information about the signal that is reflected back from 
several points along the fiber wire can be stored by the 
OTDR to check later against a blueprint when a fiber cut 
arises. The inspection will allow to detect the cut location 
and  to identify those users who are impacted by the 
network trouble. A scan should be performed over all 
network branches that come from the provider’s central 
office in order to detect the failures before users perceive 
them.  We propose a software system  (test  bed), which 
includes the following elements: 
 
A Personal Computer (PC). 
 
 MatLab Tool. 
 
Algorithm implemented in  MatLab Language.  
 
An OTDR, with functionality to dump data  in a  
format file, which should be understood by 
MatLab. 
An overview of the operation and the procedures carried out 
by the algorithm are shown in the following sections. 
A. Main Tasks 
Figure 1 summarizes the main actions that are taken by the 
algorithm. 
Figure 1.  Main Flow Chart. 
B. Inspection of time displacements 
This procedure detects fluctuations of the signal values 
collected by the OTDR due to errors in the capture 
(specifically, time displacement errors). The input signal to 
this algorithm, Sa (t), is moved in a range D, –x/2≤D≤x/2, 
where x is the window size chosen by the user. Several 
magnitudes are calculated: 
 
Sr(t)=Si(t)–Sa(t+D), D in [-x/2, x/2] 
(1) 
Average(Sr(t)) 
(2) 
 
The output  will be that signal Sfa(t)= Sa(t+D) with the 
lowest Average (Sr(t)).  
Figure 2, shows the obtained  averages for one imaginary 
Sr(t) with x=10.

C. Inspection of amplitude variations 
This process identifies fluctuations of the signal values 
collected by the OTDR due to errors in the capture 
(specifically, amplitude variation errors). 
The input signal to this procedure, Sa(t),  is moved in a 
range AR, –A/2≤AR≤A/2,  where A is the window size 
chosen  by the user.  
 
Sr(t)=Si (t)–(Sa(t)+AR), AR in [-A/2, A/2] 
Average(Sr(t)) 
(3) 
 
The output will be that signal, Sfa(t)=Sa(t)+ AR, with the 
lowest Average (Sr(t)).  
 
D. Elimination of noise component 
Due to the noise generated in the optical fiber, the signal 
injected by the OTDR laser source can change significantly 
until that it is finally captured by the OTDR detector. This 
procedure eliminates this noise component.  
1. In the first step, the slope of the input signal, S(t), is 
calculated. The following parameters are defined: 
 
NS: Number of samples of the S(t), which contain 
all  useful information. 
 
W : Window size, which is selected by the user. 
 
NW = Total windows (of size W) that are required 
to include all samples. 
 
AHMP = Sfa (tHMP), tHMP  is the amplitude middle 
point  includes in the  highest window (over the 
total number, NW). 
 
ALMP = Sfa (tLMP),  tLMP is the amplitude middle 
point in the lowest window (over the total number, 
NW). 
 
M = (AHMP –ALMP)/NS 
 
2. In the second step,  Y(t) = M*t and RS (t) = 2 * (S(t) – 
Y(t)) are calculated. Figure 3 shows the RS (t) 
corresponding to one imaginary signal S (t). 
3. In the third step, several filters are applied,  which 
allow displaying even clearly the peaks in RS(t).

(Mininum(RS(t)))

E. Calculation of results 
1. In the first step, this procedure identifies the reflection 
occurrence,  calculating : 
 
If  RS(t) > 0  RS(t)• = 1 (8) 
 
Figure 4 (Right) shows RS (t)• for one signal imaginary 
RS(t). 
 
CSfaSi (t) = RSSfa(t)• – RSSi(t)• 
(9) 
 
∆t where CSfaSi (t)  < 0, t corresponds to the place where a cut 
happens.  ∆t where CSfaSi (t)  > 0, t refers to the location 
where the signal is not received due to a cut. Figure 5 shows 
one imaginary CSfaSi(t) with two peaks (one positive ( t= 88) 
and other negative ( t=66)). 
2. In the second step, this procedure calculates to the 
provider's central office until the place where the cut 
occurs, that is: 
 
Distance(Km)=(((Speed of light)*t (∆t where CSfaSi 
(t)<0)*10-6)/2*RI)/1000 
(10) 
 
RI: Refraction Index 
Speed of light: 3*108 m/second

3. In the third step, the specific branch impacted by the cut 
is identified. The algorithm assumes a PON composes 
of L levels and B braches. L and B are data provide by 
the user. 
a. 
Those values ti where RSSi(ti) = 1 are stored in a 
vector V = {vj}; vj=ti ; j € N. So, for the imaginary 
signal displayed in Figure 5, V ={6, 27, 40, 48, 51, 
54, 80, 84, 88, 110, 114, 133, 139, 146,  148}. 
b. Each value ti where CSfaSi (ti)  > 0 is searched in V, 
and its position j is deduced. So, for the imaginary 
signal depicted in the Figure 5 the value 88 is in  j= 
9. 
c. 
 A matrix A {alk} l<=L; k<=B, where each alk 
represents the element position in the PON, is built. 
The row and column denote the level and the 
branch where the device is located,  respectively.

Figure 6 shows an imaginary network (in upper part) and its 
matrix A (in the lower part).

the network on the upper. 
 
d. Those alk that are equal to the positions calculated 
in step a, identify the not-reachable devices. 
Therefore, the cut must have happened in some 
preceding section in the PON. So, in the example 
shown in Figure 7, the not-reachable device is in 
the level 4 and the branch 6, given that a46 = 9. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS 
We have proposed a software system which executes an 
algorithm to detect and to provide information on the fiber 
cuts in a PON. Our future works will investigate deeper the 
method effectiveness (practicality per Signal Noise Rate 
(SNR)) testing several real scenarios.
