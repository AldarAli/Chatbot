Abstract—In this paper, we study the effect of the spatial
correlation between multiple antennas on the performance of the
MIMO systems in ﬂat fading channels. As performances metrics,
the Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) are
investigated for Orthogonal Space Time Block Coding (OSTBC)
and Vertical Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time code (V-
BLAST) architecture respectively. It is assumed that all antennas
have the same radiation pattern and the spatial correlation is
independent of the position of an antenna in the array. In this
investigation, it is assumed that the correlation matrix of the
MIMO channel is the Kronecker product of the receive and
transmit correlation matrices. The desired correlated channel
is obtained by the Cholesky decomposition of the correlation
matrix.

I. INTRODUCTION
Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems are those
that have multiple antenna at both transmitter and receiver.
They were ﬁrst investigated by computer simulation in the
1980s, and later papers explored them analytically. Since
that time, interest in MIMO systems has exploded. Multiple
antennas can be used for increasing capacity or for increasing
diversity. To improve the diversity in a MIMO system, the
Orthogonal Space Time Block Coding are used [10]. On the
other hand, to improve the capacity, independent data streams
are transmitted simultaneously from multiple antennas [2].
The Vertical Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time code (V-
BLAST) is an architecture for realizing very high data rates
over the rich scattering wireless channel [3]. The detection
algorithms for V-BLAST architecture are traditionally based
on the Order Successive Interference Cancellation (OSIC) [4].
The V-BLAST OSIC algorithm is an iterative algorithm where
the the strongest signal is decoded ﬁrst, then the effect of this
strongest signal is cancelled from each of the received signals
[8]. The correlation at the receiver and the transmitter side can
considerably reduce the performance of the MIMO systems. It
is important to quantify the effect of the correlation to properly
design MIMO systems [12]. In [5], the BER expressions of
optimum combining and maximal ratio combining in the pres-
ence of one co-channel interferer was derived. In [6], the effect
of transmission design and spatial correlation on the symbol
error rate (SER) was analyzed for MIMO communication
systems. While most previous work considered the analysis
for OSTBC and V-BLAST with separately correlation model,
this work considers the effect of the channel correlation using
the jointly-correlated model. With this approach an analytical
solution can be derived for the BER and SER performances.
When all the antennas in the MIMO systems have the same
radiation pattern, which is the case in almost the practical
cases, and when the spatial correlation is independent of the
position of an antenna in the array, it is shown in [1] that the
(4x4) MIMO correlation matrix can be approximated by the
Kronecker product of the transmitter correlation matrix and
the receiver correlation matrix.
In this paper, the BER and the SER of the OSTBC and
OSIC V-BLAST, respectively, are investigated with respect
to the spatial correlation effect. The kronecker model of the
correlated channel and the Cholesky decomposition of the
cross-correlated matrix are considered for the study.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, we present the system model and give a brief review
of the detection algorithm of OSIC. A brief description of
the OSTBC is also reviewed in this section. In Section III,
we present the correlation model. The simulation results and
discussion of results will be presented in Section IV. Finally,
we conclude our paper in Section V.
II. SYSTEM AND CHANNEL MODEL
We consider a narrow band MIMO wireless communication
system with 2 transmit antennas and 2 receive antennas. It is
assumed that the channel experiences quasi-static ﬂat Rayleigh
fading. We also assume that CSI is known at the receiver.
For the OSTBC, at each time the two transmit antennas send

Alamouti coded blocks [10] and two receive antennas are used
to receive the encoded transmitted block. Let H = [hi,j]
denote the 2x2 MIMO channel matrix where hi,j is the
fading coefﬁcient between transmit j and receive antenna i,
j = 1, 2, i = 1, 2. hi,j is a sample of independent complex
Gaussian random variables with zero mean and variance 1/2
per dimension. For decoding purposes, a 2x2 matrix H is used
to denote the channel between the two transmit and two receive
antennas. The complex envelope of the received signal at the
antenna array after matching ﬁlter is given by [2]:
y = Hx + n
(1)
where y represent a two dimensional received signal, n is a 2
dimensional complex additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
vector, of which each component is statistically independent
and has zero mean and a variance σ2/2 per dimension, x a
two dimensional of transmitted signal and H is a 2x2 MIMO
fading channel [11]:
H =

To introduce the correlation effect in the system model, a
correlated matrix should be generated according to [7]
vec(Hc) = R1/2

where Hc represent the correlated matrix of the MIMO
channel and is given by [7]:
Hc =

(4)
The correlation matrix of the MIMO channel, RMIMO, is
obtained by the Kronecker product of the transmit and receive
correlation matrices as follow [11]:
RMIMO = RMS ⊗ RBS
(5)
Using the properties of the Kronecker product the model of
(2) is simpliﬁed to the form [7]:
Hc = R1/2
MS H (R1/2

The correlation matrices of the transmitter and the receiver
are given by [11]:

III. V-BLAST OSIC DETECTION ALGORITHM
The simple transmission and detection mechanism of the V-
BLAST and its ability to achieve a high data rate performances
have made the technic a popular solution for signal processing.
In this section, we brieﬂy describe the V-BLAST OSIC
algorithm. Letting x = [x1, x2]T represent the vector of the
transmitted symbols, then the corresponding received vector
is given by [9]:
y1 = Hcx + n
(12)
In the above equation, x and y1 are two vectors of transmit-
ted and received signals respectively. To be able to detect the
different stream send by the transmitter, an iterative process in
which stream by stream detection is necessary. In other words,
the detection process should be performed on one stream at
time. This process is based on the linear combinatorial nulling
72

on the received vector and an operation of cancelling the
obtained symbol operation is followed [9]. The process should
have the following steps:
In a ﬁrst step, the received vector, y1, should be multiplied
by a nulling vector, wk1 to obtain the quantity yk1 [9]:
yk1 = wT
k1y1
(13)
In the next step, yk1 is sliced using the quantization, Q(.),
operation appropriate to the the constellation in use and the
ak1 is obtained [9]:
ak1 = Q(yk1)
(14)
Finally, a modiﬁed received vector y2 is obtained by can-
celling ak1 from the received vector y1, resulting [9]:
y2 = y1 − ak1(Hc)k1
(15)
where (Hc)k1 represents the k1th column of Hc. The
previous steps are then performed on the modiﬁed received
vector y2 to detect the following symbol. The process should
be stopped until all symbols are detected.
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, we illustrate the results of the effect of
spatial correlation of MIMO channel on the performances
of V-BLAST and OSTBC MIMO architecture. The Monte-
Carlo simulations are used to obtain the results. In V-BLAST
architecture, a frame of 100 symbols is transmitted over
the MIMO channel. The channel is represented by a 2x2
matrix with correlated elements. The performances of the non
linear detection are obtained for 5000 iterations. The detected
symbols at the output of the receiver are compared with the
ones transmitted from the transmitter side so that the SER
is calculated. The results of the simulations are represented
in the Fig. 1. In this ﬁgure, the curve which correspond to
zero correlation is identical to the litterature results [2]. From
theses results it is shown that the correlation between sub
channels degrade considerably the performances of V-BLAST
architecture. In fact, for a ﬁxed SNR of 15 dB, the SER of
ρ = 0.8 is much important than the one of ρ = 0.7. For
a ﬁxed value of correlation, say ρ = 0.4, the SER decrease
when the value of the signal to noise ratio is increased. We
also notice that for ρ = 0.999, the SER is almost constant

fact that with strong correlation, the algorithm become less
efﬁcient and hence the importance of the spatial correlation on
the hole performances. For the performances of the OSTBC,
the results are presented in the Fig. 2. The one rate Alamouti
code and BPSK modulation with real constellation were used
for the simulations [10]. In the simulation, a random 2x2
MIMO channel Matrix is generated. The results show also
that the strong correlation decrease considerably the BER
performances of the OSTBC.

V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we investigated the effect of the spatial corre-
lation on the performances of two MIMO architectures known
as the V-BLAST and OSTBC. The Kronecker model for the
MIMO chanel combining with Cholesky decompossition were
used to the simulation. The BER and the SER are used as
performances metrics for the study. The results shows clearly
that the correlation decrease considerably the performances of
the MIMO systems.
