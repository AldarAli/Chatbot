Abstract—Organizations
have
interest
in
research
collaboration efforts that involve data sharing with peers.
However, such partnerships often come with confidentiality
risks that could involve insider attacks and untrustworthy
collaborators
who
might
leak
sensitive
information.
To
mitigate such data sharing
vulnerabilities, entities share
privatized data with retracted sensitive information. However,
while such data sets might offer some assurances of privacy,
maintaining the statistical traits of the original data, is often
problematic, leading to poor data usability. Therefore, in this
paper, a confidential synthetic data generation heuristic, that
employs
a
combination
of
data
privacy
and
distance
transforms techniques, is presented. The heuristic is used for
the generation of privatized numeric synthetic data, while
preserving the statistical traits of the original data. Empirical
results from applying unsupervised learning, using k-means, to
test the usability of the privatized synthetic data set, are
presented. Preliminary results from this implementation show
that it might be possible to generate privatized synthetic data
sets, with the same statistical morphological structure as the
original, using data privacy and distance transforms methods.

INTRODUCTION
Research
collaboration
among
organizations
often
involves the sharing of data, however, the issue of data
confidentiality is often an impediment in such partnerships.
To safely engage in joint research ventures, entities often
retract sensitive and private information from the shared
data,
which
reduces
usability,
despite
confidentiality
assurances. Yet still, another method used to address such
data
sharing
vulnerabilities,
is
to
generate
privatized
synthetic data sets that retain the statistical traits of the
original data while at the same time ensuring privacy. In this
paper, we present a confidential synthetic data generation
heuristic, that employs data privacy and distance transforms
methods, for the generation of privatized synthetic data while
maintaining some of the statistical traits of the original data.
In the initial stage, we apply distance transforms to extract
the coefficients with the needed traits, from the original data
(noisy data in this case), we then add the coefficients to a
noisy data set, generating a privatized synthetic data set.
Filtering is then applied to the privatized synthetic data set,
to reduce noise and enhance usability. We then apply
unsupervised learning, using k-means clustering, to test the
usability of the privatized synthetic data set. We present
preliminary results showing that it might be possible to
generate privatized synthetic data sets, with the same
statistical skeletal structure as the original, using distance
transforms. Therefore, the main goal of this investigation is
to employ data privacy, distance transforms, and k-means
clustering
approaches
in
the
production
of
privatized
synthetic data with similar statistical traits as the original
data. The rest of the paper is organized as follows, in Section
II, background and related work is given, while Section III
talks about the methodology. In Section IV, a discussion of
the experiment and results is done, and lastly, in Section V,
the conclusion is given.

BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
Not much work exists on the application of distance
transforms for privatized synthetic data generation. The
technique of distance transforms has largely been used for
applications in the image-processing domain. However, a
look at works by researchers in the signal processing
domain shows that techniques, such as, discrete cosine
transforms, have been proposed for privacy preservation
applications [12][13][14][15]. For instance, Mukherjee,
Chen, and Gangopadhyay (2006) suggested using Fourier-
related transforms, to enhance Euclidean distance-based
algorithms
for
privacy
preservation
in
data
mining
applications [1]. Of the privacy preservations problems that
Mukherjee et al., (2006) observed, was that while data
allocations of the original data could be maintained in the
confidential data set, the space between each data point in
the confidential data set is not kept, which often leads to
diminished cluster outcomes [1]. Moreover, Mukherjee et
al., (2006) noted that one of the benefits of using signal
processing techniques, such as discrete cosine, is that the
Euclidean distance among points in the confidential data set
could be maintained, resulting in improved clustering results
[1].
Distance
transforms:
Distance
transforms,
a
skeletonization process, proposed by Rosenfeld and Pfaltz
(1968), and mainly used in the image processing domain, is
a morphological technique that alters a binary image made
up of object ܱ foreground and object ܱᇱ background pixels
into a resulting skeletal figure in which each object pixel has
an analogous value to the smallest amount of space from the
background object ܱᇱ. Distance transforms can be expressed
using the following formula [2][3][4]:
ܦ(݌)= minimum{݀݅ݏݐܽ݊ܿ݁(݌,ݍ),ݍ∈ܱ}(1)
The symbols ܱ and ܱᇱ represent the object foreground
and
background; ݀݅ݏݐܽ݊ܿ݁(݌,ݍ) represents
the
space

METHODOLOGY
In this investigation, rather than apply discrete cosine
transforms, as in [1], we apply distance transforms on a noisy
data set with very similar traits to the original data. We use
the following implementation phases in the generation of the
privatized synthetic data as illustrated in Figure 1:
•
Phase 1: In the first step of the process, a noisy data set,
instead of the original, is generated so as to add an extra
layer of privacy and make it difficult for reconstruction
attacks. In case of a successful reconstruction attack,
what the adversary gets is the noisy data, assuming no
prior insider knowledge. Data privacy, in this first step,
is
achieved
using
noise
addition
[9],
with
a
distributionߝ~ܰ(ߤ=1,ߪ=0.2)– generating a noisy
data set with similar statistical traits to the original [10].
Figure 1: The Privatized Synthetic Data Generation Process
•
Phase 2: In the second step, Distance transforms is
applied on the noisy data set to extract coefficients.
•
Phase 3: During the third step, the extracted coefficients
are then added to back to the noisy data, generating the
privatized synthetic data.
•
Phase 4: In the fourth step, in order to reduce any excess
noise, the moving average filtering is applied on the
privatized synthetic data.
•
Phase 5: In the fifth step of the process, we apply k-
means clustering using Euclidean distance, to test the
usability
of
the
privatized
synthetic
data
set,
in
comparison with the original data.
•
Phase 6: In the final step, statistical analysis of both the
original and privatized data sets is done, and the
privatized synthetic data is published.
IV.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The Fisher Iris data set used in this experiment,
comprised of 150 data points, five attributes, namely, sepal
length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and class
attribute, with three classes, namely, Setosa, Versicolar, and
Virginica [8]. The plots in Figure 2 illustrate series for the
Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, and Petal width
correspondingly, before and after application of distance
transforms. For each plot, the upper series symbolizes the
privatized synthetic Fisher-Iris data, the middle series
symbolizes the noisy Fisher-Iris data used to generate the
privatized synthetic data, and the lower series in the graph
symbolizes the coefficients extracted using the distance
transforms method. As can be seen in Figure 2 from an
anecdotal viewpoint, the privatized synthetic data series is
an augmented outline of the noisy Fisher-Iris series used in
the
generation
of
the
privatized
synthetic
data.
The
statistical analysis will further give more details that the
statistical
skeletal
structure
of the
original
data
was
maintained in the privatized synthetic data set. In Figure 3
the left sub-plot symbolizes the descriptive statistics of the
original data, while the center sub-plot illustrates the
statistical characteristics of noisy Fisher-Iris data, and the
right sub-plot demonstrates the statistical traits of the
generated privatized synthetic data. As shown in Figure 3
the statistical skeletal structural of the noisy data is
maintained in the privatized synthetic data. For instance, the
mean and median in the privatized synthetic data could be
viewed as an augmentation of the same values in the noisy
data, thus a statistical morphologic and skeletal structure of
the original data. Since we derived the noisy data set by
perturbing the original data, and likewise used distance
transforms to extract coefficients from the noisy data and
then generate the privatized synthetic data, the statistical
skeletal structure of the original data is preserved, in this
case,
some
level
of
augmentation
has
take
place.

For example, the mean values for the Sepal length is
5.834 in the original data, and 6.744 for the noisy data,
with a dissimilarity of about 0.91. On the other hand, the
mean value of 8.078 was registered for the privatized
synthetic data, a dissimilarity of about 1.33 and 2.44,
when
compared
with
the
noisy
and
original
data
respectively. The same statistical skeletal structure of the
original, noisy, and privatized synthetic data sets is shown
in Table 1 describing the descriptive statistics of the data
sets. The same outcome is repeated for the other
descriptive statistics, when comparing the original, noisy,
and privatized synthetic data sets. It could then be argued
that the privatized synthetic data could offer some level of
data usability to researchers since it preserves some of the
statistical characteristics of the original data – in this case,
a statistical morphological and skeletal structure of the
original data is preserved. The covariance results as
shown in Figure 4 and Table 2 for the original, noisy, and
privatized synthetic, vary between 0 and 3. For example,
the Sepal length, Sepal width, and petal width, covariance
varies between 0 and 1, showing a small proclivity for the
data sets to grow together, despite the covariance being
positive, in this case.

However, for the Petal length, covariance registers a value
of 3, indicating a possibility for the Petal length attributes
in the data sets might grow together [9]. Additionally, as
shown in Figure 4 and Table 2 the correlation values
between the original, noisy, and privatized data sets vary
from 0.840 to 0.994, approximately near +1, an indication
of a better linear association and therefore a strong
relationship [9]. For that reason, it could be argued that
for the sake of data usability, the generated privatized
synthetic data set might retain the statistical traits of the
original data.

Clustering
performance:
Additionally,
clustering
analysis was done for the original and privatized synthetic
data sets to further test for usability. Since the Euclidean
distance was used in computing the morphological
transforms of the privatized synthetic data set, Euclidean
distance-based unsupervised learning methods, such as k-
means clustering, could be used in testing for data
usability of the privatized synthetic data sets.
Figure 5. Original data clustering results
Furthermore,
we
put
to
test
the
suggestion
by
Mukherjee et al (2006), that one of the compensations of
employing signal processing methods, such as discrete
cosine, is that the Euclidean distance among points in the
privatized data set could be preserved, with enhanced
clustering outcomes [1][5][6]. In this case, we test to see
if this proposal could hold when using image processing
technique
of
distance
transforms,
as
per
our
implementation. Clustering outcomes of the original
Fisher-Iris data are shown in Figure 5 with the x-axis
symbolizing the three classes – Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolar,
and Iris Virginica; the y-axis symbolizes the number of
clusters generated. K-means with Euclidean distance
algorithm was employed for the clustering test, with k =3.
An anecdotal view point of Figure 5 shows that Iris
Virginica category did not cluster well for the original
data. Yet still, from an anecdotal view, there seems to be
an observable improvement in clustering results for the
privatized synthetic data as shown in Figure 6, with the
exception of the Iris Virginica attribute. However, after
application of the Davis-Bouldin Index metric [10][11], to
test the clustering performance, there was an actual
159

degradation in the clustering performance, as shown in
Figure 8 and Table 3. The Davis Bouldin Index for the
original data was reported at 0.668 and 0.765 for the
privatized synthetic data. The lower the Davis Bouldin
Index, the greater the clustering performance. Therefore
the suggestion that signal processing techniques, such as,
discrete cosine transforms, could improve Euclidean
distance-based clustering results, did not hold for the
image processing technique of Distance Transforms, in
this experiment [1].
Figure 6. Privatized synthetic data clustering results
To mitigate this problem, we applied the Moving
Average
Filtering
technique
[11]
on
the
privatized
synthetic data set and then applied k-means clustering on
the filtered data set again.
Figure 7. Filtered privatized synthetic data clustering results
Following the application of the moving average filter
on the privatized synthetic data set, we clustered using k-
means, with k=3, and as illustrated by the clustering
outcome in Figure 7 there was an improvement with the
Iris Virginica cluster. In fact, as illustrated in Figure 8, the
Davis Bouldin index returned a value of 0.419 for the
filtered privatized synthetic data, compared to the 0.668
for the original data, signifying an enhanced improvement
in the clustering results for the privatized synthetic data,
after filtering. Furthermore, using the distance between
clusters metric – in this case, the average within centroid
distance, to measure how well the clustering performed,
Table 3 shows that the average within centroid distance of
data points in the original data is approximately 0.5, while
that for the non-filtered privatized synthetic data, is at
0.934. However, the average within centroid distance of
data points in the filtered privatized synthetic data is
about 0.477, an improvement that surpasses both the
original and non-filtered privatized synthetic data sets.
We further tested for data usability by analyzing
clustering performance, quantifying the number of items
in each cluster, as a metric – the motivation was that the
number of items in each cluster, in the privatized
synthetic data should be similar to the number of items in
each cluster, in the original data. For instance, as
illustrated in Table 4 for the original data, there are 61,
50, 39, number of items in clusters 0, 1, and 2, in that
order. However, for the non-filtered privatized synthetic
data, there are 36, 49, 65, number of items in clusters 0, 1,
and 2, respectively. Finally, for the filtered privatized
synthetic data, we have the number of items as 46, 50, and
54, in clusters, 0, 1, and 2 respectively.

While the number of items in each of the clusters in
the privatized synthetic data might not be close to that of
the original data, we interpret this as a good indication of
confidentiality, making it difficult for an adversary to
know exactly how many items appeared in the clusters of
the original data. Therefore, we could add to the argument
that it might be possible to generate privatized synthetic
data sets with acceptable levels of both confidentiality and
usability.

CONCLUSION
We have presented a confidential synthetic data
generation heuristic, that employs a combination of data
privacy and distance transforms techniques, for the
generation of privatized
synthetic data with
similar
statistical traits of the original data. We have also
presented empirical results from applying unsupervised
learning, using k-means, to test the usability of the
privatized synthetic data sets. We applied average moving
filtering on the privatized synthetic data and showed that
filtering might help improve clustering results. Based on
our empirical results from this study and implementation,
we argue that it might be possible to generate privatized
synthetic data sets, with acceptable levels of both privacy
and data usability, while preserving the same statistical
morphological and skeletal structure of the original, using
a combination of data privacy, distance transforms, and
filtering techniques. On the limitations of this study and
future work, we focused on implementing the generation
of privatized synthetic data sets using data privacy,
distance transforms, and filtering techniques. While much
effort could have been given to the testing of the privatized
synthetic data sets to various adversarial attacks, our
efforts were largely spent on the generation of the
privatized synthetic data sets, leaving the study of attacks
on privatized synthetic data sets for future work. Finally,
generation of privatized synthetic data sets that retain the
statistical
structure
of
the
original
data,
remains
a
challenge, and is in the early stages of research. More
investigations
on
theoretical
studies,
practical
implementations, and gathering of empirical results, is
highly necessary for the advancement of privatized
synthetic data set generation with enhanced levels of
usability.
