Abstract—The reception of vibrations is a special sense of touch,
important for many insects and vertebrates. The latter realize this
reception by means of hair-shaped vibrissae all over the body, but
especially arranged in the mystacial pad around the snout. Latest
research activities focus on modeling these sensor components
to explain some biological behaviors/features (Technical Biology)
or to investigate their usage for technical applications for, e.g.,
object surface and/or shape detection (Bionics). In contrast to
these works, we focus on the modeling of the dynamic operation
modes to be applied for dynamic scanning patterns of objects.
We set up a principal mechanical model of a single vibrissa to
describe these modes of operation: passive and active vibrissae.
They are either used passively to sense environmental forces,
e.g., wind, or actively, when they are rhythmically moved to scan
objects or surfaces. Consequently, the vibrissa inspired model
has to allow for stabilizing and tracking control as well, but yet
being able to detect (superimposed) solitary excitations. Hence,
the biological paradigm exhibits some adaptive behavior, and so
must the controller: to be adaptive in view of both the randomness
of the external signals to be suppressed and the uncertainty of
the system data.

INTRODUCTION
Tactile sensor technology seems nowhere near from playing
a key role in environmental exploration in mobile robotics,
especially when compared to optical sensing technology [1].
Taking a glance at the world of biology, the sense of touch
provides necessary information for several species, e.g., mam-
mals, especially nocturnal animals like rats. They exhibit a
sophisticated tactile sense organ supporting tactile exploration
which complements the visual and aural sensing: the mystacial
vibrissae in the snout region, see Figure 1.
Figure 1. Mammals with vibrissae: a cat named ‘Alfred’ with whiskers
(left), and a rat (right) [2].
The rats beneﬁt from their vibrissae in different ways: they
are involved in their social behavior, acquisition of food, loco-
motion, navigation [3][4], detecting air ﬂows [5]. They enable
the rats to detect, localize and recognize objects near their
faces [6], including detection of object features (orientation,
shape, texture) [7][8].
The mystacial vibrissae are arranged in an array of columns
and rows around the snout, see Figure 2.
Figure 2. Schematic drawing of the mystacial pad (left) [9],
follicle-sinus-complex of a vibrissa (right) [10].
The vibrissa itself (made of dead material) is mainly used
as a lever for the force transmission. But, in contrast to
ordinary hairs, vibrissae are stiffer and have a hollow conical
shape [9]. Each vibrissa in the mystacial pad is embedded in
and supported by its own follicle-sinus-complex (FSC), see
Figure 2, right. The FSC is characterized by its exceptional
arrangement of blood vessels, neural bonding and muscles.
Despite the distribution and difference of the vibrissae in
a mystacial pad with respect to their (varying) material and
geometrical features (multi-layer system, slenderness, conical
shape with inherent curvature inside this pad), we focus on
a single vibrissa, its surrounding tissue, its functionality and
mode of operation. For a more detailed overview see [11].
Due to [12] the surrounding musculature is divided in extrinsic
and intrinsic one. The vibrissa can either be moved passively
(e.g., by wind), or actively through alternate contractions of
the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. The resulting rhythmic
pro- and retractions of the vibrissa, called whisking, are used
to scan surfaces and objects [10]. Relevant information can
be perceived by adjusting the frequency and amplitude of
the oscillation to each task. By observing rats accomplishing
several types of exercises, Berg and Kleinfeld in [13] could
distinguish two main whisking patterns: exploratory whisking
when rodents explore their environment with large amplitude
sweeps in a low frequency (5-15Hz) range, and foveal whisking

when rodents palpate object surfaces with small amplitude,
high frequency (15-25Hz) movements. Summarizing, the com-
plex FSC- and muscle-system enables the rodents to use their
vibrissae in two different ways (modes of operation):
•
In the passive mode, the vibrissae are being deﬂected
by external forces (e.g., wind). They return to their
rest position passively — thus without any muscle
activation.
•
In the active mode, the vibrissae are swung back-
and forward by alternate contractions of the intrinsic
and extrinsic muscles. By adjusting the frequency and
amplitude of the oscillations, the rodents are able to
investigate object surfaces and shapes amazingly fast
and with high precision [14].
But, how the animals convert these multiple contacts with sin-
gle objects into coherent information about their surroundings
remains unclear and is not of focus in this work. However, from
the point of view from control theory, every biological sensory
system has the ability to constantly adapt its sensitivity to its
current environment in a way that empowers it to distinguish
the relevant information out of the multitude of negligible stim-
uli (→ adaptive system). Several control strategies enhance the
relevance-oriented stimulus processing:
•
a feedback-loop (closed-loop control system) enables
the rodents to immediately react to an object contact:
they slow down the concerned vibrissae, diminishing
the occurring wear-out effect on the hair [15][16],
•
depending on the mode (passive or active) and the
expectations of the rodent, the neurons reaction is
being suppressed, enhanced or left unaltered [17]–
[19].
Therefore, this biological sensor system is highly interesting
for applications in the ﬁeld of autonomous robotics, since tac-
tile sensors can offer reliable information, where conventional
sensors fail (in dark, smoky or noisy environments).
The remainder of the paper at hand is structured as follows:
In Section II, we give a very brief overview on mathematical
models to describe the rigid-body motion of vibrissa-like
mechanical systems. Then, in Section III, we present the
vibrissa-inspired sensor model, derive the equations of motion,
and present some aspects of the mathematical treatment and
the modes of operation in Section IV. Section V is devoted to
numerical simulations. Finally, the results of the present paper
are summed up and some future research subjects are identiﬁed
in Section VI.

STATE OF THE ART - MODELING ANIMAL VIBRISSAE
An intensive literature overview of technical vibrissa mod-
els (rigid body and continuum) has been presented in [20]–
[22]. Here, we brieﬂy discuss some models therein, where
we restrict the investigations to rigid body models, continuous
models are in recent exploration.
The following summarizes the relevant information of the

paper.

The goal is not to recreate an exact copy of the biological
system, but to implement the speciﬁc characteristics of the
vibrissa needed for the detection of useful information in
challenging surroundings in a mechanical model. Principally,
the tenor of our investigations is from bionics: modeling live
paradigms, exploiting corresponding mathematical models in
order to understand details of internal processes and, possibly,
coming to artiﬁcial prototypes (e.g., sensors in robotics). We
point out that we focus on a single vibrissa and not on a tuft
of various vibrissae as in [26].
III.
A FIRST MODEL OF A SINGLE VIBRISSA
Following [12] and as mentioned in Section I, the vibrissa
is supported by its FSC. Important parts of it are an enveloping
chamber with controllable blood supply, and intrinsic and
extrinsic muscles which control the vibrissa motions. This
biological description suggests physical models as sketched
in Figure 3, and these then led us to the mathematical model
based on the pendulum device in Figure 4. The model has a
viscoelastic support (skin level) and is acted upon by a force
excitation F(·) and a control torque Mu(·). The control torque
is due to control impact by the musculature [12]. The equations

SIMULATIONS
We point out that the adaptive nature of the controller is
expressed by the arbitrary choice of the system parameters.
Obviously numerical simulation needs ﬁxed (and known) sys-
tem data, but the controller adjusts its gain parameter to each
set of system data. Hence, we choose the following parameters
(for all simulations, further data will be given on the spot), see
[24]:
•
vibrissa: m = 0.003 kg, c = 5.7 N
m, d = 0.2 Ns
m ,
L = 0.04 m, a =
L
10 = 0.004 m,

Figure 8 (left) shows a good stabilization - the output is
captured by the tube. Figure 8 (right) shows the convergence
of the gain parameter to a constant value, and Figure 9 the
necessary control torque, which reﬂects the local disturbance
around t = 20.
B. Active mode 1: λ-tracking of ϕref1(·)
Now we pass to an active mode. Again we use controller
(3) to track reference signal ϕref1(·).

Figure 11. Control torque Mu, all vs. t.
We have a good tracking behavior, the output is captured
by the tube. This seems to be true because the error is captured
by the tube around zero, see Figure 10 (left). Let us point out
that we omit the ﬁgure of the output for reasons of presentation
(oscillations with high frequency to be tracked) and focus on
the error in the following. The controller gain is given in
Figure 10 (right). Figure 11 shows the control torque that very
weakly responds to the local disturbance.
C. Active mode 2: λ-tracking of ϕref2(·)
Here, we simulate another active mode in tracking refer-
ence signal ϕref2(·) using controller (3).

Figure 13. Control torque Mu vs. t.
Again, and also in simulation of another active mode
(foveal whisking) we have a good tracking behavior because
the controller works effectively, see Figures 12 and 13. But, it
is quite hard to detect the gust of wind in the system variable.
Only the control torque reﬂects the “peak” around t = 20 s, see
Figure 13. Therefore, we try to detect the additional excitation
by means of other observables.
D. Improved adaptation laws
The foregoing simulation shows that the system is not
really sensitive to notice the excitation peak around t = 20,
though tracking and stabilization are essentially guaranteed.
Moreover, after the control objective is achieved the gain
parameter still stays at its high value. Figures 8 (right), 10
(right) and 12 (right) show the monotonic increase of k(·)
towards a limit k∞. But if some perturbation repeatedly caused
the output to leave the λ-strip then k(t) would take larger
values again and again. The aim is now to avoid this drawback.
We now apply an improved adaptation law, see [29], that
makes k(·) decrease as long as further high lever is not
necessary. We distinguish three cases: 1. increasing k(·) while
e is outside the tube, 2. constant k(·) after e entered the tube
- no longer than a pre-speciﬁed duration td of stay, and 3.
decreasing k(·) after this duration has been exceeded. For
instance:
˙k(t) =

(7)
with given σ > 0, γ ≫ 1, and td > 0, whereas the entry time
tE is an internal variable.
Choosing this new adaptor (7) with σ = 0.2 (moderate
exponential decay rate [21]) and td = 1 (moderate choice
of the duration of stay within the λ-tube [29]), we obtain the
following tracking results in an active mode, e.g., λ-tracking
of ϕref1(·):

Figure 15. Control torque Mu vs. t.
The output is forced into the tube, see Figure 14 (left). The
gain k(·) immediately decreases, see Figure 14 (right), after
a td-stay of e in the tube, see Figure 14 (left). Apparently
the decrease is too fast: e leaves the tube again but, as a
consequence of ˙k being proportional to the square of the
(small) deviation from the λ-tube, k increases too slowly as to
force e quickly back to the tube. The necessary control input
is displayed in Figure 15.
In order to make the attraction of the tube stronger, we use
different exponents for large/small distance from the tube, see
[29]. For instance:

Figure 17. Control torque Mu vs. t.
Here, one cannot clearly see the advantage of two alternat-
ing exponents. The gain parameter k(·) increases very fast in
the beginning of the simulation, see Figure 16 (right). This
is due to the “switching on” of the controller. It forces e
faster into the tube at cost of a high k. Then, k decreases
if e stays in the tube for a duration larger than td, see
Figure 16 (right). e is forced back into the λ-tube very fast,
see Figure 16, because the attraction of the tube is stronger
for small deviations ∥e(t)∥ − λ > 0. This is on the expense
of a tolerable overshooting of k at the beginning, mentioned
above. But, interestingly, we are also able to detect solitary
excitations in observing the gain k(·) instead of Mu(·), see
Figure 17.

CONCLUSIONS
The foregoing considerations have shown that adaptive
control is promising in application to vibrissae systems. In
particular, it allows, based on the dynamical equations, to
describe two main modes of operation of vibrissae: passive
and active ones. Improved adaptive controllers are useful and
should be developed further.
Current tasks include
•
separation of an extra receptor from vibrissa,
•
allowing for input and output disturbances,
•
identiﬁcation techniques to get knowledge of solitary
excitations.
Near future tasks are
•
replace circular pendulum by spherical one (spatial
receptivity),
•
tuning of the adaptors (i.e., to ﬁnd favorable values of
γ, σ, td), and investigating rates of convergence,
•
hardware experiments to validate the theory,
•
to develop elastic vibrissae models, e.g., multi-body
systems and/or continuum systems,
•
consider a tuft of vibrissae (modeling the intrinsic
musculature), not only a single vibrissa.
After doing this, one can think about the application of the
presented tracking scenario to replace the kinematic drive /
kinematic scanning trail in present application for recognition
of object contours and/or texture in, e.g., [30][31].
