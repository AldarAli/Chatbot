Abstract—These days, many people use a Social Networking
Service (SNS). Most SNS users are careful in protecting the
privacy of personal information: name, age, gender, address, tele-
phone number, birthday, etc. However, some SNS users disclose
their personal information that can threaten their privacy and
security even if they use non-real name accounts. In this study,
we investigated tweets disclosing submitters’ personal proﬁle
items which many of us think are not true. We collected 565
tweets where submitters used non-real name accounts and made
promises to disclose their personal proﬁle items, surveyed the
details of their personal proﬁle items disclosed by themselves,
especially their ages, genders, and heights, and analyzed them
statistically, to be speciﬁc, applied the Shapiro-Wilk test of
normality and the Welch’s test to them. The results of these tests
showed that most of the submitters disclosed their ages, genders,
and heights honestly.

INTRODUCTION
These days, many people use a Social Networking Service
(SNS) to communicate with each other and try to enlarge their
circle of friends. SNS users are generally concerned about
potential privacy risks [1]. To be speciﬁc, they are afraid that
unwanted audiences will obtain information about them or
their families, such as where they live, work, and play. As
a result, SNS users are generally careful in disclosing their
personal information. They disclose their personal information
only when they think the beneﬁts of doing it is greater than the
potential privacy risks. However, some SNS users, especially
young users, disclose personal information on their proﬁles,
for example, real full name, gender, hometown and full date
of birth, which can potentially be used to identify details of
their real life, such as their social security numbers. In order to
discuss this phenomenon, many researchers investigated how
much and which type of information are disclosed in SNSs,
especially, in Facebook [2] [3]. Researchers might think that
personal information disclosed in Facebook is reliable, or it is
possible to check whether personal information disclosed in
Facebook is true. This is because
•
Facebook users are required to register and disclose
their real names when they ﬁrst start using Facebook.
•
Facebook users would be criticized by their friends if
they disclose their information dishonestly.
On the other hand, a small number of researchers investigated
how much and which type of information disclosed by non-
real name account users, such as Twitter users. Researchers
Figure 1. A non-real name account user, Rina, disclosed her personal proﬁle
items in her tweets.
might think that personal information disclosed by non-real
name account users is unreliable. This is because
•
nobody criticizes non-real name account users when
they disclose their personal information dishonestly.
•
true personal information can threaten their privacy
and security even if they use non-real name accounts.
As a result, many of us think that it is natural for non-real
name account users not to disclose their personal information
honestly. Figure 1 shows tweets submitted by non-real name
account user, Rina. In these tweets, Rina disclosed her personal
proﬁle items: her age, gender, birthday, zodiac sign, and height.
Many of us think that these personal proﬁle items were not
true. However, we do not check whether Rina disclosed her
personal proﬁle items honestly because it is difﬁcult to do it.
In this paper, we collect tweets where non-real name account
users disclosed their personal proﬁle items, analyze them
statistically, and show that it is likely that most of the non-real
name account users, especially young users, disclosed their

personal information honestly.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section
II, we survey the related works. In Section III, we show how
to collect tweets disclosing submitters’ personal proﬁle items.
In Section IV, we survey the details of submitters’ personal
proﬁle items, analyze them statistically, and show that it is
likely that most of the submitters disclosed their personal
proﬁle items honestly. Finally, in Section V, we present our
conclusions.

RELATED WORK
Personally identiﬁable information is deﬁned as informa-
tion which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s
identity such as social security number, biometric records,
etc. alone, or when combined with other information that
is linkable to a speciﬁc individual, such as date and place
of birth, mother’s maiden name, etc. [4] [5]. Internet users
are generally concerned about unwanted audiences obtaining
personal information. Fox et al. reported that 86% of Internet
users are concerned that unwanted audiences will obtain in-
formation about them or their families [1]. Also, Acquisti and
Gross reported that students expressed high levels of concern
for general privacy issues on Facebook, such as a stranger
ﬁnding out where they live and the location and schedule of
their classes, and a stranger learning their sexual orientation,
name of their current partner, and their political afﬁliations
[2]. However, Internet users, especially young users, tend to
disclose personal information on their proﬁles, for example,
real full name, gender, hometown and full date of birth, which
can potentially be used to identify details of their real life,
such as their social security numbers. As a result, many
researchers discussed the reasons why young users willingly
disclose personal information on their SNS proﬁles. Dwyer
concluded in her research that privacy is often not expected
or undeﬁned in SNSs [6]. Barnes argues that Internet users,
especially teenagers, are not aware of the nature of the Internet
and SNSs [3]. Hirai reported that many users had troubles in
SNSs because they did not mind that strangers observed their
communication with their friends [7]. Viseu et al. reported that
many online users believe the beneﬁts of disclosing personal
information in order to use an Internet site is greater than the
potential privacy risks [8]. On the other hand, Acquisti and
Gross explain this phenomenon as a disconnection between the
users’ desire to protect their privacy and their actual behavior
[2]. Also, Livingstone points out that teenagers’ conception of
privacy does not match the privacy settings of most SNSs [9].
Joinson et al. reported that trust and perceived privacy had a
strong affect on individuals’ willingness to disclose personal
information to a website [10]. Also, Tufekci found that concern
about unwanted audiences had an impact on whether or not
students revealed their real names and religious afﬁliation
on MySpace and Facebook [11]. The authors also think that
most students are seriously concerned about their privacy and
security. However, they often underestimate the risk of their
online messages and submit them. For example, Watanabe
et al. reported that many students submit tweets concerning
school events and these tweets may give a chance to other
people, including unwanted audiences, to distinguish which
schools students go to [12].
III.
A COLLECTION OF TWEETS DISCLOSING
SUBMITTERS’ PERSONAL PROFILE ITEMS
It is difﬁcult to collect tweets disclosing submitters’ per-
sonal proﬁle items, such as tweets in Figure 1, directly. To
solve this problem, we focused on tweets where submitters
promised their followers to disclose the same number of their
own personal proﬁle items as likes to their tweets. Figure 2
shows a tweet submitted by Rina on September 3, 2019. In
this tweet, Rina promised her followers to disclose the same
number of her personal proﬁle items as likes to her tweet.
Actually, Rina submitted 35 replies disclosing her personal
proﬁle items to her tweet shown in Figure 2 from September 3
to 9, 2019. The ﬁve tweets shown in Figure 1 were the ﬁrst ﬁve
replies submitted by Rina to her tweets shown in Figure 2. As
of November 20, 2019, we conﬁrmed that 37 likes were given
to her tweet shown in Figure 2. Furthermore, we found many
tweets promising to disclose the same number of their own
personal proﬁle items as likes to their tweets. As a result, it is
easy to collect tweets disclosing submitters’ personal proﬁle
items when we collect tweets promising to disclose submitters’
personal proﬁle items. The reasons why many Twitter users
submitted tweets promising to disclose submitters’ personal
proﬁle items might be
•
they thought they looked fun,
•
they wanted to draw attention, and
•
they wanted to know how much attention was paid to
their tweets.
In order to collect tweets promising to disclose submitters’
personal proﬁle items, we focused on images attached to these
tweets. This is because many submitters attached the same
image to their tweets and many personal proﬁle items were
listed in the image. As shown in Figure 2, Rina attached an
image to her tweet and showed the list of personal proﬁle items
that she promised her followers to disclose in the image. Many
twitter users attached the same image to their tweets promising
to disclose their personal proﬁle items. As a result, we used
these shared images as key to collect tweets promising to
disclose submitters’ personal proﬁle items. To be speciﬁc, we

collected these tweets by using Twigaten [13]. Twigaten helps
us to collect tweets to which the same image is attached. By
using Twigaten, we collected 565 Japanese tweets promising to
disclose submitters’ personal proﬁle items on November 20,
2019. The obtained tweets were submitted from October 3,
2018 to November 20, 2019.
IV.
AN ANALYSIS OF TWEETS DISCLOSING SUBMITTERS’
PERSONAL PROFILE ITEMS
It is difﬁcult to determine whether an individual submitter
disclosed his/her personal proﬁle items honestly. For example,
it is difﬁcult to determine whether Rina, who submitted tweets
in Figure 1 and Figure 2, was a woman. In this study, we
discuss whether submitters disclosed their personal proﬁle
items honestly when they made promises to disclose them. In
order to discuss this problem, we analyze submitters’ genders,
ages, and heights statistically.
A. Submitters’ genders
As mentioned in Section III, we obtained the 565 tweets
promising to disclose their personal proﬁle items. We surveyed
these 565 tweets and their replies and, according to submitters’
genders disclosed in the replies, classiﬁed them into
•
282 tweets (women)
•
156 tweets (men)
•
27 tweets (unclear)
•
100 tweets (no replies)

(b) the histogram of submitters’ heights (disclosed genders: women).

genders, men or women, clearly. (bin width = 5cm)
B. Submitters’ ages
We also surveyed the 565 tweets and their replies and,
according to whether submitters’ ages were disclosed in their
replies clearly, classiﬁed them into
•
276 tweets (clearly)
•
60 tweets (unclearly)
•
229 tweets (no replies)
When submitter’s age was disclosed such as “early 20s”
and “over thirty”, we determined that submitter’s age was
disclosed unclearly. Among the 276 tweets where submitters’
ages were disclosed clearly, we found 102 and 161 tweets
where submitters’ genders were also disclosed clearly, men and
women, respectively. Figure 3 shows the number of submitters,
who disclosed their genders clearly, men and women, by age.
As shown in Figure 3, the most popular age of men and women
were 16 and 15 years old, respectively.

C. Submitters’ heights
We also surveyed the 565 tweets and their replies and,
according to whether submitters’ heights were disclosed in
their replies clearly, classiﬁed them into
•
401 tweets (clearly),
•
8 tweets (unclearly), and
•
156 tweets (no replies).
Among the 401 tweets where submitters’ heights were dis-
closed clearly, we found 131 and 244 tweets where submitters’
genders were disclosed clearly, men and women, respectively.
Figure 4 shows the histogram of heights of submitters who
disclosed their genders, men or women, clearly.
It is difﬁcult to determine whether an individual submitter
disclosed his/her personal proﬁle items honestly. In this study,
we statistically examine whether submitters disclosed their
personal proﬁle items honestly when they made promises to
disclose their personal proﬁle items and disclosed them in the
same way as Rina did.
It is well known that our heights follow a normal (Gaus-
sian) distribution [14]. As a result, if most of submitters
disclose their ages, genders, and heights honestly, their heights
would follow a normal distribution. Also, the average of their
heights would be equal to the national average height in Japan.
To solve this problem, in this paper, we conduct the statistical
analysis on
•
37 submitters who disclosed their genders (men), ages
(15-17 years old), and heights clearly, and
•
60 submitters who disclosed their genders (women),
ages (14-16 years old), and heights clearly.
As shown in Figure 3, men aged 15-17 and women aged 14-17
were the most popular segments in the submitters’ ages.
First, we discuss whether submitters’ heights followed a
normal distribution. Figure 5 shows the histograms of their
heights. In order to discuss whether submitters’ heights fol-
lowed a normal distribution, we conducted the Shapiro-Wilk
test of normality. The null hypothesis in this study was that
submitters’ heights followed a normal distribution. Table I
shows the results of the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality. As
shown in Table I, the p-value in each case was greater than
0.05. As a result, the null hypothesis in each case was not
rejected. In other words, submitters’ heights, in each case of
men aged 15-17 and women aged 14-16, followed a normal
distribution.
Next, we discuss whether the average of submitters’ heights
was equal to the national average height in Japan. Table II
shows the average of submitters’ heights. Table III shows
the national average height in Japan [15]. In order to discuss

whether the average of their heights was equal to the national
average height in Japan, we conducted the Welch’s test. The
null hypothesis in this study was that the average of submitters’
heights was equal to the national average height in Japan. Table
IV shows the results of the Welch’s test. As shown in Table
IV, the p-value in each case was greater than 0.05. As a result,
the null hypothesis in each case was not rejected. In other
words, in each case of men aged 15-17 and women aged 14-
16, the average of submitters’ heights was equal to the national
average height in Japan.
The results of the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality and the
Welch’s test rarely happened when many submitters disclosed
their ages, genders, and heights dishonestly. As a result, it
is assumed that most of the submitters disclosed their ages,
genders, and heights honestly. Furthermore, age, gender, and
height were important personal information. It is likely that
they disclosed not only their ages, genders, and heights but
also other personal proﬁle items honestly.
V.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we investigated tweets disclosing submitters’
personal proﬁle items and analyzed submitters’ ages, genders,
and heights statistically. The results of the statistical analysis
showed that it is likely that most of the submitters disclosed
their personal proﬁle items honestly. These personal proﬁle
items can threaten their privacy and security even if they
use non-real name accounts. We are investigating whether
submitters were concerned about their privacy and security
risks caused by submitting tweets disclosing their personal
proﬁle items honestly. Furthermore, we intend to conduct the
same statistical analysis on tweets in languages other than
Japanese.
