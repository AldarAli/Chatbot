the
development
of
information
and
communication technology, People are gradually replaced map
with the Vehicles telematics system (VTS). In addition,
navigation is not the only function of VTS nowadays, new
generation VTS even provides various functions and system
services. This study tries to discuss the development trend of
VTS products/services and customers’ needs of navigation and
location services, audio-video and entertainment services,
communication and information services and safety and
security services. However, automobile manufacturers and
VTS products/service providers need to determine the new
product development strategy based on their customers’ needs.
Because customers’ needs will influence the automobile sales
and give an impact on the development of VTS service in the
future. This study also proposes NRM to determine the service
improvement path and the improvement strategy based on the
NRM. The aspect of the Safety and Security Services (SS) is the
primary dominating aspect, the aspect of Communications and
System Services (CS) is the most important influencing aspect
in the NRM of the VSI. The aspect of the Payment Channel
(PC) is the primary dominating aspect and the aspect of the
Payment Method (PM) is the most important influencing
aspect of the PSI.

INTRODUCTION
The original purpose of the GPS technology was for
the military. It was gradually released to private enterprises.
The related map information systems were thoroughly built.
The application service of GPS technology had begun to
move
toward
diversification
[1-3].
New
generation
automobile not only emphasizes the mechanical efficiency,
but also the VTS system functions. In order to satisfy the
service needs of mobile environment for different customer
groups, the VTS service system needs to be integrated and
offers diverse service functions. Therefore some integrated
functions have been appeared, such as the information and
communication service, vehicles monitor service. According
to the U.S.A., navigation devices can be classified as
vehicle, aviation and marine navigation devices. Vehicle
navigation devices are widely applied to END (Embedded
Navigation Device), PND (Portable Navigation Device),
PDA (Personal Digital Assistants) smart phones and a
diversity of mobile devices [4, 5]. The car has become an
open mobile service system from a closed transportation
tool. The automobile has increased the added value of
navigation, safety, security, information, communication,
and entertainment functions. The VTS service system can
aid drivers and passengers to contact with call center and
access the navigation information. The VTS service system
can not only improve driving convenience but also ensure
the safety of vehicles under the appropriate monitoring. The
innovation of ICT technologies has attributed to the diverse
system service, and devices have become more and more
thinner and lighter. Besides the VTS service system
continually increase service functions, and the VTS service
devices generally become similar to customers. This kind of
trend attributes the VTS service system/device to become
more and more popular in the current year, and to become
the necessary goods from luxury goods. The navigation
technology and electric service function of VTS service
system has rapid progress continually for achieving the
satisfaction
level
of
customer
needs.
In
the
highly
competition market of vehicle telematics service, the
customers can’t only be pleased by the improvement of the
device hardware and electronic map software services. It is
important for VTS service operators to identify what is
consumers’ needs develop new generation VTS service
system to satisfy customers’ needs. Because this will not
only influence sales volumes for automobile operators but
also impact the service market of end user for automobile
market.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section 2, product development and market position for
VTS service system are reviewed and discussed. In Section
3, the evaluation model of market position for VTS service
system is built. In Section 4, a novel MCDM technique is
used to solve the market position decision problem (i.e.,
customers’ preferences). The performance of the VTS
service system is then discussed and an empirical study is
demonstrated for the novel MCDM model. Finally, in
Section 5, the conclusions and remarks are presented.

and marine and so on. The vehicle navigation devices are
widely applied to END (Embedded Navigation Device),
PND (Portable Navigation Device), PDA (Personal Digital
Assistants) Smart phone and diverse mobile devices [4, 5].
This study discusses the service needs of customers, defines
the functions/utilities of VTS service system, and analyzes
the difference of customer needs. Besides, this study also
arranges the service functions based on different customers’
attributes, and generalizes five main value evaluation
aspects (Location and navigation and services, LN; Safety
and security services, SS; Communications and system
Services, CS; Multimedia and entertainment services, ME;
Image and customer relationship, IR) and four price
evaluation aspect (Service Fee Rate, SF; Package Pricing,
PP; Payment Method, PM; Payment Channel, PC) for VTS
service systems/devices. This study determines the customer
preference of VTS service systems using user questionnaire
survey, and builds the network relation map by DEMATEL
(Decision Making Trial and Evaluation) technique. Then
this study uses the ANP (Analytic Network Process)
technique to determine the aspect weights and builds the
group component among the aspect by PCA (Principal
Component Analysis) technique. Finally, this study uses the
VIKOR (VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno
Resenje, VIKOR) [6] to analyze the VSI (Value satisfaction
index) and PSI (Price satisfaction index) for VTS service
systems/devices [7]. This study proposes an integrated
evaluation model to analyze the current service gap of VTS
service systems/devices, and illustrates four real commercial
types VTS services/devices to test the proposed model. This
proposed model can aid VTS system service operators to
determine
the
market
position
of
VTS
service
systems/devices by MPM (market position map) approach,
determine the service improvement paths using network
relation
map
(NRM)
approach
and
can
provide
product/service
development
strategy
of
VTS
systems/devices
for
the
VTS
service
providers
and
automobile operators in the future. In the VTS service
systems/devices, the system service providers need to play
the integrated role to provide the user various vehicle
navigation and mobile services applications (Table I).

THE EVALUATION MODEL OF MARKET POSITION FOR
VTS SERVICE SYSTEMS
The analysis process of the service development
strategy model for VTS service system is based on a novel
MCDM
technique
as
the
following
five
steps:
(1)
introduces the research idea and market position map, (2)
applies FCM to construct the network relations map
(NRM); (3) constructs the motivation of needs by using
PCA; (4) uses ANP to analyze the group weights; and (5)
evaluates the performance gaps of digital music service
systems using the FIM , discussing the development trend
and related studies suggestion on the VTS services system.
A.
The concept of market position map
Some studies have pointed out a trade-off relation
between price and value [7, 8]. Some researchers used
regression analysis to come out the relation between benefit
and price [8]. The advantage of regression analysis is to
handle the location analysis and to extract the price data

easily.
However,
the
position
analysis
of
a
multi-
benefit/function is hard to be handled by a regression
analysis, and we need to consider the value and price
respectively. Some study adopted the value satisfaction
index and price satisfaction index to solve the multi-
benefit/function problems, and used the MCDM technique
to evaluate varying tangible and invisible benefit/functions
in the mobile phone market [7]. Therefore, this research
adopts the MCDM techniques to analyze our research
problem and extend the value-price map into the market
position map (Figure 1).
The axes of the market position map include the value
satisfaction index and price satisfaction index. The value
satisfaction index consists of the aspects increasing the
customer value satisfaction, while the price satisfaction
index
consists
of
aspects
improving
customer
price
satisfaction. As shown in Figure 1, the X axis is the value
satisfaction index (VSI) and the Y axis is the price
satisfaction index (PSI). In this study, the value satisfaction
index includes four aspects: Location and navigation and
services
(LN),
Safety
and
security
services
(SS),
Communications and system Services (CS), Multimedia
and entertainment services (ME) and Image and customer
relationship (IR), and the price satisfaction index includes
four aspects: Service Fee Rate (SF), Package Pricing (PP),
Payment Method (PM) and Payment Channel (PC). The
market position map is divided into four sections or market
segmentations [Common and luxurious, (H, H); high price
and gorgeous, (H, L); Low price to penetrating market (L,
H); No or limited choice (L, L)].

B.
Builds the DEMATEL model
The basic concept of DEMATEL technique was initiated
for the Science and Human Affairs Program by Battelle
Memorial Institute of Geneva between 1972 and 1976 to
solve complex problems. This study uses the concept
DEMATEL method to build the evaluation structure of
network relation map (NRM) for creating an e-era VTS
system. When making decisions, the decision-maker has to
consider the criteria in detail and all the interrelations
between them. What the decision-maker has to do is to find
out the key criteria, modify them and then the whole
performance of satisfaction will be enhanced. Therefore,
when the decision-maker copes with lots of criteria being
changed, the best solution is to determine the key criteria
that affect the other criteria mostly and modify them.
Eventually, the results of the evaluation will become more
and more precise. Therefore, some recent studies considered
the DEMATEL techniques for solving complex studies,
such as the expectation model of service quality [9], and
value-created system of science (technology) park [10]. The
steps of the DEMATEL method are described as follows: (1)
Calculates the original influence matrix by average of
expert-respondents, (2) Calculates the degree of direct
influence matrix, (3) Calculates the total degree of indirect
influence matrix, (4) Calculates the total degree of direct and
indirect influence matrix, and (5) Determines the Network
Relation Map (NRM).
(1) Calculates the initial average matrix
Respondents were asked to indicate the influence that
they believe each aspect exerts on each of the others;
according to scoring scales ranging from 0 to 4, where “0”
means no influence and “4” means “extremely strong
influence.” For the question between aspect/criterion; “1”,
“2”, and “3” mean “low influence”, “medium influence”
and “high influence,” respectively. As the data shows in
Table II, the influence of Multimedia and entertainment
services (ME) on “Image and customer relationship (IR)” is
2.300, which means “medium influence”. On the other
hand, the influence of Image and customer relationship (IR)
on Multimedia and entertainment services (ME) is 1.950,
which means “low influence”.

(2) Calculates direct influence matrix
The
initial
direct
influence
matrix
(D)
can
be
calculated by Eq. (1) and Eq. (2). (A) is the initial average
influence
matrix,
and
can
produce
the
initial
direct
influence matrix (D) through the process of Eq. (1) and Eq.
(2). Matrix D represents each direct influence, and in the
Matrix, the numbers on the diagonal are 0 and the sum of
each column and row is 1 in maximum (only one equals 1).
Adding the sums of each row and column in the Matrix
results in the direct influence value:

“direct influence matrix (D)”. As shown in Table III, the
diagonal items of D are all 0, and the sum of a row is 1, at
most. Then we calculated Table IV by adding up the rows
and columns. In Table IV, the sum of the rows and columns
for “Communications and system Services (CS)” is 1.974,
which is the most important influence aspect. On the other
hand, the sum of the rows and columns for Multimedia and
entertainment services (ME) is 1.474, which is the least
important influence aspect.

(4) Calculates full influence matrix
Full influence matrix T can be derived from Eqs. (4) or
(5). Table VI is the calculated full influence matrix. As
shown in Table VI, the full influence matrix T, consists of
multiple elements, indicated as Eq. (6). The sum vector of
the row value is {
id }, and the sum vector of the column
value { ir }; then, let i
 j
, the sum vector of row value plus
column value is {
i
i
d
 r
}, which means the full influence
of the matrix T. As the sum of the row value plus the
column value {
i
i
d
 r
} is higher, the relationship of the
dimension or criterion is stronger. The sum of the row value
minus the column value is {
i
i
d
 r
}, which means the net
influence relationship. If
i
i
d

According to the aspects/criteria defined in Table I,
some experts were invited to discuss the relation and
influence levels of criteria under the same aspects/ criteria
and to score the relation and influence among criteria based
on the DEMATEL technique. Aspects/criteria are divided
into different types, so the experts could answer the
questionnaire in areas/fields with which they were familiar.
The net full influence matrix,
Tnet
, is determined by the Eq.
(9).

The diagonal items of the matrix are all 0. In other
words, the matrix contains a strictly upper triangular matrix
and a strictly lower triangular matrix. Moreover, while
values of strictly upper triangular matrix and strictly lower
triangular matrix are same, their symbols are opposite. This
property helps us that we only have to choose one of strictly
triangular matrix.

We can understand the related influence structure of
NRM for the VTS service system from Figure 2, the figure
shows that the aspects of Safety and Security Services (SS),
Communications and system Services (CS) and Multimedia
and entertainment services (ME) are mainly influencing
aspects, and the aspect of Location and navigation and
services (LN) and Image and customer relationship (IR) are
mainly influenced aspect. Therefore, this study wants to
assist decision-makers to build an improvement process,
and conducts calculus on the net (be received) influence
matrix using the full influence matrix (TABLE VIII). The
evaluated method can integrate the degree of influence of
the aspect, sand gain the net influence relation of the five
aspects. From TABLE VIII and Figure 2, the IR aspect has
net influence on the aspect of SR, PM and PF, the aspect of
SR had net influence on the aspect of PM, PF and PP. The
aspect of PM had net influences on the aspect PF and PP,
and the aspect of PF influences the aspect of PP. The aspect
of IR should be improved firstly, then the aspect of SR, PM
and PF should be improved secondly. The aspect of PP is
the least improvement item among all aspects. It’s indirect
for improving the service performance of the system.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
This study uses PCA to analyze the original data of
importance degree. It can be used to simplify the large
number of criteria and it also can satisfy the hypothesis of
AHP/ANP on the independence/dependence of criteria
included in system aspect. However, the founder of ANP,
Professor Saaty, didn’t explicitly define it [11]. From the
paper analysis of AHP/ANP, it can be figured out that the
hypothesis is that criteria in aspects are independent
/dependent. That’s why we use this technique in this study.
There are two components that can be extracted: PM
(Platform design and maintenance) and the square sum
(88.092%), and named the major elements, as shown in
TABLE IX. Support of device system (PM3), frequencies
of content update (PM2), and system protection (PM1) can
be integrated
into
the first
major component PMP1
(Platform design and maintenance). System stability (PM5)
and system protection (PM4) can be integrated into the
second component PMP2 (System stability and security).

Analytic network procedure model (ANP)
Saaty (1996) proposed the concepts of ANP in 1996, to
solve the issue that the AHP method is too ideal to evaluate
the problems correctly. The ANP method [12-14] can cope
with the dependence and feedback relation in the problems.
The evaluation is closer to the actual adoption. The
following three steps are undertaken to evaluate the
decision problems with the ANP method: (1) builds the
network hierarchical structure, (2) calculates the weighing
of factors in each hierarchy, and (3) calculates the
weighting of the whole hierarchy structure. In this study,
the ANP steps are introduced as follows: (1) clarifies the
problems and build the structure based on NRM, (2)
designs the questionnaire and survey, (3) builds the
weightings
of
pair-wise
comparisons,
calculates
the
weightings
of
factors,
and

(4)
calculates the super-matrix.

Vlse Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno
Resenje (VIKOR)
After establishing the evaluation model, including
criteria and given weights in each criterion, the next step is
to evaluate and improve the performance of benchmarked
alternatives. The more utilities/functions of the service
system of VTS, the more expensive it is. Thus, among the
evaluation model of service system for VTS, the functional
criteria are mutually conflicted with the cost criteria. The
VIKOR method is used to evaluate, improve and rank the
performance of benchmarked alternatives. The VIKOR
method is a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM)

method, and is applied to solve a discrete decision problem
with non-commensurable and conflicting criteria. This
method focuses on ranking, improving and selecting the
best alternative from a set of alternatives, and determines
the compromise solution for a problem with conflicting
criteria, which can help the decision-makers to reach a final
best decision. Here, the compromise solution is a feasible
solution closest to the ideal point (or closest to the
aspired/desired levels in each criterion), and a compromise
means an agreement established by mutual concessions.
Thus, the VIKOR method would be applied to rank,
evaluate and improve the performance of the best service
systems of VTS. The basic concept of VIKOR is to identify
the positive-ideal solution (the aspired/desired level) and
the negative-ideal solution (the worst level). The positive
solution is the best solution that satisfies the most required
criteria, and the opposite is the negative-ideal solution. The
VIKOR method could rank, improve and determine the
difference of negative and positive ideal solutions between
services/utilities of the existing service systems of VTS.
When calculating the distance between the ideal solution
and the proposed service systems of VTS, the scores of
each criterion should be summarized. The gaps between the
consumers’ most satisfied one and most unsatisfied one is
also analyzed, with respect to services/utilities of the
existing service systems of VTS. The VIKOR method was
started with the form of the
Lp
 metric
, which was used
as an aggregating function in a compromise programming
method and it developed the multi-criteria measure for
compromise ranking [15, 16]. VIKOR provided a maximum
group utility of the “majority” and a minimum individual
regret of the “opponent”. The compromise solutions could
be the base for negotiation, involving the decision makers’
preferences by criteria weights (Figure 3).

THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF MARKET POSITION FOR
VTS SERVICE SYSTEMS
As shown in Table X and Figure 4, the Type-G (0.524,
0.549) is the highest value in VSI and PSI, and Type-G is
located in the common and luxurious (H, H). The Type-A
(0.426, 0.492) and Type-O (0.423, 0.492) are the lowest
value of PSI, the Type-O (0.423, 0.759) is the lowest value
of VSI. Besides, the Type-T is located in the low price to
catching market (L, H) and the Type O and Type-A are
located in the no or limited choice (L, L). Accounting
research result, the development trend of VTS service
systems/device that generally move from the no or limited
choice (L, L) to the low price to catching market by
improving the PSI (Price satisfaction index), then move to
the common and luxurious (H, H) through improving the
VSI (Value satisfaction index). The development strategy
of VTS service systems is to reduce the price of VTS
service system, and to increase the value of VTS service
system. Therefore, Continuing conducting product design
innovation and service process improvement can increase
the customers’ satisfaction degree and create new value
position helping VTS service operators to leave red sea
market of high price competition into the blue sea market of
low price competition.

CONCLUSIONS
Vehicles telematics system (VTS) market includes five
service operators (hardware suppliers, software operators,
vehicles telematics system service operators, digital content
service
providers
and
telecommunications
service
operators), and the VTS service operators pay a key role in
systems integration for diverse VTS system services. In
some successful experience of service operators, there is a
huge challenge about how to understand customers’ needs.
In the service system of VTS, the European and American
VTS
service operators laid particular stress on the service
function regarding safety and security services, while the
Japanese VTS
service operators focus on navigation and
map information services. VTS system service operators
gradually
strengthen
the
service
function
about
communication and information services, and multimedia
and entertainment services in the recent years. Taiwan's
VTS service operators adopt open hybrid system based on
Japanese navigation technologies and on Taiwanese users’
needs such as high rate of car theft, frequent stowaway
execution. Therefore, Taiwan's VTS service operators
provide
various
service
functions
with
location
and
navigation services and safety and security utilities such as
guarding against burglary, assuring the safety, detection of
vehicles towing. Considering the regional differences of
market characteristics, the users’ needs will be differed
based on their environment. This study deliberates about the
VTS service system development of some developed
regions such as America, Europe, Japan, and analyzes the
local condition and attributes of Taiwan. This study tries to
find a suitable direction of VTS service market based on the
VTS service system survey, and compares four regions
commercial
VTS
service
systems
including
America,
Europe, Japan and Taiwan.
