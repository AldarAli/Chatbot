Abstract— The public sector’s role as mandatory service 
provider is to produce effective services for users, and to 
make compliance uncomplicated and straightforward. 
However, at present, public sector services appear to not 
meet these user expectations. The purpose of this 
research is to explore ways to enhance digital adoption 
in the public sector by further understanding who these 
users are, when and why they seek assistance, and the 
various potential outcomes post-assistance. Evidence to 
support this research will be provided via a case study 
from the Australian Taxation Office. This research 
project will be presented in three sections. Firstly, the 
researchers describe a conceptual model they have 
created, which places the user at the centre of the 
research and policy direction. Secondly, results and 
some critical findings will be presented, of a pilot study 
which was conducted to test the model on a small scale. 
Thirdly, the researchers will outline planned extended 
research which proposes to validate the pilot findings 
and explore the service users in greater detail. The 
extended research utilises additional demographic data 
to better understand the greater system dynamics. This 
research is ongoing and forms part of a PhD 
dissertation.

Ecosystems.  
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Increasing digital service adoption and the provision of 
a better digital client experience is vital to any successful 
government digital service platform. To achieve this 
success, research needs to identify and understand the users, 
including understanding why users seek assistance, and 
leverage points to maximise the users’ capacity to complete 
their interaction. A recent study conducted by the Australian 
Digital Transformation Office [1] suggests that there is 
evidence that further research is required to address how to 
maximise digital service adoption. Improved understanding 
of issues users may have with specific public sector digital 
services has become increasingly important in Australia, 
with changes to service provision from in-person/call centre 
to digital. This research seeks to address knowledge gaps 
regarding who the users are, why they need assistance and 
where self-service assistance can be provided. This research 
will be based on a case study conducted by the Australian 
Taxation Office (ATO). Through consultation with the ATO 
staff and examining company and academic literature, a 
clear gap was identified between what was known about 
mandatory digital service use and the users required to use 
them. 
Currently, 
standard 
methods 
for 
evaluating 
government services include interviewing or surveying 
users about services provided. This often results in biased 
results, as users often display expected behaviours [2]-[4]. 
Accordingly, research thus far has ignored a multitude of 
factors that impact adoption, and failed to identify barriers 
to adoption within a mandatory environment, and how 
different experiences with digital services can impact long-
term adoption and when and why users seek assistance.  
The creation of the Digital Continuity Policy 2020 
mandated digital first platforms for all public sector services 
[5], causing significant challenges to service providers and 
users. For the purposes of this research, mandatory users are 
defined as citizens who meet certain characteristics, which 
including earning an income in Australia, and submit an 
annual income tax return to the ATO. Research into digital 
adoption does not engage with the concept of mandatory 
services and the impacts of digital first policies on users 
required to engage with digital services to comply with 
legislative requirements [6].  To address these concerns, 
analysis techniques should be holistic and adaptive, in order 
to incorporate an understanding of how a variety of factors 
can prevent or encourage users to go digital. This research 
utilises a holistic approach to analyse factors impacting 
users through the application of Systems Thinking and the 
testing 
of 
a 
conceptual 
model 
for 
analysing 
stakeholders/users in a multidimensional manner.  
This paper is divided into six sections. Section one 
contains the introduction, section two presents the literature 
reviewed, section three discusses the research significance, 
section four outlines the research methods undertaken, 
section five highlights the results to date, and section six 
offers some conclusions.  
II. 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
Citizens expect digital services to be useful, accessible, 
easy to use and functional [7]. The goal of eGovernment is 
to create additional public value, by increasing stakeholder 
inclusiveness and encourage equal access to services [8].

The purpose of utilising e-government is to provide 
transparency and cooperation, improve government process, 
and provide digital services [9], all of which require 
continuous monitoring and assessment [8]. Furthermore, 
more needs to be done to understand the structural 
inequalities that affect the use of digital services, to prevent 
the issues becoming more intense and ingrained [10]. There 
is also a concern that social inequalities may be perpetuated 
online, given that those who are already in more privileged 
positions are more likely to use the medium [11]. These 
important factors highlight the value of researching barriers 
which prevent individuals from accessing government 
services.  
The most common definition of adoption refers to 
continuous use of a digital service or innovation [12]. For 
digital services to be sustainable, they should be appealing 
and useful [13]. Shareef et al found in their research that 
perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived 
security and perceived reliability positively impact an 
individual’s intention to adopt digital services [14]. Hargitti 
argued that not all online activities are equally important to 
enhancing one’s human, financial and social capital [15]. 
This research determined that there is a strong relationship 
between level of education and type of digital services used 
[15]. Access to technology no longer determines inequalities 
alone – exposure to experiences which increase the digital 
participation and literacy are vital [15].  
Research highlights four kinds of barriers to digital 
access: (1) lack of elementary digital experience due to lack 
of interest, (2) no computer access, (3) lack of digital skills, 
and (4) lack of significant usage opportunities [16]. Further 
barriers identified within the literature include lack of 
internet access, lack of awareness, language, user friendly 
websites, lack of trust, and security fears [9]. Researchers 
still need to understand the digital divide within the social, 
psychological, cultural and non-technological access context 
[17]. The challenge going forward is to determine the 
resources and functions that can be developed and provided 
to support positive user behaviour [7]. eGovernment aims to 
provide information and public services to citizens and 
encourages citizens to participate in different platforms [7].  
Existing research does not focus on the multitude of 
factors impacting users’ capacity to adopt and participate in 
a mandatory digital ecosystem, and there is little discussion 
around how digital adoption in mandatory spaces is 
different from adoption in other contexts. A thorough 
review of the literature identified the factors within a user’s 
environment which have a significant impact on a user’s 
capacity or willingness to adopt digital services within a 
mandatory space. For this research project, numerous 
different ecosystem styles were analysed, including digital, 
business, technology and innovation ecosystems.  
Through the creation of a testable conceptual model, it 
is proposed that through the use of client-centric research, 
policy can better understand and support different 
stakeholders/users.

This conceptual model was created through the 
application of numerous stakeholder analysis techniques, 
combined with an analysis of the environment (based on

Thinking 
analysis) 
and 
digital 
ecosystems 
literature. The proposed conceptual model is highlighted in 
Figure 1. The four elements which capture the system are 
the Environment (including interactions with other people), 
Digital Ecosystem (including how digital products are 
accessed), Mandatory Services (including how they are 
different to voluntary services), and Public Sector (including 
the elements that make the services mandatory). Along with 
results of further research, this will be used to build an in-
depth model. 
III. 
SIGNIFICANCE AND RESEARCH GAP 
This research will extend current understanding about 
the variety of factors impacting mandatory digital service 
adoption, bridging a gap in knowledge. The conceptual 
model in Figure 1 tests how policy can put the user at the 
centre, and help develop a better understanding of the user. 
Understanding digital adoption in the mandatory space 
should include how, why and when users adopt digital 
services, and in contrast when, how and why they do not, 
and in the latter case how they fulfil their mandatory 
compliance obligations. This research is based on 
understanding the outcomes of those users who actively 
seek assistance when using digital services, mapping the 
links between non-digital and digital issues, while also 
measuring outcomes. The application of a Systems Thinking 
approach will be applied to provide a more transparent view 
of the system, to understand the process holistically, per 
individual components and key interactions within the 
system. Therefore, the overarching aim of this research is to 
understand areas which may require intervention or can be 
leveraged to assist citizens adopt public sector mandatory 
digital services. This research proposes the model in Figure 
1 to be tested through the collection and analysis of 
supporting data. 
Previous research has applied a client-centric view to 
researching digital adoption; however, based only on 
voluntary digital services or those provided by the private

sector [18]-[22]. Prior research has identified that there are a 
number of socioeconomic, cultural and intrinsic values that 
influence whether or not an individual will accept digital 
services [23]-[26]. This has been, to a certain degree, 
ineffectively applied to public sector research on digital 
adoption [1]. When mandatory digital services have been 
researched, the outcomes commonly revolve around 
acceptance of e-government services; results are based on 
survey responses specifically related to trust and innovation 
factors [27]-[31].  Previous research does not appear to have 
addressed the issues around adoption in a mandatory space, 
why users do and do not adopt these services, and how they 
comply with legislative obligations when they do not utilise 
digital services. Research has not included in-depth 
exploration about why users seek assistance when utilising 
digital services from the supplying entity and the outcomes 
post seeking assistance. This is critical for successfully 
adopting and sustaining commitment in mandatory digital 
systems. Previous models too, fail to explore the issues and 
environments associated with mandatory digital service 
adoption. The application of the proposed model helps fill 
some of these gaps and provide greater clarity on these 
potential blockers.  
IV. 
APPROACH 
The research approach used in this research has been 
exploratory in nature, allowing for ongoing developments as 
the findings developed. The researchers initially had a 
liberal set of goals, with the intention of allowing the data 
collected to further refine the specific questions, direction 
and analyses. The data collection was implemented in two 
phases. First, a pilot study was conducted to determine the 
validity of the proposed model for stakeholder/user 
inclusiveness. The second phase involved the data collection 
for the extended research Only the pilot results are included 
in this paper, with plans in place to examine the second 
phase with different analysis techniques.  
A. Data 
Two qualitative datasets were collected during the pilot 
and extended research period. The pilot study was 
conducted over a 3-week period (July 2017) to validate the 
conceptual model. This was conducted by 2 researchers, 
located in an ATO shopfront environment (in-person 
assistance) in South Australia; 234 cases were collected. 
The second and more extensive dataset was collected by 11 
ATO officers over 4 weeks (July 2018). Data was collected 
from numerous ATO call centres across Australia, with 
3990 valid cases collected. From the 3990 cases collected, 
additional quantitative data was obtained. This data includes 
three years’ worth of results for callers’ including their 
income, income type, occupation and how they lodged their 
tax return. This data was joined to the qualitative data to 
provide a richer picture of the callers, specifically 
identifying why they sought assistance and how that 
impacted their lodgement. All data was anonymised to 
ensure confidentiality and anonymity of participant data.  
B. Methods 
Two qualitative methodologies were applied to explore 
the data – firstly, Gioia’s method for qualitative rigour and 
secondly, a Systems Thinking Approach. This enabled the 
researches to find structure in unstructured qualitative 
forms, as it is a systematic approach. Firstly, the Gioia 
method [32] [33] requires the researcher to step back, and 
then categorise the accounts into three different phases 
(First, Second and Third order). The first order, ‘Concepts’, 
is the ‘voice of the user’ (also known as ‘voice of the 
customer’).  The second order, ‘concerns and statements’, 
identifies specific sentences from participants which are 
then grouped together to discover the themes and patterns in 
events and accounts.  These create Themes that are more 
generalised underlying explanatory dimensions, to test 
consistency and patterns [32] [33]. Finally, the third order 
‘aggregate dimensions’, identifies the generic themes 
encompassing all of the first and second order data [32] 
[33]. 
Significance 
was 
measured 
through 
counting 
occurrences of first, second and third order elements to 
identify themes and patterns throughout the different 
accounts. The patterns in the text were then linked by 
connections, highlighting key features and emergent 
concepts or themes that require further analysis. 
Secondly, Systems Thinking analysis was applied to 
systematically identify and order findings into their 
respective components of the process [34]. This helped to 
identify the points within the process and system that are 
causing the most issues and where support can be 
implemented. Systems Thinking was used to visually 
convert the findings into simplified figures that highlight 
key emergent findings. Our analysis will focus on profiling 
participants to identify relationships between why users seek 
assistance, their demographics and how/if they lodged a tax 
return.  
V. 
RESULTS 
Results from the pilot demonstrate that there are many 
components of the system which are hindering the 
successful adoption and use of ATO digital services for 
users lodging tax returns. Specifically, without support 
many taxpayers would have been unable or would have 
struggled to lodge their documents.

As highlighted in Figure 2, this is the first view of the 
system where intervention points are possible. Lessons 
learnt from this research demonstrate that, on average, 
taxpayers who sought assistance required it for more than 
one element of their tax return. Systems analysis 
demonstrates that there are more than one intervention 
points pre/during/post lodgement that should be leveraged 
for education and assistance. However, this research does 
understand that not everyone will be able to lodge digitally, 
and not everyone who needs help seeks help. For the 
purpose of client experience, it is important to recognise that 
negative experiences within the system will impact 
willingness to obtain assistance and advice in the future. 
Descriptive analysis of the pilot data indicates that of 
the individuals who sought assistance utilising digital 
platforms for lodgement, the most frequent age group was 
18-29 year olds (53.5%). This finding was unexpected. The 
other significant trend within this data was the high 
frequency of the pilot population seeking assistance who 
were in different life transitions (25.65%) (e.g., rental 
properties, deductions, income sources, retirement, etc.). Of 
the pilot population, those who had self-reported language 
barriers (17% of those seeking assistance) were more 
inclined to utilise paper solutions for lodgement rather than 
digital means. There is a concern that this will deter them 
from utilising digital means, and future research will 
determine whether or not digital or non-digital lodgement 
patterns are habitual, and if there are identifiable clusters of 
the population or demographics that are more inclined to 
behave in this manner. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3 Extended research - Lodgement Process Assistance Points 
 
Results from the extended research are still under 
development; however, preliminary results show how 
detailed follow-up research can improve the level of detail 
of the lodgement process systems view diagram, as shown 
in Figure 3. The current findings show that this process of 
analysis provides a more transparent view of the system, 
identifying the issues and points of the system that can be 
leveraged. This research has highlighted the links between 
digital and non-digital components of the tax system, e.g., 
understanding of tax and needing assistance. Figure 3 
highlights the level of complexity associated with digital 
services in mandatory environments, especially when 
considering how adoption is impacted considerably by a 
multitude of factors. Implications of the extended lodgement 
process in Figure 3 are still under exploration.  
This research is ongoing with additional research 
underway, including modelling of key outcomes, with a 
number of analytical techniques being explored. As is, the 
research continues to justify and validate the model outlined 
in 
Figure 
1. 
Suitable methodologies to support the 
quantitative data analysis are currently being explored. This 
research can be applied to other areas of the public sector, 
especially those areas that have or are introducing 
mandatory digital services. With the transition of private 
sector entities to digital first platforms, the financial services 
sector, for example, could benefit from this style of 
research.  
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
This research seeks to understand the different barriers 
affecting adoption of mandatory digital services. The 
preliminary results highlight findings that need to be 
explored in further detail. The conceptual model will assist 
in identifying the interactions between the different 
elements outlined within the model, as well as increased 
details built within a systems view. Through ongoing data 
analysis and future papers, this model will be tested further.  
Future research will identify specific areas of assistance that 
are required going forward.
