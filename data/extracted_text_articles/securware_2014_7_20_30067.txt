Abstract—Position-based cryptography has attracted lots of 
researchers’ attention. In the mobile Internet, there are many 
position-based security applications. For the first time, one new 
conception, threshold proxy signature based on positions is 
proposed. Based on one secure positioning protocol, one model 
of threshold proxy signature based on positions is proposed. In 
the model, positioning protocols are bound to threshold proxy 
signature tightly, not loosely. Further, one position-based 
threshold proxy signature scheme is designed, its correctness is 
proved, and its security is analyzed. As far as we know, it is the 
first threshold proxy signature scheme based on positions.

 INTRODUCTION 
In the setting of mobile Internet, position services and 
position-binding security applications become one key 
requirement, especially the latter. Position services include 
position inquiring, secure positioning and so forth. Position 
inquiring consists of inquiring your own position and 
positioning of other entities. The technology of inquiring your 
own position has Global Positioning System (GPS) and other 
satellite service system. The technology of positioning of 
other entities has radar and so on [2]-[6]. As we all know, the 
positioning of other entities is more challenging one. Position-
binding security applications such as position-based 
encryption and position-based signature and authentication 
are increasingly necessary for us. For example, when one 
mobile user sends messages to one specific position, which is 
one either physical address or logical address (such as Internet 
Protocol address), it is desirable for us that only the user who 
is at that address or has been at that address can receive and 
decrypt messages encrypted. Even if other mobile users at that 
position receive messages, but they can’t decrypt them. Or the 
specified receiver at that position due to some reasons 
temporarily leaves his/her position, it will not be able to 
receive or decrypt messages any more. In addition, if the 
specified receiver at that place moves to another place, and 
he/she hopes he/she can receive messages at the new place. 
Take one application about position-based signature and 
authentication as an example. One mobile or fixed user signs 
messages at one place and sends them to another mobile user. 
The receiver can receive the signed message and verify 
whether or not received messaged is indeed signed at the place 
by the signer. Even if the signer moves to another address, it 
will not affect the receiving and verification of signed 
messages.  
Currently, the research on position-based cryptography 
focuses on secure positioning about which some work had 
been proposed [1]. These positioning protocols are based on 
one-dimension, two-dimension or three-dimension spaces, 
including traditional wireless network settings [1], as well as 
quantum setting [7]-[9]. It seems to us that position-based 
cryptography should integrate secure positioning with 
cryptographic primitives. If only or too much concentrating 
on positioning protocols, perhaps we will be far away from 
position-based cryptography. In other words, nowadays 
positioning is bound loosely with related security applications, 
not tightly, as results in the slow progress of position-based 
cryptography and applications. Relying on the thoughts, in the 
paper, our main contributions are as follows. 
(1)One model of threshold proxy signature based on 
positions is proposed. Position-based threshold proxy 
signature is one kind of threshold proxy signature, but a novel 
one. The definition is given and its model is constructed. In 
the meantime, its security properties are defined. 
(2)To realize the kind of threshold proxy signature, one 
secure-positioning-protocol based threshold proxy signature 
scheme is proposed and its security is analyzed as well. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 
2, the function of positioning and one secure positioning 
protocol are introduced. In Section 3, the model and definition 
of threshold proxy signature based on positions are 
constructed. One position-based threshold proxy signature 
scheme is designed in Section 4. The correctness of the 
scheme is proved in Section 5. The security of the proposed 
scheme will be analyzed in Section 6. Finally, the conclusion 
is given.

II. 
POSITION PROTOCOLS 
In this section, the function of positioning protocols and 
one secure positioning protocol are introduced. 
A. Function of Positioning Protocols 
The goal of positioning protocol is to check whether one 
position claimer is really at the position claimed by it. 
Generally speaking, in the positioning protocol, there are at 
least two participants including position claimers and verifiers, 
where the verifiers may be regarded as position infrastructure. 
According to destination of the positioning, there are two 
kinds of positioning protocol, i.e., your own position 
positioning protocol and others’ position positioning protocol. 
As of now, lots of work on your own position positioning 
protocol have been done [2]-[6]. Nevertheless, research on 
others’ positions positioning protocol is far less and there are 
still many open questions to resolve. In our model and scheme, 
we will make full use of the two varieties of positioning 
protocol. 
B. One Secure Positioning Protocol 
Here, one others’ positions secure positioning protocol is 
introduced. Compared with your own position positioning 
protocol, others’ positions positioning protocol is more 
complex. 
In this section, N. Chandran et al.’s secure positioning 
protocol in 3-dimensions is reviewed [1], which can be used 
in mobile Internet. 
In the protocol, 4 verifiers denoted by 
1

V V ,...,
V , which 
can output string 
i
X ，are used. The prover claims his/her 
position, which is enclosed in the tetrahedron defined by the 
4 verifiers. Let 1

t  be the time taken for radio waves 
to arrive at the point P from verifier

When we say that

they “meet” at P, we mean that they broadcast the messages

protocol uses a pseudorandom generator namely an ε-secure

III. 
THE MODEL OF POSITION-BASED THRESHOLD PROXY 
SIGNATURE 
    The model, definition and security properties are proposed 
in this section. 
A. The model 
In the model, there are four kinds of participants 
including the original signer (OS), the proxy signer group 
(PSG), which consists of n proxy signers

,
,...,
n}
PS PS

, 
the verifier (V) and position infrastructure (PI). OS takes 
responsibility of confirmation of position of his/her own and 
at one position delegates his/her signing power to the proxy 
signer group to sign messages at these proxy signers’ 
positions on behalf of OS. (
)
t t
 n
  or more proxy signers 
cooperate to sign one message at their individual positions 
after their positions are confirmed by PI and are the same as 
the ones in the proxy signing delegation warrant, whereas, 
less than t   proxy signers can’t. V checks that the proxy 
signature is generated by the actual proxy signers at their 
individual positions on behalf of OS. PI, which is one trusted 
third party, is used to provide position services for the related 
parties. The model is illustrated in Figure 1.

B. Definition 
Position-based threshold proxy signature. 
Simply speaking, the kind of proxy signature combines 
proxy signature, threshold proxy signature and positioning 
protocols as one single scheme. It is mainly composed of 
three modules of threshold proxy signing power delegation, 
threshold proxy signing and threshold proxy signature 
verifying. In the module of threshold proxy signing power 
delegation, OS first sends one request to PI for the purpose of 
delegating signing power to PSG. Then PI runs one 
positioning protocol to confirm OS and the proxy signers’ 
positions. If their positions are valid, PI sends acknowledge 
to OS and the proxy signers. After that, PI produces proxy 
signing key packages for individual proxy signers and sends 
them to each proxy signer. OS produces proxy delegation 
warrant to all proxy signers. In the module of threshold proxy

signing, each proxy signer who wants to actually attend to 
sign has to first check that his/her position is at the designated 
position, which is specified in the proxy delegation warrant. 
If it holds, each actual proxy signer can use his/her proxy 
signing key package to sign the message for only once and 
sends individual proxy signature to one clerk who collects all 
individual signatures and generates final threshold proxy 
signature. In the module of threshold proxy signature 
verifying, V uses OS and all proxy signers’ identities and 
positions to check the validity of threshold proxy signatures 
based on positions. 
Remark 1. During the module of threshold proxy signing 
power delegation, if OS and all of proxy signers don’t run 
positioning protocols with PI to confirm their own positions, 
OS is unable to delegate his/her signing power to the proxy 
signer group. Moreover, if neither OS nor each proxy signer 
can confirm its position with PI, OS can’t fulfill his 
delegation of signing power. In the module of threshold proxy 
signing, if each of proxy signers doesn’t perform positioning 
protocols to check the validity of his/her position, he/she is 
not able to generate individual proxy signature by individual 
proxy signature key package. That’s to say, before the proxy 
signer group wants to sign one message on behalf of OS, each 
member has to confirm its position. Even if each proxy signer 
passes individual position’s confirmation, he/she can sign one 
message for only once. During the module of threshold 
signature verifying, it is unnecessary for the verifier to 
confirm OS and all proxy signers’ positions.   
In the model, it will be seen that we regard the three 
modules as three primitives. Therefore, in our model, the 
positioning protocol is bound tightly with the delegation of 
signing power and threshold proxy signature generation, 
instead loosely. 
Thus, in the model, the positioning-based threshold proxy 
signature is composed of four primitives:Initialization, 
PropTProxyDelegate, 
PropTProxySign 
and 
PropTProxyVerify.

k   and 
outputs system master key mk  and public parameter pp  , in 
the meantime, the system distributes user identity

PropTProxyDelegate. When OS wants to delegate his/her 
signing power to the proxy signer group, OS first sends 
his/her requests to PI. After PI gets OS’s request, PI checks

The model is illustrated in Figure 2. 
C. Security Properties of Position-Based Threshold Proxy 
Signature 
Besides security properties of threshold proxy signature, 
this kind of threshold proxy signature has the security 
properties as follows. 
(1) Positioning protocol binding. In the module of 
PropTProxyDelegate, without confirming of positions of OS 
and all proxy signers by running positioning protocol with PI, 
OS is unable to fulfill his/her delegation of signing power. In 
addition, the proxy signing key package of each proxy signer 
produced by PI is tightly bound with positioning protocol, as 
means that if all of proxy signers want to use proxy signing 
key packages, each of them has to run positioning protocol 
with PI. In the module of PropTProxySign, if the proxy signer 
group needs to sign one message on behalf of OS, in order to 
get the proxy signing key (implicitly), each of proxy signers 
has to make use of individual proxy signing key package to 
run positioning protocol with PI. If each of proxy signers is 
indeed at the position specified in the delegation warrant dw, 
he/she will be able to obtain (implicitly) the proxy signing 
key to sign one message for once only. Actually, each of 
proxy signers can’t get real individual proxy signing key, 
which is encapsulated in the proxy signing key package.  
Remark 2. In the model, for each time, if the proxy 
signers want to cooperate to sign messages on behalf of OS, 
each of them has to run positioning protocol with PI to 
confirm the validity of individual positions. One maybe 
thinks we should make use of one-time digital signing 
algorithm or one-time signing private key. In fact, in the 
model, using one-time signing key is optional. On one hand, 
if the model uses fixed signed private key encapsulated in the 
proxy signing key package, each of proxy signers can’t use it 
at will and can sign one message for only once. If the proxy 
signer group wants to sign another message, all of them still 
need to communicate with PI once again. In the sense, each 
of proxy signers actually has no the knowledge of its own 
proxy signing private key. On the other hand, if one-time 
signing private keys are used in the model, it is reasonable. 
That is to say, for each time, each proxy signing key package 
will release one random proxy signing key. In addition, 
because position-based applications are closely related with 
position instant authentication or confirmation, we think that 
position-based cryptography should be deeply researched 
with respect to online cryptography, which focuses on instant 
cryptographic algorithms and security processing. Of course, 
in the eyes of ours, it is one open question as well.  
IV. 
ONE POSITION-BASED THRESHOLD PROXY 
SIGNATURE SCHEME 
In this section, one position-based threshold proxy 
signature scheme, in which there exist one original signer and 
n  proxy signers, is proposed. The scheme mainly includes 
four kinds of participants:the original signer (still denoted as 
OS), the proxy signer group (PSG)

the verifier (V) and PI. PI will make use of the secure 
positioning protocol mentioned in Section 2.2 to provide 
services of position for the original signer and n   proxy 
signers. In addition, PI will be regarded as the trusted third 
party and system authority. The scheme is composed of four 
primitives:Initialization, 
PropTProxyDelegate, 
PropTProxySign and PropTProxyVerify. As primitives, it 
means that they either fully run or do nothing. The four 
primitives are detailed as follows. 
A. Initialization 
PI takes as input secure parameter 1k   and outputs system 
master key mk  and public parameter pp , at the same time, 
PI distributes user identity 
i
ID  for user i . Here, rewrite the 
primitive as Initialization ( ,

signing key package 
i
pskp   for executing positioning 
protocol to confirm the validity of his/her position

with PI.  
Step 2. If 
i '
PS s   current position 
PosPSi
  is identical to the 
one in the delegation warrant dw, proxy signing key package 
i
pskp  prompts 
i
PS  to input the message m  to

proxy signing key package

pskp   produces the individual 
proxy signature

position

 is not identical to the one in the delegation 
warrant dw,

signing and stops (

CORRECTION OF THE ABOVE SCHEME 
In fact, the proof of correctness of above scheme is simple. 
The following theorem about it is given.

that the threshold proxy signature is generated by the actually

VI. 
SECURITY ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED SCHEME 
In the proposed scheme, three sorts of technology, i.e., 
secure positioning protocol including others’ positions 
positioning protocol and your own position positioning, 
proxy signature and threshold proxy signature, are used. That 
means, the security of the proposed scheme depends on the 
security of used three kinds of technology. Because the 
proposed scheme or the model is one component framework, 
it is proper that its security is analyzed by the Universal 
Composition (UC) framework [10]. That is, by constructing 
the components of proxy signature model, digital signature 
model and positioning protocol model, and attack modeling 
from internal attackers, external attackers and conspiracy 
attackers, the security analysis of the above scheme can be 
made. The internal attackers are from the original signer and 
proxy signers; the external attackers can be any software 
systems or entities; the conspiracy attackers mainly are 
among proxy signers, partially between both the original 
signer and some malicious proxy signers. By adding these 
models into the idealistic environment in UC framework, if 
the security of the scheme in the idealistic environment can 
be proved secure, its security in the real environment can be 
proved as well.  Its security analysis will be deeply done in 
the further study. 
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In the paper, according to security requirements of the 
mobile Internet, one model of position-based threshold proxy 
signature is constructed. Its definition, security properties and 
construction are given. As far as we know, it is the first model 
of combining positioning protocols, proxy signature and 
threshold proxy signature. In the meantime, one position-
based threshold proxy signature scheme is proposed and 
analyze its security. We will further improve relevant models 
and schemes. It is believed by us that the research on 
positioning-protocol-based cryptographic models or schemes 
will become one focus in the setting of the mobile Internet.
