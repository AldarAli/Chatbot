Abstract—To meet the learning needs of teachers and students, 
a professional learning course was developed on newly 
introduced instructional technology, Microsoft Office 365 
Suite. This poster presentation shares the development, 
implementation, and impact of the professional learning 
course. 
Keywords-professional learning; backward design. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
New for 2015-2016 school year, the West Allegheny 
School District introduced the Microsoft Office 365 Suite of 
online tools to both staff and students.  Over the summer 
months, the school’s technology specialists dedicated 
countless hours to switching over each staff member and 
creating student accounts within the new Office 365 
platform.  After making the switch, administration 
recognized a need to provide training on how to best use this 
instructional technology within the classroom. 
II. 
DESIGN OF COURSE 
To meet this need, a professional learning course called 
Integrating Office 365 Into Your Curriculum was developed 
using the backward design model (see Appendix B for 
course layout).  The course was designed to introduce the 
learner to each of the tools available through the Office 365 
Suite including: Email, Tasks, People, Calendar, OneNote, 
Class Notebook, OneDrive, Online Word, Excel, & 
PowerPoint, Video, Sway, and Yammer. All learning 
objectives and instructional methodologies included as part 
of the course were aligned to the International Society for 
Technology Education (ISTE) Standards for Teachers and 
Danielson’s Framework for Teaching.  Throughout the 
course, teachers were required to align their work to the PA 
or national standards for their content area.   
Each session was designed to include not only learning 
how to use the focus feature, but also best practices for 
integrating the technology into the curriculum which were 
discussed in detail during the sessions.  Throughout the 
course the learners were expected to collaborate with 
colleagues, to increase their exposure and the quality of 
their lesson designs.  As the course progressed, the learning 
activities were designed to challenge the learner to achieve 
higher by developing increasingly productive lessons that 
showed growth in student learning.  
The learning was designed to be assessed through formal 
and informal observations by both administration and peers 
as well as self-reflection and student feedback.  It was the 
ultimate goal of the course that the learner developed a firm 
understanding of each of the tools available and how 
integrating the instructional technologies within their 
curriculum impacted student learning. 
III. 
CONCLUSION 
This poster presentation will describe the development 
and implementation of the course, the learning outcomes 
and activities for each session, and share the testimonials of 
the teachers as a result of the implementation of the 
instructional technologies.  Additionally, the presenter will 
provide evidence to support the design of the course linked 
to research-based best practices including Gagne’s Nine 
Levels of Learning, the backward design model, and the 
SAMR model.  The appendices included at the end of this 
paper provide a detailed layout of the backward design 
process followed for the entire course (Appendix A) and 
each session (Appendix B).

If the desired result is for the learner to… 
Understand… 
How to use office 365 tools within his/her content area to improve the 
learning of his/her students. 
 
And thoughtfully consider the question… 
How can integrating technology into the curriculum enhance student 
learning and positively impact achievement? 
 
While considering distinguished practice in the Framework for Teaching 
(Act 82), particularly the listed areas: 
1a. Demonstrating Knowledge of Content and Pedagogy 
1d. Demonstrating Knowledge of Resources 
1e. Designing Coherent Instruction 
2c. Managing Classroom Procedure 
2e. Organizing Physical Space 
3c. Engaging Students in Learning 
3d. Using Assessment in Instruction 
4a. Reflecting on Teaching 
4b. Maintaining Accurate Records 
4e. Growing and Developing Professionally 
 
And showing mastery in the following ISTE Standards for Teachers: 
1. Facilitate and inspire student learning and creativity 
2. Design and develop digital age learning experiences and assessments 
3. Model digital age work and learning 
4. Promote and model digital citizenship and responsibility 
5. Engage in professional growth and leadership 
 
As well as the PA Core Standards and/or national standards that 
correspond with his/her content area. 
 
Stage 2 
Then evidence is needed of the learner’s ability to… 
Use each of the office 365 tools in his/her teaching practice within 
his/her content area. 
Reflect on his/her teaching practice and identify areas of strength as well 
as areas for growth. 
 
Then, the tasks to be assessed need to include… 
Implementation of office 365 tools within instructional practices. 
Impact of instructional technology on student learning. 
Reflection of teaching practice and student learning. 
Stage 3 
Then, the learning activities need to help the learner… 
Understand how to use and integrate each of the office 365 tools in 
his/her instructional practice. 
Design quality lessons using one or more of the office tools. 
Work collaboratively with colleagues to develop lessons that integrate 
instructional technology. 
Implement designed lessons then gather student feedback and students’ 
reflection of learning as a result of the lesson. 
Reflect on implemented lessons and student learning to improve 
teaching practice.
