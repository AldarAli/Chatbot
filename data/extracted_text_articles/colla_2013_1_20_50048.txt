Abstract—Learning in the cloud can be a lonely activity for 
self-directing and self-organizing learners. Lack of sustained 
learner motivation can lead to less effective, less bond-creating 
learning experiences. By providing collaborative project-based 
learning opportunities these shortcomings can be overcome. A 
service design is introduced for the onset of collaborative 
project-based learning and team formation in the cloud, based 
on learning materials in the cloud, project definitions and 
characteristics, and learner ‘knowledge’, ‘personality’ and 
‘preferences’. The article specifies how the data required by 
the design can be gathered. Team formations rules are deduced 
from existing team formation research. They steer the team 
formation process towards facilitating learning, creative 
problem solving or increased productivity outcomes. The rules 
are implemented in three team formation equations. 
Deployment of the equations on a set of test data demonstrates 
the effectiveness of the team formation service.

 INTRODUCTION 
Nowadays, everyone with a connection to the Internet 
can learn from the cloud of knowledge it provides. The 
individual learners freely using the resources available are 
considered to be self-directing and self-organising. But 
individual learners can find it difficult to remain motivated 
[1]. The introduction of collaborative project-based learning 
can help overcome the drawbacks of individual learning. 
Project-based learning is considered to be motivating, bond-
creating and effective [2] [3]. However, how are such teams 
of cloud learners formed in the absence of human agents 
such as teachers? To address this need, we present a design 
for a service that can support these learners to set up project-
based activities and form teams.  
Prior research indicates that for project-based learning to 
deliver optimal results, experts should form the teams [19] 
[20] [21], using their knowledge about the learners. As these 
experts are not readily available in the cloud, our design aims 
to mimic expert behaviour, but also takes into account 
learner self-direction and self-organisation. The concept of 
Fit [16] [22] is used to indicate whether a team of learners 
(in its unique combination of knowledge, personality and 
preferences) is suitable to perform a specific project. 
 
 
 
Figure 1.  The team formation model 
Following the team formation model depicted in Fig. 1 
[4], our service is designed to work based on a knowledge 
representation of learning materials in some knowledge 
domain in the cloud. Such a representation can be created 
with language technologies such as Latent Sematic Analysis 
(LSA) [18]. In [23] the authors demonstrated that an LSA-
based software tool is capable of fitting job descriptions to 
people’s knowledge and learning materials.  
The project-based learning and team formation process 
can be started by a learner or other project initiator by 
submitting a project definition (which details the project’ 
aims), and the project characteristics (such as the preferred 
team size, duration, etc.) to the service.  
The following is an example from the perspective of a 
prospective team member of how we envision the service 
can work: “May 2013: Emma recently started her new job at 
the microelectronics department. For the first two months 
her main task was to strengthen her knowledge in this 
domain. She decided to follow a highly recommended 
MOOC course. On top of the regular lectures and other 
materials, the MOOC also offered a project wall with the 
possibility to apply for a project assignment. The 
assignments varied from assisting peer students to 
participating in small and large projects proposed by peer 
students, companies and research institutes. The larger 
projects followed an automated, open procedure to select the 
best applicants. Emma selected a project on bio-chip design. 
The project was an interdisciplinary project to be performed

by at least 4 persons. She could apply by sending in a brief 
summary of around 100 words on her knowledge and skills 
with regard to a pre-defined list of topics, filling out her 
preferences (on language, availability, etc.) and taking a 
personality test. Emma decided to give it a try and sent in the 
required information and did the personality test. A few days 
later she received an invitation to participate in the project 
and contacted her fellow project members to make 
arrangements.” 
The team formation model defines that in order to assess 
whether prospective team members are suitable for a project, 
data is needed in three categories: i) knowledge, ii) 
personality, and iii) preferences. However, as the main focus 
of this paper is on how teams can be formed, we assume that 
the required data has already been gathered. Therefore, in 
Section II, we only briefly introduce how the assessments are 
designed to work. For the remainder of this article, the data 
are then assumed to be available. 
As project-based activities can have different purposes, 
in Section III we define three general team formation rules, 
which enable the team formation service to form teams that 
are aimed at increased productivity, creative problems 
solving or facilitating learning as outcomes. The rules are 
based on prior research findings about team formation. Here, 
we translated them into three team formation equations. In 
Section IV, we report on the results of the application of the 
equations to a set of test data. Finally, in Section V, the 
results are discussed, conclusions are drawn and future work 
is indicated. 
II. 
THE KNOWLEDGE, PERSONALITY AND PREFERENCES 
ASSESSMENTS 
As introduced above, the team formation for project-
based learning starts with the definition of a project related to 
a knowledge domain in the cloud. The service then deduces 
to how many and which specific topics in the domain the 
proposed project primarily refers, by using the project 
description as a query into the domain knowledge 
representation. 
Next, the fit of the prospective team members is assessed 
with respect to their knowledge, personality and preferences, 
related to other members and the knowledge requirements of 
the project. We will briefly describe these assessments: 
The knowledge assessment determines how much 
knowledge, if any, learners have available on the topics the 
project refers to. For this assessment the learners submit 
knowledge evidences, which are used as queries into the 
domain knowledge representation. 
The personality assessment uses data on learner 
personality, which are gathered through a personality test. 
The resulting learner personality profile is made up from a 
person’s conscientiousness [5] [6]. This personality construct 
consists of the personality characteristics carefulness, 
thoroughness, sense of responsibility, level of organization, 
preparedness, inclination to work hard, orientation on 
achievement, and perseverance. ‘Conscientiousness’ is 
chosen specifically because it predicts a person’s future 
performance in a team. The learner’ conscientiousness score 
is established by using the Big Five personality test [7]. We 
consider the inclusion of personality as a factor in the team 
formation process to be of particular importance as team 
formation literature shows a strong tendency to focus merely 
on knowledge as a general indicator for successful 
participation in a project, while other studies indicate that 
other factors better predict success [8].  
The preferences assessment is performed on learner data 
entered on such variables as availability for the duration of 
the project, time zone, possible collaboration languages and 
preferred tools into a learner preferences profile. The 
assessment then determines the overlap between the project 
characteristics and the learners’ project work related 
preferences. When preferences do not overlap, they 
constitute ‘condiciones sine qua non’ for inclusion in a team. 
(E.g., when one learner indicates to be available on 
Mondays, while another learner indicates to never be 
available on Mondays, their calendars are mutually exclusive 
and thus these two learners will never be matched in a team).  
It is, however, important to notice that the data gathered 
from learners is not of a static nature, but can be refreshed 
every time a learner re-enters knowledge evidence for a 
project, retakes the personality test, or updates preferences.  
As a first step in the team formation process, the 
preferences assessment can limit the number of learners to be 
considered for inclusion in a team. Learners might, however, 
negotiate preferences and re-enter them in their preferences 
profile. After this step is completed, the team formation 
process continues with the knowledge and personality data. 
III. 
DEFINITION OF THE TEAM FORMATION RULES AND 
EQUATIONS FOR TARGETING SPECIFIC OUTCOMES 
Assuming the data from the knowledge and personality 
assessments and the project characteristic “preferred team 
size” are available, the team formation service combines the 
two separate sets of data by following particular team 
formation rules. In the design of these rules we take into 
account prior research findings on team formation. We sort 
the findings into three possible teamwork outcomes 
(productive problems solving, coming up with creative 
solutions, and facilitating learning) and present the general 
rules we deduced for forming teams suited to achieve these 
outcomes. Based on these general rules, we present three 
team formation equations. 
A. Teams fit for increased productivity  
We considered the follow research outcomes for the 
creation of teams aimed at increased productivity:  
a) Differences in conscientiousness scores impede task 
negotiations [9]; 
b) Members of productive teams should be capable and 
conscientious and must have domain knowledge [10].  
The general team formation rule we deduce from these 
findings is: Productivity is fostered when team members 
show 
high 
levels 
of 
conscientiousness 
and 
have 
supplementary high knowledge on the project topics.  
This rule is translated into the team formation equation 
for productive teams (1). When applied, it determines which 
teams have the highest average knowledge scores and the 
highest average conscientiousness scores.

possible score on knowledge on a topic; Avg_Ci: Average 
conscientiousness score of all members of a team i; Max_K: 
Maximum possible score on conscientiousness; WK, WC: 
Weights. 
B. Teams fit for creative problem solving  
For the formation of creative problem solving teams, we 
considered the follow research outcomes:  
a) Too much complementary fit in knowledge can lead to 
a loss of creativity and group thinking [11];  
b) People with high conscientiousness scores tend to be 
less creative [12] [13];  
c) Groups with members that possess different 
knowledge backgrounds will be more innovative because 
they contribute from different perspectives [14];  
d) Successful research teams are heterogeneous [15].  
The general team formation rule we deduce from these 
findings is: Team creativity is fostered when team members 
have low scores on conscientiousness, while showing highly 
differentiated scores on knowledge of the project topics.  
This rule is translated into the team formation equation 
for creative teams (2). It reaches a maximum when team 
members have a maximum difference in knowledge between 
their best score and their second-best score over their own 
topic scores, and when there is a maximum difference in 
knowledge between the best score and the second best score 
on a topic. It minimises the average conscientiousness score 
in the team.

TeamSize: Number of team members; DifKt: Difference 
between the highest and next highest knowledge score on

C. Teams fit for facilitating learning 
For the formation of teams in which learning is 
facilitated, we considered that:  
a) Learning is fostered when team members provide a 
complementary fit in knowledge backgrounds and show a 
supplementary fit in personalities [16];  
b) Mutual teaching and learning are among the most 
important activities in defining and solving problems [14];  
c) There is a maximum distance in knowledge (the zone 
of proximal development, or ‘zpd’) that can be bridged when 
learning with more capable peers [17].  
From these findings we deduce as general team 
formation rule: Learning in a team is fostered when 
knowledge on the project topics is distributed over the 
members (allowing each member to learn and teach), that 
differences in the levels of topic knowledge should not be too 
high, and that the members’ conscientiousness scores should 
all be high. 
This rule is translated into the team formation equation 
for learning teams (3). It reaches a maximum for teams 
whose members can teach and learn to and from each other 
inside each topic, while having a high score on 
Conscientiousness. It optimizes the match between possible 
teachers and learners in the team by using Vygotsky’s “zone 
of proximal development” (zpd) to calculate teaching and 
learning effectiveness.

These equations were deployed on a set of test data. The 
results of this experiment are presented in Section IV. 
IV. 
RESULTS OF THE APPLICATION OF THE TEAM 
FORMATION EQUATIONS ON A SET OF TEST DATA  
For the experiment, due to space limitations in this 
article, we used only a small set of test data (See Table 1). In 
the data set, the possible score for a learner on a topic (Topic 
1 through Topic 3) ranges from 1 to 10. The knowledge 
scores are of the type ratio. The conscientiousness scores 
(Cons) range from 1 to 5. Following common practise, the 
conscientiousness scores are treated as type interval, even 
though they do relate back to the Likert scales with which 
the underlying personality characteristics were measured.  
For each possible team, the team fitness values FitP, FitC 
and FitL are represented with a value between “0” and “1”, 
with “1” indicating the highest possible fitness for that 
outcome. This allows comparing teams with respect to 
fitness over their different target outcomes. If a learner or 
other project initiator wishes to do so, weights can be used to 
prioritise 
the 
importance 
of 
e.g., 
knowledge 
over 
conscientiousness in the team formation process. However, 
in the equations below all weights sum up to 1, with weights 
set to 1 / the number of weights used in the equation. Other 
weight distributions are currently not considered. For this 
experiment, the team size was set to 4 learners per team, and 
the number of topics in the project was set to 3.

When the equations above are applied to the test data set, 
all 15 unique combinations of 4 learners are calculated for 
their fit values. The number of unique combinations is 
calculated with [n! / ((n – team_size)! * team_size!)], where 
n is the total number of learners in the data set and team_size 
is the desired number of learners in a team. 
The output in Table II lists all 15 possible teams and their 
scores on FitP, FitC and FitL. The scores in the three 
columns FitP, FitC and FitL are sorted from high to low. The 
results are truncated to three decimals. 
TABLE II.  
TEAM FORMATION SUGGESTIONS FOR 15 TEAMS OF 4 
LEARNERS, SORTED BY FITP, FITC OR FITL. 
 
The highest scoring teams for FitP, FitC and FitL show 
fitness scores of 0.606, 0.358 and 0.488 respectively. This 
indicates that a team of 4 (consisting of learners L02, L04, 
L05, and L06), created from the set of learners best fits the 
outcome increased productivity, but still only with a value of 
0.606. The best possible creative team from the set of 
learners would only receive a FitC value of 0.358, indicating 
a low probability of successfully achieving the outcome 
creative problem solving for that team. The best possible 
combination of learners for facilitating learning outcomes (a 
team with learners L02, L04, L05, and L06) scores a FitL of 
0.488, which indicates the members can only enjoy 
approximately half of the maximum learner and teaching 
effectiveness possible.  
When the results are sorted on FitP, the highest scoring 
team on FitC is found on position 12. The highest scoring 
team on FitL is found on position 4. When sorted on FitC, 
the results show the highest scoring team on FitP is found on 
position 15, while the highest scoring team on FitL is found 
on position 14. Sorting on FitL reveals that the highest 
scoring team on FitC is to be found on position 12, while the 
highest scoring team on FitP is to be found on position 2.  
The calculations’ results show how the three equations, 
through their different handling of learner knowledge and 
conscientiousness, produce teams of different compositions. 
The results reveal the best team for a particular outcome, but 
also how well a particular team fits to any of the outcomes. 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
Our take on learning in the cloud is that cloud-based 
learners are not necessarily provided, nor can easily provide 
themselves, with effective, bond-creating and motivating 
learning settings. We argued that providing these learners 
with the possibility to start project-based activities affords 
motivating collaboration opportunities [2] [3]. We therefore 
suggested a design for setting up project-based learning and 
team formation services in the domain the learners are 
interested in, based on our team formation model [4]. The 
design puts learners in control over the process of defining 
and staffing projects, thus honouring these learner’s self-
directing and self-organising behaviour, while at the same 
time being firmly rooted in team formation theory. The 
design uses the data categories ‘knowledge’, ‘personality’, 
and ‘preferences’ from the team formation model and 
describes the ways in which the data can be gathered and 
processed to arrive at team formations suggestions. A benefit 
of the design is that it is also based on personality 
characteristics, which is rarely the case in existing tools, but 
which – according to literature [8] – are highly relevant in 
the team formation process.  
In order to determine how learners should be teamed up 
based on knowledge and personality, we analysed existing 
research on team formation principles and team outcome 
criteria. From the team formation principles and outcomes 
we deduced three general team formation rules for forming 
productive, creative, or learning teams. These rules were 
formalised in team formation equations. The application of 
the equations to a set of test data demonstrated their ability to 
form teams and to suggest different teams based on the 
desired team work outcomes. It also showed the ability of the 
equations to determine for which of the three outcomes a 
team would be most suited.  
We acknowledge that knowledge might also be contained 
in other forms of evidence currently not taken into account. 
There might also be personality aspects besides the ones 
underlying the personality construct ‘Conscientiousness’

that are important predictors of a learner’ success in project 
work or that facilitate learning and working collaboratively. 
The current equation for the formation of creative teams 
favours low conscientiousness scores for all learners, based 
on [12] [13]. We do, however, plan to compare the current 
choice with other distribution methods.  
Our work for the immediate future focusses on a large 
scale experiment with the team formation service, using real 
data on knowledge from learner self-assessments and real 
data from learners on personality and preferences.
