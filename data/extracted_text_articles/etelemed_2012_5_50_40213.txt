Abstract— The paper addresses the problem of interoperation 
when searching across patient data represented in several 
medical vocabularies. This is an important issue of relevance to 
eHealth integration that will allow clinical information to be 
used in clinical research. We propose a novel way to 
semantically integrate a number of vocabularies for reference 
using a vocabulary service. 
Keywords–interoperability, 
controlled 
vocabularies,  
electronic health record. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
The increasing amount of health-related data available 
calls for new ways of analysing them together as a unified 
set, despite their heterogeneity. The interoperability of 
healthcare data is an active research topic, especially with the 
investigation of the reuse of routine clinical data for clinical 
research. In many instances, users of healthcare data are 
familiar with only one medical vocabulary. For instance, in 
the English primary care, Read Codes Version 2 (RCV2) is 
still widely used. However, activities, such as patient cohort 
identification and recruitment, often need to query 
heterogeneous patient data repositories that use different 
coding systems. In this paper, we describe our approach to 
integrating medical vocabularies semantically by providing a 
vocabulary service for vocabularies commonly used in 
Europe.  The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. 
Section II gives an overview of the medical vocabularies, 
existing work on vocabulary collections, their features and 
limitations. We then introduce our approach to an integrated 
vocabulary service in Section III, followed by details of the 
application architecture and web service implementation in 
Sections IV and V. Finally, we give our conclusions and 
future work. 
II. 
MEDICAL VOCABULARIES 
Medical vocabularies have been in use since patient 
information needed to be coded for statistical reporting, long 
before computers started being used in health care [1]. 
Different vocabularies have been created for various 
purposes and there is currently no single agreed vocabulary 
in use. The two main uses for medical vocabularies are for 
classification of diseases for statistics and reporting, and for 
the coding of clinical data for patient care. Reviews of the 
common medical terminology include the works of [2, 3]. 
The first category of vocabularies includes classifications, 
such as ICD-10 [4] and the OPCS Classification of 
Interventions and Procedures (OPCS-4) [5]. They are mainly 
used to simplify data and create abstractions for statistical 
reporting and for reimbursements [1]. The second category 
includes those that can represent detailed information as part 
of a patient’s electronic healthcare record (EHR). Examples 
include SNOMED CT [6], Read Codes [7], ICPC-2 [8]. As 
noted by Cimino [1], As a number of vocabularies are used 
to represent healthcare data, a large amount of data can 
potentially be used to support clinical research, provided 
there is an effective means to semantically integrate them. 
The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) [9] is a 
collection of many controlled vocabularies in the biomedical 
sciences, developed in an attempt to unify disparate 
vocabularies and to facilitate the sharing of medical 
knowledge [1, 3]. UMLS consists of three Knowledge 
Sources 
(Metathesaurus, 
Semantic 
Network 
and 
SPECIALIST Lexicon) and also provides a set of software 
tools to provide a mapping structure among the different 
vocabularies. The UMLS Metathesaurus is a large, multi-
purpose and multi-lingual vocabulary database, containing 
information about biomedical and health related concepts, 
synonyms and relationships among them [10]. The Semantic 
Network defines how the concepts in the Metathesaurus are 
assigned semantic types, which are broad subject categories, 
such as Disease, Finding and Clinical Drug, which are 
linked to one another through semantic relationships [11]. 
Despite the UMLS including a number of commonly used 
vocabularies, it does not support RCV2 and other widely 
used mappings and languages used in Europe.  
III. 
INTEGRATED VOCABULARY SERVICE 
Our approach to resolve some of the limitations of the 
UMLS is to develop an integrated vocabulary service, which 
will enable the support of more European terminologies and 
languages. It follows the lessons learnt and therefore  
extends on the work achieved in the ePCRN project [12], a 
US National Institute of Health project investigating an 
electronic infrastructure to support the design and 
implementation of randomised clinical trials, while 
facilitating translational research in primary care in the 
United States. 
A. Background: ePCRN 
In the ePCRN project, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
Enterprise Vocabulary Services (EVS) provided the

controlled terminology and ontology. The EVS is a project 
of the US National Cancer Institute Center for Biomedical 
Informatics and Information Technology (NCI CBIIT) and  
forms the semantic base for the Cancer Common Ontologic 
Representation Environment (caCORE), the NCI cancer 
Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG®), and the new NCI 
CBIIT 
semantic 
infrastructure 
[13], 
for 
supporting 
interoperability in translational research. As the NCI 
Metathesaurus is more US-oriented, it has fewer European 
coding systems and only supports vocabularies in the 
English language. The NCI EVS develops and supports the 
NCI Metathesaurus vocabulary source (NCIm), which is 
based on the UMLS Metathesaurus and thus provides a 
mapping of concepts to terms within multiple vocabularies. 
With the aim to include more European terminologies and 
support other European languages, we have developed an 
integrated vocabulary service (as part of the TRANSFoRm 
project [14]), using LexEVS. LexEVS is the open-source 
software package, on which the NCI EVS is built. LexEVS 
provides a comprehensive set of software and services to 
load, publish and access controlled terminologies. It  
supports a wide variety of ontology formats including 
UMLS RRF, OWL, OBO, HL7 RIM, and LexGrid XML. 
Other related works include i2b2 SHRINE [15] and the 
Ontology Lookup Service [16]. 
B. Extending UMLS with Read Codes V2 
The first version of the integrated vocabulary service 
(VS) allows RCV2 to be semantically interoperable with the 
UMLS. A customised database of RCV2 has been created to 
cater for the English primary care domain. The UK 
Terminology Centre (UKTC) [17] provides the mapping 
from RCV2 to SNOMED CT and the integrated VS is based 
on this mapping, such that RCV2 concepts can be linked to 
search on the UMLS. A subset of the UMLS Metathesaurus 
2010AA release is hosted by the integrated VS. It includes 
the NCI Thesaurus and vocabularies such as SNOMED, 
ICD10, and ICPC2, in different languages. 
IV. 
APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE 
Following a standard tiered architecture, the VS server is 
divided into three logical tiers: presentation, service and 
database tiers as depicted in Figure 1.  
A. Presentation Tier 
The presentation tier provides both a Web interface for 
web client access and a Web service interface for 
programmatic access. The web interface is designed as an 
Ajax application using Google Web Toolkit (GWT) 
technology. The Ajax web client renders the web page on the 
user’s web browser and calls a GWT Remote Procedure Call 
(RPC) servlet, on the server side, when the user initiates a 
search. The web services interface is implemented using 
Metro; the web service stack was originally developed by 
Sun Microsystems. Both the GWT RPC servlet and the web 
service component, in turn, invoke the query service, the 
entry point of the service tier, to execute a search. 
B. Service Tier 
At the service tier, the query service component 
coordinates access to different vocabulary databases and 
combines the search results together. The UMLS vocabulary 
database is accessed through LexEVS, but additional 
vocabulary databases are accessed through direct JDBC 
calls. The LexEVS runtime is a Java class library, which 
provides various APIs to access vocabulary contents in the 
LexEVS format. 
C. Database Tier 
LexEVS builds an index on the vocabulary databases 
using Lucene technology, when the vocabulary data are 
imported into the LexEVS database. During query 
execution, the LexEVS runtime consults the Lucene index 
[18], in order to speed up the data search. 
V. 
WEB SERVICE IMPLEMENTATION 
The TRANSFoRm Integrated VS provides a Web service 
API for remote programmatic access via Web Services 
Description Language (WSDL) and XML schema files. 
WSDL is an XML-based language for describing Web 
services and how to access them. It specifies the location of a 
service and the operations the service exposes. A client can 
therefore communicate with the service through the WSDL-
provided interfaces, regardless of programming language. 
A. Data Model 
Figure 2 shows the data model used in the integrated 
VS. LexEVS allows meta concepts, such as UMLS concepts

Figure 2. Integrated Vocabulary Service Data Model 
to be represented using different formats. UMLS concepts 
have equivalent concepts in different source vocabularies, 
such as SNOMED CT, ICD-10. The integrated VS uses the 
RCV2-to-SNOMED CT map to link the Read Codes V2 to 
the UMLS concepts. The user is presented with only the 
mapping from meta concept to source vocabulary concept, 
depending on the functions requested. 
B. Services 
Three basic operations are provided as a basic service: 
 
Search for a term – searches a medical term and 
returns a list of matching concepts, sorted by 
relevance. 
 
Search for a code – searches for a specific code and 
the function returns the meta concept matching the 
source vocabulary code searched.  
 
Return the semantic type for a specific code – the 
coding system may be specified. 
C. Web  Interface 
The aim for using the vocabulary service is to enable 
searching by concept, which is a key feature of the eligibility 
criteria and query formulation that can support researchers to 
identify eligible patients for their studies. Through an 
example search, we demonstrate how the vocabulary service 
Web interface works in helping to map concepts to a wide 
range of medical terminologies, hence enabling searches 
across heterogeneous healthcare data. Figure 3 shows a 
screenshot of the results for an example search for a clinical 
term (“Type II Diabetes”) on the web-based interface of the 
TRANSFoRm integrated vocabulary service. In this 
scenario, the user wants to know the RCV2 for Type II 
diabetes. The term is entered in the search box and the 
ReadCodes2 option is ticked to include the terminology as it 
is not provided within UMLS. The elements of the result are 
described as in Figure 3: 
1. UMLS concepts matching the search term are shown in 
the top left box. The search term “Type II Diabetes” is 
matched to all the available terminologies (from UMLS 
and RCV2), and 25 concepts were returned. 
2. Each UMLS concept has a unique UMLS code, semantic 
type, and definition. For instance, the selected concept is 
“Diabetes Mellitus, Non-Insulin-Dependent”, for which 
further information is displayed on the top right of Figure 
3. The UMLS Code “C0011860” provides the unique 
UMLS identifier for that concept, while the Semantic 
Type “Disease or Syndrome” indicates the subject 
category within the categories of UMLS concepts.  
3. For the selected concept, its super and sub concepts are 
rendered on the display, describing the important 
relationships with other concepts. For instance, a super 
concept for “Diabetes Mellitus, Non-Insulin-Dependent” 
is “Diabetes Mellitus”, while the sub concept “Diabetes 
mellitus type 2 in obese” is a more specific concept. 
4. Codes from hosted vocabularies (including language and 
textual description) are also provided for the selected 
concept. In Figure 3, only the vocabularies in English 
have been selected. For instance, in RCV2, three terms 
have been matched to “Type II Diabetes”. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
We have developed an integrated vocabulary service in 
response to the need for interoperability among medical 
terminologies used more commonly in Europe. Based on 
our previous work in the ePCRN project, we have extended 
the UMLS to support Read Codes Version 2, which are still 
commonly used in primary care EHR systems in England. 
The current vocabulary service implementation is based on 
LexEVS 5.1. A newer version of LexEVS, namely LexEVS 
6 has been released, which adds comprehensive support of 
emerging HL7 terminology service standards [19]. We plan 
to investigate and migrate to LexEVS 6 to align with the 
emerging standard. With a vision to support clinical 
research across Europe in the longer term, we plan to 
investigate and add more European focused. Additionally, 
vocabularies related to medication present a big challenge, 
which definitely needs significant future work.
