Abstract - The exponential services demand concerning the
Information and Communications Technology (ICT) has led to
increasingly efficient implementation techniques to satisfy the
information flow required by users. Optical Burst-Switched
Wavelength Division Multiplexing networks (OBS/WDM) are
currently set as a technology capable of supporting wide
bandwidth, allowing high information's transmission and
different types of traffic. OBS also combines the advantages of
Optical Circuit Switching (OCS) and Optical Packet Switching
(OPS). Furthermore, recent advances in optical networking
add cognitive mechanisms to any network plane, providing it
with adaptive features. From this point of view, it is possible to
carry out methods that address the problem of Dynamic
Routing Wavelength Assignment (DRWA) in order to improve
the network blocking probability. In this paper, we propose a
cognitive control method, based on genetic algorithms for
DRWA problems in OBS/WDM networks under wavelength
continuity constraint, analyzing its performance in terms of
blocking
probability
and
execution
time
by
making
a
comparison
with
the
same
network
that
uses
genetic
algorithms, but without cognitive control.
Keywords- optical burst switching; dynamic routing and
wavelength assignment; genetic algorithms; cognition.
I. INTRODUCTION
The
changes
made
during
the
last
years
in
telecommunication networks are mainly based on the need
to supply the traffic demand due to the exponential growth
of the Internet and the Web evolution [1]. This implies
having networks capable of supporting high bandwidth. For
this reason, the optical fiber is becoming one of the most
important means of transmission today. Moreover, among
the advantages of optical networks is the ability to carry data
simultaneously
by
the
same
fiber
using
different
wavelengths; this technique is called Wavelength Division
Multiplexing (WDM).
It is also expected that the current optical networks
receive all traffic more efficiently. For this, switching
techniques
like
Optical
Burst
Switching
(OBS)
are
implemented due to its bandwidth capacity, low latency,
high adaptability, and low processing overhead [2].
Before sending a burst through the network, it is divided
into the Burst Control Packet (BCP) and data packet. The
BCP is sent across a dedicated channel, and it is responsible
for the burst’s routing. On the other hand, the data packet
will be sent only when a timeout has elapsed after sending
the BCP. For this reason, the signaling used is out of band,
allowing space-time separation between header and data,
thus providing manageability and network resilience.
Dynamic Routing Wavelength Assignment (DRWA) in
OBS/WDM (Optical Burst-Switched Wavelength Division
Multiplexing networks) networks, implements methods for
routing and wavelength assignment between links. Such
process can be done between two nodes not necessarily
adjacent, and requires an available wavelength and route
between the optical paths.
This connection is called
lightpath, and due to the dynamic features, the requests to
set it are made at real time.
However,
as
the
DRWA
is
an
Nondeterministic Polynomial
Time
Complete
(NP-C)
problem [3], is not possible to use deterministic algorithms
for its solution, instead, different methods are proposed to
obtain near optimal solutions. This kind of problem allows
the use of Genetic Algorithms (GA) as heuristic methods for
DRWA in OBS/WDM networks.
The GA resembles the evolution stages and natural
selection mechanisms postulated by Charles Darwin. They
work with individuals from a population, each representing
a tentative solution to the problem. The main GA stages are:
generation of individuals, selection, crossover, mutation, and
reduction operators. The genetic algorithm will perform a
number of iterations of the above stages, until one of the
stopping criteria is met. An equally important factor when
talking about GA corresponds to fitness function, whose
objective is to assign a value to each individual, which
measures the relevance of such solution to the problem
being tackled. An appropriate fitness function guides the GA
towards its goal, converging to optimal solutions.
Moreover, the search for increasingly flexible networks
capable of supporting all types of traffic, transmission, and
switching
technologies,
lead
to
intelligent
network
management through techniques that allow awareness and
adaptation mechanisms at any optical architecture level.
Cognitive control methods are a promising factor to meet
the challenges the next-generation optical networks have
[4][5].
Taking into account the information provided, this article
uses two approaches based on GA to the DRWA problem in
OBS/WDM networks, one of them using cognitive control
methods.
To facilitate understanding, the article is organized as
follows. In Section 2, we present the related work to the
different topics involving the current research. The next
section presents the model and the simulation tool used for

OBS/WDM networks. Sections 4 and 5 will focus on the
DRWA problem from the perspective of GA. Then, in
Section 6, the inclusion of a cognitive information base
supported on GA is presented. Subsequently, we analyze the
networks performance taking into account the blocking
probability and processing time. Finally, conclusions will be
shown in Section 8.
II. RELATED WORK
The aim of this paper encloses a context that unifies
several study subjects. Related work about the RWA
problem in OBS/WDM networks using cognitive control
methods based on GA has not been widely developed.
However, certain topics are treated in some research.
For example, Gond and Goel [6] and Gonzales et al. [7]
solve the RWA in DWDM networks taking into account
physical constraints and including devices called optical
converters enabling the switching of wavelengths to increase
efficiency. However, they don’t use GA, OBS, or cognitive
control methods in their strategies.
Kavian et al. [8] and
Kavian [9], apply genetic
algorithms to the RWA in WDM networks, including in
cases like Nakkeeran, et al. [10], strategies of fairness
among connections and fault tolerance capability. This
papers present disadvantages because there is no evidence of
the used switching method.
Moreover, Kozlovski [11], although the authors reflect
routing and wavelength assignment strategies specifically in
OBS/WDM networks, they don’t use GA or cognitive
control methods to solve de DRWA problem.
The approach of Tomkos et al. [12] focuses on cognitive
optical
networks
towards
a
perspective
that
provides
autonomy and counteracts the increasing complexity in the
use and network performance. Finally, (and arguably one of
the most similar to the one developed in this paper) Durán
[13] proposes a strategy based on cognition to solve
Impairment-Aware Virtual
Topology Design Problems.
Although the author does not focus on the switching
technique used, he develops a GA including a memory-
based cognitive control method to optimize the virtual
topology design.
At the moment, there are no evidences of researches
related to the DRWA problem in OBS/WDM networks
using GA and cognitive control to analyze the network
performance. Considering the above, this work aims to
apply a cognition control method to an OBS/WDM network
that implements GA for RWA processes and analyze the
performance, comparing it with the same network that only
uses GA for DRWA.
III. OBS/WDM NETWORK SIMULATION
In order to simulate an OBS/WDM network that enables
the GA implementation, OMNeT++ [14] is chosen as the
used tool since it has flexible, organized, and suitable
software for the simulation of interconnection networks for
high performance. To develop the network design, it must
be noted that OBS works with two kinds of nodes. The first
one is called Edge Node, and presents the following stages:
Assembler
Module
(EdgeNodeAssembler):
it
is
responsible for assembling IP packets into bursts. To do this,
it makes use of three submodules. The first one is the
Classifier; the packets go across this module only if their
destination and class of service are valid values to send
through the network. The Burstifier is another submodule
and performs package grouping tasks to form bursts; three
assembly criteria are set: time, number, and packet length.
Once the bursts are formed, the last submodule called
Sender, is responsible for dividing them in BCP and data
packet.
Disassembler Module (EdgeNodedisassembler): when
the burst reaches its destination, is disassembled returning to
the original packets. Figure 1 shows the Edge Node
modules.
Figure 1. Edge Node modules.
The responsible for routing tasks and network planning
is the Core Node (CoreNode). Inside of it are also several
submodules:
The Input submodule (CoreInput) can differentiate
between data packets and BCP to determine where to send
them. If a burst arrives, then, is sent to the Core Control Unit
(CoreControlUnit) by a dedicated cannel; moreover, if is a
data burst, it will be sent to the Optical Switching Module
(OXC) through which it pass in all optical way. Figure 2
shows the Core module with its corresponding submodules.
Figure 2. Core Node Submodules.
The Control Unit (CoreControlUnit) is responsible for
the
BCP
treatment.
Inside
of
it,
the
Logic
Control
submodule (ControlLogic) is set, which is in charge of
routing, updating BCP information and generate wavelength
requests. Optical–electrical (OE) and electrical-optical (EO)
conversion submodules add a delay to the burst control
packet.
The GatesHorizon Module contains information about
the available wavelengths in order to assign one of them into
the burst.
Figure 3 shows the components of the CoreControlUnit
Module.

Central and Edge nodes join together, creating the
resulting OBS/WDM node as shown in Figure 4. This node
is copied several times to form the evaluated network.

To apply the OBS/WDM characteristics, we use The
National Science Foundation Network (NSFNet), composed
of fourteen nodes and twenty bidirectional connections as
shown in Figure 5.

NSFNet is a Wide Area Network (WAN) covering the
U.S. territory and presents the information needed for
implementation in the simulation tool OMNeT++.
IV. DWRA FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF GENETIC
ALGORITHMS
When talking about routing and wavelength assignment
in OBS/WDM networks, the genetic algorithm process
begins with a particular number of individuals, each of them
being presented as a tentative solution to the DRWA
problem [15][16]. In this case, individuals refer to possible
paths between the source and destination of a burst.
On the other hand, the analogy between networks and
genetic processes is given by the information path, which is
represented by a chromosome [17]. The latter is composed
of genes, allusive to the nodes of the optical path. To
provide greater clarity, the optical path is encoded using a
string of integers, where each number refers to a path node,
as shown in Figure 6.
Figure 6. Coded representation of three routes. From top to bottom: {1,
3, 6}, {1, 2, 5, 6}, {2, 4, 5, 6}.
As can be seen in Figure 6, there are three chromosomes,
({1, 3, 6}, {1, 2, 5, 6}, {2, 4, 5, 6}) each one of them
composed of three, four, and four genes, respectively.
V. GENETIC OPERATORS
A. Generation of Random routes
A set of random paths are generated with the source and
destination values specified by the burst, which makes the
request of a path in real time.
The function begins reaching the node from which the
information is transmitted, then, it randomly chooses a node
i whose position is adjacent to the source node; once is
determined, it is marked as visited. Being in position i, the
function performs the search and selection again to set the
next node. The process is repeated several times and ends
when the destination node is reached, or when all nodes
adjacent to the current position have been visited, in the
latter case, the function starts again.
B. Fitness function
The fitness function integrates information in order to
reduce the blocking probability in the network. In this case,
the information refers to the number of hops across the path,
the distance between them and the number of fibers
connected to each network node [15][18]. Now, before we
continue talking about fitness function, we need to introduce
an important term, i.e., the cost, which allows analyzing
what network proportion is affected given a particular
factor.
To
assess
individuals
with
the
aforementioned
characteristics, two cost functions are considered:
ܥ1=ݏ+ߙ෍(ܮ݅−ܮ݂
௦
௜ୀଵ
݅)
(1)
C1 cost function allows to analyze the impact created by
the number of hops in a route and free wavelengths on it,
where s is the number of hops, L is the total number of
wavelengths in the path, Lf
is the number of free
wavelengths, and α is a design parameter which varies
between 0 and 1. This function was used in the project of
Vinh Tron Le et al. [19], which gives a maximum value for
13
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2013.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-315-5
INNOV 2013 : The Second International Conference on Communications, Computation, Networks and Technologies

α that depends on the number of wavelengths across the
path.
ߙ<1
ܹ−1
(2)
The second function represents the node congestion
generated by the number of links connected to it; the more
connections
with
other
nodes
present,
the
more
the
congestion link will increase. Cost C2 represents the sum of
all links of the nodes across the route as shown below.
ܥ2=෍ܧ݅
௡
௜ୀଵ
(3)
where E is the number of connections of each node
across the route.
The fitness function is inversely proportional to the cost,
thus, the resulting fitness functions are:
ܨ1=1
ݏ+ߙ∑(ܮ݅−ܮ݂
௦
௜ୀଵ
݅)
(4)
ܨ2=1
∑(ܧ݅)௡
௜ୀଵ
(5)
The second fitness function (F2) must have a restriction
because if there are no intermediate nodes in the route, the
sum of links is zero, which generates an infinite value for
this function, i.e., an invalid individual in the search space;
as the purpose is to find an optimal global solution, we
appeal to a restraint method and reconstruction of that value.
In the current project, if such feature generates an infinite
result, it is replaced by 1, which represents the maximum
value taken by the function.
Finally, two functions are employed as, in some cases,
the development of n approximate fitness functions may be
better than a single evaluation function [15].
C. Selection
This operator uses roulette wheel selection [20]. All
individuals with its respective fitness value are stored in a
vector, then; this method assigns to each individual a
circular sector, proportional to its fitness function, as shown
in Figure 7.
Figure 7. Roulette wheel selection.
The routes with higher fitness value will have higher
probability of being selected to apply crossover operator.
D. Crossover
Once the selection process is finished, the routes are
stored in vectors which are analyzed to discard those unfit
(e.g., those having only two nodes), for crossover operator.
Subsequently, the operator searches between the suitable
paths, one common element (except source and destination
nodes) to combine the routes and get the offspring, as shown
in Figure 8.
Figure 8. Crossover between two routes at node 2.
The obtained path cannot contain two equal nodes or be
equal to a stored route (parents routes), if so, it is discarded,
otherwise, it is saved and the fitness function is applied to
each one of the children.
E. Reduction
In this process, from all resulting paths, only those with
higher fitness function will be chosen. If it meets the
stopping criterion, the route with the highest fitness is
chosen as the solution, otherwise, the algorithm must
perform more generational process until the maximum
number of iterations is reached, or if a route is greater than
or equal to the maximum fitness criterion.
VI.
COGNITIVE CONTROL METHOD BASED ON GENETIC
ALGORITHMS FOR DRWA.
Cognitive optical networks have an architecture [12] that
describes the functions performed by each layer of the
network. In response to this, the control cognitive method is
implemented to the Control Plane (CP) [21], since it treats
directly the issues of routing, signaling, and network
topology. The cognitive process is performed after the
genetic algorithm had implemented in the optical network.
In order to explain the implemented cognitive method,
the cognitive cycle is defined [4]. The first state corresponds
to the Observation, and this refers to the network discovery.
The
implementation
of
this
state
allows
the
genetic
algorithm to implement the methods and stages of its
process, providing important information of the cognitive
information base. Subsequently, Orientation emerges, where
the
information
from
the
genetic
algorithm
takes
significance. In this case, the factor of interest to the
cognitive process is the resultant GA route, each time a burst
is formed.
The third stage corresponds to the Planning cycle; this is
where the information related to the best route becomes a
target for cognitive control method. In other words, after
obtaining the solution vector (path) in a particular network
node, this is stored in a table of vectors that contain a
maximum number of paths with the same origin but variable
destination, which will be part of the cognitive strategy
14
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2013.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-315-5
INNOV 2013 : The Second International Conference on Communications, Computation, Networks and Technologies

implemented within the network, this cycle corresponds to
Learning. The vector table size is limited and is set to design
parameter. Then, and thanks to the Decision cycle, the final
route vector corresponding to a node, interacts with the first
stage of the genetic algorithm, "Generation of random
routes."
Once inside this method, it must validate if one or more
of the routes contain the same destination, (for which the
request of the generation of the GA is made). If the result is
positive and one or more vectors are selected, they will be
part of the set of generated random routes (entering in the
cognitive cycle called acting).
This method has an additional factor that adds dynamism
and wide the solution space: if a new route is generated, and
the vector of vectors is full, the latter discards the route
corresponding to its last position and allows the entry of the
new solution into the first position, displacing the other
answers one box. Thus, the cognitive routes will not always
be the same.
VII. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF OBS/WDM NETWORKS
BASED ON GA WITH AND WITHOUT COGNITIVE CONTROL
METHODS
This section explores the parameters that affect the
performance of OBS/WDM networks based on GA with and
without cognitive control methods, evaluating the blocking
probability and processing time.
Simulations are performed considering a dynamic traffic
model where packets arrive according to independent
Poisson
model
with
arrival
rate
λ.
The
source
and
destination addresses of each packet are chosen randomly
using a uniform distribution. The blocking probability is the
first performance indicator to evaluate.
The execution times shown in the graphs are those
corresponding to the OMNeT++ graphical user interface. It
takes three time phases, each one of them corresponding to
one, two, and three hours of real-time simulation. The tests
correspond to the average value of the blocking probability
and processing time, following the Maximum Likelihood
Estimator method [22] with a confidence range of 85%.
Figures 9, 10, and 11 show the blocking probability for
the two networks analyzed, taking maximum offset times of
72, 42, and 32 microseconds, respectively. The design
parameters are:
• Mean time between packets sent: exponential (32
microseconds).
• Transmission speed: 1Gbps.
• Number of generations the algorithm: 1.
• Maximum fitness: 1.
• Size cognitive vector routes: 4
• Four wavelengths between central nodes.
Figure 9. Blocking probability with maximum offset of 72
microseconds.
Figure 10. Blocking probability with maximum offset of 42
microseconds.
Figure 11. Blocking probability with maximum offset of 32
microseconds.
As shown in Figures 9, 10, and 11, for nine of the ten
data taken, the genetic algorithm based on cognitive control
performs better blocking probability values.
In Figure 12, we can see the performance of the
algorithms by applying different data rates in the optical
paths.

In the previous graphs, we analyzed the effect of the
initial number of routes in the processing time. Although the
difference does not differ significantly, we obtained better
results using the genetic algorithm with the cognitive control
method.
VIII.
CONCLUSIONS
Among all analyzed time values and varying offset
ranges, from a total of nine results, only in one case the
blocking probability is lower for the network implementing
genetic algorithms without cognitive control.
Using a transmission speed of 10Gbps and maximum
offset 72US, the blocking probability values decrease for the
genetic algorithm with cognitive control in two of the three
results. Therefore, it can be inferred that in about 66% ±
15% of the cases analyzed, (using the above parameters) this
heuristic method can obtain better network performance.
Conducting the evaluation of the processing time for the
two designed networks it follows that in 6 of 9 results, the
GA with cognitive control method has better processing
time (minor), inferring that it will be in the 66.66% ± 15%
of cases.
