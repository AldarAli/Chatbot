INTRODUCTION
Demand Response (DR) is in its nascent stage in Europe.
DR programs allow Distribution System Operators (DSOs) to
reduce electricity peak demand by incentivizing consumers to
adapt their usage to variations in the electricity generation [1].
Existing DR programs aim at large industrial consumers, who
can be managed as one large client, representing an aggregated
demand of hundreds of residential households. Despite the fact
that households constitute 27% of the total energy consumption
in Europe and are responsible for 10% of the CO2 emissions,
no automated DR programs have been implemented for Euro-
pean households. The European FP7 research project SEMIAH
(Scalable Energy Management Infrastructure for Aggregation
of Households) strives for developing an Information Commu-
nication Technology (ICT) infrastructure for DR [2]. SEMIAH
enables shifting of energy consumption to periods with high
electricity generation from Renewable Energy Sources (RESs)
which helps DSOs to ﬂatten the peak electricity demand.
SEMIAH undertakes three different approaches to address
the home appliance load scheduling optimization problem as
follows: 1) scheduling of non-critical power-intensive loads
using a residential Home Energy Controlling Hub (HECH) sys-
tem, 2) two-stage linear stochastic programming for schedul-
ing of domestic loads, and 3) load scheduling with multi-
objective optimization techniques. This paper introduces a
single-objective load scheduling optimization as a precursor
for the latter multi-objective optimization approach.

THE SEMIAH SYSTEM
The SEMIAH system employs a centralized approach for
aggregation and scheduling of load demands of appliances. It
relies on the ﬂexibilities provided by households who decide
to join a DR program. The ﬂexibility concept of SEMIAH
aligns with the European mandate M/490 [3]: “The ﬂexibility
[offering] concept assumes that parties connected to the grid
produce offerings of ﬂexibility in load and (distributed) genera-
tion. Thereby, so-called ﬂex-offers are issued indicating these
power proﬁle ﬂexibilities, e.g., shifting in time or changing
the energy amount. In the ﬂex-offer approach, consumers and
producers directly specify their demand and supply power
proﬁle ﬂexibility in a ﬁne-grained manner (household and
SME level).” In SEMIAH, ﬂexibility from home appliances

are aggregated in a coherent way to produce ﬂex-offers that
can be traded in the electricity markets.
Load demands of appliances can be categorized based on
the shiftability feature [4]. Shiftability means to authorize a
DR System (DRS) to shift load requests of shiftable appliances
to a future time interval. Some appliances cannot be shifted,
for instance the refrigerator. Hence, these become members of
the category of non-shiftable appliances. Shiftable appliances
can be further divided into groups based on the interruptibility
feature. As an example, the DRS can both shift and interrupt
the charging cycle of an electric vehicle. However, it should
continue operation of the uninterruptible appliances until com-
pletion when these are started, e.g., a washing machine. Each
household presents a scenario including the usage schedule
of appliances. The household applies a deadline ﬂexibility
constraint, which sets a contract when a given appliance
must complete its operation at latest. Subsequently, the DRS
produces a schedule for the aggregated set of appliances,
i.e., a solution. The deadline constraint imposes a non-trivial
optimization problem for the scheduling of electricity loads.
Fig. 1 illustrates a conceptual diagram of the load schedul-
ing subsystem. The DRS applies input data from the electricity
market and the bulk generation side to establish an objective
function used by the scheduling algorithm. In the household, a
HECH is installed to manage loads of appliances. The HECH
connects to sensors and actuators of the household by using
ZigBee communication. It receives control information from
the DRS and runs the scheduled appliances accordingly.
III.
LOAD SCHEDULING
The DRS schedules and manages appliances based on
desired scenarios of households. When consumers provide
their appliances in the “DR Ready” mode to the DRS, they
authorize the DRS to schedule appliances in a 24-hour period.
The DRS receives load requests from all presented scenarios
in each time interval of 5 minutes. Consecutively, it runs the
scheduling algorithm on load requests taking the shiftability
and interruptibility features of appliances into account. Three
constraints are assumed by the scheduler: 1) keeping the total

power consumption below a speciﬁc Electricity Consumption
Threshold (ECT), 2) satisfying the deadline ﬂexibility of appli-
ances, and 3) satisfying the dependencies between appliances,
e.g., the laundry washing is completed before drying can start.
The ﬁrst constraint relates to the grid stability. The second and
third constraints impact on satisfaction of consumers.
The scheduling algorithm allows non-shiftable loads to
start or to continue their operation. If there are uninterruptible
loads running in the previous time interval, they are permitted
to continue. When there are loads which cannot be shifted
without violating the deadline constraint, they must start or
continue. Afterwards, the algorithm utilizes a Knapsack ap-
proach [5] on the remaining load requests to calculate the
ﬁtness of subsets. It returns a subset of remaining load requests
to start or to continue in the current time interval. Loads, which
cannot be started, are shifted to the next time interval.

PRELIMINARY RESULTS
Table I offers an example of a scenario from a household
with a consumer returning home at 18:00 and commencing
to operate his appliances. The corresponding scheduled load
demands of the household is demonstrated in Fig. 2 using two
different ECTs. The maximum demand occurs at 18:25 and
equals to 8,940 W. It comprises the electric vehicle, lighting,
washing machine, oven, and stove. The day-ahead market is
utilized for electricity price data (www.nordpoolspot.com). The
CO2 emission rate is derived from the electricity generation
mix (www.energinet.dk) using the Danish power grid as the
case study. To arrive at a cost metric, combining electricity
price and CO2 emission cost, an average cost of CO2 emission
of 171.78 DKK/1,000 kg is used. No shifting occurs when ECT
is 9 kW which is higher that the peak demand of the household.
When the threshold is lowered to 3 kW, load shifting takes
place. The DRS decides to shift the charging of the electric

vehicle by 200 minutes, and operations of the stove and oven
by 100 and 20 minutes, respectively. It is beneﬁcial to note
that the threshold cannot be fully satisﬁed due to non-shiftable
appliances that must run. This implies a “softness” of ECT.
To study consumer satisfaction, Fig. 3 examines the devia-
tion between the starting and the serving times of appliances.
Obviously, consumers prefer minimal deviation between the
provided scenario and the offered schedule. As ECT increases,
the consumer gets closer to the desired scenario. In the exam-
ple, the electric vehicle is the best candidate to be shifted to
later time intervals due to its higher peak power consumption.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
The SEMIAH project aims at developing an infrastructure
for DR enabling aggregation and scheduling of electricity
loads of home appliances. A scheduling algorithm based on
a single-objective optimization approach has been developed.
It allows the shifting of loads according to ﬂexibilities provided
by consumers. As future work, the scheduling algorithm will
support multi-objective optimization techniques coupling with
the divergent priorities of consumers and the DSO. SEMIAH
targets a solution that scales to 200,000 households to produce
aggregated ﬂex-offers tradable in the electricity markets.
