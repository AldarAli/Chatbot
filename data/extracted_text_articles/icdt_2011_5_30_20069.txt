Abstract- This work studies the effects of the prefilter bandwidth 
before the sequential symbol synchronizers based on pulse 
comparation at quarter rate. We consider three prefilter 
bandwidth namely B1=∞∞∞∞, B2=2.tx and B3=1.tx, where tx is the 
bit rate. We consider four synchronizers, one variant operates at 
the rate with versions manual (b-m) and automatic (b-a) and the 
other operates at quarter rate with versions manual (b-m/4) and 
automatic (b-a/4). The objective is to study the prefilter with the 
synchronizers and evaluate the output jitter UIRMS (Unit 
Interval Root Mean Square) versus input SNR (Signal Noise 
Ratio). 
Keywords - Prefilter; Synchronizers; Communication systems. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
This work studies three prefilter bandwidth effects on the 
jitter-SNR behavior of four sequential symbol synchronizers. 
The Butterworth prefilter, applied before the synchronizer, 
switches their bandwidth between three values, first B1=∞, 
after B2=2.tx and next B3=1.tx, where tx is the bit rate [1 ,2]. 
The sequential symbol synchronizer has four types that can 
operate at rate with versions manual (b-m) and automatic (b-
a) and can operate at quarter rate with versions manual (b-
m/4) and automatic (b-a/4) [3, 4, 5, 6]. 
The difference between the four synchronizers is only in the 
phase comparator, since the other blocks are equal [7, 8]. 
The VCO (Voltage Controlled Oscillator) is the clock that 
samples the data and retimes its bits duration [9, 10, 11, 12]. 
Fig. 1 shows the prefilter followed of the synchronizer.

PF(s) is the prefilter. The synchronizer has various blocks, 
namely Kf is the phase comparator gain, F(s) is the loop 
filter, Ko is the VCO gain and Ka is the loop amplification 
factor that controls the root locus and loop characteristics. 
Next, we present the state of the art. Then, we present the 
prefilter with three bandwidths (B1=∞, B2=2.tx, B3=1.tx). 
After, we present the variant at bit rate with their manual 
and automatic versions. Next, we present the variant at 
quarter bit rate with their manual and automatic versions. 
Following, we present the design and tests. Then, we 
present the results. Finally, we present the conclusions. 
II. STATE OF THE ART, PROBLEM AND SOLUTION 
In priori and actual-art state various synchronizers were 
developed, some ones operate at the rate, others at half rate 
and others at quarter rate. We study their performance. This 
contribution increases the knowledge obout synchronizers. 
The motivation is to create new synchronizers operating at 
sub bit rate and evaluate their performance with noise [1, 2]. 
The problem is that the synchronizers’ output jitter increaes 
with the input SNR decreases. To solve or to minimize this 
problem, we propose a prefilter that attenuates the noise but 
unfortunately distorts slightly the signal [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 12]. 
 
II. PREFILTER BANDWIDTH EFFECTS 
The prefilter, applied before the synchronizer, filters the 
noise but distorts slightly the signal. The prefilter bandwidth 
B switches between three values (B1=∞, B2=2.tx, B3=1.tx). 
Fig. 2 shows the prefilter with their three bandwidths. 
 
 
Fig. 2 Three prefilter bandwidths: a) B1=∞; b) B2=2.tx; c) B3=1.tx 
 
a) First, as Fig.2a, the prefilter has a bandwidth equal to 
infinite (B1= ∞). 
b) Second, as Fig.2b, the prefilter has a bandwidth equal to 
times the bit rate (B2 = 2.tx). 
c) Third, as Fig.2c, the prefilter has a bandwidth equal to 
the bit rate (B3 = 1.tx). 
We will evaluate the three bandwidth effects (B1, B2, B3) 
on the jitter-SNR curves of the four symbol synchronizers. 
 
III. SYNCHRONIZERS OPERATING AT THE RATE 
The synchronizer with its VCO operates, here, at the data 
transmission rate. 
This variant has the manual and the automatic versions, the 
difference in only in the phase comparator. The variable 
pulse Pv consists of first flip flop with exor and is equal in 
the two versions, but the fixed pulse Pf is different [1, 2]. 
 
A. Operation at the rate and manual version 
 
The manual version has a phase comparator, where the 
fixed pulse Pf is produced by an exor with a delay ∆t=T/2, 
that needs a previous manual adjustment (Fig. 3)

The variable pulse Pv minus the fixed pulse Pf (Pv-Pf) 
determines the error phase that controls the VCO. 
 
B. Operation at the rate and automatic version 
 
The automatic version has a phase comparator where the 
fixed pulse Pf is produced automatically by the second flip 
flop with exor, without previous adjustment (Fig. 4).

IV. SYNCHRONIZERS OPERATING AT QUARTER RATE 
The synchronizer with its phase comparator operates, here, 
by both transitions at quarter data transmission rate.  
This variant has the manual (b-m/4) and the automatic (b-
a/4) versions, the difference is only in the phase comparator. 
The variable pulse Pv, based in the four first flip flops with 
multiplexer and exor, is equal in the two versions, but the 
fixed pulse Pf is produced from a different way [3, 4]. 
 
A. Operation at quarter rate and manual version 
 
The manual version has a phase comparator, where the fixed 
pulse Pf is produced by an exor with a delay ∆t=T/2, that 
needs a previous manual adjustment  (Fig. 5).

B. Operation at quarter rate and automatic version 
 
  The automatic version has a phase detector, where the fixed 
pulse Pf is produced automatically by the seconds flip flops 
and multiplexer - exor, without previous adjustment (Fig. 6).

V. DESIGN, TESTS AND RESULTS 
We will present the design, the tests and the results of the 
referred  synchronizers [5]. 
 
A. Design 
To get guaranteed results, it is necessary to dimension all 
the synchronizers with equal conditions. Then it is necessary 
to design all the loops with identical linearized transfer 
functions. 
The general loop gain is Kl=Kd.Ko=Ka.Kf.Ko where Kf is 
the phase comparator gain, Ko is the VCO gain and Ka is the 
control amplification factor that permits the desired 
characteristics. 
For analysis facilities, we use a normalized transmission 
rate tx=1baud, what implies also normalized values for the 
others dependent parameters. So, the normalized clock 
frequency is fCK=1Hz. 
We choose a normalized external noise bandwidth Bn = 
5Hz and a normalized loop noise bandwidth Bl = 0.02Hz. 
Later, we can disnormalize these values to the appropriated 
transmission rate tx. 
Now, we will apply a signal with noise ratio SNR given by 
the signal amplitude Aef, noise spectral density No and 
external noise bandwidth Bn, so the SNR = A2
ef/(No.Bn). 
But, No can be related with the noise variance σn and inverse 
sampling 
∆τ=1/Samp, 
then 
No=2σn2.∆τ, 
so 
SNR=A2
ef/(2σn2.∆τ.Bn) = 0.52/(2σn2*10-3*5)= 25/σn2. 
After, we observe the output jitter UI as function of the input 
signal with noise SNR. The dimension of the loops is

- 1st order loop: 
The loop filter F(s)=1 with cutoff frequency 0.5Hz (Bp=0.5 
Hz is 25 times bigger than Bl=0.02Hz) eliminates only the 
high frequency, but maintain the loop characteristics. 
The transfer function is

Then, for the analog synchronizers, the loop bandwidth is 
Bl=0.02=(Ka.Kf.Ko)/4 with (Km=1, A=1/2, B=1/2; Ko=2π) 
(Ka.Km.A.B.Ko)/4 = 0.02 -> Ka=0.08*2/π                       (3) 
For the hybrid synchronizers, the loop bandwidth is                                                    
Bl=0.02=(Ka.Kf.Ko)/4 with (Km=1, A=1/2, B=0.45; Ko=2π) 
(Ka.Km.A.B.Ko)/4 = 0.02 -> Ka=0.08*2.2/π                     (4) 
For the combinational synchronizers, the loop bandwidth is 
Bl=0.02=(Ka.Kf.Ko)/4     with     (Kf=1/π; Ko=2π) 
(Ka*1/π*2π)/4 = 0.02 -> Ka=0.04                                 (5) 
For the sequential synchronizers, the loop bandwidth is                                                    
Bl=0.02=(Ka.Kf.Ko)/4     with     (Kf=1/2π; Ko=2π) 
(Ka*1/2π*2π)/4 =0.02 -> Ka=0.08                                (6) 
 
The jitter depends on the RMS signal Aef, on the power 
spectral density No and on the loop noise bandwidth Bl. 
For analog PLL the jitter is 
σφ2=Bl.No/Aef2=Bl.2.σn2.∆τ=0.02*10-3*2σn2/0.52=16*10-5.σn2 
For the others PLLs the jitter formula is more complicated. 
 
- 2nd order loop: 
The second order loop is not shown here, but the results are 
identical to the ones obtained above for the first order loop. 
 
B. Tests 
 
The following figure (Fig. 7) shows the setup that was used 
to test the various  synchronizers. 
 
 
 Fig. 7 Block diagram of the test setup 
 
The receiver recovered clock with jitter is compared with 
the emitter original clock without jitter, the difference is the 
jitter of the received clock. 
 
C. Jitter measurer (Meter) 
 
The jitter measurer (Meter) consists of a RS flip flop, which 
detects the random variable phase of the recovered clock 
(CKR), relatively to the fixed phase of the emitter clock 
(CKE). This relative random phase variation is the recovered 
clock jitter (Fig. 8). 
 
 Fig. 8 The jitter measurer (Meter) 
 
The other blocks convert this random phase variation into a 
random amplitude variation, which is the jitter histogram. 
Then, the jitter histogram is sampled and processed by an 
appropriate program, providing the RMS jitter and the peak 
to peak jitter. 
 
D. Results 
 
We will present the results (jitter - noise graphics) for the 
prefilter with the four synchronizers. 
Fig. 9 shows the jitter-SNR curves of the prefilter 
bandwidth B1=∞ with the four synchronizers at the rate 
manual (b-m), at the rate automatic (b-a), at quarter rate 
manual (b-m/4) and at quarter rate automatic (b-a/4). 
 
Fig. 9 Jitter-SNR curves of  B1- 4 synchronizers(b-m,b-a,b-m/2,b-a/2) 
 
We see that, in general, the output jitter UIRMS decreases 
gradually with the input SNR increasing. However, the type 
at quarter rate (b-m/4) has some irregularities. 
For prefilter B1=∞, for high SNR, the four synchronizer 
jitter curves tend to be similar. However, for low SNR, the 
manual versions (b-m, b-m/4) are similar but slightly better 
than the automatic versions (b-a, b-a/4), the type at rate 
manual (b-m) is slightly the best. Also, for an intermediate 
SNR (SNR≅8), the type at quarter rate automatic (b-a/4) has 
a very significant jitter perturbation, due to various losses of 
synchronism. 
Fig. 10 shows the jitter-SNR curves of the prefilter 
bandwidth B2=2.tx with the four synchronizers at the rate 
manual (b-m), at the rate automatic (b-a), at quarter rate 
manual (b-m/4) and at quarter rate automatic (b-a/4).

For prefilter B2=2.tx, we verify that, it becomes the jitter-
SNR curves more similar between themselves. For high SNR, 
it harms the jitter-SNR curves. However, for low SNR, it 
benefits significantly the jitter-SNR curves. Also, for an 
intermediate SNR (SNR≅10), the type both transitions at 
quarter rate automatic (b-a/4) has a very great jitter 
perturbation due to various losses of synchronism. 
Fig. 11 shows the jitter-SNR curves of the prefilter 
bandwidth B3=1.tx with the four synchronizers at the rate 
manual (b-m), at the rate automatic (b-a), at quarter rate 
manual (b-m/4) and at quarter rate automatic (b-a/4). 
 
Fig. 11 Jitter-SNR curves of  B3-4 synchronizers(b-m,b-a,b-m/2,b-a/2) 
 
For prefilter B3=1.tx, we verify that, it becomes the jitter-
SNR curves still more similar between themselves. For high 
SNR, it harms more the jitter-SNR curves. However, for low 
SNR, it benefits less the jitter-SNR curves. Also, for an 
intermediate SNR (SNR≅12), the type both transitions at 
quarter rate automatic (b-a/4) has a very great jitter 
perturbation due to various losses of synchronism. 
 
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
We studied the prefilter with three bandwidths (B1=∞, 
B2=2.tx, B3=1.tx) followed of four synchronizers, at rate 
manual (b-m), at rate automatic (b-a), at quarter rate manual 
(b-m/4) and quarter rate automatic (b-a/4). We saw that, in 
general, the output jitter curves decreases gradually with the 
input SNR increasing. However, the type at quarter rate 
automatic (b-a/4) has some undesired irregularities. 
For prefilter B1=∞, we verified that, for high SNR, the four 
synchronizers jitter curves tend to be similar, this is 
comprehensible since all the synchronizers are digital and 
have similar noise margin. However, for low SNR, the 
manual versions (b-m, p-m/4) are significantly better than the 
automatic versions (b-a, b-a/4), this is comprehensible since 
the automatic versions have more digital states, what 
aggravates the error state propagation. The type at rate 
manual (b-m) is slightly the best, because has less digital 
states. Also, for an intermediate SNR (SNR≅8) the quarter 
rate automatic (p-a/4) has a very significant jitter perturbation 
due to various losses of synchronism. 
For prefilter B2=2.tx, we verify that, it becomes the jitter-
SNR curves more similar between themselves. For high SNR, 
it harms slightly the jitter-SNR curves. However, for low 
SNR, it benefits slightly the jitter-SNR curves. Also, for an 
intermediate SNR (SNR ≅10), the type (b-a/4) has a great 
jitter perturbation, due to various losses of synchronism. 
For prefilter B3=1.tx, we verify that, it becomes the jitter-
SNR curves still more similar between themselves. For high 
SNR, it harms more the jitter-SNR curves. However, for low 
SNR, it benefits less the jitter-SNR curves. Also, for an 
intermediate SNR (SNR ≅ 12), the type (b-a/4) has a great 
jitter perturbation, due to various losses of synchronism. 
In the future, we are planning to extend the present study to 
other types of synchronizers.
