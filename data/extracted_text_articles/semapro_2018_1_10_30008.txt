Abstract—In this contribution, we explore the type of linguistic
knowledge that is required to establish relatedness between a
claim and a justiﬁcation which may be distant or in different
texts, within the framework of argument mining. We propose
an original annotation method based on XML-Frames and a
linguistic analysis of the main resources which are needed to
establish relatedness on a linguistic basis.

AIMS AND MOTIVATIONS
One of the main challenges of argument mining is to
correctly identify the statements that are justiﬁcations or that
support a given claim across different types of online texts
(for example, news articles, blogs, consumer reviews). This
issue is called argument relatedness and it is a central point in
information retrieval. It is also essential in argument mining
[1]-[3]. The main objective of research on argument relatedness
is to be able to mine statements which develop the same
topic as the given claim and have an argumentative orientation.
Broadly speaking, relatedness is a measure of the semantic and
topical proximity of two text spans. These segments may differ
lexically (via the use of synonyms, hyponyms or hypernyms, to
name a few possibilities) or syntactically (for example, with
alternations, such as active vs. passive structures). Previous
research [4] has shown that establishing relatedness between
an argument and a statement requires knowledge in 58% to
88% of situations, depending on the topic of the claim.
Since supports and attacks (elements that oppose a claim)
of a claim mainly address the purposes, goals, functions or
structure of the main concepts of the claim, previous studies
have used the Qualia structure of the Generative Lexicon [5]
as a knowledge representation system for relatedness. This
approach pairs domain knowledge with lexical semantics in
an efﬁcient and principled way. However, this previous work
also shows that Qualia structures are difﬁcult to develop
and must be deﬁned for each topic. This makes knowledge-
based argument mining an approach that, although effective,
is difﬁcult to reuse over different domains.
The current research project examines and evaluates the
possibility of establishing relatedness solely on the basis of
linguistic knowledge and lexical semantics. The development
of general-purpose linguistic processes and resources that
characterize relatedness would make the implementation of
relatedness much simpler and much more reusable over do-
mains. This contribution explores this hypothesis as well as
the linguistic knowledge which is required, in particular lexical
semantics.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The analysis
protocol and the annotation system are presented in Section II,
while Section III deals with the future steps that need to be
taken to be able to establish relatedness on a linguistic basis.
II.
ANALYSIS PROTOCOL
This research introduces two speciﬁcities. First, the analy-
sis of relatedness is based on the topical content of the claim,
as a claim-driven analysis allows the analysis to focus on the
features of the claim and to integrate the new elements found
in various statements related to that claim. In addition, the
annotation is not based on standard linear text annotations but
on the use of frames encoded in XML: the use of an XML-
Frame approach is motivated by the fact that the elements
found in statements and that are decisive for the analysis of the
semantic elements of relatedness may not be adjacent, which
makes text annotation, which is linear, almost intractable.
In this framework, relevant statements are extracted from
the source text and fed into XML-Frames in which the features
are ﬁlled in manually by annotators. Each statement found to
be related to the claim and with an argumentative orientation
originates an instance of the frame. The result is a set of frames
which can be organized as a tree, where the root is the frame
representing the claim and the children are those statements
found in texts and that introduce additional constraints on
the topic. These additional constraints on the claim topic
characterize relatedness.
The relations of each statement with the claim are described
in each frame instance through the use of features indicating
the linguistic and conceptual links between the claim and the
statement. Our corpus is based on texts about controversial
social issues, addressing topics such as afﬁrmative action or
the gender pay gap. These are relatively complex issues, which
guarantees that the need for linguistic and conceptual knowl-
edge will be apparent. The goal is then to mine statements
which are related to this claim in various texts. These state-
ments must have a topic that is subsumed by the claim topic
and an argumentative orientation which may support or attack
the claim, depending on the content of the statement. The
argumentative orientation is given by evaluative expressions

such as scalar adjectives, possibly modiﬁed by an adverb of
intensity. Those statements are also frequently associated with
discourse structures which further develop them.
The frame template we have deﬁned for the study of relat-
edness is very detailed. Inside the general frame <statement>,
four sub-frames are embedded (<topic>, <evaluative>,
<discourse>, <arg scheme>), with the ﬁrst two subframes
also including two additional subframes which allow for the
identiﬁcation of a main topic and a ﬁeld of application for this
topic.
As an illustration, let us consider the following claim:
afﬁrmative action in education is good for the economy. This
claim is composed of a topic: afﬁrmative action in education
and an evaluative expression: is good for the economy. The
topic is itself composed of a main concept, afﬁrmative action
and a ﬁeld of application for this concept, in education. The
evaluative expression is analyzed in the same way (is good and
for the economy). The annotation scheme is presented below
in more detail:
<statement> <topic> <top_main markers= ,
link= , concept_op= ,
restrictions= ,
annotator_confidence= >,
<top_field markers= , link= ,
concept_op= ,
restrictions= ,
annotator_confidence= >
<\topic>
<evaluative> <ev_main markers= ,
polarity= , strength= ,
restrictions= ,
annotator_confidence= >,
<ev_field markers= , link= ,
concept_op= ,
restrictions= ,
annotator_confidence= >
<\evaluative>
<discourse> <text= , type= > </discourse>
<arg_scheme
type= , annotator_confidence= >
<\statement>
To say it brieﬂy, this frame allows the description of most
features that characterize relatedness. The ’link’ and ’con-
cept op’ features respectively specify the linguistic link (exact
words, derivation, semantic ﬁeld, etc.) and the conceptual
operation taking place between the words of the claim and
the words of the text (reformulation, summarization, deﬁni-
tion, etc.). The same description is made for the evaluative
expression with, in addition, the orientation and strength of
the evaluation.
The <discourse> subframe describes elements such as
elaborations, illustrations, comparisons, conditions or circum-
stances that are not directly argumentative but can be seen as
being part of the argument. Finally, the annotator is invited to
specify the kind of argument scheme(s) that has been used,
from a standard list of arguments [6] [7].
III.
TOWARD A LINGUISTIC CATEGORIZATION OF
RELATEDNESS
The ’link’ and ’concept op’ features are speciﬁcally de-
signed to allow for the linguistic categorization of relatedness.
To describe the linguistic and conceptual links with the claim,
the annotators can use predeﬁned categories or natural lan-
guage, until a stable list of categories can emerge through the
collective observation and analysis of the corpus. Then, a cate-
gorization of the main linguistic operations can be carried out,
and the associated resources can be developed and structured
from existing resources. The aim of this categorization is to
characterize the linguistic operations behind relatedness and to
evaluate the efﬁciency and scope of a linguistic approach, i.e.
how much of relatedness analysis can be resolved via linguistic
processes.
The parameters which are under investigation, categoriza-
tion and evaluation are as follows:
•
the
paradigmatic
lexico-semantic
transformations
developed from the topic of the claim and its
restrictions, in particular, forms of synonymy, partial
reformulations (the lower representation of women in
paid work), paraphrases, restrictions, opposites, forms
of inchoativity (terms describing the result instead of
the process) or vice-versa (for example: gender pay
parity → gender pay gap).
•
the functional transformations which are related to
the nature of the topic, and may induce some domain
dependent
lexical
data
(for
example:
providing
a
better
balance
of
job
opportunities
for
all).
These functional terms are derived from linguistic
resources that develop the goals or purposes of
entities. These may be found, for the simplest kinds,
in WordNet (examples and data can be found in [13]).
•
the local syntactic transformations on the claim topic,
(the gap in salary between genders),
•
forms
of
discourse
transformations
such
as:
summarization (when the topic is long), illustration
or instantiation, expression of consequence,
•
the lexical data which is necessary, its structure ac-
cording to lexical semantics principles [8], and its
availability. A number of resources are already present
in our <TextCoop> platform that realizes discourse
analysis in English and French with high accuracy
(about 90% accuracy in the case of the domains
considered here). The version 5.1 of this platform
is available at [14] while system foundations and
examples can be found in [15].
