Abstract—Cooperative wireless communication has been
proposed as a way to improve channel capacity, robustness, reli-
ability, delay, and coverage. Multiple research works have been
done to support cooperative communication in the medium
access control (MAC) layer. Synergy MAC is one of the
MAC protocols that support cooperative communication using
cooperative relay nodes. In this paper, some security attacks
against control packets of Synergy MAC are identiﬁed and
the potential security issues that arise in Synergy MAC due to
these attacks are also discussed.
Keywords–Synergy MAC; cooperative communication; control
packet; security attack; security issue.
I. INTRODUCTION
Within the last ten years, cooperation communication in
wireless networks has received signiﬁcant attention. Coop-
erative wireless communication is an innovative communi-
cation scheme that takes advantage of the open broadcast
nature of the wireless medium and the spatial diversity to
achieve performance gain. It is also known to be essential
for making ubiquitous communication connectivity a reality.
In the cooperative wireless networks, when the source node
transmits data to the destination node, some nodes that are
close to source node and destination node can serve as
relay nodes by forwarding replicas of the source’s data.
The destination node receives multiple data from the source
node and the relay nodes and then combines them to achieve
performance and quality improvement [1][2][3].
There are three major schemes employed by the relay
node to forward data to the destination node: amplify-and-
forward (AF), decode-and-forward (DF), and compress-and-
forward (CF). In AF scheme, relay node receives a noisy
version of the transmitted original data and then ampliﬁes
and retransmits this noisy data to the destination node. On
the other hand, in DF scheme, relay node decodes data
transmitted by the source node and then retransmits the
decoded data to the destination node. Finally, CF scheme
works by forwarding incremental redundancy of original
data by the relay node to the destination node [1][4].
Several protocols in the MAC layer have been proposed
to utilize the concept of cooperative transmission. A typical
example is Synergy MAC protocol [5][6]. Synergy MAC is
an IEEE 802.11b [7] based cooperative MAC protocol for
mobile ad hoc networks. Synergy MAC was proposed to
take advantage of cooperation, while remaining backward
compatible with legacy IEEE 802.11b. This protocol is able
to alleviate the ill effects of signal fading by realizing spatial
diversity and transmit data at rates higher than otherwise
possible by allowing nodes with low signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) to destination utilize intermediate relay nodes. It
also outperforms standard IEEE 802.11b and mitigate some
of the fairness problems caused by multiple modulation
schemes.
Security is a principal issue that must be resolved in
order for the potential of cooperative wireless networks
to be fully exploited. However, security issues related to
the design of cooperative wireless networks have largely
not been considered. In this paper, a comprehensive study
of security attack based on control packet vulnerability
in Synergy MAC is presented. Security issues at each
handshaking procedure while attacking the control packets
such as request-to-send (RTS) and clear-to-send (CTS) is
analyzed and discussed. This work differs from previous
works in that it concentrates on one signiﬁcant aspect of a
security issue in the Synergy MAC, namely security issue of
Synergy MAC caused by attack against the control packets
at handshaking mechanism.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, I present some related works and security issues
on cooperative wireless networks. In Section III, I give a
brief description of the Synergy MAC protocol. In Section
IV, I identify some possible security attacks against control
packets of Synergy MAC and then discuss the security issues
caused by these attacks. Finally, in Section V, I conclude the
paper and present plans for future work.
II. RELATED WORKS
Due to the rapidly increasing popularity of cooperative
wireless networks, there have been multiple research works
regarding cooperative communication protocols and security
issues for cooperative wireless networks. The work in [1]
described cooperative wireless communication that enables
single antenna mobiles to share their antennas. The [2]
proposed and analyzed opportunistic relaying as a practical
scheme that forms a cooperative diversity. The [3] introduced

an adaptive relay selection on demand with early retreat
scheme to reduce the overall energy consumption signiﬁ-
cantly.
Some MAC protocols have been suggested to support
cooperative transmissions in wireless networks. In [8], a new
MAC protocol for the IEEE 802.11 [9], namely CoopMAC,
was proposed and its performance was also analyzed. The
Synergy MAC, an IEEE 802.11b [7] based cooperative MAC
protocol for mobile ad hoc networks was studied in [5]. Also,
COSMIC, a carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance
(CSMA/CA) based cooperative MAC protocol for wireless
sensor network (WSN) with minimal control messages was
proposed in [10], and cooperative MAC protocol of alleviat-
ing the problem from a pure MAC centric perspective, called
CMAC was introduced to provide immediate improvements
to the IEEE 802.11e [11] efﬁciency [4]. The [12] suggested
a distributed MAC protocol, which uses an automatic relay
selection with embedded relay collision avoidance and three-
way handshaking to minimize signaling overhead.
Cooperative wireless communications are vulnerable to
security attacks due to the open broadcast nature of the
wireless communication channel and the cooperative trans-
missions with multiple transmitters. Several research groups
have studied security issues including attacks, vulnerabil-
ities, and mechanisms in cooperative wireless networks.
The [13] formulated cooperative mechanisms for wireless
networks with cooperative relays which help to give provable
unconditional secrecy guarantees, while the [14] developed
a framework for evaluating the trade-off between using
cooperative transmissions or non-cooperative transmissions
in sensor networks with a mix of malicious and non-
malicious nodes. The [15] presented the distributed trust-
assisted cooperative transmission mechanism handling re-
lay’s misbehavior as well as channel estimation error. The
[16] described a security framework for leveraging the se-
curity in cognitive radio cooperative networks. The security
vulnerabilities found in trafﬁc adaptive cooperative wireless
sensor-MAC (CWS-MAC), a ﬂow speciﬁc medium access
scheme were identiﬁed and analyzed in [17]. The work in
[18] studied the coordinated denial of service (DoS) attacks
against data packets using the concept of cooperative game
theory on IEEE 802.22 [19] from the malicious nodes’
perspective. The [20] proposed a detection technique of mis-
behaving nodes either based on the uniform most powerful
(UMP) test or on the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT)
in networks using CoopMAC and automatic repeat request
(ARQ) protocols. The security concerns on data packets that
a Synergy MAC introduces due to its reliance on a third
party relay were discussed in [6]. Similarly, the potential
security issues and vulnerabilities that arise in CoopMAC
were addressed in [21][22].
In spite all the above mentioned researches, there is still
no work that analyzes the security issues caused by the
security attacks against control packets in the Synergy MAC.

Most of the previous works are focused on efﬁcient and
reliable cooperative transmission scheme using the relay
node and identiﬁcation of general security issues caused by
the malicious relay node. In this paper, I discuss the potential
security issues that arise in Synergy MAC due to security
attacks against control packets. This work is the reasonable
attempt to analyze and compare security issues from possible
security attacks based on control packets vulnerabilities in
Synergy MAC.
III. SYNERGY MAC
Synergy MAC is a MAC protocol based on the IEEE
802.11b’s distributed coordination function (DCF) mecha-
nism to realize cooperative transmission at the physical layer.
It employs control packets like RTS and CTS for sensing
the wireless medium to determine if it is free. The Synergy
MAC is completely compatible with IEEE 802.11b and can
be easily extended to suit other version of the legacy IEEE
802.11. It achieves higher rates of data transmission than
IEEE 802.11b despite leveraging on the multi-rate capability
of IEEE 802.11b.
The three-way handshaking procedure for Synergy MAC
is depicted in Fig. 1. When a source node (S) wants to
send data packets to destination node (D), it ﬁrst senses the
wireless channel condition, busy or idle. If the channel is
idle, S sends the RTS packet (RTS S) to the D, reserving
the channel for network allocation vector (NAV) duration
needed to transmit data packets. If not, S should wait
the channel is idle and then send the RTS S. When a
relay node (R) overhears RTS S transmission and decodes
it successfully, it broadcasts a self addressed CTS packet
(CTS R). When the D receives a CTS R from R soon
after receiving a RTS S from S, it sends CTS packet
(CTS D) to the S. This CTS D is used to reserve the

channel for cooperative communication via the R. Once S
receives the CTS R from the R and the CTS D from
the D respectively, it starts transmitting its data pack-
ets (Data SR) to R. R then forwards the data packets
(Data SR = Data RD) received from S to D. After
D successfully receives Data RD from R, it sends an
acknowledgement packet (ACK) to S. Otherwise, D sends
a negative acknowledgement packet (NACK), notifying S
of the failure of cooperative transmission between S and
D via the R. In addition, if S receives no response from D
within a speciﬁc timeout period, it will also notice the failure
of transmission to D. Data transmission cycle in Synergy
MAC is complete when the S receives the ACK from the
D. More details on Synergy MAC may be found in [5][6].
IV. SECURITY ATTACK AND ISSUE IN SYNERGY MAC
Due to broadcast nature of the wireless transmission
and cooperative transmission, Synergy MAC suffers from
various attacks. For example, in Fig. 1, let’s assume attacker
node is closer to S than D or it is between the S and the
D. In this environment, attacker node can disguise itself
as D and respond with its CTS packet to S. There is no
suitable countermeasure to prevent this attack and solution
to authenticate D. Therefore, an attacker node close to the
victim nodes can respond with a CTS packet to them thus
it results in disruption of the normal cooperative transmis-
sion between nodes. The attackers’ goal is focused on the
network’s performance, that means they want to disturb the
communication between source node and destination node.
They would exploit the weakness in cooperative procedure,
especially in the control packets exchange, and disguise

themselves as legitimate relay nodes to disturb the network’s
operation and to degrade the communication quality.
Security attacks based on the control packets resulting
from attacker nodes can be classiﬁed into two categories:
(1) false RTS attack and (2) false CTS attack. The former
generates a false RTS packet in order to create the virtual
jamming, while the latter generates a false CTS packet
in order to disguise attacker as legitimate relay node or
destination node. The followings introduce these attacks
according to the control packets of Synergy MAC in greater
detail.
A. Source Attack using False RTS
The ﬁrst security attack is that of virtual jamming by an
attacker node which deliberately sends false RTS packet to
relay node and destination node. Let us take the case of
Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2, attacker node (A) sends the
false RTS packet (RTS A) to relay node (R) and destination
node (D). A then waits for the CTS packet (CTS R) from
R and CTS packet (CTS D) from D. RTS A causes R
and D to deny legal RTS packet (RTS S) from source node
(S). This means that because R and D have already received
the RTS packet from A, they reject the additional RTS packet
from S. Once A receives the CTS R and the CTS D, it
starts transmitting its false data packets (Data A) to the R.
Thus, this attack blocks the transmission of the RTS S and
the data packets (Data S) from S. Consequently, S can not
start its data packets transmission to R.
Next, A sends the RTS A to only D. This scenario
is depicted in Fig. 3. Since the authentication(or integrity)
mechanism is not applied to the control packets exchange

between S and D, the legal RTS S from S can be rejected
by D due to an illegal previous RTS A received from A.
Accordingly, CTS D is sent from the D to the A, not S.
This means that the S continuously waits for the CTS D
from the D to ﬁnish the handshaking process. As a result,
normal cooperative communication between S and D can
not be guaranteed.
B. Relay Attack using False CTS
The second security attack is that of false CTS packet
sending by the attacker node in order to disturb the relay
node. An attacker node may try to deny relay node’s legal
CTS packet to source node and/or destination node by
sending the false CTS packet, causing the source node and/or
destination node to reject a legal CTS packet from relay
node. As shown in Fig. 4, the false CTS packet (CTS A)
is sent from attacker node (A) to source node (S) and
destination node (D). Accordingly, the legal CTS packet
(CTS R) from relay node (R) is denied by S and D. Then,
D sends its CTS packet (CTS D) to S. After receiving
the CTS A and CTS D, S starts data packet (Data S)
transmission to A, but R. A deliberately stops forwarding
Data S to R, which results in DoS attack caused by A. Due
to this false transmission to A, cooperative communication
between S and D via R is not established.
Fig. 5 illustrates another attack from attacker node’s
illegal CTS packet in the Synergy MAC. In the case of
sending illegal CTS packet (CTS A) to only source node
(S), since the S is typically not come to know of this,
although the legal CTS packet (CTS R) is sent from relay
node (R) to S, it is denied by S. Then, the destination

node (D) sends a CTS packet (CTS D) to S in order
to notify that it successfully received the CTS R. This
also means that attacker node (A) is an intended legitimate
relay node forwarding data packets (Data S). Therefore, S
sends Data S to A, not R. Finally, A denies cooperative
communication to the S by simply dropping the Data S it
receives from S.
The potential relay node attack using illegal CTS packet is
also shown in Fig. 6. Since the destination node (D) receives
the illegal CTS packet (CTS A) from attacker node (A), it
rejects the legal CTS packet (CTS R) from relay node (R).
After receiving the CTS packet (CTS D) from D, source
node (S) sends its data packets (Data S) to R. If R receives
the Data S from S, it doesn’t forward Data S to D, but
forwards it the A. A drops the Data S received from R. It
also spoofs an ACK, causing the S to wrongly conclude a
successful cooperative transmission via R.
C. Destination Attack using False CTS
Fig. 7 shows a destination node attack which caused by
the illegal CTS packet from attacker node. In this case, the
attacker node (A) transmits a false CTS packet (CTS A)
to source node (S), informing the S that it is an intended
recipient of future data packets (Data S). And, since the
authentication(or integrity) mechanism is not applied to
CTS A, the legal CTS packet (CTS D) from destination
node (D) can be rejected by S due to a previous illegal
CTS A from A. Just after receiving the CTS A from
A, S transmits Data S to relay node (R). Subsequently,
the R receives the Data S and then forwards it to A.
The A may try to deny cooperative communication to S

Consequently, cooperative communication between S and

V. CONCLUSION
This paper presented the case study of security attacks
based on control packets (RTS and CTS) vulnerabilities in
Synergy MAC. Furthermore, it analyzed security vulnera-
bilities at each handshaking stage while attacking control
packets exchanged among nodes (source, destination, and
relay). This study is the comprehensive analysis of security
vulnerabilities caused by attacker node in Synergy MAC. It
can be signiﬁcant in the use of design of efﬁcient authenti-
cation solutions for secure Synergy MAC. The analytical
results can be extended to not only cooperative wireless
network security, but also WSN security design in general.
As future work, the author plans to design and implement
lightweight low-power authentication mechanism suitable
for cooperative wireless networks. The plan is then to exam-
ine some effects with security cost, power consumption, and
transmission performance using the proposed mechanism.
