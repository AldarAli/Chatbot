Abstract—The aim of this paper is to determine the intention of
supporting the use of a Learning Management System (LMS)
under
Modular
Object-Oriented
Dynamic
Learning
Environment (Moodle), in the creation of virtual classrooms as
support tools for on-campus work in higher education. We
used as a case study the points of view of academic authorities
from the National Polytechnic School. The opinion of this
group was considered as they are responsible for policies in
educational institutions: they lead and make decisions at the
university. To prove this objective we considered perceived
usefulness and easy usage. The Technology Acceptance Model
(TAM) was applied; this helped to confirm that the hypothesis
of virtual classrooms used as support tools in on-campus study
is backed by academic authorities, and is in concordance with
global, regional and local trends. The results of the research
show that age influences the acceptance of new technologies. It
is interesting to know that the perception of quality backed by
technology is high and that, based on the TAM model, the ease
of use and obtained benefits were determining variables in
accepting Moodle as an on-campus support tool. This is
important because they prove the current state of the use of
Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) at the
university.

I.
INTRODUCTION
The
use
of
Information
and
Communication
Technologies (ICTs) in education is a coveted trend if we are
to expand access, eliminate exclusion and increase the
quality in education [1]. In general, ICTs are a set of
different
technological
tools
and
resources,
used
to
communicate,
develop,
spread,
save
and
manage
information. Within the educational context, ICTs promote
digital literacy by generating essential skills and abilities for
life [1].
Considering its transcendence and linkage with the
teaching-learning process, ICT and education are two
elements that must merge, in order for ICTs to be immersed
in the teaching-learning process through a curriculum;
complement, so as to provide dynamics and motivation
necessary in the traditional teaching-learning process; and
feed off, in order to mutually grow based on updating,
renewal and innovation.
This
investigation’s
objective
is
to
determine
the
intention of using Moodle to develop virtual classrooms as
support for on-campus learning. We used the views of the
academic authorities of a University in Quito - Ecuador as a
case study, a higher public education institution renowned
for its engineering programs.
Regarding the authorities, the information desired is their
perception of quality, ease of use and perceived usefulness of
ICTs in the teaching-learning process, specifically in the use
of virtual classrooms.
To achieve this goal, the paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, we show the importance of using ICTs through
Moodle as support tools for teaching-learning in higher
education institutions. In Section III, we analyze the use of
Moodle as an example of an ICT tool in education. Then,
the used materials and methods are presented in Section IV.
In Section V, the main results of the surveys answered by the
academic
authorities
are
presented.
Finally,
the
main
conclusions and future work are discussed.
II.
USING ICTS IN EDUCATION AT GLOBAL, REGIONAL
AND LOCAL LEVELS
A.
Global and Regional Context
The inclusion of world policies supporting ICTs in
education has been desired and expected for quite some time.
The first policy referring to the integration of ICTs was
declared explicitly in the Millennium Development Goals
(MDG), described in goal 8F: “In cooperation with the
public sector, provide access to benefits in new technologies,
especially information and communication” [2].
In 2000 at the World Education Summit held in Dakar,
Senegal, governments of 164 countries established eight
objectives
and
twelve
strategies
in
order
to
achieve
Education for All (EFA) with a 2015 deadline. According to
UNESCO´s follow-up report for EFA [3], the objective has
not been reached but the number of children and teenagers
without educations has decreased. A lot has been achieved in
gender parity and government care for quality education,
98

ACHI 2016 : The Ninth International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interactions

although financial support has not been available in the use
of ICTs [1].
A tool to accomplish this is mentioned in strategy
number 10: “Harness New Information to Help Achieve
EFA goals” [3], but these policies have yet to be developed
with regard to ICTs in education. However, the World Bank
and UNESCO have supported the realization of global
annual symposia on ICTs, and UNESCO has supported
initiatives [4] that are a guide of ICT goals to achieve better
results in education.
The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS),
held in 2003 and 2005, established a serious commitment
between governments in pursuit of an inclusive information
society. In the latest meeting in 2015, WSIS mentions two
guidelines related to education in which Latin America and
Caribbean sectors have to be included in their action plan.
The inclusion of the ICTs is explicitly mentioned to reach
this primary objective [5].
Meanwhile,
in
Latin
America
and
the
Caribbean,
governments
have circumscribed
in their agendas the
inclusion of ICTs in education as a priority theme, although,
in real life, it does not have the same priority, mainly due to
economic index factors that show obvious inequalities [5].
eLAC is an action plan for Latin America and Caribbean
Information Society which states ICTs as tools designed to
promote economic development and social inclusion [6][7].
Therefore, the Action Plan regarding Information and
Knowledge Society of Latin America, sets the following
policies regarding education:
"Develop and implement information technologies and
communications for inclusive education," taking advantage
of ICTs in the teaching-learning process with active
participation of those involved.
"Universalize access and expand the use of information
technology and communication for education" through
broadband connection, ICT teacher training, using teacher
learning networks, and regional educational portals [5].
B.
Local Context
Within local context, the regulatory framework that
promotes the inclusion of ICT in Ecuador’s educational
system is mentioned in the Academic Regulations Regime
issued on November 21, 2013. It is the mandatory instrument
for all the Higher Education Institutions, public and private,
issued by the Council on Higher Education (CES). CES
functions include planning, regulating and coordinating the
Higher Education system which mentions the inclusion of
ICTs
in
the
curriculum,
learning
activities,
learning
modalities, digital literacy transversely into higher education,
etc., as mandatory, in articles 15,26,27,28,37,38,42,43,45 [8].
C.
Institutional Context
The National Polytechnic School (Escuela Politécnica
Nacional EPN) where this study was
carried out is
considered the nation’s top public institution by virtue of
being a High Education Institution (HEI) benchmarked for
its
technical
engineering,
with
an
A
institutional
accreditation level [9].
According to the Regulation of Academic Regime
(RAR), the University is aligned with current regulations and
in light of these new state regulations, internal regulations
have been updated considering government policies and
following local, regional and global trends to support the use
of ICTs.
This
research
wanted
to
consider
the
opinion
of
University academics responsible for this case study of using
virtual classrooms that use ICTs in the teaching-learning
process.
This
information
is
relevant
since
the
academic
authorities are responsible for making decisions inside HEIs,
and they also must answer global development and ICT
trends. There are numerous investigations regarding the
opinion of the students [10]-[14] and teachers [15]-[20], but
not of university academics authorities [21]-[24].
III. USE OF MOODLE IN EDUCATION
As we have seen, using ICTs in the teaching-learning
process
is one of the requirements made at all Higher
Education Institutions at global and local level. They are
valued and recognized as being an indicator of quality in
higher education [25] so as to promote student intellectual
qualities
of
higher
order
thinking,
problem
solving,
communication skills and a profound knowledge of the
teaching and learning tools [16].
From this perspective, promoting the imminent use of
ICTs in the classroom using support tools such as blogs,
wikis, virtual classrooms, etc. needs to strengthen students’
digital skills [15][26]. It also requires teachers to develop
their skills in using ICTs as 21st century competencies to face
the
challenges
in
changing
scenarios
and
teaching
methodologies [15][27][28].
The 2015 NMC Horizon Report for Higher Education
[26], researches new technologies that will support the
teaching-learning process in higher education. Among these
technologies,
we
mention:
mobile
applications,
cloud
computing,
open
content,
collaborative
environments,
adaptive environments, semantic applications, augmented
reality,
blended-learning,
massive
open
online
courses
(MOOCs), game-based learning, etc.
Many of these technologies use educational platforms
based on e-learning as support mainly at educational
institutions that need organization in learning. They consider
essential educational foundations in the teaching-learning
process mediated by LMS in order to foster relevant
learning, encourage critical thinking, collaborative and
cooperative work [15][17][19][18][29][30][31].
A major change with the use of virtual classrooms
through Moodle is where the learning environment changes
and evolves the roles of the participants in the teaching-
learning process. In this change the teacher ceases being the
center of the process, giving prominence to the student, who
becomes an active participant in his own learning process
under the guidance of the teacher as facilitator in the cycle
[7].
Another transformation is evidenced when the work
space becomes a timeless space, thereby adapting to all the
settings of teaching-learning in an open and accessible
99

structure, according to the needs of the digital age in which
we live.
Virtual spaces expand the boundaries between formal and
informal education, producing effective learning in which
teachers, experts and students contribute.
A.
Educational Trends of Virtual Spaces in Higher
Education.
Among the current trends in higher education we cite:
new
pedagogical
models
for
teaching-learning;
virtual
learning tools to promote intelligent education, i.e. with the
maximum potential; online universities for formal and non-
formal learning saving time, space and money. In addition,
we can mention e-learning support centers for universities,
teacher training, as well as providing infrastructure and
methodology; globalizing e-learning in order to include all
regions
by
certifying
qualifications;
Open
Educational
Resources (OER), given their accessibility, efficiency and
quality; and finally MOOCs, which encompasses all the
advantages of e-learning and is massively supported by the
best educational institutions in the world [31]. According
these world trends, this research supports e-learning in the
EPN; therefore, the investigation as previously mentioned,
uncovers the support of the University´s authorities in using
virtual classrooms under Moodle to support teaching-
learning.
B.
Moodle as Tool to Support the Teaching-learning
Process.
There are many tools to support learning using ICTs, one
being the virtual classroom. The virtual classroom is used
both for full online learning (e-learning) and as support for
on-campus or hybrid learning (b-learning).
The use of virtual classrooms is widespread today, but it
is important to determine what their true function and use is
in education.
This will allow us to determine what resources are used
in the classroom, means of communication used by the
participants, the types of materials used, etc. It will be
considered that, while the tool plays a fundamental role as a
vehicle in the educational process, it is not an end, and for
this educational component, it is essential. [32].
There
are
numerous
platforms
for
online
course
management, but EPN chose Moodle for its recognized
advantages such as: being a General Public License (GNU)
open source system, its fundamental teaching bases in social
constructivism and a great learning community [33]. These
make it a unique LMS. The ease of use for online course
management and the availability of a variety of continuously
updated resources and activities (such as mobile devices)
make it the required worldwide platform. EPN has used
several versions and currently it uses version 2.6 in graduate
courses.
IV.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This investigation was carried out considering as a case
study the EPN, a public institution referenced nationwide.
An online survey was sent to the academic authorities and
professors of the university who are responsible for making
decisions within their academic units. Out of 383 teachers,
only 77 (20%) answered as being authorities of the
institution.
The survey was conducted with nineteen questions using
the Likert scale [34]. The first part consisted of informative
questions and the second part was concerned with previous
experiences of virtual classrooms. Finally, we discovered the
acceptance variables in the use of the tool. Only the relevant
questions will be considered for the investigation; the
questions used can be seen in Table 1.

A.
Metothodology
This
study
used
as
methodology
the
Davis
[35]
Technology Accept Model (TAM), used for a lot of
investigations [15][18][36]-[41] in order to determine the
acceptance of the technology now applied to conclude about
the
acceptance
of
LMS
within
Moodle
used
at
the
University.
The TAM model is based on the perceived ease of use
and the perceived usefulness [15].
The perceived usefulness can be conceptualized as the
belief of teachers that this tool will help them perform their
duties, which can be seen in the learning outcomes in the
curriculum [15].
Many studies on the acceptance of ICTs revealed that
perceived usefulness and ease are key for their intended
usage [15][19][36][42].
This paper will focus on the degree of acceptance by the
academic authorities of ICTs in the classroom, specifically
the level of acceptance of virtual classrooms under Moodle
as tools to support classroom learning.
The ease of use and perceived usefulness by teachers are
the most important factors that will allow us to predict the
intention of using virtual classrooms [15]. Benefits such as
improvement in performance are expected when these
technologies are used.
V.
RESULTS
The results obtained are as follows:
Question 1 Your gender? 31% of the authorities are
women and 69% are men, which is approximately the
promoted gender equality worldwide and is supported at the
state level, and therefore the University.
Question 2. Your age? 34% were between 20 and 30
years old; 29% were between 31 and 40 years of age, 11%
between 41 and 50 years and lastly, 26% were older than 50
years; this reflects young teachers’ participation in the
University decision-making process.
This generational change is due to new government
policies, and it is important that they are open to the use of
new tools such as Moodle.
Question 7. Have you ever taken online classes Question
8? And how many classes have you taken?
Figure 1. Question 7 and Question 8.
As it can be seen in Figure 1, 84% have taken an online
class; the number of classes taken was not representative
because they had taken only between one and three online
classes. This shows us the reality of this university.
Question 9. What is your general perception about
quality of online classes? 80% believed that quality of
classes is good or excellent and 20% believed the quality was
average or bad.
Question 9. What is your general perception about
quality of online classes? and Question 8. How many classes
have you taken?
Figure 2. Question 8 and Question 9.
In this case, in Figure 2, a combination is done with the
information questions. The results were: the more experience
a professor has with the online education, the better the
opinion about its quality.
Question 10. Do you think teachers at the University
include ICTs in their practice and in what percentage? 49%
of those surveyed believed that 25% of the University
professors used ICTs; 39% of the authorities believed ICTs
are used in 50% in classrooms. This is relevant because we
can observe awareness of an existing problem.
Question 11. Do you think the University should include
online education within its study modes? and Question 12.
Which learning mode you consider more relevant in addition
to the classroom?
Figure 3. Question 11 and Question 12.
In these questions in Figure 3, 77% believe that virtual
education has to be included in institutions, and more
specifically 91% consider b-learning as the best option to
support classroom work.

ACHI 2016 : The Ninth International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interactions

Question 14. Do you think virtual classrooms will allow
optimization of teacher’s time and effords? 74% answered
affirmatively.
Question 16. Rate usability of Moodle to be used in
virtual classrooms? Usability is the effectiveness perceived
and the possibility of taking advantage of all its potential (1
very difficult- 5 very easy), 75% rated it as having an
intermediate level of usability.
Question 17. Indicate why you use the following Moodle
communication tools? Table 2 determines why you use the
following communication Moodle tools in the classroom
from the
point view of the
authorities: To
increase
communication frequency, the most used is chat (31%),
Solving
Doubts
(34%),
Present
Case
Studies
(34%),
Feedback (36%), Promoting knowledge construction (54%),
Generate discussion (68) and Encourage participation (43)
.They used the forum as a major communication tool in the
classroom. For Case studies, the blog was the most used,
with 31%. Finally, for Feedback, the mail was the most used
with 22%, as seen in Table 2.
TABLE II.
WHY YOU USE THE FOLLOWING MOODLE
COMMUNICATION TOOLS
Prepared by the authors.
Question 18: Indicate what you use Moodle for? Figure 4
shows that the most common use given to Moodle is to
distribute materials (97%), followed by send Homework
(93%) and Organize information and Resources (89%), as
can be seen in Figure 4.
Question 19. Do you consider virtual classrooms to be an
accurate decision in order to be incorporated as support tool
in
the
learning
process?
91%
answered
yes,
which
corroborates international trends and support in e-learning in
Higher Education.
VI.
DISCUSSION
The results of the investigation revealed that the inclusion
of tools to support learning is just beginning. The efforts of
this research are needed as real contributions to include tools
such as Moodle to support on-campus teaching-learning.
The results showed the full awareness of authorities
regarding the lack of using Moodle at the university; almost
50% of authorities believed that ICTs are used in fewer than
25% of the classrooms.
Awareness is the first step in solving the problem; the
second step is the intention of solving the problem. 91% of
the respondents supported the use of virtual classrooms as
tools for on-campus work.

Variables that helped to confirm the research questions of
this study were: optimization of professors’ time and effort,
ease of use, usability and b-learning as the appropriate
modality for the research. Moodle reflected the optimization
of time and efforts of the teachers in 74%, which will be
reflected in their performance benefits [15].
The second variable considered in the study was ease of
use; 70% of authorities the believed the Moodle is not easy
or difficult to use.
Usability
involved
implicit
sub-variables
as
effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction with 75%. All validated
variables allow us to confirm the hypothesis presented based
on the confirmation of sub-variables involved. These results
will encourage the authorities to include policies for the
usage and implementation of virtual classrooms under
Moodle.
Another important variable was that the most appropriate
e-learning mode in the context of EPN is b-learning. 91%
regarded it as the most appropriate mode through the use of
virtual classrooms.
Another important result in the research that showed the
respondents overwhelmingly considered Moodle as a means
to distribute information, the respondents had a basic
knowledge as to the potential of communication tools that
Moodle
provides
us.
These
results
confirm
the
underutilization of the platform, therefore it is necessary by
the authorities to support training plans for teachers to solve
this problem.

VII.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We must consider that more and better ICTs do not mean
more and better education; it is essential to promote digital
literacy as a new skill for life [15]. One of the most
important contributions of this research has been the
awareness on the part of the academic authorities on the need
to include ICTs in education.
However, there are still many obstacles to be overcome
in order for ICTs to have the desired impact on the teaching-
learning process. The main obstacle is the will of academic
leaders. They have the power in economic and political
topics
to
support
these
changes
which
will
create
transcendence in education as a priority, according to the
development of technology in which we are immersed.
In previous research, as well as in this research, there
exists information about the perception of the Institution’s
students, professors and academic authorities. It would be
wise to carry out a comparative study with other HEIs to find
similarities and differences between participants’ points of
views in the teaching-learning process of their respective
universities in the use of Moodle. After analyzing the stake
holders’ opinion in the teaching-learning process under
Moodle, we propose, as future work a methodological
approach for the usage of virtual classrooms, as well as plans
for teachers training.
