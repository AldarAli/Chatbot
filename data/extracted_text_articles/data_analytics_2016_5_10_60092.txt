Abstract—Traditional travel survey methods have been widely
used for collecting information about urban mobility although,
since middle of the 90’s Global Position System (GPS) has become
an automatic option for collecting more precise data of the
households. But how good is the collected data? many studies
on mobility patterns have focused on the GPS advantages and
leaving aside its issues. However, when it comes to extract the
frequency of the trips and travelled distance this technology faces
some gaps due to related issues, such as signal reception and
time-to-ﬁrst-ﬁx location that turns out in missing observations
and respectively unrecognised or over-segmented trips. In this
study, we focus on two aspects of GPS data for a car-mode,
(i) measurement of the gaps in the travelled distance and (ii)
estimation of the travelled distance and the factors that inﬂuence
the GPS gaps. To asses that, GPS tracks are compared to a
ground truth source. Additionally, the trips are analysed based
on the land use (e.g., urban and rural areas) and length (e.g.,
short, middle and long trips). Results from 170 participants and
more than a year of GPS-tracking show that around 9% of
the travelled distance is not captured by the GPS and it affects
more to short trips than long ones. Moreover, we validate the
importance of the time spent on the user activity and the land
use as factors that inﬂuence the gaps on GPS.

I. INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK
Traditional travel survey methods have been widely used in
transportation research as a tool for collecting information at
an individual or household level (e.g., description of demo-
graphics, travel patterns, trip purpose and mode choice) [1].
Yet, respondents have the tendency to omit short stops, such as
post ofﬁce and ATM and when it comes to numerical answers,
travel time is rounded to simple values like 10, 15, 30 minutes
interval. Likewise it happens to the travelled distance [2].
Nonetheless, with the introduction of the Global Position
System (GPS) and its ﬁrst adoption on transportation studies
in the middle of the 90’s, where Wagner [2] reports one
of the ﬁrst studies that uses GPS for collecting information
of 100 households through logger devices installed in their
vehicles, since that it has been extensively used in combination
with others datasets. Studies [3], [4], and [5] have already
demonstrated the possibility to use GPS data in Transportation
research by capturing the characteristics of different types of
trips. Later studies, such as [6] and [7] evaluated the use of
processed GPS data for both trip tracking and transportation-
mode detection without the support of questionnaires. Their
results showed that trip identiﬁcation deviates slightly from the
census data whereas for mode detection it was not possible to
distinguish between transportation modes with similar speed,
for instances bus and car trips. Trip reporting and therefore
travelled distance are challenging issues that can be achieved
by detecting the transition between transportation-modes al-
though, if many transitions are detected for a single-mode
trip, it turns out in over-reporting of trips and under-reporting
of distance. In studies [8] and [9], the GPS trajectories are
split using features, such as speed and distance, it applies a
good common-sense knowledge of the world, describing that
the start and end points of walk segment may be changes
of transportation mode and Liao et al. [10] uses an prob-
abilistic approach to estimate those changes. Zheng et al.
[11] shows that extracting trip frequencies is a challenging
task, despite his method classiﬁes transportation-mode with
an accuracy of 76%, the precision for trip counting is below
30% due to the over-segmentation, which actually shows that
many studies report the classiﬁcation error as a proportion of
miss-classiﬁcation regardless the over-segmentation. A way to
overcome that is by merging the consecutive trips with similar
transportation-mode using heuristics on the distance and time
between trips or by smoothing the classiﬁcation outcomes [12].
However, signal reception and time-to-ﬁrst-ﬁx (TTFF) are
well known issues of GPS, both of them affecting the reported
distance [13]. Signal reception is mainly inﬂuent for external
factors that can block or reﬂect the signal, it can lead with
either signal loss due to poor satellite reception (e.g., under-
ground travel, bridges and tunnels) or multi-path errors aka
urban canyoning errors because they appear in urban canyons
where the signal is reﬂected by buildings [14]. TTFF aka
cold/warm start is the delay in getting the ﬁrst observation
when the GPS device has been off for a period of time, which
turns out in missing observations at the beginning of the trip
[15].
In this study, we use tracking data from a ﬂeet of shared cars
to (i) assess the gaps present in the GPS-based distance and
87

their possible effect in mobility studies, and (ii) to estimate
the travelled distance and the relevant factors that inﬂuence
the GPS gaps. To accomplish the previous points, we need a
ground truth source that reports the driven kilometres when
the car is used, therefore the odometer-sensor is chosen and
its data is accessible through the Controller Area Network
bus (CAN-bus) [16]. CAN-bus is known as a protocol for
high performance and high reliable serial communication links
between electronic control units (e.g., sensors), and it is
mainly used in the ﬁeld of automotive and industrial control
applications [17]. CAN-bus has been used together with GPS
data to estimate mobility parameters in off-road vehicles, such
as resistance force and wheel slip under different terrain condi-
tions [18], where a GPS logger was used to gather the ground
speed and trajectory; and the gross power and rotational speed
were extracted from the CAN-bus. Furthermore, given that
GPS trajectories are spread across different type of land use,
we use a Geographic Information System (GIS) to make a
distinction between trips in urban and rural areas.
The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section
II describes the datasets and methods for assessing GPS gaps
on the car mode. Section III presents the case study and
the outcomes of this research and Section IV summarise the
ﬁndings by drawing conclusions on it.
II. METHODOLOGY
The data from the present research is drawn from two
sources (a) a car-sharing company named Cambio [19] that
opened its operation in Belgium in 2002, and at this time
(June 2016), it is available in 35 cities with 369 stations, 862
cars and more than 24.000 users. Cambio provided us a dataset
with the reservation details (e.g., distance, duration, start and
ending times) based on CAN-bus data. (b) GPS data that are
collected through loggers installed on selected cars from the
car-sharing company.
A. Dataset description
As one of the interests in this study is to identify the
differences in GPS-based distance and the actually driven
kilometres, we use the car odometer-sensor data as a ground
truth. The access to that such a data is possible through the
CAN-bus. A CAN-bus is known as a protocol for high perfor-
mance and high reliable serial communication links between
electronic control units in the ﬁeld of automotive and industrial
control applications [17], for example it is typically used to
control and automatically calibrate the engine performance in a
vehicle. It was developed as a multi-master message broadcast
system [20] where each element on the network can send
a message (e.g., temperature, state of charge) independently
to the entire network, being the bus priority deﬁned by the
message identiﬁer [21]. The dataset contains information about
the car reservation, including the total distance, reservation
period (e.g., duration), identiﬁers (cars/client/reservation), start
and ending times.
A limitation of this dataset concerns to its granularity, which
is at the reservation level, therefore the reservation period
represents the total duration of the reservation rather than the
travel time, as an illustration, a reservation starts when the car
is picked up from the car charging station and it ends when
the car returns back to the charging station. Consequently, the
reservation period contains not only the travel time but also
the time spent on the participant activities for instances time
doing shopping, time visiting someone, etc. Nonetheless, the
travelled distance and the starting time (ﬁrst trip segment) are
not affected for the aforementioned limitation.
GPS has been used in several studies (Section I) and it
allows tracking targets through their geographical location,
where a GPS logger is a device for collecting locations and
other measurements, such as speed, altitude, heading, accuracy
and timestamp. It can have either a built-in or external antenna
and the data can be stored in the internal memory for being
downloaded later on, or sent it to a centralised repository
through the network. For collecting the data, a GPS logger
GenLoc 53e [22] is installed in the cars, the device can send
the tracking data through the cellular network to a centralised
system in which it is processed. A frequency of 1 Hz is
used for collecting the GPS data and the logger only collects
observations when the car is turned on (i.e., the GPS logger
automatically starts when the car is turned on and stops when
the car is turned off), therefore it can occur that a single
reservation includes more than one trip, which is expressed
as follow:
Ri = {S(i)
1 , ..., S(i)
m }
(1)
where, Ri represents the ith reservation, S(i)
j
is the jth trip
segment within a reservation Ri, such as S(i)
j
∈ {S(i)
1 , ..., S(i)
m }
and m is the number of trip segments per reservation.
B. Data quality
To assess the quality of the GPS-based distance, we cal-
culate missing distance and the TTFF using the following
formulations:
Missing distanceprop = 1 −

(4)
where d() and t() are functions to extract the distance and
start time respectively, S(i)
1
represents the ﬁrst trip segment of
a reservation Ri, and N is the number of observations.
Equation (2) is the proportion of missing distance and it
calculates the overall missing distance for all reservations.
Nevertheless, it can also be applied to a set of trips based
on some conditions, such as land use and trip groups. How-
ever, this formulation faces two possible outcomes, when the
88

outcome is positive it represents an under-reported distance,
whereas it is negative when the distance is over-reporting. This
last scenario can be explained by the GPS accuracy because
under certain conditions (e.g., tunnel, bridge, parking lots)
turns out in jumps around the same location. Those points
can add an extra distance to the trip.
Equation (3) is the average missing distance and it is
expressed in kilometres and (4) is the average of time-to-
ﬁrst-ﬁx, it calculates an average of time difference between
the reservation start time and the timestamp of the ﬁrst GPS
location.
C. Land use
A key research focus of this study is to assess the GPS
gaps, where the land use provides an extra perspective to
analyse those gaps in rural and urban areas, given that the
GPS signal reception could be affected for the high density of
large structures (e.g., buildings, bridges). A GIS tool allows
to identify the land use of a trip [23] (i.e., whether a trip was
performed on either rural or urban area) in such a way that
trips are matched within an administrative area (boundary area
classiﬁed as rural or urban) through the origin and destination
points. Consequently, a precise land use identiﬁcation relies
on the completeness of the geographical information for the
administrative areas.
The administrative areas (in which the trips were performed)
are extracted from c⃝OpenStreetMap contributors (OSM) [24].
OSM is an open access platform for geospatial vector data and
it is often considered complete and appropriate for planning
studies in comparison to other commercial counterparts [25].
D. Regression method
To explain the gaps in GPS data, the factors that inﬂuence
the data collection are identiﬁed through a linear regres-
sion. Linear Regression methods are techniques for modelling
the relationships between a scalar dependent variable and
its explanatory or independent variables aka covariates, that
relationship is modelled through a error term ε, a random
variable that adds noise to the linear relationship between the
dependent and independent variables [26], therefore the model
is expressed as follows:
y = Xβ + ε
(5)
where y is the dependent variable or response variable, X
represents the explanatory variables, β the regression coefﬁ-
cients or effects and ε is the error term.
III. CASE STUDY
The data on this study are part of the Olympus project, a
Flemish initiative to promote the introduction of electric vehi-
cles in Belgium. It was a common project between suppliers,
integrators and users of shared mobility, aiming at developing
tools and systems to enhance multimodal travel behaviour.
Therefore, the multimodal travel behaviour was monitored,
both from the vehicle perspective as from the personal perspec-
tive. From the vehicle perspective, GPS loggers were installed

the Belgian cities Ghent, Antwerp and Leuven, involving 170

In order to get an analysis at different levels, we group the
trips based on the travelled distance into three categories, such
as short, middle and long trips. Table II shows the conditions
for those groups.

less than 10 km.

Those groups and the land use allow to identify which type
of trips are mainly affected when it comes to GPS tracking.
The missing distance for the GPS logging can be noticed
in Fig. 1, where the GPS density curve is shifted to the left
side with respect to CAN-bus curve in both rural and urban
areas, this is another indication of missing distance based on
the land use.
B. Distance measurement gaps
For the travelled distance by car, we consider the missing
distance as the difference between the odometer distance (e.g.,

distance obtained from the CAN-bus data) and the logging
distance (e.g., distance reported by the GPS logger) as it shows
in (2), it turns out that on average 9% of the travelled distance
is not captured by the GPS logger (Fig. 2). It means that for
an average trip with distance 23.9 km the GPS will report on
average 2.1 km less (Table I).

From the groups, we calculate the travelled distance for
both GPS and CAN-bus data. Fig. 3 shows the missing data
for short, middle and long trips within groups of different
land used, in which, urban areas affect more to the short and
middle distance trips (around 81% and 83% respectively) than
the long trips (Table III). Besides, the GPS logging performs
better for long trips in both urban and rural areas, logging 92%
and 95% respectively.

To our understanding, part of the missing data could be
related to the cold/warm start issue that is present on the GPS
technology, where it is required a period of time before ﬁxing
the ﬁrst location. Therefore we assess the TTFF using (4),
which makes use of the starting time as an argument.
C. Explanatory factors
To explain the travelled distance a regression model is ﬁtted
to the GPS data, where the dependent variable is provided
by the CAN-bus data as a travelled distance and from the
GPS data we extract the covariates, such as distance, duration,
average speed and number of trips per reservation.
Others covariates, such as land use is obtained using GIS,
where the origin and destination points are used for classifying
the trips within a rural or urban area. Finally, the time spent
on the user activity (purpose of mobility) is calculated from
the reservation time and the trip duration. Table IV shows a
full description of the covariates.

A summary of the ﬁtted models is depicted in Table V,
where the covariate coefﬁcient is estimated using a regression
model and its signiﬁcant level is based on the p-value. Based
on model 3, the number of trip segments seem to be not
signiﬁcant, on the other hand from model 4 we can notice that
the average speed is a good predictor and makes the duration
less signiﬁcant.
Time spent shows signiﬁcant results on model 5, it means
that the waiting time within trips (e.g., time when the car
is parking) is important factor for modelling the travelled
distance because it adds more periods of cold/warm start to the
GPS logger (i.e., a higher waiting time increases the chances
of missing data). And it is even more signiﬁcant when it is
combined with the trip segments as an average of time spent
on a particular activity per trip segments (e.g., time spent
over trip segments). Land use is another inﬂuential variable
its coefﬁcient indicates that for each trip in the urban area it
will add around a kilometre to the total distance. Based on the
R2, model 7 explains better the travelled distance as a function
of the covariates: distance, average speed, time spent per trip
and land use.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we measure the gaps in the GPS-based
distance using CAN-bus data as a ground truth, likewise
the factors that inﬂuence those gaps were identiﬁed through
regression models. It was found that on averages 9% of
the travelled distance is not captured for the GPS logger,
this is important, considering that many mobility studies are

being conducted using GPS data, and their outcomes might
underestimate the actual travelled distance. Although, it will
depend on the type of land use where the trips are carried out.
In our ﬁndings, the rural area reports 6% of missing distance
whereas the urban area about 13%, which is a clear indication
that urban areas are more susceptible to issues related to
the signal reception, affecting in around one kilometre to the
reported distance (based on the model 7).
Moreover, the model also includes the cold/warm start as
a function of the time spent on the user activity per trip,
which provides an average waiting time between trips. This
last factor should be considered when it comes to the trip
reporting because in real situations round trips have more than
a single trip and long periods of waiting time, consequently,
it adds a delay for getting the ﬁrst valid location.
Part of the missing distance could be corrected by inter-
polating the missing GPS points within a trip. Using a road
network is feasible to route (provide alternative trajectories
between two points by a given transportation mode) and align
the points to a valid location. However, it becomes complicated
when the missing part is at the beginning of the trip because
there is not any reference point to interpolate that part. This
is the case of the cold/warm start.
Our ﬁndings also contrast with other study [27] that reports
4% of missing data (comparison among theoretic GPS points
rather than travelled distance) for a driving mode using smart-
phones as tool for GPS data collection. However, a smartphone
does not have long periods of being off, hence we could
assume that TTFF is not having a big inﬂuence on the data
collection.
Future directions are focused on the GPS data quality for
other transportation modes (e.g., walking, biking and public
transportation) and also the differences across the collection
methods, for example, passive and active logging.
