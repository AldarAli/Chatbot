Abstract—Students with Visual Impairment (VI) face many
challenges in learning mathematics due to its visual nature.
Digital-based learning technologies have reformed the mathe-
matics learning experience for VI students. We collected, ana-
lyzed, and critiqued mathematics learning technologies for VI
students developed between January 2010 and December 2020.
We further classiﬁed apps by the domain, interactive features,
and accessibility approaches to examine the teaching, learning,
and assessment. We found that the audio-based and interactive e-
learning technology may be helpful to improve the mathematical
skills of VI students.
Index Terms—Visually impaired students; Mathematics learn-
ing; Assistive technologies
I. INTRODUCTION
The innovation of new learning technologies, recent im-
provements in Information and Communication Technologies
(ICT), and digital resources has promoted self-directed learn-
ing for students. With the growing interest in self-directed
learning, many developers, researchers, and universities have
launched creative, ﬂexible, and easy-to-learn programs to
improve students’ productivity.
Mathematics has been recognized as a formidable road-
block for students with visual impairment [1]. High-school
mathematics acts as a baseline for students to learn and
persevere in social and professional worlds. With technological
advancements, ICT has provided many resources and educa-
tional tools such as graphics calculators, computers equipped
with dynamic geography software, and web applications for
virtual learning, contributing to an overall better learning
experience in mathematics [2]. However, for students with
visual impairment, the process is further hindered by the
inability to process complex mathematical formulas or visual
cues.
This disadvantage leads to a signiﬁcant knowledge gap
between students with visual impairment and students without
disabilities. According to the U.S. Department of Education,
as mentioned in [3], 15% of all visually impaired students
are ﬁve or more grade levels behind their sighted peers.
This knowledge gap leads to a staggering unemployment rate
among disabled individuals. According to the employment
data collected by American Foundation for the Blind (AFB)
between May 2016 and April 2017, people with vision loss
ages 16-64 had only a 37% labor force participation rate and
a 12% unemployment rate [4]. According to [5], this gap does
not emerge from a lack of interest in STEM-related ﬁelds
because many college students showed equal interest in a
STEM career as their non-disabled peers [6].
This paper carried out a literature review of technologies
developed for VI students in the last decade. The study also
investigated the use of auditory methods in developing the
web application mentioned in [7]. This review is based on the
following research questions:
• What are the reported accessibility approaches and out-
comes in existing mathematics learning apps?
• What are the domains, interactive mechanisms, and ac-
cessibility features of these apps?
• What are the contextual settings in which these applica-
tions are scrutinized?
This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 consists of a
literature study methodology, which discusses search strategy
and inclusion/exclusion criteria; Section 3 provides detailed
information on the included studies. Section 4 concludes the
project along with discussions on results.
II. LITERATURE STUDY METHODOLOGY
This paper examines existing assistive technologies devel-
oped for teaching mathematics and differentiates non-visual
learning and interaction techniques. One reason for the focus
on this discipline is that although ICT has improved the
productivity of people with a physical disability, there are
limited resources for VI students in the academic ﬁeld [8].
With the increased interest in digital learning over the past
decade, several authors have carried out systematic literature
reviews documenting assistive technologies implemented for
VI people. These existing systematic reviews cover the effects
of computer technology on school students in mathematics
learning [9], ICT applications for VI people [8], or digital
learning technology for VI students [10], [11].

A. Search Strategy
Accurately searching for all relevant publications from all
possible sources is the most crucial step in a literature review.
Table I shows the list of databases and search engines.

B. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Based on our research questions, we had the following
search terms: assistive technology, digital learning, high school
mathematics, and visually impaired students. These search
terms with different combinations were searched against the
aforementioned databases and search engines. Once we ob-
tained all the results, we applied inclusion criteria to ﬁlter out
irrelevant publications. Table II shows inclusion and exclusion
criteria for this study.

The search operations on databases and search engines
resulted in 153 publications. After scanning through the title
and abstract, 134 papers were able to pass through all inclusion
criteria. After further scrutiny, we removed duplicate publica-
tions and were left with 126 publications. We applied inclu-
sion criteria on the methodology of the remaining papers; it
yielded 57 papers. We evaluated 57 publications and discarded
publications that did not include digital or math learning.
After expert reading, we decided to have ten publications that
motivated self-learning for VI students.
Figure 1 shows the search and selection summary.
III. RESULTS
This literature review presents 10 publications. In this
section, we explain the study results and analysis.
The main focus of all the studies was to investigate the
different accessibility and interaction approaches. It is inter-
esting to note that most of the studies are somewhat related
to technology rather than pedagogical aspects of learning.
The included studies evaluated the use of three types of
technologies: either mobile/tablet application or an indepen-
dent system or a library/package improving the accessibility
to the existing system. Different accessibility and interactive

approaches investigated by these publications are shown in
Table III.
In total, we presented ten publications investigating ways
to make mathematics content digital and accessible. Seven
of these studies had participants evaluating the usefulness of
the proposed approaches. The number of participants in these
studies varied from 3 to 20. Five studies used audio rendering
of mathematical formulae, which are also compatible with
screen-readers and Braille bars. In these studies, even though
the delivery method of mathematical formulae differed from
the traditional method, participants appreciated audio repre-
sentation.
Authors in one study introduced a novel approach to rep-
resent mathematical graphs through auditory methods. In-
novations in digital learning technologies have led authors
to launch an iPad application to teach students basic math
and prealgebra. The application introduced in [12] uses a
simpliﬁed on-screen keyboard for students with VI and has
been downloaded over 14000 times.
The diverse and accessible techniques mentioned in these
publications make the comparison between them complicated.
Participants in these studies range from teachers, experts, and

students. In summary, the following ﬁndings hold for our
research questions:
• What are the reported accessibility approaches and out-
comes in existing mathematics learning apps?
– The research study mentioned in the literature review
employed a variety of accessible methods. The main
objectives of the studies include ’the alternate deliv-
ery method’ and ’the effectiveness of the technology.’
Nine publications stated that students appreciated the
audio representation of mathematical formulae.
• What are the domains, interactive mechanisms, and ac-
cessibility features of these apps?
– Three studies investigated the effectiveness of a
digital platform to teach mathematics to students
with VI. One study introduced the use of soniﬁcation,
earcons, and speech synthesis to explore mathemat-
ical function graphs. Auditory methods were the
most frequently applied technology in the included
studies.
• What are the contextual settings in which these applica-
tions are scrutinized?
– The VI participants evaluated most of the included
studies using different interaction methods varying
from the keyboard keys, mouse, trackpad, and touch-
pad. All research studies achieved their desired re-
sults.
IV. CONCLUSION
This paper presented 10 assistive technologies developed
between 2010 and 2020 that focused on improving mathemat-
ics accessibility and offered a new way to teach mathematics
to students with VI. After a systematic review of the focus of
studies, the subdomain, and the context in which the studies
took place, we can conclude that digital learning with auditory
and tactile methods can improve mathematics education for VI
students.
