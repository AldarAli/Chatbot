Abstract— The objective of this work is to develop a deep
learning model for classification of smoke and no smoke
regions in aerial recorded videos. For that, a deep belief
network model was selected and implemented. First, frames
were extracted from the provided videos. The Gaussian
Mixture Model (GMM) was applied as background estimation
algorithm. Then, the Deep Belief Network algorithm was
applied to detect the smoke for the candidate region. Deep
Belief Network was implemented and tested on different
datasets.
Overall,
the
obtained
results
reveal
that
our
implemented model was able to accurately classify smoke and
no smoke regions. Through the experiments with input videos
obtained from various weather conditions, the proposed
algorithms were useful to detect smoke in forests to minimize
the damage caused by forest fires onto vegetation, animals and
humans.
Keywords- smoke detection; GMM; Deep Belief Network.

INTRODUCTION
Video-based smoke detection systems are composed of
two types of methods. The first one relies on static features,
such as the color of the smoke. The second method uses
dynamic feature like movement, texture, etc.
Our proposed method of smoke detection uses dynamic
features based on the Gaussian Mixture Model [1] and the
Deep Belief Network (DBN) [2][3] as a classifier to reduce
the false alarms and to increase the detection rate of video
smoke detection systems.
Several researchers have played a significant role in the
development of useful video smoke detection systems. We
focused on some of them. Hu et al. [4] extract the motion
feature and use the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
[5] as classifier. Chen et al. [6] extract motion, color and
energy features to classify smoke and no smoke regions
using Support Vector Machine SVM [7]. Toreyin et al. [8]
extract motion, color, energy and texture as features and
classify the smoke and no smoke regions using decision
trees.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the
proposed
technique
intended
for
smoke
detection
is
presented and detail in Section 2. Experimental results are
shown in Section 3. Conclusion and perspectives are
presented in the last section.

THE PROPOSED METHOD
A.
Smoke Motion Detection
First, extracting candidated regions is a crucial step to
know the nature of motion (ordinary or chaotic). Labeling
motion regions could be done by using three methods:
Optical
Flow,
Background
Subtraction
and
Temporal
differencing.
The
technique
intended
for
background
subtraction that we used in simulations is the Gaussian
Mixture Model [1]. This method subtracts the background
image from the current frame to find regions containing
motions. In this approach, the camera is stationary.
Each pixel in the frame is defined by a mixture of K
Gaussian
distributions.
The
probability
that
a
pixel
represents the intensity is defined by:

Fisher Vector
Fisher vector [9] represents a dimension reduction
technique that can be used for classification as well. It picks
a new dimension that gives maximum separation between
means of projected classes and minimum variances within
each projected class. The Fisher Vector is an image
representation obtained by pooling local image features. It is
mostly used as an image descriptor in visual classification
and
improves
the
classification
performance
of
the
representation. Our developed idea is realized as follows:
•
Fitting a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
•
Saving and loading the fitted GMM
•
Computing the Fisher Vectors based on the fitted
GMM
C.
Deep Belief Network
Deep Belief Network is a tool of machine learning that
represents a stack of Restricted Boltzmann Machine [10].
After the pre-training process with the RBMs, the network
acts
like
a
multi-layer
Perceptron
[11]
using
the
backpropagation [12] as tool to accomplish the training. The
architecture of the used Deep Belief Network is presented in
Figure 1.
Our aim is to improve the performance of smoke
detection. An efficient method is presented using deep belief
network. The algorithm is separated into two major phases.
The first phase is to segment the candidate regions in video
sequences. The Fisher criterion is applied to maximize the
ratio of the separation of the two classes with respect to their
dispersions. The Fisher criterion [9] is similar to Principle
components analysis but it focuses on maximizing the
separability
among
known
categories.
Second,
the
normalized candidate areas are identified by the novel
structure
based
on
deep
belief
network.
Finally,
the
corresponding alarm is given by the identification results.
The algorithm schematic diagram is shown in Figure 2.

Discussion
First of all, we have extracted frames from smoke-based
videos. The size of each frame of the videos is set to 320 ×
240 pixels. The main idea of our work is to extract the
candidate regions related to the smoke movement which will
inserted in a vector of characteristics.
The use of criterion of Fisher allowed us to keep the
most important values in this feature vector to make the
classification then by the deep belief network. As we
mentioned before, we used the GMM [1] as a technique to
detect the motion of smoke that is considered a chaotic
movement. The results are shown in the Figure 4.

At this stage, we have extracted frames from
smoke-based videos. The size of each frame of the videos is
set to 320 × 240 pixels. The fixed parameters of the deep
belief network are defined as:
Number of hidden layers=2
Number of epochs=400
Learning rate = 0.6
After fixing the features that we classified using
deep belief network, we changed the classifier to SVM [7].
The comparison between the proposed method and the
method using SVM is based on these criteria:

where
TP: True Positive smoke Frames
TN: True Negative Frames
FP: False Positive Frames
FN: False Negative Frames
In this section, the frames containing noise such as
moving people and fog give us an idea about the robustness
of the proposed method. We notice a slight modification in
the different criterion of comparison. These results are
exhibited in the Table I.
This table shows that the developed method presents
in the absence of the noise the best value of accuracy and
Recall compared to the classification with SVM [7]. The
presence of the noise affects slightly the accuracy and the
precision.
These
values
decrease

with
noise.
Moreover, the application of our proposed method helps us
to find the smoke and the no smoke regions, as shown in
Figure 5.

IV.
CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES
In this paper, we proposed a novel approach for smoke
detection using Deep Belief Network. We extracted the
candidate regions by using GMM [1].
For a better classification, we used the Fisher vector
which gives us maximum separation between the means of
different classes and keeps just the most important values.
Then, the extracted feature vector was fed into deep belief
network to calculate many criteria such as accuracy, F1
score, Precision and Recall. The robustness of this method
is tested by adding noise. Finally, to evaluate the noise
influence, we tested our method on noisy data. These
promising
results
provide
clear
evidence
about
the
capability of such a network in recognizing smokes in our
recorded frames easily. Train the developed method with a
significant amount of data will undoubtedly provide more
promising results and would help in accelerating the next
generation
of
surveillance
and
real-time
monitoring
systems. As perspectives to our work, the future step is to
combine the deep belief network to FasterR-CNN to
classify and localize simultaneously smoke and no smoke
regions.
