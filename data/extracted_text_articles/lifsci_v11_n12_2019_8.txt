Abstract—This  article  expands  the  presentation  made  at 
SENSORDEVICES 2018. The author makes available to the 
public one year of wrist actimetry in real life, stored at one 
second  epochs.  The  technical  details  of  the  system  used 
(Motionwatch8) are described and they show why quantitative 
methodologies applied to actigraphy are tied to the system used 
for data acquisition. A first evaluation of that data calls for 
new ways for actimetry analysis and actigraphy display. Most 
of the values recorded are equal to zero and therefore the 
information  they  provide  is  a  main  target  for  actigraphy 
analysis. It is explained the difference of the quantity of zeros 
epochs when one second and  one minute  epochs are used. 
Series analysis and percent of zeros parameters are proposed 
and exemplified. In particular, the analysis of series is a new 
area of studies for actigraphy because it changes the meaning 
of the data recorded.  The daily pattern of series is constant 
along  the  year  and  the  importance  of  long  zero-series  is 
underlined: that small percent of lengths is not distributed 
randomly.  The analysis of series also suggested the idea that 
the couples of series, not the single series, could be functionally 
similar and a actigraphy "pulse" analysis could be worthwhile 
to further evaluate. The percent of zeros parameter is applied 
to  long  and  short  time  intervals  and  it  could  be  a 
complementary  tool  for  wake-sleep  studies.  The  research 
described in this article is a ground breaking type of work that 
creates new questions more than providing answers, but it 
already offers new insights on actigraphy data.

 INTRODUCTION 
This  article  expands  the  presentation  made  at 
SENSORDEVICES  2018,  the  Ninth  International 
Conference  on  Sensor  Device  Technologies  and 
Applications [1], adding details on the system  used, the 
analysis suggested and some preliminary results.
Wrist actigraphy has a long history that starts in the 
1950's and develops until today with research and clinical 
applications [2]. The terms “actimetry” and “actigraphy” are 
used as synonymous for motion activity measures where 
”actimetry  emphasizes  the  measurement  aspect  of  the 
technique and actigraphy emphasizes the descriptive aspects 
of the technique” [3]. 
Clinical  guidelines  and  researches  suggest  that  wrist 
actimetry  is  particularly  useful  in  the  documentation  of 
circadian rhythms, of sleep disorders, of treatment outcomes 
and as an adjunct to home monitoring of several pathologies. 
During  the  day,  it  is  possible  to  quantify  the  physical 
exercise  and (with calibration)  recognize  some type  and 
intensity of the exercise. Reviews are available in several 
application areas [4]-[8]. 
Most published data use a one minute epoch, i.e., the 
system stores one piece of data each minute, and recordings 
are limited to a few days. The reasons for that selection of 
parameters are mainly practical, due to the characteristics of 
the available instrumentation and the logistic/organizational 
issues of the recordings, especially in real life. That selection 
of parameters sets limits on the possible evaluations of the 
data.  Shorter  epochs  of  actimetry  could  allow  better 
correlations when the data is used for wake/sleep studies 
because  the  “gold  standard”  reference  is  the 
polysomnography (PSG), where data is presented in pages 
30s long with signals in the range of 0-100 Hz. Without long 
continuous  recordings,  it  is  unknown  if  and  how  much 
Infradian  rhythms,  maybe  spanning  over  years,  have  an 
impact  on  the  evaluation  of  shorter  recordings.  The 
technology advances offer today the possibility to record 
more data and in an easier way, but still few long term 
recordings are described in literature [9]-[15] and only few 
groups  explore  shorter  epochs  [16].  None  of  those 
“extended” recordings are available to the public. To explore 
those two areas, the only option is to make longer recordings 
with shorter epochs and here we describe one of them that 
the  author  published   on  the  National  Sleep  Research 
Resource  (NSRR)  platform  [17].  That  data  expands  the 
universe of wrist actigraphy both in length (from week to 
years) and in granularity (from minutes to seconds). 
Section II describes the modality of the recording, the 
export  of  the  data  from  the  original  format  and  the 
assembling of an activity file of one year. 
Section III  explains why each brand and each model of 
actigraphic systems needs its own computation of numerical 
data. 
Section IV describes the main characteristic of the data, 
options to study it and the most important findings of those 
preliminary results.
Section  V  recaps  the  methodology  issues  and  we 
conclude our work in Section VI.
Unless otherwise noted, the data used are those recorded 
by the author and available to the public [17]. Computations 
were made with the software Motionware (V.1.1.16)  from 
CamNtech Ltd (Cambridge, UK), the manufacturer of the 
Motionwatch8  (MW8)  activity  monitor  used  for  the 
recording [18], or by programs written by the author in 
Octave [19]. When data outside the published year is used, 
raw data are available from the author on request.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The subject of the recording is the author: age 62 at the 
start of the recording, male, BMI= 26.3, no known major 
chronic pathologies. Data is collected using a MW8 on the 
non-dominant wrist. MW8 is a clinical system extensively 
used  and it is a recognized reference in the field [20].  The 
monitor is set to store data in an epoch of one second in 
"normal"  mode.  That  means  that  the  intensity  of  the 
movement on the axis perpendicular to the surface of the 
unit, is measured by an accelerometer sampled at 50 Hz. 
Data  is transformed  in a  single  value  of a  custom  unit 
(Counts) each second. The monitor acquires also a value of 
light  intensity  (Lux)  each  second.  Details  are  described 
elsewhere by the manufacturer [21]. A maximum of 36 hours 
of activity and lights data is stored at 1s epoch in the unit and 
therefore there is the need for a data download every day. A 
diary is kept of major events (travels, flu, mismanagement, 
etc.). As usual in this kind of recordings, it is not possible to 
know the exact position of the unit on the wrist and if and 
when the photocell of the unit  somehow was obscured 
(garments, tools, etc.). 
The marker available on the logger is used to signal when 
the unit is not worn. Using the MotionWare software, the 
values inside the marked intervals are modified from 0 to 
“n/a”. Then, the recordings are joined in files containing 
more or less 10 days (one million lines) and exported as 
.CSV  files.  Using  a  spreadsheet  (OpenCalc  –  Apache 
OpenOffice – Apache Open Foundation), lines “n/a” are 
changed to “-1” and the data is divided in 9 columns: year, 
month, day, hour, minute, seconds, counts, lux integers, lux 
decimals. That format allows the files to be easily accepted 
by several software programming languages.
With programs we wrote in Octave, activity Counts are 
extracted, saved as .MAT files and joined in one year long 
file, for a total of 31.576.501 data lines. The time of the file 
is continuous, aligned to “summer” time (UTC+2: 27 March 
to 30 October 2016; 26 March to 29 October 2017) used in 
Italy in June, at the beginning of the recording. Evaluations 
and graphics of this article are computed from that file using 
programs we wrote in Octave.

RAW DATA
This paper works over the data acquired with the activity 
monitor model Motionwatch8 (MW8) from CamNtech Ltd. 
It is not possible to directly compare the numbers out of that 
unit with other models or brands because each system has his 
own way of  data acquisition, a well known situation not 
improved in the past 20 years [22], as described below. 
A.
Analog Band-pass. 
At  the  end  of  last  century  few  systems  for  wrist 
actigraphy were used,  like the Geweiler  from Sing Medical, 
Aktometer  from  ZAK,  Actiwatch  from  Cambridge 
Neurotechnology,  
 Motionlogger  from  Ambulatory 
Monitoring  Instruments  (AMI)  and  Colburn  from 
IMSystems  and  they   used  different  approaches.  For 
instance,  AMI offered a system with  selection of ranges 
from 1 to 9 Hz and  the Actiwatch used a  1-6 Hz bandpass. 
[23]. Observations from the group of Van Someren  [24] 
started a change that moved Actiwatch  to the bandwidth 3-
11 Hz. Today, AMI product range is on a 2-3 Hz band-pass 
while CamNtech Ltd (heir of  Cambridge Neurotechnology) 
stays on the 3-11 Hz. For other systems  available in the 
market today, the band-pass seems an  “implicit” value, not 
described  in  user  manuals,  white  papers  or  “validation” 
studies.  The  issue  seems  not  of  interest  both  from  a 
marketing and from a clinical point of view, meaning that the 
value is not even mentioned [6],[25]. 
B.
Sampling. 
Sampling rates of professional systems available in the 
market today, range from 30 to 256 Hz, the intensity range of 
the accelerometer is typically +/- 8G and quantisations used 
are from 8 to 12 bits. After sampling, the systems set a 
threshold in order to remove “noise” from different sources 
and below that level a 0 value will be stored. 
C.
Data reduction. 
Data reduction is a common issue for many biological 
signals and especially for sleep, caused by  the ability to 
collect much more data than humans like to manage. Old 
professionals that remember ink and paper polysomnography 
will probably also remember their old professor boasting that 
he was able to “read”  recordings just looking on the side of 
the paper batch. It was a simple analog data reduction of 
more than 100 times because it was one line every  two 
pages of 30 seconds data. For the MW8, the data reduction is 
made on line when only the maximum of the 50 values 
sampled each second is stored [26]. That decision implies the 
assumption  that  if  there  is  some   movement  inside  the 
second, then the integral of the movement will be a constant 
multiple of the peak value. In other words, that the integral 
of  the movement will be similar to that of a rectangular form 
that changes only one side but not the other. An assumption 
without  a  published  demonstration,  but  that  is  “good 
enough”  from  the  manufacturer  evaluation  (personal 
communication).  Those  are  the  “raw  data”  available.  A 
second step of the data reduction, possible on or off  line, is 
the use of longer epochs, which is the sum of the one second 
values over an interval. If we use an epoch of 30 sec in the 
system settings, that will provide a number every 30 sec that 
become the raw data available out of the system.
With the situation described above, the algorithms used 
for data evaluation are tied to the individual system. 
D.
Measurement error.  
The  Micro  electronic  mechanical  systems  (MEMS) 
technology used today inside actigraphs does not suffer of 
the  aging,  lost  calibration  and  inter  system  calibration 
differences as much as the old piezoelectric sensors. The 
calibration of systems (acceleration measurement) from the 
manufacturing  is  inside  a   +/-  5%  for  1g  (personal 
communication) and MW8 has an expected lifetime of 7 
years without the need of any further calibration.
Unfortunately, the most important expected error is not 
coming from the instrument, but from its positioning. Even if 
the oval design of the MW8 is a nice improvement over the 
76

squared models of the past, displacements along and around 
the wrist are still possible. Those displacements create a 
fluctuation from  what  would be the measurement  if the 
system could be placed always in the same position for the 
full  recording.  We did  not  find  any  published  paper 
regarding that issue. Most published articles that discuss and 
“validate” algorithms simply does not include the topic. So 
we set up a recording of two units on the same wrist for one 
month. It is not the best way to measure that error because 
the presence of a second unit by itself creates a bias. A better 
option would be to setup a grid of sensors around the wrist 
that  covers  all  possible  positions  and  then  check  the 
relationship among them. The development of such a grid 
would be useful also for other researches on the kinematics 
of the wrist. However, with the two recorders at least we get 
a dimension of the issue. Relative position, case and strap of 
the two instruments were randomly exchanged during the 
daily data download, trying to minimize the error sources 
different from the change of position on the wrist. 
Table I shows the comparison of the results of the sleep 
analysis for the two units performed by the Motionware 
software out of 34 nights. Note that in order to compute the 
sleep analysis the Motionware software uses 30 sec epoch, 
summing up the 1 sec raw data.
Table I. Co-recording of two MW8 on the same wrist of 34 nights. Max 
positive, max negative and mean absolute differences of sleep analysis 
parameters  between the two units.
 For each parameter, in Table I it is shown the  maximum 
positive and negative  difference, a typical value (in order to 
provide  the  reader  with  a  relative  dimension  of  the 
differences) and the mean of the absolute difference for all 
the nights. 
Motionware  software,  offers  also  the  statistics  Non 
Parametric Circadian Rhythm Analysis (NPCRA) and 24h 
Average, as shown in Table II. 
Table II. Co-recording of two MW8 on the same wrist of 38 days. 
In this case all 38 days were used, including 4  days not 
fully co-recorded due to management mistakes, therefore 
adding  more  variability.  Even  so,  the  differences  are 
minimal. If we perform those  analyses over one week we 
find Table III, where there are some differences. 
Table III. Co-recording of two MW8 on the same wrist of 8 days.
Those tables suggest that the error due to the movement 
of the instrument itself has a different importance for each 
parameter, depending on the length of the recording.

RESULTS
Out of 31,576,501 samples, there are 24,936,212 zeros 
(78.97%), 1,034,485 n/a (3.28%) and 5,605,804 (17.75%) 
non-zero values. If we compare data stored at one second 
epoch with data stored at one minute epoch (most used 
epoch in published articles), we find a completely different

ratio between zero and non-zero samples. Over the 1440 
minutes of a day, a typical result for one minute epoch would 
be 555 (39%) zero and 884 (61%) non-zero epochs while for 
the one second epoch, zeros are about 80 % of the total. How 
is that possible? The answer is that one minute epochs are 
computed as the arithmetical sum of 60 one second samples 
and most of those samples are zero. For instance, in the 
lower line of Figure 1, minutes 02.41, 42 and 43 would be 
counted as 3 active minutes using a one minute epoch, while 
there are only 5 seconds of detected movements. 
Figure 1. Examples of recordings at epochs of one second: day upper side, 
night lower. Actimetry in Counts (black) with range on the left, light in Lux 
(yellow) with range on the right.
Since the large part of the samples are zeros, we need to 
extract information also from those zero values. Here below 
we discuss some new possibilities.
A.
Series analysis
One option for data analysis of zero values could be to 
show not the single epoch values, but the length of the 
succession  of  series  of  zero  and  non-zero  values.  For 
instance,  the  sequence  ...,0,m,n,0,0,0,p,q,r,0....  will  be 
described using positive and negative integers as …,2,-3, 3,...
In the recorded year, there is a sequence of 1.429.113 
zero series and, of course, the same amount of non-zeros 
ones. The distribution of lengths of series at one second 
epoch in the year is shown in Figure 2, with non-zero series 
on the right and zero series on the left. The zero series can be 
long up to 7400 seconds, the non-zero series up to 623 
seconds. There is a peak of several hundred thousand series 
around few short lengths. 
Figure 2. Full year. X axis: length of the series. Zeros series on the left, 
non-zero series on the right. Y axis: number of series.
If we zoom in Figure 2, we see (Figure 3) that, over one 
year, the number of zero and non-zero series longer than 10 
seconds is a small percent of the total. But, that small percent 
of lengths are not distributed randomly. When we plot the 
series, with the length of non-zero series up and that of zero 
series down and the distance between the series equal to the 
length of the series, we get a graph as shown in Figure 4. 
Figure 3. Full year - Zoom of Fig.4 X axis , zeros series on the left, non-
zero series on the right Y axis– number of series. 
The pattern is clearly bimodal and that daily profile is 
consistent over the year. 
Figure 4. Day one, Start time 09:52:00.  X axis: 100,000 seconds – Y-axis: 
length of the series in seconds: non-zero series up, zero series down. 
We may then try studying those series as states of a 
system  and  search  for  models  of  their  dynamics.  For 
instance, we may evaluate one step from zero series or from 
non-zero  series.  If  we  plot  the  length  of  zero  series  as 
negative values and non-zero series that follows them as 
positive, as in Figure 5, we see that only short zero series can 
move to long non-zero ones. 
Figure 5. Full year. X axis: zeros series, length in seconds. Y axis : non- 
zero series that follow, in seconds.
In the same way, Figure 6 shows that only short non-zero 
series  can  move  to long zero  ones. This  suggests,   for 
instance, a model like the one in Figure 7 and the possibility 
to make statements on the data dynamics without any a priori 
hypothesis.

We know from Polysomnography (PSG) that the body 
activity changes during those long zero series because they 
cover  different  sleep  stages  and  we  then  try  to  further 
investigate those long zero series. The year of data available 
on the NSRR platform is part of a larger project [27]. The 
recording started 6 months before of the published year and 
the internal report of those first six month is public [28].
Figure 6. Full year. X axis: non-zeros series, length in seconds. Y axis: 
non-zero series that follow, length in seconds. 
Figure 7. Model of series as states.
On the data recorded during the first month (27 days, one 
minute  epoch)  the  minimum  value  of  the  longest  zero 
succession of each night was  30 minutes, i.e., each night 
there is a zero-series long at least 30 minutes. Let's call D1 
that group >=30 minutes. More than one series of  that D1 
group can be found in a night, up to four in that month. We 
may replicate the procedure  (i.e., at least one value each 
night) below the D1 level and get two more groups: D2, 
from 16 to 29 minutes  and D3, from 9 to 15 minutes. 
If  we  add  the  hypothesis  that  all  the  D1  series  are 
functionally similar, we may sum them and found a mean 
value of the total  of a night  of about  100 minutes.  As 
described in that report [28], the analysis of the following 5 
months (one minute epoch) afterwards demonstrated that 
there are nights without D1 series and the total D1 time in a 
night may vary from 0 to more than 230 minutes. More 
important,  D1  series  were  possible  only  during  sleep 
(personal communication). It was a first rough evaluation, 
but  the  hypothesis  that  long  zero  series  are  linked  to 
physiology was worth to consider. 
In a complex system like the human body, it is naive to 
think to find a fixed value for a threshold. It is more probable 
that the threshold, if it really exists. is fluctuating over time. 
For the moment, the fixed thresholds of D1 and D2 will 
provide a gross evaluation and if we evaluate D1 and D2 
along the year we find a further support to the idea of two 
“types” of series hidden inside the D1-D2 ranges. We may 
sum day after day the length of the D2 zero series of the year 
and compare the real increment with a theoretic linear one. 
For a better display the linear sum is used as the zero axis 
and we get Figure 8. We keep the convention that zero series 
are a negative number. When the line is on the positive side, 
there is a cumulative shorter amount of D2 compared to the 
theoretic linear sum of the daily mean. When the line of the 
graph  increases  then that  day there  is less D2 then the 
theoretic linear mean. 
Figure 8 shows a very small fluctuation similar to a 
bimonthly rhythm. The D2 daily mean is 6680 seconds and 
the mean length of a series is 1263 seconds, so about 5 series 
are needed each night.

the mean along the year. X axis seconds from recording start, Y axis 
difference in  seconds. Starting date 17 June 2016, near the summer solstice.
If we plot the values of the D1 series over the published 
year (Figure 9), we see that  only few of them are longer than 
5000 seconds (about 80 minutes), with a series mean of 2466 
seconds. The daily mean is 4865 seconds, so one series is 
usually not enough to reach the daily mean.

When we perform for the D1 zero series group the same 
computation done for D2, we get Figure 10. 
Figure 10. Difference of the  D1 Zero Series sum less the sum of the 
theoretic daily mean along the year. X axis seconds from recording start, Y 
axis difference in  seconds. 
It  is  possible  to  note  a  small  fluctuation  similar  to  a 
circannual rhythm with peaks around middle August and 
middle April.  The  distance  between  the August  - April 
peaks  is  about 80.000 sec (nearly 24 hours). That may 
seem a large gap, but that would mean that from August to 
April the mean daily length of D1 series is about 15 minutes 
longer than the April to August one, a small amount largely 
inside the day to day variability. 
B.
Pulse analysis
If we compute the basic model in Figure 7, we find that 
the central part of the short series is delimited by a threshold 
with daily values ranging from 20 to 40 seconds. That means 
that zero and non zero series long up to 20 to 40 seconds can 
freely  move  among  them,  but  above  those  values  that 
freedom is lost and longer intervals must be followed by 
series  below  that  threshold.  We  may  think  that  lost  of 
freedom as the creation of couples of series, but it could also 
be that that "bond" is only more visible, i.e., that the “bond” 
that appears for long series exists, somehow, also for the 
sequences of short series. If we compute the distribution of 
couples of zero and non zero series, we find that the most 
important one is the (-1, 1) that covers 7% of the couples of 
the year. The couple (-1,+1) means that the accelerometer 
measures something that is shorter than one second and that 
is preceded by a pause longer than one second but shorter 
than 2 seconds. With the MW8 we cannot explore more in 
details  that couple, due to the data processing characteristics 
explained in Section II. That couple is something that seems 
a pulse or a beat. We may suspect some kind of artefact, for 
instance from the heartbeat, but that would not explain the 
very long zero series, that would be randomly interrupted by 
an artefact. 
The  above  was  suggestive  toward  the  analysis  of 
actigraphic recordings as if those couples of series were 
“pulses”. We may think of activity driven pulses (+/-) like 
“contraction and relax” or inactivity driven pulses (-/+) like 
“charge and discharge” and in the following we will consider 
the latter. 
That “pulse” approach is new for actigraphy and in order 
to explore an uncharted area, an analogy could help. If we 
use  the  electrocardiography  (EKG)  analogy,  then  the 
actigram is like the electrocardiogram and the length of the 
“actigraphy pulses” (i.e., the length of one zero-series plus 
the  following non zero one) is analogue to the R-R interval 
(where R is a point corresponding to the peak of the QRS 
complex of the EKG wave; and R-R is the interval between 
successive Rs). Figure 5 can then be “read” as the plot of the 
set of those pulses.
The range of R-R interval is about 200-2000 msec and 
the one of what we may call Wrist Actigraphy Pulse (WAP) 
is 2-8000 seconds. Those ranges barely touch each other and 
therefore R-R and WAP work in two different time scale. 
That  would  make  those  data  complementary  for  the 
evaluation of  lifestyles, and for sleep it has been already 
done [16].
So, it seems that WAP is a possible way to expand the 
study  of  zero  and  non  zero  series  and  that  would  put 
actigraphy  in the  same  “basket”  of  other  pulse  analysis 
(HRV, Arterial pressure variability (APV),  Oxygen pulse 
variability [29], etc.).
C.
Percent of zeros
A more traditional approach, could be counting the zeros 
inside a defined interval. 
1)
One minute.
For instance, if we take one minute and we count the 
zeros, for each minute we get a number between 0 (maximal 
activity) and 60 (total immobility). The plot of the first day 
of the recording (1440 minutes) would be as in Figure 11.
Figure 11.  Number of Zeros -Day one  Start time 09:52:00. X axis in 
minutes, Y axis number of zeros in a minute.
Figure 12. Day one at epochs of one second: Actimetry in Counts (black) 
with range on the left, light in Lux (yellow) with range on the right. Start 
time 09:52:00
The software Motionware provides a very similar value 
named “Immobile time Percent” inside the Assumed Sleep

Time (Table I), but accepting some very short activity [21], 
while in our case all values must be zero. We can compare 
Figure  11 with the standard Motionware activity plot in 
Counts as in Figure 12. With the zeros counting, it is easier 
to see that also during the day there are several minutes 
without any movements.
2)
Three hours 
If we divide the day in eight segments of three hours, we 
can count the number of zeros inside those intervals and get 
8 numbers each  day.  It  is also possible to express  that 
number as a percent, i.e., percent of zeros (POZ) in 3 hours 
(POZ3h),  and plot them in a circular way, instead of against 
a linear baseline. In that way, we get Figure 13 where the 
circumference is the year with the value 1 (total immobility) 
and the centre is the 0 (maximal activity) and there is a dot 
for each day.
Figure 13. Full year. Zero values percent of 3 hours segments. The time 
is the start of the 3 hours segment. Circumference is one year, divided in 
months, 0 is 17 June 2016. 
With that type of  display, it is possible to see that  a 
percent  of  zero  values  lower  than  50%  (internal 
circumference)  is  exceptional  and  that  the  circadian 
behaviour is consistent over the year in all segments. 
3)
Twelve hours
Figure 14. X axis: day of the year - Y axis: zeros percent in the time 
intervals 10am-11pm (blue) 11pm-10am (red).
If we divide the day in two pieces, like from 10 am to 11. pm 
and from 11 pm to 10 am, and compute for each day of the 
year the zero values percent of the two segments we can plot 
Figure  14.  The  two  segments  show  a  quite  different 
behaviour along the year (few days with more than 5% of n/a 
data are removed for a better graph display). 
The change of the clock to summertime (27 March to 30 
October  2016;  26  March  to  29  October  2017)  may  be 
responsible  for  some  asymmetry  in  Figures  13  and  14 
because solar time is from day 135 to day 285. 
4)
Segmentation
Motionware software offers the option to compute a 24 
hours mean of the activity. If we average 3 months we see 
the pattern in Figure 15. 
Figure 15 .  24 hours activity mean over 3 months. Upper graph no 
smooth, then 10 minutes smooth and  one hour smooth. Start hour midnight. 
X axis 24 hours with hour divisions, Y axis Counts
Something similar would it be meaningful for POZ of 1 
minute (POZ1)? If we plot the sum of POZ1 of 3 months for 
segments of  24 hours +/- 6 minutes,  the pattern more 
visually similar to the one of a single day is exactly 24 hours 
(Figure 16). 
Figure 16.  POZ1, 3 months sum of segments from 1434 to 1446 minutes. 
X axis minutes, Y axis POZ1 sum.
So, it seems that the segmentation of 24  hours is useful. 
We would get similar results from autocorrelation, but the 
methodology would require hypothesis on the data structure. 
The  approach  used,   evaluating  some  segmentation  and 
selecting the one more similar to the single day profile, is 
suitable for a machine learning algorithm and does not need 
hypothesis on the data structure. The development of that 
algorithm is a task for future work.
For the moment, let us accept the 24 hours segmentation. 
If we compute the sum of POZ1 on the 24h segmentation, 
we find that the parameter is sensible enough to show the 
summer hour shift (Figures 17 and 18).

hours segmentation (1440 minutes).  Y axis POZ1 sum.  Summer time 5 
months in blue, standard time 5 months in red.  Start time 09:52:00
It is possible to note that the profile in Figure 17 has two 
levels divided by two long transitions and therefore there is a 
large range of values that split the profile in two separated 
segments, as demonstrated in Figure 14. In Figure 13, those 
transitions are in the two segments 10 p.m.-01 a.m. and  07 
a.m.-10 a.m. 
Figure 18.  Sum of  POZ1 over 1 week using a 24 hours segmentation 
(1440 minutes). Y axis POZ1 sum. Summer time in blue, standard time in 
red.  Start time 09:52:00
The description of the plotted lifestyle of the subject 
would be: walk and breakfast (the first peak in Figure 15 and 
the last in Figure 17), office time, walk and lunch (peak), 
office  time,  walk  and  dinner  (peak),  after  dinner  until 
bedtime.  Overall,  it  seems  that  the  transitions  from  full 
wakefulness to deep sleep and back suggested by the activity 
levels, are long, taking more than one hour each. Those long 
transitions possibly explain why, in general, several different 
actigraphy systems and methodologies are able to recognise 
the wake and sleep circadian levels, because the selection of 
the threshold does not have to be  precise. That will be true 
as long as the lifestyle pattern is “simple” as in this case and 
there are no important naps or long awakening at night.
It is worth to note that the use of POZ, like all the percent 
parameters, moves the scale of the parameter from the very 
high numerical difference of the Counts as in Figure 12, 
inside a recording and among recordings, to a fixed scale for 
all. The price to pay for that advantage is the losing of the 
information about the relative intensity of the movement. 
The “automatic” compression from the scale used for POZ1, 
makes the graph less spiky and usually there is no need for 
added operations in order to decide where the peaks are. We 
may then think of Figure 17 as the probability distribution of 
the movement of the non dominant wrist of the subject's 
lifestyle. 
From co-recordings  made after the published year,  it 
seems possible to relate the slow down of activity after 
dinner with the dip of the core temperature [27]. So, it seems 
the  POZ1  has  the  potential  to  become  an  useful 
complementary parameter for actimetry data analysis.
V.
DISCUSSION
A first step needed in any research  is to understand the 
tools we use. Section II and Section III explain how the 
Motionwach8  works  and  why  it  differs  from   all  other 
actigraphic system in the market. 
Historically,  the  first  objective  of  wrist  actigraphy 
analysis was to classify sleep and wake states. An epoch of 
pre  selected length (mostly 1 minute or 30 sec) is  classified 
as Wake or Sleep, usually on the base of a threshold value, 
looking for a procedure that  would provide parameters with 
good correlation to the PSG. The first set of parameters 
provided by the Motionware software (from “assumed sleep” 
to “mean wake bout” in Table I) are in that line of work. 
That evaluation is helpful as long as the time when sleep is 
expected (for the Motionware software the interval between 
the marks Light off and Got up) is well defined by external 
inputs [2]. 
The  second  attempt  was  to  evaluate  activity  and 
immobility  (in  the  case  of  Motionware  software,  the 
parameters from “Immobile mins” down, in Table I), using 
procedures more tied to the objective description of the data 
recorded. Traditionally, the data is analysed as a table of a 
dependent variable (activity Counts) and an independent one 
(time) with fitting methods like Cosinor [30]. That approach 
is quite difficult when 80% of values are zeros and push to 
focus on the study of those zero values. Over the years, there 
were studies on zero values, also called “immobility” [31]. It 
is one area of studies that is getting new attention [32] and 
the higher granularity of one second epochs has already 
shown some potential [16]. POZ may become another useful 
parameter because it is easy to compute and needs a small 
amount of memory, allowing long recordings for monitoring 
purposes. It offered already at least one result pointing out 
the permanent circadian distribution of the percent of zero 
values, as shown in Figure 13 and Figure 14. 
However, the information provided by those analyses are 
always  the  same,  no  matter  past,  present  and  future 
computations and displays: we try to document and describe 
what a clinician would evaluate  simply looking at the raw 
data in the standard printout of a week long recording i.e., if 
the daily pattern is regular or not, that there is more activity 
during the day than during the night (or similar consideration 
related to the working life), if the night time is without major 
interruption  (Dr.  Gioacchino  Mennuni,  personal 
communication). That  description does not really needs a 
numerical evaluation, beside research studies.

In order to improve the situation, different approaches are 
needed. It is often overlooked the basic fact that any analysis 
method requires a model of the data we want to study. It is 
important  then  to underline  that  all  the  above  historical 
analysis  imply that any sample is considered equivalent to 
another, no matter when it is recorded, i.e., a movement of x 
Counts at noon has the same meaning of a movement of x 
Counts at midnight. And therefore making acceptable  to 
compare the values measured in the two body states.
Sleep has always  been  related  to the  idea of  “rest”, 
connecting  the  seen  “immobility”  during  sleep  to  the 
“immobility”  of  the  wakefulness.  After  centuries, 
Electroencephalography  (EEG)  demonstrated  the  mistake 
showing that the highest level of immobility “REM muscle 
atonia” is a quite active state of the body. Nevertheless, the 
idea of sleep as “rest during an ongoing activity”, is still 
entrenched  (about  someone  asleep,  we  still  say  “he  is 
resting”)  also  in  clinicians  and  researchers  work,  with 
methodologies that try to find something quantitatively less 
or more present instead of something qualitatively different. 
With  the  hypothesis  that  the  series  of  zeros,  not  the 
individual sample, are functionally similar we enter a new 
area of studies. The epoch recorded has a different meaning 
depending when it is recorded, in this case, inside or not a 
series of a defined length. 
The exploration of series and their dynamics is, as far as 
we know, a new area of research for actigraphy analysis. The 
series  analysis  demonstrates  that,  for  some  parameters, 
between wake and sleep there is not only a quantitative 
difference   “more  of  the  same  immobility”,  but  some 
qualitative one, with series that are possible only during  well 
defined time frames. 
We found that: 

the large part of an actigraphy recording is made 
out of short series;

data is skewed, with a larger range for zero series 
than for non zero series;

there   is  a  threshold  that  limits  the  possible 
interaction among series based on their length and 
that divides them in  “short” and “long” series;

long zero series may be divided in groups (like D1, 
D2, D3);

some of those groups are concentrated during the 
night with a circadian pattern constant over the 
year;

the longest series of zero values are allowed only 
during sleep (personal communication). 
The length of series seems not to be directly related to 
sleep stages and co-recording of polygraphic data is needed 
to explore that relationship. 
The analysis of series suggested the idea that the couples 
of series, not the single series, could be functionally similar. 
The similarity of the couple of series with a pulse,  opens the 
possibility to apply to the actigraphy data the large panoply 
of  analysis  already  attempted  for  other  “pulses”.  For 
instance, when labelling all non zero samples as “1”, we 
create a binary coding suitable for Symbolic Dynamics. It is 
then intriguing to see a possible common framework for the 
analysis of different signals of the activity of the autonomous 
nervous system.  
VI.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
For the first time, we make available one year of wrist 
actimetry in real life, stored at one seconds epochs. The raw 
data  described  in  this  article  are  freely  available  to 
researchers  on  the  National  Sleep  Research  Resource 
(NSRR) platform . 
Most of the activity values stored by the Motionwatch8 
are equal to zero. Examples of ways to study those zeros and 
to display them are introduced. 
The analysis of the published year is still limited:

the issue of the “second door” of sleep has not been 
discussed;

the search for a suitable approach to the study of 
actigraphy is still open and maybe this work will 
allow actigraphy to enter the network physiology 
field [33];

it is unexplored if the intensity of the movement 
and the light recorded by the MW8 may add useful 
information.
The recording of the actigraphy inside the research is 
today more than three years long and there is a large area for 
further developments, for instance:

all the issues related to the correlations with other 
biological signals are to be explored, starting from 
the difference between trunk and wrist actigraphy 
up to the correlations between actigraphy and PSG; 

of special cultural interest, at least for the author, 
would  be  to  bring  actigraphy,  electromyography 
and eyelid closure under the same theoretical motor 
control framework.
The research described in this article is still a ground 
breaking type of work that creates more questions  than 
providing  answers, but  new insights on possible analysis of 
actigraphic data are already obtained that stimulate to pursue 
the research. Hopefully, other researchers will look for new 
tools to analyse human motor activity and clarify the role of 
actigraphy in the personalised medicine.
