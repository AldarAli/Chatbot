Abstract—Sensor networks are envisioned to have the capability
to detect the presence of an event or target in a monitored
region. Sensors can collect measurements about the target and
make local decisions about the presence or absence of the target.
To reduce probability of false alarms, collaborative detection is
usually exploited, where the local decisions are fused to arrive at a
consensus about the target presence. In general, the performance
of a sensor network can be evaluated in terms of detection
probability and false alarm probability. This paper adopts the
Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) detector for sensors to make
local decisions. The distributions of the target signal and noise
are assumed unknown a priori. Simple and effective methods are
proposed to estimate the distributions of sensor measurements.
The AND and OR fusion methods are exploited in making the
ﬁnal decisions. Simulations are conducted to verify the analytic
results to the simulated results. The best selection of sensors to
participate the fusion in order to protect a particular location in
the monitored region is also shown by experiments. Essentially,
the paper analyzes the approximated detection probability and
false alarm probability based on the estimated distributions of
the unknown target signal and noise. Through simulations, it is
shown that those approximated results could be close to the true
values.

INTRODUCTION
The advances of technologies in sensor networks have
made it possible to improve the capability of human to monitor
a region of interest. One potential application of sensor net-
works is to detect the presence of abnormal events or targets in
the monitored region. For instance, sensor networks have been
used in battleﬁeld monitoring in order to detect unauthorized
intrusions[1], [2], or in wildﬁre detection to protect forests[3].
In such networks, sensors deployed in the monitored region
can sample the environment, exchange information with other
sensors, and make decisions about the presence or absence
of the events or targets. In many cases, the targets may be
dangerous or malicious. Consequently, to design effective and
reliable detection methods is an important issue for such
applications in sensor networks.
Many studies use data fusion to improve detection per-
formance in sensor networks[4], [5], [6], [7]. In most of the
studies, sensors are usually used to detect certain signals for
which the probabilistic distributions are assumed to be known.
However, in practice, the distributions of the target signal
and noise might not be known in advance. Furthermore, the
distributions could change from time to time caused by the
unpredictable and variant physical environment conditions.
This paper considers the problem of detecting a target with
unknown signal distribution in sensor networks. Basically, sen-
sors take samples of the target signal and measure the average
signal energy periodically. In each period, a local decision
about the presence or absence of the target is made by each
sensor using Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) detector. If
the measurements is greater than a carefully selected threshold,
it decides that a target is present. Otherwise, it decides that
no target is present. An appropriate threshold depends on
the distributions of the measurements in both cases when the
target is present and absent. A simple and effective method
is proposed to estimate the probabilistic distributions of the
target signal and the noise. Without complicated calculations,
approximate distributions of the measurements are estimated.
Moreover, data fusion is also used to further improve the
performance of the network. A consensus decision is arrived
at a fusion center periodically based on the local decisions
reported from sensors. Two fusion methods, namely AND-
fusion and OR-fusion, are investigated for data fusion in the
network. In particular, the global detection performance in
terms of detection probability subject to a ﬁxed false alarm
probability is derived analytically based on the estimated
distributions.
Simulations are conducted to verify the correctness of
the analytic derivations of the detection performance. The
comparisons show that the analytic results are very close to
the simulation results. The discrepancy between the analytic
results and simulation results is mainly caused by the approxi-
mations of the signal distributions. In addition, it can be found
that not all sensors need to participate in the fusion. In fact, the
detection performance may decrease as the number of sensors
increases in the fusion. However, if too few sensors in the
fusion, it is not beneﬁcial to target detection, either. The best
set of sensors to participate in the fusion for a certain target
location is also selected by simulations for both AND and OR
fusion. The selection can be the basis to generate an efﬁcient
and high-performance surveillance sensor network.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
reviews the related work. Section III addresses the detection
mechanism and the analytic derivations of the detection per-
formance. Section IV shows the simulation results. The paper
concludes in Section V.

RELATED WORK
Target detection using sensor networks has been exten-
sively studied in the literature. A variety of detection methods
have been proposed for target detection in sensor networks[8],

[9]. Some studies in the literature assume that the sensing range
of a sensor is a disc[10]. A sensor will report a positive deci-
sion if the target is present within its sensing range. However,
this model may not conform to real situations since it does not
capture the stochastic nature of sensing data. Detection errors
like false alarm and missing of target’s presence may occur
from time to time in real detection operations. Some other
studies use different probabilistic models to catch the uncertain
characteristics of detection operations in sensor networks[11],
[12]. In general, the detection probability is usually assumed
to be degraded with the distance from the target to the sensor.
Based on the assumption, in [11], the coverage of a location in
the monitored region is deﬁned as the probability that at least
one sensor detects the target if it is present at the monitored
location. A sensor deployment strategy is proposed to achieve
that the minimal coverage over the region is greater than a
threshold. In [12], the detection probability of a mobile target
is analytically evaluated when a group of sensors deployed in
the monitored region. A probabilistic detection model where
each sensor can have heterogeneous sensing area is developed.
In order to improve detection performance, data fusion
is usually used to reduce the probability of false alarm or
missing[4], [5], [6], [7]. In [4], the monitored region is divided
into a grid and two data fusion methods applying to the grid are
investigated. One uses data reported from an individual cell and
the other uses data from adjacent cells. The latter is shown to
be able to generate better performance for the coverage. In [5],
the lower and upper bounds of fusion threshold is analytically
derived to ensure that a higher detection probability and lower
false alarm probability can be obtained compared to those
derived from the weighted averages of individual sensors. In
[6], the paper investigates collaborative target detection based
on data fusion. The optimal detector, which is proven to be
uniformly most powerful, is derived. In [7] and [13], the
latency of detecting a target based on data fusion in sensor
networks is also analyzed. Detection latency is an important
issue for real time detection. Recently, there is also work on
the problem of target detection in mobile sensor networks [14],
[15]. All of the above studies use data fusion, but derives
the detection mechanism based on known signal or noise
distributions. Our work is different from those previous studies
in that the distributions of the target signal and noise are not
necessary to be known in advance, which could be much closer
to real situations.

DETECTION
A. Sensing Model
Suppose that a target at location r emits a signal St at
time t. The distribution of St is unknown, but the mean and
variance of St are easy to evaluate. Let µs and σ2
s denote the
mean and variance of St. Let Si
t be the signal sensed by sensor
i at location ri. The signal strength is assumed to be degraded
with distance. Thus, Si
t can be modeled as follows:
Si
t =
St
|r − ri|α ,
(1)
where |r − ri| is the Euclidean distance from the target to
sensor i and α is the decay factor. Note that since |r − ri|α is
a constant, the mean and variance of Si
t are given as follows:
µs,i = µs
di
and σ2
s,i = σ2
s
d2
i
,
(2)
where di = |r − ri|α. Usually, the signal sensed by a sensor
is corrupted by noise. Let Xi
t denote the noise signal at sensor
i, and is modeled as a random variable with mean µx,i and
variance σ2
x,i. Noise can follow a variety of distributions in
different environment conditions. In this paper, the distribution
of Xi
t is also assumed to be unknown. The ﬁnal signal sensed
by sensor i is yi
t = Si
t + Xi
t.
Generally, each sensor in the network measures the average
signal energy over a sampling period. The measurement of a
sensor can be expressed as
Mi = 1

where T is the number of samples in one period.
B. Approximation of Measurement Distributions
In each sampling period, each sensor would make a local
decision based on its measurements. Assume that the sampling
result at each time instant is independent. The distribution of
the measurement Mi can be approximated by Central Limit
Theorem (CLT). When the target is absent, the measurement
contains only noise, i.e.,
Mi = 1
T

(4)
Suppose Xi
t is an independent identically distributed (i.i.d.)
random variable. First, the distribution of Xi
t
2 is determined.
In order to apply CLT, the mean and variance of Xi
t
2 need
to be determined. It is easy to get E[|Xi
t|2] = µ2
x,i + σ2
x,i.
However, there is no closed form expression for the variance of
|Xi
t|2. To solve the problem, ”Delta Method”, which ﬁnds the
approximation of a function of a random variable is exploited.
Delta Method is described as follows.
Proposition 1: Let x be a random variable with mean µ
and variance σ2. The variance of a function f(x) can be
approximated by
V ar(f(x)) ≈ [f ′(µ)]2 × σ2.
Proof: The Taylor series expansion of a function f(·) at value
a is given by
f(x) = f(a) + f ′(a)(x − a) + f”(a)(x − a)2
2!
+ · · · .
Take the ﬁrst two terms as an approximation and let a = µ,
f(x) ≈ f(µ) + f ′(µ)(x − µ).
Take the variance of both sides, one can have
V ar(f(x)) ≈ [f ′(µ)]2 × V ar(x).
■
Let f(Xi
t) = Xi
t
2. From Proposition 1, the variance of Xi
t
2
can be approximated by 4µ2
x,iσ2
x,i. Using the approximation as
the variance and the mean of Xi
t
2 obtained previously, by CLT,
when T is large, Mi converges in distribution to a Gaussian
distribution N(µi,0, σ2
i,0), where
µi,0 = µ2
x,i + σ2
x,i and σ2
i,0 = 4µ2
x,iσ2
x,i/T.

Note that the mean µi,0 is accurate, but the variance σ2
i,0 is
approximated based on Proposition 1.
The approximated distribution of Mi when the target is
present can also be derived in a similar way. If the target is
present, sensor measurements are mixed by target signal and
noise as in (3), which can be rewritten as follows:
Mi = 1

Similar to the target absence case, using CLT and Proposition
1, the distributions of the ﬁrst two terms in (6) can be
approximated by the following two Gaussian distributions.

In contrast, the detection probability of the ﬁnal consensus is
the probability that all sensors report positive local decisions
when a target is present indeed, i.e.,
Pd =

(20)
Similarly, for the OR fusion, the fusion center decides that
a target is present if at least one sensor participating the fusion
reports a positive local decision. Otherwise, it decides that no
target is present. Therefore, the ﬁnal false alarm probability
and detection probability can be derived as in (21) and (22),
respectively.

SIMULATIONS
In the simulations, a sensor network is deployed in a 5000
meter × 5000 meter ﬁeld. There are 50 sensors deployed in
the ﬁeld randomly as shown in Figure 2. The target is assumed
to be at location (2000, 2500) if it is present. The signal of the
target is assumed to be a random variable with mean 50000
and variance 3. The signal decays with distance and the decay
factor is α = 2. Without loss of generality, a Gaussian random
process is used to generate the target signal. It is noted that
any other random process can be used without affecting the
correctness of the proposed method. The noise process at each
individual sensor is also assumed to be Gaussian with mean
between 1 to 3 and variance between 0 to 1.
The distribution of the measurement Mi is ﬁrst evaluated.
Sensor measurement Mi is the average of signal energy taken
during a sampling period as shown in (3). The mean and
variance of Mi when the target is absent are derived in (5)
and when the target is present in (13) and (14), respectively.
The mean in (5) and (13) are accurate, but the variance in (5)
and (14) are estimated by Proposition 1. However, since the
target signal and noise signal are assumed to be Gaussian, the
true variance of Mi can also be derived as follows. Let x be
a Gaussian random variable with mean µx and variance σ2
x.

y =

Taking the square of both sides of the equality, one can have
σ2

x.
Therefore,
V ar(x2) = V ar(σ2
xy2) + V ar(2µxx).
Note that y is a standard Gaussian random variable and y2
is a Chi-square random variable with one degree of freedom.
Thus, y2 has mean 1 and variance 2. Then,

Note that local false alarm probability for different sensors
can be different for a ﬁxed global false alarm probability.
For the sake of simplicity, local false alarm probability of
all the sensors are set to be identical. Given the false alarm
probability, the detection threshold ηi for each sensor can be
determined.
For the AND fusion shown in Figure 4, the analytic results
are pretty close to the simulated results. The discrepancy
between the simulated and analytic results primarily because
the approximations made by CLT and the evaluations of the
variance based on Delta method. In general, the system has
higher detection probability if it can tolerate higher false alarm
probability. In addition, when the number of samples T is
large, the detection probability is higher. This is because local
detection probability is higher if T is larger, and, thus, from
(20), the global detection probability would be higher.
Similar results can be found in the OR fusion shown in
Figure 5. Comparing the results of the AND fusion and OR
fusion, the detection probability is higher for the OR fusion
based on a ﬁxed global false alarm probability. Obviously, the
AND fusion requires all the sensors to report a positive detect
decision in order to arrive at a positive consensus, while the

Figure 5. The ROC curves of the OR fusion
OR fusion only requires at least one sensor reports a positive
decision. The performance of the AND fusion may be degraded
by the strict detection rule.
Figure 6 shows the number of sensors participating in
the fusion versus the global detection probability using AND
fusion. The sensors are ordered by signal to noise ratio, which
is deﬁned as the mean of the target signal over the mean of
noise signal, i.e., SNR = µs,i/µx,i. The sensors are added
to the fusion from the one with the highest SNR. In general,
the sensors are added to the fusion roughly in the order of
distance from the target location. From the result, it is obvious
to see that using all sensors in the fusion is not the best choice.
In fact, the detection probability decreases as the number of
sensors increases after using three sensors in the fusion. On the
other hand, if less than three sensors participate in the fusion,
the detection performance also decreases. Consequently, from
the simulations, the best choice for data fusion for the speciﬁed
target location shown in Figure 2 is to choose the three sensors
with the highest SNR. Similarly, for the other locations,
one can also ﬁnd the best sets of sensors to monitor the
corresponding locations. The results could generate an efﬁcient
and high-performance strategy for monitoring the region of
interest.

As shown in the ﬁgure, the system has highest detection
performance when the three sensors with the highest SNR
participates in the fusion. Either too many sensors or too
few sensors participating in the fusion are not beneﬁcial to
the detection performance. It is consistent with the results in
AND fusion. Although, in OR fusion, getting more sensors in
the fusion would not hurt the performance much, using fewer
sensors to monitor the region is always desired.

CONCLUSION
This paper investigates collaborative detection for a target
in sensor networks when the distributions of the target sig-
nal and noise are unknown. A simple method is proposed
to evaluate the approximations of the distributions of the
sensor measurements. Using the approximated distributions,
local detection decision thresholds can be derived for sensors
based on CFAR detection. The global consensus decisions are
made by the AND fusion and OR fusion rules. The detection
performance in terms of the detection probability subject to
a ﬁxed false alarm probability is derived. The performance
of both the fusion methods is veriﬁed by simulations. From
the results, the analytic results are very close to the simulated
results. In addition, the best set of sensors to participate in
the fusion for monitoring a particular target location is also
obtained by simulations. Selecting the best sets of sensors to
monitor potential target locations in the region of interest can
generate an efﬁcient and high-performance surveillance sensor
network.
This paper only investigates the AND and OR fusion rules.
From the results, the OR fusion out performs the AND fusion
in terms of detection probability subject to a ﬁxed false alarm
probability. However, these fusion methods may not be optimal
in certain circumstances. For the future work, developing better
fusion methods is worth to be explored.
