Abstract— Since the beginning of business information system 
(BIS) development, the problem of end-user involvement in the 
system  design and implementation has been discussed. For 
years, BISs for users have been changed into the systems 
constructed by end-users. The Web 2.0 technologies should 
strongly support this tendency. The paper aims to answer the 
question if end-users are involved and actively participate in 
BIS development processes. The paper covers results of the 
survey done in 270 companies in Poland. 
Keywords - innovation, user involvement, user participation, 
social networking, new media, end-user support  
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
User participation in the BIS development seems to be 
considered as essential for the business success and 
economic benefits of business organization. However, the 
placement of end-users in the information system 
development 
process 
is 
constantly 
problematic 
and 
changeable. Barki and Hartwick [5] proposed a distinction 
between user involvement and user participation. They 
define user participation as the assignments, activities and 
behaviours that users and their representatives perform 
during the system development process. User involvement 
refers to the subjective psychological state reflecting the 
importance and personal relevance that a user attaches to a 
given system  [5]. User participation is defined as the degree 
to which the user is involved in producing and delivering the 
service. 
This research on end-user participation has focused on 
how to engage users to increase productivity in the BIS 
delivering context without failures. The purpose of this 
research is to collect IT staff opinions on end-user behaviour  
to fulfil the gap in the literature on user role in BIS 
development. Furthermore, the theoretical framework linking 
BIS development to social networking and new media 
application is also analysed and some empirical findings are 
given.  
Generally, BIS user involvement can take different 
forms, e.g.,:  
 
Customer 
participation 
in 
the 
new 
service 
development process directly [11].  
 
Co-operation of technology providers and users on 
exploration of the technology in a specific industry 
[3]. 
 
Partnership i.e., a formal relationship between the 
customers and the company [6]. 
 
Prosumption, i.e., the dual role played by the 
customer as a BIS provider as well as a customer 
[12]. 
Users involved in BIS development are grouped into the 
three classes: lead users, normal users and community users 
[15]. Lead users are defined as members having two 
characteristics. First, they anticipate obtaining relatively high 
benefits from the developed information technology (IT) 
solution according to their needs. Second, they are at the 
leading edge of important trends in a market place under 
study. Although normal users' involvement might help 
provide innovative ideas, their limited understanding of new 
technologies could threaten the executability of the ideas, 
therefore there is a need to carefully select normal users for 
further co-development of IT products. Community users 
seem to have expertise in a specific field. They are willing to 
spend 
more 
time 
online 
on 
innovations. 
Business 
organizations are now exploring ways to provide a platform 
(i.e., Websites) through which users can generate and 
contribute content, resulting in a cooperative experience 
between users and organizations. 
 For the purpose of this research two groups of users are 
considered i.e., normal users and community users. The 
research question guiding the paper concerns the factors 
influencing user involvement in the BIS development. The 
paper consists of three parts. At first, theoretical frameworks 
of user involvement are discussed. The next part covers 
presentation of research methodology and results. The last 
part includes findings and conclusion.  
II. 
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS OF USER INVOLVEMENT 
IN INFORMATION SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT  
The critical role of end-user in the manufacturing or 
research and development process encourages the companies 
to invite users to the value adding processes as partners.  
Companies should focus on employees' creativity as the 
essence of innovation and growth. Workers ought to be 
adaptable and interested in new knowledge and skills 
acquiring. Lately, new modes of innovation have been 
introduced and they require openness, i.e.,  an ability for 
firms to access and integrate others' ideas in their own 
practice. "Others" can mean other firms, non-profit units, 
universities and also other actors - users, consumers, 
amateurs, volunteers, who are influencing the demand for 
innovation [9].   
Firms are conscious that they are able to turn their 
intangible 
assets 
into 
value. Beyond 
research and 
142

development (R&D), patents, software, the intangible assets 
covering human resources and new organizational structures 
are the drivers of firm's growth. In Europe, the current 
downturn will be to depress investments in innovation and 
increase investments in the innovation infrastructure that 
extends beyond R&D to cover human capital, IT and 
entrepreneurship for sustainable development.  The crisis can 
be an opportunity for business to consider new policy 
instruments, which have not yet been implemented at a 
substantial scale. Since innovation is closely linked to the 
demand from users, business organizations can promote 
innovations by being a recipient of end-user creativity results 
and by signalling an acceptance of new inventions provided 
by end-users. While more work is needed to ensure that such 
mechanisms do not distort competition or deliver suboptimal 
performance, such "pull from the customers" mechanisms 
can 
provide 
incentives 
for 
the 
development 
and 
commercialisation of technologies closer to the market - an 
important complement to traditional innovation policies that 
have primarily "push" strategy including pushing the 
technologies to the business.  
The IT innovations can start in different parts of a 
business organization. They can be initiated: 
 
From technology: new technology or better use of 
existing technologies make it possible to change 
work practices. 
 
From information: intention to use different 
information or to provide information in a different 
form or level of detail leads to innovative use of 
existing or new technology. 
 
From participants: providing training on technology 
in a work system leads to new possibilities for 
doing work differently. 
 
From work practices: change the business processes 
to enable use technology more effectively for better 
results. 
 
From products and services: improvement of a work 
system's products and services by incorporating 
digitized information or even new hardware enables 
providing additional value for customers  [2].  
Innovations are always realized in a certain business 
organization context, where the real value of invention can 
be estimated. Organizational context is determined by the 
organizational culture, which includes the shared values, the 
beliefs, the history, the intellectual and operational traditions, 
the rules of conduct, and the business organization's general 
philosophy of operation. Business organization should be 
strongly engaged in the preparation of workers to develop 
and implement innovations.   
Creating an atmosphere of innovations permits users to 
behave as innovators. Sometimes user-led innovation 
involves a community, which creates and exploits innovative 
solutions on a continuing basis. Good examples of this 
include the Linux community around computer operating 
systems or the Apache server community around Web server 
development applications, where communities have grown 
up and the resulting range of applications is constantly 
growing. A growing range of Internet-based applications 
make use of communities - for example Mozilla Firefox. 
Social networking and crowd-sourcing approach support co-
creating the innovations and new ways of creating and 
working with such communities need to be developed. In 
innovation communities, an increasingly significant strategy 
of prosumption has been implemented, which demands 
seeing users as active players in that process. Their ideas and 
insights can provide the starting point for every new 
direction and create new markets, products and services. The 
problem is how to find ways of identifying and working with 
such community users. For example, Microsoft maintains a 
group of  so called Microsoft buddies who work as Web 
masters, programmers, and software vendors [15]. High 
technology firms have recognized the importance of linkages 
and connections - getting close to users to understand their 
needs, working with suppliers to deliver innovative 
solutions, linking up with collaborators, research centres, 
even competitors to build and operate innovative systems.  
There are many advantages of pushing the social networking  
into innovation development process, i.e., collective 
efficiency, collective learning, bringing new insights and 
supporting shared experimentation, collective risk taking, 
development of different relationships to build across firms' 
frontiers [14].  
Baldwin et al. reports that users do not anticipate selling 
goods or services based on their innovations, although they 
may later go into business as users-manufacturers [4]. Users-
innovators are motivated to design new IT products and 
services, because they believe that new designs can enhance 
the things they do and in the way, which is the most 
appropriate for them. Prior to the advances in IT (e.g. online 
communities, wikis, user-generated content websites) users 
were bound by physical limitations for their social 
environments. Content in a digital form allows users to 
modify, share, use and reuse information, regardless of the 
creators' original purpose [7].  Websites such as Twitter, 
Facebook, MetaCafe, Wikipedia, Flickr have all been 
introduced within the last decade and rapidly grow in user 
membership. Organizations are beginning to invest in 
development of social media, to capitalize on a growing user  
population that is interested in creating, retrieving and 
exploring the Websites. Lindermann et al. have noticed that 
using 
Web 
2.0 
applications 
within 
SMEs 
implies 
consequently 
breaking 
down 
innovation 
process 
to 
employees level [10]. In daily business practice, Web 2.0 
(e.g., wikis and blogs) has been observed as primarily being 
restricted to communication with the user and internal 
information and knowledge management.  
Social network services enable people to connect online 
based on shared interests, hobbies or causes. Social 
networking inside an enterprise is valuable when the 
organization rewards individual effort but needs to 
encourage knowledge sharing and connection with others- 
across geographical or functional boundaries [8]. Social 
networking permits a social presence online that is the 
degree to which a medium allows the user to feel socially 
present in a situation that is mediated via technology [13]. 
Aggarwal argues that social networks provide rich content-
based knowledge, which can be exploited for data mining 
143

purposes [1]. Schuster et al. add that social networking offers 
users autonomy in a unique way. Users can be independent 
from computer scientists, engineers and web designers to 
have a presence on the Internet. Sometimes, people 
overvalue the Internet information and hence integrate the 
pieces of information into their decision making process 
[17]. On the other side, people carefully select information 
provided on social network platforms.  Currently social 
network sites are adopted in organizations for recruiting, 
advertising and internal collaboration [16].  
III. 
SURVEY METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS 
The literature studies create very optimistic view on user 
involvement in BIS development. Particularly, proponents of 
Web 2.0 strongly support the thesis that users are involved 
and participate or create the BIS by themselves and for 
themselves. This very optimistic view should be verified, 
therefore that empirical research was done in 2011 in Polish 
micro, SMEs and big companies. The research covered 
interviews with information technology (IT) personnel (i.e., 
CIOs) responsible for contact with end-users. The 
respondents were gathered from 270 firms. Characteristics of 
surveyed firms are presented in Table I.  
Involvement of the end users in IT projects covering IS 
development is presented in Table II. The following 
activities of users have been specified: goal specification and 
project concepts (GSPC), business logic analysis and 
business process modelling (BLA BPM), requirements 
engineering (RE), information system design (ISD), 
information system implementation (ISI), information 
system testing (IST), information system installation and 
migration to a new IT environment (ISE),  information 
system maintenance (ISM), security of information system 
(SIS), information system usage (ISU).

In the Table II six different profiles of users has been 
included. Passive users and users-evaluators are oriented 
towards the observation and acceptance of other people 
efforts. Co-creator supports IT staff in business information 
system development works. User as the partner plays equally 
important role as IT professional in the system development 
process. User as the producer is self-dependent and has got 
sufficient competencies to utilize IT independently of the IT 
staff help. The last, i.e., prosumers are able to utilize IT by 
themselves and for their work purposes. In this paper the 
definition of prosumption was adapted from the work of Xie 
et al. [18].

Taking into account the results included in Table II you 
can notice that users are rather inactive. CIOs evaluate users 
as inactive at business analysis and business process 
modelling stages as well as at requirements engineering,  
system design and implementation. IT people do not demand 
the technical expertise from users, they should be helpful at 
the 
initial 
stages 
of 
business 
information 
system 
development process. Users were evaluated as co-creator in 
project concepts specification, information system testing  
and maintenance. Security of IS is the domain of IT 
professionals, and of course the strong activity of users is 
revealed at the business information system exploitation 
stage.  
IV. 
USER INVOLVEMENT EVALUATION    
Further analyses were realized for each of 4 groups of 
companies separately. In micro and small companies end-
users are assumed to have direct, face-to-face (F2F) contact 
with IT staff, therefore they know more about requirements 
of each individual. In medium and big companies, the 
contact between the end-user and IT personnel is indirect 
and online, occasional, therefore the procedures of 
registration of user needs are implemented, and the end-user 
has no chance to be personally involved in the BIS 
development process.  
The first question concerns the expected benefits and 
potential impediments. At big companies, over 70% of 
respondents admit that the most important benefits of end- 
user involvement in BIS development process cover better 
understanding of end-user requirements (83.3%), reduction 
costs of research and development works (73.3%), 
opportunities for market offer differentiation (73.3%), and 
improvement of company image (over 70%). Similarly at 
medium companies, over 70% of respondents argue that the 
144

INFOCOMP 2012 : The Second International Conference on Advanced Communications and Computation

most important benefits of end-user involvement in BIS 
development process comprise better understanding of end- 
user 
requirements 
(80.5%), 
development 
of 
strong 
relationships with user (80.5%), reduction of the cost of 
knowledge acquisition (75.6%) and improvement of 
company image (75.6%).  
At small companies,  the most important benefits of end- 
user involvement in BIS development include: supporting 
user education (72.2), better understanding of user 
requirements (72.2), taking better market position (67.1%). 
At micro companies, the most important benefits of end-
user involvement in BIS development cover: better 
understanding of the user requirements (over 83%), moving 
to the better market position (over 71%), and improvement 
of company image (70%).  
The 
most 
important 
impediments 
of 
end-user 
involvement in BIS development process comprise: 
 
At micro companies, end-user lack of knowledge 
and skills (73% of all respondents mention that), 
inevitability to learn new technologies (66%), lack 
of incentives and encouragement from the BIS 
producer (65%),.  
 
At small companies, necessity to learn new 
technologies (72% of all respondents state it), end-
user lack of knowledge and skills (71% ), and end-
user lack of incentives provided by BIS producers 
(62%). 
 
At medium companies, end-user lack of knowledge 
and skills (according to 80% of respondents), the 
end-user necessity to learn new technologies 
(68%), and  threat of theft of end-user ideas (61%).  
 
At big companies, necessity to know new 
technologies (80%), end-user lack of knowledge 
and skills (73%), and lack of incentives provided 
by BIS producers (57%).  
The next question in this survey concerns methods of 
activation of end-user to encourage them to the cooperation 
for BIS development.  So, in the survey the following 
methods have been identified: 
 
At big companies, participation of end-user in 
training courses and workshops  (90% of 
respondents emphasize that), constant discussions 
of IT personnel with end-users (86.7%) and 
participation of end-user in reviewing processes 
covering interfaces reviews and use case analyses 
(77%). 
 
At medium companies, participation of end-users 
in BIS testing (indicated by 90% of respondents), 
constant discussions of IT staff with end-users 
(85%), and participation of end-users in quality 
management team work (76%).  
 
At small companies, participation of end-users in 
training 
courses 
and 
workshops 
(75% 
of 
respondents answered that), constant discussions of 
IT personnel with end-users (72%), and occasional 
interviews and meetings with end-users (72%). 
 
At micro companies, interviews and meetings of IT 
staff with end-users (75%), participation of end-
users 
in 
courses 
and 
workshops 
(73%), 
participation of end-users in quality management 
team works (71% of respondents), and distribution 
of free and open source software (70%).  
None of the respondent groups emphasizes agile 
methods application for software development or for project 
management.  IT personnel and end-users are observed as 
conservatively minded persons. Similarly, the corporate 
architecture model discussions as well as IT product 
customisation opportunities have not be perceived as 
valuable for end-user encouragement. Beyond that, end-
users are not interested in control and evaluation of BIS 
administrator works.  
The fourth question concerns the knowledge from end-
users demanded by IT staff. For micro and small companies 
knowledge 
on 
personal 
computer 
construction 
and  
usabilities and end-user tasks are the most important 
characteristics, although for medium and big companies, 
knowing business processes is enhanced (Table III).

The next question focuses on end-user involvement in 
the works on BIS development. The IT staff considered 
separately end-users' involvement and engagement of online 
communities. In this research, the following activities have 
been analysed: basic research works, industry research 
works, development works, pilot implementations and 
product exploitations. Generally, the presence of end-users 
in BIS development process was accepted. However, the 
level of acceptance was different for different size 
companies:  
 
For 
big 
companies, 
end-users 
and 
online 
community were considered as required but not 
necessary for BIS development, and only in some 
cases the activities of community of users were 
treated as useless for high quality of BIS. 
 
At medium and small companies, involvement of 
end-users was perceived as demanded and 
necessary to ensure the high quality of BIS, 
however activities of online community were less 
145

important, and even in some cases, the involvement 
of end-users and community of users was 
considered as impediments for high quality of 
BISs. 
 
At micro companies, end-user involvement in BIS 
development works was accepted as necessary for 
high quality of IT products, but online communities 
were treated as neutral for BIS development.  
The sixth question concerns the usability of virtual 
communities as well as social media for BIS development. 
The controversial opinion results are presented in the Tables 
IV-VII. The IT staff representatives were asked if the virtual 
communities and new media are important for high quality 
of business information systems. Their opinions were 
distinguished as:  
 
Compulsory (C): the Internet solution is necessary 
to ensure a high quality of BIS. 
 
Required (R): the proposed solution seems to be 
required, but not so strong demanded as above.  
 
Neutral (N): the solution is indifferent to the BIS 
development and without impact on it. 
 
Useless (U): the Internet solution is superfluous for 
BIS development. 
 
Impediment (I): the solution is harmful and 
detrimental for the BIS development (i.e., design, 
implementation and exploitation).

Tables IV-VII include the percentage of positive 
responses in each of the 4 companies groups. The presented 
in Tables IV-VII  information reverse a theory concerning 
very positive acceptance and necessity to develop virtual 
communities and social media implementing for BIS 
development. Mostly, the new media solutions are treated as 
required and neutral, but they are not necessary.  
The IT staff is able to tolerate the mentioned in Tables 
IV-VII solutions i.e., newsletters, company staff blogs, 
users' blogs, Facebook and Twitter presence, IT product sale 
and exploitation portals, social networking and chat room, 
but they do not admit that the  mechanisms are valuable for 
BIS implementation and exploitation.

The last question asked for the survey concerned 
attitudes 
of 
end-users 
towards 
traditional 
solutions 
implemented for their support, i.e., Customer Relationship 
Management (CRM) systems, insourced and outsourced 
Help Desk, IT service anticipation systems and providing 
consultancy by CIOs. The end-user support mechanisms are 
accepted as required. For big and medium companies, the 
respondents have argued that only insourced Help Desk is 
necessary, the other solutions are required and neutral. At 
small companies, the IT service anticipation systems were 
mostly preferred. For micro companies, respondents have no 
special preferences.  
In this survey, social networking and IT service support 
mechanisms were presented from the IT staff point of view.  
They seem to be pragmatic and prefer traditional and verified 
solutions instead of strong acceptance of new media. They 
perceive new media as attractive but not necessary to support 
users and to involve them in BIS development.  
V. 
CONCLUSION 
Literature studies lead to the conclusion that business 
organizations are beginning to realize the potential benefits 
that can be captured when users and IT firms co-create 
values. Companies benefit from a large membership of users. 
They get benefits such as marketing insights, cost savings, 
brand awareness and idea generation. Users benefit from a 
positive experience that fulfils personal needs and interests. 
Experience is defined as an intensive individually involved 
event.  
In the survey done in 270 firms these theses were 
verifies. So, IT professionals have been observed as very 
sceptical about utilisation of new media and social 
networking, although in Internet several positive examples 
are registered. The research revealed important problems of 
lack of knowledge and skills of end-users as well as a lack of 
incentives necessary for their deeper involvement in BIS 
development. Therefore a huge social capital is unused.    
In the research, the quantitative methods are applied to 
reveal the influence of new media and social networking on 
information system development. The research does not 
provide an optimistic view to encourage for further 
development of new media and social networking.  But the 
social 
networking 
tools' 
providers 
should 
not 
be 
disappointed, in particular cases recognized through a 
qualitative approach  their tools can be recognized as well  
accepted.  The future research works will cover cloud 
computing tools  for end  user support.
