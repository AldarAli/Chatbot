Abstract— Texture analysis is one of the most important 
techniques that have been used in image processing for many 
purposes, 
including 
image 
classification. 
The 
texture 
determines the region of a given gray level image, and reflects 
its relevant information. Several methods of analysis have been 
invented and developed to deal with texture in recent years, 
and each one has its own method of extracting features from 
the texture. These methods can be divided into two main 
approaches: statistical methods and processing methods. Gray 
Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) is the most popular 
statistical method used to get features from the texture. In 
addition to GLCM, a number of equations of Haralick 
characteristics will be used to calculate values used as 
discriminate features among different images in this study. 
There are many parameters of GLCM that should be taken 
into consideration to increase the discrimination between 
images belonging to different classes.  In this study, we aim to 
evaluate GLCM parameters. For three decades now, GLCM is 
popular method used for texture analysis. Neural network 
which is one of supervised methods will also be used as a 
classifier. And finally, the database for this study will be 
images prepared from UMD (University of Maryland 
database).

INTRODUCTION 
Analysis of the texture in images aims at finding 
characteristics of textures and representing them in 
distinctive forms to enable further processing. Extracting 
features from the texture by algorithm is used for various 
types of images from different disciplines including: medical 
images, analysis of aerial and satellite images, and in Remote 
Sensing Images [1]-[5]. 
There are four main types of methods that have been 
used for extracting features from the texture, which are: 
texture classification, texture segmentation, texture synthesis 
and shape from texture [6]. Classification of images into one 
of the classes, which have been prepared in advance, is the 
main purpose of texture classification.  
Most methods used to analyse the texture may divide 
them into: statistical approaches and filtering based 
approaches. Statistical approaches such as Co-occurrence 
matrices and Local binary patterns [2][3][7][8] extract local 
features from the image depending on the spatial distribution 
of gray values in the particular image. Statistical methods 
can be categorized into: first-order (just one pixel), second-
order (couple of pixels) or higher-order (more than three 
pixels) statistics. Due to the complicated calculations and 
time involved when dealing with three or more pixels, 
higher-order is not commonly implemented. Filtering based 
approaches extract global features from the texture and 
examples of these are wavelet and Gabor filtering [9]-[12]. 
Filtering deals with the pattern of texture in the spatial 
frequency domain of the given image, which the energy 
distribution in the frequency domain identifies as a texture, 
and focuses on periodic patterns resulting in peaks in the 
spatial frequency domain.  
      In spatial texture analysis, the texture extraction 
methods analyse the spatial distribution of pixels in gray 
scale texture. Gray level co-occurrence matrix is a statistical 
method used to achieve second order statistical texture 
features. In addition, the texture features may be extracted 
from the GLCM by Haralick features, using several 
parameters which GLCM depends upon in its design. These 
features are: displacement value, orientation value, gray 
level range „quantization level‟, and window size [13]-[19].  
All of these features influence the accuracy of texture 
classification.  
      This section has been used to introduce the paper. The 
remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section II 
examines works related to the study. Section III describes 
the general concepts of GLCM methods and Haralick 
features. Section IV proposes the methodology of texture 
classification. In section V, we give the experimental results 
and at the end in Section VI is the conclusion.

RELATED WORKS 
       Many techniques that have been proposed for texture 
classification depend upon GLCM for analysing the image 
as the main stage in classification.   
      It was established that using second order statistics to 
extract texture features such as Angular Second Moment, 
Homogeneity, Contrast, Angular Second Moment, Energy 
and Entropy are suitable for classification of color and high 
resolution images of cities and farmland which are 
important sources of information for the geographical sector 
[8]. Another method was established by using GLCM after 
applying window size 7 × 7 on the original image of 
Guizhou karst mountainous region taken by remote sensing

by the use of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) process. 
The different characteristic values of GLCM were analysed 
from different directions of GLCM. This experiment 
concluded that by using SAR image, a texture can reflect 
important information of the different land entities [3].  
       We propose a new method for defining the direction in 
GLCM, which selects the main direction of the image by 
measuring the different directions. Characteristically, the 
value of the main direction in texture is calculated from an 
average of the three directions, where a set of characteristics 
which includes more information about the rotation 
invariance of the image are extracted [18]. On the contrary, 
using distinct displacements to classify any type of texture 
does not give good results, and the value of displacement 
between two pixels depends on Texel size. As a result, the 
new method tries to compute Texel size of texture [17].  
       The performance of GLCM was investigated on large 
database from breast lesions on ultrasound images for 
classification. The performance depends on a changing 
number of parameters such as quantization, orientations and 
distances [13]. Another investigation on GLCM involved 
testing a number of the parameters of GLCM on mapping 
sea ice patterns with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for 
assessing which one of them had the most effect on 
mapping sea ice texture [14]. 
III. 
GLCM ANALYSIS METHOD AND FEATURE FUNCTION  
      This section explains the GLCM method and the 
functional features of Haralick that are used to extract 
features from GLCM. 
A. GLCM  
Texture feature can be calculated by GLCM, which is 
one of the most popular statistical methods used for the 
analysis of texture. It creates a new matrix dependent on gray 
level values of the original image matrix. The number of 
rows and columns in the origin image is equal to the gray 
tones of new matrix. The GLCM method gives information 
about the type of texture in the image from the relationship 
between pairs of pixels. The values inside the new matrix 
take two parameters into consideration. These are: distance 
and angle. 
        The gray level intensity value of two pixels with a 
particular spatial relationship computes the distance of 
GLCM. Angles determine the direction of the relationship 
between two pixels of the same gray-level which can be 
horizontal; vertical or diagonal. 
 GLCM determines differences between surface textures 
through the collection of elements around a diagonal in the 
matrix for example, rough and smooth surfaces will be 
different and can easily be classified using GLCM [20]. 
 The dimensions of GLCM are calculated by the gray 
level of image. More levels give more accuracy in extracting 
the information from the texture, as the results increase the 
computation cost [14]. One of the most complicated issues 
with GLCM is texture size which is usually only estimated. 
B. Feature Function of Haralick 
Haralick texture features are a function for calculating 
values from GLCM [21]. They are used to discriminate 
between different textures in the classification of classes 
images to determine where they belong. Some of the 
Haralick texture features are more important than others and 
this is determined by surface texture where parameters such 
as second moment, contrast, entropy and correlation are 
mostly used. 
 
(1) Second Moment 
It evaluates the uniformity of an image and focuses on 
the partial characteristics of the image. 
 
 
where Ng is gray tone, i,j coordinate of function P(i,j). 
 
(2) Contrast 
      It indicates the range of dissimilarity between pairs of 
pixels over the whole image so it reveals the clarity of the 
image by extracting the edge information of the objects.  
 
 
 
 (3) Entropy 
      It is a measure of disorderliness of intensity distribution 
in the image. If there were no textures in the image, the 
entropy value would be near to zero, and on the other hand, 
a bigger entropy value indicates a more complex texture. 
 
 
 
 
 (4) Correlation 
It reflects a definite gray value along a certain direction 
of extended length. The correlation value will be larger if 
extended or if made longer. 
 
 
 
µx, µy and σx, σy are the means and standard deviations 
of px and py. 
IV. METHODOLOGY OF TEXTURE CLASSIFICATION  
Texture classification is relevant to computer vision.  The 
stages to be followed in classification will be as laid out in

the stages of classification will be as laid out in Figure 2. 
Firstly, there is the preparation of the images or databases 
that are needed for classification which are originally 
160*120 in size by dividing each original image into 
multiple windows of size (80*60 – 40*30 – 20*15). 
Secondly, we will implement GLCM using the different 
parameters, mentioned earlier on completed sizes of images 
and on specific window sizes. Thirdly, we will extract the 
features by Haralick, and use the average of features function 
when using multiple windows size for identifying sets of 
features that describe the visual texture of an image. Finally 
we will classify textures by their features using machine 
learning approaches such as Artificial Neural Network 
(ANN) [19].

back-propagation and training of ANN, where the neural 
Network is divided into two stages: 
1- Training stage: using the features vector which is 
extracted by Haralick functions, the MLP feed forward 
artificial neural network  
2- Testing stage: the MLP feed forward artificial neural 
network using other samples of data from the image, which 
are extracted as vector of important feature. The sampling in 
training is typically more than in training stage in ANN.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  
       The statistical GLCM are taken as texture features of a 
texture. Four of the most important statistical properties are 
calculated for describing image content: contrast, energy, 
entropy, correlation, and local stationary. The main 
objective of the experimental investigations was to compare 
the discriminatory power of GLCM as a method used for 
analyzing the texture as the main stage for classification, as 
well as the influence of GLCM parameters. It also divides 
the texture into multi-windows through extracting the 
features from the image. The classification accuracy rates on 
the database groups were compared using MATLAB 2014.

A. Data Preparation 
The data used in the paper are from a UMD dataset [22]. 
The UMD (University of Maryland, College Park) consists 
of 25 high resolution texture classes, each one with 40 
samples with resolution 1280*900 pixels (see Figure 3). 
Here, we divided the samples into four groups. Each group 
consists of another four groups: A, B, C and D. 
 
 
Figure 3. Samples of texture of UMD database 
B. Discussion and Analyses 
       We exploited the UMD database, by making a number 
of groups where each group consisted of two classes and 
each class contained 1000 texture of sizes 160 * 120 and 
each class was divided into 700 images for training and 300 
images for testing. The results of the texture classification 
were as follows: 
 
         The changing in direction parameter of GLCM gives 
different results if applied on whole images or using 
multiple sizes of window. The results in Table I explain the 
influence of directions changing in GLCM on the 
classification accuracy in the number of image groups with 
resolution 160*120, after dividing these images to the 
number of regions by different window size.  
       In general, the GLCM has given somewhat good results 
in some groups especially in groups: 1-B, 1-D, 2-D, 3-B, 3-
C, 3-D and 4-D that used different angels and different 
windows sizes. Conversely, it gave somewhat low results in 
classifying textures in groups: 1-C, 2-A, 3-A and 4-B. The 
result in rest of the groups: 1-A, 1-C, 2-C, 4-A and 4-C kept 
fluctuating. 
       There is an increase in classification accuracy through 
dividing the original images into sub-images, by sliding 
windows such as in most groups when the angle equal 45 in 
which include groups: 1-A, 2-A, 3-A and 4-C. When the 
angle equals 135, the increase was noted in groups 3-A and 
3-D, and the increase was in group 2-B when the angle was 
90. On the contrary, there is a decrease in other groups 
mostly when the angle equals 0 such as groups 2B, 3-C and 
2-D, and when the angle equals 135 in groups 2-A and 4-B. 
In other groups, there was no apparent change such as in 
groups 3-B with different angles, and in groups 2-C, 3-B 
and 4-D when the angle equals 135. The conclusion was that 
each image needed its own particular window size to obtain 
optimal information. 
The direction parameter had a big effect on GLCM. The 
average classification accuracy as shown in Figure 4 explains 
the following: when the parameter angle equals to zero we

obtain the best results between all texture classification 
groups and across all window sizes. Other angle values give 
different results depending on the texture types and window 
sizes used to divide the image. When the angle is equal to 
135, it gives better results with the origin image as well as 
when using window size 80*60, whereas the accuracy 
percentage decreased with window size 20*15. In contrast, 
the classification accuracy increased significantly when the 
angle is equal to 45 and window size 20*15. There are 
fluctuations in the accuracy when the angle is equal to 90 
through changing the window size from 160*120 to 20*15. 
In all results, the effect of angle parameter is clear on the 
classification accuracy between groups of textures. 
A change in the distance value in GLCM leads to a 
change in the result of GLCM. This can be seen in Table II, 
which gives results about classification accuracy of images 
depending on different values of the distance parameter of 
GLCM. This was done by applying GLCM on the origin 
image size 160*120 and later, by dividing them to 4 regions 
with window size 40*30 we found that: 
 
Accuracy of classifications in most groups has been 
affected by increase in distance in GLCM. For example there 
is a significant decrease in accuracy of origin image in 
groups 1-B, 2-C, 2-B, 3-D, and 4-D, whereas in window size 
40*30 the decrease in the accuracy was in groups: 2-A, 2-B, 
2-C, 3-B, 3-D and 4-C. In groups 1-A, 1-C, 1-D, 3-C and 4- 
C it is clear how distance caused the fluctuation of accuracy. 
It was noted that in the groups that have high accuracy such 
as 3-B, 1-D and 2-D, there was a slight decrease in accuracy.  
 
 
Figure 4. Average Classification Accuracy of Different Angle Values 
 
 
The distance has an impact on the features which are 
extracted from the texture, so its influence is clear on 
classification of the accuracy of images. 
The impact of the displacement parameter of GLCM is 
clear in the average results of the accuracy on the images 
used in classification. In general, as show in Figure 5 there 
was a decrease in accuracy after increase in displacement 
value on classification of the original image, and after 
dividing it to sub-images by window size.

CONCLUSION  
       Extracting features from texture is considered an 
effective stage in image processing and is used in many 
tasks. In this study, it is applied for image classification.     
       GLCM is one of texture feature extraction methods used 
in many applications. Features sets which are calculated by 
GLCM depend on many parameters. In this paper, we tried 
to evaluate clearly the impact some of these parameters have 
on classification of well-known database, and how the 
influence of these parameters differs from one to another. 
Distance and direction are the most important parameters of 
GLCM. We noticed from the experimental results, that 
direction has more influence than the distance, whose effects 
are unclear on the classification of accuracy of images. The 
impact of these parameters varies between the image groups. 
This can be observed in the fact that the impact is different 
based on the type of images in the group and the size of 
window used to divide the image. As a result, it is essential 
to select appropriate parameter values carefully to increase 
classification accuracy of each type of textures for 
maximizing the discrimination between images that belong 
to different classes. In future work, we look forward to 
introducing studies about the influence of other parameters 
such as quantization and types of features extraction 
functions on GLCM and finding out which of them has the 
most influence on the accuracy of image classification.
