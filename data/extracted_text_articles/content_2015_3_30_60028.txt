Abstract—Explanation of museum exhibits must give useful 
and adequate information to museum visitors. However, good 
explanation costs a lot and is hard to be maintained by 
museum curators. This is the case with voice and/or video 
guidance, or smartphone applications. To cope with the issue, 
this paper proposes a novel personal support aid: Stamp-On 
Developers Toolkit (Stamp-On/DT) for visitors, developed by 
the visitors themselves. Stamp-On/DT consists of smart devices 
with explanation contents and 'stamp' devices attached to 
corresponding exhibits. The unique features of Stamp-On/DT 
are summarized as follows: (1) the digital contents of the 
corresponding explanation can be created by both visitors and 
curators, 
(2) 
the 
contents 
are 
easily 
described 
with 
conventional web tools such as HTML, CSS, or Java script, 
and (3) users are only required to save exhibited images in the 
same exhibited location with the same names. To validate the 
effectiveness of Stamp-On/DT system, we have conducted a 
workshop in a museum to let visitors create digital contents 
and then we have evaluated their performance.. From the 
workshop experiments, we conclude that Stamp-On/DT is an 
effective, easy and interesting aid in understanding museum 
exhibits. 
Keywords- tangible user interface; digital content; museum 
explanation 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
The purpose of museums is to collect, store, and educate 
people with different exhibits. In recent years, lifelong 
learning has become active and schools have created 
comprehensive classes. Therefore, demand for education in 
museums is increasing. With regard to the opportunity for 
visitors to learn about museum exhibitions, digital exhibition 
support systems and experiential exhibitions have increased. 
We have surveyed to identify the expectation of curators 
from museum visitors. The participants of the survey have 
indicated that they hope for visitors to have interests in the 
exhibits, to observe the exhibits more comprehensively, and 
to feel familiar with the exhibits. Because most visitors often 
enjoy video games, museum exhibition support systems are 
required to be both interesting and enjoyable for visitors so 
that they can engage in observing the exhibits. 
Based on such background, in this paper we propose a 
novel personal support aid: Stamp-On Developers Toolkit 
(Stamp-On/DT) for visitors, developed by the visitors 
themselves. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In 
Section II, we present a literature survey to highlight the 
current problems; In Section III, we describe the system 
configuration and functions of the proposed system; In 
Section IV, we explain the usage of Stamp-On/DT; In 
Sections V and VI, in order to validate the effectiveness of 
Stamp-On/DT, we carry out workshop experiments, then 
give the findings and discussions; Finally, Section VII 
concludes the paper.

LITERATURE REVIEW 
A. Study on Museum Exhibit Explanations 
There are many studies on digital explanations for 
museum exhibits aimed at people accustomed to interactive 
stimuli, such as video games [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]. 
Such digital explanations have the same structure as 
video games. If visitors stand in front of a given exhibit, the 
digital explanation starts. There are interactive elements to 
push buttons for more details, but in general, visitors watch 
the 
exhibit 
passively. 
Experts 
on 
exhibits 
system 
developments (system experts) are responsible for creating 
such digital content. Therefore, to fix and/or modify these 
digital contents, hard work from system experts is required.

B. Authoring Tool for Museum Exhibit Explanation 
Koleva et al. [9] developed an authoring tool that 
curators are able to use to connect 3D digital content and 
sounds for exhibits with a visual programming language. 
Even with this tool, however, system experts must prepare 
the 3D parts in advance. Roussou et al. [10] made a website 
to be used for museum learning, in which they use the 
pictures drawn by eleven years old children. In Roussou et 
al.’s study, they report that children made a paper prototype 
for the web contents. However, finally, a professional web 
designer created the actual website. Also they reported that 
the children’s pictures required much time to digitize. 
C. Digital Education Tools in Museums 
Many museums, including the British Museum and the 
Louvre, have a digital presence on the Internet. People can 
watch exhibits remotely [11][12]. On the other hand, Google 
created a virtual museum for access on the Web in 
cooperation with different museums, including the National 
Museum of Western Art [13]. In addition to the Web, 
museum–display-support applications such as ‘Tohaku Navi’ 
[14] and ‘e-Museum’ [15] are employed. People can confirm 
the availability of certain exhibitions before visiting a given 
museum. Okumoto et al. [16] described that watching 
images and exhibit commentary on the Web before attending 
a museum was more effective for visitors than using the 
museum exhibit support system without watching the online 
commentary prior to visiting the museum. However, it is 
difficult for all visitors to learn information about exhibits in 
advance from a museum website. Furthermore, Okumoto et 
al. indicated that visitors only watched museum exhibits 
briefly because visitors were preoccupied with awareness of 
digital content. 
D. Summary of the Survey and Research Statements  
Currently, experts are required to make digital exhibition 
support systems. If only experts create the content, there is a 
limitation in that modifying existing content or adding new 
content requires considerable time. Although digital 
exhibition commentary has a level of interactivity because 
visitors can press a button, visitors mostly watch the 
exhibition support system passively. There is also a 
limitation in that visitors observe digital content more closely 
than the actual exhibits. Therefore, we believe that museum 
support systems require a mechanism that can help visitors 
interact more actively with museum exhibits. 
From the literature survey, in an exhibition support 
system, the roles of visitors are considered very low. 
However, we believe digital contents should be generated by 
visitors themselves. It can be attained if the contents are 
easily developed and modified. Furthermore, if visitors are 
familiar with interactive video games, they are able to enjoy 
such digital contents interactively.  In this paper, we would 
like to validate such visitor behaviors. 
III. 
SYSTEM CONFIGURATION AND FUNCTIONS 
OF STAMP-ON/DT 
Stamp-ON/DT system is an extension of Stamp-On 
exhibition support tool [16].  The system configuration and 
functions are, thus, almost the same we have already 
reported.  Based on the previous paper, we explain the 
outline. 
A. Hardware 
The Stamp-On/DT system hardware is composed of a 
Nexus 7 tablet, stamp, scanner, special paper, and stationary 
(Figure. 1). 
 
 
 
Figure 1.  Stamp-On/DT system hardware. 
1) 
Nexus 7 tablet: We need Chrome browser equipped 
on Nexus 7 tablet: Chrome.  However, devices which satisfy 
the following conditions also run Stamp-On/DT systems: 
a) Device with a multi-touch screen, which is used to 
detect four or more point coordinates. 
b) Browser with JavaScript-compatible software. 
 
2) 
The stamp: Aluminium tape is pasted on a stamp 
from the bottom of the stamp to the side of the stamp. The 
stamp has dot patterns on the bottom (Figure 2), on which 
the stamp has four convex points. When visitors press the 
Nexus 7 tablet with the stamp, the tablet reads the dot 
patterns of the bottom. Each of the  stamp pattern identifies 
the corresponding information attached on the pattern. The 
42

corresponding digital contents will change through this 
pattern (Figure. 3). 
 
 
 
Figure 2.  Stamp interface. 
 
 
Figure 3.  Mechanism to switch digital content. 
 
3) 
PC and Scanner: A PC and a scanner are required in 
order to digitize the paper on which visitors write some 
information on the exhibited items in the form of a single  
quiz. After the sheet with the quiz is scanned and converted 
to an image file (jpg format), a support staff will cut 
unnecessary portions using an image processing software 
then save the file. 
4) 
Display design sheets and stationeries: To convert  
digital data, the sheet pre-prints i) a frame in the same screen 
ratio as the Nexus 7 screen and ii) an area to press the stamp 
(Figure. 3). Stationeries are used by visitors to write the text 
and / or to draw the picture to be used. 
B. Software 
The software used for the proposed system is written in 
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The image file URLs are 
written in the HTML source file in advance. A new image 
file is displayed when the image file in the image folder is 
overwritten. First, visitors bring their paper with the exhibit 
quiz and commentary to museum staff. Second, the staff 
overwrites the image file in the specified folder by scanning 
with the scanner and PC. Finally, the digital content is 
completed when the staff copies the folder to the Nexus 7 
tablet. (If the PC and the Nexus 7 are connected to a web 
server, the folder is only required to be uploaded.)

IV. 
USAGE OF STAMP-ON/DT SYSTEM  
Visitors who would like to use Stamp-On/DT are 
required to perform the following two tasks:  
1) 
To create digital contents (Figure. 5). 
2) 
To play with the digital contents (Figure. 6). 
 
A. Task of the Content Creation Phase 
At the first task, visitors are required to follow the steps: 
1) 
Make a quiz regarding a given museum exhibit. 
2) 
Learn about the exhibit while taking notes. 
3) 
Write a quiz related to the exhibition on the sheet 
with   texts and/or illustrations. 
4) 
Scan the sheet then put them into the PC. 
5.) 
Put image files to HTML pages. 
6.) 
Transfer the image files and HTML files to Nexus7. 
B. Task of the Playing Phase 
At the second task, visitors are required to follow the 
steps: 
1) 
Place a stamp in front of the museum exhibits. 
2) 
Display the question on the screen of Nexus7. 
3) 
Look for the answer stamp in front of the exhibits. 
4) 
Put the stamp on screen of Nexus7 tablet. 
5) 
Display corresponding contents according to the 
patterns of the stamp. 
6) 
Display a correct or wrong image. If visitors choose 
a wrong answer, Nexus 7 displays  'try again'. If visitors 
choose a correct answer, Nexus7 displays the commentary 
image which visitors drew.

V. 
EXPERIMENT OF STAMP-ON/DT SYSTEM 
A. Design of WorkShop 
To evaluate the effectiveness of Stamp-ON/DT, we have 
organized a workshop in a museum where visitors were able 
to observe and enjoy the exhibits actively. Visitors to the 
workshop were instructed to create digital content to explain 
the museum exhibits. 
When visitors create digital contents, we expect them to 
show the following behavior: 
• 
Visitors will watch the exhibit more carefully than 
usual. 
• 
Because visitors are required to create a sheet that 
explains the exhibit, they need to arrange exhibit information 
in a header and collect it. Therefore, visitors will understand 
the exhibit more comprehensively than usual. 
  
B. Experimental Environment 
We conducted an experiment to evaluate our system at 
the Printing Museum in Tokyo, on Saturday, September 27, 
2014. The participants were nine female college students, 
and none of the participants had seen the exhibits previously. 
Three days before the experiment, we trained two 
students for thirty minutes to assist with the activities of the 
participants to support digitizing, resizing, and saving the 
information collected during the experiments. Consequently, 
on the day of the experiment, the participants had no trouble 
because of the help provided by the student staff members. 
Before the experimental workshop, all participants 
expressed an interest in printing and enjoyed drawing 
pictures. We divided the students into two groups (four and 
five people in each group), and the groups were labeled as 
Group A and Group B. 
For both groups, the required task was to create several 
quizes regarding the exhibition after observing their assigned 
exhibits (Figure. 7, Figure. 8). Each person was assigned one 
of two different exhibits randomly. 
After a pre-test, Group A started to create digital contents 
immediately. On the other hand, after the pre-test, Group B 
observed the exhibits as usual and required to answer a mid-
test. After the mid-test, Group B was required to start to 
create the corresponding digital contents. As indicated in 
Table 1, we gave the pre- and post-test to Group A as 
follows: 
• 
T1. pre-test: the participants answered the test 
without seeing the exhibits in the museum in 
advance. 
• 
T3. post-test: the participants answer the test after 
using the Stamp-On/DT system. 
 
As indicated in Table 6, to Group B, we gave pre-, mid- 
and post-tests as follows: 
• 
T1. pre-test: the participants answered the test 
without seeing the exhibits in the museum in 
advance.  
• 
T2. mid-test: the participants answered the test just 
after watching the exhibits as regular visitors.

C. The Objectives of the Evaluations 
We specified the evaluation items of the experiments as 
follows:  
1) How visitors learnt from the observations on 
exhibited items. 
45
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2015.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-392-6
CONTENT 2015 : The Seventh International Conference on Creative Content Technologies

• 
Evaluate the difference in the observations and the 
learning effects of pre- and post-tests with Groups A 
and B between (T1) and (T3).  
• 
Evaluate the difference in the observations and the 
learning effects of pre-, mid-, and post-tests with 
Grope B among  (T1), (T2), and (T3).  
2) How visitors enjoyed the experiences:  
• 
Evaluate how the visitors enjoyed the proposed 
systems through the questionnaire analyses.  
• 
Let visitors specify the enjoyable points of the 
proposed system through questionnaire analyses.  
D. Evaluation Methods 
We use the following methods to carry out the 
evaluation:  
1) Questionnaire Analysis 
a) Viewing exhibits and learning effects: Multiple-
choice and fill-in-the-blank questions were provided in 
order to determine how the participants learned from the 
exhibits. Group A answered two questionnaires, before and 
after 
the 
experiment. 
Group 
B 
answered 
three 
questionnaires: before, during, and after the experiment. 
For the post-test questionnaire, the participants answered 
five questions (Q1 to Q5) with five-grade relative estimation. 
Q1 and Q2 are related to viewing the exhibits, and Q3, 
Q4, and Q5 are related to the enjoyability: 
Q1. Did you observe the exhibit carefully? 
Q2. After the experiment, did you become more careful 
in observing the general printed information familiar with 
you and your neighbours?  
Q3. Was it interesting for you to make your own 
descriptions of the exhibited items? 
Q4. Was it interesting for you to use the stamp interface? 
Q5. Do you like to participate in another similar event, if 
we would provide the Stamp-On/DT system?  
E. Interview 
After the questionnaire sessions, we have made oral 
interview sessions against randomly selected participants. 
1) About viewing the exhibits: The interview consisted 
of the following questions: “Did you carefully observe the 
exhibits?’, ‘What were different points between your usual 
museum visits and  this experimental observations on the 
museum exhibits?’, ‘What were different points between 
usual explanations of the exhibits and the digital contents 
you made?’ 
2) About enjoyment: The interview questions were as 
follows: ‘Was it interesting for you to play with Stamp-On?’, 
and ‘Was it fun to make your own digital contents?’ 
VI. 
FINDINGS OF THE EXPERIMENT 
A. Discussion of the Experiments 
1) 
Questionnaire Survey Results. 
The answers to the questionnaire survey for Groups A 
and B are summarized in Table 2. Table 2 depicts 
experimental results about pre- and post-tests.  The sign 
testing method is applied.  The results suggest that there are 
statistical differences with the 95% reliability. To Group B, 
we apply the Freedman Testing to pre-, mid-, and post-
testing. The results also suggest that there are statistical 
evidences (Table 3). 
Table 4 summarizes the response distributions. Most 
participants responded positively to all questions. We 
investigated the response trends after separating the 
responses obtained from the questionnaire surveys into two 
groups: positive responses, including ‘completely agree’ and 
‘agree’, and negative responses, including ‘somewhat 
disagree’ and ‘completely disagree’. Fisher’s exact tests 
(1×2) showed a statistical significance at 95% level for all 
items.

RESULT OF OBSERVATION AND ENJOYABILITY
 
B. Results of Interview Survey 
1) About viewing the exhibits. 
• 
Participant A: I observed the exhibit carefully more 
than usual with the intention of preparing a quiz 
about it. 
• 
Participant B: Commentary must be written to be 
easy to understand because it will immediately 
become the corresponding digital contents and will 
be shown to other participants. I observed the exhibit 
seriously to try to understand it properly in order to 
clearly make the contents. 
2) Utterlance of  Enjoyable Aspects 
• 
Participant A: I was impressed at the fact that just 
after making the quiz, it quickly became the 
corresponding digital content. 
• 
Participant B: When I pressed the stamp, the 
immediate reactions the system made was quite 
interesting. 
• 
Participant B: It was interesting to see the digital 
contents the other participants developed, because 
the contents gave me different others’ perspectives 
on their focal points and explanations of the exhibits. 
 
C. Summary and Discussion of Experiment Findings 
Based on the questionnaire and interview results, the 
participants viewed exhibits more carefully with the 
proposed system than usual visits. All participants suggested 
that (i) it was pleasant to partake of the interview of the 
experiment, (ii) creating the digital content is much more 
interesting than making usual paper contents.  
The experimental results have revealed that museum 
visitors would observe exhibits more carefully than usual 
visits, if the visitors could create quizzes about the exhibits. 
Furthermore, all participants have interests in the beautiful 
printing techniques, which curators of the museum usually 
use to make explanations of the exhibited items. Therefore, 
the participants have more interests in the various printings 
among them in the sense of color, styles, and materials. 
 
 
When the nine participants used the Stamp-On/DT 
system at the same time, it was possible for them to produce 
18 items of digital contents within 2 hours. These results 
have shown the superiority of the proposed system against  
prior digital contents research in the literature [10] on the 
points of the agility and non-professional support to produce 
the digital contents. 
 
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE CHALLENGES 
This paper has described the design principles, functions, 
components, usages, and experiments on Stamp-On/DT 
system, which is a new extension of our Stamp-On [16]. 
Stamp-On/DT is a toolkit to let museum visitors develop 
digital contents. The unique features of Stamp-On/DT are 
summarized as follows: (1) the digital contents of the 
corresponding explanation can be created by both visitors 
and curators, (2) the contents are easily described with 
conventional web tools such as HTML, CSS or Java script, 
and (3) users are only required to save exhibited images in 
the same exhibited location with the same names. To 
validate the effectiveness of Stamp-On/DT system, we have 
conducted a workshop in a museum to let visitors create 
digital contents and to have their performance evaluated. 
From the workshop experiments, we conclude that Stamp-
On/DT is an effective, easy and interesting aid in 
understanding museum exhibits. 
From the experimental workshop, we have suggested that 
i) Stamp-On/DT system is successful to create digital 
contents in a short time without professional assistances; ii) 
the participants observed museum exhibits more carefully 
than usual, and iii) the learning effects on the exhibits 
observation was also attained.  
The proposed system will be further enhanced so that 
more kinds of tablet devices other than a Nexus 7 can be 
used in the proposed system. Also, we will prepare manuals 
and videos, and improve the stamp shapes so that even naïve 
users can use the stamps. 
The other future work includes 1) the improvement of 
stamp performance, 2) the introduction of the other kinds of 
hardware devices to assist the usage, and 3) the improvement 
of manufacture the stamp development.
