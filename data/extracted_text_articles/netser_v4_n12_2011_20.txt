Abstract!With the advent of low cost high powered computing,
cameras need not just be used to record multimedia data.
Cameras become sensors as we process waveforms of gait signals
from the video content of humans walking towards these cameras.
This sensory data allows cameras to be incorporated into
networks that monitor humans and their movements. This work
introduces a novel analysis of gait for human recognition which
uses and can be used for surveillance. Current approaches in
human gait analyses employ linear signal decomposition
techniques to obtain features such as frequency and phase. In
contrast, we establish the nonlinear nature of fronto-normal (FN)
gait. This motivates for the use of nonlinear analyses on FN gait
as a biometric and opens up new avenues for research in gait
recognition. Using these nonlinear analyses to derive features, we
show that by themselves they may not provide sufficient
discriminating ability. But by a novel combination of two
different nonlinear measures, one exploiting chaosity and another
representing regularity, this can be used to identify a person using
gait. We apply this in a multi-biometric experiment to
demonstrate its effectiveness.

I.  INTRODUCTION
Due to the current security climate, the presence of multimedia
devices such as low cost webcams and security cameras are
well nigh ubiquitous, whether in points of access or traffic. But
these cameras may not just be used to capture image and video
data as the information can be used to sense the environment
and be processed to produce sensory data. This is important as
cameras are being deployed in networks to so that multiple
views and interpretations of a scene can provide a more robust
analysis of the same. For example, the static images that come
from a camera can be used for face recognition which in effect,
senses the presence of a particular person. Considering the
video component of the data, it is  more than just a stream of
static images. They incorporate a temporal dimension which
can be used to derive time-based features such as frequency of
the movement of the limbs while walking which comprises  the
gait of a person. Effectively, this makes the camera a gait
sensor, which does not require attachment to a person. Gait or
the manner of walking of a person, is a biological feature - its
fundamental properties have been established in medical
studies. 
Recently, gait has been considered as a biometric which is
a registered biological trait, used in human identification. Gait
includes static features such as height, stride length and
silhouette bounding box lengths. Some dynamic features of
gait are frequency domain parameters like frequency and phase
of a walk. As a biometric, gait has desirable properties,
primarily because it is hard to disguise, as in normal
circumstances gait movement is involuntary. Furthermore, it
can be used at long distances, and it is non-intrusive and non-
invasive. In the literature, the main gait recognition approaches
analyze walking which proceeds in a plane parallel to a
camera, the so-called fronto-parallel (FP) view. This gives the
largest variation in a silhouette from which time series data is
obtained for analysis. From a far distance, this is advantageous.
However, being able to obtain these silhouette images from a
far distance require a clear, uncluttered  field of view.
As a contrast, a very common scenario is when people
queue up to access a facility. In a corridor like structure, we
assume that a subject is approaching a camera. In such
situations gait can be used as a supporting biometric because
as the subject draws nearer, other biometrics such as face or
iris can be used for robust recognition. Motion in this plane
which is perpendicular to the FP view, is the fronto-normal
view (FN) which is considered as a special case of FP gait.
Depending on the type of analysis need, in a FP walk, at least
two cycles or four steps are needed. For more robust
estimation of the period of walking, about 8 m is recommended
[1]. To capture this movement,  the camera distance required
is about 9 m [2]. This is because current video cameras
typically have a focal length and sensor size of 8 mm and 1/2"
respectively.  Practically, having such a wide uncluttered space
is difficult, since whenever we want to measure a person’s gait,
many people and objects will be present.
In a FN view, we can still use the 8 m. But this time, we
cover twelve steps and we only need a corridor-like structure,
the width being about that of a human body. Therefore, a
considerable amount of space is saved as shown in Figure 1 in
this case, by 2/9. Besides the considerable advantages in
savings of physical space and better viewpoint, Lee et al. have
put forth the advantages of the monocular FN non-silhouette
approach as [3]:

i)  Smaller physical space is needed.
ii) Multiple subjects can be tracked.
iii) Other biometrics can be easily combined.
iv) Wide variety of time analysis including non-periodic
motion analysis can be used.
This approach has its own unique challenges when fast and
reliable recognition is necessary. There are some recent
surveys on gait recognition such as that done by Lee et al. [4]
Most gait recognition approaches use a combination of static
and dynamic gait features. Dynamic features are usually linear,
like frequency of walking. Using time series parametric models
for gait recognition is fairly recent, for example by
Veeraghavan et al. in [5]. Lee et al. showed that chaotic
measures may be used to help identify people by their gait [6].
In another paper, they show that FN gait data is mainly
stationary [7]. Recently, they have also combined nonlinear
measures to provide a more robust gait recognition process [8].
With respect to that publication [8] this paper renders a more
complete treatment of the approach. 
Many analyses of gait data assume the property of linearity
without testing for it. Linearity refers to how the data may be
generated by the scaled linear sums of input signals.
Elaborating on this concept leads ultimately to convolution, a
linear operation much used in signal processing. In the main,
dynamic features of gait have been obtained by linearly
decomposing gait signals via the Fourier transform, which is
extensively used and has a good mathematical foundation.
However, most analyses do not check that the signal is linear
and stationary in nature. The gait signal is assumed to be
statistically stationary. However, most biological signals are
not so well specified, many studies showing that they are
nonlinear and nonstationary especially in the FN. Based on
biological evidence and using our FN gait dataset, Lee et al.
have shown that dynamic gait data is in fact nonlinear and thus
should be analyzed using nonlinear methods [9]. Applying
Fourier-based decomposition to nonlinear and nonstationary
signals produce mathematically correct functions, but these
may not have any physical meaning at all. These signal
constituents serve only to accommodate the lack of linearity
and stationarity. This limits the use of such analyses in
processing the signal. There are many methods to decompose
data so it can be expressed in terms of components that
combine in a linear way. For each of them, there are much
more ways to do so nonlinearly as described by Tong, which
gives rise to a rich source of features to be used in pattern
recognition [10]. In this paper, we look at two of the more
prominent methods of nonlinear analyses to derive features for
recognition. We combine these features to increase their
robustness for this task. The novelty of our approach lies in the
use and fusion of nonlinear features for the recognition task.
We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in an experiment.
In Section II, we look at the current state of temporal gait
analysis. Section III covers our setup and preliminary results, 
Section IV describes the theory behind using Chaos Theory
and the Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT) for analyzing FN
gait. Section V shows some results with preliminary analysis
and we conclude with Section VI.
A. Overview of temporal Gait Analysis
Psychophysical experiments using Moving Light Displays
(MLDs) attached to humans have shown the possibility of
using gait for identification purposes. Some time ago,
Johansson showed how the patterns traced by MLDs can be
perceived as that of people walking [11]. Cutting and
Kozlowski showed that identification was possible from MLDs
[12]. Recently, Troje has shown that the task of recognizing
gender from MLDs has a lower error rate using a frontal view
[13].
Gait as a biometric can be used at long distances, is non-
intrusive, non-invasive, and is hard to disguise. From the
medical literature (such as [1]), gait information is obtained via
sensors directly attached to the body. With image processing,
gait is derived from the 2D image projected on a camera
sensor. In this section, we provide a brief overview of human
recognition using gait with time-based features. Gait includes
static features such as height, stride length and silhouette
bounding box lengths. Some dynamic features of gait are
frequency domain parameters like frequency and phase of a
walk, which also includes the bounding box of the walking
silhouette. In the literature, the area of gait analysis and
recognition has involved medical analyses looking for exact
movement of body parts to detect pathological conditions.
Rather than standard  approaches  which  use  body silhouettes
as ably described  by Nixon et al., we  consider  the  motion 
of  individual  body  parts like hands and feet [14]. These
produce biologically based spatio-temporal signal features
which can be used as a biometric. 
Much of the current gait analyses use silhouettes in the  FP
view because of the large changes in shape and most of these
analyses assume that the signal derived from gait are linear and
stationary for the sake of simplicity. Linearity refers to how the
data may be described by the scaled, linear sums of input
signals. In what follows, we consider a signal, which can be
i
considered a set of time series data {x(t )} for i = 1..N sample
points. In general, we say s is in a linear signal space if :
(1)
where h(k) are constants and the inputs x(t) may be generated

by  functions f(t). That is, the data may be generated by the
scaled, linear sums of input signals. The equation is cast as a
convolution which is a common linear operation.
Stationarity entails having the statistical properties of the
signal up to the second order to be constant in time. That is,
p
                        where k  is a constant, E[@] is the statistical
expectation operator and p is the order. Usually the first order
statistic is the mean, and the second order statistic the variance
but sometimes the autocovariance or autocorrelation function
of the signal. These measures have been used to analyze gait
by decomposing the signal into its constituents. A common
linear example, which has been well developed is the Fourier
expansion, where the f(t)’s are sinusoidal functions. Current
approaches have used this successfully because the FP view of
gait is particularly amenable to linear analysis in contrast to the
FN gait, as shown by Lee et al. [8] This motivates a search for
nonlinearity and nonstationarity in descriptions of data which
can be used as biometrics. In this work, they show that FN gait
can be characterised by nonlinear measures. A variety of time
series analyses from the fields of econometrics and physics
may be employed to further characterize the gait. In contrast,
FP gait yields mainly periodic measures.
Ibrahim et al. have used Empirical Mode Decompostion
(EMD) (described in Section III.C) to detect the type of gait of
a subject using a 3D accelerometer using the energy of its
Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) [15]. From the same research
group, Wang et al. have looked into various features based on
IMFs and the features associated with Hilbert spectra for
clinical gait analysis [16].
Kuchi et al. have used EMD for gait recognition. But we
note that they use motion capture equipment, where the
coordinates of markers attached to the body are computed in-
camera at data rates of 120 samples/s [17]. Thus, the cameras
are not designed to give video information. They analyze the
signal for one walk cycle and for one marker, giving
encouraging results. However, they do not analyze their data
to provide justification for using nonlinear, nonstationary
analyses. We also feel that extending the results to ordinary
video cameras that can be used in security checkpoints is
difficult.
II.  EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
We used a commercial video camera with a capture rate of
25 frames/s at 720 by 480 resolution. In gait recognition from
video, we use feature points that have more motion in the
camera plane. This would be the hands, feet, and knees for a
FP walk. For a FN walk this is also true, although the motions
are smaller in magnitude. For the two kinds of walk, we show
the coloured marker set up in Figure 2. The marker
designations are: lh/rh - left/right hand: lf/rf - left/right foot and
lk/rk - left/right knee. Two additional discs of the same colour
are attached at the waist and face level which are used for
distance normalization. They are: tm/bm, the top/bottom
markers. The markers are tracked using the CAMSHIFT
algorithm [18]. We take video clips of twelve subjects and a
further three for testing. Since in a FN walk, there is the
looming effect caused by the subject approaching the camera.
This causes the movements to grow larger and show a definite
trend in the data as will be seen in Figures 3 and 4. The data
trend is immediately removed and normalized in the following
way:
i) Use the coordinates of the bm marker as the origin of the
markers.
ii) The length between the tm/bm markers are used to divide
the distance between the bm marker and the other marker
coordinates.
Thus every subject will have 12 time series associated with the
x and y movements of the 6 markers attached to the body, for
a FN walk. We have 12 subjects giving a total of 144 time
series. In a FP walk, we have only 6 time series from 3 markers
and 2 sequences, giving 12 time series. This is because
analysis using FP data are well documented in the literature.
Of the gait datasets currently available, most are of the FP
view taken at low resolution. Features for recognition include
frequencies of motion from Fourier-based decomposition of
the motion signal. As described by Lee et al. [19] these gait
datasets are not suited for our use and there are few substantial
video sequences of FN gait available. Thus we create and
explore the use of a dataset that focuses on and exploits the
advantages of the FN view. The experience gained in using this
smaller dataset will serve to prepare for larger scale work. We
have FP gait sequences which are used for confirmatory tests
of linearity only. 
III. THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS OF NONLINEAR SIGNAL
ANALYSIS AND DATA ANALYSIS PROCEDURE
This section looks at the theory used to analyze the
linearity of gait signals. The plot of the autocorrelation
function (ac.f) gives a quick visual indicator of the nature of
the signal. Of the several analytical methods available, there
are those based on frequency domain approaches like that of
the bispectrum or higher order moments which do not need
parameters. In the time domain, Autoregressive (AR) and
Moving Average (MA) models are popular. These methods
model the human walk using a set of computed parameters.
A. Testing for nonlinearity using nonparametric methods
The nonparametric method of surrogate data introduced by
Theiler et al. [20] uses a more general form of statistical
hypothesis testing where we postulate the null hypothesis of
Figure 2. Marker positions: Left - FN view Right - FP view

linearity. Then simulated data are generated from the processes
which are known to have linear and stationary properties. A
discriminating statistic is computed on the simulated data and
a critical value determined, based on various levels of
significance for which the hypothesis holds.
Using the experimental data now, the discriminating
statistic is again computed and compared with the critical
values which now act as threshold values. We seek to reject the
null hypothesis so that the alternative is true - i.e., the presence
of nonlinearity. Surrogate data is one way to obtain simulated
data conforming to the null hypothesis. The steps are:
i. 
A Fourier transform (FT) is applied to the data. 
ii.
In the transformed data, the phase is randomized.
iii. The data set is converted back to the time domain. 
The surrogate data has linear properties and maintains the
stationary properties of the original data, like the variance and
autocorrelation. Various modifications on the basic algorithm
refine on how well the stationary properties are kept. Thus the
surrogate data are Gaussian, linear and stationary. Many sets
of surrogate data can be generated by changing the random
seed. Using surrogate data requires a suitable discriminating
statistic to be determined from both experimental and
surrogate data and a comparison made. Schreiber and Schmitz
showed that a statistic based on nonlinear predictor errors
(NPE) gives good results for detecting nonlinearity as
compared to several others [21]. The null hypothesis of
linearity postulates that the NPE computed from the original
data lies within normal variation limits with the NPE obtained
from sets of surrogate data [22]. Nonlinearity points the way to
novel methods of analysis such as that used in chaos theory. 
For the sake of completeness, we include a brief discussion
about the use of prediction as a test of linearity - a fuller
account may be found in [23]. Assuming a signal with a
deterministic structure, its predicted values in the short term
may be expressed as a linear weighted sum of its previous
values in the time domain as described in (1). Of course, we
will use values already in the time series to compute the
prediction error. If the previous values are shuffled around as
in the case of surrogate data, there will be a large variation in
the short term predicted values of the surrogate data. However
if we use a suitable nonlinear prediction method which does
not depend on linear computations, the predicted values should
not vary so much in the surrogate data. This approach uses
nonlinear prediction in phase space as explained in Section
III.B.
Of the many ways of characterizing nonlinear behaviour,
we select the most widely used from two major categories. The
first consists of examining its overall behaviour using phase
space approaches. A widely used method invokes deterministic
chaos theory.  Another set of approaches is similar to linear
analysis, but this time the signal is split into constituent
nonlinear functions. For the sake of completeness, we describe
an earlier work of ours using a measure of chaos, namely the
1
Largest Lyapunov Exponent, or ë  to characterize gait [8].
B.  Measuring Chaos with Lyapunov Exponents
To test for nonlinear chaotic behaviour, a scalar time
series is subjected to dynamical analysis which assumes that
the time series data x is generated by a vector valued process.
The actual state vectors describing this process may never be
known. But we can create a  set of  phase space vectors which
are topographically equivalent, and can be considered to be a
reconstruction of them. Takens’ "method of delays" is an
established method for doing this [24]. He also shows that if
the dimension of the phase space vectors m is larger than the
dimension of the chaotic attractor D, we can say that the phase
vectors embed the state vectors and m > 2D + 1. Thus the
reconstructed trajectory of X is made up of several phase space
vectors as follows:
  
i
where X  is the state of the system at sample i. Each row of X
is a phase-space vector with a length of the embedding
i
dimension m. That is, for each X ,
 
1
2
N
where ô is the time lag for a time series x = {x , x ,..., x } with
N points. So X is an M by m matrix, and we have M the number
of phase space vectors being N ! (m ! 1)ô. The set of phase
vectors describes a path or a trajectory in m dimensional space,
and analyzing its behaviour gives a measure of chaos.
For parameter ô, the standard method is to take the time
when the autocorrelation plot first goes to zero. But in Figure
7 we see that it never reaches zero until the end of the walk, so
we use the time delayed mutual information measure as
proposed by Fraser and Swinney [25]. For parameter m, we use
the method of false nearest neighbours (FNN) proposed by
Kennel et al. in [26].
In characterizing chaotic behaviour, the largest Lyapunov
1
exponent ë  is the most useful and commonly used measure. If
the system equations generating the data are known, it is quite
1
straightforward to calculate it. ë  describes how quickly
trajectories approach or come together, given different initial
conditions. This comes directly from a definition of chaos.
1
Then ë  is the mean exponential rate of divergence of two
0
i
initially close trajectories from an initial time t  to t . The
j
divergence d  between the j  set of points on the two
th
trajectories is the Euclidean distance between them.
1
One of the more recent methods to calculate ë  was formulated
by Rosenstein [27] and independently, by Kantz [28]. This
method is suitable for small and noisy data sets. Assume a
i
fixed sampling time period Ät and that at t  the sample number
i 
0
i
is i so that t - t  = iÄt. We substitute the subscripted time t  by
its index i. Taking logarithms on both sides of (2), we have:

log  d (i)  =   ë iÄt + log  d (0)

j
The initial separation log  d (0) is constant, so we have a group
of  j  = 1 to M (phase space vectors) approximately parallel
lines for the sample number i. The main feature of this method
2
j
is that we average the log  d (i) values for all j pairs of sample
points at each sample j. Then
where <A> is the average operator. We average further  by
fitting a line using Least Squares to the “average line” of (3)
1
after which, ë  is the slope of the fitted lines. This will be
shown in Section V.
C. The Hilbert Huang Transform
Recently, the EMD technique has been used for signal
analysis and decomposition. Huang et al. pioneered its use in
ocean wave studies [29]. It was motivated by the need to study
nonlinearity and nonstationarity by obtaining the instantaneous
frequency and amplitude of a signal as defined in (5). These
allow us to see where the signal is changing, but the difficulty
lies in the scale of the change, for example intermittent
background noise in a larger say, audio signal. Traditional
time-frequency signal processing methods like the Fourier
Transform wavelet analysis do not provide a sharp distinction
between the various harmonic components of the signal [30]. 
The HHT attempts to overcome this problem in a two-step
process. Firstly, EMD decomposes a signal into a set of
constituent functions, which are the IMFs at suitable scales of
the signal. These functions are then subject to the Hilbert
Transform which gives amplitude and phase information over
the duration of the signal from which we obtain the
instantaneous frequency and amplitude.
1) IMFs and the sifting process
Assuming the signal is oscillatory, IMFs have two special
properties - firstly, the number of extrema and zero crossings
must be equal or differ by one. Secondly, the envelope of a
signal touching the local maxima and the envelope touching
the local minima of the IMF has a local mean value of zero.
The signal x(t) is decomposed into its IMFs through the
process 
of 
sifting. 
Rather 
than 
fitting 
a 
predefined
mathematical procedure, this works with the signal data
1
directly. For the first function IMF :
i.   locate all the extrema of x(t)
ii.  generate the envelope signals touching the maxima and
max
min
minima e
(t) and e
(t) respectively
max
min
iii. obtain the mean signal m(t) = (e
(t) + e
(t))/2
iv. from the original and mean signal, obtain the residual 
     signal r(t) =  x(t) ! m(t)
v.  iterate steps i to iv by substituting r(t) into x(t) until a  
1
     given criterion is met. The residual signal is IMF .
2
The next function IMF  is derived by using x(t) ! m(t) in place
of x(t) above. The whole process stops when a monotonic IMF
is obtained. IMFs may or not have constant amplitude and
frequency and can be used to reconstitute the original signal,
or for further processing. In our case, the Hilbert Transform is
applied to each IMF obtain the instantaneous frequency.
2) The Hilbert Transform
The Hilbert Transform computes the conjugate function
y(t) of any real valued function x(t). By doing so, an analytic
function z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) is defined. In polar form:
where ù(t) and a(t) are the instantaneous frequency and
amplitude, respectively at time t. From this, other measures
like the mean instantaneous frequency (MIF) and the weighted
mean instantaneous frequency (WMIF) can be derived for each
IMF of the original signal. Then using quantities defined in (4)
for N samples, for a given IMF.
3) Analysis procedure
Since there is such a wide range of data, we perform a
simple data reduction operation for ease of analysis. We use
the simple average of the WIMFs of all the markers of a
subject, looking for those which remain relatively constant for
separate gait sessions. This is done to use as much
idiosyncratic information as possible.
 
IV. RESULTS FROM PRIOR EXPERIMENTS
This section covers the waveforms obtained from tracking
body parts and the results required for nonlinear analyses of
signals from previous publications and have been reproduced
here for the sake of completeness. The results concern the tests
for linearity or the lack of it and the derivation of parameters
required for proper embedding of data as explained in Section
III.B.
As described earlier, the subjects in our dataset are
designated by symbols such as s01, s02, s04 and so on. Those
having the suffix ‘a' are the second video sequence of the
subject, as s02a is the second video from s02. The
unnormalized and normalized plots for a FP walk are  shown
in Figures 3 and 5 respectively. In this figure, the x-axis
motion would seem to swamp out that of the y-axis. This can
be visualized for example, that the horizontal left to right
motion of an arm swing is larger than that of the vertical
motion.

Figure 5. Plot of normalized FP walk 
Figure 4. Plots of the markers for an unnormalized FN walk
In Figure 3 we note the motion of the body parts, in particular
the x-axis coordinates which show an increase with a linear
trend, reflecting the steady walking speed of the subject. By
normalizing, we obtain the periodic waveform shown in Figure
5.  
As a comparison, the corresponding plots for the FN walk
are shown in Figures 4 and 6. In Figure 4 the coordinates
increase with a nonlinear trend, a consequence of the physics
of a thin  lens. Here the dimensions of an object in the lens’
focal plane varies inversely with the object distance from the
lens [31]. However, the normalized plot in Figure 6 gives a
semblance of a periodic waveform.
A. Linearity tests
In this section we show the results of the tests for signal
linearity. The first is the autocorrelation plot for FP gait in
Figure 9 which shows strong periodicity in movement,
especially in the x-axis which due to its large amplitude
swamps out - that is obscures - the “non-periodic” signal in the
y-axis when considering the total movement of the hand. In
contrast, the autocorrelation plot for the FN gait in Figure 7
does not show any periodicity in any of the twelve marker
trajectories. This is an indicator of nonlinear dynamics or
chaotic behaviour. However, it is interesting to note that the
motion of a FN walk silhouette is periodic [32].

TABLE 1 
NONLINEAR PREDICTION ERROR FOR A TYPICAL FN  WALK
T-TEST RESULT
We now look at the results for nonparametric testing of
nonlinear behaviour as discussed in Section III.A. The
nonlinear prediction error is a discriminating statistic which
gives a good test of linearity. 
It is generated from surrogate data and compared with that
from the experimental data. An embedding dimension m = 2
was used, with a time delay ô = 5. These values are determined
experimentally in Section IV.B. A total of 19 surrogate data
series were computed from the movement of one body part.
For example in Table 1, lhy denotes the values of the
movement of the left knee, y axis.
  
Here, sMean, sSTD are the mean and standard deviation
of the values in all the 19 surrogate data series, dMean is the
value for the actual data. We use the t-test to see if dMean lies
within the variability of surrogate data described by sMean and
sSTD. The probability column indicates the probability that
0
dMean can be described by the null hypothesis H  being true.
0
We see that for the first entry the data probably fits H , and
0
more weakly for the third entry, but the rest reject H . Thus the
null hypothesis can be rejected and the data can be considered
nonlinear. In Figure 8 we show the plot of the lhx marker of a
subject and two of its surrogates.

In Table 2, for the FP walk, we include the t-statistic instead of
the standard deviation. This is because we see the x-axis
values, those marked with an ‘*” in the last column, having
0
high t-statistic values (indicating rejection of H ) even though
they seem strongly periodic. This phenomenon has been
described by Stam et al. [33], and is actually an indication of
0
the strongly periodic signals and thus an acceptance of H .

Since we have evidence of the nonlinearity of FN gait, we have
justification for using nonlinear measures on the data from FN
gait.
B. Measures of chaosity
Recall in Section III.B, that in order to characterize chaos,
a first step is to embed the data into vectors, which require the
parameters m and ô, For ô and using the mutual information
measure, we show a sample plot in Figure 10 for one person.
The point at which the first minimum of the plot is taken to be
the best value for ô which is 2 in this case, for all twelve
marker trajectories. For m, we use the method of false nearest
neighbours (FNN) as described in Section III.B. A typical plot
is shown in Figure11. Taking the average of all the largest
values where the FNN goes to zero, we find the nearest integer
value to be six.
 
V. RESULTS
In this section, we present the results of our experiments on
characterizing gait using nonlinear measures of determinstic
chaos and also quantities derived from the HHT. 
A. Characterizing gait using measures of deterministic chaos 
As we have also discussed in Section III.B, the slope of 
1
the line fitted to the trajectory will be ë . In Figure 12 we see
1
a plot of ë  for the twelve marker trajectories of a person. We
1
see that the data is mildly chaotic as ë  is positive. As a data
1
1
reduction measure, we compute the average 'ë  of all the ë  of
the markers for a subject. An interesting observation in Table
1
3 is that subjects having similar 'ë  are s02, s03 and s10. We
now employ a similar approach for the HHT.

TABLE 4 Weighted mean instantaneous frequency for IMF  of markers
of 3 subjects
(6)
B. Characterizing gait with HHT
The decomposition of the waveform of the lhx movement
of a subject in Figure 8 (marked “original data”) using EMD
is shown in Figure 13.  Here we show the plots for the IMF and
WMIF. As we see from the top of the left column of Figure 13
the first few IMF’s have a lot of high frequency content
accounting for the fine movements of the marker. The
frequency decreases with increasing IMFs. While the similarity
to frequency decomposition methods like Fourier and wavelet
analysis is there, note that the IMF waveforms do not have
analytical expressions, hence the empirical nature of EMD. In
the right column we see the normalized instantaneous
frequency and amplitude at each sample point.
Through experimentation, we found that the third IMF
gave the best results, leaving out the knee markers lkx/y, rkx/y
and using WMIF instead of the MIF. In Table 4, we show the
WMIF for only the 3 subjects with an extra video sequence. As
in the case of chaosity we use as a feature the simple average
of all the WMIFs of the markers of a subject, excluding the
knee markers. This is indicated by the avg wimf row at the
bottom row of Table 4.
C. Class separability
We apply statistical pattern recognition techniques to our 
data set even though it is small, to check the feasibility for
when a suitable corpus of data is available. We assume that the
subjects belong to a class and we examine the separability of
the classes and if needed, to see if using other features can
help. The values of a feature for a subject are assumed to be
normally distributed, the prior probabilities of each class are
the same, and we use the pooled variance as the variance of the
data for all the subjects. Since there are only three subjects
with a test video, we will use the variance from these groups.
ij
The Bhattacharyya distance B  between classes, defined as:
where ì and Ó are the mean and variance of the classes is used
extensively used for measurements of class separability.

Since we are using the pooled variance, the log term will be
1
zero. This is more useful than showing the values of 'ë  for all
the subjects. The results of the calculation between pairs of
1
classes are shown in Table 5 for the 'ë  measure. This is
reproduced from [6] for comparison and a more complete
discussion. Since the table has are symmetric data, in the
interests of clarity, we show only the upper diagonal values.
ij
We see that some classes are poorly separated with a B  value
(rounded) that is less than  or equal to 1. For example classes
s04, s06 and s07 cannot be disambiguated, between s08 and
s12, s02 and s11 as well.
Similarly, in Table 6 for the WIMF classes that cannot be
disambiguated are s01, s02, s06, s08, s11 between s10 and s11,
and s05 and s12. Making the assumption that the poorly
1
separated classes are not separable, we fuse the 'ë  measure
mentioned earlier, so we can successfully classify members of
our data set. Now we combine both features to see if we can
achieve a better result. We combine both features using a
logical AND. For example, if the avg WMIF (HHT-based
feature) denotes the person being in the group s01, s02, s06,
1
s08, s11 and the 'ë  (Largest Lyapunov Exponent based
feature) being in the group s04, s06 and s07, the person would
be s06. To save space, we now show the combined confusion
matrix in Table 7.

A useful result is that we are able to separate all classes
successfully using these two nonlinear measures.
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We have used a camera as a sensor to derive the gait
signals of a person in a multimedia video data stream. The
objective is to see if the data can be used to identify a person.
We have shown by using several types of analyses that signals
derived from FN gait is nonlinear in nature. This is in contrast
to current approaches which impose linear analyses of gait
signals for convenience. This gives us a basis for using
nonlinear measures of gait. In our experiments, the simple
average of the nonlinear features by themselves are not able to
discriminate completely between the classes of subjects.
However, by combining them, we get a successful result. The
novelty of our approach lies in the evaluation and use of both
cyclostationarity and nonlinear measures of the gait signal.
While our dataset is small, we note that the number of
nonlinear features we can extract from the gait signals is
potentially very large. A more exhaustive search for features
and combinations of signals may yield useful results in terms
of deriving new biometrics or improved recognition rates. So
future work will need to test this out for current biometrics in
a larger dataset and in a markerless environment. There is also
much scope for investigating other types of signal analysis that
is not based on linearity and stationarity assumptions. By doing
so, we capitalize on the ubiquity of video cameras, from which
we are able to obtain sensory data which can be used to
augment security networks.
