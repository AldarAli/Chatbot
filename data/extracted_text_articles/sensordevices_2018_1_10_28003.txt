Abstract—Processing of the Co-rich glass-coated microwire by
Joule-heating allows considerable improvement of magnetic
softness and Giant Magneto-Impedance (GMI) effect. At
optimal Joule heating conditions, we observed GMI ratio up to
650%, low magnetic anisotropy field of about 25 A/m and
coercivity
of
about
2
A/m.
Observed

considering
various
factors
affecting the magnetic properties of studied microwire upon
Joule heating: induced magnetic anisotropy, internal stresses
relaxation and radial distribution of magnetic anisotropy.

INTRODUCTION
Giant Magneto-Impedance (GMI) effect presenting one
of the highest sensitivities to applied magnetic field has
become a topic of great attention owing to it interest for
development of cost effective magnetic field sensors and
devices [1]-[7].
In most of publications [1]-[8], the expression for the
GMI effect through the GMI ratio, Z/Z, defined as:
Z/Z = [Z (H) - Z (Hmax)] / Z (Hmax),
(1)
is used.
The highest GMI ratio up to 650 %, as well as magnetic
field
sensitivity
up
to
10%/A/m
were
reported
experimentally for amorphous magnetic Co-rich microwires
[9] [10]. These achievements allowed to develop a number
of extremely sensitive magnetic sensors and magnetometers
using magnetic wire presenting GMI effect [5][6][11]-[13].
Theoretically predicted maximum GMI ratio is about
3000% [14] that is few times superior to the experimentally
reported maximum Z/Z-values [9][10].
Therefore, it is
expected that experimentally reported GMI effect can be
considerably
improved
by
preparation
technology
improvement, as well as by using of effective post-
processing methods. It is clear that the use of magnetic
materials
with
higher
GMI
effect
can
improve
the
performance
of
magnetic
devices.
Consequently,
considerable efforts have been paid to study the post-
processing on GMI ratio of various magnetic materials [4]
[7][15]-[18].
Developed GMI sensors present excellent magnetic field
sensitivity, quick response and low power consumption [5].
However, one of the weak points of the GMI sensors is the
size [5][19]. The demagnetizing factor and hence the
diameter of magnetic wires is the limiting factor [7][20].
Therefore, thin magnetically soft wires are highly demanded
for development of the GMI sensors.
The thinnest magnetic wires with ferromagnetic metallic
nucleus diameter from 0.05 to 80 m covered by glass
coating can be prepared using Taylor-Ulitovsky method [4]
[7][21].
Presence
of
glass-coating
results
in
elevated
magnetoelastic anisotropy [22]-[25]. The common way for
improvement of the magnetic softness is a careful selection
of
chemical
composition
of
metallic
alloy
allowing
achievement of vanishing magnetostriction coefficient [4]
[10]. However, experimentally observed GMI ratio values
are still considerably lower than theoretically predicted
optimized GMI ratio (about 3000%) [14][26]. As showed
elsewhere, the value of GMI ratio is intrinsically related to
magnetic
softness
[27].
Therefore,
further
efforts
for
optimization of magnetic softness are expected to improve
the GMI ratio in amorphous wires.
The most common post-processing of magnetic materials
usually consists of annealing [4]. However, conventional
annealing
of
Co-rich
originates
considerable
magnetic
hardening hence deterioration of GMI effect [4][7][10][28].
Observed changes of magnetic properties induced by the
conventional annealing in Co-rich microwires have been
explained
considering
change
of
the
magnetostriction
coefficient value and sign as well as modification of the

domain structure and remagnetization process mechanism
related to the stresses relaxation [10][28].
On the other hand, GMI ratio enhancement has been
reported after stress-annealing or Joule heating of Co-rich
microwires
at
certain
annealing
conditions
[7].
This
difference has been associated to the induced magnetic
anisotropy. The origin of the anisotropy induced by stress or
magnetic field annealing of amorphous materials has been
previously attributed the directional ordering of atomic pairs,
compositional and topological short- range ordering or back
stresses [29]-[31].
Consequently, it is expected that the GMI ratio can by
improved by the Joule. Up to now, only a few experimental
results on effect of Joule heating on GMI effect have been
reported [7]
Consequently, in this paper we systematically studied the
influence of Joule heating on magnetic properties and GMI
effect of Co-rich glass-coated microwires.
In the section Experimental details, we present the
description of the experimental techniques used for the
sample preparation and characterization, while in the
Experimental results and discussion, we describe the results
on the effect of Joule heating on hysteretic properties and the
GMI effect of Co-rich microwires.
II.
EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
We studied the influence of Joule heating on magnetic
properties and GMI effect of Co67Fe3.9Ni1.4B11.5Si14.5Mo1.6
amorphous glass-coated microwires (total diameter, D= 26.6
m, metallic nucleus diameter, d=25.6 m) prepared by
Taylor-Ulitovsky method described elsewhere [1][4][7].
The hysteresis loops were measured by the fluxmetric
method as described in previous publications on magnetic
microwires [7]. We represent the hysteresis loops as the
dependence of normalized magnetization, M/MHmax (where M
is the sample´s magnetic moment at given magnetic field, H,
and MHmax is the sample´s magnetic moment at the maximum
magnetic field amplitude, Hm ) versus magnetic field, H.
We employed the DC current values, I, of 30 and 40 mA
selected in order to avoid the deterioration of magnetic
properties related to the crystallization. Employed current
densities (58.3 and 77.7 A/mm2 for 30 and 40 mA
respectively) were clearly below the value that can produce
magnetic hardening and/or crystallization of the samples
[32].
All the measurements have been performed for the same
sample. We have measured the hysteresis loops and GMI
effect in the as-prepared sample, then the same sample has
been annealed. All the measurements have been performed
after each annealing and then the same sample has been
annealed again. Finally, we obtained the dependencies of
maximum GMI ratio, ΔZ/Zmax on frequency, f, at different
annealing time, tann.
The impedance and its magnetic field dependence were
evaluated using the micro-strip sample holder previously
described elsewhere [16][26]. The microwire impedance, Z,
was evaluated from the reflection coefficient S11 measured by
the vector network analyzer (Agilent N5230A).
The GMI ratio, ΔZ/Z, is defined using eq. (1). Use of
aforementioned technique allows to measure GMI effect in
the extended frequency range (up to 1 GHz).

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
As-prepared
Co67Fe3.9Ni1.5B11.5Si14.5Mo1.6
microwire
presents quite soft magnetic properties characterized by
hysteresis loop with low coercivity (about 7 A/m) typical for
glass-coated
microwires
with
low
and
negative
magnetostriction coefficient (see Figure 1).
Consequently, high GMI ratio (with ΔZ/Zmax≈550% at 
f=300
MHz)
is
observed,
even
for
as-prepared
Co67Fe3.9Ni1.4B11.5Si14.5Mo1.6 microwire (see Figure 2).

ΔZ/Z(H) dependence
previously
reported for Co-rich magnetic wires with low negative
magnetostriction coefficient usually associated to weak
circumferential magnetic anisotropy [4][7][27].
After Joule heating at certain conditions, we observed
increase of maximum GMI ratio, ΔZ/Zmax, as shown for
example for the sample annealed at 40 mA for 3 and 5 min
(Figures.3a and 3b). At this annealing condition ΔZ/Zmax
≈650% is observed. However, increasing the annealing time 
ΔZ/Zmax decreases (see Figure. 3c for 40 mA, tann=10 min).
Similarly, considered magnetic softening is observed
after Joule heating at certain conditions: as-compared to as-

lower
coercivity, of about 2 A/m (see Figure 4a).
Additionally, from Figure 4a, it can be observed that
current annealed sample presents lower magnetic anisotropy
field, Hk, of about 25 A/m. Similar magnetic properties (Hc≈ 
2 A/m and Hk ≈32 A/m) are also observed for current 
annealed microwire at 30 mA for 3 min (see Figure 4b). But
further increasing of annealing time (at I= 30 mA) results in
slight increasing of coercivity (up to 6 A/m at tann= 20 min)
and of magnetic anisotropy field (up to 75 A/m) (see Figure.
4c).
The evolution of the magnetic anisotropy field, Hk, after
current annealing is presented in Figure 5.
The observed results are summarized in Figure 6 where

frequency, ΔZ/Zmax(f), for different annealing conditions. As
it can be observed, we achieved remarkable improvement of
ΔZ/Zmax from 550% (observed for as-prepared sample) up to
650% (achieved after current annealing at 30mA or 40 mA
for short annealing time of 3 and 5 min). Superior ΔZ/Zmax is
observed in a whole frequency range, although the optimum
frequency where ΔZ/Zmax ≈650% in current annealed samples 
is about 200 MHz, while for as-prepared samples the highest
ΔZ/Zmax ≈550% is observed at about 300 MHz (see Figure 6). 
The observed influence of current annealing on magnetic
softness
of
Co67Fe3.9Ni1.5B11.5Si14.5Mo1.6
glass-coated
microwire must be attributed not only to the sample heating,
but
also
to
the
circumferential
magnetic
field
Hcirc
(associated to the current I flowing through the sample).
The aforementioned circumferential magnetic field, Hcirc,
produced by the current (Oersted field) in the surface of the
metallic nucleus can be evaluated as following:
Hcirc=I/2πr  
(2)
where I is the current value, r- radial distance.
Evaluated values of Hcirc on the surface of studied
microwire are Hcirc ≈ 0.375 kA/m and 0.5 kA/m for I=30 mA
and 40 mA respectively for studied microwire. These Hcirc –
values are clearly superior to the Hk–values evaluated from
the hysteresis loops (see Figure 2) and hence can affect the
magnetization near the surface during the current annealing.
It is worth mentioning that the Oersted field changes
from 0 in the microwire axis to its maximum value in the
surface. Therefore, the thin layer in the surface of metallic
nucleus is affected by the Oersted magnetic field during the
Joule heating. In fact, this layer is involved in the GMI
effect.
As mentioned above, it is known that the annealing in
presence of magnetic field can considerably affect the
magnetic anisotropy of amorphous materials [29]-[36]. The
macroscopic magnetic anisotropy is originated by a preferred
magnetization direction during the annealing and previously
discussed considering the directional ordering of atomic
pairs or compositional short- range ordering, as well as the
topological short-range ordering [29]-[36].
For the present studies of microwire containing Fe, Co
and Ni, the pair ordering looks rather reasonable. We must
assume that the evolution of magnetic properties and GMI
effect must be affected by the competition of induced
magnetic anisotropy related to the presence of the Oersted
field as well as stress relaxation and related change of the
magnetostriction
coefficient
reported
for
conventional
furnace annealing [7].
Therefore, it is expected that the current annealing can
considerably affect the GMI performance and the hysteresis
loops of the studied microwires. We believe that this
circumferential magnetic field does not allow magnetic
hardening previously reported for conventional furnace
annealing of Co-rich microwires [7][18][28].

CONCLUSIONS
We have investigated the influence of Joule heating on
GMI
ratio
of
Co67Fe3.9Ni1.5B11.5Si14.5Mo1.6
glass-coated
microwire. From the obtained dependence, we determined
the optimal current annealing conditions and obtained
considerable improvement of ΔZ/Zmax –values from 550% to
about 650% after appropriate current annealing conditions.
Additionally, current annealed microwires present excellent
magnetic softness with low magnetic anisotropy field of
about 25 A/m and coercivity of 2 A/m.
The
observed
dependencies
have
been
discussed
considering
magnetic
anisotropy
induced
by
circular
magnetic anisotropy during current annealing, internal
stresses relaxation and radial distribution of magnetic
anisotropy.
