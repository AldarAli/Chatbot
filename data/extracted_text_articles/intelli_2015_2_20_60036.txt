Abstract—Regarding Signal integrity (SI) degradation problem 
in printed circuit boards, conventional design techniques based 
on the impedance-matching theory cannot work any longer in 
the GHz-domain. In this paper, we propose a novel bio-
inspired SI improvement design methodology using genetic 
algorithms. We apply our proposed methodology to real 
memory bus systems and demonstrate its effectiveness using 
prototypes.

 INTRODUCTION 
Signal Integrity (SI) degradation is one of the most 
serious problems in the printed circuit board (PCB) in the 
GHz-era [1] [2]. Figure 1 shows one of waveform examples 
observed in DDR-3 memory bus system. Conventionally, a 
number of trace designs, which are based on the impedance 
matching theory, have been used in the MHz-domain. The 
conventional designs, however, are becoming ineffective as 
the frequency increases and cannot work any longer in the 
GHz-domain.

In Section II, we propose a novel trace (transmission) 
structure that can overcome the SI degradation problem. In 
Section III, we describe its design methodology based on the 
genetic algorithms (GAs) and details of GA operations. In 
Section IV, we demonstrate its effectiveness showing one of 
prototypes for memory-bus prototypes.

BIO-INSPIRED TRANSMISSION LINE STRUCTURE 
In the proposed trace structure, which we call it 
segmental transmission line (STL), a transmission line is 
divided 
into 
multiple 
(N) 
segments 
of 
individual 
characteristic impedance Zi (i = 1, 2, ..., N) as shown in 
Figure 2. And Zi are adjusted to achieve an ideal digital 
waveform at important points, such as input points to the 
Large Scale Integrated Circuits (LSIs) on the line by 
superposing reflection waves, which are generated at the 
interfaces between adjacent segments Zi and Zj. Figure 3 
shows a bird-eye view of the STL in the PCB. Characteristic 
impedance Z is a function of trace width W, so that Z can be 
thus controlled by adjusting W. 
The adjustment of all Zi , or  Wi, however, results in a 
combinatorial explosion problem. We thus have proposed to 
apply the GAs to solve this problem. The STL consists of 
one-dimensional array of Zi, which is similar in structure to 
the genome, so that it can be easily and well mapped onto the 
chromosome in GAs as shown in Figure 4.

III. 
DESIGN METHODOLOGY BASED ON GA 
A. Chromosome 
In an earlier design, we used only the characteristic 
impedances Zi as genes in a simple chromosome (see the 
upper section of Figure 5). As a modification of this early 
design, we proposed a hybrid chromosome, which was 
created by adding segments of length Li as genes (see the 
lower section of Figure. 5).

Figure 5. Simple chromosome (upper) and hybrid chromosome (lower). 
 
The segment lengths Li can adjust the timing of the 
superposition of the reflected waves, and thus we expect that 
the hybrid chromosomes result in a higher SI than that 
obtained from the simple chromosomes. 
B. Crossover 
It has been shown that, in the STL design, intervals of 1 
 are sufficiently small that the Zi can be treated as integer 
parameters. The Zi are independent of each other in the 
segments, and thus no fatal gene can be generated in the 
simple crossover operations. In a simple chromosome or the 
Zi part of a hybrid chromosome, genes can be easily 
exchanged by a simple crossover operation, as shown in 
Figure 6. In the figure, genes in chromosomes 1 and 2 are 
exchanged at point Cp. 
On the other hand, the crossover operation for the 
segment length Li is not as easy as it is for Zi, because there 
is a strict condition that the sum of all segment lengths Li is 
fixed as the trace length. Furthermore, the timing of the 
superposition of the waveforms is very sensitive to the 
propagation time. We thus have to treat the Lis as real 
number genes with a fixed trace length. 
Figure 7 shows a newly proposed crossover operation for 
the Li genes; it is based on the BX-crossover [3][4]. For 
example, a 20 cm trace is divided into 5 segments, and 
before the crossover operation, the segment lengths Li are 
normalized and changed to the boundaries A1 to A4 in 
chromosome 1 and B1 to B4 in chromosome 2.

Two boundaries, say, A3 and B3, which have no other 
boundaries between them, are then chosen at random. And 
the range B3 to A3 is then expanded by  percent (10 ≤  ≤ 
20). Finally, two new boundaries, A3* and B3*, are chosen 
randomly in the expanded range, and they are changed from 
their previous lengths. This expanded BX- crossover has 
worked well in practical applications and has found excellent 
solutions, which will be discussed below. 
C. Fitness evaluation 
For the periodic (clock) signals propagating in the PCB 
traces, each chromosome was scored based on half of the 
periodic waveform simulated using the SPICE circuit 
simulator, as shown in Figure 8 (see equations in the figure 
also). The reciprocal of the difference area Diff between the 
ideal waveform I(t) and the waveform R(t) was used as the 
score (fitness), so that the score increased as the waveform 
improved or approached the ideal waveform.  
For the random (data) signals, we used a long periodic 
signal of 1000000…1000000… as shown in Figure 9; this 
can be regarded as an impulse input. If the ideal impulse 
propagates in the trace, impulse response theory guarantees a 
high SI. Thus, in the STL design for the random signals, the 
reciprocal of the difference area Diff, including the reflection 
wave, works well as the score (fitness); see Figure 9. 
IV. 
PROTOTYPE AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
We have applied the STL to some high-speed digital data 
transfer systems. Figure 10 shows one of design examples, 
which is used in the Double Data Rate (DDR) memory bus. 
In the STL design, we used a set of characteristic 
impedances from 30  to 120 at intervals of 5 intervals.

Figure 10. DDR memory bus system and STL. 
 
In Figure 11, the periodical waveform in the conventional 
transmission line is seriously distorted with some reflection 
waves and it cannot be used as the clock signal in real 
systems. In the STL, the distorted waves are well improved 
and it is almost the same as the ideal clock signal. 
In Figure 12, the eye diagram, which is used to evaluate 
SI in random digital signals, in the conventional transmission 
line is dramatically distorted, and its aperture is close to 0.2 
V high and 1.1 ns wide, which is not of practical use.  
In contrast to the conventional transmission line, the eye 
diagram in the STL clearly opens to a height of 1.1 V and a 
width of 1.3 ns, which is sufficiently large to be used in 
practice.

CONCLUSIONS 
A novel PCB trace structure and its bio-inspired design 
methodology are proposed in order to overcome SI 
digraration problem in GHz-domain. Some remarkable SI 
improvement results were demonstrated in the real memory 
bus prototype fabricated by the proposed methodology.
