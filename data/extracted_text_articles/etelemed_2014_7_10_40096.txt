Abstract—Medical images are an important part of the 
diagnostic process. In many cases the accuracy of diagnosis 
depends on the quality of the image. Therefore, the image 
quality improvement is an essential part of medical imaging 
techniques. Now the quality enhancement process is divided 
into two parts: pre-processing, whose task is to optimize the 
image quality in the process of its creation by digital devices 
and apparata, and post-processing, whose task is increasing 
the readability and intelligibility of images on the physician’s 
computer display. 
The proposed paper offers a new post-
processing method for X-ray image quality enhancement using 
the theory of High Dynamic Range images (HDR-images). 
Since one could not get real images with different exposures, 
four techniques to simulate various levels of image exposures 
for HDR-image creation are proposed and analysed in the 
presented paper.  
Keywords - medical imaging; X-rays; HDR-images; quality 
enhancement. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The investigation and development of new medical 
image processing methods and systems has received great 
attention over the last two decades. This is due to its wide 
range of applications in computer-assisted methods and 
computer-aided methods. Among the many types of image 
processing, image enhancement is one of the vital processes 
– it is one of the preparatory steps and it is applied before 
starting the image analyses. Image enhancement refers to any 
technique that improves or modifies digital images, so the 
resulting image is better suited than the original for a 
particular application. Essential image enhancement includes 
but is not limited to intensity and contrast manipulation, 
noise reduction, background removal, sharpening and 
filtering edges. In this context, 'image enhancement' means 
any method or technique which change digital images, so the 
resulting image is better suited than the original to a 
particular application. Due to this the basic types of image 
enhancement include manipulation of intensity, changing the 
local or global contrast, noise reduction, filtering and 
sharpening edges. During the image enhancement process 
one or more attributes of the image are modified. The choice 
of attributes and the way they are modified is specific to a 
given task. Moreover observer-specific factors such as the 
human visual system and the observer's experience will 
introduce a great deal of subjectivity into the choice of image 
enhancement methods [1]. 
X-ray images are grayscale images with 12-14 bits depth 
and their visual perception depends on the three most 
common image characteristics: brightness, contrast (local 
and global) and sharpness. Apart from these saturation and 
image dynamic range have a significant influence on the 
human perception of the images but they are not directly 
relevant to X-ray images, because images are grayscale (no 
saturation), and the dynamic range of the visualization 
systems (computer displays) is less than human vision 
dynamic range. Therefore, all quality enhancement methods 
change the intensity of pixels so as to provide optimal 
brightness, contrast and sharpness values. While brightness, 
contrast and sharpness may appear to be the simplest of 
image controls on the surface and may appear to be mutually 
exclusive controls, they are related and intertwined in such a 
way that changing any one of them can create quite complex 
effects in post-processed images. This specifies a wide 
variety of methods that have been proposed and are being 
created now – each of these methods seeks to solve the task 
of determining the image characteristics optimal values. A 
sample classification of medical image enhancement 
methods is shown in the Figure 1. [5][6][7][8] 
This paper presents a new image enhancement method 
for X-ray images. The method uses HDR-image creation as a 
technique to increase the image dynamic range. This allows 
after mapping HDR-image to LDR-image (low dynamic 
range image) to get a better distribution of the intensity over 
all pixels in the image.  The result is enhancing brightness, 
contrast and/or sharpness of images without the appearance 
of visible medical artefacts. 
This present paper is structured as follows: 
• Section II looks into the set of methods for HRD 
imaging  
• Section III presents the proposed new enhancement 
method 
• Section IV presents the implementation and analyses of 
the presented method 
• Section IV presents the conclusion.

HDR IMAGING 
A set of methods in photography/imaging, supposed to 
capture/create greater dynamic range between the darkest 
and lightest image areas than current standard digital 
imaging methods, is named High Dynamic Range Imaging 
[2][3]. The human eye covers the dynamic range of about 
105:1 at one time and this is bigger than the top dynamic 
range of most real-world scenes. For comparison, computer

displays have dynamic range of 103:1 and digital cameras 
have dynamic range of 104:1. In the last two years HDR 
cameras with dynamic range just over normal human vision 
dynamic range and displays with near to human vision 
dynamic range began to appear on the market. 
The human vision can be accommodated to a dynamic 
range of 1014:1 but the iris is simply not as flexible and the 
human perception of intensity changes is logarithmic (the 
Weber law). This is much more than the capabilities of 
modern devices for image creation and visualization. 
Therefore, a non-HDR image device takes pictures at one 
exposure level with a limited contrast range. This leads to the 
loss of details in dark or bright image areas, depending on 
the camera exposure setting. HDR methods compensate 
detail loss by taking multiple pictures at different exposure 
levels and stitching them together to create an image which 
presents the greatest number of details in both dark and 
bright areas. Data stored in HDR-images typically 
corresponds to the physical values of luminance/radiance 
that can be observed in the real world and this presents a 
great difference from classical digital images: classical 
digital images represent intensities and colours that should 
appear on an output device (display, printer, plotter, etc.). 
Therefore, HDR image formats are called scene-referred 
while classical digital images are called device-referred. 
 
Figure 1.  Medical image enhancement methods classification. 
In photography dynamic range is measured in EV 
(Exposure Values) differences between the darkest and 
brightest parts of the image that show detail: an increase of 
1 EV is a doubling of the amount of light.  Using EVs not 
very strict categories of images are [4]: 
 
High Dynamic Range (HDR) images: These have a 
dynamic range of about 14EV and these images 
(they use 32-bit float values without limitation for 
channels bits depth) are usually produced by 
merging multiple 12-14 bit images of different 
exposures (most often these are raw data files). 
 
Medium Dynamic Range (MDR) images: These 
have a dynamic range of [9 EV, 12 EV] and can 
originate from a file with 16-bit depth, or by merging 
3 or more 8-bit images with different exposures. 
 
Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images: These have a 
dynamic range of lover than 8 EV. This means one 
8-bit image. 
III. 
OUR QUALITY ENHANCEMENT METHOD 
X-ray images are 12-14 bit grayscale images and their 
visual perception depends on the three most common image 
characteristics: brightness, contrast (local and global) and 
sharpness. Thus, when the image has no sufficient quality, 
this is the result of some incorrect values. As stored 
information in the grayscale images is the values for 
intensity of the image pixels, then all methods for quality 
enhancement are aimed at changing the pixel intensity as a 
way to change the basics characteristics of the image. This 
limits the opportunities for selection of optimal values, 
because a limited amount of information about the 
luminosity/radiance power stored as pixel intensity is used.  
The method proposed below uses a different approach to 
solve the issue of the optimal intensity distribution over 
image pixels.  Following this approach a model of the 
luminosity distribution is created instead, which has led to 
the current image. This is achieved by creating a HDR-image 
because 
it 
represents 
the 
description 
of 
the 
luminosity/radiance in the nature scene. After a HDR-image 
is created the method allows to determine the optimal 
mapping from a HDR-image to a LDR-image. 
To achieve the correct results, it is necessary to establish 
a correct luminosity model of the simulated scene. For the 
HDR-image this is achieved by correctly selected additional 
images with different exposure. In photography this is 
achieved through capturing a new image with a selected 
exposure. Here this is not applicable and the main problem is 
to obtain an image that is accurate enough to simulate 
changes in the original image after changing the exposure. 
From the image processing point of view increasing or 
decreasing the exposure changes the values of brightness, 
contrast and sharpness. Therefore, if the change of image 
pixels intensity resulting from the exposure change can be 
imitated, it can be used to simulate the image exposure 
change when a HDR-image is created. Our tests and analyses 
of results showed that for simulation a change in intensity a 
few different techniques can be used: using the brightness 
and the contrast control; using the gamma-correction; using 
the brightness and the contrast control followed by a gamma-
correction; using the gamma-correction followed by a 
brightness and contrast correction.

A. Using the brightness and the contrast control 
One approach to solve the problem is based on the 
understanding that exposure change by 1 EV means doubling 
the amount of light. As the visual result is increasing of the 
pixels intensity for the entire image, the imitation of intensity 
shift requires calculation of brightness shift. Unfairness of 
this approach is that doubling the amount of light does not 
lead to doubling pixels intensity, because graphic devices 
and the characteristics of the created images reflect the 
human vision characteristics (logarithmic law for change of 
the intensity sensibility). Therefore, besides brightness there 
is also a considerable change in contrast.  
Tests to determine brightness and contrast values were 
conducted: X-rays are captured with different exposures 
(from -3 EV to +3 EV by a 0.5 EV step) and the difference 
between the real image and the simulated image is evaluated 
to select values for brightness and contrast – Table 1 shows 
the results obtained for brightness and contrast (values of 
brightness and contrast are between -100 and +100). An 
example of -1.5 EV exposure simulations is shown in 
Figure 2.

b) the image with +1.5 EV; c) the simulated image with -1.5 EV; d) the 
difference between images (b) and (c) - the histogram is  
stretched twice in order to see the difference. 
Our experiments show that simulation of exposures 
above 2.5 EV and below -2.5 EV is unrealistic and cannot be 
used for HDR-like image generation – when mapping to a 
LDR-image the result always contains medical artefacts. 
However, for bone X-rays, this approach gives very good 
simulations.  
B. Using the gamma-correction control 
Another way to simulate changing the intensity of pixels 
is by changing the gamma-correction.  
The difference between brightness and gamma-correction 
control is that increasing the value of gamma-correction can 
make the image to look brighter, but it is a non-linear change 
and it only increases brightness of the shadows and mid-
tones in the image without affecting the highlights. Our 
experiments showed that this is particularly useful for 
simulating the overexposed images or the lung X-rays.  
Another significant difference is the ability to simulate 
exposure values in the range [-5 EV, +5 EV]. Figure 3 shows 
an example from Figure 2, and Table 2 shows calculated 
values for gamma-correction.

C. Using the brightness and the contrast control followed 
by gamma-correction 
The main disadvantage of using brightness and contrast 
control is the incorrect change of local contrast between lung 
structures and ribs. That is why we tested additional image 
correction – the gamma correction. The result is a significant 
improvement of the simulation - Figure 4 shows the example 
from Figure 2, but now with the new way of correction. 
Table 3 shows calculated values for simulation of an 
exposure change.

D. Using the gamma-correction control followed by 
brightness and the contrast correction 
The last approach to create an exposure simulation is 
gamma-correction control followed by brightness and 
contrast correction. This approach differs from the previous 
one, because the operations are not commutative. When 
comparing the result with the second approach, it appears 
that in this case the lighter areas are correctly changed. The 
result is the best simulation of exposure change of an image - 
Figure 4 shows the example from Figure 2. Table 4 shows 
calculated values for simulation of an exposure change. 
Another advantage of the third approach is the possibility 
to simulate a much larger range of exposure values.

METHOD IMPLEMENTATION AND ANALYSIS OF 
RESULTS 
Using this method to enhance the X-ray quality gives a 
significant change even in the exposure values [0 EV, -0.5 
EV, +0.5 EV] but in general this is not the best combination 
of values.  
There are several different options for the number of 
LDR-images and their exposures from which the HDR-
image will be generated – most common are 3 LDR-images

with exposures [0 EV, -2 EV, +2 EV]. Our tests have shown 
that this set of exposures often leads to increased noise 
levels. So, as a standard set of exposure values, we used 
[0 EV, -1.5 EV, +1.5 EV]. This list of exposure values can 
be used in most cases, but for some specific purposes there 
are other parameters: 
 
In case of overexposed images, the best results are 
achieved with a set of 5 images with exposure values 
[0 EV, -1.5 EV, +1.5 EV, -2 EV, +2 EV].  
 
In case of underexposed images, the best results are 
obtained when using the set of exposure values [0 
EV, -1 EV, - 2.5 EV]. 
 
In case of X-rays of bones, good results are obtained 
with asymmetric values for the minimum and 
maximum exposure – for example [0 EV, -2 EV, +1 
EV]. This set increases details in lighter areas (like 
bone structures).  
 
In case of lung or soft tissues X-rays, good results 
are obtained with opposite asymmetric values for the 
minimum and maximum exposure – for example [0 
EV, -1 EV, +2 EV]. This set increases details in 
darker areas.  
 
In case of an image with a small dynamic range, a 
set of 5 images has to be used. This increases the 
details for all structures with different radiographic 
densities. 
Another major advantage of the proposed method is the 
ability to manage the transformation from a HDR-image to 
the final LDR-image. This allows an optimal image quality 
to be obtained without the occurrence of medical artefacts.  
The comparison of the results of the proposed method 
with other techniques showed that this method can help to 
obtain a major improvement in quality without the 
occurrence of medical artefacts. Especially important is the 
opportunity to use the same characteristics in all cases and 
always to get good quality – for example 5 images with 
exposure values [0 EV, -1.5 EV, +1.5 EV, -2 EV, +2 EV].  
A few examples of the method implementation and 
comparison with Laplacian pyramids filter and CLAHE are 
shown in Figure 6. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
Image quality enhancement is very important because it 
increases readability and understandability of the analysed 
images, their details and structure. When the exploited for 
image generation model is known this increases possibilities 
to correct the image without generation of medical artefacts. 
The presented method for pseudo HRD enhancements of 
medical images enables increasing quality of understanding 
and information gathering.  
The next steps of this research are oriented to X-ray 
images of other body parts like bones, abdominal cavity, 
other soft tissues as well analyses of images from CT and 
other medical image sources.
