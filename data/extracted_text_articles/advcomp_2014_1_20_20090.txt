Abstract—In this work, we develop a splitting characteristic
method for solving multi-component atmospheric aerosol spatial
dynamics, which can efﬁciently evaluate aerosol spatial transports
by using large time step sizes. The method can compute the multi-
component aerosol distributions in high-dimensional domains
with large ranges of concentrations and for different aerosol
types. Numerical tests show the computational efﬁciency of the
proposed method. An actual simulation focusing on the sulfate
pollution is taken in the domain with a varying wind ﬁeld. We also
simulate multi-component aerosol transports in a large area in the
southeast of America. The developed algorithm can be applied
for the large scale predictions of multi-component aerosols in
multi-regions and multi-levels in atmospheric environment.

INTRODUCTION
Global climate change and warming in atmosphere have
been widely recognized. As one of most important con-
stituents, aerosols have a direct radiative forcing by scattering
and absorbing solar and infrared radiation in atmosphere, while
they have an indirect radiative forcing associated with the
changes in cloud properties by decreasing the precipitation
efﬁciency of warm clouds. In these processes, the physical
states including the gas and aerosol phases (i.e., gas, liquid and
solid) and the composition of aerosols including the aerosol-
associated water mass, and the multi-components of aerosols
are of great signiﬁcance. Numerical modeling has been playing
a key role in the study of aerosol processes and aerosol
concentration distributions in the atmospheric environment
prediction and the air quality control.
Aerosol transport model in atmosphere is a complex multi-
component system that involves several physical and chemical
processes, such as emission, transport, dispersion, aerosol
dynamics and aerosol chemistry processes. The studied area
usually covers a large region. Odman and Russell [12] studied
the URM model and the UAM-AIM model in the aerosol
simulation in the southern California. Grell et al. [5] developed
the WRF/Chem model and simulated the aerosol distributions
in the eastern United States and contiguous areas. Further
applications have been done to some areas in the Europe [11].
However, in these computations, very small time steps have
to be used in order to ensure the numerical stability of the
numerical schemes, which brings a huge cost of computation
and some limitation of applications. Therefore, it has been
an important task to develop efﬁcient numerical algorithm for
multi-component aerosol transports.
In this paper, we present our new development of the
efﬁcient splitting method for solving aerosol transports in
atmosphere. We consider general spatial aerosol transport
problems in atmosphere and develop the splitting characteristic
method for modeling multi-component aerosol transports. For
the spatial transport systems, we propose the characteristic
ﬁnite difference method to solve the transport process by
combining with the operator splitting technique to deal with
processes of emission, aerosol dynamics and chemical process.
The methods of characteristics to treat convection terms were
studied for high dimensional convection-diffusion problems in
porous media [1][2][4][9]. In this study, we take the important
advantages of both the characteristic method and the operator
splitting technique to solve the spatial aerosol transport dy-
namical system, which can be solved in parallel computation.
The developed method can efﬁciently compute the multi-
component aerosol transport dynamics in high-dimensional
domains with a large range of aerosol concentrations and for
different types of aerosols. Numerical tests show the computa-
tional efﬁciency of the proposed method for both the spatially
homogeneous aerosol dynamic problems and the spatial trans-
port aerosol dynamic problems. An actual simulation focusing
on the sulfate pollution is then taken in the domain with a
varying wind ﬁeld. Finally, a simulation of multi-component
aerosol transports in a large area in the southeast of America
is taken, which shows clearly that city areas usually have
high PM2.5 concentration and marine aerosols have affection
in marine and coast areas. The developed algorithm can be
applied for the large scale predictions of multi-component
aerosols in multi-regions and multi-levels in environment.
The paper is arranged as follows. The mathematical model
of multi-component aerosol dynamics is presented in Section
II. The splitting numerical method is proposed for the multi-
component aerosol transport equations in Section III. Numeri-
cal simulations are given in Section IV. Some conclusions are
addressed in Section V.

MULTI-COMPONENT AEROSOL DYNAMIC MODELS
The multi-component aerosol spatial transport models are:

where cl(⃗x, v, t) is the mass concentration of aerosol species

volume v; ⃗c = (c1, c2, · · · , cs); c0
l and cIN

are initial and
inﬂow boundary values. Ω is a three dimensional rectangle
computational domain, and the boundary of the domain is
partitioned into ∂Ω = ΓIN ∪ ΓOUT ∪ ΓGR ∪ ΓT OP , where
ΓIN denotes the inﬂow lateral boundary, ΓOUT denotes the
outﬂow lateral boundary, ΓGR is the ground level portion of the
boundary, and ΓT OP is the top level portion of the boundary.
⃗ν is the unit outward normal to the boundary ∂Ω. The volume
interval is [Vmin, Vmax]. At v = Vmin, the concentrations of
aerosols are zero. El,g is the rate of ground level emission of
the specie.

THE SPLITTING NUMERICAL SCHEME
Let ∆t be the splitting time step size, and tn = n∆t.
In a time interval (tn, tn+1], the splitting numerical scheme
for the multi-component aerosol spatial transport problems is
proposed as:
Step 1. From cn
l , the value at t = tn, solve the aerosol
emission process over (tn, tn+1]
∂cl
∂t
=
ElEmission(⃗x, v, t),
(7)
cl(⃗x, v, tn)
=
cn
l (⃗x, v) ⃗x ∈ Ω.
(8)
The emission rates of multi-component aerosol particles are
different due to differences in the emission characteristics of
emitted particles from a variety of natural and anthropogenic
sources. We can get the solution cn+1
l,emission of problem (7 )(8)
at t = tn+1.
Step 2. Solve the multi-component aerosol dynamic pro-
cess in (tn, tn+1] with cn+1
l,emission being the initial value at
t = tn.
∂cl
∂t
=
LAerosol(c1, c2, · · · , cs; ⃗x, v, t)
(9)
cl(⃗x, v, tn)
=
cn+1
l,emission(⃗x, v), l = 1, 2, · · · , s. (10)
The aerosol process includes the aerosol dynamic processes
(condensation, coagulation), and the aerosol chemical pro-
cess. Numerical methods, such as modal methods, sectional
methods, and wavelet methods ([10]), can be used to solve
the aerosol dynamic process. The aerosol chemical process
is described by aerosol thermodynamic equilibrium equations,
which can be solved ISORROPIA II ([7]) and the moving-cut
HDMR method ([3] [8]). Denote the solution by cn+1
l,aero.
Step 3. From cn+1
l,aero as the value at t = tn, the spatial
transport process is solved in (tn, tn+1].
∂cl
∂t
=
−U · ∇cl + ∇ · (K∇cl),

El,g, ⃗x ∈ ΓGR,
(15)
cl(⃗x, v, tn)

(16)
We propose a characteristic method to solve systems (11)-(16)
in this step. Finally, the solution cn+1

is obtained at t = tn+1.

NUMERICAL SIMULATION
We now give numerical simulations of the spatially ho-
mogeneous aerosol dynamics and the multi-component atmo-
spheric aerosol spatial transport dynamics.
Example 1.
We consider the spatially homogeneous three-component
aerosol dynamics of aerosol water, black carbon and sulfate
components. The initial values are tri-modal log-normal distri-
butions. The spatially homogeneous three-component aerosol
dynamic equations are

where t > 0 is the time, and T > 0 is the time period; the
ﬁnite mass interval I = [Mmin, Mmax] where Mmin > 0 is
the minimal mass and Mmax > 0 is a ﬁnite maximal mass.
β(m, m′) is the coagulation kernel function. ηi(m, t) is the
growth rate of species i, η(m, t) = P3
i=1 ηi(m, t). ci(m, t)
is the mass concentration of aerosol species i and c(m, t) =
P3
i=1 ci(m, t). Eq. (17) forms a system of nonlinear integral-
differential equations on time and particle mass m.

as 1800s for the characteristic ﬁnite difference method, and
the time step of the aerosol process step is used as 120s in the
system.
Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show the averaged ground-level concen-
trations of PM2.5 total mass, nitrate, ammonium, chloride (µg
m−3). We can see that, nitrate accounts for a large portion
of the PM2.5 total mass in the predicted domain, and PM2.5
nitrate, ammonium generally have high concentrations near
cities. For instance, the area near Atlanta (84.39◦W, 33.67◦N)
has the highest predicted concentrations of PM2.5 nitrate and
ammonium, and total mass with over 7 µg m−3, 3 µg m−3,
and 22 µg m−3, respectively. Marine aerosol of chloride only
exists in the marine and coast area,which is 0.03 to 0.14 µg
m−3 for chloride from the coast to the open sea.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we developed a characteristic method,
combining with the splitting technique, for multi-component
aerosol spatial transports which involve several physical and
chemical processes of advection, dispersion, emission, deposi-
tion and aerosol dynamic processes. The developed algorithm
is robust, efﬁcient, and highly accurate for the spatially ho-
mogeneous aerosol dynamics and the spatial multi-component
aerosol transports, in which large time steps can be used in
simulation. A simulation of multi-component aerosol trans-
ports over an area in the northeast America was further done
by the algorithm. The 72-hour simulation results at the New
York, a rural area and a marine area show that the PM2.5
has the highest concentration among the three areas, while the
marine area has the lowest. The major species of aerosols in

the New York and rural areas are sulfate, nitrate and ammonia,
while chloride and sodium make the most portion of the marine
aerosol. The results also exhibited that the nitrate concentration
varies inversely with the temperature. The comparisons of
simulation results with and without dry deposition provided the
fact that dry deposition makes great contribution to the aerosol
decrease, and has more inﬂuence to larger particles. Finally,
a real life multi-component aerosol transport simulation was
carried out over a large area in the southeast of America,
which showed that, city areas usually have high concentration
of PM2.5, and marine aerosols only have affection of marine
and coast areas. The developed algorithm can be applied
to efﬁciently simulate multi-component atmospheric aerosol
spatial transports in large domains.
