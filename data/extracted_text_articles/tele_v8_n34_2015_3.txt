Abstract—The trend for future communication systems is the 
efficient sharing of frequency bands on one hand (Cognitive 
Radio) and the emergence of satellite/terrestrial integrated 
systems, which is a topic of interest in 5G research process, on 
the other hand. All this is in order to optimize the management 
of the spectrum. Single-Carrier Frequency Division Multiple 
Access (SC-FDMA) is well suited waveform for satellite link 
thanks to its low Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) level. 
Its Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) 
based transmitter architecture, allowing a granular frequency 
access, reinforces its ability to perform well in shared spectrum 
context. More generally, SC-FDMA waveform seems to be a 
good candidate for both fixed-mobile convergence and 
satellite-terrestrial 
hybridization. 
This 
article 
aims 
to 
demonstrate two main points. Firstly, it will be proved that SC-
FDMA waveform, even with holes enabling a dynamic use of 
the spectrum, is well suited to cope with satellite payload 
impairments, 
such 
as 
nonlinear 
amplifier 
and 
Input 
Multiplexer. Secondly, it will be assessed that doing frequency 
holes does not degrade so much air interface performance by 
using surboost of remaining carriers. As a whole, in this paper, 
the relevance of SC-FDMA in a shared spectrum context is 
demonstrated.

 INTRODUCTION 
 
Preliminary study results on insertion of frequency holes 
in Single-Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-
FDMA) waveform for a satellite system have been published 
in [1]. Complementary results are presented here. 
Multi-carrier waveform is not historical waveform used 
on satellites. But, as European Union is promoting through 
incoming 5G integration of satellite and terrestrial 
components, paradigm is currently being modified [2]. 
Indeed, to make easier spectrum scalability, satellite should 
be able to choose sub-bands it uses depending on existing 
terrestrial systems. Moreover, in the case of integrated 
systems specifically, to encourage mass market terminal 
deployment, terminal should be able to receive the satellite 
signal or terrestrial one with the same chipset. This 
emphasizes the need for satellite to use a multi-carrier 
granular access, as it is already the case in terrestrial systems. 
The high crest factor of OFDM does not allow optimizing 
the efficiency of satellite amplifiers. An intermediate 
solution is the use of SC-FDMA. On forward link, its interest 
has already been demonstrated in the Digital Video 
Broadcasting (DVB) - Next Generation broadcasting system 
to Handheld (NGH) standardization process in S-band 
mobile system [3]. This waveform is also recommended in 
an International Telecommunication Union (ITU) working 
group for satellite International Mobile Telecommunications-
Advanced (IMT-Advanced) systems [4]. More recently, 
interest 
of 
this 
waveform 
raised

standardization process applicable to high frequency bands 
(Ku, Ka), especially for broadband systems.  
In Section II, a brief state of the art is presented. In 
Section III, the considered scenarios are described. In 
Section IV, description of SC-FDMA waveform enabling 
frequency holes is done. Methodology used to analyze 
obtained results is introduced, with first simulation results. In 
Section V, performances with satellite payload impairments 
are discussed. In Section VI, impact of surboost on the air 
interface is studied before giving further work horizon in 
Section VII.  
 
II. 
BRIEF STATE OF THE ART 
 
In terrestrial context, a variant of OFDM known as non-
contiguous OFDM (NC-OFDM) has been proposed for 
Cognitive Radio networks [5]. It allows the transmission of 
information in presence of primary users, by deactivating the 
subcarriers already occupied to avoid interferences. Efficient 
implementation of NC-OFDM transceiver has been 
proposed. It is based on an FFT pruning algorithm, which 
allows reducing the execution time [6]. Nevertheless, one 
major drawback of OFDM is its high Peak-to-Average 
Power Ratio (PAPR). SC-FDMA waveform allows reducing 
this PAPR, while still having the properties of frequency 
agility. Previous studies have demonstrated that Non-

Contiguous (NC) SC-FDMA can generally achieve better 
performance than NC-OFDM [1][7]. Some issues appears in 
the literature relative to the  employment of non-contiguous 
multicarrier-modulation-based data transmission systems, 
like out of band interference, power amplification, 
synchronization, implementation complexity [8][9], but 
always in a terrestrial context. 
In this paper, satellite scenarios and channels are 
considered: effects of satellite payload on NC-SC-FDMA are 
studied, as well as a mean to compensate loss of bandwidth 
by using power of unused subcarriers. 
 
III. 
CONSIDERED SCENARIOS 
 
Two main application cases have an interest. On the one 
hand, an integrated system example (the spectrum of the 
terrestrial and satellite components is managed by the same 
company) is given in Figure 1. It provides a service to 
nomadic or mobile devices. To optimize the spectrum usage 
according to the traffic, the scheduler decides if a part of the 
band is allocated to either satellite component or terrestrial 
one. On the other hand, a satellite system use frequency 
bands allocated to terrestrial systems provided it does not 
cause harmful interference. To enable good reception of 
satellite signal by satellite terminals, system operator may 
decide to null signal in the band where a certain amount of 
terminals are jammed, as it is depicted on Figure 2.  
 
IV. 
SC-FDMA WAVEFORM MODELISATION WITH 
FREQUENCY HOLES 
 
Firstly, the SC-FDMA modeling is described and 
waveform power fluctuations properties are analyzed. Then 
we explain how to insert frequency holes. The model of 
interference used is described. We present a method to 
compare the waveforms and finally, reference simulations 
are showed. 
 
A. Basic SC-FDMA modeling 
 
Because there have been several studies on SC-FDMA 
waveform, model will not be strictly detailed [10][11]. 
However, differences with OFDMA transceiver architecture 
will be emphasized. General SC-FDMA transceiver is 
summarized in Figure 3, and is described hereafter. 
Firstly, interleaved and coded bits bn are mapped into 
symbols ci, i ∈ [0, … , 𝑀 − 1]. Spreading operation, specific 
to SC-FDMA transmission, is then done by applying an M–
Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to the ci symbols to get Ck 
symbols, k ∈ [−

Figure 4.  Extension and weighting process. 
In the case of EW-SC-FDMA, as it can be seen in Figure 
4, some of the edge Ck symbols are duplicated and put at the 
opposite side edge in the guard band. Main sizing parameter 
here is α, called the roll off factor. Extension process outputs 
M’ (equals to (1+α)M) complex symbols Ck’. Weighting 
process is finally applied over these subcarriers in order to 
have a square root raised cosine shaping [10]. It multiplies 
term by term HSRC(k’) with Ck’ to get Sk’.  
Note that HSRC(k’), 𝑘′ ∈ [−
𝑀′
2 ; +
𝑀′
2 − 1], is the frequency 
response of the square root raised cosine filter, given by: 
𝐻𝑆𝑅𝐶(𝑘′)
=
{
  
  1,                                                                                   0 ≤ |𝑘′| <

𝑀  . 

 
 
It can be pointed out that when α equals to 0, process is 
strictly equivalent to SC-FDMA process. Next, unused 
subcarriers in the guard band are filled by zero, exactly N - 
(1+α)M, to get a vector owning N complex symbols, Sk’’. 
Note that to be compliant with OFDMA process, N should be 
a power of 2, which is not the case for M. Lastly, OFDMA 
modulation process can be done by applying an N-Inverse 
Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) and inserting guard interval, 
getting baseband signal sn.  
For receiver considerations, the equalization should use 
a Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) frequency domain 
algorithm, working subcarrier by subcarrier [10][11]. 
Applied to SC-FDMA waveform (left hand side formula) 
and EW-SC-FDMA waveform (right hand side formula), 
estimated symbol  𝑥𝑘
̂ is expressed hereafter:  
 
 
 

 
ℎ̂𝑘(+𝑀) are channel estimates in the useful bandwidth (M 
equals to 0) or extended bandwidth (M greater than 0). 
𝑦𝑘(+𝑀)  are received complex symbols after OFDM FFT 
matched filter. 𝜎̂² is the noise power estimate in a subcarrier 
bandwidth, that is to say Rs divided by the size of OFDM 
FFT, where Rs is I/Q sampling frequency.  
 Furthermore, a slightly difference that can be observed 
with SC-FDMA receiver compared to OFDMA one, is the 
way to compute the Log Likelihood Ratio (LLR) metrics at 
the demapping symbols step. Classic LLR formulation is 
reminded here: 
𝐿𝐿𝑅(𝑏𝑖) = 𝑙𝑛

where x = Ix + jQx is a symbol of the Quadrature amplitude

and Q are the in phase and quadrature components of the 
received signal after OFDM FFT process, I/Q is the fading 
on the I or Q component, 2² is the Additive White Gaussian 
Noise (AWGN) variance, Ix and Qx denote the reference 
symbols of the QAM constellation. In SC-FDMA receiver, 
because of the despreading process, i.e., there is a M points 
Inverse-DFT between equalization and demapping process, it 
is assumed that I/Q  can be approximated to the root mean 
square of the frequency channel response of the 
corresponding OFDMA symbol over the active subcarriers

B. Waveform power fluctuations properties 
 
Because dealing with non-linearity effects, the study of 
envelope fluctuations for each waveform may help to 
understand further results. This is why complementary 
cumulated density function for instantaneous power is given 
for each studied waveform in Figure 5. As it can be found in 
literature, SC-FDMA waveform performs better than 
OFDMA one. Using extension can help to better decrease 
fluctuations. However, one shall note that this comparison is 
considering waveforms without frequency holes insertion.

C. Frequency holes insertion 
Frequency holes are inserted inside useful signal at the 
spreading process level. In fact, spreading applies a L<M 
DFT over the incoming ci symbols before filling M-L other 
symbols with zero, as it is drawn in Figure 6. Some 
vocabulary is necessary to define where frequency hole is 
located. β is defined as the relative bandwidth occupied by 
frequency 
holes 
over 
maximum 
achievable 
useful 
bandwidth: 
        
β = 
𝑀−𝐿
𝑀 . 
(6) 
                          
Δ is the relative shift of the frequency hole center relatively 
to the bandwidth center. To clarify these notations, an 
example is given in Figure 7. 
D. Interference model 
The interferer location is defined as it is done for the 
frequency holes, with β and Δ parameters. Generative model 
is quite simple: complex symbols are generated according to 
a normal law   𝒩(0; 𝛽), supposing power of the useful signal 
as unitary power when occupying all possible subcarriers. 
Interference symbols are applied to subcarriers as if it was an 
OFDMA signal. When frequency holes are defined, 
interferences are added exactly at the holes location.

E. Comparative method analysis 
We are about to compare different waveforms enabling 
creation of a frequency hole inside their spectrum. Here is 
proposed a method to compare waveforms, considering 
power loss, signal quality loss, and Carrier over 
Intermodulation ratio. Power loss corresponds to OBO value, 
and Signal quality loss equals to the performance gap 
considering non-linearity sub-block or not. Total loss metric 
is then defined as (all the quantities are in dB): 
 
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 = 𝑆𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 + 𝑃𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 
 
{  
𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 = |𝑂𝐵𝑂|                                                       
𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 = 𝐶′ + 𝐼𝑚
𝑁
𝐵𝐸𝑅=10−5 − 𝐶
𝑁𝐵𝐸𝑅=10−5 
(7) 
 
where  
𝐶
𝑁
 
 BER=10−5 is the required signal to noise ratio in dB 
with ideal amplifier response at the bit error rate (BER) of  
10-5, and 
C′+Im
N
BER=10−5  is the required amplified signal 
power (pure signal plus intermodulated part) to noise ratio in 
dB at BER 10-5. Both metrics are given at the receiver input 
location (see Figure 8). Assuming that Im has a Gaussian 
behavior, pure Signal to Intermodulation power ratio 
(
C′
Im) can be derived (linear form): 
 
(𝐶′
𝐼𝑚
) =
1 + (𝐶′ + 𝐼𝑚
𝑁
)
𝐵𝐸𝑅=10−5
(𝐶
𝑁)
𝐵𝐸𝑅=10−5
−1
∗ (𝐶′ + 𝐼𝑚
𝑁
)
𝐵𝐸𝑅=10−5
−1
− 1
 
(8) 
 
Signal to Intermodulation power ratio is an important 
criterion according to satellite operators, because it 
demonstrates the ability of the payload to work with any 
spectral efficiency. Indeed, a low (
C′
Im) ratio results in 
degradation of total  (
C
𝑁+𝐼)  ratio, and then limitation of 
spectral efficiency. As a result, performances of the 
waveforms will be compared at equal (
C′
Im ) ratio. It shall be 
pointed out that for a same spectral efficiency, (
C′
Im )  is 
directly linked to the signal quality loss considering (7) and 
(8). Thus, judicious representation may be, for each 
waveform, required |OBO| to get BER = 10-5 vs (
C′
Im ) 
representation.

F. Reference simulations 
 
The simulations are performed by using a DVB-NGH 
like transceiver chain [1]. DVB-NGH specifications enable 
SC-FDMA utilization without extension and weighting 
functionality. Besides, frequency hole, IMUX filtering, on-
board nonlinear amplifier and interferences had to be 
considered as it is depicted in Figure 9. A significant 
importance should be given to the way how signal to noise 
ratios are computed when dealing with frequency holes. As 
power at output of the amplifier is unitary in simulations, it 
was chosen to decrease signal power with the same 
bandwidth reduction ratio. It enables comparing results at 
the same Es/N0. This decrease of signal power will be 
cancelled for simulations demonstrating of the surboosting 
effect benefits. Lastly, the simulation parameters are 
summarized in Table I.  
 
V. 
STUDY OF SATELLITE PAYLOAD IMPAIRMENTS 
 
Satellite payload impairments models usually include 
three main origins: nonlinear amplifier, selective input filters 
and phase noise. 
For the current work, non-linearity effects and input 
filtering effects are considered separately. Phase noise is not 
considered because it is well known that effect is very weak 
over a Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) modulation 
combined with current stability specifications over satellite 
local oscillators.  
 
 
Figure 9. Simulation Chain, including SC-FDMA, frequency hole, 
interference and non linearity functionalities. 
 
Input filters distortion may have an effect over the 
performances, but as the three studied waveforms (OFDMA, 
SC-FDMA, EW-SC-FDMA) have a subcarrier equalization 
process, it can be expected that the effect will be quite close 
in all cases, while not negligible. This is the reason why it 
was decided to focus on non-linearity effects, knowing there 
are envelope fluctuations differences between waveforms.  
In the simulation tool, IMUX filtering is first applied to 
the baseband signal, before being processed by the nonlinear 
conversion. Signal passed through satellite amplifier, having 
a unitary power, is applied to propagation channel block, as 
it is shown in Figure 10.

A. Nonlinear amplifier 
 
A typical model is chosen, called Mobile Television 
(MTV) model, giving Output Back Off (OBO) [dB] as a 
function of Input Back Off (IBO) [dB]. This model was 
chosen because it seemed to be quite realistic. Another 
model has been considered, NGH model, because it was 
used in DVB-NGH standardization process. As it seemed to 
be less realistic (especially phase characterization), it has 
not been used as a baseline. See on Figure 11 the non-
linearity conversion curves of these amplifiers. 
As a reference, BER simulations have been performed 
according to the method described previously. For a wide 
range of C/Im, it appears in Figure 12 that SC-FDMA like 
waveforms outperform OFDMA in terms of OBO vs C/Im, 
with a gap increasing when C/Im is growing.  
These results emphasize the fact that when no interferer 
is present, SC-FDMA is a good choice to be compatible 
with terrestrial multi-carrier legacy and to enjoy efficient 
use of satellite payload. For these reference simulations, the 
results with NGH amplifier have also been considered (see 
Figure 13). Conclusions about the interest of SC-FDMA are 
the same as with MTV amplifier, but with worse 
performances in required OBO at low C/Im. 
 
 
 
Figure 11. Non linearity conversion curves of MTV and NGH amplifiers. 
 
Figure 12. Comparison of waveforms in terms of OBO vs C/Im when no 
frequency holes are inserted and without interference, for MTV amplifier. 
 
Here, frequency hole was inserted with default 
parameters (Δ=0 and β=33%). Especially for single carrier 
waveforms, inserting such wide hole inside useful bandwidth 
may modify its fluctuations behavior. But, as it is depicted in 
Figure 14, single carrier waveforms performances are not so 
much degraded by the hole insertion, and remain quite 
competitive compared to OFDM, despite the large width of 
the hole. About OFDM results, it can be pointed out that 
results with and without frequency hole are quite similar. 
This can be explained by the multi-carrier effect of OFDM: 
multicarrier signal split in two parts remains a multi-carrier 
signal. This is the reason why in the following, only SC-
FDMA waveform will be considered. 
The influence of hole size was studied for SC-FDMA 
modulation (see Figure 15). It can be noted that for all hole 
sizes, between 2 and 50% width, a degradation of 0.5 dB on 
average has been observed.

Figure 15.  SC-FDMA performances in terms of OBO vs C/Im with one 
frequency hole. 
 
Figure 16.  SC-FDMA performances in terms of OBO vs C/Im with 3 
frequency holes. 
For integrated systems or satellite systems, which share 
frequency bands or have to deal with jammers, it could 
happen that several holes would be needed to avoid 
interference effects. Therefore, simulations have been 
performed with 3 holes, centered in Δ = [- 27%, 0%, +27%]. 
Results can be seen in Figure 16, where percentile value 
means the total width of the frequency holes relatively to the 
useful bandwidth. Two sets of curves can be observed; first 
pack, closer than without hole performance curve, shows 
around 0.5 dB OBO degradation compared to without hole. 
This degradation is almost the same as single hole 
performance 
for 
SC-FDMA. 
For 
3 
holes, 
some 
combinations of width and holes positions make appear an 
additional degradation. Indeed, intermodulation power 
spectrum density is not similar to white Gaussian noise, 
which is frequency flat. Therefore, when useful signal is in 
front of intermodulation peak, it brings a bit more 
degradation.  
B. Input Multiplexer 
 
Input Multiplexer (IMUX) filter templates are given in 
Figure 17. Two filters are considered for the study, having a 
different cut-off frequency: first one has its 3 dB cutting-off 
frequency at 0.42 sampling frequency, where the second one 
is cutting-off at 0.5 sampling frequency. Both filters have a 
group delay greater than 800 ns, corresponding to more than 
thirteen times the I/Q symbol duration (see Table I).  
In a satellite payload, IMUX filter is designed to split 
different incoming channels before amplifying them 
separately or by group. Because it is very important to filter 
noise and adjacent channels contribution, IMUX filters are 
usually designed with a margin on the channel bandwidth, 
in order to ensure that signal is not decreased at band edges, 
and to prevent group delay interferences effects at band 
edges also. This is the reason why two filters are considered 
for the simulations: aim is to demonstrate that SC-FDMA 
waveform enables extending signal bandwidth up to filters 
shoulders without losses, thanks to cyclic prefix adding up 
signal replicas.  
As it is written in Table I, number of active OFDM 
subcarriers is 426, whereas OFDM FFT size is 512. It brings 
that occupied bandwidth relatively to I/Q symbol rate Rs is 
0.84. That is to say signal is located between +/- 0.42 Rs. 
Thus, when using 0_5 filter as an IMUX, only group delay 
may have an impact on performances because filter has very 
weak fluctuations in the useful frequency band. Besides, 
using 0_42 filter, band edges of the signal are faded by the 
filter, so that it would be expected an additional degradation.

In this case study, simulations have been performed with 
and without real channel estimation, in order to assess real 
impact of IMUX filtering on receiver performances (see 
Figure 18). Results in QPSK ½ show that with perfect 
channel estimation, both filters have no impact over 
performances, whereas there is 0.1 dB degradation in real 
channel estimation, with respect to no IMUX insertion. This 
result demonstrates that multicarrier waveform helps filling 
at its best available bandwidth.  
 
C. Effects of interferences 
 
Interferences are inserted with Δ=0 and β=33% 
parameters. In addition, NGH amplifier was used for these 
simulations. Modulation and coding scheme is QPSK ½. I0, 
the power spectrum density of interferer is the same as C0, 
the power spectrum density of the signal.  
That leads to relatively weak level of interferers but with 
quite large bandwidth (1/3 of achievable useful bandwidth). 
With no real surprise, it is first checked that inserting hole in 
any of the three frequency granular access waveforms 
results in a negligible degradation (see Figures 19, 20 and 
21), because only secondary lobes of interferences are 
captured by active useful subcarriers when frequency hole is 
inserted.

Besides, no creating hole when interferer is present is 
showing quite degraded results, even if the interferer has a 
weak level. Reader shall point out that weak interferer was 
chosen to visualize the degradation on the same curve. But, 
from a system point of view, power spectrum density of a 
terrestrial interferer would be greater than satellite useful 
signal one, and would emphasize the need for such 
frequency hole in the waveform. 
 
VI. 
IMPACT OF SURBOOST ON PERFORMANCES 
 
For this case study, satellite amplifier is providing 
constant power, whether or not frequency holes are present. 
Therefore, when a frequency band is unused, delivered 
power spreads in remaining useful sub-carriers. It creates a 
surboost of ratio η compared to baseline transmission:  
 
η = 
BWN
BWN − BWH
, 
(9) 
                                                             
BWN is the useful nominal bandwidth, BWH is the bandwidth 
corresponding to frequency hole.  
The aim of this section is to demonstrate that surboost 
can compensate, from a bit rate point of view, useful 
bandwidth decrease by increasing spectral efficiency of the 
transmission. The steps of the process are given below.  
First, for different couples of modulation and coding 
schemes (MODCOD), compute frequency hole width in 
order to compensate, on a linear channel with a surboost η, 
required ES/N0 rising due to the changing of MODCOD (see 
Table II) [12]. Secondly, considering 3 frequency holes, 
searching OBO working point to reach OBO near from 17 
dB, for both MODCOD of a couple. Lastly, compare for 
both MODCOD required Es/N0 and associated bit rate. 
Results are presented in Figure 22. The bit rate is 
computed considering MODCOD efficiency and overhead 
item such as pilot and frame building insertion, guard 
interval and a useful bandwidth of 14.2 MHz, according to 
Table I parameters [3].

two MODCOD couples. 
 
Full line curves show that for linear channel, frequency 
hole width has been correctly chosen to balance ES/N0 
requirement difference between two MODCOD. In dotted 
line, the same simulations over non-linear channel are 
performed. Lastly, physical layer input bit rate for two 
MODCOD show that the loss of bandwidth is worse than 
the loss of the bit rate thanks to the spectral efficiency 
increase. 
 
VII. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
 
At a time where, on one hand, there is a need to make 
easier spectrum scalability and on the other hand, 
manufacturers are working to maximize the payload 
efficiency, a SC-FDMA based solution was introduced to 
address this issue. In this paper, it has been shown that SC-
FDMA waveform fluctuations enable using satellite payload 
in an efficient way, and that creating frequency hole do not 
degrade so much air interface performances; SC-FDMA 
waveform remains in all cases relevant compared to 
OFDMA. Thus, using this waveform would take advantage 
of both frequency scalability and payload efficiency, while 
offering a solution at physical layer level for dynamic 
spectral resource sharing systems.  
For further work, others topics should be processed. 
Standard modification impact of the introduction of 
frequency holes in the signal appears to be the first subject. 
Next, an accurate modeling of interferer would help to 
prove that frequency holes are enough to avoid interference 
effects. More generally, a cooperation with a satellite 
system manufacturer would be needed to assess the impact 
of using SC-FDMA at onboard level (amplifiers working 
point, signal routing) and ground level (terminal design, 
resource access methods).
