Abstract—Trafﬁc control, accidents prevention, vehicles au-
tomation and useful services to the drivers have always been goals
of an intelligent trafﬁc system. With this objective, the IEEE is
ﬁnalizing its new standard: the IEEE 802.11p, which deﬁnes the
vehicular ad-hoc networks physical and medium access control
layers characteristics. This paper presents simulations to evaluate
the performance of these networks operating according to the
new standard, at different scenarios, using the most recent
version of the well-known network simulator NS-2. The results
show that the transmissions quality impact is directly linked to
dynamic changes in the network topology.
Keywords—IEEE 802.11p; Vehicular Networks; NS-2.34.
I. INTRODUCTION
Big cities all over the world are suffering, or can suffer in the
near future, with the uncontrolled growth of their road systems,
making the search for solutions that lead to this improvement
becomes a challenge [1], [2], [3]. Linked to this, there is a
lack of trafﬁc information to drivers, what prevents them to
make decisions that could avoid trafﬁc jams. In this scenario,
the concept of intelligent transportation system (ITS) was
created, where essential data are exchanged by the vehicles,
such as: track and weather conditions, levels of trafﬁc jams
and accidents emergency announcements. These and other
measures would be relevant to the planning of routes and
safety of drivers and pedestrians [3], [4], [5], [6].
From this situation came the necessity for the criation
of vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETS), which are able to
supply the demand for inter-vehicle communications (IVC)
and road-to-vehicle communications (RVC). Such technology
is getting lots of attention by both the automotive industry and
world research centers [4], [7].
To VANETS’s standardization, the IEEE is ﬁnalizing a
new standard: the IEEE 802.11p, which deﬁnes the rules for
wireless access in vehicular environment (WAVE) [3], [8], [9],
[10]. The new model comes as an alternative to the currents
wi-ﬁ standards, being developed to support the vehicular
networks features, where the main difﬁculty is keeping the
transmission rates due to the network topology dynamism and
nodes high speed, besides low latency in security applications
[3], [6].
As this proposed standard is not ﬁnished, computer sim-
ulations to evaluate its performance are very important to
both researchers and industry, being the focus of this work.
With this target, experiments were performed using the net-
work simulator NS-2.34, applying the IEEE 802.11p support,
where it was observed two main performance parameters of
VANETS: packets delay and data throughput.
Some related works can be highlighted, such as [11], [12],
[13]; however, in all of this works, the simulations was
performed using old NS-2 versions and different VANETS
implementations, developed by each one of these authors. This
work uses the newer NS-2 version and its native VANETS
modules, developed by [14], being different from the latter by
the analyzed metrics: packets delay and data throughput.
The paper is organized as follows. First, Section II describes
the IEEE 802.11p physical and medium access control layers
characteristics. Continuing, Section III describes the IEEE
802.11p implementation in NS-2.34. Then, Section IV presents
experiments and results of vehicular networks simulations,
using NS-2.34, at different scenarios. Finally, Section V shows
the work ﬁnal considerations and conclusions.
II. IEEE 802.11P STANDARD
Due to studies, none of the currents wireless standards
are completely adapted to VANETS [6]. So, the IEEE is
developing a new standard in order to follow vehicle networks
requirements with safety and quality, ensuring data transmis-
sion in unstable networks. The IEEE 802.11p, with its drafts,
deﬁnes the operation mode settings of VANETS’s physical and
medium access control (MAC) layers [3], [8], [9], [10].
The goal of this new proposal is to ensure robust and quality
communications when dealing with networks whose nodes
have high mobility and fast topology changes, beyond the
necessity of low latency and immunity to interference. The
IEEE 802.11p deﬁnitions are described in Subsections II-A
and II-B.

A. Physical Layer
The IEEE 802.11p physical layer implementation speciﬁes
the use of dedicated short range communications (DSRC),
deﬁned by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
[11].
The DSRC technology operates at a 75 MHz bandwidth,
positioned in the spectrum range of 5.9 GHz. These 75 MHz
are divided in seven 10 MHZ channels each, being the center
channel the control channel and the rest of the channels the
service channels [4], [11], [12], as illustrated in Fig. 1.

DSRC spectrum.
Different channels can not be used simultaneously, thus,
each station can make the constant change between the control
channel and the service channels. To ensure the requirement of
low delay, especially when safety data are sent, the changing
time can not be higher than 100 ms [4].
During transmissions, signals are sent using orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique, which
divides each channel in several sub-carriers spaced by 0.15625
MHz from each other [3].
To illustrate the differences, Table I compares the IEEE
802.11p and IEEE 802.11a physical layer main parameters.
B. MAC Layer
The MAC layer functions match to the IEEE 802.11e
standard, enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA), which
adds quality of service to IEEE 802.11 networks. Messages
are categorized into four different ACs (AC0, AC1, AC2 and
AC3), where AC0 has the lowest priority and AC3 has the
highest priority [10].
When a particular message is selected, its contain pa-
rameters are sent to the transmitter. First the arbitrary inter
frame space (AIFS), previously set for each AC. As each
slot time is 16 µs, the AIFS time is equal to AIFS x 16 µs.

Subsequently is calculated the contention window (CW) time.
This is performed by a random value between 0 and CWmin.
If there is any collision, the window time is recalculated by
2(CW + 1) − 1, and a new attempt is done. The operation is
repeated until the maximum window size (CWmax) is reached
or the packet is sent successfully [4], [10].
The control and service channels contain parameters are
shown in Tables II and III, respectively.
III. VANETS SIMULATION SUPPORT
VANETS performance evaluation is being studied by several
researchers, [4], [5], [11], [12], and are very important for
automotive industry. Although testbeds are still limited, due
to the fact that IEEE 802.11p is not ﬁnished, computer simu-
lations can be performed and its results used as a parameter
for possible vehicular networks improvements. In this scenario
we can highlight the use of NS-2.
NS-2 is a general purpose networks simulator developed
by Berkley University [15] and is currently at version 2.34.
VANETS support, however, was only developed in the last
two versions (2.33 and 2.34).
Its implementation is done by applying the IEEE 802.11p
physical and MAC layers features in the TCL simulation
code, deﬁned by two native modules: WirelessPhyExt and
MAC80211-Ext.
Table IV shows the deﬁnitions of some vehicular networks
key parameters in NS-2 TCL simulation code.
IV. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
Using NS-2.34 VANETS’s support, performance evaluation
experiments were realized.
However, it was necessary to check whether this implemen-
tations was sufﬁcient to obtain consistent results because, as
described in Section III, the NS-2 IEEE 802.11p modules were
recently developed, being found only in the two latest versions
of the simulator.
So, foremost, an IEEE 802.11a and IEEE 802.1p compari-
son scenario was simulated, where data throughput and packets
delay were veriﬁed. These experimental results, if consistent,
would enable a more secure analysis in a scenario imple-
mented only using IEEE 802.11p for VANETS simulations.

Then, a simple scenario containing two nodes (transmitter
and receiver) was deﬁned, with 100 m x 3000 m topology at
a 10 seconds simulation. The nodes movement was done in
opposite directions and in each simulation the speed of each
node was increased by 20 km/h. Fig. 2 illustrates the proposed
scenario.

IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 802.11a comparison scenario.
Starting at an initial speed of 40 km/h and increased by
20 km/h until the ﬁnal speed of 140 km/h, it was possible to
obtain the packets delay and the transmitted data throughput.
The results are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, respectively.
The graphs show clearly the best performance of IEEE
802.11p implementation compared to IEEE 802.11a.
Due to the increased power at the transmitter, [3], [8],
[9], [10], and being exposed to the same propagation model
(in this case the Nakagami model [13]), the IEEE 802.11p
achieved considerably greater data throughput, especially at
speeds below 80 km/h. Analyzing the delay, the NS-2 IEEE
802.11p implementation proved to be robust and promoted the
low latency support required in the standard, [3], [8], [9], [10],
resulting in average delays almost 3 times smaller than those
ones obtained using IEEE 802.11a.

With these results, which showed the effectiveness of the
NS-2.34 IEEE 802.11p implementation, a new series of exper-
iments was performed. In these tests were analyzed vehicular
networks performance at different scenarios using the same
two metrics: throughput and delay.
The scenarios were deﬁned according to three variables:
number of nodes (10, 30 or 50 nodes), nodes average speed
(70 km/h, 90 km/h and 110 km/h) and nodes average distance
(10 m, 30 m or 50 m), totalizing 27 different scenarios.
The experiments were performed by TCP transmissions
realized by two nodes located at the opposite sides of a road
with 100 m x 3000 m topology, using AODV routing protocol,
Nakagami propagation model (as this is the more accurate
to characterize vehicular networks communications [13]), and
the IEEE 802.11p physical and MAC layers implementations,
in 10 seconds simulations. Table V shows the parameters
deﬁnition in the TCL code used during the simulations, and
Fig. 5 illustrates the scenarios general arrangement.

Data throughput changing nodes average velocity.
The results showed that the data throughput is almost
invariant when the nodes average velocity remains relatively
constant in IVC transmissions. However, the nodes distance
inﬂuences the data throughput, being inversely proportional
to the same. Thus one can imagine the standard is well-
established for data transmissions on highways that allows this
type of situation, as the German Autobhans for example [16],
where cars can run at high speeds, forming blocks according
to the adopted velocity.
For urban scenarios transmissions, where nodes average
distance and average speed is constantly changing, although
not simulated, the standard suggests the use of ﬁxed infrastruc-
ture, applying RVC transmissions, in order to keep the data
throughput stable in most of the cases [3].
The second experiment used the same procedure as the ﬁrst,
this time analyzing the packets delay. The result is illustrated
in Fig. 7, where n is the number of nodes and d is the average
distance between them.

In this case, although some outliers, mainly for speeds above

was constant, conﬁrming the ﬁrst experiment results.
In the third experiment, the average speed of the nodes was
ﬁxed at 70 km/h; the impact on data throughput was veriﬁed
by changing the number of nodes and the average distance
between them. The result is illustrated in Fig. 8, where n is

case the data throughput rate in a transmission of two nodes
located in the opposite points of a road, with 30 intermediate
routing nodes between them, can reach 5 percent of the value
obtained in a two nodes direct transmission, as shown in the
results of Fig. 3.
Finally, to prove that the network topology change has a
greater impact on VANETS performance, was observed the
packets delay of a simulation where the nodes average speed
was ﬁxed in 90 km/h and was changed the number of nodes
and the average distance between them. Fig. 9 illustrates the
result, where n is the number of nodes.

V. CONCLUSION
Due to big cities road systems growth, a lot of attention
is directed to the development and performance of vehicular
networks, not only by manufacturers and researchers, but also
by governments and institutions responsible for maintenance
of these roads.
While IEEE does not ﬁnish the IEEE 802.11p standard,
which deﬁnes the VANETS physical layer and MAC layer
characteristics, real testbeds are still limited.
Therefore, computational experiments become the most
widely used tool for obtaining these performance parameters,
and their results can be used for possible changes in the new
standard speciﬁcations.
This paper described computer based simulations, using
NS-2.34, whose goal was to obtain the performance of two
major optimization parameters in VANETS, packets delay and
data throughput, for vehicular networks that implements direct
communication between the nodes, IVC.
The results showed that increasing vehicles average speeds
and keeping the average distance constant, for a given number
of nodes, the impact on delay and throughput was low. That
is, the standard provides good support for vehicles communi-
cations in scenarios such as highways, for example.
Furthermore, it was found that keeping the nodes average
speed, the impact on data throughput and packets delay is
given directly by the network topology, that is the number of
nodes and average distance between them, being a possible
limiting factor for the VANETS performance which adopts
only IVC transmissions.
