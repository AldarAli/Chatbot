Abstract— In order to lower car fuel consumption and increase 
communication capacity, a wireless harness communications 
system that uses metal coated plastic/rubber hose (radio hose) 
as the communications channel is proposed. Measurements 
results show that the proposed system reduces conventional 
harness weight to 1/10, and increase reliability even if the hose 
is cut and/or pinched.  This indicates a possibility for wireless 
communications systems to be adopted not as a soft safety 
system but a hard safety system for the first time.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Since the weight of wire harnesses in cars has been 
increasing due to increase of number of Electronic Control 
Unit (ECUs), there is strong need for “harness weight 
saving”. A typical wire harness weighs around 30 to 50 Kg 
and various weight saving approaches have been proposed 
[1]. Conventional wire harness communication systems use 
copper wires, to interconnect the many ECUs. Since the 
number of such units continues to increase with the rapid 
adoption of hybrid and electrical systems, conventional wire 
harness systems are becoming excessively complex and 
heavy. Another trend is the increase use of intra-car 
multimedia systems that demand high data rates. In “intra-
car communication systems”, there is not only front display 
for car navigation systems but also are many multimedia 
monitors for TV and movies.  In order to realize these 
applications, a high data rate communication channel is also 
required in vehicles [2-3]. Currently, USA automobile 
regulation requires tire pressure monitor. This has been done 
by using Bluetooth technology and it is so called “soft safety” 
application where some erroneous transmissions are allowed. 
Meanwhile, engine and brake control systems cannot allow 
erroneous transmission at all and use wired connections. 
They are called hard safety and not even short term 
disruption is permitted. This is naturally the only choice 
given by current technology. To meet these requirements, the 
“wireless harness communication system with radio hose” 
has been proposed. The proposed radio hose is a hybrid of 
wire and wireless communications. This system uses a “radio 
hose” which is lighter than conventional wire harnesses 
while offering the wide bandwidth needed for multimedia 
services, the robustness demanded by the control systems, 
and multiplexing transmissions by a single radio hose. The 
radio hose is made by thin metal coated low dielectric 
material, such as polyolefin whose weight is much lighter 
than wire harness. Since the proposed radio hose aims to 
replace the current wired harness, we name the radio hose 
system as “wireless harness”. The proposed system has high 
reliability since communication remains possible even if the 
hose is cut or pinched. Metal coated hose offers high 
immunity from electromagnetic interference as well. The 
proposed system offers light weight, wide bandwidth, and 
highly reliable wireless harness systems. Since conventional 
wired connects fail once a wire or connector fails, the 
proposed system offers higher communication reliability and 
well suits “hard safety” applications. The proposed system is 
assumed to use 5 and 60GHz unlicensed bands. Although all 
wireless transmissions are contained within the hose, there is 
no need to use unlicensed bands. We have selected these 
bands since relatively cheap transceivers are available for 5 
and 60GHz band applications. When transceiver physical 
size is considered, the 60GHz band is promising, while the 
5GHz band offers long range communications. In our 
previous work [1], the large radius hoses (25-40mm) were 
found to be suitable with low loss for wireless harness 
communication systems. In order to replace the current wired 
harness (with about 6.5 mm in diameter), however, this 
paper focuses on small radius hoses, such as 6.5 mm in 
diameter.  
This paper shows that the transmission loss of a 4m 
length hose is estimated 39.4dB, which is 40.6 dB lower than 
the loss of over-the –air transmission (80dB) [4] and a delay 
spread is as small as 0.2ns, which is small enough for 
effective communications without equalizers and no 
equalizers will contribute to realize low latency systems. 
Although this paper describes 3 Gbps transmission systems 
mostly, a variety of transmission rates, such as 1 Gbps or 
lower are possible supported by IEEE802.15.3c standard. 
We used the measured results to design the channel model 
and BER simulations of both control and entertainment 
signal transmission channels. The simulation results show 
BER penalty is less than 1dB with Forward Error Correction 
(FEC). Since these results show that there is no need to use 
Orthogonal 
frequency-division 
multiplexing 
(OFDM), 
essential if the delay spread is significant, the proposal offers 
high speed communication systems with single carrier links 
and simple equalizers. 
This paper is organized as follows. Section II describes 
the structure and basic performance of the proposed wireless 
harness communications system. Section III describes its 
reliability. 
Section 
IV 
describes 
multi 
channel 
communication performance. Section V summarizes our 
work on wireless harness communication systems.

II. 
WIRELESS HARNESS COMMNICATION SYSTEMS 
As shown in Figure 1, the model considered here consists 
of control systems to send control signals from sensors, and 
entertainment signal transmission systems. The central hub is 
assumed to be the car navigation system. For general 
vehicles, the maximum communication length is estimated to 
be 4m. Because 5GHz communication systems are suitable 
for big vehicles like trucks, this paper targets the 4m wireless 
harness performance since this will be the most common 
application.  
The wireless harness is a plastic hose with conductive 
coating. Our previous research examined a wireless harness 
with large radius (φ=40mm) and proved a possibility of low 
loss and highly reliable transmission over wireless harness. 
Given the severe space constraints of modern vehicles, 
40mm radius hose is not so practical and this paper examines 
radio hoses with smaller  radius.  
Figure 2 shows trial small radius wireless hose 
appearance and its cross section view. Its outside diameter is 
6.5mm and inside diameter is 6mm. The hose made of 
polyolefin has a relative permittivity of 2.3-2.4. As shown in 
Figure 3, its transmission loss is 16.5dB smaller than non-
coated hose. This shows that wireless harness is suitable for 
establishing practical communication channels. Table I 
compares the performance of this small radius hose with the 
performance of the large radius hose measured in previous 
work [1]. In table I, the delay spread is also improved by 
metal coating. As for the latency, we do expect much shorter 
than the current wired harness since the transmission rates of 
the proposed systems are 104 times faster than the current 
one, however, we need to wait for further detailed analysis. 
In order to clarify wireless harness communication 
capacity, we measured transmission losses and delay spreads 
of 1, 0.5, and 0.25m hoses. The measurement system is 
shown in Figure 4 and results are shown in Figure 5. The 
transmission loss is calculated by (1) 
 
Total transmission loss =  
Transmission loss constant x Hose length 
                      + Antenna conversion loss  x 2    (1) 
 
From (1) and Table II, the transmission constant is 8.2dB/m, 
antenna conversion loss is 3.3dB, and the estimated 
transmission loss is 39.4dB. By assuming the sensitivity of a 
3Gbps receiver is - 55dBm at 60GHz (typical sensitivity 
defined by IEEE802.11ad standard), and maximum 
transmission power is 10dBm (typical transmission power of 
Transmitter modules in unlicensed bands), the margin of the 
small radius wireless harness for 3Gbps communication is 
around 35dB. In IEEE 11ad standards, multiple 
communication speed is supported. The assumed systems are 
based on IEEE 802.11.ad standard which supports High 
(more than 3Gbps) and low (1Mbps) speed communication. 
In these standards, the communication is possible if the 
received signal level is higher than the receiver's sensitivity.
