Abstract—This paper presents a method for determining the
quality of a VoIP communication using intelligent learning tech-
niques. The proposed solution uses historical values of network
parameters and communication quality in order to train the
intelligent learning algorithms. After that, these algorithms are
able to ﬁnd the quality of the VoIP communication based
on network parameters of an speciﬁc period of time. The
intelligent learning algorithms take as input a baseline ﬁle that
contains some values of network parameters and voice coding,
associating an index quality for each scenario according to the
ITU-T Recommendation G.107. The tests were performed in an
emulated network environment, totally isolated and controlled
with real trafﬁc of voice and realistic IP network parameters.
The quality ratings obtained for the learning algorithms in all
scenarios were corroborated with the results of the algorithm of
ITU-T Recommendation P.862. The results show the reliability of
the three learning algorithms used on the tests: Decision Trees
(J.48), Neural Networks (Multilayer Perceptron) and Bayesian
Networks (Naives). The highest value of reliability in determining
the quality of the VoIP communications was 0.98 with the use of
Decision Trees Algorithm. These results demonstrate the validity
of the method proposed.

I. INTRODUCTION
The quality of a VoIP (Voice over IP) communication does
not have the quality levels of the conventional circuit-switched
telephony, thus, users who do not have an acceptable user
experience with VoIP calls continues using the traditional
telephony. For this reason, the study of methods for evaluating
quality of VoIP communication is very important because it
allows that network resources can be reallocated to improve
the communication quality.
Initially, determining the quality of a VoIP communication
was done by subjective tests, resulting in a quality score
called MOS (Mean Opinion Score), the ITU-T Recommen-
dation P.800 [1] describes the requirements and methodology
followed in these tests. After, some objective methods was per-
formed: such as ITU-T Recommendation P.862 [2] or PESQ
(Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality), which determines
an index named MOS-LQO MOS-Listening Quality Objective
which is the result of the comparison of the original voice
or reference signal and the degraded speech signal. Also,
nonintrusive methods were developed, such as the ITU-T P.563
[3], where the algorithms do not need a voice signal reference.
Other metrics of voice quality [4] - [6] do not consider the
voice signal, for determining the quality index are employed
models based on network parameters such as the E-Model
[23], used in network planning and to conﬁgure the rate of
communication VoIP MOS.
Machine Learning algorithms have been used to determine
the quality of multimedia services, thus trying to ensure a
better quality of service [7], [8]. For the case evaluation of
voice quality in VoIP service, the works [9] - [12] show
how neural networks are used for monitoring this service, but
are not studied other learning techniques and do not detail
how the training ﬁle used was built. The E-Model is not
sufﬁcient to predict the Quality Level, because sometimes a
parameter is missing and it is not possible to measure the
QoS with the E-Model, but with the machine learning if one
parameter is missing it is possible to measure the QoS. This
paper uses as a training ﬁle wich has been built based on
ITU-T Recommendation G.107, more knowledge as E-Model,
considering some network scenarios that have been extracted
from real trafﬁc and the results was achieved high levels of
reliability.
Algorithms used in this study come from different ap-
proaches in sub-area of artiﬁcial intelligence, devoted to the
study of learning by machines to predict the quality level
of a service, these algorithms are: Decision Tree (J48 -
C4.5 algorithm), Bayesian networks (Naive Bayes) and Neural
Networks (Multilayer Perceptron) to determine the quality of a
VoIP communication in a sample interval of 8 seconds; so, the
reliability of the speciﬁed algorithms on this application was
measured. Network training was performed using a ﬁle of 650
cases, which were prepared by the E-Model algorithm, each
line of the ﬁle contains the network parameters: transmission
rate, delay and probability of packet loss, and the value of
quality (MOS), which is the result of the E-Model algorithm.
This work considers the encoding rates of 64 kbps for ITU-
T G.711 [13] codec and rate of 8 kbps for ITU-T G.729 [14],
respectively, and also consider the intrinsic values that these
encoders have in the scenario with packet loss.
The tests were performed in a scenario of IP network
emulation, where it is established a VoIP communication
and is programmed different network parameters, in order
to study the quality degradation of voice communication for
each scenario tested. For purposes of network emulation, the

software named NETEM (Network Emulator) [20] was used,
where the parameters of packet loss probability and delays
point in an IP network can be changed. This article is divided
as follows:
Section 2, where it is made a theoretical revision of machine
learning algorithms used in this work; Section 3 deals with the
E-Model algorithm; Section 4 presents brieﬂy the PESQ algo-
rithm, Section 5 presents the test scenario, the methodology
followed on the tests and the parameters evaluated; Section
6 shows the results and discussions, and ﬁnally, Section 7
presents the conclusion and future work.
II. ALGORITHMS USED IN THE DETERMINATION
OF COMUNICATION QUALITY
This section is presenting the different algorithms used
in training of the network to determine the quality of VoIP
communications.
A. Decision Tree Classiﬁcation
Decision Trees [24] are tools that can be used for giving to
the agent the ability for both learning and making decisions.
The decision tree takes as input a situation described by a
set of attributes and returns a decision, which is predicted by
the value of the input attribute. The input can be both discrete
or continuous values. In this paper, only discrete values are
used. The learning of discrete values is called classiﬁcation.
B. Bayesian Classiﬁcation
The Bayesian classiﬁcation [25] algorithm has its name
because it is based on probability of Bayes’ Theorem. It is also
known as Na¨ıve Bayes classiﬁer or only Bayes algorithm. The
algorithm aims to calculate the probability that an unknown
sample belongs to each of the known classes. This type of
prediction is called the statistical classiﬁcation; it is completely
based on probabilities.
A feature of this algorithm is that it requires a data set
that is already classiﬁed previously. Based on this preliminary
data set, which is also called the training set, the algorithm
takes as input a new unknown, i.e., this has no classiﬁcation,
and returns as output the most likely class for this sample
according to probabilistic calculations.
C. Multilayer Perceptron
Rosenblatt [26] introduced the perceptron as the simpler
architecture of neural network capable of classifying linearly
separable patterns. The operation of a perceptron (artiﬁcial
neuron) shows that:
• The neuron is responsible for calculating the combination
of inputs and weights, and then applies an activation func-
tion that determines the effective output of the neuron.
• The training is done through the presentation of known
inputs and outputs (supervised learning) and adjusting the
weights with speciﬁc algorithms.
Multilayer Perceptron Networks (MLP) are computationally
more powerful than networks without hidden layers. The MLP
can handle data that are not linearly separable.
The processing performed by each neuron is deﬁned by the
combination of the processing performed by the previous layer
of neurons that are connected to it. From the ﬁrst hidden layer
to output layer, implemented functions become increasingly
complex. These functions deﬁne how the division is made of
space-making.
There are several algorithms to train the MLP networks.
Among these, the most popular learning algorithm for train-
ing these networks is the back propagation [27]. This is a
supervised algorithm that uses the desired output for each
input provided to adjust the parameters, called weights of the
network. In addition, the adjustment weights use the method
of backpropagation gradient to deﬁne the corrections to be
applied.
III. ITU-T G.107 RECOMENDATION
This recommendation, better known as E-Model [23], is a
computer model that measures the effects of the parameters
of a transmission signal and the transmitted voice quality. The
E-Model is deﬁned by the following equation:
R = Ro − Is − Id − Ie + A
(1)
where:
• R: determination factor of the transmission rate that has
a correspondence with the MOS score ITU-T P.800.
• Ro: ratio - signal to noise.
• Is: simultaneous degradation factor, which represents
all the degradations that occur simultaneously with the
speech signal.
• Id: quality degradation due to the delay.
• Ie: degradation of the quality by effect of the device
(encoder).
• A: improvement factor.
The default value of Ro is 93.2, which is obtained by
putting all the inputs of the model with their default values,
for example, the parameter of quality degradation due to delay
(Id), and the parameter corresponding to the degradation of
equipment, i.e., for this calculation.
The parameter is not considered in the calculations of this
work, since it describes conditions that are related to the signal,
not depending on the transport network.
The factor A has the value 0 [15] for cable networks and
is the scenario that matches the emulation of this work.
The delay factor Id is deﬁned by composition:
Id = Idle + Idte + Idd
(2)
The parameters Idte and Idle correspond to delays due
to echo, both the sender and receiver. These factors are
not considered for the test scenario to assume perfect echo
suppression.
The Idd represents the delay (Ta) produced in the encoder
and the network, including an echo cancellation. The network
43

ICDS 2013 : The Seventh International Conference on Digital Society

delay is set according to the type of test on the network
emulator.
The Idd is deﬁned as:
For Ta ≤ 100ms : Idd = Id = 0
For Ta > 100ms :
Idd = Id = 0.024d + 0.11(d − 177, 3)P(d − 177, 3)
(3)
with: P(k) = 0, if k < 0, P(k) = 1, if k ≥ 0
With these considerations, one can calculate the parameter
R as a function of the parameters that correspond to the value
of Ro, the delay (Id) and the factor corresponding to the
encoder (Ie).
R = Ro − Id − Ie
(4)
The R factor is related to the MOS index, according to the
following equation:
R = 3, 026 × M 3 − 25, 314 × M 2 + 87, 06 × M − 57, 336
(5)
IV. RECOMENDAC¸ ˜AO ITU-T P.862
The ITU-T Recommendation P.862 [16], known as PESQ
(Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality) is an objective
evaluation method that compares an original signal with a
degraded signal, resulting from the passage of the signal
through a communication system. The output is a PESQ
predicting the perception of quality that would be felt by
an individual in a subjective listening test. This prediction is
related to a score, called an index MOS (Mean Opinion Score),
and the methodology PESQ, this estimate is called LQO-MOS
(MOS-Listening Quality Objective) and scores ranging from
1 (poor) to 4.5 (excellent).
PESQ only measures the effects of one-way speech distor-
tion and noise on speech quality. The effects of delay, sidetone,
echo, and other impairments related to two-way interaction are
not reﬂected in the PESQ scores.
According to this recommendation, PESQ had demonstrated
acceptable accuracy on the following scenarios:
• Speech input levels to a codec.
• Transmission channel errors.
• Packet loss and packet loss concealment with CELP
codecs.
• Transcodings.
• Effect of varying delay in listening only tests.
• Short-term and long-term time warping of audio signal.
• Coding Technologies: Waveform codecs, e.g. G.711;
G.726; G.727; CELP and hybrid codecs .4 kbit/s,
e.g. G.728, G.729, G.723.1; Other codecs: GSM-FR,
GSMHR, GSM-EFR, GSM-AMR, CDMA-EVRC, TD-
MAACELP, TDMA-VSELP.
In the test scenario was used the codecs G.711 and G.729,
and the network suffer degradation due packet loss and delay,
the audio input was isolated to avoid voice impairments. Only
delay is not included on tested scenarios of recommendation
P.862. To be possible include this factor on test scenarios were
delay is present, it was converted the MOS index to R index
value using equation (5); this way, we obtained the quality
index in these type of scenarios.
V. SCENARIO AND TEST METHODOLOGY
The tests were conducted in emulation of IP network shown
in Figure 1, which consists of three computers, two of them
(PC-A and PC-C) establish VoIP communication point to
point, and the third (PC-B) emulates the transmission channel,
which are programmed different degradations of network such
as: packet loss and delay. The audio inputs used belong to the
set of validation tests that are included in ITU-T P.862, the
algorithm of this same recommendation (PESQ) is used to
assess the level of quality of voice signal in reception. The
second quality index is determined by machine learning al-
gorithm, these algorithms are: decision trees, neural networks
and Bayesian networks.
The ﬁrst step is to build the algorithm used in machine
learning or training ﬁle, which has built considering 650
scenarios where QoS has been obtained using the E-model
algorithm. Each test scenario is represented in the training ﬁle
as a line, that will be presented later in more detail.
In the emulator network are programmed different scenar-
ios, with different parameter values of probability of packet
loss and delay inserted in the training ﬁle in order to better
validate the reliability of results.
The sample period for assessing the quality of VoIP com-
munications is 8 seconds, this time was chosen, in addition
to the original size of the audio ﬁle, due to the number of
packets sent by the transmitter (PC-A) during this time period
thus considering an encoding rate of 64 kbps are sent 400
packets of 160 bytes, for a shorter time the number of packets
sent is smaller and therefore the percentage of packet loss has
a lower resolution.
The software and tools, in each PC, used to build the test
scenario are the following:
• PC-A, PC-C: clients using softphone MyPhone 0.2b10
[17], packet analyser Wireshark [18] and software to
record audio ﬁle of extension .wav - VRS Recording
System [19].
• PC-B: router using the network emulator NETEM [20],
to simulate packet loss, delay, jitter and bandwidth; the
software ITU-T P.862 was used to ﬁnd the MOS index
for the voice quality.
The sound transmitted was generated by a player of ﬁle .wav
that is connected to the microphone input of PC1 by an audio
cable, and as mentioned previously, this ﬁle has a duration of
8 seconds and was sampled at 8 kHz and 16 bits.
The methodology followed in the tests to get the value using
the tool PESQ MOS is as follows:
• Initially, it starts a communication between the PC-A and
PC-C by softphones installed in the PCs, and lets you
choose the voice coder used to each VoIP call, where it
is made of computer to computer.

Test scenario.
• For each scenario the network emulator is conﬁgured with
parameters required to perform the test.
• The player transmits the audio (arq-orig.wav) to PC-A
where this sound is recorded (arq-orig2.wav), as the call
is active, and the voice is transmitted to the PC-C through
the PC-B.
• While data are transmitted, the program Wireshark that
is running on the PC-A and PC-C, it is saved the
network information such as: the signaling messages for
establishing, maintaining and ﬁnalizing calls, messages
from the RTP, the average size of the package (bytes),
average number of packets transferred per second and
average bandwidth.
• In the PC-C, the received audio is recorded in a ﬁle (arq-
deg.wav). This ﬁle and the original ﬁle are compared by
PESQ software, which runs on PC-B, resulting in a MOS-
LQO score.
A. Implementation of the input ﬁle for training algorithms
As mentioned before, the preparation of an initial database
of network parameters and the quality score for each sce-
nario was performed considering the ITU-T Recommendation
G.107. This mathematical model provides an R value of
quality ranging from 0 to 93.2, where the highest value
corresponds to a higher quality. The different scenarios were
constructed leaving the default parameters ﬁxed and varying
the following parameters:
• The Mean One-Way Delay.
• The Packet-loss Probability.
• The type of encoder is related to the parameters: encoding
rate, Ie (Equipment Impairment Factor) and Bpl (Packet-
loss Robustness Factor).
The values of Ie and Bpl are dependent on the vocoder
used, Table I represents values for the encoders have been
tested by the ITU-T G.107 and presented the recommendation.
In the test scenario were employed coders G.711 and G.729.

As a result it was obtained a ﬁle with 650 lines, for a better
understanding Table III presents the 10 ﬁrst cases or network
scenarios:
In order to group ranges of R values and deﬁne categories
of QoS, we took as reference model the classiﬁcation drawn
from ITU-T Recommendation G.107, which is presented in
Figure 2, where it is presented the limit values for both R and
MOS index.
The quality levels of classiﬁcation used in this work only
consider ﬁve categories, where the last two categories, Nearly
All Users Dissatisﬁed and Not Recommended at Figure 2 were
grouped into one.
These ﬁve categories are presented in Table IV:
With this categorization it is obtained the ﬁle that will
works as training ﬁle to the algorithms that determines the
quality of the communication. The sample lines from this ﬁle
is presented on Table V.

B. Determination of QoS using the tool Weka
In order to determine the QoS using the learning algorithms,
the software Weka-version 3.7.4 [21] was used as a tool for
data analysis method. This tool supports several algorithms,
based on related works, it was decided use the following three
algorithms :
• Desicion Tree J48 - algorithm C4.5;
• Bayesian networks - Naive Bayes;
• Neural Networks - Multilayer Perceptron.
With the training ﬁle, it was analyzed the cross-validation
and obtained the values of the factor ’F’ (F-measure) for each
algorithm tested, as shown in Table VI.

The values reached for the F factor were very high, whereas
values greater than 0.7 are enough for network training. As the
decision tree algorithm it was obtained the best results, having
the same results determining the QoS for all tests.
VI. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In this work, 300 tests were conducted following the
methodology explained, where in each test was considered
a scenario conﬁgured with different parameters on network
emulator. The higher the number of tests in learning techniques
greater the validity of the results.
The results obtained are presented in Figure 3, where it
can be seen the highest value of successes in determining the
quality of service of VoIP communication for each learning
algorithm used, where the Decision Trees algorithm reach 294
test results concordant with the results obtained by PESQ.
Also, the Multilayer Perceptron and Naives-Bayes algo-
rithms reached high values, these were 282 and 243 hits
respectively.
It is important to note that these results were obtained
considering the range of MOS values of each QoS category
and not a single value of index MOS.
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The test results obtained show that machine learning is a
valid method to determine the quality of a VoIP communica-
tion in several network conditions and using different voice
codecs, for this work the codecs: G.711 and G.729. The good
performance of the learning algorithms deﬁnitely depend of
the initial ﬁle used to training these algorithms, in this work
was used parameters values from a real IP network, and
the test was performed in network with realistic parameters.
Also, it was tested the conﬁdence of the E-Model algorithm
to determine the values of quality index for each scenario
included in the training ﬁle. The best result was obtained

Algorithms results
by the Decision Tree algorithm that reach 98% of accuracy,
this is a very high degree of reliability to determine the
quality category of VoIP communication in relation to other
works. The Multilayer Perceptron algorithm had high number
of success too, reaching 94% of accuracy. The Bayes Naives
algorithm obtained a less number of success and reached 85%.
The tests were performed in an emulated network and all the
software used are free, for this reason the implementation
of the same scenario for other works is possible. As future
work, we intend to evaluate the quality of video services, for
example, streaming video, creating a training ﬁle based on
ITU-T Recommendation P.930 [22]. Also, it will be studied
different techniques of network resource allocation based on
predictions of quality services of a future period of time, being
the goal of this idea improving the quality of an speciﬁc
service.
