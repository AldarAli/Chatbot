Abstract—This short paper is aiming to present our work
in progress about a study to investigate the cognitive process
of teaching for young learners with ASD in special education
settings. Because research has largely examined the different
cognitive processes involved in planning, instruction, and reflec-
tion separately and often in lab-controlled settings, our work
in progress is searching to investigate attitudes of educators
in special education settings (dedicated for children with ASD)
towards robots as a category of tools in natural conditions and
the impacts of their attitudes on their effective behaviours. From
a theoretical point of view, this work in progress is based on
the 4A Model for ”Acceptability, Acceptance, Adoption and
Appropriation”, created to describe and predict relationships
between attitudes and appropriation of complex technologies such
as robots. From a methodological point of view, this work in
progress is based on a mixed approach, combining interviews
and focus groups conducted with several professionals working
in different special education settings for children with ASD,
and observations in situ to collect objective data about real
activities performed by the educators with the children in the
special education settings. Finally, it is suggested that future
researchers examining educators’ thoughts and actions employ
mixed methodologies, such as case study, that examine the cogni-
tive processes holistically and in the natural teaching/education
environment, thereby linking actual behaviors with the cognitive
processes that produced them.

I. INTRODUCTION
France has approximately 700,000 people with Autism
Spectrum Disorders (ASD), including 100,000 children. Rapid
progress in technology, especially in the area of robotics,
offers tremendous possibilities for innovation in treatment for
individuals with ASD. Advances in recent years have enabled
robots to fulfill a variety of human-like functions, as well as
to aid with the goal of improving social skills of individuals
with ASD [21] [25] [26]. The process of teaching for young
learners with ASD is complex and multidimensional. Teaching
behaviors and actions are shaped by numerous cognitive
decisions made by the educators before, during, and after
instruction. The work in progress presented in this paper
examines educator cognition across the broad field of edu-
cation and, more specifically, when robots are used in special
education settings. To date, research has largely examined the
different cognitive processes involved in planning, instruction,
and reflection separately and often in controlled settings.
It is suggested that future researchers examining educators’
thoughts and actions employ mixed methodologies, such as
case study, that examine the cognitive processes holistically
and in the natural teaching/education environment, thereby
linking actual behaviors with the cognitive processes that
produced them.
A lot of existing ASD and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
studies have predominantly studied children interacting with
robots in lab-based settings [19] [27] [28] [29] [30] [33]
[34]. Even if several interesting findings are issued from
these studies conducted in controlled lab-like settings, moving
robots from the lab into the real classroom (i.e., in ecological
settings), where teachers apply the teaching program unsuper-
vised, is no straightforward task [10] [14] [15] [16]. So, em-
bedding robots into existing autism contexts and pedagogical
practices requires in-depth understanding of specific contexts
and practices, and of the adult users who will support robot-
based programs. Understanding the views of professionals
such as educators is therefore essential, as they are key
decision-makers for the adoption of new technologies, and
would be the ones to directly facilitate any future use of robots
[20]. The integration of a robot in a given social environment
(such as an education setting) can potentially redistribute
roles and influence the interaction of all individuals in that
context [35]. A school, as an organisation, obeys rules and
norms imposed by pedagogical principles, which are crucial
for teachers/educators, parents and children. The use of a robot
in a school context therefore requires that it applies these
principles.
If some studies have sought teachers and professionals’
views to explore implementing robots within real and regular
educational settings [12] [17] [31], very few studies have
investigated that so within special education settings. For
instance, in a larger study, Hughes-Roberts and Brown [13]
conducted interviews and focus groups with 20 teachers in
special (though not autism-specific) education settings in the
UK, incorporating a demonstration of a humanoid robot, NAO.
If some relevant data have been obtained about the activities
performed by the educators with the children with ASD, it was
unclear whether these educators considered, overall, robots
to be relevant, appropriate and acceptable for themselves.
In the same way, Huijnen et al. [16] [18] took a related
approach, combining focus groups, and co-creation sessions

with autism stakeholders and professionals (including teachers
and other school-based roles, all in the Netherlands) to develop
10 specific “intervention templates” for the humanoid robot,
KASPAR. Once again, several relevant results have been
obtained about the activities and the potentialities for the
children with ASD, but no information has been collected
about the attitudes of educators towards robots (usability,
acceptability) and the potential impact on their work and their
job.
Even if a lot of relevant results are issued from these existing
studies, very few researches only give a partial picture of the
information researchers need to know to work toward robot
deployment with learners with ASD within special education
settings. This is for five key reasons:
• First, children’s specific needs and the strategies used to
support them can be very distinct from those educated
within mainstream settings [11]. Greater knowledge is
needed about the utility of robot-based programs for
these particular children in their own specific, specialist
contexts.
• Second, all these existing studies have essentially asked
educators to answer questions or discuss ideas in relation
to demonstrations of existing robots [6] [13] [14] [15],
i.e., limiting with respect to discussing perceptions and
applications of robots as a category of tools, or for
generating novel use cases.
• Third, much existing research has either used surveys
and questionnaires [7] [8] [9] [14] [15] [16] to ask
educators to respond to topics and ideas that have been
pre-identified by researchers.
• Fourth, none of these studies have been conducted in
France while several studies demonstrated that cultural
differences exist (e.g., [3] [8] [18] [22] [23]).
• Fifth, from a theoretical point of view, all these exist-
ing studies are based on Technology Acceptance Model
(TAM) or Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Tech-
nology (UTAUT) model, which are mainly focused on
attitudes and opinions collected by using questionnaires
and interviews. But some studies [9] [10] have shown that
the main factor of the acceptability for educators is the
professional experience (i.e., their effective behaviours)
and have also show that TAM and UTAUT models are
not sufficient to predict effective behaviors of educators.
For all these reasons, our work in progress is aiming to
investigate more precisely attitudes of educators in special
education settings (dedicated for children with ASD) towards
robots as a category of tools (i) for describing and predicting
effective behaviors and (ii) for generating innovative use cases.
In Section 2, we will present the methodology and theory that
will enable us to carry out our study. We will thus describe the
model on which our study is built. In Section 3, we will take
up the issues at stake in this research, setting out the specific
and general expectations.
II. THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
From a theoretical point of view, our work in progress is
based on the 4A Model [4] [5] for ”Acceptability, Acceptance,
Adoption and Appropriation” (Figure 1). The 4A Model has
the following characteristics:
• If attitudes and opinions are central in ”traditional” TAM
and UTAUT models used in HUman Computer Interac-
tion (HCI), relationships between attitudes and behaviors
are not really described. The 4A Model is specifically
centred on these relationships between attitudes and ef-
fective behaviours.
• Among technologies, robots are very specific (e.g., em-
bodiment, autonomy, dynamics, social dimensions). The
4A Model has been specifically created to better un-
derstand the human factors implied in adoption and
appropriation of robotics systems.
• According to TAM and UTAUT models, the use of
a technology is directly and positively related to the
acceptance. For the 4A Model, to use a technology such
as a robot is not necessary a consequence of acceptance:
in some professional situations, the worker can have the
obligation to use the system even if s/he does not accept
the system. The 4A Model allows to collect precise data
about this kind of situation where the use if not correlated
to acceptance.
• The temporal dimension of appropriation is central in
the 4A Model, to follow the dynamics of adoption and
appropriation and to follow the evolution of attitudes
across the time.
• Five, form a theoretical point of view, all these studies are
based on TAM or UTAUT models, which are mainly fo-
cused on attitudes. But, some studies [9] [10] have shown
that the main factor of the acceptability for educators is
the professional experience and have also show that TAM
and UTAUT models are not sufficient to predict effective
behaviors of educators.

of technology, from [4] [5].
From a methodological point of view, our work in progress
is based on:
• Interviews and focus groups conducted with several pro-
fessionals working in different special education settings
for children with ASD, to collect subjective data about
52

attitudes and opinions according to the educators in
natural conditions/contexts.
• Observations in situ to collect objective data about real
activities performed by the educators with the children in
the special education settings.
• This mixed approach will provide additional information
to better understand the potential human and organisation
factors related to negatives or positives attitudes towards
robots, and to better predict the future behaviours related
to these attitudes.
III. CONCLUSION
As we said in the introduction, research is highlighting
the benefits of using robots for autistic children, in particular
to develop their skills needed for social inclusion. However,
these benefits have been observed in the laboratory and are
sometimes difficult to replicate in the school environment
(i.e., in ecological environment). Validity and transfer from
laboratory to ecological settings are probably the biggest
problems in psychological and psychiatric research on autism.
And yet, the challenge of supporting autistic children arises
in this environment, in conjunction with the intervention of
educators and teachers [2]. Because, the number of high-tech
applications in the training of children with autism increases
every day, it is crucial to investigate the representations and
acceptance of professionals and educators that play a vital
role in their ability to use robots optimally, adapting them
to the challenges they face. The aim of our study is to shed
light on the the organizational, technical (robot-specific) and
psychological factors that determine robot integration. More
broadly, our study is aiming to offer recommendations for
adapting education settings to facilitate the use of a robot
in order to promote the inclusion of children with autism.
Because this work is actually in progress, we will present the
first results during the conference.
