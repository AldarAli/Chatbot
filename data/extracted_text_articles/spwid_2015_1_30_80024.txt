Abstract—Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is an established treat-
ment in Parkinson’s Disease whose underlying biological mecha-
nisms are however unknown. Mathematical models aiming at a
better understanding of how DBS works through the stimulation
of the electrical ﬁeld inside the brain tissue have been developed
in the past years. This study deals with in silico optimization of
the stimuli delivered to the brain using actual clinical data and
a Finite Element Method (FEM) approach. The goal is to cover
a given target volume and limit the spread of the stimulation
beyond it to avoid possible side effects. The fraction of the
volume of activated tissue within the target and the fraction of
the stimulation ﬁeld that spreads beyond it are computed in order
to quantify the performance of the stimuli conﬁguration. First,
a state-of-the-art lead is considered, in both single active contact
and multiple active contact stimulation scenarios. A comparison
with a ﬁeld-steering lead is further presented. The obtained
results demonstrate feasibility of multiple contact stimulation
through better shaping the stimuli and effectively using ﬁeld
steering.

INTRODUCTION
Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical procedure
that consists of delivering electrical stimuli, usually rectangular
biphasic pulses, to a target inside the brain by using one or
several surgically implanted leads. The goal of the therapy is
the alleviation of symptoms of various neurological diseases,
such as Parkinson’s Disease (PD) [1], epilepsy [2], dystonia
[3], and others. DBS mostly replaced surgical lesioning and
ablation procedures because of its reversibility, ﬂexibility, and
individualization potential [4]. The interest in DBS has spread
to other areas of medicine, e.g. psychiatry, with applications
in diseases such as schizophrenia [5] or Tourette Syndrome
[6]. In the case of PD, since the surgery of DBS is quite
complicated and costly compared to treatment with drugs,
physicians usually choose advanced patients for this procedure
when pharmacotherapy, in particular with levodopa, has lost
effectiveness or has severe side effects [1]. Although some
studies suggest that an earlier implantation could be beneﬁcial
[7].
The principle of DBS is in delivering mild electrical pulses
via a chronically implanted lead, whose active contacts are
in the subcortical area, where a target area is deﬁned. Prior
to the operation, patients undergo clinical examination by a
multidisciplinary team, as well as medical imaging. Based
on the images, the physician pinpoints a target area, which
is in PD usually located in the basal ganglia area of the
brain, with the subthalamic nucleus (STN) being of particular
interest. A few weeks after the surgery, the patients undergo a
lengthy trial-and-error programming period to tune the stimuli
delivered to the brain.
The physiological mechanism of DBS and its long-term
effects on the brain still remain unknown, and the therapeu-
tical outcome is difﬁcult to predict. Furthermore, because of
uncertainties in the position of the leads or improperly tuned
stimulation settings, the stimulated volume might go beyond
the target causing undesirable side effects [8]. Shaping the
stimuli so that the stimulated volume covers the intended
target and does not spill outside of it is thus important for
maximization of the therapeutical beneﬁts and minimization
of the side effects.

Currently used lead designs, mostly from Medtronics (see
Figure 1(a)), were originally adapted from cardiac pacing
technology and have not evolved much since then. Meanwhile,
the insights into neurostimulation and ﬁeld steering obtained
in recent years through Finite Element Method (FEM) based
multiphysics simulation and neuron models, along with the
exponential improvement of computational capabilities, open
up for more sophisticated and individualized solutions, aiming
to shorten the programming time and to better understand the
underlying mechanisms [9].
Addressing the shortcomings of the currently used designs,
novel leads have been developed by companies, such as 3Win
(Belgium), Sapiens (The Netherlands) or Aleva (Switzerland),
which could be conﬁgured in more versatile spacial settings,
taking advantage of ﬁeld steering techniques to tune the

stimuli. As seen in the contacts of the leads shown in Figure 1,
while the conventional state-of-the-art lead delivers a radially
symmetric stimulation over the whole cylindrical contact, the
ﬁeld steering one is capable of asymmetrical stimulation that
can be tailored to the target area anatomy [10].
A possibility for performance improvement in the exist-
ing state-of-the-art electrodes is offered by a multicontact
approach, i.e. manipulating the stimuli simultaneously using
two or more active contacts. It has the beneﬁt of allowing
further shaping of the activated tissue area and thus providing
more ﬂexibility.
This manuscript is composed as follows. In Section 2, an
overview of the FEM mathematical model is given, along
with different neuronal stimulation quantiﬁcation schemes.
Afterwards, the optimization technique used is presented. In
Section 3, the results of the optimized stimuli are outlined, for
a single active contact, for multiple active contacts, and using
ﬁeld steering lead conﬁgurations. Conclusions, limitations, and
future work are discussed in Section 4.
II.
MODELS AND METHODS
A. Electric Field Model
The ﬁrst step to compute optimized stimuli is to obtain the
electric ﬁeld distribution for a given electrode geometry. The
electric potential is obtained by solving the equation of steady
currents in the tissue:
∇·(σ∇u) = 0,
(1)
where u is the electric potential, σ the electric conductivity,
and ∇ is gradient. The electric ﬁeld E is obtained by taking
the negative gradient of u:
E = −∇u.
(2)
Model (1) can be solved numerically using a FEM solver.
The model geometry considered in this study consists of
the bulk brain tissue, the lead, and an encapsulation layer
surrounding it.
The bulk tissue is represented as a cube with a side of
0.4 m centered on the tip of the lead that is grounded on
the outer surfaces to simulate the ground in the implanted
pulse generator. Although the brain tissue is heterogeneous
and anisotropic in reality, these effects are beyond the scope
of this paper, see [9][11] for details. Although the brain
tissue has several components, e.g., white matter, gray matter,
cerebrospinal ﬂuid and blood vessels, its conductivity can be
approximated as homogeneous with σ = 0.1 S/m [12].
Two lead designs were considered for this study: a widely
used state-of-the-art lead and a ﬁeld steering lead. The former
has cylindrical contacts with a height of 1.5 mm and a
separation between contacts of 0.5 mm. The latter has elliptical
contacts. To facilitate ﬁeld steering, the rows are rotated 45
degrees to each other with respect to the lead axis, as shown
in Figures 1(b),1(c), and 1(d). Both leads have a diameter of
1.27 mm.
An encapsulation layer is formed around a lead implanted
in the brain due to the reaction of the body to a foreign object
[13]. Its thickness and conductivity are still open to debate and
might be patient speciﬁc. Following [9], a 0.5 mm thick layer
with a conductivity of 0.18 S/m is considered.
The stimulation is modeled as a boundary condition at the
active contacts surface while the non-active contacts are left
ﬂoating. It should be noted that model (1) is a linear partial
differential equation, and thus, it is enough to compute the ﬁeld
distribution for a unit stimulus and then scale it accordingly,
which transformation will simplify the computations.
The model has been implemented in COMSOL 4.3b (Com-
sol AB, Sweden). The solutions obtained by the FEM solver
were then equidistantly gridded on a 70×70×60 grid centered
at the lead tip and expanding 16 mm in the axes perpendicular
to the lead and 20 mm in the lead axis, in order to be exported
for further processing.
Several ﬁeld distributions were computed:
•
State-of-the-art lead: Distributions with one active
contact and the rest ﬂoating were computed at ﬁrst. In
addition to that, ﬁeld distributions with the grounded
inactive contacts were computed. This was done to en-
able summing up them for the multicontact approach,
since the effect of one active contact on the others
when left ﬂoating can be computed.
•
Field steering lead: Distributions for the different con-
ﬁgurations considered (Diamond-4, X-5, X-8, shown
in Figure 1) were computed for each row of contacts.
B. Quantiﬁcation of activated volumes
Volumes of activated tissue can be quantiﬁed by using axon
models under the methodology by McNeal [14]. While axon
models yield precise results, the procedure is computationally
expensive and the neuron network must be known to some
degree. Other approaches involve functions that approximate
the activated volume without taking into account the anatomy
of the neurons, such as Rattay’s activation function [15] or
the electric ﬁeld. These have the advantage of requiring less
computations and only a stationary analysis. However, using
second derivatives might result in numerical issues, in partic-
ular in the area near the lead. Furthermore, it was shown that
the electric ﬁeld provides more robust means for quantifying
neuronal stimulation [16]. Thus, for this study, the electric ﬁeld
will be used. The activated neurons are distinguished from the
rest by applying a threshold value to the electric ﬁeld that will
depend on the neuron anatomy and the characteristics of the
pulse itself [16].
To place the pre-computed by the FEM solver electric ﬁeld
at the proper position, conventional translation-rotation algebra
is utilized. Assuming that the tip of the lead is at the origin,
the set of operations is given by:
Eeval = RrotRzE+xlead,
(3)
where E and Eeval are the original and positioned electric ﬁeld
vectors respectively, Rrot is a rotation matrix which aligns the
ﬁeld with the given lead vector, Rz is a rotation matrix with
respect to the Z axis (used for ﬁeld steering), and xlead is the
lead position.
Once the ﬁeld is properly positioned and ﬁltered with the
aforementioned threshold, intersection volumes are computed
under a methodology similar to [17]. Two of them are of
particular interest: the activated volume of the target area and
15

the activated volume outside the target area. The topology of
the target area is taken from an atlas of potential regions for
therapeutical stimulation and can be assumed to be convex.
Whether the electric ﬁeld points are inside of the convex hull
of the target area or not is checked with an additional function
[18].
C. Optimization scheme
In order to optimize the stimuli, the following optimization
problem can be deﬁned:
min
ui
J(ui),
(4)
where ui are the optimization variables (in this case, the electric
potential or potentials of the stimuli) and J(ui) is a cost
function to be deﬁned (ideally, a convex function).
The following cost function is proposed:
J(ui) = pSpill(ui)

100−pAct(ui)
100−pTh

pAct ≤ pTh
J(ui) = pSpill(ui)
pAct > pTh
(5)
where pSpill is the fraction of the activated volume that lies
outside the target, pAct is the fraction of the target which is
activated and pTh is the minimum activation required of the
target. All of them are given in percent for illustration. For
this study, pTh is set at 95%.
The motivation behind the cost function above is that it is
continuous and convex, since both pAct and pSpill are mono-
tonically nondecreasing with the amplitude of the stimulus.
An example of cost function (5) dependence on the stimuli
amplitude can be seen in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Example of cost function J as a function of the stimulus amplitude
The small peaks that appear in Figure 2 occur because
of issues with the volume computation. They arise since the
geometry used for both the activation volume and the target is
deﬁned in convex hulls of a discrete cloud of points. Although
this makes the function non-convex in practice, the peaks are
small enough to be skipped by increasing the step size of the
optimization algorithm. A minimum step size of 0.002 V was
taken.

RESULTS
A. Single Contact
To optimize stimulation with only one active contact, two
approaches can be considered. First, the contact can be ﬁxed
and only the stimulus amplitude is optimized. Second, the
active contact is left as an additional optimization variable,
restricted to taking a single value in the set Cs = {0,1,2,3},
where contact 0 is the most distal and 3 is the most proximal.
Due to the possibility of choosing the active contact at will
and to illustrate the efﬁciency of the optimization method, the
second approach is selected in this study.
The free contact approach will divide the optimization into
four problems with ﬁxed contacts. In order to speed up the
computations, best active contact could be chosen without
optimization. By examining J(ui) given by (5), it can be
easily seen that as long as there is an intersection between
the activated volume and the target for at least one of the
contacts, the cost function will be lower in general for the
optimal contact no matter how big ui is. So, it is enough to
do a single evaluation of the cost function for a given value of
ui to choose the contact. Said value cannot be too low, since
it might yield empty intersections, or too high since it will
take too much time to calculate due to the number of points
involved. Thus, the evaluation is performed with low ui and
then if the intersection is empty, ui is set to a higher value.
Optimization was performed for 65 lead positions whose
clinical data stated a single contact stimulation with an activa-
tion threshold of 175 and 200 V/m for comparison. Comparing
the results with respect to the clinical settings is of great
interest, so the fraction of conﬁgurations estimated successfully
by the optimization algorithm with respect to the clinical
settings was computed as well.

It can be seen from Table I that the mathematical model
and the deﬁned target predict the clinically used contact in
roughly a half of the cases. In addition, in almost all of the
cases, the predicted optimal contact is an immediate neighbor
of the one speciﬁed in the clinical data. In some cases, there
is no signiﬁcant difference in the values of the cost function,
so either contact can be utilized, according to the calculated

values. In addition, the predicted optimized stimuli amplitude
is fairly close to the clinical one (see Figure 3, which suggest
that in most cases a threshold between 175 and 200 V/m might
be sufﬁcient. It comes though with a high standard deviation.
B. Multiple Contacts
Another approach would be to allow for multiple active
contact conﬁgurations. To simplify the ﬁeld modeling, the
linearity of (1) is exploited. In particular, the ﬁeld distribution
for each contact stimulating with an unit stimulus while the
others are grounded is computed ﬁrst, denoting it as E0,i for
the i-th contact. Then the relation between active contacts and
the rest in ﬂoating conﬁguration is computed. It follows a
linear relationship and is denoted as αki, which would represent
the effect the i-th contact has over the k-th contact when the
k-th contact is ﬂoating. This is used to transform from an
active-grounded to an active-ﬂoating conﬁguration, when the
contributions are being summed.
The electric ﬁeld distributions result from a sum of four
contacts, with the stimuli given by the active contacts, denoted
by ui and representing the degrees of freedom and the non-
active (ﬂoating) contacts contributing with the terms charac-
terized by the corresponding αki. For example, for a 2-contact
scheme, one gets
E2cont(r) = u1E0,1 +u2E0,2+
+(u1α31 +u2α32)E0,3 +(u1α41 +u2α42)E0,4
(6)
It should be noted that the numbering of the contacts above
was arbitrary, and it could be any combination of them.
(a)
(b)
Figure 4. Isolevels for E = 200 V/m for a single active contact (a) and two
active contacts (b)
As can be seen in Figure
4(b), multiple active contacts
might be useful to tailor the stimulation so that it achieves
a similar activated volume with less overspill. The results
is in principle dependent on the position of the target with
respect to the active contact in the single contact approach. If
the target is located next to the active contact, then it would
be probably more useful to consider just a single contact
stimulation. However, if the target is located in between two
contacts, shaping the stimulation with these two contacts might
be beneﬁcial.
The optimization method is similar to the one described in
the previous section for a single contact. To speed up com-
putations, only the conﬁgurations which involve neighbouring

as the optimal (in red) and Contacts 0 (left) and 2 (right) as secondary (in
green)
contacts to the ones obtained in the single contact approach are
considered. So, for example, if the optimal contact is contact
1, only combinations which involve contacts 1 and 0 and 1
and 2 are considered (see Figure 5).

Results are summarized in Figure 6 and Table II. The

part of the cases. However, the improvement can be signiﬁcant,
with a decrease of up to 5 or 6 percentage points in the
absolute value of the overspill with respect to the single contact
approach. It should be noted that the state-of-the-art lead
considered here features a small distance between contacts.
Better results could be achieved for larger distances between

contacts, since it is more likely that the target lies between
contacts.
C. Field Steering
As was investigated in [17][19], ﬁeld steering yields better
results regarding overspill than with the state-of-the-art radial
stimulation. In this study, the optimization scheme described
above was implemented to obtain the optimal stimulus ampli-
tude.
Three different conﬁgurations were tested, as illustrated
in Figure 1. The parameters to optimize would be, for each
conﬁguration, the rows where the active contacts are located
and the orientation of the lead with respect to its axis. To speed
up computations, the optimization followed a similar scheme
to the one with multiple contacts, taking as a baseline the
results obtained with single contacts and state-of-the-art lead.
Due to different shapes of the contacts, the rows at roughly
the same height are considered, plus their neighbors.

Results are summarized in Figures 7 - 9 and Tables III - V.
In almost all cases, there is an improvement in the overspill
with respect to the one-contact approach. The improvement
is largest in average with the Diamond-4 conﬁguration (see
Figure 7). The high standard deviation comes from the variety
of geometries considered, making the improvement heavily
dependent on the lead position with respect of the target. Some
cases were observed where the X-5 or X-8 conﬁgurations
achieved better results that could be because of the lead
location.

DISCUSSION
Using optimization schemes in order to scale the stimulus
amplitude of the active contact or contacts could yield an
activation volume that better covers a given target, limiting,
at the same time, as much as possible stimulation beyond
the target. This study compares the state-of-the-art one-contact
approach with a multiple contact approach and ﬁeld steering.
In the analysis of the one-contact approach, it was seen that
selecting the active contact freely for a given target, a simple
model predicts the clinically used contact in roughly a half
of the times in the considered lead population. Furthermore,
in some cases, there is no signiﬁcant difference between the
scores of the clinical and the optimal conﬁgurations.
In the multicontact approach, allowing for multiple contacts
improved the overspill in around 38% of the cases. It must
be noted that the effect is limited by the small distance

between the contacts and could be more signiﬁcant for a larger
separation of the contacts.
Finally, the results obtained are compared to ﬁeld steering
conﬁgurations. A signiﬁcant improvement of the overspill with
a decrease of 10 percentage points in average was found in all
cases, with an average decrease of 18 percentage points for
the Diamond 4 conﬁguration.
However, the results obtained in this study are valid un-
der some limitations. First, the brain tissue was assumed to
be homogeneous, when this is not the case and signiﬁcant
(patient speciﬁc) differences may arise [9]. Furthermore, the
encapsulation layer surrounding the lead has uncertain physical
properties, such as the conductivity and the thickness, both of
which might be time variant [20]. In addition, considering the
electric ﬁeld as a predictor of whether a neuron is stimulated
or not is an approximation. A more thorough analysis would
need a complete neuron population model. Finally, the results
obtained assume a certain target structure, which may be
patient speciﬁc as well. Results should be veriﬁed against
therapeutic outcomes, but the latter are not yet available for
this study.
Despite the mentioned limitations, this study highlights
how using optimization schemes and geometric arguments can
help to choose optimal stimuli and facilitate the comparison
between different conﬁgurations. Further work could add more
optimization schemes, such as using electric ﬁeld differences
between a target electric ﬁeld distribution and the one given
by the lead instead of geometry. In addition, it would be
worthwhile to study the inﬂuence of the encapsulation tissue
properties and the anisotropies of the brain tissue.
