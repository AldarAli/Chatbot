Abstract‚ÄîDue to the development of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)
communication, safe driving support such as collision prevention
and adaptive cruise control has been achieved. In addition,
vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication as well as com-
munication with a cloud server using mobile lines (vehicle-
to-cloud communication) have been developed in recent years.
These communications are altogether called vehicle-to-everything
(V2X) communication. Through V2X communication, a vehicle‚Äôs
peripheral information can be shared with other vehicles on
a cloud server. However, the problem of masquerade attacks
on the cloud must be addressed. By faking vehicle information
on a cloud server, an adversary may deliberately cause trafÔ¨Åc
congestion and/or accidents. In this research, we proposed a
method that detects misbehavior (masquerade data) from ag-
gregated data on a cloud server using V2X communication by
utilizing the surrounding vehicle information. We also analyzed
possible threats and requirements for data that are sent to cloud
servers, and evaluate the proposed method‚Äôs implementation.
Using the proposed method, we detected 93% of the masquerade
data, improved the detection rate by 100% by increasing the
threshold value of the proposed method, and enhanced the effect
of guaranteeing the data‚Äôs reliability. Furthermore, we evaluated
the false positives of the proposed method and its execution
processing time, examining the method‚Äôs feasibility.
Keywords‚Äìvehicle security; V2X communication; detecting mas-
queraded data.

INTRODUCTION
This paper is based on ‚ÄùA Method of Detecting CamouÔ¨Çage
Data with Mutual Vehicle Position Monitoring‚Äù published in
VEHICULAR 2017[1]. This paper consists of 6 sections. We
describe the background of this research in section II. In
section III, we compare existing research and analyze the
threat of vehicle spooÔ¨Ång to clarify the novelty and goal of
this research. We show our proposed method in section IV,
and we describe its evaluation and consideration in section V.
Considering the evaluation, we offer insight to our future work
in section VI, and summarize this research in the Ô¨Ånal section
VII.

BACKGROUND
In recent years, research on autonomous driving and
vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication are being conducted
in the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) Ô¨Åeld. In addition
to providing V2V communication using the Vehicular Ad
hoc Network (VANET), vehicles can engage in vehicle-to-
infrastructure (V2I) communication with roadside aircraftst
and vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) communication with tablets
owned by pedestrians. Vehicles can also do vehicle-to-cloud
(V2C) communication with cloud servers using mobile lines.
These communication methods listed above are generally
referred to as vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication.
When vehicles perform V2X communication, cloud servers
can collect various kinds of information, and we can create a
Local Dynamic Map (LDM) [2] for cooperative driving from
the collective management of road and vehicle information.
This type of communication sometimes is referred as probe
information systems [3] or Ô¨Çoating car data (FCD) [4]. In
addition, various systems and services can be provided, which
includes simpliÔ¨Åcation of management tasks such as summa-
rizing operation results, analyzing operation trends, summing
up tasks, and simplifying the input of daily reports.
On the other hand, in a system using a cloud server,
masquerade data transfer to a cloud inÔ¨Çuences a system.
Attacks against safe driving support services using a cloud
pose a threat because the intentional transfer of masquerade
data to a cloud are on the rise. Attackers can block roads
or cause trafÔ¨Åc congestion by sending fake trafÔ¨Åc accident
information to a cloud server. Various masquerade techniques
of vehicle disguise have been identiÔ¨Åed, such as faking driving
and position information as well as a vehicle ‚Äô s condition. In
this research, we focus on masqueraded position information
among all of the data received by a cloud server from vehicles,
and we attempt to detect them by mutually monitoring the
position information of vehicles using V2X communication.

RELATED WORK
There are previous work researching the detection of mali-
cious vehicles in V2X communication [5] [6], but in reality, the
deÔ¨Ånition of a malicious vehicle is ambiguous. In this section,
we analyze attacks on vehicle communication and clarify what
kind of malicious vehicles to be solved in this research.

A. Threat Analysis of Transmission Data
Table I shows the threat analysis of data transmitted to
a cloud server. These threats include eavesdropping attacks,
falsiÔ¨Åcations, and spooÔ¨Ång. SpooÔ¨Ång attacks are divided into
vehicle impersonation and data masquerade. Vehicle imper-
sonation means that attackers pretend to be other vehicles. For
example, even though one vehicle does not have any trouble, an
attacker pretends to be another vehicle and then calls the police
lying that it had an accident. An example of data masquerade is
when a vehicle‚Äôs own position information or status is masked.
Security requirements regarding these threats include con-
Ô¨Ådentiality, completeness, node reliability, and data reliability.
To supply conÔ¨Ådentiality and completeness, data encryption
is proposed and can be done by a secret key or an ID base
cipher. Node reliability identiÔ¨Åes vehicles that are pretending
to be other vehicles. The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
method, which is adapted by the vehicles, is one good res-
olution because certiÔ¨Åcates guarantee vehicles. Data reliability
prevents attackers from masquerading data. However, this is
not effective for all spooÔ¨Ång acts.
B. Difference Between Node and Data Reliability
Node reliability means that a cloud server trusts a particular
vehicle and believes that it is not pretending to be a different
vehicle. The previous section showed that the PKI method can
be adapted by vehicles to resolve the problem. A cloud may
be able to verify the electronic certiÔ¨Åcation and conÔ¨Årm the
transmitter‚Äôs information by the mechanism shown in Figure
1.
On the other hand, this research focuses on data masquer-
ade, as described in Figure 2. Since data encryption and PKI
do not conÔ¨Årm whether the received data are masqueraded,
data masquerade is inherently different from node reliability
which can be resolved by these methods. We will propose a
method that can handle such example, which guarantees the
reliability of the data.
IV.
PROPOSAL
In this section, we will propose a method to detect misbe-
havior from data transmitted to a cloud.
A. Outline
Vehicles can use V2X communication. When they send
their position information to a cloud server, they also send
other information in addition to their position. In this research,
a cloud server detects masqueraded data from transmitted data
by using the relay base station information in V2C commu-
nication and peripheral vehicles in V2V communication. We
will explain separately them to simplify our proposing method.
B. Presuppositions
1)
A safe channel has been secured by relationships of
mutual trust among all vehicles and cloud servers
2)
Vehicles and cloud servers have been mutually certi-
Ô¨Åed beforehand.
3)
Relationships between cloud servers and base stations
have been built.
C.
DeÔ¨Ånition of Terminology in Proposed Method
‚Ä¢
Vehicle ID
This ID is used by vehicles in V2V communication, and this
is a different public ID for each vehicle.
‚Ä¢
V2C Vehicle ID
This ID is used for a unique key in V2C communication. This
secret ID is not available to others. V2C Vehicle ID and Vehicle
ID is uniquely related.
‚Ä¢
Via Base Station (BS) ID
This ID is used in V2C communication, and this is a different
ID for each base station.
‚Ä¢
Peripheral Vehicle (PV) ID
This ID is a received vehicle ID from other vehicles in V2V
communication.
D. Use of Base Station‚Äôs Information in V2C Communication
When sending position information in V2C communica-
tion, vehicles attach V2CVehicleID to their position informa-
tion, and send it to a cloud. A relay base station on the V2C
communication attaches its own ViaBSID to information which
was sent from vehicles and encapsulates it. V2CVehicleIDs
of all vehicles are registered in cloud servers, and cloud
servers can be known from which vehicles inquiry when they
conÔ¨Årm these IDs. A possible communication range covered by

Figure 4. Advantage of using base station‚Äôs information
base station‚Äôs area and ViaBSIDs are also registered in cloud
servers.
Figure 3 indicates an example of base station‚Äôs information
in V2C communication. Vehicles possess own V2CVehicleID;
base stations also possess own ViaBSIDs. V2CVehicleIDs shall
be V2C A or V2C B, and ViaBSIDs shall be BS1 or BS2 to
explain simply. When vehicles perform V2C communication,
a cloud can obtain not only VehicleID or vehicle‚Äôs position
information but also ViaBSID and V2CVehicleID.
Figure 4 shows a countermeasure example of position data
masquerade. We can detect masqueraded position information
toward another base station using relay base station‚Äôs informa-
tion in V2C communication.
E. Use of Peripheral Vehicle‚Äôs Information in V2V Communi-
cation
Vehicles exchange VehicleIDs with nearby vehicles in
V2V communication. We deÔ¨Åne that peripheral vehicles are
traveling vehicles within V2V communication coverage area,
and PVID is received vehicleID from a peripheral vehicle. In
our proposed method, only VehicleID is exchanged in V2V
communication.

Figure 6. Advantage of using peripheral vehicle information
When vehicles send their position information to a cloud,
these information include V2CVehicleID, VehicleID, and re-
ceived PVIDs in V2V communication. PVIDs show a guaran-
tee that nearby vehicles exist in V2V communication coverage
area. Figure 5 shows an example of peripheral vehicle‚Äôs
information in V2V communication. Vehicle A communicates
with the vehicle C and D which are traveling in V2V com-
munication coverage area, and acquires those vehicle IDs.
Vehicle A handles acquired VehicleIDs as PVIDs, and a cloud
use PVIDs to check Vehicle A‚Äôs position information with
peripheral Vehicles C and D.
Figure 6 shows a countermeasure example of position data
masquerade. We assume that a malicious vehicle masquerades
its own position information. A cloud conÔ¨Årms PVIDs sent
from a vehicle and compares received position information
with peripheral vehicle‚Äôs positions which are relevant to
PVIDs. When a cloud Ô¨Ånds that transmitted position informa-
tion is outside V2V communication coverage with peripheral
vehicles, the cloud determines that the received position infor-
mation has been masqueraded. However when this information

position information. Vehicles acquire peripheral vehicle infor-
mation in V2V communication and mutually monitor them.
This helps cloud servers detect masqueraded data.
F. Detection Method of Misbehavior With V2X Communica-
tion
Our proposed method is a combination of two described
above by using V2X communication (Figure 7). A cloud
receives not only position information or VehicleID but also
peripheral vehicle‚Äôs and relay base station‚Äôs information. Mas-
queraded data can be detected through these information, as
described in Figure 8.
V2CVehicleID is used in the Ô¨Årst step on Figure 8. Cloud
servers conÔ¨Årm whether received data is sent from vehicles or
not. Second, cloud servers compare ViaBSID with received
position information to conÔ¨Årm whether a sending vehicle

Figure 8. Misbehavior detection procedure to a vehicle send data
exists in relay base station‚Äôs coverage area. When receives
position information exceeds this area, we assume that it can‚Äôt
be consistent and that received information was regarded as
masqueraded data. This step helps detect data masquerade
toward other base station‚Äôs coverage area. At the third or fourth
step, cloud servers detect masqueraded data by using PVIDs.
Third, cloud servers search vehicles corresponding to sending
vehicle‚Äôs PVID, and Ô¨Årth, they compare received position
information with peripheral vehicle‚Äôs position corresponding to
PVID. If the distance between two vehicle‚Äôs position exceeds
V2V communication coverage, we assume that it can‚Äôt be
consistent and that received information was regarded as mas-
queraded data. This operation is performed a predetermined
number of times. In proposed method, a predetermined number
of times means the number of PVIDs which is necessary for
cloud servers to trust. This is a so-called threshold value. By
setting threshold, we can assure more reliable data.
V.
EVALUATION AND CONSIDERATION
To evaluate the usefulness of our proposed misbehavior
detection, we will calculate the evaluation. Then we will
consider the practicality of our proposal from the obtained
evaluation.
A. Simulator
In this paper we use Scenargie [7] as a simulator to
evaluate the performance of our proposed method. Scenargie
is a network simulator developed by Space-Time Engineering
(STE). By combining expansion modules such as LTE, V2V
communication and multi-agent, we can construct a realistic
simulation. In addition, since communication systems and
evaluation scenarios are becoming more complicated, this
ingenious simulation has greatly reduced the effort required
to create scenarios.
B.
Evaluation Model
For a evaluation environment, we use one square kilometer
Manhattan model and use simulation parameters shown in
Table II. We set the number of vehicles to 158 [cars] and
the range to 1 [km2] because the average car density in
Japan is 158 [cars/km2]. ITU-R P.1411 model is a radio wave
propagation scheme that considers road map information, and
radio waves are attenuated based on the shape of the road,
so we compared with a two-ray model which includes direct
waves and reÔ¨Çected waves from the ground, this model is close
to reality. Figure 9 shows one scene when the simulator is
active.

Evaluation of Misbehavior Detection
Figure 10 shows per-threshold detection rates of masquer-
aded data from data aggregated in a cloud server. Masqueraded
data transmitted to a cloud could be detected at 100% by
increasing the proposed method‚Äôs threshold. However, when
the threshold was low, we could not completely detect all of
masqueraded data. The reason is shown in Figure 11 and 12.
Figure 11 shows an example of misbehavior in V2V communi-
cation coverage with peripheral vehicles. A malicious vehicle
masquerades its own position (position 1) to position 2 in V2V
communication coverage. In this case, since peripheral vehicles
guarantee masqueraded information from a malicious vehicle,
a misbehavior becomes possible. Figure 12 shows a collusion
between malicious vehicles. Since they mutually guarantee
masqueraded position information, cloud server trusts these
information. However, these problems can be addressed by
increasing the prescribed number of times (threshold values)
in Figure 8. By increasing the threshold values, we can create
the situation shown in Figure 13, and it is possible to limit

D. Evaluation of Misdetection Rate
Figure 14 shows false detection rates (false positives) of
our proposed method, which is based on the average vehicle
density in Japan. The method‚Äôs threshold is the number of
PVIDs which is necessary for cloud servers to trust. In the
previous section, we found that an increase in the threshold
improves the detection rates of masqueraded data. Here, we
will calculate the false positive detection rates (false positive),
regarding whether cloud servers trust information on vehicles
that are not misbehaving.
In the simulation environment shown in Table V, Figure
14 shows that the false positives when all 158 cars are not
misbehaving. By increasing the threshold value, false positive
rates improved. Increasing the threshold value under Japanese
average vehicle density, cloud servers erroneously detects
normal communication as abnormal.

Figure 15. False positive comparison with urban area‚Äôs average vehicle
density (1128 [cars/km2]) environment
Then, the false positive rates under the average vehicle
density environment in urban city (Osaka), which has the
highest average car density in Japan, are shown in Figure 15.
In a high vehicle density area, since vehicles can acquire a lot
of peripheral vehicle information in V2V communication, even
if the threshold is increased, an increase of the false detection
rate can be suppressed. Therefore, we found that our proposed
method is more effective in areas with high vehicle density
than lower density. Actually the inÔ¨Çuence of masquerading
vehicle information is great in areas with high vehicle density.
Malicious act such as faking driving and position information
may cause the large accident in higher density than lower. Our
proposed method can guarantee transmitted information from
vehicle to cloud servers, and it works better in areas with a
larger number of peripheral vehicles than in areas with fewer
peripheral vehicles. Our proposed method is useful in trafÔ¨Åc
congestion zones where data masquerade has a huge impact.

proposed method. Even looking at this table, we can say the

Comparison of ARIB STD-T109 and IEEE 802.11P
ARIB STD-T109 is a V2V communication‚Äôs standard used
in Japan. In a previous evaluation we used this standard based
on V2V communication in the simulator. IEEE802.11p is a
Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) standard for
wireless vehicular networks in the United States and Europe
[8] [9]. IEEE802.11p, which is the standard for transports and
the network layers, is standardized as the part of IEEE 1609
[10] family and deÔ¨Ånes the architecture and security physical
layer access etc. for DSRC. The main differences between
ARIB STD-T109 and WAVE are the frequency band and the
number of channels. We will conÔ¨Årm that what kind of dif-
ference using ARIB STD-T109 will make with IEEE802.11p
in our proposed method. The simulation environment using
IEEE802.11p is shown in Table V.
F.
Differences Among Misbehavior Detection Rates
Figure 16 shows the per-threshold detection rates of mas-
queraded data from data aggregated on a cloud server. Unlike
Figure 10, it is the result of using IEEE802.11p. Compared
to using T109, the detection rates improve with IEEE802.11p.
When the threshold value is 3, the detection rate is 100%. To
determine this difference, our proposed method must determine
how much vehicles communicate with peripheral vehicles.
If there are many communication targets around a vehicle,
cloud servers can trust vehicles and exclude malicious vehicles.
T109 has a lower frequency than IEEE802.11p. However since
IEEE802.11p has strong propagation strength, vehicles can be
communicated to more peripheral vehicles, leading to better
results.
G. Differences Among Misdetection Rates
Figure 17 shows the false detection rates (false positives)
of the proposed method based on the average car density
in Japan when we used IEEE802.11p. It shows considerably
better results than Figure 14. As stated above, this is related

Figure 18. False positive comparison with urban area‚Äôs average vehicle
density (1128 [cars/km2]) environment when using IEEE802.11p
results were signiÔ¨Åcantly different depending on the car density
because the number of peripheral vehicles (that can commu-
nicate) increased due to the greater vehicle density. However,
since there is only slight difference when IEEE802.11p is used,
we believe that it was probably communicating with vehicles
that can already communicate under an average Japanese car
density environment. This means that the results did not change
even under an average Japanese vehicle density environment.
When using T109, a suitable threshold must be set for various
vehicle densities, but since there is no change in the decreasing
positives when using IEEE802.11p, a certain threshold may be
satisÔ¨Åed under any vehicle density environment.
H. Evaluation When Increasing Malicious Vehicles
We believe that we can improve our proposed system by
increasing the number of malicious vehicles and setting the
threshold value to 5. When the number of malicious vehicles
is increased, the false positives are shown in Figure 19, and
20. In both T109 and IEEE802.11p, the amount of the false
positives did not change even when the malicious vehicles are
increased because Ô¨Åve regular vehicles were included in the
communication targets (peripheral vehicles). Therefore, even
ian increase in the number of malicious vehicles increases did
not affect the false positives of regular vehicles. Unfortunately,
this result is not good.
In our proposed method, all communicating vehicles are
regarded as peripheral vehicles that can guarantee their own
position information. Even if there are malicious vehicles in the
position information, no problem occurs as long as a threshold
number of regular vehicles exists. For example, we assume that
a certain vehicle communicates with 20 peripheral vehicles.
When 15 out of 20 units are malicious, should this vehicle be
trusted by the cloud? Although the present system is supposed
to trusted ism, more than half of the surrounding vehicles are
probably malicious. In other words, even though a malicious
vehicle may be correctly identiÔ¨Åed, we can accept a majority of
the opinions. This inÔ¨Çuence increases the number of vehicles
that are identiÔ¨Åed as malicious.
I.
Measurement of Processing Time in Our Proposal
In the evaluation environment shown in Table VI, the
processing time necessary for the detection of masqueraded
data is evaluated by Table VII and Table VIII, based on the
Ô¨Çowchart of Figure 8. It shows the processing time for one
vehicle. By using BSIDs, masqueraded data can be detected
at the beginning of processing by the proposed method, and

the processing time becomes relatively fast. In the detection
method using PVIDs, the processing time is different for each
threshold. By increasing the threshold value, the detection
procedure of masqueraded data by PVID is repeated. Even
during the repetition, since the processing time changes de-
pending on whether comparative data can be found relatively
early or in the Ô¨Ånal stage, a range was set for the processing
time up to Step 4. A case where no masqueraded data is not
detected is deÔ¨Åned as normal termination, and the upper limit
of the processing time at that threshold is indicated. As the
threshold of our proposed method increases, the processing
time required for normal termination increases. Furthermore,

we conÔ¨Årmed that the processing time varies depending on
the type of database. As a result of calculating the evaluation
under the same condition, we found that MySQL is faster in
processing time than posgreSQL.
J. Overall Processing Time
In previous subsection V-I, we showed the processing time
in our proposed method, especially the processing time in
Figure 8‚Äôs step 4. If we operate our system in reality, the overall
processing time will be as follows.
Tall = T1 + T2 + T3
(1)
Tall : Overall processing time
T1 : Delay time of V2C communication
T2 : Database access time
T3 : Processing time in my proposal
Table VII or VIII which is calculated in the previous sub-
section corresponds to T2, T3. When we consider the total
processing time, we need to consider the delay time of V2C
communication. We must determine the threshold values based
on the V2C communication delay and the allowable range of
the delay times of safe driving support systems.
VI.
FUTURE WORK
In this section, considering the evaluation result of the
previous section we describe what kind of research we will
do in the future.
A. Determination of the Appropriate Threshold
The threshold value we set is the number of loops in Figure
8, that is, the number of peripheral vehicles required for a cloud
to trust. If we do not decide the appropriate value, our proposed
system will not be realistic. Considering the false positive
problem, we devise two methods of determining thresholds.

Figure 22. Example when introducing vehicle weighting
1)
We weight the public vehicles and trust more on the
cloud even for vehicles below the threshold.
2)
We dynamicaly determination of threshold value with
consideration of vehicle density.
1)This good result (Figure 15, 18) only applies in the urban
area. We need to take another measure under the environment
of Japanese average car density. And also we must consider
the lesser nighttime of car streets and the lower density
environment. Figure 21 shows our new countermeasure to the
false positive. We give weight to public vehicles such as police
vehicles and buses than normal vehicles. Even if the vehicle
communicating with the public vehicle (that is, the vehicle
including the public vehicle in peripheral vehicle information)
does not exceed the threshold value, this one is trusted by a
cloud. We consider the environment such a Figure 22. In the
case the threshold required for the cloud to trust is 5. Vehicle
A has only three peripheral vehicles. But because there are a
police vehicle in them, a cloud trusts vehicle A. We think that
this method will reduce the false positive if public vehicles are
running even in low vehicle density areas.
2)Based on the results (Figure 14,15), we calculate vehicle
density for each base station and change the threshold value
for each base station. Figure 23 shows the overall picture.

Figure 24. Use example of peripheral pedestrian information in V2P
communication
Since vehicle information is transmitted to the cloud via a
base station, we think that we can calculate the car density
inside the base station.
B. Increase in Communication Target
In this research vehicles only communicated with a cloud
and other vehicles. There is vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) or
vehicle-to-device (V2D) communication in V2X communica-
tion. If pedestrians can access a LDM with their smartphones,
vehicles can mutually monitor the position information by
communicating with the device of the pedestrian. Research
that pedestrians can easily access LDM exists [11], so we
can realize it by using just information exchanged with V2P
communication. Figure 24 indicates the example of periph-
eral pedestrian information in V2P communication. Vehicle
A communicating with pedestrian Pe1, vehicle A gets the
peripheral pedestrian ID (PPID). Then vehicle A send these
information to a cloud. A cloud can judge whether to trust also
from information other than peripheral vehicle information. We
think that we can further improve our proposed system.
However there is a problem that the amount of information
transmitted by vehicles to a cloud increases, and another
problem is how to set a threshold value. People can possess
multiple smartphones simultaneously, so the importance of
PPID is lower than PVID. We also need to consider those
who use malicious behavior with smartphones.
VII.
CONCLUSION
In the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), using cloud
servers is inevitable. For providing a safe driving support
service using cloud servers, masquerading vehicle information
and spooÔ¨Ång a vehicle are threatening. In this research, we
used V2X communication, obtained information from various
objects, and described measures against data masquerade.
We proposed a method that detects masqueraded data from
information transmitted by vehicles to cloud servers. By using
information of relay base stations in V2C communication
and peripheral vehicle‚Äôs information in V2V communication,

and our measures are taken against masquerading vehicle
information. By increasing our proposed method‚Äôs threshold,
the detection rates of masqueraded data were improved and
vehicle information was made more reliable. Our proposed
method can be adapted to depopulated regions by changing
the amount of data of peripheral vehicle information required
as the detection rates improve based on car densities. In
overcrowded vehicle areas, we conÔ¨Årmed that our proposed
method works most effectively because there were many pe-
ripheral vehicles satisfying the threshold. Further we conÔ¨Årmed
that the proposed method works well without problems even
under different propagation environment schemes (T109 or
IEEE802.11p). False positive problems are our future tasks and
we are also considering processing time improved. For future
research I would like to conduct a demonstration experiment
that also cooperated with LDM.
