Abstract—Inspired by the ﬂocking behavior, we propose a dis-
tributed transmit power control (TPC) algorithm for maximizing
the end-to-end rate in a linear multi-hop wireless network. As
each bird in ﬂock goes to match its velocity with the average
velocity of its neighbors in a distributed manner, each node on
the multi-hop path matches its transmission rate with the average
transmission rate of its neighbor nodes by controlling its transmit
power. We verify that this TPC algorithm performing a local rate-
average strategy maximizes the end-to-end rate of the wireless
multi-hop link. Simulation results show that as with the ﬂocking
algorithm, the proposed TPC algorithm enables all link rates to
converge to the same value, and also signiﬁcantly decreases the
power consumption of multi-hop nodes, while maximizing the
multi-hop end-to-end rate.

INTRODUCTION
In multi-hop networks, an increase in the number of hops
improves each link budget, but generates more trafﬁc in the
network. This eventually increases the access collision and
interference levels and so degrades the multi-hop end-to-end
performance [1]. The most effective method for breaking
through this trade-off is a transmit power control (TPC) that
controls the transmit power of multi-hop nodes in order to
mitigate the strong interference while ensuring a reasonable
link budget [2].
The typical TPC algorithms in wireless multi-hop networks
are mainly based on the condition of individual links [3]-
[10]. In [3]-[5], the minimum transmit power level is used
to guarantee the signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR)
required at the receiving node depending on the quality of
service (QoS) of the transmitted packets, aiming at achieving
not only interference mitigation but also power saving. In [6]
and [7], the transmit power is controlled based on the packet
size. The greater is the packet size, the higher is the packet
error rate (PER); the transmit power increases with an increase
in the packet size. In [8], the transmit power is determined
based on the channel state information (CSI) to maintain a
constant bit error rate (BER) at the receiver. In [9], the transmit
power for control packets increases to prevent interference
from hidden nodes in the IEEE 802.11 system. In [10], a
common power level is determined from the perspective of
the overall network capacity in order to guarantee the rates of
bi-directional links.
The objective of typical TPC algorithms in wireless multi-
hop networks is mostly to minimize the transmit power con-
sumption while ensuring the given QoS (i.e., SINR or BER)
of each individual link on the multi-hop path [2]. Such a
power minimization problem subject to the constant SINR
requirement can guarantee the required end-to-end rate of a
multi-hop link, but cannot maximize it, because the achievable
maximum SINR value that maximizes the end-to-end rate of
a given multi-hop link is unknown. This achievable maximum
SINR value varies depending on the transmit power of each
multi-hop node due to the mutual interference among wireless
links. Therefore, the transmit powers of all nodes should
be considered jointly to maximize the end-to-end rate in
a given inter-link interference situation. However, this joint
TPC operation requires a complex calculation and causes a
signiﬁcant overhead for sharing information among all nodes
to determine the optimal transmission power in each node [1].
To solve such a complex optimization problem, in this
paper, we pay attention to a biological system known as the
ﬂocking behavior, which is exhibited when a group of birds,
called a ﬂock, are foraging or in ﬂight. Flocks behave with
a very simple rule in complex, unstructured, and dynamically
changing environments, but they show a emergent behavior
achieving their common goal robustly and efﬁciently. By
understanding the similarities between the ﬂocking behav-
ior and the wireless multi-hop transmission, we adapt the
underlying principles of the ﬂocking behavior to the TPC
algorithm in wireless multi-hop networks. As the ﬂocking
algorithm operates in simple and distributed manners and
shows converged phenomena, the proposed bio-inspired TPC
(BiTPC) algorithm follows a low-complex operation without a
centralized controller and converges to maximize the end-to-
end rate in the considered linear multi-hop network.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II,
we describe the optimization problem for maximizing the
end-to-end rate in the linear multi-hop wireless network. In
Section III, we introduce the ﬂocking behavior and mention
its properties. In Section IV, we explain the proposed BiTPC
algorithm in detail. In Section V, we investigate the optimality
of the proposed BiTPC algorithm. In Section VI, we discuss

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
Fig. 1 shows a considered linear multi-hop wireless net-
work consisting of n hops from a source to a destination. Here,
we deﬁne some notation, as follows:
•
Pi: transmit power of node i
•
Ni: noise power at node i
•
Ii: interference power received at node i
•
gij: channel gain from node i to node j
•
SINRij: SINR from node i to node j
•
Rij: link rate from node i to node j
By max-ﬂow min-cut theorem, the end-to-end rate from the
source node to the destination node is determined by the
smallest value of the link rates in the multi-hop [11]. Therefore,
it is deﬁned as
Re2e := min{R12, R23, · · · , Rn(n+1)}.
(1)
Our objective is to obtain the transmit powers of all the
transmitting nodes that maximize the end-to-end rate Re2e.
This is described as the following optimization problem:

given by P
∀k̸=i,j Pkgkj as the sum of interferences from
other transmitting nodes that use the same radio resource.
Here, we assume that all nodes use the same resource without
considering a particular scheduling because our main purpose
is to show the applicability of the proposed BiTPC algorithm
under the inter-link interference condition. In this context, we
also assume that the relay node is a full-duplex relay; therefore,
it is possible to receive and transmit packets simultaneously
without self-interference and processing delay [12]. It should
be noted that the considered optimization problem is com-
plicated to solve directly (i.e., it is not convex) because the
transmit power of each node affects all link rates.

FLOCKING BEHAVIOR
Flocking
represents
the
phenomenon
in
which
self-
propelled individuals organize into an ordered motion by using
only limited environmental information and simple rules. For
example, a ﬂock of birds whose members are moving in
R3 shows that the state of the ﬂock converges to one in
which all birds ﬂy with the same velocity. The simple rule of
this ﬂocking behavior is known that each bird autonomously
adjusts its velocity according to the velocities of its neighbors.
The recent representative Cucker-Smale ﬂocking model [13]
explains the ﬂocking behavior, that is, at time t and for bird
i, every bird adjusts its velocity vi as follows:
vi(t + 1) − vi(t) = λ
N
N
X
j=1
ψ(|xj − xi|)(vj − vi)
(6)
where N is the number of birds, λ is a coupling strength
as a learning parameter, and xi is the position of bird i. ψ
means a communication range function which can be set to
ψ(|xj −xi|) = 1 only in case of |xj −xi| ≤ r. So, this ﬂocking
rule can be interpreted as a local averaging algorithm for bird
velocity. In addition, Cucker-Smale ﬂocking model ensures
that an interacting N-particle system {(xi(t), vi(t))}N
i=1 has
time-asymptotic convergence properties, as follows: [13], [14]
1) Velocity alignment:
lim
t→∞ |vi(t) − vj(t)| = 0,
for ∀i ̸= j.
(7)
2) Formation of a group:
sup
0≤t<∞
|xi(t) − xj(t)| < ∞,
for ∀i ̸= j.
(8)
Then, why do birds ﬂock together? There are a variety of
reasons, such as foraging, mating, navigation, protection from
predators, etc. Among them, one theory is that in coordinated
ﬂight of birds, there is an aerodynamic advantage to ﬂying
behind [15]. As a front bird moves its wings up and down,
a strong current of air is created and ﬂows backward. This
moving wave of air uplifts the bird behind it. That is, each
bird ﬂying ahead creates an air wave that helps the bird ﬂying
behind it. This cooperation reduces the energy consumption
of birds and thus allows them to arrive faster at their destina-
tion [16]. Because of these aerodynamic interactions, the best
way for a bird group to arrive at the destination as soon as
possible without straggling (i.e., to maximize the minimum
bird speed) is to cooperate with each other in a way that the
speedy birds ﬂy in front of the tardy birds. As a result, this
cooperation makes all birds ﬂy at the same velocity. Therefore,
it is noticed that the ﬂocking algorithm equalizing all the birds’
velocity can be an appropriate solution to achieve the goal of
bird ﬂock.
IV.
PROPOSED BIO-INSPIRED TRANSMIT POWER
CONTROL ALGORITHM
Both the multi-hop transmission and the ﬂocking behavior
have the objective function of the max-min type. Moreover,
the ﬂocking algorithm is a basically simple and distributed ap-
proach and has the convergence properties. Considering these
similarity and advantages, we adapt the ﬂocking algorithm to
the TPC algorithm for the wireless multi-hop transmission.

Similar to the ﬂocking algorithm, we equalize the link rates
by adjusting the transmit power of each node. That is to say,
the proposed BiTPC algorithm controls the transmit power of
each node in such a way to equalize all the link rates (i.e.,
R12 = R23 = · · · = Rn(n+1)). Because the rate of link ij,
Rij, is related to the transmit powers of all the other nodes
(Pk, ∀k ̸= i, j) as well as to the transmit power of node i (Pi),
the control of one node’s transmit power inﬂuences all the
other nodes’ rates, and this requires an iteration to obtain the
ﬁnal equal rate value. At each step, each node recognizes the
rate value of its neighboring nodes and uses the average of the
recognized rate values as its next target rate, as each bird in the
ﬂock matches its velocity with its neighboring birds repeatedly
in a distributed manner. Thereafter, each transmitting node de-
cides the transmit power to achieve the target rate individually.
This distributed local rate-average operation is repeated until
all the link rates converge to the same value.
The ﬂow chart of the proposed BiTPC algorithm is shown
in Fig. 2, and its detailed operation follows these steps:
1)
All the transmitting nodes set the initial transmit
power to the maximum transmit power Pmax.
2)
The transmitting node i sends the packet to its receiv-
ing node j by using the transmit power Pi(t) decided
for time t.
3)
Upon receiving the packet, the receiving node j mea-
sures its SINRij and feeds it back to its transmitting
node i.
4)
On the basis of the SINR feedback, the transmitting
node i calculates its current link rate as Rij(t) =
log2(1 + SINRij(t)).
5)
Each transmitting node shares the information of
Rij(t) or SINRij(t) with its neighboring nodes. Note
that the rate and SINR can be converted to each
other. As a candidate sharing method, the overhearing
technique is possible [17]. With this technique, the
node overhears the SINR feedback or the transmitted
modulation and coding set (MCS) information of
the adjacent nodes; therefore, these information of
adjacent links can be shared among nodes without
additional signalling for sharing.
6)
The next target rate Rij(t + 1) is determined as the
average value of the recognized adjacent link rates,
as follows:
Rij(t + 1) − Rij(t) =
1
η

∀k,l=k+1
ψ(|xk − xi|) (Rkl(t) − Rij(t)) (9)
⇒ Rij(t + 1) = 1

(10)
where η is the total number of neighbor links whose
rate information is shared. The communication range
function ψ(|xk−xi|) = 1 if the node k is the neighbor
of the node i and the node k’s rate information is
shared. Otherwise, ψ(|xk − xi|) = 0.
7)
If the next target rate Rij(t + 1) has little difference
with the current target rate Rij(t) (i.e., Rij(t + 1) −
Rij(t) ≤ ϵ where ϵ > 0 is small enough), Pi(t) is
determined to be the ﬁnal transmit power and the
iteration ends. Otherwise, from (4) and (5), the next

PROOF OF OPTIMALITY
The rate set of wireless links that use the same radio
resource at the same time affect each other owing to their
mutual interference [18]. Therefore, as expressed in (4), it is
always possible to increase the rate of one link at the expense
of another. We call this property solidarity and deﬁne it as
follow.
Deﬁnition 1 (Solidarity Property): A subset X of Rn has
a solidarity property if and only if for all i ∈ {1, 2, · · · , n},
for all x ∈ X where the i-th element xi > 0, and for all
0 < αi < ϵ where ϵ > 0 is small enough, the variation of
xi, xi ± αi, induces variations of the other elements, xj ∓ αj
for ∀j ̸= i and 0 < αj < ϵ, and the changed vector y =
x ± αiei ∓ P
∀j̸=i αjej where ei is a unit vector still belongs
to X.
According to the deﬁnition of the solidarity property, we
state the following proposition and prove it in order to verify
that the proposed BiTPC algorithm is an optimal solution to
maximize the end-to-end rate of the wireless multi-hop link.
Proposition 1: If a set X has the solidarity property, then
the max-min fair vector x ∈ X has all components equal,

that is, xi = xj for ∀i, j when the minimum value of x is
maximized.
Proof: Suppose the contrary that there exists a max-min
fair vector x, such that xi ̸= xj for some i ̸= j on X with
the solidarity property. Let xi be the largest component of x.
Then, for sufﬁciently small ϵ such that 0 < ϵ < minj{xi−xj},
we have
xi > xj + ϵ for ∀j ̸= i.
(12)
According to the deﬁnition of the solidarity property, for 0 <
αi, αj < ϵ, we can ﬁnd another vector y ∈ X such that
y = x − αiei +
X
∀j̸=i
αjej.
(13)
That is, yi = xi − αi and yj = xj + αj for ∀j ̸= i. This
satisﬁes yi > xi − ϵ > xj and yj > xj for ∀j ̸= i. Therefore,
all elements of y are greater than xj, i.e.,
max{min(y)} > max{min(x)} = xj
(14)
which contradicts the supposition that x is the max-min fair
vector.
The rate set of links consisting of the wireless multi-
hop link has the solidarity property. Moreover, the multi-
hop end-to-end rate is determined by the minimum link rate.
Consequently, from Proposition 1, the multi-hop end-to-end
rate is maximized when all the link rates are equal. Therefore,
the proposed BiTPC algorithm, which controls the transmit
power of each node in such a way as to equalize all the link
rates, maximizes the end-to-end rate of the multi-hop link.
VI.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We consider a one-way linear multi-hop wireless network,
as shown in Fig. 1. Table I shows the simulation parameters.
The distance between the source node and the destination node
is ﬁxed as 1000 m and the number of transmission hops is
varied by controlling the number of relay nodes between them.
The relay node is deployed randomly on the line connecting the
source node with the destination node, and the requirement of
the minimum distance between the nodes is 10 m. The default
information-sharing range is 2 hops, within which the nodes
can share their rate or the SINR value. The maximum power is
set to 23 dBm and the path loss follows the 3GPP evaluation
parameter [19]. For comparison, we consider a scheme using
the maximum equal power without TPC and the SINR-based
TPC algorithm with several target SINR values [3]-[5].
Fig. 3 shows the rate of each link and the transmit power of
each node according to the iteration of the proposed algorithm
at one topology. Here, we assume that the iteration process
is stopped if the Euclidean length of a transmission power

vector P (i.e., norm of P) is less than 10−2. Note that this
convergence check corresponds to a tight condition because
in practical systems, set of possible bit rate is determined
by several MCS levels. Therefore, the convergence speed can
be improved further by relaxing the convergence condition
especially in case that the channel variation and node mobility
become more dynamic. As the iteration proceeds, the link
rates converge, but the transmit powers become different and
bounded. From the perspective of convergence, the simulation
results have showed that limt→∞ |Ri(t) − Rj(t)| = 0 for
∀i ̸= j and sup0≤t<∞ |Pi(t)−Pj(t)| < Pmax for ∀i ̸= j. This
is caused by the fact that the proposed BiTPC algorithm limits
the maximum transmission power. Accordingly, the BiTPC
algorithm shows the similar convergence properties to the
ﬂocking algorithm, as shown in (7) and (8).
Upon convergence, the node that initially had the best
link rate (i.e., node 7) shows the lowest transmit power, and
the node that initially had the worst link rate (i.e., node 3)
maintains the maximum transmit power. That is, the nodes
with good link quality reduce their transmit power, but the
nodes with bad link quality maintain or slightly reduce their
transmit power, in order to equalize all link rates. It should be
noted that the ﬁnal transmit power is inversely proportional to
the initial link rate.
Fig. 4 shows the number of iterations needed for conver-
gence, according to the number of transmission hops and the
number of sharing hops. As the number of hops increases,
the number of iterations increases exponentially because an
increase in the number of nodes means that more time is
required to equalize all the link rates. Moreover, as the number
of sharing hops increases, the convergence becomes faster.
This is because the increase in the number of sharing hops
offers more adjacent link rates for averaging.
Fig. 5 shows the performance of the multi-hop end-to-end
rate versus the number of transmission hops. The proposed
BiTPC algorithm outperforms the scheme using the maximum
equal power without TPC and the SINR-based TPC with a
target SINR (γ) ﬁxed at 0, 3, or 10 dBm. This is because

the proposed TPC algorithm dynamically achieves a SINR
value that maximizes the end-to-end throughput, while the
SINR-based TPC algorithm achieves a static target SINR. As
the number of hops increases, the end-to-end rate increases
sharply, but eventually decreases and maintains a constant level
in both schemes. The increase in the number of hops initially
improves the link budget and thus enhances the end-to-end
rate, but the excessive number of hops causes more interference
and degrades the end-to-end rate. This implies that not only
the optimal TPC but also the optimal selection of transmission
hops is required for maximizing the end-to-end rate in the
given multi-hop environment.

consumption of all the transmitting nodes (i.e., the sum of the
transmission power of each node) versus the number of trans-
mission hops. The scheme without TPC uses a ﬁxed maximum

increases linearly according to the number of hops. On the
other hand, the SINR-based and the proposed TPC algorithms
use decreased transmission power. Particularly, the proposed
BiTPC reduces the transmit power adaptively depending on the
increase of interference due to the increased number of hops,
and therefore, it exhibits very low power consumption. Note
that the SINR-based TPC shows a tradeoff in performance
between the end-to-end throughput and the total transmission
power consumption according to the target SINR value.

CONCLUSION
Inspired by the ﬂocking algorithm, we proposed the BiTPC
algorithm, which determines the transmit powers of nodes that
equalize all the link rates on the multi-hop path. We proved
that this rate-averaging algorithm is an optimal solution to
maximize the multi-hop end-to-end rate in wireless networks
with the solidarity property. The simulation results showed
that the proposed BiTPC algorithm has the converged perfor-
mances, regardless of the number of transmission hops and the
information-sharing range, and leads to signiﬁcant energy sav-
ings at the transmitting nodes by adjusting the transmit powers.
Since the BiTPC algorithm is basically simple, distributed, and
optimal, we expect that it will be practically used in complex
and unstructured network environments. For further study, we
will extend the basic concept of our BiTPC algorithm in the
linear topology to the environment where multi-ﬂow exists in
the two-dimensional multi-hop topology.
