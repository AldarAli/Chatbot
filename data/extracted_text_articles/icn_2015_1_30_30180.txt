Abstract—Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSANs) refer
to a class of unattended wireless networks whose goal is to
provide communication between distributed applications that
perform the monitoring and control of certain characteristics of
an environment. Among the vast number of WSANs applications,
we focus on those designed to the natural disaster monitoring,
such as forest ﬁre control. It is therefore essential that the routing
algorithms for these applications provide adequate scalability,
reliability and energy efﬁciency. In addition, considering large-
scale scenarios and the absence of direct communication between
actuators, the message delivery reliability, fundamental for the
mutual coordination of actuators, is a requirement not fully
supported by the existing protocols. In order to cope with
this shortcoming, in this paper we propose a novel Border-
Oriented-Forward routing protocol (BOFP) for WSANs with
support to actuator-sensor-actuator communication. We carried
out simulations to attest the BOFP performance according to
three metrics: the goodput, the overall end-to-end delivery delay
and the energy consumption. The results of the simulations
were statistically analyzed and suggested that BOFP satisﬁed the
requirements of large-scale WSANs.

INTRODUCTION
Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSANs) have
appeared as an extension of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)
in which the actuation tasks can be performed directly in a
monitored environment. Such networks usually operate unat-
tended and are composed by a set of heterogeneous devices
mainly equipped with microprocessors, wireless communi-
cation adapters, sensors and actuation mechanisms. These
devices may play particular roles in the ﬁeld, such as data
gathering that is performed by low-cost devices, named sensor
nodes. In this case, the desired condition of the environment is
maintained by more complex and expensive devices known as
actuators nodes. A substantial number of WSANs applications
can be enumerated, as, e.g., precision agriculture, natural disas-
ter monitoring, tracking and location in hospital environments,
home, industrial automation and so on [1].
In particular, applications intended to monitoring large
geographical areas demand a large number of sensor nodes.
In such cases, the actuators density might be much lower than
the sensor nodes density, primarily due to the cost of actuator
nodes. In large-scale unattended WSAN applications, e.g., the
forest ﬁre control or the landslide monitoring, the coordination
between the actuator nodes can be considered essential [2].
Moreover, in these speciﬁc applications, a common assumption
is to consider that actuators can communicate directly to each
other. However, in such a scenario, the communications are
subject to fail due to either obstacles or long distances between
the actuators. Therefore, the network scalability is limited by
the maximum communication range of the wireless adapter of
the actuators. For this reason, routing protocols designed for
large-scale WSANs must be scalable and also to provide both
appropriate efﬁciency of energy consumption and adequate
reliability on message delivery.
One can ﬁnd several WSAN routing protocols in the
literature that may be in line with some of the aforementioned
requirements [3]–[13]. However, among them, the on-demand
gradient-based routing protocol (DGR) [11]
was specially
designed to provide communication between actuators, named
Actuator-Sensor-Actuator Communication (ASAC), by deﬁn-
ing routing paths linking the set of sensor nodes. However, due
to its on-demand feature, the DGR may not achieve satisfac-
tory overall data delivery reliability and energy conservation
required for some WSAN applications.
In line with this shortcoming, in this paper, we present
a new routing protocol, named Border-oriented routing pro-
tocol (BOFP), specially designed to large-scale WSANs with
support to ASAC communication. The BOFP is a gradient-
based protocol that organizes the sensor nodes in levels and
deﬁnes some of them as the relays of the actuators messages.
Therefore, the BOFP automatically delimits broadcast regions
in the network by deﬁning special sensor nodes, located
in border of the regions, each of them here named Border
Node (BN). The BNs have as main task to establish routing
paths between two or more actuator nodes. However, the BNs
can also prevent the propagation of broadcast of messages
(broadcast storm) outside the delimited regions, consequently,
reducing the overall intra-network collision rate.
For assessing the performance of the BOFP, we carried
out simulations considering different scenarios. Moreover, we
compared the results of the BOFP with those from DGR
with regard to their energy consumption efﬁciency, delay and
message delivery reliability considering the event detection and
ASAC data trafﬁcs. Consequently, the results achieved by the
BOFP outperformed those achieved by the DGR protocol.
The remaining sections of this paper are organized as
follows. In the next section, we brieﬂy present the protocols
closely related to the proposed strategy. Section III presents
the BOFP speciﬁcation and the WSAN model employed in
this study. The performance evaluation of the BOFP and the
results are presented in Section IV. To sum up, we conclude
the paper by presenting some ﬁnal remarks in Section V.

RELATED WORK
Most of the existent protocols [3]–[6] [8]–[10] [12] [13],
which have some relation to the objective of the present study,
use a central controller to conﬁgure or coordinate the overall
operation of the network. Consequently, these protocols have
scalability limitations and may not be suitable for large-scale
WSANs. Differently, the BOFP, proposed in this paper, makes
use of a distributed algorithm in which the network operation is
decentralized and the communication between sensors and the
actuators occur locally, with sensors within their neighborhood.
Besides, with exception of the study introduced in [8], the
protocols earlier cited in this section do not consider ASAC.
Additionally, in spite of using ASAC, the protocol proposed in
[8] assumes the existence of a speciﬁc hardware for directional
antennas and the knowledge of the geographic location of
nodes both not regarded in this paper.
To the best of our knowledge and considering only the
routing protocols designed for WSANs, the approach most
related to this work is the DGR, proposed by Guo et al. [11].
The operation of the DGR starts with the dynamic gradient
setup phase, where announcement messages (ADV) are prop-
agated, hop-by-hop, from each actuator to all sensor nodes. In
this phase, all sensor nodes in the network calculate a k value
that will correspond to a cost gradient. Added to this k, an
energy gradient s and a balance coefﬁcient α deﬁne a backoff
timer tb that depending on its value, it reveals whether or not
a sensor node will belong to a routing path. Accordingly, in
the case that an actuator is supposed to perform an ASAC,
and from it there does not exist a routing path, it initiates a
routing path establishment phase. The actuator broadcasts a
transmission-request message (TR) and waits for the response
of the sensor nodes.
Each sensor node that received the TR calculates its tb that
is the required backoff timer for response. Since the tb value
is inﬂuenced by the residual energy of the sensor node, the
node with the largest amount of residual energy and that is
the nearest (has the smallest k) to the destination provides
the lowest tb and, consequently, answers ﬁrst. The answer
message is called transmission-agreement message (TA). The
source of the TA message is then warned, by the actuator, that
will become part of the routing path and does the same steps
of the actuator, by broadcasting a TR to its neighbors, to ﬁnd
the next hop to the destination. This process is repeated until a
TR reaches the destination. From this point on, data messages
can be sent by the source actuator to the destination through
the routing path found.
The DGR relies on the assumption of the existence of
high trafﬁc between the actuator nodes. Consequently, by just
considering the actuator activities, the DGR protocol does not
explicitly consider the inﬂuence of the data trafﬁc generated by
the sensor nodes for constructing the routing paths between the
actuators. In the DGR, routing paths are built without taking
into account the distance between the nodes involved in a
point-to-point transmission. This can reduce the chances of
transmission success leading to a decrease in the reliability of
data delivery in large-scale networks.
Bearing all these limitations pointed up in the DGR in
mind, we developed the BOFP.
III.
PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION
In this paper, we introduce the BOFP that overcomes some
limitations pointed up in the previous section. As well as the
DGR, the BOFP builds routing paths for the communication
between actuators through the set of sensor nodes. Unlike the
DGR, in our proposal we assume that monitoring applications
for event detection produce low trafﬁc between actuators, and
this trafﬁc is active only when critical events are detected.
Another difference between the BOFP and the DGR is with
respect to the routing path establishment. In the DGR, routing
paths are established on-demand while in the BOFP they are
established only at the beginning of the protocol operation.
Additionally, the BOFP uses a threshold of Received Signal
Strength Indicator (RSSI) to determine the maximum distance
that a node can have in relation to the transmitter, to make part
of a routing path. Thereby, the BOFP allows the adjustment of
the RSSI threshold in order to maintain the reliability of data
delivery in adequate levels.
A. The WSAN model and Assumptions
In this paper, we consider a stationary and unattended
WSAN composed by a set of actuator nodes and a set of sensor
nodes unaware about their geographic location coordinates.
The set of sensor nodes is homogeneous with regard to the
hardware and software capabilities. Accordingly, the sensor
nodes are equipped with the same radio device in which the
transmission power is not dynamically adjustable. All actuator
nodes are homogeneous in hardware and software capabilities
and use the same transmission power of sensor nodes for short
range communication. Although actuator nodes are assumed to
be more powerful than sensor nodes, we consider that, due to
the long distances implied in large-scale WSANs, any of them
does not directly transmit messages to other actuator.
Nevertheless, for the source and the destination identiﬁca-
tion, we assume that every node (sensor or actuator) is assigned
to an unique identity, as MAC address. Additionally, each
sensor node keeps a routing table where each entry indicates
the next hop and the distance (in hops) to a speciﬁc actuator
node. Thus, we consider that each sensor node will always
send data messages to the closest actuator node, related to
the entry in the routing table with the smallest distance to
it. Finally, we also consider that all nodes do not need to be
clock synchronized. Taking this WSAN model into account,
we specify the introduced protocol in the next section.
B. The BOFP General Operation
The proposed protocol has a two-phase approach con-
sisting of a startup phase (S-Phase) and a communication
phase (C-Phase). The S-Phase comprises the execution of
two asynchronous distributed procedures with the purpose of
discovering routing paths from sensor nodes to actuators and
from actuators to actuators.
The ﬁrst procedure, here called Node-to-Actuator Discov-
ery Path Procedure (N2A-DP), is executed at the beginning of
the S-Phase. In this procedure, each actuator node broadcasts
a Route Discovery Message (RDM) to all sensor nodes in its
communication range. The RDM carries a tuple of three integer
values: the level counter (lc) initially set to zero, the unique
source sensor node identity (snid) and the actuator unique
identity (aid). All RDM sent by actuator nodes have the snid
13

set to zero. At this point, in the S-Phase, all sensor nodes
execute the Algorithm 1.
It is important to notice that, according to the proposed
algorithm, a given sensor node accepts a received message if
and only if the Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of the received
message, m.rssi, is above a speciﬁc threshold value γ . The
value for γ is considered variable and deﬁned according to
the application requirements. After receiving and accepting a
RDM, say m, a sensor node veriﬁes whether or not the received
aid, m.aid, matches some aid in the routing table entry set
(RT). In the ﬁrst case, if the received lc value is smaller than
the lc value stored in the RT, it updates its RT entry related to
the aid with the received values of lc and snid. In the second
case, the sensor node includes the received values in the RT.
Afterwards, each sensor node, receiver of m, generates and
broadcasts a replica of m, say m’, which carries the following
information: a lc’ with the value of lc increased by one; and
both the aid and the snid are set as the sensor node own
identity. This process is repeated by every sensor node receiver
of m or its replicas. Therefore, the lc stored in any entry of
RT indicates how far (in hops) the sensor node is from a given
actuator node.
Notwithstanding, regarding to distinct lc values of aid
entries stored in the RT, RT.aid.lc, a sensor node may ﬁnd
similar values of the received lc, m.lc.Here we deﬁne similar
as those RT.aid.lc that differ at most by one to the value of
the received lc. Whenever a sensor node ﬁnds similar values
of a received lc in the RT, it becomes a border node (BN) of
the actuator of the received lc and of every distinct actuator
whose lc is similar in the RT. As a matter of fact, the following
steps with regard to the BN happens for every actuator whose
lc is similar to the received lc. However, the operations are
pairwise, being one of the pairs always the source of the
received lc. By considering one of these pairs of actuators
(represented by the received aid and the aid stored in RT),
from the point it is deﬁned as BN on, the sensor node stops
the RDM propagation and starts a complementary Actuator-
to-Actuator path Discovery Procedure (A2A-DP).
In the A2A-DP, each BN sends two Actuator-to-actuator
Route Discovery Messages (ARDMs) via unicast to the pairs
of actuators (m.aid, RT.aid). On the one hand, the ARDM for
the actuator m.aid contains the information of the distance
in hops between the BN and the actuator RT.aid. On the
other hand, the ARDM for the actuator RT.aid contains the
information regarding the distance in hops between the BN and
the actuator m.aid. The ARDM has a very similar structure
to the RDM. The sensor nodes in the path from the BN to the
actuator m.aid (or RT.aid) will handle the ARDM as they did
with the RDM by including in their RT the distance and the
next hop to the actuator RT.aid (or m.aid) and by increasing
the values of lc in the ARDM for
every retransmission.
Immediately after receiving the ARDM, both actuators store
the next hop and the distance to each other in their RT. It is
worth mentioning that, for a given path between two actuators,
there will be always only one BN. Considering a path between
two actuators whose number of sensor nodes is even, two
sensor nodes are candidate to be BN. But, is this case, the ﬁrst
candidate sensor node to become BN will stop the propagation
of the RDM. Consequently, the second candidate sensor node
will not receive the corresponding RDM.

Finally, in the C-Phase, sensor nodes and actuators are able
to send data messages. In the C-phase we consider two types
of unicast data messages: the Sensor-to-actuator Data Message
(SDM) and the Actuator-to-actuator Data Message (ADM). As
stated before, the SDMs are transmitted, from sensor nodes,
through the shortest path to their nearest actuator. Differently,
the ADMs include the aids of both source and destination
actuators.
IV.
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
For evaluating the performance of the BOFP, we propose
three metrics: end-to-end delay, energy consumption and good-
put. The main reason behind the use of these speciﬁc metrics
14

ICN 2015 : The Fourteenth International Conference on Networks

is the overall assessment of the proposed protocol mainly
by means of energy conservation efﬁciency and reliability
on message delivery. Each of these assessment measures,
simulation parameters, scenarios and performance evaluation
results are gone into detail in the next sections.
A. Simulation Models, Scenarios and Parameters
We compared the performances of the BOFP, its variations,
and the DGR into three extents of square sensing areas,
representing small, moderate and large-scaled scenarios, as
we can observe in the summary of the simulation parameters
indicated in Tables I and II. Additionally, for each sensing
area we set different numbers of nodes. We also consider that
the application periodically senses the environment, at every
ﬁve seconds, and depending on the simulation purpose, it may
generate one data message whenever it detects an event.
Table I summarizes the parameters for the ﬁrst simulation
model designed to assess the performance of both protocols
with respect to the event detection. We conﬁgured two static
events to be activated in two non simultaneous periods of 50
seconds during the execution of the simulation. The sensor
nodes were uniformly placed in the ﬁeld while the actuator
nodes were arbitrarily placed out of the communication range
of each other. We set the sensors nodes in the DGR to send
messages to their closest actuator. To better assess the impact
of the main differential of BOFP, the BN nodes, in addition
to the DGR Protocol, we also modeled simpliﬁed version
of the BOFP, here named Simple Gradient Protocol (SGP).
This simpliﬁed version of the BOFP has the same procedures
developed in the BOFP, however, without the BNs. Therefore,
the SGP uses the same implementation of the gradient based
level count as well as all the discovery procedures used in
the BOFP without the limitation of broadcast messages done
by the BN nodes. We also include the RSSI threshold in the
SGP implementation in order to compare s performance with
the BOFP. The RSSI values were deﬁned by analyzing, for
each scenario, whose values maximized the delivery ratio in
point-to-point communication.
Table II summarizes the parameters of the second simula-
tion model designed to compare the performance of the BOFP
with the DGR with respect to the ASAC. In this second model,
we do not consider the trafﬁc generated by sensor nodes as
result of event detection, as deﬁned in [11]. Differently of the
former model, we deployed only two actuator nodes in the
opposite extremity sides of the sensing ﬁeld. We also consider
that the trafﬁc load is generated by one of the actuators, that
sends one message at every ﬁve seconds.
We designed and executed the simulation models in OM-
NeT++/Castalia environment [14]. For each simulation sce-
nario, the results we report correspond to the average of 40
independent executions with different seeds. Moreover, since
the samples did not follow a normal distribution we proceeded
with the statistical analysis, considering each scenario indepen-
dently, by applying the Kruskal-Wallis test [15].
B. Metrics
1) End-to-end delay: Here, the end-to-end delay is the
elapsed time between the message generation by any sensor
node until the delivery of such message to an actuator.

2) Energy Consumption: The energy consumption is a very
important metric to assess the protocol efﬁciency. We estimate
the individual energy consumption for a single transmission
(ET x) and for a reception (ERx) considering the energy model
proposed by Heinzelman et al in [16]:
ET x(k, d)
=
Eelec ∗ k + eamp ∗ k ∗ d2
(1)
ERx(k)
=
Eelec ∗ k
(2)
where k is the number of bits to be transmitted with dis-
tance d, considering the energy spent Eelec = 50nJ/bit for
both transmission/reception and antenna ampliﬁcation eamp =
100pJ/bit/m2. The total energy consumption of the network
is given by the sum of the energy spent in each transmis-
sion/reception as given by the Equations 1 and 2 [16].
3) Goodput: This measure, highly related to the message
delivery reliability, consists in the ratio of the total number
of original application data messages to the total number of
messages delivered to the actuators nodes.

C. Simulation Results and Discussion
1) Attesting the beneﬁts of BN: The charts depicted in
Figure 1 present the results corresponding to the scenarios of
the ﬁrst simulation model designed to evaluate the performance
of the protocols considering the event data trafﬁc generated by
sensor nodes. In the chart, the black dots represent the mean
values whereas the letters a, b and c indicate the statistical
equivalence of the samples. For example, given the results of
a speciﬁc metric for each distinct scenario, if two boxes are
with the same letter, this means that they are not, according
to the Kruskal-Wallis test, statistically different regarding this
metric. Otherwise, they have a signiﬁcant difference. One may
noticed that, for the trhee metrics, BOFP behaves slightly
better than the others as the extent of the scenarios increases.
The statistical analysis has showed that the results obtained by
BOFP and SGP are similar considering the goodput. However,
the reduced energy consumption of BOFP compensates, since
it can deliver almost the same average number of messages as
SGP while requiring less energy. Additionally, BOFP presents
an overall end-to-end delay smaller than other protocols.
2) Performance in ASAC: The main goal of this evaluation
is to compare the performance of the BOFP with the DGR
considering the ASAC. As indicated in Figure 2, it is note-
worthy that the BOFP outperforms the DGR with respect to
the goodput and the end-to-end delay. Consequently, reliability
with regard to data delivery of BOFP is better than from
DGR. Moreover, the DGR has a better performance than the
BOFP when considering the energy consumption. The reason
is the number of transmissions executed by the BOFP: as the
BOFP transmits much more messages than DGR, the energy
consumption of the BOFP is higher. Finally, we also observed
that the performance of the BOFP is signiﬁcantly higher
than of DGR because the latter is sensible to communication
faults primarily during the routing path establishment phase
execution.
3) Scalability properties of BOFP: In order to attest the
scalability of the proposed protocol, we compared the goodput
samples considering the three distinct extent scenarios. Figure
3 presents the results of this analysis. As stated before, distinct
letters represent the statistical difference between the samples.
According to this analysis, we did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant differ-
ences in the results. Thus, BOFP may cope with scalability
requirement for large scale WSANs.
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS
In this paper, we addressed the problem of performing
ASAC in large-scale WSANs. Additionally, for this type of
WSAN, the protocols found in the literature revealed a short-
coming of not provide the adequate levels of energy efﬁciency
and reliable data delivery. In line with this shortcoming, in
this paper, we proposed a new routing protocol, the BOFP,
specially designed for large-scale WSANs. Accordingly, for
assessing the performance of the BOFP, we carried out sim-
ulations in different scenarios considering both data trafﬁcs
of event detection and the ASAC. By comparing the BOFP
with other protocols we observed results which revealed the
beneﬁts of the BN approach in determining the routing paths.
The results also showed how the BOFP may achieve adequate
reliable data delivery levels without compromise the energy
efﬁciency. As future research, we intend to deﬁne a path
reestablishment procedure in order to evaluate the BOFP
