Abstract—Malfunction of clinical decision support (CDS) 
systems could lead to undesirable consequences. We evaluated 
CDS malfunctions associated to the use of electrocardiograms 
(ECG) as data source to detect a delta in the corrected QT 
interval (QTc) ≥ 60 milliseconds (QTc current ECG minus 
QTc previous ECG). Our preliminary results showed that 
several common clinical conditions can cause changes in the 
electrocardiogram and result in errors when calculating the 
QTc interval and subsequently the delta QT between 2 serial 
ECGs. These errors cannot be easily identified by the 
electronic systems and are a source of CDS malfunction.

 INTRODUCTION 
Clinical decision support (CDS) systems integrated with 
the electronic health record (EHR) have the potential to 
enhance patient safety, improve quality of care, and decrease 
cost [1]. These systems are excellent tools to screen for rare 
but potentially life-threatening conditions. However, their 
accuracy depends on the structured data available in the 
EHR. If these data have errors, the CDS systems may be 
unable to provide accurate recommendations, or even worse, 
could provide false recommendations leading to unintended 
consequences for patients and clinicians.  
Prolongation of the QT interval in the electrocardiogram 
(ECG) is a rare clinical condition that is an independent risk 
factor for Torsades de Pointes (TdP), a ventricular 
arrhythmia that can cause syncope, seizure or sudden cardiac 
death. QT prolongation can be congenital (long QT 
syndrome) or secondary to several medications, electrolyte 
abnormalities, and comorbidities. Because of these risks, 
international guidelines [2] recommend the use of electronic 
systems 
to 
detect 
potentially 
arrhythmogenic 
QT 
prolongation in hospitalized patients. QT prolongation is 
defined as a heart-rate corrected QT (QTc) value > 470 
milliseconds (ms) in men and > 480 ms in women. For both 
genders, a QTc > 500 ms is considered potentially life 
threatening and is associated with a 2- to 3-fold higher risk 
for TdP. As the QT interval is relatively stable over the 
course of one’s life, a delta QTc > 60 ms on serial ECGs is a 
potential warning sign, reflecting new/additional QT 
stressors might have occurred.  Our institution has developed 
and implemented several CDS interventions to identify high 
risk patients showing QT prolongation, and provide 
appropriate management to prevent complications [3]. 
Herein, we present our preliminary results of the evaluation 
of the CDS malfunctions associated to the use of ECGs as 
the data source to detect a delta QTc ≥ 60 ms. 
II. 
METHODS 
We evaluated a CDS system (QT Alert System) 
integrated with the EHR designed and implemented to 
improve awareness of a new clinically significant increase of 
the QTc by ≥ 60ms in two consecutive ECGs. All ECGs 
were obtained and initially analyzed using the MUSE 
Cardiology Information System (GE Healthcare), which 
provided initial measure of the QT interval and QTc value. 
All electronically generated reports were evaluated by an 
ECG technician trained in ECG interpretation and, where 
needed, corrected. All pediatric and questionable abnormal 
ECG findings were evaluated subsequently by a pediatric or 
adult cardiologist. The QT Alert System screened all ECGs 
transmitted to the EHR to detect a delta QTc ≥ 60ms by 
comparing the last two ECGs, and if positive, alerted the 
ordering provider (outpatient) or the primary hospital service 
(inpatient) by sending a semi-urgent inbox message. All 
event data were electronically stored for reporting. 
A preliminary review of the ECGs was done using 
electronic searches to identify events with potential errors in 
measurement of the QTc focusing on extreme outliers. A 
sample of 50 alerts (100 ECGs) was reviewed independently 
by two physicians (TDG and NL), who manually re-
calculated the QTc and assessed the ECGs for potential 
sources of errors that could have led to an erroneous delta 
QT. The ECG pairs were selected for review when the time 
between the ECGs was less than 7 days and (1) both QTc > 
500 ms or (2) previous QTc < 360 ms and current QTc 
>500ms. These criteria were chosen because of the extreme 
QTc changes. The kappa statistic for initial agreement 
between the two reviewing physicians was 0.432. All 
differences were resolved by mutual consensus.

RESULTS 
Overall, we analyzed 6,798 events (inbox messages) in 
6,039 unique patients (52.2% male, mean age 60.1 years, SD 
± 19.5 years) over a 6-year period. Patients could have more

than one event. The messages were sent to 6,434 unique 
providers. The time interval between consecutive ECGs was 
highly variable; for 27.35% of alerts, the interval was less 
than 2 days, 23.4% between 2 to 7 days, 34.25% between 8 
to 365 days, and 15.0% between 1 and 5 years. Table I 
shows the distribution of the events based on the QTc value 
of the ECGs. A large proportion of events (47.3%) occurred 
with a current QTc > 500 ms that by itself was a risk factor 
for complications. A few events (n = 10; 0.1%) occurred 
with both QTc values below 360 ms (short QTc). Some 
events (n = 43; 0.6%) showed a very large delta QTc (mean 
delta QTc = 237 ms; SD = 89 ms).

DISCUSSION 
Our results suggest that ECG data can be a source of 
malfunction of CDS systems. In the case of detecting QTc 
abnormalities, several common clinical conditions (Table II) 
can change the morphology of the QT wave or the heart rate 
introducing significant errors when the QTc is measured by 
an electronic system. 
The ECG is the source of high value data related to the 
cardiac function and can be used to identify patients at risk 
for complications due to abnormal changes in the QT 
interval. However, these data are unstable and influenced by 
several factors that may not be easily recognized by a CDS 
system. Nevertheless, most of these errors are detected easily 
by a clinician reviewing the ECG.  
To improve the accuracy of CDS systems that use ECG 
data, it may be necessary to use additional EHR data 
indicating new changes of the patient’s clinical condition. 
Potential changes include identifying new interventions (i.e., 
pacemakers), 
new 
cardiac 
events 
(i.e., 
ischemia, 
arrhythmias), or transfer to a different clinical setting (i.e., 
monitor bed, intensive care unit, operating room). Better 
standardization of ECG interpretation and reporting [4] is 
also needed to minimize data errors. These changes could 
help in the design of more accurate, context sensitive CDS 
systems able to improve performance while decreasing 
burden and alert fatigue. 
In conclusion, erroneous ECG data can impact 
significantly the outcome and the clinical recommendations 
provided by CDS systems. These malfunctions could lead to 
alert fatigue and mistrust of the recommendations provided 
by CDS systems.
