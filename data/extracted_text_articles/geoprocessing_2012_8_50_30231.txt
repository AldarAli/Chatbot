I.
INTRODUCTION
Although automation of cartographic generalization has
been an extensive field of research [3][7][11[14][15], there
still remains a lack of a usable holistic generalization
method. A holistic process that makes it possible to
generalize the whole map including all the layers, to take
into account the connections between the layers and to deal
with levels of detail in the small and large scales at once.
More
recently,
the
demand
for
automated
map
generalization, which has been longstanding in the context of
conventional GIS (Geographical Information Systems), has
been
reinforced
by
the
prevalence
of
geographical
information access on the Internet, that make it more
complicated. There are several types of public access map-
based Web sites that allow a user to zoom in and zoom out of
a particular region, but at presently, this is usually based on
stepping between independent pre-processed generalized
datasets which may differ markedly in their degree of
generalization. It would be desirable to be able to change the
level of detail on such systems in a smooth and progressive
manner rather than the quantum-leap changes that often
characterize the current approach [12].
The aim of this article is to investigate and compare
generalization processes on different detail levels. The
author’s
intention
is
to
describe
and
compare
two
generalization processes of one thematic layer, which are
settlements.
The
first
process
touches
large-scale
generalization, from 1:10 000 to 1:50 000 and the second one
concerns small-scale generalization, from 1:250 000 to 1:500
000. Two different models of generalization processes are
proposed: one based on electric fields theory implemented in
MATLAB (by MathWorks) and the second based on
mathematical
morphology
implemented
in
Clarity
(by
1Spatial). The main point of interest is to show the specifics
of the generalization process at large- and small-scale
elaborations in terms of characteristic of the generalized
thematic layer and also characteristic algorithms and tools
used at different level of details. The authors want to
investigate whether it is possible to build one comprehensive
model to manage the on-line generalization process at
different levels of detail.
With respect to the goals of the article in section II the
authors present the different problems, which a cartographer
has to deal with, on different detail levels. In Section III the
authors concentrate on some significant differences, as well
as some similarities, between generalization processes at
large and small scales.
In Section IV two generalization
models, for both detail levels, are presented and discussed.
Finally in Section V the authors conclude their research and
they point at the future research directions.

DIFFERENT PROBLEMS ON DIFFERENT LEVELS OF
DETAIL
Cartographic
generalization
is
a
decision-making
process aimed at reflecting the purpose of a map or database
and emphasizing characteristics and relations of generalized
objects. Due to its holistic nature, the generalization can
hardly be transferred into a process of sequences of tasks
which might be applied in computer environment. The
necessary condition of de-composing the generalization
process
into
tasks
sequence
is
a
formalization
of
cartographic knowledge [13].
In many countries, there are specifications of map
redaction with additional remarks on the generalization
process
for
topographic
maps.
Based
on
them,
a
cartographer is able to collect and formalize knowledge
about the generalization process at the large scales. Those
map specifications are the source of important constraints
like: threshold values, minimum or maximum values of
distances.
Unfortunately,
a
dominating
part
of
existing
elaborations touches both the
maps and
spatial data
generalization expressed in large scales [1], [2]. [10]. By
large-scales elaboration, we understand maps and databases
at the scales from 1:500 up to 1:50 000 while as a small-

scale elaborations we consider maps and databases from
1:200 000. The reason for that can be placed in the wide
practical application of such kind of data. Basic spatial
databases from country levels have been expressed just in
the scales of 1: 10 000, 1: 25 000 and 1: 50 000 and hence
the need for their automated generalization appears.
On the contrary, the generalization at small scales
depends, in general, on the experience and knowledge of a
cartographer. The result of the process depends on, not
always consequent, decisions of its author. As a result, maps
in particular scales or a spatial data of the same level of
detail may differ from each other both in a range, as well as
in a level of generalization. Due to the subjective character
of the small-scale generalization process, none of the precise
instructions of its redaction were elaborated on until now:
what makes it significantly difficult to collect knowledge
about the process, its formalization, and implementation in
GIS systems.
III.
LARGE VERSUS SMALL GENERALIZATION
Generalization
methods
and
processes
have
been
changed and improved alongside development in the science
and art of cartography and have been surely influenced by
progress in computer science [8].
In the process of cartographic generalization at every
level of detail we can point at four main stages:

Selection of categories of objects (object classes)
presented on a map and their classification.

Selection of objects within particular categories.

Change in a cartographic method of representation –
replacing an outline of area feature with a signature
[9].

Simplification of built-up area’s outlines.
With respect to the holistic character of a generalization
process, in this article, we concentrate on one thematic layer
- settlements. The reason for that is that most cartographers
consider this thematic layer as the most important and at the
same time the most difficult one.
The above mentioned four generalization stages will be
applied differently at large and small scales elaborations.
Both in large and small-scale generalization processes, the
context
of
geographical
information
and
topologic
relationships are to taken into consideration.
A.
Characteristics of the generalization processes at
large- and small-scales
There are significant differences between large- scale and
small-scale generalization processes. First of all at large
scales (in this article we treat 1:10 000 scale as a source)
settlements are presented as separate buildings, while at
small-scale elaborations, all settlements are presented as
signatures, and additionally the ones of them which are
highly-populated are presented also as outlines (these are
built-up areas). So, in the small-scale data model settlements
are placed in two thematic layers.
In the small-scale generalization process in order to
achieve
desirable
cartographic
results,
the
following
operators need to be applied. First and the key generalization
stage is a selection of information which concerns both
settlements
presented
by
signatures
and
presented
by
outlines.
A
selection
operator
is
based
on
attribute
information
concerning
the
importance
of
particular
settlements, like population, administrative meaning, and
area for built-up areas. It is also often connected to the
spatial characteristic of a whole settlements’ network like
density of settlements.
On the other hand, while generalizing at large scales, the
goal of the process is to show the presented data with more
details without spatial conflicts that destroy the correctness
and the reality of the data. A selection operator is based on
attribute
information
concerning
the
importance
of
a
particular map object which is affected by its geometric and
attributes properties and its topologic relation with other
objects.
Another
important
operator
during
the
small-scale
generalization process of settlements presented by outlines is
aggregation. At the small scales the goal is to put together all
parts of the same locality (city) presented by outlines. The
parts of a locality are usually aggregated based on two
conditions: the distance between them and the name of the
locality. In this article, we use aggregation operators
originated from mathematical morphology (erosion/dilation)
to keep the characteristics of shape of the outlines after the
generalization process. At large scales this operator also
plays a very important role as we aggregate the relevant
buildings, based on its functions and the distance among
them, in order to create built-up areas. At the same time
those two aggregation processes differ in kind. At large
scales, buildings will be aggregated by moving them to each
other in order to decrease the presented area and increase the
free area between them, while at such a scale the movement
distances are small relatively. Another important difference,
especially according to its relation to other thematic layers
like roads is that in the large-scale generalization process,
during building aggregation it is not allowed to aggregate
together the buildings lying on the other side of the road.
While at the small scales aggregation we are allowed to
aggregate built-up areas (parts of one city) even if they are
shared by the roads.
One of the last-used operators in the generalization of
settlements, in both large- and small-scales processes, is a
simplification operator. It is used in the generalization
process of the outlines of built-up areas at small-scales but
also for building simplification. The difference here lies in
the application of a relevant algorithm of simplification. At
small-scales where the goal is to simplify the irregular
outline of built-up area we need to apply a simplification
algorithm which lets us do the shape simplification while at
the large scales we can, for example, use both simplification
and squaring algorithm for buildings generalization.
IV.
LIMITATIONS OF PROPOSED APPROACHES
The main issue in the automated generalization process is
the formalization of rules and cartographic constraints
definition, which makes it possible to obtain correct
cartographic results.

A.
Small-scale generalization model
The concept proposed by Karsznia [5], [6] comprises the
collecting
of
cartographic
data,
its
formalization
and
implementation in a form of knowledge base in the Clarity
system.
In the first stage, cartographic knowledge concerning
small-scale generalization of settlements was collected and
formalized in a form of a rules sequence for 1:500 000 level
of detail. As a result, a knowledge base concerning
generalization process of settlements was elaborated.
The knowledge base in the Clarity system [5][6] consists
of
generalization
activities
together
with
their
implementation
in
a
form
of
either
algorithms
or
respectively, generalization tools. For that purpose, the
available system functions have been used as well as new
algorithms (by Java programming) and spatial analyzes tools
have been proposed.
An important element of a knowledge base in this system
was the development of the algorithms cluster settlements
and the application of action polygon erode algorithm
(supplied by Ordnance Survey), made it possible for more
correct results (from the cartographic point of view) to be
obtained from the aggregation of part of the built-up areas
presented as outlines. In Clarity it is possible to aggregate
built-up areas on the basis of distances between them, by
using the algorithm clustering. Unfortunately, this may lead
to connection of even a few different localities. The
modification of the built-up areas aggregation algorithm in
Clarity made it possible to connect selected parts of localities
under the condition that the same name be used, and the
limitation of an assumed distance between them applied. As
for the algorithm action polygon erode deriving from
mathematical morphology, its application allows the proper
shapes of objects to be kept, after generalization (Fig. 1).

B.
Large-scale generalization model
In large-scale elaborations where more details are needed
and showed, more spatial conflicts arise and need to be
solved.
`In [4], an automated process was modeled based on a
sub model of a neural network to set relative importance
values of the maps' objects taking into account the object's
properties, its surrounding area and the map's target. Electric
theories were implemented in the MATLAB environment in
order to formalize the dynamic maps' object behaviors
during the process of generalization.
Each object during the automated generalization process
is treated individually; spatial analysis is implemented to
define
the
object’s
cartographic
characteristics
and
topological relationships with its nearby objects that should
remain. The electric model set powers for each object that
expressed the relative importance of the cartographic objects
in the treated map according to the object properties and the
map target and required scale. The interaction between the
objects' powers produces forces that act in order to solve
spatial
conflicts
and
insure
clear
presentation
of
the
cartographic data in the required map. The translation of the
forces into generalization operators is done with the respect
of the cartographic rules and constraints dealing with the
objects details and connections. The cartographic rules and
constraints were set and formalized by setting a sub-model of
neural network that learned previous cartographers and users
decisions from the input training datasets. The process of the
forces action and the presentation preparing contains of three
main stages: 1). simplification of each map's object and
deletion of minor objects, 2).clustering close objects of the
same type according to the cartographic layer properties,
taking into account topologic connections (Fig 2) and 3).

results of aggregation taking into account the city name and
the allowable distance 250 m with the respect to the
knowledge base built by Karsznia [5], [6] at 1:500000 scale.
The comparison of small-scale generalization results
obtained within MATLAB and Clarity makes it possible to
formulate few interesting conclusions.


The specific character of both generalization process
of small-scale and large-scale maps demands in
many cases different solutions of the same problem
depending on the context and objects’ surrounding.
In this context, important constraint is a lack of
algorithms and tools having a context-like character
which
would
make
it
possible
to
implement
generalization steps on a higher conceptual level.
The conducted experiments proved that building one
comprehensive generalization model to manage on-line
generalization process at different levels of detail is a
difficult but at the same time, challenging task.
In order to do more detailed comparison between large
and small scale generalization on the way of building
comprehensive generalization model, another experiment in
being carried out. The cartographic knowledge of large scale
generalization process collected in polish map specifications
is
being
formalized
at
the
moment
and
it
will
be
implemented within Clarity based on Israeli data at 1:10 000
scale.
