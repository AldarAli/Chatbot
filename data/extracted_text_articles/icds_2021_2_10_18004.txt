Abstract—Building stock accounts for a major portion of
worldwide energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.
Integrating resources, information and automation systems in a
proper manner to achieve the required outcomes and meet the
relevant regulatory standards for deep renovation and emerging
energy efﬁciency is a signiﬁcant challenge. RINNO is a Horizon
2020 project that aims to deliver a set of processes that, when
working together, provide a system, repository, marketplace,
and enabling workﬂow process for managing deep renovation
projects from inception to implementation. This paper presents
an overview of the RINNO project and, speciﬁcally, RINNO’s
design for an open renovation platform for managing and
delivering deep renovation projects for residential buildings
based on seven design principles. The proposed platform will
be developed, implemented and evaluated at four pilot sites with
varying construction, regulatory, market and climate contexts.
Keywords—Deep renovation; open renovation; energy efﬁciency;
residential buildings; renovation management platform.
I. INTRODUCTION
Despite pledges and public sector efforts to curb global
warming, carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector
and industry have increased by 60% since the signing of
the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992
[1]. As such, de-carbonising energy sources and implementing
sustainable development and circular economy principles in
industry has become a key international effort as evidenced
in the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the
2015 Paris Climate Agreement, the EU climate action, and
the European Green Deal.
Meeting 2030 targets requires reduction in greenhouse gas
emissions in excess of 50% [2]. The EU building stock
currently accounts for 40% of the EU’s energy consumption
and 36% of greenhouse gas emissions [2]. Reducing the
energy impact of these building is a signiﬁcant challenge. Most
buildings in Europe have substantially longer lifetimes than
those built in less developed countries, many of which were
built before thermal standards were introduced or required [3].
By 2050, more than 85% of the EU building stock will still
be in use, albeit in need of signiﬁcant renovation [3].
Deep renovation is deﬁned as a form of renovation that
”captures the full economic energy efﬁciency potential of
improvement works, with a main focus on the building shell,
of existing buildings that leads to a very high energy per-
formance” [4]. This includes improving heating and cooling
demand through a more efﬁcient building envelope, the use
of low-energy consuming equipment, increasing renewable
energy sources and implementing smart building principles
[2]. RINNO, a four-year Horizon 2020 project, aims to in-
troduce signiﬁcant improvements in (i) the efﬁciency of the
deep renovation process, both in terms of cost and time, and
(ii) the energy performance and stakeholder satisfaction of
deep renovation projects [5]. This will be achieved through
a novel open renovation platform for the deep renovation
of residential buildings - ranging from planning and design,
to retroﬁtting, operation and monitoring - and implementing
emerging technologies including new materials, prefabrication,
artiﬁcial intelligence, amongst others. In Section II, we in-
troduce the RINNO Open Renovation Platform
Renovation
Framework. Section III provides a brief overview of how the
RINNO platform will be tested in real-life implementations.
Section IV presents some concluding remarks.
II. THE RINNO OPEN RENOVATION PLATFORM &
RENOVATION FRAMEWORK
RINNO aims to develop a new open renovation software
platform. It is designed against seven principles [5]:
1) Full-Lifecycle: implementing the best available techno-
logical solutions and construction practices across the
renovation project lifecycle;
2) Multi-Stakeholder: taking into account multiple concur-
rent stakeholder perspectives and requirements;
3) Modularity: capitalising on independently designed sys-
tems which, when integrated, function as a whole;
4) Open & interoperable: making data, processes and
renovation-speciﬁc
functionalities
available
in
an
ecosystem of building stakeholders;

5) Algorithmic: using machine learning and other, more
generic algorithmic systems based on data generated
from buildings to enable augmented building intelli-
gence in support of planning, design, and building
operations;
6) Scalable: using (green) cloud computing to accommo-
date the massive range of data structure types, al-
gorithms and communication mechanisms inherent in
smart buildings; and,
7) Secure: integrating security considerations into all as-
pects of the open renovation platform from the cloud to
the edge.
The RINNO Operational Platform (Figure 1) comprises ﬁve
layers building on cloud computing Infrastructure-as-a-Service
(IaaS) to enable scalability, algorithmic approaches, and data
management [5]. The Core RINNO Operational Platform
comprises the platform’s primary architecture, middleware,
orchestration, and analytics systems. The RINNO API (Appli-
cation Programming Interface) Management Platform supports
design, security, publishing, monitoring, analysis, consump-
tion, and monetisation APIs in support of open collaboration
standards and data exchange [5]. On top of the underlying
infrastructure sits a number of renovation-speciﬁc components,
which may comprise one or more modules. These include
lifecycle-speciﬁc modules, e.g., a renovation repository, a
planning & design assistant, a retroﬁtting manager, a building
lifecycle renovation manager, and a renovation workﬂow &
transactions manager, ﬁnance, and training, as well as more
general user administration & support modules. On-site data
about the building and its use are gathered through a multi-
sensor network. Finally, users and devices can access the
platform and data through a variety of interfaces, facilitating
multi-stakeholder interactions.
III. RINNO PILOT SITES AND EVALUATION
The RINNO platform will be used in the renovation of
buildings at four pilot sites in Greece, Poland, France and
Denmark. These buildings are all multi-unit social housing
buildings situated in different climatic regions, with diverse lo-
cal building codes and regulations. Furthermore, each building
features different construction materials and elements and is
equipped with different heating, ventilation, and air condition-
ing (HVAC) systems and other related building systems and
features. The project will be evaluated based on a wide range
of key performance indicators including reduced energy con-
sumption, the adoption and use of renewable energy sources
(RES), thermal performance, renovation time and effort and
comparative cost, as well as stakeholder satisfaction measures
[5].
IV. CONCLUSIONS
This extended abstract provides a short overview of the
Horizon 2020 RINNO project. Upon delivery, all processes
will work as a system, repository and integrated workﬂow
for the initiation and implementation of deep renovation
ventures. This will result in optimised renovation design,
