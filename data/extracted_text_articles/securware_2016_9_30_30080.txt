Abstract— Evaluating and ensuring the resilience of critical
infrastructure is essential in terms of maintaining vital societal
functions. This fact increases the importance of developing
relevant mathematical models and their implementation to
software tools. This article therefore discusses the development
process
of
a
critical
infrastructure
resilience
evaluation
mathematical model as a basis for information support system
development. The article addresses both the description of
selected resilience evaluation attributes as well as the possible
structure of the information support system.
Keywords-
critical
infrastructure;
resilience
evaluation;
information support system.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Critical infrastructure as a system is an essential part of
society functional continuity, its economic or social structure
and systems. In relation to this fact, approaches and tools
were
proposed,
which
reflect
the
above
mentioned
essentiality and create the framework for a risk assessment
system, which should positively affect the functionality and
resilience. Critical Infrastructure Protection in the Czech
Republic is regulated by Act no. 430/2010 Coll., which can
be
seen
as
an
implementation
of
Council
Directive
2008/114/EC on the identification and
designation of
European Critical Infrastructures and the assessment of the
need
to
improve
their
protection,
which
provides
a
framework for creating a common European access to
Critical Infrastructure Protection. This Directive establishes
certain instruments for the identification and designation of
an European and national infrastructure (sector and cross-
cutting criteria), as well as instruments for increasing the
protection of Critical Infrastructure in the context of the need
to maintain functional continuity of the society (Operator
Security Plan, Security Liaison Officer, Public Private
Partnership and etc.). These instruments can also be seen
from the resilience evaluation perspective, where, as it was
said, resilience is seen as an indicator that quantifies the
ability to provide functionality in terms of internal and
external factors negative effects, provided to the need of
establishing
the
limits,
when
degradation
of
system
functionality is acceptable and when it is not [3]. Relevant
approaches which were the philosophical baseline and the
concept for security research project were presented in
several articles. The most appropriate are RAMCAP Plus
Approach [2] or D., Rehak P., Senovsky [10]. The rest of the
paper is structured as follows. The first section provides the
theoretical input to the resilience evaluation process in the
context of information support. The second part is focused
on resilience terminology specification. The third part then
discusses and presents the security research outcome –
Methodology for the Resilience Evaluation System of the
Critical Infrastructure Elements and Networks in Selected
Areas in Czech Republic as a unique and new approach to
resilience evaluation and its implementation to decision
support calculator as a relevant information support system.
II.
RESILIENCE
“System resilience” in relation to critical infrastructure is
a relatively new term, but, in principle, there are some
accepted definitions:
Resilience is the „ability to resist, absorb, recover from or
successfully adapt to adversity or a change in conditions“
according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security
Risk Steering Committee [1].
Resilience is „both the inherent strength and ability to be
flexible and adaptable after environmental shocks and
disruptive events“according to Tierney and Bruneau [1].
Resilience is understood as „the ability of systems,
infrastructures, government entities, businesses, and society
to adapt to adverse events, to minimize the impact of such
events (keeping the system running), and also to anticipate
future adverse events and be able to prevent them“according
to the CRN Report, Focal report 6, Risk Analysis, Resilience
– trends in Policy and Research [1] [2].
III.
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT RESILIENCE
EVALUATION METHODOLOGY ALGORITHMS
One appropriate approach, which was a philosophy
baseline for our new approach for resilience evaluation was
All-hazard
risk
and
resilience:
Prioritizing
Critical
Infrastructures Using the RAMCAP Plus Approach [2].
The RAMCAP Plus process avoids unnecessary detail,
precision and cost by focusing on the most critical assets at
a facility and keeping the approach relatively simple and
intuitive. There are numerous other risk methodologies in
use by specific industries, but their results are generally not
comparable with other industry sectors or, in some cases,
with other facilities within the sector. Many are qualitative,

producing relative results that can be compared only locally,
if at all. Moreover, several of the available methods require
the assistance of specialized consultants and/or considerable
amount of time, money and personnel resources, which
discourages their use and makes them costly to use on a
regular basis. The RAMCAP Plus process – through the
cost-effective
application
of
common
and
consistent
terminology and metrics – provides a basis for using
existing
data
and
reporting
results
in
a
consistent,
quantitative, directly comparable manner [2]. Depending on
the purpose, the resilience of critical infrastructure element
or elements evaluation should be done as an external or
internal evaluation. It should be based on knowledge of
nature and basic functional, technological and spatial
attributes of the evaluated critical infrastructure elements.
Next, we will therefore present a unique approach which
reflects actual security, safety and resilience issues in Czech
Republic in relation to critical infrastructure stability and
functional continuity.
Multi-criteria
evaluation
is
one
of
the
appropriate
methods
for
evaluating
the
resilience
of
critical
infrastructure element and system. This method allows
implementation of a comprehensive evaluation of relatively
independent indicators and parameters. It uses a semi-
quantitative expression of the individual indicators value. Its
disadvantage is a lower resilience level performance. It
allows to rate a critical infrastructure element in an
appropriate
range
of
resilience
levels.
The
result
of
evaluation unfortunately does not specify how long the
element of critical infrastructure can withstand the influence
of negative factors. The advantage is the evaluation of the
protection measures quality in relation to identified threats
and risks [3].
It is obvious that the multi-criteria evaluation should be
related to the security areas, which have a positive impact
on the resilience level (robustness and preparedness),
including their components. Every area of security and
safety should have a positive impact on the robustness and
preparedness
level.
The
assessment
should
therefore
establish standards (criteria) for the selected security and
safety
areas,
through
checklists.
A
comprehensive
evaluation
requires
the
expression
of
the
risk
value
(coefficient) and its relationship and impact on the selected
element or sector of critical infrastructure resilience. This
highlights the fact that the final system resilience level is the
average value of resiliencies related to selected risks. For
complex multi-criteria critical infrastructure element or
sector resilience evaluation, a mathematical relationship was
established, represented by following equation:
ܱܦܲ=
∑ܱܦ݅
ݔ݅(1)
where:
ODP - is the resilience value of the evaluated critical
infrastructure elements,
- is the resilience value of the critical infrastructure
element in relation to the selected (i-th) risk
- is the number of selected risks [4].
The mathematical expression of critical infrastructure
elements resilience in relation to the i-th risk is:
ܱܦ݅=(1−ܪܴܼ݅)+(1−ܭܵ)+(ܭܴܱ∗ܸܴܱ+ܭܴܲ∗ܸܴܲ)
3(2)
where:
- is the risk value of i-th risk
- is correlation coefficient,
- is the robustness coefficient,
- is the weight of robustness,
- is the preparedness coefficient,
- is the weight of preparedness [2][3].
A.
Analysis and Risk assessment
Analysis and risk assessment in the context of the
above-mentioned methodology is based on a two steps
process:
1.
Semi-quantitative risk analysis,
2.
Qualitative risk correlation analysis (QARS)
In the first instance, the risk is semi-quantitatively
expressed by the relationship:
(3)
where:
R -
Risk value,
P -
The probability of threats application,
N -
Impact value
In risk and vulnerability evaluation process is necessary
to use relevant methodology for the expression of the mutual
relationships and interdependencies between identified risks.
For this purpose, the (QARS) methodology was selected.
The importance of this methodology is especially in
connection with the diversification of risk based on level of
risk activity (the risk ability or potential to cause further
risks) and passivity evaluation (possibility that the risk may
be caused by other risks) in relation to other risks.
The process of implementation of the QARS analysis is
a multi-steps process, with the first step being the creation
of a list of possible risks.The next step is focused on the
expression of importance relations and interdependencies
between the identified risks in the form of spreadsheet
correlation Table 1.

Coefficients
of

calculation are based on the equations:
(4)
where:
CARi
is the value of activity coefficient,
CpRi
is the value of passivity coefficient,
∑
iR is the sum of risks,
x - total number of risk.
After adding values to the correlation table for the tree
fall risk, the horizontal axis (activity coefficient) and vertical
axis (passivity coefficient), and after using the above
equations, we have the following parameters (presented in
Table 2):
TABLE 2. COEFFICIENTS AND RISK INDEX
Subsequently, the coefficient values are plotted on a
graph, which ultimately enables the identification of the most
significant risks in terms of their potential (high activity and
passivity potential).
For the risk evaluation or for the process of determinig
the most significant risks, the graph must be divided into
segments
that
differentiate
risks
according
to
their
significance. To divide the graph into 4 segments, it is
necessary to define S1 and S2 lines that divide the graph
itself and the risks to the segments where it is assumed that
in the first segment will be 80% if major risks.
To express the parameters for lines S1 and S2, we use
the equations:
(5)
where:
min
max ;
A
A
C
C
- minimum and maximum values of activity
coefficient,
min
max ;
P
P
C
C
- minimum and maximum values of passivity
coefficient,
Then, the lines are implemented and divide the risks in
4 segments (Figure 1) that represent the level of risks:
1.
I. Segment - Primarily significant risks – the
highest activity and passivity coefficients,
2.
II. and III. Segment – Secondary significant risks,
3.
IV. Segment – Tertiary significant risks – low
value of activity and passivity coefficients,
Figure 1. Division into 4 risk segments
This process allows us to divide risks by the highest
potential in relation to system functionality degradation due
to domino efect, which can be seen as an expression and
evaluation of the vulnerability parameter (Vi) [3][4].
B.
Software application
In relation to above-mentioned procedure, the second
step of risk analysis and assessment is the risk list creation.
This method is based on the use of simple mathematical
equations. In connection with this fact, the excel calculator
was selected, mostly because it provides easy editing and
graph work. The resulting Table 3 was:

considered critical - located in I. quadrant of QARS. These
risks values are seen through first phase of risk assessment
and analysis, which takes into account the degree and
significance of the selected risks impact to the system. For
the determination of the risk value the following equation
was applied:

where:
HRZi - is the risk value of i-th risk in range <0,1>

the risk analysis
HRimax - the maximum attainable risk value within the value
range.

Correlation value
Determination of correlation coefficient Ks is an
important aspect that expresses the position of the linkages
and dependencies within the critical infrastructure system.
Generally, the main linkages and dependencies areas are:
a)
Logical linkages and dependencies,
b)
Physical linkages and dependencies,
c)
Territorial linkages and dependencies.
To determine the value of correlation parameter the
following equation is applied:
(7)
where:
Ks - correlation parameter value
Sum Si - the sum of the dependence degree of the i-th CI
elements groups to other CI areas
Smax - is the maximum value of correlation

Robustness coefficient evaluation
The robustness expressed by KRO, represents strength,
durability, resistance to deformation. It is the ability to resist
and withstand the effects of negative events without
significant function degradation. In this methodology, the
CI element robustness is divided into structural robustness
and security robustness. These two areas, respectively, their
expressions, form a relationship for the evaluation of the
system robustness:
ܭܴܱ=ܭܴܼ∗ܭܴܵ(8)
where:
- is the robustness coefficient,
- is the structural robustness coefficient,
- is the security robustness coefficient.
The evaluation of security robustness coefficient KRZ in
relation to the resilience evaluation is seen from a wider
context. The security robustness coefficient expresses the
extent and quality of the critical infrastructure element
security in connection with identified risks. Individual
measures, according to their nature and effect, are divided
into specific security areas. There are areas of physical
security,
information
security,
administrative
security,
personnel
security,
etc.
For
each
type
of
critical
infrastructure element, different security areas should be
defined.

coefficient
basically
consists of:
•
level of physical security
-
which is an
expression
of
the
extent
and
quality
of the
measures
taken
in
the
critical
infrastructure
element physical security,
•
level of information security
-
which is an
expression
of
the
extent
and
quality
of the
measures
taken
in
the
critical
infrastructure
element information security,
•
level of administrative security
- which is an
expression
of
the
extent
and
quality
of the
measures taken under the critical infrastructure
element administrative security,
•
level of personal security
- which is an
expression
of
the
extent
and
quality
of the
measures
taken
in
the
critical
infrastructure
element personnel security.
The importance (weight) of individual security area
components of the security robustness is as individual as the
status and importance of robustness and preparedness in
relation to the selected critical infrastructure element
resilience. The importance
determination, that is, the
weights determination of security robustness for individual
components, is realized using pair wise comparison (Fuller
triangle).
In the case of any two security robustness components
comparison of the n components, we select all combinations
of two elements of n, where the total number of combination
is equal to (figure 6):
ܭ=݊∗(݊−1)∗(݊−2)!
2!(݊−2)!=݊∗(݊−1)

Figure 6. Example of Fuller triangle
Therefore, weights assessment may be calculated by the
following equation:

Mathematical expressions of weights determine the
safety and security areas that are relevant for the evaluation
process which influence the final value of the resilience (in
the case that the weight of administrative security is 0, it is
clear that we would not evaluate the measures provided by
this security area).
For security robustness evaluation, a process has been
formulated following the relationship:

Structural robustness coefficient evaluation
Resilience of critical infrastructure element is the ability
to ensure functionality in terms of external and internal
factors effects. Each resilience value should have a point
featured
element
(building,
room),
surface
element
(agricultural
fields,
complex
reservoirs),
line
element
(pipeline,
pipeline)
and
element
with
the
network
characteristics (Radiation Monitoring Network). The level
of element resilience is related to the security measures, but
also reflects the systemic, structural and technological
characteristics.
A
critical
infrastructure
element
with
network character structure will be able to withstand the
effects
of
natural
disasters
without
serious
function
degradation, if it will be able in terms of its structure,
redirect the flow of technology and alternative way to bridge
the shortfall of transit components. To determine the degree
of influence, it is necessary to reflect those characteristics
that are part of normal operation and are immediately
available to use and do not require extensive activation of
forces and means. These characteristics determine the
structural robustness of a critical infrastructure element.
In the process of assessing structural robustness, it is
possible to use the so-called macro-view approach. Widely
distributed critical infrastructure element deployed on a
large territory (region, country) is more vulnerable than a
point element (Department Building). The probability that it
will deal with the effects of natural disasters is higher, also
has given his blanket deployment of more vulnerabilities.
Structural robustness of critical infrastructure element
expresses the ability to withstand the effects of negative
factors
due
to
its
structure,
system
and
technology
properties. It also includes the ability to withstand the
effects of negative factors without function degradation,
potential of deploying the redundant subsystems to isolate
the failure (to prevent their spread) and flexibility to redirect
service. In relation to this fact, the critical infrastructure
elements have the character of the building, technological
unit,
staffed
technical
system,
processes,
systems
or
services, the assessment of structural robustness should be
determined by a multi-criteria evaluation.
The evaluation process is represented by scoring of the
main
attributes
that
determine
the
magnitude
of the
structural robustness. The structural robustness coefficient
varies in the interval 0.8 – 1. Structural robustness
coefficient
expresses the influence of topological
structure, complexity and other properties or characteristics
of the deterioration of protective measures effect of
evaluated critical infrastructure element. If the coefficient of
structural robustness
is lower, the more attention should
be paid to emergency preparedness. The main attributes by
which the evaluation of the structural robustness should be
performed include:
• type of topological structure,
• complexity,
• number of key technologies
• flexibility
• redundancy
• perimeter protection.
Topological structure type of element is a topological
expression
of
its
physical
appearance.
The
type
of
topological structure is evaluated by the topology index
value
. Determination of the topological structure type is
carried out by using the system architecture, implemented in
the system analysis. Based on the analysis of sectoral
criteria, we distinguish between four types of topological
179
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2016.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-493-0
SECURWARE 2016 : The Tenth International Conference on Emerging Security Information, Systems and Technologies

structures of the critical infrastructure elements. These
include point, area, line and network structures. Topological
structure type is reflected in the range of elements, the
degree of centralization and density of components of
critical infrastructure elements, etc. Index topology
has
values in the range 0 – 3. Value of
is determined by
identifying the type of evaluated element topology (point,
area, line and network) and the specifications of its size. The
network character elements
are determined by using
partial methods. Next, we characterize all four types of
topological structures.
The point structure element is an element that forms a
centred closed unit, located on a small area. Usually, it may
be protected as a whole against external events. This
category
includes
critical
infrastructure
elements
represented by building, group of buildings, building with
mast etc. The closeness and separation from the outside
boundary
elements
improves
the
conditions
for
the
functioning and reduces its vulnerability. For such elements,
structural robustness may not be in high demand. Index
topology
of elements with an area up to 1000 m2 takes
the value 3, with area over 1000 m2 has a value of 2, and the
maximum size of the point element is 1 hectare.
The surface structure element has the character of
surface unit. The dimensions of element length and width
are comparable in size. The geometric shape is not clear, it
may take the form of rectangles, squares, triangles and
polygons, etc. Such an element occupies a large and
geographically compact area. Element target function is
associated
with
a
wide
area
of
space.
The
surface
dimensions are so large, and it usually means that the
physical security provided around the perimeter is difficult
to achieve, but not always. Examples of surface structure
element with ensured physical security may be airports,
especially international flights. An example of element
which is not ensured by physical security is an important
agricultural field. Elements topology index
of area to 1
km2 takes the value 2, the area between 1-10 km2 has a
value of 1 and a surface of 10 km2 has a value of 0.
The line structure element is characterized by a line
arrangement.
It
represents
an
element
which
ensures
transmission, supply or transport between two physically
separate locations. This kind of element is not usually
possible to protect as a whole. Its interruption causes
degradation of transmission, delivery or transportation. Only
local points on the line should be protected, such as
compressor stations, booster stations, etc. In terms of its
nature it is the most vulnerable category of critical
infrastructure elements and ensuring their resilience requires
high
preparedness
to
function
restoration.
Structural
robustness coefficient should reduce the overall resilience
value of the element represented by the protective measures
and preparedness to restore function. Linear character
element topology index
with a length of 10 km takes the
value 1, with a length of 10 km has the value 0.
The network structure element is characterized by a
network structure. It consists of several components (nodes)
which are interconnected. The network is characterized by a
topological structure that expresses the nature and type of
interconnection nodes. We distinguish between tree, star,
polygon and bus structures. If the network is dense, it is less
vulnerable and can better adapt to the failure of one of the
nodes or edges. Element resilience significantly reflected
the ability of technologies in the area of routing. If the
technology in the network allows automatically or at least
automated
forwarding,
element
resilience
is
greatly
increasing. Resilience is also affected and have irreplaceable
role in relation to the importance of each node in the
network. A key role in these elements plays a central node,
which collects data, evaluates and presents it for further use.
Failure of the central node can mean functionality disruption
of the whole critical infrastructure element. Therefore, it is
important that the network functions of the central node are
backed up. Another structural robustness characteristic of
the network is the uniformity of edges distribution. If there
are nodes in the network with the number of edges
significantly higher than the rest, the failure of nodes should
significantly degrade the quality of the provided function of
evaluated critical infrastructure element than the other.
Index
of
network
topology
structure
element
is
determined by the partial multi-criteria methodologies.
Depending on the type of network topology, the number of
core nodes, the total number of nodes and the average
number of edges per node should the topology index
takes
values from 0 - 3.
Element complexity integrates a number of categories
(types) of components and their total number. The level of
complexity is evaluated using the complexity index value
.
If the system is complicated, it is more vulnerable and less
resilient. A number of complications may occur at the
interfaces between the components and technologies. A
complex
system
also
requires
a
higher
degree
of
specialization of the individual components, which degrade
the interchange ability of components. Extensive systems
tend to be prone to restructured complexity. Simple systems
take the complexity index I s value 2, medium (medium
complexity) systems take value 1 and 0 value is for complex
systems.
The criterion for determining the degree of
complexity can also be the number of employees.
In addition to the complexity of critical infrastructure
element, the resilience is significantly affected by the
number of key and support technologies that ensure the
fulfilment of its key function. For example the key
technology of electricity production dispatching is an
information technology as a Local area network. The
number of key technologies is identified in the system
analysis in the specification of technology architecture.
Generally, the more complex systems are more vulnerable.
Mostly the technological dependence of society, forced the
establishment of critical infrastructure protection. Just a
limitation of raw materials for key technology elements of
180

critical
infrastructure
is
degrading
its
functionality.
Similarly, the failure of one technological unit should spread
failures by domino effect in other technological units. The
increasing number of technologies leads to increased
vulnerability and limited element resilience. Technological
complexity of evaluated critical infrastructure element is
evaluated using the key technologies index
. If the
element contains less than 2 key technologies take the key
technologies index
value 2, when the number of
technologies is 3-4 is an index of key technologies
assigned with value of 1, and if the number of key
technologies is 5 and more the index value is 0.
Flexibility as a general feature means adapting of the
building operations in relation to changes in conditions, the
input variables and its structure and other key features.
Flexibility is reflected by critical infrastructure elements
adaptation to new conditions. It ensures the implementation
of the target element function and in the case of breakdown
or
failure
of
some
critical
infrastructure
elements
component. It provides flexibility in redirecting the flow in
case of failure of one of its nodes. Flexibility properties
should be considered to technologies ensuring the fulfilment
of the objective function. For example the high voltage
transmission system ability is to bridge the section shortfall
by redirection and the use of other sections for power
transmission. The ability of critical infrastructure flexibly is
evaluated by the flexibility index
. If key technologies
allow
the
flexibly
adaptation
of
their
activities,
the
flexibility index If is assigned the value 2, in the absence of
flexibility potential¸ flexibility index
takes the value 0.
Redundancy generally means excrescence. In the field
of critical infrastructure elements, redundancy means the
extension of the structure of the key components backup.
The purpose of redundancy is to create the conditions where
the failure of a key component will be immediately
substituted
by
using
redundant
(backup)
components.
Implementation
of redundancy principle
can
be
seen
through a backup operation control, which assumes the
management after
failure of the
main control room.
Applying the principle of redundancy is an important
characteristic to ensure structural robustness of critical
infrastructure
element.
Using
redundant
principal
components is expressed by the redundancy index
.
Redundancy
index
takes
the
value
1,
when
the
redundancy principle is applied. In the case when element
does not have any redundant key technologies, redundancy
index
is assigned by the value 0.
The
geographic
scope
of
the
evaluated
critical
infrastructure elements translates into the possibility of
ensuring the physical security by perimeter protection. If
there is a feature on a relatively small area, it is
economically viable to ensure the physical security as a
whole. In the case where the element is located on a large
area or a long line, it is not economically viable to protect it
as a whole. The monitoring networks elements can be
protected by local perimeter protection. The structure and
use of perimeter protection is evaluated by a perimeter
protection index
. If the critical infrastructure element
does not build the perimeter protection, the perimeter
protection index
is assigned by the value 0. If is the
perimeter protection is local,, the perimeter protection index
takes the value 1, and in case of a complete perimeter
protection, the index value is 2.
The values of topology index , complexity index
, key
technologies index
, flexibility index
, redundancy
index
and perimeter protection index
are listed in
following Equation 11 [3].

Preparedness coefficient evaluation
Preparedness of critical infrastructure element expresses
its ability to restore its function after its degradation by the
effects of negative factors (risks). Preparedness is evaluated
through the preparedness parameter/coefficient KPR, which
can be understood as an expression of the ability to adequate
reaction respectively response to the outbreak of an

return to desired system functionality.
The mathematical expression of preparedness of the

where:

Critical infrastructure element resilience evaluation
It is obvious that the multi-criteria evaluation should
relate to the areas of security, which have a positive impact
on the level of resilience (robustness and preparedness),
including their components. Each area of security, having a
positive impact on the robustness and preparedness should
be assessed in relation to the established standards (criteria),
for selected area through checklists. A comprehensive
evaluation requires expressing the value (coefficient) of the
risk and its relationship and impact to the value of resilience
in
relation
to
selected
element
or
sector
of
critical
infrastructure. This highlights the fact that the total value of
resilience under evaluated system is the average value of
resilience in relation to i-th risk. For a complex multi-
criteria evaluation of selected CI element or elements the
resilience was established by the following mathematical
relationship:
(13)
where:
ODP - selected CI element resilience value
ODi - CI element resilience value in relation to selected i-th
risk
xi - number of selected risks
The mathematical expression of CI elements resilience
in relation to the i-th risk is:
(14)
where:
HRzi - the value of i-th risk,
Ks - correlation parameter,
KRO - robustness parameter,
VRO - robustness weight,
KPR - preparedness parameter,
VPR - preparedness weight,
Equations (1- HRzi) and (1- Ks) reflect the fact that risk
and correlation value negatively affect the value of the
critical infrastructure element resilience.
The presented facts are the basis for the final evaluation
of the critical infrastructure element or group of elements
resilience in the relevant sector.
The final qualitative evaluation will be presented in the
software application part of final critical infrastructure
element resilience evaluation.
For

CONCLUSION
As it was stated in the introduction, the resilience of
critical
infrastructure
is
a
major
aspect
of
critical
infrastructure protection level improvement and assurance
and
maintenance
of
functional
continuity.
The
paper
presented selected facts and knowledge of the evaluation
process
in
connection
with
selected
attributes
of
methodological resilience evaluation. The evaluation process
was
followed
by
the
software
application
and
implementation of the presented mathematical relations.
These facts should allow and provide a basis for information
support system development. The presented model and
resilience evaluation methodology was an outcome of
security research project, where the main aim is to develop
an unique and new approach and model to define and
evaluate the critical infrastructure resilience. In relation to
this fact, it is necessary to mention that resilience evaluation
methodology was certified by Ministry of Trade and
Business and Ministry of Interior of Czech Republic. The
above mentioned model presents the mathematical modelling
which is presently the framework for Dynamic Resilience
Evaluation in new security research project RESILIENCE
