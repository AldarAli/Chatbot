Abstract—In this paper, inertial contact sensor-based terrain 
classification is performed with a Radial basis function 
network. 
Compared 
to 
the 
more 
popular 
Multilayer 
perceptrons, Radial basis function networks are also intelligent 
techniques and universal approximators, but with a much 
simpler structure and shorter training time. It has been shown 
that Radial basis function networks are efficient classifiers 
and, consequently may be used for terrain classification. For 
the experiments, a mobile robot platform recorded vibration 
training data with an inertial measurement unit while 
traversing five different terrains: asphalt, carpet, dirt, paving, 
and tiles. The composition of these terrains induces specific 
vibrations in the mobile platform, which are measured by the 
inertial measurement unit. The vibration signatures comprise 
the mobile robot’s linear acceleration, orientation, and the 
earth’s magnetic field. In contrast to most terrain classification 
techniques found in literature, no pre-processing of the data is 
performed. This reduces the computational overhead needed 
for real-time classification. A Radial basis function network is 
then trained using a hybrid conjugate gradient descent method 
and k-fold cross-validation. Identification of the terrain is 
performed in real time. The classification capability is 
empirically compared to that obtained by a Multilayer 
perceptron, a Naïve Bayes method and a Support Vector 
Machine, which have also been successfully applied to terrain 
classification in literature. It was found that the Radial basis 
function network outperformed the Support Vector Machine 
and Naïve Bayes techniques by a relatively large margin. The 
Multilayer perceptron, although performing slightly better 
than 
the 
Radial 
basis 
function 
network, 
has 
some 
disadvantages compared to the Radial basis function network. 
Consequently, the Radial basis function network, with no pre-
processing of the input data, may be used successfully as an 
alternative contact sensor-based terrain classification method.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Mobile robots are employed on various types of terrain 
[1] in many different operational fields, such as supply and 
logistics, 
surveillance, 
search 
and 
rescue 
missions, 
agricultural applications, transportation, cleaning, inspection 
and entertainment [2][3]. For these operations, it may be 
necessary to traverse some indoor or off-road terrain which 
might influence the vehicle’s performance. The efficiency of 
these vehicles can be improved by their detection of their 
environment. This act of identifying the type of terrain being 
traversed from a list of candidate terrains such as dirt, sand, 
or gravel, is called terrain classification [4].  
Factors, such as friction, cohesion, damping, stiffness and 
surface irregularity comprise the terrain interface that is 
presented to the mobile robot [5]. It may be beneficial to 
identify the current terrain type as the terrain conditions may 
have an influence on both the planning stages and motion 
control of the vehicle’s trip. Once the mobile robot’s control 
system has knowledge of the surface on which it is 
travelling, it will be easier to maneuver over uneven terrain 
or around obstacles, which allows the vehicle to traverse the 
terrain most effectively. In particular, awareness of the 
terrain type will enable the vehicle to drive at higher speeds, 
enable the mobile robot to choose an appropriate driving 
mode, prevent physical damage, keep wheels from sinking 
into the ground and obtain an automated driving process 
which is terrain-dependent. 
Research on the identification of terrain types can be 
divided into two groups: methods relying on noncontact 
sensors [4] - [8] and methods utilizing contact sensors [9] - 
[12]. Examples of noncontact sensors are vision sensors and 
laser scanners. A vision sensor, such as a charge-coupled 
device (CCD) camera, uses techniques that extract textures 
and colors from the sensor data to classify this information 
into variable terrains, like forests and the sky. Unfortunately, 
the performance of these techniques is highly dependent on 
environmental factors, such as lighting conditions and 
climate effects and consequently, the sensor information can 
be distorted. Laser scanner sensor data that are obtained from 
a terrain are converted into frequency information. Learning 
algorithms then use this information to classify the terrain. A 
disadvantage of such a method is that it needs numerous data 
points which may hinder real-time classification. As the 
mobile robot traverses the specific terrain, these terrain 
properties combined with the robot dynamics produce 
vibrational signatures in body motion. Methods based on 
contact sensors, however, classify a terrain using sensor 
information, such as the vibration frequency or the slope 
ratio of the mobile robot’s body into the terrain type.  
The aim of this paper is to perform terrain classification 
using a Radial basis function network (RBFN) and then to 
compare the results to a Multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural 
network [13], the Naïve Bayes method and the Support 
Vector Machine (SVM) technique, which have also been

successfully applied to this problem to provide context. The 
main focus, however, is on the comparison between the 
RBFN and the MLP and, consequently only these two 
methods will be discussed in detail. 
Broomhead and Lowe [14] proposed the RBFN in 1988. 
This type of neural network model forms a unifying link 
among many different research fields, such as pattern 
recognition, regularization, function approximation, noisy 
interpolation, and medicine. The model has become 
increasingly popular due to its topological structure and 
neurons that are tuned locally. In addition, it has become a 
good alternative to the MLP, since it has capabilities 
equivalent to those of the MLP model, but with a simpler 
structure and can be trained much faster. Previous studies 
have shown that RBFNs in general are efficient classifiers 
[2][15]. In one study in particular [2], a RBF network has 
been used for terrain classification where a Discrete Fourier 
transform was implemented to perform feature extraction. 
Unfortunately, such pre-processing of the data is a time-
consuming 
task, 
which may 
prevent 
the real-time 
identification of the terrain.  
The MLPs that are trained by the backpropagation rule is 
one of the most important neural network techniques used 
for nonlinear modeling [16]. Their greatest benefit is that no 
a priori knowledge of the particular functional form is 
required. Feedforward MLPs are mostly utilized to estimate 
relationships between input and target variables. They often 
exhibit superior performance in comparison to more 
classical methods. In contrast to common belief, they are not 
a black box tool. The scientific understanding of empirical 
phenomena subject to neural network modeling can be 
considerably enhanced. Formal statistical inference can be 
performed using estimates obtained from neural network 
learning as the basis. Statistical tests of specific scientific 
hypotheses that are of interest become possible. The 
capability of MLPs to extract interactive and complex 
nonlinear effects extends the power of such tests beyond 
those possible with more traditional methods, such as linear 
regression analysis. 
Terrain classification will be performed based on real-
time vibration data obtained from an inertial measurement 
unit (IMU) contact sensor. No pre-processing of the data as 
reported in some previous studies is performed. The 
assumption is that the output of the IMU sensor is influenced 
by the vibrations induced in the platform while traversing 
different terrains. The test vehicle, a Lego Mindstorms EV3 
mobile robot, is augmented by an IMU mounted on a 
Raspberry Pi 2 computer. Data that is collected from the 
IMU on the moving test vehicle is used as the terrain 
signature. This signature will then be classified as one of five 
predetermined terrains - asphalt, carpet, dirt, paving, or tiles. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In 
Section II, the relatively simple structure and training of the 
RBFN will be discussed. A variant of the gradient descent 
method is used for training. The well-known MLP 
architecture and backpropagation training algorithm are 
considered in Section III. Specific issues related to artificial 
neural network model building are examined in Section IV. 
Experiments performed to determine the accuracy of terrain 
classification using a RBFN, an MLP, the Naïve Bayes 
method and an SVM model will be considered in Section V. 
The results that were obtained will be examined in Section 
VI. Finally, some concluding remarks and future work will 
be presented in Section VII. 
II. 
RADIAL BASIS FUNCTION NETWORKS 
In this section, the RBFN architecture and training of the 
model will be considered. 
A. Architecture 
A RBFN is a feedforward neural network with three 
layers (𝐽1 − 𝐽2 − 𝐽3) [15][17][18] as shown in Figure 1. In 
the input, hidden and output layers there are 𝐽1, 𝐽2 and 𝐽3 
neurons, respectively. The bias in the output layer is denoted 
by 𝜙0(𝑥⃗) = 1 while the nonlinearity at the hidden nodes is 
denoted by the 𝜙𝑘(𝑥⃗)’s. Each hidden layer node uses a 
Radial basis function (RBF), denoted by 𝜙(𝑟)  for its 
nonlinear activation function. The hidden layer performs a 
nonlinear transformation of the input. This nonlinearity is 
then mapped into a new space by the output layer which acts 
as a linear combiner. Normally, all hidden nodes utilize the 
same RBF; the RBF nodes have the nonlinearity 𝜙𝑘(𝑥⃗) =
𝜙(𝑥⃗ − 𝑐⃗𝑘), 𝑘 = 1, … , 𝐽2,  where 𝑐⃗𝑘  denotes the center or 
prototype of the kth node and 𝜙(𝑥⃗) is an RBF. An extra 
neuron in the hidden layer can model the biases of the 
output layer neurons. This neuron has a constant activation 
function 𝜙0(𝑟) = 1. The RBFN determines a global optimal 
solution for the adjustable weights in the minimum mean 
square error (MSE) sense by using the method of linear 
optimization. The output of the RBF network, provided by 
input 𝑥⃗, is given by 
 
 
𝑦𝑖(𝑥⃗) = ∑ 𝑤𝑘𝑖𝜙(‖𝑥⃗ − 𝑐⃗𝑘‖
𝐽2
𝑘=1
), 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝐽3, 
 
  (1) 
where 𝑦𝑖(𝑥⃗) is the ith output, 𝑤𝑘𝑖  denotes the connection 
weight from the kth hidden neuron to the ith output unit, and 
‖∙‖ is the Euclidian norm. The RBF usually utilizes the 
Gaussian function 𝜙(∙) and such a model is normally called 
the Gaussian RBF network.

Given a set of N pattern pairs {(𝑥⃗𝑝, 𝑦⃗𝑝)|𝑝 = 1, … , 𝑁}, (1)  
can be expressed in matrix form as 
 
 
𝒀 = 𝑊𝑇Φ 
(2) 
 
where 𝑾 = [𝑤1, … , 𝑤𝐽3]  is 
a 𝐽2 × 𝐽3  matrix, 𝑤⃗⃗⃗𝑖 =
(𝑤1𝑖, … , 𝑤𝐽2𝑖)
𝑇, Φ = [𝜙⃗⃗1, … , 𝜙⃗⃗𝑁]  is a 𝐽2 × 𝑁  matrix, 𝜙⃗⃗𝑝 =
(𝜙𝑝,1, … , 𝜙𝑝,𝐽2)
𝑇 is the hidden layer output for the pth 
sample, 
specifically, 
 
𝜙𝑝,𝑘 = 𝜙(‖𝑥⃗𝑝 − 𝑐⃗𝑘‖),
 
𝒀 =
 [𝑦1 𝑦2 … 𝑦𝑁] is a 𝐽3 × 𝑁 matrix, and 𝑦⃗𝑝 = (𝑦𝑝,1, … , 𝑦𝑝,𝐽3)
𝑇. 
The RBFN is a universal approximator [17]. If the RBF 
is appropriately chosen, the RBF network can theoretically 
approximate any continuous function arbitrarily well. The 
Gaussian RBF is expressed as 𝜙(𝑟) = exp (−𝑟2/2𝜎2) 
where 𝑟 > 0 represents the distance from a data point 𝑥⃗ to a 
center 𝑐⃗ and 𝜎 is utilized to control the smoothness of the 
interpolating function. The Gaussian RBF is a localized 
RBF with the property that 𝜙(𝑟) → 0 as 𝑟 → ∞.  
Training of a RBFN is usually performed by a two-
phase strategy. During the first phase, suitable centers 𝑐⃗𝑘 
and their corresponding standard deviations, 𝜎𝑘, also known 
as widths or radii are determined. The network weights 𝑾 
are adjusted in the second phase. The training approach that 
is followed in this research is the supervised learning of all 
the parameters by the relatively simple gradient descent 
method.  
B. Training 
There is one output unit for each of the five terrain class 
values (asphalt, carpet, dirt, paving, and tiles). The model 
trained for the ith output unit (class value) is given by: 
 
 
𝑦𝑖(𝑥1, 𝑥2, … , 𝑥𝑚) = 
𝑔 (𝑤𝑖,0 + ∑ 𝑤𝑖,𝑘exp (− ∑ (𝑥𝑗 − 𝑐𝑘)
2
2𝜎𝑔𝑙𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑙
2
𝑚
𝑗=1
)
𝑏
𝑘=1
) , 
 
 
 
(3) 
where the activation function 𝑔(∙) is a logistic function [19]. 
A Gaussian RBF network with the same global variance 
parameter 𝜎𝑔𝑙𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑙  for all RBF centers still has universal 
approximation capability [17]. The appropriate parameter 
values for 𝑤𝑖,𝑘 and 𝜎𝑔𝑙𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑙 are found by identifying a local 
minimum of the penalized squared error on the training data. 
Given 𝑝 classes, the error function can be expressed as 
 
 
𝐿𝑆𝑆𝐸 = (1
2 ∑ ∑ (𝑦𝑘,𝑖 − 𝑓𝑖(𝑥⃗𝑘))

𝑖=1

)
+ (𝜆 ∑ ∑ 𝑤𝑖,𝑘
2
𝑏
𝑘=1
𝑝
𝑖=1
),  
 
 
 
 
 
(4) 
where 𝑦𝑘,𝑖 = 0.99 if data point 𝑥⃗𝑖 has the ith class value, and 
𝑦𝑘,𝑖 = 0.01  otherwise. Instead of using 1.0 and 0.0, the 
values 0.99 and 0.01 are used to aid the optimization process. 
Additionally, in (4), 𝐿𝑆𝑆𝐸, is divided by 𝑛, the number of 
training data points, as this was determined through 
empirical observation to improve convergence with the 
optimization methods used [20]. Standard calculus is utilized 
to find the corresponding partial derivatives, which consist of 
the gradients of the error function with respect to the network 
parameters. Backpropagation is employed to calculate the 
partial derivatives in the same manner as in Multilayer 
perceptrons. The hybrid conjugate gradient descent method 
specified by [21] is used for training. 
Initialization of the network parameters is another 
important aspect of the training procedure. The initial 
weights of the output layer are sampled from 𝒩(0, 0.1). 
This strategy was empirically determined based on the 
familiar heuristic of choosing small, randomly distributed 
initial weights [20]. 
As the k-means algorithm is often used to train the 
hidden layer of the RBFN in an unsupervised process, it is 
utilized to determine the initial hidden unit centers 𝑐𝑘 . 
Furthermore, the initial value of the variance parameter 
𝜎𝑔𝑙𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑙 is set to the maximum squared Euclidian distance 
between any pair of cluster centers. This ensures that the 
initial value of the variance parameter is not too small. The 
learning process is accelerated on a multi-core computer by 
parallelizing the calculation of the error function and its 
gradient on a user-specified number of threads.  
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) such as RBFNs and 
MLPs can be considered as techniques that lie in machine 
learning middle ground, somewhere between artificial 
intelligence and engineering [22]. They use heuristic 
methods, because very often there is no theoretical basis to 
support the decisions about the ANN implementation, as 
well as mathematical techniques, such as mean-square error 
minimization. ANNs are comprised of a large class of 
various architectures. The RBFN and MLP are two of the 
most widely used neural network architectures in literature 
for regression and classification problems [23]. To put the 
application of the RBFN on terrain classification in context, 
an MLP constructed for the same purpose is also examined. 
Both types of neural network structures are good in pattern 
classification problems and also robust classifiers with the 
ability to generalize for imprecise input data. A general 
difference between the RBFN and MLP is that the RBFN 
performs a local type of learning, which is responsive only 
to a limited section of the input space. In contrast, the MLP 
is a more distributed type of approach. The output of an 
RBFN is produced by mapping distances between the input 
vectors and center vectors to outputs through a radial 
function, whereas the MLP output is produced by linear 
combinations of the outputs of hidden layer nodes in which 
a weighted average of the inputs is mapped by every neuron 
through a sigmoid function. In the next section, the MLP 
architecture and training procedure are considered.

III. 
MULTILAYER PERCEPTRONS 
Similar to a RBFN, the MLP neural network is capable 
of arbitrary input-output mapping [24]. With its powerful 
universal approximation capability, it has been shown that 
MLPs with an appropriate number of hidden neurons can 
implement any continuous function. The MLP is extensively 
used in classification, regression, prediction, system 
identification, control, feature extraction, and associative 
memory. An MLP, like a RBFN, is estimated by a 
supervised procedure where the network constructs the 
model based on examples in the data with known outputs. 
A. Architecture 
In most cases, an MLP has several layers of nodes. 
External information is received at the first or lowest layer. 
The problem solution is obtained at the highest layer which 
is an output layer. Between the input layer and output layer 
there are one or more intermediate layers called the hidden 
layers. The number of hidden layers is a very important 
parameter in the network. Bordering nodes are normally 
fully connected from a lower layer to a higher layer. No 
lateral connection between neurons in the same layer, or 
feedback connection is possible. The MLP estimates a 
functional relationship, which can be written as 𝑦 =
𝑓(𝑥1, 𝑥2, … , 𝑥𝑚),  where 𝑥1, 𝑥2, … , 𝑥𝑚  are m independent 
variables and y is the dependent variable. Functionally, the 
MLP in this sense is equivalent to a nonlinear multiple 
regression model. 
A single hidden layer MLP network with h neurons 
(Figure 2) and c outputs has the following form: 
 
 
𝑦𝑐(𝑥1, 𝑥2, … , 𝑥𝑚) = 
𝑔 (𝑤0 + ∑ 𝑤𝑘tanh (𝑤0𝑘 + ∑ 𝑤𝑗𝑘𝑥𝑗
𝑚
𝑗=1
)
ℎ
𝑘=1
),   
 
 
(5) 
 
where 𝑔(∙) is the activation function, and 𝑤𝑖, 𝑤𝑗𝑘  the 
weights.  
 
 
Figure 2. MLP network architecture 
 
The model in (5) can be expressed in matrix form as 𝑦𝑐 =
𝑔(𝑾𝒙 + 𝒃),  where 𝑦𝑐  is the output, 𝑔(∙)  the activation 
function, 𝑾 = [
𝑤1,1
…
𝑤1,𝑚

]  a [𝐻 × 𝑀] weight 
matrix, 𝒙 = [𝑥1, 𝑥2, … , 𝑥𝑚]  the input vector, and 𝒃 =
[𝑏1, 𝑏2, … , 𝑏ℎ] the bias vector [18].  
B. Training 
The backpropagation algorithm used to train an MLP 
was first discovered by [25] and later popularized by [26]. 
During the training phase, a set of input-output pairs is 
utilized for training and is repeatedly presented to the 
network. When training is stopped, the performance of the 
network is tested. The learning algorithm includes a 
forward-propagating step, followed by a backward-
propagating step. On the whole, the algorithm is as follows: 
 
input: training set, weight vector w 
output: optimal weight vector w* 
repeat 
repeat 
repeat 
Initialize the weights w to small random 
values. 
Select an instance t, which is a data point from 
the training set. 
Apply the network input vector to the network. 
Calculate the network output vector z. 
For each of the outputs c, calculate the errors, 
which is the difference (δ) between the target 
output and the network output. 
Minimize this error by calculating the 
necessary updates for the weights (Δw). 
Add the calculated weights’ updates (Δw) to 
the accumulated total updates (ΔW). 
        
until number of instances comprises an epoch 
Adjust the weights (w) of the network by ΔW. 
until all instances in the training set are considered. 
This forms one iteration. 
until the error for the entire system (error δ or cross-
validation set error) is satisfactorily low, or a pre-defined 
number of iterations is completed. 
 
Algorithm 1. Backpropagation algorithm 
During training, the backpropagation algorithm performs 
gradient descent on the error surface by adjusting each 
weight in proportion to the gradient of the error surface at its 
location. It is well known that gradient descent can 
sometimes cause networks to get stuck in a local minimum 
in the error surface should such a local minimum exist. 
These local minima correspond to a partial solution for the 
network given the training data. At best, a global minimum 
is desired (the lowest error value possible), however, the 
local minima are surrounded by higher error values and the 
network usually does not escape these local minima by 
employing the standard algorithm. To get out of a local 
minimum, special techniques should be used. These include

varying the number of hidden units, changing the learning 
parameter (𝛼), but especially by using the momentum term 
(𝜂) in the algorithm. This term is generally chosen between 
0 and 1. Taking into account the momentum term, the 
formula for modifications of weights at epoch t + 1 is given 
by 
 
 
Δ𝑤𝑘𝑗(𝑡 + 1) = 𝜂𝛿𝑘𝑥𝑚 + 𝛼Δ𝑤𝑘𝑗(𝑡), 
   (6) 
 
 
  
where j denotes the specific neuron. The network can 
oscillate, or more seriously, get stuck in a local minimum 
with incorrect values of these parameters. 
Regardless of the many favorable characteristics of 
ANNs, constructing a neural network model for a particular 
problem is a nontrivial task [24]. Modeling issues that have 
an effect on the performance of an ANN must be carefully 
taken into account to ensure the successful application of the 
ANN. These issues are briefly examined next. 
IV. 
ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK MODELING ISSUES 
One of the critical decisions that must be made when 
building an ANN model is to determine a suitable 
architecture, specifically the number of layers, the number 
of nodes in each of the layers, and the number of 
connections that join the nodes. Additional network design 
decisions comprise the choice of activation functions for the 
hidden and output nodes, the training algorithm, data 
normalization or transformation methods, training and test 
data sets, and performance metrics. 
A. Network architecture 
An ANN is normally formed by layers of nodes. All the 
input nodes are grouped in the input layer, all the output 
nodes are in the output layer and the hidden nodes are 
allocated in one or more hidden layers in the middle. When 
constructing the ANN, the following variables must be 
determined: 
 the number of input nodes; 
 the number of hidden layers and hidden nodes; and 
 the number of output nodes. 
Selection of these parameters is inherently dependent on the 
problem. Many different methods to determine the optimal 
architecture of an ANN exist, but many of these methods are 
relatively complex in nature and difficult to implement. 
Examples include the network information criterion [27], 
the polynomial time algorithm [28], the canonical 
decomposition technique [29] and the pruning algorithm 
[30][31]. In addition, none of these methods is able to 
guarantee the optimal solution for all problems. Currently, 
there is no simple explicit method to choose these 
parameters. The guidelines are either based on simulations 
obtained from limited experiments or heuristic in nature. 
Therefore, the design of an ANN can be considered more of 
an art than a science. 
A.1 Number of input nodes 
The number of input nodes coincide with the number of 
variables in the input vector used to model target values. 
Given a specific problem, the number of inputs is usually 
transparent and relatively easy to choose.  
A.2 Number of hidden layers and nodes 
Many successful applications of neural networks are 
highly dependent on the hidden layer(s) and nodes. The 
hidden nodes in the hidden layer(s) enable a neural network 
to detect features, capture patterns in the data and to perform 
complex nonlinear mappings between input and output 
variables. It is evident that without hidden nodes, simple 
perceptrons with linear output nodes are equivalent to linear 
statistical forecasting models. Since theoretical works show 
that a single layer is sufficient for ANNs to approximate any 
complex nonlinear function to any desired accuracy [32], a 
single hidden layer is often used for modeling purposes. 
Unfortunately, one hidden layer networks may involve a 
very large number of hidden nodes, which is undesirable in 
that the network generalization ability and training time will 
get worse. Two or more hidden layer MLPs may provide 
more benefits for some types of problem [33][34]. Many 
authors focus on this problem by considering more than one 
hidden layer. 
Determining the optimal number of hidden nodes is a 
crucial yet complicated issue. In most cases, networks with 
fewer hidden nodes are favored as they overfit less and 
usually have a better generalization ability. However, 
networks with too few hidden nodes may not have enough 
power to model and learn the data. There is no theoretical 
principle for choosing this parameter though a number of 
systematic approaches exist. Methods for increasing hidden 
nodes and pruning out unwanted hidden nodes have been 
proposed. A grid search method used to determine the 
optimal number of hidden nodes was put forward by [35]. 
The most common way to establish the number of hidden 
nodes is by means of experiments or trial-and-error. Various 
rules of thumb have also been suggested such as each 
weight should have at least ten input data points (referring 
to the sample size), and the number of hidden nodes should 
be determined by the number of input patterns. Some 
researchers have presented empirical rules to assist in 
avoiding the overfitting problem by restricting the number 
of hidden nodes [24]. Additionally, the number of hidden 
nodes was limited by a heuristic constraint by [36]. A 
number of practical guidelines exist in the case of the 
common one hidden layer networks, which include 
𝑛
2 [37], 
2𝑛 [38] and 2𝑛 + 1 [39], where 𝑛 denotes the number of 
input nodes. Nevertheless, none of these heuristic choices 
works well for all problem contexts.

A.3 Number of output nodes 
As in the case of the number of input nodes, the number 
of output nodes is relatively easy to determine as it is 
directly related to the problem being modeled.  
B. Interconnection of nodes 
The behavior of a network is essentially determined by 
the connections between nodes. In most applications, the 
networks are fully connected with all nodes in one layer 
being connected to all the nodes in the next, higher layer, 
excluding the output layer. Sparsely connected networks 
[40] or direct connections between input nodes and output 
nodes [41] are, however, possible. The latter may be 
beneficial to predictive accuracy since it can be utilized to 
model the linear structure in the data and might increase the 
recognition power of the network.  
C. Activation function 
The activation function determines the relationship 
between the inputs and outputs of a neuron and the rest of a 
network. This function establishes a degree of nonlinearity 
that is valuable for most ANN applications. In theory, any 
differentiable function can be used as an activation function, 
but in practice, only a small number of activation functions 
are used. Some heuristic rules exist for the selection of the 
activation function. When learning about average behavior 
such as terrain classification, [42] suggests logistic 
activation functions.  
D. Training algorithm 
Training of a neural network is an unconstrained 
nonlinear minimization problem where weights of a network 
are iteratively adjusted to minimize the overall squared error 
or mean between the actual and desired output values for all 
the output nodes over all inputs patterns. Many different 
optimization methods to use for neural network training 
exist. Currently, there is no algorithm available to guarantee 
the global optimal solution for a general nonlinear 
optimization problem in a reasonable amount of time. In 
practice, all optimization algorithms suffer from the local 
optima problem. A solution to this problem is to use the 
available optimization method, which produces the “best” 
local optima if the true global solution is not available. The 
backpropagation algorithm is the most widely used training 
method. 
E. Data normalization 
Nonlinear activation functions such as the hyperbolic 
tangent function usually have a squashing role in restricting 
or compressing the possible output from a node to typically 
(0,1) or (-1, 1). Often, data normalization is performed 
before the training process begins. When nonlinear 
activation functions are used at the output nodes, the desired 
output values must be transformed to the range of the actual 
network outputs. Even when a simple linear output transfer 
function is utilized, it may still be beneficial to standardize 
the outputs together with the inputs to facilitate network 
learning, meet algorithm requirements and to avoid 
computational problems. Four methods to normalize inputs 
are presented by [43]: along channel (independent input 
variable) normalization, across channel (each input vector 
independently) normalization, mixed channel (combinations 
of 
along 
and 
across) 
normalization, 
and 
external 
normalization where all the training data are normalized into 
an explicit range. 
F. Training and test samples 
A training and test sample are typically involved when 
building an ANN model. The training sample is used for 
developing the model and the test sample for evaluating the 
predictive ability of the model. At times a set called the 
validation sample is also put to use to avoid the overfitting 
problem or to determine a stopping point for the training 
process. An important issue is the division of the data into 
the training and validation sets. One common approach is to 
use k-fold cross-validation [44] where a data set (𝒟)  is 
randomly split into k mutually exclusive subsets (the folds) 
𝒟1, 𝒟2, … , 𝒟𝑘. A model is then trained and tested k times; 
for each time 𝑡 ∈ {1, 2, … , 𝑘}, it is trained on 𝒟 ∖ 𝐷𝑡  and 
tested on 𝒟𝑡. The cross-validation estimate of accuracy is 
the overall number of correct classifications divided by the 
number of instances in the data set. 
 
 
G. Performance measures 
In spite of many performance measures for an ANN 
model, such as training time and modeling time, the most 
important measure of performance is the prediction 
accuracy the model can produce beyond training data. 
Nevertheless, academics and practitioners do not universally 
accept a suitable measure of accuracy for a given problem. 
An accuracy measure is frequently defined in terms of the 
prediction error, which is the difference between the desired 
(actual) and the predicted value. There are a number of 
accuracy measures in the prediction literature and each has 
its advantages and limitations [45]. 
In the next section, the experiments that are performed 
to determine the RBFN terrain classification accuracy and 
comparison with an MLP, Naïve Bayes method and SVM 
will be discussed. Modeling issues in Section IV will be 
taken into account to construct the best RBFN and MLP 
architectures.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN 
The aim of the experiments is to identify the type of 
terrain being traveled on by a mobile robot from a list of 
candidate terrains. Figure 3 shows the Lego Mindstorms 
EV3 experimental platform used in the investigation. The 
mobile robot has a Raspberry Pi 2 computer attached to the

front with a Sense HAT inertial measurement unit (IMU) in 
turn connected to the Raspberry Pi. The Sense HAT is 
readily available and includes the following sensors: a 
gyroscope, an accelerometer, and a magnetometer. The 
mobile robot platform is battery powered and moves on 
rubber treads. An additional battery pack (not shown) is 
mounted on top and powers the Raspberry Pi computer. The 
five terrain types used in the study are displayed in Figures 
4 to 8.

The terrain (asphalt, carpet, dirt, paving, or tiles) on 
which the mobile robot is currently travelling is identified in 
real time. The assumption is that the vibrations induced in 
the test vehicle and measured by the output of the IMU 
sensor represent a signature which can be used to accurately 
classify a terrain. The data for each terrain is sampled at an 
irregular rate of ≈ 16
2
3 Hz for a 600-second duration. The 
RBFN is then trained offline using the RBFN training 
scheme discussed in Section II (B) and the MLP by the 
backpropagation algorithm discussed in Section III (B). 
Three outdoor terrains (asphalt, dirt, and paving) and two 
indoor terrains (carpet and tiles) were analyzed.

The RBFN architecture for this specific problem has five 
outputs that serve to identify the terrain type. Each of the 
output values 𝑦𝑖 ∈ [0,1] denotes the likelihood that a given 
signal presented as an input to the RBFN matches one of the 
five candidate terrains. In addition, the RBFN architecture 
has twelve inputs, which correspond to the dimension of the 
input signal data point. Each of these input signal data 
points received from the Sense HAT IMU can be denoted 
as: 
 
[𝑝 𝑟 𝑦 𝑎𝑥 𝑎𝑦 𝑎𝑧 𝑔𝑥 𝑔𝑦 𝑔𝑧 𝑚𝑥 𝑚𝑦 𝑚𝑧], 
 
where 𝑝, 𝑟, and 𝑦 denote the pitch, roll and yaw (measured 
in degrees), 𝑎 is the linear acceleration (𝑚/𝑠2) measured in 
three dimensions (𝑎𝑥, 𝑎𝑦  and 𝑎𝑧),  𝑔  is the rate of turn 
(degrees/seconds), also measured in three dimensions 
(𝑔𝑥, 𝑔𝑦  and 𝑔𝑧)and 𝑚 denotes the earth’s magnetic field

The Weka system [20] was used for data processing, 
presentation, classifier training and testing. The terrain 
classification training data set contained twelve inputs, five 
outputs and a total of 49993 IMU sensor samples.  
Before training started, all inputs in the data were 
normalized to the [0, 1] interval. This data was transformed 
back into the original space when predictions were 
produced. These same transformations were performed for 
new inputs when the predictions were made. 
For the experiments, 10-fold cross-validation was 
performed. Results obtained by the RBFN were compared to 
those found by the MLP model, and default SVM and Naïve 
Bayes techniques. The latter are two popular methods found 
in the literature used for supervised terrain classification 
[11][12]. Sigmoid activation functions were utilized for the 
hidden and output nodes of the MLP architecture. A grid 
search was applied to obtain the best number of RBFN and 
MLP hidden nodes and number of hidden layers for the 
MLP. Coincidentally, the best results were obtained with 
120 hidden nodes for both the RBFN and single hidden 
layer fully connected MLP. In the following section, the 
results will be discussed. 
VI. 
DISCUSSION 
 
The classification accuracy results obtained by the 
experiments are shown in Figure 9.

 Figure 9. Terrain classification results 
From the figure it can be observed that the machine 
learning algorithms, ordered from worst classification 
accuracy to best, are the Naïve Bayes, SVM, RBFN and 
MLP. The latter two techniques produced nearly the same 
classification accuracy with the MLP slightly outperforming 
the RBFN. The results presented in Figure 9 show that the 
RBFN is a feasible terrain classification technique compared 
to the former two models. Although the MLP exhibited a 
slightly higher classification performance than the RBFN, 
the results indicate the good predictive capability of the 
RBFN. In addition, the RBFN applied to terrain 
classification 
has 
the 
following 
advantages 
and 
disadvantages: 
 
 
Compared to the MLP, the RBFN has less model 
complexity, exhibits better comprehensibility, is easier 
to construct due to its simpler fixed three-layer structure 
and has a fast learning algorithm. 
 
Special techniques exist to increase the interpretability 
of RBFNs, thereby reducing the black box effect of 
neural networks in general [46]. 
 
With regards to generalization, RBFNs can respond 
well for patterns which are not used for training [47]. 
 
The stability of the designed RBFN model is enhanced 
by its strong tolerance to input noise [47]. 
 
An ensemble of RBFN models can be constructed to 
increase the accuracy of a RBFN model. In some cases, 
this ensemble model can surpass an MLP model [48] in 
terms of classification accuracy. 
 
No pre-processing of the input sensor data is performed 
as in some previous studies. 
 
Classification of the terrain can be performed in real 
time because of the onboard IMU contact sensor. 
 
In 
terms 
of 
predictive 
accuracy, 
the 
RBFN 
outperformed the Naïve Bayes technique and the SVM 
model by a relatively large margin. 
 
A limitation of the RBFN model, however, is that it has 
greater difficulties if the number of hidden units is large 
and it is more sensitive to dimensionality [23]. 
 
Based on the small difference in classification accuracy 
between the RBFN and the MLP and the advantages of the 
RBFN, it can be concluded that it is reasonable to consider 
the RBFN as a competitive method for supervised terrain 
classification. 
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, real-time classification of five given 
terrains was performed with a RBFN. In contrast to some 
other techniques found in the literature, no pre-processing of 
the mobile robot platform’s IMU vibration sensor data was 
performed. Eliminating feature extraction reduces the 
computational overhead needed to identify the terrain in 
real-time. The results have shown that even without feature 
extraction, the RBFN is still a feasible model for contact 
sensor-based terrain classification compared to other 
popular models used for this task. It can be used as an 
alternative to the MLP model due to its simpler structure 
and shorter training times. The RBFN has the capability to 
accurately recognize complex vibration signature patterns 
and can easily adapt to new terrain signatures by providing 
the model with new training examples. Unfortunately, 
compared to the other techniques, offline training of the 
model can be time consuming. 
Future work includes a more detailed comparison with 
the existing methods. Metrics, such as latency (velocity) can 
be included in the results. Finally, an investigation into the 
feasibility of the RBFN model applied to other types of 
robots and how they must be adapted for this task can be 
performed.
