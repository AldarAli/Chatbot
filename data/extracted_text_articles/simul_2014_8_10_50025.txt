Abstract— Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs), such 
as the Global Positioning System (GPS) in the USA, the 
GLObal NAvigation Satellite System (GLONASS) in Russia, 
and the Galileo in the EU, determine a target position using a 
satellite signal. They are widely used around the globe at this 
time. However, there is a critical obstacle when attempting to 
run a navigation system in a land vehicle. In contrast to 
aircraft or vessels, which operate in open areas without any 
obstacles, land vehicles must deal with signal occlusion caused 
by surrounding buildings, skyscrapers and other objects, 
especially in urban areas. In order to solve this problem, many 
researchers have studied many different methods, such as 
GPS/GLONASS-integrated positioning; pseudolite, which 
produces a signal similar to that of GPS; and GPS/Vision 
integrated positioning. These studies have mainly focused on 
integrated positioning methods. In contrast, this paper focuses 
on the relationship between the position of a new signal 
generator and positioning error for high-accuracy positioning 
in GPS shaded areas using simulation analysis. Through this 
analysis, we confirmed that horizontal positioning error is the 
lowest (10m) in the urban canyon when the degrees of 
geometric stability is the best.

 INTRODUCTION  
Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs), such as 
the Global Positioning System (GPS) in the USA, the 
GLObal NAvigation Satellite System (GLONASS) in Russia, 
and the Galileo in the EU, determine a target position using a 
satellite signal. At present, they are widely used around the 
globe. Since Selective Availability (SA) was released, the 
use of such systems has become prevalent in applications 
ranging from navigation systems for transportation to mobile 
smart phones. However, there is a critical obstacle when 
running the navigation system in land vehicles. In contrast to 
aircraft or vessels, which operate in open areas without any 
obstacles, a land vehicle must deal with signal occlusion 
caused by surrounding buildings, skyscrapers and other 
objects, especially in urban areas. Many researchers have 
attempted to solve this problem with various methods, such 
as GPS/GLONASS-integrated positioning [1], pseudolite, 
which produces a signal similar to that of GPS [2], and 
GPS/Vision integrated positioning [3]. These studies have 
mainly focused on integrated positioning methods with a 
new signal. In contrast, we focus on the relationship between 
the position of a new signal generator and positioning error 
for high-accuracy positioning in GPS shaded areas. 
For this analysis, we developed a simulator using 
MATLAB, the configuration of which is described in section 
2. The developed simulator generates GPS observation data 
with a variety of errors, such as ionospheric delays, 
tropospheric delays and clock errors. Moreover, the 
simulator filters some signals which are occluded by 
obstacles such as tall buildings.  
Using this simulator, GPS positioning errors were 
analyzed in diverse road environments, such as housing areas 
and urban canyons. These results are described in section 3.  
The simulator is also able to generate a new signal 
virtually and then perform integrated positioning using GPS 
and the new signal data. In section 4, the integrated 
positioning errors were analyzed according to the new signal 
generator’s position. 
Through this simulation analysis, we found that the 
accuracy of new signals and their degrees of geometric 
stability should be considered for highly accurate positioning. 
This paper starts with the simulator description in section 
2, then GPS positioning errors are analyzed in section 3. In 
section 4, the integrated positioning errors were analyzed. 
The conclusion of this paper is described in section 5.

We developed a simulator to perform an error analysis of 
GPS positioning and integrated positioning with a new signal 
to enhance the degree of positioning stability.

The configuration of the simulator consists of three 
modules [4]: the urban environment data-generating module, 
the GPS data-generating module, and the error data-
generating module. Figure 1 shows the configuration of the 
simulator.  
The urban environment data-generating module produces 
building coordinate data based on a reference position, the 
GPS data-generating module makes the observation data 
similar to actual GPS observation data, and the error data-
generating module calculates observation errors based on 
models. 
A. Simulator configuration 
The input parameters – the observation time, receiver’s 
reference position coordinates, the road width, the building 
height and the new signal generator interval for generating 
simulation data – are set in the urban environment generating 
module. According to the parameter settings, three-
dimensional coordinates of virtual buildings, the new signal 
generator and the receiver position data (reference data) are 
generated with an Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed (ECEF) 
coordinate. Figure 2 shows an example of the output data 
from the urban environment data-generating module. 
The GPS data-generating module generates the Receiver 
Independent Exchange Format (RINEX) as a GPS 
observation file and performs GPS positioning and integrated 
positioning. This module imports the reference data and 
extracts the observation time and receiver’s position 
coordinates from the data. The satellites orbit information, 
clock data and other parameters are downloaded from the 
International GNSS Service (IGS) [5] site to determine the 
satellite’s position and generate the error data. Next, this 
module calculates the satellite position at every epoch using 
this data. The Line-Of-Sight (LOS) is calculated based on the 
satellite and receiver position, and visible satellites are 
filtered at the receiver’s position. Some errors are added to 
this LOS using the error data-generating module, and the 
final observation data are generated in the RINEX format 
after line (LOS)-polygon (building data) collision checking 
[6]. Using the GPS and new signal data or only GPS data, 
positioning is performed in this module. Stand-alone L1 
Coarse/Acquisition (C/A) code positioning and an integrated 
positioning algorithm (the least-squares method) were used 
in this study, and the results are in ECEF coordinates [3]. 
The error data-generating module simulates errors related 
to GPS observations. These errors are classified into four 
types: satellite-dependent errors, atmosphere-induced errors, 
receiver-dependent errors, and other errors. Table 1 presents 
the details of the error modeling step. Each error can be 
modeled or calculated using a model and data files from the 
IGS and the Center for Orbit Determination in Europe 
(CODE) sites. 
Finally, the positioning error is analyzed compared with 
the reference data and a plot of a related graph. For 
directional analysis, the positioning results are converted to 
North-East-Down (NED) coordinates.

Table 3 and Figure 3 show the error analysis by the 
simulator. Generally, a horizontal error in GPS positioning 
using C/A code data is 2-3 m and the vertical error is twice 
as much [10]. Through the error analysis result, the simulator 
is verified. 
 
III. 
GPS POSITIONING ERROR ANALYSIS IN A DIVERSE 
ROAD ENVIRONMENT  
Diverse road environments were formulated by the 
proposed simulator. The number of visible satellites, the 
number of estimated positions, the directional error, and 
other factors are analyzed in this section. Four types of 
simulation environments were set. CASE 1 assumed an open 
sky environment without any buildings as a reference for 
comparison with other scenarios. CASE 2 was set as a 
housing area that has two-story buildings (height 5 m) and a 
road width of 16 m. A commercial area was assumed in 
CASE 3, which has ten-story buildings (25 m) and a road 
width of 36 m. Finally, CASE 4 was set as an urban canyon 
that is surrounded by thirty-story buildings (height 75 m) and 
a road width of 68 m. For convenient analysis, some 
conditions were fixed in all cases: the road was assumed to 
run from south to north and the buildings were built next to 
the road (west and east) [4]. 
The above scenario’s observation period was from 
2013.09.01 00:00:00-11:59:59 and the time interval was 150 
seconds. Since the orbital period of GPS satellites are about 
12 hours, the observation time should be 12 hours for a 
reliable analysis. The receiver’s position was identical to that 
of the Suwon continuously operating GPS/GNSS reference 
stations, which is the national reference station. 
The results of the simulation analysis are as shown below.

 In CASE 2 (the housing area), the positioning error did 
not increase compared to CASE 1 (open sky). However, 
CASE 3 (the commercial area) and CASE 4 (the urban

canyon) had greater positioning errors than CASE 1. In 
particular, the positioning of CASE 4 was virtually 
impossible with the number of estimated positions at 56 
during the observation time 
Figure 4 shows sky plots of all scenarios. The sky plots 
express the satellite’s azimuth angle and elevation angle 
based on the receiver’s position. The buildings that occlude 
the signals are illustrated in blue masking. The visible 
satellites of CASE 2 are similar to those of CASE 1. 
Satellites are visible above 60-degree elevation angles in the 
worst environment, which is CASE 4.

The number of satellites ranges from 0 to 5 in CASE 4, 
indicating that the CASE 4 environment is the worst. 
Although the number of satellites occasionally exceeds four, 
it is less than four during most observation periods. 
Therefore, the position coordinate cannot be calculated and 
GPS positioning is useless in the urban canyon environment. 
Hence, new signals that offset GPS for stable positioning 
should be installed. 
IV. 
INTEGRATED POSITIONING ERROR ANALYSIS IN A 
DIVERSE ROAD ENVIRONMENT  
Using the results from section 3, we discuss integrated 
positioning in this section. Unlike other studies, this study 
focused on the relationship between the signal generator’s 
position and the signal’s error instead of the integrated 
positioning algorithm. Pseudolite positioning and vision-
integrated positioning both use distance data from the 
generator (landmark) to the receiver (camera) as observation 
values when using the least-square model. Therefore, the 
generator’s placement or the landmark’s placement has the 
same effect on the integrated positioning error. Hence, a new 
signal is used as a representative term. 
Because CASE 4 is the worst environment, we assumed a 
situation in which the signal generator is installed in that 
environment. 
Under 
this 
assumption, 
an 
integrated 
positioning error analysis depending on the generator 
position was performed. 
The position of the new signal generator was assumed to 
be on the building’s roof with a height of 75 m, and it was 
installed from 10 m to 200 m at 10 m intervals. Because the 
minimum number of satellites is zero, four new signal 
generators needed to be installed for stable positioning. The 
position was set on both sides of the receiver. The signal had 
a 10% systemic error according to its distance, and random 
error of 0.3 m. 
Because the total number of observation signals was 
always four in this case, the possibility of integrated 
positioning was 100% (288/288 epoch). Its directional error 
according to the generator’s installation interval is shown in 
Figure 6.  
 
 
Figure 6.  Directional error of the integrated positioning 
The horizontal error was worse at the 10 m interval than 
the others, though the signal error was lowest. A 100 m 
interval resulted in the best performance in the simulation. 
This was caused by geometric stability; but the positioning 
error started increasing at the 200 m interval on account of 
the increase in the new signal error. This analysis is 
confirmed by Figure 7. Figure 7 shows a sky plot, with the 
generator positions of the new signals illustrated as white

dots. This figure confirms that the geometrical placement of 
the interval at 10 m is very unstable. When the interval 
increases, the geometrical stability improves.

Consequentially, the degree of geometrical stability and 
the amount of signal error should be considered at the same 
time during the installation of a new signal generator. This 
will guarantee the best positioning performance and stability. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, for GPS, which is a general GNSS, 
positioning errors were analyzed according to diverse 
environments for land vehicles using a custom-made 
simulator. GPS positioning was impossible in some epochs, 
or the errors were too large to use it in areas with buildings 
over ten stories. Especially in road environments surrounded 
by thirty-story buildings, it was almost impossible to 
calculate the position. In such areas, new signal generators 
were installed from 10 m to 200 m at 10 m intervals in a 
simulated environment, and the integrated positioning was 
performed using the new signals and GPS. The simulator 
generated the new signals with a 10% systemic error rate. 
Our results confirm that a 100 m interval gives the best 
performance in this type of simulation. This is due to the 
feasible geometric stability, but the positioning error started 
increasing at a 200 m interval on account of the new signal 
error.  
Through this simulation analysis, we confirmed that the 
accuracy of signals and their degrees of geometric stability 
should be considered simultaneously when attempting to 
solve GPS shaded areas. The proposed simulator can be used 
in the planning step for solving systems in GPS shaded areas. 
This developed simulator can also be used for analyses of 
multipath effects because simulation data does not have 
multipath errors despite the fact that it is used for general 
positioning error analysis. In the future, phase positioning 
errors will be analyzed by an upgraded simulator. This study 
will also be used to investigate diverse GPS environments 
and integrated positioning errors with new signals.
