Abstract—Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) messaging plays an important
role in cooperative intelligent transportation systems (CITS),
which are advanced applications addressing the problems of
road transport management. In this regard, the Cooperative
Awareness Message (CAM) protocol is standardized in EU for
V2V messaging. However, V2V messages work well only when
all vehicles have transmitters and work well in short range and
no obstacle. To solve the former problem, the existance of the
non-ITS road users, in the early deployment phase, we previously
proposed a system called Proxy CAM, wherein roadside sensors
detect target vehicles and transmit V2V messages on behalf
of the vehicles. However, the V2V transmission range is still
limited to the wireless range of IEEE802.11p. Therefore, in this
study, we propose a system that delivers CAMs over the Internet
using UDP/IPv6 and LTE in addition to the standard speci-
ﬁcation (i.e., the Basic Transportation Protocol/GeoNetworking
and IEEE802.11p). Moreover, we implement the cellular network
component of the system and evaluate its performance in terms
of the packet delivery ratio and packet delay for various distances
and packet frequencies. In our evaluation, we deﬁne the average
Proxy CAM update delay and calculate this parameter for
both IEEE802.11p and LTE. We ﬁnd that using LTE over long
distances is more efﬁcient than using IEEE802.11p.

INTRODUCTION
The problem of vehicular trafﬁc, particularly trafﬁc jams
and accidents, has become one of the most important issues in
the world today. In this context, intelligent transport systems
(ITSs) have been designed to solve this problem via acquiring
and sharing trafﬁc information from vehicle sensors or other
devices. Examples of ITS include Vehicle Information and
Communication Systems (VICS) [1], which automatically re-
ceive information about trafﬁc jams and road construction from
roadside beacons via FM multiplex broadcasting and electronic
toll collection systems (ETCSs) [2] installed at the entrances
and exits of highways by communicating with vehicles via
radio waves. In particular, ITSs that communicate trafﬁc infor-
mation with other ITSs to improve vehicle safety, durability,
efﬁciency, and comfort are called cooperative ITSs (CITSs). A
typical CITS consists of an application layer, facilities layer,
network&transport layer, access layer, management layer, and
security layer [3].
A CITS communicates by means of Cooperative Awareness
Messages (CAMs) [4] and Decentralized Environmental No-
tiﬁcation Message (DENM) [5] protocols. A CAM contains
information on the positions and movements of road users
(vehicles, bicycles, pedestrians) along with other dynamic
information. According to [4], all ITS-installed devices are
encouraged to create and broadcast messages with the use of
CAM, and the desirable frequency range for CAM broadcast-
ing is 1 to 10 Hz. Further, single-hop broadcasting is also
desirable. Upon receiving CAM information, a CITS processes
the CAM to update the Local Dynamic Map (LDM) [6].
The Cooperative Awareness basic service (CA basic service)
in the facilities layer, the Basic Transport Protocol (BTP)
[7]/GeoNetworking(GN) [8] in the network&transport layer,
and IEEE802.11p [9] in the access layer are used to send
and receive CAMs. The CA basic service also manages to
encode and decode CAMs and provide CAM information to
the LDM and application layer, while BTP provides end-to-
end connectionless communication. This protocol is aimed
at transmitting multiple messages from different processes in
the facilities layer at the same time along one packet path.
However, it is to be noted that BTP does not guarantee the
order, integrity, and reliability of packets. Meanwhile, the
GN protocol provides the packet path while IEEE802.11p
speciﬁes the wireless communication system developed for
communication between vehicles. This makes communication
between fast-moving vehicles possible in the frequency band of
5.85∼5.925 GHz. The bandwidth is narrow compared to other
IEEE802.11 series, and therefore, the communication speed is
less, but resistance to multipath propagation is strong.
A CITS cannot function without communicating with other
vehicles; however, there are certain problems with the current
communication protocols. First, the communication protocols
do not cover non-CITS road users such as vehicles with no
CITS and pedestrians. In this regard, it is noteworthy that there
are no CITS products commercially available today in Japan.
Thus, the commercialization of CITS vehicles requires the
system functionality to detect neighboring non-CITS vehicles
and pedestrians. While computer vision can be utilized to solve
this problem, there is a possibility that computer vision cannot
detect vehicles in the case that they are in blind spots. There
are always blind spots at intersections, and vehicles may not
be able to avoid accidents with other vehicles or pedestrians
emerging from such blind spots. Second, IEEE802.11p uses the
frequency band, 5.85∼5.925 GHz. This range of frequencies
is so high that these waves hardly undergo diffraction; thus,
they cannot travel around obstacles. Finally, the signal strength
of such wireless radio systems also decreases with increasing
distance.
In the above context, this study proposes the usage of
cellular networks (UDP/IP) and LTE in addition to the orig-
inal Proxy CAM [10] system’s protocol stack, BTP/GN +
IEEE802.11p, to solve the abovementioned problems. In our

study, we design a Remote Proxy CAM system that uses com-
puter vision sensors installed along the roadside to generate
Proxy CAMs from the acquired images and broadcasts them
using BTP/GN + IEEE802.11p (as does the original Proxy
CAM system). In addition, the Remote Proxy CAM system
uses a server-client model to send request-based Proxy CAMs
to the client.
In the study, we also implement a prototype of a part of
this system using a cell phone, and we measure the latency
and delivery ratio of the packets. We ﬁnd that packets using
UDP/IP + LTE exhibit short delay times and high delivery
ratios and function efﬁciently over long distances.

RELATED WORKS
In this section, we introduce and discuss two main related
concepts, Proxy CAM and cloud-based pedestrian road-safety.
The Proxy CAM approach is used to generate CAMs by proxy
while cloud-based pedestrian road-safety involves communica-
tion between vehicles and pedestrians using a cellular network.
A. Proxy CAM
In general, when CITS cars broadcast their CAM infor-
mation in the vicinity of obstacles such as buildings, there
is a possibility that the CAMs cannot reach cars the other
side of the buildings, which may lead to accidents. Further,
the presence of non-CITS cars (which cannot broadcast their
CAM information) cannot be detected by CITS cars without
computer vision. To solve this problem, we propose the Proxy
CAM [10] system that works with any vehicle-sensing technol-
ogy. This system consists of a roadside sensor, sensor fusion
database, Proxy CAM generator, and Proxy CAM transmitter.
In our scheme, ﬁrst, roadside sensors detect vehicles and
acquire their position, speed, acceleration, and other optional
information. Next, the sensors tag each vehicle with an ID
that is sent to the sensor fusion database along with the other
information. Any type of road trafﬁc sensor can be utilized
with the system if it can detect vehicles and acquire the
relevant information. The sensor fusion database receives the
vehicle data and stores it in the sensor fusion local dynamic
map (SFLDM). This database also has the functionality to
identify a single vehicle from the data from multiple sensors
and integrate the data. Next, the Proxy CAM generator uses
the SFLDM and composes Proxy CAMs. Some of the CAM
ﬁelds are labeled as ‘unknown’. The Station ID ﬁeld of the
proxy CAM contains 24 bits set to ‘1’ and 8 random bits.
If the sensor or SFLDM identiﬁes the vehicle information as
that of a previously detected vehicle, the Station ID ﬁeld of
its Proxy CAM is set to the same value as the one created
previously. Finally, the Proxy CAM transmitters broadcast the
generated Proxy CAMs using the ETSI standard protocols,
BTP/GN in the networking&transport layer, and IEEE802.11p
in the access layer. The CAM transmitters should be installed
at locations ensuring a clear line-of-sight to the vehicles.
B. Cloud-Based Pedestrian Road-Safety
Pedestrians can be detected only with the use of computer
vision by CITS cars because pedestrians cannot create and
broadcast CAMs. However, the accuracy of computer vision
depends on the weather and daylight conditions (day or night).
Thus, to accurately detect the presence of pedestrians, we need
another method. In this regard, in a previous study [11], the
authors used the cell phones of pedestrians to communicate
with CITS cars. However, CITS cars can only communicate
using IEEE802.11p while cell phones do not use IEEE802.11p.
Thus, the authors of the study installed cell phones in CITS
cars, and the phones were connected to the CITS. However,
in cellular networks, broadcasting is not allowed. Thus, the
authors used a cloud server to communicate with pedestrian
and the CITS cell phones. In the scheme, both sets of cell
phones (vehicular and pedestrian) always send their positions
to the server. The pedestrian’s cell phone communicates at low
frequencies because the communication consumes electrical
power and the capacity of the cell phone battery is limited.
The server always veriﬁes the positions of both the pedestrian
and CITS phones. If the two parties approach each other, the
server sends a request to the pedestrian’s cell phone to switch
the communication frequency to ‘high’. After receiving the
request, the pedestrian’s cell phone switches to the designated
high frequency. If the server estimates the possibility of a
collision between the pedestrian and car, it sends an alert
message to both of them.
C. Other Research
Our approach is also inspired by several other relevant
studies, which we brieﬂy present here. In [12], the authors
used power lines to communicate between ITS users and
the transport management system. In [13], Vehicular Ad-Hoc
Networks (VANETs) were utilized for communication, and
the authors designed two VANET sampling protocols named
SAME and TOME to collect vehicular trafﬁc information and
detect incidents in real-time. Further, [14] used parked cars to
forward CAMs from cars on the opposite sides of a building.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
In this section, we discuss the problems of Proxy CAM in
detail. Subsequently, we analyze the design requirements for
the solution.
A. Problem
Figure 1 illustrates the operation of Proxy CAM and the
problems of the system. The Proxy CAM device 1) detects the
target vehicle and 2) delivers the proxy CAM to the receiver
over IEEE802.11p. However, the system suffers from two
signiﬁcant problems, as described below.

1) Limited wireless range: As indicated by label a) in
Figure 1, we observe that a message cannot be delivered
beyond the wireless range. According to [15], if a car drives
at 60 km/h, IEEE802.11p’s packet delivery ratio (PDR) is
nearly 100% for a received signal strength indicator (RSSI)
value of -85 (about 800 m). However, the authors performed
their experiments on level land in the absence of buildings
and other electromagnetic interference; on the other hand,
urban environments contain buildings and other forms of
electromagnetic waves, which can lead to packet delivery
failure beyond certain distances. Further, [10] have reported
that the packet reach distance is about 60∼70 m if there are
buildings in the environment. Moreover, a CITS vehicle at 60
km/h cannot stop before an intersection. Thus, it is necessary
to widen the coverage of Proxy CAM transmission.
2) Interference and Obstacles: Theoretically, Proxy CAMs
can be received at roads connected to intersections. However,
if a car is in a situation where another obstacle blocks the line
of sight to the CAM transmitter, as indicated by label b) of
Figure 1, it cannot receive Proxy CAMs. Further, if there is a
vehicle such as a truck between a car and Proxy CAM device,
the car cannot receive Proxy CAMs. Therefore, it is necessary
to ensure that the Proxy CAMs surmount such obstacles.

(CAM).
B. Requirements
To solve the abovementioned problems, we designed a
system that uses a new protocol stack in addition to the original
protocol stack, BTP/GN + IEEE802.11p. The following section
lists the requirements of the new system.
1) Message Transmission Coverage: In urban environ-
ments, CAMs should be able to cover a range of distances.
Our system can send CAMs to everyone in the coverage area
regardless of the presence of buildings or large vehicles.
2) Availability: A CAM contains information regarding
neighboring cars. Thus, the unavailability of a CAM for even
5 s can lead to an accident. Consequently, a system should
allow CAMs to be sent any given time. Importantly, the
communication should be stable (i.e., the PDR should be
nearly 100%).
3) Real-Time Information: The position of a vehicle is dy-
namic, and therefore, CITS cars should always obtain updated
information reﬂecting the real-time situation. That is, the time
between the creation of a CAM and its reception should be
as short as possible. Moreover, delays in sensing and message
transmission must be minimized.
4) Using existing protocol and wireless communication
system: For interoperability among countries, CITSs are de-
veloped based on a given architecture, protocols, and technolo-
gies. From the perspective of practical application, the system
should not use new resources; it should consist of existing
protocols and use wireless communication.
IV.
REMOTE PROXY CAM
To satisfy the abovementioned requirements, we designed
the Remote Proxy CAM.
A. System Design
In our system, we use LTE and the cellular network to
satisfy the communication requirements. Since broadcasting
is not allowed in cellular networks, we use unicast com-
munication to access the dynamic vehicular information. We
use IPv6 for the Remote Proxy CAM because it fulﬁlls
the CITS requirements through its extended address space,
embedded security, enhanced mobility support, and ease of
conﬁguration. It also uses UDP because the delivered message
comprises real-time data. By using UDP/IPv6, the packet can
be transmitted over the LTE and a cellular network. Figure 2
shows the protocol stack of the proposed method. The vehicle
with our proposed system receives Proxy CAMs via BTP/GN
+ IEEE802.11p as well as UDP/IPv6 + LTE.

Figure 2. Protocol stack of Proxy Cooperative Awareness Message (CAM).
Figure 3 shows the overview of the proposed method. First,
a roadside computer vision sensor detects vehicles around the
intersection and creates the corresponding CAMs. Next, the
sensor broadcasts the CAMs. At the same time, the vehicle
sends a Remote Proxy CAM request to the Proxy CAM
device along the vehicle route as per the demand of the ITS
application. When the Proxy CAM device receives a request
message from a vehicle via the cellular network, it sends a
Proxy CAM reply to the vehicle via the cellular network. If
the vehicle receives Proxy CAMs via both IEEE802.11p and
LTE, it updates the LDM entry with the newest information.
Here, we remark that the IP address discovery of the
Proxy CAM device is out of the scope of the paper. Possible
solutions for the IP address discovery include embedding the
IP address in the digital map, downloading the static list of IP
addresses, or resolving the IPv6 address from the geographical
information by means of a DNS-like system.

1) Vehicle: A vehicle sends a request message for CAMs to
the nearest Proxy CAM device along the vehicle route via the
cellular network using UDP/IPv6 and LTE. If the vehicle does
not receive a CAM response from the Proxy CAM devices
after a given interval, it sends a request again. The vehicle
always checks for CAMs using IEEE802.11p or LTE, and if
it receives CAMs, it updates its LDM with the newest ones.
2) Proxy CAM device: The created CAMs are broadcasted
using standard protocols based on ISO and ETSI. Our broad-
cast uses IEEE802.11p in the access layer and BTP and GN in
network&transport layer. At the same time, the created CAMs
are transmitted to vehicles that have sent requests for CAMs
in the unicast via the cellular network. This communication
uses LTE in the access layer and UDP and IPv6 in the
network&transport layer. Further, this transmission continues
for a speciﬁed interval, after which it is terminated. The
transmission is resumed if the Proxy CAM device again
receives a request.

B. System Implementation
We implemented the cellular network part of our designed
system as shown in Figure 4. We used the cellular device, REI
(FTJ161B-REI) manufactured by FREETEL, in our study. We
tethered the cellular device and the receiver through a USB
cable. Our program was written in C language.
1) Transmitter: We used the LGN-20-00 transmitter man-
ufactured by Commsignia Ltd. as the packet transmitter. The
transmitter communicated with the router via a 50-m-long
Ethernet cable in the access layer (Figure 4(a)). The router
and receiver were connected via a 30-m-long Ethernet cable,
and the transmitter was conﬁgured to send packets through
the cable in order to measure the reference value of the
delay (Figure 4(b)). These two sets of communications used
UDP/IPv6 in the network&transport layer. We used multicast
for pathway (a) and unicast for pathway (b) in Figure 4. The
transmitter used a single program to send the same packet
along the two paths. In order to realize the Pub/Sub model
based on which the Proxy CAM device sends CAMs via
the cellular network after receiving a request, the transmitter
begins to function after receiving a request packet via pathway
(a). The IP address of the destination in pathway (a) is the
sender IP address in the request packet. As regards pathway
(b), we set the global IP address of the receiver interface in
advance.
2) Router: In our study, we used the PR-400NE man-
ufactured by NTT as the router. The router and receiver
were connected by means of a 35-m-long Ethernet cable. The
ﬁrewall did not ﬁlter any kinds of IPv6 packets.
3) Reciever: We used the Tier PC Note GTX970M as
the packet receiver. The processors in the device include the
Intel Core i7-4720HQ CPU @ 2.60 GHz×8, with a memory
capacity of 31.3 GB and the OS being Ubuntu 15.04. We
tethered the receiver and cellular device through a USB cable.
We used two programs: one to receive the packets via pathway
(a), and the other to receive the packets via pathway (b). To
realize the Pub/Sub model, we ensured that the receiver sent
a request packet ﬁrst.

EVALUATION
We evaluated the implementation of our proposed method
in terms of the PDR and delay. We performed our experiments
in a residential area. In the experiment, ﬁrst, the transmitter
is set to create sockets for pathways (a) and (b) in Figure 4
and to wait for the CAM request via pathway (a). When the
transmitter receives the request, it sends out a given number of
packets at a predetermined frequency. The size of each packet
is 300 bytes, and there is a number in a certain packet that
identiﬁes it as the ﬁrst packet. Next, the receiver creates sockets
for pathways (a) and (b) and ﬁles to record the result. When
the receiver receives a packet, it obtains the reception time
using the gettimeofday function from sys/time.h and
records the time to the ﬁle. After our experiment, we compared
the reception time of the same number packets of the two ﬁles
and measured the delay obtained using pathway (a).
We performed our experiments at frequencies of 1, 5, 10,
50, 100, 500, 1000 Hz and distances of 10, 30, and 50 m. To
ensure that the PDR was more than three signiﬁcant ﬁgures and
the experiment time more than 60 s, we set the total number
of packets as 100 for 1 Hz, 300 for 5 Hz, 600 for 10 Hz, 3000
for 50 Hz, 6000 for 100 Hz, 30000 for 500 Hz, and 60000 for
1000 Hz.
A. Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR)
The following table lists the PDR results of our experi-
ments. From the table, we note that the PDR hardly depends
on the frequency and distance. The maximum packet loss rate
is 0.08%. In theory, it can also be said that the distance between
the transmitter and the receiver does not matter because com-
munication occurs between a cellular device and a base station.
This experiment demonstrates that communication between the
transmitter and receiver using the cellular network, UDP/IPv6
+ LTE, is possible nearly 100% of the time regardless of the
frequency and distance.

B. Packet Delay
Figures 5,6, and 7 depict the packet delay for different
frequencies and distances. When we performed the experiment
at 1000 Hz, the transmitter could not generate packets every
0.001 s. Therefore, we have excluded the result for 1000 Hz.
The overall results indicate that the delay does not depend on
the distance; it is constant at about 30 ms. As mentioned in the
PDR section, the distance between the transmitter and receiver
does not matter in theory.
Next, we attempt to further understand the implications
of our results. First, to evaluate our results, we deﬁned the
misregistration delay as the time from the transmission of a
CAM from a Proxy CAM device to the reception of the next
CAM at the vehicle. This parameter indicates the difference
in the position of the vehicle in terms of the CAM and the
position of the vehicle in reality. We deﬁned this parameter as
the sum of the CAM reception interval and the packet delay.
The reception interval can be calculated as the product of the
CAM transmission interval and the reciprocal of the PDR. We
deﬁned the PDR as pP CAM, frequency of CAM transmission
as fP CAM, and packet delay as tP CAM−trans. Consequently,
the misregistration was calculated using Equation (1).

×

+ tP CAM−trans
(1)
We calculated the misregistration delay from our results.
We assumed the frequency of the CAM transmission as 10 Hz
for the maximum desirable CAM broadcast frequency of 10
Hz according to [4]. We set the PDR to 1 because the results
indicate that the PDR did not depend on the frequency and
distance; further, the PDR was nearly 1. We also set the packet
delay to 0.03 seconds. With these values, the misregistration
delay was estimated as 0.13 seconds. We did not perform
experiments using BTP/GN + IEEE802.11p, since it is not
legal for application outside Japan. Therefore, we applied the
result of the IEEE802.11b/g protocol as per the ﬁeld test of
[10]. In this case, the PDR was 90%, 80%, and 75% for
distances of 10 m, 30 m, and 50 m, respectively. For the
packet delay, the distance between the transmitter and receiver
was a maximum of 50 m, and the electromagnetic signals
were considered to travel instantaneously, i.e., the time of
signal travel was 0 s. For these abovementioned values, the
misregistration delay was estimated as 0.11 s, 0.126 s, and
0.133 s for distances of 10 m, 30 m, and 50 m, respectively.
Upon comparing the misregistration delay of UDP/IPv6 +
LTE with that of BTP/GN + IEEE802.11b/g, we concluded
that UDP/IPv6 + LTE and BTP/GN + IEEE802.11b/g perform
equivalently in terms of the performance speed.
C. Analysis on intersection scenario
Here, we discuss how our proposed method improves
pedestrian and vehicular safety at intersections with respect to
vehicle distance and approach speed towards an intersection.
Let us consider the situation that a vehicle is approaching
an intersection with an obstacle close by. To avoid collision
with the obstacle, the vehicle must stop before it enters the
intersection. In this study, we analyzed the distance required
for the vehicle to stop before entering the intersection for the
initial speed of the vehicle. We denoted the distance between
the initial position of the vehicle and the intersection as d,
its deceleration as m, which is assumed constant during the
scenario, initial vehicle speed as υ0, and time interval from
the instant of consideration as t. The safe distance to avoid
collision can be calculated using Equation (2) as follows:
d =
∫ υ0/m

υ(t)dt = 1

where υ(t) denotes the speed of the vehicle at time t and
υ0 = υ(0) the initial speed of the vehicle. Figure 8 depicts

Figure 8. Safe stopping distances for various initial distances to intersection
and initial vehicle speeds.
In this ﬁgure, the region under the black curve (colored
in red) indicates the unsafe distance-and-speed range, i.e., the
vehicle is moving too fast, and it cannot stop before entering
the intersection. The other four regions lying above the curve
correspond to speeds and distances over which the vehicle
can stop before entering the intersection if it receives a CAM
or the driver sights the object/obstacle beforehand. There are
four possible collision-prevention solutions corresponding to
receiving a CAM or sighting the obstacle. Here, we summarize
the effective distance for each solution. The ﬁrst solution
corresponds to sighting of the obstacle by the human eye
or computer vision, which works well if the obstacle can
be noticed. In the situation that the obstacle is in a blind
spot, effective preventive action can only be taken when the
vehicle is very close to the obstacle. Therefore, we set the
maximum effective (communication) distance for this case
as 10 m. The second solution corresponds to the use of the
original CAM system. According to Figure 5(b) of [10], the
maximum communication distance for such a system is 30 m.
The third solution considers our Proxy CAM system, wherein
the maximum distance depends on the situation. In the absence
of buildings and other obstacles, CAMs can travel over 800
m([15]). However, the effective braking distance is constrained
by the presence of buildings and other large vehicles such as
trucks or buses. Thus, we set the maximum distance to 50
m for the Proxy CAM case. The ﬁnal solution considers the
efﬁcacy of our proposed method. This method uses both a
cellular network and LTE. Thus, in theory, the system can work
anywhere on the road (except in long tunnels). Therefore, its
maximum communication distance can be considered as ∞m.
Each of the abovementioned effective distances determines
the safety margins of the intersection with obstacles nearby.
Thus, the safety regions can be classiﬁed into the four regions
shown in Figure 8. Human eyes and computer vision are the
poorest solutions; their use can prevent an accident if the vehi-
cle’s position and speed lie in the orange region. The original
CAM system can prevent an accident if the vehicle’s position
and speed lie in the orange and yellow regions. Meanwhile,
the Proxy CAM system can prevent collision if the vehicle’s
position and speed lie in the orange, yellow, and blue regions.
The green region is still unsafe for all three solutions. However,
the proposed method can still prevent accidents corresponding
to the green region because our system can communicate
regardless of the distance. Therefore, our proposed method is
highly effective over existing technologies.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We proposed a system called the Remote Proxy CAM that
uses a cellular network with UDP/IPv6 + LTE in addition to
the original Proxy CAM system protocol stack, BTP/GN +
IEEE802.11p, in order to widen the coverage of the CAM
transmission and improve failure tolerance. To evaluate this
system, we implemented the cellular-network component of
the system and performed various experiments. In the experi-
ments, the transmitter sent packets to the receiver with various
frequencies over different transmitter-receiver distances. Our
results indicated that using the cellular network with UDP/IPv6
+ LTE afforded a high PDR (nearly 100%) and low average
delay of about 30 ms, which indicate that the proposed method
is stable and operates in real-time. This method allows CITS
vehicles to stably and consistently receive CAMs of faraway
vehicles in real-time.
We are planning to focus on three aspects of the system in
our future works. Currently, we have assumed that the vehicle
knows the position and IP address of the Proxy CAM device;
however, our system needs to have a discovery mechanism
for discovering the proxy CAM device. Further, we need to
examine possible solutions for device discovery, such as IP-
address-embedded digital map, download-based solution, or
a DNS-like system, as mentioned in section IV-A. Second,
we require a system that compares the created time of CAMs
across both IEEE802.11p and LTE and then updates LDM
with the newest times. Finally, we performed our experiments
with one receiver while actual situations would require more
receivers. Thus, the proposed method should be tested with
multiple receivers and the signal delay must be investigated.
