Abstract—In rainfed agriculture, where crop extensions are 
high, yields are low and profit margins are tight, expensive 
solutions for crop monitoring are ineffective. Therefore, 
achieving an effective, fast, low time consuming, and cheap Crop 
Coverage or Canopy Cover estimation is important, as it is an 
indicator of the crop vigor or any issue taking place during the 
plant growth. Moreover, it is also an interesting way to estimate 
and evaluate the soil covered by vegetation in degraded rural 
areas and assess problems with soil erosion due to the lack of 
vegetation. The use of Remote Sensing Technologies as satellite 
MultiSpectral images offers numerous advantages, as it is a 
powerful tool. However, lacks the speed of an Unmanned Aerial 
Vehicle or drone when gathering images, as it depends on the 
satellite acquisition calendar. On the other hand, gathering 
images with conventional cameras is not possible on large farms 
and plots or hard-to-reach areas. The use of a commercial 
non-professional drone to gather conventional images of a crop 
is a useful tool to estimate the canopy cover of the crop in 
different growth stages. This estimation allows detecting 
problems during the seeding phase or detecting areas where the 
crop is not growing, along with measuring the percentage of 
covered soil by the plant.  As showed in this paper, we have 
managed to estimate the canopy coverage of camelina in an 
experimental plot seeded in two different dates, and assess the 
crop performance in a reliable way. The average canopy cover 
for the late seeded plot was 15.55 %, while the in the early 
seeded plot was 76.09 %. 
Keywords—camelina; remote sensing; canopy cover, soil 
erosion. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Soil erosion is one of the most important factors in land 
degradation and one of the principal mechanisms of 
desertification at national and regional levels [1][2]. Due to its 
geographical location and climate, Spain is one of the 
country’s most severely affected by soil erosion in the 
European Mediterranean region [3]. The main effects caused 
by erosion are the loss of agricultural and forest soil fertility, 
increased degradation of vegetation cover, and a decrease in 
natural hydrologic control. All these interrelated processes are 
linked to the threat of desertification and global climate 
change [4].  
In rural areas, poor soil use has negative effects such as 
loss of fertility, degradation, and desertification. Therefore, it 
is a natural resource suffering from gradual deterioration; and 
generates a negative impact on the environment. For this 
reason, recovery processes of the vegetation and soil cover 
must be carried out, along with control and mitigation 
measures of erosion. In addition, it is recommended to 
implement natural mechanisms that do not generate new 
environmental impacts. Thus, the use of natural materials or 
vegetal covers is proposed as a natural remediation [5]. 
The establishment of vegetal covers is an excellent 
alternative to prevent erosive processes, since it increases the 
hydraulic resistance of the land by increasing the stability of 
the soil aggregates. The soil acquires protection against the 
impact of raindrops by increasing its infiltration capacity and 
stopping runoff. Native plants are the best guarantee of a 
healthy ecosystem, since they are adapted to the 
characteristics of the field [6]. 
Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz [camelina] has emerged in 
recent years as an alternative oilseed and cover crop from the 
Brassicaceae family. Camelina seed meal and oil can be used 
for both animal feed and human food, but also has many 
industrial applications [7]. With a short life cycle, camelina 
can be an ideal rotational crop as it has two distinctive 
biotypes, spring, and winter. Winter biotypes require a 
vernalization treatment to enter the reproductive phase, while 
spring biotypes do not [8][9]. Increased interest in broadening 
the diversity of winter-hardy cover crops to reduce soil 
erosion through the winter months has led this crop to become 
an excellent choice [8][10]–[12]. 
As an example, camelina cultivation in the central area of 
Spain (Comunidad de Madrid, Castilla-La Mancha and 
Castilla y León) has increased in the past years due to the 
effort of private and public actors such as Camelina Company 
Spain [CCE] and Madrid Institute for Rural, Agricultural and 
Food Research and Development [IMIDRA] [13]–[17]. 
Therefore, camelina is considered as a growing crop in Spain, 
leading a special interest in crop diversification. It is a 
practical and economically viable alternative, supported by its 
short growth period. At present, institutions promote the 
production of non-food biomass to contribute to the 
worldwide change of energy policies. This requires fast-
growing species to produce energy or raw materials to 
produce other combustibles. Two areas of emerging interest 
from the agricultural sector have converge in recent years: 1) 
the convenience to promote new systems of agrarian 
production that result in sustainable rural development in 
Spain, and 2) the need to substitute the demand of fossil 
energy with renewable energies, based on the benefit of the 
environment [18]. 
Within the CAMEVAR project, we are assessing several 
varieties of camelina provided by CCE, together with

cultivation techniques and practices in combination with new 
technologies. In this paper, we analyze the use of Red, Green 
and Blue [RGB] images gathered with a Parrot Bebop 2 UAV 
[Unmanned Aerial Vehicle] to estimate the Crop Coverage or 
Canopy Cover [CC] of camelina. We will determine the 
percentage of soil and vegetation through a combination of the 
images bands to assess the evolution of the crop, seeded in two 
different dates. 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section II 
outlines related works; Section III describe the materials and 
methods; Section IV analyzes the results and highlights the 
importance of assessing the evolution and coverage of certain 
crop; finally, conclusions and future work are summarized in 
Section V. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
In this section, we summarize some of the related works 
to estimate crop coverage through remote sensing, either with 
RGB images or MultiSpectral [MS] sensors. 
Alatorre et al. [19] analyzed the temporal evolution of 
plant activity on vegetated areas and in erosion risk zones in a 
small area of the central Pyrenees during the period 
1984-2007 from two Landsat Normalized Difference 
Vegetation Index [NDVI] time series for the months of March 
and August through MS sensors. This allowed the analysis of 
the spatial and temporal dynamics of plant activity in areas 
with good plant cover (forests and dense scrub) and in 
degraded areas affected by erosion processes (gullies and 
erosion risk areas). Through a multivariate regression, NDVI 
trends were analyzed considering climatic factors. The spatial 
resolution of the Landsat image allowed a good representation 
of the selected covers. The study showed that in the Pyrenees 
there has been an increase in plant activity in the last 24 years 
due to the increase in temperature. However, the extreme 
conditions that exist in this area with active erosion and areas 
at risk of erosion did not allowed the recovery of the 
vegetation among the study period. The issue about MS 
sensors is that they are more sensitive and expensive 
compared to RGB sensors. 
Basterrechea et al. [20] proposed a system to evaluate the 
changes in grass coverage between covered plots and non-
covered plots, between summer and winter. They aimed to 
obtain an economical device for farmers to consult the status 
of grass coverage in crops and to improve the quality and 
quantity of harvested fruits. The study used the Sentinel-2 
satellite platform to gather images in the different bands of 
RGB, Near InfraRed [NIR], Water Vapor Permeability 
[WVP], and NDVI index for different times of the year to 
evaluate changes between plots with coverage and plots 
without grass coverage. 
Regarding the use of RGB images, an alternative to obtain 
high-resolution spatial and temporal images is the 
implementation of UAVs equipped with digital cameras. In 
images with high spatial resolution, it is necessary to know the 
vegetation index that best identifies the pixels that contain 
vegetation and those that do not, as well as the threshold value 
that allows separating both classes. Marcial Pablo et al. [21], 
used the Otsu-Valley algorithm to estimate the plant cover of 
the corn crop combined with the Excessive Greenness index 
[ExG]. This algorithm establishes that the optimal threshold 
to separate the image into differentiated classes resides in the 
value of the spectral histogram located between its two 
maximum peaks. As it calculates the most appropriate 
threshold during the intermediate stage of crop growth, with 
accuracies greater than 94 %. Therefore, they accomplished a 
high precision in the estimation of vegetation cover using the 
ExG index and the Otsu algorithm in early stages of crop 
growth. 
As Asahpure et al. recall [22], RGB-based CC estimation 
methods can be divided into two categories: 1) thresholding 
method that requires the specification of the color thresholds 
or the ratios to identify canopy pixels; and 2) pixel 
classification methods that use a supervised or unsupervised 
pixel-wise classification method to identify canopy pixels. 
Though pixel classification methods are highly accurate, they 
are time consuming and computationally extensive. 
Supervised classification methods require training samples to 
be collected, which is expensive and prone to human error. 
However, pixel classification methods are particularly useful 
to calibrate thresholding methods [23].  
There is a large amount of work in the literature that uses 
RGB sensors to compute CC. Early work in this direction 
includes the quantification of turfgrass cover using digital 
image analysis by Richardson et al. [24], where digital image 
analysis proved to be an effective method to determine 
turfgrass cover, producing both accurate and reproducible 
data. Lee and Lee [25], estimated canopy cover over the rice 
field using an RGB sensor which is a nondestructive, low-
cost, and convenient method for estimating CC using digital 
camera image analysis. CC was estimated by the ratio of plant 
pixels to total pixels with an image analysis program 
developed in Visual Basic to extract RGB features from the 
mosaic images. Then they calculated the RGB-based color 
index and compute the minimum segmentation error for 
separating rice plant from background. 
Finally, Marín et al. [26] showed the accessibility, easy use 
and low cost of digital RGB cameras as a perfect device for 
turfgrass green biomass estimation and water management, 
especially under limited growing conditions. 
As we have showed, the use of RGB images is common in 
CC estimation of diverse crops, but there is no evaluation of 
these methods in camelina; as most of the studies are based on 
MS index to evaluate other crops performance or yield 
[27][28]. The use of UAVs for proximal remote sensing on a 
crop as camelina offers better results than satellite remote 
sensing, ground taken images or Unmanned Terrestrial 
Vehicles [UTVs]. Therefore, using UAV imaging produces a 
detailed CC map of the field in timely and inexpensive 
manner. Moreover, the crop growth can also be monitored by 
using UAVs and generate on-go vegetation index to assess the 
crop health and determine if it is necessary to apply fertilizers 
or herbicides [29]. 
III. 
MATERIAL AND METHODS 
In this section, we will detail the procedure followed to 
gather and process the data from the field, as well as the 
software and hardware employed to obtain and analyze the 
results.

A. Crop seeding 
Within the framework of CAMEVAR project, IMIDRA 
collaborates with CCE in assessing several camelina varieties 
and how they adapt to the central area of Spain. To perform 
this essay, we seeded four replicas of a winter camelina 
variety (V11) in two different dates (December 2nd, 2020 and 
February 18th, 2021) in “Finca El Encín”, Alcalá de Henares, 
Madrid (Spain) facilities. The soil at this location is a typical 
Fluvisol (Calcaric), according to the World Reference Base 
for Soil Resources 2014 [30]. These soils are developed in 
fluvial deposits as river plains, valleys, lake depressions and 
tidal marshes on all continents and in all climate zones. They 
lack of groundwater or high salt contents in the topsoil. In 
addition, many Fluvisols under natural conditions are flooded 
periodically. Also, these soils profiles have evidence of 
stratification and a weak horizon differentiation, but a distinct 
topsoil horizon may be present. 
We used two seeding techniques and applied two 
concentrations of Urine derived Fertilizer [UdF] (low-60 and 
high-90). Therefore, each plot had a combination of two 
different seeding methods: 1) broadcast, without burying the 
seed and 2) in rows, burying the seed. Each individual plot 
was 1m wide and 15m long. For this purpose, we used a 
Wintersteiger self-propelled TC plot seeder. The seeding dose 
was 8 kg/ha and the plot had no irrigation, as it is a rainfed 
crop. The distribution of the individual plots was as follow: 
(A) 1st seeding date – broadcast – 60UdF; (B) 1st seeding date 
– broadcast – 90UdF; (C) 1st seeding date – rows – 60UdF; 
(D) 1st seeding date – rows – 90UdF; and (E) 2nd seeding date 
– broadcast – 60UdF; (F) 2nd seeding date – broadcast – 
90UdF; (G) 2nd seeding date – rows – 60UdF; (H) 2nd seeding 
date – rows – 90UdF (H) (Figure 1).   
B. UAV specifications and image gathering 
Images to estimate the camelina CC where taken on April 
19th, 2021 at X475093 Y4486168 ETRS89-30N. We used a 
Bebop 2 UAV with a 24-bit color RGB camera and a 
resolution of 1440x1080 pixels to take zenithal pictures of the 
camelina canopy at 15 m height. This UAV has an autonomy 
of 25 min, enough to capture the study area or even larger 
surfaces. 
C. Image processing 
We selected QGIS 3.16.4-Hannover [31] to process the 
images, as it is a free and open software, to simplify the CC 
calculation. First, images where cropped to treat each image 
individually (P1 to P8) (Figure 1). And they were later 
included in QGIS. 
A RGB image is composed of three bands. The linear 
combination of these bands produces the picture that the 
naked eye sees. Nonetheless, when these bands are combined 
in a different way, several indexes appear. As we wanted to 
estimate the CC, we choose to differentiate soil form 
vegetation. We also supposed that all the crop present in the 
picture was camelina, as the presence of weeds was low. Later 
we processed the images according to a soil index Eq. (1) [32].

P1 to P8 are enumerated according to the flight order of the UAV 
(clockwise). 
This index is based on the fact that the soil has higher 
values of brightness in the red band [R] than in the green band 
[G]. Therefore, it divides the green band by the red band 
obtaining a new image, which gives information about the 
soil/plant coverage. Following, each image was reclassified 
with a determinate threshold to differentiate soil from 
vegetation. Pixels between 0 and 1 where reclassified as 0 and 
considered soil (black pixels); pixels over 1 where classified 
as 1 and considered vegetation (white pixels) (Figure 2 and 
Figure 3). Once the images were reclassified, we used the 
QGIS tool “zonal statistics” to calculate the numbers of pixels 
with 0 and 1 value. Finally, we estimated the proportion of CC 
in each plot from this numbers, expressed as a percentage of 
soil covered by the camelina canopy (Table I).  
IV. 
RESULTS 
In this section, we will analyze the obtained data. We will 
compare the CC of the same camelina variety, seeded in two 
different dates and with differential fertilization rates. 
A. Canopy cover 
We have considered the camelina CC in two different 
growth stages of the crop. One, almost fully developed with 
flower and fruits appearing (1st seeding date – P5 to P8) and 
40 cm to 50 cm height (600 BBCH scale [33]), and another as 
a rosette with the plant at ground level (2nd seeding date – P1 
to P4). The differences in the CC are remarkable and as 
expected. Camelina phenological stages are different so the 
percentage of soil covered is higher as the plant is bigger 
(TABLE I). The average CC for P1 to P4 plots is 15.55%, 
while the average CC for P5 to P8 plots is 76.09%. 
In addition to the CC ratio, there are other interesting 
parameters that can be assessed with the RGB processed 
images: the correctness of the seeding procedure or the effects 
of the different crop management procedures employed, as 
long as if there are differences in the applied fertilization dose. 
We must emphasize that this paper we are presenting is a 
work in progress, as the crop is still growing, and we keep 
gathering data. 
Nevertheless, we have detected some issues with the 
Wintersteiger plot seeder: the middle of the seeding route has

less density than the edges. This is a phenomenon that happens 
in all the plots (P1 to P8) (Figure 2 and Figure 3). Because of 
this, the central area CC is lower, as is the density of plants 
too. Even though the dose of seeds was the same, the 
blooming of the plant was not.

If we analyze P5 to P8, as they were seeded first, we 
appreciate some differences in the seeding procedure: P5-C.1 
and P8-D.1-D.2-C.3-D.4 replicas were seeded using the rows 
procedure (the seed is slightly buried in the ground) and they 
have a higher CC (Figure 3). The visible density of white 
pixels is higher in those bands. When compared to P1 to P4 
plots, the rows seeding procedure seems to behave better, as 
there is a higher density of white pixels in those bands too, 
e.g., P2-G.1-H.2-H.3 and P4-G.2-H.4.

Regarding the use of two fertilizer doses, results are not 
conclusive yet. As we have to harvest the crop and calculate 
the seed yield per hectare and plant weight (biomass). 
However, the CC results are quite promising. When 
comparing P8-D.1 to P5-C.1 (same seeding date and 
procedure, but different UdF doses), P8-D.1 (90UdF) seems 
to have a more consistent CC of camelina. The remaining 
bands do not seem to show remarkable differences when 
compared by the fertilizer dose. Still, we expect to appreciate 
these differences in further UAV flights, when the crop is in a 
later phenological stage. 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Through this paper, we have presented an easy, cheap, and 
effective way to assess the canopy coverage of camelina 
crops. This is relevant as it allows the farmer or investigator 
to assess the growing of the crop and determine if there has 
been any issue during the seeding procedure. Even though, 
once the essay or crop are seeded, if there is any problem it 
would be difficult to solve. So by flying the UAV as a check 
procedure, this could be issued in further campaigns to avoid 
echoing the previous mistakes. Capturing images with this 
kind of UAVs and RGB cameras is very cheap, as well as the 
post processing of the images. In addition, the information

gathered could be a potential game changer in the 
management of large rainfed crops areas, where the benefits 
of the crop are tight. 
As this paper is a current work, we aim to compare the 
gathered data with results from seed yield and plant 
development, and with thermal images in larger plot areas. 
Therefore, we could aim to assess detecting diseases in large 
crop areas, or not growing spots that could reduce the final 
yield of the crop.
