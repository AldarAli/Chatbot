Abstract—This
paper
introduces
an
extension
of
a
methodology for calculating the throughput in a cognitive radio
network using the slotted aloha technique for medium access.
This extension includes two new aspects: imperfect sensing and
different transmission power levels in the secondary stations. The
performance of the network is evaluated and numerical results
are compared with the results for the original model. The new
aspects considered in this paper make the model more realistic.

INTRODUCTION
During the last decades, emerging applications in wireless
communication
networks
gained
attention
due
to
the
increasing demand of high transmission rates services [1].
According to [1] and [2], the majority of the available
spectrum frequencies has already been fixed and licensed to
primary user’s (PU’s). A study undertaken by Spectrum Policy
Task
Force
(STPF),
linked to Federal
Communications
Commission (FCC), of United States of America (USA), has
shown that in certain locations and during certain periods of
time, some spectrum bands are widely used by PU’s.
However, in some other locations, there are many frequency
bands that are partially occupied or not used at all [1].
According to the FCC, the usage of licensed spectrum bands
varies between 15% and 85%. A way to overcome these
limitations is to promote changes in the current licensing
model, by allowing secondary users (SUs) to access the
available spectrum, without causing harmful interference in
the PU’s communications. The efficiency in the usage of the
radio spectrum would be improved in order to support the
required demands [2]. Cognitive Radio (CR) is a technology
that can be used to implement this approach.
CR is defined as a radio that can change its transmission
parameters based on the environment in which it is operating.
The main functions of cognitive radio include spectral
detection,
spectrum
management,
spectral
mobility
and
spectrum sharing [2]. Its paramount objective is to provide
adaptability
to
wireless
transmission
systems
through
Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) in order to optimize the
performance and improve the use of the spectrum [1].
The components of a Cognitive Radio Network (CRN)
Architecture can be classified in two groups: primary and
secondary networks.
The
first
is
the
licensed
network
infrastructure, which is entitled to exploit a certain band of the
frequency spectrum. The secondary network is not licensed to
operate in that band and their radio stations access the
spectrum done in an opportunistic manner, exploring the
unused bands by PU’s, defined as a spectral holes.
Medium Access Control (MAC) is a key issue in CRN. In
the primary network, the MAC protocols are important in
order to organize the access to the channel of different PUs. In
the
secondary
network,
the
MAC
protocols
have
the
responsibility to organize the access of SUs to the free
channels of the primary network and prevent the licensed
network from harmful interference. Several papers have
analyzed the performance of MAC protocols in a CRN
environment. Li et al. [3] analyzed the impact of imperfect
sensing in a distributed multi-channel cognitive radio system.
Moshksar et al. [4] analyzed the effect of power levels by SUs
for achieving high rate per SU.
Bayrakdar et al. [5]
investigated the throughput of a slotted aloha-based random
access CRN with capture effect in Rayleigh fading channels.
In [6], the performance of the slotted aloha protocol, in both
networks
(primary
and
secondary),
is
also
analyzed
considering the capture effect and Rayleigh channels. The
analyses presented in [5] and [6], however, do not consider the
Packet Error Rate (PER) when two or more stations transmit
simultaneously. This lack in the performance analysis has been
solved by the extension published in [7]. However, the
analyses presented in [6] and [7] do not consider two
important
aspects:
imperfect
sensing
and
different
transmission power levels in SUs. The main goal of this paper
is to extend the analysis presented in [6] and [7], considering
these effects in the mathematical formulation.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in Section II,
we present the model used in [6], and the extension presented
in [7], called original model; the new model is proposed in
Section III; numerical results and discussions are presented in
Section IV; and conclusions are given in Section V.
II.
SYSTEM MODEL
The analyzed architecture, which is illustrated in Figure 1,
considers two networks (primary and secondary) that coexist
in the same geographic region and frequency band. The
secondary network contains a SAP and Ns users who compete
for spectrum opportunities. The primary network has a
primary access point (PAP) and Np PU’s. According to [6] and
[7], during a time slot, there are Ip PU’s and Js SUs attempting
to transmit their data packets to their respective access points.
During a time slot, each PU or SU, which is not in the packet
transmission state can generate a new packet with probability
ߪ௣ orߪ௦ respectively. Thus, the probability of no new PU or
SU packet generation is (1 −ߪ௣) or (1 −ߪ௦), respectively. If a
PU or an SU generates a data packet on its network, the packet
is transmitted in the next time slot. If an error occurs during
the transmission of the packet, it is then retransmitted with

probabilityߪ௣ orߪ௦ in the following time slot, until the packet
is received successfully. If a PU or SU is in the retransmission
state, no new packet can be generated.

protocol
A. Fading Model for Primary and Secondary Network
In this paper, following [6] and [7], a quasi-static fading
model is used, according to the Rayleigh statistical model,
wherein the instantaneous power of the received signal has an
exponential distribution, see (6).
B. Power Level Applied in the Network
Let ܺ௣ and ܺ௦ be the mean values of instantaneous power
of
the
concerned
packet
from
primary
and
secondary
networks, respectively. Let ܻ and ܼ be the mean values of the
interfering powers of one packet from primary and secondary
network, respectively. In [6] and [7], we have ܺ௣= ܻ and ܺ௦=
ܼ. Keeping in mind that the SUs work with lower levels of
transmission power, to minimize interference in the PUs, we
define the following ratio:

γ =

C. Analysis of the Capture Effect
In slotted aloha systems, packets that arrive at the receiver
have different power levels due to the distance between the
transceivers,
the
transmission
power
level,
the
channel
shadowing and the signal fading. If the difference between the
power levels of a concerned packet in relation to other
interfering packets is higher than a threshold, called capture
ratio (R), then the concerned packet can be detected by the
receiver [8].
In [6] and [7], the authors consider a capture model where
the interfering power is the sum of all received interfering
powers from SUs and PU’s. If the power of the concerned
packet is higher than the interfering power and it satisfies the
capture ratio R, then the receiver captures the concerned
packet. The analysis presented in [6] considers that the
captured packet can be detected by the PAP or SAP without
errors and the analysis presented in [7] considers the effects of
the PER. Assuming that the concerned packet is coming from
a PU, then the capture probability (P୮ୡୟ୮→୔୅୔) can be
calculated by [6]:

D. Packet Error Rate Analysis
The knowledge of the PER in communication systems is
important, since most systems have data transmitted in packets
[7]. Furthermore, the performance of the system is determined
by PER instead of the Bit Error Rate (BER) or Symbol Error
Rate (SER) [7][9]. The relation between PER and the system
model is made by the Signal-to-Interference plus Noise Ratio
(SNIR). According to [10], the Gaussian noise can be
neglected in channels limited by the interference. Thus, in this
paper, we consider the Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR).
In this article, following [7], the PER is calculated for a
fading channel as a function of SIR, through the use of a fairly
accurate upper bound for the considered system [9]. Knowing
that  ܺ௣= ܻ and  ܺ௦= ܼ and applying (1), we obtain the mean
value of SIR for the primary networks (∆p) and secondary
networks (∆s ), given by:

Let ݂(ߜ) be a function that relates the PER with the

density function of Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) in the
receiver, considering a Rayleigh channel, which has an

Applying (12) in (11) and then (11) in (10), we can
compute (using Mathcad software) w0. Considering n=127 bits
per packet, the same value used in [7], we obtain w0=3,4467.
Faria et al. [7] consider that a packet received with error is
discarded and will be retransmitted, following the MAC
protocol, until it is successfully received.
E. Calculating the Total Throughput of the Original Model
The total throughput (ܵ௢௧) is defined as the total number of
packets generated by PUs and SUs that are correctly received
by the PAP and SAP, respectively, during a time slot. The
primary throughput (ܵ௢௣), secondary throughput (ܵ௢௦) and
total throughput Sot, are given as [7]:

THE NEW MODEL
The expressions to compute the throughput presented in
[7]
do
not
consider
imperfect
sensing
and
different
transmission power levels in the SUs. In this section, an
extension of such model is presented taking into account these
aspects, making the model more accurate.
We consider that there is an entity in the secondary
network responsible for sensing and making decisions about
the channel status. Depending on the decision made in a given
time slotted, the SUs adapt their transmission power level in
order to minimize the interference on the primary network.
A. Channel Sensing
The spectral sensing is one of the most critical parts of the
CRN. We consider that a secondary user initially performs
channel sensing, which can be modeled as a hypothesis testing
problem. Various channel sensing methods, including energy
detection, cycle stationary detection, and matched filtering,
have been proposed and analyzed in the literature [11]-[14].
Regardless of which method is used, one common feature is
that errors, in the form of missed detections and false-alarms,
can occur.
We assumed that H0 denotes the hypothesis that the
primary users are inactive in the channel, and H1 denotes the
hypothesis that the primary users are active. Thus,ܪ෡଴ denotes
the decision that the PU is absent in the channel and
ܪ෡ଵ denotes the decision that the PU is active in the channel.
With the result of the decision and the true nature of the
activity of the PU, we have four possible cases that are
described below [12][13].

B. Power Level Applied in the Network
We considered that ܺ௦௞
is the mean value of the
instantaneous power of the concerned packet from the
secondary network and ܼ௞ is the mean value of the interfering
power from one SU, where ܺ௦௞ = ܼ௞ .
In our notation, ݇ denotes the decision about the state of
the channel, where ݇ = 0 represents that the decision is
channel free and ݇ = 1 that the decision is channel busy.
The transmission power of the SU when ݇ = 0 is greater
than when ݇ = 1, with the goal to reduce interference in the
primary network. Now, the ratio between the power of a
packet from the primary network and the power of one from
the secondary network depends on the decision about the
channel state and is given by:
.

C. Capture Effect for the New System
To compute the capture probability we consider that all
SUs have the same decision about the state of the channel (free
or busy). This approach is equivalent to considering that the
decision process in the secondary network is centralized.
For the capture effect, if the concerned packet is generated
by a PU, the probability of capturing this packet is given by
(2), modified to consider that we have two different power
levels in the secondary network:

Now we consider the value of γk depending on the channel
status decision. In this context, the decision can result in four
values, as described below:
•
Pd, if the channel is busy and the decision is busy, we
have: k=1 and γk= γ1;
•
Ped, if the channel is busy and the decision is free, we
have: k=0 and γk= γ0;
•
Pf, if the channel is free and the decision is busy, we
have: k=1 and γk= γ1;
•
Pnf, if the channel is free and the decision is free, we
have: k=0 and γk= γ0.
Thus, γ1 represents the ratio (see (20)) when the decision
about the channel is busy and γ0 represents the ratio when the
decision about the state of the channel is idle.
Now, we have the capture probability in the primary
network, considering that PU is always active and the result of
the decision can be right (Pd) or wrong (Ped), as given below:

For the secondary network, we have the capture probability as
given below:
D. Packet Error Rate
To compute the PER, we use the same approach as in
Section II. However, now the SIR depends on the transmission
power levels, which depends on the channel state decision.
Thus, we have:

Total Throughput of the New Model
The total throughput of the network in the new model is
defined as the total number of packets generated by PUs and
SUs that are correctly received by the PAP and SAP,
respectively, during a time slot.
Considering only correctly received packets, the primary
network throughput, represented by (ܵ௡௣), the secondary
network throughput, represented by (ܵ௡௦), and the total
throughput of the network, represented, by (ܵ௡௧), are given,
respectively, by (33), (34) and (35).

Based on (33) and (34) we can observe that the false alarm
probability does not interfere with the throughput of the
network.

The curves presented in Figures 2, 3 and 4, show the
throughput for the primary network, secondary network and
total throughput. They are plotted considering: the original
model introduced in [7] and the new model proposed here. We
take into account imperfect sensing and different transmission
power levels regarding the channel’s state decision. To
compare the numerical results between the new model
proposed and the original model, we considered the same
parameters used in [7] i.e., Np= Ns=30, R=3dB,ߛ=10, and
m alternating between 1, 2 and 5. For the new model, we
set ܲௗ = 0.8 ,ߛ଴=5, andߛଵ = 10. Observing Figures 2, 3
and 4, for the Pd value assumed in this paper, we can conclude
that:
•
The throughput in the primary network decreases
when we consider the effects of the imperfect
sensing.
•
Regarding the secondary network, the throughput is
not influenced by the imperfect sensing.
As future work, it is important to investigate the influence
of the parameters Pd,ߛ௢,ߛଵ, Np, and Ns when imperfect
sensing is considered.
Additionally, as future work, one can investigate the
influence of channel coding techniques as a solution to
increase the throughput of cognitive networks.
Also, as a future study, one can investigate adaptive
modulation
schemes
and
channel
coding
techniques
as
solutions to increase the throughput in the networks.

CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we extended the analysis presented in [7],
considering the effect of imperfect sensing in the throughput
of a cognitive radio network that employs slotted aloha
multiple access protocol in the primary and secondary
networks. Also, we consider different transmission power
levels in the secondary network as a function of the decision in
this network about the state of the channel.
We
observed
that
imperfect
sensing
and
different
transmission power levels reduce the throughput in primary
network and have no influence in the secondary network.
