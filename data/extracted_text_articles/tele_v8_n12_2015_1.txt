Abstract— To increase the flexibility of the aircraft 
equipments and to reduce the possession and operating costs 
of the aircrafts, the main aircraft manufacturers want to 
change fluidic systems by electrical systems. However, this 
evolution induces a high increase of the number of wires. 
Reducing the amount of wiring also allows decreasing the 
construction and the maintenance costs, and the polluting 
emissions. Another interest is improving the reliability of 
aircraft equipment such as allowing monitoring of power 
cables. To limit the number wires, we proposed to use power 
line communication (PLC) for flight control systems (FCS) 
on the high voltage direct current network (HVDC), between 
a calculator unit and a power inverter for medium-haul 
aircrafts. PLC technology has proven its reliability for 
indoor network with the Homeplug Av standard. Nowadays, 
many studies deal with the possibility to use PLC for 
embedded systems. However, PLC for safety-critical avionic 
systems are not often studied. This paper attempts to define 
the physical layer for such application. The proposed 
transmission technique used is orthogonal frequency division 
multiplexing (OFDM), which is widely used with success in 
many telecommunication systems. In this paper, we present 
throughput measurement with Homeplug Av modems to 
prove the feasibility of PLC in aircraft environment. 
However, the Homeplug Av parameters are not adapted to 
the aeronautic constraints. Based on channel transfer 
function measurements and analysis, we proposed to adapt 
the OFDM parameters to comply with the FCS real-time 
constraints.

 INTRODUCTION  
1In future aircrafts, hydraulic flight control systems 
(FCS) will be replaced by electric ones. The main 
interests are a better flexibility and a decrease in 
maintenance costs. However, the major problem is the 
increasing of wires length. Since the actuators for the FCS 
are electrical actuators, it is possible to change the 
medium to improve the speed of the transmissions, the 
reliability or to decrease the complexity of the electrical 
network. To reduce the electrical network complexity and 
propose a reliable transmission in the medium-haul 
aircrafts, PLC technology seems to be a good candidate. 
 
 
Reducing the mass of wiring also has the benefit of 
reducing not only the maintenance and the construction 
costs, but also the polluting emissions. In addition, the 
PLC technology could improve the reliability of the 
aircraft equipment through the monitoring of the power 
wires. In previous work [1], we proposed to define OFDM 
parameters for such kind of transmission in order to 
comply with the real-time constraints. It is also possible to 
use optical fibers for the FCS, which is called fly-by-light 
[2]. They allow high data rates and fast transmissions. 
However, it does not solve the problems of the network 
complexity, and aircraft manufacturers remain reluctant to 
use them for avionics critical systems due to the 
maintenance constraints. Another possibility is to use 
wireless communication which is called fly-by-wireless 
[3]. The main advantage of this technology is that it 
removes the wired medium. However, this technology is 
vulnerable from the electromagnetic point of view, in 
terms of safety and reliability. 
PLC technology has proven its reliability in in-home 
network with HomePlug Av [4]. This standard allows to 
transmit data with a bit rate of about 200 Mbit/s in the 
[1;30] MHz bandwidth. In addition, there are numerous 
studies concerning PLC in different kinds of vehicles like 
cars [5][6][7][8], ships [10][11], and trains [12][13]. PLC 
technology is also investigated in aircraft cabin lighting 
system for multimedia application in the European project 
TAUPE [14][15]. However, even if the cabin lighting 
system network is representative of one part of the aircraft 
electrical network, it is not appropriate for safety-critical 
systems like FCS. A first study, which proposed to use 
PLC for a critical system, has been done in [16]. The 
authors studied the feasibility of using PLC technology 
between the power inverter and the actuator for landing 
gears. In this case, the wire length between the power 
inverter and the actuator is about five meters and the 
network is a non-filtered low voltage AC network. 
Nevertheless, in this paper, we focus on a new high 
voltage direct current (HVDC) network, which is longer 
(until thirty two meters long) and filtered.The HVDC 
network is a new ± 270 VDC power supply network, 
which will replace the AC 115 V, 400 Hz network.

Figure 1. PLC system on aircraft wing 
The interest for the aircraft manufacturers to use a 
HVDC network is to allow the simplification of the power 
networks (alternators, power conversion, circuit breakers, 
etc.). It becomes possible to use the reversibility of the 
electrical actuators for the FCS to produce electrical 
power. As the HVDC network is still in design, we can 
influence the design of the power network in order to 
improve the quality of the propagation channel for the 
proposed PLC transmissions. 
FCS do not require a high bit rate link, few Mbit/s 
being enough. Nevertheless, the communication must be 
highly reliable, deterministic, real time and must comply 
with theDO-160 [17]. The DO-160 specifies test 
conditions for the design of avionics electronic hardware 
in airborne systems. As shown in Fig. 1, we consider the 
link between the calculator unit and the power inverter 
located near the actuators used for flight control. In this 
illustration, the PLC master near the calculator unit 
transmits data to the PLC slave near the power inverter. It 
corresponds to a point-to-point topology. It is also 
possible to use point-to-multipoint topology, where one 
PLC node transmits data to two PLC nodes. Moreover, 
one of the major challenges of the command of the FCS is 
the real time constraints. The FCS operates at frequency 
about 1 kHz, which is called the fast control loop. 
According to the common practice for the aeronautic 
equipment, command systems must work six times faster 
than the equipment that they command. It represents a 
6 kHz frequency system or a 167 µs period in this 
scheme. However, there are several calculators in this fast 
control loop, which require time processing. It seems 
reasonable to consider that the PLC system time 
processing of the must not exceed from 10 % to 20 % of 
the 167 µs period. In our case, it varies from 17 µs to 
34 µs. 
The proposed PLC data transmissions are based on the 
OFDM technique [18], which has been used with success 
in many wireless and wired line communication systems 
like DVB, indoor PLC standards or 3GPP-LTE. This 
technology is interesting for the PLC transmission 
because it is flexible and robust in frequency selective 
channels. 
In this paper, we measure and analyze the propagation 
channel in order to define an OFDM symbol duration in 
compliance with the real-time constraints. Bit rate 
measurements are also performed to prove the feasibility 
of the PLC on the HVDC network for the FCS. 
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we 
describe the channel and the test bench, while results on 
the insertion gain are presented in Section III. Section IV 
describes the channel analysis and the optimization of the 
OFDM parameters is presented in Section V. In Section 
VI, simulations are performed in order to check the 
parameters proposed in the previous section. The bit rate 
measurements of the PLC link are given in Section VII. A 
synthesis of the main results and a conclusion are given in 
Section VIII. 
II. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE TEST BENCH AND OF THE 
MEASUREMENT CONFIGURATION 
In the test bench, the channel is composed of a harness 
and two couplers that allow to connect the communication 
system over the HVDC network. Two kinds of couplers 
are used: capacitive couplers or inductive couplers.  
A. Harnesses Configuration 
During the measurement campaign, three architectures 
were studied: 
- the point-to-point architecture, with two capacitive 
couplers: architecture 1 (Fig. 2), 
- the point-to-point architecture, with two inductive 
couplers: architecture 2 (Fig. 3), 
- the point-to-multipoint architecture with one master 
and two slaves, architecture 3 (Fig. 4). 
The tests have been performed on a test bench with active 
loads which are representative of actual avionic loads and 
with a ± 270 DC power supply. A fan has also been used. 
For this experiment, a harness of 32 meters long is used. It 
is representative of one possible wire length of the power 
network of the FCS in aircrafts. It includes one twisted 
pair, one twisted quadrifilar cable, and one single wire.  
In Fig. 2, the architecture 1 is represented. Capacitive 
couplers are used to transmit on one twisted pair over 
+270 V and -270 V. Capacitive couplers are composed by 
a transformer for the galvanic isolation and two 
capacitors. The harness is composed by one twisted pair. 
We have also considered another possibility, i.e., to use a 
twisted quadrifilar for two different transmissions on the 
two polarities for the same load. In this case, the 
quadrifilar is short circuited at both ends of each polarity 
and inductive couplers can be used as illustrated in the 
architecture 2 in Fig. 3. In this figure, one signal is 
transmitted on the pair on the + 270 V and one other 
signal is transmitted on the other pair on the - 270 V. It 
must be emphasized that, for the same DC power, the 
diameter of each wire of the quadrifilar can be reduced to 
avoid an increase of the copper weight.

Figure 2. Point-to-point architecture with capacitive coupler 
 
 
Figure 3. Point-to-point architecture with inductive coupler 
There are two main interests to use this architecture. 
First, due to the short circuits at both ends, the 
communications are less disturbed by the noise produced 
by the power supply and the load. The other one is the 
possibility to use the avionics full duplex (AFDX) twisted 
quadrifilar already used in aircrafts for the transmissions 
[19]. These quadrifilars are light and their conception is 
mature. It means that the physical characteristics of the 
wires and the connectors are well known, which is the 
major asset for the implantation in the aircrafts. In 
addition, this architecture allows different possibilities of 
transmission. For example, it is possible to use the second 
polarity for redundancy or use the four couplers for a full 
duplex transmission. 
The architecture 3 is presented in Fig. 4. In this case, 
three couplers are used on the +270 V. Thus, the harness 
is composed of one quadrifilar and one wire for the           
-270 V polarity. Such architecture allows to test the case 
where one effector as an aileron is driven by two actuators 
(loads). For the architecture 3, only the transmission on 
the +270 V polarity has been tested. It is necessary to test 
the point-to-multipoint topology because the transfer 
function cannot be deduced from the point-to-point 
architecture due to the multipath and crosstalk. But, 
similarly to the architecture 2, it is possible to consider a 
transmission on both polarities for two loads for the 
explorations of different possibilities of transmissions.

B. Channel Measurements 
Transfer function measurements have been carried out 
with a network analyser in the [1;100] MHz bandwidth 
with a 5 kHz resolution bandwidth. To do this, we used 
the frequency scanning method. This technique involves 
scanning the channel using a network analyser with a 
constant step ∆f on a frequency bandwidth equal to 
f0+N∆f, where f0 is the minimum frequency, ∆f is the 
frequency step, and N is the number of measurement 
points. For each configuration, the transfer functions have 
been measured between the input and the output V1, V2, 
V3 and V4. Since there are more than two couplers on the 
architectures 2 and 3, 50 Ω loads are connected on the non 
used couplers during the transfer function measurements. 
III. 
PRELIMINARY RESULTS 
In order to prove the PLC feasibility and measure the 
throughput on the test bench, Homeplug Av modems have 
been plugged on the architectures 1 and 2 through the 
couplers. The power supply of the modems comes from 
the HVDC network via a DC/DC converter. Data 
transmissions between couplers and modems are done by 
a twisted pair. In this preliminary study, we just focus on 
the experimental aspects to obtain a first result on link 
capabilities using product on the shelf. 
The throughput measurements are shown in Fig. 5 and 
have been performed with the Jperf software. When the 
network is turned off, the throughput achieved 40 Mbit/s 
for both architectures. The tests with the active loads 
show a small decrease of the throughput. The tests with 
the fan, which is noisy, show the interest of the inductive 
coupler compared with the capacitive coupler. Indeed, the 
throughput does not change a lot with the inductive 
coupler but is divided by two with the capacitive coupler.

Figure 5. Throughput measurement 
The minimum bit rate measured is about 15 Mbit/s. As 
specified 
in 
the 
communication 
buses 
like 
ARINC 429 [20], MIL-STD-1553 [21] and ARINC 825 
[22], the required throughput for the FCS is about 
1 Mbit/s. Thus, the results presented in Fig. 5 confirm the 
feasibility of the PLC technology in such application and 
thus it is possible to use PLC technology to convey such 
buses for FCS. 
IV. 
INSERTION GAIN AND CHANNEL IMPULSE 
RESPONSE 
In Section III, throughput is measured for the 
architectures 1 and 2. Even if this throughput is sufficient 
for FCS, the Homeplug Av standard is not adapted for the 
aircraft communication. In fact, the OFDM symbol 
duration is equal to 46.52 µs, which is not in accordance 
with the real time constraints. Thus, we measured the 
channel transfer function to define new physical layer 
parameters adapted to this channel for a safety-critical 
aeronautical system. 
A. Tested configurations 
In Table I, the tested configurations are presented. 
“OFF” means that the power supply and the loads are 
connected to the network and they are turned off. “ON” 
means that the power supply and the loads are turned on. 
Transfer functions are measured between the two 
couplers. “P-to-p” means point-to-point and “P-to-m” 
means point-to-multipoint. 
B. Channel measurement results 
In this paragraph, we only show the transfer function 
with the network “ON” because there are no major 
differences between the transfer function with the network 
“OFF”. In addition, we do not represent the transfer 
function on the-270 V with the architecture 2 because, 
due to the symmetry of the network, transfer functions are 
similar on both polarities. 
Fig. 6 represents the insertion gain (IG) for the point-
to-point topology, namely, the architectures 1 and 2. For 
the 
architecture 
1, 
which 
corresponds 
to 
the 
configurations C2 and C4, the IG decreases over the 
entire bandwidth with several resonances. For the 
architecture 2, which corresponds to the configuration C8, 
the IG first decreases linearly (in dB) with the frequency 
up to 40 MHz, and varies from -5 to -25 dB. Then, the IG 
remains nearly constant between 40 MHz and 80 MHz 
and, beyond 80 MHz, decreases very rapidly. Fig. 7 
shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the 
IG for the architectures 1 and 2. For the configuration C2 
the insertion gain is higher than -23 dB over 50 % of the 
bandwidth and higher than -32 dB over 90 % of the entire 
bandwidth. For the configuration C4 the insertion gain is 
higher than -28 dB over 50 % of the bandwidth and higher 
than -35 dB over 90 % of the entire bandwidth

for the two configurations. There is a resonance at about 
39 MHz for configuration C12. The IG of the architecture 3 
is few dB lower than the IG of the architecture 2. Finally, 
Fig. 9 shows the CDF for the architecture 3. For the 
configuration C2 the insertion gain is higher than -25 dB 
over 50 % of the bandwidth and higher than -39 dB over 
90 % of the entire bandwidth. 
The channel may be studied also in the time domain in 
order to get the impulse response The channel impulse 
response has been obtained from the measurements of the 
complex transfer function by applying a 20000 points 
inverse Fourier transform (IFFT) in the [1;100] MHz 
bandwidth. The results of the channel responses for the 
architectures 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. 10.

Finally, the coherence bandwidth is calculated from the 
transfer function and the delay spread is calculated from the 
channel impulse response. The coherence bandwidth and the 
delay spread allow to define the subcarrier spacing and the 
cyclic prefix duration, respectively. 
V. 
COHERENCE BANDWIDTH AND DELAY SPREAD 
The coherence bandwidth is deduced from the absolute 
value of the autocorrelation of the complex transfer function 
[23]. The values of both coherence bandwidth and delay 
spread are calculated for 8 different frequency bandwidths 
for each configuration, from the [0;20] MHz bandwidth to 
the [0;100] MHz bandwidth with a step of 10 MHz. In the 
following, the coherence bandwidth is calculated for a 
correlation coefficient of 0.9. The delay spread is calculated 
from the channel impulse responses according to [24]. It 
appears that the values of the values of the coherence 
bandwidth and delay spread are quite independent of the 
frequency bandwidth analysis. Fig. 11 represents the 
coherence bandwidth versus the inverse of the delay spread 
for all the cases (bandwidths and configurations). 
Conventionally, the coherence bandwidth is proportional to 
the inverse of the delay spread. In our case, the linear 
regression leads to a correlation coefficient of 0.75. This 
result has been also noticed for indoor networks [25]. 
It appears that the architectures and the kind of coupler 
do not have a strong impact on the channel characteristics, 
the coherence bandwidth being of the order 700–1200 kHz, 
as the delay spread varies from 60 to 110 ns. These results 
are quite similar to those obtained for other embedded 
systems as shown in Table II. The delay spread measured 
for these channels is between 34 ns and 380 ns and the 
coherence bandwidth is between 0.4 MHz and 0.9 MHz.

VI. 
OPTIMIZATION OF OFDM PARAMETERS 
Taking into account the obtained results, the next step is 
to adapt the OFDM symbol duration to the real time 
constraint. The real time constraint is defined by the 
duration between the moment when a bit enter in the 
transmitter and the moment when the same is available at 
the output of the receiver. We assume that all the 
information contained in an OFDM symbol must be 
completely received to be considered usable. As a result, the 
duration of the OFDM symbol is considered as an 
incompressible latency time. Thus, it is necessary to ensure 
that the OFDM symbol duration is lower than the real time 
constraints. It leads to an OFDM symbol duration between 
17 µs and 34 µs, as explained in Section I. The OFDM 
symbol duration 
TOFDM
is given by the equation: 
cyclic prefix duration
subcarrier spacing
TOFDM
+
=
1
  (1) 
Thus, we need to adapt the sub-carrier spacing and the 
cyclic prefix duration (CP). 
A. OFDM Sub-carrier Spacing 
In order to meet the real time constraints, it is necessary 
to minimize the processing time for in the physical layer. 
Since fast Fourier transform (FFT) is a time consuming 
process proportional to the number of sub-carriers, one can 
try to decrease the number of carriers and choose, as in 
common practice, a sub-carrier spacing less than 10 % of 
the coherence bandwidth. Taking into account the values in 
Fig. 10, this leads to a 70 kHz sub-carrier spacing, which is 
about three times the value given in Homeplug Av 
specifications 
(24.414 kHz). 
To 
decrease 
the 
time 
processing, it is better to use a FFT size of power of 2. 
Finally, it is possible to switch off sub-carriers to transmit 
data on the proper frequency bandwidth. In our case, it leads 
to 428 or 1428 useful sub-carriers for a transmission 
bandwidth over 30 MHz or 100 MHz respectively.  
B. Interference Characterization 
Using the channel impulse response values, it is also 
possible to compute the inter symbol interference (ISI) and 
the inter carrier interference (ICI) according to the cyclic 
prefix CP length.

Then, it becomes possible to choose the optimal CP 
length because the increase of the CP length decreases the 
power spectral density of ISI and ICI but also reduces 
spectral efficiency and data rate. The power spectral density 
of ISI and ICI can be computed by the equation [27]:

versus the sub-carrier index and for various lengths of the 
CP. As expected, the interference PSD decreases rapidly 
with the length of the cyclic prefix but, beyond 20 samples, 
it does not vary appreciably. Thus, it is not necessary to use 
a Lcp value higher than 20 samples.

C. Simulation Results 
To show the influence of the CP length on the bit error 
rate (BER), an OFDM transmission chain has been 
simulated using Matlab. The simulated transmission chain is 
presented in Fig. 13. The first block of the transmitter is a 
random binary data generator. The generated data are 
mapped using binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation 
and an IFFT is then applied. The CP is then added to the 
OFDM symbol in the time domain. The channel includes 
both the complex channel impulse response and the additive 
withe Gaussian noise (AWGN). At the receiver, the inverse 
process is realized and an equalization is used to 
compensate the distortion effect introduced by the channel. 
For theses simulations, the channel estimation is assumed to 
be ideal and the zero forcing equalization is applied [28].

Figure 14. BER for different cyclic prefix length 
The time and frequency synchronization are assumed to 
be perfect. Each useful sub-carrier transmits one bit 
corresponding to a BPSK symbol. In the following 
simulations, the configuration C11 is tested over the 
[0;36] MHz bandwidth and all the sub-carriers in the 
[30;36] MHz bandwidth are turned off. The SNR is defined 
as the ratio between the received power and the noise 
power. Fig. 14 shows the influence of the CP length (in 
number of samples) on the BER. In this configuration, the 
sub-carrier spacing is equal to 70 kHz. The degradation of 
the BER increases when the CP length decreases. One can 
observe that a CP length of 20 samples allows to absorb the 
interference due to the multipaths, as expressed in the 
Section VI.B. Taking into account the interferences and the 
BER calculations, we propose a CP duration of 20 samples, 
which correspond to 666 ns on the [1;30] MHz bandwidth. 
As a comparison, if the cyclic duration was chosen equal to 
2 to 4 times the delay spread, as suggested in [29], we 
would obtain a CP duration between 220 and 440 ns, which 
is not sufficient in our case as observed in Fig.14. 
VII. SYNTHESIS AND CONCLUSION  
In this paper, we have studied the feasibility of PLC 
transmissions 
for 
avionic 
safety 
critical 
systems. 
Throughput measurements with Homeplug Av modems 
have been done and show a sufficient throughput for the 
FCS. In addition, the channel measurements prove that it is 
possible to reduce the duration of an OFDM symbol, 
compared to the Homeplug Av standard, by both increasing 
the sub-carrier spacing and decreasing the cyclic prefix

duration. In fact, in the Homeplug Av standard, the sub-
carrier spacing is 24.414 kHz, the minimum cyclic prefix 
duration is 5.56 µs, and the OFDM symbol duration is 
46.52 µs. In this PLC application, we propose to increase 
the sub-carrier spacing up to 70 kHz and to decrease the CP 
duration to 666 ns. Consequently, the OFDM symbol 
duration is 14.94 µs. These results will help us to define the 
physical layer parameters for a PLC avionics system in 
accordance with real-time constraints of a fast control loop. 
This study can be applied to other critical avionic systems 
running on a HVDC network like landing gear. It is also 
possible to use this study for a slow control loop on HVDC 
network like thrust reversal.  
In the next steps, we will continue to define the OFDM 
parameters (constellation and frequency bandwidth) and the 
channel coding to ensure a sufficient quality of the service 
for the FCS. In addition of the real time constraint, the 
quality of service that is defined by the useful bitrate 
(10 Mbit/s), the bit error rate (10-12 as on the AFDX), and 
the respect of the DO-160 gauge in conducted emissions 
may be taken into account in the parameters of the physical 
layer.
