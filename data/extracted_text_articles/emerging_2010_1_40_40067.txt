Abstract—We consider a single-link loss system of fixed 
bandwidth capacity, which accommodates K service-classes of 
Poisson traffic with different bandwidth-per-call requirements. 
Depending on the occupied link bandwidth, in-service calls can 
tolerate bandwidth compression while increasing their service 
time (elastic calls). In this system, we study the effect of the 
bandwidth reservation (BR) policy on various performance 
measures and mainly on Call Blocking Probabilities (CBP). 
The BR policy can achieve CBP equalization among service-
classes, or, alternatively, guarantee a certain quality of service 
for each service-class. We provide a recurrent formula for the 
calculation of the link occupancy distribution. Based on it we 
determine CBP, link utilization and average number of calls in 
the system. The accuracy of the proposed formula is verified by 
simulation and is found to be quite accurate.

 INTRODUCTION 
The classical Erlang Multi-rate Loss Model (EMLM) is 
used to analyze the call blocking behavior of a single-link 
loss system that accommodates K service-classes with 
different and fixed bandwidth-per-call requirements. Calls 
of each service-class arrive to the system according to a 
Poisson process and compete for the available link 
bandwidth under the complete sharing (CS) policy (calls of 
all service-classes compete for all available bandwidth 
resources). Calls are blocked and lost only if their required 
bandwidth is higher than the available link bandwidth. 
Otherwise, they are accepted in the system for a generally 
distributed service time  [1]. Note that while in service, calls 
cannot alter their assigned bandwidth.  
In the EMLM, exploiting the fact that the steady state 
distribution of the number of calls in the link has a product 
form solution (PFS)  [2], an accurate recursive formula 
(known as Kaufman-Roberts formula, KR formula) has been 
separately proposed by Kaufman  [1] and Roberts  [3] which 
determines the link occupancy distribution and simplifies 
the determination of call blocking probabilities (CBP). This 
simplification resulted in a large amount of extensions of the 
EMLM and applications of the KR formula both in wired 
(e.g.,  [4]- [7]) and wireless networks (e.g.,  [8]- [11]). Among 
other EMLM extensions, Roberts proposed in  [12] an 
approximate recursive formula for calculating CBP in the 
EMLM 
under 
the 
Bandwidth 
Reservation 
policy 
(EMLM/BR). The BR policy is used in order to achieve 
CBP equalization among service-classes, or guarantee a 
certain quality of service (QoS) for each service-class. Note 
that contrary to the CS policy where the stationary 
probabilities have a PFS, the BR policy cannot be analyzed 
by the use of a PFS. This is because one-way transitions 
appear in the state space, which destroy reversibility  [13]. 
In this paper, we apply the BR policy and study its 
effects in another extension of the EMLM proposed in  [14] 
by Stamatelos and Koukoulidis who incorporate elastic 
traffic in the EMLM. We name, herein, the model of  [14] 
Extended EMLM (E-EMLM) and our proposed model E-
EMLM/BR. In the E-EMLM, calls of each service-class 
arrive to the system according to a Poisson process with 
different and elastic bandwidth-per-call requirements. As 
long as the occupied link bandwidth does not exceed the 
capacity of the link, all in-service calls use their peak-
bandwidth requirement. When a new call arrives and its 
required peak-bandwidth is higher than the available link 
bandwidth, the system accepts the new call (contrary to the 
EMLM where this call is blocked) by compressing not only 
the bandwidth of all in-service calls (of all service-classes) 
but also the initial peak-bandwidth of the new call. On the 
other hand when an in-service call, whose bandwidth is 
compressed, departs from the system then the remaining in-
service calls (of all service-classes) expand their bandwidth. 
It is worth mentioning that the allocated bandwidth to 
elastic in-service calls alters (becomes compressed or 
expanded) 
in 
proportion 
to 
their 
peak-bandwidth 
requirement and that their service time is adjusted 
accordingly (becomes expanded or compressed) so that the 
product (service time) by (bandwidth per call) remains 
constant. A new call is blocked and lost when the 
compressed bandwidth should be less than a minimum 
proportion (rmin) of its required peak-bandwidth. Note that 
rmin is common for all service-classes.  
The compression/expansion of bandwidth destroys 
reversibility in the E-EMLM and therefore no PFS exists. 
However, in  [14] an approximate recursive formula is 
proposed which determines the link occupancy distribution. 
Before we proceed to the E-EMLM/BR note that extensions 
of the E-EMLM which study the co-existence of elastic and 
adaptive traffic (in-service calls can alter their bandwidth 
but not their service time) can be found in  [15],  [16]. 
Potential applications of the E-EMLM (and the E-
EMLM/BR) are mainly in emerging wireless networks 
supporting elastic traffic (e.g.,  [17],  [18]).

Since the proposed E-EMLM/BR does not have a PFS 
we provide an approximate recursive formula for the 
calculation of the link occupancy distribution that simplifies 
the determination of various performance measures 
including: a) CBP, b) link utilization, c) average number of 
calls of each service-class in the system and d) delay of calls 
due to their bandwidth fluctuation.              
The remainder of this paper is as follows:  In Section II, 
we review the EMLM, the EMLM/BR and the E-EMLM. In 
Section III, we propose the E-EMLM/BR. In Section IV, we 
present numerical results where the new model is compared 
to the existing models and evaluated through simulation 
results. We conclude in Section V.

REVIEW OF THE EMLM, EMLM/BR AND E-EMLM 
A. Review of the EMLM 
Consider a link of capacity C bandwidth units (b.u.) that 
accommodates calls of K service-classes. A call of service- 
class k (k =1,…,K) arrives in the system according to a 
Poisson process with rate λk, requests bk b.u. and if these b.u. 
are available it remains in the system for an exponentially 
distributed service time with mean 
−1
µk
. While in service, 
the call cannot alter its assigned bandwidth. If the bk b.u. are 
not available the call is blocked and lost. Let j be the 
occupied link bandwidth (j=0,…,C) then the link occupancy 
distribution, G(j) , is given by the accurate and recursive KR 
formula  [1] , [3]:

The proof of (1) is based on the fact that the steady state 
distribution of the number of calls in the link has a PFS. If nk 
is the number of calls of service-class k in the steady state 
and n=(n1, n2,…,nk,…, nK) then the steady state distribution, 
P(n), is given by  [2]:

Note that (7) is recursive, although the EMLM/BR is a 
non PFS model. This feature is based on the assumption 
(approximation) that calls of service-class k do not exist (are 
negligible) in states  j > C-t(k) and is incorporated in (7) by 
the variable Dk(j-bk) of (8). The BR policy is used to attain

CBP equalization among different service-classes that share 
a link by a proper selection of the BR parameters. If, for 
example, CBP equalization is required between calls of two 
service-classes with b1=1 and b2=10 b.u., respectively, then 
t(1) = 9 b.u and t(2) = 0 b.u. so that b1 + t(1) = b2 + t(2). 
Note that t(1) = 9 b.u means that 9 b.u. are reserved to 
benefit calls of the 2nd service-class. The CBP of service-
class k, Bk, in the EMLM/BR is given by:

If t(k) = 0 for all k (k=1,…,K) then the EMLM results. 
Having obtained the values of G(j)’s according to (7) we 
calculate the link utilization and the average number of 
service-class k calls in the system according to  (4) and (5), 
respectively.  
C. Review of the E-EMLM 
Consider again a link of capacity C b.u. that 
accommodates calls of K service-classes. A call of service- 
class k (k =1,…,K) arrives in the system according to a 
Poisson process with arrival rate λk and requests bk b.u. 
(peak-bandwidth requirement). If j + bk ≤  C, the call is 
accepted in the system with its peak-bandwidth requirement 
and remains in the system for an exponentially distributed 
service time with mean
−1
µk
. If T ≥  j + bk > C the call is 
accepted in the system by compressing not only its peak-
bandwidth requirement but also the assigned bandwidth of all 
in-service calls. The compressed bandwidth of the new 
service-class k call is: 
k

                                                            (10) 
where r ≡ r(n) = C/j΄,
k
k
b
b

and T is the 
limit (in b.u.) up to which bandwidth compression is 
permitted.  
Similarly, the bandwidth of all in-service calls will be 
compressed and become equal to 
i
i
j b
C
b
'
' =
for i = 1,…,K. 
After the compression of both the new call and the in-service 
calls the state of the system is j = C. The minimum 
bandwidth that a call of service-class k (either new or in-
service) can tolerate is given by the expression: 
k

,min
                                                   (11) 
where rmin = C/T is the minimum proportion of the required 
peak-bandwidth and is common for all service-classes. 
This means that if upon arrival of a service-class k call, with 
peak-bandwidth requirement bk b.u., we have j΄= j + bk > T 
(or equivalently,
j > T
'
or C/j΄ < rmin) then the call is 
blocked and lost without further affecting the system.  
After the bandwidth compression, calls increase their 
service time so that the product (service time) by 
(bandwidth per call) remains constant. Thus, due to 
bandwidth compression calls of service-class k may remain 
in the system more than 
−1
µk
time units. Increasing the value 
of T, decreases rmin and increases the delay of calls of 
service-class k (compared to the initial service time
−1
µk
).  
Therefore the value of T can be chosen so that this delay 
remains within acceptable levels.  
To illustrate the previous compression mechanism 
consider the following simple example. Let C = 3 b.u., T = 
5. b.u., K = 2 service-classes, α1 = α2 = 1 erl, b1 = 1 b.u., b2 = 
2 b.u and

 time unit.  The permissible states 
n = (n1, n2) of the system are 12 and are presented in Table I 
together with the occupied link bandwidth, j=n1b1+n2b2, 
before and after compression has been applied. Note that 
compression is applied if T≥ j > C (bold values of the 3rd 
column of Table I). After compression has been applied, we 
have that j = C (bold values of the 4th column of Table I). 
For example, assume that a new 2nd service-class call 
arrives while the system is in state (n1, n2) = (1, 1) and j = C 
= 3 b.u. The new call is accepted in the system, since 
'j = j 
+ b2 = T  = 5 b.u., after bandwidth compression has been 
applied to all calls (new and in-service calls). The new state 
of the system is now (n1, n2) = (1, 2). In this state, and based 
on (11), calls of the 1st and 2nd service-class compress their 
bandwidth to:

assigned bandwidth

b
is shared to the remaining 
calls in proportion to their peak-bandwidth requirement. 
Thus, in the new state (n1, n2) = (1, 1) the 1st service-class 
call expands its bandwidth to

As T increases, Bk decreases and Dk increases. Therefore, the 
choice of T can be a trade-off between Bk and Dk. Before we 
proceed to the application of the BR policy in the E-EMLM 
we give the accurate and approximate CBP results for our 
simple example in the E-EMLM, and the corresponding 
CBP results for the EMLM, when C = 3:  
 
E-EMLM 
Accurate CBP: B1 = 17.48%, B2 = 35.74% 
Approx. CBP (based on (12), (16)): B1=17.00%, B2=36.04% 
EMLM 
Accurate CBP (based on (1), (3)): B1= 25.00%, B2 = 57.14% 
 
In the E-EMLM, the accurate CBP results are based on 
the numerical calculation of the irreversible Markov chain. 
The comparison shows that even in a small example, the 
approximation of  [14] is quite well. Furthermore, compared 
to the EMLM we see a substantial CBP decrease due to the 
existence of a compression/expansion mechanism.      
III. 
THE E-EMLM UNDER THE BR POLICY 
If we apply the BR policy to the E-EMLM (E-
EMLM/BR) according to  [12], then (12) takes the form:

and t(k) is the reserved bandwidth (BR parameter) for 
service-class k calls. 
The CBP of service-class k, Bk, in the E-EMLM/BR is 
given by:

If t(k) = 0 for all k (k=1,…,K) then the E-EMLM results. 
Having obtained the values of G(j)’s according to (22) we 
can calculate the link utilization, the average number of 
service-class k calls in the system and their average delay 
according to  (18), (19) and (20), respectively. Note that in 
(19), yk(j) = 0 if j>T-t(k) as (22) implies. The accurate and 
approximate equalized CBP results for our simple example 
in the E-EMLM/BR, and the corresponding equalized CBP 
results for the EMLM/BR, when C = 3 are:  
 
E-EMLM/BR (t(1) = 1, t(2)=0) 
Accurate CBP: B1 = B2 =32.34% 
Approx. CBP (based on (21)-(23)): B1 = B2 = 31.71% 
EMLM/BR (t(1) = 1, t(2)=0)  
Accurate CBP: B1 = B2 = 54.5% 
Approx. CBP (based on (7)-(9)): B1 = B2 = 52.0% 
 
In the E-EMLM/BR and the EMLM/BR, the accurate 
CBP results are based on the numerical calculation of the 
corresponding irreversible Markov chains. In the E-
EMLM/BR, the comparison between the accurate and 
approximate CBP results shows that even in this small 
example, the proposed formulas ((21)-(23)) are valid. 
IV. 
EVALUATION 
In this section, we compare the analytical CBP and link 
utilization results obtained by the EMLM, EMLM/BR, E-
EMLM and E-EMLM/BR via a numerical example. Due to 
space limitations we present simulation CBP results (mean 
values of 7 runs) only for the E-EMLM and the E-
EMLM/BR. Simulation is based on Simscript II.5  [20].  
We consider a single link of capacity C = 60 b.u. that 
accommodates calls of two service-classes, with the 
following traffic characteristics: 
1st service-class: α1 = 24 erl, b1 = 1 b.u. 
2nd service-class: α2 = 6 erl, b2 = 4 b.u. 
The value of T = 70, and rmin = C/T=6/7 is the minimum 
proportion of the required peak-bandwidth. In the case of 
the BR policy, we choose t(1)=3 and t(2)=0 in order to 
achieve CBP equalization between the two service-classes 
since: b1 + t(1) = b2 + t(2). In the x-axis of all figures, α1 
increases in steps of 1 erl while α2 is constant. So Point 1 is 
(α1, α2) = (24.0, 6.0) while Point 8 is (α1, α2) = (31.0, 6.0). 
In Fig. 1 and 2, we present the analytical and the simulation 
CBP results of the 1st and the 2nd service-class calls, 
respectively, in the case of the E-EMLM. For comparison, 
we give the corresponding analytical CBP results of the 
EMLM. In Fig. 3, we present the analytical and simulation 
CBP results (equalized CBP) in the case of the E-
EMLM/BR 
policy. 
For 
comparison, 
we 
give 
the 
corresponding analytical results for the EMLM/BR.  All 
figures show that: i) analytical and simulation CBP results 
are very close and ii) the compression/expansion 
mechanism of the E-EMLM and the E-EMLM/BR, reduces 
the CBP compared to those obtained by the EMLM and the 
EMLM/BR, respectively.  Finally in Fig.4, we present the 
link utilization (analytical results) for all models. The 
compression/expansion mechanism increases the link 
utilization since it decreases CBP.

CONCLUSION 
We propose an analytical model for the recursive 
calculation of various performance measures in the E-
EMLM/BR. The BR policy guarantees a certain QoS among 
elastic calls of different service-classes. Simulation results 
verify the analytical results and prove the accuracy and the 
consistency of the proposed model. Potential applications of 
the proposed model are in emerging wireless networks that 
support elastic traffic. A future extension, is the application 
of our model in such networks based on the reduced load 
approximation method which has been extensively used for 
the CBP calculation in multirate loss networks.
