Abstract— The paper presents a development of the multi 
sensor embedded system for measuring up to eight sensor 
parameters optimized by appropriate algorithms. Since most 
of the industrial applications use the analog sensors with 
transmitters for sensing the process parameters particularly in 
harsh environment because of their strong mechanical 
packaging and ruggedness. Then the benefits of digital 
technology in the vast world of analog sensors can be 
implemented by development of appropriate multi sensor 
embedded system. The developed system has most of the 
features of smart sensing and communicating to other 
embedded/Host PC through a wireless interface.  The 
developed prototype system has been tested with RTD 
temperature sensors for temperature measurement over a 
wireless 
connectivity 
for 
various 
distances. 
From 
an 
application point of view, a mobile robotic platform is 
developed to test the multi-sensor embedded system for Agro-
Industrial Applications. Further, the average loss in signal is 
measured and received power is calculated and compared. 
Finally, the effect of obstacles at indoor and outdoor range  for 
wireless transmission has been presented.  It is observed that 
for better transmission of signals via wireless communication, 
the low frequency along with low baud rate and line of sight 
range is required to minimize the signal loss.

 INTRODUCTION 
A "smart sensor" is a transducer (or actuator) that 
provides functions beyond what is necessary to generate a 
correct representation of a sensed or controlled quantity. The 
"smart sensor" functionality will typically simplify the 
integration of the transducer into applications in a networked 
environment [1]. Embedded with a microcontroller unit, a 
smart sensor has much more built in intelligence over a 
traditional sensor. So, it can perform more powerful 
functions 
such 
as 
self-identification, 
self–calibration, 
converting the raw sensor signal into a digital form . Multi 
sensor systems are now used in many application areas, 
including environment and habitat monitoring, healthcare, 
home automation, and traffic control especially in agro and 
food applications like Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant 
automation, fish pond management systems, environmental 
monitoring, precision agriculture, machine and process 
control, building and facility automation. Wireless based 
Smart sensor module has drawn attention of the industry on 
account of low cost, low power consumption, flexibility, and 
use in remote areas.  
Precision farming is the conjunction of a new 
management perspective with the new and emerging 
information and communication technologies leading to 
higher yields and lower costs in the running of large scale 
commercial agricultural fields. Further, the embedded 
sensing technologies allow the identification of pests in the 
crops, increased moisture or drought at a real-time interval 
with automated actuation devices to control irrigation, 
fertigation and pest control in order to offset the adverse 
conditions. The Precision farming system incorporates:  a) 
Sensing agricultural parameters b) Identification of sensing 
location and data gathering c) Transferring data from crop 
field to control station for decision making and d) Actuation 
and Control decision based on sensed data. 
Over the last few years, the advancement in sensing, 
embedded 
technology 
and 
wireless 
communication 
technologies has significantly brought down the cost of 
deployment and running of a feasible precision agriculture 
framework. Emerging wireless technologies with low power 
needs and low data rate capabilities, which perfectly suites 
precision agriculture, have been developed [2, 3].  
Agricultural Sensors, positioning systems for detecting 
location of sensors, actuators like sprinklers, foggers, valve-
controlled irrigation system, etc. are also reported in the 
literature. However, very limited work has been done so far 
on the wireless multi-sensing system to be used to transfer 
sensor data wirelessly from crop field to the remote central 
PC. 
In this paper development of a low cost multi sensor 
system for sensing eight input analog sensors along with 
reconfigurable automation, and communicating with host 
(wired and wireless)  is presented. The proposed smart multi 
sensor system is an attempt to develop a generic platform 
with ‘plug-and-play’ capability to support hardware 
interface, communication, needs of multiple sensors, and 
actuators. The system has been implemented using our own 
developed eight potentiometer based kit and tested with 
resistance temperature detector (RTD)  sensors for sensing, 
decision-making and their control in order to reduce the false 
alarms and unwanted process shut downs. The data sent 
using wireless communication makes system efficient, 
effective and intelligent decisions based on processed data 
that is accurate and analyzed. Wireless communication has 
its own advantages like Ease of installation; no bulky cables 
are needed and simplify design of systems. In this paper, we 
introduce the new smart sensor device with processing and 
communication as well as various sensing abilities for 
industrial and agro – based monitoring applications. 
Further, considering the potential application of this field, 
the present extended work details on the development of 
wireless mobile robotic platform for farm sensing is also

applications. Section 3 gives the system description.  Finally,

RELATED WORK 
There are many projects undertaken and many researches 
proposed the development of smart sensors and their 
networking. The design and implementation of home 
network based on smart sensor devices focuses on the 
development of system for home purposes where it can be 
implemented for door lock system, gas detecting system, 
controls TV, refrigerator, and outlets, and applying RFID 
into home networks [5]. The development of smart sensors 
for pollutant gas detection like CO and LPG where a CO gas 
detector is developed and controlled by smart sensor to give 
alarm if gas generation is above the set limit and used in 
home, institutions and industries [6, 7]. The Motes and Smart 
Dust project at UC, Berkeley focused on creating low-cost 
micro-sensors, with emphasis on the development of sensors 
and an embedded operating system, Tiny OS . Recently, the 
wireless sensor networking is used for life science 
automation where they propose a wireless sensor network 
(WSN)  especially dedicated to the field of life science 
automation (LSA), which can be used for multiple purposes 
[8]. This area provides a bulk of process and environmental 
parameters, which have to be controlled. Passel and Danzer 
developed a portable, mobile instrument to measure 
temperature, relative humidity, noise, brightness and 
ammonia content in the air within the house and transferred 
the data wirelessly to a PC through an infrared data link [9, 
10, 11].  
In precision agriculture, the most important step is the 
generation of maps of the soil with its characteristics. These 
included grid soil sampling, yield monitoring and crop 
scouting. RS (remote sensing) coupled with GPS, 
coordinates and produce accurate maps and models of the 
agricultural fields. The sampling was typically through 
electronic sensors such as soil probes and remote optical 
scanners from satellites. The collection of such data in the 
form of electronic computer databases gave birth to the GIS. 
Statistical analyses were then conducted on the data and the 
variability of agricultural land with respect to its properties 
was charted. The technologies used are expensive like 
satellite sensing and was labor intensive where the maps 
charting the agricultural fields were mostly manually done. 
Blackmore et al., in 1994 [12] reported a comprehensive 
system designed to optimize agricultural production by 
carefully tailoring soil and crop management to correspond 
to the unique condition found in each field while maintaining 
environmental quality. Further, only large farms could afford 
the high initial investment in the form of electronic 
equipment for sensing and communicating. The technologies 
proposed at this point comprised of three aspects: (a) Remote 
Sensing (RS), (b) Geosynchronous Positioning System 
(GPS) and (c) Geographical Information System (GIS).  
The system we have developed is useful because various 
physical parameters can be sensed and manually controlled 
on automatic false detection, as well as eight parameters can 
be manage precisely via single micro controller. Finding the 
better location and minimum loss in signal for wireless 
communication to device, makes the system more 
challenging and applicable [13].

III. 
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 
The generic architecture of system is shown in figure 1. It 
consists of eight sensors with transmitters. To make the 
system more compact MICROCHIP’s 8 bit PIC18f452 has 
been used which has most of the peripherals on chip. It has 
low power consumption, fast executing speed and on chip 
1536 bytes of flash and 256 bytes of data EEPROM memory. 
It can operate up to 10MIPS (DC to 40MHz).  There are 18 
interrupt sources, two-timer modules, two capture/ compare / 
PWM modules, 8x8 hardware multiplier and master 
synchronous serial port module having SPI and I2C 
interface. On chip serial communication supports both 
RS232 and RS485. The system can work up to 40 MHz 
clock frequency. But response time of many sensors is of the 
order of 100µs or more [12]. So, a processor speed of 
10MHz to 15MHz should be adequate. Considering the 
optimum performance and cost of the overall system and due 
to easy availability of crystal oscillators up to 16MHz, the 
system clock of 10 MHz is selected for current application. 
There is 10 bits, 8 analog input channels A/D converter with 
acquisition time 12.86µs. The eight input sensor nodes 
operate under stored program control [14]. The micro 
controller A/D converter performs periodic scans of these 
sensors. The scan rate is programmable and can be adaptive 
based on the rate of change of sensor reading. The sensors 
data are compared with set-point values stored in memory. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 For testing of eight channels, an eight potentiometer 
based kit has been developed in laboratory shown in figure 2. 
The parameters are firstly checked with eight potentiometer 
kit and then module has been checked by RTD sensors. The 
eight potentiometers are connected at PortA, analog input 
channels of microcontroller. Voltage (0-5V) is converted into 
corresponding engineering units for different parameters.  
The control of system can be done by two switches (RB0 and 
RB1) connected on port B of microcontroller. The value of 
parameter one (0 - 1000PPM) can be adjusted by first 
potentiometer and when switch RB0 is pressed it comes to 
the set point value for first parameter which is already stored 
in flash memory. The set point value can be increment or 
decrement (0-1000PPM at span of 100PPM) by pushing 
switch RB0 according to user’s need. If switch RB1 is 
pressed, it escapes from set point routine and automatically 
compares set point and parameter value to give alarm 
indication if sensor parameter value is greater than set point 
values and parameter value can be adjusted, if needed. 
Similarly, using second potentiometer, parameter two is 
tested and set point value can be set for second parameter. If 
another parameter has to be set among eight parameters, the 
processor can switch to them periodically in similar manner 
by pressing key RB1. Alarm acquisition is done by open 
collector source ULN2003 (transistor array). 
In between all process, the processor continuously checks 
if character ‘*’ has been received from keyboard, then it 
transmits all parameters and set point values to the hyper 
terminal as shown in figure 3 and come back to the main 
program. All measured data is stored in on chip Flash and 
also serial EEPROM has been interfaced via I2C bus to 
utilize the non – volatile memory. All values are transmitted 
to LCD unit using the LCD interface.  The parameter values 
and their set - point values can be transmit via RS232 or 
wireless module (DIGI’s X-Bee – PRO 802.15.4 transceiver) 
which has capability to transmit data up to 1.6 km line of 
sight at frequency 2.4 GHz. In general, a lower frequency 
allows a longer transmission range and stronger capability to 
penetrate through walls and glasses [3]. However, the GHz 
bands of 2.400-2.4835 are worldwide acceptable. The 
microcontroller apart from the measurement of analog 
parameters [5] also performs all the required housekeeping 
tasks and interacts with the other peripherals. A battery 
supply monitoring circuit generates an interrupt on detection 
of a battery fail condition and initiates an emergency 
measurement backup. There are two main time intervals that 
need to be maintained. The sensors with their transmitters are 
carefully timed using software timers. Assembly and C 
language programming is done using MPLAB IDE tool 
along with PICDEM-2PLUS debugger and programmer for 
implementation of developed algorithms, monitoring and 
display of parameters and set point values. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The developed multi-sensing system performs both tasks 
viz. sensing of parameters as well as controlling the 
movements of the mobile robot using left and right DC

motors [14]. The summary of hardware configuration for 
mobile multi-sensor embedded system is as follows: 
 
• 
Central 
PC: 
Data 
acquisition 
using 
wireless 
communication and analysis 
• 
PIC18F452 – 4 MHz, RAM 1.5kbytes, flash program 
memory – 32kbytes, 8 channel - 10-bit A/D converter 
for sensor and motor control 
• 
Soil temperature and humidity measurement using 
sensor s LM335 and  RDT respectively 
• 
ZigBee/802.15.4 RS232 RF Modem – wireless 
connectivity between mobile robot and central PC 
• 
Two DC motors: Supply voltage 12V, 6mm shaft 
diameter, 30 RPM 
• 
One stepper motor: for mobile robot arm for sensor 
assembly  
• 
Stepper motor driver: 1 L293. Battery: 12volt, 3.6Ah 
 
The temperature sensors LM335 and RTD are mounted 
on the robotic arm assembly. The sensors calibration 
circuitry is also included in the design. The sensor interface 
circuit to PIC18f452 is composed of unity gain amplifiers 
followed by a filter circuit to reduce the loading effect and 
noise respectively. The filtered signal is given to the A/D 
converter for sensor signal digitization. 
The motor driver circuit is designed to drive DC motor 
and stepper motor. The stepper motor for arm is driven in 
half stepping mode, so that the effective step angle is 1.8 
degrees. IC L293 is used to drive the DC and stepper motors, 
which limits the current up to 600mA.  
A. Temperature measurement 
The temperature measurement is implemented using the 
PT100 Resistance Temperature Detector (RTD) sensors [15]. 
The transmitter circuit takes RTD as input and provides 4-
20mA output corresponding to the measuring range of 0-
50°C. The XTR-103 has built-in provisions for RTD current 
excitation, signal amplification and liberalization on a single 
integrated circuit. The zero and span adjustment are carried 
out to get 4-20mA output signals for a working temperature 
range of 0-50°C. These 4-20mA current signals are 
interfaced to the ADC input port of the micro controller for 
further processing. First, temperature transmitter circuit is 
calibrated by connecting a standard resistance box. The 
resistance is set to 100Ω, corresponding to 0oC, and then 
ZERO adjustment is done to get 4mA at the output. Similarly 
it is set to 119.4Ω, corresponding to 50oC, and SPAN 
adjustment is done to get 20mA at the output. Similarly the 
other temperature transmitter circuits are calibrated. 
B. Relative humidity measurement 
Measurement of relative humidity in the field plays an 
important role during the harvesting of the seeds [15]. So this 
facility is also included in the designed system. 
1) Measurement Technique 
Psychrometry is the best-suited technique for measuring 
relative humidity particularly in process industries, which 
call for rugged and continuous operation [16]. The accuracy 
of the dry and wet bulb sensors, the maintenance of a 
minimum ventilation speed, and a clean wick are the major 
factors that affect the measurement of the relative humidity. 
When the wick of the psychrometer becomes hard, the bulb 
will not be thoroughly wet and inaccurate readings will 
result. Care should be taken to keep the wick clean. It should 
not be handled unless the fingers are perfectly clean. 
Distilled water should be used for keeping the wick wet. 
Accuracy with the fixed position psychrometers can be 
obtained only by creating free circulation of ambient air 
around the bulbs. Since relative humidity depends on more 
than one parameter, multiple regression method is used to 
derive the relationship. Again by dividing the operating 
range into three zones, viz.  0oC - l0oC, 11oC - 20°C and 
21°C – 50°C and then by using the MATLAB and Simulink 
software package, second order equations are developed for 
the entire range of temperature 0oC - 50°C to get the desired 
accuracy of about ± % in the RH measurement. The equation 
for the temperature range of 0oC to 10°C is : 
RH = 97.4056 - 15.4898 Td + 16.2592 Tw+ 0.2317 Td
2 - 
0.2972 Tw
2  
 
 
(1) 
The equation for range the 11°C to 20°C is: 
RH = 93.0129 - 12.6491 Td + 13.4314 Tw + 0.1229 Td
2 - 
0.1485 Tw
2  
 
 
   (2) 
The equation for the temperature range of 21°C -50°C is: 
RH = 91.0058 - 9.0872 Td + 9.5597 Tw+ 0.0471 Td
2 - 
0.0540 Tw
2  
                                (3) 
where, Td – dry bulb temperature and Tw – wet bulb 
temperature. 
2) Dry and wet bulb temperature transmitter 
The dry and wet bulb temperature transmitter is 
implemented using the PT100 Resistance Temperature 
Detector (RTD) sensors [17]. A mechanism of a water 
container for keeping the wet bulb wet, by covering the 
corresponding RTD with one end of a wick and keeping the 
other end of the wick in the water tank is incorporated. At 
least half of the length of the wick remains dipped in the 
water. Similarly a fan mechanism is provided for getting the 
required airflow around the wet RTD. Circuits using XTR 
103 are implemented for measuring the two temperatures. 
Each circuit takes RTD as input and provides 4-20mA output 
corresponding to the measuring range of 0-50°C. The XTR-
103 has built-in provisions for RTD current excitation, signal 
amplification and liberalization on a single integrated circuit. 
Two similar circuits, based on XTR-103, are implemented 
for measuring the dry and wet temperatures. The zero and 
span adjustment are carried out to get 4-20mA output signals 
for a working temperature range of 0-50°C. These two 4-
20mA current signals are interfaced to the ADC input port of 
the micro controller card for further processing. 
C. Wireless communication 
For wireless communication RS 232 based DIGI’s X-
Bee–PRO 802.15.4 transceiver module having OQPSK

based modulation is used. The operating temperature is –40 
oC to 85oC and the power down current is less than 6mA. It 
can   transmit data up to 1 mile for outdoors range (LOS) and 
100m in indoor range at frequency 2.4GHz .The receiver 
sensitivity is - 100dBm. For every 6dB gain in TX power or 
RX sensitivity the range of wireless link doubles. For 
wireless communication, location is also an important issue. 
Therefore, the module has been tested at different distances 
and different baud rates inside and outside office to analyze 
the effect of obstacles in line of sight (LOS) up to 300m. The 
baud rate error was 0.16%, which is obtained from the 
calculated and desired baud values at 16MHz [18]. A serial 
RS-232 and wireless interface is provided to communicate 
with a host system for remote/ automated monitoring. The 
signal loss and power received have been calculated at 
different distances by using (4) and (5). We are procuring the 
portable RF power meter from Keithley (Model 3500) for 
measurement of actual power loss. 
The signal loss is given by-  
L (dB) = -20 log 10 (λ/ 4Πd).                                         (4) 
where – L = signal loss in free space (dB) and d = distance 
(meters) 
The power received at receiver is given by- 
Pr= (Pt Gr Gt  λ2) / ((4Π )2 d2 L)                               (5) 
where – Pt = transmitted power = 100mW and Gr & Gt = 
antenna gain at receiver and transmitter = 2.1dB. 
D. Distance measurement 
For testing of information loss at different places two 
wireless modules are used. One module is connected to the 
system through RS232 port placed in a test room and another 
wireless module is connected with a laptop to check the loss 
at different places. To calculate line of sight distances 
between two places, help has been taken from Google Earth. 
Google Earth maps the Earth by superimposition of images 
obtained from satellite imagery, aerial photography and GIS 
3D globe which can be downloaded free. It provides facility 
to calculate distance between two selected objects under the 
Tool option by selecting the ruler. Thus we have located our 
CEERI office area at Pilani, Rajasthan through Google Earth 
and then calculated approximate distance in meters between 
two locations in outdoor ranges. For indoor ranges the 
distance between two rooms are calculated approximately 
using Pythagoras theorem on first floor and ground floor.

SYSTEM SOFTWARE 
The embedded software to operate the wireless multi-
sensor system is implemented. Subroutine modules for 
sensor signal digitization, motor control, LCD, keypad, 
wireless data acquisition and transmission & field tracking 
algorithm are developed in C language and compiled with 
MP-LAB C18 cross compiler. The hex file is then ported to 
the flash memory of the PIC18F452 using PIC programmer. 
The operation of the software for multi-sensor embedded 
system is shown in the flowchart in figure 4. 
V. 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
Figure 5 shows the experimental setup for testing of the 
developed system. The developed module is interfaced with 
temperature sensors through transmitters giving 4 to 20mA 
current outputs. The wireless module is connected through 
RS232 interface. The device is programmed using MPLAB 
IDE programmer. Figure 6 shows the results of the 
temperature measurement conducted by keeping the 
temperature sensors in the environmental chamber where 
programmable temperature setting is done for specified 
temperature. The temperature measurement results are 
verified and found to be +/- 1% as tabulated in table I over a 
span of 100 to 120oC. The variation of calculated signal loss 
and received power against distance for testing wireless 
modules are shown in figure 7 and figure 8 measured at 
various aerial distances with different baud rates.  
The RH is calculated from measured dry and wet bulb 
temperatures and the (1) - (3), and is compared with the 
expected value from the psychometric chart. The results are 
given in the following tables II, III and IV respectively. 
Since, wireless communication works by creating 
electromagnetic waves at a source and being able to pick up 
those electromagnetic waves at a particular destination [14]. 
During the propagation, some attenuation of the signal takes 
place due to properties of the transmission medium (air) and 
obstacles and power density decreases at receiving end. 
Figure 7 shows this attenuation as a function of the distance 
between the transmitter and receiver and figure 8 shows the 
power received at receiver end decreases with increasing the 
distance between transmitter and receiver locations. The 
information loss in wireless data communication using the 
ZIGBEE wireless modules is shown in table V and table VI 
at outdoor and indoor distance range with and without 
obstacles.

The developed multi-sensor embedded system is also 
tested on the mobile robotic platform in the field of an area 
5m x 5m. The system is tested with LM 335 and RTD 
temperature 
sensors 
for 
temperature 
and 
humidity 
measurement of soil in the farm over a wireless connectivity. 
The observed trajectory of the wireless robot in the tested 
field of 5mx5m area is as shown in figure 9. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
A development of the multi sensor embedded system for 
measuring up to eight sensor parameters optimized by 
appropriate algorithms with its various features are 
presented. The test results of the developed prototype system 
with RTD temperature sensors for temperature measurement 
over a wireless connectivity for various distances are 
presented. From the results it can be concluded that for better 
transmission of signals via wireless communication, the low 
frequency range along with low baud rate and line of sight 
range is required to minimize the signal loss. The developed 
system is cost effective, versatile, and based on generic 
platform. Currently, efforts are going on to increase 
measurements up to 16 sensors channels, which are suitable 
for most of our current applications like RO water 
purification Plant automation and Smart pond fish 
management system, where in up to 15 parameters are to be 
monitored. Also implementation of appropriate wireless 
reconfigurable sensor network for future perspective so as to 
make the developed embedded system more applicable in 
Agro based Industrial applications such as grain and fruit, 
storage, vegetable storage smart pond automation for fresh 
aquaculture and so on.

The developed multi-sensor embedded system on mobile 
robot is also successfully tested to monitor the soil 
parameters in the farm and transmit the data to the central 
system using wireless protocol for precision agriculture. 
Considering the high cost and complexity of number of 
wireless sensing network systems in agriculture, the 
proposed system is low power and cost effective with less 
number of sensors and wireless nodes. Although the 
experimental conditions were limited, but the preliminary 
results are promising and shows that the wireless multi-
sensing system can be utilized for farm application in 
precision agriculture.
