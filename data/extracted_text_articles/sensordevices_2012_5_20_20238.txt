Abstract— This paper reports the potentialities of the 
manganese 
oxide 
La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 
(LSMO) 
for 
the 
realization of uncooled thermal detectors. Close to room 
temperature, 
LSMO 
exhibits 
a 
metal-to-insulator 
transition, where a large change of electrical resistance 
versus temperature occurs. The tested sample is a 100 nm 
thick epitaxial LSMO thin film deposited on a SrTiO3 
buffered Si substrate. The optical responsivity and 
electrical noise were measured in a frequency range of 
1 Hz-100 kHz, thus enabling the estimation of specific 
detectivity.  It is shown that due to the very low 1/f noise 
level, in this epitaxial film deposited on silicon wafer, 
LSMO 
thermal 
detectors 
can 
exhibit 
competitive 
performances at room temperature. 
Keywords- Bolometer; manganite; thermal detector. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Uncooled infrared (IR) detectors have been studied in 
recent years due to a variety of applications such as 
thermal cameras, night vision cameras, thermal sensors, 
surveillance, etc. The IR detectors are generally sorted in 
two types: photon detectors and thermal detectors. The 
photon detectors have high signal to noise ratio and very 
fast response, but require generally a cooling system, 
which is heavy and expensive. In comparison with 
photon detectors, most of thermal detectors operate at 
room temperature, thus reducing the cost of operation. 
Even its response time is still larger than that of photon 
detectors, it has no limitation on the wavelength response 
band. Thus makes it possible to be used for hand-held 
infrared applications. 
Thermal detectors are based on three different 
approaches, 
namely, 
bolometers, pyroelectric and 
thermoelectric effects. Uncooled microbolometers take a 
large part of infrared imaging application business [1]. A 
bolometer is a thermal detector whose electrical 
resistance R changes as a function of radiant energy. So, 
the larger the resistance changes, the higher the 
Temperature Coefficient of Resistance (β=1/R×dR/dT 
expressed in K−1), and the higher the responsivity. Many 
materials such as metals (Au, Pt, Ti, etc.) [2][3], and 
semiconductors (VOx, amorphous silicon, etc.) [4][5] 
have been used as thermometer in uncooled bolometers.  
The rare earth manganese oxides may find important 
applications such as magnetic random access memories 
and magnetic sensors [6][7]. It has been realized that 
these materials have a promising potential for bolometric 
infrared detection [8][9]. The large change of their 
electrical resistance R at the metal-to-insulator transition, 
which takes place in the 300-350 K range, makes them 
potential materials for the fabrication of uncooled 
thermal detectors. Ideal materials would present, at the 
desired operating temperature T close to 300 K, a high β 
and a low noise level.  
Even if it does not exhibit the highest β values at 
room temperature, compared to other possible manganite 
compositions, we study La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) because 
it shows low 1/f noise and no excess noise at the metal-
to-insulator transition [9]-[15]. In addition, we use a good 
quality LSMO films deposited on silicon substrates, 
which 
enables 
the 
compatibility 
with 
silicon 
microelectronic 
fabrication 
process 
and 
possible 
development of more complex systems. 
In section II we will describe the sample fabrication 
details together with the measurement setup. The third 
section is dedicated to the theoretical principle of 
operation of bolometer, and to the definitions of figures 
of merits. Then, in the fourth section, we will show 
detailed electrical and optical characterizations of the 
tested sample, with comparison to other uncooled 
bolometers. Finally, a conclusion section is devoted to 
show the potentialities of LSMO/STO/Si thin films as 
promising uncooled thermal detector.

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS 
A.  Sample preparation  
The sample consists in a 100 nm thick epitaxial LSMO 
thin film deposited on SrTiO3 (20 nm thick) buffered Si 
(001) substrates by reactive molecular beam epitaxy [16]. 
After gold deposition, the film was patterned using 
standard UV photolithography and argon ion milling. 
Ultrasonic bonding was used to connect the gold contacts 
to the sample holder.  
Our sample, shown in Fig. 1, has a meander line 
shape with the overall pixel dimension of 150×230 µm². 
The meander line width is 50 µm. The meander filling 
factor (defined as the ratio of the area occupied by the 
LSMO meander to the device nominal area) is equal to 
91%. 
B. Measurement setup 
A semiconductor laser diode (635 nm, 5 mW) 
electronically modulated at different frequencies was 
used to optically heat the device. The laser beam was 
collimated and passed through a 1:1 beam splitter with 
one beam incident on a photodiode and the other incident 
on the studied sample. Thus, by knowing the 
transmission coefficient of all optical elements, the 
power of the incident light on the sample can be directly 
obtained by measuring the photodiode output signal. The 
laser diode spot has an elliptical shape, with dimensions 
of 128 µm × 186 µm estimated at Full Width Half 
Maximum.  
The sample was glued to a copper plate, having a 
heating element, then fixed into a vacuum chamber 
equipped with an optical window. The chamber is 
evacuated by a mechanical pump, and no cooling system 
was used. A temperature controller was used to maintain 
temperature stability of 15 mK during measurements at 
fixed temperature. The controller, also, provides the 
possibility of heating the sample in the range 300-350 K.  
The LSMO sample was current biased using a quasi-
ideal DC current source, which exhibits very high output 
impedance and a negligible noise contribution [17]. A 
standard four-probe technique was used to provide bias 
current and measure the voltage signal of the LSMO 
sample. The output voltage of the sample was read out by 
a homemade voltage amplifier. The dynamic optical 
response and electrical noise measurements were carried 
out using a spectrum analyser (HP3562A). The 
measurement setup is equipped with personal computer 
with GPIB interface to read and store the measured 
values. 
III. 
BOLOMETER BACKGROUND  
A. Principle of operation 
When the bolometer material absorbs an amount Q of 
radiated power from a light source, a temperature change 
∆T occurs: ∆T=ηQ/Geff, where Geff is the effective 
thermal conductance of bolometer material (expressed in  
 
Figure 1.  (A) Optical photography of the tested sample with the two 
current probes [I+, I-] and two voltage probes [V+, V-]. (B) Schematic 
cross-section of the sample. 
W·Κ−1), 
and 
η 
is 
the 
absorption 
coefficient 
(dimensionless). Geff is related to the self-heating effect 
and given by the relation: Geff=G−Ib²×(dR/dT), where G 
is the geometrical thermal conductance of the bolometer. 
The variation of the temperature causes a change in the 
electrical resistance R of the bolometer material: 
∆R=βR×∆Τ=βR×ηQ/Geff 
(1) 
So, when using a bias current Ib through such a 
bolometer, a voltage change can be measured:  
∆V= (Ιb β R η Q)/Geff 
(2) 
B. Figures of merit 
The performance of bolometers is expressed in terms 
of device figures of merit such as optical responsivity 
(ℜv), Noise Equivalent Power (NEP), specific detectivity 
(D*), and β [18].  
The optical responsivity (ℜv) of a bolometer is 
defined as the output voltage per radiated power when 
bias current Ib is applied to the bolometer device, and is 
written as: 
ℜω 
∆
∆ 
 

²

/ 

    V. W    (3) 
where τeff=C/Geff is the effective thermal time constant, 
and C is the thermal capacitance of the bolometer. 
The NEP (expressed in W·Hz-1/2) is defined as the 
incident power on a pixel that generates a signal-to-noise 
ratio equal to unity in a 1 Hz output bandwidth. The NEP 
of the bolometer is calculated as the ratio of the square 
root of the voltage noise spectral density (Sv
1/2) over the 
bolometer responsivity (ℜv).  
The D* (expressed in cm·Hz1/2·W-1) provides 
information that is equivalent to NEP, but with the 
possibility to compare bolometer pixels of different 
areas. It is calculated as the ratio of the square root of 
effective surface of bolometer (expressed in cm²) over 
the NEP.

Another important figure of merit is the impulse 
detectivity [19], which is defined as D*/τeff
1/2 (expressed 
in cm·J-1). This parameter illustrates the necessary 
compromise between optical responsivity and effective 
time thermal constant. 
IV. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
A. Electrical characteristics 
The electrical resistance versus temperature (R-T) 
data of the LSMO sample was measured using a standard 
four-point technique. Then the R-T data were fitted with 
a smooth equation and then the dR/dT and β data were 
calculated and plotted as seen in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. The 
maximum β value obtained is 2.7×10−2 Κ−1, which is a 
typical value for the LSMO material [10][11]. We can 
estimate the electrical resistivity of about 2.4×10−5 Ω·m 
at 300 K, which is close to literature value for this 
material [20]. 
 The R-T plot presents a non linear shape. So, in 
order to get maximum responsivity, the sample should be 
characterised at a temperature where we have the 
maximum of dR/dT (Fig. 3). The maximum dR/dT value 
equals 85 Ω·K-1 at 318 K, so the sample will be optically 
characterised at this temperature (and not at the 
temperature where β is maximal). 
B. Optical responsivity 
In order to identify whether the optical responsivity is 
bolometric (thermal), we have compared it with dR/dT as 
a function of the temperature (Fig. 3). It is found that the 
dependence of optical responsivity (ℜv) at 1 Hz on the 
temperature follows well the variation of dR/dT versus 
temperature, and they reach a maximum value at the 
same temperature 318K. This suggests that the major 
component of the response at 1 Hz is bolometric.  
C. Dynamic characterisations 
Figure 4 shows the dependence of the optical 
responsivity as a function of the laser power modulation 
frequency for different bias currents. We have an optical 
responsivity of 0.65 V·W-1 at 1 Hz for the bias current 
equals to 400 µA.  
 
Figure 2.  Sample’s electrical resistance and β versus temperature 
 
Figure 3.  Optical responsivity ℜv at bias current 400 µA and 
frequency 1 Hz and dR/dT versus temperature curves. 
Three different behaviours can be observed in Fig. 4. 
From 1 Hz up to the cut-off frequency (around 1 kHz), 
the optical responsivity is almost constant, whatever is 
the value of Ib. In the 1-10 kHz decade, we observe a 
low-pass behaviour and then an increasing of the optical 
responsivity as function of frequency. Equation (3) can 
be used to identify the plateau and the low pass filtering. 
Inset of Fig. 4 shows that the optical responsivity 
increases linearly with increasing the bias current, 
according to (3). 
We do not observe a constant plateau in our 
experiment. One possible explanation could be the heat 
diffusion across the substrate. The increasing optical 
responsivity at higher frequencies (more than 1 kHz) 
could be related to the contribution of photo-induced 
effects in LSMO or in the LSMO/STO/Si heterostructure 
[8][21]. Further studies are in progress to characterize 
this non-bolometric component. 
An optical step of incident power light was applied at 
the sample, and then the output voltage time-response of 
sample was measured. Thus, we can extract the effective 
thermal time constant τeff of the sample by using the 
fitting of sample’s time-response as a first order system. 
We found that τeff is of the order of 180 µs, which is 
consistent with the measured cut-off frequency (Fig. 4). 
This effective thermal time constant is quite short for a 
thin film bolometers [8][21][22].

Figure 5.  Noise spectral density measured in the four probe 
configuration at different bias currents at 318K.  
We can also estimate G = 47×10-3 W·K-1 by using (3) 
in the pass-band frequencies, and using the value of 
absorption η=85% from earlier measurements on this 
material [9][20]. We found that Geff = G at bias current 
equals 400 µA. By knowing the thermal time constant 
and the thermal conductance, we can estimate the 
thermal capacitance of our sample C=8.5×10-6 J·K-1.  
D. Noise, NEP and D* 
The voltage noise spectral density (Sv) of the sample 
was measured using the four-probe configuration for 
different values of the bias current at 318 K, as shown in 
Fig. 5.  
As expected, the white noise level does not depend on 
the bias current and the 1/f noise increases with bias 
current. Measurement results give a value of Sv equals to 
4.4×10−15 V2·Hz-1 at 30 Hz, for bias current equals to 400 
µA. Using the value of the optical responsivity, we can 
estimate the value of NEP and D*. The measured NEP 
and D* value at 318 K, 400 µA and 30 Hz, are 1.1×10−7 
W·Hz−1/2 and 1.7×105 cm·Hz1/2·W-1 respectively.  
Table I presents a comparison with other manganite 
material bolometer [23]. We notice that our sample 
present better optical responsivity at the same bias 
current (1.95 V·W-1 at 1.2 mA, using (3)) even it has a 
smaller surface. So, in terms of optical responsivity, 
LSMO bolometer presents a better performance than 
LPSMO. Also, even if our sample has smaller D*, it 
presents a smaller effective time constant (τeff). So, in 
terms of impulse detectivity, which includes both 
parameters, our sample achieves same value as that of 
[23], but with a decrease of about 4 factor in Joule 
heating. 
The summary of results of the tested bolometer, with 
comparison of other uncooled bolometers, is shown in 
Table II. We can note that the D* of our sample is still 
limited compared to these bolometer materials, like Poly-
SiGe [24] and VOx [25], but our sample present better 
time response. It is also still limited in terms of impulse 
detectivity. This is mainly related to the fact that other 
bolometers used suspended structures, which decrease 
the thermal conductance (about 10-7 W·K-1), thus 
enhancing the specific detectivity by about 4 orders of 
magnitude. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, the potentialities of LSMO thin films as 
thermal detector at room temperature have been reported. 
We have fabricated and characterized the LSMO/STO/Si 
sample at an operating temperature of 318 K. The sample 
showed high β (24×10-3 K-1) and low electrical noise. 
The sample presents a very good quality LSMO film 
deposited on Si substrate. This proves the compatibility 
with silicon microelectronic fabrication process, and 
gives the opportunity to the integration of LSMO as 
uncooled thermal detector with the readout electronics. 
Figures of merits of bolometer have been measured 
and analyzed. It showed that due to a thermal 
conductance of 47×10-3 W·K-1, the device performance is 
limited to a D* of 1.7×105 cm·Hz1/2·W−1 at 30 Hz and 
400 µA. Though, a small effective thermal time constant 
of 180µs was measured.  
Further studies are in progress to optimize the 
geometrical parameters of the sample, like size and 
number of lines in the meander, and on different 
substrates in order to achieve maximal performance of 
this promising material as thermal detector.
