Abstract—This paper considers the problem of minimizing
power consumption of the base station in the downlink of the
multi-user OFDM cellular network, characterized by frequency
selective transmission channel. The channel gain is variable and
speciﬁc for each user. In this case, the resources allocation must
be determined so that the total power consumption is as low as
possible. To solve this problem, we proposed an implementation
ofsome genetic algorithms and we obtained a better solution than
currently applied well-known methods.

INTRODUCTION
The second and third generation of cellular network are
characterized by single carrier transmission. For each user, one
subcarrier is used during the communication that often causes
lost of signal in the context of channel frequency selective.
However, in 4G cellular systems [13], the multi-carrier trans-
mission’s technique OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division
Multiplexing) [24] is used in order to ﬁght against multipath
phenomena and to provide a signiﬁcant throughput to users.
In the OFDM transmission technique, the total available band-
width is split into many narrow bands subchannels at equidis-
tant frequencies [21]. Each subchannel has approximately a
constant channel gain and the bit loading can be adjusted
according to the level of the channel gain.
The orthogonality of the subcarriers permits to reduce the
width of the transmission subchannels; thereby, increases the
spectral efﬁciency. The high number of the subcarriers makes
possible to perform a more effective management, by adapting
the subcarriers allocation according to the channel gain of the
users [22].
In the context of frequency selective channel, where the
channel gain is variable and speciﬁc for each user, the optimal
resources allocation is an optimization problem. The adaptive
resources allocation is a proposed method to improve the
performance of cellular systems. The adaptive allocation can
give 20dB of Signal-to-Noise-Ration in contrast to random
allocation [2].
In multi-users OFDM cellular systems, the resources al-
location consists in solving an optimization problem with
constraint. It takes the channel estimated characteristics. In
practice, the channel gain is given by receiver in logic channel
CQIH (Channel Quality Indicator Channel) [8]. Note that,
this optimization problem is highly nonlinear; therefore, it
is unlikely that the algorithm with polynomial complexity be
used [15].
Thus, several algorithms are developed for solving the
resources allocation problem. The water-ﬁlling algorithm pro-
posed by Tu et al. [23] proved to be optimal for solving
the power-minimizing problem in the single-user case. Im-
provements have been introduced by Qi et al. [3], and Munz
et al. [6], in order to reduce complexity of the water-ﬁlling
algorithm. The Greedy algorithm proved to be optimal to solve
the bit loading algorithm in single-user case [12]. However,
the problem of resources allocation becomes very complex
in multi-user OFDM systems. Wong et al. [4] proposed a
suboptimal method to allocate subcarriers, but the method
requires iterative process and the foreknown required number
of subcarriers allocated to users [9]. Kim et al. [14] converted
the non-linear optimization problem into a linear one with
integer variables. The optimal solution can be achieved by
integer programming (IP), but its computation is still very huge
[9].
In this context, the evolutionary approach inspired by
natural phenomena are introduced to improve the resources
allocation [7]. Among this methods, we propose in this paper
to solve the optimization problem with GAs (Genetic Algo-
rithms). The main objective of this work is to propose an
implementation of some GAs in order to have better results.
In Section 2, the related work about resources allocation
is described. In Section 3, the modeling system and the
formulation of the optimization problem are presented. In
Section 4, the principle of genetic algorithms is given and
in Section 5, the proposed algorithm is described. Finally, in
Section 6, we compare the results of the proposed algorithm
to others algorithms.

RELATED WORK
Genetic algorithms belong to the family of evolutionary
algorithms inspired by biology. It is ﬁrst introduced by H.
Holand [11] and implemented by D. Goldberg [7] for solving
optimization problems. Since the GAs is an effective search
technique, it has been applied to wireless communications
recently [1][5][20][17].
Most of the work based on the genetic algorithms use the
same procedure. However, the difference lies in the imple-
mentation and the method of GAs’s operators. In the work
proposed by Zhu et al. [18], the natural selection’s method
is used, while it accelerates the algorithm but not ensure

converging towards the global optimum [16]. In this paper,
we used the method of selection by tournament, that keeps
diversity of the population during the process and allows a
better exploration of the search domain [10].
In many proposed implementation, the constraint of the
optimization problem is considered in the evaluation of the
ﬁtness (objective function) of individual. This can deplete the
population and limits the exploration of the search domain.
In our proposed implementation, the ﬁtness is only based on
the power according to equation (4). To meet the constraints
of the optimization problem, we deﬁned the function named
adjust allocation so as to balance the throughput of users.

SYSTEM MODELING AND FORMULATION OF THE
PROBLEM
A. System modeling
We consider an OFDM multiple access system, in which
the characteristics of transmission channel are assumed known
by the transmitter and the receiver. The channel is assumed to
be linear and stationary, with additive white gaussian noise of
zero mean. It is decomposed into N ﬂat subchannels and each
of which is characterized by a constant gain, speciﬁc for the
nth subcarrier and the kth user.
The transmission channel is frequency selective, and we
assume that the users are in micro-mobility; therefore, the
Doppler effect is ignored. We note that, there are no inter-
symbol interferences, since subcarrier is allocated to a single
user. We consider the mono cellular system. The number of
users and subcarriers is constant during the GAs process.
B. Formulation of the problem
The channel of transmission is frequency selective. It can
be considered as a ﬁlter, characterized by the transfer function
varying with frequencies and of each user. The magnitude of
the transfer function corresponds to the gain of the transmis-
sion channel.
Let Hk,n the channel gain of the kth user on the nth
subcarrier. The required power is given by Proakis [19]:
pk,n = f(ck,n)
H2
k,n
(1)
where
f(ck,n) = N0
3 (2ck,n − 1)[Q−1(BERk
4
)]2
(2)
ck,n is the number of bits for the kth user on the nth
subcarrier. N0 is the power spectral density of the noise.
BERk is the bits error rate of the kth user. Q(x) = erfc(x)
is the complementary error function.
Note that, when the channel gain Hk,n increases, the power
required decreases. Thus, the nth subcarrier will be allocated
in preference to the kth user having the smallest power to
achieve the required throughput. As the number of subcarriers
is high, it is not necessary that many users share the same
subcarrier (Time Division Mutliplexing). In addition, the inter-
symbol interferences can be avoided when one subcarrier is
exclusively allocated to one user.
Let ρk,n the allocation factor of the nth subcarrier to the
kth user deﬁned by:
ρk,n =

1
if the nth subcarrier is allocated to the kth user
0
else
(3)
The total power allocated to the kth user is given by:
Pk =
N
X
n=1
pk,n.ρk,n =
N
X
n=1
f(ck,n)
H2
k,n
.ρk,n
(4)
Thus, the total power allocated to all users is given by:
PT =
K
X
k=1
Pk =
K
X
k=1
N
X
n=1
f(ck,n)
H2
k,n
.ρk,n
(5)
The total bits for the kth user is given by:
rk =
N
X
n=1
ck,n.ρk,n
(6)
The equation (1) shows that the required power for the
kth user on the nth subcarrier is inversely proportional to the
channel gain Hk,n. Therefore, it is more efﬁcience to allocate
the nth subcarrier to the kth user which presents the smallest
channel gain Hk,n. Thereby, the power can be minimized while
the constraints of QoS are satisﬁed.
Thus, the problem of resources allocation can be written:
min(PT )
subject to
rk > r0
where r0 is the minimal rate for the kth user.
IV.
GENETIC ALGORITHMS
Genetic algorithms are inspired by Darwin’s theory of evo-
lution and by Mendel’s works about recombination of species
[16]. GAs are used to solve many problems of optimization.
Robustness is the main advantage of genetic algorithms
relative to traditional resolution methods of optimization pro-
blems [7]. In other words, we can see the four major diffe-
rences between the two methods:
1)
GAs work with a coding of the set of parameters,
while the classical methods use directly the parame-
ters.
2)
The solution given by GAs is a set of points (chro-
mosomes) and the solution for a classical methods is
a single point.
3)
GAs use the objective function and the standards
methods often use derivatives of function or other
auxiliary knowledge.
4)
Gas use probabilistic transition rules when the tradi-
tional methods use deterministic rules.
The principle of GAs is based on the evolution of an initial
population under the effect of operators such as selection,
mutation and crossover. At the end of the GAs’s process, the
best individual in the population will be the solution of the
optimization problem.

The different phases of the GAs are:
•
Coding of chromosome
A chromosome of the population represents a resource
allocation scheme. The coding of the chromosome is
to provide a structure corresponding to the resource al-
location problem. In our implementation, chromosome
is represented by an array of structure, containing a
ﬁxed number of subcarriers, numbered in increasing
order, from 0 to N − 1. In the nth cell, there are
the index of the user to which the corresponding
subcarrier is allocated. The required power and the
quantity of bits are calculated from this allocation for
every user. All chromosomes have the same ﬁxed size
which corresponds to the total number of subcarriers.
The following table shows an example of the structure
of the chromosomes .

•
Initialization of the population
It consists to set the size of the population and
to generate all chromosomes of the population. In
this work, the chromosomes of the population are
randomly generated and their size is the same and
stays constant during the GAs process.
•
Evaluation
In this function, the total required power and the
total throughput are calculated for each chromosome.
The required power corresponds to a ﬁtness (objective
function) of the chromosome. The ﬁtness or the objec-
tive function represents the criterion of the selection
of chromosomes.
•
Selection
After evaluating the power of all chromosomes, the
selection consists to retain the best chromosome by di-
rectly sorting (natural selection) or by organizing tour-
nament between two chromosomes arbitrary selected
(selection by tournament). The best chromosome of
the population is the one that the requires power is the
smallest while respecting the constraint of throughput.
•
Mutation
It consists to bring changes to the resources allocation
scheme in order to have a better exploration of the
search domain. In this work, the number of mutations
and the index of the mutated subcarrier are randomly
determined for each chromosome. Note that, all chro-
mosomes will not be affected by the mutation.
•
Crossover
In this step, a new chromosome is created from two
chromosomes in order to take advantages of their
best characters. Two points of crossover are randomly
chosen and two parts of the ﬁrst chromosome are
concatenated with one part of the second chromosome.
So, a new chromosome is created from this concate-
nation.

Step 8: Adjust allocation
In this step, the best allocation scheme resulting from the
GAs process, is adjusted in order to achieve the throughput
constraint. In this paper, the throughput constraint is not
considered in the calculation of the objective function. Here,
the proposed solution of the genetic algorihms is only based
on the criterion of the power and requires to be eventually
adjusted.

C. Analysis of results
The study of the evolution of the power, according to
the number of generations (Figure 2), shows that the power
remains relatively constant from the 80th generation and the
corresponding resources allocation scheme is the solution of
the optimization. Figure 4 shows some problems of conver-
gence of the proposed algorithm; however, the total power
decreases when the size of population increases. We also note
that the result is better with large population size. The GAs that
we implemented, gives better results than baseline algorithms
met in the literature. The Tables II and III above, compare the
consumption of the power for different numbers of users of the
algorithm proposed in this work to the algorithms developed
by Ahmadi et al. [1] and by Reddy et al. [20].

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we have implemented the genetic algorithms
to solve the problem of resources allocation in a frequency
selective transmission channel. The implementation of the
GAs that we proposed is characterized by the function named
adjusted allocation which permits to balance the resources
allocation scheme of the obtained solution. The implementa-
tion of the proposed GAs in this paper gives better result than
the algorithm proposed by Ahmadi et al. [1] and the algorithm
proposed by Reddy et al. [20]. We have implemented the
proposed GAs in this paper in C language, which gives us
a good modeling. We hope that the execution of our model
will be faster than others tools as Matlab or Scilab. In future
works, we will try to improve the convergence of the proposed
GAs.
