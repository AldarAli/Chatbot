Abstract—We present a methodology and the results of numerical
simulations of complex biological polymeric molecular nanos-
tructures, whose major components consist of ribonucleic acids
(RNAs). The case where such nanostructures are considered in
ﬂuids, e.g. physiological solutions, is also reported. The developed
methodology is based on molecular dynamics and our efﬁcient
coarse graining algorithms applied to such structures. We discuss
such important characteristics as the radius of gyration, root
mean square deviation, and radial distribution function in the
application to RNA nanotubes, consisting of a number nanorings,
studied in the previous works. Among other things, we provide
insight into typical distributions of various ions around the RNA
nanotubes as a function of time within a distance of a few
angstroms from their surface.

INTRODUCTION
Modelling complex systems such as biological polymers is
necessarily closely connected with advanced high performance
computing. The task is becoming even more challenging
when biological polymeric nanostructures are considered. Such
structures have a range of current and potential therapeutic and
other biomedical applications [1]. By now we know that the
stability of the ribonucleic acid (RNA) assemblies is higher
than that of the DNA self assembled nanoparticles in ﬂuidic
solutions [2], [3], and that different shape RNA molecules are
available to form RNA building blocks and their complexes
with other biomolecules [4], [5], [6]. Here our main focus
is on such RNA nanostructures constructed with six helical
building blocks of either one or two types (RNAI/RNAII).
They consist of a number of nanorings linked together via
base pairing hydrogen bonds, forming RNA nanotubes which
may operate in the applications mentioned above in ﬂuidic
physiological solutions.

COMPUTATIONAL MODELS, METHODOLOGY, AND
MAIN RESULTS
Given the computational complexity of the problem at
hand and its multiscale character, it is necessary to develop
efﬁcient coarse-graining procedures for molecular dynamics
simulations of these structures [7]. To do that, we use the
Boltzmann inversion method. The force matching is based on
the objective function of the parameter α:
Z(α) = ZF (α) + Zc(α),

ZF (α) =

|Fki(α) − F 0
ki|2,
(2)
ZC(α) =
NC

r=1
Wr|Ar(α) − A0
r|2.
(3)
The parameters α deﬁned in the above equations (1) -(3)
are calculated by matching the forces obtained by using the
ﬁrst-principles calculations of the several conﬁgurations of the
molecular system and the classical potentials. Notations in (1)
- (3) are as follows: the integer M in ZF (the force objective
function) is the number of conﬁgurations, Nk is the number
of atoms in the k-th conﬁguration and Fki(α) is the force on
the ith atom in the kth conﬁguration which is obtained from
the parametrization of α, and the F 0
ki is the corresponding
reference force obtained from the ﬁrst principles calculations.
In the constraint objective function ZC the quantities Ar(α)
are also physical parameters obtained from parametrization,
A0
r are experimental values or the values calculated from the
ﬁrst principles methods and Wr is the weight factor. The
force objective function deﬁned in equation (1) is minimized
for given α to calculate the classical force parameters by
using the force and physical quantities obtained from ab initio
calculations.
The entire system is integrated in time where the potential
uses the CHARMM force ﬁeld. The compatibility of this force
ﬁeld for this type of biological system was tested earlier [8],
[9], demonstrating that the results are close to experiments.
We have performed all-atom molecular dynamics simu-
lations of RNA nanotubes by using the CHARMM27 force
ﬁeld implemented in the NAMD package as it was done
for the nanoring [10], [11]. The modeling of the nanotube,
visualization and the analysis of the simulation outputs have
been performed using the software visual molecular dynamics
(VMD).
The RNA-nanotube was solvated in a water box where the
distance from the surface of the nanocluster to the wall is
slightly larger than the cut off radius used in the molecular
dynamics simulation. In order to make the system neutral we
have added ions, depending on the size of the nanotube (e.g.,
for a 4-ring nanotube we had 1254 ions). The resulting system
has been ﬁrst simulated at constant temperature and pressure
using the NAMD software package. The temperature in the
system has been controlled by using Langevin’s method with

Figure 1. Three-dimensional structure on 8-ring nanotube modeled by using VMD
damping η = 5 ps−1. For adding chemical bonds between
the segments in the nanoclusters we have used the topotools
available in the VMD. A typical RNA nanotube is shown in
the ﬁgure above, where 8 nanorings were used (we modeled
currently up to 20). The tails used to connect the RNA
nanorings are the double strand RNAs with the length of 22
nucleotides. The chemical bonds between the ring and the
links are mediated through the phosphorous of the phosphate
group in the ring and the oxygen in the sugar ring of the
corresponding link or vice versa. Using NAMD, we optimized
the chemical bonds added between different segments of the
RNA nanoclusters. We analyzed the obtained results for the
variation of the energy and temperature as a function of
simulation time, as well as the number of ions around the RNA
nanotube within the distance of 5 ˚A at different temperatures,
the number of bonds per basepairs, the radius of gyration and
the root mean square deviation (RMSD) at two temperatures,
310K and 510K. The results corresponding to variations of
the parameters are similar to the results obtained for the other
nanoclusters described in our earlier studies [10], [11]. The
radial distribution functions have been calculated for our RNA
nanotubes for phosphorous-phosphorous, phosphorous-water,
phosphorous-sodium and phosphorous-chlorine. For example,
from the P-P RDF analysis, we have concluded that there
are three well-pronounced peaks around the same positions
at it was observed for other nanoclusters studied in our earlier
paper [11]. These peaks actually show the ﬁrst, second and
third nearest neighbours of the phosphorous atom respectively.
Similar analyses were carried out for other RDFs (e.g., P-OH2,
etc). The results for larger RNA nanotubes have shown that
the nature of solvation and the ionic distribution during the
molecular dynamics simulation is similar to those found in the
case of the smaller nanotubes (e.g., we studied earlier 3- and
4- ring nanotubes). Finally, it is worthwhile mentioning that
the phenomenon of self stabilization, ﬁrst reported in [10], has
also been observed in this case.

CONCLUSION
Complex RNA-based biological nanostructures have been
analyzed with molecular dynamics simulations based on the
developed coarse-graining procedures. Main characteristics,
such as the root mean square deviation, radius of gyration,
number of hydrogen bonds per basepair, ion accumulation
around the tube, and the radial distribution functions, have
been calculated. The results may be useful for the develop-
ment of new drug delivery procedures, scaffolding, and other
biomedical applications.
