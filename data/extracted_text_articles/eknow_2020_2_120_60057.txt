Abstract— Electricity usage prediction is important for 
planning and facility expansion in the industrial sector. 
Accurate prediction can save the operation and maintenance 
costs, increased the reliability of power supply and delivery 
system for future development. This paper is to compare various 
Exponential 
Smoothing 
models 
(Simple 
Exponential 
Smoothing, Holt Linear Trend, Holt Linear Damped Trend and 
Holt-Winters) and ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving 
Average) model in an attempt to predict the daily electricity 
usage in the industry in the production of Hammer and Pellet 
with high accuracy. The data used is from 30 September 2019 to 
06 November 2019, which consist of only 39 observations after 
excluding the non-production day. These models are precise and 
modelled well when the time series data is in a short period and 
in short period forecasting. Accuracy level of each model is 
measured by comparing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) 
of forecasting value with the actual value. Based on the 
comparison result, the best model with the smallest RMSE value 
is given by Holt Linear Trend for the electricity usage for the 
production of Hammer (in Mill 1 and Mill 2) and the production 
of Pellet (in Mill 1). In the data of the electricity usage for the 
production of Pellet (in Mill 2), the smallest RMSE value is given 
by Holt Linear Damped Trend. To improve the training and 
forecasting speed, we adopt Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) 
acceleration 
through 
RAPIDS 
Artificial 
Intelligence 
framework.

 INTRODUCTION  
An increase in the consumption of domestic electrical 
current will cause higher utility costs. An accurate prediction 
of the future electricity usage in short-run and long-run may 
help the manufacturing industries and private investors to 
maximize their return and minimize the operation expenses 
[1][2]. Forecasting of electricity usage also helps the industry 
to plan and control on the future power system. Building an 
accurate and reliable forecasting model for electricity usage 
may provide valuable information for electricity system 
operators to formulate policies and plans for electricity [3]. 
Therefore, forecasting of electricity usage has become urgent 
and important for an industry [4]-[6]. 
Many researchers proposed different kinds of forecast 
models to predict the electricity usage in recent decades. The 
methods could be completely categorized into three groups: 
statistical analysis models, artificial intelligence models and 
grey forecasting models. Examples of the popular statistical 
analysis models include regression [16], logistic regression 
[6], simple Exponential Smoothing model [17][18], Holt-
Winters model [19], univariate time series model [9][20], state 
space model [21], Kalman filter model [3] and Markov chain 
model [22]. However, statistical analysis models have some 
limitations, one of that is statistical models usually require that 
the sample data fulfil some statistical assumptions, such as 
normality assumption, thus limiting it practical application.  
Artificial intelligence models such as artificial neural 
network [23][24], support vector machine regression [25][26] 
and deep neural networks [27] become popular in electricity 
consumption prediction. However, the prediction precision 
obtained from these models is totally rely on the number of 
the training sample data [4][28][29], which may not be applied 
in electricity usage data when the sample size is small.  
There are different forecasting approaches including trend 
and seasonality and several comparative studies in the 
electricity consumption in the literature. Al-Ghandoor et al. 
[30] presented the electricity consumption of the Jordanian 
industrial sector based on multivariate linear regression. In the 
study, they found that industrial production outputs and 
capacity utilization are the two important reasons that affect 
demand 
on 
electrical 
power.

There are many factors affecting the prediction accuracy 
of electricity consumption, such as economic condition [7], 
power facilities [8], population growth [9], weather conditions 
[10][11], festival season [12] and political influences [13].  
Thus, forecasting on the electricity usage become challenges 
as the data often presents to be strongly nonlinear, random, 
more volatile and irregular [14].  It is due to the average 
yearly growth factor of electricity usage fluctuation.  Also, the 
demand of it can change significantly in space and time related 
to different areas. Therefore, the long-run prediction of 
electricity usage may be impractical. The accuracy of the 
prediction in short-run can be improved by select a forecasting 
model that performs well with a relatively small sample size 
[14]. Apart from that, it has been found that making full use 
of more recent data which is closer to the forecast period is 
able to enhance the prediction performance [15].

Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) to 
estimate and predict the Turkish electricity demand. Taylor 
[32] found that Exponential Smoothing method is more 
reliable and appropriate for short period forecasting on electric 
consumption. Kavanagh [36] proposed double seasonal 
Exponential Smoothing variation of the Holt-Winters method 
to predict the short-term electricity loads for half hourly lead 
times for a day ahead.  
The objective of this project is to compare various 
statistical approaches to forecast the electricity consumption 
of a factory. Such comparisons are crucial for the stake holder 
of the factory to factor in their operation cost in order to 
maximize production output and minimize production cost. 
The novelty of this work is to compare various statistical 
models to investigate the accuracy versus performance of 
these techniques especially with GPU acceleration. In order to 
achieve objectively compare the accuracy between the 
models, external factors such as weather and economic 
conditions will not be included in this study. This work is a 
subcomponent to our meta-predictor where accuracy and 
performance are important factors for the meta-predictor to 
autonomously select and combine predictions from multiple 
models.    
In this paper, we proposed to use variety of linear models 
to find the best fitting to predict the future electricity 
consumption. The linear models that studied in this paper are 
Simple Exponential Smoothing model, Holt’s Linear model, 
Holt’s Linear Damped Trend model, Holt-Winters model, and 
ARIMA 
models. 
Electrical 
consumption 
forecasting 
classified into three categories: short period, medium period 
and long period. In this study, we focus on 5 working days; 
that is short term load forecasting. The data is collected from 
life current sensor transmitted to the cloud hosted for forecast 
processing. The training and forecasting are accelerated 
through GPU to achieve better speed performance with 
similar accuracy. 
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, it provides 
a review of methodology related works.  In Section III, it 
briefly discusses experiments and performance results.  
Finally, Section IV concludes and discusses future work.

MEHTODOLOGY 
A. Methods 
We presented in here five approaches for forecasting the 
electricity consumption. Techniques chosen for this study are 
Simple Exponential Smoothing model, Holt’s Linear model, 
Holt’s Linear Damped Trend model, Holt-Winters Additive 
model, and ARIMA model. The details of the methods are 
discussed as following: 
1) Simple Exponential Smoothing (ES) model 
Exponential Smoothing (ES) is one of the generally used 
methods to discover the short-term dramatic changes in time 
series based on its past values. ES model is simple to estimate 
as it only requires a single parameter, which is the smoothing 
called as smoothing coefficient. Second, this model required 
less computational time and small data storage. The simple ES 
can be represented by the following equations: 
 
                    
, 
(1) 
 
                                  
,   
(2)
 
 
where 
 is the level at time t, 
 is the smoothing constant 
and 
.  
2) Holt’s Linear (HL) Model   
Double ES is an extension to simple ES as the simple’ ES 
approach does not fit well in the data when there is a trend. 
The double ES model is formed by two equations: 
 
 
   
,
 
(3) 
 
 
   
, 
  
(4) 
where 
 is the level at time t, 
 is the weight for the 
level, 
 is the trend at time t,  is the weight for the trend, 
 is the data value at time t. The one-step-ahead forecast at 
time t is given as 
 
                     
      
(5) 
Holt’s Linear Trend (HLT) is a special case of double ES 
model with the forecast equation is given as 
 
                                  
 
(6) 
where h is the h-step-ahead forecast. However, when the data 
is with trend and seasonal, HLT may not be performed well, 
so HLT approach was extended to Holt-Winters method, 
which can help to measure strong trend patterns and seasonal 
pattern in the series. 
3) Holt’s Linear Damped Trend (HLDT) model 
Holt’s Linear Damped Trend (HLDT) includes a damping 
parameter, , where 
. The equation is given as  
 
 
               
 
(7)    
 
 
         
, 
  
(8) 
 
 
          
, 
  
(9) 
 
where 
 is the level at time t, 
 is the weight for the level, 
 is the trend at time t,  is the weight for the trend, 
 is 
the data value at time t, and 
 is the one-step-ahead forecast 
at time t. If 
, the method is identical to HLT method. 
The short term forecasts for HLDT method are trended while 
the long-term forecasts are constant.

4) Holt-Winters (HW) method 
The HW method, which is also called triple ES method, 
is a complex expansion of ES method and is used when there 
is trend and seasonality in the data set. HW additive method 
is chosen when the seasonal variations are roughly constant 
meanwhile HW multiplicative method is chosen when the 
seasonal variations are changing proportionally to the level 
of the data. This study will be applied only to the HW additive 
model: 
 
 
                       
  
(10) 
 
 
           
  
(11) 
 
 
                  
  
(12) 
 
 
                    
  
(13) 
where 
 is the smoothed estimate of the level at time t, 
 
is the smoothed estimate of the change in the trend value at 
time t, 
 is the smoothed estimate of the appropriate 
seasonal component at t, 
, 
 and 
 are the smoothing 
parameters and 
 is the number of seasons per year as in eq. 
(13).      
5) ARIMA Model 
The ARIMA model consists of autoregressive (AR) part, 
a differencing (I) part and Moving Average (MA) part. The 
ARIMA (p,d,q) model can be expressed in a very general 
form: 
 
  
   (13) 
where 
 is the backward operator, 
 is the constant term, 
 is the AR coefficient, d is the order of the differencing, 
 is the MA coefficient, where j = 1,2,…,q, 
 is the data 
value at time t, and 
 is the random noise, which 
follows normal distribution. In this model, 
, 
,…,
, 
 and 
, 
,…,
 are optimised by using maximum 
Likelihood Estimation (MLE) [37]. The best model is 
selected based on the Box-Jenkins methodology, which is 
composed of four main stages: model identification, 
parameter estimation, diagnostic checking and model 
application [37]. The stationary and invertibility conditions 
for the selected models should be fulfilled when fitting 
ARIMA model [38]. 
B. GPU Acceleration 
The training and forecasting process can be time 
consuming when the data size is large; GPU can be used to 
accelerate these processes. In this paper, we adopt the 
RAPIDS AI framework that provides a series of libraries to 
accelerate machine learning techniques through GPU.  These 
python based libraries use NVIDIA CUDA® primitives for 
low-level compute optimization.  It scrutinizes the data 
parallelism with adopting high-bandwidth memory.   Figure 
1 shows the high-level architecture of RAPIDS.  
In particular, we use cuDF, which is CUDA dataframe. 
This is a powerful data representation layer.  It contains 
pandas-like functionalities for low level CPU and GPU 
components performing a heterogenous parallel computing.  
It eases up  data scientists to manipulate data input/output, 
mimicking the CPU version of dataframe. On the other hand, 
we also use cuML, which is a GPU Machine Learning 
Algorithms 
library. 
 
It 
comes 
with 
Holt-Winter 
implementation in GPU.

C. Forecasting and Performance Accuracy 
The static forecasting will be carried out for the next 5 
working days. The performance of accuracy in forecasting 
will be investigated by root mean square error (RMSE) [37], 
which is shown as follows: 
 
                          
  
(14) 
 
where 
 and 
 are the observed and predicted values at 
time t respectively. The models with the lowest scoring from 
the four methods will be the best forecast models and can be 
used for control purpose in future.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The dataset used in this study is collected from a real 
plastic molding factory with 4 different milling machines.   
These are newly purchased machines, as a result, these 2 
months historical records are not extensive enough. There are 
four sets of the data containing 39 observations (from 30-09-
2019 till 06-11-2019) of the total electricity load for the

production of Hammer and Pellet in Mill 1 and Mill 2.   
NVIDIA P100 GPU was used for the evaluation, which has  
16GB GDDR5 RAM with CUDA version 10.2. 
In this study, the data with same electricity consumption 
is removed. Then the last five observations of these four 
series are used for forecasting and the rest of the observations 
formed the training data for parameter estimation. This 
section mainly demonstrates the prediction process and 
parameter estimates of the five models, simple ES, HLT, 
HLDT, HW, and ARIMA and the fitting data.   We 
implement a batch version of trustworthiness that provides 
reasonable low execution times for dataset up to 39 
observations. In addition, after the fitting results are obtained, 
the accuracy of the five models is analysed and compared 
with the original data. Figure 2 shows plots of these four 
series in daily usage and the plots show that trend and 
seasonality exist.

For the various implemented models, we briefly illustrate 
the finding here.  TABLES I-II present the estimation outputs 
of simple ES, HLT, HLDT and HW for the daily electricity 
consumption of the production of Hammer and Pellet in Mill 
1 and Mill 2 respectively. The values of the sum of square 
errors shown in the TABLE I-II are used to identify the 
dispersion of the training data in the fitted model.  TABLE 
III presents the ARIMA models that fitted to the four series, 
the models are selected based on minimum values of Akaike 
Information Criterion. The performance of accuracy in the 
forecasting is shown in TABLE IV. From the TABLE IV, it 
can be seen that the RMSE values of the HLT model are 
smaller than the ARIMA model and others ES models in the 
series of Hammer (Mill 1 and Mill 2) and Pellet (Mill 1), and 
HLDT is the smallest for Pellet (Mill 2). In other words, ES 
model, HL and HLDT models are more precise in predicting 
the electricity consumption total data in the production of 
Hammer and Pellet in Mill 1 and Mill 2.

TABLE IV.   THE  RMSE OF THE ARIMA AND ES MODELS. 
 
 
GPU computing is at a tipping point, as we compare the 
execution time and correctness of GPU many-core and CPU 
implementation against CPU multicore.  TABLE V shows 
the timing performance of CPU and GPU implementation. 
CPU implementation is provided by statmodels library, while 
GPU implementation is adopted from cuML. The GPU 
performance is shown in brackets. We can observe that the 
GPU can provide around 3× performance improvement in 
training 
and 
forecasting, 
compared 
to 
the 
CPU 
implementation.  The result turns out that it cannot take full 
advantages of all the available CUDA cores on the GPU 
device.  The dataset size is too small.

CONCLUSION 
This study aims to compare various ES models and 
ARIMA model based on RMSE criteria in forecasting the 
daily electricity usage total data in the industry. From the 
results of data analysis that has been done, it was found that 
the model of Holt’s Linear with lowest RMSE is the most 
appropriate model in forecasting the daily electricity usage 
total data in the production of Hammer (in Mill 1 and Mill 2) 
and the production of Pellet (in Mill 1). Holt’s Linear 
Damped Trend model gave the lowest RMSE in the 
production of Pellet in Mill 2. These models are more 
appropriate when compared with Holt-Winters Additive 
model and ARIMA model. GPU acceleration is also useful to 
speed up the training and forecasting with approximately 3× 
performance gain. However, our experiment shows that there 
is approximately 40 milliseconds speed up.  It is not a 
significant result, as the current dataset is small.  Thus, it 
requires more new sensors to be used for collecting bigger 
historical dataset, then, it will be worthwhile from GPU 
acceleration. For future work, external factors that possibly 
affecting electricity consumption should also be included and 
more technique will be included.
