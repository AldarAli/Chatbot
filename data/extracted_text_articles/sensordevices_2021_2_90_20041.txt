Abstract—Hydrogen is a promising gas for greenhouse gas 
emission reduction but also a reactive one. Thus, sensor for 
hydrogen detection in various atmospheres is mandatory. 
While leak sensors in air environments have been widely 
studied, only few researches have been done for hydrogen 
detection in anaerobic environments. In this work, the 
electrical resistance variation of a PdAu alloy as a sensitive 
film, is studied at various temperatures for hydrogen exposures 
in an anaerobic (N2) environment. The Pd0.8Au0.2 alloy was 
deposited on a Si/SiO2 substrate using magnetron sputtering 
followed by annealing at 200°C in N2. The sensor was then 
tested at various temperatures for 0.3% H2 exposure, the best 
operating temperature was found to be 50°C. Finally, sensor 
was able to detect at 50°C, concentrations from 0.3 to 3% H2. 
These 
preliminary 
results 
are 
promising 
for 
further 
development of hydrogen sensors in anaerobic environment.

INTRODUCTION  
The current context of climate change and the drive for 
sustainable development require the reduction of greenhouse 
gas emissions through the introduction of new technologies 
with minimal or no carbon emissions. Hydrogen gas has 
been identified as a very attractive energy carrier, since its 
combustion and its use to produce electricity generate only 
water as by-products [1]–[3]. As a result, a fast-growing 
hydrogen economy, based on the replacement of fossil fuels 
by hydrogen, will become a reality in several countries. 
Hydrogen is the lightest of chemical elements and the 
smallest molecule, having a great propensity to leak. 
Furthermore, hydrogen is a colourless, odourless, and 
tasteless gas, which has low auto ignition concentration in air 
(4 to 75%). Hence, high sensitivity hydrogen sensors, able to 
detect any leakage of hydrogen, are essentials wherever 
hydrogen is produced, transported and used. Gas pipelines 
are considered as a way to transport hydrogen (as a 
hydrogen/natural gas mixture) toward the end user, avoiding 
construction of new costly infrastructures and facilitate long 
term storage [4]–[6]. Gas impurities such as humidity and 
SO2 are kept to a minimum limiting the corrosion and 
fragilization of pipelines [7] [8]. As a result, output gas can 
be considered as almost perfectly dry. While sensors for the 
detection of hydrogen leaks into the air have been widely 
studied for decades [9]–[11], no comprehensive study has yet 
been published on the measurement of high hydrogen 
concentrations in an oxygen-deprived atmosphere. To our 
knowledge, only two papers have focused on the anaerobic 
operation of hydrogen sensors [12] [13].  
The main sensor technology able to measure selectively  
high hydrogen concentrations is Palladium (Pd) based thin 
film resistive sensors [10] [14]. Indeed, the Pd surface atoms 
decompose the adsorbed hydrogen molecules, and atomic 
hydrogen is easily absorbed into the Pd bulk to form Pd 
hydride. The absorbed hydrogen atoms cause changes in the  
crystal structure of the metal and an increase of electrical 
resistivity due to scattering of free electrons by the absorbed 
hydrogen atoms. However, the absorption of hydrogen 
causes an expansion of the Pd crystal lattice, leading to 
hysteresis in the sensor response and crack formation and 
delamination from the substrate.  
One solution to avoid these serious drawbacks is to 
introduce, into Pd, metal atoms with an atomic radius larger 
than that of Pd atoms, e.g., Gold (Au) atoms. Hence, Au 
atoms, which occupy Pd lattice sites, slightly expand the Pd 
lattice, thereby reducing the strain induced energy barrier 
created upon hydrogen absorption, and thus hysteresis. As a 
result, hysteresis shrinks symmetrically and disappears about 
20-25 % Au at room temperature [15] [16].  
PdAu alloys were mainly used to realize optical sensors 
showing interesting performances [15], [17]–[19], but optical 
sensors are more complex and expensive than resistive 
sensors. 
In this paper, we present preliminary results on the 
fabrication, characterisation and dry anaerobic sensing 
properties of a Pd0.8Au0.2 resistive hydrogen sensor. The 
paper is structured as follow: in section II we will describe 
the sensor fabrication and the experimental setup used for 
sensing characterization; then, in section III, the sensing 
results under various temperatures and hydrogen exposures 
will be discussed. Finally, in section IV, a conclusion is 
drawn with an insight of future work.

DESCRIPTION OF APPROACH AND TECHNIQUES 
A. Sensor fabrication 
PdAu deposition was made by radio frequency 
magnetron sputtering. Prior to the sensor fabrication, SiO2/Si 
substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic acetone bath 
followed by an alcohol and deionized water rinsing. Two 
cleaned substrates were placed in the sputtering chamber:  
one for structural characterization (sample A), the other for 
sensor 
realization 
(sample 
B). 
To 
allow 
rapid 
characterisation of hydrogen sensing, a simple basic sensor 
was made using a shadow mask consisting of a thin sheet of 
steel mechanically drilled. A picture of a typical fabricated 
sensor is shown in Fig. 1. The chamber was first pumped to a 
vacuum of 5 x 10-9 bar, then a thin titanium layer was 
deposited to promote adherence to the substrate as reported 
by several authors [20] [21]. The sputtering was performed 
on a Pd target partially covered by Au disks, at an argon 
pressure of 15x10-6 bar. Once deposition completed, the 
samples were annealed at 200°C in N2 gas for several hours, 
since 200°C was found to be the best annealing temperature 
as described in [22]. Finally, a 120nm thick film was 
obtained, measurements were performed using a Dektak XT 
profilometer. 
B. Experimental Setup for Sensor Characterization 
The sensor was tested in a chamber of approximately 0.3 
litre. Sensor was positioned on a heating plate with a Pt100

(class B accuracy) temperature sensor attached next to it. The 
electrical resistance of the sensing film was measured by a 
Keithley Sourcemeter 2450 and recorded on a personal 
computer by a homemade software, every 0.5s. A 
programmable commercial gas mixing system was used for 
flow regulation. A continuous dry nitrogen (N2) flow was 
used as baseline for every electrical measurement presented 
below. Hydrogen (H2) concentrations were obtained by 
mixing a 3% H2 in N2 bottle with a pure N2 bottle (used for 
baseline). Every H2 exposure last 25 min. A 100sccm gas 
flow at atmospheric pressure was used on every experiment. 
As electrical resistance varies with temperature, only the 
sensor response (Rs) is calculated and presented in this work, 
using (1), were R0 is the value of sensor stable base line 
resistance under constant temperature and pure nitrogen flow 
(value taken once, before any H2 exposure), and R is the 
value of the sensor electrical resistance under H2 exposure. 
The response and recovery time presented bellow are 
respectively defined as the time needed to reach 90% of the 
maximal Rs value for a given H2 exposure (T90) and as the 
time needed to return from stable Rs value to 10% of the 
stable baseline when hydrogen gas was stopped (T10). 
 
Rs (%) = [(R – R0)/R0]×100

PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ELECTRICAL 
CHARACTERIZATION 
A. Chemical composition 
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis was 
performed with a Zeiss Gemini SEM 500 ultra-high 
resolution Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope  
(FESEM). For chemical analyses (Energy Dispersive X-ray 
Spectroscopy (EDS)), an Energy Dispersive Analysis of X-
rays (EDAX) Octane Silicon Drift Detector (129 eV energy 
resolution for Manganese) was used at 15 kV, with a 
magnification of 10k on 3um x 3um area. Fig. 2 shows X-ray 
line spectra performed on sample A, with detected elements 
such as Palladium (Pd), Gold (Au), Silicon (Si) and Carbon 
(C). Four measurements were performed revealing an 
estimated alloy composition of 80% Pd and 20% Au. 
 
Visual surface sample inspection is shown in Fig. 3, 
using SEM 100k magnification. No major variation is 
observed for surface morphology after annealing. Surface is 
composed of zones with small grains and zones of merged 
grains. 
B. X Ray diffraction 
 
The sample A microstructure was examined by X-ray 
diffraction, prior and after annealing was performed. The 
diagrams have been carried out with a theta-theta 
configuration and CuKα radiation (λ=0.154 nm) using an 
Empyrean diffractometer, equipped with a rapid detector,

peak at 9.72 keV is not displayed. 
using a 2° offset to avoid to be aligned with Si substrate. The 
average crystallite grain size (Gs) was estimated using the 
Scherrer formula (2). 
 
Gs = [0.89×λ]/[ ×cosθ] 
() 
Where λ is the X-ray wavelength,  the FWHM of (111) 
peak and θ the diffraction angle. Fig. 4 evidences that, for 
our sputtering parameters and film thickness, the film 
crystallizes mainly with a (111) preferred orientation and this 
trend is kept even after annealing. Small diffraction peaks are 
detected for the (311) and (222) planes; * symbol refers to 
SiO2/Si substrate diffraction peak. Heat treatment has a 
noticeable impact on the microstructure with an increase of 
the crystallinity as (111) peak intensity grows from 13700 to 
almost 19400 counts. But, as suggested by Fig. 3, the grain 
size estimated from the Scherrer formula seems to be stable 
about 20 ±1 nm. Otherwise, the 2θ angle shift of the 
diffraction peaks is suggesting stress relaxation during the 
heat treatment.   
C. Temperature influence on sensor response to hydrogen 
 
Temperature of measurement is of crucial importance as 
it 
both 
affects 
sensor 
performance 
in 
term 
of 
response/recovery time and sensitivity. Furthermore, for 
practical applications, high operating temperatures are power 
consuming and hazardous for explosive environment [23]. 
Response/recovery time is usually reported to decrease with 
increasing temperature of measurement. Regarding sensor 
response to H2 exposure, data vary. Some authors see their 
response dropping [24] [25], others increasing [20] [25] [26].

nm). The star indicates the trace of the Si substrate diffraction peak. 
 
Fig. 5 shows the sensor response to 0.3% H2 in N2 
exposure, at various temperatures. Response and recovery 
time as well as response amplitude are decreasing with 
increasing temperature. The response (T90) and recovery time 
(T10) are respectively 6min50s and 68min at 25°C, 5min40s 
and 17min30s at 100°C. Those results are in line with 
previous literature. Regarding sensor amplitude, it can be 
seen that upon heating, the maximal response value to 0.3% 
H2 exposure diminishes and signal tends to become noisy, 
thus sensor will be less sensitive to H2 variations. Yet, sensor 
was found to be operative for hydrogen detection in an 
anaerobic environment at all temperatures, 1.9% being the 
maximal response, obtained at 25°C and 0.5% being the 
lowest response, obtained at 100°C. Best operative 
temperature was found to be 50°C as it combines sufficient 
short response and recovery time (6min20s and 21min40s 
respectively), good sensitivity with 1.3% response toward 
0.3% H2 and a clear signal. Response and recovery time as 
well as sensor response are plotted for all temperatures in 
Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 respectively. 
 
The 
sensor 
response 
dropping 
with 
increasing 
temperature can be explained as follows. The hydrogen 
absorption capacity of Pd and its alloys is linked to their 
Fermi level and the number of free d-states at this level [27] 
[28]. When increasing temperature, the number of low 
energy free d-sites tends to diminish as Fermi level rises, 
thus, more and more energy is needed for octahedral site 
occupation. For a given H2 concentration, less site 
occupation will occur at elevated temperature, resulting in a 
lower response amplitude. 
 
 Finally, sensor sensitivity to others H2 concentrations 
was investigated with a 1.5% and 3% H2 exposure, results are

presented in Fig. 8. Response amplitude is 2.6% for 1.5% H2 
and 3.4% for 3% H2. Response and recovery time are 
respectively 6min20s and 20min20s for 1.5% H2, 6min and 
20min40s for 3% H2. Those data show that our sensor was 
able to detect hydrogen from low to high concentration with 
a stable baseline. 
 
Regarding response time, literature usually shows 
response/recovery time in the order of a few tens of seconds 
for the same material. An explanation for such difference 
with our minutes order response time could be due to : (1) 
thickness and width of our sensor design, simulation [29] 
show that expanding sensor volume largely increases 
reaction time; (2) low gas flow compare to cell volume. 
Fick’s second law is usually used to ascribe the hydrogen 
diffusion dependence to H2 partial pressure [29]. Thus, a 
long filling time results in a non-maximal kinetic of diffusion 
in the sensing layer. Recent work put in evidence long filling 
time of our cross chamber [30], validating above hypothesis. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FURTHER WORK 
 
In summary, we have fabricated a resistive hydrogen 
sensor, using Pd0.8Au0.2 alloy as sensitive film, by magnetron 
sputtering and tested it in an anaerobic environment at 
different temperatures. DRX analysis shows the preferential 
growth along the (111) plane. Thermal treatment increased 
the film crystallinity, while grain size remains at 20 ±1 nm. 
The best operating temperature was found to be at 50°C as it 
combines a relative fast response and recovery time, a 
sufficient response amplitude to 0.3% H2 in N2 and a clear 
and exploitable signal. Sensor was also able to detect 
hydrogen from low (0.3%) to high concentration (3%). After 
this preliminary work showing PdAu alloy ability to measure 
hydrogen in an anaerobic atmosphere, the next steps of the 
study will concern :  
- 
Characterisation of the sensitivity and selectivity  
- 
Improving response and recovery times 
- 
Testing the effect of different Au contents in the alloy 
under anaerobic atmospheres containing up to 3%H2.
