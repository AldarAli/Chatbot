Abstract— This paper shows the experience of a specialized 
data mining process that integrates mortality data collected by 
the official censuses of 2000 and 2010. The objective is the 
generation of patterns of interest based on the clustering of 
districts with high mortality rates for different causes of death. 
According to the specialized literature, few studies related to 
data mining applications using census databases have been 
reported, despite the potential census databases have. 
Contributions of this work are the implementation of a data 
preparation subsystem and the integration of a data warehouse 
that contains records of deaths, occurring in 2000 and 2010 for 
2049 different causes of death. In order to validate the results, 
we analyzed four causes of death related to cancer C16 
(stomach) and C34 (lung), and diabetes mellitus E11 (no 
insulin-dependent), and E14 (unspecified). Experimental 
results were satisfactory and they show some patterns of 
interest and an increase in the mortality rate in 2010 compared 
to 2000.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Censuses are important because the information collected 
is used to understand the reality that a country lives; in 
addition, this information is used by different organizations 
and institutions of the public, private and social sector [1]. In 
turn, it allows us to analyze and to understand the problems 
that occur in several areas of a country, e.g. economy, 
housing, health. In the public health area, this information is 
important for the organizations that manage public health 
services, allowing to identify vulnerable sectors in a 
population, 
managing 
and 
assigning 
the 
resources 
adequately, and implementing appropriate strategies to 
combat these diseases. 
In Mexico, as in other countries, censuses collect 
information about different aspects of a given population, 
e.g. health, educational, economic and social features. 
Censuses help to support the research performed by 
academic 
and 
educational 
institutes 
in 
the 
socio-
demographic field [2].  
There are a few studies related to epidemiological data 
where data mining is used as a tool to explore them and 
cartographic visualization systems are used to represent the 
extracted knowledge. Data analysis performed in [3] shows a 
clear image of the concentration of cases of breast cancer in 
New Mexico. The results allow identifying the groups in 
populations using spatial data.  This work is just focused on 
data related to a single state: New Mexico, USA. This 
represents an important drawback regarding the amount of 
available information. 
The works described in [4] and [5] are part of a project 
that uses epidemiological and spatial data in order to 
identify, establish, and display, cartographically, possible 
relationships between patients with cancer and their 
proximity to factories and cell phone antennas. However, this 
work is closely linked to this hypothesis, and do not 
contemplate incidence or mortality rates. 
The works [6] and [7] have used data mining in order to 
extract information from epidemiological data, however; the 
extracted knowledge and its representation follow a different 
approach to the one presented in this research. 
This research takes part of a bigger data mining project in 
the epidemiological domain. Previous works [8], [9], and 
[10] were developed specifically for analyzing mortality 
causes related with cancer; these researches are an important 
antecedent and are closely related to our data mining 
objective. In [11] [12], a Data Warehouse was implemented 
and a data mining tool was developed in order to generate 
and to display patterns of interest represented as groups of 
districts with high rates of cancer mortality in maps of 
Mexico. 
This paper shows the experience of a specialized data 
mining process whose primary objective is the generation of 
patterns of interest shown as groups of districts with high 
mortality rates. The process has been developed for several 
causes of death among which we have selected four causes 
related to cancer and diabetes mellitus as a practical case of 
study. As an additional contribution, a subsystem focused on 
the data preparation step for the epidemiological domain and 
a data warehouse, that integrates data from the official 
censuses, were implemented. 
This document is organized as follows: Section II shows 
a brief description of the analysis, data preparation, and data 
integration performed on the mortality data. A data 
preparation subsystem is described in Section III. Section IV 
describes the cartographic visualization subsystem which 
displays maps of Mexico with groups of districts with high 
mortality rates for different causes. Section V shows the 
results obtained and the contributions made by this research. 
Conclusions and future work are shown in Section VI.

II. 
CENSUS DATABASES DESCRIPTION AND 
PREPROCESSING 
 
We have collected databases from official censuses. In the 
epidemiological domain, data from census carried out by 
official organisms such as Statistics and Geography National 
Institute (INEGI, Instituto Nacional de Estadística y 
Geografía) in Mexico allow us to analyze and to understand 
the behavior of diseases and how they affect a population, 
showing information about what diseases have higher 
recurrence and the number of deaths occurred because of 
those diseases. 
However, it is important to completely exploit this 
information in order to obtain more significant knowledge 
that permits health organisms to make decisions to prevent 
these diseases or to improve the living conditions of those 
who suffer them. Data mining is a tool that facilitates the 
task of extracting knowledge from data, which may be useful 
to understand a phenomenon.  
The knowledge extracted represents information of 
interest to health organisms not only in Mexico, but also in 
other parts of the world where the censuses are carried out. 
The above mentioned represents a possibility to apply this 
project to other countries. In the following sections, the data 
mining process followed in this research is briefly described: 
 
A. Database description 
The data were extracted from different official 
information sources from Mexico. The information sources 
and the data description are shown below: 
 
 
Mortality database: records of deaths occurring in 
2000 and 2010 for different causes of death [13], 
extracted from: National Health Information System 
(SINAIS, Sistema Nacional de Información en 
Salud). 
 
Geographic database: records of the geographical 
position of the districts of Mexico [14], extracted 
from: Database District System (SIMBAD, Sistema 
Municipal de Bases de Datos). 
 
Population database: records of the total population 
by districts in Mexico, for 2000 and 2010 [15], 
extracted from: INEGI. 
 
International catalogue of diseases (CIE-10) [16]: 
code classification and names of diseases. It includes 
2049 causes of death (Updated to 2009), extracted 
from: Collaborating Center for the Family of 
International 
Classifiers 
(CEMECE, 
Centro 
Colaborador para la Familia de Clasificadores 
Internacionales de la OMS en México). 
 
SINAIS and SIMBAD systems have data provided by 
INEGI. Table I shows the number of attributes and records 
of the databases for 2000 and 2010.

B. Data analysis and pre-processing 
Databases were analyzed in order to understand the 
database schema, to select the attributes of interest, and to 
understand the meaning of these attributes. This analysis 
was performed using a data description file, which is 
provided by the information sources from where the 
databases were extracted. 
Additionally, the data analysis allowed us to identify 
attributes with errors which should be corrected or deleted 
in order to prevent the knowledge extracted by the data 
mining process to be wrong. In a first review, attributes with 
null values or empty attributes were deleted for all tuples; 
dependent attributes were identified and deleted using a 
correlation analysis. Then, the attributes of interest, needed 
to achieve the data mining goal, were selected by an expert 
domain.  
Records that do not represent information of interest to 
the data mining goal, e.g., records related to districts with 
population less than 100,000 inhabitants, were eliminated.  
 Finally, the data construction tasks were performed. In 
this case, two new attributes, needed to reach the data 
mining objective, were identified and incorporated. The 
specific operations to calculate them are: calculation of the 
mortality Incidence and the calculation of the Mortality 
Rate; these are relevant indicators for the epidemiological 
domain experts. 
The mortality Incidence is the number of cases observed 
for a particular disease in a specific district, in a particular 
year. The calculation of the Mortality Rate is performed for 
each district with population over 100,000 inhabitants, by 
convention in the health area, using the Expression (1): 
 
Rate = Incidence  * 100,000        
 
 
Population 
 
where Population is the number of inhabitants in a 
district for a specific year. This value is extracted from the 
population data provided by INEGI. 
C. Data integration 
A data warehouse is a database that integrates data from 
one or more information systems in an organization and it is 
oriented to assist in the decision making process [17]. The 
data were integrated in a data warehouse with a similar 
structure to that proposed in [18]. A data warehouse stores 
historical and non-volatile information related with a fact, in 
this case, the information is related to all deaths occurred in 
2000 and 2010, in districts with a population over 100,000

inhabitants. Additionally, the data warehouse structure 
facilitates the integration of data for different years. 
The data warehouse includes three dimensions. The fact 
table stores the results of the operations to calculate the 
mortality Incidence and the Mortality Rate for a particular 
disease among 2049 causes contained in the CIE-10. 
Figure 1 shows the multidimensional model of the data 
warehouse. It is represented as a bucket with three views or 
dimensions that include CAUSE of death related to SPACE 
(districts) and TIME (year) of occurrence. 
 
III. 
DATA PREPARATION SUBSYSTEM 
In order to automate the data preparation process for the 
epidemiological domain, a data preparation subsystem was 
developed. The subsystem was implemented on Java 
language using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) and SQL 
(Structure Query Language).  
JDBC allows to establish the connection between the java 
language and the data warehouse; SQL standard allows to 
write queries to access data stored in it. 
Figure 2 shows the conceptual model of the data 
preparation subsystem. The subsystem contains two modules 
that automate some tasks of data construction and data 
integration. A brief description of these modules is provided 
below: 
A. Module of data construction tasks 
In this module, the subsystem access to the data stored in 
the data warehouse and selects all data related to a specific 
cause of death for a particular year, and then the operations 
to calculate the mortality Incidence and Mortality Rate are 
executed. For each operation the subsystem executes: 
 
Calculation of mortality Incidence. A query sentence 
that counts all records related to deaths occurred for 
a specific cause of death in a particular year.  
 
Calculation of Mortality Rate. The results obtained 
for the mortality incidence are used to execute 
arithmetic operations to calculate the Mortality Rate 
using Expression 1 (showed in Section II.B). 
 
Figure 1.  Conceptual view of the data warehouse. 
The subsystem executes the previous tasks and the results 
are stored in the fact table described in Section II.C. 
 
Figure 2.  Data preparation subsystem. 
B. Module of final dataset integration 
Additionally, the subsystem automates the creation of a 
dataset whose structure is described in Table II. The data 
preparation subsystem takes, from the fact table, all the 
records related to CAUSE and YEAR of death introduced as 
input. 
The dataset structure has four attributes; the first one 
contains the value for the cause of death to be analyzed, 
second and third columns contain the values of latitude and 
longitude of the district used to find its position on the map. 
The last column corresponds to the calculation of the 
mortality rate. 
The subsystem has the ability to perform these 
calculations and to build the dataset, receiving as input only 
the values of CAUSE and YEAR of death; the tests were 
performed changing these values. For CAUSE, the causes 
tested were C16, C34, E11, and E14; for YEAR 2000 and 
2010. 
IV. 
CARTOGRAPHIC VISUALIZATION SUBSYSTEM 
 
The dataset generated by the data preparation subsystem is 
used as input by the cartographic visualization subsystem 
described in [4]; this subsystem contains two modules: a 
pattern generator and a cartographic display.  
The pattern generator takes the dataset (described in 
Section 4), converts it into an .arff file and, using the K-
means clustering algorithm implemented on Weka, classifies 
the n-items into a given number of k-groups of districts with 
similar “Latitude”, “Longitude”, and “Mortality rate” for a 
specific cause of death. The results of the clustering 
algorithm are lists of element groups including the centroid 
of each group.

Figure 3.  Interaction between the data preparation subsystem and the

The cartographic display permits to select and draw a map 
of Mexico with all the groups generated after analyzing the 
data with k-means clustering algorithm. Figure 3 shows the 
interaction between the data preparation subsystem and the 
cartographic visualization subsystem.  
A set of experiments were conducted with the 
cartographic visualization subsystem for the same causes 
tested by the data preparation subsystem. We have used the 
k-means algorithm and established the value of k parameter 
in 15, 20 and 25 for each cause corresponding to data in 
2000. For data in 2010, the k parameter was established in 
20, 25, and 30 because in 2010, the number of districts was 
greater than in 2000. In both cases, the best result was 
obtained with k =20. 
Figures 4 and 5 show the maps displayed by the 
cartographic visualization subsystem for the mortality cause 
E11 related to diabetes mellitus no insulin-dependent. We 
have highlighted three patterns that represent the groups of 
districts with the higher mortality rates for this cause in 2000 
and 2010. 
Figures 6 and 7 show the maps displayed by the 
cartographic visualization subsystem for the mortality cause 
E14 related to unspecified diabetes mellitus. We have 
highlighted three patterns that represent the groups of 
districts with the higher mortality rates for this cause in 2000 
and 2010. 
V. 
RESULTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS 
 
We have implemented a data warehouse that contains 
information about all deaths occurred in districts of Mexico 
with populations over 100,000 inhabitants in 2000 and 2010. 
In addition, we have implemented a data preparation 
subsystem which has the capacity to generate prepared 
datasets for 2049 different causes of death registered in the 
CIE-10. 
In order to validate the results obtained by the automated 
data preparation subsystem, we have performed tests for the 
causes of death C16 (stomach cancer) and C34 (lung cancer), 
and we have compared these results with the results obtained 
by previous works [5], [6], and [7] where the data 
preparation process were manually performed. The values 
generated for the mortality Incidence and the Mortality Rate 
by the data preparation subsystem correspond exactly to the 
values obtained in previous works. Table III shows the 
results obtained for the first group identified in previous 
works as a group of interest for the cause of death C16 in 
2000:

Another important contribution is the automation of the 
data preparation tasks that calculate the mortality Incidence 
and the Mortality Rate, which represented the largest effort 
in the data preparation process. We carried out tests for four 
causes of death (C16, C34, E11 and E14) for 2000 and 2010, 
Table V shows a comparison between the time required to 
perform manually and automatically these tasks:

Additionally, other experiments were performed; datasets 
with information for the causes of death E11 and E14 for the 
years 2000 and 2010 and their corresponding maps (Figures 
4, 5, 6 and 7) were generated. Group three (Figure 6c) is the 
one with the largest average mortality rate, but this group is 
not meaningful because its districts are more dispersed than 
in other groups.

VI. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
 
Data collected by official censuses in a country permits 
to analyze interesting aspects of a population. In the health 
domain, census databases allow us to have a perspective of 
how diseases affect some sectors of the population and the 
evolution of these diseases through time and space. 
We have used official census databases from 2000 and 
2010 and applied a specialized data mining process in order 
to analyze different causes of death related to cancer and 
diabetes. 
In the causes of death selected for cancer (C16 and C34) 
and diabetes (E11 and E14), we observed an increase in the 
mortality rates in 2000 compared to 2010. For the cause of 
death E11, we have observed in the maps an increase in the 
number of districts with high mortality rate and the 
concentration of these districts in the central region of the 
country (see Figure 6b).  
Other patterns of interest were identified for the cause of 
death E14. In 2000 a group of districts in the state of 
Chihuahua were identified (see Figure 6a). Figure 7a shows 
another group of interest in the northwest region which has 
the second largest mortality rate; its districts are located 
between the states of Sonora and Baja California. 
As a future work, we propose to make a trend analysis of 
deaths occurred between 2000 and 2010 for different causes 
of death. Additionally, we propose the integration of the data 
preparation subsystem and the cartographic visualization 
subsystem.
