Abstract—Exercise is a physical activity that can enhance or
maintain physical ability and health. For oxygen extraction,
the ventilation will be affected by the breathing response.
Cardiac Output (CO) amounts to blood by the heart pumping
through the circulatory system. This blood ensures that oxygen
is delivered to active tissue. During inspiration or expiration,
Stroke Volume (SV) also changes. As we can see, the
cardiopulmonary
reactions
during
exercise face
dynamic
changes. In this work, we used a non-invasive method to
measure SV and Breathing Frequency (BF) in order to
investigate
cardiopulmonary
interactions
observed
during
incremental exercising. The result in this experiment showed
that SV would decrease to a stable value in the last stage of
exercise. CO and BF would increase. SV and BF have opposite
changes during incremental exercise. To the best of our
knowledge, this study is the first one to use non-invasive
methods to observe the changes in hemodynamic parameters
during incremental exercising. The benefit of a non-invasive
approach is that it is more suitable for home activities.

INTRODUCTION
Physical activity helps people maintain health and
physical ability. During exercise, the first observed response
is breathing and heart rate. People regulate their breathing
frequency and the depth of breathing unconsciously or
consciously. Breathing is influenced by the rhythm of
exercising. For example, athletes have their own rhythm of
breathing to maintain during exercising [1]. Athletes’ ability
to
integrate
the
breathing
action
effectively
without
disturbing performance is crucial to getting a better
performance
[2].
However,
breathing
patterns
change
dynamically during exercising.
For oxygen extraction, the ventilation is influenced by
the breathing response [3]. CO amounts to blood by the
heart-pumping thorough the circulatory system. The blood
delivers oxygen to active tissue. The heart and lungs are in
the intrathoracic space, and the gas exchanges the volume
and pressure when humans exercise [3]. During expiration,
the pressure increases in the chest, helping to drain off blood
in the ventricle and increasing SV temporarily. On the other
hand, during inspiration, the negative intrathoracic pressure
makes the blood drain difficultly and decrease blood volume
in the ventricle [3]. To transport blood to limbs and return to
the heart, the skeletal muscle support venous return during
exercising [4]. Therefore, the cardiovascular and respiratory
systems are integrated during exercising. Furthermore, the
responses interact in circulation during dynamic exercising.
Regulation of breathing can provide support during
cycling when the BF cooperates with the frequency of
pedaling. The BF increases at perceived resistance at a high
level.
Humans
also
maintain
exercising
continuously.
According to the previous study, breathing patterns and CO
are helpful for understanding mechanisms during exercising.
Breathing can affect HR and SV. By inspiration and
expiration, the gas pressure changes the SV volume.
However, to the best of our knowledge, few papers discuss
SV and BF during exercising. In this study, we aim to
observe CO, SV, and HR during exercising. We also observe
the breathing frequency and SV situation during exercising.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section II
presents the materials and the method used. Section III
presents the results, and Section IV the discussion. We
conclude in Section V.

experiment. All of the participants had to write an informed
consent.
Two
healthy
participants
were
included
in
this
experiment. Participants did
not
have any history of
respiratory
and
cardiovascular
diseases.
Before
the
experiment, each
participant
had
their blood
pressure
measured in the sitting position to make sure they could be
included this experiment.
B.
Equipment
The
Respiratory
Inductive
Plethysmography
(RIP)
(Ambu Sleepmate Ripmate Inductance Belt Thorax, Ambu
Inc., USA) is a non-invasive senor to measure Thoracic Wall
Movement (TWM) and Abdominal Wall Movement (AWM)
to observe the response in breathing. Two elastic belts are
placed on the chest and abdomen. It is suitable for people to
monitor breathing unobtrusively during exercise [5]. It can
record Thoracoabdominal Movement (TAM) to observe the
breathing feature, including breathing frequency.
The
Impedance
Cardiography
(ICG)
(AESCULON,
Osypka, Germany) is a non-invasive way to measure
hemodynamic parameters, such as stroke volume (SV) by
bioimpedance [6]. ICG can provide continuous measures in
blood flow. It places sensors on neck and chest. The sensor
detects the electrical change and impedance change when
blood passes through the vessel.
As stated above, the participants were evaluated by ICG
and RIP in this experiment. We observed the situation during
the experiment.
C.
Experimental protocol
All participants had their blood pressure, SV and
breathing signal measured during resting. After three minutes
of resting, all subjects were asked to ride an upright-seated
cycle ergometer. In cycling, the pedal should be maintained
continuously ot 60 beats per minute (bpm). Stroke volume
and breathing were recorded by ICG and RIP. The workload
increased by 25 W every 3 minutes until they could not
manage it any more. After finishing riding, participants were
asked to cool down and rest.
D.
The instantaneous breathing frequency Calculation
During exercising, the BF was in a dynamic situation.
First, the TWM signal used Empirical Mode Decomposition
(EMD) to decompose into many Intrinsic Mode Functions
(IMFs) [7]. The algorithm of EMD is shown in Figure 1.
However, the problem with EMD is that mode mixing is
involved in IMFs. The Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode
Decomposition (CEEMD) added a pair of white noise to the
signal to solve the mode-mixing problem [8]. The algorithm
of CEEMD is shown in Figure 2. After decomposing the
signal, a significant test is used in this procedure to ensure a
dominant
component.
Therefore,
Normalize
Direct
Quadrature (NDQ) is used to decompose the dominant
component [9]. NDQ is shown in Figure 3. This procedure of
analysis was developed by a software platform (LabVIEW
version 2018, National Instruments Corp, Austin, USA).

The result of the experiment
The result of the experiment is shown in Table II. The
change during exercising is shown in Figures 4 to 7. In
Figure 4 and Figure 5, CO increases during exercising. By
contrast, SV decreases until the last stage. SV decreases in
stable volume.
HR increases over the exercising time. In
Figure 6 and Figure 7, BF and SV had the opposite trend
during exercising. In Figure 8 and Figure 9, HR and BF had
the same trend during exercising.

IV. DISCUSSION
In this experiment, we observe the change in BF, SV,
CO, and HR during incremental exercise. SV decreases
during exercise. CO, HR, and BF had an increasing trend.
The reduction of SV was associated with HR in this study.
BF affects hemondynamics [10]. HR reacted to temperature
and
breathing.
In
our
experiment,
we
excluded
the
temperature situation. We show that BF and HR are
influenced during exercising. SV is associated with BF and
HR.
In this study, we had some limitations in this experiment.
Ventilation is also an important parameter to figure the
mechanism in blood flow [12]. Chantler et al. use the
elastance of the vessel and derive the index of SV to figure
out the mechanism of the cardiovascular system during
exercise [13]. There is still a big issue in stroke volume and
breath during exercise. In future work, we will increase the
number of subjects and provide more data to enhance the
result. Moreover, we will use body mass index to separate
and analyze different phases during exercising to explore the
change.
V.
CONCLUSION
In this study, we present a result of the breathing
frequency and stroke volume situation during exercising.
The
result
is
an
opposite
change
between
breathing
frequency and SV. HR interacts with breathing and indirectly
influences stroke volume. In health care, we use the non-
invasive way to measure BF and SV. It can help people to
exercising at home. It can monitor the response during
exercise. We show that HR and CO are increasing during
exercising.
