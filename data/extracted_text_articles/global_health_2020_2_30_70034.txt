Abstract—The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the health,
ﬁnances, and lives of citizens across the world. COVID-19
continues to evolve and create ”waves” impacting countries at
different time points. In this paper, we examine the transmission
of COVID-19 between the continental United States and the
State of Hawai’i and how that mirrors past inﬂuenza pandemics.
Firstly, we introduce a summary of the 1918-1920 Inﬂuenza
Pandemic. We then give an overview of facts and a timeline
of government response to COVID-19. In addition, comparisons
to the 1918-1920 Inﬂuenza Pandemic and 2018-2019, 2019-2020
Inﬂuenza seasons are provided. We conclude by addressing open
challenges and possible future research directions for studying
COVID-19 in Hawai’i.
Keywords— COVID-19; Inﬂuenza; Pandemic 1918; SIR Model.
I. INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic is far from the ﬁrst infectious disease
that Hawai‘i had to deal with. During the 1918-1920 Inﬂuenza
Pandemic, the Hawaiian islands were not spared as the disease
ravaged through the whole world. It is reasonable to ask whether
any lessons can be learned from Hawai‘i’s experience during the
1918-1920 inﬂuenza pandemic which could potentially be useful in
the ﬁght against COVID-19. It is also sensible to look at the recent
inﬂuenza activity in the state. While the two diseases are different,
mitigation against one of the maladies may prove effective against
the other. The goal of this paper is to investigate how the dynamics
of COVID-19 pandemic in Hawai‘i and its relation to the pandemic
in mainland US compares to the previous inﬂuenza activity.
In Section II, we present a summary of the 1918-1920 Inﬂuenza
Pandemic in Hawai’i. In Section III, we present a timeline of
government response to and facts of COVID-19 in Hawai’i. In
Section IV-B, we discuss COVID-19 and its relation to the 1918-1920
Inﬂuenza Pandemic and 2018-2019, 2019-2020 Inﬂuenza seasons.
The data we present for COVID-19 was gathered from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [1] and Hawai’i Department
of Health (DOH) [2]. The data we present for 2018-2020 Inﬂuenza
seasons was gathered from the Hawai’i Department of Health [3]. We
conclude by addressing challenges and future research for studying
COVID-19 in Hawai’i.
II. 1918−1920 INFLUENZA PANDEMIC
In this section we summarize the ﬁndings in [4] discussing the
1918−1920 Inﬂuenza Pandemic that killed more than 21 million
people, including over 675,000 Americans and more than 2,300
people in Hawai’i. The global timeline of this worldwide pandemic
can be seen in Fig. 1. There are three types of inﬂuenza (A, B, C), of
which Inﬂuenza A is considered the type of virus that produced the
1918 epidemic in Hawai’i. The ﬁrst cases seen on Oahu were at the
island’s military and naval bases at the end of June 1918. The ﬁrst
wave of the 1918 pandemic quickly rolled over Oahu, lasting through
July and into August. The second wave occurred December and
January. There were severe shortages of physicians due to World War
I, along with shortages of hospital beds, nurses, and other medical
personnel and facilities. Although mainland communities had closed
schools, theaters, and churches as public health measures during
the pandemic, Island ofﬁcials resisted similar measures arguing the
closure would have little or no effect on death rates. Eventually some
businesses and institutions temporarily closed, and indoor public
gatherings were prohibited.
Statistics of the pandemic are difﬁcult to ﬁnd. Morbidity statistics
were largely unavailable before October 21, 1918, on which date
inﬂuenza became a reportable disease. However, the authors do have
morbidity statistics before this date as seen in Fig. 2, Fig. 3, and Table
I. Inﬂuenza morbidity has typically been subject to proportionately
more under reporting than ﬂu mortality. Many states were not yet part
of the U.S. death registration area. Hawai’i, a territory at the time, was
omitted from national totals and reported in separate tables until being
admitted to the death registration area in 1917. Another statistical
problem is that morbidity ﬁgures generally omit cases of pneumonia,
which were often the ultimate outcome for inﬂuenza patients.
Fig. 2 shows the death rates for the U.S. death registration area and
the territory of Hawai’i for 1917-1920. Note that Hawai’i’s ﬂu-related
deaths peaked in 1920, two years after the mainland; the reasons for
this lag remain unclear.
Death rates were highest for children under 5 years of age as seen
in Table. I, lowest for those between ﬁve and nineteen. Flu deaths
were exceptionally high for Japanese and pure Hawaiians as seen in
Fig. 3 and Table I while male and female rates were about the same.
III. COVID-19
We summarize some important facts and events of COVID-19
in Hawai’i. A detailed timeline can be found in Fig. 4. The ﬁrst
conﬁrmed COVID-19 case was reported on March 6, 2020 [2]. As of
September 22, 2020, there have been 11,522 COVID-19 cases, with
the majority of them occurring during a large second wave, starting
in the ﬁrst week of June and peaking mid August. During the ﬁrst

wave of COVID-19 cases, the major contributing factor was due to
tourists, prompting the shut down of air and sea travel. However,
the overwhelming cause of cases during the second wave can be
attributed to wide community spread [5]. As of September 22, 2020,
there has been 749 hospitalizations and 120 deaths from the disease
[2], a death rate of approximately 1.04%. Fig. 5 shows a plot of

average daily cases and deaths.
We have listed the COVID-19 deaths by age, sex, and race in
Table II. COVID-19 death victims tend to be older in age, and it
also appears to affect males more than females. The DOH data for
race breakdown seems to be incomplete, as the total number of
deaths categorized by race do not add up to the total number of
deaths reported at that time (total of 119). We have included Native
Hawaiian, Chinese, Black, and Other in the “Unreported” category
as groups with fewer than 5 deaths are not reported. We have also
plotted the race breakdown as seen in Fig. 6. With the information
given, we can observe that Paciﬁc Islanders are disproportionately
affected by COVID-19 even though they make up only about 4%
of Hawai’i population. On the counterpart, data suggests that Native
Hawaiians are less impacted.
Fig. 7 displays the daily new cases as well as a ﬁt obtained using
a standard discrete compartmental model. This model divides the
population into four compartments: Susceptible (not currently in-
fected), Exposed (infected with no symptoms), Infected (infected with
symptoms), Removed (recovered or deceased), i.e., an SEIR model

(see e.g., [6], [7]). Denoting the populations in these compartments
at time t by S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t), respectively, the dynamics can
be described by the following equations:
S(t + 1) = e−λ(t)S(t)
(1)
E(t + 1) = (1 − e−λ(t))S(t) + (1 − p)E(t)
(2)
I(t + 1) = pE(t) + (1 − r)I(t)
(3)
R(t + 1) = rI(t) + R(t),
(4)
where λ(t) is the hazard rate that is computed as λ(t) = β(I(t) +
εE(t)). Here, β is the baseline transmission rate, ε is the transmission
reduction factor for asymptomatic transmission, p is the rate for onset
of symptoms and r is the removal (recovery or death) rate. The
transmission rates for the ﬁt are described in Table III. Fig. 5 displays

on the same graph both the daily cases and the death to highlight the
delay of the onset of deaths compare to the increase in daily cases.
Next, we compare the situation in Hawai’i to the entire United
States. As of September 22, 2020 the United States has had a total of
199,462 deaths out of 6,825,697 cases [1]. The death rate in Hawai’i
is approximately 1.04%, which is lower than the current national
average of approximately 2.92%. Fig. 8 represents the daily cases
and death per capita for the State of Hawai’i compared to the United
States. Note that the data collected for the US also includes Hawai’i
data. A delay can be observed between the US and Hawai’i peaks in
the number of cases. The number of deaths appears to be rising for
Hawai’i.

case of COVID-19 pandemic we have access to much more complete
data. We do however note some similarities and differences between
the two pandemics.
First, let us compare the deaths using Tables I and II and Fig.s 3
and 6. Current data show that the demographic perspectives on the
mortality of 1918-1920 Inﬂuenza Pandemic and COVID-19 Pandemic
differ with the early pandemic affecting younger individuals under the
age of 5 while COVID-19 is almost exclusively affecting individual
older than 60 years old. Both pandemic seem to be dominantly
impacting male versus female. In terms of race, there is some
variations due to a different racial distribution of the individual
making up the Hawai’i population, however in both cases socio-
economic minorities are being disproportionately affected. Hawaiian
and Japanese (then a minority) made a large percentage of deaths in
the 1918-1920 inﬂuenza pandemic, while COVID-19 is dominantly
affecting Paciﬁc Islanders. Japanese also make up a large percentage
of deaths for the COVID-19 pandemic, although it appears that other
groups are at higher proportion versus Japanese groups, e.g., Paciﬁc
Islanders.

and COVID-19 Pandemic is the delay of the waves between the US
and Hawai’i. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 2 and Fig. 6. The delay
in the 1918 pandemic is much larger and we suspect it is due to the
fact that traveling was more limited and tedious but the delay still
exists today (few months). It is too early to know how the curves
will evolve for COVID-19 and something that we will be following.
B. 2018-2020 Inﬂuenza Seasons versus COVID-19
At the beginning of the pandemic, COVID-19 was often dismissed
as another variant of inﬂuenza. For the second part of our discussion,
we attempt to compare and contrast data between COVID-19 and
inﬂuenza, since both data tables are rapidly available to the public.
We utilize the 2018-2019 inﬂuenza season as the control, while com-
paring it to both COVID-19 and and the 2019-2020 inﬂuenza season.

COVID-19 is mostly transmitted via airborne droplets, similarly to
Inﬂuenza [8]. However, additional research has shown COVID-19
can be transmitted via aerosol [9].
Historically, a major contributor to inﬂuenza season in Hawai’i is
due to tourists escaping winter, explaining why Hawai’i does not have
a traditional ﬂu season compared to the rest of the United States.
As seen in Fig. 9, the 2019-2020 inﬂuenza season was very similar
to the 2018-2019 inﬂuenza season up until the shelter-in-place order
for COVID-19, in which the number of cases for the 2019-2020
inﬂuenza season plummets signiﬁcantly. COVID-19 cases similarly
decreased during the shelter-in-place order. Further, the number of
weekly cases for the 2019-2020 inﬂuenza appear to not rise after
the shelter-in-place order was lifted, unlike the COVID-19 cases
which saw a drastic increase. The peak in number of weekly cases
for COVID-19 is more than double of the peaks for the inﬂuenza
seasons. The reasons for this observations are unclear, it can be
due to conﬁrmation bias due to surge testing and other aggressive
testing measures for COVID-19 while inﬂuenza testing is limited to
surveillance and individual seeking medical help for inﬂuenza like
illness. It can also be due to longer infectious period for COVID-19
compare to inﬂuenza. Note that as it was observed when comparing
the 1918 pandemic to COVID-19, the two diseases target different
age demographic: the inﬂuenza virus targets individuals under 20,
while COVID-19 targets individuals over 20.
We now direct our attention to testing for the inﬂuenza seasons
and COVID-19. The 2018-2019 inﬂuenza had an average positivty

rate of 17%, the 2019-2020 inﬂuenza has an average positivity rate
of 13.7%, and COVID-19 has an average positivity rate of 2.2%.
Fig. 10 reﬂects the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic as it forces
stronger testing. The increase in testing resulted in more negative tests
for the 2019-2020 inﬂuenza season versus the 2018-2019 inﬂuenza
season. In Fig. 11, the number of tests for the 2019-2020 inﬂuenza
season increased signiﬁcantly before the shelter-in-place order, but
then decreased during shelter-in-place. We are not sure of the reason
for this but one hypothesis could be that those exhibiting inﬂuenza
like illness avoided their PCP out of fear from contracting COVID-19
and therefore did not get tested. Finally, Fig. 12 displays the counts
for weekly death for the 2018-2019 and the 2019-2020 inﬂuenza as
well as COVID-19 for the state of Hawai’i. The shelter in place did
occur at a time the number of death for inﬂuenza in 2018-2019 was
decreasing anyway and we see a similar behavior for inﬂuenza 2019-
2020 with slightly less cases but striking is the different behavior for
the weekly count of deaths for COVID-19. It is extremely hard at
this stage to anticipate how inﬂuenza and COVID-19 are going to
interact in the coming Fall and Winter.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper depicts the current situation in the State of Hawai’i
regarding the current COVID-19 pandemic. This data analysis needs
to be pursued further to continue monitoring the evolution of the
spread of COVID-19. It is still very early with the new pandemic to
draw deﬁnitive conclusions, but there are some similarities that seem

to be highlighted with the data. Both cases (1918 and today) rely
on non-pharmaceutical measures to contain the pandemic, at least
for COVID-19 until a vaccine will be available. Transportation being
much improved, especially over long distances, COVID-19 is difﬁcult
to contain. In 1918, it was World-War that was a major trigger for
the spread of the disease, while now it is our lifestyle. In both cases,
we see Hawai’i lagging behind the US mainland with regards to the
waves of deaths related to the diseases.
There is much work to be done to understand the spread of the
disease in Hawai’i. Moreover, with the State ready to reopen for
travelers, and to have students going back to school in person, the next
few weeks will be critical for the evolution of COVID-19. Inﬂuenza
pandemic of 1918 exhibited three main waves spread over a three
years period, and the primary concern for COVID-19 right now is an
upcoming second wave.
From this investigation, we conclude that COVID-19 acts differ-
ently qualitatively and quantitatively from inﬂuenza virus; the danger
of COVID-19 should be viewed seriously and not dismissed.
