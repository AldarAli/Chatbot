Abstract
Nowadays, the access selection methods are done based
on operator incentives using static and predeﬁned rules.
But once the number of deployed access technologies and
mobile services is increasing, then today’s access selection
practices are not adequate anymore. We need to think about
end-user preferences in a decision making process. Two
new distributed decision making algorithms called the Net-
work Centric and the Terminal Centric algorithms exploit-
ing Ambient Networks mechanisms are presented. These
algorithms use a richer set of constrains and rules. In order
to evaluate these algorithms from an end-user perspective,
we introduce a new performance index called the User Sat-
isfaction Index. We present our simulation model, perfor-
mance results and analysis. The results indicate that the co-
operation between networks increases the network utiliza-
tion and service availability. The beneﬁts from an end-user
perspective are expressed using the proposed User Satis-
faction Index. Finally, we discuss on further challenges of
a decision making for information centric networking.

1. Introduction
The recent achievement in technology domain and in
business concepts, have resulted large increase in the use
of wireless broadband that can be observe today. For in-
stance, deployment of High-Speed Downlink Packet Access
(HSDPA) technology in the 3G networks has provided the
basic capacity for large scale usage of mobile broadband.
As an example from the prolong we mention, Wireless LAN
(WLAN) access at hotspots, which have been available for
many years at quite high cost, but nowadays they are offered
at very low cost, for “free” or included in some service bun-
dle. In general, the introduction of very attractive ﬂat rate
pricing for the mobile broadband access is one of the key
reasons for the “mobile data explosion”.
However, this large increase in trafﬁc will put very high
requirements on the availability of low cost high capacity
wireless networks implying that additional capacity and in-
vestments are needed. While new radio access technolo-
gies like Long-Term Evolution (LTE) will contribute sub-
stantially to the needed reduction of network costs, mobile
network operators will need to develop and consider new
deployment and cooperation concepts for network sharing,
roaming at a national and local level, reuse private networks
and off-loading of trafﬁc to low cost networks. Especially
off-loading and exploitation of available accesses in a multi-
access environmentrequire more sophisticated access selec-
tion means in order to hide the extra complexity introduced
by a diverse networking environment for the end-users.
In this paper we will discuss and analyze cooperation
between different types of radio access networks and ex-
tend the simulation results presented in The Third Interna-
tional Conference on Systems and Networks Communica-
tions (ICSNC 2008) [1]. The cooperation between opera-
tors both result in lower network costs as well as increased
network utilization and availability for the end-users when
enhanced decision making is used.

eration and use of multi-radio access technology have ex-
isted for many years. Many operators already use network
sharing (e.g.
based on [2]) and national roaming. Net-
works with different types of Radio Access Technologys
(RATs) have also existed for many years. The principles
of Multi-Radio Resource Management (MRRM) have been
researched, designed and tested for many years and the per-
formance gains are well known. Also interworking between
3G and WLAN systems [3] is standardized. So, it sounds
that good justiﬁcation is needed to make this topic relevant
and “new”.
One part of the justiﬁcation of extended network coop-
eration is related to service availability and coverage. Oper-
ators traditionally allow own customers to access their own
network only. In case when the own network does not have
coverage the own customer simply cannot connect to other
available networks on the coverage. For international roam-
ing the case is different, the user terminal switches to an-
other operator networks as soon as the coverage is reduced
for the current operator. In this sense visitors have better
service availability due to the international roaming agree-
ments. Hence, the type of cooperation we are proposing is
more or less national roaming applied at a local and regional
level [4] [5] [6]. In general the principle should be that ”any-
one” can connect to ”any” network [7] [8] [9]. However, in
this paper we assume that users have agreements (subscrip-
tions) with some kind of service provider [5]. Typically this
is a network operator but it could also be a virtual operator
(without own access network resources), a service provider
or a trusted third party, e.g. a credit card company.
Second part of the justiﬁcation of increased cooperation
is related to trafﬁc, revenues and network costs. During the
last two years there has been a very large increase of usage
of mobile data using wide area networks, up to 300-500% .
The data service problem for the operators is that although
the trafﬁc increases substantially, in contrast to the voices
service (and charging per minute of use) where the revenues
and trafﬁc increase coherently, increase in the revenues is
falling behind [10], due to dominating ﬂat rate charging.
The revenue per MB of data is around 1 euro for voice and
0,01 euro for “data” and for some operators the mobile data
is 60-80% of the trafﬁc but the corresponding revenues are
only 10%.
The operators are challenged by what we can call a “rev-
enue gap”. Hence, the operators must focus a lot on cost
control and deployment of “low cost” networks in order to
meet the increased demand of mobile data services. The
different types of cooperation mentioned above can all con-
tribute to this cost reduction although it will not “solve” the
whole problem. In addition to the possible cost savings a
number of other aspects need to be considered and analyzed
in order to both understand and exploit the possible beneﬁts
of cooperation:
• the structure and organization of a market with a mul-
titude of network operators, service providers and dif-
ferent types of third parties and middlemen
• the impact on markets and competition due to the facts
that end-users more freely can choose between many
providers
• the types of business relations and agreements between
providers
• the algorithms used for selection of network and radio
access technology
• the potential improvements in network utilization and
service availability
• the user experience of the increased service availability
The three ﬁrst aspects have been discussed and analyzed
in both public deliverables [4] [11] [12] of the EU project
Ambient Networks [13] as well as in papers presented at
international conferences [14] [15]. In this paper we will
focus on the three last aspects and we also further extend
the analysis and results presented in [1] [16] [17].
In this paper we introduce a distributed decision mak-
ing algorithm that both enables and exploit the cooperation,
i.e. the algorithms used for establishing the cooperation and
for performing the access selection and handover. We then
evaluate the impacts from both as network perspective, in
terms of network utilization and service availability, as well
from a user perspective. Hence, we can identify three re-
search questions related to:
• Selection of decision making parameters for access se-
lection
• What kind of technical beneﬁts new decision making
algorithms potentially result
• How improved network performance and service avail-
ability translate into user satisfaction
For the user aspects of the network cooperation we want
to analyze the impact of different levels of service availabil-
ity on the user experience.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows; in Sec-
tion 2, we outline related work, introduce most relevant
Ambient Networks (AN) concepts for distributed decision
making and address what is missing. User experience and
the User Satisfaction Index (USI) model are explained in
Section 3. The decision making algorithm and the used han-
dover model are illustrated in Section 4 and an example of
evaluating the discovered radio accesses is given. The sim-
ulation model and settings used in our performance evalua-
tion tests are described in Section 5. Section 6 presents the
technical simulation experiment results and analyse them
from network and operator viewpoint. Section 7 presents
the user satisfaction analysis based on the presented techni-
cal results. In Section 8, we discuss on further challenges of
108

a decision making in Future Internet like networking envi-
ronments. Finally, in Section 9, we present the conclusions
of our work.
2. Related work
2.1. Operator and network cooperation
The integrated European Union (EU) project AN pro-
poses a framework for dynamic cooperation between net-
works and business entities called Network Composi-
tion [4] [18] including both business and technical as-
pects [12].
Network sharing, international and national
roaming are all well known examples of a cooperation be-
tween operators. One of the innovations with the Ambient
Networks is that the cooperation between operators can be
established dynamically, e.g. roaming between different lo-
cal or national networks is possible without pre-negotiated
agreements.
The framework for Network Composition identiﬁes dif-
ferent levels of cooperation between networks, spanning
from more looser/weaker cooperation on towards that two
composing networks even gets integrated into just one net-
work. This is to give support for the many various ways the
network owners would like to cooperate with each other,
and which would depend not only on the speciﬁc situation
but also for example what kind of networks that would be
composed, the legal and business status, etc.
The level of cooperation is modelled out from in what
way a certain network has the right to access and control a
certain Resource in a network. Before composition, a net-
work has generally full control over its own Resources. Af-
ter composition, the network might have rights to another
network to access and control a certain set of Resources out
of its own network, as well as has been given the right to ac-
cess and control Resources in the other network. If shared
control over a certain Resource is agreed, there is a need to
create a new virtual control plane in order to manage and
operate this shared control.
2.2. Multi-radio resource management and
access selection
The AN project also considers Multi-Radio Architecture
(MRA) where cooperation between different types of RATs
is considered [19]. One example is a design of strategies
and algorithms for Radio Resource Management (RRM)
for a joint control of heterogeneous radio access networks,
e.g. WLAN, Global System for Mobile communications
(GSM) and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System
(UMTS).
A number of projects have focused on network coop-
eration and resource control in heterogeneous networks
[20] [21] [22]. In the FP5 project Monasidre a service and
network resource management platform was developed fo-
cusing on radio access networks. The FP6 projects Everest
and Aroma have been focused on strategies for efﬁcient ra-
dio resources management in heterogeneous networks for
support of end-to-end QoS. For both these project “Com-
mon RRM” has been a key feature for the management of
radio access technologies. The Aroma project also included
techno-economic evaluation of micro-cell and WLAN us-
age within 3G networks.
In the AN project not only multi-radio access is consid-
ered, but also multi-operator aspects which are one main
theme in this paper. The AN MRRM provided common
means to manage and control different radio access re-
sources over network boundaries when the network coop-
eration were supported [23]. In addition, this paper makes
use of the techno-economic modeling developed and used
in the AN project [12].
2.3. Analysis of user experience
The authors of this paper have proposed the use of a set
of performance metrics as a tool to measure user satisfac-
tion in network cooperation compared to single operator
networks. For this modeling and analysis of the user ex-
perience we have used the approach proposed by Pohjola
& Kilkki [24]. In their proposed methodology value cre-
ation of services is modeled together with how users behave
and put value on the experience. The assumptions on user
perception and rating of service quality are based on the
ﬁndings by Twersky & Kahneman [25]. They describe the
use of Expected Experience and Expected Value function
to represent user happiness. If the expected value increases
or decreases from the expected value in the user happiness
function an increment results in less additional “positive”
experience compared to a larger “negative” experience for
a corresponding decrement. This leads to different shape
of “utility curves”, i.e. how the utility for a user depends
on different parameters of a service. Examples of utility
functions as a function of bit rate are presented by Sachs et
al [26].
This kind of “behavioral economics” proposed by Twer-
sky & Kahneman has also been used by Mitomo et al [27]
for analysis of consumer preferences for ﬂat rate. Lam-
brecht & Skiera [28] have investigated consumer behavior
related to ﬂat rate charging schemes for Internet services.
Edell & Varayia [29] [30] present trial results on how
users value different qualities of service (rate) for ﬁxed In-
ternet (broadband) access. Compared to the work by Edell
& Varayia we extend the analysis to present and future wire-
less broadband services
User satisfaction in terms of throughput for multimedia
trafﬁc is analyzed in [31]. Badia et al [32] model the user

satisfaction taking into account requested Quality of Service
(QoS), data rate and also price. This model enables analysis
of impact of resource allocation on operator revenues.
Customer value related to value creation of services and
products is the staring point of the “Value model” proposed
by Lindstedt et al [33] [34].
The customer value is ex-
pressed as the ratio of satisfaction of needs and the use of
resources. The resources can be time, money, efforts, etc.
Noriaki
Kano
proposed
a
customer
satisfaction
model (Kano Model) that challenged traditional ap-
proaches [35] [36]. Different service attributes are not seen
as equal by the customers, “some attributes produce higher
levels of satisfaction than others”. Different consumers will
value different attributes differently and hence different
consumer categories can be identiﬁed.
3. User experience
In this section we will describe our approach for model-
ing and evaluation of the user experience. The results are
based both on simulations, where we estimate the service
availability for different levels of cooperation between net-
works, and on a user survey with focus on the perceived
importance of different parameters.
First we will provide an overall description (an illustra-
tion) of our approach. Next, based on established modeling
and methodology, we will discuss different ways to describe
and model the user experience of services and the related
customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction.
3.1. User perception and network coopera-
tion
Cooperation between wireless operators is usually seen
as means to reduce network costs. Network cooperation
may result in a wide spectrum of advantages for both the
users and the operators.
Network sharing will result in
lower costs for the cooperating partners. Such lower costs
may or may not result in lower prices for the users. In this
paper our main interest is the potential to improve the ser-
vice coverage and quality.
For the users the cooperation between networks with dif-
ferent coverage will lead to an increased availability and
perceived service quality and hence more satisﬁed users.
This may lead to increased usage as well as willingness to
pay for the services and hence potentially more revenues.
More satisﬁed users will be more loyal to the operator and
hence cost related to churn may be reduced [37].
As an illustration we will assume that the “User happi-
ness” is related to two factors only; the price and the quality
of the connectivity service. We consider a set of users and
an analysis over a number of time units Tj. For each time
unit of duration Tj we consider the perceived service qual-
ity Qj and the price Pj. We assume that the users in every
time unit are able to select a new type of network (assum-
ing that the network cooperation allows that), each with its
own quality and price. Equation (1) shows how “User hap-
piness” is calculated for one user.
UserHappiness =

j
QjTj/Pj
(1)
The “User happiness” increases with increasing service
availability and quality and with decreasing price. A simple
illustration on the use of this modeling approach is shown in
Figure 1. Moving users can be connected to networks with
different data rate and price characteristics. Wide cylinders
indicate networks with wide area coverage and the heights
indicate capacity (or average data rate). High data rate and
low price imply a high “User happiness”. Disconnection
results in a low or even a negative “User happiness”.
3.2. General aspects and modeling of user
perception
In Section 3.3 we will introduce a more general perfor-
mance metric called User Satisfaction Index. The USI takes
into account both the service quality, availability and the
price. In our simulation experiment, to be presented in Sec-
tion 7, the end-user perception of the service (USI) is calcu-
lated based on the technical parameters, e.g. the number of
connected mobile nodes.
One way to describe the user value or satisfaction is to
consider the total utility for the user, the “price” paid and
the corresponding production cost and proﬁt for the service
provider. From the consumer perspective there is a “sur-
plus” if the perceived user utility exceeds the price. From
the provider perspective the offered price is the production
110
International Journal On Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 2 no 1, year 2009, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/

cost plus some proﬁt. The proﬁt is kept secret to the con-
sumers and the consumers want to keep the consumer sur-
plus secret to the producers. If the producer ﬁnds out that
the consumer surplus is very high, then the price can be in-
creased without any major complaints and hence, the proﬁt
is increased. In summary, the user (consumer) tries to max-
imize the consumer surplus and the producer tries to max-
imize the proﬁt (i.e. price - cost). In addition, With the
utility model described above the consumer surplus can be
described as “added value” in different dimensions; e.g. ac-
cess to a service or product, time saving, ease of use, con-
venience, etc. However, the “price” in this utility model
usually is related to money only, but the “cost” for the con-
sumer could be extended to include other aspects where the
consumer need to “pay” in other ways, e.g. by allocating
time, to provide own work or different sorts of “inconve-
nience”.
This type of reasoning is one of the main characteristics
of the “Value model” proposed by Lindstedt et al [33]. The
Customer V alue is expressed as a ratio of “Satisfaction
of needs” (SN) and the “Use of resources” (UR); Equa-
tion (2). The resources can be any combination or function
of time (t), money (m) or effort (e), i.e. f(t, m, e).
Customer V alue = SN/UR
(2)
The function (f(t, m, e)) can most often not easily be
described in general terms. Assume for example that the
function is a product or a sum of the individual functions
f(t), f(m) and f(e). Assuming the product of separate
functions, then a very small (or zero) value, e.g. price =
0, would lead to a very large (or inﬁnite) customer value.
Assuming a sum of individual functions combination would
requires some form of “weighting”, and this would probably
be very case dependent.
Noriaki Kano has developed an approach based on “At-
tractive Quality Creation” that usually is referred to as the
“Kano Model”.
This model has been used for develop-
ment of new products and services and to determine market
strategies.
When this approach was presented Kano challenged the
traditional Customer Satisfaction Models based on an as-
sumption that “More is better”. This assumes that the bet-
ter the provider can perform on each service attribute the
more satisﬁed the customers will be. This would e.g. imply
a more or less linear relationship with different attributes,
e.g. if the bit rate of a communication service is increased
10 times then the satisfaction of the customer will increase
10 times.
In the proposed customer satisfaction model (Kano
Model) it is assumed that the performance on product
and service attributes is not equal in the eyes of the cus-
tomers. Performance on certain categories attributes pro-

duces higher levels of satisfaction than others. In addition,
different consumers can value different attributes differently
An illustration is shown in Figure 2 where three types of
different customer response to a service is shown [38]. The
traditional assumption on customer behavior, i.e.
“more
is better” is denoted “Satisﬁer”. Another type called “De-
lighter” is a customer that appreciates more attributes (and
performance ). Finally, a customer that requires that the ser-
vice always includes all possible attributes and have the best
possible performance, i.e. there are a lot of “must bes” , is
called a “Dissatisﬁer”.
In the Ofcom studies of consumer experience and de-
cision making [39] [40] a number of factors was identi-
ﬁed describing different aspects of user satisfaction. Some
factors are called “emotional”, e.g. the trustworthiness of
the brand and how highly other people rate the brand of
the operator.
Most listed factors can be denoted “ratio-
nal/tangible” and can be grouped into different categories:
• Network related factors: reliability of coverage, ease
of use of network services, reliability and speed of the
connection.
• Factors related to the price and service offers: low cost,
amount of data that can downloaded, ability to get bun-
dled offers and “value for money”
• Factors related to customer care: technical support and
customer service
3.3. Our approach - USI model
In our modeling approach we have used two starting
points i) users have some level of expectation about the ser-
vice availability and quality and ii) the impact of “no ser-
vice”, i.e. disconnection needs to be taken into account. For
the aspect of “expected experience” we have used the Twer-
sky & Kahneman ﬁndings about changes in service levels.
If the quality is decreased by some amount this has a much
bigger negative impact than the corresponding positive im-

pact of an equally large positive change. When it comes to
disconnection we model this with a negative value of the ex-
perience. A zero value for the user experience would imply
that the user “does not care”.
In our modeling we deﬁne a performance index called
User Satisfaction Index. The USI model is based on the
user happiness function of 4 levels. These levels represent
different perceived service qualities using different P val-
ues; P1, P2, P3 and P4, see Figure 3.
The value P3 represents the user happiness when the ser-
vice parameter has the expected value. P2 and P4 represent
the user experience when the service parameter is lower or
higher than the expected value. P1 corresponds to the case
when there is no service, i.e. no connection. As Figure 3
illustrates, the better the expectations are satisﬁed, the hap-
pier the user will be.
Four levels were selected based on the assumption that a
user always has a certain expectation level based on which
the perceived service quality can be evaluated. This expec-
tation level can vary based on various things like a service
type, user’s earlier experiences and so on. This assump-
tion alone leads to 3 different levels and is sufﬁcient as
such to model the quality sensitivity. However, in order to
model also the connectivity sensitivity, we need to differ-
entiate disconnections, when there is no perceived service,
from the situations where a user perceives the service qual-
ity that is worse than expected. So in order to model both
the connectivity and the quality sensitivity, 4 different lev-
els are required. The model could be extended by introduc-
ing more measurement points to model different perceived
service qualities, but for the sake of simplicity, we settled
down to 4 levels, which was a trade off between accuracy
and simplicity. It should be noted that some (non-elastic)
services might not tolerate large range of ﬂuctuation in the
service quality level resulting in an unusable service if only
the perceived service quality corresponds P2.

In the USI analysis, two different P value weight sets as
represented in Table 1 are considered. The ﬁrst set has its
focus on connectivity and it does not differentiate between
P2, P3 and P4 values and therefore the same weight value
is used for the corresponding weights β, χ and δ. The sec-
ond set extends the ﬁrst one by differentiating the quality
levels and as a result of this, different weight values are as-
signed for P2, P3 and P4 values.
The ﬁrst P value weight set corresponds the services tol-
erating quite well short temporal connection breaks like a
web surﬁng. Respectively, the second P value weight set is
typical for the real time services.
3.4. User survey for the USI - data collec-
tion
In order to verify the modeling assumptions used for the
estimation of the USI metric a user survey was conducted
on user perception of services. The survey included three
parts
• Part one consists of one open question “what are the
most important aspects for usage of wireless broad-
band and selection of service offers?”.
• The second part includes rating of different statements
on how the person would perceive different levels of
service quality, e.g.
availability and delivered data
rates.
• In the third part the persons were asked to rate “the
attractiveness” of different service offers for wireless
112
International Journal On Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 2 no 1, year 2009, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/

broadband access with different prices, data rates and
amounts of usage.
30 persons participated in this “small” survey. Two types
of users were included in the survey; telecom people (stu-
dents at technical university) and “ordinary users” (non-
engineers). The participants were asked about their expe-
rience of wireless broadband access and where the access
was used: at home, at the ofﬁce/school or in public places.
Most participants used some WLAN and/or 3G wireless ac-
cess on a regular basis.
The objective of part one was to conﬁrm that our “as-
sumed” parameters were the ones that were considered im-
portant when the service quality or service offers were eval-
uated. People were asked to list parameters that were con-
sidered important and to provide a motivation. We counted
how many persons did mention a speciﬁc aspect as having
a high degree of importance.
The objective of part two was to get an indication on
how people perceive service quality and how they “value”
different aspects. People were asked to rate (from -10 to
+10) how they did perceive service availability and the de-
livered data rate assuming a speciﬁc value of the expected
data rate.
The objective of part three was to get some insight about
reasoning when choosing between different offers, how
trade-offs are made and what parameters that were consid-
ered most important.
4. Algorithm and handover model
In this section, interdependencies between cooperation
and decision making are explained to elaborate the impor-
tance of network cooperationfor a distributed decision mak-
ing algorithm and to show how diverse environment the de-
cision making should cope with. The decision making al-
gorithm is described with a high level pseudo code and the
formula for calculating the cell rank values based on the dif-
ferent constraints is presented. The handover model used in
the simulations and its state machine is explained including
different kinds of delay contributing to the overall handover
execution time as perceived by an end-user.
4.1. Cooperation and decision making
Cooperation can be characterized with 2 different types
of agreements: Horizontal and vertical agreements. Hor-
izontal agreements represent a cooperation between net-
work providers. For example, when service continuity is
preferred for an existing connection, it requires a hori-
zontal agreement between old and new network providers.
Naturally, overlapping operator coverage areas provide a

good base for the cooperation between operators to sup-
port (seamless) inter-operator HandOvers (HOs) and load
balancing.
Vertical agreements are used between network and ser-
vice providers. This type of agreement represent a cooper-
ation based on which for instance information is collected
from a service provider to be taken into account in a dis-
tributed decision making process.
Let us consider an example of Network Composition
when being applied to MRRM, the trade-offs in regard of
the performance of access selection, and which should be
considered when composing two ANs.
In Figure 4 we let the two networks AN1 and AN2 com-
pose in order to share the control of their MRRMs, result-
ing in that a new virtual ACS12 is created with a virtu-
alized MRRM12 executing within this Ambient Control
Space (ACS). For its implementation, it is likely that each
of the two composing ANs will instantiate a virtualized
MRRM, which will communicate with each other to pro-
vide the shared control of the underlying MRRMs. Thus,
through MRRM12, the control of access selection is dis-
tributed and shared, with the capability to select any of the
available access networks (subject to their respective sta-
tus as described above). It should then be observed that
due to the distributed aspect of decision making, the time
of the control loop for access selection will be extended,
and will not be able to respond as quick as if control was
made locally (but then of course without the possibility to
roam seamlessly between the two ANs). The implementa-
tion of a distributed algorithm depends on the used com-
position type. For instance, in case of delegated MRRM
control, a decision making and access selection is more like
“centralized” solution where we should expect the time for
the control loop that should be close to the time for the local
control loops in the non-composed ANs.
A distributed decision making framework should be able
to operate on top of diverse business landscape where tech-
nical agreements between networks and players like Ser-

vice Level Agreements (SLAs) realize the business rela-
tionships. Algorithm distribution means that relevant infor-
mation is gathered and used according to existing horizon-
tal/vertical agreements in the decision making.
4.2. Decision making algorithm
Figure 5 shows the MRRM sets based on which the ac-
cess selection is done in the AN architecture. There are four
sets:
• Detected Set contains all detected access resources by
a terminal
• Validated Set contains all access resources from the
Detected Set that are validated by policy functions and
are usable
• Candidate Set contains all access resources from the
Validated Set satisfying the given requirements like the
resource requirements of a ﬂow
• Active Set contains the selected access resources for a
ﬂow
The algorithm is using these sets with a few exceptions.
First, we do not use Validated Set since our simulation
model does not include any special access policies. Sec-
ondly, our algorithm uses extended access sets, i.e., there
are two different Candidate Sets representing both terminal
and network preferences. The algorithm execution starts in
a terminal based on a trigger generated either in the terminal
or network. A terminal is naturally the only entity able to
detect what cells are in its coverage. After this, the detected
cells are communicated to the network side and where each
cell is ranked based on the network’s preferences. A termi-
nal does the same for each cell. Finally, both the terminal
and network cell ranks are considered together to decide
what cell is the best one.
Algorithm 1 shows a high level pseudo code of the ac-
cess evaluation and selection algorithm, which is executed
once in a time unit. The algorithm gets a set of mobile nodes

as input parameter. After this, the order in which the mo-
bile nodes are processed is randomized. For each mobile
node, ﬁrst the DetectedSet is constructed. This set con-
tains all radio cells a mobile node can detect and which have
enough available resources according to the mobile node’s
demands. Once the DetectedSet is done, then each cell in
it is evaluated according to Equation (5) and the resulting
cell rank value is added to the CellRanks vector. If the
cell with the highest rank is not the one, which the mobile
node is currently using, then a handover is performed and
the ActiveSet is updated with the new cell info.

In Equation (5), CRi is the cell rank value for cell i, α

β > α. For the legacy, the same weight value was used for
both algorithm weights. Table 2 shows the used weights for
each strategy.
4.3. Constraints
In the simulation model, all constraints are classiﬁed ac-
cording to two distinct factors; i) based on the value type
of a constraint (binary constraint vs. non-binary constraint)
and ii) based on how constraint’s conditions should be sat-
isﬁed (hard constraint vs. soft constraint). Table 3 lists the
used constraints, their types based on this classiﬁcation and
their constraint weights. Three ﬁrst constraints are handled
in the terminal and the rest are handled in the network side.
As illustrated in Table 3, the constraint speciﬁc weights
are only deﬁned for the soft constraints.
The hard con-
straints that are used for qualifying evaluated cells accord-
ing to the constraint’s conditions, the weight value 1 is used
in the cell rank calculation. The sum of all terminal/network
soft constraints is equal to 1.
Signal strength constraint prefers a stronger radio signal.
This is perhaps one of the most signiﬁcant constraints used
in legacy systems to perform access selection.
Selection of RAT constraint prefers the discovered cells
that are in the current RAT and it is used to minimize inter-
RAT HOs. Respectively Selection of operator constraint
prefers the discovered cells from the current operator.
Cell load levels and Service load levels constraints are
used for load balancing. The former is used to prioritize the
cells with lower load over the highly loaded ones assuming
that cells’ load levels exceed the load balancing threshold.
The latter does the same for service types.
Roaming agreement and Supported service type are both
binary hard constraints and they are used to disqualify the
cells that belongs to the operator either not having a valid
Roaming Agreement (RA) or not supporting the requested
service type.
4.4. Calculating cell ranks
Let’s consider a simple example without using the real
values to illustrates how the CellRank vectors are con-
structed and used. Let us assume that there are 2 cells (a, b)
in the DetectedSet and that there are 2 terminal constraints
(A, B) and network constraints (C, D). First, both terminal
(tcA = ⌊tca,A, tcb,A⌋, tcB = ⌊tca,B, tcb,B⌋) and network
(ncC = ⌊nca,C, ncb,C⌋, ncD = ⌊nca,D, ncb,D⌋) constraint
vectors are constructed. After this, the constraint vectors
are normalized, i.e. a vector element value is between 0
and 1, and multiplied by the constraint speciﬁc weights
and summed together resulting CandidateSets for termi-
nal (Equation (6)) and network (Equation (7)).

Next, both CandidateSets are multiplied by the termi-

and summed together resulting the CellRanks vector con-

another one for cell b (Equation (9)).

4.5. Handover model
The HO model combines the radio and application con-
nectivity states. The model consists of ﬁve states; discon-
nected, connected, session association, radio bootstrapping
and handover execution. All applications are using the same
session association delay of one time unit.
For UMTS,
it was assumed that this radio technology is attached all
the time due to its low power consumption compared to

WLAN, which is kept de-attached, if not in use. The boot-
strapping time of WLAN was set to one time unit.
For HO execution delays, the UMTS and WLAN perfor-
mance results from [11] were used as base and a “basic”
HO type within a single RAT was chosen to last one time
unit. Other types (inter-RAT and inter-operator HO) were
chosen to last twice as long as the delay of intra-RAT HOs,
i.e. two time units.
In the beginning of a simulation, the bootstrapping de-
lays are not used, thus all Mobile Nodes (MNs) are able to
move directly into the connected state assuming that enough
radio access resources and the requested service type were
available. So from an end-user perspective, the overall ef-
fective HO execution time is the sum of a HO delay, a radio
bootstrapping time and a session association time. Table 4
explains under which conditions the state transitions occur
in the handover model represented in Figure 6.
Inter-RAT HOs are not supported by the legacy al-
gorithm, which is always forced to perform a radio re-
association when switching between RATs resulting a short
period of disconnection. The Network Centric and Terminal
Centric algorithms are supporting Inter-RAT HOs inside an
operator network and between operators’ networks with the
cooperation.
5. Simulation model
In the simulation setup, two operators and two service
providers were used. Both operators had a SLA with their
service provider and they provided the same RATs, one
access network with 45 WLAN cells and another with 2
UMTS cells. WLAN cells had the radius of 80m and UMTS

cells had the radius of 600m. The simulation area was one
square kilometer. Radio cell deployment in the simulation
area is presented in Figure 7 where one operator cells are
presented with grey dashed lines and another ones’ with
black solid lines. The number of mobile nodes for the scal-
ability tests varied between 100 and 800 MNs, and for other
kinds of technical and the USI measurements 300 MNs
were used.
For the scalability and the USI tests, the Network Centric
and legacy algorithms were compared. The Terminal Cen-
tric algorithm was omitted from these tests, since as clearly
showed by other technical evaluations, it ﬁnished second
after the Network Centric algorithm.
The MNs did not follow any particular movement pat-
tern, thus they were moving according to random movement
model based on the following limitations;
• Starting locations are randomized based on the uni-
form distribution,
• The maximum speed of a MN is 10 m/s,

• There are no idle moments for any MN, and
• A random ±90◦ movement direction change probabil-
ity is used.
The MNs had an application running all the time and
there were two supported service types. Each MN had an
application usage vector deﬁning what application type is
used and when. These vectors were randomly generated
for each MN based on the uniform distribution. If a MN
requested the service type that was not available at the MN’s
current location, then the MN went to the disconnected
state and did not reserve any access resources.
Other working assumptions were as follows;
• Each MN supports WLAN and UMTS accesses,
• Each MN supports a HO between and within a RAT
and operator when the network side implements such
HO,
• Cell loads are measured in terms of an abstract mea-
sure for trafﬁc load called trafﬁc units,
• Each cell has circle shape coverage area and signal
strength S is deﬁned as Equation (11), where d is the
distance between a MN and the cell origin and R is the
cell radius, and
• Cooperation between operators also includes RA.

business environment consisting two competing operators
having overlapping radio access network coverage.
The
business environment consisted of the operator-1, who
was multi-access provider with full coverage of wide-area
UMTS over the simulation area and a few dense WLAN
hotspots (see Figure 8) and the operator-2, who was a legacy
operator providing almost full coverage of short/mid range
radio coverage (see Figure 9). The operator-1 multi-access
network supported inter-RAT HOs according to the han-
dover model described in Section 4.5. Because of the com-
petition between the operators, in these simulations, HOs
between the operator networks weren’t possible. However,
both operators had roaming agreements to provide access
for any mobile node. In other words, all mobile nodes in
the simulation could be considered as roamers and mobile
nodes could change operator networks via bootstrap (which
is more costly than handover).
In the essence, the simulation setup for the competitive
multi-operator simulations was pretty much identical to the
one presented for the USI simulations in Section 5. How-
ever there were some obvious differences, such as the in
the business environment and in the radio coverage due to
different conﬁguration.
6. Evaluation - network and operator aspects
In this section, we illustrate the technical simulation re-
sults in Section 6.1 to show how a distributed decision mak-
ing algorithm performs against the legacy algorithm and
what kind of technical beneﬁts the network cooperation re-
sults in. Additional simulation results are presented in Sec-
tion 6.2 to show how the evaluated algorithms perform in a
different kind of networking environment.

Figure 11. Disconnected MNs - Cooperation.
6.1. Network cooperation analysis
One of the main goals of these simulations is to study
what kind of (technical) beneﬁts the new distributed access
selection algorithm deﬁned in Section 4 could potentially
result with and without the network cooperation. Figure 10
illustrates the disconnectivity measurements for each eval-
uated algorithm without the cooperation. As can be clearly
seen, both the Network Centric and the Terminal Centric al-
gorithm perform better than the legacy one. An interesting
ﬁnding is how the Terminal Centric performs; in the begin-
ning it is close to the legacy but then it starts to gain gap to
the legacy and to approach the performance of the Network
Centric algorithm. A high number of disconnected MNs is
the result of two factors. Firstly, without the network coop-
eration, a MN is limited to the use of one operator, which
allows it to use only a single type of service. Secondly,
there occurs temporary congestion in the simulation area,
because the available network resources are not uniformly
distributed as explained in Section 5, i.e., WLAN hotspots
populate only approximately 38% of the simulation area.
The corresponding measurements with the cooperation
between operators are showed in Figure 11. All three algo-
rithms perform better than without the cooperation, which
was expected. The Network Centric and the Terminal Cen-

tric algorithms can better exploit the network cooperation
as showed in the ﬁgure. And this is the reason why for in-
stance a gap between the Network Centric and the legacy is
bigger than it was without the network cooperation.
The scalability measurements for the Network Centric
and the legacy algorithms are shown in Figure 12. For low
network load like with 100 MNs, it does not matter whether
the cooperation is used or not. When the network load is
increasing, the difference between the cases is becoming
clearer. It can be noted that the difference between algo-
rithms is bigger with cooperation than without it. The Net-
work Centric algorithm is able to better maintain its capa-
bility to serve users with a heavy network load.
After the network load increases over 300 MNs, the dif-
ferences between the cases with and without the coopera-
tion are getting smaller, but the Network Centric algorithm
still yields approximately 30% improvement in the network
utilization compared to the legacy. Network utilization in-
creases slightly less when the cooperation is not present due
to the lack of extended access coverage and supported ser-
vices. These results indicate that the cooperation results in
better effective network capacity and more served users. For
an average user, the cooperation means more stable connec-
tion and less connection breaks because handovers are sup-
ported by the horizontal agreement (cooperation) between
the operators.
But all these technical beneﬁts do not become without
a price; i.e., an increased number of HOs as shown in Ta-
ble 5. The Network Centric algorithm results in the high-
est number of any kinds of HOs, i.e. over two times more
intra-RAT HOs than the legacy case. In practise, this results
in more effective load balancing, which can be seen as in-
creased utilization of the available network resources. The
Terminal Centric algorithm is once again ﬁnishing second.

6.2. Competitive multi-operator analysis
Main goal of the competitive multi-operator evaluation
was to study how the Network Centric and the Terminal
Centric access selection algorithms perform against the
legacy algorithm in the case of multi-access operator and
single-radio (legacy) operator.
Key interest and main evaluation metric was set to the
network resource utilization in the operator networks, when
the requested network load from the MNs was close to
and exceeding the combined operator network capacity. In
the simulation case, it was also assumed that the service
provider has unlimited resources, thus the access network
resources were the only limiting factor. Additional results
are available in [41] [42].
One additional goal and reason for these simulations was
to verify the earlier results [43] [44] that did indicate clear
performance gain for the the Network Centric and Terminal
Centric algorithms. While the differences between the al-
gorithms decreased from the earlier results, due to the more
detailed modelling of radio access handover and bootstrap-
ping, the trends remained the same.
Figure 13 shows the network resource utilization for the
measured three algorithms with 400 MNs and the requested
network load of 600 Trafﬁc Units (TUs). The ﬁgure also in-
cludes fourth graph, which represents the theoretical max-
imum of the network resource utilization calculated by a
linear programming Linear Programming (LP) technique,
called Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) [45]. The MIP
ﬁnds one of the optimal solutions, if it exists, and reports
unfeasibility otherwise; therefore it is commonly used in
network planning to obtain (theoretical) upper bounds on
performance.
The graphs in Figure 13 illustrate the key ﬁnding of the
simulation results; In the multi-access network, the Network
Centric and Terminal Centric algorithm graphs are clearly
closer to the theoretical maximum graph than the graph of
legacy algorithm. This indicates that network resource uti-
lization is better for the new algorithms. In addition, the

simulation result conﬁrmed expected trend for the single-
radio network; studied sophisticated access selection algo-
rithms cannot improve network resource utilization in such
environment.
Moreover, Figure 13 shows that in the multi-access net-
work the highest network utilization is gained, when the
Network Centric algorithm is used.
The beneﬁt is quite
steady through out the simulation period and can be as high
as 10% compared to the legacy algorithm. Further on, the
ﬁgure shows how the Terminal Centric algorithm graph be-
haves less steadily, but still outperforming the legacy algo-
rithm most of the time.
7. Evaluation - user and usage aspects
The evaluation of user experience is based on two main
types of results. First, the results from the user survey on
“important aspects” and on the impact of different param-
eters are presented. Next, the technical results on network
utilization and service availability presented in presented in
Section 6.1 are interpreted using the User Satisfaction Index
model introduced in Section 3.
7.1. Results of user survey
The objective of part one was to conﬁrm that our “as-
sumed” parameters were the ones that were considered im-
portant when the service quality or service offers were eval-
uated. People were asked to list parameters that were con-
sidered important and to provide a motivation. We counted
how many persons did mention a speciﬁc aspect as having
a high degree of importance. The following aspects were
mentioned:
• Availability & coverage
• Data rate (speed) important

Figure 14. User perception & delivered data.
• Data rate not so important if availability is OK
• Security and reliability
• Price level
• Type of subscription
• User terminal & interface
• Ease of use
The results to a large extent conﬁrmed our own assump-
tions of selection of “most important” parameters. Parame-
ters considered to have “high importance” were “availabil-
ity & coverage” (mentioned by 85%) and “price” (men-
tioned by 80%). “Security & reliability”, “ease of use” and
“type of subscription” was mentioned by 50-60% of the par-
ticipants.
Half of the persons mentioned “data rate” as being im-
portant, but it is interesting to note that equally many an-
swered that data rate “is not so important” provided that the
service availability is satisfactory.
The results of the second part on perception of ser-
vice quality conﬁrmed the ﬁndings by Twersky & Kahne-
man [25] when it comes to the user experience as being
related to an expected value and also the “shape” of the
“user happiness” function in Figure 3. Less than expected
data rate resulted in a quick drop of perceived experience
whereas an increase resulted in a much lower increase of
the perceived experience. This is illustrated in Figure 14.
As an example consider the case where a user has a Gen-
eral Packet Radio Service (GPRS)/3G/HSDPA card in the
laptop. If the user expects an ordinary UMTS connection
then a 200 kbps data rate may correspond to the expected
service. If HSDPA is available providing a 2 Mbps data rate
the user probably not will be 10 times happier, but still hap-
pier. If HSDPA is available but the delivered data rate is 200
kbps the user experience will be much lower, all depending
on the expectation of the user. In the same way if only a
GPRS connection is available with e.g. 20 kbps data rate
the user will get even more disappointed.
Also for the service availability the perceived experience
decreased quite rapidly with a lower availability, see Fig-
ure 15 for average values. It is interesting to note that for
individuals the transition from “good” to “very bad” was

more rapid than indicated by the average values shown in
the ﬁgure. When the availability went under some (per-
sonal) threshold then the rating in most cases rapidly went
down to the lowest level (-10). This result is well in line
with the results in the Ofcom results discussed previously
indicating very high user value for coverage and availabil-
ity.
When it comes to the third part of the survey, to rate
“the attractiveness” of different service offers, no clear pat-
tern could be observed in decision making and the trade-off
analysis. It may be that the sample size was too small. It
turned out that the group “students” frequently used WLAN
(for free) but not 3G (where payment was needed). Peo-
ple in the other group either had 3G subscriptions (often
through their employer) or did not use wireless broadband
at all. However, price seems to be the single most important
parameter. The offers with lowest price got ratings between
+5 and +10 and the offers with highest prices got ratings
between -10 and 0.
7.2. Estimation of User Satisfaction Index
The average per user USI measurements with 300 MNs
using the ﬁrst P value weight set ([−1, 1, 1, 1]) are pre-
sented in Table 6 including the number of connected MNs
and the normalized and absolute USI values.
The USI
value normalization is done so that the user without any
period of disconnection has the normalized USI value 100
corresponding the absolute USI value of 1200 (= 1200 ∗
P4 weight). In the same way, a user disconnected all the
time would have the value -100 corresponding the absolute
USI value of -1200 (= 1200 ∗ P1 weight).
These measurements support the technical results
showed in Section 6. Less time being in disconnected mode
as showed in Figure 12 and increased service availability as
presented in Figure 11 naturally affect and increase the user
happiness as it can be seen from the USI values.
In practice, the ﬁrst P value weight set [−1, 1, 1, 1] rep-
resents the user behavior where the user is always equally

happy whenever connected, i.e., different quality levels are
not modeled. The negative value of P1 results in a high
impact of disconnection.
Table 7 shows the USI measurements for the second P
value weight set ([−1, 0.25, 1, 1.4]). The USI value normal-
ization is done in the same way as for the ﬁrst weight set
with the exception that now the value range of the absolute
USI value is [-1200,1650]. The second P value weight set
results in different USI values since now different quality
levels are distinguished, i.e., it does matter “how a user is
connected”. The negative weight value of P1 (disconnec-
tion) and a relatively low P2 weight value result in a nega-
tive USI value for the legacy case when the cooperation is
not supported. When the cooperation is included, the situa-
tion gets better as indicated by a higher USI value; -126 vs.
740.
Both distributed algorithms perform better than the
legacy one, but their performance is also relatively poor
without the cooperation. This was expected, since without
the cooperation both the access and service resources are
limited. The Network Centric algorithm outperforms the
Terminal Centric one but the difference is smaller than in
the case of the ﬁrst P value weight set, because in this case
the P value distribution does matter.

8. Extensions
The Network Centric and Terminal Centric algorithms
were also considering end-users’ communication needs like
the requested service type, as the service availability were
possible to consider through conﬁguration of policies and
proﬁles in the MRRMs, see Figure 4. This is especially
an important aspect when we cannot assume that all ser-
vices are equally reachable through all provided accesses.
In addition to this feature, we discuss in this section future
challenges of a decision making system while moving to-
wards an information centric networking. Thus the infor-
mation centric networking shifts the focus from looking at
network as connected host towards a network connecting
information producers with consumers. Related informa-
tion centric work is research by Van Jacobsen [46] and yet
another vision for a information centric networking is pro-
vided in [47].
One key feature is the introduction of caches in the net-
work, data can be also stored at network nodes not only
hosts.
This leads to the situation where the same infor-
mation can be available at multiple locations. The deci-
sion making system should with the information centric net-
working extended the access and services focus to also in-
clude content and delivery aspects, see Figure 16. In prac-
tise, this could mean for instance that the availability and
location of temporary content storages (“caches”) are also
taken into account while evaluating and selecting available
accesses. It is evident that the overall decision making sys-
tem needs a common objective and the overall objective
in the information centric networking is the performance
of the application interaction Inter Process Communication
(IPC) between different devices. This objective can utilize
the set of different decision making subsystems (publisher,
path and attachment subsystems) and the overall decision
121
International Journal On Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 2 no 1, year 2009, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/

algorithm can apply them in different procedural combina-
tions. How the actual algorithm and subsystems should be
combined is for further studies.
The selection of service and data source includes the ca-
pability to determinate where the suitable candidates reside,
i.e. the location of the service/data. The selection process
should in normal case only require a network resolution
function (source location selection). The resolution phase
is clearly challenging as the future network integrates mul-
tiple caches in the network and the location selection is be-
lieved to have many identical data and service located in
many places in the network. Here the ’closest’ location typ-
ically is the best selection, however the ’closest’ match can
be challenging to understand as user and provider objectives
and algorithm structure can vary.
It has to be clear that subsystem selection (subsystem
optimization) can be contradictory compared to the over-
all performance. However the general method used in the
described decision making is to include subsystem through
weights for parameters and subsystems as contention can
be addressed in a deterministic and fair way. On an algo-
rithm level is the subsystem design clearly easier said than
implemented, however the goal is to design a self-adaptable
decision making system, which could be implemented for
instance using both algorithm and constraint weights and
adjust those when needed in order to change the decision
making system’s emphasis.
SLAs used between operators and service providers rep-
resent a fairly static nature of the network conﬁguration
whereas content caches are dynamic. This inherently im-
plies that the decision making system has different timing
phases and reaction times. The proper timing consideration
should be addressed in the overall decision making. The
timing properties can be handled such that faster decision
loops contain more static parameters, e.g. faster decision
loop includes more static selection criteria. The service and
data delivery is handled through the path subsystem, how-
ever the path characteristics can change during data and ser-
vice delivery. This is similar to the fast changing character-
istics of the attachment subsystem like when the physical
radio condition changes. The timing order of selection cri-
teria updates for the overall decision making system is:
• Attachment criteria (fastest updates)
• Path criteria (faster updates)
• Publish criteria (fast and slow updates)
The future work will focus on the subsystem design of the
optimal publisher and optimal path algorithms and how they
should be interacting with the access selection process de-
scribed in this paper. Some observations, the access selec-
tion is naturally limited to the geographical area of the user
and the somewhat limited number of accesses available. On
the other hand, the design of path and publisher criteria and
algorithms are not limited to a geographical area and to de-
sign a scalable solution can be hard to achieve. The deliv-
ery based on the path subsystem is well known for the po-
tentially NP complete problem alas it is impossible to ﬁnd
an optimal solution. These challenges will be further ad-
dressed in the 4WARD project [48].
9. Conclusions
We have shown that network cooperation, e.g. based on
the Network Composition framework, has an essential role
when designing a distributed decision making algorithm.
Such algorithm is beneﬁcial for the overall user experience
when users are able to roam between access networks be-
longing to different providers. The way two provider net-
works like to compose is indeed a matter of business re-
lations and trust between operators. Nevertheless the way
composition is being performed also has an impact on the
performance of the access selection. This should generally
be taken into account when determining the wanted user
experience. As the HO statistics presented in Section 6 in-
dicates, the performance of a distributed decision making
algorithm is also based on means to support HOs between
RATs and operators indicating the importance of having
powerful and ﬂexible tools to support the network coopera-
tion.
The general indication is that the additional coverage and
supported services achieved through the network coopera-
tion will increase the amount of potential customers that can
be connected. Also, the attached customers would be more
satisﬁed when their connections are more stable. This is the
result of being able to freely select access network accord-
ing to a richer set of constraints including both end-user and
network preferences.
In general, the two new decision making algorithms
worked as expected and resulted in network performance
improvements.
When the network trafﬁc is close to or
exceeding the congestion border, the algorithms are able
to better exploit the available network resources than the
legacy algorithm. Two simulation experiments resulted in
different kinds of technical beneﬁts due to their different
simulation settings. The results in network cooperation sim-
ulations (multi-access environment) showed that the Net-
work Centric and the Terminal Centric algorithms outper-
formed the legacy one in all measured technical metrics.
Because these new algorithms were better able to exploit
the network cooperation, the gap between them and the
legacy algorithm was even bigger when the network cooper-
ation was present. The results in competitive multi-operator
simulations indicate that the power of the Network Centric
and the Terminal Centric is in their capability of balancing
the load between the available RATs in case of congestion,
whereas in a single-radio case such option is not possible. It
122
International Journal On Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 2 no 1, year 2009, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/

is also noticeable how well these two new algorithms were
able to perform under a heavy network load compared to
the legacy algorithm. When the mobile nodes’ requested
network capacity was in the range of 65%-110% of the
maximum capacity, these new algorithm were still able to
maintain approximately 30% higher number of connected
users. This shows clearly how well these algorithms scale
compared to the legacy one.
We have proposed and illustrated the use of a methodol-
ogy to model and analyze the user experience of connectiv-
ity services. A main part in the analysis is the proposed per-
formance metric called User Satisfaction Index (USI) which
provides a mapping of the value of service parameters (e.g.
data rate, availability) onto user experience. With different
types of weights used in the mapping different types of ser-
vices and different types of user perception can be modeled.
We have conducted a user survey on connectivity service
parameters and user perception of services. The results sup-
port our choice of decision making parameters and are also
in line with the parameter selection in Ofcom analysis on
customer experience. The survey also provides useful input
for selecting what kind of weight sets are used in the USI
model and measurements.
The service availability and quality is related to the
“short-term” (e.g. for each application session) user expe-
rience. Customer support and pricing have an impact on
the long customer satisfaction. The former factor is not in-
cluded in our study, but the latter is and the USI model cov-
ers it on a short-term basis. The current development with
monthly ﬂat rate subscriptions implies that the USI model-
ing and analysis will be of interest mainly for user experi-
ence of service availability, reliability and quality.
The technical simulation and USI results support each
other. In a multi-access environment, the network coopera-
tion results in gains for all evaluated algorithms indicating
also better scalability. Clear beneﬁts can be identiﬁed both
for providers and for users, the overall trafﬁc increases and
the number of disconnected users decreases. As the USI
results in Section 7 shows the type of application and the
used algorithm affect on how the gained technical beneﬁts
translates into additional user satisfaction. When the used
application is not quality sensitive, higher normalized USI
values were achieved.
During recent years, the payments from international
roaming have been one of the best source of proﬁt for the
mobile operators. However the situation is changing, when
“wild west” style roaming pricing is no longer unheeded by
the European Commission and upper bound for the roam-
ing payments have been set in Europe. This decision will
cut roaming proﬁt considerably and is likely to drive oper-
ator towards new business cases and models. The problem
in the essence in the new situation is how to cut operational
costs from the operator-to-operator trafﬁc. One solution has
been growing in size, expand the coverage geographically
and that way avoid the situation in general. But growing in
size has its limits.
Alternatively, network and service operators in Internet
have been ﬁghting similar problems already years, while
trying to minimize their transit costs. Internet’s way of solv-
ing the issue has been establishing direct peering and sib-
ling links between operator networks where applicable and
where both sides of the agreement have seen the beneﬁt.
One of the most successful “peerer” worldwide is Google,
who has enabled very vast low transit cost network through
peering agreements with non-Tier-1 operators. In the mid-
dle of Fixed Mobile Convergence, maybe this suggests that
national and local roaming (e.g. peering between operators)
is something to be taken under serious consideration also in
the mobile networking world and the concepts represented
in this article are supporting this business evolution option.
