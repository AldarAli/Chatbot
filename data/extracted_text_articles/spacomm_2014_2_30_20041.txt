Abstract—In this paper, the features of the national key science 
and technology programs of China are analyzed. The related 
management 
maturity 
models 
studied 
abroad 
are 
also 
introduced. The weights of each management factor in the 
execution process of the national key science and technology 
programs are calculated through the combination of Analytic 
Hierarchy 
Process 
and 
Entropy 
Method. 
Therefore, 
a 
management maturity model which can be suitable to the 
national key science and technology programs of China is 
proposed. China High resolution Earth Observation System 
(CHEOS), which is one of 16 national key science and technology 
programs of China, is selected as a study case. By utilizing Fuzzy 
Comprehensive Evaluation (FCE), the management maturity 
level of CHEOS is assessed. The assessment result can provide an 
aid to the decision-making of the CHEOS management. 
Furthermore, a new management method for the national key

INTRODUCTION 
A. Features of the national key science and technology 
programs of China 
To accomplish the nation goals, the national key science 
and technology programs of China are to form great strategic 
product, key technology and/or major project through 
breakthrough in core technology and integration of resource 
under specific time limits. Therefore, each key science and 
technology program is a large and complex system. In 
summary, there are 6 main features of the China national key 
science and technology programs [1][2][3]: 
(1) Government dominance: The national key science and 
technology program is an important organization form to fulfill 
the national strategic demands. The implementation of these 
projects must serve the national goals and reflect the national 
interests, i.e., the government must arrange the strategic plans 
and funding allocations under consideration of the national 
interests and future strategies. Thus, it is the government that 
supports a main area till the realization of a local leap-forward 
development and drives the breakthroughs in strategic 
industries. 
(2) Resource integration: The formation of the great 
strategic product and key common technology comes from the 
comprehensive integration of different subjects and/or various 
areas. That is to say, the implementation of the national key 
science and technology programs demand the information 
opening, the resource sharing and the collaborative innovation 
among every participating department. 
(3) Management complexity: Due to the limitation of the 
power and resource of a single existing organization, the 
interdisciplinary and interdepartmental features of the program 
are hard to overcome. Furthermore, during the implementation 
of the program, there are numbers of stake-holders and funding 
resources, which are much beyond the prowess of normal 
project management.

(4) Investment enormity: The implementation of each 
national key science and technology program demands 
enormous amount of investment. 
(5) High risk: There are different kinds of risks e.g., the 
technology risk, the policy risk and the market risk etc 
involved in the national key science and technology programs. 
Therefore, the implementation of the program is under 
influence of many factors, all degrees of uncertainty and risks. 
(6) Influence universality: The national key science and 
technology programs are to accomplish national goals and to 
meet the national demands. The results of technology research 
and application coming from these programs are the source of 
the original innovation and the proprietary intellectual property, 
hence reflect the core competitiveness of China. Ultimately, 
the outcome of the program can form a deciding influence in 
the related area and have a wide influential effect on the whole 
economy of the nation. 
B. Current project management maturity models 
1) The concept and significance of project management 
maturity model 
The project management maturity model can express the 
management ability of an organization, and the model can also 
help to implement the project according to the scheduled goal 
and condition. 
The project management maturity model provides an 
assessment method and an improvement framework for project 
management as a new idea. Based on the process of project 
management, the organization can range the level of project 
management from chaos to order and forms an upgrade 
platform step by step. The current management level is the 
basic of the higher management level. The upgrade of the 
ability of the project management maturity is also the 
accumulation of project management level. With the help of 
the project management maturity model, the organization can 
find the defects of the project management and recognizes the 
weak link of the project management and then improves the 
project management ability steadily. 
2) Organizational project management maturity model 
Organizational project management maturity model 
(OPM3) is a new standard which was released by Project 
Management Institute in 2003 [4]. 
To improve project management ability of an organization, 
and associate the project with organization strategy tightly, 
OPM3 provides the method. To confirm the state of an 
organization and formulate plans, OPM3 supplies plenty of 
knowledge for users to acknowledge project management and 
provides a standard to assess the project management ability. 
OPM3 consists of three dimensions, the first dimension 
presents maturity levels, the second dimension presents project 
management areas and project management processes, the 
third dimension presents three domains of the project 
management. The maturity level includes Standardizing, 
Measuring, Controlling and Continuously Improving. The 
project management area 
includes Project Integration 
Management, Project Scope Management, Project Timeline 
Management, Project Cost Management, Project Quality 
Management, Project Human Resource Management, Project 
Communication Management, Project Risk Management and 
Project Purchasing Management. The project management 
process includes Initiating Process Group, Planning Process 
Group, Exceuting Process Group, Monitioring & Controlling 
Process Group and Closing Process Group. The domain of the 
project management includes Project Management, Program 
Management and Portfolio Management. 
3) K-PMMM 
K-PMMM was advanced by Kerzner [5] in 2001, this 
model is mainly used by enterprise, and the level of the project 
management maturity is Common Language, Common 
Processes, 
Singular 
Methodology, 
Benchmarking 
and 
Continuous Improvement. 
The design of the questionnaire for K-PMMM is different 
from other models. The questionnaire provides several 
objective self-assessment questions in different aspects. In 
each level, there are different kinds of questions, e.g., there are 
80 choice questions in the first level. Through analyzing the 
answer to these questions, organization can find the project 
management problems of an organization may have and then 
improves the project management ability. 
4) Capability maturity model for software 
To fulfill the United State Federal Government’s appeal to 
assess the ability of software suppliers, CMU started to study 
CMM (Capacity Maturity Model) in 1986 and released the 
CMM 1.0 in 1991. 
CMM has a detailed description for the definition, 
implementation, measurement and improvement of software. 
The core of CMM treats software development as a whole 
process, organization researches the development and 
maintenance of software to accomplish the commercial goal in 
a more scientific and standard way. The maturity level of 
23

SPACOMM 2014 : The Sixth International Conference on Advances in Satellite and Space Communications

CMM includes Initial, Repeatable, Defined, Managed and 
Optimizing. 
CMM 
provides 
a 
process 
improvement 
framework by assimilating experiences from other software 
development process.  
The process of software development includes many 
activities; these activities contain technology management of 
software development, quality management, risk management 
and so on. CMM strives to improve the management ability of 
software development. The definition of each maturity level is 
depicted by CMM definitely. CMM supplies a series of 
approaches, which help the organization to improve the 
process of software development step by step. So, the ability of 
software development is improved by CMM gradually. 
II. 
MATURITY MODELS FOR NATIONAL KEY SCIENCE AND 
TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM OF CHINA 
The propose of the maturity model for national key science 
and technology programs of China is based on CMM; both the 
ability of software development and the management of 
national key science and technology program of China are 
based on process, the maturity model sees activities of 
software development as an integer, the development of the 
software is not to create breakthrough technologies solely. It is 
the same as the management of national key science and 
technology programs of China. 
A. The maturity levels and features of national key science 
and technology program of China 
The partition of each maturity level is to establish the 
standard for each maturity level, and then the definition for 
each maturity level is established according to the standard of 
each maturity level. The divide of each maturity level is based 
on some significant models. There are 5 levels: Disordered 
level, Repeatable level, Standardized level, Predictable level, 
Optimized level, the levels are showed in Figure 1, and the 
definition of each level is as follows in Table 1:

Figure 1. The five levels of maturity model 
TABLE I. 
THE DEFINITON OF EACH MATURITY LEVEL 
Level 
Definition 
Disordered 
level 
The management in this level is disordered; some 
management factors such as quality, the maturity of 
technology, investment and risk can not be predicted. The 
conditions to implement the project are poor, when the 
problems occur in the process of the project; the 
organization is likely to give up the plan that has already 
existed and turns to solve the current problems. And the 
current problems are solved by the experience of 
personal; this way can not present the ability of a system. 
Repeatable 
level 
The management in this level has an effective 
organization to manage the project, the management 
organization of the project forms relative policies about 
the project and some mature methods to solve the 
problems. The organization manages these projects 
according to experience. The management in this level is 
institutionalization and repeatability. 
Standardized 
level 
The management activities in this management level are 
full, and the standard of the organization is based on 
these series of activities. The organization makes norm 
and standard for management plan, quality and so on. 
There are plenty of useful information can be used and 
shared, it also becomes the habit of the organization. At 
the same time, some management factors such as quality, 
risk and investment can be controlled. 
Predictable 
level 
The organization makes quantitative analysis for the 
project in this management level, in different stage of the 
project, there has a quality method corresponding to the 
stage. And some management factors such as quality, risk 
and investment can be quantified in the process of 
management. This way can reduce the uncertainty during 
the process of the project. 
Optimized 
level 
The 
organization 
optimizes 
the 
process 
of 
the 
management 
continuously, 
the 
weaknesses 
and 
advantages will be found with different measures to 
achieve the goal of preventing defects. At the same time, 
the organization analyses the cost and the benefit of the 
project, and then some suggestions are proposed 
according to the analysis. The characteristic of this 
management level is that the ability of project 
management can improve continuously by itself in order 
to prevent the same mistake. 
B. The structure of national key science and technology 
program of China 
The content of each dimension is: there are 5 maturity 
levels in the 1st dimension; it includes Disordered level, 
Repeatable level, Standardized level, Predictable level, 
Optimized level, the 2nd dimension is project management 
evaluation factor system, it includes 10 management areas 
about national key science and technology program of China, 
there are 41 second-class targets, the 3rd dimension is the 
process of project management, it is the life cycle of national 
key science and technology program of China, it includes 
Initiating Process Group, Planning Process Group, Executing 
Process Group, Monitoring & Controlling Process Group, 
Closing Process Group. The structure of model is shown in 
Figure 2, the evaluation index system of national key science 
and technology program of China is shown in Table 2:

C. The quantification of national key science and technology 
program of China evaluation index system 
The implementation of the national key science and 
technology programs of China is effected by many factors; it 
may lead some unpredictable problems if these factors are 
analyzed only by experts’ experiences. Therefore, evaluation 
factor system is assessed by the methods of Analytic Hierarchy 
Process [7] and Entropy Method [8], while the management 
maturity level of the national key science and technology 
programs 
of 
China 
is 
assessed 
by 
utilizing 
Fuzzy 
Comprehensive Evaluation [9]. The design of the evaluation 
system is qualitative analysis, by utilizing the methods such as 
Analytic Hierarchy Process, it combines qualitative analysis 
with quantities analysis; it compensates the defect of quantities 
analysis.

Figure 2. The three dimension structure of national key science and 
technology program of China 
The quantification of the model of the national key science 
and technology programs of China is mainly assessed by 
Analytic Hierarchy Process and Entropy Method. The experts 
which have project management experience score the 
evaluation index system for each index, then the score of each 
evaluation index is arranged, the evaluation index is selected 
by the score of each index, and the final evaluation index 
system is formed. Then, the participants of the project score 
the weights of each management factors and a questionnaire 
about maturity level, the participants of the project are those 
people who have participated some projects; for example, if 
we want to assess the management maturity level of China 
High resolution Earth Observation System, we choose those 
people who have participated the project of China High 
resolution Earth Observation System to score the weights of 
each management factors and a questionnaire about maturity 
level, then, the model of national key science and technology 
program of China is built through calculating the weights of 
each factors, the score and the weight present the importance 
of each evaluation index, the model can be used to evaluate the

maturity level of the national key science and technology 
programs of China. 
III. 
CASE STUDY 
A. The profile of China High resolution Earth Observation 
System 
China High resolution Earth Observation System (CHEOS), 
one of the 16 national key science and technology programs of 
China is selected as a case study; the aim of this program is 
mainly to develop the satellite, airplane and stratospheric 
airship’s high resolution earth observation. With the use of 
medium and low resolution earth observation, a high 
resolution earth observation with all-weather, all-time 
capabilities are formed. 
The implementation of the CHEOS is aimed at enhancing 
the ability of earth observation, mastering the initiative of 
information and resource and grasping the situation of 
economy, resource, and environment, CHEOS is an essential 
system to our nation, it has a significant meaning for protecting 
our nation and enhancing national strength. 
B. The confirm of evaluation index and evaluation level 
(1) The confirm of evaluation index system 
There are 10 first-class targets and 41 second-class targets 
in the maturity model of CHEOS, the details of each level: 
U={U1,U2,U3,U4,U5,U6,U7,U8,U9,U10}={project planning and 
project management, project management, project quality 
control and management, project technology maturity 
management, project investment management, achievement 
and intellectual property management, risk management, 
technical 
support 
management, 
security 
and 
secrecy 
management, decision support management}. 
(2) The confirm of maturity level 
The maturity level of CHEOS: V = {V1,V2,V3,V4,V5} = 
{Disordered level, Repeatable level, Standardized level, 
Predictable level, Optimized level}. 
C. The confirm of the weights of evaluation index 
1) The confirm of initial weights via Analytic Hierarchy 
Process 
(1) The hierarchical structure of evaluation index system 
The evaluation index system is divided into 3 levels: target 
layer, criterion layer and factor layer. 
(2) Comparison and judgment matrix 
The judgment matrix is designed through questionnaire and 
expert’s graded approach, the value of each matrix reflects the 
degree of importance of each index. 
The model uses aij to represent the relative importance 
between i and j, U=(aij)m × n represents comparison and 
judgment matrix.

(3) Calculation of the weight 
The model uses the formula of UW=λ maxW to calculate 
the eigenvalues, λ max is the eigenvalue of U, W is the weight 
of evaluate factors. 
2) Update weights via Entropy method 
(1) The fundamental of Entropy method 
In information theory, information entropy is a concept to 
measure the amount of information. If a system is very orderly, 
the value of information entropy is small, and the reverse 
situation is also true. So, information entropy is a way to 
measure a system’s degree of order [6], the expression is:

        (2) 
xi represents the state of i, p(xi) represents the probability of 
i. 
For example, there are m experts score n evaluation factors, 
the judgment matrix is X=(xij)m×n, j is a factor, if the value 
between each factor is large after the expert’s assessment, the 
weight of the factor should be high, conversely, the weight of 
the factor should be low. So, the weight of each factor can be 
adjusted through Entropy Method.

Step 3: calculate the otherness factor of gj 
To the factor of j, if the otherness of xij is small, and the 
entropy of ej is big; when the entropy of ej is equal to emax, the 
factor of j makes no difference; when the value of each factor

is big and the entropy of ej is small, the factor contributes more 
to the evaluation system. 
Define G=(g1,g2,…,gn) as otherness coefficient vector, 
among gj=1-ej, if the otherness factor of gj is big, this factor 
plays an important role in the model. 
Step 4: weight adjustment 
After the factor of bj is calculated through Analytic 
Hierarchy Process, the factor is adjusted by utilizing the 
otherness coefficient of gj.

levels 
in 
CHEOS: 
V={V1,V2,V3,V4,V5}={Disordered

The value of each maturity level is: Disordered level = 1, 
Repeatable level = 2, Standardized level = 3, Predictable level 
= 4, Optimized level = 5. 
The weight vector is: V=(1,2,3,4,5)T 
(2) The weight of each criteria layer 
The weight of criteria layer and factor layer are presented 
by vector through Analytic Hierarchy Process and Entropy 
Method: Define W = (W1,W2,W3,…,W10) as the weight of 
criteria layer, define w1 = (w11,w12,w13,w14,w15,w16),…,w10 = 
(w101,w102,w103) as the weight of each factor layer.

E. The method to analysis and improvement the 
management factors 
Si is a vector of criteria layer i (i=1,2,3,…,10): 
Si = Ri×VT                          (9) 
The coordinate system is divided into 4 areas in order to 
improve the indexes of CHEOS, X axis represents the score of 
each index, and Y axis represents the weight of each index, 
then the indexes are labeled in the coordinate system, the 
management index is improved via analyzing the points in the 
coordinate system. The coordinate system is as follows in

Figure 3. The analysis and improvement of the management factors 
Area 1: Low weight, low score 
The management activities in this area have a low weight 
and low score, low score illustrates the project manager pays 
little attention to these management activities. Low weight 
illustrates these management activities have poor importance 
in the process of management, according to the coordinate 
system that can conclude these management factors are the 
weaknesses of the CHEOS, compare with the activities in area 
4, those activities also has a low score, but the weight of these 
activities in area 1 is lower than area 4, so the management of 
CHEOS should pay more attention to area 4. And the activities 
in area 1 should be improved correspondingly. 
Area 2: Low weight, high score 
The activities where belong to this area have a low weight, 
in compare with a high score, manager pays enough attention 
to these kind of activities, but these activities are not so 
important compare with the activities in area 4 because of its 
27

low weight. So, more attention should be paid in other area 
other than the activities in area 2. 
Area 3: High weight, high score 
The activities in this area both have a high weight and 
score. These activities play an important role in project 
management, and manager pays enough attention to these 
activities. These activities don not need to be improved so 
frequently, but these activities have a significant meaning in 
the national key science and technology programs of China, so 
the management should focus on these activities continuously. 
Area 4: High weight, low score 
The activities in area 4 have a low score, but the weight of 
these activities are high, so the activities in this area have an 
important function in the process of CHEOS, but the 
management of the CHEOS pays not enough attention to these 
activities, so the management ability in these aspects are poor. 
So, these activities are the objects which the project mainly 
improves. The improvement of these activities can promote the 
maturity level of the CHEOS and urge the implementation of 
the project successfully. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper studied the modeling of the project management 
maturity for the national key science and technology programs 
of China by updating the current management maturity models. 
The applicability of the proposed management maturity model 
with consideration of the features of the programs is 
demonstrated through a real case study, which proves the 
compatibility of the proposed model with the present 
conditions of China. 
The paper aims to introduce the maturity model into the 
management of the national key science and technology 
programs of China. According to the process and the result of 
research, the evaluation index system is to be improved 
through combining more management features of the national 
key science and technology programs. Although the maturity 
model is successfully introduced into the management of the 
programs, the method of assessment is still simple, mostly 
analytic hierarchy process or fuzzy comprehensive evaluation; 
so, that further work is planned to make improvement. 
In conclusion, the management of the national key science 
and technology programs of China is a complex systems 
engineering issue. The introduction of the maturity model is 
just an explorative trial. Therefore, more theoretical and 
practical research on the application of the maturity model for 
the management of the national key science and technology 
programs of China is still needed.
