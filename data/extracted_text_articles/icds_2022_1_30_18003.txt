Abstract— Information systems increasingly surge not only in 
the topics areas of task automation in business and personal 
contexts, but also in the areas of the recommendation of 
content and information that can be consequentially used to 
support business or individual decisions. Thus, the design of 
these information systems needs to expand its considerations 
above the user and towards the effects the system 
implementation has on the users affected by the actions that 
result from the application of the system. The scope of the 
affected users can be as broad as a cultural circle or the 
society. This extended abstract introduces the term of socially 
aware information systems, hence those information systems 
that consider their impact from the design, requirements 
engineering and testing, into the focus of the design science and 
information system research. 
Keywords- socio-technical systems; systems engineering; 
software engineering, socially aware information systems. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
With information technologies striving to automate and 
to support many of the activities in business and private 
context, the effects of their application on the users as well 
as the society, where these technologies are engaged, are 
increasingly visible. Although, it is acknowledged among 
managers and system users that adopting a socio-technical 
approach to system development leads to systems that are 
more acceptable to end users and deliver better value to 
stakeholders [1], this socio-technical design approach is 
only slowly gaining recognition in the software engineering 
and software user community. 
Given the public discussions on machine learning based 
systems (MLS), value-based software engineering has 
gained popularity in public discussion. As when digital 
products are being designed, their (negative) effects such as 
the effects on the environment or the society should be part 
of the public discussion and responsibility that are not (and 
maybe should not be) regulated, but can be supported by 
socially acceptable IT artefacts [2] and ethical frameworks. 
Recommendations, ethical frameworks and principles for 
MLS design merge in the business and legal environments, 
e.g., in [3]–[6]. Nevertheless, ethical aspects can also be 
interpreted during the software design differently [7].  
Following the development of the value-sensitive design 
[8], [9], user-centered design [10], [11], design thinking and 
socio-technical systems design [1] over the years, the term 
“socially aware information systems” (SAIS) is proposed. 
The term describes an information system that considers 
users beyond the ones that are directly involved with the 
information system and includes affected users and system 
stakeholders into its requirements analysis and testing. The 
affected user is explicitly singled out of the composed term 
“stakeholder” [12] for a specific focus during the 
requirement analysis. SAIS are thus defined as IT artifacts 
that extend the design of socio-technical systems by 
comprising the consideration of the effects of their use and 
implementation on a scale that includes the directly 
involved process actors but also the individuals affected by 
the results of the system implementation and use. This scope 
can be as broad as the customers affected by the information 
system or the society that includes these information 
systems into its interaction and social exchange, e.g., in its 
administrative processes. This focus is especially important 
in domains where these systems build or use personal-
specific data, e.g., decision automation and decision support 
in human resources domain.  
Participation, Transparency, Human Autonomy, Human 
Rights and Auditability are suggested based on the ALTAI 
criteria for MLS introduced by the European Commission as 
main pillars of the design of an information system that is 
socially aware. SAIS thus follow the thought schools of 
value sensitive [8] and value-based [13] design, problem 
orientation in design science research [14] and ethical 
information systems design [15]. Evidently, Information 
Systems Research (ISR) should manifest its leading role in 
pursuing practices for the creation of IT artifacts that are not 
only technically innovative but also socially acceptable.  
SAIS extends the characteristics of socio-technical 
systems by Baxter and Sommerville [1] with following 
additions: 
 
SAIS address a (business) problem with a resulting 
significant increase in efficiency of business 
operations or significant advantages for the process 
workers or affected users. 
 
SAIS does not use behavioral approaches to un-
ethically draw on user’s or affected user’s data. 
 
SAIS considers users and affected users in the 
requirement analysis. 
 
SAIS has audit and testing mechanisms that consider 
the mid-term effects of its application on the user, 
the affected users and their environment. 
 
SAIS has a laboratory testing environment and is 
subject to regular audits concerning the stated 
values, but at least the values of Participation,

Transparency and Human Autonomy and Human 
Rights. 
 
SAIS use includes a definition of the contextual, 
cultural and value-based scope of the environment it 
shall be implemented in and can lead to accordant 
modifications, e.g. in the context of data processing. 
 
SAIS has a feedback mechanism that allows a flow 
of information between the user and SAIS, as well as 
affected users and SAIS that enables necessary 
changes in the SAIS functionalities and architecture. 
Following this reasoning, the requirements engineering 
for socially aware information systems should apply the 
analysis of ethical and legal issues that appear during the 
design of the system’s features and its usage. As methods 
scenario analysis, surveys, workshops documented with use 
case analysis and user stories can be applied. As personas 
external actors need to be considered. Here, the actors 
“user” and the “affected user”, i.e., an actor affected by the 
results of the information system application, need to be 
differentiated. 
II. 
CONCLUSION 
This extended abstract motivated and presented the term 
of socially aware information system that extends the context 
of design science research, user- centered and value-sensitive 
design as well as the term of socio-technical systems. The 
necessity of this extension was motivated with the upcoming 
prevalence of data-based systems that are increasingly used 
to provide recommendations, information and support 
decisions on individual and business scales. Involving this 
term in the research and practice will allow including a mid-
term thinking in the design of information systems as well as 
robust testing plans that consider mid- and long term effects 
of the system use on its direct and affected users. Also the 
use of behavioral science for increased engagement of the 
system can be critically tested for the expected and actual 
added value within the SAIS design.
