with an internal core of 6.8 µm and a glass shell of 14.7 µm
radius was tested. The magnetoimpedance sensor was a 5 mm
long piece microwire with a small pick-up coil of 80 turns
wounded around the microwire. The saturation magnetization,
anisotropy field of the microwire and off-diagonal component
of impedance at 4 MHz frequency were investigated in the
temperature range of −20 to +80 C. The measured data were
used to determine the influence of these parameters on the
temperature dependence of the pick-up coil elecro-motive force
amplitude. It was found that the change of the offset drift near
the zero magnetic field is ~ 0.125 (A/m)/C and the coefficient
of sensitivity is about +2.6%/ C.

INTRODUCTION
Recently, much attention has been paid to the study of
the Giant Magneto-Impedance (GMI) effect in soft magnetic
materials, which involves changes in the complex resistance
of the ferromagnetic conductor Z(H), when exposed to an
external magnetic field H. The increased interest in the GMI
effect is associated primarily with the possibility of creating
on its basis inexpensive, miniature and highly sensitive
magnetometers for various technical applications. Among
the materials with the GMI effect, the best results were
achieved in amorphous ferromagnetic microwires in a glass-
coated microwire produced by the Tailor-Ulitovsky [1]
method.
The best microwires are characterized by an ideal
cylindrical shape, a small number of defects per unit length,
a uniform distribution of magnetization and very small
values of the magnetic anisotropy field (~ 100 A/m and
less). In cobalt-rich microwires with a total radius of 5-15
micrometers, high values of the GMI ratio (Z/Z ~ 600%
[2]) have been obtained. Laboratory models of GMI
magnetometers with an equivalent magnetic field noise level
less than 10 pT/Hz1/2 in the low frequency range from 0 to
1 kHz have been developed on the basis of such microwires
[3][4]. One of the problems of such magnetometers is their
strong temperature instability. Studies conducted by [5]
have
shown
that
the
temperature
instability
of
such
magnetometers can be up to 100 nT per °C or more. To
explain such a high temperature instability, a simplified
model of the off-diagonal GMI effect is proposed in this
work, and the results of the temperature studies of the GMI-
sensor are presented.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section II
presents the description of the GMI sensor, research
equipment and measurement methods. Section III describes
the behavior of the GMI sensor in a temperature range of 20
°C to +80 °C, and a simplified model of the microwire’s
off-diagonal GMI effect. The results of modeling are
compared with experimental data. Conclusions are given in
Section IV.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Measurements were carried out on a GMI sensor, in
which 5 mm segment of the glass-coated microwire, radius
of a ferromagnetic core r0 of about 6.8 µm, total radius
14.7 µm and the composition of Co69Fe4Cr4Si11B12 was
used as a sensitive element [6]. To register the signals
proportional to the off-diagonal impedance component
Zz(f,H), a pick-up coil with radius 0.25 mm, containing N =
80 turns of copper wire with a diameter of 40 µm was
wounded onto the microwire.
For the off-diagonal operation, the microwire was
excited by sinusoidal current Iac with a frequency of f =
4 MHz and amplitude of 1.0 mА. In addition, a small direct 
bias current Idc. = 2.0 mA was applied to the microwire. The

scheme of excitation and registration of the GMI sensor
signal is shown in Figure 1. The Electro-Motive Force
(EMF) pick-up coil signal was amplified and then detected
by a lock-in detector with 4 MHz reference signal. During
GMI measurements, the GMI-sensor was placed within a
solenoid powered by a linearly varying low-frequency
current. The solenoid could generate the axial magnetic field
of amplitude ± 1000 A/m. The temperature dependences of
the off-diagonal GMI response versus the applied magnetic
field and the offset drift were measured.

At temperature measurements, the GMI sensor was
placed
inside
the
temperature
chamber
providing
temperature in the range of -20 °C to +80 °C. To protect
against external magnetic field, a magnetic shield with a
shielding coefficient K ~ 1000 was used. The residual
magnetic field in the magnetic shield did not exceed 50 nT.
Magnetic hysteresis loops of the microwires were
measured using a conventional Quantum Design Physical
Property Measurement System (PPMS) at the temperature
range of -20 °C to +80 °C.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
A.
The temperature off-diagonal response of the GMI
sensor
Figure 2 shows the amplitude of 4 MHz EMF signals,
induced in the pick-up coil, versus the longitudinally
applied magnetic field Нz at different temperatures -20 C,
20 C and 80 C. These curves correspond to the off-
diagonal responses of the GMI sensor.
The inset in Figure 2 shows the behavior of the output
voltage (in arbitrary units – a.u.) of the GMI sensor for two
values of applied magnetic fields (0 A/m - circles, 13 A/m -
squares) depending on the heating temperature. The output
voltage grew monotonically with increasing temperature.
The sensitivity U/H for the low magnetic field region at -
20 C is 0.012 a.u./A/m and 0.032 a.u./A/m at 80 C. This
represents an increase of 260 % and corresponds to a
temperature coefficient of sensitivity of +2.6%/ C. The
EMF offset (the top curve on the inset in Figure 2) varies
from 0.06 a.u. at -20 C to 0.156 a.u. at +80 C. The
difference corresponds to a change of 12.5 % of the full
voltage scale at -20 C. This change corresponds to a
temperature coefficient of the offset drift of 0.125 A/m / C
(157 nT/C).
B.
Low frequency model of the off-diagonal sensor
To interpret the temperature behavior of the GMI sensor,
we used a simplified model for the case of microwire
excitation by Alternating Current (AC) Iac with a relatively
low frequency, when the skin depth is more than the
microwire radius. In addition, it is assumed that at each
point of the microwire, a magnetization reaches its limit
value
Ms
and can change only in direction.
Under the above conditions, in the external longitudinal
field Hz and circumferential field H, the direction of the
magnetization
vector
Ms
at
each
microwire’s
point
corresponds to the minimum energy and is determined by
the equality:

of the microwire magnetization average value under the
influence of circular and longitudinal magnetic fields.

The EMF response can be expanded in Fourier series in
multiple frequencies f, 2f, 3f, … As an example, the EMF
calculation result at the frequency f is shown in Figure 4,

On the basis of the proposed model, it can be shown that
the dependence of the EMF pick-up coil amplitude in the
field region of - Ha < Hz < + Ha (Figure 4) is approximately
described by the following expression:

This dependence is shown in Figure 4 as a short dotted

that depend on temperature. These are the saturation
magnetization Ms and the anisotropy field Ha.

Temperature effect estimation
To simulate the temperature behavior of the GMI sensor,
we measured the temperature dependences of relative
saturation magnetization, Ms/Ms40(T), and anisotropy field,
Ha(T). The results of these measurements are shown in
Figure 5.
The temperature dependence of relative magnetization
with an applied magnetic field of 104 A/m is presented in
Figure 5 by square symbols (left axis). The data were
normalized on the saturation magnetization measured at
temperature -40 C.
Under heating treatment, the relative
magnetization decreases slowly with increasing temperature
from -20 C to 100 C. It varies between 0.96 at -20 C and
0.82 at +100 C, which is a decrease of 14%. This
percentage corresponds to a temperature coefficient of
0.12%/C.
The temperature dependence of the anisotropy field is
presented in Figure 5 by circle symbols (right axis).
The
value of the anisotropy field for each temperature was
determined as the value of the field corresponding to the
maximum of the off-diagonal response (Figure 2). Under
heating treatment, the anisotropy field decreases with
increasing temperature from -20 C to 80 C. It varies
between 75 A/m at -20 C and 40 A/m at +80 C., which is
a decrease of 53%. This percentage corresponds to a
temperature coefficient of 0.53%/C.
Using the experimental data in Figure 5, we estimated the
ratio of the coefficient Ms/Ha
2 from expression (4) for
temperature values -20 C and +80 C. This ratio is of order
of 5.3/1.7 ~ 3.1. The same ratio for the sensitivity U/H,
obtained from the experiment (part III.A.), gives value
0.156/0.06 = 2.6. The obtained agreement between the
experimental and model data indicates the possibility of
using the proposed approach for the analysis of the
temperature properties of microwires.

CONCLUSION
In
conclusion,
we
have
studied
the
problem
of
temperature stability of off-diagonal GMI sensors based on
Co69Fe4Cr4Si11B12
glass
coated
microwires.
In
the
temperature range of −20 to +80 C, the investigated
microwires were characterized by high offset drift 0.125
(A/m)/C and large temperature sensitivity +2.6%/ C. The
obtained temperature dependences off-diagonal response are
satisfactorily explained in the framework of a simple model.
The proposed model shows that the main sources of
temperature
instability
of
the
GMI
sensor
are
the
temperature dependences of the saturation magnetization
and anisotropy field of the microwire. The improvement of
these parameters will increase the temperature stability of
the GMI sensor.
It is known that thermal treatment of
microwires significantly affect the temperature behavior of
GMI [8][9]. The data obtained show that the heat treatment
should be carefully selected, according to the effect on the
anisotropy field, to ensure the thermal stability of the
microwires.
