Abstract—The concept of request/response and relative pose 
estimation for the management of the trajectory is used, in a 
two-way-two-way traffic lights controlled crossroad, using 
Vehicular Visible Light Communication (V-VLC). The 
connected vehicles receive information from the network and 
interact with each other and with the infrastructure. In 
parallel, an Intersection Manager (IM) coordinates the 
crossroad 
and 
interacts with 
the 
vehicles 
using 
the 
temporal/space relative pose concepts. V-VLC is performed 
using the street lamps, the trafﬁc signaling and the headlamps 
to broadcast the information. Data is encoded, modulated and 
converted into light signals emitted by the transmitters. As 
receivers and decoders, optical sensors with light filtering 
properties are used. Cooperative localization is realized in a 
distributed way with the incorporation of the indirect vehicle-
to-vehicle relative pose estimation method. A phasing traffic 
flow is developed, as Proof of Concept (PoC) and a generic 
model of cooperative transmission is analysed. Results 
expresses that the vehicle’s behavior (successive poses) is 
mainly influenced by the manoeuvre permission and presence 
of other vehicles.

INTRODUCTION 
High-end models of last generation vehicles nowadays 
are equipped with hundreds of embedded computers and 
sensors which allow them to perceive their surroundings, 
and interact with it in semi-autonomous, and eventually, 
fully-autonomous fashion. Although at a slower pace, the 
road infrastructure has evolved as well, with adaptive traffic 
lights. Next step in the evolution course of transportation 
systems is to adopt the concept of communication and 
enable information exchange between vehicles and with 
infrastructure (V2I) shifting the paradigm from autonomous 
driving to cooperative driving by taking advantage of 
Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications [1] [2]. The 
objective is to increase the safety and throughput of traffic 
intersections using cooperative driving [3] [4].  
Vehicular Communication Systems are a type of 
network in which vehicles and roadside units are the 
communicating 
nodes, 
providing 
each 
other 
with 
information, such as safety warnings and traffic information 
[5].Vehicular networking applications can take advantage of 
the LED-equipped lighting modules and transportation 
infrastructure to realize V-VLC. Here, the communication 
can be performed using the street lamps, the trafﬁc signaling 
and the headlamps. 
The goal is to develop a cooperative system that supports 
guidance services. An edge/fog based architecture is 
proposed. Here, the streetlights and traffic lights, through 
VLC, report its geographical positions and specific 
information to the drivers and its infrastructure is reused to 
embed the edge/fog nodes in them. Using this architecture, 
an Intersection Manager (IM) can increase the throughput of 
the intersection by exchanging information and directing the 
incoming Connected Autonomous Vehicles [6] [7] [8] [9]. 
Cooperative localization is realized in a distributed way 
with the incorporation of the indirect Vehicle-to-Vehicle 
(V2V) relative pose estimation method. The vehicle gathers 
relevant data from neighboring vehicles and estimates the 
relative pose of them. In this paper a V2X traffic scenario is 
stablished and bidirectional communication between the 
infrastructure and the vehicles is tested, using the VLC 
request/response concept. Tetra-chromatic white sources are 
used to broadcasting the geolocation and traffic information. 
The receiver modules include a light controlled filter [10] 
recovering the transmitted information.  
This paper is organized as follows. After the 
introduction, in Section 2, the V-VLC system is described 
and the scenario, architecture, communication protocol, 
coding/decoding techniques analyzed. In Section 3, the 
experiential results are reported and the system evaluation 
performed. A phasing traffic flow diagram based on V-VLC 
is developed, as PoC, to control the arrival of vehicles to the

intersection. Finally, in Section 4, the main conclusions are 
presented. 
II. VEHICULAR VISIBLE LIGHT COMMUNICATION 
SYSTEM 
A. 
Scenario and architecture 
The V-VLC make use of outdoor light sources (street 
lamps and traffic lights) as the access points, which can 
serve for both lighting and communication purposes, 
providing drivers with outdoor wireless communications. 
The system is composed by two modules: the transmitter 
and the receiver located at the infrastructures and at the 
driving cars. The block diagram of the V-VLC system is 
presented in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Block diagram of the VLC system. 
To realize both the communication and the street 
illumination, white light tetra-chromatic sources are used 
providing a different data channel for each chip. At each 
node, only one chip of the LED is modulated for data 
transmission, the Red (R: 626 nm), the Green (G: 530 nm), 
the Blue (B: 470 nm) or the Violet (V) while the others 
provide constant current for white perception. 
Data is encoded, modulated and converted into light 
signals emitted by the transmitters. Modulation and digital-
to-analog conversion of the information bits is done using 
signal processing techniques. The signal is propagating 
through the optical channel and a VLC receiver, at the 
reception end of the communication link, is responsible to 
extract the data from the modulated light beam. It 
transforms the light signal into an electrical signal that is 
subsequently decoded to extract the transmitted information. 
The core element of a receiver is a Silicon-Carbon (SiC) 
photodetector. This component converts the optical power 
into electrical current. The VLC photosensitive receiver is a 
double 
pin/pin 
photodetector 
based 
on 
a 
tandem 
heterostructure, p-i'(a-SiC:H)-n/p-i(a-Si:H)-n sandwiched 
between two conductive transparent contacts [10]. Due to its 
tandem structure, the device is an optical controlled filter 
able to identify the wavelengths and intensities of the 
impinging optical signals. Its quick response enables the 
possibility of high speed communications. The generated 
photocurrent is processed using a transimpedance circuit 
obtaining a proportional voltage. The obtained voltage is 
then processed until the data signal is reconstructed at the 
data processing unit (digital conversion, decoding and 
decision [11, 12]). 
A V2X communication link, in a traffic light controlled 
crossroad, was simulated.  
In Figure 2a the lighting plan and generated joint 
footprints in the crossroad region (LED array=RGBV 
modulated color spots) is displayed. To build the I2V it is 
proposed a simplified cluster of unit square cells in an 
orthogonal topology that fills all the service area [12, 13]. 
The grid size was chosen in order to avoid an overlap in the 
receiver from the data from adjacent grid points. The 
geometric scenario used in the experimental results uses a 
smaller size square grid (2 cm), to improve its practicality. 
Each transmitter,    X i,j, carries its own color, X, (RGBV) as 
well as its horizontal and vertical ID position in the 
surrounding network (i,j). In the PoC, was assumed that the 
crossroad is located in the intersection of line 4 with column 
3, and the emitters at the nodes along the roadside. To 
receive the I2V information from several transmitters, the 
receiver must be located at the overlap of the circles that set 
the transmission range (radial) of each transmitter. The nine 
possible overlaps, defined as fingerprint regions, are also 
displayed in Figure 2a for each unit cell. Thus, each LED 
sends a message that includes the synchronism, its physical 
ID and the traffic information. When a probe vehicle enters 
the streetlight´s capture range, the receiver replies to the 
light signal, and assigns an unique ID and the traffic 
message [13]. At each moment, t, the receiver identifies the 
footprint, finds it centroid and stores it as the reference 
point. All observations for a single section are jointly 
analyzed to produce an estimate of the occupied lane, 
direction and travel time along the considered section. The 
received message, acts twofold: as a positioning system and 
as a data receiver.  
In Figure 2b we propose a draft of a mesh cellular hybrid 
structure to create a gateway-less system without any 
external gateways needed [14 ]. As illustrated the street 
lights, in this architecture, are equipped with one of two 
types of nodes: A “mesh” controller that connects with other 
nodes in its vicinity. These controllers can forward 
messages to the vehicles (I2V) in the mesh, effectively 
acting like routers nodes in the network. A “mesh/cellular” 
hybrid controller, that is also equipped with a modem 
provides IP base connectivity to the Intersection Manager 
(IM) services. These nodes acts as border-router and can be 
used for edge computing. The proposed short-range mesh 
network enables edge computing and device-to-cloud 
communication, by ensuring a secure communication from a 
street light controller to the edge computer or datacenter, 
through a neighbor traffic light controller with an active 
cellular connection.

B. 
Multi-vehicle cooperative localization  
The combined estimation of both position and 
orientation (pose estimation) of the vehicle is important to 
path definition. In a two-dimensional coordinate systems the 
pose, q(t) = [x(t), y(t), (t)], is defined by position (x,y) and 
orientation angle , with respect to the coordinate axes. 
Let’s consider that qi(t,t´) represents the pose of vehicle i at 
time t´ relative to the pose of the same vehicle at time t and 
qij(t) denotes the pose of vehicle j relative to the pose of 
vehicle i at time t. These three types of information qi (t), qi 
(t,t´)and qij (t) compose the basic elements of a pose graph 
for multi-vehicle cooperative localization [15].  
An 
Indirect 
V2V 
Relative 
Pose 
Estimation 
(InDV2VRPE) method is proposed and exemplified in 
Figure 2c. Here, when two vehicles are in neighborhood, the 
geometric relationship between them can be indirectly 
inferred via a chain of geometric relationships among both 
vehicles positions and local maps. Let´s consider two 
neighboring vehicles. Both vehicles, having self-localization 
ability based on I2V street lamps communication perform 
local Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). The 
follower vehicle can be localized by itself, as in single 
vehicle localization, qi (t), and can also be localized by 
combining the localization result of vehicle leader and the 
relative localization estimate between the two vehicles,      
qij (t). For a vehicle with several neighboring vehicles, it 
uses the indirect V2V relative pose estimation method to 
estimate the relative pose of each neighboring vehicle one 
by one and takes advantage of the data of each neighboring 
vehicle.  
 
C. 
Color phasing diagrams 
Four traffic flows were considered (Figure 2a): One from 
West (W) with three vehicles (a, c, d) approaching the 
crossroad, Vehicle a with straight movement and Vehicle c 
and Vehicle d with left turn only. In the second flow, 
Vehicle b from East (E), approaches the intersection with 
left turn only. In the third flow, Vehicle e, oncoming from 
South (S), has e right-turn approach. Finally, in the fourth 
flow, Vehicle f, coming from North, goes straight.  
For the intersection manager crossing coordination, the 
vehicle and the IM exchange information through two 
specific types of messages, “request” (V2I) and “response” 
(I2V) as exemplified in Figure 2b. Inside the request 
distance, an approach “request” is sent, using as emitter the 
headlights. To receive the “requests”, two different receivers 
are located at the same traffic light, facing the cross roads 
(local controller of the traffic light). Concretely, when one 
head vehicle enters in the infrastructure´s capture range of 
one of the receivers (request distance) the request message 
is received and decoded by the receiver facing the lane 
which is interconnected to the Intersection Manager. Those 
messages contain the assigned ID positions, speeds, and 
flow directions of the vehicles. The “request” contains all 
63

the information that is necessary for a vehicle’s space-time 
reservation for its intersection crossing. Intersection 
manager uses this information to convert it in a sequence of 
timed rectangular spaces that each assigned vehicle needs to 
occupy the intersection. 
An intersection 
manager’s 
acknowledge is sent from the traffic signal over the facing 
receiver to the in car application of the head vehicle. The 
response includes both the infrastructure and the vehicle 
identifications and the “confirmed vehicle” message. Once 
the response is received (message distance in Figure 2c), the 
vehicle is required to follow the occupancy trajectories 
(footprint regions, Figure 2a) provided by the intersection 
manager. If a request has any potential risk of collision with 
all other vehicles that have already been approved to cross 
the intersection, the control manager only sends back to the 
vehicle (V2I) the “response” after the risk of conflict is 
exceeded. The use of both navigation and lane control signs 
to communicate lane restrictions is demanding. Downstream 
from that location (request distance), lane restrictions should 
be obeyed. Vehicles may receive their intentions (e.g., 
whether they will turn left or continue straight and turn 
right) or specifically the need to interact with a trafic 
controler at a nearby crossroad (message distance). In the 
sequence, a traffic message coming from a transmitter 
nearby the crossroad will inform the drivers of the location 
of their destination (i.e., the intended intersection exit leg).

Figure 3: a) Physical area, color poses and channelization. b) 
Representation of a phasing diagram. 
In the proposed architecture (Figure 2b), the major 
operational requirement of IM is the ability to register 
synchronized measurements in a common frame of 
reference. The effective solution is to maintain a buffer of 
time-stamped measurements and register them as a batch 
using a temporal sliding window. The vehicles can use such 
techniques to find their “color poses” at regular time 
intervals. We have assumed four “color poses” linked with 
the radial range of the modulated light in the crossroad 
nodes (dotted arcs in Figure 3a). As depicted in Figure 3a, 
where the physical area and channelization are shown, the 
West straight, South left turn and West right turn 
manoeuvres correspond to the ”Green pose”. “Red poses” 
are related with South straight, East left turn and South right 
turn manoeuvres, “Blue poses with East straight, North left 
turn and East right turn and finally “violet poses with North 
straight, West left turn and North right turn manoeuvres, In 
Figure 3b, a color phasing diagram is displayed. Here, since 
two movements can proceed simultaneously without 
conflict hence two of the timing functions will always have 
simultaneous control.  
 
D. VLC Communication protocol and coding/decoding 
techniques 
An on-off keying (OOK) modulation scheme was used 
to code the information. Synchronous transmissions based 
on a 64- bits data frame are analysed. 
An example of the used codification to drive the headlamps 
LEDs of a vehicle, coming from N, located in in footprint 
#1 (R3,4, G3,3, B4,4, and V43) moving to South is illustrated in 
Figure 4a.  
Different control fields are used depending on the driver 
motivation. All messages, in a frame, start with the header 
labelled as Sync, a block of 5 bits. The same 
synchronization header [10101], in an ON-OFF pattern, is 
imposed simultaneously to all emitters. The next block (ID) 
gives the location (x, y coordinates) of the emitters inside 
the array (Xi,j,k). Cell’s IDs are encoded using a 4 bits binary 
representation for the decimal number. So, the next 8 bits 
are assigned, respectively, to the x and y coordinates (i, j) of 
the emitter in the array. If the message is diffused by the IM 
transmitter, a pattern [0000]) follows this identification, if it 
is a request (R) a pattern [00] is used. The steering angle () 
completes the pose in a frame time. Eight steering angles 
along the cardinal points and coded with the same number 
of the footprints in the unit cell (Figure 2a) are possible 
from a start point to the next goal. The last block is used to 
transmit the traffic message. A stop bit is used at the end of 
each frame. 
The decimal numbers assigned to each ID block are 
pointed out in the Figure. Results show that, in network, 
R3,4,S ; G3,3,S; B4,4,S and V4,3,S are the transmitted node 
packets, in a time slot, from the crossroad. In this location, 
the driver receives his request message [pose, and traffic 
needs] from the infrastructure. This allows it movement 
across the crossroad to South (violet code 9, =270º), 
directly from the current point (#1) to the goal point (#9). 
The calibration of the receiver supplies an additional tool to 
enhance the decoding task. The calibration procedure is 
exemplified in Figure 4b. Here the MUX signal obtained at 
the receiver as well as the coded transmitted optical signals 
is displayed.

The message, in the frame, start with the header labelled 
as Sync, a block of 5 bits. In the second block, labelled as 
calibration, the joint transmission of four calibrated R, G, B 
and V optical signals is imposed. The bit sequence for this 
block was chosen to allow all the on/off sixteen possible 
combinations of the four RGBV input channels (24). Finally 
a random message was transmitted. All the ordered levels 
(d0-d15) are pointed out at the correspondent levels and are 
displayed as horizontal dotted lines. In the right hand side 
the match between MUX levels and the [RGBV] binary 
code assigned to each level is shown. Comparing the 
calibrated levels (d0-d15) with the different assigned 4-digit 
binary [RGBV] codes, ascribed to each level, the decoding 
is straightforward and the message decoded. The footprint 
position comes directly from the synchronism block, where 
all the received channels are, simultaneously, on or off. The 
pose of the mobile receiver (x,y, ) in the network comes 
directly from the next 12 decoded bits. Finally, the received 
traffic message is decoded based on the last MUX levels.

Then, this vehicle enters the crossroad through #8 (t’’a) 
and leaves it in the exit #2 at t’’’a , keeping always the same 
direction (E). In Figure 5b, vehicle b approaches the 
intersection after having asked permission to cross it and 
only receives authorization when the vehicle a has left the 
intersection (end of Phase 2). Then, Phase 3 begins with 
vehicle b heading to the intersection (W) (pose red) while 
vehicle a follows its destination towards E (pose green). In 
Figure 5c, the movement of the cars, in the successive 
moments, is shown through their colorful poses (color 
arrows) and qac spatial relative poses along the time (dot 
lines). Results show that, as the receiver moves between 
generated point regions, the received information pattern 
changes. The vehicle speed can be calculated by measuring 
the actual travelled distance overtime, using the ID´s 
transmitters tracking. Two measurements are required: 
distance and elapsed time. The distance is fixed while the 
elapsed time will be obtained through the instants where the 
number of received channels changes. The receivers 
compute the geographical position in the successive instants 
(path) and infer the vehicle’s speed. In the following, this 
data will be transmitted to another leader vehicle through 
the V2V communication or to control manager (IM) at the 
traffic light through V2I. When two vehicles are in 
neighborhood and in different lanes, the geometric 
relationship between them can (qi,j) (dotted lines in Figure 
5c) can be inferred through local SLAM fusing their self-
localizations via a chain of geometric relationships among 
the vehicles poses and the local maps. 
For a vehicle with several neighboring vehicles, the 
mesh node uses the indirect V2V relative pose estimations 
method taking advantage of the data of each neighboring 
vehicle.  
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS  
This paper presents a new concept of request/response 
for the redesign and management of a trajectory in a two-
way-two-way traffic lights controlled crossroad, using VLC 
between connected cars. A simulated traffic scenario was 
presented and a generic model of cooperative transmission 
for vehicular communication services was established. As a 
PoC, a phasing of traffic flows is suggested. The 
simulated/experimental results confirmed that the proposed 
cooperative VLC architecture is suitable for the intended 
applications. The introduction of VLC between connected 
vehicles and the surrounding infrastructure allows the direct 
monitoring of relative speed thresholds and inter-vehicle 
spacing increasing the safety.
