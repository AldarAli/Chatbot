Abstract— Establishing trust between a patient and a doctor 
depends as much on their relationship as on the doctor’s 
medical abilities. One of important factors in building and 
maintaining a relationship is whether the doctor produces facial 
expressions appropriate to the patient’s condition. The purpose 
of this study is to identify facial expressions appropriate to 
various patient conditions. We focused on the greetings given by 
young doctors at the beginning of medical interviews of adult 
patients in the general ward of a hospital. Images of a role-
playing patient portraying one of three physical conditions were 
shown to seven student doctors, who were then videotaped as 
they greeted the “patient.” We identified appropriate facial 
expressions for each condition on the basis of both human 
evaluation and computer-aided facial expression emotion 
analysis. We also identified an appropriate facial expression 
when a young doctor auscultates a patient and clarified 
differences in the evaluation of facial expressions due to the 
gender and age of the evaluators. Finally, we clarified facial 
expressions required for pediatricians.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
We study facial expressions required for young medical 
doctors, and presented research results in the international 
conference of Global Health 2018 [1]. In this paper, we 
introduce differences due to the gender and age of the 
patients and facial expression required for pediatricians in 
addition to the paper presented in the Global Health 2018. 
Patient satisfaction is one of important components of 
medical care [2]. Improving patient satisfaction enhances 
trust and the relationship between patient and doctor, which 
leads to stronger adherence to the prescribed protocol, such 
as taking medicine, and to enhanced therapeutic effect [3][4]. 
Many studies and reviews have shown that the main 
determinant of patient satisfaction is the doctor-patient 
relationship [5]–[9] and that patient satisfaction is higher 
when the patient communicates with a doctor having strong 
nonverbal communication ability [10][11]. Unfortunately, 
inexperienced young doctors and medical students often 
have trouble producing appropriate facial expressions when 
greeting a patient. The first author of this paper, a lecturer on 
medical communication, often 
hears 
young 
doctors 
complaining that, though they intend to smile, patients say 
that they seem to be angry. 
In this study, we identified appropriate facial expressions 
for a doctor by using quantitative analysis. We videotaped 
medical students' facial expressions when they greeted a 
patient and analyzed the recorded videos using computer-
aided facial expression emotion analysis. We then asked 
potential patients to evaluate the appropriateness of the facial 
expressions on a five-point scale. We then identified facial 
expressions appropriate for doctors for three patient 
conditions.  
 The facial expression required for a doctor may be 
influenced by the patient's condition, the environment in 
which treatment is provided, culture, the medical department, 
and both patient’s and doctor’s gender. As the first step, we 
focused on appropriate facial expressions for young medical 
doctors when greeting patients in the general ward of a 
hospital. Also, as a typical medical treatment situation, we 
focused on appropriate facial expressions when young 
medical doctors auscultate a patient. We clarified the 
difference in the evaluation on facial expressions due to 
gender differences and age differences among evaluators. 
Finally, using computer-aided facial expression emotion 
analysis, we analyzed the facial expressions produced by two 
pediatricians when shown photographs of pediatric patients 
in three different conditions. 
After reviewing related work in Section II, we explain 
our facial expression analysis system in Section III. We 
describe our evaluation experiment in Section IV and 
analyze facial expressions in recorded videos in Section V. 
Gender and age-specific differences among evaluators are 
discussed in Section VI, and appropriate facial expressions 
for pediatricians are presented in Section VII. We conclude 
with a summary of the key points in Section VIII. 
II. 
RELATED WORK  
The medical interview is important for a doctor not only to 
get relevant information from the patient but also to build a 
good relationship with the patient. Therefore, we review 
existing research related to medical interviews in this section. 
In addition, since our work focuses on facial expressions, we 
also review research on nonverbal communication. 
A. Medical Interviews 
Medical interviews have traditionally focused on 
gathering relevant information from patients [12]. Nowadays, 
the focus has expanded to building a trusting relationship, 
sharing decision-making, responding to the patient’s

emotional state, and supporting actions related to the 
patient’s condition and treatment, so the doctor must have a 
wider range of communication skills [13]. These skills 
include "looking at a patient not as a case but as a human 
being" [14] and "building and maintaining a good 
relationship between doctor and patient" [15]. It has been 
shown that such skills have a greater effect on patient 
satisfaction than the doctor’s medical skills, the medicine 
prescribed, the information provided, the questions asked, 
the advice given, and the instructions given. In particular, a 
patient's satisfaction is positively related to the doctor being 
warm [14][16], empathic [14][16]–[18], and friendly [16] 
and giving the impression of being human [17]. 
"Nonverbal 
communication" 
is 
a 
means 
of 
communicating these emotional aspects. Patient satisfaction 
is higher when the doctor has a strong ability to express his 
or her emotions and to read the emotions of others by 
nonverbal communication such as through facial expressions, 
gaze, posture, and tone of voice [10][19][20]. In short, a 
doctor's nonverbal communication is an important aspect of 
patient care. 
B. Nonverbal Communication 
Facial expression plays a large role in nonverbal 
communication. For emotional messages such as "like" and 
"dislike," Mehrabian [21] estimated that 7% of the message 
is carried by the language content, 38% is carried by the 
voice and sound quality, and 55% is carried by the facial 
expression and gestures. Birdwhistell [22] argued that 35% 
of the message is carried by the language content while the 
remaining 65% is carried by the expression, the way of 
talking, the gesturing, etc. Therefore, it is useful to clarify the 
appropriate facial expressions for doctors to have when 
communicating with patients, especially patients who are 
sensitive to a doctor's nonverbal behavior due to anxiety [23] 
[24].  
Differences in non-verbal expressions due to cultural 
background have also been pointed out. North American 
countries such as the United States and Canada and Western 
European countries such as the Netherlands, Italy, and 
Belgium are individualistic cultures, whereas Japan is 
considered to be a collectivist culture located at the opposite 
extreme. People living in collectivist cultures tend to be 
cautious about nonverbal expression [25]. Comparative 
cultural research on facial expression recognition in the UK, 
Italy, and Japan revealed no significant difference in 
cognitive ability between Japan and the other two countries 
while the expressions produced by Japanese tended to be 
ambiguous and difficult to recognize [26]. Other research has 
shown that women have better facial expression cognitive 
abilities than men [27]–[31]. 
Studies on the effects of age on facial expression 
recognition have focused on infants and disabled children, 
but recent studies have focused on elderly people as well. 
These studies have shown that elderly people consistently 
have trouble recognizing "anger," "sadness," and "fear" 
while their recognition abilities for "happiness," "surprise," 
and “disgust” do not exhibit a consistent tendency [32][33]. 
A comparison study between young and elderly people 
revealed that young people have a higher propensity to 
evaluate photographs of expressionless faces as showing 
“anger” than elderly people [34]. 
 
III. 
FACIAL EXPRESSION ANALYSIS SYSTEM 
To identify appropriate facial expressions, we developed 
a system that quantitatively analyzes changes in facial 
expression. It is based on the Cognitive Services Emotion 
API [35] provided by Microsoft's Azure cloud service. The 
concept of the system is illustrated in Figure 1. The doctor’s 
facial image during a patient interview is recorded in a video 
file. The file is sent to the Cognitive Services Emotion API, 
which provides feedback on the position coordinates of the 
doctor’s face and the ratio by emotion. The system 
comprises 
Microsoft.ProjectOxford.Emotion.dll 
which 
corresponds 
to 
the 
Emotion 
API 
on 
Azure, 
Newtonsoft.Json.dll which handles the file in JSON format, 
Parakeet.dll 
which 
processes 
the 
movie 
file, 
and 
Parakeet.Logging.dll which passes the facial expression 
analysis received from the Emotion API as a log file to a PC 
for 
real-time 
display. 
We 
developed 
Parakeet.dll, 
Parakeet.Logging.dll, and LogViewerWPF.exe.  
Our facial expression emotion analysis system calculates 
the ratio for seven emotions ("happiness," "anger," 
"contempt," "disgust," "fear," "sadness," and "surprise") 
reflected in the input video image and for "neutral." The total 
for all emotions is 1, and the value for "neutral" is obtained 
by subtracting the total value for the seven emotions from 1. 
The detection result window is shown in Figure 2. Each 
row shows the results for the emotion corresponding to one 
facial expression. The rows are in time series order, with the 
latest set of results in the bottom row. Clicking the display 
command on the menu highlights the detection results for the 
specified face. Selecting a line by using the mouse or 
keyboard causes the corresponding video to play. 
The cells corresponding to each emotional value are 
highlighted in "pink." If the value = 1, the cells are the 
darkest pink, and if the value = 0, the cells have no color. For 
example, if the emotional value is 0.8, the color density is 
80%.

IV. 
EVALUATION EXPERIMENT 
One way to analyze the facial expressions of veteran 
doctors would be to identify facial expressions appropriate 
for doctors. However, their facial expressions would not 
always be appropriate. Since many young physicians have 
trouble producing appropriate facial expressions when 
greeting a patient, we chose to identify facial expressions 
that would be acceptable for most patients including 
potential patients from facial expressions thought to be 
suitable by medical students. We targeted the situation, in 
which they greet patients in the general ward of a hospital. 
We videotaped their greeting for model patients to be 
evaluated and identified appropriate facial expressions. 
Although evaluation by actual patients is best, it would have 
been difficult to request their participation. We thus asked 
generally healthy adults who been hospitalized in the past or 
would be in the future to play the role of the patient. We used 
the computer-aided facial expression emotion analysis to 
identify suitable facial expressions, as introduced in Section 
III. 
A. Experimental Conditions 
1) Doctor participants: Seven medical students (4 
women, 3 men; average age 22.5 years). 
2) Patient conditions: Although the actual condition of 
hospitalized patients varies widely among patients, we had a 
role-playing patient portray only three conditions, as shown 
in Figure 3: a patient who feels physically healthy (a "bright 
patient"), one whose physical condition is unknown (an 
"expressionless patient"), and one who feels badly and is 
suffering pain (a "patient in pain"). 
3) Video recording: The three photographs in Figure 3 
were shown to the doctor participants along with the 
following explanation. "The photographs you will see show 
a patient you visit during regular morning rounds in a 
hospital. They are of the same patient, but his condition is 
different in each picture. In the first one, he feels physically 
healthy; in the second one, his physical condition is 
unknown; and in the third one, he feels ill and is suffering 
pain. After looking at each photograph, "Please greet the 
patient as a doctor for about 5 seconds or so." This process 
was repeated 5 days later using three of the students and the 
same photographs. On the first day, all students greeted the 
patient as they thought best. Before the process on the 
second day, the three selected students received coaching 
based on the authors' previous findings. On the second day, 
the three students greeted the patient again. We recorded 
their greetings (30 recordings in total) and used them for our 
evaluation of facial expressions. 
The purpose of this experiment was not to identify the 
most appropriate facial expressions but simply ones that 
would be acceptable for most patients, so having a large 
group of doctors was not needed. In this paper, we consider 
“appropriate” to mean “acceptable.”

B. Subjective Evaluation 
To make the subjective evaluation more effective, we 
first had 16 people view and evaluate each video recording 
and removed the ones, in which the student’s facial 
expression was judged to be unacceptable. We then had 31 
other people view and evaluate the remaining recordings. 
1) First subjective evaluation: We showed the video 
recordings to 5 men and 11 women (average age 46) 
without sound. We asked them to judge whether the 
doctor’s facial expression was appropriate for the situation 
on a 5-point scale ("1 completely appropriate," "2 somewhat 
appropriate," "3 neutral," "4 not so appropriate," "5 
inappropriate"). We also asked them to comment on 
anything they felt or noticed. We showed the recordings 
without sound because we wanted them to focus on 
appropriate facial expressions in medical communication 
situations, and emotion is easier to read from speech than 
from facial expressions. The results are shown in Table I.  
2) Second subjective evaluation: For the second 
subjective evaluation, we eliminated the recordings with a 
score of 4 or 5 in the first evaluation, except for one score-4 
recording, because the facial expressions for those 
recordings would be unacceptable for patients. One score-4 
recording was kept because otherwise there would have 
been only three recordings for the "patient in pain." The 
videos used were B-1 to B-6 for the "bright patient" (shown 
in blue in Table I), E-1, E-2, E-3, E-4, and E-8 for the 
"expressionless patient" (shown in gray), and P-1 to P-4 and 
P-8 for the "patient in pain" (shown in yellow).

We showed these videos to 17 men and 14 women 
(average age 35.9) without sound. We asked them to judge 
whether the doctor’s facial expression was appropriate for 
the patient’s condition on the same 5-point scale. We again 
asked them to also comment on anything they felt or noticed. 
The results are shown in Table II. As in the first evaluation, 
we showed the videos without sound so that the participants 
would focus their attention on the facial expressions.

QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS  
In addition to the two subjective evaluations, the 
emotions represented by the facial expressions in the 16 
highest ranked videos were identified using our facial 
expression emotion analysis system.  
A. Facial expressions appropriate for "bright patient" 
The three top-ranked videos for "bright patient" as 
subjectively evaluated were analyzed from the point of view 
of what emotions appear in the facial expressions, as 
identified by the facial expression emotion analysis. Tables 
III, IV, and V show the results. Table VI shows the results 
for video B-10, which was evaluated as low.The cells in the 
tables corresponding to 0 or more and less than 0.2 are 
shown in blue, 0.2 or more and less than 0.4 in green, 0.4 or 
more and less than 0.6 in yellow, 0.6 or more and less than 
0.8 in orange, and 0.8 or more in red. A representative facial 
expression is shown in Figure 4. Images of the students 
corresponding to videos B-2 and B-4 are not shown because 
permission could not be obtained.

The facial expression for "bright patient" was "constant 
happiness" (expressed more as a laugh rather than simply a 
smile) for the three top-ranked videos. The lower evaluated 
video, B-10, was mostly "neutral," and it was judged as 
showing "nervousness," "no expression," "scary eye," etc., 
which explains why it received a low evaluation. 
 
B. Facial expressions appropriate for "expressionless 
patient" 
The three top-ranked videos for the "expressionless 
patient" as subjectively evaluated were analyzed from the 
point of view of what emotions appear in the facial 
expressions as identified using our facial expression 
emotion analysis system. Tables VII, VIII, and IX show the 
results. Table X shows the results for video E-8, which was 
evaluated as low. 
As shown in Figure 5, the image representing the first 
half of video E-1 is largely "happiness" (expressed as a 
smile) 
and 
"neutral" 
in 
the 
second 
half 
(mainly 
expressionless). The 2nd- and 3rd-ranked videos were 
mostly "neutral." The lower evaluated video, E-8, was 
mostly "happiness," which was judged not to be serious 
enough. It is thought that this is because medical students 
cannot judge whether an "expressionless patient" is in a good 
or bad physical condition due to the lack of expression. Since 
the patient’s condition could be bad, an expression showing 
"happiness" was judged by some as inappropriate. The 
"neutral" expressions shown in the 2nd- and 3rd-ranked 
videos were apparently judged as having little effect on the 
patient. The top-ranked video showed a natural greeting 
starting with a smile and then transitioning to "neutral" as the 
"doctor" learned about the patient’s condition, which is 
considered to be a reasonable explanation for the high 
evaluation. 
C. Facial expressions appropriate for "patient in pain" 
 The three top-ranked videos for "patient in pain" as 
subjectively evaluated were analyzed from the point of view 
of what emotions appear in the facial expressions as 
identified using our facial expression emotion analysis 
system. Tables XI, XII, and XIII show the results. The 
expression in the top-ranked video is shown in Figure 6. 
Table XIV shows the results for video P-10, which was 
evaluated low.

The expressions in the higher ranked videos are mainly 
"neutral," with "surprise," "sadness," or "fear" gradually 
appearing in some. There was virtually no expression of 
"happiness," "anger," or "disgust" except for the third frame 
of video P-1. In contrast, the expression in the lower ranked 
video, P-10, was mostly "happiness," resulting in comments 
such as "the grinning made me feel uncomfortable" and "the 
doctor seemed to be smiling faintly." These comments 
explain the low evaluation.

To identify facial expressions appropriate for a doctor 
performing auscultation, videos were created and evaluated 
using the following procedure.  
Step 1:  Take photograph of patient being auscultated 
(Figure 7). 
Step 2:  Record videos of two medical doctors producing 
facial expressions they thought appropriate for the 
patient. 
Step 3: Analyze videos using computer-aided facial 
expression emotion analysis system. 
Step 4: Have ten potential patients evaluate doctors’ facial 
expressions on 3-point scale (1: appropriate, 2: 
neutral, 3: inappropriate).

As shown in Tables ⅩⅤ and ⅩⅥ, the results of the 
facial expression emotion analysis were mostly “neutral.” 
As shown in Table ⅩVII, the potential patients felt that the 
facial expressions in Figure 8 were appropriate. 
The potential patients felt that the facial expressions in 
the two videos were mainly "neutral," meaning that they felt 
that the doctor was performing the auscultation in a serious 
manner. 
VI. 
GENDER AND AGE-SPECIFIC DIFFERENCES AMONG 
EVALUATORS  
To investigate the difference in evaluation by gender and 
age of the evaluator, we made videos of a man and a woman 
playing the role of a doctor and producing expressions in 
accordance with the findings reported above.  
A. Video creation of model doctors 
As described in the previous section, acceptable 
expressions were identified for four situations. For patients 
who feel physically healthy, the most acceptable facial 
expression is "continuous happiness" (expressed more as a 
laugh rather than simply a smile). For patients without a 
facial expression, the most acceptable facial expression is 
initially "happiness" (expressed as a smile) and then 
"neutral" (without expression). For patients feeling ill and 
suffering pain, the most acceptable facial expression is 
"neutral" with a little "sadness" or "surprise." For patients 
being auscultated, the most acceptable facial expression is 
"continuous neutral" (expressed as serious). We recorded 
video of the two “doctors” as they produced these 
expressions (Figures 9–12).

We showed the videos without sound to 32 men and 47 
women (average age 46.7), as detailed in Table XVIII. We 
asked these evaluators to judge whether the doctor’s facial 
expression was appropriate for the situation on a 3-point 
scale ("1: appropriate," "2: neutral," "3: inappropriate").

We also asked them to comment on anything they felt or 
noticed. We showed the videos without sound so that they 
would focus their attention on the facial expressions. As 
shown in Figure 13, the expressions for the "bright patient" 
were judged to be the most appropriate while those for the 
"patient in pain" were judged to be the most inappropriate. 
This latter result may be because the “patients” produced a 
variety of facial expressions for the "patient in pain" situation. 
This is consistent with the results of the first experiment, in 
which facial expressions appropriate for doctors were 
identified (Table I).  
B. Differences in evaluation by  gender 
Looking at the evaluation results in Figure 14 for the 
"bright patient" by evaluator gender, we see that there was 
little difference between the male and female evaluators. 
None of the evaluators gave a score of 3 ("inappropriate") 
while 91.5% of the female evaluators and 90.3% of the male 
evaluators gave a score of 1 ("appropriate"). 
The expressions for the "expressionless patient" were 
judged quite differently: 71.0% of the male evaluators and 
56.4% of the female evaluators gave a score of 1 
("appropriate"), 42.6% of the female evaluators and 25.8% 
of the male evaluators gave a score of 2 (“neutral"), and 
1.1% of the female evaluators and 3.2% of the male 
evaluators gave a score of 3 (“inappropriate"). In short, the 
female evaluators were more critical in their evaluations, 
which conforms to the results of previous studies showing 
that women are better at reading facial expressions [26]–[30]. 
The expressions for the "patient in pain" were also judged 
quite differently, with the female evaluators again being 
more critical: 56.5% of the male evaluators and 34.0% of the 
female evaluators gave a score of 1 ("appropriate"), 51.1% of 
the female evaluators and 32.3% of the male evaluators gave 
a score of 2 ("neutral)," and 14.9% of the female evaluators 
and 11.3% of the male evaluators gave a score of 3 
("inappropriate"). These results also conform to the results of 
previous studies showing that women are better at reading 
facial expressions [26]–[30]. 
 The expressions for "Auscultation" were judged a bit 
differently, with the male evaluators being slightly more 
critical. None of the evaluators gave a score of 3 
("inappropriate"; 76.0% of the female evaluators and 70.7% 
of the male evaluators gave a score of 1 ("appropriate"). This 
difference by gender is within an acceptable error range. 
These results totally indicate that women are more likely 
to be sensitive to facial expressions than men. 
C. Differences in evaluation by  age 
The average evaluation scores by evaluator age are 
plotted in Figures 15–22. The number of evaluators in each 
age group is shown in Table XVIII. 
For the “bright patient,” while there was some variance 
by age, the male and female evaluators of all ages mostly 
gave scores of 1 ("appropriate"). Therefore, evaluator age 
had little effect on the score for the “bright patient.”  
For the “expressionless patient,” the female evaluators 
were somewhat critical overall. Although there was some 

52
International Journal on Advances in Life Sciences, vol 11 no 1 & 2, year 2019, http://www.iariajournals.org/life_sciences/
2019, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
variation by age, it is hard to assign a reason for this due to 
the small number of evaluators in each age group.  
For the “patient in pain,” there was a tendency for the 
individual differences for both the male and female 
evaluators to be critical. The evaluators in their 20s tended 
to give better scores (average score of 1.33 vs. overall 
average score of 1.75). This may be because patients in their 
20s are less concerned with a doctor’s facial expression, as 
reflected in the comment from one of the evaluators in the 
20s group: "I have never minded the doctor's facial 
expression." 
For “Auscultation,” the male and female evaluators in 
their 30s were more critical (average score of 1.64 vs. 
overall average score of 1.28). They were also more critical 
for the “expressionless patient” (average score of 1.71 vs. 
overall average score of 1.41). 
 These results indicate that age was not an important 
factor in the evaluations; however, we plan to investigate 
this further in experiments using more evaluators.

VII. PEDIATRICIAN'S FACIAL EXPRESSIONS 
The expressions appropriate for pediatric patients likely 
differ from ones appropriate for adult patientss. Due to an 
influenza outbreak, we were able to get cooperation from 
only two doctors in this part of our study. We used our 
computer-aided facial expression emotion analysis system 
to analyze the facial expressions they produced when 
shown photographs of pediatric patients in three different 
conditions. 
A. Experimental procedure 
To identify facial expressions appropriate for greeting 
hospitalized pediatric patients in the same three conditions 
described above ("bright patient," "expressionless patient," 
and "patient in pain"), we used the following procedure. 
Step 1:  We photographed role-playing pediatric patients as 
they produced expressions for each of the 
conditions. (The photographs of the 8-year-olds are 
not included here for privacy reasons.)  
Step 2:  We recorded video of the two doctors as they 
produced 
facial 
expressions 
they 
thought 
appropriate for each photograph. 
Step 3:  We analyzed the emotion shown by their 
expressions 
by 
using 
computer-aided 
facial 
expression emotion analysis. 
B. Results 
The results of the facial expression emotion analysis for 
the two pediatricians are shown in Tables XIX–XXI.  
For the "bright patient," the appropriate facial expression 
for adult patients was "happiness" while the pediatricians 
produced expressions covering both "happiness" and 
"neutral," which created a pleasant smiley feeling. 
For the "expressionless patient," the appropriate 
expressions for adult patients were first "happiness" and 
then "neutral," whereas the pediatricians produced "neutral" 
expressions. 
For the "patient in pain," the appropriate facial 
expression for adult patients was "neutral," whereas the 
pediatricians first produced a "neutral" expression and then 
a "happiness" expression. Thus, for pediatric patients with a 

54

2019, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
bright expression, the pediatricians greet them with a natural 
expression. For expressionless pediatric patients, they are 
expressionless, like the patient. Unlike doctors for adults, 
the most important facial expression for pediatric physicians 
was found to be the final encouraging smile as part of 
speaking naturally to pediatric patients in pain.

VIII. CONCLUSION 
Our quantitative analysis of medical student facial 
expressions when greeting an adult patient to be medically 
evaluated in the general ward of a hospital revealed 
acceptable facial expressions. For patients who feel 
physically healthy, the most acceptable facial expression is 
"continuous happiness" (expressed more as a laugh than 
simply as a smile). For patients without a facial expression, 
the most acceptable facial expression is initially "happiness" 
(expressed as a smile) and then "neutral" (without 
expression). For patients suffering pain, the most acceptable 
facial expression is "neutral" with a little "sadness" or 
"surprise." During auscultation, the most acceptable facial 
expression is always "neutral." 
There was no significant difference in facial expression 
required by the doctor depending on the gender and age of 
the patient. 
Analysis of the facial expressions produced by two 
pediatricians showed that they produced expressions 
covering both "happiness" and "neutral" when greeting 
pediatric patients who had a bright expression and produced 
a neutral expression when greeting expressionless pediatric 
patients. Most importantly, they need to encourage pediatric 
patients in pain by ending with a smile. 
Although appropriate facial expressions may differ 
between doctors in different countries due to cultural 
differences, we believe that the proposed method for 
identifying appropriate facial expressions is useful in any 
country.
