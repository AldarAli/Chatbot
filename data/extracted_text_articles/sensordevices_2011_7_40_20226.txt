Abstract—This paper presents results on the use of 
multilayered a-SiC:H heterostructures as a device for 
wavelength-division demultiplexing of optical signals. The 
devices presented enable the simplification of the optical front 
end system by using their intrinsic color selectivity to avoid the 
need of external optical filters. The device is composed of two 
stacked p-i-n photodiodes, each optimized for the absorption of 
a part of the optical spectrum. Band gap engineering was used 
to adjust the photogeneration and recombination rates profiles 
of the intrinsic absorber regions of each photodiode to short 
and long wavelength absorption and carrier collection in the 
visible spectrum. The photocurrent signal using different input 
optical channels (wavelengths) was analyzed at reverse and 
forward bias and under steady state illumination. A 
demultiplexing algorithm based on the voltage controlled 
selectivity of the device is proposed and tested. The operation 
frequency of the device was analyzed under different optical 
bias conditions. An electrical model of the WDM device is 
presented and supported by the solution of the respective 
circuit equations. The main application of these devices is in 
the field of optical communications that use the wavelength 
division multiplexing technique to encode multiple signals into 
the same transmission medium. Other possible applications of 
the device in optical communication systems are also proposed.

 INTRODUCTION  
Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) devices are 
used when different optical signals are combined on the 
same optical transmission medium, in order to enhance the 
transmission capacity and the application flexibility of 
optical communication and sensor systems. The use of 
WDM technologies not only provides high speed optical 
communication links, but also offers advantages such as 
higher data rates and self-routing. The commercially 
available WDM devices usually include prisms, interference 
filters or diffraction gratings in order to separate the different 
channels. Currently modern optical networks use Arrayed 
Waveguide 
Grating 
(AWG) 
as 
optical 
wavelength 
(de)multiplexers [1] that use multiple waveguides to carry 
the optical signals. In this paper we report the use of a 
monolithic WDM device based on an a-Si:H/a-SiC:H 
multilayered semiconductor heterostructure. The device 
makes use of the fact that the optical absorption of the 
different wavelengths can be tuned by means of electrical 
bias changes or optical bias variations. This capability is 
obtained using adequate engineering design of the multiple 
layers 
thickness, 
absorption 
coefficient 
and 
dark 
conductivities [2, 3].

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS 
The device described herein operates in the 400 to 700 
nm range which makes it suitable for operation at visible 
wavelengths in optical communication applications. The 
device is a multilayered heterostructure based on a-Si:H and 
a-SiC:H. The device is quite simple, consisting in a stack of 
two p-i-n structures sandwiched between two transparent 
electrical contacts (Fig. 1). Both front and back structures 
behave as optical filters confining, respectively, the 
absorption of the short and the long wavelength optical 
carriers, while the intermediate wavelengths are absorbed 
across both [4, 5]. The device was operated within the visible 
range using as optical signals three modulated light beams 
(with variable modulation frequency and intensity) supplied 
by red, green and blue LED’s with wavelengths of 470 nm, 
524 nm and 626 nm, respectively. An electrical model of the 
WDM device is presented and supported by the solution of 
the respective circuit equations. Other possible applications 
of the device in optical communication systems are also 
proposed.

The semiconductor layers were produced by Plasma 
Enhanced Chemical Deposition (PECVD) technique and 
optimized for specific wavelength sensitivity. The active 
device 
consists 
of 
a 
p-i'(a-SiC:H)-n/p-i(a-Si:H)-n 
heterostructure with low conductivity doped layers. The 
thicknesses and optical gap of the thin í'- (200nm; 2.1 eV) 
and thick i- (1000nm; 1.8 eV) layers are optimized for light 
absorption in the blue and red ranges, respectively. 
Transparent contacts have been deposited on front and back 
surfaces to allow the light to enter and leave from both sides 
(see Fig. 1). 
To test the sensitivity of the device under different 
applied 
voltage 
and 
optical 
bias 
three 
modulated 
monochromatic lights beams: red (R: 626 nm; 51μW/cm2), 
green (G: 524 nm; 73μW/cm2) and blue (B: 470 nm; 
115μW/cm2) 
and 
their 
polychromatic 
combinations 
(multiplexed signal) illuminated separately the device and 
the generated photocurrent was measured under positive and 
negative voltages (+1V<V<-10V), under or without steady 
state green optical bias (G: 524 nm; 73μW/cm2). The 
modulation frequency of each channel was chosen to be a 
multiple of the others in order to ensure a synchronous 
relation of ON-OFF states along each cycle and the optical 
powers were adjusted to give different signal magnitudes at -
8V bias. 
Fig. 2 displays the measured spectral photocurrent under 
reverse and forward bias. Results show that in the long 
wavelengths range (> 600 nm) the spectral response is 
independent on the applied bias while in the short 
wavelength the collection strongly increases with the reverse 
bias. As expected from Fig. 2, the red signal remains 
constant while the blue and the green ones decrease as the 
voltage changes from negative to positive. The output 
multiplexed electrical signal, obtained with the combination 
of the three optical sources, depends on both the applied 
voltage and on the ON-OFF state of each input optical 
channel. Under negative bias, there are eight separate levels 
while under positive bias they were reduced by half. The 
highest level appears when all the channels are ON and the 
lowest if they are OFF. Furthermore, the levels ascribed to 
the mixture of three or two input channels are higher than the 
ones due to the presence of only one (R, G, B).

An optical nonlinearity was detected; the sum of the 
input channels (R+B+G) is lower than the correspondent 
multiplexed signals (R&G&B). This optical amplification, 
mainly on the ON-ON states, suggests capacitive effects due 
to the time-varying nature of the incident lights. Under 
positive bias the levels are reduced by half since and the blue 
component of the combined spectra falls into the dark level, 
the red remains constant and the green one decreases. 
To recover the transmitted information (8 bit per 
wavelength channel) the multiplexed signal, during a 
complete cycle, was divided into eight time slots, each 
corresponding to one bit where each independent optical 
signals can be ON (1) or OFF (0). 
Under positive bias, the device has no sensitivity to the 
blue channel (Fig. 1-2), so the red and green transmitted 
information can be extracted. The highest level corresponds 
to both channels ON (R&G: R=1, G=1), and the lowest to 
the OFF-OFF stage (R=0; G=0). The two levels in-between 
are related with the presence of only one channel ON, the red 
(R=1, G=0) or the green (R=0, G=1). To distinguish between 
these two situations and to decode the blue channel, the 
correspondent sub-levels, under reverse bias, have to be 
analyzed. The highest increase at -8V corresponds to the blue 
channel ON (B=1), the lowest to the ON stage of the red 
channel (R=1) and the intermediate one to the ON stage of 
the green (G=1). Using this simple key algorithm the 
independent red, green and blue bit sequences can be 
decoded as: R[01111000], G[10011001] and B[10101010], 
as shown on the top of Fig. 2, which are in agreement with 
the signals used for the independent channels.

thin structure. The optical signals were obtained modulation 
of the LED driving current and the optical power intensity 
of the red, green and blue channels adjusted to 51, 90, 150 
μW/cm2, respectively. The steady state light was generated 
by LED’s driven at a constant current value (R: 290 
μW/cm2, G: 150 μW/cm2, B: 390 μW/cm2). 
Results show that the blue steady state optical bias 
increases the signals carried out by the red (Fig. 4a) and the 
green channels (Fig. 4b) and reduces the signal of the blue 
channel (Fig. 4c). Red steady state optical bias has an 
opposite behavior, reinforcing the blue channel and 
decreasing the blue and the green channels. The green 
optical bias mainly affects the green channel, as the output 
signal is reduced while the signals of the red and blue 
channels show negligible changes.

The behavior of the device under steady state optical 
bias can be explained attending to the dependence of the 
internal electric field distribution. When an optical bias is 
applied it mainly enhances the field distribution within the 
less photo excited sub-cell: the back under blue irradiation 
and the front under red steady bias. Therefore, the 
reinforcement of the electric field under blue irradiation and 
negative bias increases the collection. 
The study of the modulation frequency influence on 
the device performance was analyzed through the spectral 
response of the device without and with steady state optical 
bias. Results are displayed in Fig. 5. Data from Fig. 5 show 
that without background light the curves measured under 
different modulation frequencies exhibit the same trend with 
two peaks located at 500 nm and 600 nm. The signal is 
reduced with the increase of the frequency. Under blue 
steady state illumination (Fig. 5b) the spectral response 
exhibits a different trend with a single peak located at 600 
nm.

This is due to the strong attenuation of the short 
wavelengths (Fig. 4c). The red steady state illumination (Fig. 
5c) has the opposite effect with a single peak at 500 nm. 
Under green background the spectral response shows two 
different regimes depending on the operation frequency. In 
the low frequency range the signal is similar to the trends 
obtained under red steady state light, while at higher 
frequencies it follows the behavior obtained without 
background light.  
In Fig. 6 it is displayed the ratio of the signal measured 
under steady light and without it at different frequencies. 
Results show that at all frequencies of the analyzed range, 
under blue steady state illumination, the long wavelengths 
are amplified while shorter wavelengths (< 530 nm) are 
reduced. A similar result is observed for the red steady state 
illumination. Here the reinforcement of the signal level 
occurs for shorter wavelengths, while in the longer ones it is 
reduced.

For the green background light the ratio between the

frequencies the presence of the steady state light reduces the 
photocurrent, while for higher frequencies this reduction is 
only observed in a narrow range of the spectrum (from 470 
nm up to 480 nm). In the remaining ranges the signal is 
enhanced. 
The

for

IV. OPTICAL BIAS CONTROLLED WAVELENGTH 
DISCRIMINATION 
In Fig. 7, the input and the multiplexed channels, without 
or with green optical bias, are displayed at -8V. The bit 
sequence is shown at the top of the figure to guide the eyes. 
Results show that the presence of the optical bias reduces 
significantly the amplitude of green channel while a slightly 
increase is observed for the others two. The sum of the input 
channels (R+G+B) shows that when the green channel is ON 
no amplification occurs. This suggests that the green channel 
can be tuned by making the difference between the 
multiplexed signal without and with green irradiation 
(symbols). 
This nonlinearity is due to the asymmetrical light 
penetration of the input channels and on the optical 
selectivity properties of the device. When an external optical 
bias is applied, it mainly influences the field distribution 
within the less photo excited sub-cell.  
Under green light irradiation the electric field decreases 
on both sub-cells. So, some of the carriers generated by the 
green channel, also in both sub-cells, recombine and the 
collection decreases. When the red or blue channels are ON, 
the generation occurs only in one sub-cell. The electrical 
field, in the presence of the red and blue channels, lowers, 
respectively, in the back and front photodiodes (most 
absorbing cells), while the correspondent front and back 
photodiodes (less absorbing cells) reacts by assuming a 
reverse bias configuration compensating the effect of the 
green optical bias [7]. This self bias effect explains the 
slightly increase on the red and blue collection under green 
optical bias.

ELECTRIAL SIMULATION  
The silicon-carbon pi’npin device can be considered as a 
monolithic double pin photodiode structure with two red and 
blue optical connections for light triggering. Based on the 
experimental results and device configuration an electrical 
model was developed [6]. Operation is explained in terms of 
the compound connected phototransistor equivalent model 
displayed as an inset in Fig. 8. 
In Fig. 8 the currents under negative bias, with and 
without optical green bias, are compared. To simulate the 
green 
background, 
current 
sources 
intensities 
were 
multiplied by the on/off ratio between the input channels 
with and without optical bias (Fig. 6). The same bit sequence 
of Fig. 3 was used in both figures. To validate the model the 
experimental multiplexed signals are also shown (solid 
lines). Good agreement between experimental and simulated 
data was observed. The eight expected levels, under reversed 
bias, and their reduction under green irradiation are clearly 
seen.  
When the pi’npin device is reverse-biased, the base 
emitter junctions of both transistors are inversely polarized 
and conceived as phototransistors, taking, so, advantage of 
the amplifier action of neighboring collector junctions which 
are polarized directly. This results in a charging current gain 
proportional to the ratio between both collector currents 
(C1/C2). Under positive bias the internal junction becomes 
always 
reverse-biased. 
If 
not 
triggered 
ON 
it 
is 
nonconducting, when turned ON by light it conducts like a 
photodiode, for one polarity of current. 
Green irradiation moves asymmetrically voltages at the 
Q1 and Q2 bases toward their emitter values, resulting in 
lower values of I3 and I4 when compared without optical bias 
(Fig. 7). I1 and I2 slightly increase due to the increased carrier 
generation on the less absorbing phototransistors. Under 
negative bias and during the duration of the red and blue 
pulses (I1 or I2 ON), as without optical bias, the internal 
junction remains forward biased and the transferred charge 
between C1 and C2 reaches the output terminal as a 
capacitive charging current. During the green pulse (I3 and I4 
ON) only residual charges are transferred between C1 and C2. 
So, only the charges generated in the base of Q2 (I4) reaches 
the output terminal as can be confirmed by the good fitting 
between simulate and experimental differences of both 
multiplexed signals without and with optical bias. 
 
VI. CONCLUSIONS 
A double pi’n/pin a-SiC:H heterostructure with two 
optical sensitive regions sensitive to different spectral 
regions 
was 
presented. 
Multiple 
monochromatic 
communication channels, in the visible range, were 
transmitted together, each one with a specific bit sequence, 
and detected by the device. The combined optical signal was 
analyzed by reading out, under positive and negative 
voltages and optical green bias, the generated photocurrent 
across the device. Results show that the output multiplexed 
signal has a strong nonlinear dependence on the light 
absorption profile, i.e. on the incident light wavelength, bit 
rate, intensity and optical bias due to the self biasing of the 
junctions under unbalanced light generation profiles. By 
switching between positive and negative voltages the input 
channels can be recovered or removed. 
The influence of the operation frequency was analyzed 
under different optical bias conditions. Further works on this 
topic is necessary for better understanding and further 
optimize the device operation.
