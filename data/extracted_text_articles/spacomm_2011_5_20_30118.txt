Abstract— This paper computes the mean acquisition time for 
a hybrid search acquisition stage of Galileo signals, under the 
assumption of multiple correct windows in the search space. 
The assumption of multiple correct windows is a realistic 
assumption both in single and multipath-fading channels, due 
to the fact that the width of the main lobe of the correlation 
envelope is at least 2 chips (depending on the receiver front-
end bandwidth) and the time-bin step of scanning the multiple 
code phases is typically below 0.5 chips. The multiple-window 
hypothesis acquisition is poorly addressed in the Code Division 
Multiple Access (CDMA) literature, and the comparison of 
multiple-dwell acquisition strategy is completely novel in the 
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) literature, to the 
best of the authors’ knowledge. One of the main results of the 
paper is that choosing an increased false alarm probability per 
dwell when going from one dwell to the next one, in 
conjunction with an increasing integration time, offers better 
results for the mean acquisition time.

I. 
 BACKGROUND AND PROBLEM DEFINITION  
In 1998, the European Union decided to pursue a satellite 
navigation system independent of the U.S. Global 
Positioning System. This European satellite system, namely 
Galileo, is designed specifically for civilian use worldwide. 
When completed, the Galileo system will provide multiple 
levels of service to users throughout the world. This paper 
studies the acquisition of Galileo E1 Open Service (OS) 
signals with multi-dwell hybrid search acquisition algorithm. 
Also the serial search will be incorporated in the simulations 
results, as a particular case of the hybrid search and in order 
to offer a benchmark for the results. The acquisition problem 
of any pseudorandom code (as those used in CDMA systems 
such as Galileo) is equivalent with the classical detection 
problem of testing two hypotheses H0 versus H1:  
1
0
:
:
H
signal is present
H
signal is absent  
The H0 and H1 hypotheses are in fact associated with the 
envelope of the correlation between the incoming signal and 
a locally generated reference code, with different tentative 
delays and Doppler frequencies. Each pair of tentative delay 
and Doppler frequency defines as bin (or a cell), as shown in 
Fig. 1. Several bins (or cells) are grouped together in a so-
called search window, as illustrated in Fig. 1. A test statistic 
is formed in each window, such as the maximum correlation 
value among all bins in a window, and that test statistic is 
compared with a threshold, in order to detect the presence or 
the absence of the signal. 
 
 
Figure 1.  Illustration of hybrid search space 
The classical situation, analyzed so far in the literature is 
the situation when the whole main correlation lobe is 
contained in only one window. However, due to the 
randomness of the channel delays, this is not always true, 
and it is possible to encounter a situation as shown in Fig. 2, 
where parts of main lobe of the correlation envelope are 
contained in one window, and the other parts are contained 
in the second window. Both windows are „correct‟ windows, 
satisfying hypothesis H1, and they are denoted in what 
follows by W1, and W2, as illustrated in Fig. 1. This is the 
case we address in this paper and that has not been reported 
before in literature, to the best of the author‟s knowledge. 
The benefit of studying the case of two correct search 
windows is that the conclusions can be used for further 
improving the acquisition algorithms implemented in GNSS 
receivers. Previous studies dealing with the mean acquisition 
time in GNSS signals in the presence of single correct 
window can be found, for example, in [1,2,3,4].  
The second section of this paper presents the model of 
the acquisition stage that has been used for computing the 
mean acquisition time. Section III explains how the variable

threshold algorithm works. The results obtained from the 
Matlab simulations are illustrated in Section IV and the 
conclusions are drawn in the fifth Section.

ACQUISITION MODEL 
From the point of positioning, only the first path (or Line 
of Sight, LOS) is of interest. The size of the hybrid search 
window typically depends on the available number of 
correlators. For a pure software implementation, the window 
length can cover the whole code uncertainty (of 1023 chips 
for GPS and 4092 chips for Galileo). In this situation, the 
hybrid search is equivalent with parallel search. However, in 
most of the cases, the search window length is much smaller 
(few tens or few hundreds of chips). We may however 
assume that there are at most Q=2 windows containing signal 
cells (and thus the maximum channel delay spread is less 
than twice of search window length). In Fig. 1, the illustrated 
window length is of one chip. 
Each window is formed by several cells. Their number 
depends on the step of scanning the time-bin hypotheses. For 
example, if this step is (Δt)bin (in chips) and the window 
length in chips is LW, then there are N cells per search 
window, where N  is given by:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1) 
  
A cell can be either a H1 (hypothesis one) cell, meaning 
that it contains signal coming from one channel path (the 
signal level is dependent on path position and on the 
modulation type, which defines the correlation function 
shape), or a H0 (hypothesis 0) cell, meaning that it contains 
only noise. Even in single-path case, due to the 2-chip width 
correlation function, we may have more than one H1 cells per 
window.  
We denote by W1 and W2 the windows containing signal 
H1 cells and by W0 the windows containing only H0 cells. As 
explained in the previous section, the assumption with at 
most two windows with H1 cells is reasonable. We also 
assume that there are Li, i=1,2 cells containing signal in Wi 
window (i.e., H1 cells) and N - Li  cells with only noise (i.e.,  
H0  cells) (N being the total number of cells per window). 
It is straightforward to show that, after non-coherent 
integration, the signal in H1 cells obeys a χ2
 non-central 
distribution of Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) 
Fnc(γ, λ0), l=1,..., Li , and the signal in H0 cells obeys a χ2 
central distribution of CDF Fc(γ). Above, γ is the detection 
threshold [5] and λl is the non-centrality parameter in cell Li, 
related to signal power Eb and to the envelope of the 
BOC/BPSK auto-correlation function R(Δτl) in l-th cell or 
bin, which is spaced with Δτl chips from the maximum; e.g., 
R(0) =1. Thus,  λl is defined as:

For multiple dwell search (K dwells), the state transition 
diagram between one state to another can be divided into 3 
regions, as seen in Fig. 3: transition between W1 and W2 
windows, transition between W2 and W0 windows, and 
transitions between W0 and W0 windows. We assume that 
there are ν windows in the search space: maximum 2 
windows (W1 and W2) containing signal H1 cells (a particular 
case here is the situation when only the first window contains 
signal cells W2=W0) and ν - 2 windows containing only noise 
H0 cells. 
 In here, we use also the assumption that the correct cell 
is at the edge between two windows (W1 and W2), and the 
acquisition state can be achieved from both W1 and W2 
windows. The state flow diagram is shown in Fig. 3. τk is the 
k-th dwell time. We used the notation 
( )
k
HM
 for a „„missed 
detection” transfer function and the notation

 for a 
transition from one correct window to the second correct 
window. We also used the notations

functions, at k-th dwell. The penalty factor to return from a

VARIABLE THRESHOLD, FIXED DWELL TIME 
ALGORITHM 
In order to compute the detection and false alarm 
probabilities needed in the MAT computation, we fixed a 
target false alarm at the output of all dwells (which is the 
product of the individual false alarm in each dwell, and will 
be specified in the parameters table) and we also fixed the 
total integration time per dwell, as the product between a 
certain coherent integration interval Nc and a certain non-
coherent integration interval Nnc. With the desired false 
alarm and the specified coherent and non-coherent 
integration intervals, a variable threshold per each dwell was 
computed, according to eq. (11). The variable threshold was 
then introduced in equations (9) and (10) in order to compute 
the corresponding detection probabilities.     
 As illustrated in Fig. 5, by reducing the false alarm, we 
increase the detection threshold, and thus we also reduce the 
detection probability. It is usually preferred that the first 
dwell has a lower false alarm probability and a lower 
integration time (or dwell time), while in the sub-sequent 
dwells we try to improve the detection probabilities, by 
allowing a higher integration time and, typically, a higher 
false alarm probability. 
IV. 
SIMULATION RESULTS  
     The main simulation parameters, common for all 
considered scenarios, are illustrated in TABLE I. The 
number of states ν is computed as the total number of time-
Doppler bins (i.e., 18 x 11691= 210438), divided by the 
number of bins per window (given in TABLE I). The 
analyzed case was the situation of a CBOC(-)-modulated 
signal (e.g., pilot channel E1-C in Galileo, according to [8]) 
with a reference CBOC-modulated code and a wideband 
receiver front-end of 24.552 MHz, as specified in [8]. 
Several scenarios were analyzed, as given in TABLE II. The 
results are presented in the following sub-sections.

A. 
Moderate number of correlators in the hybrid 
search 
  In the first analyzed situation, we assumed that each 
decision window has 4000 complex correlators (or bins). The 
results are shown in Fig. 6 to Fig. 8, for the 3 scenarios 
shown in TABLE II.  
     It is to be noticed that Scenario 3 differs from 
Scenario 2 only in that the false alarm probabilities in multi-
dwell case are increasing (instead of decreasing). From the 
comparison of Fig. 7 with Fig. 8, we see that Scenario 3 
(increasing false alarm probabilities) gives slightly better 
results (than Scenario 2) in the 2-dwell and 3-dwell cases. As 
seen in the following figures, at low Carrier to Noise Ratio 
(C/N0), single-dwell approaches have very good performance 
(either comparable or even better than multiple-dwell 
approaches), in both serial and hybrid searches. At higher 
C/N0, typically above 30 dB-Hz, multi-dwell approaches do 
bring an improvement in MAT, but the improvement from 
passing from 2-dwell to 3-dwell architecture is not as 
significant as the improvement from single dwell to 2 dwells. 
Also, there is a significant improvement if several correlators 
can be used in parallel (hybrid approach), compared to the 
serial case. 
B. High number of correlators in the hybrid search 
In the second analyzed situation, we assumed that each 
decision window has 100000 complex correlators (or bins), 
corresponding to only 2 search windows in the whole 
uncertainty space. The results are shown in Fig. 9 to Fig. 11. 
Clearly, going from 4000 to 100000 correlators per search 
window improves the MAT performance (the gap versus 
serial search is higher for higher number of correlators).

CONCLUSION 
This paper introduces a semi-analytical expression for the 
computation of the Mean Acquisition Time for the hybrid 
search of Galileo CBOC-modulated signals, under the 
hypothesis of multiple correct windows (due to the 
randomness of the delays introduced by the wireless channel 
and to the width of the main correlation lobe). Simulation 
results under static channels and multiple correlators per 
search window for Galileo E1-C pilot channels were also 
presented. Also the serial search case was maintained as a 
benchmark. It was seen that increasing the number of dwells 
can bring some benefit in the MAT, if the parameters of each 
dwell (e.g., integration times and false alarm probabilities 
per dwell) are chosen properly. It was also seen that 
choosing an increasing false alarm probability per dwell (i.e., 
smallest false alarm at the first dwell and highest as the last 
dwell), in conjunction with an increasing integration time 
(i.e., smallest at the first stage, highest at the last stage) offers 
the best results. It was also shown that increasing the 
coherent integration time, while keeping the same overall 
integration time offers slightly better MAT results. The 
coherent integration length is of course, limited by the 
presence of data bit transitions and local oscillator drifts. 
Further studies are dedicated to the behavior in multipath 
fading channels (however, analytical and semi-analytical 
MAT expressions for these cases are hard to get and the 
results are likely to be obtained in an empirical manner, via 
Monte-Carlo simulations).
