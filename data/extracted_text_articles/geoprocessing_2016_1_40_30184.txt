Abstract— Most existing spatio-temporal urban expansion 
models consider urban land-use as a binary process, through 
the identification of urban versus non-urban areas. The main 
aim of this study is to analyze and model the expansion of 
multiple urban densities in Wallonia, Belgium. To this end, this 
study employs a multinomial logistic regression model that 
enables to visualize the consequence of different urban 
densities expansion. Cadastral datasets of years 2000 and 2010 
are used to set four urban classes (non-urban, low-density, 
medium-density and high-density urban). Besides, several 
socio-economic, geographic and political driving forces dealing 
with urban development were operationalized to create maps 
of urban expansion probability for each urban density class. 
These probability maps are then utilized to predict future 
urban expansions for years 2020 and 2030.  The model is 
validated using relative operating characteristic method for 
different urban classes. Our results suggest that different 
urban densities expansions are mainly linked to zoning status, 
neighboring areas that are urban and accessibility. Most 
importantly, this study highlights that the contribution of 
different driving forces to urban expansion process varies 
along with urban density.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Rapid urbanization is one of the crucial global issues 
affecting the physical features of the Earth. As a 
consequence, a series of urban expansion modelling 
approaches has been proposed. Most existing urban 
expansion models are based on a regular grid composed of 
square cells of dimension between 30x30m to 300x300m 
[1]–[6]. Typically, these models address urban expansion as 
a binary process, through the identification of urban versus 
non-urban land-uses. Most urban cells at these dimensions 
comprise a mix of different land-uses. For instance, a cell 
classified as urban land-use may covered by 60% built-up 
surface and 40% open-space surface. This causes an 
erroneous estimation of urban expansion pattern. This paper 
proposes an urban expansion model that enables modelling 
three urban classes: low-density urban, medium-density 
urban and high-density urban. Cadastral datasets (CAD) are 
used to set urban densities. The MLR is employed to model 
future urban expansion in Wallonia, Belgium. Frist, urban 
land-use maps are prepared for years 2000 and 2010 based 
on CAD data. Next, the MLR model is applied to correlate 
the observed urban expansion pattern for different urban 
densities with a number of indicators related to distances, 
topological, neighborhood, socioeconomic factors and land-
use policies. Finally, the MLR’s outcomes will be utilized to 
model urban expansion scenarios for years 2020 and 2030 
based on linear extrapolation of observed urban expansion 
between 2000 and 2010. Relative operating characteristic 
(ROC) method validates the MLR’s outcomes. 
This paper focuses on assessing the change from non-
urban land-use (reference class) into one of urban density 
classes. The paper is organized as follows. Section II 
introduces the case study area, urban expansion model and 
data. Section III wraps up the results and discussions. 
Section IV concludes the paper findings.

MATERIAL AND METHODS 
A. Study area 
Wallonia (south Belgium) is landlocked, accounts for 
55% of the territory of Belgium with a total area of 16,844 
km². 
It 
comprises 
five 
provinces: 
Hainaut, 
Liège, 
Luxembourg, Namur, and Walloon Brabant. The main urban 
areas are Charleroi, Liège, Mons and Namur. They are all 
characterized by a historical city-center, around which the 
urban development expanded. The total population in 2010 
was 3,498,384 inhabitants that makes up a third of Belgium 
population (Fig. 1). 
B. Outline of the model 
The analysis presented here consists of two main parts: 
(I) estimating probability maps of three urban classes (low, 
medium and high-density urban) versus non-urban class and 
(II) develop future urbanization scenarios for years 2020 and 
2030.

The dependent variables (changes from non-urban to one 
of urban density classes) for the MLR model is defined using 
CAD. CAD is a vector dataset representing buildings in two 
dimensions as polygons. Each building comes with different 
attributes from which the construction date is the most 
important attribute for our study. Using the construction date, 
two urban land-use raster-grids were generated for 2000 and 
2010 years. First, CAD vector data were rasterized at a very 
fine cell dimension 2x2m. The rasterized cells were then 
aggregated to obtain a 50x50m raster-grid. Thus, each 
aggregated cell has a density value that exhibits the number 
of rasterized 2x2m cells. The magnitude of density value is 
then used to represent four urban classes: (class0) non-urban, 
(class1) low-density urban, (class2) medium-density urban 
and (class3) high-density urban. Geometrical interval 
classification method is used to set thresholds that define 
urban land-use classes (table I). This classification scheme 
works fairly well on continuous data.

The independent variables for the MLR model (X), 
urbanization driving forces, are selected based on expert 
knowledge of our study area as well as on literature review 
[6][7]. Table II summarizes the complete list of the selected 
urbanization driving forces. A zoning map (land-use policy) 
was developed by discerning the zones where urban 
development is not permitted and the zones that are 
designated for urban based on the regional development 
plan. All data used in this study is represented at 50x50m 
raster-grid square. The independent variables are measured 
in different units and therefore we standardized all 
continuous X. If some of X comparatively measure the same 
phenomena, then strong collinearities will cause the 
erroneous 
estimation 
of 
the 
MLR’s 
parameters. 
Consequently, a multicollinearity test was examined in the 
initial stage using the variance inflation factors (VIF). 
Montgomery and Runger (2003) recommended that the VIFs 
should not exceed 4. The VIF test results for all X suggest 
that the variables digital elevation model (DEM) and slope 
measure the same phenomena and that is also represented 
between population density and employment rate. In a 
refining stage, the DEM and employment rate variables have 
been suppressed. The VIF values for the refining stage 
implies that all X variables included in this stage show a very 
low degree of multicollinearity and therefore are introduced 
in the MLR. Both dependent and independent variables may 
exhibit spatial autocorrelation, which may have biased the 
results of the regression analysis [9]. These issue can be 
addressed through a data sampling approach [5][7]. For the 
model calibration, 45000 cells were randomly selected. Cells 
that were urban in 2000 were not included in the samples.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
Fig. 2 shows different urban density classes of the 
observed 2000 urban land-use. High-density urban lands are 
concentrated in the existing urban centers. Medium-density 
lands tend to be located around cities in suburbs and low-
density lands tend to be found in rural and remote locations.  
The MLR’s outcomes are probability of urbanization 
maps for each class based on vectors of regression 
coefficients β and intercepts α. Table III gives the MLR’s 
results. All explanatory variables are statistically significant 
on one or more urban classes.

The impact of different drivers varies along with urban 
density. Urban expansion of all urban density classes are 
extremely correlated with zoning status (X15). Distances to 
Road1 and Road2 (X3 and X4) have a noticeable impact on 
the development of high density projects (class3). The 
impact of distance to Road4 (X6), is generally decreasing 
with increasing urban densities. 
The ROC-values of the probability maps of 2000-2010 
are 0.94, 0.93 and 0.88 for classes 1, 2 and 3 respectively. 
That means the probability maps can be used for reliable 
predictions of the future urban expansion patterns.  
The assessed probability maps for the period 2000–2010 
have been used to generate spatially-explicit urbanization 
scenarios for 2020 and 2030 by (I) quantifying the necessary 
area for future expansion for each urban density class and 
(II) selecting the cells with the highest values from 
urbanization probability maps for each class until the 
required areas are met. This generates urban expansion map 
for each 2020 and 2030. Next, the expansion maps are 
combined with the 2010 actual map to produce the urban 
distribution map. Waterbodies, that are defined using zoning 
plan, are introduced as a constrained. 
The future necessary areas for each density class are 
calculated on the basis of a linear extrapolation of the actual 
urban expansion between 2000 and 2010. The urban area is 
expected to increase, given the actual 2010 urban area, to 
3.6% in 2020 and to 10.1% in 2030. The percentage of each 
urban density class expansion to the total expansion between 
2000 and 2010 were about 56% low-density, 35% medium-
density and 9% high-density lands. These percentages are 
then used to estimate the required urban lands in 2020 and 
2030 for each urban density class (Fig. 3).

CONCLUSIONS 
This paper employs the MLR model to examine drivers 
of urban expansion in Wallonia (Belgium) and to forecast 
near-future urban expansion using Belgian cadastral data 
(CAD). Four classes, non-urban, low-density, medium-
density and high-density urban, are defined as dependent 
variables for the MLR. Urban expansion for each urban class 
versus non-urban class is predicted for 2020 and 2030 based 
on 2000 and 2010. Several variables are selected and 
introduced in the MLR model as independent variables. It 
was found that all the independent variables have impacts on 
urban expansion in Wallonia, but their relative importance 
are varied with density. However, it can be concluded that 
policies, 
number 
of 
existing 
urban 
lands 
within 
neighborhood and accessibility are the most important 
determinants of urban expansion process. A validation of the 
MNL showed that the model’s outcomes allows to predict 
future urban expansion patterns with a relatively high 
explanatory power.  
Based on liner extrapolation of urban expansion between 
2000 and 2010, expansion scenarios are proposed to simulate 
2020 and 2030 urban patterns. This study’s findings would 
help decision makers and urban planners in enhancing 
understanding of urban expansion in Wallonia. Most 
importantly, it can serve as input to hydrological modelling. 
Finally, future extension of this research will be 
dedicated to analyze the urbanization process within existing 
medium and low-density urban areas instead of only 
studying the change from non-urban to one of urban density 
classes.
