Abstract— The contamination of water by heavy metals 
like Pb is a huge problem for the environment. In this paper, 
we test Ceratophyllum demersum L. plants as phytoindicator. 
These were exposed to different concentrations of Pb for 1–21 
days, under hydroponic conditions, where they exhibited both 
adsorption and absorption efficiency. These efficiencies 
influenced in concentration and duration in a dependent 
manner. For the three initial treatments 0.125, 0.250, 0.500 
µg/ml, the values of regression coefficients described the 
occurred variance on the rapid decrease in the Pb 
concentration in the hydroponic media, reflecting highest 
removal efficiency by C. demersum. Significant variation (P< 
0.05) was recorded between the concentration of Pb 
accumulated in C. demersum at 0.125 and 0.250 µg/ml, while a 
highly significant value (P<  0.01) was recorded between them 
at  0.500 µg/ml. The regression coefficient denotes the 
pronounced impact of treatment concentration on the 
accumulation rate (R^2 = 0.9987). The adsorption efficiency of 
C. demersum appeared to be influenced by the Pb hydroponic 
media concentration, where after 21 days, the higher Pb 
adsorption was recorded at 0.125 µg/ml and the lowest one was 
obtained at 0.500 µg/ml. Results suggest that plants responded 
positively to the increase of Pb concentrations and they 
accumulated a high amount of metal. Due to metal removal 
coupled with detoxification potential, the plant appears to have 
potential for its use as phytoremediator species in aquatic 
environments.

INTRODUCTION 
Pb is a very persistent element, which has been used in 
the past and is still used nowadays. This is the cause that is 
one of the most frequent inorganic contaminants in water 
[1]. It is potentially toxic even at low concentrations and 
above 15 µg/ L in drinking water, is considered as a risk for 
human 
health 
[2]. 
Many 
industries, 
such 
as 
the 
petrochemical, painting and coating, newsprint, smelting, 
metal electroplating, 
mining, plumbing and battery 
industries, discharge lead (Pb) into the environment without 
adequate purification in some cases [3].  
The presence of lead in wastewater is dangerous for the 
aquatic flora and fauna even in relatively low concentration 
and stringent environmental regulations attract the attention 
of chemists and environmental engineers for its control [4]. 
While the focus has turned towards remediation with 
regards to preventing human exposure, much is still needed 
in the way of determining appropriate measures to monitor 
and protect the aquatic environment, particularly with 
regards to point source pollution [5].  
Macrophytes (Aquatic plants) confirm very well too 
many of the criteria listed for an "ideal" biomonitor 
organism: they are sedentary, visible to the naked eye, easy 
to collect, simple to handle and easy to identify in the field. 
Also, they concentrate metals and nutrients in their tissues 
and reflect the environmental contamination [6]. Some 
species have the expressive ability of bioconcentration, and 
therefore, increased accumulation, of nutrients and heavy 
metals [7]. Further, the high concentration of some elements 
in plant tissues may be the result of the substantial 
availability 
of 
those 
elements 
in 
the 
surrounding 
environment. In this way, macrophytes can be used as 
bioindicators. Some of those species can also be used to 
remove, degrade or transform harmful hazardous materials, 
present in the aquatic environment. This application of 
plants, as phytoremediators, highly depends on factors, 
which define the absorption, accumulation and organic 
production of each taxon. In the case of Ceratophyllum 
demersum, it grows in water heavily polluted either by 
domestic sewage or by agricultural wastes [8]. It is known 
that the high accumulation of heavy metals like Cd, Cu, Cr, 
Pb, and Hg, are very usual in this kind of wastes [9][10]. 
 Recently, substantial accumulation and high tolerance 
of Pb has been reported in C. demersum [11] when it is 
exposed to various concentrations of Pb, exhibited both 
phytotoxic and tolerance responses. Accordingly, the aim of 
this research was to determine the Pb removal efficiency by 
C. demersum, through investigating its absorption and

adsorption capability, under hydroponic conditions.

II.
MATERIAL AND METHODS 
In this section, we explain the material used in the 
experiment and the methods. In the first section, we present 
the apparatus used, in section b present the grown condition, 
sequently we show the preparation of lead as a heavy metal 
contaminant, and finally, we present the protocol of the 
experiment. 
A.
Experimental apparatus 
Ceratophyllum demersum L. was grown in a growth 
chamber equipped with holding tanks, lighting systems, 
aeration system, and temperature- monitoring system. Hold 
tanks used in this design have consisted of three boxes, each 
box for each pollutant concentration. Each box (25 x 100 x 
30 cm) was divided into four compartments: one 
compartment was used as a control, while the others 
received the different pollutant concentrations. Moreover, 
each compartment (25 x 25 x 30 cm) was filled with 10 L of 
Hoagland nutrient solution; where it was previously used to 
improve cucumber grow [12]. The light intensity of 1950 
lux provided by the artificial lighting system was used to be 
similar to that of natural lighting required for aquatic plants. 
Also, an aeration unit was installed for each compartment 
to provide oxygen for aquatic plants.  
The air flows from the main laboratory supply to a 
manifold with four outlets. Each outlet was connected to the 
aerator which was located in each compartment. Further, the 
dissolved oxygen daily monitored and was ranged between 
7-7.5 mg/l. The water and the ambient air temperature were 
monitored during the experimental period. Besides, the 
thermometer was used to measure the ambient air 
temperature above the water surface in each box and also to 
measure the water temperature in each compartment. 
B. Plant material and growth conditions 
Ceratophyllum demersum L. (Coontail or hornwort, 
family Ceratophyllaceae) is a submerged macrophyte of 
broad geographical distribution and is widely used in 
wastewater treatments. It is selected because it grows 
quickly, has high biomass, and has been found to 
accumulate metals in its leaves and stem. It is a completely 
submersed plant and commonly seen in ponds, lakes, 
ditches, and quiet streams with moderate to high nutrient 
levels [13]. It does not produce roots, instead, it absorbs all 
the nutrients it requires from the surrounding water. Also, it 
grows rapidly in shallow, muddy, quiescent water bodies at 
low light intensities. If it is growing near the lake bottom, it 
will form modified leaves, which it uses to anchor to the 
sediment. However, it can float free in the water column and 
sometimes forms dense mats just below the surface. The 
plant reproduces by fragments breaking from the parent 
plant. 
 Samples were taken from plants growing in the 
mainstream of the River Nile bank at Sohag Governorate, 
south Egypt. The plants were grown in a growth chamber, 
where they were grown hydroponically. Before the start of 
the experiment, whole plants of Ceratophyllum were 
thoroughly cleaned under running tap water to remove 
debris and other foreign particles and then rinsed in 
redistilled water. The plants were transferred to the system 
and kept for 2 weeks in Hoagland nutrient solution (Cleland 
and Briggs Formulation) to acclimatize before starting the 
experiment and adding the contaminant. The nutrient 
solution was aerated continuously to achieve constant 
stirring and buffered to pH 5.8 with NaOH or HCL. 
C. Preparation of lead as a heavy metal contaminant 
Three concentrations of lead were investigated in this 
study (125, 250, and 500 µg/l). The lead element was used 
as Lead nitrate Pb (NO3)2. All the concentrations were 
calculated based on the individual element versus their 
compound form. The reagents were dissolved in bidistilled 
water to achieve the appropriate contamination level. After 
the adaptation period, the contaminants were added to the 
three compartments receiving three treatments. 
D. Experimental protocol 
One box (four compartments) was used for each 
treatment. Each compartment received 10 L of water and the 
recommended amount of nutrient solution. About 100 g 
healthy fresh weight of C. demersum was placed in each of 
the four compartments in the holding tank assigned for the 
different treatments: A control in each box, with modified 
Hoagland nutrient solution and three Pb treatments: 125, 
250, and 500 µg/l of Pb. Each treatment was replicated three 
times. A constant volume of water was maintained in the 
aquaria by the addition of redistilled water. Moreover, the 
lighting system was turned on and was controlled with a 
timer, which was adjusted to achieve 11 h light and 13 h 
dark.  
The plants were left for 2 weeks to adapt to the new 
environment. After the acclimatization period, the desired 
amounts of lead were added to the treatment compartment of 
each holding tank. Temperature readings were recorded 
every day in order to monitor the change in the water (21 ± 
2 0C during the light period and 20 ± 2 0C during dark 
periods) and the ambient air temperatures (25 ± 2 0C) during 
the experimental period. The growth of the individual plant 
was also observed on a daily basis. The entire experiment 
was reported. The plants were treated under the above-
mentioned laboratory conditions for a period of 21 days. 
E. Sampling and analysis 
Water samples of 15 ml were collected from all 
compartments at 1, 10, and 21 days intervals for lead 
analyses. A polarography and voltammetry 797 VA 
Computrace Ω Metrohm Ltd CH-9101 Herisau, Switzerland 
was used for Pb analyses. Lead concentration values are 
expressed as µg / L (Ppp). Batch adsorption experiments

were performed for all compartments at 1, 10, and 21 days 
intervals for lead analyses by using 0.2 g F.W of plant 
material (leaves or stems) with 10 ml of freshly prepared 
solution of MgCl2 containing 100g/L was added.  
The container flasks were caped and shaken at 200 rpm 
at room temperature for one hour. After thorough mixing 
the solution was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min, 
Supernatant was collected for Pb concentration analyses. 
Plant samples (5 g each) were collected at the start, at 10 
days, and at the end of the experiment and analyzed for the 
presence of lead. Harvested plants were thoroughly washed 
in distilled water and then separated among stems and 
leaves. The plant samples were dried in a convection oven 
for 24 h at 48 oC to determine the accumulation of 
contaminants. After drying, the plants were ground to a fine 
powder.  
For analysis, dry plant material was digested according 
to the wet digestion procedure involving concentrated nitric 
acid [14]. 10 ml concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and 0.5 ml 
hydrofluoric acid (HF) were added to 0.5 g of dry plant 
sample in a closed Teflon vessel, was designed for the 
purpose, at a temperature of 130 oC for 24h. Digestion in 
solution continues until clear. The resultant liquid was 
diluted up to 25 ml with distilled water then stored for 
analysis. Then the Pb was determined by Perkin–Elmer 
2380 atomic absorption spectrophotometer. 
III. RESULTS 
In this section we presented he results. The different data 
were analyzed statistically by ANOVA and regression 
investigated using the basic statistic module of Statistical 
software (StatSoft Inc., ’99 edition, kernel release 5.5 A). 
Homogeneity of variances and normality of variables tests 
were performed

Lead removal from nutrient media 
Results revealed an increasing trend of Pb removal with 
time in all the experimental sets. The changes in Pb 
concentration in the nutrient medium over the duration of 
the experiment are shown in Figure 1. Removal of lead at its 
low initial treatment 0.125 µg/ml over time is shown in 
Figure 1, it reduced to 0.0833µg/ml within the 1st day. The 
Pb removal continued over the remaining days of the 
experiment and decreased to 0.056 µg/ml after 10 days and 
to 0.0437 µg/ml by the end of the experiment. The decrease 
of Pb concentration in the nutrient medium with an initial 
value of 0.250 µg/ml is shown in Figure 1. the concentration 
of Pb was sharply decreased to 0.1848 µg/ml after the 1st
day of the experiment. Meanwhile, the concentration of Pb 
was reduced to 0.1277 µg/ml and 0.1099 µg/ml after 10 and 
21 days, respectively. The removal of lead at its high initial 
value of 0.500 µg/ml is shown in Figure 1. It appears that 
there is an increasing trend in lead removal all over the 
experimental period. Where, Pb concentration decreased to 
0.4108, 0.3211, and 0.2102 µg/ml after 1, 10, 21 days, 
respectively.  
The highest removal was recorded on the last day in all 
the experimental sets. For all the three initial treatment 
0.125, 0.250, 0.500 µg/ml, the values of regression 
coefficients using exponential model are R2:0.8475, 0.8342 
and 0.9696. This described the occurred variance of the 
rapid decrease in the Pb concentration. The exponential 
model is represented in the equation 1, 2 and 3 for the 
treatment of 0.125, 0.250, 0.500 µg/ml respectively. 
All treatments achieved the highest removal efficiency 
(Table 1) at the end of the experiment, while the lowest 
treatment 0.125 µg/ml recorded the highest removal 
efficiency (65%) than the others.

Lead absorption 
An increase in lead absorption by C. demersum was 
detected with the different applied treatments Figure 2. The 
initial concentration of Pb in the plant biomass was 1.0704 
µg/g at 0.125 µg/ml. After one day, the lead content 
increased up to 1.5442 µg/g. With an increase in duration, a 
sharp increase in metal accumulation rate was recorded, 
since lead content was 4.4224 µg/g after 10 days and 8.5289 
µg/g after 21 days. The same trend in accumulation pattern 
was recorded for the applied initial treatments 0.250 µg/ml 
Figure 2. Where the initial concentration of Pb was 1.3766 
µg/g.  After one day treatment, the concentration reached 
3.1625 µg/g but after 10 days the accumulation increased up 
to 9.3569 µg/g. By the end of the experiment, it was 
13.5341 µg/g. The initial concentration of Pb in the higher 
treatment (0.500 µg/ml of Pb) was 0.6647 µg/g then 
increased to 3.4918 µg/g  after the 1st day and 13.0933 µg/g 
after 10days. By the end of the experiment, the amount of 
Pb absorbed by C. demersum reached up to 21.5744 µg/g. 
The experiment showed that the lead uptake by C. 
demersum occurs very rapidly over time with different types 
of treatments. The values of R2 were 0.9987, 0.9649, and 
0.9831 respectively (with a linear model). The linear model 
is represented for equation 4, 5 and 6 for the treatment of 
0.125, 0.250, 0.500 µg/ml respectively.

Significant variation (P< 0.05) was recorded between the 
concentration of Pb accumulated in C. demersum growing at 
0.125 and 0.250 µg/ml, while a highly significant value (P< 
0.01) was recorded between them at 0.500µg/ml. The 
concentration of Pb at the end of the experiment (after 21 
days of treatment) demonstrated that the uptake of Pb by                    
C. demersum increased with increasing metal concentration. 
After 21 days, the higher Pb accumulation was recorded 
at 0.500 µg/ml treatment and the lowest with those of 0.125 
µg/ml. The regression coefficient denotes the pronounced 
impact of treatment concentration on the accumulation rate 
(R = 99.8%). 
C.
 Lead adsorption (exchangeable fraction) 
The effect of contact time on the extent of adsorption of 
lead on C. demersum over the duration of the experiment is 
illustrated in Figure 3. The initial concentration of Pb, in the 
lower treatment (0.125 µg/ml), adsorbed on the tested plant 
was 0.3099 µg/g and it reached up to 0.331 µg/g after one 
day, 1.6574 µg/g after 10 days and 1.6792 µg/g at the end of 
the experiment. At 0.250 µg/ml Pb treatment, the 
concentration of the adsorbed Pb increased from 0.443 
µg/g to 0.7429 µg/g within one day and reached up to 
1.8806 µg/g after 10 days.  
At the end of the experiment (after 21 days), the 
adsorption of lead on C. demersum was diminished to 
1.4157 µg/g. The initial concentration of Pb adsorbed on the 
plant was 0.4876 µg/g at 0.500 µg/ml. After one day the 
adsorbed Pb fraction was 1.3084 µg/g and 3.0178 µg/g after 
10 days. With an increase in duration, a sharp decrease in 
metal adsorption rate was recorded, where the adsorbed Pb 
fraction was 0.897 µg/g after 21 days. For all the three 
initial treatment 0.125, 0.250, 0.500 µg/ml, the values of R 
are 0.9784, 0.9974 and 0.9909, respectively. The polynomic 
model of 2 degrees is represented in equations 7, 8 and 9.

 The final adsorption of lead on C. demersum after 21 
days treatment is shown in Figure 3. The adsorption of Pb 
by 
C. 
demersum decreased with increasing metal 
concentration. After 21 days, the higher Pb adsorption was 
recorded at 0.125 µg/ml treatment and the lowest one was 
recorded with 0.500 µg/ml, the regression coefficient 
denotes the important impact of treatment concentration on 
the adsorption rate. 
IV. DISCUSSION 
The results obtained from the experiment indicated that 
C. demersum can accumulate and adsorb a high amount of 
Pb in concentration and duration dependent manner. With an 
increase in duration, metal accumulation increased while 
adsorption decreases after 10 days. The maximum rate of 
metal accumulation was found after 21 days when about 
(21.57µg/ g at 0.500 µg/ml) of the total metal was taken up 
by the plant. Being without roots and having forked leaves 
with thin cuticle, C. demersum can efficiently uptake metals 
from aquatic bodies through its large surface area with no 
complication of root– shoot metal partitioning. These 
features thus contributed to adequate Pb accumulation 
observed in this study.  
A 
comparison 
between 
initial 
and 
final 
metal 
concentrations within the plant had shown that the final 
concentrations were more than 7, 12, 21 folds of the initial 
metal concentration, in the nutrient media, at 0.125, 0.250, 
and 0.500 µg/ml, respectively. Biosorption is the first stage 
of metal accumulation. It involved adsorption of metal onto 
the cell wall of microorganisms, algae, and aquatic 
macrophytes, independently of metabolism [15]. Adsorption 
processes on the biosurface involve the release of hydrogen 
ions or the other cations and the adsorption or surface 
complexing of metal ions. Adsorption fraction represents 
very loosely bound elements and may regulate and/or reflect 
the composition of surface water [16].  
From the work presented here, C. demersum could be an 
effective biosorbent for lead under dilute metal conditions. 
This plant adsorbed an appreciable amount of Pb from the 
water up to 1.3 Fold at 0.125, 1.4 fold at 0.250, and 2.6 fold 
at 0.500µg/ml after 10 days. However, the adsorbed fraction 
increased after the 10th day. This suggests saturation of a 
finite number of binding sites on the plant cell surface after 
exposure to Pb, and possibly the advent of metabolism 
dependent transport of metal to the inner cell mass [17], 
[18]. This decrease in the rate of adsorption could also be 
explained by the decrease of Pb concentration in the water, 
which causes a reduced concentration gradient.  
According to Guilizzoni [19] and Keskinkan [20], there 
is, however, scarce research about heavy metal uptake by 
submerged aquatic plants. The use of submerged aquatic 
macrophytes for wastewater treatment is therefore still at an 
experimental stage, with species like Potamogeton spp. 
[21],[22],[23], 
Ceratophyllum 
demersum 
[7] 
and 
Myriophyllum spicatum [20] being tested. Bader and Fawzy 
[24], reported that C. demersum proved to be an effective 
biosorbent and bioaccumulator for Pb rending the species of 
interest for use in phytoremediation and bio-monitoring of 
polluted waters.  
The rootless submerged plant C. demersum was found 
capable of removing comparatively higher amounts of Pb 
from pond water. This agrees with the earlier report [25] 
that submerged plants had higher metal uptake ability due to 
more surface/biomass ratio.

V.
CONCLUSIONS 
In the course of this study, it was concluded that: C. 
demersum proved to be an effective biosorbent and bio-
accumulator for Pb. This plant was found to accumulate 7, 
12, 21 folds of the initial metal concentration, in the 
nutrient media, at 0.125, 0.250, and 0.500 µg/ml, 
respectively after 21 days. Also, it can absorb an appreciable 
amount of Pb from the water up to 1.3 Fold at 0.125, 1.4 
fold at 0.250, and 2.6 fold at 0.500µg/ml after 10 days. 
Being widely distributed and fast-growing submerged 
plants, C. demersum can be utilized as a safe and cost-
effective tool for the removal of Pb from low to medium 
strength wastewater.  
The use of submerged aquatic macrophytes for 
wastewater treatment is still at an experimental stage. 
Studies with regard to aquatic macrophytes combinations to 
be used in treatment ponds and the period of macrophyte 
replacement should be seriously undertaken for developing 
a more efficient, natural and economic integrated 
macrophyte based system, most advantageous for heavy 
metal removal. 
In future works the performance of C. demersum and 
other aquatic plants will be investigated using multi-
elements solution instead of mono-element one to test their 
potentials to remediate polluted waste water containing 
various toxic metals
