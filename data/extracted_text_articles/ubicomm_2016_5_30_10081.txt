Abstract – In this paper, we present initial concepts of
Internet of Things (IoT), whose technology combines Internet
and day-to-day objects. We present, as well, the concept of
middleware, which is a piece of software that connects software
and hardware. After studying several scientific publications,
we cover and analyze problems and challenges identified in the
implementation of middleware for IoT. Applying knowledge
acquired from these documents, we list the principal, recurring
problems in adopting middleware for IoT, presenting and
describing these problems in detail. Finally, we conclude on
how these problems can affect and harm the adoption of
middleware for IoT.
Keywords: Internet of Things; Middleware; Heterogeneous
network.

INTRODUCTION
The term “Internet of Things” was possibly introduced in
1999, during a lecture delivered by the British innovator
Kevin Ashton at Procter & Gamble (P&G) [1]. According to
Ashton, computers are very dependent on humans. His idea
is that “things” could generate information without needing a
human being. He claims that this would bring many benefits
to the industry and
to humanity, such as, increased
information
extraction,
increased
productivity,
reduced
losses in the energy economy, improvements in security and
education, and much more.
In the IoT environment, we have heterogeneous devices
and networks. These differences, as well as the complexity,
may
potentially
increase
with
new
technologies.
The
middleware for IoT facilitates the use of these devices and
takes into account their heterogeneity to protect the software
from the changes that would be needed to adapt to each
device the software is connected to [2]. The IoT changes the
way that we understand the world, using sensors to
continuously monitor the environment around us, providing
more
information
about
traffic,
weather,
health,
fleet
management, vehicle control, allowing the Information
Systems to provide value-added information for every single
person.
The adoption of middleware helps to avoid some
common problems in IoT development, such as:
•
Hides the heterogeneity of hardware components,
operation systems and communication protocols
•
Interconnects parts running in distributed locations
•
Provides uniformly high level of standard interfaces
for developers and application integrators, making
these applications easy to build, reuse and inter-
operate
•
Provides a set of common services to perform
various general purpose functions, avoiding repeated
efforts of the developing team [3]
However, in spite of the benefits, the adoption of
middleware for IoT also brings problems. This paper
presents a vision of the most common problems in adopting
middleware for IoT based on the work done by different
authors.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section
II, we present an overview of the main concepts of IoT. In
Section III, we present a review of the concepts related to
middleware. In Section IV, we present the most common
problems when middleware is adopted in IoT development.
Finally,
Section
V presents
the
conclusion
and
final
considerations.
II.
INTERNET OF THINGS
Internet of Things is a new technology that is growing
and gaining prominence. Every year several new devices are
developed and software is applied to this new concept.
However what is IoT and when did this term appear?
IoT is a technological revolution that has been growing
increasingly since 2009. The tendency is to last for much
greater time [4]. Even so, according to IDC, by the end of
2020, there will be somewhere around 30 billion devices
connected to the IoT world and the IoT market will see an
elevation of approximately seven billion dollars [5].
As previously mentioned, IoT is a new way to use
applied technology in devices and applications, which allows
for communication between day-to-day objects (e.g. washing
machines,
refrigerators,
air
conditioning
units)
to
the
Internet, for the purpose of supplying access to real-world
information. [6].
IoT can also be defined as a dynamic global network
infrastructure with auto-configuration capabilities based on
standard communication protocols, which are inter-operable
and virtual, in which things have physical attributes and
virtual
personalities
use
intelligent
interfaces
being
seamlessly integrated into the information network [7].
IoT has the ability to contribute to society by better
integrating devices and people, because the amount of

information made available by IoT is enormous, and based
on this information decisions that will bring benefits to the
entire world population can be taken.
Figure 1. Connection between “things” using the Internet [7]
Figure 1 illustrates all connections between “things” with
the Internet. Another feature of IoT is that it allows things
and people to be connected anywhere, anytime, with
anything or anyone.
As mentioned above, IDC says that in the coming years,
there will be over 20 billion devices. Because of that
immense amount and variety of devices, they will vary
according to their physical characteristics, features and
manufacturers. This enormous diversity causes the IoT to be
seen from different viewpoints [8].
The differences in these viewpoints refer mainly to the
differences between developers of devices, specifically
everyday objects. From the point of view of the developer,
this is owing to the fact that each developer has his or her
favorite programming language, and, as is well known, each
language has special features. In order to abstract the
language and the complexity that the developer used to
access the service provided, one of the best solutions is to
use the middleware.
III.
MIDDLEWARE
Middleware is a layer or set of software sub-layers
interposed between levels of operational and communicative
application [9]. The middleware has several features, the
primary being to hide details from different technologies,
protocols, network environments,
data replication, and
parallelism. Another feature of middleware is to exempt the
programmer from issues that are not directly linked to final
application, because middleware masks the heterogeneity of
computer architectures, operating systems, programming
languages, and network technologies [10]. In other words,
middleware acts as the glue. The goal is to connect different
systems, abstracting the diverse heterogeneous hardware
components,
operating
systems
and
communication
protocols, as well as to provide an immense amount of
interfaces for developers to integrate the final application.
In recent years, middleware obtained greater importance
in its use. Deuged says that this is due to the fact that the
middleware simplifies the development of new services, old
integrations, and new technologies [11].
Companies and business corporations are increasingly
using middleware as a solution for connecting their old
systems. Because their applications are old and often
inherited, the integration of new systems becomes totally
impractical financially, and integration is often prohibited
due to several factors, for example, to ensure data security.
Proper functioning of the features is one of the most
important motives that prohibit the integration. However,
with the use of middleware, the integration with the different
departments and systems becomes easier and its cheaper
maintenance [10].
The future of the IoT will consist of a variety of sensors
connected to a network that will store all information for all
users [10]. The article says, as well, that the IoT must be
supported by middleware that enables consumers and IoT
developers to interact in a friendly manner.
Figure 2. Interaction between software and things using
middleware [12]
Figure 2 illustrates how the IoT works with middleware.
The idea is that middleware will support a lot of different
software and allow for connection with “things.”
However, even with all these features and benefits, using
middleware with the IoT may present some challenges, such
as inter-operability, scalability, abstraction, spontaneous
interaction
between
“things,”
distributed
infrastructure,
security, privacy, and variety of middleware types [10].
Regarding the problems cited above, the proposed article
focuses on citing the main problems in the use of the IoT

with middleware. The problems and difficulties listed in this
article result from studies conducted by researchers.
IV.
PROBLEMS/DIFICULITIES WITH MIDDLEWARE FOR
IOT
A.
Security problems in IoT plataforms
Everything indicates that the IoT will have a great impact
on humanity because of the fact that it uses objects from our
everyday lives. Despite all the benefits that can be gained
with this technology, one topic that demands a lot of
attention is security in the IoT. This security problem has
even
been
the
subject
the
BlackHat
and
DEFCON
conference on issues related to hacking [13].
In a report published by [14], 70% of the IoT devices are
vulnerable to attack. The study was based on the top ten
devices most currently used. It found 250 flaws [15]. On
average, 25 vulnerabilities were found per each device
tested. The top vulnerabilities highlighted were:
•
Privacy concerns
•
Insufficient authorization
•
Lack of transport encryption
•
Insecure web interface
•
Inadequate software protection
The following scenario illustrates how complicated the
problem is: suppose a person is driving his or her car and
suddenly, without receiving the driver’s command, the
steering wheel turns alone and the driver loses control of the
car, causing a serious accident. This situation may eventually
become reality, as hackers recently broke into a state-car
system and took full control of direction [16]. In addition,
other functions may be affected in the event of an invasion in
the car system, such as turning off the seatbelts or triggering
the airbag. Research also suggests that the traditional
platforms of Web and data networks may suffer from Denial
of Service (DoS) attacks.
A major concern in the development of middleware for
the IoT has been to try to avoid security problems and data
theft, seeing that the IoT does not refer only to computers,
but also to multiple devices, “things,” which eventually will
be exposed to attacks.
A survey of low-level protocols to ensure security and
privacy in centralized and distributed scenarios of IoT is
presented in [17], and the research community aims to
improve the protocols constantly in order to address these
security challenges.
In [18] an analysis and review of available platforms for
IoT and a vision regarding security and privacy are
presented.
As seen above, the negative impacts caused by this
problem lead to one of the primary reasons that security
problem in IoT should be looked into with caution and care.
Middleware developers need to be attentive to this major
concern as regards the creation of new platforms for IoT.
The lack of well-defined protocol security could jeopardize
the advances in IoT and adoption by companies and users
[31]. A security barrier can be imposed based on the
limitations of the infrastructure of IoT itself, which still
needs to evolve in this direction so that it can have a more
solid
basis
for
the
possibility
of
more
robust
implementations.
Figure 3 shows that security has different levels of
complexity and scale in the case of security and privacy [19].
This article does not aim to explain in detail the greater
security as a whole, but it is important to show that IoT
security needs to be studied and analyzed with great care and
attention, because, as previously explained, any error or
security problem would cause the device in question to be
discontinued, or, in worse cases, the company that developed
the device could suffer loss or lawsuit.
Figure 3. The five primary reasons that cause IoT security
vulnerabilities [19]
B.
Support of application developers
It is known that the IoT is growing quite, as previously
stated, and the number of devices is predicted to reach
alarming numbers in 2020. In order to promote a greater
increase and acceleration in the development of devices, IoT
applications should have middleware with simple APIs for
the
desired
features,
preferably
with
high
levels
of
abstraction. Moreover, these APIs should be developed and
made available in a standard way, as far as possible, so that
the development of new applications and devices will be
more efficient and effective [18].
Mineraud says that most IoT platforms currently offer a
public API to use services. According to the same, the APIs
are generally based on RESTful principles allowing the use
of common operations, such as: PUT, GET, PUSH, or
92
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2016.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-505-0
UBICOMM 2016 : The Tenth International Conference on Mobile Ubiquitous Computing, Systems, Services and Technologies

DELETE. These four operations provide
support and
interaction of devices connected to the platform. But not all
platforms include the REST API to help and facilitate the
development of web services [18].
To mitigate the above problem, many platforms
provide open source libraries to carry out the connections of
different programming languages to the APIs available in
the middleware. Mineraud is still more emphatic in stating
that these links do not make a significant improvement on
developer support, seeing that these libraries offer only
basic functions such as access keys [18].
Figure 4. Number of IoT developers [30]
Figure 4 shows that the number of IoT developers is
constantly growing, which means that application developer
support is more complicated, because the problem affects
not only the larger growth of IoT devices, but also the larger
growth of IoT developers.
Finally, Mineraud concludes by starting, “We believe
that this approach should be more generalized within IoT
solutions to maximize usability of the services provided by
the IoT platforms.”[18]
C.
Processing and data sharing
The volume of data used in IoT platform tends to be
large, and the applications typically present requirements
which need to be met in real time. This volume of data
presents a stream of unlimited data, which often varies
according to time. Because of this variability, data can be
unreliable and incomplete, and there is not a desirable
quality and information regarding communication loss
account [20]. It is also worth mentioning that this data is
represented in various shapes and models. The example is a
great challenge to use directly the low-level data that the
sensors of the devices generate without having a data model
and knowledge.
The
information
and
knowledge
behind
the
data
collected are the core and basis of the wealth produced by
IoT. Therefore, the processing devices and data sharing
must be developed to ensure that the data captured by the
IoT can be used in various applications. Today, IoT
solutions do not support processing and data sharing in a
dynamic format. However, it remains possible to combine
multiple simple applications in a dynamic format, provided
that the URI to the source of the desired information is
known. However, it represents a very challenging technique
for application developers and platforms IoT [21].
The Ericsson IoT framework provides mechanisms for
virtual integration that can be combined with dynamic sites
to analyze statistical data. Furthermore, different techniques
of processing and data sharing are adapted for IoT.
According to Tsai et al. [22], mining technology research
data for the IoT try to improve the processing and sharing of
large data stream generated by IoT devices.
D.
Privacy concerns
Many IoT devices collect personal information such as
name, address, date of birth, health information, and even
credit card numbers. Those concerns are multiplied when
one adds in cloud services and mobile applications that
work with the device [23]. Too much personal information
is collected, and it is very common that this information is
not properly protected. In the end, users are not given the
choice to allow what type of data will be collected.
According to The Open Web Application Security
Project (OWASP) [24], in order to verify if the IoT device
has privacy concerns, it is necessary to determine the
following:
•
Whether all data types that are being collected by the
device are identified,
•
Whether the device and its various components
collect only what is necessary to perform its
function,
•
Whether identifiable information can be exposed
when not properly encrypted while at rest on storage
mediums and during transit over networks,
•
Who has access to personal information that is
collected,
•
Whether data collected can be de-identified or
anonymized,
•
Whether data collected is beyond what is needed for
proper operation of the device and whether the end-
user has a choice for this data collection,
•
Whether a data retention policy is in place.
An IoT device can ensure the privacy concerns by
minimizing the data collection, anonymizing the collected
93

data or giving the end user the ability to decide what data is
collected [25]
E. Integration detection technologies and activation
The essence of the IoT platform is to establish a
connection detecting and triggering heterogeneous systems
with different capabilities and limitations. In the absence of a
common standard of communication and detection, different
suppliers become accustomed to the vice of writing and
implementing their own interaction patterns and implement
different sets of communication protocols. Thus, the IoT
platform ends up having multiple and different protocols
available. Unfortunately, as a result, IoT platform value has
increased. This increase grows proportionally with the
amount and versatility of the devices supported by the
platform. An ideal platform for IoT must provide a group or
set of protocols for communication that are standardized and
thus every device ‘manufacturer can choose the set of
protocols that best adjustment in the device.[27]
For a quiet and harmonious integration with detection
and actuation of IoT devices, it is essential to define
standardized protocols for all devices, for example, in the
manner done today with constrained devices by IEFT [27]
and communications ETSI M2M and 3GPP [28]
However, the current solutions found for IoT bring a
different approach to the issue of different devices. Usually
the question of interoperability with others devices in IoT is
guaranteed through the implementation of a gateway, which
usually features an expanded capacity with the help of plug-
ins that make it possible to support new devices in a IoT
platform, thus not featuring a standardization of protocols. In
order to accelerate integration of new pattern models
devices, such as those recommended in the Smart Objects
Guidelines [29], they should be integrated in a broad and
systemic way [30].
V.
CONCLUSION AND FINAL CONSIDERATIONS
The IoT presents numerous benefits to consumers and
has the potential to change the ways that people interact with
technology.
After a brief explanation of IoT and middleware this
survey proposes to clarify the difficulties in adopting
middleware for IoT development.
From all exposed difficulties and problems in this
research, we realize that the security problem in IoT
platforms, presented in section 4, is the difficulty that
requires the greatest attention from the IoT developers.
Software for IoT involves distribution and data sharing, thus
increasing the risks of data theft.
From a security and privacy perspective, the introduction
of sensors and devices into currently intimate spaces such as
the home, the car, wearable objects, or everyday things to
detect and share observations about us increasingly deserves
special attention and concern.
There is no denying the utility of middleware assists IoT
development, but we have to be aware of some concerns
about the difficulties and problems that this survey covers in
its study.
For future researches, there is good opportunity to apply
solutions to all problems listed above or, perhaps, to choose
security as the problem most relevant to the use of
middleware for IoT.
