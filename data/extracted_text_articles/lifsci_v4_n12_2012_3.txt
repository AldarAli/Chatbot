Abstract—The emerging antibiotic resistant bacteria and their 
abilities for rapid evolution have pushed the need to explore 
alternative antibiotics less prone to drug resistance. In this 
study, 
we 
employed 
methicillin/multidrug-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a model bacterial system to 
initiate novel antibiotic development.  An in silico identification 
of drug targets in MRSA 252 strain and MRSA Mu50 strain 
respectively was described. The identified potential targets 
were classified according to their known or putative functions. 
We discovered that a class of essential non-human homologous, 
central metabolic enzymes falls into the scope of potential drug 
targets for two reasons: 1) the identified targets either do not 
have human counterparts or use alternative catalytic 
mechanisms. Based on major differences in active site 
structure and catalytic mechanism, an inhibitor of such a 
bacterial enzyme can be designed which will not inhibit its 
human 
cousin. 
2) 
attacking 
bacterial 
energy-making 
machinery bypasses the usual drug resistance sites, paving the 
road to multi-faceted approaches to combat antibiotic 
resistance.

I. 
INTRODUCTION  
 
This paper is an extended version of the previously 
published conference paper [1]. The earlier paper detailed in 
silico identification of drug targets in MRSA 252 strain and 
MRSA Mu50 strain respectively and proposed that the 
development of a new class of antibiotics may be a potential 
solution to  avoid bacterial antibiotic resistance. 
 
One of the biggest medical breakthroughs of the 
twentieth century is the discovery of antibiotics [2], which 
was immediately followed by the unfortunate emergence of 
bacterial antibiotic resistance [3].The rapid rate of bacterial 
evolution to overcome the antibiotic action, the ability of a 
single pathogen strain to resist multiple drugs, as well as the 
stunning frequency of resistance occurring constitute a 
major challenge to the medical profession [3] and thus 
raised retrospective discussions of currently existing 
antibiotics [4-6]. Although there are hundreds of antibiotics 
on the market, it remains a fact that almost all existing 
antibiotics target only four cellular functions: protein 
synthesis, nucleic acid synthesis, cell walls synthesis or 
folate synthesis [6, 7, 8]. Bacterial resistance usually arises 
as the result of evolutionary adaptation of the target proteins 
that are subject to direct antibiotic attack [3]. Repetitively 
striking the same cellular sites leads to defensive bacterial 
gene mutation, which remains the primary cause of the 
prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria [9], such as 
Methicillin/multidrug-resistant 
Staphylococcus 
aureus 
(MRSA) [10], Multidrug or Extensively Drug-Resistant 
Tuberculosis (MDR TB or XDR TB) [11,12], NDM-1 
induced antibiotic -resistant Escherichia coli [13], etc. 
Hence, exploration of novel antibiotics with alternative 
modes of action is of great urgency [8]. The task falls on the 
shoulders of academia due to the fact that the 
pharmaceutical industry has ceased investing in antibiotic 
discovery owing to high cost, lengthening developing 
cycles, complexities and low profits along with failure of 
several recent investments in target-based approaches [14]. 
 
In this study, we employed MRSA as a model bacterial 
system because it is the most common bacterial pathogen 
isolated from humans [15, 16] with a significant morbidity 
and mortality [17]. The first MRSA case presented in the 
United Kingdom in 1961[18]. Shortly after, more variations 
were identified to be immune to β-lactam antibiotics 
(including 
penicillin, 
methicillin, 
oxacillin, 
and 
cephalosporins [19, 20]). Newly discovered MRSA strains 
have evolved to survive sulfa drugs, such as tetracyclines, 
and clindamycin [21]. Glycopeptide antibiotics, such as 
vancomycin and teicoplanin, considered drugs of "last 
resort", were used for the treatment of MRSA infections 
[22, 23]. However, recently discovered MRSA strains 
showed resistance even to vancomycin and teicoplanin [24, 
25].  As of 2007, one variant found was resistant to six 
major kinds of antibiotics [26]. The beginning signs of 
MRSA infections are skin infections that resemble pimples, 
boils or spider bites.  In immune-deficient patients, localized 
skin infections quickly spread through the bloodstream 
causing vital organ infections and possible death [27]. In a 
2007 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention press 
release, there were about 94,000 cases of MRSA infections, 
contributing to around 19,000 deaths in the United States, 
which implies a mortality rate higher than that caused by 
HIV [28, 29]. The current treatment for MRSA infections is

still 
traditional 
broad-spectrum 
antibiotics 
such 
as 
lincosamides, sulfa drugs, glycopeptides [30-32], among 
which linezolids [33] daptomycin [34], Trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole and MoxifloxacinHCl  were considered 
relatively more effective [35, 36] though MRSA infections 
have become increasingly difficult to treat [31-33]. Thus, 
alternative treatments precisely targeting the root cause of 
MRSA infections needs to be established. 
 
Novel antibiotic development starts with target screening 
[37]. In this paper, we reported the preliminary results of 
anti-MRSA drug development, i.e., a systematic in silico 
approach for the identification of drug targets in two MRSA 
strains, MRSA 252 and MRSA Mu50 based on the 
following two criteria: essentiality to pathogen survival and 
absence from the human genome [38, 39]. A special list of 
enzymes targeting bacterial metabolism was identified, 
shedding light on a potentially new approach for antibiotic 
development. 
II. 
METHODS 
The objective of this study was to determine potential 
drug targets for alternative treatment of MRSA infections, to 
predict their enzymatic functions and to further shorten the 
list. We employed a reported in silico approach through a 
systematic and justified method [39, 40] for the 
identification of drug targets of MRSA infections following 
two criteria: essential to the survival MRSA and absent in 
the humans [38, 39]. 
 
MRSA genome National Center for Biotechnology 
Information (NCBI) gene bank contains at present complete 
genomic sequences of 13 MRSA strains. In this study, 
genomic sequences of MRSA 252 strain and MRSA Mu50 
stain were studied respectively. 
 
Sequence retrieval The genomic sequences of MRSA 252 
and MRSA Mu50 were retrieved from the NCBI database 
respectively [41]. A total of 2656 genes from MRSA 252 
strain and 2697 genes from MRSA Mu50 stain were purged 
at 90 % and 60% using CD-HIT [42] to remove paralogous 
or duplicate proteins. 
 
Blasp against the database of essential genes (DEG) The 
resulting sequences were run through DEG [43] at an 
expectation (E-value) cutoff of 10-4. The database of 
essential genes includes genes required for basic survival of 
Staphylococcus aureus, as well as more than 10 other 
bacteria, such as E. coli, B. subtilis, H. pylori, S. 
pneumoniae, M. genitalium and H. influenzae,etc. 
 
Blasp against human genome The essential genes 
identified were subjected to BLASTP against the human 
genome (both refseq and nonrefseq) [44] to exclude any 
genes that have a significant match (E-value cutoff of 10-3 
and lower) with human homologs. Genes having BLAST E-
scores less than 10-3 were considered as having no close 
relatives in human.  
 
 
Protein function assignment Information on the function 
of the identified proteins was derived from the annotated 
genome sequence through Integr8-Inquisitor [45] and/or 
EMBL/EBI/InterProScan [46].  
 
Metabolic pathway study MRSA Metabolic pathways 
were obtained from KEGG database  [47]. 
 
Amino Acid Alignment Analysis The interested protein 
sequences were submitted to SDSC Biology Workbench 
[48] for alignment in order to identify orthologs. 
 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The goal of this investigation was to determine potential 
drug targets for alternative treatment of MRSA infections 
and to classify and to analyze the identified targets. Out of 
the complete genomes of 13 MRSA strains that were 
sequenced and deposited in the NCBI gene bank, MRSA 
252 and MRSA Mu50 were selected due to the fact that the 
former is a common strain in the USA [49] and the UK [50] 
and the latter, a methicillin and vancomycin resistant strain 
isolated in Japan [51] is commercially available for future 
molecular biological study (ATCC). The common method 
of drug target identification encompasses two steps: the 
identification of essential genes for bacterial viability [37] 
and the identification of genes absent in the human genome 
[38]. The former was performed by adopting the DEG 
database in our approach because this database compiles a 
list of all currently available essential genes in more than 10 
prokaryotes including Staphylococcus aureus [41] and 
proved to be more accessible than conventional tools [39, 
40]. On the other hand, the availability of the human 
genome sequence [52, 53] renders the latter step feasible. 
Following two newly published genomic analysis methods 
[39, 40], 2656 MRSA 250 and 2697 Mu50 genes were 
purged at 90 % and 60% using CD-HIT to remove

499 and 496 essential genes identified were subjected to 
BLASTP against the human genome [52, 53] to exclude any 
genes that have a significant match (E-value threshold of 
10-3 and lower) with human homologs. Consensually, 133 
MRSA 252 and 134 Mu50 genes respectively were 
considered as having no close relatives in humans. The 
results are summarized in table 1. Their known or putative 
functions annotated by Integr8-Inquisitor [46] and/or 
EMBL/EBI/InterProScan [47] are listed in table 2.  
 
     Among 
the 
133 
and 
134 
essential 
non-human 
homologous genes in MRSA 252 and Mu50 strains, 
respectively, 133 encode proteins that are well conserved 
between the two strains. Out of this conserved set, 63 are 
involved in metabolism, 24 participate in the transmission 
of genetic information, 29 represent transmembrane 
proteins, 9 have other functions such as regulation cell 
division and  carrier proteins, etc., and 8 have unknown 
functions.  
 
     Our approach identified 14 genes in cell wall 
biosynthesis, most of which were validated by other 
research groups [54-56]. Among them, 6 are involved in the 
elongation of peptidoglycan, in agreement with previous 
studies [54, 55]. FemA family proteins are currently 
considered novel anti-staphylococcal targets due to the fact 
that they are involved in cell wall biosynthesis and 
expression of a methicillin resistance gene [56]. They are 
found to be essential in both MRSA 252 (NCBI Gene 
Accession#: 49484627 and 49483567) and Mu50 (NCBI 
Gene Accession#: 15925401 and 15924364) strains by our 
approach. Gene GI#49484133 in MRSA 252 and 
GI#15924882 
in 
Mu50 
respectively 
represent 
Staphylococcus aureus murE gene encoding UDP-N-
acetylmuramyl 
tripeptide 
synthetase, 
which 
was 
demonstrated to be essential in Staphylococcus aureus  
 
through a method incorporating an IPTG controllable 
promoter [57].  
 
Although the cell wall has long been considered an 
attractive target for antibiotic development because of its 
absence in humans, what should not be overlooked is that 
one of the most common antibiotic resistance mechanisms is 
the metamorphosis of cell-wall proteins, leading to 
antibiotic resistance. For example, β- lactam resistance was 
attributed to the expression of a group of cell wall 
penicillin-binding proteins (PBP-2’) encoded by the mecA 
gene [58, 59]. Glycopeptide resistance is also considered to 
be caused by cell wall thickening resulting in binding 
vancomysin extracellularly [60, 61] and/or alteration of the 
drug-acting site in the cell wall from D-alanine-D-alanine to 
D-alanine-D-lactate owing to the expression of vanA 
resistance 
gene 
[62]. 
Hence, 
for 
novel 
antibiotic 
development, substances that anchor in sites other than the 
bacterial cell wall may have more potential because 
resistance usually arises as the result of gene mutation on 
the target proteins that are subject to direct antibiotic attack 
[63]. A 2006 review on mechanisms of bacterial antibiotic 
resistance suggested the exploration of novel antibiotics 
with alternative mechanisms of action [5].  
Genes involved in transmission of genetic information 
including DNA replication, recombination and repair, 
transcription and RNA processing, translation, post-
translational modification remain viable targets for 
antibacterial agent development [39, 40]. Our approach 
identified 24 of these candidate genes. 
Our approach identified 29 membrane bound proteins. 
A recent review of anti-MRSA drug development 
indicated that agents anchoring in the bacterial membrane 
(e.g., 
ceragenins 
and 
lipopeptides) 
showed 
great 
bactericidal effect and less prone to drug resistance due to 
the inability of bacteria to modify their targeted cellular 
sites in a way that is compatible with their survival [64]. 
Among this pool of proteins, 19 are involved in 
membrane transport, which represent valid drug targets

because pathogens usually lose their biosynthetic 
capabilities and rely on their hosts for the supply of 
essential nutrients [65, 66]. Thus, certain membrane 
transport proteins are of great importance in maintaining 
pathogen viability. 
Our approach identified 30 energy metabolic (i.e. 
cellular respiration) genes in both MRSA 252 and MRSA 
Mu50, which are essential to staphylococcal survival with 
E-score < 10-4 but absent in human genome with E-score 
<10-3. 
Currently 
there 
are 
limited 
numbers 
of 
commercially available antibiotics targeting energy 
metabolism. Those existing are mainly biological 
reagents such as oligomycin [67] and pesticides or 
piscicides such as antimycin A [68], not commonly used 
for humans because they affect both bacterial and human 
cells. Surprisingly, nature has provided us with a group of 
energy metabolic enzymes which are essential to 
pathogen survival while absent in humans. The 
differentiation lies in that those enzymes function through 
alternative mechanisms other than their counterpart 
enzymes in humans. Accumulating in vitro [69] and in 
vivo [70] evidence suggests that enzymes catalyzing 
bacterial 
cellular 
respiration 
with 
differentiated 
mechanisms of action are promising targets for novel 
antibiotic development. The inhibitors against those 
enzymes are able to hinder bacterial growth by inhibition 
of those enzymes without interfering with their human 
cousins. Most importantly, attacking bacterial energy- 
making machinery bypasses the usual bacterial mutation

sites for drug resistance [71-72]. Hence, exploration of 
antibiotics targeting alternative cellular functions such as 
central metabolic pathways may be a promising direction, 
and selective inhibition of targets specific to bacterial 
energy metabolism may be a potentially efficacious 
alternative in the treatment of MRSA infections. The 
enzymes on the higher priority list include MRSA 
fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, MRSA acetate kinase,  
MRSA 
phosphotransacetylase, 
MRSA 
formate 
acetyltransferase and MRSA xylitol dehydrogenase, etc. 
(table 3), which either do not have human homologues or 
adopt 
dramatically 
different 
catalytic 
mechanisms 
compared to their human cousins. 
       MRSA fructose-1, 6-diphosphate aldolase (NCBI 
Gene Accession#: 49483952 and 15924701 respectively) 
showed a 100 % match to both Staphylococcus aureus 
NCTC 8325 and Staphylococcus aureus N315 in 
Database of Essential Gene (DEG) with an identical 
expectation value of e-163 [73,74], suggesting the essential 
nature of this protein. It is well known that FBPA is one 
of the key enzymes in the glycolytic pathway that 
involves the breakdown of glucose [75]. FBPA is divided 
into two classes based on structural properties and 
catalytic mechanisms [75, 76]. Class I FBPA is mainly 
found in higher order organisms (e.g., humans and 
animals). Catalysis in class I FBPA proceeds via a Schiff 
base intermediate formed by an active site lysine residue 
[75]. Class II FBPA is usually found in yeasts, bacteria, 
fungi, and parasites [76]. Catalysis in class II FBPA 
centers on the participation of a Zn (II) cofactor that 
coordinates to an enolate anion intermediate [76]. Based 
on major differences in active site structure and catalytic 
mechanism, an inhibitor of class II FBPA can be designed 
which will not inhibit class I FBPA. Thus, class II FBPA 
has long been considered as potential drug target in the 
development of antibiotics [77]. Multiple alignment of 
the sequence of MRSA FBPA with class II giardia FBPA 
and class I human FBPA was shown in Figure 1.  MRSA 
FBPA (NCBI Gene Accession#: 49484349 and 15925115 
respectively) exhibits 40.8% sequence identity to class II 
giardia FBPA while it exhibits only 18.8 % sequence

indicated in light-blue shading and similar amino acid residues are indicated in purple shading. Gaps introduced during the alignment process are indicated

identity to class I human FBPA. Thus, MRSA FBPA 
should be putatively classified into class II FBPA, not 
class I FBPA. We have cloned and purified and 
characterized 
MRSA 
FBPA 
(unpublished 
result). 
Validation of the essential nature of class II MRSA FBPA 
through allelic replacement and inducible expression is 
underway in our research group.  
MRSA acetate kinase (NCBI Gene Accession#: 
49483952 and 15924701 respectively) demonstrated a 92 
% match to Staphylococcus aureus N315 in Database of 
Essential Gene (DEG) with an expectation value of 0   
[73, 74], suggesting the essential nature of this enzyme. 
Acetate kinase catalyzes the reversible phosphorylation of 
acetate to synthesize acetyl phosphate by transfer of a 
phosphoryl group from ATP. Acetate kinases are wildly 
distributed among prokaryotes [78] and some eukaryotes 
[79]. In aerobic conditions, this enzyme converts acetate 
to acetyl-CoA, a key intermediate in TCA cycle [80]. In 
anaerobic conditions, it plays a central role in 
synthesizing 
ATP 
from 
acetyl 
phosphate 
[81]. 
Prokaryotic acetate kinases are highly conservative. 
MRSA acetate kinase exhibits 44.6 % sequence identity to 
E. coli, 48.5 % sequence identity to Salmonella 
typhimurium acetate kinase, 51.3 % sequence identity to 
Methanosarcina themophia acetate kinase and 52.0 % 
sequence identity to Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis 
acetate kinase (Figure 2). Smith group has confirmed that 
it is a key enzyme in bacterial metabolism in a number of 
important fungal and protozoan pathogens. (e.g., fungus 
Cryptococcus 
neoformans 
and 
protist 
Entamoeba 
histolytica). Its absence in humans suggests that it may 
also be a possible drug target [82]. We have cloned, 
purified 
and 
characterized 
MRSA 
acetate 
kinase 
(unpublished result). The development of crystal 
structures of MRSA acetate kinase is in progress at the 
laboratory of our collaborator Dr. Scott Lovell at the 
University of Kansas, which will allow us to preform 
structure-activity analysis as the basis of rational inhibitor 
design. 
MRSA 
phosphotransacetylase 
(NCBI 
Gene 
Accession#: 49482818 and 15923578  respectively) 
demonstrated a 93 % match to  both Staphylococcus 
aureus NCTC 8325 and Staphylococcus aureus N315 in 
Database of Essential Gene (DEG) with an identical 
expectation value of e-169   [73, 74], suggesting the 
essential nature of this enzyme. The gene encoding MRSA 
phosphotransacetylase has been cloned and the enzyme 
has been expressed in E. coli and purified. Kinetic assay 
of this enzyme is in progress.  
 
Overall, we proposed that a class of essential, central 
metabolic enzymes, such as MRSA fructose-bisphosphate 
aldolase, MRSA acetate kinase, MRSA phosphotransacetyl-
ase, MRSA formate acetyltransferase and MRSA xylitol 
dehydrogenase, etc. (table 3), which either do not have 
human homologues or functionally differentiate themselves 
from their human counterparts, are promising antibiotic 
drug targets.  Because of the alterations in active site 
structure and mode of action of such a bacterial enzyme v. s. 
its human cousin (if there is one), through rational inhibitor 
design, an inhibitor of this enzyme can be designed which 
will not inhibit its human cousin. Nevertheless, this central 
metabolic inhibitor approach potentially decreases the risk 
of bacterial resistance against the antibacterial agents in that 
it bypasses the cellular sites where currently existing 
antibiotics regularly attack. In other words, since those 
cellular sites have not been repeatedly exposed to 
antibacterial agents, central metabolic inhibitors should be 
less prone to drug resistance induced by evolutionary 
adaptation.

IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
 
One of the crucial steps in narrow-spectrum 
antibiotics development is target identification. In this 
study, a putative set of candidate drug targets were 
elucidated by an in silico approach.  The candidate genes 
are hypothetically required for survival of the candidate 
microorganisms and have no close human analogues.    
Many identified targets have been experimentally 
validated [56-59, 83-88]. By shortening the list of 
potential drug targets to a small pool of genes, the data 
presented in this paper facilitated our group and, may also 
aid other researchers in pursuing target validation and 
target characterization for alternative treatment of MRSA 
infections. Future directions include using a combination 
of kinetic assay and crystal structure development for 
enzyme characterization such as substrate recognition, 
catalytic site identification and reaction mechanism 
elucidation. Using ration drug design, tight-binding 
inhibitors will be designed followed by organic synthesis 
and in vitro evaluation. Once a nanomolar level inhibitor 
with high specificity is identified, development of X-ray 
crystal structures of enzyme-inhibitor complexes will be 
performed for further optimization. In principle, the 
premise is that the inhibitors of these targets should only 
be toxic to pathogens, but safe for use by humans. 
Proposed long-term work also includes extension of this 
approach to other bacterial systems to combat antibiotic 
resistance. It is even more crucial that this type of 
investigation is undertaken in academia than it would be 
if industry were still heavily investing in it. 
 
       This study sheds light on a potentially new class of 
MRSA antibiotics, which may pave the road to multi-
faceted approaches to combat antibiotic resistance. From 
the broader perspective, blocking central metabolic 
pathways was usually considered as a forbidden area in 
drug development due to the possibility of affecting 
human central metabolism (e.g., side effects of 
chemotherapies). If the assertion that certain central 
metabolic inhibitors are specific to pathogens not to 
humans is tested, it will reassure that we have moved in 
the right direction to tackle a major challenge.
