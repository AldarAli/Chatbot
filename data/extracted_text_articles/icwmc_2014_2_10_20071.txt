Abstract—This paper deals with Single Carrier (SC)/Frequency
Domain Equalization (FDE) as an uplink alternative to Or-
thogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) for a Multi
User (MU)-Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) system where a
”massive MIMO” approach is adopted. In this context, either an
optimum Minimum Mean-Squared Error (MMSE) linear detec-
tor or appropriate reduced-complexity linear detection techniques
are considered. Regarding performance evaluation by simulation,
two semi-analytical methods are proposed - one method in the op-
timum (MMSE) case and the other one in the reduced-complexity
cases. This paper includes performance results for uncoded 4-
Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) SC/FDE transmission
and a MU-MIMO channel with uncorrelated Rayleigh fading,
under the assumptions of perfect power control and perfect
channel estimation. The accuracy of performance results obtained
through the semi-analytical simulation methods is assessed by
means of parallel conventional Monte Carlo simulations. The
performance results are discussed in detail and we also emphasize
the achievable ”massive MIMO” effects, even for the reduced-
complexity detection techniques, provided that the number of BS
antennas is much higher than the number of antennas which are
jointly employed in the terminals of the multiple autonomous
users. Appropriate ”SC/FDE vs OFDM” comparisons are also
included in this discussion of performance results.

INTRODUCTION
Cyclic Preﬁx (CP)-assisted block transmission schemes
were proposed and developed, in the last two decades, for
broadband wireless systems, which have to deal with strongly
frequency-selective fading channel conditions. These schemes
take advantage of current low-cost, ﬂexible, Fast Fourier Trans-
form (FFT)-based signal processing technology, with both
OFDM and SC/FDE alternative choices [1][2][3]. Mixed air
interface solutions, with OFDM for the downlink and SC/FDE
for the uplink, as proposed in [2], are now widely accepted;
the main reason for replacing OFDM by SC/FDE, with regard
to uplink transmission, is the lower envelope ﬂuctuation of
the transmitted signals when data symbols are directly deﬁned
in the time domain, leading to reduced power ampliﬁcation
problems at the mobile terminals.
Also in the last two decades, the development of MIMO
technologies has been crucial for the ”success story” of broad-
band wireless communications. Through spatial multiplexing
schemes, early introduced by Foschini [4], and appropriate
MIMO detection schemes [5][6] - offering a range of per-
formance/complexity tradeoffs -, MIMO systems are currently
able to provide very high bandwidth efﬁciencies and a reliable
radiotransmission at very high data rates. In the last decade,
MU-MIMO systems [7] - able to serve multiple autonomous
users in the same time-frequency resource, thereby providing
a true ”space division multiple access” - also have been
successfully implemented and introduced in several broadband
communication standards.
In recent years, the adoption of a very large number
of antennas in the BS, much larger than the number of
Mobile Terminal (MT) antennas in its cell, was proposed in
[8][9]. This ”massive MIMO” approach has been shown to
be recommendable for several reasons [8][9]: simple linear
processing for MIMO detection becomes nearly optimal; both
MultiUser Interference (MUI) effects and fast fading effects of
multipath propagation tend to disappear; both power efﬁciency
and bandwidth efﬁciency become substantially increased.
This paper deals with SC/FDE as an uplink alternative
to OFDM [10] for a MU-MIMO system where the BS is
constrained to adopt simple, linear detection techniques, but
can be equipped with a large number of receiver antennas.
In this context, either an optimum (MMSE) linear detec-
tor or appropriate reduced-complexity, Matched Filter (MF)-
based, linear detection techniques are considered in Section II.
Regarding performance evaluation by simulation, two semi-
analytical methods are proposed in Section III - one method
in the optimum (MMSE) case and the other one in the
reduced-complexity cases -, both combining simulated channel
realizations and analytical computations of BER performance
which are conditional on those channel realizations.
In Section IV, this paper includes performance results
for uncoded 4-QAM SC/FDE transmission and a MU-MIMO
channel with uncorrelated Rayleigh fading effects regarding
the several transmitter/receiver (TX/RX) antenna pairs, under
the assumptions of perfect power control and perfect channel
estimation. The accuracy of performance results obtained
through the semi-analytical simulation methods is assessed
by means of parallel conventional Monte Carlo simulations
(involving an error counting procedure). The performance
results are discussed in detail and we also emphasize the
achievable ”massive MIMO” effects, even for the reduced-
complexity detection techniques, provided that the number of
BS antennas is much higher than the number of antennas
which are jointly employed in the terminals of the multiple

parisons are also included in this discussion of performance
results. Section V includes the main conclusions of the paper.

SYSTEM MODEL
A. SC/FDE-based Radiotransmission
We consider here a CP-assisted, SC/FDE-based, block
transmission, within a MU-MIMO system with NT TX anten-
nas and NR RX antennas - for example (but not necessarily)
one antenna per MT. We assume, in the jth TX antenna (j =
1, 2, ..., NT ), a length-N block s(j) = [s(j)
0 , s(j)
1 , ..., s(j)
N−1]T of
time-domain data symbols in accordance with the correspond-
ing binary data block. The insertion of a length-Ls CP, long
enough to cope with the time-dispersive effects of multipath
propagation, is also assumed.
The time-domain data symbols s(j)
n
(n = 0, 1, · · · , N −
1; j = 1, 2, · · · , NT ) are randomly and independently selected
from a QAM alphabet

C. Reduced-complexity Linear Detection Techniques
Instead of the optimum (MMSE) linear detector, a reduced-
complexity linear detection technique can be implemented by
replacing the Ak matrix in (4) by a diagonal A′
k matrix sharing
the same entries

in the main diagonal. Therefore, the required matrix inversion
in (4) becomes a very easy task, and the corresponding
reduced-complexity implementation of the second block in Fig.
1 (a) can be done according to Fig. 1 (b), with
C(j)

Consequently, the NT components of eYk can be decom-
posed - into ”useful signal”, MUI and ”Gaussian noise” - as
follows:

As an alternative to the C(j)

coefﬁcients given by (7) -
in the context of a simpliﬁed signal processing structure as
jointly depicted in Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b) - one can adopt
C(j)

coefﬁcients so as to meet the MMSE criterion.
It can be shown that, under the reduced-complexity con-
straint, the resulting MMSE coefﬁcients can be written as

SEMI-ANALYTICAL METHODS FOR PERFORMANCE
EVALUATION
A. Performance Evaluation Method in the Optimum (MMSE)
Case
The frequency-domain output eYk of the MMSE detector
in Fig. 1(a) can be written as

where

For 4-QAM SC/FDE transmission and optimum (MMSE)
detection, the resulting BERj (j = 1, 2, · · · , NT ) - conditional
on the channel realization {Hk; k = 0, 1, · · · , N−1} - is given
by

B. Performance Evaluation Method in the Reduced-complexity
Cases
When using the MMSE criterion under the constraint of a
simpliﬁed detection structure, based on Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b),
the C(j)

coefﬁcients are given by (9). In this case, we can still

Therefore, eqns. (15) and (16), for the SINRj are still
valid; however, due to the different Γk matrix,

in (15), in this case. Of course, the resulting BER (conditional
on the channel realization {Hk; k = 0, 1, · · · , N − 1}) can
then be computed according to eqns. (14) and (17).
With regard to the reduced-complexity technique which
uses C(j)
k
coefﬁcients according to (7) (not according to (9)),
it should be noted that it cannot be regarded, in general, as a
true ”MMSE technique”- The only exception is the case where
NT = 1, leading to α
′(j)
k
= α: in this special, Single User (SU)
case - with ISI but not MUI- we still could adopt (15), with

(I) or eq. (9) (II). In both ﬁgures, for the sake of comparisons,
we also include SIMO 1 × NR reference performances, for
both the multipath propagation channel - which implies a
Rayleigh fading concerning each TX/RX antenna pair - and an
ideal single-path propagation channel. For the linear detection
techniques, the semi-analytical methods of Section III have
been adopted; the complementary conventional Monte Carlo
simulation (involving error counting) results correspond to the
superposed circles in the solid lines.
Fig. 4 is dedicated to an ’SC/FDE vs OFDM’ comparison
of BER performances, for the strongly frequency-selective
fading channel case and the MMSE linear detection. In fact,
the ”OFDM results” shown here could have been obtained
by resorting to the SC/FDE simulation software, by replacing
the strongly frequency-selective fading by a frequency-ﬂat
fading. This is due to the following reasons: under frequency-
ﬂat fading, uncoded SC/FDE and OFDM provide identical
performances; uncoded OFDM performance does not depend
on the frequency-selectivity of the fading effects.
In all ﬁgures, where the SIMO detection performance
was analytically computed according to (22), an excellent
agreement of the semi-analytical simulation results with con-
ventional Monte Carlo simulation results can be observed.
In the simulation results concerning all subﬁgures of both
Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, the ﬁve BER performance curves have been
shown to be ordered, from the worst to the best, as follows:
NT × NR MU-MIMO with reduced-complexity (I) linear
detection; NT ×NR MU-MIMO with reduced-complexity (II)
linear detection; NT ×NR MU-MIMO with MMSE detection;
1 × NR (multipath case) SIMO detection; 1 × NR (single-
path case) SIMO detection. These ﬁgures clearly show that
the performance degradation which is inherent to the reduced-
complexity linear detection techniques (I and II) - as compared
with the optimum (MMSE) linear detection - can be made
quite small, by increasing NR signiﬁcantly; they also show
that, under highly increased NR values, the ”MUI-free” SIMO
(multipath) performance and the ultimate bound - the ”MUI-
free and ISI & fading-free” SIMO (single-path) performance -
can be closely approximated, even when adopting the reduced-
complexity (I) linear detection. These two ﬁgures emphasize
a ”massive MIMO” effect when NR ≫ 1, especially when
NR ≫ NT too, which leads to BER performances very

close to the ultimate ”MUI-free and ISI & fading-free” SIMO
(single-path) performance bound.
With regard to ’SC/FDE vs OFDM’ (uncoded) BER per-
formance comparisons, we can remember the signiﬁcant per-
formance advantage of SC/FDE when the Rayleigh fading is
frequency-selective and NR = 1 or 2 [2][3]. However, Fig. 4
clearly shows that - in spite of the strongly frequency-selective
fading considered here - the performance advantage of SC/FDE
practically vanishes when NR ≫ 1, even for a moderate NR
NT
(e.g., equal to 5).
Not surprisingly - having in mind the comparison depicted
in Fig. 4 - Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 of this paper are very similar,
respectively, to Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 of [10] (where the OFDM-
based MU-MIMO alternative is considered).
V.
CONCLUSIONS
This paper was dedicated to the uplink performance eval-
uation of a MU-MIMO system with SC/FDE transmission,
when adopting a large number of antennas and linear detection
techniques at the BS. The numerical performance results,
discussed in detail in Section IV, show the ”massive MIMO”
effects provided by a number of BS antennas much higher
than the number of antennas which are jointly employed in
the terminals of the multiple autonomous users, even when
reduced-complexity linear detection techniques are adopted.
The accuracy of performance results obtained by semi-
analytical means, much less time-consuming than conven-
tional, ’error counting’-based, Monte Carlo simulations -
was also demonstrated. The proposed performance evaluation
method can be very useful for rapidly knowing ”how many
antennas do we need in the BS?”, so that a ”massive MIMO”
effect can be achievable, for a given number of antennas jointly
employed in the user terminals.
The performance results of this paper also clearly show that
the SC/FDE detection performance, in a MU-MIMO context
with a large number of BS antennas, cannot be signiﬁcantly
better than that of OFDM: in fact, the SC/FDE performance
advantage practically vanishes when NR ≫ NT , even for a
strongly frequency-selective fading channel. Nevertheless, we
can say that SC/FDE is a better choice than OFDM for up-
link transmission, due to its well-known ”power ampliﬁcation
advantage” [2] and to the fact that it does not suffer from a
detection performance disadvantage.
