Abstract— More and more applications in the latest vehicle 
have higher Quality of Service (QoS) and more deterministic 
networking requirement for communication. This paper will 
analyze the challenge of latency requirements for In-vehicle-
network (IVN). The paper proposes an architecture to support 
that requirement based on New IP technology. The new 
architecture can provide the End-to-End (E2E) Latency 
Guaranteed Service (LGS) for IP flow level. It can be used for 
IVN and V2X communication for future Internet. The paper 
focuses on the design of new IVN control plane and data plane 
especially queuing and scheduling. The theoretical latency 
analysis, estimation and experimental verification are provided.

INTRODUCTION 
Recently, a trend in vehicle industry is that electrical or 
hybrid motors are replacing the combustion engine and power 
transmission. The major components of Electrical Vehicle 
(EV) are battery and electrical motors. They are simpler, more 
modular, and easier to be manufactured with standard and thus 
reduce the manufacturing threshold. This results in tougher 
competitions in other areas, such as Tele-driving, Self-driving, 
Infotainment System, etc. All those advanced futures are 
computing driven and require advanced networking 
technologies. There are two areas of networking for vehicle: 
1. In-Vehicle-Network (IVN): this is the network inside 
vehicle to connect different electronic devices, such as 
Sensors, Actuators, Electrical controller unit (ECU), 
GPS, Camera, Radar, LiDAR, Embedded computer, 
etc. 
2. Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X): This is a technology 
that allows moving vehicle to communicate with other 
moving vehicles, the traffic control system along 
roads, and communicate anything in Internet, such as 
Cloud, home, environment, people, etc.  
There are different types of applications within a car using 
IVN or V2X. Based on the requirements for network, traffic 
can be categorized as three types: 
1. The time sensitive: For this type of communication, 
the latency requirement is stringent, but the data 
amount is limited. This includes the communication 
for control data, such as the control for powertrain 
system, braking system, security system, etc. The data 
rate is up to Mbps per flow. 
2. The 
bandwidth 
sensitive: 
For 
this 
type 
of 
communication, the latency requirement is not 
stringent, but the data amount is higher. It includes 
GPS display, Radar, LiDAR data feeding. The data 
rate could be up to tens of Mbps per flow. 
3. Best-Effort: This is the traditional IP traffic that is not 
belonging to 1 and 2. Network will deliver the traffic 
to destination without any guarantee. 
The paper proposes to use New IP technology to realize IP 
based IVN. Section II introduces the New IP. Section III 
reviews the current technologies. Section IV, V and VI will 
discuss the architecture for introduction, control plane, and 
data plane respectively. Section VII addresses the latency 
analysis and estimation. Section VIII describes the network 
modeling and experiments. Section IX is about the 
conclusions.

NEW IP INTRODUCTION 
New IP is a broad technology set dedicated to solving 
requirements from future Internet, it is still in research stage. 
It was first proposed in ITU [1], and some research papers 
were published [2][3][4]. 
Compared with the existing IPv4 and IPv6, New IP has 
many forward-looking visions and will support some new 
features, such as Free Choice Addressing, Deterministic E2E 
IP service, it can provide the guaranteed service to satisfy the 
pre-negotiated Service Level Agreement (SLA). New IP can 
be used for IVN and V2X since both have very strict QoS 
requirements especially in latency, jitter, and packet loss that 
the current IP technology cannot meet. 
The paper [4] proposed key technologies to realize a E2E 
guaranteed service for Internet, details are as following: 
1. In-band signaling. This is a control mechanism to 
provide a scalable control protocol for flow level 
guaranteed service. Through in-band signaling, the 
QoS 
path 
setup, 
SLA 
negotiation, 
Resource 
Reservation, QoS forwarding state report and control 
are accomplished without running extra control 
protocol like RSVP [5] for IP, or Stream Reservation 
Protocol (SRP) [6] for TSN. 
2. Class based queuing and scheduling. It uses the 
concept of Class as defined in Differentiated Service 
(DiffServ) [7] to identify different types of traffic. 
Different class of traffic is queued into different queue 
for differentiated service. Priority Queuing (PQ) 
combined with Deficit Weighted Round Robin 
(DWRR) or any other Weighted Faired Queuing 
(WFQ) are used. Compared with other algorithms, this 
is the simplest to be implemented in high-speed 
hardware, and can achieve very satisfactory QoS in 
bandwidth, latency, jitter, and packet loss ratio. It also 
solves the scalability issue in Integrated Service 
(IntServ) [8] where the per-flow queueing was used.

3. New TCP/UDP transport stack. The current TCP/UDP 
transport protocol stack was designed based on the 
best-effort service from IP, new or enhanced protocols 
are expected to obtain the benefits if the network can 
provide guaranteed service while keep the backward 
compatibility. 
 
Above technologies set will have different way to use for 
IVN and V2X. For V2X, all technologies could be used, but 
for IVN, control methods (such as SDN controller) other than 
In-band signaling can also be used.  
 
It must be noted that the current V2X technologies in 
3GPP or academy research are majorly in wireless or 
spectrum. They are insufficient to solve E2E latency issue in 
Internet since there are many fixed line networks involved for 
E2E communication. Only after combining New IP with V2X 
wireless technologies, we can provide the complete solutions 
for deterministic service. Figure 1 illustrates New IP enabled 
IVN architecture in future Internet where both 5G and Internet 
also need New IP enabled, with such architecture, the true E2E 
deterministic service can be realized. 
 
 
Figure 1.  New IP enabled IVN architecture in future Internet  
 
Due to the space limit, the paper will only focus on the 
queuing and scheduling technology used in IVN to 
demonstrate and prove that the New IP can provide the 
satisfactory deterministic service for new IVN. The use of 
New IP in 5G and other areas will be discussed in the future. 
III. 
REVIEW OF CURRENT TECHNOLOGIES 
The section will brief the networking protocols used in 
current IVN and analyze the latency requirement for IVN. 
A. Network technologies in current IVN 
 
The traditional IVN uses the legacy protocols, such as 
Local Interconnect Network (LIN) [9], Controller Area 
Network (CAN) [10], FlexRay [11]. These are specifically L2 
technologies, they use the special designed physical media, 
signaling to manage strictly and timely for data to satisfy the 
requirements for communications inside car. 
 
When more and more IP based applications come to IVN, 
the disadvantage of above legacy protocols is obvious. Its cost 
is normally higher than the TCP/IP plus Ethernet based 
network, IP based application must re-write the interface with 
new underlayer network if it is not Ethernet. AutoSAR [12] 
has proposed all IP based interface for IVN, and IP based IVN 
was proposed in [13][14].  
 
However, without special technology, traditional TCP/IP 
and Ethernet cannot satisfy the requirement of IVN in terms 
of QoS. That is why IEEE TSN [15] was proposed for IVN 
[16].  
B. Requirement for IVN 
 
The most important requirement in terms of QoS for IVN 
is the communication latency, jitter, and packet loss ratio.  
 
The latency is crucial to the safety of vehicle and will 
determine if a new technology can be used in IVN. So far, 
there is no industry standard or requirement for the latency for 
IVN. Below are some existing publications about the topic: 
• From the perspective of fastest human reaction time, the 
IVN latency must not be slower than that. It is said the 
fastest human reaction time is 250ms [17]. Some papers 
gave lower values but not shorter than 100ms if human 
brain is needed to process the input signal. 
• The paper [16] mentioned the latency for control data must 
be less than 10ms. The paper [13] and [18] said the latency 
for control data must be less than 2.5ms. 
 
Based on all available analysis, it is safe to assume that the 
qualified IVN must support the E2E latency not bigger than 
2.5ms. 
 
There is no requirement for the jitter from current research. 
Theatrically, jitter can be removed by buffering technology 
when the maximum latency is within the target. 
The zero-packet-loss is expected for control data. In a 
packet network (Ethernet or IP), the packet loss is normally 
caused by two factors: (1) the congestion in network (2) 
physical failure, such as link, node, hardware. The 1st factor 
has much more probability and higher packet loss ratio than 
the 2nd factor. Thus, it must be eliminated for control data in 
New IP based IVN. The 2nd factor can be mitigated and 
eliminated by sending the same data to two or multiple 
disjoined paths to reach the same destination, and/or, sending 
the same data more than one time as long as the time period 
is chosen below the upper bound of the latency. 
IV. 
THE ARCHITECTURE - INTRODUCTION 
 
The new architecture of IVN is based on New IP 
technologies and consists of Control plane and Data Plane. 
This section will discuss some basics for architecture.  
A. Topologies 
 
The topologies of new IVN can be any type, but to reduce 
the complexity and to provide a redundant protection, the 
paper proposes to use two topologies, one is the Spine-Leaf 
topology, and another is Ring topology, as shown in Figure 2 
and 3.

Figure 3.  The Ring IVN Topology  
 
In the topologies shown in Figure 2 and 3, there are always 
two disjointed physical paths between any network devices. 
Also, the Ethernet Bus is supported. The advantages of such 
design are: 
• The protection of physical link. Any failure of any link 
does not completely stop the communication. 
• The higher reliability for zero packet loss. Multiple paths 
can be used to transport critical packet to compensate 
possible packet loss due to temporary failure or fault in 
physical transmission media. 
• Ethernet Bus can make the plug-and-play possible for 
most of sensors, ECU, computers, etc.  
B. Network Device and Link 
 
The network device can be either IP Router or Ethernet 
Switch, IP router is more powerful to provide more features in 
networking, such as more flexibility in routing and network 
state changes, higher link utilization, secured communication, 
etc. 
 
When Ethernet Switch is selected, DPI (Deep Packet 
Inspection) should be configured to check the IP level 
information (address, port, protocol, DSCP values) for 
admission control for IP flows.  
 
The Physical Link and protocol can be any type of Layer 
2 link, Normal Ethernet or IEEE802.1 with the speed higher 
than 100 Mbps is minimum, and 1G ~10G is better to achieve 
a shorter latency. There is no need to select any special 
IEEE802.1Q serials, such as TSN. This is one of the 
advantages of the new architecture compared with TSN. 
C. New Service 
 
The new service provided by New IP based IVN is “E2E 
and flow level guaranteed service for bandwidth, latency, jitter 
and packet loss”. Following is detail about the new service: 
• The E2E is defined as “From Application(s) of one end-
user device to other Application(s) of another end-user 
device. For IVN, the end-user device is any device 
connected to IVN that supports TCP/IP protocols, and 
application is running on top of TCP/IP, such as TCP/IP 
capable ECU, Embedded computer, Infotainment system, 
Mobile device, etc. 
• The Flow can be any granularity, for example, it can be an 
IP flow defined by 5 tuples (source/destination address, 
source/destination port number, protocol), or a group of 
flows defined by less tuples, such as source/destination 
address. 
• The Guaranteed service means that the service provided 
by system will go through some crucial steps like Service 
Level Agreement (SLA) negotiation or provisioning, 
admission 
control 
and 
user 
traffic 
conformity 
enforcement, etc. After all procedures are accomplished, 
the promised service will meet the negotiated bandwidth, 
latency, jitter, and packet loss defined in SLA. 
• Different application may need different guaranteed 
service. For example, critical sensor and control data may 
need the guaranteed service for both bandwidth and 
latency. The new service is like the service for Scheduled 
traffic and Real-time traffic defined in FlexRay [11]. For 
these types of traffic, the strictest service is needed to 
achieve the minimum latency, jitter, and packet loss ratio. 
almost all other type of data does not need any guaranteed 
service, the best-effort service is good enough. For any 
application, weather it needs the new service is case by 
case and up to the application’s requirement from the 
networking. 
V. 
ARCHTECTURE- CONTROL PLANE 
This section discusses the aspects of control plane for new 
IVN architecture including the Control Plane Candidates, and 
Control Plane Functions. 
A. Control Plane Candidates 
The control plane could have the following candidates: 
• Central controller: such as SDN controller or network 
management controller. For IVN, it is normally a 
controller’s responsibility to provision some basic 
function for IVN, such as address assignment, routing 
protocol configuration (for dynamic routing) and static 
routing table installation (for fast and simple system boot 
up). Central controller can also be used for the static 
provisioning for the guaranteed service, such as scheduled 
and real-time traffic configuration on ECUs,  
• In-band signaling protocol [4] is an alternative control 
method distributed to all network nodes. It can be used for 
connections between IVN and cloud for critical data in 
V2X scenario, it can also be used in IVN for dynamic 
service state report, network state OAM and network 
problem diagnosis. In-band signaling is not mandatory for 
communication within IVN. 
B. Control Plane Functions 
 
In addition to the static provisioning from a central 
controller described in A, another key function for the 
control plane to achieve the guaranteed service support is 
the Admission Control. All flows requesting new service, 
except the Best Effort, must obtain the approve for the 
admission from central controller or from in-band 
signaling process. This includes three steps: 
• An application requesting new service specifies the 
expectation of service type (BGS, LGS), the traffic pattern 
(rate specification) and expected End-to-End latency. 
• System (Central controller or the network device) will 
process the request and try to reserve the resource for the 
flow, and notify the application about the CIR (Committed 
Information Rate), PIR (Peak Information Rate), bounded 
end-to-end latency and jitter values, packet loss ratio, etc.

• The application agreed the offered service will send traffic 
according to the system notification, i.e., send traffic no 
more than CIR, and monitor the notification from network 
to adjust the traffic pattern accordingly. 
VI. 
ARCHITECTURE - DATA PLANE 
This section discusses the aspects of data plane for new 
IVN architecture including the Protocol Selection, Queuing 
and Scheduling Algorithm, Traffic shaping, Latency 
estimation. 
A. Protocol Selection 
As new IVN is IP based, IPv4 is proposed to be the basic 
protocol for New IP, a protocol extension is needed if in-band 
signaling is used [19]. All data process, such as forwarding, 
traffic classification, traffic shaping, queuing, and scheduling, 
are for IPv4 data. It is noted that New IP’s “Free address 
choice” feature can provide address shorter than IPv4 that can 
benefit the latency, but it is not discussed here. 
B. Traffic Classification 
 
This paper will propose to classify all IVN traffic as Four 
types. Both Scheduled Traffic (ST) and Real-Time Traffic 
(RT) are treated as Latency Guaranteed Service (LGS) as 
described in [4], and other type of traffic that only needs the 
bandwidth guarantee is treated as Bandwidth Guaranteed 
Service (BGS):  
1. Scheduled traffic (ST). This type of traffic has fixed 
data size, exact time of when the data is starting and 
what is the interval of the data. Normally, all sensor 
data report and control data belong to this type. 
Typically, IVN can configure the polling mechanism 
for all sensors to make use of this type of traffic. The 
service associated with this type of traffic will get 
LGS. This type of traffic is classified as EF class in 
DSCP value defined in DiffServ. 
2. Real-Time Traffic (RT). This type of traffic has fixed 
data size, but the time of the data starting, and the data 
rate is unknow. Normally, all urgent sensor data report 
and control data belong to this type. IVN can configure 
the critical sensors to send data to controller in the 
situation of emergency and the polling mechanism did 
not catch the latest data changes. The service 
associated with this type of traffic is also LGS. But the 
latency and jitter might be a little bigger than for the 
ST depending on the algorithm and burst of RT. This 
type of traffic is classified as AF41 class in DSCP 
value. 
3. Bandwidth Guaranteed Traffic. This type of traffic has 
special requirement from the network bandwidth, but 
not the latency, jitter, and packer loss ratio. Normally, 
the IVN software update from cloud, diagnosis data 
uploading to cloud, on-line gaming and streaming for 
infotainment system, etc., belong to this type. It can be 
classified as any AFxy class (other than EF and AF41) 
in DSCP value. 
4. Best-Effort Traffic. This is a default class of traffic, all 
applications that do not require any special treatment 
from network perspective can be classified as this type 
of traffic, Best Effort Class is used. 
C. Queuing and Scheduling Algorithm 
 
The paper proposes two types of algorithms illustrated in 
the Figure 4 and 5. One is for asynchronous environment that 
there is no clock sync for network. Another is synchronous 
environment that clock is synced with certain accuracy for 
network including all devices. Below are details, also, the 
experiment section is based on the two algorithms discussed 
here. 
 
 
Figure 4.  1st Algorithm: Asynchrous Solution 
 
Figure 5.  2nd Algorithm: Synchrous Solution 
• For asynchronous environment, Priority Queuing (PQ) 
combined with Deficit Weighted Round Robin (DWRR) 
or any type of Weighted Faired Queuing (WFQ) are used. 
It is called the 1st Algorithm in the document thereafter. 
Normally, the time sensitive flows, i.e., scheduled traffic 
(EF class) and real-time traffic (AF41 class) are put into 
the 1st and 2nd priority of the queue, and other classes of 
traffic, BGS and Best Effort class of traffic, are put into 
the lower priority queues. For admission control and 
scheduler configuration, the total CIR for LGS class, and 
the WEIGHT values of BGS class can be calculated from 
the sum of CIR of all flows in the same class. This 
algorithm has already deeply analyzed in [4]. 
• For synchronous environment, above asynchronous 
PQ+DWRR algorithm is combined with Cyclic Queuing 
(CQ). It is called the 2nd Algorithm in the document 
thereafter. Each class of traffic has a dedicated time 
window to be served by the scheduler. The service time is 
associated with the sum of CIR of all flows in the same 
service. The Scheduler will calculate and adjust the 
serving time window for each class when a flow’s state is

changed, such as new flow is added, or old flow is 
removed.  
D. Traffic Shaping 
 
Traffic shaping is used to absorb the overflow and burst of 
the traffic in the class and its objectives are: (1) the packet in 
the class is never built up, thus reducing the latency (2) traffic 
in lower priority class is never starved by higher priority 
traffic. Existing Single Rate Three Color Marker [20] or Two 
Rate Three Color Marker [21] could be used for traffic 
shaping. Other type shaping like leaky bucket shaping can also 
be used. Traffic shaping deployment is very flexible. It can be 
configured in both ingress and egress interface. It can be per 
flow based, or per class based. 
 
Flow-level traffic shaping in ingress interface can also be 
used as the policy enforcement module, it will check the user’s 
traffic to see if it is allowed to pass or trigger some policy, 
such as discard or put into lower priority to process. 
VII. LATENCY ANALYSIS AND ESTIMATION 
To provide the Latency Guaranteed Service (LGS) for ST 
and RT, the network must be able to estimate the latency for 
a network path and offer to user in the provisioning stage. 
This is the requirement for SLA negotiation. This section will 
analyze all factors that can result in network latency and 
discuss some basic formulas. 
A. The Latency Analysis for IP Network 
 
In this paper, the latency estimation is for E2E from the 
perspective of user’s application. The latency must include all 
delay occurred in network and hosts. This is illustrated in the 
Figure 6. The formula for the latency is as in (1) and (2). The 
superscript “LGS” denotes LGS packet.

B. Estimation for the Queuing Latency (QD) 
The formulas for the queueing latency estimation (for the 
same packet size) have been derived in [4] for the 1st 
Algorithm. In this paper, different packet size for two class is 
used, thus formulas are different as in [4]. The maximum 
number of packet and queuing time for a queue (EF or AF4x) 
under the worst scenario for a hop are shown in equations 
from (3) to (8).

For the 2nd Algorithm, the packet in any queue is served 
on a pre-allocated time window, and this will guarantee that 
flows will not be interfered by any packets in other queues. So, 
it is easy to estimate that the maximum number of packets in 
a queue is as in (9), (10). The associated queuing time is the 
same as in (4) and (6). However, for the worst scenario when 
a packet is out of the allocated window for some reason, the 
maximum latency will be as the (11).

VIII. NETWORK MODELING AND EXPERIMENTS 
To verify and analyze the New IP based IVN architecture 
can meet the requirements of IVN, OMNeT++ [22] is used to 
simulate the network, the detailed bandwidth, E2E latency, 
pack loss, etc., can be retrieved from tests. 
A. Network Topology 
The network is illustrated in the Figure 7. It is a ring 
topology but with the cut of another ring link to focus on the 
latency simulation under the worst scenario (longer latency). 
All links speed is 100 Mbps. The network consists of ECU, 
computers, and routers. ECU is to simulate the sensors with 
control connected on Ethernet Bus. it has a full TCP/IP stack 
and responsible for the ST and RT generation and process. 
The ST and RT are simulated by UDP packets. Computers are 
simulating the generation and process of Best-Effort traffic 
(TCP and UDP) that is used to interfere ST and RT between 
ECUs. 
 
 
Figure 7.  Network Topology and traffic 
 
The purpose of simulation is to illustrate the new 
architecture can provide the E2E guaranteed service for ST 
and RT when the network is severely congested and interfered 
by the Best-Effort traffic. The E2E guaranteed service 
includes three criteria: (1) bounded latency (2) bounded jitter 
(3) congestion free and lossless. Moreover, the tested latency 
and jitter for ST and RT should be close to the estimated 
latency described in the section VII. 
B. Network Devices 
 
Each router consists of Ingress Modules, Switch Fabric 
and Egress Modules that are illustrated in the Figure 8. The 
Ingress Modules simulate the traffic classification and ingress 
traffic shaping functions; The Egress Modules simulate the 
egress traffic shaping, queuing, and scheduling functions. The 
Switch Fabric Modules simulate the IP lookup, switching and 
L2 re-writing functions. Two types of schedulers are used.  
Only class level traffic shaping is used for ST for ingess and 
egress.

C. Traffic Configuration 
 
To simulate the worst scenario, very heavy traffic for the 
IVN simulation is configured as below: 
• 
There is total 100 ST flows and 100 RT flows using 
UDP, each flow has the packet size 254 bytes (200 
bytes data, 54 bytes of UDP and Ethernet header), 
the send interval is 10ms. So, each flow has a rate of 
203.2 Kbps. Both rate for ST flows and RT flows are 
20.32Mbps, it means the remained bandwidth for 
BGS, and BE is about 60Mbps. 
• 
50 ST flows and 50 RT flows are from ECU H01 and 
H02 to H31 and H32, these flows’ results are 
checked and compared with the estimation. 50 ST 
flows and 50 RT flows are from ECU H11 and H12 
to H21, H22.  
• 
There is total 250 interference flows configured 
between other computers. The interference flows 
will cause all links between routers congested, R1 
link Eth[0] is the most severely congested router and 
link. All flows packet size are 200 bytes or 1500 
bytes. Both TCP and UDP are configured for 
interference flows. 
D. Cyclic Queueing and Scheduler Configuration 
 
For the 2nd algorithm, the detail of the cyclic queuing is 
configured as in Figure 9. 
 
 
Figure 9.  The Cyclic Queueing Configuration 
o The cycle T for all router and hosts are 10ms. 
o A guard band of 1500 bytes or 120 us are configured for 
both AF41 and BE classes. This is to protect the higher 
priority packets (EF and AF4x) are not interfered by lower 
priority packet.

o The time window size for EF and AF41 are 22% and 32% 
of the cycle T respectively. 
E. Experiment Results and Analysis 
 
The Table 1 shows the detailed calculation for the E2E 
latency estimation. First, estimate the maximum number of 
packets in each egress link of all routers on the path, then 
calculate the maximum queuing delay. The minimum E2E 
latency means there is no queueing latency in each hop, so it 
is determined by the sum of all link segment’s serialization 
latency on the path. Each 100M link will have 20.3 us 
serialization latency for 254 bytes ST or RT traffic. The burst 
coefficient for each case is also shown in the Table. Higher 
coefficients for router R0 and R1 are selected since there are 
aggregation of the traffic for the routers. For other routers, the 
coefficient is selected as 1, or no burst effect. 
TABLE 1. THE E2E DELAY ESTIMATION OF ST AND 
RT FLOWS 
 
 
Table 2 shows the Min/Max E2E Delay for the worst 
performed flow, and estimation values also compared. The 
worst performed flow is defined as that the flow’s Max E2E 
delay is the biggest in all flows in the same class. 
Jitter is not shown in the table, but it can be easily 
calculated by the variation of mean and Min/Max value, the 
mean value can be simply calculated by the average of 
Min/Max values.

To demonstrate the lossless and congestion-free for ST 
and RT flows, Figure 14 shows the statistics of all queues in 
R1 for two algorithms. No packet dropped in EF and AF4x 
queues while there are packets dropped in BE queue. This is 
as expected, congestion should only happen for BE traffic, ST 
and RT flows are not impacted and are lossless and 
congestion-free. R1 is the most severely congested, other 
Router’s queues also have similar pattern. No packet drops for 
EF and AF4x. 
 
 
Figure 14.  The statistics for all Queues for two algorithms 
Here is a summary from the test results: 
• The queuing latency of higher priority queues by PQ is 
very short and is not impacted by the congestion of lower 
priority class of traffic. E2E Maximum latency estimation 
in the section VII can cover almost all traffic’s real 
maximum latency. 
• Lossless and congestion free can be achieved for ST and 
RT flows if the admission control is done for the flows. 
• The E2E latency shown in the experiment does not include 
“Other Delay” and “Propagation Delay” described in 
section VII. “Propagation Delay” is very trivial in IVN, 
but “Other Delay” should be considered and added up if 
they are significant compared with the final queueing 
latency. For most of forwarding chip, “Other Delay” is 
very small and below hundred microseconds, but for x86 
based virtual router, it might not be true depending on the 
forwarding software design. 
• The latency per hop is inversely proportional to the link 
speed. For example, the experiment using 100M link with 
4 hops network can achieve hundreds microsecond for 
E2E latency.  It is expected that the corresponding latency 
for the same network is about tens of microsecond and 
couple microseconds for 1G and 10G link, respectively. 
Higher link rate will not only reduce latency, but also 
provide 
more 
bandwidth 
for 
non-time-sensitive 
applications. So, the paper proposes to use at least 1G link 
for the IVN in the future. 
IX. 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
Classed based queueing and scheduling plus traffic 
shaping can provide per-hop guaranteed LGS and BGS. 
Combined with Central Controller or In-band Signaling, the 
E2E guaranteed service for IP network can be achieved by 
enforcing the per-hop guaranteed service on all network 
devices on the IP forwarding path. The solution is backward 
compatible as the existing IP traffic can coexist with the new 
classes of traffic. 
 
If the accurate clock can be provided, the synchronous 
solution by using CQ could improve the latency and jitter 
significantly. But it must be noted that costs of synchronous 
solution are not trivial, following tasks are mandatory: 
• The crucial requirement of using CQ is the clock sync in 
the IVN, this is a different topic, and the paper does not 
address it. Basically, a central controller or distributed 
protocol, such as IEEE1588 can be used to sync all device 
clock with a certain accuracy. 
• Cycle value selection. The cycle value and the clock 
accuracy requirement depend on each other, both will 
determine the granularity of the served packet size, the link 
utilization, the maximum latency, and the cost of the 
scheduler design. 
• Time window allocation for different flows with different 
constraints in bandwidth and latency. The optimized 
solution needs complicated math and cause an overhead 
for the solution. 
As a summary, the New IP based IVN can satisfy very 
well the requirements for the communications of different 
applications. It opens the door for future IVN and V2X. 
Further research is still needed in the following areas: 
• TCP congestion control: The congestion control for 
different service is expected to be different. New 
algorithms are critical for application to effectively utilize 
the new guaranteed service provided by network. 
• New TCP and UDP stack for IVN: More efficient and 
faster protocol stack are needed to improve the control of 
new service and reduce the latency happened on host 
protocol and interface. 
• Algorithm for network resource planning and allocation 
for synchronous solution, such as optimized cycle number, 
fast and efficient time slot allocation, scheduler 
management, etc.
