INTRODUCTION
The significant growth of the Internet based applications
and services contributed to a steep rise in data storage and
processing requirements. Cloud Computing (CC) is a
powerful solution in this context, by integrating the
advancements in computing and network technologies. The
Cloud Computing paradigm is mainly based on the data
centers
which
are
capable
of
handling
storage
and
processing of large amount of data. The data centers can be
interconnected over optical networks to form data center
networks (DCNs), seen by the end user as a unique powerful
resource.
Internet of Things (IoT), mobile applications and
services, smart cities applications, etc., recently emerging,
pose
novel
challenging
requirements
the
CC
based
solutions. Cloud computing centralization (in terms of
processing and storage) in traditional data centers have
inherent limitations, being non-appropriate for the above
mentioned specific classes of applications. The IoT, mobile
applications, vehicular networks et al., require real or near
real-time response/latency, high bandwidth, location and
context awareness, reduction in amount of data transferred
to CC and back, more flexibility in functional distribution,
resource usage optimization and others.
One solution for the above problems is Edge-oriented
computing (EC) [1][2], where the main idea is to create
additional CC capabilities at the network edge, close to, or
even installed in the “terminal” data sources (e.g., vehicles).
EC is not seen as a replacement of the CC but it is
complementary to it. The CC and EC can be used
independently or in cooperation. Several proposals currently
exist for EC, like: Fog Computing (FC), Multi-access
(Mobile) Edge Computing, Cloudlets, etc.
A current open research issue is to investigate if any
convergence could be established in terms of concepts,
architecture and implementation of such solutions.
Edge computing is of high interest not only in research
communities; there are several entities involved and active
in
EC,
in
industry,
research
and
standardization
organizations. Different sets of specifications have been
elaborated by independent entities.
Fog Computing (FC) is a term coined by CISCO (2012)
[3][4] primarily to serve IoT needs.
Later,
the
OpenFog
Consortium
organization
(November 2015) [5][6] has been created,
having as
founders: Cisco, ARM, Dell, Intel, Microsoft, Princeton
University
Edge Laboratory and comprises more than 60
members today. They defined an FC and Open Reference
Architecture [5] and are creating standards to enable
interoperability in IoT, 5G, artificial intelligence, tactile
Internet, Virtual Reality (VR) and other complex data and
network intensive applications.
The
European
Telecommunications
Standardization
Institute (ETSI) established in 2014 the Mobile Edge
Computing Industry Specification Group [7][8]; in March
2017, the name has been re-defined as: Multi-access Edge
Computing ISG [9]
to include also non-cellular operators
requirements. Cooperation started recently between Open
Fog Consortium and ETSI MEC ISG to give the industry a
cohesive set of standards around Fog Computing in mobile
environments, while eliminating redundancy.
Another entity is Edge Computing Consortium (Dec.
2016) was formed, having as initial founders Huawei, Intel,
ARM, and now comprising several members. The US
National Institute for Science and Technology (NIST)
elaborated a definition of FC (draft closed in September
2017) [10]. Also IETF recently started to contribute to the
development of these technologies.
At Carnegie Mellon University, they developed the
Cloudlet [11][12]; a cloudlet is middle tier of a 3-tier
hierarchy: “mobile device – cloudlet – cloud”. It can be seen
as a "data center in a box" whose goal is to "bring the cloud

closer" to the data sources. Cloudlets are mobility-enhanced
micro data centers located at the edge of a network and
serve the mobile or smart device portion of the network.
They are designed to handle resource-intensive mobile
applications and take the load off both the network and the
centralized data center and keep computing close to the
point of origin of information.
Microsoft Research proposed in 2015 [13] the Micro
data center, as an extension of today’s hyperscale cloud
data centers (e.g., Microsoft’s Azure). The goal is to meet
new requirements, e.g., lower latency and new demands
related to devices (e.g., lower battery consumption).
The EC can generally represent any set of computing
and network resources along the path between data sources
and cloud data centers. However, there is not yet a unique
vision on “edge” semantics, except the common attribute of
proximity of the EC capabilities to the data sources. An
important
overlap
exists
between
particular
EC
architectures; so, convergence is predicted in the near
future.
The EC deployment can be strongly helped by novel
software technologies. In the architectural management and
control planes, Software-defined networking (SDN) [14] and
Network Function Virtualization (NFV) [15][16] are seen as
a strong support, given their features like flexibility,
programmability, abstraction via virtualization, dynamicity,
etc.
This
paper
is
organized
as
follows.
Section
II
summarizes the use cases and applications for which Edge
computing is an attractive technology. Section III is a short
overview of Edge computing architectures. Section IV
identifies some common characteristics in different EC
approaches, while emphasizing some points of convergence.
Section VI contains conclusions and possible future work.

EDGE COMPUTING BASED APPLICATIONS AND USE
CASES
This section gives examples of domains where EC (Fog,
MEC, Cloudlets, etc.) could be effective to support the
applications [1-4][7][9][12][17-19]. There is a need of open
architectures based on EC, to enable interoperability in
various domain of applications like in IoT, Artificial
Intelligence, novel generation of networking 5G, tactile
Internet, vehicular networks and Internet of Vehicles (IoV),
smart cities applications, services virtual reality, and other
complex
data
and
network
intensive
applications.
In
particular, IoT applications generate high amounts of data
that can be useful in many ways. Therefore, EC nodes can
be used to carry out data mining and data analysis on a large
volume of multi-modal and heterogeneous data from various
sensor devices and other IoT devices to achieve real time
and fast processing for decision making.
The Fog architecture can be hierarchically organized.
This can be useful big data analysis in smart cities.
Experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of the
system's city-wide implementation in future smart cities
scenario. Fog computing can support new services for
mobile networks requiring high data rates and low latency
( e.g., virtual reality).
Internet of vehicles [18] may benefit from EC (e.g., Fog,
MEC) capabilities to develop a large range of applications
like: safety and management-oriented (traffic safety, traffic
and navigation management, remote telematics); business-
oriented (infotainment, insurance car sharing, etc.). The
vehicle itself can be equipped as to become a fog node, to
attain optimum utilization and benefit from vehicular
communications and computational resources. The mobile
fog nodes can inter-communicate and provide services
including infotainment, advanced driver assistance systems,
autonomous driving, collision avoidance, and navigation.
Other area of applications is oriented to emergency,
health care services. The latency-sensitive and security-
privacy-sensitive services also can benefit from fog/edge
nodes capabilities. Experimental results validated that EC
supporting cyber-physical systems can improve the cost
efficiency significantly based on by jointly considering base
station association, task distribution.
MEC technology is a particular EC case where the MEC
resources (i.e., MEC servers) are placed at the network edge
(e.g., in Radio Access Network (RAN), i.e., Base Stations, or
in aggregation points, etc.). It offers low latency, proximity,
high bandwidth, and real-time insight into radio network
information and location awareness. Therefore MEC can
support many applications and services for multiple sectors,
(enterprise, consumer, health, vehicular, etc.) [7].
In RAN-aware Content Optimization, an application
running in the MEC server, can expose accurate cell and
subscriber radio interface information (cell load, link
quality) to a content optimizer, enabling dynamic content
optimization,
improving
Quality
of Experience
(QoE)
perceived by the
users and improve network efficiency.
Dynamic content optimization enhances video delivery
through reduced stalling, reduced time-to-start and ‘best’
video quality. Among smart cities applications, a video
streaming service can benefit from MEC approach. Video
streams from monitoring devices can be locally processed
and analyzed at the MEC server to extract meaningful data
from video streams. The valuable data can be transmitted to
the application server to reduce core network traffic. Other
mobile application where MEC could be a subsystem is
Augmented Reality (AR); this requires low latency and a
high rate of data processing in order to provide the correct
information
depending
on
the
location
of
the
user.
Collaboration is required for data collection in the uplink,
computing at the edge, and data delivery in the downlink.
The data are actually processed in a local MEC server rather
to improve the user experience.
MEC is also useful in IoT, given that IoT devices often
have low capabilities (processing, storage capacity). There
is a need to aggregate various IoT messages connected
through the mobile network close to the devices. Gateways
(collocated with MEC servers) aggregate the messages and
ensure security and low latency. To achieve an efficient
service, grouping of sensors and devices is accomplished.

EDGE COMPUTING ARCHITECTURES
A summary of some EC relevant architectures is
presented in this section. Note that this paper investigates a
possible
convergence
between
EC
architectures
and
technologies. In this respect, is to be noted that, currently,
there is no unique vision neither on the terminology, nor on
architectural definition for EC.
We selected and give below a summary of the Fog
computing and Mobile Edge Computing and architectures,
which seem to be of strong interest for industry, operators,
and standardization organizations.
Fog computing (FC) is an important EC technology
complementary
to
CC
(i.e.,
cooperation
CC/FC
is
envisaged). The FC distributed platform brings computation
close to its data sources, to reduce the latency and cost of
delivering data to a remote cloud. FC has been proposed
originally to support the IoT, introduced by Cisco (Bonomi
[3]]).
The OpenFog Consortium (2015) [5] defines FC as a
system-level
horizontal
architecture
that
distributes
resources and services of computing, storage, control and
networking anywhere along the continuum from a cloud
data center down to things. Therefore, FC extends the
traditional CC model;
implementations of the architecture
can reside in multiple layers of a network’s topology. The
CC
benefits
are
extended
to
FC
(containerization,
virtualization, orchestration, manageability, and efficiency)
and
FC
can
cooperate with
CC.
OpenFog
reference
architecture
includes
security,
scalability,
openness,
autonomy, RAS (reliability, availability and serviceability),
agility, hierarchy, and programmability. The FC focuses the
processing efforts outside the cloud data center, i.e., in the
fog area. Data are gathered, processed, and stored within the
network, by way of an IoT gateway (GW) or a FC node
(FN). Information is transmitted to this GW from various
sources and it is processed in FN; then, relevant data (plus
additional command - if necessary), are transmitted back,
towards the devices. A FN can process data received from
multiple end-points and send information exactly where it is
needed.
Note that OpenFog Consortium sees the EC differently
from FC, in the sense that FC works with the cloud, whereas
EC is defined by the exclusion of cloud. FC is hierarchical,
where EC tends to be limited to a small number of layers. In
addition to computation, FC also addresses networking,
storage, control and acceleration.
This vision is not agreed by all documents related to
Edge- oriented computing.
On the other part, MEC, originally targets only the very
edge part of the network (e.g., RAN). FC can support
multiple
industry
verticals
and
application
domains
delivering intelligence and services to users and business.
FC capability is spanning across multiple protocol layers
and is not dependent on specific access systems.
OpenFog Consortium defined a flexible deployment
hierarchical model for FC, IoT-oriented [5]. The model is
mapped on a layered architecture consisting of the following
layers:
1.
Sensors
and
actuators
(bottom
layer);
2.
Monitoring and control;
3. Operational support; 4.
Business support; 5. Enterprise systems (highest layer).
The flexibility of the model consists in the fact that,
depending on the nature and requirements of the target
application class and, depending on the CC availability,
cost, etc., a cooperating (for a combination CC/FC) vertical
chain can be defined for layers, 2, 3, 4, e.g.:
L2.FC, L3.FC, L4.FC, or
L2.FC, L3.FC, L4.CC, or
L2.FC, L3.CC, L4.CC, or
L2.CC, L3.CC, L4.CC.
Fog
computing
targets
quite
a
large
range
of
applications. Therefore, no unique “universal” architecture
exists. In terms of Fog architecture, many studies split this
problem in two classes (for detailed discussion, see the
survey by Mouradian, et. al. [20]):
End-User
Application
agnostic
architectures
(comprising End-User Application provisioning, Resource
management,
Communication
functions,
Cloud
and
federation). This class envisages some general aspects, not
specific to a given application.
Application specific architectures (Smart living and
Smart Cities, Connected vehicles and IoV, Healthcare and
other applications).
In [20], also some criteria for evaluation of the
architectures are proposed:
Heterogeneity (C1): it should be considered when
deciding
which
application
component(s)
should
be
deployed and where;
QoS Management (C2): there are necessary architectural
modules for QoS management (e.g., to assure latency) such
as migration engine;
Scalability
(C3):
modules
are
needed
to
assure
horizontal scalability (e.g., elasticity engine);
Mobility (C4): a mobility engine is necessary to ensure
the continuity of a service for the end-user;
Federation
(C5):
cooperation
is
needed
between
different
providers
in
order
to
ensure
the
proper
coordination
of
the
necessary
interactions
between
application components;
Interoperability (C6): there is a need for appropriate
signaling and control interfaces, and appropriate data
interfaces to enable interoperability.
In [4], a general hierarchical FC-CC layered architecture
is defined (application agnostic). Note that this architecture
includes also the CC. Three macro-layers are defined.
Terminal layer is closest to the end user and physical
environment. It consists of IoT devices (e.g., sensors,
mobile phones, smart vehicles, smart cards, readers, and so
on) widely geographically distributed. Note that some
devices like mobile phones and smart vehicles having
sufficient computing power, can be included in the next Fog
layer. They are responsible for sensing the feature data of
physical objects or events and transmitting these sensed data
to upper layer for processing and storage.

Fog layer is located outside the CC (i.e., in the network)
and it is composed of a large number of fog nodes (FN)
(routers, gateways, switchers, access points, base stations,
specific fog servers, etc.). The FNs can be static, or mobile
on a moving carrier and are widely distributed between the
end devices and cloud (e.g., cafes, shopping centers, bus
terminals, streets, parks, etc.) The end devices can connect
with FNs to obtain services. The FNs can compute, transmit
and temporarily store the received sensed data. The Fog
layer can perform real-time analysis and latency sensitive
applications. The FNs are also connected with CC data
center by IP core network, and responsible for interaction
and cooperation with cloud to obtain more powerful
computing and storage capabilities.
Cloud layer includes multiple high performance servers
and storage devices, to support for extensive computation
analysis and permanently storage of a huge amount of data.
It provides various application services, such as smart home,
smart transportation, smart factory, etc. However, different
from traditional CC architecture, not all computing and
storage tasks go through the cloud. According to the
demand-load,
the
cloud
core
modules
are
efficiently
managed and scheduled by some control strategies to
improve utilization of the cloud resources.
In [21], a six-layer FC
architecture is presented,
comprising the layers described below.
Physical and virtualization layer involves different types
of
nodes
(physical,
virtual
nodes
and
virtual
sensor
networks) distributed
geographically. These nodes are
managed and maintained according to their types and
service demands. The sensors are sensing the surroundings
and send the collected data to upper layers via gateways for
further processing and filtering.
Monitoring layer supervises the resource utilization,
availability of sensors, FNs and network elements. All tasks
performed by nodes are monitored in this layer (which node,
which task, at what time, what is its output, etc.).
Pre-processing layer performs data management tasks.
Collected data are analyzed filtered and trimmed, in order to
extract meaningful information. The pre-processed data are
then stored temporarily in the temporary storage layer.
Security layer performs the encryption/decryption of
data. Additionally, integrity measures may be applied to the
data to protect them from tampering.
Transport layer uploads the pre-processed data to the
cloud to allow the cloud to extract and create more useful
services For efficient power utilization, only a portion of
collected data is uploaded to the cloud.
Note that the above architecture does not include the CC
itself.
NIST [10] defines the Fog computing as a horizontal,
physical or virtual resource paradigm that resides between
smart end-devices and traditional cloud or data centers. FC
supports vertically-isolated, latency-sensitive applications
by providing ubiquitous, scalable, layered, federated, and
distributed computing, storage, and network connectivity.
FC
has
as
main
characteristics:
contextual
location
awareness, and low latency, geographical distribution with
predominance
of
wireless
access,
large-scale
sensor
networks, very large number of nodes, support for mobility,
real-time interactions, heterogeneity, interoperability and
federation, support for real-time analytics and interplay with
the cloud. NIST has defined [10] a three-layer architecture
composed of Smart end-devices layer, Fog layer and Cloud
layer. The bottom layer of the Fog is named “mist” and
comprises an infrastructure close to the end-devices. The so-
called “edge” is seen as a part of the Cloud layer.
Despite still different visions on EC semantics, the most
agreed vision on EC and FC is that FC is actually a
superset of the EC, i.e., FC would include EC.
From the industry world, the Industry 4.0 vision on Fog
and IoT emerged [22]. Industrial IoT and Industry 4.0 need
for extensive adoption of advanced IT features across
multiple Industry verticals. IT and Operational Technology
(OT) convergence is aimed. The important step to this aim
is the deployment of Cloud-like resources at the edge and
within the Industrial Operational domain.
FC merges CC features with real-time and safety OT
features (efficiency, flexibility and resource management) It
applies resource virtualization, real-time and no real-time
computing,
modern
application
management,
data
interoperability middleware, storage, analytics, advanced
networking and security. Complementary technologies are
Time-Triggered Technologies which refers to precise time
distribution,
time-sensitive
networking
and
computing
resource allocation (standardized as IEEE Time Sensitive
Networking TSN); TSN is a key element of Industry 4.0 and
a necessary component of FC in industrial environment. It
enables the convergence of Industrial wired protocols
towards a unified standard.
Recently, Bacarelli et. al. [23]) extended the FC scope,
by defining Fog of Everything (FoE) to serve Internet of
Everything
(IoE).
The
FNs
are
usually
virtualized
networked data centers, which run on top of (typically,
wireless) Access Points (APs), at the edge of the access
network, resulting in a three-tier IoE-Fog-Cloud hierarchy.
In this context, a “thing” (fixed, nomadic or mobile) is a
resource-limited
user
device
that
needs
resource
augmentation in order to execute its workload. The work
[23] proposes a hierarchical general architecture for a FoE
virtualized platform, integrating the building blocks:

IoE
layer,
where
a
number
of
(possibly,
heterogeneous) things operate over multiple spatial
clusters;

Wireless access network (fixed/mobile), to supports
Fog-to-Thing
(F2T)
and
Thing-to-Fog
(T2F)
communication through TCP/IP connections running
atop, e.g., IEEE802.11/15 single-hop links;

A set of inter-connected FNs, that act as virtualized
cluster headers;

Inter-Fog
backbone
(wireline/wireless)
providing
inter-Fog connectivity and making feasible inter-Fog
resource pooling;

Virtualization layer, allowing things to augment their
limited
resources
by
exploiting
the
computing

capability of a corresponding virtual clone. This last
runs atop a physical server of the FN that currently
serves the cloned thing;

the resulting overlay inter-clone virtual network, that
allows P2P inter-clone communication by relying on
TCP/IP E2E connections.
The corresponding protocol stack [23] comprises four
layers:
IoE layer
provides services like:
(a) T2F access
through a reservation-based collision free access protocol
for the things served by a same FN; (b) F2T broadcast
services.
Fog layer performs: (a) energy-efficient management of
the networking and computing physical resources equipping
each FN, and (b) energy-efficient management of the inter-
Fog traffic conveyed by the wireless backbone.
Overlay layer supports the overlay inter-clone P2P
network by: (a) inter-Fog Clone migration; it can be
supported by the implementation of the so-called Follow-
Me-Cloud framework (e.g., Taleb et al.,
[18]), to solve
“live” inter-Fog clone migration, in response to the thing
mobility; (b) dynamic
management of
the required
migration bandwidth, to minimize the energy consumed by
clone migrations.
Cloud layer orchestrates the overall Cloud-Fog-IoE
platform on the basis of the specific features and Quality of
Service (QoS) requirements of the running applications. The
solutions must be tailored on the expected attributes of the
supported applications.
The
MEC
architecture
is
another
important
EC
approach. It has been promoted mainly by ETSI [7-9] and
offers low latency/response time, high bandwidth, location
and
context awareness, reduction in amount of data
transferred from/to a terminal device to a centralized cloud
data center, etc. The ETSI MEC Industry Specification
Group (2014) provided first specifications. In 2017, the
MEC name (and scope) has been extended to Multi-access
Edge Computing [9], to include non-cellular and fixed
access cases. MEC supports multi-services and multi-
tenancy and is usually developed in the operators’ networks.
However, authorized external third-parties may also make
use of the MEC storage and processing capabilities.
The MEC resources are placed at the radio network edge
(e.g., in Radio Access Network – RAN, i.e., Base Stations,
or in aggregation points, etc.). The key element is MEC
application
server,
integrated
in
RAN
and
providing
computing resources, storage capacity, connectivity, and
access to user traffic and radio and network information.
The MEC reference architecture is presented in Figure 1
(details, in [8]). The mobile edge host level is the main
MEC sub-system, composed of: the Mobile Edge Host
(MEH)
and
its
management.
The
MEH
includes
a
virtualization infrastructure (based on Network Function
Virtualisation Infrastructure –NFVI- coming from ETSI
NFV framework [15][16]) and the Mobile Edge Platform
(MEP),
supporting
the
execution
of
mobile
edge
applications. The MEC server can be installed in various
places at the network edge: at the 4G/LTE macro base
station (eNB); at the multi-technology (3G/LTE) cell
aggregation site; at the Radio Network Controller (RNC)
site, for 3G.

EDGE COMPUTING POSSIBLE CONVERGENCE
The previous section outlined the general characteristics
of the EC and summarized two main approaches FC and
MEC. This section analyzes some common features and also
differences
in
approaches,
to
evaluate
chances
of
convergence.
MEC/FC/Cloudlets
have
quite
a
lot
of
common
characteristics like: low latency; support for real time
interactions, location awareness and mobility and large
number of server nodes; geographical distribution proximity
to the end devices (single network hop or few
hops);
service location at the edge of the local network; various
working environment outdoor (streets, base stations, etc.) or
indoor (houses, cafes, etc.); wireless communication access:
WLAN,
WiFi,
3G,
4G,
ZigBee,
etc.,
or
wired
communication (part of the IP networks); weak dependence
on the quality of core network; low bandwidth costs energy
consumption. However, the nodes in FC, MEC, Cloudlets
have weak computation and storage capabilities, which
raises a need for them to cooperate with CC. All three
approaches can benefit from technologies like SDN and
NFV in different architectures.
Considering MEC and FC, there are differences between
them
from
several
points
of
view
(see
[1][6]),
as
summarised in Table I.

The above table shows several differences between
MEC and FC approaches. Note that Table I does not
suppose some application specific architectures, but general
ones. From this, it is apparent that there is not yet defined a
common EC architecture. The MEC/FC/Cloudlets paradigm
can offer more or less appropriate support for a large variety
applications and use-case scenarios and heterogeneous end
devices.
On
the
other
side
different
use
cases
and
applications might have their own set of requirements and
trade-offs which can determine which solution is the
appropriate choice.
Actually, for a given set of use cases, the selection of an
appropriate EC approach is a multi-criteria problem. Among
the parameters/criteria for selection those presented in Table
I could be considered, if appropriate weights are assigned to
them.
However, recently, a strong effort for cooperation
started,
between
different
organizations,
towards
a
convergence of vision in the domain of edge computing
(including MEC, Fog, Cloudlets, etc.).
Open Edge Computing (OEC)
[24][25] is a novel
general approach of EC, towards convergence, consisting in
small data centers at the network edge, offering computing
and storage resources next to the user. Carnegie Mellon
University (CMU) performed an early work on Cloudlets at
the edge. Given the interests in EC, in 2015 a few parties
joined research efforts under the open source banner of
Open Edge Computing (OEC). Currently, OEC ecosystem
includes CMU, Intel, Huawei, Vodafone, and so on.

The main OEC goals are: to promote Cloudlets as
enabling technology; to drive the necessary technology for
various use cases (low latency and computation at the edge)
(e.g., extensions to OpenStack, KVM, QEMU); to prototype
applications that leverage EC pushing the boundaries and
demonstrating benefits; to drive the eco system development
for OEC and use current IT solutions.
OEC is engaging with target service industries/sectors
through demonstrators and joint projects; with developer
communities, seeking feedback and driving EC acceptance.
OEC is synchronizing its work with other efforts including
ETSI ISG MEC and OPNFV.
The OEC servers can be located close/associated to Base
Stations, Access Points, Small Cells, or even in the Operator
Core Network (Figure 2). Edge Computing will utilize the
Network
Function
Virtualization
(NFV)
infrastructure
wherever
possible.
This
will
reduce
significantly
the
deployment cost of EC.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper presented a preliminary comparative view of
some Edge Computing approaches (Fog computing, Mobile
Edge Computing, Cloudlets) in order to identify their
common and different characteristics and possible chances
to have in the near future an EC unified architecture. For the
time being, no strong convergence exists, given the large
area of use cases and applications targeted to be supported
and the pragmatic attempts to tailor the specific architecture
to the desired class of applications.
However, recently, a strong effort for cooperation
started,
between
different
organizations,
towards
a
convergence of vision in the domain of edge computing
(including MEC, Fog, Cloudlets, etc.).
Future work should be done, to investigate more deeply
the sets of architectural layers and mechanisms to identify
where a common approach can be applied, in order to
reduce the development effort and reuse some already
developed functional modules.
