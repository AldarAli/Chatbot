Abstract—Ultra-Dense Network (UDN) has emerged as a key
enabler in enhancing the capacity of mobile networks in order
to deliver super-speed connectivity and high data rates, provide
seamless coverage and support diverse use cases whilst satis-
fying a wide range of other performance requirements, such
as improved reliability, latency, energy and spectral efﬁciencies.
However, the reduced cell size in UDNs poses serious challenges
in the areas of inter-cell interference (ICI) coordination and
mobility management (due to increased frequency of handovers
and signaling overheads). In this study, we simulate scenarios
using Network Simulator version 3 (NS-3) to study the impact
of cell size on user throughput at the point of handover using
pedestrian mobility (3 kmph) as case study. The simulation
results show improved spectral (and energy) efﬁciency with small
cells over macrocells but signiﬁcantly shorter handover times,
which translate to more frequent handovers. And since the Long
Term Evolution (LTE) and next-generation cellular networks
are required to support mobility without serious impact on
connectivity and performance, we align with the decoupling of the
user and control planes where the macro-layer manages control
signals (e.g., handover signaling) while the small cell provides
the users with high data rates. By allocating the small cells
more bandwidth, preferably in the millimeter wave (mmWave)
bands with abundant spectrum, this decoupled framework will
guarantee better spectrum management to support the ﬁfth-
generation (5G) broadband services and applications.

INTRODUCTION
Mobile networks have witnessed paradigm shifts in terms
of deliverables, architectures and technologies through its
evolution from the ﬁrst-generation (1G) cellular systems an-
nounced in the early 1980’s to the 5G networks expected to
be deployed by 2020. Between 1G and 4G, mobile networks
have moved from analogue to digital, voice-only to multimedia
(voice and data), circuit-switched to packet-switched networks,
and from 2.4 kbps throughput to a peak data rate of 100 Mbps
(for highly mobile users) and up to 1 Gbps (for stationary and
pedestrian users) [1], [2].
Alongside other performance metrics (data rate, capacity,
coverage, latency, cost, spectral and energy efﬁciencies), mo-
bility is an important feature in cellular systems as it enables
users to freely roam across different cells in the network
without serious impact on connectivity and performance [3].
While LTE systems standardized by the Third Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP) have shown signiﬁcant improve-
ments in performance, the ever-growing demand for higher
data rates and ubiquitous mobility required by new applications
continues to pose serious challenges on legacy networks. With
4G networks reaching their theoretical limits, 5G networks are
now building momentum to provide the networking solution
for the new and smart digital era [4].
In the road towards 5G, the concept of UDN has been
identiﬁed as the single most effective way to increase net-
work capacity [5], among other enablers, such as massive
multiple-input multiple-output (massive MIMO) antenna sys-
tem, mmWave communication and device-to-device (D2D)
communications [6]. Based on its potentials to signiﬁcantly
raise throughput, increase energy and spectral efﬁciencies, as
well as enhance seamless coverage for cellular networks, pock-
ets of dense deployment of low-power base stations (otherwise
called small cells - microcell, femtocell, metrocell, picocells -
with different levels of power, coverage and capabilities) are
being witnessed in LTE systems, and hence the term LTE UDN
[5].
The idea of small cells is to get users physically close
to their serving base station (BS), thereby bringing down the
inter-site distance (ISD) between two cells from 500-1000 m
in macro BSs to 100-200 m for micro BSs (small cells) for
typical urban deployment scenarios in the 2 GHz band. Hyper-
densiﬁcation of small cells is a promising solution in meeting
the capacity, energy and spectral efﬁciencies expectations of
next-generation cellular networks. However, despite the great
anticipated beneﬁts, the concept of UDN presents two principal
challenges: mobility management and interference coordina-
tion. These challenges have drawn the attention of the research
community in recent years [5], [7].

Increased ICI resulting from reduced cell size in UDNs is

techniques, while separation architecture (i.e., decoupling of
the user plane from the control plane, as illustrated in Figure
1) is being proposed and investigated for mobility management
[8]. The topology is such that the macro-layer handles the more
efﬁcient control plane functions, such as mobility management,
synchronization and resource allocation etc., while the small

cells handle the high-capacity and spectrally-efﬁcient data
plane services [2]. This framework will allow more bandwidth
to be allocated to the small cells for high data rate user
experience. The high-power macro BSs, with much wider
coverage, will provide control signaling which has low rate
requirements, thereby leading to better spectrum management
for next-generation cellular networks.
In this study, we simulate two scenarios to investigate
the impact of cell size on user throughput during X2-based
handover processes. The ﬁrst set explores the mobility of a
User Equipment (UE) between two macrocells with ISD of
500-1000 m while the second set studies the behavior of
small cells with ISD of 100-200 m, which are typical values
for urban macrocell and microcell deployment, respectively
[5], [7]. The goal is to investigate the decoupled/separation
architecture being proposed in literature for user mobility
management in UDN deployment for future mobile systems.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section
II gives an overview of related literature; Section III details
the simulation procedures. Results and analyses are presented
in Section IV and Section V provides the conclusions and
direction for future work.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Handover algorithms play an important role in LTE net-
works as they impact on the performance of the systems. Stud-
ies have been conducted to investigate the effect of handover
on signaling overhead, user throughput, outage probability, cell
capacity, load balancing, interference management and energy
efﬁciency, among others, using different scenarios, set-ups and
simulators [3], [9]. In this work, we investigate the impact of
cell size on user data rate and spectral efﬁciency at the point
of handover. In this section, we present a brief overview on
handover in LTE networks and the tool (NS-3) used for the
study.
A. Overview of NS-3
NS-3 is an open source, discrete-event network simulator
which provides a platform for conducting simulation experi-
ments with packet data networks. It is built as a system of
software libraries that work together, with user programs writ-
ten in either the C++ and/or Python programming languages.
For the purpose of education and research, NS-3 serves as a
tool to model and study the behavior of networks or systems in
a highly controlled, reproducible environment which may be
difﬁcult or impossible with real systems [10], [11]. Compared
to NS-2, NS-3 has better core architectural features which
enable the simulation of realistic packets and development of
complex simulation models [12].
B. Evolved Packet System (EPS)
According to 3GPP, EPS is divided into two different
functional parts: Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access
Network (E-UTRAN) and Evolved Packet Core (EPC) repre-
senting the RAN and the core network, respectively. These are
also known as LTE and System Architecture Evolution (SAE),
respectively [13]. The EPS system architecture is illustrated in
Figure 2.
In NS-3, the EPS system is modeled by the LTE-EPC
Network SimulAtor (LENA) model shown in Figure 3, com-
prising of the UE, evolved NodeB (eNodeB), combined serving

functionalities [11], [9], [14].

In EPS, handover decision and implementation are solely
undertaken by the eNodeBs. And in contrast with the third-
generation (3G) Universal Mobile Telecommunications System
(UMTS), handover in LTE is hard handover (i.e.,) the UE
has to be ﬁrst disconnected from the serving eNodeB before
being attached to the target/neighbor eNodeB with better signal
strength [13].
C. Mobility Management in LTE
LTE networks have simpliﬁed architecture, improved user
mobility support and higher data rate capability than earlier
generations of cellular systems [15]. As users move between
the coverage areas of the eNodeBs, they get, process and report
32

measurements about their serving and neighbor eNodeBs [16].
According to 3GPP LTE, UE measurement reports are the
key input for X2-based handover processes [3], which are ac-
complished in four phases: downlink handover measurements,
processing of downlink measurements, uplink reporting and
handover decision and execution [16].
Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) and Reference
Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) measured in dBm and dB,
respectively, are two types of handover triggering quantities
measured by the UE which are reported to the serving eNodeB
[11]. As the UEs move away from the serving eNodeB and
towards the neighbor eNodeB, the quality of the signal from
the serving eNodeB degrades and that of the neighbor eNodeB
improves, thus necessitating a handover from the former to
the latter. Depending on the handover algorithm, the required
condition(s) set out by 3GPP, as presented in Table I, would
have to be satisﬁed in order to trigger the handover process.

Serving cell becomes better than threshold.

Serving cell becomes worse than threshold.
A3
Neighbor cell becomes offset dB better than serving cell.
A4
Neighbor cell becomes better than threshold.
A5
Serving cell becomes worse than threshold 1 and neighbor
cell becomes better than threshold 2.
In LTE, there are two types of handover: S1-based han-
dover involving eNodeBs and the MME, and X2-based han-
dover which is entirely handled by the eNodeBs. And ac-
cording to 3GPP speciﬁcations, the X2 interface is a point-
to-point interface which inter-connects two eNodeBs and over
which X2-based handover is implemented. Handover in LTE
is a UE-assisted (i.e., UE provides input to the network in
form of measurement reports) and network-controlled process
(i.e., dependent on the source and target/neighbor eNodeBs for
triggering and execution) [15].

In the LENA model, test suites are provided to evaluate
three types of X2-based handover algorithms: A2-A4-RSRQ,
A3-RSRP and no-op handover algorithms [14]. The no-op
algorithm is a special algorithm which disables automatic
handover trigger in order to allow manual handover, while the
other two are automatic and based on UE measurement reports
satisfying the respective conditions set out in Table I, based
on 3GPP speciﬁcations [3], [11], [14].

For the A2-A4-RSRQ algorithm, the threshold and offset
parameters respectively represent the RSRQ values and the dif-
ference in RSRQ between the serving and target cells that must
be surpassed before handover would happen. For the A3-RSRP,
the hysteresis value represents the difference in RSRP between
the serving and target cells that must be maintained for an
amount of time called Time-to-Trigger (TTT) before handover
could be triggered [3], [17]. Typical handover signaling and
measurement curves indicating the triggering parameters are
shown in Figures 4 and 5, respectively.

SIMULATION PROCEDURES
In this section, we describe the test scenarios and present
the simulation parameters and tools.
A. Test Scenarios and Simulation Parameters
In order to evaluate the effect of cell size on user through-
put in LTE UDN during handover scenarios, the implemented
cellular network topology is shown in Figure 6. The scenario
was simulated using a modiﬁed lena-x2-handover-measures.cc
script available in the LTE module of NS-3, to implement the
A2-A4-RSRQ X2-based handover algorithm.

respect to the UE and eNodeBs (macrocell and microcell),
which are broadly in line with ITU-R case study in [7].
B. Tools and Softwares
The simulation was carried out using ns-3.24 version
installed on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS operating system via VMware
Workstation 12 Player installed on a 4 GB RAM, core i3 HP
laptop computer. The Network Animator (NetAnim) software
was used for the animation display while the graphs of the
simulation results were plotted using MATLAB.

RESULTS AND ANALYSES
In the following subsections, we present the results and
analyses of the simulations.
A. Animation of Network Topology
A sample snapshot of the topology obtained from NetAnim
is shown in Figure 7. Node 0 is the SGW/PGW, node 1 is the
remote host, node 2 is the serving eNodeB, node 3 is the target
eNodeB while node 4 represents the UE. It also illustrates the
time of the handover, thereby serving as a tool to monitor that
the scripts executed as designed.
B. Simulation Results
From the RSRP/RSRQ traces obtained from the simula-
tions, the downlink RSRP and SINR values obtained at the
points of handover for both the serving and target cells are
presented in Tables III and IV, for the microcell and macrocell,
respectively.

C. Analyses and Discussion
At handover, from the simulations results presented in
Tables III-V and plots shown in Figures 8-11,
1) the RSRP values, spectral efﬁciencies and data rates for
the serving cells are lower than those of the target cells

for all the scenarios, thus justifying the need for handover.
Without handover, the serving cell signal and performance
would continue to degrade thereby leading to low quality
of experience (QoE) for the end users.
2) the RSRP values, spectral efﬁciencies and data rates for
the microcell deployment are better than those of the
macrocell deployment for all scenarios. In each case, the
performance improves as the ISD reduces, with the best
results achieved at ISD of 100 m.
3) the performance of the microcell scenarios were better
than those of the macrocells, despite the higher transmit
power of the macrocells. This implies that the small cells
have better energy efﬁciencies.
4) the handover times for the microcells were signiﬁcantly
shorter than those of the macrocell scenarios. This implies
an increase in the number of handovers in the small cells.
5) the difference in performance between the serving and
target cells at the point of handover were higher in the
small cell deployments than those of the macrocells. This
shows that the macrocells are more stable in handling
control signaling than small cells. With small cells han-
dling handover, the hysteresis and TTT values would
be achieved much faster, thereby resulting in increased
frequency of handover.
Quantitatively, as can be deduced from Table V, the
required handover time for macrocells is 5x that of small
cells for typical deployment scenarios with ISD of 500 m
and 100 m (and 10x for 1000 m and 100 m) for macrocell
and small cell, respectively. Very short handover times will
result in increased frequency of handover and signiﬁcantly
high measurement overheads, thereby leading to poor spectrum
management, which is undesirable for next-generation mobile
networks, starting with 5G.
It should however be noted that the scenario considered
in the simulation is a single-user, single-input single-output
(SISO) system which did not consider the effects of inter-
ference from multiple users nor implemented enhancements
such as carrier aggregation and advanced MIMO techniques,
all of which will impact on the obtained results. Also, other
simplifying assumptions have been used in the development
of LTE/LENA modules in NS-3, and the interested reader is
referred to [14] for the details.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
Densiﬁcation of small cells has the potential to deliver
increased network capacity based on increased cell density and
high spatial and frequency reuse, enhanced spectral efﬁciency
based on improved average SINR (with tighter interference
control) and improved energy efﬁciency based on reduced
transmission power and lower path loss resulting from smaller
cell radii or distance between the small cells and the UEs.
On the other hand, however, UDN presents serious chal-
lenges in terms of mobility support, interference management
and cost. In the context of mobility, it poses a severe problem
due to high frequency of handovers (due to shorter handover
time), increased signaling and high measurement overheads
that would be incurred if the control signals are from spatially-
close small cells. Results from this simulation campaign but-
tress these outcomes.
The trend and direction for future work in realizing the
gains of densiﬁcation of small cells, therefore, is to decouple
the control and user planes such that mobility management
(handover and other control signaling) is handled by the
macrocell layer where very high data rate is not required,
while the data plane functionalities are handled by the closest
small cell in order to support the high data rate demands of
next-generation services and applications. This framework is
an area of growing research interest for 5G and beyond-5G
(B5G) systems.
