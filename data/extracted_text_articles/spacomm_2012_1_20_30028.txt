Abstract— The intermodulation distortion phenomena caused 
by nonlinear characteristic of active RF equipments is a 
significant 
source 
of 
system 
impairment 
in 
satellite 
communications. Telecommunications signals are usually 
composed of more than one carrier modulated by information 
signal. When number of carriers passing through a nonlinear 
medium increases, which is the case in communications 
satellite receivers, the prediction of the intermodulation 
distortion becomes more and more complex. Considering the 
scarcity of frequency spectrum and other resources in orbit, 
satellite channel performances should delicately be examined 
in order to ensure efficient and uninterrupted communications 
through all channels and avoid any channel failure due to 
intermodulation phenomena.  This paper presents a practical 
tool 
for 
calculating 
and 
simulating 
the 
effect 
of 
intermodulation signal distortion and C/I performances of the 
broadband satellite receivers placed at the communication 
satellite payload input section. With this tool, the effect of a 
collocated satellite system operating in an adjacent frequency 
band can also be easily calculated. 
Keywords- Intermodulation distortion; spectral regrowth; 
satellite communications. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
A significant amount of communications traffic is 
handled by communications satellites and therefore these 
systems fulfill a huge amount of the communication needs in 
today’s world. Broadband receivers are used on-board 
satellites in order to operate over a frequency range of a few 
hundred MHz usually, serving a maximum number of 
carriers to achieve high spectral efficiency.  
Multiple signals simultaneously arriving at the receiver 
generate intermodulation noise due to the nonlinear 
characteristics of the receiver itself.  This noise is generated 
by a large number of intermodulation products which 
interfere with the useful carriers. Due to the existence of 
these products, the amplitudes of the useful carriers are 
limited and the system efficiency is decreased. In the frame 
of 
these 
arguments, 
simulation 
and 
prediction 
of 
intermodulation distortion is a crucial issue for arranging 
frequency plan of satellite communication systems. 
There are several manifestations on the algorithms and 
techniques 
developed 
for 
modeling 
and 
simulating 
intermodulation products [1]-[6]. Fast Counting Algorithm 
(FCA) assumes a number of identical carriers distributed 
over a frequency range with equally spaced frequency 
positions, and the distortion is dominated by the third-order 
intermodulation products of fi+fj-fk type, neglecting the ones 
of 2fi-fj type [1]. FCA employs FFT algorithm together with 
indicator polynomials modeling the carrier configuration. 
Higher order intermodulation products and harmonics are 
also computed by extending the FCA algorithm [2]. In [3], 
the third-order intermodulation spectrum is calculated by 
convolution of the input power spectrum using the FFT 
method. Another alternative method suggests noise band 
representation replacing identical contiguous narrow band 
carriers with an equivalent band of thermal noise [4]. In this 
method, intermodulation products are restricted to fi+fj-fk 
type. Another popular technique is modeling with Volterra 
series. Discrete third-order Volterra model is used in [5] and 
[6] to compute third-order products. In [7], Volterra-Wiener 
technique is adopted for this purpose. 
In this work, our first goal is to model and simulate 
intermodulation distortion taking place in communication 
satellite receivers with a fair accuracy and complexity. To 
achieve this goal, polynomial model is employed together 
with a counting algorithm, and only two types of 
intermodulation products, namely fi+fj-fk and 2fi-fj types, are 
taken into account. This is because these two types of 
products are dominating the in-band intermodulation 
distortion [8].  Secondly, we are aiming to design this 
simulation tool in a way that it will be useful for satellite 
communications systems’ designers in the industry. In this 
respect, the inputs of the simulation tool are the uplink 
frequency plan of the satellite and some characteristics of the 
equipments.  The outputs are the total third-order 
intermodulation noise power and carrier to intermodulation 
distortion power ratio (C/I), given for each predefined 
satellite channel, which are going to assist the designers to 
figure out the system linearity performances. Considering the 
importance of the risk management in the communication 
satellite industry, such tools can have a critical role in the 
AIT (Assembly, Integration and Test) phase.

MODELING THIRD-ORDER IMPS 
A. Polynomial Model 
Polynomials have been used extensively to model 
nonlinearities for many applications. The polynomial model, 
also called as power series representation in literature, is a 
simple and highly effective technique for modeling nonlinear 
behavior. It provides freedom of design in choosing a higher-
degree polynomial for higher accuracy, or a lower-degree 
polynomial for less computational complexity.  
The output y(t) of a nonlinear system with respect to an 
input signal x(t) can be modeled by  a polynomial function as

where ai represents nonlinearity coefficients that 
characterizes the system’s behavior. The second, third and 
higher order terms of (1) explain the spectral regrowth. 
B. Two-Tone Input Model 
Assume an input signal composed of two carriers with 
the same amplitude and at different frequencies, as shown in 
(2). The phase values are taken to be zero for simplicity. In 
the output spectrum, there are elements originated from 
interaction 
of 
these 
two 
tones, 
which 
are 
called 
“intermodulation products”, as well as the “harmonics” of 
the fundamental frequencies.

The 3rd order intermodulation products have an in-band 
distortion effect whereas the harmonics gather at distinct 
frequencies constituting out-of-band distortion. In fact, all 
odd order intermodulation products appear exactly over, or 
very close to the output fundamental frequencies.  
Signal to third-order intermodulation distortion ratio 
(C/I3) is an important figure of merit of a system’s 
nonlinearity described by two-tone characterization method. 
It is defined as the ratio between one of the output 
fundamental’s power and the power of the nearest third-
order intermodulation product, given as

C. Three-Tone Input Model 
Three-tone response should also be investigated to be 
able to compare both fi+fj-fk and 2fi-fj types of products. With 
the same assumptions made for two-tone response, the input 
signal is written as

Thus, the power of each fi+fj-fk type product is 
approximately 6 dB higher than that of 2fi-fj types. Having 
this information, the power of both types of individual 
products can be calculated since the C/I3 specification of the 
receiver reveals the power of 2fi-fj type products. Therefore, 
the parameters values in (1) are not necessarily calculated 
since the relationship between the powers of both types of 
products are known.

SIMULATION TOOL 
A tool has been developed for modeling and simulation 
of intermodulation distortion caused by the broadband 
receivers placed at the input section of communication 
satellite payloads. It can be helpful for both satellite 
manufacturers and operators to predict intermodulation 
distortion within the utilized bandwidth. This is because 
satellite manufacturers need to predict accurately this kind of 
signal 
distortion 
to 
ensure 
communication 
system

performances, whereas the operators need to decide on the 
configuration of the satellite frequency plan for minimizing 
the risk of interruptions and providing the best to their 
customers.  
A. Assumptions and Inputs  
In order to simulate this kind of distortion, it is assumed 
that the 2fi-fj and fi+fj-fk types of third-order intermodulation 
products dominate the in-band intermodulation noise and the 
higher order terms can be neglected. Unlike many other 
studies, the carriers are not necessarily being equally spaced. 
What is assumed in this tool is that there exists one single-
level carrier at the center frequency of each satellite channel.  
Thus, the carrier configuration reflects exactly the frequency 
plan of the satellite.  
Under these assumptions, the tool can be initialized with 
the following inputs as shown in Fig. 2: 
a) Input power / Carrier (dBm): Carrier levels at the 
receiver input. It can be extracted from uplink 
budget. 
b) C/I3 (dB): Signal to third-order intermodulation 
distortion ratio. C/I3 is a parameter from receiver 
datasheets.  
c) Satellite frequency plan (MHz): Min. and max. 
frequencies of each channel. 
d) If there is a collocated satellite using an adjacent 
band: 
• 
Collocated satellite frequency plan (MHz): 
Min. and max. frequencies of each channel. 
• 
Main satellite’s input filter rejection ratio for 
the adjacent band (dB).

B. Outputs 
The algorithm is composed of five main steps. First step 
is the initialization. After providing the necessary data, 
program 
parameters 
are 
loaded. 
Some 
preliminary 
calculations are also performed at this stage. In the second 
and third steps, the frequencies and powers of all 2fi-fj and 
fi+fj-fk types of products emerging from the given carrier 
configuration are computed and stored, respectively. Then, 
all third-order products are sorted and counted with respect 
to the satellite channel frequencies in order to figure out C/I 
performances of each channel. Finally, the results are printed 
on screen in tabular and graphical forms. 
The program provides the following results for each 
satellite channel:  
a) Total number and power of 2fi-fj type products  
b) Total number and power of fi+fj-fk type products  
c) Cumulative third-order intermodulation power 
d) C/I, carrier to intermodulation noise ratio 
IV. 
CASE STUDIES 
Two cases have been considered and simulated. In the 
first case a single satellite in the orbit is considered, whereas 
in the second case, a collocated satellite is assumed to be 
operating at the same orbital location. 
A. First Scenario 
We consider a hypothetical communication satellite 
“Sat_1” that has 15 Ku-band transponders with 36 and 72 
MHz bandwidth channels totaling 920 MHz bandwidth. 4 
MHz guard bands exist between each channel. The 
intermodulation products are calculated for the vertical 
polarization. This calculation should be done for each 
polarization. In our case, frequency plan is exactly the same 
for 
both 
polarizations. 
Based 
on 
the 
equipment 
specifications, the input parameters are given as follows:  
a) Input power / Carrier = -60 dBm 
b) C/I3 = 55 dBc 
c) Sat_1 Frequency Plan = as seen in Fig.  2. 
When the simulation is performed under the assumptions 
of this scenario, the results are summarized in Table 1. C/I 
values for each channel are shown graphically in Fig. 3. The 
number of IMPs of each type generated within each channel 
is shown graphically in Fig. 4. 
B. Second Scenario 
In this case, we assume that there exists a collocated 
satellite “Sat_2” sharing the same orbital position with 
Sat_1. Sat_2 utilizes a 600 MHz bandwidth in the adjacent 
band which is comprised of 15 transponders with 36 MHz 
bandwidths. The input parameters in reference to the 
equipment specifications are given as follows: 
a) Sat_1 Input Filter Rejection @ Sat_2 Freq. = 20 dB 
b) Sat_2 Frequency Plan = as seen in Fig. 2. 
The simulation results are given in Table 2. The C/I 
values and the number of IMPs for each channel are also 
shown in graphical form in Fig. 5 and 6, respectively.

C. Discussion 
For the first scenario, the maximum intermodulation 
distortion occurs in the 8th channel (ch.8) with -89.37 dBm, 
and the minimum in 5th and 11th channels with a value of -
94.51 dBm. Due to the symmetric configuration of the 
frequency plan, the results are also symmetric around ch8. In 
the second scenario, the maximum distortion takes place in 
the 8th channel again with -89.34 dBm, whereas the 
minimum is in the 5th channel with -94.46 dBm. Since there 
is no symmetry in this case, the existence of the collocated 
satellite channels affects the distortion scheme. According to 
these results, we can conclude the followings: 
a) Resultant C/I values of all channels are at least 20 
dB less than the C/I3 specification of the receiver 
itself i.e., the effect of third-order intermodulation 
distortion is quite significant.  
b) The C/I values of the channels vary up to 5 dB. 
Thus, 
intermodulation 
distortion 
affects 
the 
channels differently depending on the carrier 
configuration.  
c) fi+fj-fk type of intermodulation products are much 
greater than 2fi-fj type both in number and power. 
i.e., fi+fj-fk type products are much more dominant 
in determining the cumulative distortion power. 
d) The existence of a collocated satellite system 
operating in an adjacent band affects the C/I 
performances. 
However, 
this 
effect 
is 
not 
significant in this case because the adjacent satellite 
carriers are suppressed by 20 dB by the input filter 
before arriving at the receiver of the first satellite.  
Depending upon the input filter rejection, C/I values 
will be different. The more rejection means much 
better C/I values.

CONCLUSION 
The two case studies demonstrate that significant 
degradation in the C/I performance may occur due to 
intermodulation 
phenomena. 
Besides, 
the 
level 
of 
degradation varies among the satellite transponders. 
Therefore, the C/I performances of each channel should 
carefully be analyzed. In this work, we have presented a 
practical simulation tool to compute the effect of third order 
intermodulation 
distortion 
caused 
by 
the 
nonlinear 
characteristics of communication satellite receivers. It 
presents channel by channel results and helps optimizing

satellite frequency plan. Besides, the effect of collocated 
satellite system on the linearity performance of the payload 
input section can also be simulated.  In order to achieve a 
good balance between computational complexity and 
accuracy, third order intermodulation products are taken into 
account, namely 2fi-fj and fi+fj-fk types. The tool is 
configured for the use of satellite communications experts.
