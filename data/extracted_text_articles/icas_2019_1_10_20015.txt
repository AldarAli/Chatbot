Abstract - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), due to their 
remarkable development, relatively low cost, and low risk to 
human are a prime candidate for the teaming with manned 
aircraft in performing complex missions. There are various 
challenges and techniques for manned-unmanned aircraft 
collaboration. This paper introduces the concept of manned-
unmanned aircraft teaming, as well as teaming architecture. 
The technical requirements for a manned-aircraft-leader, 
unmanned-aircraft-follower teaming are discussed. In addition, 
the teaming formulation, teaming laws, and sense-and-avoid

INTRODUCTION 
Today’s aircraft inventory includes a diverse mix of 
manned and unmanned systems. Unmanned aerial vehicles 
are a prime candidate for the teaming with manned aircraft in 
performing complex/dangerous missions. Unmanned aircraft 
systems are subject to regulation by the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) to ensure safety of flight, and safety of 
people and property on the ground. Incidents involving 
unauthorized and unsafe use of small, remote-controlled 
aircraft have risen [16] dramatically. One of the main goals 
for the manned-unmanned teaming is to provide ﬂexible and 
safe flight operations. Teaming a UAV system with manned 
systems will offer advantages to both. 
To achieve the full potential of unmanned systems at an 
affordable cost, efforts must be conducted to implement 
technologies and evolve tactics, techniques and procedures 
that improve the teaming of unmanned systems with the 
manned aircraft. An efficient teaming will create an 
environment such that both parties operate within their limits, 
while generating an unachievable goal by one party. The 
functions of a UAV in a team with manned aircraft depend in 
nature on the different UAV conﬁgurations and their 
characteristics.    
A literature survey has reflected that various technical 
documents have investigated many aspects of manned-
unmanned teaming.  Unmanned vehicle systems are being 
introduced into Army systems to extend manned capabilities 
and act as “force multipliers” [1]. Jameson et al. [2] have 
presented the collaborative autonomy for manned/unmanned 
teams. The researchers in [3] have explored the expansion of 
the envelope of unmanned aircraft systems operational 
employment for manned-unmanned teaming. Accuracy 
assessment of professional grade unmanned systems for high 
precision airborne mapping is investigated in [4]. Clough et 
al. [5] have presented a perspective on the autonomous 
control challenges for UAVs from a researcher's point of 
view.  Autonomous vehicle technologies for small fixed-
wing UAVs have been discussed in [6]. There is a number of 
consequences for UAV design requirements especially on 
UAV modeling and simulation, some of which have been 
investigated in [7]. The augmentations, motivations, and 
directions for aeronautics applications of man–machine 
integration design and analysis system have been explored in 
[8].   
The researchers in [9] developed new methodologies and 
quantitative measurements for evaluating human-robot team 
performance to achieve effective coordination between teams 
of humans and unmanned vehicles. Significant challenges 
facing a successful teaming are presented in the next section. 
A team of a manned aircraft and an UAV in a flight mission 
is a complex system [10] and requires the approach of 
multidisciplinary systems engineering. Fundamentals of 
manned-unmanned aircraft teaming are presented in [17]. 
In the literature survey, we did not find any publication 
that fully develops the manned-aircraft-leader, unmanned-
aircraft-follower teaming architecture. There is a number on-
going research projects by National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA) in this area employing various 
manned aircraft and UAVs. The major contributions of this 
paper are to provide a model for decision making within the 
realms of guidance, sense-and-avoid and teaming, as well as 
to provide a teaming formulation and a teaming law. 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 
II, teaming problem formulation including three categories of 
teaming is presented. The line of sight guidance law to guide 
the UAV is developed in Section III. The UAV in turning 
flight has a couple of constraints and limits, these constraints 
and limits are introduced in Section IV. Collision avoidance 
is a primary concern in full integration of UAVs with manned 
aircraft; Section V presents the sense-and-avoid problem. 
Section VI introduces the manned-aircraft-leader, unmanned-
aircraft-follower teaming law. Finally, the success of the 
teaming architecture and performance of the sense-and-avoid 
and guidance systems are examined via flight simulations in 
Section VII. We conclude the paper in in Section VIII.

TEAMING PROBLEM FORMULATION 
Formulation of manned-unmanned teaming problem 
basically requires mathematical modeling of UAV flight 
dynamics,

and

operation. In principle, there are two independent decision 
makers: 1. Autopilot for UAV, and 2. Human pilot for the 
manned aircraft. Moreover, there are two separate 
trajectories, and two feedbacks. The teaming law creates 
command for both manned and unmanned aircraft. There is 
one group of input (mission parameters) and two outputs (i.e., 
trajectories). Both trajectories are fed back to the same point 
for comparison with the mission input. Any difference will 
create an error signal for the teaming law block. The teaming 
law will generate two signals: one for the pilot of maned 
aircraft, and one for the autopilot of the UAV.  
 
Figure 1. Functional block diagram of a teaming flight operation 
 
Fig. 1 contains information concerning dynamic 
behavior, but it does not include any information on the 
physical construction of the team. Each team member has a 
unique trajectory which is controlled by its controller (one by 
a pilot, and one by an autopilot). Both UAV and manned 
aircraft provide a feedback to another team member. The 
teaming law governs the relationship between team members 
in conducting a flight team mission. The Guidance, 
Navigation and Control (GNC) of the UAV is within the 
autopilot, while the pilot will guide and control the manned 
aircraft. 
The mathematical model of aircraft/UAV (dynamics 
model), and autopilot have been provided by [12]. In general, 
there are three categories of teaming, each governed by a 
distinct law: 1. UAV-leader, manned-aircraft-follower; 2. 
manned-aircraft-leader, UAV-follower; and 3. mixed leader-
follower. This paper is primarily focusing on category 2. 
Each teaming case has a number of advantages and 
disadvantages, and is suited for specific applications and 
flight missions. For instance, the teaming category 1 (i.e., 
UAV-leader, manned-aircraft-follower), is appropriate for a 
flight mission where the operation involves some hazards to 
human. Two examples for teaming category 1 are: 1. 
Observing a volcano, 2. Monitoring a target in the enemy 
zone for a military mission. In such a mission, the UAV takes 
the lead and the manned aircraft will follow suit. If any 
hazard arises, the UAV will be the first to face and handle it. 
This category will guarantee the safety of human plot in the 
manned aircraft. A pictorial representation of the functions 
performed by each team member in the category 2 is 
illustrated in Fig. 2.  
The UAV flight parameters are measured by both UAV 
avionics and manned aircraft measurement devices. Thus, the 
manned aircraft has two feedbacks; one from the UAV, and 
one from its own flight. The UAV will fly to accomplish the 
trajectory as the leader, while the manned aircraft will be 
guided and controlled based on the teaming law. However, 
the teaming category 2 is appropriate for a flight mission 
where the UAV acts as a reserve and no hazard is involved to 
human pilot. The teaming law for this category may be based 
on various techniques and guidance laws. 
 
 
Figure 2. Manned-aircraft-leader, UAV-follower teaming block 
diagram 
 
In the second category, the manned aircraft flight 
parameters are measured by both UAV avionics and manned 
aircraft measurement devices, as well as the pilot’s eyes. 
Thus, the UAV has two feedbacks; one from the manned-
aircraft-leader and one from its own flight. The manned 
aircraft (human pilot) will fly to accomplish the mission 
trajectory as the leader, while the UAV will be guided and 
controlled based on the teaming law. The pilot decision 
making process could be independent from the teaming law, 
as he/she plays the role of the leader. The mathematical 
formulations of control systems, guidance systems, and 
navigation systems are presented by many books and papers 
including [12].  
III. GUIDANCE LAW 
The UAV must employ a guidance law to follow the 
manned aircraft. Guidance is defined as the process of 
producing a trajectory based on what is received from the 
command subsystem and the feedback from the navigation 
system. The guidance subsystem produces the desired states 
which go to the control subsystem. The output of the 
guidance subsystem is sent to the control subsystem; based 
on the guidance law. The control system implements this 
command through actuators driving control surfaces such as 
the elevator, aileron, and rudder. Navigation system is mainly 
responsible for measuring the flight variables including the 
aircraft’s angles, the rate of change of the angles, and the 
body axis accelerations. The guidance system compares the 
location of the aircraft with the pre-determined reference 
trajectory, and modifies the autopilot commands to drive the 
error to zero. The guidance subsystem often produces an 
acceleration command. Thus, the guidance subsystem makes 
the necessary correction to keep the vehicle on course by 
sending the proper signal to the control system of an 
autopilot.  
The guidance system may be based on categories; for this 
teaming formation, the Line-Of-Sight (LOS) seems a good fit 
which satisfies the teaming requirements. The basic principle 
in LOS guidance law is to guide the UAV on a LOS course 
in an attempt to keep it on a line joining the target and the 
ground station (tracking line). For a teaming of two, the line 
of sight is defined as the line joining the follower UAV and 
the leader UAV. In addition, the leader UAV is following a 
moving ground target. For this law, the target-tracking radar 
acquires the target shortly after take-off and then guides the 
UAV into the beam of the target-tracking radar. For the

guidance command, the actual distance from the tracking line 
to the UAV is required. 
 
Figure 3. Line-Of-Sight (Top view) 
 
An imaginary line between the follower-UAV to the 
leader UAV is referred to as line-of-sight. The line of sight 
angle () is determined by forming a right triangle, when 
putting follower UAV and target, each at a corner. Then, the 
hypotenuse is along the line of sight. The line of sight angle 
is calculated by trigonometry from Fig. 3 as: 
𝜆 = 𝑡𝑎𝑛−1 (
𝑦𝑇−𝑦𝑈
𝑥𝑇−𝑥𝑈)  
                     (1) 
where xT and xU represent the distance between target and 
UAV to a reference line along x-axis, and yT and yU represent 
the distance between target and UAV to a reference line along 
y-axis. If the reference is selected to be at the UAV location, 
both yU and xU will be zero. The instantaneous distance 
between UAV and the target will be: 
𝐷𝑇𝑈 = √(𝑦𝑇 − 𝑦𝑈)2 + (𝑥𝑇 − 𝑥𝑈)2  
     (2) 
The closing velocity (Vc) - the negative rate of change of 
separation between UAV and target - is obtained [11] by: 
𝑉𝑐 =
−(𝑉𝑇𝑈𝑥(𝑥𝑇−𝑥𝑈)+𝑉𝑇𝑈𝑦(𝑦𝑇−𝑦𝑈))
𝐷𝑇𝑈
  
   (3) 
where VTUx and VTUy are components of the relative velocity 
and are given by 
𝑉𝑇𝑈𝑥 = 𝑥̇𝑇 − 𝑥̇𝑈  
 
        (4) 
𝑉𝑇𝑈𝑦 = 𝑦̇𝑇 − 𝑦̇𝑈  
 
        (5) 
The instantaneous line-of-sight rate is computed by 
taking the derivative of the equation 1, which leads to: 
𝜆̇ =
𝑉𝑇𝑈𝑦(𝑥𝑇−𝑥𝑈)−𝑉𝑇𝑈𝑥(𝑦𝑇−𝑦𝑈)
𝐷𝑇𝑈
2
  
   
  (6) 
In the line-of-sight guidance law, the velocity of the 
follower UAV (Vn) perpendicular to the LOS should be equal 
to the LOS rate at that point. It is assumed that the LOS value 
is available from the use of onboard sensors (e.g., radar). 
 𝑉𝑛 = 𝐷𝑇𝑈𝜆̇    
                    (7) 
where 𝜆̇ is the rate of change of the line of sight angle, 
and DTU denotes the distance between the follower UAV and 
the target or leader UAV. Moreover, Vn is velocity of the 
follower UAV perpendicular to the LOS. Hence, the 
guidance command is perpendicular to the line of sight. The 
guidance system output in xy plane (VC) may be readily 
converted to a sideslip angle () command to control system. 
There is a relationship between this speed (i.e., in y-direction) 
and sideslip angle as: 
𝛽 =
𝑉𝑛
𝑉𝑜𝑈 
 
                    (8) 
where VoU is the initial UAV airspeed. So, the follower 
UAV is guided so as to remain on the commanded LOS. As 
soon as the follower UAV is reached to the commanded circle 
around the target and stabilized, the guidance system will be 
activated to guide the aircraft such that to keep a constant 
line-of-sight angle. The LOS variables are available in both 
manned and unmanned aircraft from the use of onboard 
vision sensors. The guidance equations derived for the xy 
plane. However, similar governing equations are derived and 
used in xz plane. 
IV. MANEUVERABILITY CONSTRAINTS 
One of the basic maneuvers to make a flight smooth, and 
to correct the line of sight, is to turn around to follow the 
leader UAV. A turning flight has a couple of constraints, 
including: 1. Maximum turn rate (max), 2. Minimum turn 
radius (Rmin), 3. Maximum load factor (nmax), 4. Minimum 
and maximum airspeed (Vmin, Vmax), 5. Maximum bank angle 
(max). The following set of equations governs the relation 
between parameters of a turning flight. The load factor is a 
function of bank angle. The maximum allowable bank angle 
is limited by the load factor:

Moreover, a turn must be coordinated in order to keep the 
radius of turn constant. For the requirements of a coordinated 
turn, you may refer to references, such as [3]. The trajectory 
smoother must take into account all of these performance 
constraints to convert an initial path into a smooth trajectory.

SENSE AND AVOID 
Collision avoidance is a primary concern and a critical 
challenge in full integration of unmanned aircraft systems. 
One of the major limitations to the widespread use of 
unmanned vehicles in teaming with manned aircraft has been 
the detect-and-avoid problem. When a group of UAVs (e.g., 
3

three Reapers) are following a manned aircraft (e.g., F/A-18), 
a sense-and-avoid system will be needed to prevent collision 
between UAVs. 
In general, there are five functions required in a sense-
and-avoid system: 1. Detect the intruder/obstacle, 2. Track, 
3. Evaluate, 4. Calculation, 5. Command, 6. Execute. There 
is currently a large amount of research projects [16] being 
conducted in the area of sense-and-avoid.  In selecting a 
surveillance system, a number of factors should be evaluated. 
They are range, timeliness (update rate), field of view, 
simplicity, cost, design challenge, reliability, accuracy, size, 
weight, technology level, flexibility, and integration. 
When a conflict resolution algorithm is feasible, various 
guidance laws may be employed for a collision avoidance. 
For instance, the proportional navigation guidance with a 
proportional navigation constant less than one (i.e., N < 1). In 
such case, the UAV will be turning slower than the LOS, thus 
continuously falling behind the target (i.e., another aircraft). 
Another appropriate guidance law for a collision avoidance 
(as in a formation flight) is the line of sight guidance law. 
This law may be implemented by assuming the goal (i.e., 
target) of the follower UAV to be constantly at a desirable 
distance behind or at the side of the leader UAV. This paper 
is mainly focusing on the sense-and-avoid system of one 
UAV to follow a manned aircraft. 
VI. TEAMING LAW 
In order to begin the synthesis of the teaming law, the 
design requirements relative to both parties must be 
technically established. Based on handling qualities [14], and 
also airworthiness standards [15], the following items are 
typical design requirements to be used in the design process: 
cost, stability of the overall teaming system; output (or state 
tracking) performance; accuracy from command to response; 
overshoot; steady state error; rise time; and settling time.  In 
addition, the law must be robust with respect to aircraft type, 
communication elements, and mission. 
A fully autonomous UAV should be capable of trajectory 
tracking, defined as tracking a time-parameterized reference. 
However, for trajectory tracking there exist fundamental 
performance limitations that cannot be overcome by any 
control system. Moreover, to meet temporal specifications, 
the airspeed profile often needs to be controlled 
independently. To overcome this challenge, temporal 
constraints are not frequently imposed in path-following 
problems, and the vehicle is allowed to converge to and 
follow a path without imposing any temporal specifications. 
This will result in a smoother convergence to the path, and 
the control signals are less likely to be saturated. This 
approach must also avoid collision in multi-vehicle 
cooperative missions. 
In a path following problem, the designer is required to 
design an algorithm for a given path satisfying the given 
bounds such that the generalized error converges to a 
neighborhood of the zero. There are fundamental principles 
which govern an efficient teaming law; some of which are 
presented in this section. As the most important principle, the 
safety of the manned aircraft (in fact, the human pilot) is of 
much higher priority compared with the UAV airworthiness. 
Thus, the collision avoidance and sense or detect are two 
primary concerns to teaming success. Moreover, when the 
leader aircraft is out of sight of the follower, the follower 
aircraft must circle around to detect the leader. 
The teaming law is established based on three 
fundamental principles: 1. Keep the UAV at a line of sight, 
2. Keep UAVs at a safe distance from the leader aircraft and 
each other, 3. Each team member should fly within its safe 
flight envelope.  Sections IV, V, and VI provide the concept 
and governing equations for each principle. The guidance 
system will generate a command for the control system to 
maintain the LOS. Ref. [20] has presented a modeling and 
decentralized control for the multiple UAVs formation based 
on Lyapunov design. 
The sense-and-avoid system subsystem should make the 
necessary correction to keep the follower UAV at a safe 
distance (DTU) from leader aircraft (i.e., target) by sending the 
proper signal to the control system. 
𝐶1 ≤ 𝐷𝑇𝑈 ≤ 𝐶2   
                 (14) 
     In addition, the sense-and-avoid subsystem should make 
the necessary correction to keep the follower UAVs at a safe 
distance (DUU) from each other. 
𝐶3 ≤ 𝐷𝑈𝑈 ≤ 𝐶4   
                 (15) 
The C1, C2, C3, and C4, are constant values and are given 
by the designer. These constants are functions of many 
factors including UAV vision sensor features, the UAV 
maneuverability, weather conditions, and flight altitude. 
When the UAV is at a safe distance (DTU) from the leader 
aircraft, it must follow every flight maneuver of the leader 
aircraft. The only difference is that every maneuver is 
performed by the follower UAV after a time delay (Td), 
which is the ratio of the safe distance (DTU) to the target speed 
(UT): 
𝑇𝑑 =
𝐷𝑇𝑈
𝑈𝑇   
 
           (16) 
For two reasons of 1. UAV airworthiness, and 2. 
Successful payload application (e.g., aerial photography); the 
trajectory must be smooth. A well-designed smooth 
trajectory has ideally no abrupt and significant changes on the 
movement of the UAV. The trajectory smoother should apply 
changes to make the assigned trajectory kinematically 
feasible in terms of constraints. 
A limitation of this algorithm is that the trajectory is 
composed of a number of time-stamped curves, which 
specify the desired location of the UAV at a specified time. 
Tracking the movement state estimation of an UAV 
basically concerns inferring the latent state of interest based 
on discrete time series noisy observations. The time of 
interest may be the past (namely, smoothing), the present 
(tracking) or the future (forecasting). 
VII. SIMULATION 
Two sets of simulations are presented to demonstrate the 
efficacy of the proposed algorithm and teaming law: 1. A 
UAV is following a manned aircraft in longitudinal plane 
(i.e., xz), 2. A UAV is following a maneuvering manned 
aircraft in the xy plane (i.e., turning flight). In the first 
simulation, the UAV (as the follower) with a conventional 
configuration, has a wing span of 20 m, length of 15 m, a stall

speed of 70 knot, and a maximum speed of 250 knot. 
Moreover, the manned aircraft (as the leader), with a 
conventional configuration has a wing span of 15 m, length 
of 12 m, a stall speed of 100 knot, and a maximum speed of 
400 knot. For this formation flight, the UAV is required to 
stay behind and follow the manned aircraft and keep a safe 
distance. The distance between the UAV and the manned 
aircraft should be between 100 to 120 meters. Hence,

Next, the UAV is required to follow a random trajectory 
(as if a manned aircraft is flying/leading) to simulate a 
manned-unmanned aircraft teaming flight. For this mission, 
the UAV is required to stay behind the manned aircraft at a 
safe distance. For the initial conditions, the leader aircraft is 
flying at a constant altitude with a velocity of 130 knot. The 
follower UAV is right behind the manned aircraft with a 
distance of 200 m, and an initial velocity of 120 knot. The 
UAV performance limits and constraints are tabulated in

The A, B, C, and D matrices are generated by a matlab 
code. The four state-variables are airspeed (V), climb angle 
(), heading angle (), and sideslip angle (). Furthermore, 
four control-variables are throttle (T), elevator (E), aileron 
(A), and rudder (R). Thus, the state variables are: x = [V, , 
, ]T and input variables are u = [T, E,A,R]T. 
Four PID control laws (one for each controller) are 
employed for controlling the UAV in the three dimensional 
space. A Simulink model (Fig. 9) is developed to model all 
subsystems of both the follower UAV and the leader manned 
aircraft including LOS, navigation, guidance and control 
systems. 
A. LONGITUDINAL FLIGHT TEAMING 
The first simulation is to examine a team of one follower 
UAV and a manned leader aircraft in a 50 second longitudinal 
flight maneuver (cruise/climb/cruise). The leader aircraft will 
cruise for 20 seconds, and then, climb to 100 meters in 
another 20 seconds.  
Fig. 4 shows velocities, distance, and heights of UAV and 
manned aircraft for this teaming flight operation. The top 
Figure shows the velocities of UAV and manned aircraft, and 
the middle Figure demonstrates the heights of UAV and 
manned aircraft. The bottom Figure illustrates the distance 
between UAV and manned aircraft. As the Fig. 5 
demonstrates, the follower UAV is perfectly following the 
leader aircraft, and performs every flight operation by a delay 
of 1.5 seconds.  
As the simulation results indicate, the UAV accelerates in 
the beginning to reduce the distance of 200 m to the desired 
value of 100 m. Then, it will keep the velocity equal to the 
velocity of the leader aircraft. Due to the desired distance of 
100 m, and the velocity of the leader aircraft (130 knot), the 
time delay is about 1.5 seconds (i.e., 100/(130×0.5144)). 
Fig. 5 illustrates the elevator deflections and throttle 
settings of the UAV for this teaming flight operation. The 
initial elevator angle is -2 deg, but during the flight, it varies 
to maintain the longitudinal trim. The initial throttle setting is 
20 deg, but during the flight, it varies to maintain the forward 
velocity.

follower UAV and a manned leader aircraft in a 60 second 
turning (lateral-directional) flight. The leader aircraft will 
cruise for 20 seconds, and then, have a 360 level turn to the 
left (one full turn in 40 seconds). Fig. 6 shows control 
surfaces (i.e., elevator, aileron, and rudder) deflections and 
throttle settings of the UAV in a teaming flight for a turning 
flight maneuver.

The UAV accelerates in the beginning to reduce the 
distance of 200 m to the desired value of 100 m. Then, it will 
decelerate to keep the velocity equal to the velocity of the 
leader aircraft. 
 
Figure 8. Flight parameters of UAV and manned aircraft in a teaming flight 
for a turning flight 
 
During the turn, the UAV bank angle is about 40 degrees 
(Fig. 7), while the angle of attack is about 3 degrees. Fig. 8 
illustrates the flight path of both UAV and leader aircraft. As 
the Figure demonstrates, the follower UAV is perfectly 
following the leader aircraft, and performs every flight 
operation by a delay of 1.5 seconds. 
As the flight simulations indicate, both teaming 
operations are successful, and the UAV is tracking and 
following the manned aircraft for both longitudinal and 
direction flight maneuvers. In both flight missions, the UAV 
continuously keeps a distance of 100 m from leader aircraft 
to avoid a collision.  In all flight motions, the UAV 
maneuverability constraints were observed, and the UAV did 
not fly beyond the flight envelope.  
The simulation employs a UAV linear state-space 
dynamic model with four PID controllers. However, in 
reality, the dynamics of a UAV is nonlinear. Moreover, other

control laws (e.g., robust nonlinear) may offer better 
outcomes. The objective of the paper is to present the 
fundamentals of the teaming technique with an application. 
This technique may employ UAV nonlinear model with more 
complex control laws. Each dynamic model and each control 
law has unique advantages and disadvantages. The current 
application is simple and efficient, but may not handle 
nonlinearities.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This 
paper 
explores 
the 
manned-aircraft-leader, 
unmanned-aircraft-follower teaming architecture. There are 
various challenges and techniques for manned-unmanned 
aircraft collaboration. This paper develops the concept of 
manned-unmanned aircraft teaming, as well as teaming 
architecture. The technical requirements for a manned-
aircraft-leader, unmanned-aircraft-follower teaming are 
discussed. In addition, the teaming formulation, teaming 
laws, and sense-and-avoid system are presented. A particular 
teaming law and a guidance algorithm for manned-aircraft-
leader, unmanned-aircraft-follower teaming architecture are 
developed.  
At the end, the efficacy of the teaming architecture and 
performance of the sense-and-avoid/guidance systems are 
examined through formation flight simulations. The 
simulation results confirm that the suggested teaming law is 
applicable and efficient in following the flight team mission 
and in avoiding any obstacle. In future, the teaming law will 
be redesigned to improve the efficiency of the team. 
Moreover, the future work will include a team of three UAVs 
to follow a manned aircraft in 3d flight maneuvers.
