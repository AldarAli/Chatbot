Abstract—Ambient services have attracted attention as a 
possible ubiquitous, future intelligent infrastructure. An 
ambient service automatically provides services suited to the 
user by making sensors and computers cooperate and by 
gathering and analyzing information about each user. As such, 
ambient services are related to cyber-physical systems. 
However, in the process of managing personal information, 
ambient services are prone to various risks, such as 
information leakage. Our previous study analyzed the service 
provision and service use sides. It used the risk breakdown 
structure (RBS) and risk matrix, which are typical risk 
management methods of project management, and identified 
40 risk factors faced by ambient services and countermeasures 
thereof. However, we recognized that it was only a qualitative 
study and that a quantitative evaluation would be needed to 
make its countermeasures more practical. Hence, in this paper, 
the risk factors identified in the previous study are analyzed 
and quantitatively evaluated. Specifically, the values of the risk 
factors were calculated by using a risk formula used in the 
field of information security management systems (ISMS). On 
the basis of these values, the effect of the countermeasures 
proposed in the previous study was evaluated quantitatively. It 
was found that the countermeasures in the previous study 
could reduce their corresponding risk factors by 18% - 36%. 
The results herein can be used to promote ambient services in 
the future.

 INTRODUCTION 
Ambient services, which use sensors or wireless-
communications technology, are now attracting attention [1]. 
Ambient services offer the possibility of creating a new 
information society, as follows: 
 Computers can be used to gather information from 
sensors and monitor the user's situation. 
 Personal data can be accumulated and analyzed in order 
to provide services meeting the user’s specific needs. 
There are various merits of being able to provide services 
friendly enough to bridge the digital divide (e.g., to help 
elderly people unfamiliar with intelligent terminals) through 
cooperative functioning of computers and sensors [2]-[4]. As 
such, ambient services are related to cyber-physical systems. 
 However, an ambient service requires a user's personal 
information beforehand. Accordingly, there are risks such as 
leakage of personal information. In fact, leaks could reveal, 
for example, not only the user’s name, address, and names of 
other family members, but also his or her current position. 
Thus, confidentiality of personal information must be 
guaranteed to ensure that the ambient information society is 
safe and secure. In this regard, it is important to perform a 
risk assessment on an ambient service and to take 
countermeasures in advance against risks. In our previous 
study, we did a risk assessment of ambient services [5]. In 
particular, we used the risk breakdown structure (RBS) 
method to identify risk factors and the risk matrix method to 
analyze 
these 
factors 
[6]-[7]. 
We 
also 
drew 
up 
countermeasures to the identified risks. However, it was only 
a qualitative study, meaning that a more practical 
quantitative evaluation still needed to be undertaken.  
In this paper, we describe a quantitative evaluation of the 
risk factors of ambient services obtained in our previous 
study and the proposed countermeasures. Specifically, a risk 
value based on the formula is calculated for each risk factor 
[8]-[10]. Then, on the basis of this value, the effect of the 
countermeasures on the risks can be quantitatively evaluated. 
It is shown that the countermeasures in the previous study 
can reduce their corresponding risk factors by 18% - 36%. 
We believe that the results of this study will help to promote 
ambient services. 
Section 2 reviews the various ambient services that have 
been studied so far. In section 3, we describe our previous 
study and the present problem. Section 4 describes the 
quantitative evaluation of ambient service's risks. Section 5 
discusses related work, and section 6 is a conclusion and 
describes future work.

AMBIENT SERVICES 
In 1998, Eli Zelkha and Brian Epstein of Palo Alto 
Ventures in the U.S. crafted a presentation on the concept of 
ambient intelligence in which the future of consumer 
electronics, telecommunications, and computing is called the 
"ambient society" [11]. Since then, the idea of ambient 
services has attracted the attention of researchers as a 
potential next-generation digitized infrastructure that could 
replace the ubiquitous information society [9]. For example, 
the IT strategy of Japan has been transitioning from one of 
“u-japan” to “i-japan” [12]. Here, “u-japan” refers to a 
ubiquitous net society, whereas “i-japan” means a movement 
toward digital inclusion and innovation. The distinction 
between u-japan and i-japan is depicted in Figs. 1(1) and (2) 
[2] [12]. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2, ambient services are 
also related to cyber-physical systems [13]-[14].

PREVIOUS STUDY: RISK FACTORS AND 
COUNTERMEASURES OF AMBIENT SERVICES 
A. Risk factors of ambient services 
Ambient services for a future information society face 
many problems that could hamper their spread. In the present 
ubiquitous information society, leaks of personal information 
due to nefarious schemes or even simple mistakes are a 
serious problem. Similar problems are of concern in an 
ambient service. In particular, there are various points of 
concern that arise in the aspects of privacy protection, 
disclosure of service content, etc. 
In our previous study [5], we employed the risk 
breakdown structure (RBS) method [6], a typical risk 
management method for project management, to identify risk 
factors in ambient services. The results are shown in Table 1. 
As can be seen, the risk factors were identified from a 
comprehensive range of viewpoints. A total of 40 risk factors 
were extracted by the RBS analysis.

B. Proposed countermeasures against risk factors 
Next, we devised potential countermeasures against the 
identified risks; these are shown in Table 2. The risk matrix 
method was used to deduce these countermeasures [7]. As 
shown in Fig. 3, this method classifies risks into four kinds, 
i.e., Risk Transference, Risk Mitigation, Risk Acceptance, 
and Risk Avoidance, in accordance with their generation 
frequency and degree of incidence. Furthermore, it gives 
guidelines to draw up countermeasures. Table 2 lists the 
classification of the risk matrix methods in correspondence 
with its proposed countermeasures. 
Risks are classified in accordance with the 
degree of incidence and generation frequency. 
Countermeasures corresponding to each are as 
follows.
(c) Risk

(a) Risk 
Avoidance
(d) Risk

(a) Risk Avoidance: A risk is avoided, and 
alternatives are shown.
(b) Risk Mitigation: Decrease the risk to an 
acceptable level.
(c) Risk Transference: Transfer a risk to a 
3rd party.
(d) Risk Acceptance: Accept a risk 
unconditionally.

C. Problem of the previous study 
The previous study was qualitative; a more practical 
quantitative evaluation would be needed in order to 
implement the countermeasures it identifies. The current 
study thus is a quantitative risk assessment of the risk factors 
obtained in our previous study and its proposed 
countermeasures.  
IV. 
QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION OF AMBIENT SERVICE'S 
RISKS AND PROPOSED COUNTERMEASURES 
Here, the validity of a countermeasure is relatively 
evaluated through a quantification of the risk factors shown 
in Table 2. First, a risk formula used in the field of 
information security management systems (ISMS) is shown 
[8]-[9]. Next, an approximation for calculating a risk value 
based on our previous qualitative results is described [15]. 
Finally, a risk value for ambient services is deduced by using 
the formula and approximation. 
A. Risk formula  
Each risk value is quantified using (1), which is used in 
the field of ISMS [8]-[9]. 
 
Risk value = value of asset * value of threat 
                               * value of vulnerability                     (1) 
 
Generally, the calculation of each element of the right-
hand side of (1) is very difficult. In this paper, the following 
approximation is used to simplify these elements [15]. 
1) Approximation of the Asset Value 
Here, the asset value of (1) is approximated in terms of 
the degree of incidence in the risk matrix, as shown in Fig. 4. 
Thus, it is assumed that the asset value is the degree of 
incidence. By the way, references [9]-[10] define the degree 
of incidence as 1 (low)-5 (high). As a further approximation, 
these values are mapped in degree of incidence to a risk 
matrix [15]. As shown in Fig. 4, the degree of incidence of 
72

ICDS 2015 : The Ninth International Conference on Digital Society

 
the risk matrix is divided in two. For the sake of simplicity, 
the maximum degree of incidence (5) is approximated to the 
higher of the two divisions. Similarly, the minimum degree 
of incidence (1) is approximated to the lower of the two. 
2) Approximation of the Threat Value  
The threat value of (1) is approximated in terms of the 
generation frequency in the risk matrix, as shown in Fig. 4. 
From references [9]-[10], the generating frequency is defined 
as a range from 1 (low) to 3 (high). These values are mapped 
to the generating frequencies of the risk matrix of Fig. 4, as 
well 
as 
the 
above-mentioned 
degree-of-incidence 
approximation. That is, the maximum generating frequency 
(3) is approximated to the higher of the two divisions, and 
the minimum (1) is approximated to the lower of the two. 
3) Approximation of the Value of Vulnerability 
The vulnerability evaluation is defined in reference [9]-
[10] as well. It is defined on a three-level scale, 3 (High), 2 
(Medium), and 1 (Low), and these levels were approximated 
in accordance with the classification of the risk matrix of 
Figure 4. Here, the four domains of the figure are classified 
into three categories according to the generating frequency 
and degree of incidence, as follows. 
 Risk Avoidance: both the generating frequency and 
degree of incidence are high. It approximately 
corresponds to the highest risk classification. 
 Risk Transference and Risk Mitigation: either the 
generating frequency or the degree of incidence is high. 
It approximately corresponds to the 2nd highest risk 
classification. 
 Risk Acceptance: both the generating frequency and 
degree of incidence are low. It approximately 
corresponds to the lowest risk classification. 
In the above-mentioned classification, Risk Avoidance cases 
are approximated to 3 (High), Risk Transference and Risk 
Mitigation cases are approximated to 2 (Medium), and Risk 
Acceptance cases are approximated to 1 (Low). 
B. Calculation of risk value 
The risk value before applying countermeasures against a 
risk was calculated using (1) (see Table 3).  
Next, the risk value after applying countermeasures was 
calculated. The following two measures were chosen from  
 
(c) Risk 
Transference
(a) Risk 
Avoidance
(d) Risk 
Acceptance
(b) Risk 
Mitigation

the viewpoint of practicality: "application of assurance" and 
"third-party surveillance". These countermeasures can be 
easily implemented, although their costs may be problematic. 
Table 4 shows the resulting risk values when performing the 
countermeasures.  
Here, supposing an ideal case, vulnerability was assumed 
to be 0 as a result using the proposed countermeasures. By 
the way, supposing an actual case, these countermeasures are 
not always perfect. For example, in the case of "application 
of assurance", there may be bankruptcy of an insurance 
company though its probability is very low. In consideration 
of such a case, the vulnerability of an actual case is 
approximated to 1 (the minimum level).

C. Results of evaluation 
Table 5 summarizes the results shown in Tables 3 and 4. 
Although only the "application of assurance" and "third-
party surveillance" countermeasures were evaluated in this 
study, the table shows that the risk can be reduced by from 
18% to 36%. These results also show that a detailed 
numerical expression can treat a risk more specifically by 
quantifying it and the prospective countermeasure. 
D. Discussion 
As mentioned above, it is not realistic to perform all of 
the proposed countermeasures on the risks of Table 2. This 
study thus dealt with only two, i.e., "application of 
assurance" and "third-party surveillance," chosen on the 
basis of their practicality. In particular, the "application of 
assurance" countermeasure is being used in a Cloud user-
oriented insurance service that began in 2012 in Japan [16], 
and "third-party surveillance" is carried out by certification 
businesses of ISMS. 
However, as mentioned above, the problem of cost might 
also affect these countermeasures. Generally speaking, these 
countermeasures can become expensive because they need a 
specialist's knowledge. In the future, we will have to devise a 
verification considering such costs.

V. 
RELATED WORK 
There has been a lot of research on the security of 
ambient services. However, each study has been an 
investigation in regard to the architecture of ambient 
networks. For example, some of the research targets the 
implementation 
of 
security 
functions, 
such 
as 
the 
authentication function [17]-[19], while other research deals 
with security policies [20]. 
On the other hand, this paper is a proposal about 
comprehensive security, which also includes the user side of 
an ambient service. Such research that takes into account the 
user side will be important for not only ensuring the security 
of ambient services but also for spreading new Internet 
services, such as cyber-physical systems and the IOT (the 
Internet of Things). 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
We are interested in promoting ambient services as a 
next-generation digitized infrastructure by assessing their 
risks and proposing countermeasures. In our previous study, 
although countermeasures were developed from a qualitative 
risk assessment, their effectiveness could not be quantified. 
Hence, in this study, we performed a quantitative evaluation 
that used a risk value. It was shown that countermeasures 
labeled "application of assurance" and "third party 
surveillance" in the previous study could reduce their 
corresponding risk factors by 18% - 36%. These results 
mean that the countermeasures developed in our previous 
qualitative evaluation can be more specifically evaluated as 
to their effect by introducing a risk value. 
In the future, we will execute further improvement of 
countermeasures, and verification of cost effectiveness. 
Furthermore, we will improve the granularity of the 
quantification. In particular, it is necessary to improve the 
granularity of the risk matrix to improve the granularity of 
the quantification. Thus, whereas in this paper, a general four 
division model was used as a risk matrix, we should improve 
the model so that it has at least nine divisions in the future.
