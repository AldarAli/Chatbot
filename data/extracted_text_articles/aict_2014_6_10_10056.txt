Abstract—Ultra narrow band (UNB) transmission is a very
promising technology for low-throughput wireless sensor net-
works. This technology has already been deployed and has proved
to be ultra-efﬁcient for point-to-point communications in terms
of power-efﬁciency, and coverage area. This paper introduces
this technology and gives some insights on the scalability of
UNB for a multi-point to point network. In particular, we
present a new multiple access scheme: random frequency division
multiple access (R-FDMA) and study the impact of the induced
interference on the system performance in terms of bit error
rate and outage probability. To this aim, we propose and design
a simpliﬁed model to describe the interference impact. Thanks
to this model, we theoretically derive BER and OP expressions
for the lower, approximated and upper case. This enables us to
evaluate the performance capacity, by determining the maximum
number of simultaneous users that can be served.

INTRODUCTION
In current trend, the internet of things (IoTs) and wireless
sensor networks (WSNs) share many common constraints [1],
and thus, the communication techniques applied for WSNs
could be reused for IoTs and machine-to-machine (M2M). The
challenges are the connection of countless wireless devices and
the requirement of cost-effective, power-efﬁcient and scalable
network. In networks for applications, such as temperature
monitoring, electrical metering etc., nodes send dynamically a
small amount of data. As a consequence, a high bit rate is not
mandatory for each link. Therefore, ultra narrow-band (UNB)
transmissions can be used for such low-throughput networks.
UNB consists of sending the information occupying a
very narrow frequency band with the binary-phase-shift-keying
(BPSK) modulation. The BPSK modulation is used because
it satisﬁes power-efﬁciency, bandwidth-efﬁciency and cost-
effectiveness for low-throughput network in long range com-
munication [2]. Besides, as the occupied band is reduced, the
noise contribution is lessen at the receiver. Consequently, for a
given targeted error probability, the reception power sensitivity
is very low, enabling a very large coverage area using a single
base-station (more than 50 km in open ﬁeld).
With such an extended coverage, a large amount of source
nodes are eligible to be served and will compete for trans-
mission. Thus, the medium access control (MAC) protocol
is important to consider. The contention-free channel access
methods are not efﬁcient with respect to the low quantity of
information to be transferred and would lead to a waste of time
for protocols or synchronization issues. Contrarily, the random
access protocols are a promising solution, as they present more
ﬂexibility to manage bursty and random transmissions.
As veriﬁed in [3][4], most of the MAC studies consider that
the nodes share the same frequency channel, and focus on the
decision of the moment to transmit. Nonetheless, studies on the
multi-channel MAC also consider the frequency as a random
variable [5][6][7]. However, these studies consider predeﬁned
disjoint channels, which is not a realistic assumption in UNB
networks. Indeed, at typical transmission frequency 800 MHz,
and a typical oscillation jitter 0.5 ppm - 2 ppm, there is an
uncertainty on the frequency positioning is around 400 Hz,
which is bigger than the transmission band. As a consequence,
with UNB technology, random frequency multiple access (R-
FDMA) scheme has to be considered, as we proved in [8]. The
network behaves as if each node transmitted in a bursty way
to access to the medium, and at a frequency chosen randomly
in the available bandwidth.
Consequently, at the PHY layer, besides the effect of
classical channel impairments such as fading, shadowing ef-
fect, inter-symbol interference and noise [9][10], in R-FDMA
scheme, the system performance depends also on the carrier
frequency distribution and the corresponding interference term
resulting from physical channels overlap. While the perfor-
mance of the single link is easy to obtain, no accurate model
for multiple links has been proposed. Speciﬁcally, the behavior
of the interference induced by a large number of unconstrained
nodes (both in time and frequency) over a wide area around the
sink has not yet been studied. For certain classes of node distri-
bution, most notably Poisson point processes, and attenuation
laws, closed-form results are available for both interference
term and signal-to-interference ratios (SIR), which determine
the network performance [11][12][13][14][15]. However, as in
MAC studies, the users are either transmitting in the same
channel (i.e., with the same carrier frequency: thus highly inter-
fering), or in adjacent channels (thus barely interfering). But, in
the case of continuous R-FDMA, the frequencies are selected
in a continuous way in the total band and lead potentially to
all values, independently of the path-loss. Therefore, a new
analysis of the system performance needs to be done, to take
into account this new speciﬁcity.
In this paper, we propose to study the interference of
Random FDMA schemes in UNB network. We characterize
the system performance by understanding and modeling the
distribution of the aggregate interference power (AIP). The
others channel impairments are neglected. We propose an
approximation for the AIP and derive a closed-form of the
probability density function (PDF) of channel interference.
This enables us to provide an upper and lower bound beyond
to estimate the system performance.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II

presents the wireless network model for UNB and describes
the considered R-FDMA scheme. In Section III, we present the
theoretical interference analysis and simpliﬁed models that are
used in next section for the system performance evaluation.
Then, the estimated capacity network using the simpliﬁed
models are presented in Section IV. Finally, we conclude in
Section V.
II.
TRANSMISSION MODEL
A. Ultra Narrow Band Transmission
UNB refers to the fact that the individual bands used at
the transmission sides are very narrow compared to the whole
available bandwidth (typically 1:100). While digital or analog
data of narrow band radio system are transmitted and received
over a few kHz [9], UNB signals require around 100 Hz only,
which can be achieved with highly selective FIR ﬁlters. Such
transmissions have several beneﬁts: ﬂat fading can be assumed,
which highly simpliﬁes the system analysis and the receiver,
while a higher number of users can be supported.
UNB technology is currently deployed, e.g., in Sigfox’s
networks [16]. In these deployments, a star topology is used,
where base-stations centered in large cells receive the data
from a huge amount of source nodes spread over. Because of
the ultra narrow spectral occupation, the noise contribution is
very low (around −150 dBm at T = 290 K). So, contrary
to classical deployments, such technology enables an excep-
tionally large-scale wireless connection thanks to the ability
to successfully demodulate an extremely low received power
signal (-142 dBm). These advantages allow data transmission
in highly constrained environments where former technologies
cannot operate and a possibility to cover a very large area with
a very small number of base stations, reducing network man-
agement and deployment fees of several orders of magnitude.
B. R-FDMA Scheme Deﬁnition
In a random access frequency network, four main problems
must be considered: the asynchronicity access of node in the
wireless medium, randomness both in time and frequency
domain and lack of contention based protocols. To illustrate
the system behavior, a toy-example is schematized in Fig.1.
It represents the time and frequency use of the channel for 4
active users.
The randomness in time domain has an impact on the
number of users N that will be active at the same time. This
value depends on several parameters: the number of possible
users in the cell, the length (in time) of the packet to transmit,
and the periodicity of the transmission. We present our results
as a function of k = N − 1 the number of interfering users.
Furthermore, the asynchronicity permits to suppress the
trafﬁc overload needed for synchronization, but leads to vary-
ing interference levels during the transmission of a given
packet, as packets do not start (and stop) at the same time.
In order to simplify the analysis discussed in this work, we
will not evaluate the performance evolution during the whole
packet transmission, but only at a given point in time. For
example, in Fig.1, at t = t0 only 3 users among the 4 users
are transmitting.
The randomness in frequency domain has an impact on the
position of each active users carrier in the total band. Thus, it
affects the interference suffered by a given user, which depends
on the spacing δf between the users carrier frequency and the
interferers one. The Random FDMA schemes could be divided
into two kinds of frequency randomness [8] continuous and
Figure 1: Example of temporal & spectral repartition of users.
discrete. In the discrete case, the carriers are chosen at random
in a discrete and pre-deﬁned subset of frequencies. But, in
order to take into account the carrier imprecision due to the
jitter, we consider only continuous random frequency division
multiple access, where the carriers can be chosen at random
in the continuous available frequency band. In this case, from
the receiver point of view (i.e., on base-station side), the
monitored bandwidth is ﬁlled from time to time with a set of
signals of interest occupying a small amount of total spectrum
and centered around unpredictable carrier frequencies. Thus,
in order to handle demodulation, efﬁcient software deﬁned
radio algorithms have been designed to analyze the total
band, determine transmitter activity and retrieve data they
are transmitting. These algorithms are currently deployed in
SigFoxs network, and do not fall in the scope of this paper.
The lack of contention based protocols implies that each
user is transmitting without any knowledge of carrier frequen-
cies being used in the cell. Thus, this induces interference
(when at least 2 users are transmitting at the same moment and
there is an overlap between the individual transmission bands).
For example, in Fig.1, the green user starts transmitting even
if the red one is already using the band in common.
Furthermore, we should note that R-FDMA allows the
use of transmitters whose frequency is unconstrained (except
for being in the transmission bandwidth). In practice, the
randomness in frequency domain is easily done: each node
has its own transmission frequency, which it not controlled
by the network, but deﬁned by the node components (elec-
trical components an oscillator jitter), and may vary naturally
(depending on different parameters such as temperature and
age of the device). Thus, factory constraints are relaxed, and
the network will not be sensible to temperature variations
and other environmental parameters that can affect the carrier.
Thus, cheaper nodes can be used.
As a consequence, R-FDMA is promising for smart meter-
ing where a massive amount of devices have to be connected
to the Internet, provided that the randomness does not highly
degrade the performances.
C. System Mathematical Model And Parameters
As described in the previous section, the main characteristic
of the considered network using R-FDMA at a given point
of time is that each active user is transmitting at a carrier
133

frequency randomly chosen in a given band. As a consequence,
interference contribution is non-controlled and can lead to
transmission errors. Consider a multiple access channel with
N = k + 1 active transmitters (note that N is much smaller
than the number of nodes that are actually in the cell). The
total received signal at the base-station can be expressed as:
r(t) =
k+1
X
i=1
si(t) · g(fi, t) ⊗ hi(t) + n(t)
(1)
where si(t), ∀i ∈ [1, . . . , k + 1] are the BPSK symbols sent
by the active user i, g(fi, t) the impulse response of the
emission FIR ﬁlter (centered at fi); hi(t) is the path-loss of
the corresponding link, and n(t) is an additive white Gaussian
noise with zero mean, and whose variance is σ2.
For the sake of simplicity in this analysis, we consider
that hi(t) = δ(t), ∀i ∈ [1, . . . , k + 1]. This corresponds to
the worst case where all users are at the same distance of
the base station and experience the same ﬂat channel. At the
base station, the received signal is analyzed to track possible
transmissions in the total band (BW), and ﬁltered at the desired
frequency. Without loss of generality, we consider in this paper
that the desired user is #1. The signal used for data recovery
is thus:
r
′(t) = r(t) ⊗ g(f1, t)
(2)
=
k+1
X
i=1
si(t) · g(fi, t) ⊗ g(f1, t) + n(t) ⊗ g(f1, t)
(3)
To evaluate the system performances, we use the signal to
interference plus noise ratio (SINR), which is expressed as:
SINR =
Ps
Ntot + PI
(4)
where Ps is the received power of the desired user, PI the
aggregate interference, and Ntot the noise contribution. These
powers are estimated at a given time, and normalized with
respect to Ps
= |G(f1, t)|2 with G(f1, t) the frequency
response of the FIR ﬁlter. The value of PI depends on the
spacing between the carriers frequency, and its estimation will
be described in the next section. We deduce the bit error rate
(BER) of the BPSK transmission from the SINR as follow:
BER(SINR) = Q(
√
SINR)
(5)
A data transmission is considered successful if the received
BER is below a predeﬁned threshold β = 10−3, otherwise,
the data are considered lost. Thus, we consider the outage
probability (OP) being expressed:
Pr(OP) = Pr(BER ≥ β) = Pr(BER ≥ 10−3)
(6)
The simulation results shown in Section III and IV, the
BER and OP are obtained with respect to (5), (6) (with a
noise power 100 dB under the signal of interest).
III.
THEORETICAL INTERFERENCE ANALYSIS
As described in Section II, the R-FDMA scheme solves a
waste of communication resources for WSNs where the users
send a short message. However, it leads to interference that
must be quantiﬁed. Therefore, the goal of this study is to
analyze the aggregated interference power (AIP) and propose
the simpliﬁed model for UNB network based on R-FDMA
scheme.
Figure 2: Behavior of interference vs frequency difference δf.
A. Modelization of a single interferer contribution
In the single interferer case, we consider the interference
power created by a unique interferer. We assume that there
are only N = 2 active users using R-FDMA scheme (i.e., the
useful signal and k = 1 interfering signal). The interference
power can be derived at a given time by multiplying the
frequency responses of the useful signal and interfering signal.
PI(t) =| G(f1, t) · G(f2, t) |
(7)
In (7), the only parameter that will inﬂuence PI(t) is the
relative frequency positioning δf = |f1 − f2| between the
carriers used by the active users. Therefore, we model the
interference level as a function of the frequency shift between
the 2 active users δf = |f1 − f2|:
PI(t) =| G(f1, t) · G(f2, t) |= P(δf, t)
(8)
From now on, as we focus on the interference at a given
sample time normalized to Ps, we neglect the time variable
in the mathematical expressions. In Fig.2, we represent the
interference evolution as a function of the frequency difference
(8). The blue curve corresponds to the interference in a realistic
case. We can observe that the interference is lowered if
the frequency difference δf of two carriers is large enough.
However, we should not neglect the interference caused for
high δf. Indeed, in the case of a high interfering number,
the interference will aggregate, and can lead to errors. On
the contrary, a unique user will cause a signiﬁcant amount
of interference only if δf is very small, as the ﬁlter is very
selective. Thus, we can observe there are 2 main areas, whose
transition occurs around 200 Hz, depending on the considered
criterion. In the ﬁrst area, i.e., for high δf, the interference level
is low, and mainly concentrated around -90 dB. Contrarily,
in the second area, i.e., for low δf, the interference level is
more important (up to 0 dB when using the same frequency),
and almost uniformly distributed. Nevertheless, the considered
band is much larger than 200 Hz (at least 12 kHz), and thus,
at this scale, the interference level can also be approximated
by a constant.
Therefore, we model the interference by a rectangular
function:
I(δf) =
§ Imax
for | δf |≤ △/2,
Imin
for | δf |> △/2.
(9)
where △ corresponds to the width of δf that creates high inter-
ference level. The ﬁrst line corresponds to low δf interferers,
and the second one to high δf interferers.
The simpliﬁed model can be used to deﬁne the upper
and the lower bound of the interference pattern. For the
upper bound, the maximum level can be easily identiﬁed in
Fig.2, and is set to the maximum interference power i.e.,
Imax up(δf = 0) = 0 dB. On the contrary, the minimum level

k = 100 interferers, for BW = 12 kHz.
Imin up and the width △up can take many values, but should
verify:
Imin up = P(△up)
(10)
For the lower bound, the known characteristic is the min-
imum level, which is set to Imin low = −90 dB (we neglect
the lower interference values as they occur with a very low
probability), whereas the other two parameters are jointly are
jointly deﬁned such as:
Imax low = P(△low)
(11)
We can also deﬁne an approximated model with uncon-
strained parameters (△, Imin, Imax). We consider that Imin =
−90 dB, which is the most frequent interference value, the
optimal rectangular model is deﬁned by the couple (△, Imax).
The bound and approximation model parameters are derived
in the next section.
B. Modelization of a multi-interferers contribution
As in practice, the network will support more than 2 active
users in practice, we further our study by considering more
users based on R-FDMA scheme and in a realistic deploy-
ment. In this section, we aim at quantifying the cumulative
interference and its inﬂuence on the system performance.
To characterize the interference statistics, we used a Monte
Carlo simulation with number of repetitions: 104, for a network
containing up to k = 100 interferers (N = 101 active nodes),
deployed randomly over a continuous bandwidth of BW = 12
kHz. For the sake of simplicity, we suppose that the desired
user is transmitting in the middle of the total band. Besides
simplicity, this case corresponds to the worst case. Indeed,
at this central frequency, the desired user will suffer from
statistically more interference than any other active user. This
is due to the fact that the average δf is smaller in this case.
We have evaluated the aggregate interference power (AIP) and
observe its Probability Density Function (PDF) distribution.
Simulation results are presented in Fig.3.
We can verify that if the number of nodes is small, the
power level of AIP remains very small and is mostly situated
in the interval from -60 to -90 dB. Contrarily, when the
number of node increases, the AIP gradually converges to
the left, near 0 dB (which corresponds to δf = 0 for a
single interferer case) and more. In fact, when the number
of active users increases, the probability that at least one
user chooses a frequency close to the receiver of interest is
also increased. This contribution will dominate the others, and
lead to a high level of interference. Finally, we can point
out that the interference evolution is not trivial. Indeed, we
can note 2 areas of interest (-90 dB and 0 dB) where the
probability is dominant. Therefore, as shown in Fig.2 and
Fig.3, the AIP cannot be approximated by a classical model,
such as a Gaussian approximation for example, because, it
does not take into account both main lobe for small δf, and
side lobe for large δf, even for a unique interferer. But, as the
interference is difﬁcult to model exactly, we have chosen to
use the rectangular model, to estimate the network AIP.
In (9), as the interference created by a unique user is
supposed to take only 2 values, we distinguish 2 kinds of
interferers:
– Those whose frequency shift is | δf |≤ △/2 and create
interference level Imax. We call nL the number of such users.
The probability for an user to be in this category is p =
△
BW .
– The others, which create interference level Imin. We call
nP = k − nL the number of interferers in this case.
Thus, the total aggregate interference power Itot created
by k active interferes is:
Itot(k, nL) = nL · Imax + (k − nL) · Imin
(12)
Besides, the probability to have exactly nL users among
the k (∀nL ∈ [0, 1, ..., k]), that creates an interference of Imax
is:
Pr(NL = nL) = CnL
k
· pnL · (1 − p)(k−nL)
(13)
Thus, from (4), (5) and (6), the BER and OP can be
obtained with:
BER(k) =
nL=k
X
nL=0
Pr(NL = nL) · Q
Ê
Ps
Itot(k, nL)

(14)
OP(k) =
X
nL/Itot(nL)>β
Pr(NL = nL)
(15)
The (14) and (15) can be used for whichever rectangular
model, in general, for the upper and lower bound, and for the
approximation in particular. By using root mean square (RMS),
we have evaluated the RMSBER and RMSOP as a function
of △ for the lower and the upper bound. Then, we have
deduced consecutively the values Imin up and Imax low with
(10) and (11). Indeed, the results using the simpliﬁed model
have been compared to simulation ones (with RMS metric
performed in the logarithmic scale so as to ensure a good
approximation for whichever magnitude degree) to determine
the best width △ and the corresponding interference level. This
study has been done for several bandwidths (BW).
As shown in Fig.4, the minimal RMS is independent of
BW. For upper bound, the optimal width is obtained for
△up = 440Hz in term of both BER and OP. On the other
hand, for lower bound, the optimal width in term of BER and
OP will be respectively △low = 100 Hz and △low = 220 Hz.
The obtained upper and lower bounds models are represented
in Figure2.
We can also use these equations to empirically evaluate
(△, Imin, Imax) that are the most accurate from (9). We have
evaluated the RMSBER and RMSOP as a function of the
couple (△, Imax). We have compared (with log-scale RMS
metric) the BER and OP obtained with the theoretical model,
and by simulation for BW = 12 kHz. Results obtained with
a sampling precision of 1Hz and 0,005 dB are presented in
Fig.5 and Fig.6. We can observe that, the width △ has little
impact on the BER accuracy, while Imax has little impact on

bandwidth length.

the OP accuracy. Thus, regarding the OP criterion in Fig.6, we
get the best approximation for △ = 232Hz. On the contrary,
in Fig.5, we identiﬁed Imax = −1.77 dB as the best one for
BER. Therefore, the couple (△ = 232 Hz, Imax = −1.77 dB)
is considered as the optimal one (plotted in Fig.2) for both OP
and BER approximation.
We validate the accuracy of our models (lower bound,
upper bound and approximation) by considering a higher
bandwidth, i.e., BW = 96 kHz. We present in Fig.7 and Fig.8
the comparison between the average BER and OP obtained
by simulation, and obtained with our theoretical models. We
can ﬁrst verify the accuracy of the lower and upper bounds as
they provide a coherent interval for the capacity. Besides, we
can note that the lower bound obtained with the BER criterion
is equally pertinent for the BER and OP evaluation. On the
contrary, the one obtained with the OP criterion is tight for
the OP, but much too loose for the BER. Finally, we can
observe that the approximation model is very accurate, even
for a higher bandwidth (and thus a higher supported number
of users). Thus the proposed models are consistent.
IV.
ESTIMATED CAPACITY NETWORK
In this section, we estimate the system capacity in terms
of the maximum number of users that can be simultaneously
active; while verifying the targeted BER or OP constraint. We
report in Table I, Table II and Table III, the system capacity

using the bounds and optimal model, and compare them with
results obtained by simulation.
We can further conﬁrm the accuracy of the bounds and
optimal model. Besides, obviously, the capacity increases with
the available bandwidth, and the targeted BER. However, we
can note that the evolution is not linear. Indeed, e.g., when
the bandwidth is increased by 8 (from 12 kHz to 96 kHz),
the capacity is increased by 7.3 (from 6 to 44). Indeed, it is
different to distribute N users in a B total bandwidth than

number of users, some insigniﬁcant interference contributions
sum up to a signiﬁcant level.
Finally, we can estimate that, for a BER = 10−3 and
BW = 96 kHz, the network is able to serve 10 simultaneous
users. Considering average transmission duration of 1 second,
the system will be able to handle around 864 000 transmissions
per day, which corresponds for a 50 km radius to a density of
110 nodes per km2: i.e., 3 times the USA population density.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have studied a new technology based
on UNB transmission, considered for IoTs networks. This
technology is used jointly with R-FDMA scheme, which, to
the best of our knowledge, has not been studied yet in the
literature in terms of interference and capacity. To evaluate
the interference impact, we have considered the BER and
the OP of the system in the R-FDMA case, where the users
are randomly distributed. We have studied the inﬂuence of
aggregate interference power for such networks. To this aim,
we have presented a rectangular model, used to derive lower
bound, upper bound, and approximated model of the system.
We have shown the accuracy of the models. Then, thanks to
their simplicity, we have theoretically evaluated the system
performance (in term of BER and OP), and the capacity of
the network in terms of possible number of active users. Thus,
this study is a ﬁrst step in the analysis of the promising UNB
networks, can be furthered by considering the case where the
received powers are different among the users, to take into
account the cell geometry.
