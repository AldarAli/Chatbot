Abstract—In this work, the conductance behavior of tungsten 
trioxide based chemoresistive ozone sensors under ultra violet 
illumination was investigated. The tungsten trioxide sensitive 
layers were deposited on a SiO2/Si substrate by reactive radio 
frequency magnetron sputtering with several Argon / Oxygen 
ratios. The detection principle is based on a change in the 
conductance of the semiconductor oxides when ozone is present 
around the surface. We demonstrate the influence of Argon / 
Oxygen during the deposition of the sensitive layer, on ozone 
detection at 50°C under light illumination. The sensor shows 
good sensitivity to ozone, with a stable baseline, fast response 
and recovery time. These results are promising for the detection 
of ozone at low temperature.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Tungsten trioxide (WO3) sensitive layers have been 
shown to be an effective material for ozone (O3) detection 
[1]. Metal oxides present good sensitivity, long term stability 
and low cost production. However, their high operating 
temperature (around 280°C) is a drawback, as it increases 
their power consumption, affects the ageing of the materials 
and compromises their use on flexible substrates. 
Nevertheless, some metal oxides, such as zinc oxide (ZnO) 
or WO3, exhibit photo-catalytic behavior [2]-[3] which can 
lower their optimal detection temperature by supplying them 
with energy in the form of Ultra Violet (UV) light radiation. 
This work is dedicated to experimental detection of ozone at 
50°C under UV illumination using a WO3 sensing layer. The 
paper is structured as follows: in Section II, we will describe 
the sensors and the experimental set up; then, in Section III, 
the sensing results will be discussed based on our 
measurements in dark and under UV light illumination in 
ozone environments. Finally, a conclusion is drawn in Section 
IV. 
II. 
DESCRIPTION OF APPROACH AND TECHNIQUES 
This section is composed of two parts: one section is 
dedicated to the sensing film fabrication, while the other is 
devoted to the measurement system set-up. 
A. Gas sensors 
The gas sensor is based on a transducer made of Ti/Pt 
interdigitated electrodes (5 and 100 nm thick, respectively) 
spaced by 50 μm (Figure 1) deposited on Si/SiO2 substrate. 
The WO3 sensitive layer, about 50 nm thick, was deposited 
by reactive Radio Frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering. The 
Argon (Ar) / Oxygen (O2) ratio was changed as shown in 
Table I. All samples were deposited at a power of 115 W 
under a total pressure of 3.10-3 mbar.

All these samples, named EC, EB and ED series in our 
experiments, were then annealed in ambient air at a 
temperature of 400°C for two hours to improve their nano-
crystallization and stability.

The film structures were determined by X-Ray 
Diffraction (XRD) with a Philip’s X’Pert MPD equipment  
(l = 1.54 Å). Chemical composition measurement was 
performed using Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy 
(EDS) on a Zeiss GeminiSEM 500 ultra high resolution Field 
Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM). An 
Energy dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDAX) Octane Silicon 
Drift Detector (129 eV energy resolution for Manganese) was 
used at 5 kV with a magnificence of 350 and 10k. 
B. Experimental Setup for Sensor Characterization 
Our test bench consists of a gas generation unit, a test 
chamber with a Light Emitting Diode (LED UV5TZ-390-30) 
and a Keithley Model 2450 Source Measure Unit (SMU) 
(Keithley, U.S.A.) monitored by a homemade LabVIEW 
program. The gas sensing properties were investigated by

measuring the microsensor resistance in a closed thermo-
regulated test chamber. The experimental set-up allows the 
sensors to be tested in dry air and diluted gas. Ozone is 
produced with an O3 generator model 165 from Thermo 
Environmental Instruments and its concentration is measured 
using an O3 analyzer model 49 from Thermo Environmental 
Instruments. In all experiments, the gas flow rate was 
maintained at 500 sccm (Standard Cubic Centimeters per 
Minute). For each concentration, the sensors were exposed to 
the gas for 60 s and their temperature was kept constant at 
50◦C. The distance between the UV LED and the microsensor 
was kept constant to allow a 1.5 mW/cm2 measured power 
density at the sensor surface. Figure 2 shows a sensor under 
irradiation from a UV LED.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
The experiments were conducted in a laboratory 
environment. In this section, we will discuss our 
morphological and electrical results. 
A. Chemical Composition 
The XRD diffractograms of WO3 films (Figure 3) show 
the presence of crystalline layers with monoclinic phase WO3 
[4].  
 
Figure 3. Comparison of WO3 diffractograms with reference test platform 
(*) using l = 1.54Å (Philip’s X’Pert MRD). 
A diffractogram was performed on the test platform with the 
interdigitated electrodes (Ti/Pt) deposited on SiO2/Si 
substrate without the trioxide layer, to be used as a reference 
diffractogram. The diffractogram comparison of the samples 
with the metal oxide layers demonstrates the presence of two 
grain orientation families, identified on the figure 3 with the 
symbols # and o. All the diffraction peaks are compatible 
with the monoclinic structure of WO3. But it seems that 
depending on the Ar/O2 ratio used during the sputtering, the 
growth of grains with different orientations are favored. 
Particularly, the lowest oxygen ratio sample (EC) does not 
present the peaks identified on the figure as #. Three EDX 
measurements were carried out on the same sample at two 
different magnifications: x350 on WO3 on three different 
electrodes and x10,000 on WO3 on one electrode. The 
analyzed areas were 3 µm by 3 µm. To avoid the SiO2 
interferences on our WO3 chemical measurements, 
preliminary tests were performed on platinum electrodes. A 
5 kV electron beam energy was used for all the analysis.

measurements show that for this electron beam energy and 
100 nm thick platinum electrode, no silicon element was 
detected. Thus, by performing our measurements on WO3 
with a platinum electrode underneath, no incertitude was 
induced by the SiO2 substrate. When analyzing these results, 
no clear variation was observed on the chemical composition 
of the films for both magnifications. The WO3 material 
maintains a near-stoichiometric composition over the whole 
deposition range with a ratio of nearly 77%O and 23%W 
(standard 
deviation 
of 
0.5%). 
Auger 
electron 
spectroscopy (AES) analyses carried out in another study [5] 
demonstrated that the O/W ratio can indeed be altered by 
varying the oxygen content of the plasma, but that after 
annealing in air, the disparities tend to disappear. Thus, 
whatever the oxygen value used in our plasma, a quasi-
stoichiometric ratio was observed. These results are in 
agreement 
with 
literature 
[5]-[8] 
where 
X-
Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analyses of WO3 
layers deposited under several conditions show that the 
chemical composition of WO3 remains stoichiometric unless 
other chemical species are used during the annealing. 
B. Gas Detection under UV illumination 
Semiconducting metal oxides are the most commonly 
used sensing materials for gas detection. They are cheap, 
stable, highly sensitive and need low maintenance.  
Nevertheless, energy activation is required to facilitate the 
chemical reaction on their surface and induce a change in 
carrier concentration upon exposure to gas molecules. Thus, 
their electrical conductance changes. In this work, we used a 
light activation to study the WO3 photocatalytic properties at 
50°C. The effect of visible and UV lights on the detection 
properties of WO3 can be described as the result of two 
mechanisms. The first one occurs at low photon energies. 
Oxygen ions (O2-) are chemically bound to the surface with 
the free charge carriers of the material, electrons. This binding

is of the order of 1.50 eV. Therefore, when the WO3 surface 
is irradiated by a photon source with an energy higher than 
1.50 eV, oxygen species capture the photons and desorption 
occurs, releasing charge carriers and increasing the 
conductance of the material. This increase is generally small 
(drop is less than a factor of 10 in the resistance) and does not 
allow for rapid and repeatable detection. The second 
mechanism is added when the photon energies are higher than 
the indirect band gap of WO3, of the order of  2.6-2.8 eV: the 
creation of electron-hole pairs. These pairs increase the 
density of free charge carriers and participate in the desorption 
of oxygen atoms [9]-[11]. A large increase in conductivity is 
achieved (about a factor of 102 – 103) and a large proportion 
of surface sites are unoccupied. Upon injection of ozone into 
the test chamber, the reactive gas molecules begin to occupy 
the free surface sites and bind to the free charge carriers, 
creating a depletion zone that increases the resistivity. Figure 
4 shows a UV LED spectrum produced by our Avantes 
spectrometry equipment at room temperature (25°C). 
 
Figure 4. UV LED Spectrum 
We observe a broad peak centered at 393 nm 
corresponding to the UV LED used in our experiments. The 
maximum intensity is reached around 393 nm which 
corresponds to a maximum energy of 3.16 eV calculated with 
formula (1): 
E = h*c / l  
 
 
(1) 
where h is the Planck constant, c the light speed and l the 
wavelength. 
Thus, according to the literature, there is both desorption 
of oxygen and creation of electron-hole pair. This hypothesis 
was confirmed by the decrease in resistance when our sensor 
was exposed to UV light. 
The normalized response of the sensor is defined in (2) as 
the ratio of the sensor resistance under the O3 exposure to the 
sensor resistance in dry air: 
 
R = Rgas / Rair  
 (2) 
where Rair is the sensor resistance through dry airflow and Rgas 
the sensor resistance in the presence of O3. 
Figure 5 shows the detection properties towards O3 of the 
EB sample made with an Ar/O2 gas ratio 1:1, as generally 
reported in the literature [7], [12] under UV light and 
darkness.  
 
Figure 5. Ozone detection, at an operating temperature of 50°C, in dark and 
under UV illumination for a WO3 film prepared with a 1:1 Ar/O2 ratio. 
In darkness and at low temperature maintained at 50°C, 
the optimal conditions for chemisorption reaction are not 
reached, so no adsorption or desorption of oxygen species 
(O2- or O3) can occur. The “Dark Exposure” curve shows a 
constant baseline and no response is observed for all ozone 
exposures of 30 ppb, 65 ppb and 120 ppb, respectively. Under 
UV illumination and at 50°C, desorption of O2- by absorption 
of UV photon occurs and electron-hole pairs are created, thus 
chemical reaction becomes possible. The “UV Exposure” 
plot indicates a normalized response of 1.89, 2.10 and 2.25 
reached for 60 s ozone exposure at 30 ppb, 65 ppb and 120 
ppb, respectively. Stabilization was incomplete for response 
and recovery as chemisorption remains a slow process and 
ten minutes were generally required [9], [13]. 
Figure 6 illustrates the sensors responses to 30 ppb ozone 
for several Ar/O2 gas ratios in the sputtering deposition 
process.

The EB sample made with an Ar /O2 gas ratio of 1:1 
shows a response of 1.89 for an ozone concentration of 30 
ppb. By increasing the oxygen content during the plasma 
process, the sensor response to ozone is found to decrease, 
and a normalized response of 1.35 is achieved for 30 ppb of 
O3. On the contrary, by decreasing the oxygen content, the 
sensor response to ozone increases, and a normalized 
response of 5.10 is achieved for 30 ppb of O3.This trend is 
maintained for other ozone concentrations as show in figure 
7.  
 
Figure 7. Response of  three sensors to ozone concentration variation, 
under UV illumination at an operating temperature of 50°C. 
The lowest oxygen ratio sample has the highest 
normalized response to ozone of 5.10, 7.04 and 7.90, which 
is promising for ozone detection at low temperature, while 
the highest argon ratio sample has the lowest normalized 
response of 1.35, 1.47 and 1.59 for 30 ppb, 65 ppb and 120 
ppb, respectively. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This work reports our preliminary results on ozone 
sensors, based on a WO3 sputtering layer, operating at 50°C 
under UV light detection. Our results demonstrated that the 
Ar/O2 ratio used during the layer deposition did not affecting 
the chemical stoichiometry after annealing at 400°C during 2 
h. However, XRD measurements showed that several 
preferential grain orientations were formed during the layer 
fabrication depending on the Ar/O2 ratio during the WO3 
sensitive layer deposition. Our results demonstrate that the 
choice of the best Ar/O2 ratio during the WO3 sensitive layer 
fabrication will allow to optimize the ozone detection at low 
temperature by light illumination. Complementary XPS 
measurements will be performed to understand the influence 
of oxygen vacancy on our results.
