Abstract—Many new technologies claiming to support indepen-
dent living and prolonged possibilities of aging in place have
been developed. To support independent living and increase the
sense of safety and security both for the elderly themselves and
for their relatives, the technologies have to be easily adaptable
to match the divergent users personal expectations and needs.
The study reported in this paper was conducted as seven case
studies where a sensor network was deployed in homes of people
with a self-perceived memory decline. We describe problems
related to adaptive personalization of such technology in real
settings and discuss what consequences these problems may have
for the elderly people’s and their relatives willingness to use
the technology. Our results indicate that a lack of sufﬁcient
possibilities to adaptive personalization of the system makes it
difﬁcult to address individual user’s expectations and needs. This,
in turn, leads to a decreased trustworthiness of the technology
and a risk of unwillingness to use the technology.
Keywords–Ambient Assisted Living; Adaptive Personalization;
Safety; User Expectations.

INTRODUCTION
Being able to feel safe and secure are perhaps two of
the fundamental requirements for enabling elderly to continue
living independently. In this respect, safety and security involve
physical, psychological and existential aspects on well-being,
all of which are fundamental when coping with daily life.
Associated with feeling unsafe and insecure are feelings such
as: worry, fear, anxiety and perhaps even panic according to the
Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare [1]. For special
groups, such as the elderly, their ability to stay independent
at home does not only depend on whether they feel safe and
secure at home. It is equally important that the social networks
around them, e.g., family, spouses or caregivers feel that their
loved ones are safe and secure. Aspects such as safety and
security may affect the social structures (roles) in families over
time. Children may become caregivers who make decisions on
behalf of their parents, a role which may be stressful for the
family caregivers [2]. Taking the role as a family caregiver is
also associated with a need to balance the care giving with
other activities, e.g., work and leisure [2]. Therefore, the new
role may have an effect on psychosocial well-being [3], but
also have negative consequences on the caregivers themselves,
e.g., sleep disturbances [4] and increased blood pressure [5].
Many new technologies claiming to support independent
living and prolonged possibilities of aging in place make use
of sensor networks and/or mobile robotic telepresence [6].
While most of them can be installed with little changes in
the home infrastructure, little is known about whether they
lead to an increased sense of safety and security, either for the
elderly themselves, or for their family caregivers. Technologies
which cannot deliver an increased sense of safety and security
will likely have no large impact on the growing market of
assistive technologies for an elderly population. Therefore, it
is of interest to increase the knowledge on what affects the
sense of safety and security. Commonly, commercial sensor
networks offer solutions such as alarms, reminders of turning
electrical devices off (e.g., the stove or the coffee brewer), but
sensor networks can also be used to monitor activities [7][8].
Yet, a key question is whether the solutions support adaptive
personalization and whether they can support independent
living and aging in place and whether they increase the elderly
people’s and the family caregivers’ sense of safety and security.
This paper describes the ﬁrst step in a longitudinal study
aiming at developing a methodology to measure how an
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) affects
the sense of safety and security. In the study, we apply the
methodology to study how a sensor network deployed in homes
of seven people with self-perceived memory decline affects not
only these people’s but also their spouses’ perceived safety
and security. The longitudinal study can be divided into three
main steps: (1) ﬁnding test persons who are suitable for testing
the system and deploying the sensor network, (2) evaluation
while living with the sensor network, and (3) evaluation after
the sensor network has been removed. The results presented in
this paper focus on the results from the ﬁrst step and describes
the expectations and the proﬁles of each of the users. We ﬁnd
that sensor network solutions need to be highly adaptive to the
user’s personal needs.
The paper is structured as follows. Section II provides
a description of the sensor network deployed in this study.
Section III outlines the methodology used during the ﬁrst step
of the longitudinal study. Information is provided on how the
participants were selected, how they were informed about the
project and the sensor network, how each deployment was
prepared and how the deployments were made. The results
of the ﬁrst step in the longitudinal study are presented in
Section IV. Finally, a discussion and conclusion is provided
in Section V.

SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
The sensor network deployed in this study is Abilia’s
Homebasic [9], which is a “safety and security” package for
those who need a combination of time and memory support,
environmental monitoring and alarm functionalities. Home-
basic is an advanced cognitive support that aims to support
independent living and increase the possibility to age in place.
The individuals targeted have a cognitive decline and may be
in need of orientation in time, support and structure of daily
tasks, reminders for handling electronics in the home (e.g., the
stove, coffee brewer, lamps) and reminders when leaving the
home. The cognitive decline supported by Homebasic ranges
from developmental disorders to Alzheimer.
The core of the system is the digital calendar, Memoplanner
(MP, see Figure 1(a)). The MP is a touch-PC that can be hung
on the wall or placed in a guitar stand. It is recommended that
MP is installed in a room in which the user spends a lot of
time during day-time. The MP has several functions:
F1
Information of time.
F2
Calendar to provide support and structure of daily
tasks. The user (or a remote user) can add new
events to the calendar. Each event can consist of
sub events.
F3
Reminders about upcoming events. These can also
be sent as SMS reminders.
F4
Skype
The MP connects to the Internet via WiFi or a LAN-
connection to a Vera Gateway [10]. Included in Homebasic are
also a number of sensors which are connected to the gateway
using the Z-Wave protocol [11]. The MP warns the user with
an image and a pre-recorded instruction or a reminder when a
sensor is triggered. The solution is marketed as being easy to
use, easy to install in all kinds of homes and to be re-used in
other homes.
The sensors and actuators included in Homebasic are
two motion sensors (see Figure 1(b)), one on/off sensor (see
Figure 1(c)), one oven/stove sensor, from here on called stove
sensor, one door sensor (see Figure 1(d)), and a lamp actuator.

ner
(b) Motion sen-
sor
(c) On/off sen-
sor
(d) Door sensor
Figure 1: Examples of Abilia Homebasic components.
The manufacturer recommends that each sensor is plugged
to an electric socket rather than running on battery. This means
that the stove sensor needs to be connected not only to the
stove’s electric cord but also to a standard electric socket. Here
follows a description of what functions that are provided using
the sensors:
A. Kitchen
Situated in the kitchen are typically one motion sensor, one
stove sensor and one on/off sensor. The MP issues a warning
when:
F5
The stove is on but no motion has been detected
in the kitchen during the past x minutes.
F6
A chosen electronic device, e.g., a coffee brewer
is left turned on during x minutes.
B. Bedroom
Aiming at preventing falls, one motion sensor and one
lamp actuator are situated in the bedroom. The motion sensor
detects when the user places his/her feet beside the bed. When
detecting motion, a lamp is turned on automatically [F7], either
for a chosen period of time or until the user turns the lamp off.
In case there is no need for an on/off sensor in the kitchen, the
sensor can also be used to turn on an additional lamp anywhere
in the home.
C. Hallway
Typically, the included door sensor is placed on the en-
trance door. It can be used to detect that the door has been
opened and issue a warning via the MP if:
F8
The stove is on.
F9
The door is opened. This function can be used
with several options, either it can be always ac-
tive and remind the user to, e.g., lock the door.
Alternatively, it can be active during a speciﬁc
time of the day and tell the user that it is not an
appropriate time to go out.
D. System summary
The functionalities provided by Abilia Homebasic can also
be divided into ﬁve categories (sensor-based reminders, sensor-
based actuation, calendar-based reminders, calendar visualiza-
tion and communication). Table I summarizes the functional-
ities of Abilia’s Homebasic into categories.

METHOD FOR PREPARING DEPLOYMENT OF SYSTEM
The longitudinal study was conducted as seven case stud-
ies [12]. The ﬁrst step of this study, described in this paper,
focused on ﬁnding people who were suitable for testing the
system and deploying the sensor network.
A. Selection of participants
The participants for the project were selected through the
¨Orebro municipality’s “Minnesmottagning” (memory center).
Every year, several hundred people contact the memory center
for consultation and help when they have concerns regarding
their own or their relative’s memory. We informed the person-
nel at the memory centers about the project and asked them
to help us ﬁnding possible participants. The selection criteria
for the participants were: they should be 65 or older, live
in ordinary housing/private residence outside nursing homes,
have self-perceived memory problems, appoint a relative in-
terested in participating in the project and have an Internet

connection (3G is ok but only if connected to a router). All
the interested people were men (for details, see Section IV).
This outcome was rather surprising since according to the
personnel at the memory center, men are not in majority
among people consulting the center and information about
the project was directed to both men and women. We could
ﬁnd two possible explanations for this outcome. Firstly, in
all age categories, men use modern ICT to a greater extent
than women [13]. Since the project focuses on using new
technology, men could be more attracted to participate in
the project than women. Secondly, women are affected by
dementia and memory decline later in life than men [14]. This
means that women consulting memory centers are older than
men. Statistics [13] show that interest and usage of technology
decrease with age. This might be another reason for why only
men were interested in participating in the project.
B. Information about the project
All people showing interest were contacted by phone.
During this ﬁrst contact, we explained the aim of the project
and shortly described Abilia Homebasic. Since receiving a
description of the system by phone was experienced as abstract
and difﬁcult to understand, we invited the people interested
in the project and their assigned relatives to a Research and
Innovation Apartment in which the system was installed and
could be demonstrated. We met each potential participant
together with their relatives in the apartment. During the
meetings, which lasted approximately one hour, we explained
the aim of the project and demonstrated and explained key
functionalities of Homebasic. We also distributed ﬂiers includ-
ing the most important information about the project. During
these meetings, all the invited people agreed to participate in
the project. Thus, we scheduled meetings with the participants
in their homes with the aim to collect necessary information
before the deployment.
C. Deployment preparation
We visited each test person in his home. During the visit,
the test person and his relative signed the informed consents
and were interviewed about their needs and expectations
regarding the sensor network. They were also asked about their
requests regarding the installation of Homebasic according to
a questionnaire (installation scheme) provided by Abilia. To
collect data about user’s needs and expectations regarding the
sensor network, we used the well-known instrument, Individ-
ually Prioritized Problem Assessment (IPPA) [15]. IPPA is
a long term instrument that supports collecting data through
interviews. The test person is asked to identify the up to seven
most important problems that he/she hopes will be reduced by
using the tool. The interviewee is also asked to estimate how
important the problems are and how difﬁcult it is to perform
daily activities related to this problem on likert scales. We
used IPPA also to collect information from relatives. For each
problem identiﬁed, they were asked to estimate how important
the problem was and how difﬁcult it was for their test person.
Additionally, they were asked to what extent they thought that
Homebasic could minimize the problem. Using IPPA and the
installation scheme, we were able to identify what expectations
and needs that the test persons and their relatives had regarding
the sensor network. After all homes had been visited, we
scheduled the physical installations of the sensor networks.
D. Deployment and training
The physical installations were done by Abilia’s techni-
cians according to the requests collected during the home visits
which were summarized in installation schemes (for details on
expected deployments, see Section IV). During the installa-
tions, we were responsible for introducing the test persons on
how to use the MP. Most of the users were quite inexperienced
in using this kind of tool. Hence, the introduction focused on
the basic functionalities of the MP. In the situations where
we could see that the users comprehended the basics, we
introduced additional functions. Otherwise, we stayed at the
basic level and appointed time for additional training. All test
persons were provided with manuals where they could learn
more about Abilia Homebasic and its functionality.

RESULTS
Table II provides information about the seven test persons
(µ = 71.6 years old), their type of accommodation and about
relatives (µ = 65.7 years old). All test persons are men and
all “relatives” are wives who live with the test persons. All
test persons and ﬁve of the relatives are retired. Two wives
are balancing work and caring for their husbands. The type of
accommodation varies, but typically the accommodations are
quite large.
In the following subsections, details on each test site
are provided. First, the test person is described. Secondly,
a table describes what functionalities that the test person
expected that the system would have and what functionalities
that were actually deployed. In reality, some expectations on
functionalities could not be met. Hence, the results for each
test site outline also when expectations could not be met.

Finally, a summary of the results from the conducted IPPA-
interviews, the expected deployments and actual deployments
is provided.
A. Test site 1
The test person experiences a memory disturbance (short
term and speech). His expectations on the system relate mostly
to the MP. In particular, he hopes that the MP calendar function
will make him feel more comfortable while communicating
with others. As an effect of having problems expressing
himself, he says that his self-conﬁdence has decreased. Due to
the fact that the test person and his wife have a summer house,
they plan to bring the calendar there over the summer. Table III
summarizes the expected deployment and actual deployment
for test site 1.
B. Test site 2
The test person who has had a number of strokes feels
that his short term memory is a bit weakened. Similarly to the
aforementioned couple, this test person and his wife have a
summer house to which they plan to bring the calendar over
the summer. Table IV summarizes the expected deployment
and actual deployment for test site 2.
C. Test site 3
The test person has problems with his back and hip and it
often happens that he forgets things (keys, wallet, phone, etc.)
when he goes out. Additionally, this is a suitable user for F7
as the test person is occasionally dizzy. The MP is expected
to be useful as the person has difﬁculties writing things down
by hand. Table V summarizes the expected deployment and
actual deployment for test site 3.
D. Test site 4
The test person lives with his wife and children in a two
story detached house. The wife is still working. Prior to being
informed about the possibility to participate in the project, the
test person is already using an analogous version of the MP.
Seen from the wife’s perspective, she expects that it will be
more time efﬁcient for her to use the digital MP, particularly
when scheduling repetitive events, which can be done in a
way which is similar to scheduling events occurring only one
time. Using the analogous version, she has to continuously
add and remove events which do not occur every day. The
test person has problems with balance, hence there is a risk of
falling, especially in the stairs. For this reason, the test person
is a suitable user of F7. The couple has a summer house and
plans to bring the MP there. Table VI summarizes the expected
deployment and actual deployment for test site 4.
E. Test site 5
The test person has a memory decline. He always carries
the calendar with him but according to the wife, it is not
sufﬁcient since he does not always know what day it is.
Overall, the wife feels that the problems are larger than the test
person seems to be aware of. The couple lives in their sum-
mer house from May-October; hence, the Homebasic will be
installed there. It occasionally happens that the coffee brewer
and the oven/stove are left turned on without surveillance.
Additionally, the test person often feels unsure about whether
or not he has locked the door when leaving the summer house.
Table VII summarizes the expected deployment and actual
deployment for test site 5.
F. Test site 6
The test person has a declined muscle power and bad
balance and is in need of F7. Additionally, he experiences
a memory disturbance (short term). The extent of the problem
is perceived as larger by the wife than by the test person.
Table VIII summarizes the expected deployment and actual
deployment for test site 6.
G. Test site 7
The test person lives with his wife who is still working
full time. Prior to being informed about the possibility to
participate in the project, the test person is already using an
analogous version of the MP. The couple has turned off the
analogous MP during night time due to it making it too light.
Seen from the wife’s perspective, she expects that it will be
more time efﬁcient for her to use the digital MP, particularly
when scheduling repetitive events, which can be done in a way
which is similar to scheduling events occurring only one time.
Using the analogous version, she has to continuously add and
remove events which do not occur every day. Additionally, the
MP will enable her the possibility to check whether activities
have been done when she is at work. She is currently unsure
on whether he showers or remembers to eat when she is
working. Table IX summarizes the expected deployment and
actual deployment for test site 7.
Table III-IX summarize the expected deployments and ac-
tual deployments for each test site. A number of abbreviations
are used. E. D. = Expected Deployment, A. D. = Actual
Deployment and F1-F9 are the Homebasic functions which
are further described in Section II. For each function F1-F8,
x = yes and - = no. For F9, a = always active and t = active
during time interval. P regards placement of MP (gs = guitar
stand or w = wall).
H. Results from Deployment Preparation
Figure 2 provides an overview of the results from the
IPPA-interviews. The test persons and wives outlined a total
of 28 problems where they expect that Homebasic could be
an aid. These problems were divided into the ﬁve categories
outlined in Section II-D: sensor-based reminders, sensor-based

actuation, calendar-based reminders, calendar visualization and
communication. The ﬁgure shows that users provided with a
limited amount of information about Homebasic mainly out-
line problems with activities related to remembering calendar
activities and remembering to turn off electric devices.
Figure 3 provides further information about the perceived
importance, difﬁculty and the system’s potential to minimize
the problem. The test persons and relatives were asked to: (1)
estimate how important the problem is on a likert scale 1-5
where 1 = Not at all important and 5 = Very important and (2)
how difﬁcult it is to conduct the activity found problematic on
a likert scale 1-5 where 1 = Very easy and 5 = Too difﬁcult
to conduct. Additionally, it provides information regarding
to what extent the relatives thought that Homebasic could
minimize the problems (1 = To a very high degree and 5 = Not
at all). For each category, the average value of the response
to the respective question is presented. To summarize, large

interviews.
numbers with respect to importance and difﬁculty indicate a
real need and a low number with respect to the potential of
minimizing a problem indicates a high expectation. The test
persons and relatives perceive that the most difﬁcult activities
are related to remembering activities or knowing what day it is.
For all categories, except for activities related to sensor-based
actuation, the relatives perceive that the test persons have more
difﬁculties than what the test persons perceive themselves.
Figure 4 summarizes the functions that were: (1) expected
to be deployed and (2) actually deployed. As can be seen
from the ﬁgure, the main deviation between the expected and
actual deployments was due to the stove sensor which could
not be installed at three test sites. According to the IPPA
interviews, many expectations on the system relate to sensor-
based reminders.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
This paper has focused on presenting a set of tools used
to evaluate long term usage of a sensor network at home. The
utility of the network in terms of adding a greater sense of
safety and security is the ultimate aim of this study. The results
so far have provided an indication of which features of the
system are more requested when novice users have only a rudi-
mentary exposure to the technology. Most participants valued
having sensor-based notiﬁcations. Secondly, calendar-based
reminders and ﬁnally calendar visualization were requested
among a subset of the participants. Each test site had further
tailored requests regarding which speciﬁc events would trigger
an alarm, reminder or notiﬁcation. The variation of requests

from the test sites, despite the relatively homogenous group,
indicates that systems such as the one presented in this paper
must be highly adaptable. Based on the empirical ﬁndings,
we identiﬁed two areas where adaptation of the system was
needed: functionality and environmental aspects.
Functionality : In our case studies, we found that most of
the test persons would prefer a lock-switch rather than the door
sensor. A lock-switch, indicating if the door is locked or not,
would better address the test persons’ current needs. A problem
that most of the test persons experienced was forgetting to
lock the door. To be reminded about it would help them in
their everyday life and would increase the sense of safety and
security for both the test persons themselves and their relatives.
On the other hand, the current functionality implemented
together with the door sensor that warns the user that he/she is
not supposed to go out at night time was experienced by our
test persons as unnecessary. Most of the test persons pointed
out that such functionality is rather for people with advance
dementia or Alzheimer. This mismatch of functionality in
relation to their needs decreased the experienced usefulness
of the system. Several of the test persons and their relatives
wondered who the system is actually aimed to support. They
stressed that the user must still have good cognitive capabilities
to be able to understand the warnings from the MP. Yet, the
door sensor indicates that the system is for people who do not
even recognize if it is day or night.
Another functionality that was experienced as missing in
the current solution of Abilia Homebasic was the lack of a
possibility to receive sms-warnings when the entrance door
is opened or if the coffee brewer and/or stove are on. In the
current solution, the MP issues warnings in such situations.
Our test persons and their relatives argued that the possibility
to receive the warnings by sms when they are not in the
neighborhood of the MP would increase their sense of safety
and security.
An additional missing functionality was recognized when
the system was deployed at test site 7. During the deployment,
we identiﬁed a need for switching off the light of the MP
during the nights. Because the functionality is missing in the
current solution, there is a risk that the MP will be installed
in locations that are not optimal for it (i.e., where it does not
disturb the users but the reminders are not heard) or that it will
be switched off during the nights with a risk that the warnings
and reminders will not be sent.
Based on our empirical ﬁndings, we argue that the lacking
functionality lead to decreased sense of safety and security for
the elderly and their relatives. We also argue that insufﬁcient
adaptability as well as not addressing users’ expectations leads
to decreased trustworthiness of the system. Additionally, we
argue that functionality in a system such as Abilia Homebasic
needs to be changeable over time. Abilia Homebasic aims to
support people within a wide range of cognitive decline from
developmental disorders to Alzheimer. Firstly, this wide range
of individuals may have very different needs and thus it has to
be possible to adapt the system to the individual user’s needs.
Secondly, cognitive decline related to dementia and Alzheimer
progresses over time. This means that the functionality needs to
be adaptable over time to be able to address the user’s changed
needs.
Environmental aspects : Another category of problems that
resulted in mismatch between the users’ needs and expecta-
tions and the actual installations was related to environmental
aspects. As described in Section IV, the desired stove sensor
could not be installed in several cases due to: not enough room
for the stove sensor when located underneath a cook top, no
standard electric socket to which the sensor’s adapter could
be connected or because the oven was directly connected to
the wall. Since the problem occurred in 3 of 7 houses, we
consider it as a serious shortcoming in the current solution.
Another common problem experienced during the installation
was an insufﬁcient WiFi-range of the Vera gateway (4 of 7).
One consequence of this problem is that Homebasic cannot be
remotely accessed in the case when support is needed. Another
consequence is that the MP cannot issue warnings when the
entrance door is opened or if the coffee brewer and/or stove are
on. Additionally, we found that the MP could not always be
placed in the ideal location due to an insufﬁcient WiFi-range or
due to no available electric socket nearby the chosen position.
Based on our empirical ﬁndings, we argue that developers of
technologies aimed to support aging in place need to consider
the different environmental aspects of the places where the
systems may be installed. In our case studies, we could see
that the problems with adaptation of the installations to the
different environments resulted in an inability to address the
users’ needs and also in limited functionality of the whole
system.
Since the study is based on a small sample of seven
test sites, our results cannot be statistically generalized. Even
if a number of researchers have argued that case study-
based research allows for generalization to theoretical con-
structs [16][17], our aim is not to generalize the ﬁndings from
this ﬁrst step in the longitudinal study. The results from the ﬁrst
step of a longitudinal study which are presented in this paper
are of explorative character and describe the expectations and
the proﬁles of each test person. Our aim is to bring to light
the importance of understanding and addressing individual
user’s expectations and needs as well as the importance of
enabling sufﬁcient adaptive personalization of the system to
these different expectations and needs.
It is argued in literature [12][18] that a case study pro-
vides rich context-speciﬁc details and in this way reveals
important information about the object under study. Using this
methodology, we were able to study the users’ expectations
and needs and the system’s possibility to address these needs

in detail. Despite the relatively homogenous group (common
geographical zone, many common characteristics), we found
that the requests from the test sites were different and that
the environments where the system was deployed were very
different. Even though the functionalities of sensor networks
may differ from Abilia Homebasic, we argue that systems
aiming at supporting aging in place need to be adaptable to
different expectations from users and over time in order to
address users’ changed needs. Thus, although we cannot claim
that our ﬁndings are valid beyond the cases investigated, we
believe that our empirical results highlight sufﬁcient possibil-
ities to adaptive personalization of the system as an important
factor to take into account when sensor systems are developed,
deployed and used.
Future work will pursue the long term methodology and
evaluation at various phases of the usage. In particular, a
follow up of the IPPA questionnaire will be conducted and an
assessment of the utility of using the sensor network at home
will be made. Finally, a series of evaluations will be performed
after the sensor network is removed from the home.
