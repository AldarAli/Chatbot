I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Electronic marketplace (EMP) [4][9][10] is a very important 
research area in the development of e-commerce technology. It 
is an inter-organizational market information system, or a 
common business information space that allows participants to 
do business through its provided functionalities [10]. Although 
EMPs becomes now more mature and stable, the increasing 
demand for online business calls for even higher interoperability 
between EMP participants and drives the need for more cost-
effective EMPs [11]. To construct a higher interoperable EMP, 
the formula I = F/C proposed by Guo [11] offers an essential 
EMP theory such that business interoperability (I) between EMP 
participants can be computed as a ratio between the number of 
effective EMP functions (F) and the coordination costs (C) of 
providing EMP functions. This implies that, the quantity and 
quality of EMP functions is an important measure of EMP 
interoperability. 
To understand the constituent of EMP functions for the 
existing EMPs, An and Guo [2] made a historical survey on 
EMP functions. This survey found there exists an EMP Basic 
Function Set (BFS) distributed in a suggested EMP functionality 
classification model [12]. Based on the finding, it is argued that 
all EMPs as a whole must present such a BFS. 
This paper agrees that there exists a BFS for all EMPs as 
found in the work of [2]. However, it further assumes that any 
type of individual EMP is constructed by a subset of BFS and 
such a subset is dynamically changing. The goal of this paper is 
to verify these two assumptions through a method of case study.  
 In the rest of this paper, Section II discusses the related 
work. Section III introduces the method of case study used in 
this paper. Section IV makes case studies along with the 
research result. Section V, validates and interprets the findings. 
In Section VI, the limitation of this research as well as some 
implications are presented. Finally, the paper is summarized and 
a conclusion is made such that a successful EMP construction 
will contain a subset of EMP BFS adapting to any dynamic 
context.

RELATED WORK 
A. EMP Basic Function Set 
The research in [2] found a basic function set (BFS) of EMP 
through a historical literature event methodology [11] by 
collecting required historical data about EMP functions to Guo’s 
EMP functionality framework [12], which, in essence, is an 
EMP 
function classification. This BFS establishes an 
interrelationship between EMP basic functions and function 
published year as well as function counted quantity. In BFS, 
each function has its own tendency curve and vertically belongs 
to a higher leveled function category. The purpose of BFS 
research is to show that functions are the indispensable elements 
for EMP construction, and that the evolved basic functions of 
EMP are meeting the demand for more interoperable EMP 
requirement. 
B. EMP Types 
While there exists a BFS of EMP, how an individual EMP is 
clearly typed by allocating a subset of the basic functions out of 
BFS still remains unknown. In practice, observations are made 
that an EMP can often be typed based on Electronic Market (EM) 
business model, industry scope, ownership, and technical 
construction method. 
1) EM business model 
Early in 1998, Timmers defined an EM business model as an 
architecture for product, service and information flow [35]. It 
contains three components [1] of content (exchanged goods and 
information), 
structure 
(the 
links 
between 
transaction 
stakeholders), and governance of transactions (the control of the 
flows of goods, information and resources). Dai and Kauffman 
[7] thought an EM business model consists of three dimensions 
of market functions, management needs, and technological 
adaptation. Though different, EM business models are mostly 
devoted to providing more mature functions for online business 
[10]. To make distinctions, Chou [5] divides online business 
participants into individuals, corporations and governments. This

enables to characterize EMPs based on transaction relationships 
between consumer, business and government [20]. For instance, 
EMP can be typed by the participant relationships of business-to-
business (B2B) [14][22][25][27], business-to-consumer (B2C) 
[16][23][24][33], business-to-government (B2G) [5][8], and 
consumer-to-consumer (C2C) [21] [28]. 
2) Industry scope  
EMPs can be classified as either horizontal or vertical [17] 
[29]. A horizontal EMP connects participants across industries. 
A vertical EMP serves the needs of a particular industry sector 
such as automotive, chemical, construction or textiles. Adopting 
a vertical EMP can reduce the cost and time along with a supply 
chain, thus enhancing working efficiency. According to [30][31], 
industries can be sorted as shown in Table I.

3) Ownership  
Unlike traditional market that is naturally existing, any EMP 
has its owners. The ownership of any EMP classifies existing 
EMP into private EMP, community (consortia) EMP and public 
EMP [6][11][18][19]. A private EMP is owned by a single legal 
person and is either buy-side or sell-side. A public EMP (also 
called an open EMP) is owned by an independent third-party 
other than buyers or sellers. A community EMP is owned by 
several key buyers or sellers or their established consortia, for 
example, Covisint, originally owned by three big automakers of 
Ford, GM and Daimler Chrysler. 
4) Technical  construction methods 
An EMP is always technically constructed by a set of 
functions serving certain e-commerce purposes such that 
functions serve to satisfy a specific set of EM requirements. 
Function-based EMP construction has long been studied. Bakos 
[4] thought an EMP consisted of functions of matching of buyers 
and 
sellers, 
transaction 
facilitation, 
and 
institutional 
infrastructure. Wang and Archer [36] suggested that EMP 
functions 
are 
classified 
into 
market-oriented 
functions 
(aggregation and match-making) and collaboration-oriented 
functions (transactional and strategic). Researches of [3][6][32] 
stated 
that 
market-oriented 
functionalities 
construct 
a 
competitive markets while collaboration functionalities construct 
supply chains that support and streamline the business processes 
between business partners. 
Recently, Guo et a. [13] proposed an EMP technical 
construction method. They thought that an EMP is a particular 
breakdown of a subset of EMP functions in BFS [2]. A 
particular subset of BFS is an EMP technical construction type. 
All types can be enumerated as specific EMP technical 
construction methods, which are: e-catalogue, e-shop, e-portal, 
e-hub, e-switch, e-integrator, and e-merger.  
III. 
METHODOLOGY OF CASE STUDY 
A. EMP case modelling 
An EMP case can be modelled for study based on EMP types. 
EMP type classifications help model formation, where a case can 
be modelled as a multitude of EMP types from several angles. 
For example, Skjott-larsen et al. classified EMP into four 
categories: horizontal and vertical EMP; buyer-side, sell-side and 
neutral EMP; fixed pricing and variable pricing marketplace; 
open and closed EMP [34]. Ordanimi and Pol proposed a 
classification of relation structure, degree of diversification and 
transaction operating mechanisms [26]. Kaplan and Sawhney 
classified EMP based on what and how businesses buy [17]. 
These analytical methods are useful yet fail to provide us with 
mutually exclusive EMP function sets that formulate strongly 
typed EMPs. To provide a strongly typed EMP, this paper selects 
four classic variable factors (technical construction method, 
ownership, business model and industry scope) shown in the Fig. 
1 to reconstruct to model an EMP – a four dimensional model.

B. Method to case analysis 
Two concepts are introduced to express the relationships 
between collected functions in the nine studied cases and BFS. 
1) Union of functions (U): The union of all the functions 
from the nine cases.  
2) Intersection of functions (I): The intersection of all the 
functions from the nine cases.  
If U and I both belong to BFS between 1986 and 2012 [2], 
then it is concluded that BFS is a complete function set for any 
EMP to customize its construction. To find the functions 
historically appeared in nine cases, Wayback Machine [46] is 
adopted as the history web archival website, where all functions 
from 1986 to 2012 are collected. Since the history of EMP is as 
short as Web history, the most recorded Web pages at [46] are 
pretty robust in recording Web history and sufficient to represent 
the whole EMP development [11][13].

CASE STUDY AND ANALYSIS 
A. Case study 
The nine cases, shown in Table II, are studied. They are all 
well-known and representative for EMP construction modelling 
as illustrated in Fig. 1. To analyze them, the nine cases are 
divided into two control groups. Control group one consists of 
three comparative samples, shown in Tables III, IV and V, with 
the same V1 (e-portal) but different V2, V3, and V4. Control 
group two, shown in Table VI, consists of different V1, but same 
V2, V3, and V4.

B. Analytical Results 
The cases of control group one (see Knowledgestorm [37], 
Dell [38], Wire-and-cable [39], Taobao [40] and Alibaba [41]) 
shows that (1) if the technical construction method is the same 
(e.g., e-portal in control group one), the EMP function set 
adopted has commonality for all EMPs even if they have 
different variables of business model, industry scope and 
ownership; and (2) Some functions appear not belonging to the 
e-portal EMP type and belonging to e-integrator type, which 
means that e-portal is evolving to a more sophisticated EMP 
type. 
The cases control group two are selected with different 
technical construction methods, shown in E2open [42], Bolero 
[43], Tradecard [44] and Ariba [45]. The analytical result shows 
that different technical construction methods have different 
subsets of BFS for EMP despite of the same business model, 
industry scope and ownership. This verifies that each EMP 
technical construction method has its own subset of BFS for 
EMP construction. 
V. 
VALIDATION, INTERPRETATION AND 
IMPLICATION 
With the validation from the two control groups, functions 
are proven to be the indispensable elements for EMP 
construction. Furthermore, when compared with other three 
EMP 
construction 
classifications, 
technical 
construction 
methods based on functions have their own superiorities.  
In order to meet the demand for highly interoperable and 
cost-effective EMP, Attentions should be more paid to basic 
functions. According to the studied cases, a best fit (least 
squares) linear regression is used to predict the tendency of all 
functions till the year of 2020.  
                FORECAST (x, known_y's, known_x's)                   (1) 
 
The parameter x shown in (1) must have a numeric value, 
known_y's and known_x's must be arrays or cell ranges that 
contain equal numbers of numeric data values. It shows clearly 
different results in Table VII separately in 2014, 2017 and 2020. 
Specifically, the function of license agreement will be the most 
popular one (11.81) in 2014. However, social network system 
(marketing) will replace license agreement as the top function 
(13.90 and 18.40) in both 2017 and 2020. With SPSS forecast 
results of the two basic functions shown in Fig.2, we can further 
validate this prediction.

LIMITATIONS AND IMPLICATIONS 
Nowadays, smartphones and computers are intimately 
connected, and this new relationship will perhaps reveal 
some limitations of our study, because the functions we 
covered in this study are primarily based on official 
websites not mobile applications. For instance, take the case 
of Alibaba; QR Codes function is not included in our study. 
Moreover, in the case of Taobao, the emerging Taobao 
University is also an important function, which produces a 
great number of e-commerce specialists. Similarly, Ariba 
University is able to help the participants with the skills and 
practices that will allow them to take advantage of all the 
benefits of the Ariba EMP solutions. Nonetheless, given the 
scope of this paper, the nine selected cases are very 
representative.

This paper has several important implications for the 
future development of EMPs. First, finding and updating the 
known EMP (BFS) is important. Second, mastering 
technical construction methods is a key to simplify the 
building of various types of EMP. Third, the EMP 
construction model has provided a guideline of customizing 
a particular EMP based on the given BFS and the forecasted 
functions. 
VII. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
In a nutshell, the case study done in this paper has 
validated the EMP BFS proposed in the previous research [2] 
and also predicted the future development of each function 
until the year of 2020. Employing the methodology of EMP 
construction model proposed in this paper and the notions of 
union and intersection, all functions have been collected 
from the nine cases and have been found in the BFS. This 
research is a more comprehensive study, which has been 
combined with the previous literature-based research [2], to 
reflect the typical customer requirements and inherent 
functionalities for a successful EMP. It aims at higher 
interoperability and cost-effectiveness that meet the demand 
of a successful EMP. In future, the EMP construction 
customization will be studied based on the given BFS.
