Abstract—Polymer/clay hybrids materials receive much 
attention due to their interesting mechanical and thermal 
properties. Composites of poly(vinyl chloride) have been 
prepared by melt intercalation method using commercial type 
of pure kaolinite (SAK47), urea intercalated kaolinite 
(SAK47/urea), and intercalated/exfoliated kaolinite after 
washing of urea from kaolinite-urea (del. SAK47). In the next 
step the untreated and treated kaolinite was modified by Bis(2-
ethylhexyl)phthalate, 
DEHP, 
(SAK47/DEHP, 
SAK47/urea/DEHP 
and 
del. 
SAK47/DEHP). 
For 
the 
PVC/kaolinite composites the suspension type of PVC with K 
value 60 was used. Untreated and treated kaolinite samples as 
well as PVC composites were examined by X-ray diffraction 
(XRD) and microscopy (SEM). The interactions between 
kaolinite and modifier were discussed by FTIR-ATR. Tested 
mechanical properties were improved almost for all PVC 
mixtures. The highest values of tensile strength and E-modulus 
were observed for PVC+del.SAK47/DEHP.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In 
worldwide 
commercial 
importance, 
polyvinyl 
chloride (PVC) is the third most widely produced plastic, 
after polyethylene and polypropylene [1]. It was first 
recognized and characterized in 1835 by Henri Victor 
Regnault and it became commercially significant in 
Germany prior to World War II [2]. PVC can be modified 
by large amounts of modifying agents like plasticizers, 
fillers (calcium carbonate, kaolinite, and calcined kaolinite), 
and so on. This material can offer many good properties, 
such as low flammability, high chemical resistance, barrier 
properties low cost, and formulating versatility. On the other 
hand, the properties such as its poor impact toughness and 
low heat-softening temperature limit its application [3]. 
Next PVC mixtures disadvantage is migration and toxicity 
of some additives used in PVC, which may have a negative 
impact on the environment and human health. For all that, 
PVC production is expected to exceed 40 million tons by 
2016 [4].  
Kaolinite is a common phyllosilicate mineral, with a 
general chemical formulation Al2Si2O5(OH)4. This clay has 
1:1 dioctahedral structure which is composed of tetrahedral 
sheets SiO4 and octahedral sheets (Al2(OH)4). The layers 
linked together by hydrogen bonds between surface 
hydroxyl groups on the octahedral side and the basal 
oxygen atoms on the tetrahedral side [5]. Because of 
hydrophobic properties of kaolinite and hydrophilic 
character of polymer the modification of kaolinite is 
necessary. The separation of kaolinite results in particle size 
reducing and an increase of the specific surface area. The 
good kaolinite modification result in better intercalation 
between filler and polymer matrix. In addition the 
properties of composite materials could be improved. 
Kaolinite has many industrial applications; it is used in 
paper, paint, rubber, plastics and ceramics industries. Its 
largest applicability as filler in PVC is on production 
electrical cables or film anti-blocking, tiles and so one [6-
9].  
This paper follows up our research of PVC inorganic 
hybrids based on kaolinite/urea. In this part it is compared 
the 
kaolinite/urea 
based 
PVC 
composition 
with 
kaolinite/urea/DEHP mixtures. All presented mixtures were 
prepared by melt intercalation. The morphology and 
mechanical properties composites based on pure kaolinite, 
urea intercalated kaolinite, intercalated/exfoliated kaolinite 
after washing of urea from kaolinite-urea, and kaolinite 
additionally modified with DEHP were examined and 
compared. Furthermore, infrared spectroscopy was used in 
order to get insight into interactions between minerals and 
modifier at a molecular level. 
II. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
A. Materials 
Suspension type of polyvinyl chloride (Neralit 601) 
with K-value 60 (Spolana a. s., Czech Republic) was used 
as the polymer matrix.  
Three types of filler were studied: commercial kaolinite, 
urea intercalated kaolinite, and intercalated/exfoliated 
kaolinite after washing of urea. Firstly, Kaolinite SAK47 
(LB Minerals) was investigated without any additional 
treatment in received state. Beside kaolinite as a main 
component of SAK47, it contains quartz and mica as 
admixtures as was revealed using X-ray diffraction method. 
According to data available from producer of SAK47 82 % 
of particles are smaller than 10 m [10].  
Next urea was used for the intercalation of SAK47. The 
sample preparation was performed according to procedure 
described by Valaskova ‗et. al.‘ [11] and Zykova ‗et. al.‘ 
109

[12]. 500 g of SAK47 (LB Minerals) was homogenized for 
5 min with 330 g of urea (Lachner, p.a. grade) in vibrating 
mill. Intercalation of urea into kaolinite interlayer was 
achieved by 48 hours long heating of the homogenized 
mixture at 95 °C in laboratory oven [11,12].  
Futher delamination of kaolinite was achieved using 5 
hour long low-temperature ultrasound washing of urea with 
distilled water. This process is explained in detail in 
publications [11,12]. For 100 g of intercalate 3 l of distilled 
water was used. After washing liquid portion was removed 
by sedimentation, obtained solid portion was dried at 60 °C. 
By 
this 
way 
was 
obtained 
del. 
SAK47 
(intercalated/exfoliated kaolinite after washing of urea).  
Finally all three types of filler (SAK47, SAK47/urea, 
and 
del. 
SAK47) 
were 
treated 
by 
Bis(2-
ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP). DEHP is an organic 
compound with the formula C6H4(C8H17COO)2 and it is the 
most important phthalate, Untreated and treated kaolinite 
was modified by DEHP (DEZA a.s., Czech Republic) in 
laboratory mixer at 80 °C for 1 hour and then dried on the 
oven at 100 °C for 24 hours. After treatment the powder 
was obtained. 
 
B. PVC Composite Processing  
PVC/kaolinite composite samples were prepared, in 
accordance with Zykova ‗et. al.‘ [12], via the melt 
intercalation method on the two-roll mill Collin W100T for 
20 minutes, using speed 10 rpm and the temperature of the 
front and behind rolls was 181 and 177 °C. The exact 
composition of the polymer/clay composites can be seen in

C. Methods 
X-ray 
diffraction 
was 
(XRD) 
obtained 
using 
PANalytical X´Pert PRO diffracto-meter equipped with 
CuKα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) at room temperature. The 
scans were taken in a 2  range from 4 to 30 °, with 0.02 ° 
step size and the counting time of one scan 5 s. 
Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) Avatar 
320 (Nicolet CZ, s.r.o) was employed to get insight into 
interactions between mineral and urea modifier at a 
molecular level. ATR method was used with number of 
scan 64. 
 The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photographs 
of the samples were taken to assess the morphology 
kaolin/PVC composites by a VEGA\\LMU. Before 
examination, samples were coated by thin layer of Ag/Pd.  
Mechanical properties were measured by Alpha 
Technologies Tensometer 2000 and a speed of testing was 
500 mm/min. The dogbone specimens (type V in 
accordance with standard CSN EN ISO 527-2) were used 
for the measurement.  
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
X-ray powder diffraction method was used to observe 
urea and urea/DEHP intercalation process. Significant 
segments 
of 
XRD 
patterns 
described 
process 
of 
intercalation as well as delamination are pictured in Figure 
1. Decrease in intensity of d001 basal diffraction of kaolinite 
with maxima at d=0.717 nm is evident after the 
intercalation with urea. The new peak with maxima at 
d=1.072 nm is connected with formation of kaolinite-urea 
complex [11] and is connected with increase in interlayer 
distance due to the insertion of urea molecules. After the 
washing this diffraction disappears (see pattern del. 
SAK47) in Figure 1. After  DEHP addition to SAK47 the 
maximum d= 0,717 nm intensity is decreased, but it is still 
very strong. In the case of SAK47/urea/DEHP the original 
maximum of kaolinite at d=0.7171 nm was almost 
disappeared and the maximum at d=1.072 nm is lower 
comparing SAK47/urea intercalate. This fact could be 
connected with lower organization of layeres. For del. 
SAK47/DEHP is the basal diffraction d001 on the same 
position as for del. SAK47. The peak intensity reveals that 
the intercalation and delamination of kaolinite was not 
complete in this case.

Next Figures 2-4 demonstrate the XRD patterns of 
unfilled PVC and PVC/kaolinite samples. In Figure 2 is 
observed that in the PVC+SAK47 composite the

characteristic peak of kaolinite (d001) is still visible. It 
indicated that filler still keeps its original crystal structure.

For the PVC+SAK47/DEHP kaolinite maximum intensity 
was fall down around 40 %. This fact could indicate the 
improved kaolinite dispersion in polymer matrix. The 
d=0,717 
nm 
is 
almost 
disappeared 
in 
case 
of 
PVC+SAK47/urea 
and 
PVC+SAK47/urea/DEHP 
composite (Figure 3). It was observed broad low intensity 
peak at d=1.072 nm, which is connected with increase of 
interlayer distance. Next in the pattern of PVC+del.SAK47 
(Figure 4) the kaolinite diffraction peak at 0,717 nm also 
almost disappears. On the other hand when the DEHP was 
employed to the process of del.SAK47 modification the 
intensity of this maximum was increased. The intensity of 
(d001) is around 70 % lower comparing PVC+SAK47 
mixture. From XRD results that modified kaolinites are 
probably more dispersed into the polymer matrix than 
untreated SAK47. 
 
 
Figure 5.  FTIR-ATR spectra of natural kaolinite SAK47 and modified 
kalinite SAK47/urea, del. SAK47. 
The FTIR-ATR method was used to study the changes in 
the kaolinite structure after intercalation. The spectra of 
unmodified and modified kaolinite are presented in Figure 5 
and 6. There are three kinds of hydroxyl groups in 
unmodified kaolinite SAK47: inner-surface hydroxyl group 
at 3689 and 3670 cm-1, inner hydroxyl 3619cm-1, and 
absorbed water hydroxyl with vibration 3651 cm-1 in Figure 
5 [3,13]. Next vibrations 1113, 1026 and 910 cm-1 
characterize the Si-O stretching vibrations. O-Al-OH 
stretching vibrations are connected with vibrations 787, 749 
and 669 cm-1. The general features of kaolin intercalated 
with urea (SAK47/urea) are practically the same as for 
SAK47 (Figure 5). Nonetheless, there are some differences 
in the NH stretching region of SAK47/urea spectrum. Two 
new bands appear at 3499 and 3385 cm−1. These bands 
could refer to a small amount of hydrogen bonding of urea 
to the kaolinite surface through its NH group. Futher, in the 
region 1400–1700 cm−1 the changes in spectra of 
SAK47/urea was noticed. New vibrations at 1663, 1621, 
1587 and 1473 cm-1 were observed comparing unmodified 
SAK47. This may suggest that modification by urea results 
in some intercalation of the SAK47. After washing with 
distilled water the intensity of observed vibration connected 
with urea are dropped, but they are still visible. This fact 
could indicate that the bonded part of intercalation agent 
stay in the clay structure after washing.

FTIR spectra SAK47/urea modification by DEHP are 
showed in the Figure 6. New vibration was observed in the 
region above 3000 cm-1. Next new maximum is at 1781 and 
1417 cm-1. It is supposed that they could be connected with 
the DEHP and  urea interactions. 
 
 
Figure 6.  FTIR-ATR spectra of SAK47/urea and SAK47/urea/DEHP. 
SEM was used for the morphological study of the 
unmodified and modified kaolinite within the PVC matrix. 
The structure PVC composites based on untreated and 
treated SAK47 modified by urea was previously described 
in paper [12]. It was observed that the PVC filled by 5 wt. 
% of untreated kaolinite (SAK47) shows inhomogeneity 
which suggests the poor interfacial adhesion between 
polymer and filler, see Figure 7. On the other hand, PVC 
filled by 5 wt. % of SAK47 modified by urea indicated 
better dispersion with low amount of aggregates. In 
composition PVC/del.SAK47 kaolinite layers seem to be 
delaminated into individual layers or stacks of several 
layeres of kaolin in PVC. In the case of DOP the 
homogenity was further improved. These resutls are in good 
agreement with XRD and mechanical properties.  
 
 
Figure 7.  SEM: PVC/SAK47 and PVC/SAK47/urea. 
Mechanical properties tested PVC composites are 
summarised in Table 2. It can be seen that the tensile 
strength all presented PVC composite samples is higher as 
compared to unfilled PVC. The lowest value of tensile 
strength from tested PVC composites has the mixture 
PVC+SAK47/urea. The highest value was observed for 
PVC+del.SAK47/DEHP with change around 13 % 
comparing pure PVC. In addition, all composite samples 
also show E-modulus increase as compared to unfilled 
PVC. The Sample PVC+del.SAK47/DEHP offers the 
highest value with an improvement 28 %. The lowest E-
modulus from tested composites was obtained for 
PVC+SAK47 (untreated kaolinite). Generaly it could be 
said that highest values of E-modulus gives the 
compositions with additional treatment with DEHP. It 
could indicated that these mixtures offers better dispersion 
in polymer matrix.

CONCLUSION 
The effect of the untreated, treated kaolinite by urea and 
DEHP on the morphology and mechanical properties was 
investigated. 
Firstly, XRD and FTIR study confirms that kaolinite 
modification results in intercalation of the SAK47. FTIR-
ATR spectra indicated hydrogen bonding of urea to the 
kaolinite surface through its NH group. Furthermore the 
rest of urea was observed in spectra after distilled water 
washing. This fact could indicate that the bonded part of 
intercalation agent stay in the clay structure after washing. 
FTIR spectra kaolinite/urea modified by DEHP show new 
vibration in the region above 3000 cm-1, 1781 and 
1417  cm-1. It is supposed that they could be connected with 
the DEHP and  urea interactions. 
The XRD patterns show that the urea and DEHP have 
the influence on the PVC composite morphology. The 
largest changes in XRD patterns were observed by 
compositions based on urea and urea/DEHP.  
Tested mechanical properties, tensile strength and E-
modulus, were improved almost for all PVC mixtures. The 
highest values of tensile strength and E-modulus were 
observed for PVC+del.SAK47/DEHP with change around 
13 % and 28 % comparing pure PVC. This improvement 
could be connected with delamination of kaolinite layers, 
which results in the increase of the specific surface area.
