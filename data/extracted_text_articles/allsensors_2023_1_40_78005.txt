Abstract—The article discusses the development and analysis
of a new design for piezoelectric accelerometers that are used to
measure acceleration in various applications. The new design uses
piezoelectret materials, which offer advantages over traditional
piezoelectric ones, including improved resistance to humidity,
greater stability in extreme temperatures, and increased flex-
ibility in meeting design requirements. The piezoelectret used
in this study is a thermo-formed piezoelectret based on open-
tubular channel structures. The paper explains the manufac-
turing process of the piezoelectret, which involves thermal
lamination of two fluoroethylene propylene (FEP) foils and a
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) template, resulting in four open-
tubular channels separated by a distance of 1.4 mm. The polymer
structure is coated with aluminum through evaporation to create
electrodes. The piezoelectret sample is then used to create a new
design of accelerometers with a single detection axis, consisting
of a cylindrical lead seismic mass enclosed in a PTFE sheath
placed over the piezoelectret. An elastic component made of
polyurethane foam provides mechanical support and restitution.
The authors conclude that this new design of piezoelectric
accelerometers using piezoelectret materials has the potential to
offer superior performance in various applications.

I. INTRODUCTION
Accelerometers are widely used for measuring accelera-
tion in various industrial, medical, and scientific applications.
These accelerometers convert acceleration into an electrical
signal, enabling the analysis and interpretation of the dynamic
characteristics of a moving system. Since their invention in
the 1950s, piezoelectric accelerometers have been fundamental
tools for engineers and researchers in fields such as vibration
analysis, process control, health monitoring, and structural
testing [1].
In recent years, a new technology has emerged in the
development of accelerometers: piezoelectret materials. These
polymeric materials offer several advantages over traditional
piezoelectric materials, including greater stability in extreme
temperatures, improved resistance to humidity, and increased
flexibility to meet different design requirements. Since 2004,
Sessler and collaborators have provided an overview of this
emerging technology, including the manufacture of piezoelec-
tret accelerometers and methods for producing sensors with
superior performance [2] [3]. In 2009, Altafim Pisani and
collaborators [4] [5] developed a new piezoelectret material,
named thermo-formed piezoelectrets, which presents a high
piezoelectric coefficient with the same advantages of piezo-
electrets. They also demonstrated that this material has a
linear behavior with frequency until the frequency of 30 kHz,
where a resonance peak occurs, which can be modified by the
geometry of the channels [6]. In the following sections, we
present and analyze a novel design of accelerometers utilizing
this material. For instance, Section 2 describes the production
of the piezoelectret and the accelerometer, including details
on fabrication. In Section 3, significant results are presented
and thoroughly discussed. Finally, in Section 4, we present our
main conclusions.

II. ACCELEROMETER DESIGN
A piezoelectret sample, as depicted in Figure 1, was fab-
ricated using the thermal lamination technique described in
[5]. In this process, two 50 µm-thick fluoroethylene propylene
(FEP) foils were laminated at 300 ◦C with a 100 µm-thick
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) film placed between them. The
PTFE was previously laser-cut with four rectangular openings
through which the FEP films were bonded during lamination.
After this process, the PTFE was removed, leaving an FEP
structure with four open channels. The PTFE was designed to
produce four channels that were 1.4 mm wide and 30 mm long,
regularly spaced at intervals of 1.4 mm. The polymer film-like
structure was later coated with aluminum through evaporation,
creating electrodes with a final active area of 168 mm2.

A. Description
Figure 2 depicts the schematic of the thermo-formed piezo-
electret accelerometer (TFPA) with a single detection axis.
The accelerometer is composed of a 30 g cylindrical lead
seismic mass, with dimensions of 10 mm in height and 18 mm
in diameter, enclosed within a PTFE sheath placed over a
thermo-formed piezoelectret. An elastic component made of
polyurethane foam with a density of 12 kg/m³ is placed on
top of the mass to provide mechanical support and restitution,
while an aluminum guide vertically guides the mass. To ensure
mechanical resistance and electrical shielding, the transducer is
connected to a BNC connector and is enclosed in an aluminum
cylindrical case measuring 74 mm in height and 51 mm
in diameter. This dimension is far larger than the standard
accelerometer; however, it is expected that this design will be
reduced by 10 times in the laboratory facilities.
For the tests conducted with the TFPA, a custom-made
shaker was constructed using a 15.24 cm (6 inch) diameter
mid-bass speaker from Foxer Alto-falantes®, equipped with
a ferrite magnet and an aluminum single coil, with 4 Ω
impedance, 80 W power, frequency response ranging from
30 Hz to 30 kHz, and sensitivity of 90 dB/W. An acrylic

0.5 Hz to 1600 Hz.
The input signals for the shaker were generated using the
Tektronix function generator model AFG3022CA. A Taramps
TL-500 Class D Amplifier was used for signal amplification.
III. THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS
A simplified depiction of the thermo-formed piezoelectret
accelerometer is presented in Figure 4 (a). As shown, the
piezoelectret is placed under an enclosure seismic mass that
compresses the piezoelectret channels when subjected to vi-
bration.

formed piezoelectret accelerometer. (b) Representation of the
simplified model for a piezoelectret.
The piezoelectret compression results in a change in thick-
ness (∆d) and subsequently leads to a voltage variation (∆V )
at the sample electrodes [8]. According to Sessler et al. [7], if
the piezoelectret cavities is modeled as rectangular cavities, as
shown in Figure 4 (b), then the voltage variation ∆V due to a
variation ∆d can be mathematically determined by Equation 1:
∆V = E.∆d
(1)
where E is the electric field inside an air cavity (here repre-
sented by the open channels), and given by Equation 2:
E =
σs
ϵ0(ϵd + s)
(2)
where σ is the superficial electric charge density of the cavity
walls, s is the thickness of the polymeric film, ϵ0 is the vacuum
permittivity, and ϵ is the relative permittivity of the polymeric
layer.
The term ∆d from Equation 1 can be determined from
Young’s modulus of the cavity plus foam (Y ) when a force F
is applied to it, as shown below in Equation 3:
Y = F/A
∆d/d =⇒ ∆d = Fd
Y.A
(3)
As F can also be expressed as ms∆a, where ms is
the seismic mass and ∆a is the acceleration, ∆V can be
determined by Equation 4:
∆V =
σs
ε0(ε.d + s) ·
d
Y.A · ms∆a
(4)
Thus, in the piezoelectret accelerometer, any variation in
acceleration (∆a) generates a voltage variation (∆V ).
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
As
previously
described,
the
proposed
accelerometer
(TFPA) was tested over a shaker platform, which vibrated over
frequencies ranging between 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. It´s output,
recorded as peak-to-peak millivolts (mV ) signals, provided the
frequency response plot in Figure 5. The graph reveals a clear
resonance peak at 200 Hz and a relatively linear response for
frequencies above 400 Hz.

peak voltage.
This result is analogous to the response obtained from a
commercial accelerometer ADXL327 (depicted in Figure 6)
under identical vibrating conditions. The comparison can
be further elucidated by normalizing the values using their
respective maximum peak-to-peak output voltage within the
frequency range of the experiment, as shown in Figure 8,
which have a correlation factor of 0,985.
Both the ADXL327 accelerometer and the TFPA exhibit a
linear response within the same frequency range, suggesting
that the 200Hz resonance may not be an inherent characteristic
of the accelerometer but rather a consequence of the test
system assembly used in the calibration procedure. Neverthe-
less, this system can still be utilized to determine the TFPA’s

sensitivity in mV/g, considering that the ADXL327 has a linear
sensitivity of 420mV/g [9]. In such a case, dividing the data
on the y-axis of Figure 6 by 420mV/g generates a graph of
acceleration in m/s², shown in Figure 7. Furthermore, dividing
the y-axis data of the graph in Figure 5 by the corresponding
acceleration in m/s² for each frequency, Figure 7 allows us
to determine an average sensitivity of 78mV/g for frequencies
above 400Hz.

V. CONCLUSION
This article presents a novel approach for producing ac-
celerometers using thermo-formed piezoelectrets. A brief de-
scription of the process for fabricating piezoelectrets with
open channels is provided, followed by the construction of the
accelerometer with a single detection axis. Some advantages of
using FEP thermo-formed piezoelectrets over more traditional
ones are emphasized, such as improved moisture resistance
and thermal stability. Measurements in the frequency domain
(up to 1 kHz) were performed and reported, allowing a com-
parison between the proposed accelerometer and a standard
model (ADXL327). It was observed that both accelerometers
presented a very similar response with a clear resonance peak
at 200 Hz, which was attributed to the measuring setup.
From this result, it was calculated that the TFPA presents
a sensitivity of 78 mV/g while the commercial ADXL327
provides 420 mV/g. This discrepancy in sensitivity is related
to the higher amplification gain and was not understood as
a deficiency of the TFPA accelerometer. It was concluded
that accelerometers with the proposed design, i.e., using
piezoelectrets, can be explored in a variety of applications,
especially in studies of motor and equipment vibrations. As
for future developments, it is expected to reduce the physical
dimensions of the accelerometer, extend the frequency range
analysis to higher frequencies, and employ them in studies
regarding motor mechanical vibrations.
