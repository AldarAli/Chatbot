Abstract—The respiratory system of a human embodies complex
assembly of tissues and organs (typically internal and external
intercostal muscles, diaphragm, lung and rib cage), which are
coordinated in a fashion that allows the inﬂux and efﬂux of air
into the airways and lungs. Like all other biological systems,
the respiratory system is susceptible to injuries and diseases.
Where ventilation has been severely impaired leading to poor
gaseous exchange across the lung tissue, biomechanical thera-
peutic modalities such as continuous positive airway pressure
(CPAP) and mechanical ventilators have been prescribed for
such patients. Currently, Nasal High Flow therapy (NHFT), a
novel ventilation technique has been reported to improve gaseous
exchange in both neonates and adults by supplying a constant ﬂow
of humidiﬁed and warmed air into the lungs. NHFT is presently
applied in the management of apnoea of prematurity, respiratory
distress syndrome, bronchiolitis, and acute lung injury. In spite
of reported success, its mechanisms of action (MOA) are not
wholly understood. This work, in terms of relevance, provides
some insights into the MOA of NHFT by underscoring the math-
ematical basis for reported improved gaseous exchange during
the administration of NHFT. The mathematical model predictions
appreciably agreed with bench-top measurements - indicating 17
% and 24% reduction in end tidal CO2 concentration upon the
respective administration of 30 l/min and 60 l/min NHFT.

INTRODUCTION
Capnography is the process of analysing the partial pres-
sure of CO2 in respiratory gases [1]. Owing to the importance
of capnography in current medical practice, medical bodies in-
cluding the American Association for Respiratory Care [1] and
American Society of Anesthesiologists [2] [3] have endorsed it
as a method for verifying the correct placement of endotracheal
tubes for the provision of respiratory support. Where blood
acidosis is clinically diagnosed, capnography may be used to
identify the cause by checking for hypercarbia (PaCO2 > 45
mmHg) [4]. Additionally, since CO2 is transported from the
cells (sites of metabolism) to the lungs via the circulatory
system, events such as pulmonary and vascular embolism can
be detected using capnography [5].
The CO2 proﬁle recorded during a breathing cycle is
unique in terms of morphology for healthy individuals [6][2].
A CO2 tension proﬁle for a healthy state is shown in Figure
1. Phase I denotes the baseline where inspiration is about to
end. The transition stage, Phase II, physically represents a
blending of alveolar CO2-rich air and dead space air. Phase
III (alveolar plateau) indicates an almost complete saturation
of the airway with alveolar air and peaks at point EtCO2,
known as end-tidal concentration of CO2 . Inspiration begins
immediately after EtCO2 - marking the commencement of
phase IV, where inﬂux of fresh atmospheric air speedily
dilutes airway air until the baseline value is reached [6][5][7].
Essentially, deviations from healthy state morphology may be
suggestive of a pathological condition of the respiratory system
[7][3]. It has been mentioned that changes in baseline level,
steadiness of the alveolar plateau and slope of transitional
portion may be cardinal to the clinical diagnosis of CO2
rebreathing and pneumothorax [3][5].

Figure 2 shows two polymer models of the upper airway
geometry fabricated for experimental work. To fabricate this,
a set of computer tomography (CT) images obtained from
an adult (age = 44 years and gender = male) was used to
reconstruct an in silico anatomically representative 3-D model
of the upper airway. A detailed description of model making
methods has been outlined by Geoghegan et al. [8]. A physical
upper airway model, patterned according to the in silico model,
was built by the use a 3-D printer (fused deposition modelling
type), which utilized acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) as
print material.
Nasal high ﬂow therapy (NHFT) involves the administra-
tion of humidiﬁed and heated air (up to normothermia) at
a constant ﬂow rate. Figure 3 is a pictorial representation
of the administration of NHFT via a nasal cannula using
Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Airvo2 device. It has been reported
that NHFT washes the nasopharygeal dead space resulting
in an increased proportion of inhaled oxygen content and

a subsequent improvement in gaseous exchange across the
blood-gas barrier [9][10][11]. Arthur et al. [12] pioneered
the use of physico-mathematical models to investigate CO2
ﬂuctuations in the pulmonary system. Their analysis explained
the effect of rebreathing on pulmonary CO2 tension proﬁle.
Authors such as Finchman et al. [13] and Milhorn et al
[14] used sophisticated compartmental models which included
homeostatic response mechanisms, to provide insight into
arterial and alveolar reactions to step changes in inhaled CO2
amounts. Quite recently, Swanson et al. [15] and Benallal et
al. [16] applied a two compartment model to shed light on
alveolar gas changes during exercise. In the present work,
an identical two compartment model has been modiﬁed to
investigate the amount of CO2 ﬂushing from the dead space
under the inﬂuence of NHFT.
In Section 2, formulation of the mathematical model along
with the experimental setup is presented. Section 3 comprises
of results obtained from both mathematical simulation and
bench-top experiment. A discussion of results and concluding
observations are presented in Sections 4 and 5 respectively.

METHOD
A. Modelling setup
The model presented in this work is identical to that used
by Benallal et al. [16] however the inclusion of a constant
volumetric
ﬂow
term
to
cater
for
NHFT
distinguishes
the present model (Figure 4) from it. In this model, the
volume of the respiratory system has been thought of as
compartmentalized into two main units, namely dead space
unit and alveolar unit. The dead space unit represents the
volume of all airway regions where gaseous exchange does not
occur whilst the alveolar unit denotes the combined volume
of lung and airway regions that exchange gas with pulmonary
capillaries. Assumptions made during the formulation of
model equations include the following (a) administration of
NHFT does not change the dead space volume (time invariant)
(b) alveolar volume changes due to NHFT is insigniﬁcant (c)
there is negligible gas loss across the walls of the dead space.
Figure 4. Model representation of respiratory system.
A description of the symbols used in Figure 4 and model
equations (1-5) is presented in Table I. Tidal ﬂow data of a
healthy male adult (age 23, BMI = 24.6), acquired using a
spirometer setup, was used as an input signal to the model.
The ﬂow signal was scaled to produce a tidal volume of 500
ml, which is the estimated average for healthy adults [17].
For a resting phase spontaneous breathing of an adult, the
functional residual capacity, average metabolic CO2 produc-
tion rate ( ˙Vmet) and O2 exchange rate ( ˙V O2) across the blood
gas barrier were speciﬁed as 2500 ml, 240 ml/min and 300
ml/min respectively as used by several authors [16][15][14][5].
Equations (1) and (2) are descriptive of the CO2 balance in the
dead space unit during inspiration and expiration, respectively.
In a like manner, the material balance of CO2 in the alveolar
compartment during the breathing cycle is represented by (4)
and (5). The alveolar volumetric transience is described by

To solve this 5 non-linear system of equations, a Runge-
Kutta (4,5) based solver, ode45, custom-packaged in Matlab
(Version 2014b) was employed. The simulation was performed
using 50 breathing cycles, which is equivalent to 3.5 minutes
of breathing.

A sensitivity study was performed to evaluate the inde-
pendent contribution of the model parameters to EtCO2. The
resolution of the sensitivity scale was limited to a 1 % change
in EtCO2 because a 1 % change signiﬁcantly affects amount
of CO2 ﬂushed when NHFT is applied. Findings for a 10
% increment on each parameter value is presented in Table
II. EtCO2 was found to be most responsive to initial value
of alveolar CO2 partial pressure (PACO2) and metabolic CO2
production rate. Variation in initial dead space CO2 fraction
produced the least change in EtCO2.

B. Experimental work
The same physiological ﬂow signal as speciﬁed for the
mathematical model was programmed into a LabVIEW (Ver-
sion 8.6) application that operates a pulsatile pump (Figure
5). See component labelling of Figure 5 for setup description.
The pulsatile pump (2) connects to a 3-D printed upper airway
model via a tubing. NHFT is administered through a nasal
cannula (4) by means of a Fisher & Paykel Airvo2 device (3).
In performing CO2 experiments, CO2 was metered at a bleed
rate of 250 ml/min into the pump chamber (piston barrel) ,
allowing a back pressure of 101.3 KPa in the CO2 source (1).
Measurement of CO2 concentration at the trachea opening of
the airway model is performed using a capnograph (5). After
a minute, a steady CO2 proﬁle peaking at EtCO2 of 5.2% was
observed on the computer (6) connected t the capnograph.
Figure 5. Complete experimental setup
At this point, recording of CO2 data was performed for 3
minutes followed by 30 l/min NHFT - administered using
Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Airvo2 device. Two minutes was
allowed for equilibration after which CO2 recording proceeded
for 3 more minutes. An identical procedure was repeated
for 60 l/min NHFT, after residual effects from the previous
experiment had been eliminated by shutting off CO2 bleed
valve whilst the pump was in operation - allowing CO2 levels
to plummet to near atmospheric values.

the alveolar unit during a 50 breathing cycle simulation.

ﬂow wave used for both simulation and experiment had a
period of 4.3 seconds - inspiratory time being 2 seconds
and expiratory time being 2.3 seconds. Plot B (Figure 6)
represents two cycles of zero-therapy (ZT) ventilatory ﬂow
patterns superimposed on corresponding alveolar CO2 fraction
proﬁle at steady state. The distortions on the ﬂow wave at
the interface between inspiration and expiration are artefacts
introduced by the limited resolution of the spirometer ﬂow
device, which is directly linked to the observable local
perturbations in fractional alveolar CO2 proﬁle at the ﬂow
transition points. The alveolar CO2 fraction is seen to rise
up to 0.3 seconds into inspiration. Furthermore, over the
respiratory cycle, alveolar CO2 fraction ﬂuctuates between
4.9 % and 5.3 % with a mean value corresponding to 5.1 % .

Figure 7. Variation of deadspace CO2 tension with time.
Figure 7 shows a single respiratory cycle plot of exper-
imental and simulated dead space CO2 fraction proﬁles for
both ZT and 30 l/min NHFT conditions. When 30 l/min
NHFT was applied , dead space EtCO2 fell from 5.2 % to
about 4.3 % (17% decrement). It is observable from Figure
8 that for 60 l/min NHFT, model simulation under predicts
experimental EtCO2 by a margin of 8%. In morphology,

the simulated dead space CO2 fraction does not match very
well with the experimental measurements. This may be due
to the inherent perfect mixing of CO2 in the dead space
compartment (not realistic) which can be made physiological
by sub-dividing the dead space volume into several control
volumes. The area under the plots (Figures 7 and 8) contain
information about dead space CO2 volume. In quantitative
terms, mathematical simulation over-predicts the combined
inspiratory and expiratory CO2 volume for both ZT and 30
l/min NHFT by 8 %. On the same note, CO2 volume over the
respiratory cycle for 60 l/min NHFT is over-predicted by 4%.
IV.
DISCUSSION
Generally, the pulsatile pump setup differs from in vivo
conditions in two aspects, i.e., compliance mismatch (high
rigidity of piston barrel) and absence of O2 exchange mech-
anism. Since lung elasticity does not enter into the model
equations (1-5) and the pulsatile pump is able to deliver the
expected tidal volume, the inﬂuence of tissue elasticity is
eliminated. Given that the ratio of exchanged O2 volume to
tidal volume is quite small (1:25), the present experimental
results may therefore considerably approximate the results
for the case where an O2 absorption unit is included in the
pulsatile pump assembly. Simulation of no-oxygen condition,
however, has indicated a 5 % reduction in expired CO2 volume.
EtCO2 obtained via simulation is comparable to corre-
sponding experimental values for ZT and 30 l/min NHFT. For
all cases, slopes of capnogram phases II and IV as predicted
by simulation are lesser compared to experimental observations
(Figures 7 and 8). This may be due to the model compartmental
conﬁguration, which allows for full CO2 mixing at all times
whilst in the experimental setup (same as in vivo ) there is
an established CO2 front which takes a ﬁnite time to travel
along the airway. For 60 l/min NHFT, the model under-
predicts experimental EtCO2 by a change of 8 %. This may
be considered as a pronounced effect of the afore-mentioned
full CO2 mixing (not physiological), being heightened by high
levels of NHFT.
ZT EtCO2 of 5.2 % obtained from simulation corresponds
to a tension of 38 mmHg . This value is within physiologic
range (37 - 44 mmHg) for healthy adults [18]. The mean
alveolar CO2 fraction of 5.1 % is equivalent to alveolar CO2
tension (PACO2) of 39 mmHg, which agrees with the reported
physiologic range of 35 mmHg to 45 mmHg [19][20][21].
The rise in alveolar CO2 fraction for about 0.3 seconds into
inspiration is suggestive of rebreathing of CO2 from the dead

space unit [12].
Over a spontaneous breathing cycle, mean arterial CO2
pressure (PaCO2) is approximately the mean of PACO2. It has
been reported that the lungs can sufﬁciently engage in oxygen
exchange when it is in the state of apnoea, however in this
state, CO2 diffusing across the blood-gas barrier accumulates
in the lung and can potentially cause blood acidosis (PaCO2 >
45 mmHg). Several studies have mentioned an increase in
ventilatory rate in severe COPD patients experiencing hy-
percapnic events (PACO2 > 45 mmHg), which has been
interpreted as a homeostatic reaction to maintain PACO2 in
physiological range [14]. The mean PACO2 output from the
present model may potentially provide some insights into
expected PaCO2 for COPD related hypercapnic events under
NHFT conditions. On Figure 7, there is a 17 % fall in EtCO2
when 30 liters/min NHFT is applied. The washout volume
of CO2 during expiration, as predicted by the model is 2
ml - representing 15 % of the total expired CO2 volume for
spontaneous breathing. Experimentally, administration of 60
l/min NHFT yielded 24% reduction of ZT EtCO2 though
the simulated results over-predicts this change. It is however
noticeable that the amount of reduction in EtCO2 is dependent
on ﬂow rate at which NHFT is administered.
Spence et al. [11] used particle imaging velocimetry (PIV)
techniques to investigate ﬂow distribution in a silicone up-
per airway model under NHFT conditions. Their conclusion
was that recirculation currents observed in the nasopharynx
resulted in CO2 ﬂushing. Chatila et al. investigated exercise
tolerance of severe COPD patients and concluded that NHFT
leads to a gain in exercise endurance attributable to increased
oxygenation. Flushing of CO2 may increase the proportion of
alveolar ventilation in reference to minute ventilation, thereby
boosting oxygen exchange across the blood-gas interface in
the lungs [10]. In the light of these reports, the presented
two-compartment model , in spite of the outlined limitations,
appreciably predicts changes in EtCO2 of the bench-top model
capnogram for both zero-therapy and NHFT conditions.
V.
CONCLUSION
The results from this work show that it is possible to make
appreciably satisfactory predictions of the end tidal CO2 frac-
tion, alveolar CO2 tension and ﬂushed CO2 volume for nasal
high ﬂow therapy conditions though in terms of morphology,
results from the presented two-compartment model show a
width-wise disparity from physiologic CO2 proﬁles.
