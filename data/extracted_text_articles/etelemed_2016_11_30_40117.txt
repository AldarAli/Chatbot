Abstract – The free movement and mobility of citizens is a
fundamental principle of European Union (EU). Currently, the
data exchanges between social security institutions, including
healthcare
institutions
are
mostly
paper-based.
As
a
consequence, the process is time consuming, open to error and
lengthen the resolution time for the citizens. Efficient and
effective administrative cooperation between the institutions is,
as a consequence, critical. Therefore, EU regulations triggered
the
European
Exchange
of
Social
Security
Information
(EESSI) project for the European Commission (EC) to provide
the common secure framework that will facilitate electronic
exchanges between relevant institutions. The previous attempts
of implementing a similar system failed mostly because the
clerks are accustomed to work with paper documents and the
complex paperless solutions were perceived by the non-
technical end-users as a major chance. The clerks need a
system able to handle a partial snapshot of the European case,
developed around their current social, communication and
professional context, able to manage operational processes and,
at the same time, to provide an efficient decision support. The
present article describes the EESSI response to the main
technical
challenges
encountered:
the
decomposition
of
business processes in order to provide a distributed case
management solution, composition of business processes in
order to provide standard functions across all case types,
formalization of EESSI Business Messaging Protocol (BMP) in
order to provide semantic and syntactic interoperability and
case management visualization.

I.
INTRODUCTION
Organisations have always been using the case paradigm
to review and resolve various workflows like investigations,
service requests and more. Typically, there are documents
and artefacts associated with a case that are reviewed by
authorised people in order to reach a resolution and close the
case.
The case management model can be applied to diverse
processes
across
a
wide
spectrum
of
industries
and
government agencies. The normative practice that leads to
resolving and closing the case used to be encapsulated in
process and procedure handbooks, as well as “stored” in the
clerks’ community experience and best practice knowledge
wealth.
The next wave of case management, after the paper-
based one and often in parallel with it, was workflows that
sprang from last-generation software.
In
many
industries,
and
most
particularly
in
the
healthcare one, many organisations still find themselves
mired in IT systems that support only limited, if any,
coordination across programs. Dating back to the 1980s,
organisations
were
tethered
to
a
legacy
of
large,
disconnected transfer systems that took years to build, were
outdated at implementation, and could not interoperate with
one another. In the past, categorical funding requirements
effectively dictated separate infrastructures.
New coordinated models ask healthcare organisations to
work together and help connect people to services more
efficiently. In the past several years, as technology has
rapidly evolved, policymakers have begun to endorse the
operating models that support a vision of distributed dynamic
case management. These architectural guidelines recognize
the value of a service-oriented approach to IT, in which
technology components can be reused across organisations
and programs that have similar business processes. By using
dynamic case management applications, agencies can reduce
the cost and complexity of both acquiring and supporting
business applications.
Across the health care industry, information systems
have much to offer in managing costs and in improving the
quality of care. In addition to the embedded role of
information
technology
in
clinical
and
diagnostics
equipment, the systems are uniquely positioned to capture,
store, process, and communicate timely information to
decision makers for better coordination of healthcare at both
the individual and population levels.
At the most general level, a striking feature of the
healthcare industry is the level of diversity that characterizes
patients
(e.g.,
physical
traits
and
medical
history),
professional disciplines (e.g., doctors, nurses, administrators,
and
insurers),
treatment
options,
healthcare
delivery
processes, and interests of various stakeholder groups
(patients, providers, payers and regulators).
The healthcare delivery setting is characterized by a
tension between the need for orderly routines and the need
for sensitivity to variation in local conditions. As such, the
current
market
offering
in
healthcare
in
its
diverse
organizational
and
regulatory
settings
covers
several
orientations, among which:
-
Clinical Information Systems (CISs), which convert the
medical data in relevant information about the patient’s
health status. The current CISs' market covers most of
the healthcare provider operational needs in regard to
clinical services with some degree of support for point
of care clinical decisions. The Graphical User Interface
for documenting clinical cases is centred usually on

patient and patient banner in order to help the medical
personnel to easily identify the current patient clinical
context. This ensures a comprehensive standard-based
approach in regards to CISs functionalities, which is
regulated by the world’s leading medical informatics
organizations: HL7 EHRS [1], CCHIT [2], Eurorec [3],
etc. In this context, in order to analyse the current state
of the art, we need to structure the existing knowledge in
three domains: clinical pathway visualization, relevant
medical data visualization (medical and administrative)
and the combination of these two - medical data in
clinical context.
Clinical pathway visualization should be considered
from two points of view: from the point of view of
clinical pathway encoder or designer, and from the point
of view of the one who is executing the patient current
clinical pathway requested actions. Projects/solutions
like Protégé [4], Tallis Toolset [5], GUIDE [6], GLARE
[7], VisiGuide [8], AsbruView [9], etc., are suitable for
encoding and/or execution of a clinical pathway, but
with limited adoption by the healthcare providers.
Not necessary in relation with the clinical context,
projects like Graphical Summary of Patient Status [10],
Time Lines and LifeLines [11], PatternFinder [12],
KNAVE and KNAVE-II [13], VISITORS [14], VIE-
VISU [15], Interactive Parallel Bar Charts (IPBC) [16],
Gravi++ [17], and others moved in the direction of
visualizing the medical relevant data.
There are also very few combined approaches of
medical data in clinical context: Guideline Overview
Tool (GOT) [18], Midgaard [19], CareVis [20], NHS
Common User Interface [21], Visual-D [22], but most of
them failed to be widely adopted.

which need customisation to match healthcare industry

Software with OnBase [44].
The applications listed are characterised by various
degrees
of
strong
design
time
case
management
combined with strong runtime case management support
use cases. There are two variations of Dynamic Case
Management generic applications, variations described
below.
Strong design time case management – capability that
assumes that 90% or more of what the user will do is
developed, tested, and deployed prior to user getting
started. Case workers have less flexibility, e.g., adding
new tasks or involving other users, and the overall
process flow is well defined and more repeatable. These
use cases tend to be more production oriented; for
example,
managing
exceptions
for
financial
transactions.
Strong runtime case management support – use cases
where work is highly variable. The way in which the
case unfolds over time is far less predictable. The case
view is altered by user actions and system events, with
users who
are able to add
tasks, processes and
participants on the fly at the point of need.
The requirements that we had to meet for the EESSI
project were focused on cross-European Member State
cooperation between social security institutions through an
electronic platform capable of supporting the current and
future ability of all social security institutions to connect and
fulfil their legal obligations of social security coordination
through electronic exchange. Subsequent to market offer
analysis, it was determined that the optimal approach was for
the solution to be designed and developed in-house. The
challenges and the way responses were elaborated to meet
them are described in the next sections.
The paper structure, section by section, is presented
below: Section II describes the business area that we are
focusing on, public health and social security data exchange,
Section III describes the system principles and high level
architecture, Section IV describes the main challenges in the
project implementation, Section V presents the response to
the previously described challenges, Section VI refer to the
project adoption, Section VII brings up the conclusions and
future work and Appendix 1 depicts the system main
features.
II.
PUBLIC HEALTH DATA EXCHANGE IN THE CONTEXT
OF EESSI
Better cooperation between social security institutions is
a necessity in an increasingly mobile society in order for EU
citizens to exercise their right to free movement and secure
their social security rights.
The EU provides common rules to protect social security
rights of citizens when moving within Europe. The European
rules
of
coordination
make
sure
that
social
security
203

eTELEMED 2016 : The Eighth International Conference on eHealth, Telemedicine, and Social Medicine (with DIGITAL HEALTHY LIVING 2016 / MATH 2016)

institutions of the EU plus Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein
and Switzerland, all communicate with each other to ensure
social security rights are addressed correctly.
Currently, these data exchanges between the social
security institutions are mostly paper-based and as a
consequence are time consuming, open to error and lengthen
the resolution time for the citizens, partly due to the method
of exchange.
Efficient
and
effective
administrative
cooperation
between the institutions is therefore critical and as a
consequence
the
revisions
of
the
European
rules
of
coordination that came into force on May 1st, 2010 stated that
"The transmission of data between the institutions or the
liaison bodies shall be carried out by electronic means either
directly or indirectly through the access points under a
common
secure
framework
that
can
guarantee
the
confidentiality and protection of exchanges of data."[45].
Therefore, the aforementioned requirement of the EU
regulations triggered the EESSI project for the EC to provide
the common secure framework that will facilitate electronic
exchanges between relevant institutions.
The overall vision for the EESSI project is to deliver an
electronic platform that will support the current and future
ability of all social security institutions to connect and fulfil
their legal obligations of social security coordination through
electronic exchange.
The EESSI platform has to enable secure exchanges for
all relevant business messages that guarantee confidentiality,
integrity and availability, and to have a sufficient level of
validation. It should ensure wherever possible the right
message is sent to the correct recipient on the first occasion
at a time that is suitable to all institutions and contributes to
the optimization of social security coordination.
EESSI is a cross-sectorial platform with competences in
the area of public health. The main EESSI use cases in the
area of public health are the following:
-
Entitlement for short or long term healthcare related
benefits;
-
Validation of the person’s right to healthcare related
benefits during his/hers temporary stays in another
Member State;
-
Establishing the reimbursement rates for healthcare
services;
-
Cost
reimbursement
based
and
fixed
amounts
reimbursement or healthcare services;
-
Certificate
the
incapacity
of
work
and
cost
reimbursement for incapacity of work;
-
Request for medical examinations or administrative
checks, etc.

PRINCIPLES AND HIGH LEVEL ARCHITECTURE
Figure 1 below, provides a high level view of the
conceptual
architecture.
This
section
will
provide
an
explanation of the application domains in the conceptual
architecture.
Figure 1. Conceptual architecture diagram
The diagram depicts the conceptual principles on how the
inter-connection is achieved:
-
A data exchange network interconnecting national
administrations;
-
National institutions are linked via national networks
to the EESSI Access Points;
-AP establishes the border between the national and
international domains of EESSI end-to-end network.
The APs are the gateways that enforce the stateless
messaging protocol; they check that the structure and
the semantic of the EESSI business messages are
correct. A stateless protocol is a communications
protocol that treats each request as an independent
transaction that is unrelated to any previous request
so that the communication consists of independent
pairs of request and response. A stateless protocol
does
not
require
the
server
to
retain
session
information or status about each communications
partner for the duration of multiple requests. In
contrast, a protocol, which requires keeping of the
internal state on the server is known as a stateful
protocol.
The main principle in building the EESSI platform is
“smart endpoints and dumb pipes” [46] [59], which means
that in most of the cases, when a National Application
receives a request, it will apply the logic as appropriate and
will produce a response and the AP will perform a minimal
stateless
validation.
The
diagram
depicts
the
two
fundamental domains of the EESSI network:
-
The International Domain that hosts components,
which are common to all participant countries. It is
itself divided in two sub-domains:
the Central
Service Node (CSN) – designating the components
that will be hosted centrally (e.g., hosted by EC) and
the AP – a domain that holds components common
to all countries, developed centrally and assumed to
be hosted within each participant country. The
components under the CSN and the APs, connected
electronically as one system environment, constitute
the EESSI Platform, a secure, reliable, pan-European
data exchange platform;

eTELEMED 2016 : The Eighth International Conference on eHealth, Telemedicine, and Social Medicine (with DIGITAL HEALTHY LIVING 2016 / MATH 2016)

-
The National Domain that hosts national specific
elements of the network can also be divided in two
sub-domains: the National Application (NA) and
National Gateways (NG).
The NG are the National components that
specifically integrate NA with the international
domain and the Institutions’ Domain – where the
NA of the social security institutions resides.
The NAs are the actual “client”; being themselves
direct instruments of the “end-users”, the clerks.
For a faster adoption of the EESSI platform and in order
to help the Member States (MS) to provide better services for
the citizens, the EC decided to provide an open source
Distributed Case Management Solution called Reference
Implementation for National Application (RINA). RINA
consists in a collection of infrastructure and communication
services, foundation, repository and publishing services,
business, integration and user interface services, which will
provide for clerks and their organizations, the tools to
implement the EESSI data exchange protocol based on
Structured Electronic Documents (SED).
IV.
CHALLENGES
The main challenges are generated by the fact that EESSI
is a peer-to-peer network where the International Domain of
the platform, especially the Apps, are just the enablers of the
communication between NAs, completely transparent from
the business perspective.
Formalization of EESSI vision started about 10 years
ago, and part of the project challenges at that time are still
present in the nowadays industry:
-
Formalization
of
EESSI
Business
Messaging
Protocol in order to provide semantic and syntactic
interoperability.
One of the main outcomes of EESSI is the
interoperability standard. The magnitude of the
project is emphasized by the following facts: multi-
sectorial data-exchange, around 110 businesses use
cases (BUC) with at least two application roles
involved, and around 320 business documents/SEDs.
-
Decomposition of business processes in order to
provide a distributed case management solution and
composition of business processes in order to
provide standard functions across all case types.
All the EESSI business processes/case types are
foreseen to be distributed and they involve from the
applicative software perspective multiple application
roles (e.g., case owner, counterparty, liaison body,
etc.). Being a distributed system, the decoupling of
the application roles in EESSI needs to be aligned to
the EC guidelines in terms of messaging, more
precisely, web services and ebMS3 [47] - AS4
profile
[48].
Most
of
the
Business
Process
Management Systems [49] (BPMS) are able to
decompose the processes but they are not natively
able to decouple the application roles through web
services. The composition of business processes in
order to provide standard functions across all case
types is available in the BPMS tools build on top of
Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN) [50]
[2] but the complexity and the multitude of the
administrative processes in EESSI makes BPMN as
it is difficult to use.
-
Case
visualization
and
case
visualization
in
distributed environment.
It is obvious that the level of adoption of case
management
solutions
in
the
institutions
participating in EESSI is quite limited and the main
barrier in adopting it comes from the fact that
implementation does not take into account the end
user practices and their context.
The clerks are accustomed to work with paper
documents
and
previous
attempts
to
create
a
distributed paperless solution have failed due to the
magnitude of change perceived by the often non-
technical end-users mainly because of Graphic User
Interface (GUI) complexity.
Therefore, the clerks need a Distributed
Case
Management
System
able
to
handle
a
partial
snapshot of the international case, developed around
their current social, communication and professional
context, able to manage operational processes and, at
the same time, to provide an efficient decision
support.
V.
EESSI RESPONSE TO DISTRIBUTED CASE
MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES
This section presents the EESSI response to the
previously mentioned challenges.
A.
Formalising the EESSI Business Messaging Protocol
The data exchange protocol of EESSI consists in a
collection of separate specifications that can be grouped in
the areas of technical messaging and business messaging.
The technical messaging is aligned with EC messaging
guidelines and consists in the ebMS3.0/AS4 EESSI profile
and is physically implemented through XML Schema
Definitions [51] (XSDs) and additional EESSI specific
technical messaging validation rules.
The business messaging consists of three separate
specifications:
-
SEDs - physically implemented in around 320
XSDs,
-
Standard Business Document Header [52] (SBDH) -
specified through EESSI SBDH Implementation
Guide and
physically implemented
through
an
EESSI constrained SBDH XSDs,
-
The BUCs, which consist in around 110 descriptive
documents including BPMN representation of the
BUCs.
It is important to understand that the SED and SBDH
schemas
validate
many
of
the
business
conformance
requirements of EESSI, but are too general to enforce the
data exchange in the context of Business Use Cases (BUC)
[53]. This introduces genuine interoperability risks into the
business domain. To address this, EESSI created a business
messaging standard known as the EESSI BMP.
205
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2016.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-470-1
eTELEMED 2016 : The Eighth International Conference on eHealth, Telemedicine, and Social Medicine (with DIGITAL HEALTHY LIVING 2016 / MATH 2016)

The EESSI BMP is the minimum standard by which all
NA must adhere to produce business messages that can be
accepted as fully validated transactions within the EESSI
domain.
The EESSI BMP is a specification able to define
constraints for business and data validation, the common
denominators of EESSI through the integration of the key
aspects of BUCs, SBDH and SED physical models.
The chosen approach for implementing the BMP is made
through XSD constraints. XML technology is already an
inherent part of the EESSI domain and continuing its use for
the
BMP
does
not
introduce
unnecessary
additional
technologies.
In EESSI, this technology is used by two application
domains with two different scopes:
-
The National Applications, the messages’ authoring
systems, by directly using the constrained XSD
schemas of each defined transaction for producing
valid messages and
-
AP,
the
common
denominator
of
EESSI,
by
validating any received message against a single
constrained XSD schema for each transaction.
The following elements of the SBDH along with the SED
itself will be constrained though the BMP: BUC type, BUC
version, participant role (the role of the sender and receiver
participants),
number
of
participants
(unilateral
vs
multilateral case types), case action, SED type, SED XSD
version, SED version (if multiple SED versions are allowed)
and attachments allowance (if the attachments are permitted
for the transaction).
The BMP is a transaction oriented specification that
defines
specific
authoring
rules
for
a
specific
SED
transaction, for a specific participant role, in the context of a
specific BUC.
Each identified transaction will constrain the SBDH and
SED schemas through a single XSD schema definition that
will import and redefine the aforementioned schemas.
Business messages that validate against this constrained
version of the transaction are, by definition, also valid SED
instances and valid SBDH and therefore, a fully validated
transaction within the EESSI domain.
In Figure 2, a BPMN collaboration diagram, illustrates
how the transactions are identified, for a specific participant
role, in the context of a BUC.
Within the EESSI domain there are four main business level
exchange patterns that can occur between the participant
roles. These are:
-
A Case Owner sends a SED to a Counterparty;
-
A Counterparty sends a SED to the Case Owner;
-
A Counterparty sends a SED to another
Counterparty
-
A Case Owner forwards a SED to a Case Owner.
The BMP ensures these patterns are enforced within the
context of BUCs though constraining the Sender and
Receiver Roles in line with the BUC specifications.
Figure 2. BPMN collaboration diagram
The syntax that is issued to uniquely identify each
transaction with in the EESSI domain is the following:
[BUC Short Name]-[BUC Version]-[Sender Role]-[Receiver
Role]-[Case Action]-[SED Type] (e.g., S_BUC_19-1.0-
CaseOwner-Counterparty-Start-S080.xsd).
For exemplification of the concept, a Public Heath case
type will be briefly introduced. The illustrative example
consists in a Healthcare Services Reimbursement Based on
Actual Cost (S_BUC_19). The sequence diagram in Figure 3
bellow illustrates the interactions between the Case Owner
and the corresponding Counterparty.
This case deals with the business transactions of a
reimbursement based on actual costs whereby the Member
State of Residence or Stay claims the reimbursement to the
Competent Member State on behalf a Creditor Institution.
This case is used where the Institution in the Member
State of Residence or Stay provides benefits when the
treatment was necessary due to an accident at work or an
occupational disease.
The Creditor Institution's Liaison Body (Case Owner)
acting on behalf of a Creditor Institution (Claimant) or for
itself sends a Reimbursement Claim for Benefits in Kind to
the
corresponding
Debtor
Institution's
Liaison
Body
(Counterparty).
The Debtor Institution's Liaison Body (Counterparty)
accepts, disputes or rejects the claim and notices it to the
Creditor Institution's Liaison Body (Case Owner).
In this aforementioned exemplification, the Case Owner
is the Creditor Institution's Liaison Body of the Member
State of Residence or Stay that notifies the claim of a
reimbursement payment on the basis of actual costs on
behalf of a Creditor Institution and the Counterparty is the
Debtor Institution's Liaison Body of the Competent Member
State that replies for the claim of a reimbursement payment
on the basis of actual cost on behalf of a Debtor Institution.
Figure 3 represents the sequence diagram that illustrates
few transactions allowed between two the participant roles,
in the context of S_BUC_19:

B.
EESSI Standard Business Document Header
The Standard Business Document Header (SBDH) is an
UN/CEFACT
[54]
standard
that
enables
business
applications to exchange documents using a consistent
interface.
In the EESSI context, the SBDH enables the integration
of Access Points with National Applications, with National
Gateways or any other business-to-business infrastructure by
providing
consistent
correlation
data
about
a
specific
business document to be used across the EESSI ecosystem. It
also enables any National Application to determine the
logical routing and the logical processing of a SED/business
document.
The EESSI implementation of SBDH standardizes the
data presentation, the data elements within the SBDH that
can be easily located and leveraged by multiple applications.
The SBDH is created before the transport routing header is
applied to the business document and is retained after the
transport header is removed. SBDH data can be used also by
transport applications like AP to determine the routing
header since it does contain the sender, receivers and
relevant document metadata. It can also be used by the
national applications to determine the appropriate process
instance to which the business document needs to be
attached.
This EESSI SBDH Implementation Guide clarifies the
function, design and implementation considerations of the
SBDH in the context of EESSI.
The EESSI SBDH implementation guide deals with the
sender and receivers identification together with their role in
the case processing (process owner and counterparty), the
unique case identifier, the case type, the version of the case
definition,
the
sensitivity
flag
of
the
case
(medical
information
case
or
protected
person),
the
document
identification attributes like SED type, schema version, the
unique id of the SED, the SED instance version, the creation
date, the attached files’ metadata and the case action to be
performed (start case, new/update document to an existing
case, forward SED).
C.
RINA Distributed Case Management Visualization
RINA is a Distributed Case Management Solution and
the purpose of case visualization is to convert the case
related data, the SEDs, in relevant information about the case
status according to the main goal, which is case resolution.
The process of conversion from disparate data into useful
information
should
be
analysed
at
least
from
three
perspectives:
-
Communication;
-
Graphical user interface;
-
Business use case or case type definition.
The
SEDs-provided
information
used
by
the
case
management visualization process could be grouped in two
categories:
the
social,
demographic
and
administrative
information and case specific information.
The
case
management
view
should
represent
the
operational decision support system for the clerk. It is
essential to visualize the current case and its corresponding
case definition; also, to know what the existing exchanged
SEDs are, what the contextual details (like medical history)
are, what the social, demographic and administrative details
are, etc. The progress observed in the case execution, the
definition of the case with specific actions, stages, conditions
and so on and nevertheless the best practices of the specific
case type, should be accessible.
Figure 4. Case management - Timeline view
The primary goal of the Timeline-based visualization
[58] into the RINA Case Management System, as illustrated
in Figure 4, is to offer a comprehensive picture of the case,
both real-time as well as historically, using textual and
graphical means, and to sustain, in a task-oriented approach
and based on decision support algorithms, the case progress.
Another important characteristic of this approach is the
fast development and reusability of administrative SEDs,
achieved through an external component, part of a Business
Process Management Solution (BPMS) also used to execute
the cases that encode and organize the decisions and action
tasks for clerks.
A BPM-based case management solution in social
security and public health offers the benefits of configurable
workflows for both the medical areas as well as the
administrative sub-processes.

Figure 5. RINA notification module
The RINA notifications, presented in Figure 5, are also
part of the process definition by the fact that the process can
be started based on a received message from a counterparty
institution. Being a Distributed Case Management Solution,
RINA notifications are focusing mostly on the collaboration
with partner institutions. The application is able to notify the
case assigned users when a new case is received, when a
SED is received or updated, when a case is closed by the
case initiator, but also when a user is assigned to a case by
his supervisor or when a case defined alarm is triggered.
RINA
overcomes
the
problem
raised
from
the
unavailability of easily interpretable guides within existing
applications and takes the recording of clinical information
beyond historical and statistical reasons, by being a proactive
solution that provides to the clerk strong decisional support.
RINA targets directly any clerk or medical personnel
involved in public health cases.
The central piece of this approach is the Timeline,
representing a historical view of SEDs disposed along a
vertical time axis as thumbnails, which offers a clear and
actionable insight into the case history, as presented in
Figure 5.
As such, one of the main benefits of this approach, when
compared with the tried and proven case management
interfaces, is represented by the possibility of dynamically
loading a large volume of data that is time-sorted, meaning
that most recent documents will be shown first, allowing
clerks to have a quick overview of the case status. Moreover,
the timeline provides a unified browsing experience for a
volume of heterogeneous data that was collected at different
points in time.
The pervasiveness of computing platforms and their
wide-scale adoption has led to the emergence of several new
methodologies for user interface design that have been
widely embraced by the public.
One of the relatively new means of data presentation is
the timeline. In order to provide a gentle learning curve and
natural grouping of information, RINA GUI is developed
around familiarity gained from social networking services
like Facebook and suitability of this approach to the social
security and public health domain, and therefore, embraced
the established graphical presentation patterns.
While not a new idea with regards to the presentation of
public health information, timelines have been embraced
with the advent of widely used social networks that
popularized them. As such, they can be considered an
already mature and well-known means for data presentation,
significantly reducing the steepness of the learning curve.
VI.
EESSI ADOPTION – CASE STUDY AND EXPERIMENTS
To ensure adoption, a collaborative and incremental
approach has been selected for the design and development
of EESSI.
By adopting a project approach based on successive
incremental iterations, as well as close collaboration with
stakeholders that have well defined roles in all project
phases, EESSI ensures that Member States and designated
sectorial experts actively contribute to the application design
and development.
Healthcare experts and Member States representatives
(clerks) have the opportunity to provide input to BUCs
through the Business Playground, which is a central web-
based platform, to be used as a "playground" by the relevant
involved
stakeholders
in
order
to
fulfil
three
major
objectives:
-
To review and confirm how the business use cases are to
be implemented in the EESSI system;
-
To facilitate the re-validation and prioritisation of the
Business
Layer
(BL)
requirements.
Using
the
playground environment Member States representatives
are able to review and provide feedback about how the
business use case should be implemented. The BL
requirements are revalidated and prioritised based on the
feedback and requests from the user representatives;
-
To provide a platform for execution of the Dry-Run
activities based on voluntary involvement of Member
States representatives (clerks). The Dry-Run activities
are primarily aimed at confirming the business processes
with real cases, and the corresponding SEDs that are to
be used within the business processes.
The BUCs are validated and agreed on as they will provide
the playground business content to be modelled
and
validated. They are also the main vehicle to be used (together
with the data modelling efforts) on agreeing on the approach
to tackle the points on which there are different opinions.
Bonita BPM [55] is used to implement, in stages, the various
processes that are being used in the BUCs, to validate if there
is some scenario/branch that cannot be executed in a
workflow engine. During this phase agreement is reached
over the level of IT implementation of the case (what is
implemented in the workflow engine and what is left for the
clerk to execute manually).
The Business Playground appears as an essential element
taking into consideration the complexity level implied by

eTELEMED 2016 : The Eighth International Conference on eHealth, Telemedicine, and Social Medicine (with DIGITAL HEALTHY LIVING 2016 / MATH 2016)

performing business processes in a distributed environment
of 32 countries, 8 social security sectors, with over 10.000
institutions to be connected. Having a Business Playground
in place is an appropriate measure to adopt in the context of
challenges
raised
by
the
integration
of
national-level
applications with the AP.
A strong collaboration between the EC and the Member
States as well as significant involvement of the end users in
the development of the solution is a key factor in making the
development of EESSI a success.
The playground work stream is being delivered in three
phases – each phase delivering a number of BUCs (as
illustrated
in
the
below
diagram)
and
providing
an
increasingly functionally rich NA. Additional details are
presented in Figure 6.
Figure 6. EESSI Playground phases
RINA is in the last year of industrial implementation as a
multitenant/cloud solution and the underlying development
technologies are: Bonita BPM [55], Elasticsearch [56] and
AngularJS [57].
The sizing of Playground and Dry Run iterations is listed
below:
Play Ground Environment:
-
Number of RINA environments: 6
-
Number of users: 103
-
Total number of cases performed by participating
institutions during the first two Play Ground phases:
2.830.
Dry Run Environment:
-
Number of RINA environments:
16 (each RINA
institution represents one country)
-
Number of users: 240
-
Total number of cases performed by participating
institutions during the first two Dry Run phases: 13.130
More than 95% of the started cases in the Dry Run
environments were successfully closed fully electronically.
The two mentioned environments: playground and dry
run, are also involved in collecting feedback on RINA
features using the EC change management process.
VII.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
RINA
overcomes
the
problem
raised
from
the
unavailability of easily interpretable guides within existing
applications and takes the recording of medical information
beyond historical and statistical reasons, by being a proactive
solution that is giving a strong decisional support to the
clerk. RINA targets directly any clerk or medical personnel
involved in public health cases.
The central piece of this approach is the Timeline,
representing a historical view of SEDs disposed along a
vertical time axis as thumbnails, which offers a clear and
actionable insight into the case history.
As such, one of the main benefits of this approach, when
compared with the tried and proven case management
interfaces, is represented by the possibility of dynamically
loading a large volume of data that is time-sorted. Moreover,
the timeline provides a unified browsing experience for a
volume of heterogeneous data that was collected at different
points in time.
In order to provide a gentle learning curve and natural
grouping of information, RINA GUI is developed around
familiarity gained from social networking services like
Facebook and suitability of this approach to the social
security and public health domain, and therefore, embraced
the established graphical presentation patterns.
The tests conducted so far show a high level of
acceptance from users (healthcare domain experts and clerks
from a significant number of countries and institutions).
Most Member States concerned are currently considering the
options available for integration and EC surveys show that a
large majority to use RINA, or at least one of its layers.
The next period will be dedicated to supporting the
decision making at the Member State and institution level so
that integration is planned on the most efficient option for
each institution, taking into account on the one hand
applicable RINA features and, on the other hand, specific
environment characteristics, such as the existence of a
centralised e-government infrastructure, the existence of an
identity management solution, the technology used for
existing national applications, specific national requirements
regarding
security
and
usability,
specific
national
requirements for case routing and/or related to the SED
content.

APPENDIX 1 - RINA MAIN FEATURES
Below, we selected a number of illustrative core features
implemented by RINA:
-
Search management features
-
Free text search -
(free-text search in fuzzy or exact manner on case
metadata in order to identify a case or a group of
cases)
-
Structured search
(RINA allows users to define, modify or delete
structured searches using visual search expressions
and
to
persist
users
searches
as
pre-defined
searches )
-
Applying a predefined search
(Users are able to quickly select and apply a
predefined search in order to minimize searching
effort.)
-
Refine predefined search results
(After the system has filtered the cases based on a
user’s predefined search request, the User can read
the list of filtered cases. The User can also use the
free text search to further refine the returned
results)
-
Configure Search Result
(Users have the possibility to configure for each
case type: the list of columns that will be returned
by the search engine, and the order of the columns
and of the results.)
-
Case management features
-
Create case
(RINA allows a User to create a case through
accessing a hierarchical structure of case types.
RINA retains (per session) the last case type
instantiated to enable to quickly creation of another
case.)
-
Determine Exchange Partners
(RINA persists the case participant(s) for each case
instance RINA allows the User to view the current
case participant(s) and any historical changes.)
-
Case available actions
RINA provides Users with a list of available actions
(tasks) related to a specific case instance depending
on the state of the case - e.g., forward, create,
update - and for any case action executed by a User
RINA updates the case state. It also display the
available action list upon the change of case state to
ensure that Users can only perform actions that are
correct based the case state.
-
Execute action
(A User has the possibility to select one action from
the action list presented to him.)
-
Group Case Actions
(RINA provides logical grouping of case actions at
case level or SED level and could provide further
logical grouping of case actions as case level. RINA
it also offer the possibility to filter case actions by
grouping)
-
Case Importance/ Criticality
(A User is able to specific the level of Importance
and Criticality of a case and can change the
importance and criticality of a case at time during
the case. This can be done for more than one case
at a time.)
-
Case Alarm
(A User is able to set or delete an alarm by which
they expect an action to have occurred. The user is
notified when an alarm expires)
-
Create SED
(RINA allows the persistence of documents in
multiple draft states)
-
Create Portable Documents
211
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2016.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-470-1
eTELEMED 2016 : The Eighth International Conference on eHealth, Telemedicine, and Social Medicine (with DIGITAL HEALTHY LIVING 2016 / MATH 2016)

(RINA can create Portable Documents (PD) were
the content of the PD can be fully derived from SED
content)
-
SED Validation
(RINA is able to display document validation errors
in a clear and logical fashion, allowing the User to
navigate directly to the source of the error from the
error description.)
-
Manage Document Views
(RINA offers multiple views for Users to view sent
and received documents, these can be filtered by:
direction, partner, type, status. Users are able to
clearly visualise draft documents from sent/received
documents and documents that are in different
document states. RINA it also offers access to view
all document versions)
-
Manage document attachments
(Users are able to manage the attachments through
attaching and detaching files. The attachments can
be added at case level or at SED level. RINA can
restrict the type of attachments allowed and can
also restrict the access to attachments of a certain
business type where necessary. RINA allows Users
the access to read/open attachments directly)
-
Print Documents
(RINA allows a user to choose an action that will
render a document as a printable form (PSED))
-
Manage comments
(The User is able to create, read or delete
comments (case notes) at document level or case
level. RINA persists and display the author and time
of each comment and it also ensure that only the
author of a comment (or a user with special
permissions) can delete a comment)
-
Case assignment
(New Cases (both created locally & received) are
automatically
assigned
to
Users
using
a
configurable
case
assignment
rules
(via
the
administration console). A User (with permission) is
able to assign a case to users or groups of users
that are part of the local organisation and also is
able to unassigned/ reassign a case to users or
groups
of
users
that
are
part
of
the
local
organisation. A User (without permission) is able to
request to a User (with permission) to assign a
specific case to them. A User is able to assign/
unassigned/ reassign more than one case at a time.
RINA ensures that only assigned users can actively
work on/progress a case and is restricting access to
certain case types where necessary (e.g., sensitive
cases)
-
Document Translation
(A user is able to translate documents content (any
free text elements) into any of the EU official
languages. Translated document content is not
persisted)
-
User Settings
(RINA provides users with possibility to save
(persist) user preferences (such as view style, order
style etc.))
-
Notification management features
-
Generate notifications
(The notification management requirements cover
all aspects of case notification in RINA.)
-
View Notifications
(Every time an event condition is fulfilled, RINA
notifies the assigned Users of the case. Each
notification has associated a type that is either:
Error, Alert or Information.)
-
Notification Actions
(A User should be able to take logical actions direct
from the notification)
-
Filter Notifications
(RINA offers the possibility to filter notifications
based on type and status and to navigate the
notifications’ timeline.)
-
Notification Summary
(RINA provides count of notification by types in the
notification panel and the case level views. The
counts be automatically re-calculated when User
take actions on the notifications. A user is also able
to
receive
anytime
in
every
module
of
the
application the delivery of a new notification.)
-
Suppress/Unsuppressed notification
(The user is able to suppress a notification so that it
is not taken into account anymore and also to
unsuppressed a previously suppressed notification
so that it is taken into account anymore.)
-
Mark notification as read/unread
(The user can mark a notification as read or unread
so that the next time the notifications are displayed
the read/unread state is preserved)
-
Administration features
-
Administration Console
(All administrator tasks are provided through a
dedicated administrator console)
-
User Management and organization structure
(An administrator is able to define organization
units, together with departments having any level of
nesting and also able to define users or to refer
them
from
an
external
identity
management
repository.
An
administrator
is
also
able
to
configure the default user settings)
-
Authorisation policies
(For each case type, the administrator is able to
configure what users or groups are allowed to
create, to execute, to administer or to audit new
cases. These are corresponding to the regular user
roles: Clerk, Supervisor and Auditor)
-
Audit
(The administrator is able to configure what events
the system needs to audit. The audit is also reflected
to all main resources exposed by the functional
modules, for all possible operations: create, read,
update, delete and execute.)

(All the modules of RINA populates a centralised
log
available
for
RINA
Administrators.
The
administrator is able to configure the level of
logging: trace, debug, info, warn, error and fatal.)
-
Notification Management
