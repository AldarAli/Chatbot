Abstract—Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks (IWSN) are 
preferred over bulky wired networks in industrial monitoring 
and automation. These sensors are used to access locations, 
which are technically unreachable. The use of IWSN not only 
reduced the cost of automation systems but also played a 
significant role in alarm management by real time data 
transfer. ZigBee and WirelessHART are already deployed 
protocols for IWSN. ISA100.11a developed by International 
Society of Automation was specially designed for IWSN. The 
main features of this standard are low power consumption, real 
time fast data transfer, scalability, security, reliability, co-
existence with other network architectures and robustness in 
harsh industrial environments. To achieve these features, these 
protocols use layer structure, which provides security, fast and 
reliable data transfer. IEEE 802.15.4 is used at its physical 
layer with variable data slots. This paper presents the results of 
the simulation of ISA100 done on Pymote framework which is 
extended by one of the authors. A test bed is implemented in 
the lab using the Yokogawa field devices. This paper discusses 
the simulated and practical results obtained from operation of 
ISA100.11a.

 INTRODUCTION 
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) [1][2] are small 
sensors that are deployed in remote locations to sense 
particular conditions and send information pertaining to 
these conditions to a Central Control Room (CCR). WSN 
are ad hoc in nature and their number is often large. They 
work with limited resources and are usually non replaceable. 
WSN have endless applications; it can be used in defense to 
monitor borders. They are also used by environmentalists to 
monitor  environmental changes such as temperature and 
humidity in certain regions. For industries, WSNs can sense 
temperature, pressure, etc. of certain devices. WSN have 
certain limitations such as low range, small battery size, and 
non-reusable structure which require a very resource 
efficient algorithm. Industrial Wireless Sensor Network 
(IWSN) evolved from WSN and are specially designed 
keeping in mind the demands and nature of industry [1]-[4]. 
IWSNs use replaceable batteries and generally have 
wider range than WSNs. IWSNs have an edge over 
traditional wired structures since they can be installed easily 
anywhere in industry without heavy support structures. 
IWSNs can also work efficiently where wired networks are 
technically not installable such as on moving or rotating 
objects. 
Another important industrial requirement is the stability 
of the system. The system should be stable and easy to 
handle and maintain [5]. Also, deployed networks should be 
reliable and secure with high data rate support. Many 
protocols 
are 
developed 
that 
support 
the 
above 
functionalities. Zigbee is a wireless open global standard 
which satisfies the unique needs of low power, low cost and 
wireless mobile-to-mobile (M2M) networking. It is also 
used in IWSNs [6]. Zigbee is standardized by Zigbee 
alliance which consists of more than 300 companies. It can 
support star, mesh and tree topologies [7][8].  
Another developed protocol is Highway Addressable 
Remote 
Transducer 
Protocol 
commonly 
known 
as 
WirelessHART 
and 
approved 
by 
International 
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). WirelessHART is 
simple, secure, reliable, and uses TDMA with mesh 
topology. HART, like OSI model, uses many layers that add 
to security, integrity and reliability of the system [9]. The 
power consumption of HART is low compared to Zigbee 
with high security standard. 
ISA100, 
designed 
by 
International 
Society 
of 
Automation, supports high data rates up to 250 Kbps. 
Security and Integrity is provided by layered architecture. 
6LoWPAN, used in network layer, provides efficient routing 
and also enables IWSN to co-exist with other IWSN 
protocols. At the level of Physical Layer, IEEE 802.1.5.4 is 
used, which uses Carrier Sense Multiple Access with 
Collision Avoidance (CSMA-CA) [4][10][11]. ISA works 
on 2.4 GHz free band with 16 channels. Transmitter 
complexity is significantly decreased by using Orthogonal 
Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (O-QPSK), which avoids the 
zero state and thus has a constant envelope transmission 
[12][13]. 
ISA100 
uses 
the 
following 
layers 
to 
optimize 
performance: 
1. A graphical user interface at its application layer. 
2. For fast and reliable data transfer, UDP is used at the 
transport layer. 
3. At the network layer, IPV6 over Low power Wireless 
Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) which can work 
with other networks. 
4. At the data link layer, variable slot scheme is used. 
5. IEEE 802.15.4 is used at the physical layer, which is 
spectrally efficient and minimizes collisions between 
the adjacent nodes. 
IWSN protocols usually use two type of devices to send 
data to CCR.  
1) Field devices whose prime function is to sense the 
data and transmit it.  
2) Gateway devices are responsible for receiving data 
and providing reliable transmission to CCR. Field devices 
can also reroute the packet to gateway devices. Far end 
devices usually transfer data over more than one hop.

This paper provides a lab test evaluation of both indoor 
and outdoor Zigbee, WirelessHART and ISA100-based 
systems. The kit presented in Figure 1 is used for Zigbee 
testing. Zigbee tests are performed on Memsic WSN kits. 
The topologies and results are compared. The remaining part 
of the paper simulates the ISA100 on Pymote, which is a 
Python based framework for WSN simulation and was 
extended to support our simulation. 
This paper is described in four sections. Section II 
describes the lab test by using Zigbee and WilessHart 
protocol. Section III presents ISA100 simulation. The 
purpose of the ISA100 is to find the appropriate range and 
terrain of the IWSN. It also describes different methods 
related to wireless communications. Discussion and results 
are also presented. Finally, we conclude this study in 
Section IV. 
II. 
LAB TEST 
A. Zigbee Test 
Zigbee is currently the oldest and most widely used 
WSN protocol. Many vendors provide Zigbee-based 
products [7]. Memsic Inc. is one such manufacturer, whose 
devices can be used for conducting outdoor tests. These 
devices are able to sense voltage, humidity, temperature and 
pressure in a particular location. Their WSN kit provides an 
end-to-end enabling platform for the creation of wireless 
sensor networks. A windows application called MoteView is 
provided as an interface between a user and the deployed 
sensor network. MoteView also provides the tools to 
simplify deployment and monitoring. It also makes it easy to 
connect to a database, to analyze, and to graph sensor 
readings. It also provides node health statistics in terms of 
transmission quality, number of drop packets, retries, etc. 
The topology for our experiment is shown in Figure 1. 
Devices numbered 2091, 2094, 2103, 2105, 2107 as 
presented in TABLE I. act as sensor devices which sense the 
above mentioned parameters and send them to gateway 
device GW. 
Upon receiving the data, the GW displays the transmitted 
values in a GUI and alarms are raised if some parameter 
makes an abrupt change. For illustration, one of the 
collected parameters containing humidity and temperature 
(Humtemp) is shown in TABLE I.  
At the start of the test, packets started flowing from 
sensor devices to the gateway device at regular intervals. 
TABLE I.  shows the Humtemp data received from sensor 
devices averaged over an hour.  
 
 
 
Figure 1. Topology for humidity/temperature measurements. 
 
B. WirelessHART Test 
Another industrial protocol is WirelessHART, which can 
coexist with other networks. This test is performed on 
Emerson devices, which use HART as shown in 0. Like 
other devices, the kit composes of sensor and gateway 
devices, where the used topology is shown in Figure 2, 
which serve to collect and transfer data.  
The HART uses mesh protocol and when the setup is 
turned on, each device is connected to every other device in 
its range. The link configuration and stability according to 
the device tags is shown in Figure 2, which explains the link 
of gateway with the sensor nodes. It also shows the number 
of neighbor sensors against every device as well. The 
reliability of the link and Received Signal Strength Intensity 
(RSSI) is also depicted.  
C. ISA100 Test 
The purpose of this experiment is to find the appropriate 
range and terrain of the IWSN. Instruments used for testing 
are the Yokogawa wireless kit shown in Figure 3, which 
consist of field and gateway devices. If the path stability or 
reliability decreases as a result of any environmental change, 
the device will try to switch to an alternative path.

Figure 3. Yokogawa field device kit. 
 
The test was performed in two terrains, namely Plane 
ground and Rough ground (in which there are buildings and 
structures separating the field device from the gateway 
device). Two different environments are chosen so as to find 
the attenuation and signal degradation in the two surface 
cases. 
These experiments were conducted at King Fahad 
University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) in an 
outdoor environment. Figure 3 shows the real test on rough 
ground. Topologies used for this experiment for the irregular 
and regular surfaces are shown in Figure 4 and  
Figure 5, respectively. A temperature sensor and two 
pressure sensors are used to sense the data and transfer it to 
the gateway device. TABLE III. shows the device type and 
tags used.  
 
Figure 4. ISA100 test for irregular surface. 
 
ISA100 takes into account the direct communication 
node and neighboring node for data transfer and in case if 
one node goes down it can automatically switch to another 
route based on the Packet Error Rate (PER) and RSSI. In the 
two topologies, we have seen that the sensor devices are 
connected to the gateway device directly or indirectly.  
There are two kinds of connections shown in the 
topologies. Solid lines are actual communication routing 
between the device and gateway. In Figure 4, the device TT-
856 was experiencing a higher PER while communicating to 
gateway device. Dotted lines are alternate routes, which are 
used in case of fault or errors. For each link, the RSSI and 
PER as a percentage are indicated.

As the direct link was noisy, so the data was transmitted 
by alternate route. A detailed statistics after collecting data 
from the two terrains is clearly shown in TABLE IV. . Here, 
we can see the low RSSI and high PER being highlighted.  
D. Discussion 
In the lab test, protocols stack that are available in the 
market are tested. Zigbee is the earliest with simple protocol 
set. HART and ISA100 are developed later with high data 
rate, efficiency and reliability. Zigbee application does not 
show the network related stats but depicts a clear picture of 
the parameters. HART on the other hand has support to the 
other networks and it can also show the clear picture of 
network elements in GUI. ISA100 significantly shows good 
results in different terrains. These lab tests help in 
understanding the difference in protocols and application 
level support provided by the vendors in industry. 
III. 
ISA100 SIMULATION 
Simulation has always been very popular among 
network-related research. Several simulators have been 
developed to implement and study algorithms for wireless 
networks. Some are general purpose while others are design 
for specific purpose and vary in features and the level of 
complexity. 
They 
support 
certain 
hardware 
and 
communication layers assumptions, and provide set of tools 
for 
deployment 
scenarios, 
modeling, 
analysis, 
and 
visualization. Classical simulation tools include NS-2/3, 
OPNET, OMNeT++, J-Sim, and TOSSIM [14][15][16].

After some research, we concluded that Python-based 
tools completely fulfill our requirements. We decided to use 
Pymote, which is a high level Python library specifically 
designed for wireless networks to perform event based 
simulation of distributed algorithms [17][18]. The user can 
implement their ideas in Python; which has become popular 
in academia and industry. The library is developed without 
much abstraction and therefore can be used or extended 
using Python's highly expressive native syntax. The library 
particularly focuses on fast and accurate implementation of 
ideas at algorithm level using formally defined distributed 
computing environment. 
A. The Simulation 
The base station is placed in middle of n randomly 
deployed EHWSN nodes over a 600 m by 600 m area. We 
consider registration and data packet sizes of 100 bytes 
while the acknowledgment packet size of 15 bytes. Some 
other parameters are shown in TABLE V. 5. 
A simple topology generated for simulation using the 
Pymote is shown in Figure 6. The center node (#1) acts as 
the base station for the other nodes (numbered 2 to 11). 
First, we evaluate the performance by changing the number 
of nodes (from 5 to 50). In this simulation, we kept the fixed 
data rate of one message every 5 seconds. Secondly, we vary 
the data rate from one message every 5 seconds to a 
message every second and keep the number of nodes fixed 
at 10.

of received packet and lost packets at the base station are 
also shown in the same figure. 
For the following simulation, the number of nodes are 
kept fixed at 10 and monitor the link quality index (LQI) 
and RSSI of received signal at the base station when nodes 
were sending data at variable rate. The SNR levels are 
shown in Figure 8. The simulation results are comparable 
with the experimental results in terms of PER and RSSI.

IV. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have studied and conducted the lab test 
of Zigbee, Wireless HART and ISA100. The results are 
compared and analyzed in order to evaluate the best protocol 
for IWSNs. ISA100 was also simulated using the Pymote 
framework Based on the studies it can be concluded that 
ISA100 is better than HART and far better than Zigbee 
protocol. ISA100 uses CSMA-CA with OQPSK, which 
make it efficient at its physical layer. For routing, IPV6 
helps ISA100 to coexist with any other legacy network. 
IPV6 also helps to carry traffic over a network without any 
routing gateway support. The Yokogawa field wireless kit 
offers a far better range that is greater than 800 meters, 
which is suitable for bigger industries and cuts the cost of 
additional gateway devices used to connect all the edges in a 
factory. The results of the simulation of ISA100 done on 
Pymote framework are comparable with the experimental 
results.
