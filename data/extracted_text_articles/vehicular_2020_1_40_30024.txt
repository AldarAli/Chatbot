Abstract—In this paper, we examine the intra-vehicle radio
propagation performance of narrowband signals at 2.4 GHz and
5.9 GHz. The measurements are taken from a vehicle testbed and
analyzed based on the path loss model that comprises the mean,
large-scale fading and small-scale fading loss components. We
show that multipath fading, especially the small-scale fading, has
the dominant impact on the loss performance, while the mean
loss varies relative to the free-space loss in this environment.
Different accumulated distribution functions are applied to assess
their suitability for characterizing the large-scale and small-scale
fading effects, and compared through the non-parametric tests.

I. INTRODUCTION
Wireless communications have been introduced to vehicles,
e.g.: Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are commonly used inside vehicles
for infotainment, and the Global Navigation Satellite System
(GNSS) is adopted for navigation. In addition, IEEE 802.11p
and LTE-V2X systems [1] have been deployed to enable com-
munication between vehicles (vehicle-to-vehicle or V2V) and
between vehicles and roadside units (vehicle-to-infrastructure
or V2I) for improving driving safety and data services to road
users.
Applying wireless communication technologies inside a
vehicle can improve its fuel and space efﬁciency through
reducing wire harness which leads to the weight reduction and
space saving for the vehicle. To achieve this end, the proper-
ties of intra-vehicle wireless channels need to be thoroughly
investigated in order to develop appropriate technologies and
protocols which can ensure the transmission performance
required.
The aim of this work is to gain a better understanding of
the characteristics of intra-vehicle channels for narrowband
wireless signals in term of their distance-dependent attenuation
factor and fading property at two different frequencies: 2.4
GHz and 5.9 GHz, which are chosen as they cover the 2.4
GHz unlicensed band and the 5.9 GHz dedicated short-range
communications (or IEEE802.11p) band.
In addition, the investigation of the loss performance of the
intra-vehicle channel is the focus of the empirical work we
carried out. This will demonstrate that the overall path loss
performance is contributed jointly by a mean loss component
which follows the log-distance loss model, and multipath
fading, namely large-scale and small-scale fading, related loss
components. We will also show the level of inﬂuence from
each of these components over the overall loss performance
at different frequencies.
We have chosen to study the narrowband performance as
it has been largely overlooked as compared to the published
work on the Ultra-Wideband (UWB) transmission [2]. It is
important to understand the narrowband behavior of the intra-
vehicle channel as the wireless systems used or recommended
for vehicles such as Bluetooth (no more than 2 MHz for each
channel), Zigbee (2 MHz for each channel) and Wi-Fi (20 or
22 MHz for each channel) are all in this range. Furthermore,
our results on the narrowband characteristics will provide a
better understanding of the ﬂat or deep fading behavior in the
intra-vehicle environment.
Although there have been some investigations on the prop-
agation characteristic of narrowband signals in intra-vehicle
wireless channels, most of them are more focused at the
general behavior of this type of channels, such as channel
coherent bandwidth, frequency diversity and power delay
proﬁle. Some exemplar investigates include the work carried
out by Cheng et al. which produces a simple analytical multi-
ray model with ﬁeld measurements [3], and the work by Liu et
al. which analyses the potential beneﬁt of frequency diversity
for intra-vehicle wireless applications [4].
In addition, a study by Moghimim et. al. [5] examines
channel coherence time and channel loss statistics at 915 MHz
and 2.4 GHz but without considering the distance related loss
performance. Kamoda et al. have presented both UWB and
narrowband channel models for the engine compartment only
which can be very different from the passenger compartment
in propagation characteristics as they commented [6].
Our work provides more insight into the causes of intra-
vehicle channel behavior by revealing the location/distance
based loss performance and the fading phenomenon in both
small scale and large-scale aspects and, at the same time,
showing how they collectively contribute to the loss perfor-
mance in such a complicated environment.
The structure of the paper is organized as follows. Section
II describes the testbed used for this research and related
settings based on which the measurements were collected. The
results, including path loss and channel fading characteristics,

II. TESTBED AND EXPERIMENT
A. Testbed Setup
The testbed was set up within the passenger and boot
compartments in a Land Rover Discovery vehicle and two
Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) B210 devices
from National Instruments were used as a transmitter and
a receiver in the tests. Each USRP was connected to an
omnidirectional antenna from Linx Technologies (2.4 GHz)
and Taoglas Limited (5.9 GHz), and also attached to a laptop
for signal generation and processing. The antennas were kept
vertically polarised throughout the tests carried out with the
transmitter and receiver aligned towards the back and front of
the vehicle, respectively.
The transmitter was conﬁgured to transmit a baseband signal
modulated by a carrier wave at the chosen frequency of 2.4
GHz or 5.9 GHz. The output power of the transmitter (USRP)
was calibrated in reference to the component datasheet of the
USRP and through a laboratory measurement with a Tektronix
spectrum analyzer. The output power is set to be -1 dBm at
2.4 GHz and -5 dBm at 5.9 GHz. The receiver was conﬁgured
to receive the complex signal waveforms for a length of 10
seconds, which resulted in a total of 100 million received
samples in the time domain for each testing location. The
measurements were collected through three runs for each test.
The related settings are summarized and speciﬁed in Table I.
B. Measurement Procedure and Scenario
A frequency spectrum scan was performed before taking
measurements to ensure the chosen channel to be free from
interference. The vehicle was in a stationary position with the
engine and electric power turned off during the tests. The area
around the vehicle was also kept out of any large objects and
human movement throughout the tests.
The transmitter was placed at a ﬁxed location on the dash-
board of the vehicle, while the location of the receiver (USRP)
was changeable depending on the requirement in different
tests. Two types of tests were conducted:
a) Test-1: Measuring the received signal power at 44 dif-
ferent locations across the passenger and boot compartments,
as shown in Fig. 1, at 2.4 GHz and 5.9 GHz.
Fig. 1. Locations of 44 measurement points in Test-1.
Fig. 2. Measurement grid of 12cm by 12cm (36 locations) for Test-2.
b) Test-2: Measuring the received signal power at 2.4
GHz in the boot compartment within a small 12cm x 12cm
grid (36 locations with a separation distance of 2 cm between
the marked locations), as shown in Fig. 2, for validating the
loss component due to small-scale fading.
For each of the measurements taken, all necessary infor-
mation such as the height and relative distance of the location
was recorded and used later to calculate the separation distance
between the transmitter and receiver antennas. The recorded
results in the form of complex numbers were processed in
MATLAB to extract the received power in dBm.
III. TEST RESULT AND ANALYSIS
A. Mean Path Loss
Path loss is frequently used to measure the propagation
loss of radio signal transmission between a transmitter and a
receiver. The intra-vehicle path loss behavior can be modelled
by combining the mean path loss Lm, the loss due to slow
or large-scale fading Xα, and loss due to fast or small-
scale fading βs. The combined path loss, denoted by Lp, is
expressed by (all in dB):
Lp = Lm + Xα + βs
(1)
The mean path loss is deﬁned by the generalized Friis equa-
tion also known as the log-distance path loss model, which
comprises two parts: 1) the loss at a reference distance, d0,
21

from the transmitter and 2) the loss logarithmically increasing
with distance, which is given by [7]:
Lm = Lref(d0) + 10nlog10( d
d0
)
(2)
where the terms Lref, n, d, d0 represents the path loss at
a reference distance, the path loss exponent, the distance
between the transmitter and receiver antennas, and the chosen
reference distance, respectively.
By using the measurements collected from the 44 locations
in Test-1, the mean path loss Lm can be estimated by using the
Least Square Linear Regression method [8]. Base on Eq.(2),
the mean loss value for each of the 44 locations (receivers),
Lm,i, is obtained by:
Lm,i = Lref,i + 10nixi for i = 1, 2, ...44.
(3)
where
xi = log10( di
d0
),
(4)
ni =
P44
i=1(xi − ¯x)(Li − ¯L)
P44
i=1(xi − ¯x)2
, and
(5)
Lref,i = ¯L − ni¯x (¯L =
P44
i=1 Li
44
).
(6)
where di, Li, represent the distance of ith location in meters
and the instance path loss of the ith location in dB, respec-
tively.
The path loss and estimated mean path loss which represent
the ﬁrst path loss component, Lm, are produced in Fig.3 for
2.4 GHz and Fig. 4 for 5.9 GHz. The reference distance is
set to be d0 = 1 meter. The extracted parameters for both 2.4
GHz and 5.9 GHz are shared and shown in Table II together
with the loss at the reference distance, Lref.
For comparison purposes, the results of the Friis model or
the free-space loss model (Lf and n = 2) are also produced
in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, according to:
Lf = 20log10( d
d0
) + 20log10(f) + 20log10
4π
c

(7)
where f and c represent signal frequency and the speed of
light, respectively. These results show that the mean path loss
of the intra-vehicle narrowband transmission exhibits varied
relationships with the free-space loss. At 2.4 GHz the mean
loss is lower than the free-space loss by 2-4 dB over the 3
meters range in the vehicle, as shown in Fig. 3. However,
when the frequency is increased to 5.9 GHz, the mean loss
has a signiﬁcantly larger increase than that of the free-space
loss over the majority of the test range, as shown in 4. It is also
observed that the special path loss performance inside vehicles,
in terms of the scale of variation, is mainly contributed by the
multipath fading effect which will be examined in detail in
the following subsections.

B. Large-scale fading
The large-scale fading also known as shadowing represents
the local average slow fading characteristic of the received
signal. It is deﬁned in this analysis as the local-mean received
signal power within a window of 50 cm which is equivalent
to 4λ at 2.4 GHz and 10λ at 5.9 GHz, where λ denotes the
wavelength. This window size is chosen base on the consider-
ation that it should cover a enough number of measurements
from neighboring locations in the test. But at the same time it
should not be too wide as this will compromise the location
differentiation factor, i.e. no obvious variation in loss can be
identiﬁed between neighboring local mean values. The loss
component due to large-scale fading is extrapolated using the
Moving Mean method, with the metric given by [9]:
Lγ = 1
k
k
X
i=1
Li
(8)
where Lγ represents the local mean, k is the window size
deﬁned by the number of samples within the window, and
Li is the path loss of the ith sample. The large-scale fading
results are shown in Fig. 3 for 2.4 GHz and Fig. 4 for 5.9
GHz, by the dashed lines.
In wireless communications, large-scale fading is normally
described as a log-normal distributed random variable. But
it has been argued that this is not always the case as other
distribution functions have demonstrated a better ﬁt in some
scenarios. Therefore, we evaluated this performance using
the Cumulative Density Function (CDF) of the Relative Loss
Variation (RLV) against the mean path loss, and through the
comparisons between different distribution functions such as

To show the Goodness of Fit (GoT) of those distribution
functions to our measurements, we applied three different
test metrics: Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS), Chi-Square (Chi)
and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), with results
tabulated in Table III. The KS results suggest the log-
normal distribution being the highest match percentage with
big margins from the others. However, the Chi and MLE
results show no dominance of the log-normal distribution and,
in particular, the Chi results have demonstrate that Rician,
Nakagami and Weibull are all better ﬁtted than log-normal at
2.4 GHz. The parameters that represents the large-scale fading
Xa as log-normal (normal id dB) for both frequencies are
shared in Table IV.

C. Small-scale fading
Small-scale fading is deﬁned as the variation of the received
signal power over a short time period or a short distance less
than a few wavelengths. The magnitude of this variation can
be as high as 40 dB [10]. In our work, the intra-vehicle small-
scale fading proﬁle was investigated using two methods based
on the measurements taken from a spatially tightened grid, as
described below.
a) Spatial distribution of path loss due to small-scale
fading: The received signal power was measured and later
converted into the path loss for 36 locations as shown in Fig.
2. The distribution of the path loss for those location is shown
by Fig. 7 in a three-dimensional view. The result shows a
signiﬁcant loss variation when the receiver is moved by just
2 cm. This behavior is due to the multipath characteristics
of the channel and in particular due to the narrowband of
signals transmitted. In addition, the largest variation in path
loss measure at 55 dB, which is 15 dB above the mean loss
of this grid, is observed.
b) CDF for small-scale fading effect: The small-scale
fading component was extracted from the measured path loss
from Test-1 as shown in Fig. 1, by deducting the large-scale
fading component from the actual loss measurement which
represents the relative loss variation (RLV) for small-scale
fading. The small-scale fading effect was then demonstrated
using the CDF of RLV in comparison with the same group of

popular distribution functions, as shown in Fig. 8 for 2.4 GHz
and Fig. 9 for 5.9 GHz.
By comparing the CDFs in Figs. 5 and 6 with those in
Figs. 8 and 9, clearly small-scale fading lays a considerably
dominant role over large-scale fading in contributing to the
overall path loss in the intra-vehicle environment. The RLV
caused by small-scale fading is signiﬁcantly higher than that
of large-scale fading and can reach as high as 18 dB.
To check the GoT among those distributions to the measured
results, KS, Chi and MSE metrics were also used with the
comparison results shown in Table VI. As indicated by KS
and MLE results, the log-normal distribution is statistically
a better ﬁt than other types of distributions. Some statistical
parameters for describing small-scale fading βs as a log-
normal distribution (normal in dB) for both frequencies are
given in Table V.
The small-scale fading distributions for both frequencies
appear to be similar to each other. This feature has been con-
ﬁrmed by using the two-sample KS test which demonstrates a

close correlation between the small-scale fading components

words, the path loss variation caused by small-scale fading
is not signiﬁcantly affected by the carrier frequency in this
environment.
IV. CONCLUSION
The paper has presented the propagation characteristic of
narrowband signals at 2.4 GHz and 5.9 GHz in the intra-
vehicle wireless channels. Various channel parameters have
been extracted from the received signal power measurements
such as the distance-related attenuation loss or the mean
loss, large-scale fading and small-scale fading statistics, which
jointly contribute to the overall path loss. In addition, we
have demonstrated that the small-scale fading effect is not
statistically dependent on carrier frequency.
We have found that multipath fading has a signiﬁcant impact
on the path loss performance of narrowband signals compared
to the attenuation-related loss which has a varied relationship
with the free-space loss depending on the operating frequency
chosen. We have also showed that small-scale fading is much
more inﬂuential than large-scale fading on path loss in this
environment. These ﬁndings will help to identify suitable
technologies to mitigate the small-scale fading effect on data
transmission in intra-vehicle wireless channels.
