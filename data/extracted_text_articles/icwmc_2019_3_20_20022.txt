I. INTRODUCTION
It is a well-known fact that the 5G mobile networks are of
great importance, since they have been discussed extensively.
These networks will play an important role both for the
scientiﬁc community and the everyday life in the next decade
(2020-2030) at an international level. There is a worldwide
race for 5G, which is currently won by China, that is prepared
for the advent of the new technology.
5G mobile networks will be able to offer a wide range of
technologies and services at unbelievably high speeds with
lower latency. These technologies and services will support
existing devices, such as smartphones, computers, tablets,
new ”smart” devices and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) com-
munications and the Internet of Things (IoT). Substantial
technologies are going to star in the future networks, such
as Software Deﬁned Networking (SDN), Network Function
Virtualization (NFV), Cloud Computing, Massive Multiple
Input Multiple Output (Massive MIMO), Cognitive Radio
(CR), Ultra-dense deployments.
The main challenges concern higher data rates, ultra-
low latency, high reliability, security and higher capacity
than the current 4G ones. 5G will reach 1000 times the
systems’ capacity, 10 times the spectral efﬁciency, the energy
efﬁciency and data rates and 25 times the average cell rate
compared to what today’s network provide.
In this paper, the main technologies that are going to
star into the next generation of mobile networks authors are
reviewed. The most vital parts and the most discouraging
drawbacks are considered, the issues that need to be solved
and the needs of the 5G networks are pinpointed. The current
state of each key enabler is presented and several ideas for
future investigation are listed.
The remaining part of this paper is structured as follows:
In Section II, the most important points of 5G, namely the
requirements, needs, advantages, disadvantages and current
state and projects are analyzed. In Section III, the key 5G
enablers that are the technologies that will meet the 5G
goals. In Section IV, the main technologies are contrasted. In
Section V, the main conclusions are summarized and future
research activity in the ﬁeld is proposed.
II. 5G
In this section, the most important issues, concerning 5G
milestones, requirements, needs, advantages and challenges
are presented.
A. Requirements
Requirements concerning the 5G mobile communication
networks are:
• High data rates: 5G networks should support data rates
around 10 Gbps.
• Low latency: The latency should be around 1 millisec-
ond.
• More intense security: Connected devices lead to
hazards for the network.
• Low energy consumption: of both network and de-
vices.
• Augmented scalability
• High reliability: is critical in many 5G applications and
services.
B. Needs
In contrast to previous generations of cellular networks, it
is expected that the ﬁfth generation will signiﬁcantly improve
the performance, allowing businesses to exploit a wide range
of applications, services and possibilities, such as smart-
watches, wearables, autonomous vehicles and Internet of
Things (IoT).
• Entertainment (e.g., multiplayer gaming, real-time
streaming, mobile social media, cloud gaming, in-car
entertainment, etc.)
• Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR):
a person interacts with the environment in real-time, by
using wearables.

ICWMC 2019 : The Fifteenth International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications

• Self-driving cars: The 5G brings services and opportu-
nities.
• Smart cities: The creation of a new digital ecosystem
will beneﬁt the citizens, as cities will function efﬁciently
and sustainably.
C. Advantages & Disadvantages
It is widely known that people use the mobile networks on
a daily basis, since the amount of the devices that use them
are augmented. Some of the major beneﬁts are:
• effectiveness and efﬁciency,
• more bandwidth,
• data rates of 10 Gbps or higher can be achieved, which
will support more than 60,000 connections,
• the improved 5G network architecture leads to smoother
handoffs.
There are some drawbacks concerning the usage of the 5th
generation of mobile technology:
• security and privacy issues yet to be solved,
• less coverage distance,
• worries about possible health and safety problems.
D. Current state
There is no doubt that the 5G mobile communication
technology will open a new dimension to our lives and will
signiﬁcantly alter our life-style. This is why many companies
have started many tests of the ﬁfth generation wireless
technology. Funding will allow the country to become a
major player in the development of 5G technology, as India
aims to be the leader in 5G technology in Asia.
Vodafone performed the ﬁrst UK trials in April 2018 using
mid-band spectrum and China Telecom’s initial 5G build-out
in 2018 will use mid-band spectrum as well. Last but not
least, the world ﬁrst service of 5G was in South Korea, as
the South Korean telecoms deployed it all at once on the ﬁrst
day of December in 2018.
Worldwide 5G commercial launch is expected in 2020, as
much work remains in upgrading the current mobile infras-
tructure, in order to be able to accommodate 5G technologies,
whereas many companies are pushing for launching 5G by
2019.
In 2019 and 2020 it is expected that several Spectrum
and Band Arrangements will happen. The Radio Framework
and the IMT-2020 Radio Speciﬁcations will be presented.
And ﬁnally, an updated plan will be set for future network
enhancement.
III. TECHNOLOGIES
In this section, the technologies that will contribute to the
development of 5G are summarized. In Figure 1, the basic
5G key enablers are presented.
Fig. 1. The most substantial 5G key enabling technologies.
Fig. 2. An Ultra-Dense deployment architectural scheme.
A. Ultra-density
The Ultra-dense structure in the Figure 2 consists of differ-
ent small cells (picocells, femtocells) that re-use bandwidth.
Ultra-dense deployments offer the following beneﬁts to end-
users:
• Higher throughput as well as lower round-trip time.
• Improved indoor coverage.
• Closed user group access.
5G has substantial requirements, such as: 50 times more
capacity, peak data rates exceeding 10Gbit/s and ultra-low
latency below 1msec.
B. Software Deﬁned Networking (SDN)
SDN splits the control and the data plane. There is the
application plane, upon which a large amount of applications
run. These planes are interconnected and interact with one
another. The control plane is the smart part of the network
and performs all the orchestration. A basic SDN architecture
is presented in Figure 3. The open issues of SDN are [1]:
• Controlling:
– Standardization of the control interfaces
– Measures to avoid performance degradation
• Reliability:
– Seamless connectivity/connection recovery
– Security requirements in EPC and RAN

– Equilibrium among performance, security and ﬂex-
ibility.
C. Network Function Virtualization (NFV)
NFV enables substituting hardware with software. Soft-
ware or network functions are introduced into the network
by using NFVs. These open issues are [1]:
• Controlling:
– Seamless control and provisioning
– Creation of network granularity policies
• Reliability:
– Seamless and high quality connectivity
– Virtualization of terminal points
• Scalability:

D. Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO)
One of the key 5G technologies is MIMO. This wireless
technology includes a number of transceivers and receivers
of the signal. Depending on the number of existing antennas,
this technology is called MIMO or Massive MIMO. Figure 4
indicates how MIMO technology functions. This technology
includes many advantages:
• Augmented data rates & spectrum efﬁciency
• Quality of Service (QoS)
• Greener technology: Lower energy consumption to the
sender’s side.
But its most substantial drawbacks are: More Hardware &
Complex software
E. Cognitive Radio (CR)
On these networks, there are users, who have priority and
access the licensed spectrum. There are also other users that
perform real-time network status checks whether the licensed
spectrum is being used or not. They use the unauthorized
spectrum or the licensed spectrum if it is free. Figure 5
depicts the interaction with the network. The CR technology
includes several fundamental beneﬁts:
• Re-usage of available resources
Fig. 5. A CR deployment architectural scheme.
Fig. 6. A D2D architectural scheme.
• Combination Technology
• Tax-free usage of spectrum zones [2]
• High-efﬁcient networks [3]
• The sub-usage of the frequency zones
The most important problems are listed below:
• Need for multi-spectrum antennas
• Bigger safety gaps
F. Device-to-Device (D2D)
Device-to-Device (D2D) is the communication between
two mobile users without the Base Stations (BS) or the core
network. Figure 6 presents the D2D architectural concept.
• Basic Characteristics:
– Trusted devices: D2D allocate closed access to
trusted devices in accordance to a list. [4]
– Modes: There are a lot of different modes: Silent,
Non-orthogonal Sharing, Orthogonal Sharing, Cel-
lular. [5]
• Advantages:
– Gains: D2D offer proximity, reuse, hop and paring
gain. [5]
– Enables spectral reuse [5] [6]
– Lower interference
– Improvement of the energy consumption and
throughput [6]
– Combination with Wi-Fi direct: Reduces power
and delays.
– Short distance communication: allow high spatial
reuse.
• Disadvantages:
– User activity: Is difﬁcult or even impossible to be
controlled.

is widely used in Cloud [9]. Figure 8 depicts the basic mobile
cloud architecture.
• Characteristics: Fairness, pricing approach and utiliza-
tion period.
• Types of Cloud: Remote, Local or Hybrid [10].

their clientele.
– Data security: is debated and required by users.
– Cloud RAN problems: Limited capacity, Insufﬁ-
cient and low utilization. [10]
– Base Band Unit (BBU) problems: The BBU is
low- compatible, inefﬁcient and inelastic. [10]
I. Milimeter Wave (MMWave)
MMWave (30-300GHz) rends the under-utilized and un-
used bands of spectrum usable and connects more users.
• Basic Characteristics:
– mmWave channel and beamforming technologies,
– The 28 and 38 GHz will be the used bands,
– 40 GHz is going to be the most possible one
– The effective cell radius is 220m. [11]

moved from the spectrum when it’s licensed.
– Difﬁculty in the estimation accuracy [12]
– E-band challenges: Increased phase noise, limited
ampliﬁer gain, need for transmission line modeling
of circuit components etc. [13]
IV. COMPARE & CONTRAST
In this section, the main technologies should be compared.
A Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT)
analysis is a technique that helps indicating how several facts
deriving from external or internal factors could be either
helpful or harmful to achieve a goal or promote a prod-
uct. Strengths and Opportunities are both helpful deriving
from internal and external factors respectively. Weaknesses
and Threats are both harmful and derive from internal and
external factors respectively.
In the following section, a SWOT analysis Table I lists
the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats that are
pinpointed concerning the 5th generation of mobile networks
and its adoption.
Table II includes the evaluation of the 5G key enablers. The
technologies are compared in terms of the following features:
• Cost: Although, most technologies reduce the costs,
several of them include augmented Operational Expen-
ditures (OPEX) costs. MIMO induce larger OPEX since

an augmented number of antennas is needed, while in
MMWave the BW used is more expensive.
• Scalable: Most technologies induce expendable char-
acteristics, since it’s very easy to add more network
components or expand the network in a very easy
way using less conﬁguration. D2D and MIMO are not
scalable since it’s not easy to add more components

there are several open issues that need to be addressed. The
MMWave and MIMO technologies appear to have augmented
OPEX. The MIMO and D2D technologies need more BW to
be reallocated. The power consumption of the IoT, D2D and
MIMO should be reduced.
Therefore, several solutions and algorithms of the new
technologies need to be introduced. What is more, the
CAPEX of all the technologies should be limited so that
providers adopt these technologies.
