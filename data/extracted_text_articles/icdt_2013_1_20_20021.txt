Abstract—In this paper, we provide an analysis of perfor-
mance of the scalable extension of the H.264/AVC video codec.
We assume a ﬁxed display scenario at full HD resolution with
a constant frame rate. The encoded bit stream consists of one
Coarse Grain Scalability (CGS) and one Medium Grain Scal-
ability (MGS) layer with three sublayers, allowing for creating
four quality layers from the complete bit stream. Hierarchical
coding is employed, which results in dyadic decomposition of
temporal layers. In order to increase the granularity of quality
layers, the packets are selectively dropped from appropriate
quality and temporal layers. We provide a performance analy-
sis of such approach, compare the rate distortion performance
to a mainstream H.264 encoder and analyze the composition of
the bit stream at the considered operation points. Our ﬁndings
show that quality enhancement of temporal layers has different
effect on the overall performance depending on which temporal
layer is enhanced.
Keywords-High deﬁnition video; quality of service; scalability;
video coding.
I. INTRODUCTION
It has been pronounced in the recent years that the video
trafﬁc forms a signiﬁcant share in the data carried over
the Internet. In 2011, the share of Internet video was 51 %
of all consumer Internet trafﬁc and is expected to raise to
55 % in 2016 [1]. These high numbers do not include video
exchanged through peer to peer sharing. Counting them in,
the share of video on the overall Internet trafﬁc is expected
to reach 86 % in 2016.
There is a rapid increase in the number of broadband
connections to the Internet. Quite naturally, as the throughput
increases, the quality demands of the users increase as
well. Advanced Internet video (stereoscopic 3D and high
deﬁnition) is getting an important share on the overall
Internet video trafﬁc and is expected to reach 46 % of the
consumer Internet video trafﬁc in 2014 [2]. These numbers
clearly show the importance of efﬁcient online delivery of
high quality video.
The bit rate of the video carried over the data network is
one of the most important aspects related to quality. When
the bit rate is too low, the visual quality of the decoded
video images may be degraded. On the other hand, when
the bit rate is too high, the risk of network having issues
delivering the high amount of data increases, which may lead
to video freezes or longer waiting times (usually with TCP-
based connections) or loss of data and visual impairments
(for UDP-based connections). The optimum bit rate is thus
limited from both ends and depends, to a large extent, on
the individual parameters of the user’s connection.
In order to cope with the different bit rate requirements
of the delivered video, the most common approach is to
offer several copies of the same content, encoded at different
bit rates, and let the user or the video player select one
of the bit rates according to the available throughput. Such
ﬁxed bit rate approach is, however, inefﬁcient in case the
available network throughput is changing over the playback.
One possible solution is to allow for switching among the
different bit rates offered by the provider, implemented
in e.g. HTTP Live Streaming technique [3] or DASH -
Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP [4]. A common
feature of the mentioned adaptive streaming techniques is
that it is the client who decides on the bit rate to receive. For
such decision, the client needs to be informed on the actual
available bit rate and take fast action when the available bit
rate decreases. The advantage of the Scalable Video Coding
(SVC) [5] extension of the H.264/AVC standard is that parts
of the transmitted data stream have different importance.
Through dropping certain packets in case of insufﬁcient
transmission capacity, SVC offers graceful degradation by
decreasing the quality of the decoded received stream. A nice
description of the concepts used in SVC can be found in [5].
The aim of this paper is to present a scheme for dropping
SVC packets with high bit rate/quality granularity and to
compare its performance to the non-scalable H.264/AVC
encoder using multiple streams. We focus on the full HD
resolution and full frame rate of 25 frames per seconds, as
such format is very promising for the current and future
video delivery.
Throughout this paper, the rate distortion performance
will be measured using the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio
(PSNR). Even though PSNR is not a good quality metric
in most cases as the correlation of its outputs with results of
subjective experiments is poor, it is suitable in this setup as
a performance indicator: as it has traditionally been used for
quantifying the performance of coding tools and algorithms,
it is extremely wide spread and well understood in the video

This paper is organized as follows: First, the related
work is mentioned in Section II. The used packet dropping
scheme and the resulting SVC performance are described in
Section III. Finally, the paper concludes in Section IV.
II. RELATED WORK
The performance of the SVC encoding algorithm has been
studied even before the standard was released in 2007. In [6],
the authors ﬁnd that the overall rate-distortion performance
of the SVC is approximately 10 % worse compared to
AVC with identical settings. In other words, SVC needs
approximately 10 % more bit rate to achieve the same
quality in terms of PSNR. In [6], one base layer and one
enhancement layer in spatial or quality domain is used. SVC
performance analysis based on subjective tests has been done
in [7], conﬁrming the previous results. In [6] and [7], one
base layer and one enhancement layer are used in terms of
quality and spatial scalability.
A common approach to selecting the layers in the scalable
bit stream is selecting a certain combination of D (depen-
dency), T (temporal) and Q (quality) parameters. Then, all
the inferior layers are included in all three domains. For ﬁxed
display conditions, i.e. ﬁxed frame rate and ﬁxed spatial
resolutions, one only gets as many bit rate/quality levels as
there are Q levels in the original stream. We utilize dropping
in different T layers in order to increase the bit rate/quality
granularity.
The authors of [10] provide an analysis of different
approaches to dropping layers in the SVC bit stream in the
mobile environment. Through a subjective study, different
impact on Quality of Experience is introduced by different
scaling approaches and for different contents. Generally,
spatial scaling is regarded worse compared to temporal and
quality scaling, which leads to a recommendation that the
quality layers and some temporal layers should be dropped
ﬁrst. This is in complete agreement with our approach,
where no spatial scalability is included.
In [11] and [12], the authors analyze the impact of unsta-
ble transmissions on the perceived quality when a scalable
video bit stream is transmitted. In this context, the unstable
transmission leads to varying number of layers received in
the sequence duration. It has been shown that quality of
unstable videos is subjectively perceived close to the quality
of stable videos. Furthermore, it was found that temporal
scalability introduces severe degradation of perceived quality
while quality scalability leads to best results. These results
are the motivation to keep the video frame rate constant
through all operation points in our experiment.

describe the structure of the full quality bit stream as shown
in Fig. 1. Using the hierarchical B frames, the full frame rate
of 25 fps can be decomposed in a dyadic structure down to
3.125 fps in case four temporal layers are used. In the lowest
frame rate (T = 0), only the 1st and 9th frame are encoded.
For each of them, several quality layers can be deﬁned (Q = 1
to Q = 3). The frames at the lowest frame rate serve as the
basis for prediction of frames in the higher frame rate, i.e.
T = 1. At T = 1, the 1st, 5th and 9th frame are available.
Continuing such prediction leads to doubling the frame rate
at each step, resulting in 25 fps at T = 3.
The common approach to dropping SVC data is illustrated
in Fig. 2. In order to keep the highest frame rate (T = 3),
all the inferior frame rates are kept in full quality (Q = 3).
Obviously, this technique can reach only 4 operation points
at the full temporal resolution.
In contrast, the approach that we use throughout this paper
allows dropping quality layers even from lower temporal
resolutions. As long as the base quality layer is kept in
each temporal layer, the full frame rate can easily be
reconstructed. Such approach is shown in Fig. 3. Note the
obvious inconsistency in layer T = 1: Although in the inferior
layer (T = 0) no quality enhancement data was kept, higher
quality layers are present at T = 1. As there are no references
used to the speciﬁc Q at the lower layer, prediction can still
be done and enhanced at the current layer. Moreover, we
will show that in some cases this scenario can lead to higher

quality at a given bit rate. All the operation points considered
in this experiment are described by TABLE I. An operation
point (OP) is deﬁned by the subset of layers, employed in the
respective sub-stream. Please note that OP25 and OP30 are
made up from an identical set of sub-layers, which means
one of them could be removed as redundant. However, we
keep both of these operation points as they represent the
lowest quality reached through different packet dropping
strategies, which is useful in further descriptions and plots.
In order to drop packets from an SVC bit stream, trace ﬁles
were prepared and used with the bit stream extractor tool
available with JSVM. The resulting streams were decoded
with JSVM and compared to uncompressed originals in
terms of mean PSNR of the luma component.
B. Test Setup
Two sequences were used in our experiment: The ”blue
sky” sequence, which has midrange spatial and low temporal
activity (a view of a sky through treetops with slow camera
rotation) and the ”tractor” sequence, which has high spatial
and temporal activity (a tractor working on the ﬁeld with
complex background and high motion). The sequences have
been downloaded from [13].
The sequences were encoded with the JSVM encoder
(Joint Scalable Video Model) version 9.19.13 [8]. As this
version has no rate control mechanism implemented, we
decided for a Quantization Parameter (QP)-based conﬁgu-
ration and all the sequences were encoded with the same
initial QPs. According to the complexity of each scene, the
resulting bit rates and qualities differ.
The bit stream was formed by the component layers:
1) The base layer, identiﬁed by Q = 0. This layer was
coded with the GOP size of 16 to allow efﬁcient
decomposition of frame rate. The IDR period was 32.
The layer was coded using High proﬁle, initial QP set
to 48.
2) CGS enhancement layer, identiﬁed by Q = 1. The
Coarse Grain Scalability (CGS) allows for enhancing
the quality of a decoded picture by employing inter-
layer prediction mechanisms, such as prediction of
macroblock modes, motion parameters and residual
prediction. [9]. The layer was encoded with initial QP
set to 42.
3) MGS enhancement layer, identiﬁed by Q = 2 to 4.
The Medium Grain Scalability (MGS) provides a ﬁner
granularity compared to CGS by splitting a given
quality enhancement layer into several MGS layers.
Basically, MGS divides the transform coefﬁcients of
each macroblock into multiple groups. In our conﬁgu-
ration, we used 4 (most signiﬁcant) coefﬁcients for the
lowest quality layer, 4 coefﬁcients for the medium and
8 (least signiﬁcant) coefﬁcients for the highest quality
MGS layer. The initial QP of the MGS enhancement
layer was set to 30.

Furthermore, the sequences were encoded using the refer-
ence implementation of the H.264/AVC encoder [14] version
JM 18.2. The motivation for using another encoder is to keep
track of the overall performance of the scalable coding and
the usability of the created bit streams. The AVC encoder
was set to High proﬁle, level 4.0, with hierarchical B-frames
having the same structure as the B-frames in SVC.
C. Results
Figures 4 and 5 illustrate the average PSNR for 200
frames of each sequence along all the SVC operation points
deﬁned in TABLE I. Furthermore, a curve illustrating the
AVC performance is shown. It can be observed that the
coding performance of AVC is several dB better compared
to SVC. On the other hand, the SVC offers ﬂexibility
in modifying a readily encoded bit stream such that the
required bit rate can be easily altered with no need of
transcoding.
An interesting phenomenon can be observed in the area
of lower SVC bit rates for the ”tractor” sequence. Here,
different qualities are achieved for the curve representing
operation points 14-24, where the quality layers are dropped
regularly from higher to lower temporal layers, and the curve
representing operation points 26-29, where only the quality

enhancement data of the highest temporal layer are kept.
In OPs 26-29, the frames from the highest temporal layer
are enhanced, which means quality enhancement informa-
tion is present in every second frame of the sequence (see
T = 3 in Fig. 1) - the number of frames in this temporal layer
is higher than the number of frames in the inferior temporal
layers. One would expect that high bit rate is required to
present the frames of highest temporal layer at a higher
quality (more quality layers). This might not be true in
all cases since the frames at the highest temporal layers
quite often do need lower bit rate than the frames at lower
temporal layers (due to temporal prediction).
In order to understand the composition of the packets in
the bit stream, we have plotted the cumulative distribution
function of the packet sizes for both sequences in Fig. 6
and Fig. 7. In these CDFs, the operation point OP1 (full
bit stream) is displayed using a black line, OP30 (lowest bit
rate stream) is displayed with a red line, OP21 is drawn with
a blue line and, ﬁnally, OP26 is drawn with a green line.
The reason for selecting OP21 and 26 is that they follow
different trends in Fig. 5 and use different parts of data
for quality enhancement: While OP21 drops quality layers
monotonously from highest to lowest temporal layers, OP26
uses quality enhancement in the highest temporal layer only.
The cumulative distribution function plots show that the
curve for OP 21 is generally below the other curves, which
means that there is a low percentage of smaller packets in the
bit stream. On the other hand, the curve for OP26 is clearly
above all other curves, which means that the percentage of
small packets in the bit stream is higher. An explanation for
this is that in OP26, the quality enhancement information
is present for a larger number of frames (higher temporal
layer) using a lower amount of data in small packets.
Still, the explanation for the increased PSNR in higher
operation points in Fig. 5 is missing. For a better understand-
ing, we have plotted the PSNR values in time for two GOPs
in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. In all plots, OP1 is drawn with black
line, OP30 (equal to OP25) is drawn with red line. First, let
us focus on Fig. 8 showing the ”blue sky” sequence: Fig. 8a
shows the behaviour for OPs 14-25. With the increasing
operation point index, there is a monotonous decrease of
quality for all frames. Sharp PSNR peaks can be observed
at frames number 1 and 17, which are in fact the boundaries
of a GOP (I frames). These peaks mean that the the PSNR
of the frames in the lowest temporal layer is high in case
all the quality enhancement information is available. When
the enhancement information is discarded from the lowest
temporal layer, the PSNR of I frames drops drastically. As
a result, what we can observe for both extreme cases, being
the highest and the lowest overall mean PSNR for OP1 and
OP25, is that there is a signiﬁcant quality ﬂuctuation present
within a group of pictures. This unwanted effect should be
eliminated by the rate control mechanism of the encoder.
Unfortunately, no rate control has been implemented in the
JSVM reference encoder for scalable video coding so far.
Fig. 8b shows the PSNR of frames within two GOPs of OPs
26-30. In this case, enhancing the higher temporal layers
only brings no improvement over OP30.
An interesting thing can be observed in the plots for
the ”tractor” sequence in Fig. 9. In contrast to high PSNR
ﬂuctuations appearing for OPs 14-25 (Fig. 9a), the enhance-
ment of higher temporal layers only results in a smoother
PSNR curve as shown in (Fig. 9b) It can be expected
that the PSNR ﬂuctuations are annoying for the user and
their elimination is desirable. When properly conﬁguring the
encoder, enhancement of the higher temporal layers only
should lead to a more equal improvement of the quality of
all frames throughout the sequence.
IV. CONCLUSION
The usability of H.264/SVC for efﬁcient adaptive video
transmission depends, to a larger extent, on the desired usage
scenario. In our experiment, the usage scenario was high
deﬁnition video, whose application is very likely to be found
in IP-based television or wireless multimedia services. An
approach for increasing the quality granularity of a scalable
bit stream was presented, dropping the quality enhancement
packets from different temporal layers according to a deﬁned
scheme.

It has been shown that the overall performance of
H.264/SVC in this scenario is considerably worse compared
to the very well performing implementation of H.264/AVC.
However, one has to keep in mind that the SVC reference
encoder lacks efﬁcient rate control, which degrades its
coding efﬁciency. It can be expected that with other encoder
implementations, the rate-distortion performance of the SVC
encoder approaches AVC more closely.
Analyzing the cumulative distribution function of the
packet sizes for the considered operation points has revealed
the fact that quality enhancement data for higher temporal
layers are carried in a higher number of smaller packets,
which can be a useful information from the network point
of view. It is also in a perfect agreement with the fact that
with high temporal layer enhancement, a higher number of
frames is enhanced by a smaller PSNR difference.
Finally, it has been shown that when the enhancement
of the lower temporal layers only is kept, the quality of
video frames in time tends to exhibit ﬂuctuations in terms
of PSNR. This effect does not appear when the enhancement
of higher temporal layers only is employed. In order to
exploit the impact of the quality ﬂuctuations on the quality
perceived by the consumer, the authors plan to conduct a
subjective testing session. In case it is proved that removing
these ﬂuctuations would bring an overall improvement of
the video quality, an optimization of the packet dropping
strategy based on high temporal layer enhancement will be
considered.
