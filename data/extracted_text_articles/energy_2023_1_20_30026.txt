Abstract—Flow visualization including image processing and 
Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements is used to 
evaluate the flow velocity field of the acrylic solar sphere filled 
with oil. This generated convection flow is affected by the 
thickness of the sphere, the sphere size as well as the 
temperature. The function of the acrylic sphere which is a 
modern technology of concentrated photovoltaic is to gather 
the energy from the sun and then concentrate it in a compact 
area like a focal spot. This focal spot is placed and put directly 
above a multi-junction device that acts as a concentrator cell 
appliance. This appliance directly can generate an enormous 
rate of power that is utilized to generate more electricity 
rather than the power that normal photovoltaic panels (PV) 
can produce. The acrylic sphere is used also for a lot of 
industrial applications. This research paper aims to 
investigate the characteristics of the flow inside the sphere 
and explore the sphere thickness, the sphere size, and the 
sphere temperature effect on the flow velocity of the fluid 
motion. Moreover, the purpose of this study is to clarify the 
relationship between these parameters in order to achieve 
greater efficiency for power generation, therefore, improve its 
performance. The results showed that the sphere thickness, 
the sphere temperature, and the sphere size significantly 
change the flow structure value. It is found that the velocity 
increase as the sphere thickness decreases. Hence, the 
efficiency of the sphere increases when using lower acrylic 
sphere thickness, higher size, and lower liquid temperature. 
The output power and efficiency of the solar sphere increase 
with lower sphere thickness. The thinner the thickness of the 
acrylic layer, the higher the sunlight absorbed by the acrylic 
photons. Subsequently, the higher the output power, which 
results to get higher the efficiency.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Several threats to food security, water resources, and 
the environment have appeared and expanded, resulting in 
a strong demand for technological advancements in the 
energy sector. This is also reinforced by data demonstrating 
the exponential rise in power and energy research over the 
previous 
few 
decades. 
Parallel 
to 
this,  
energy demand is expected to rise to a high between 2016 
and 2040 [1]-[3]. 
Despite the global expansion of trends favoring energy 
conservation, green energy supply, and low environmental 
effect, producing enough energy to meet global demand 
remains a tough task. The most difficult task remains to 
deliver power from clean sources, such as renewable  
 
 
energy, which can lead to a reduction in the use of fossil 
fuels [4]-[6]. 
Renewable energy's capacity to meet the world's energy 
needs is promising, and it has the potential to reduce 
reliance on traditional energy sources, such as oil and 
uranium. Because traditional energy sources are both 
expensive and harmful to the environment, renewable 
energy sources provide a competitive option for power 
generation. Among the different renewable energy sources, 
solar energy is the most abundant and easily available to 
cover human electrical usage. As a result, numerous 
researchers have been looking for novel ways to gather 
solar energy and use it as a renewable energy source [7]-
[9].  
The efficiency of the solar sphere which is a new 
technology is significantly higher than normal solar panel 
collector components. Following the introduction of solar 
panels, many sun lights concentrated systems have arisen. 
One of these is the solar sphere collector, which is more 
efficient than traditional solar panels. Other benefits of the 
solar sphere include a) the ability to convert solar energy 
directly into electrical energy, b) solar radiations can be 
collected at any angle, unlike conventional solar panels, 
which must be integrated with a tracking system in order to 
capture the maximum amount of solar radiations, and c) 
their size is smaller compared to conventional solar panels, 
which occupy larger areas for relatively the same amount 
of solar radiations [10][11].  
The concentrated solar sphere system consists of an 
acrylic sphere filled with a fluid that absorbs sunlight and 
transforms it directly into electrical energy. This is 
accomplished by concentrating solar energy from all across 
the sphere and focusing it in a small focused area on a high-
efficiency solar cell. A pyranometer is used to measure sun 
irradiance, while a multimeter is used to measure the 
electrical power generated by the solar cell. 
The solar sphere collector technology was already 
investigated and tested in our past study. The trials included 
different spherical materials, sphere shapes, and sphere 
sizes, as well as different fluids. Numerous tests were 
conducted at various circumstances throughout the year in 
order to acquire and assess the power production and 
related efficiency corresponding to the various parameters 
compared to the traditional solar panel (PV). Based on prior 
studies, the solar sphere displayed superior power 
production and efficiency when compared to the standard 
solar panel for the various parameters that were tested. In 
addition to this finding, the following conclusions were 
reached:

1. When compared to other shapes using the same fluid, 
the entire spherical produced the most power. The power 
was nearly four times that of a regular solar panel. 
2. Increasing the size of the solar sphere increases 
power production and the associated efficiency. 
3. In terms of the fluid used to fill the solar sphere, oil 
had a maximum power output that was 1.5 times that of 
alcohol. Alcohol, on the other hand, produced double the 
power output of water, with air producing the least power 
production of the fluids, tested [12]-[15]. 
Convection flow is the flow of fluid within the solar 
sphere, and it is found in a variety of applications, such as 
oil and natural gas transport, column reactor, air-sea gas 
transfer, ship hydrodynamics, boiling heat transfer, and 
bubble column reactors [16]-[19]. Researchers are 
interested in such convection flows because they occur in 
many engineering applications and numerical research and 
experiments aid in visualizing and understanding the 
parameters involved in this movement. Understanding and 
clarifying the flow parameters assist in defining the flow 
behavior and investigating the efficacy of the flow to 
improve the flow behavior towards the region of interest of 
the application at hand [20]-[22]. 
The goal of this research is to examine and comprehend 
the properties of flow in the solar sphere through the 
analysis of the velocity of fluid flow within the solar sphere 
using PIV. Furthermore, to investigate the influence of 
sphere thickness, sphere size, and sphere temperature on 
fluid motion and velocity. Furthermore, in order to increase 
the performance of the system to generate power and then 
maximize its efficiency, the link between these factors must 
be well defined. 
In Section 2 of this paper the experimental apparatus 
and methods were illustrated. While in Section 3 the flow 
visualization and image processing results, including the 
PIV system and data analysis were explained.  The 
conclusion was added in Section 4. 
 
II. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS AND APPARATUS  
Figure 1 depicts the setup of the intended experiment. 
The acrylic (Plexiglas) solar sphere (No.1) material gives 
optical access, to the flow inside the sphere, to facilitate 
observation as well as image processing via PIV 
measurements and permits the collection of the solar 
radiation necessary to be focused. The sphere is full of 
frying oil (sunflower oil). The sphere is supported by a 
stainless-steel stand (No. 2). 
 
 
Figure 1. The setup for the solar sphere experiment. 
A multi-junction concentrator solar cell (No. 3) is 
mounted on a stand (No. 4) beneath the solar sphere and is 
directly linked to a multi-meter (No. 5) to measure power 
production by measuring voltage and current ampere.  
The solar sphere collects solar energy from the sun and 
focuses it on a single point. This focus point is located on 
top of a collector device, which is a multi-junction cell. The 
magnifying lenses in the multi-junction cell arrangement 
focus the solar radiations onto a focused region in the cell. 
This concentrated region is linked to a heat sink. The multi-
junction cell is further subdivided into sub-cells, each of 
which is in charge of converting distinct components of the 
light into electricity. Because this device can withstand 
high temperatures and can help in radiation resistance, it 
was chosen to be utilized in this experiment to capture the 
concentrated solar energy of the focus point. The multi-
junction device is connected to a multi-meter, which is used 
to read the output current and voltage. The experiment 
setup utilized to investigate flow characterization using 
flow visualization and image processing via PIV 
measurements consists of the apparatus shown in Figure 2 
which is listed below: 
1-       As a light source, a Mini Diode-pumped solid-
state laser (DPSS) Model #SM-SEMI-2W, which is a 
double pulse laser (also known as PIV laser), is employed. 
It employs two pulse lasers to emit laser beams via an 
optical beam combiner and a light path exit. The 
wavelength of the laser is 532 nm. 
2-       The CCD scientific class digital camera, Model 
#SM-CCDB2M25, records the visualized flows. This 
camera uses a double exposure mode that is coordinated 
with the double laser pulses and has a 50 mm f/1.4, F-
Mount Lens, Model #SM-LENS5014. An external trigger 
initiates the capture. The frame grabber then sends both 
collected pictures to computer memory in real-time. A 
synchronizer generates trigger signals that are properly 
synced with the double-pulsed laser. The camera has a 
resolution of 1620×1220 (2M) and can take 25 frames per 
second (or 12.5 image pairs). The minimum exposure time 
interval in PIV mode is 200ns. 
3-       The synchronizer with USB cable, Model 
#MicroPulse 825 (MicroPulse725), provides cycle pulse 
trigger signals via the internal time base while also creating 
numerous delayed trigger signals via internal time-delay 
channels. The synchronizer is used to regulate the laser, 
digital camera(s), and frame grabber, ensuring that all of 
these diverse pieces function in perfect synchronicity. 
4-       A computer that is used to store picture data that 
has been captured by the frame grabber. It is then used by 
the Particle Image Velocity measurement system software 
to compute, display, and save the velocity field in real time. 
5- The PIV system, which is 2D PIV software with 
particle image capture and velocity analysis, employs a 
laser as an independent illumination source that may be 
employed with or without the synchronizer. If the 
synchronizer is not accessible, the laser's internal 
synchronization can be used throughout the optical path 
and laser energy setup. Also employed is a high-resolution 
2D2C 
PIV

multi-pass, 
multi-grid,

and

parameters. The frame grabber occupies a regular PCI 
(PCI-E) slot on the computer. The acquisition board's 
interface is primarily a 26-pin CamLink standard digital

camera connection interface. Digital cameras with a 
standard CamLink interface are used in the Microvec PIV 
system. It connects to the frame grabber through three 10-
meter signal lines, retains trigger signals to synchronize the 
digital cameras with the pulse laser, and then links to the 
synchronizer's output interface via coaxial signal cables via 
TTL trigger, which interfaces with the camera. When the 
synchronizer is provided as part of the PIV system, the laser 
must be set to external synchronous mode (where the 
synchronizer's 4-way delay signals are output to controls of 
the corresponding two sets of the laser flashlamp and Q-
switch) while the digital camera is set to PIV work mode. 
6- Fluorescent spherical tracer particles Model #MV-
H1020 with a diameter of 7 μm (mean 10 μm) and a density 
of 1.04 - 1.06 g/cc are used as tracer particles to see the flow 
and determine velocity vectors. 
As previously stated, the PIV measurements are 
employed in this study to produce the findings, which 
collect and calculate the velocity/velocity vectors of the 
flow inside the solar sphere, including flow visualization 
and image processing. To perform the tests within the lab, a 
lighting arrangement of 500 W Halogen lights is employed 
as a simulator instead of the sun. The laser is utilized with a 
black back sheet background to improve visibility and take 
high-quality photographs of the experiments for flow 
visualization and velocity measurements.

III. FLOW VISUALIZATION AND IMAGE PROCESSING 
RESULTS, INCLUDING THE PIV SYSTEM AND DATA 
ANALYSIS 
Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is an optical flow 
imaging technique. It made use of the acquired 
instantaneous velocity measurements as well as the related 
fluid characteristics. Tracer particles must be introduced 
into the fluid to help in the capture of velocity vectors. The 
velocity vectors will be generated by lighting the region of 
interest with the laser and then monitoring the seeded 
particles. The tracer or seeded particles are supposed to 
follow the motion of the fluid, which is evenly dispersed 
throughout the flow field, and the interrogation window, 
which has a distinct speed. When the tracer particles are in 
motion, their flow is caught by sequential imaging, which 
is then processed for additional cross-correlation, allowing 
the observed flow's speed and direction (the velocity field) 
to be calculated. Furthermore, additional processing may 
be performed using the flow vortices, flow field parameter 
distribution, speed lines, and flow lines. The configuration 
of a typical PIV system typically consists of four basic 
physical components. The digital CCD or CMOS camera 
is the first. The laser and its optical arrangement, which 
restricts the physical lit region of interest, are the second 
component. The third component is the synchronizer, 
which functions as an external trigger for regulating and 
timing both laser and cameras. As previously stated, the 
seeding particles are the fourth component. Of course, all 
of these components must be employed in conjunction with 
the fluid under investigation. The laser can be linked to 
specific lenses to transform the laser beam into a sheet or 
line ray. Finally, the optical pictures collected will be 
processed using specialist PIV software. The tracer 
particles following the movement of the fluid are emitted 
by the pulsed laser within the known time interval t, and 
the sheet light illumination by the lens group records the 
particles' instantaneous position on the CCD chip. If we 
know the displacement change of the same particle micelle 
at two times t1 and t2 from the recorded particle picture, 
we can calculate the velocity of the particle group at t1 
using the definition of velocity, as indicated in the formula 
below [23]-[29].

To begin analyzing the obtained picture, the idea of 
interpretation area must be defined. It refers to a square 
picture of a specific size in a specific location in the image, 
and the speed is acquired by executing signal processing in 
the interpretation area. Assume the system captures images 
1 and 2 in Figure 3 at two different times, t0 and t0+t. 
Obtaining two interpretation regions of the same size, 
f(m,n), in the same spot in the picture. where (m, n) denotes 
the relative location of f and g in images 1 and 2, 
respectively. Processing f and g yields the appropriate 
displacement S of the interpretation area, as indicated in 
Figure 3. 
 
 
Figure 3. The system obtains images 1 and 2. 
 
Figure 4 depicts the link between the digital signal 
transfer function and the interpretation regions f, g, and the 
displacement vector (the uppercase letters in the figure 
correspond to the lowercase Fourier transform). TSI's 
INSIGHT 4G® software is also utilized for picture and 
correlation analysis. The technique begins by analyzing the 
pictures using 6464 Interrogation Areas (IAs) using a Fast 
Fourier Transform (FFT) correlator, resulting in a 50% 
overlap of the interrogation areas. The correlation peak is 
then examined to acquire the findings of the final 
questioning region of 1616 pixels in size. The Gaussian 
curve-fitting approach with subpixel precision is used to 
determine this. The median technique, one of the post-

processing methods available in the TSI analysis program, 
is used to remove spurious vectors from velocity fields. The 
rejection rate of the vectors is roughly 3%. The Gaussian-
weighted technique replaces these rejected vectors with 
their neighbors [30]-[34]. 
In the applied image processing, an average duration of 
10 µs consecutive frames (between 2 consecutive frames) 
is utilized to discover the values of the velocity of the flow 
inside the spheres of 10 cm 15 cm, and 30 cm diameters, 
and for different thicknesses of 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 mm. These 
experiments are conducted for 3 different temperature rates 
of 35, 40, and 45oC. The velocity is determined and then 
computed for all these spheres/cases. Image processing 
calculates the flow velocity estimate at roughly 10,000 
vectors of the flow pictures. The velocity experiments are 
carried out for the entire sphere. For each example, the 
temperature, voltage, and current ampere were measured, 
hence the output power was determined. 
Figure 5 depicts a sample of images of the sphere with 
a diameter of 15 cm and a thickness of 8 mm, whereas 
Figure 6 depicts a sample of flow images for the 
experimental acrylic sphere with a diameter of 10 cm and a 
thickness of 4 mm illuminated by laser for flow 
visualization and further image processing for velocity size 
computations.

Figure 7 shows a PIV vector plot with an instantaneous 
velocity field (vectors sample) of the flow within the sphere 
of 15 cm diameter and 3 mm thickness at a temperature of 
35C measured by PIV between the first frame and frame 
number 200 in order to easily distinguish the flow inside 
the sphere since the flow is quite sluggish. Figure 8 
illustrates a sample of the immediately dispersed velocity 
vector of the flow in a sphere of 15 cm diameter and 5 mm 
thickness measured by PIV between the first and 80th 
frames at a temperature of 35C. Figure 9 illustrates a 
sample of the immediately dispersed velocity vector of the 
flow in a sphere of 15 cm diameter and 8 mm thickness 
measured by PIV between the first and frame number 200 
at a temperature of 35C. Figure 10 demonstrates the result 
of the flow visualization and vorticity of the flow in the 
sphere of 10 cm diameter and 6 mm thickness measured by 
PIV between the first and the 40th frame at a temperature of 
45C.

The velocity of the fluid (particles) at the top of the 
sphere is clearly higher than the velocity of the seeded 
particles in other regions of the fluid motion, as shown by 
these figures. Because there are many interaction types 
between the flow of the liquid and the upper part of the 
inside wall of the sphere, the flow generated on the top of 
the sphere is considered an appropriate technique that aids 
in the detailed investigation of the flow regime during the

flow motion from the bottom of the sphere to the top of the 
sphere. Furthermore, the liquid flow characteristic at the 
top region does not behave similarly to other flow regions. 
This is because the fluid flow on the top reaches the upper 
wall and reacts with it by mirroring the direction downward. 
As a result, the upper half of the spherical wall guides, 
directs, and reflects the fluid flow, whereas the flow in 
other places delays the fluid. Actually, the interaction 
between the fluid flow and the spherical wall is extremely 
evident. As a result, this inquiry and its accompanying data 
assist in determining the entrainment flow in the downward 
direction. This also encourages research into the relative 
velocity expression and its reaction and flow behavior to 
the encirclement liquid.

sphere of 10 cm diameter and 6 mm thickness (1-40 frame) 
 
The complete explanation of the flow process within 
the sphere may be presented and summarized using the 
resulting figures as follows. The produced convection flow 
pattern is equally harmonic around the sphere center, where 
the movements were primarily caused inside the fluid as a 
result of the tendency of the fluid with higher temperature 
and lower density to rise and the fluid with lower 
temperature and higher density to sink with the effect of 
gravity, resulting in heat transfer. Furthermore, the flow is 
observed to be steady and uniform around the center, with 
the exception of the region of the top surface where the 
fluid flow impinges and reflects. The rising flow around the 
center is steered by the sphere's wall, resulting in a 
significant fluid flow formation towards the upper region 
of the sphere. The flow evolves as follows: the maximum 
velocity for the upward flow momentum is obtained 
towards the upper top region of the sphere. When it is 
reflected downhill on the wall, the orientation of the 
upward flow changes quickly from an upwards direction to 
a downward direction flow. Following the formation of two 
circular liquid currents around the center, and after a 
specific amount of time has passed, those circular currents 
encourage the center of the sphere with a scale circulation 
throughout the complete fluid layers. 
Figures 11, 12, and 13 show the relationship between 
the sphere thickness of 10 and 14, and 30 cm diameter and 
the fluid velocity for different temperatures of 35, 40, and 
45oC and for a sphere thickness of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 mm. The 
fluid velocity is calculated to be the average velocity of the 
top region under the wall surface. Because this is the more 
complicated area where the fluid has many interactions 
with the upper surface.

velocity for different  temperatures and for a sphere diameter of 10 cm

Figure 14 illustrates the relationship between the sphere 
thickness of 10 cm diameter with the output power and 
efficiency for a temperature of 35oC and for a sphere 
thickness of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 mm. The current-voltage 
characteristics were plotted for each sphere thickness of 3, 
4, 5, 6, and 8 mm separately. The optimum operating point 
is at the maximum power point. The values of these 
maximum power points were accumulated in Figure 14, It 
is clear from this figure that the output power and 
efficiency increase when using lower acrylic thickness. 
Hence, using a 3 mm sphere thickness is the best.

According to the figures, the fluid flow approaches the 
top 
spherical 
surface 
as 
the 
velocity 
increases. 
Furthermore, when comparing the velocity vectors, it is 
discovered that when the spherical thickness lowers, the 
velocity increases. Whereas the average velocity of the 4 
mm thickness sphere is nearly double that of the 6 mm 
thickness sphere in the region of the top surface of the 
sphere, and the average velocity of the 6 mm thickness 
sphere is nearly double that of the 8 mm thickness sphere 
in the region of the top surface of the sphere. Also, as the 
temperature increases the fluid velocity increases. 
Moreover, when the size of the sphere increases the fluid 
velocity also increases. Furthermore, it is acknowledged 
that the output power and the efficiency of the 4 mm thick 
sphere are greater than that of the 6 mm thick sphere. In 
reality, as the thickness of this acrylic solar sphere rises, the 
amount of solar radiation received is influenced and 
limited, becoming less. As a result, the output power is 
decreased. Hence, the greater the thickness of the acrylic, 
the less electricity is produced by the sun. When the 
thickness is reduced, more power is produced, resulting in 
improved efficiency. As a result, the thinner the acrylic 
coating, the more solar light is absorbed by the PV photons. 
As a result, the larger the output power, the higher the 
efficiency. 
Finally, the behavior of flow motion within the solar 
sphere was explored in an attempt to improve power 
generation performance. The examination in this research 
effort was carried out to understand the influence of sphere 
thickness on fluid flow, which is elucidated in this 
document, in order to increase fluid flow performance and, 
hence, maximize the related efficiency. The results 
revealed that the thickness of the sphere considerably alters 
the flow structure and fluid velocity value. As a result, a 
thinner sphere should be employed to increase the 
efficiency of the solar sphere. Furthermore, the thinner the 
acrylic coating, the more sunlight is absorbed by the PV 
photons. As a result, the larger the output power, the higher 
the efficiency. 
 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
The flow visualization and image analysis using PIV 
measurements on the fluid flow within a solar sphere and 
the velocity motion of the filled oil fluid were carried out 
in this study to optimize the flow behavior. The flow 
velocity and its influence on sphere thickness are calculated. 
The collected findings demonstrated a clear influence of 
spherical thickness and temperature on fluid flow. The 
following is an overview of the key conclusions: 
1. The output power and efficiency increase when using 
lower acrylic thickness. Hence, using a 3 mm sphere 
thickness is the best. 
2. When the temperature increases the fluid velocity 
increases and when the size of the sphere increases the fluid 
velocity also increases 
3. The fluid flow velocity was discovered to grow and 
climb in value to the upper surface wall of the sphere, the 
mean velocity magnitude was determined, and it was 
discovered to be greater in the region of the top surface than 
the starting velocity in the other regions.  
4. The fluid velocity data showed that the velocity 
increases as the thickness of the sphere decreases, and the 
mean velocity magnitude progressively increases as one 
rises within the sphere. 
5. The output power and the associated efficiency of the 
solar sphere increase with respect to the properties of lower 
sphere thickness. The thinner the thickness of the acrylic 
layer, the higher the sunlight absorbed by the PV photons. 
Subsequently, the higher the output power, which results to 
get higher the efficiency.
