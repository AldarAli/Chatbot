Abstract—This article is about the control and management of
smart-grid and new generation of electrical systems. In fact,
most of the advanced technologies and systems depend on
energy, especially electrical energy; even the daily activities of
simple consumers, their tools and equipments are based on
electric power. The developed solutions remain within the
boundaries of existing and limited systems and do not meet the
requirements
of
the
future
generation
of
the
electrical
networks, such as including intermittent energy resources, and
electric vehicles. In this research, we present a solution based
on the use of an adaptive multi-agents architecture to control
and manage smart-grid. The main output of this paper is an
explanation of our solution, the most important points, and the
main parts of the proposed architecture.

I.
INTRODUCTION
The management and control of electrical systems
presents an issue with many facets. In fact, such important
topic
involves
several
stakeholders,
including
states and governments,
consumers,
environmental interest groups and local officials
etc.,
to discuss and interchange points of view [1].
The discussions focus on two main issues and challenges.
The former is on how to design the best system that meets all
requirements in quality and quantity [2], while the latter is on
how to migrate the existing networks to a smarter system,
especially with the current aged infrastructure.
The importance of the smart-grid concept lies in the fact
that it is the best choice to meet the requirements of the near
future electrical system [3].
To satisfy the smart grid requirements, there is a need for
a lot of investments, new energy markets, policies and
pricing, and appropriate legislation. In addition to these
issues, there are many scientific challenges, such as the
introduction
of
new
Information
and
Communication
Technologies (ICT) and the development of models and
standards [4][5].
Our approach focuses on the information and data
management with consideration of other aspects, such as
physical and electrical components, business objectives and
market policies. The idea is based on the use of multi-agent
architecture for the management and control of smart-grid
with adaptive functionality.
The main questions discussed in this paper concern the
choice of an agent-based architecture [6], the interest of its
adaptive nature [7][8][9], and the skeleton outline of the
solution developed.
This article is intended to answer these questions and try
to makes a pathway that helps smart-grid designers to design
and model adaptive multi-agents architectures by defining a
minimum basic architecture that can be extended later,
according to the smart-grid specifies to design and manage.
In future work, the solution will be implemented on a micro
grid to test, evaluate and optimize it. Additionally, the
solution will focus on some aspects that are considered the
most important, e.g., real-time processing of information,
self-healing, and system security.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section II
presents studies and works on smart-grid elaborated by
committees and different stakeholders. Section III briefly
explains the utility of the proposed approach. Section IV
presents in more detail the principles of adaptive multi-agent
architectures. The proposed approach is explained in Section
V.
Section VI
presents
advantages of the developed
architecture. Finally, a conclusion summarizes the main
aspects illustrated.
II.
STATE OF THE ART
The electrical smart systems attract more and more the
interest of nations, laboratories, academics, economists and
all types of electricity customer (commercial buildings,
industrial factories and residential consumer). Several studies
and approaches are proposed to find effective solutions to
smart-grid challenges, namely, the model developed by the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [10],
the
European
Union,
which
proposes
a
Smart
Grid
Architecture Model (SGAM) [11], the Institute of Electrical
and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) proposition [12] and the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) one [13].
All these models give just standards and models to design
architectures for smart-grid and do not propose detailed and
practical solutions. However, these models play an important
role and invite designers and researchers to complete the
work based on their results.

Other
solutions
exist
and
benefit
from
advanced
technologies, such as cloud computing [14] or market-driven
approaches [15]. Although they are agent-based solutions,
they do not explain and fully address the concept of
adaptability and the basic agent structure, which represents
the basic building block of the multi-agents architecture.
We pointed out in our approach the importance of the
system adaptability with unexpected scenarios and its
capacity to pass critical situations. We also present the
structure and behavior of the architecture core component
(the agent).
III.
NEED FOR NEW APPROACHES
The information systems of large and complicated
projects, such as electrical networks, are characterized by a
very advanced level of complexity. They have become
increasingly difficult to manage because reference systems
and emerging applications become progressively more
distributed, open, handling large amounts of information and
having new capabilities to work in cooperation and adapt
their
behavior
with
changes.
On
the
other
hand,
administrators and electrical networks managers have an
increased
need
for
effective
management
and
control
systems with dynamic architecture. Added to the structure
flexibility, the electrical network must be able to be managed
as independent parts (case of several micro grids) with local
processing of information and autonomous management
units and components or in cooperation (case of entirely
system) [14] with the ability to interchange data and
messages. We chose agent-based architectures because it
recognizes criteria and capacities to meet the complex and
dynamic systems that need powerful and flexible approach
and present an adequate field and environment for test and
validation of Multi Agents Systems (MAS). This situation is
almost the same for all systems, especially more complex
systems, such as smart-grids. This heterogeneity, large scale
and distributive architecture exclude all opportunities to
express all necessary knowledge to manage and control the
system, hence the necessity to develop an adaptive multi-
agent model with the ability to change its behavior according
to changes and environmental disturbances.
Such a model, which can adapt its behavior and its
internal structure with the situation of the system, requires
self-observation mechanism to detect emerging events.
IV.
ADAPTIVE AGENTS -BASED ARCHITECTURES
A.
Adaptive Multi-Agens Systems
Multi-agent systems come as a result of research
evolving a set of theories, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI),
Expert Systems (ES) and object-oriented systems to exceed
their limits. Multi-agent systems are used to model complex,
heterogeneous,
nonlinear
and
especially
dynamic
and
evolving systems. This requires adaptive agents capable of
dynamically acquiring knowledge not introduced earlier by
the designer or the system operator, enabling them to adapt
their behavior at the individual level (agents) and collective
level (organization of agents) [7][8][9].
B.
Differents Models and Architectures
Multi-agent systems have started with two basic models:
a first reactive agent [7] (used for cases of immediate
response and not much individual intelligence; however, a
collective intelligence is required) and a second cognitive
agent that is smarter and has advanced processing and
reasoning capabilities. This type of architecture is favored in
cases of complex decisions.
The two models presented are subsequently emerged to
find a new architecture that benefit from the speed of the
reactive agent and the intelligence of the cognitive one. This
new hybrid architecture traces a path between the two
approaches by combining reactive and cognitive properties,
typically implemented in different modules.

granularity [7]
Modular architectures [7] have passed the hybrid model.
They make the agent as an open system benefit from the
modularity introduced and the ability to exchange modules
between agents.
Hybrid architectures (traditional) do not resolve the
problem of granularity; in fact, they are not able to support a
design system whose agents have varying granularities. This
gave birth to a new generation of operational and generic
architectures [7]. They are based on platforms with reduced
core and basic features such as communication with other
agents and environment entities. This idea is to have a basic
building block for the development of a model of adaptive
architecture that can be integrated into various systems.
This model allows the integration of all architectures,
starting from a minimal agent, and then adding the desired
functionality by successive refinements.
V.
ADAPTIVE MULTI-AGENT SYSTEM APPROACH TO
MANAGE AND CONTROL SMART-GRID
A.
Developed Approach
As explained earlier in this paper, complex problems and
computer systems require the modeling and design of
computer systems, which become too complex.
Therefore, the trend is moving more and more towards
the development of new approaches integrating adaptability
and self-organization capacities [17].
To respond to the different objectives of smart-grid, the
mechanism of self-organization is an interesting way to
design an adequate management and control system. This
enables the smart-grid to adapt its behavior to environmental
changes in an unsupervised manner.

SMART 2014 : The Third International Conference on Smart Systems, Devices and Technologies

The idea developed in this paper presents an approach in
this context designed for smart-grids. It is based on the
concept of distributed and self-agents learning that are
guided by a set of local decision rules that are refined
continuously under the influence of the environment. This
approach is based on several theories, mainly Adaptive
Multi-Agent Systems (AMAS) [16][17]. Such a system is
composed of several types of agents (load agent, generation
agent, transmission agent, distribution agent, etc.) that are
equipped with local knowledge and a representation of their
environment.
They
make
their
decisions
using
this
knowledge,
their
cooperative
social
behavior
and
adaptability skills and capacities (see Figure 1).
For example, the following agents are part of the
proposed architecture:
•
Load agent: responsible for the management
and control of electrical appliances in homes,
companies and factories. It has a dual role (two
directions), it routes requests energy consuming
from appliances to network controller and
monitors the implementation of the political
system.
•
Generation agent: it manages one or more
resources of energy and decides the amount of
electricity to produce with reference to customer
demand and the capacity of the resources. This
agent
is
implemented
in
several
forms,
depending on the resources it manages. In fact,
management
of
intermittent
resources
and
current fossil-based resources is different, risk
and danger of nuclear power plants is not the
same in friendly- nature resources.
Therefore, each agent adapts its behavior according to its
position in the network by choosing the features and the
necessary means to fulfill (perform) the tasks entrusted to it.
Figure 1.
Agent Architecture [16].
The first step in the proposed bottom-up design approach
is to identify the agents; then, to ensure that the local agent is
or trying to be in cooperative interactions with other agents.
Neural networks can be used to identify agents, which
provide well-defined agents on a set of parameters and
criteria defining each agent and specifying its architecture.
The second step is to define the agent’s components,
because each agent in this architecture is divided into several
proactive
components.
This
allows
reusing
of
these
components by different agents by instantiating them if
necessary. It should be noted that each component can be
reactive or cognitive, which allows building hybrid agents
not only hybrid architectures, and this is one of the most
important criteria of this approach inspired
from the
architecture Development and Implementation of Multi-
Agent Systems (DIMA).
The components of an agent are always chosen around a
core (main component that contains the component identifier
(ID)). This main component is the only one that cannot be
changed, all others can be modified or changed and these
interactions (see Figure 2).
To present these components, the notation used is that of
Unified Modeling Language (UML) [7]. It defines any
component as a set of classes with their methods.
Figure 2.

Main Component: It contains the basic informations
of the agent and the component such as their IDs, their
statements, etc.

essential in the architecture. This module will guarantee

reliable communication with other agents. It is responsible
for the delivery of messages between agents according to
the appropriate protocol conversation.
With this approach, the design of agents is operated in a
relatively simple manner, starting with a minimal agent and
adding the desired modules according to its mission.
Several modules (components) can be attributed to agents
such
as
components
controlling
energy
generators,
consumers, network transmission or distribution, etc.
C.
Agent Communication Language
Designing MAS requires coordination and cooperation
between its agents to perform their tasks. So, designers
should formalize how the agents coordinate themselves. In
fact, like any community assembling several individuals, a
common and conventional language must be specified to
facilitate communication within this shared environment.
This is the case in all communities (social, IT, scientific,
etc.). To this end, the Foundation for Intelligent Physical
Agents (FIPA) [19] has defined some specifications and
standards for the use of multi agents systems.
Many languages have been created such as Agent
Communication Language (ACL) [19] and Knowledge
Query and Manipulation Language (KQML) [19] for use in
MAS development.
ACL is a FIPA specification-based language. It is the
most preferred in the development of multi-agent systems
[18]. It defines a specific structure for the messages
circulating between the agents. This structure includes
attributes containing information about the agents involved
in the conversation, i.e., the sender, receiver(s), the message
content, etc. (see Figure 3).
An
ACL
message
should
contain
the
following
parameters [18]:
•
Communication
type
(performative):
this
parameter indicates whether the message is a
request, a reply, a piece of information, etc.;
•
List of the participants in the conversation: it
contains information on the sender and the
receiver(s), and reply-to fields, including the
names of the corresponding agents;
•
Message content;
•
Description of the content: the used language,
encoding and vocabulary (ontology);
•
Conversation control parameters: such as a
conversation identifier and protocol.
Figure 3.
Sample ACL message, using the default ontology [18].
The example in Figure 3 presents a sample ACL
message, but in complex conversations, using a common
language may not be sufficient, so ontology (i.e., formal
representations of knowledge) should be specified to define
the vocabulary that agents use in their conversations.
D.
Inheritance Notion
A set of generic classes (Framework) defined different
types of agents and the services they provide. These generic
classes are inherited by subclasses to detail the specifics
depending on the role of this container agent. For example,
classes of agents that control the electricity generators inherit
a generic management generator class and redefine methods
and may add new attributes and / or methods according to
the characteristics of their resources (intermittent, un-
intermittent, permanent, seasonal, etc.) hence the obligation
to assign any agent an adequate adaptive design starting with
the same generic model (class).
Figure 4 presents an example of inheritance relationship,
in fact, classes Intermittent_RES and Permanent_RES inherit
the standard methods of all generators of energy from class
Class_Generator.
Classes
Intermittent_RES
and
Permanent_RES
are
in
turn
inherited
by
the
classes
Solar_Panel,
Turbine_Wind,
Fossile_RES,
and
NuclearPowerPlants which redefine the methods to their suit
characteristics.
This property greatly simplifies the task to the designer
who benefits from a framework containing almost all basic
classes; otherwise, its task is reduced to mapping classes and
redefining their methods.

agent
E.
Decision-Making Structure
In a smart-grid, like any complex and dynamic system,
an agent may often be faced with dilemmas in the decision-
85

SMART 2014 : The Third International Conference on Smart Systems, Devices and Technologies

making process. In fact, an agent must have a decision-
making structure enabling it to evaluate the situation and
decide what to do.
The proposed approach excluded the idea of predicting
all possible cases for the simple reason: it is not feasible
except for small systems and / or simple scenarios and of
course this is not the case for smart-grid where different
variations cannot be known a priori. The architecture of the
agent, in this case, must provide the ability to easily adapt
the decision-making process to the changing environment.
With its decision-making mechanism, an agent needs two
sets: a first set of conditions to be used to test the context of
the agent and a second set of actions (methods) that modify
the state of agent and / or its environment.
The decision-making process can be described by a Petri
network or Programmable Logic Controller (PCL) whose
states are the situations that can take the agent (see Figure 5).
VI.
PROPOSED APPROACH ADVANTAGES
The approach presented in this paper is based on the
decomposition of smart-grid into subsystems managed by
agents that have dynamic modularity. It benefits from the
properties of adaptive multi agent systems such as:
•

•

change their behavior and change their internal
structures regularly by adding or removing
modules (components) and services;

The solution differs from others [14][15][18] by a set of
criteria which proves its high performances when we
compared it with other solutions (see Table 2).

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The paper presents an agent-based architecture given as a
solution for the problem of smart-grid management and tries
to pass the boundaries of current solutions to a new
dimension of autonomous steering (management, control)
system. To achieve such a system, we must overcome many
difficulties and challenges mainly modeling smart-grid and
designing its information system that presents a delicate and
crucial task. In fact, the theoretical model will define policies
of the real networks.
In order to achieve a consistent system, it is strongly
recommended to divide the system into subsystems easy to
identify and model. This division must be justified and
follows a systemic methodology. It represents our next
object of work and it should provide the desired benefits to
the proposed architecture.
