Abstract—Control channels play a key role in the evalua-
tion of mobile system performance. Authors have evaluated
the performance of control channels implementation in a Long
Term Evolution (LTE) system. The paper deals with simulating
a complete signal processing chain for the Physical Control
Format Indicator Channel (PCFICH) and Physical Downlink
Control Channel (PDCCH) in an LTE system, Release 8.
We implemented a complete signal processing chain for down-
link control channels as an extension of the existing MATLAB
LTE downlink simulator. The paper shows results of the
PCFICH and PDCCH control channel computer performance
analysis in various channel conditions. The presented results
can be compared with the performance of data channels.

I. INTRODUCTION
Link level simulators are typically focused in the perfor-
mance analysis of trafﬁc channels [1], [2]. For an overall
system performance and comparison with real network de-
ployment it is necessary to include control channels in the
simulations. Control channels are typically designed with
more robust forward error correction and modulation than
trafﬁc channels. In the case of the 3GPP LTE system, the Or-
thogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)
access method and robust scrambling of control channel
information is used [3], [4].
Our motivation is to implement control channels as an ex-
tension of the existing MATLAB LTE downlink simula-
tor developed at Vienna University of Technology. After
completion of the model of control channels, we can look
into the inﬂuence of the propagation environment to overall
throughput of the LTE system, using computer simulation.
The paper is organized as follows. First the LTE system
is described brieﬂy. The next part brings a short description
of the signal processing chain of surveyed control channels.
Simulation and their results are mentioned in the third part
and it is summarized in the conclusion.
II. LTE PHYSICAL CHANNELS
The LTE physical layer in a downlink includes a triplet of
control channels [5], [6]. The list of LTE control channels in
downlink and their control information is shown in Table I.

The above-mentioned control physical channels are not
used to transfer information from higher layers [7]. They
are not associated with transport channels. This article deals
with signal processing and Bit error rate (BER) in the Phys-
ical Control Format Indicator Channel and Physical Down-
link Control Channel, performance analysis of the Physical
Hybrid-ARQ Control Channel is not included.
A. Physical Control Format Indicator Channel (PCFICH)
Via this channel, the Control Format Indicator (CFI) is
transmitted. The value stored in CFI determines the number
of resource elements in the resource grid (in time domain)
carrying the data of the PDCCH control channel. It deter-
mines a PDCCH control area in each subframe in downlink.
PCFICH is transmitted in the ﬁrst OFDM symbol in the
resource grid [3].
The CFI parameter takes values 1, 2 or 3 only. The block
diagram of PCFICH signal processing is shown in Fig. 1.
The ﬁrst operation in the signal processing chain is channel
coding. A bit sequence of 32 bits in length is assigned to each
value in CFI, according to Table II.
A codeword of 32 bits in length is scrambled with
a pseudo-random scrambling sequence, which is unique for

ulation and this block of complex-value symbols is mapped
into ν-layers, depend on the number of transmitting anten-
nas, where ν = {1, 2, 4}. In the case of one transmitting
antenna, layer mapping is not used. In the case of one trans-
mitting antenna, transmit diversity precoding is not provided
[8]. In the case of two or four transmitting antennas, it is
necessary to provide precoding for transmit diversity.
Complex symbols for each transmitting antenna are
grouped to quaternary symbols, so-called symbol quadru-
plets, which are mapped to deﬁned positions in the resource
grid [9]. Furthermore, a IFFT operation with symbols in the
resource grid is performed and cyclic preﬁx (CP) is inserted.
After passing through the channel, CP is removed and
FFT is performed. In a resource demapping block, PCFICH
symbols are collected. When using more than one trans-
mitting antenna, MIMO detection is provided. Complex-
value symbols are demodulated and descrambled by pseudo-
random sequention which is the same as in the transmitter.
The last part of the signal processing chain is a CFI
codeword detection block.
B. Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH)
Physical Downlink Control Channel is the most important
control channel in a downlink. It supports signalling for data
channels in downlink and uplink. Via this channel Downlink
Control Information (DCI) is transmitted.

PDCCH processing chain.
PDCCH supports various formats of DCI messages
[10]. They contain information about resource scheduling
for downlink and uplink, Transmit Power Commands (TPC),
etc.
The block diagram of the PDCCH signal processing chain
is shown in Fig. 2. Individual DCI messages of different
formats are channel encoded. Cyclic redundancy check
(CRC-16) of 16 bits in length is added to the DCI mes-
sage [4]. Afterwards, the CRC is scrambled with a Radio
Network Temporary Identiﬁer (RNTI) value and antenna’s
mask if needed. The next block in the processing chain
is a convolutional encoder with coding rate R=1/3. In the
rate matching block, interleaving is provided and decreases
the length of the encoded DCI message.
These operations with all DCI messages are provided
in parallel and these messages come into a PDCCH multi-
plexing block. The encoded DCI messages are encapsulated
into so-called Control Channel Elements (CCE). These el-
ements are mapped into individual PDCCH formats. The
PDCCH frame is scrambled in the same way as in the case
of PCFICH.
Scrambled bits are modulated by QPSK modulation and
then form a block of complex-value symbols which are
mapped into ν-layers and precoding for transmit diversity is
performed. These symbols, split into ν-parallel streams and
mapped to the quadruplets of symbols are interleaved using
Free-quadratic Permutation Polynomial technology (QPP).
When the interleaving is performed, quadruplets are mapped
into deﬁned positions in the resource grid. A distribution
of PDCCH quadruplets is given by a value in CFI.
Further, complex-valued symbols are transferred into
the time domain by using an IFFT and CP is added.
After passing through the channel, on the receiving side,
CP is removed and FFT is performed. In the resource
demapper block, a matrix of PDCCH symbols and a matrix
of corresponding channel coefﬁcients H−1
PDCCH are collected.
Reverse interleaving is performed with both of these matri-
ces. Modiﬁed symbols lead into the MIMO detector and soft-
demodulator. A vector of demodulated bits is descrambled
by the same cell-speciﬁc pseudo-random sequence as in the
transmitting side and blind decoding is performed.
III. SIMULATIONS
Performance analysis of the LTE link level simulator
is usually presented only for trafﬁc channels [1]. The fun-
damental performance analysis of control channels is men-
tioned in [11] for PCFICH and PHICH. Similar problem
examines [12], which presents PDCCH performance analysis
results in AWGN channel model.
As was mentioned, the Link level simulator was used
as a basic physical layer model of LTE. The simulator
was developed at the Vienna University of Technology
[1]. The model was extended by adding control channels.
A performance analysis was done; the physical layer BER

The simulator works with an FDD frame structure
only. Due to a system bandwidth of 1.4 MHz, there were
6 resource element blocks (RB). In the case of using the CP
with normal duration, there are 7 OFDM symbols in one
slot (the ﬁrst OFDM symbol in the slot has greater duration
than the others [3]). In the case of using the CP with

and Table V. All used fading channel models are included
in the basic LTE simulator.
A. Performance Analysis of the PCFICH
The results of the PCFICH control channel transmission
simulation and subsequently, analysis of BER depending
on the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) for all antenna con-
ﬁguration and models of used transmission channels are
listed in this section. The BER is calculated from the
two- bit CFI values at the beginning and at the end of
the transmission chain. The PCFICH BER curves sorted
according to the available antenna conﬁgurations and both
types of CP are shown in Fig. 3 to 7.
The summarized results of PCFICH BER in conﬁguration
with normal CP are shown in Table VI. The summarized
results of PCFICH BER in conﬁguration with extended
CP are shown in Table VII. Here we see values of SNR
at which the BER in PCFICH channel reaches the refer-
ence level of 10−4. In the presented ﬁgures, observe the
BER curves for conﬁguration with normal CP length and
extended CP length are without marked differences. The

IV. CONCLUSION
In this paper, the PCFICH and PDCCH LTE downlink
control channels were analyzed and simulated. The paper
is focused on studying two selected control channels due
to their functions being linked together. The performance
of these two control channels was analyzed in AWGN chan-
nel model and in basic types of fading channels. As we can
see from the presented graphs, the PCFICH BER is markedly
lower than the PDCCH BER. It is given by the size of
transmitted data and used channel coding. While in the
case of the PCFICH channel, a two-bit CFI codeword is
carried and this codeword is spread with SF = 16, whereas
in the case of the PDCCH, many more bits are transmitted.
In particularly bad cases of some fade channels, the used
convolutional encoder fails, despite the use of other error
protection techniques.
The BER curves for normal or extended CP length
are without marked differences. In the case of PCFICH
analysis, usage of transmitting diversity brings expected
results. In the case of PDCCH analysis, results from the
antenna conﬁguration with one transmitting and one receiv-
ing antenna (SISO mode) are absolutely unusable in all
types of fading channels for normal and extended CP length.
However, these are only results from computer analysis.
In a real LTE system, the SISO mode is very usable.
In the case of four transmitting and one receiving antenna
for extended CP length, the BER curves for Pedestrian B and
Typical Urban channel model reach a BER value of 10−3
only. It is caused by ISI in this computer simulation.
As a further phase of the downlink control channel
analysis, simulations impacting BER in control channels
on overall throughput of the LTE system will be performed.
