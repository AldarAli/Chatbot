Abstract—Apart from the probabilistic model and the model of 
2-tuple linguistic representations, a new extension of the fuzzy 
set, known as the hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set can be seen 
as the third representative of linguistic approaches. In this 
paper, we focus on multi-expert decision-making problems, in 
which a group of physicians are independently asked for 
assessing the effectiveness of a set of treatment therapies. Our 
goal is to rank the effectiveness of treatment modalities from 
the most recommended to the contraindicated. Two individual 
prostate cancer patients have been taken into account in the 
practical studies. For the first patient, the probabilistic model 
and the model of 2-tuple linguistic representations have been 
adopted to accomplish the medical application. Whereas, for 
the second patient, the approach of hesitant fuzzy linguistic 
term set has been used to make the medication prognoses. 
Moreover, the continuous fuzzy numbers in the Left-Right 
representations are used to mathematically express the 
experts’ judgments and s-parametric membership functions 
are designed to represent the fuzzy linguistic terms.

 INTRODUCTION 
Prostate cancer is one of the most common oncological 
diseases in the world. Due to the vide heterogenicity of 
malignant potential, the prostate cancer treatment is 
multifactorial. Like in any other oncological disease, the 
cooperation of health professionals is required to make the 
consensual treatment decision. One way to facilitate the 
treatment decision-making process can be a multidisciplinary 
team meeting (MDT) - an event or a platform where decision 
makers from various relevant treatment / diagnostics fields 
meet to discuss further proceeding. 
At the Urology Department of Blekinge County 
Hospital, Karlskrona, the MDT is a forum of health care 
providers including medical oncologists, urologists, urology 
sub-specialized nurses, radiologists and pathologists. The 
aim of the conference is to assess and establish treatment 
decisions for particular patients with a spectrum of 
problematic urological conditions that cannot be easily 
solved by means of available resources. Our long term aim 
is also to discuss the best and available treatment modalities 
of all newly diagnosed cases of prostate cancer. Quite often 
the decision making process is very clear and straight 
forward, but some cases lay outside the frames of guidelines 
and recommendations. Obviously, the final choice of 
treatment is also on discretion of the patient. This modern 
approach has however two pitfalls. One of them is when 
there is a discrepancy between forum members and the other 
one is when the patient is not interested in the treatment 
modality chosen by the panel. The best solution is to obtain 
a method for solving discrepancies and simultaneously to 
find a method that shows panel’s results as treatment 
recommendations ranged from the strongly recommended to 
the contraindicated. Such approach should be very helpful 
particularly in such diseases as prostate cancer, which has a 
broad spectrum of treatment methods that can be tailored to 
the particular patient’s needs and requirements. 
Therefore, in view of the physicians’ requirement, we 
wish to extend our earlier research presented in [1] by 
adopting the approach of hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set 
(HFLTS) [2] to make the medication prognoses.  
In real life, we often are in such situations that we need 
to evaluate some information that cannot be expressed in 
numerical values. In such cases the linguistic approach [3] 
and its extensions [4]-[8] can be seen as good alternatives. 
Actually, in medical community, the information often is 
characterized vaguely and imprecisely, which makes it hard 
to be evaluated by singular numerical values. For example, 
the expressions such as “very painful”, “slightly painful”, 
“medium” and “not very painful” are just some examples of 
the linguistic evaluations of subjective pain feeling that can 
be easily formulated by the patient. Also in group decision 
making cases, when the experts assess the effectiveness of 
treatment therapies for prostate cancer patients, the semantic 
terms such as “contraindicated”, “doubtful”, “acceptable”, 
“possible”, “suitable”, “recommended” and “strongly 
recommended” can be used. Comparing to the numerical 
quantity, the linguistic approach is regarded in [9], [10] as a 
more realistic, intuitionistic and natural method. Due to the 
advantages of the linguistic approach, an extensive 
application has been presented in [11], [12]. Reasonable 
results have been reported, e.g., the adoption of the 
probabilistic model and the model of the 2-tuple fuzzy 
linguistic representations illustrated that the linguistic

effectiveness ranked from the strongly recommended to the

[1]. 
The 
linguistic 
approaches 
also 
supported investors with the valuable information how the 
capital can be effectively invested [12], [13].  
By applying three models, namely, the probabilistic 
model [14], the 2-tuple linguistic representations [15] and 
the hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets [2], we intend to rank 
the effectiveness of treatment alternatives from the most 
recommended to the contraindicated. The entire process will 
be defined in the linguistic framework. 
The construction of this paper is organized as follows. In 
Section II, the preliminaries are presented. Section III 
provides two practical studies of the medical applications. 
Finally, conclusion and discussion are given in Sections IV 
and V, respectively. 
II. 
PRELIMINARIES 
In this section, some preliminary items are presented. 
We start with the detailed description of the probabilistic 
model. 
In [14], a general property of a multi-expert decision-
making problem is considered as the introduction of a finite 
set of experts denoted by   {       } who are asked for 
selecting assessments stated in another finite set of 
alternatives   {       }. The assessments are expressed 
by semantic words in an order structured linguistic term set 
  {       }, such that       if and only if k < l. An 
example of the ordered structured linguistic term set S is 
given below. 
Example 1: Suppose that we determine a linguistic term set 
  {                    } 
consisting 
of 
s0 
= 
“contraindicated” = C,   =“doubtful”= D,   = “acceptable” 
= A,   = “possible” = P,    = “suitable” = S,    = 
“recommended” = R and   = “strongly recommended” = 
SR. 
A. The Probabilistic Model 
According to [14], the probability model mainly 
contains four steps: 
 
In the first step, all the assessments are collected in a 
judgment table as shown in Table I. Here each 
judgment 
            
and 
        
is 
expressed by the linguistic term selected from the 
linguistic term set S.  
 
We should emphasize that each linguistic term   , 
        via a fuzzy number is associated with a general 
s-parametric membership function [16]-[18] given by (1), 
where   [   ] is a symbolic reference set for all 
effectiveness terms,         and    is defined as the 
distance between of the peaks between two adjacent fuzzy 
sets.

If we set       and    in (1) as fixed values when 
choosing        , then we will obtain the membership

(2) 
 
It is worth highlighting that the statement of random 
preference     is a crucial procedure in the approach 
of probability. Since each     is stochastically 
independent of each other, it will make the 
comparisons of any two random preferences to be 
possible.  
 
 
The choice value  (  ) for each alternative      
       is computed by the choice function 
implemented by

where the quantity 
 (       ) could be 
interpreted as the probability of “the performance of 
   is as least as good as that of   ”.

Finally, by ranking the choice values obtained by the 
former step, we can select the optimal one by 
 
                ( (  )).

B. The Model of 2-tuple  Linguistic Representation 
In this model, the physicians’ judgments of the 
treatments are represented by the 2-tuples of the form of 
(    ), where      is a semantic word to which a fuzzy set 
is assigned and   [        ) is defined as a numerical 
value. 
A 2-tuple linguistic representation model presented in 
[15] composes the following steps: 
 
 
Each judgment that is expressed by a semantic word 
in Table I is changed into a 2-tuple linguistic 
representation as (    ). If     , then (    ) will 
reflect   . Next,     {(    )} is defined as a finite 
set that consists of judgments of the 2-tuple 
linguistic 
representations 
for 
each 
alternative 
          . 
 
 
Two transformations are used in this model.  
 
The first transform    maps a 2-tuple representation 
(    )    [        ) of an alternative    into a 
numerical 
value    
   [   ]                , 
in 
which    
      . The action of    is formalized by 
 
             [        )   [   ] 
                          (    )     
        
(5) 
 
We explicate the performance of    by the following 
example. 
 
Example 2: Let   {       }  In Table II the 
assessment of   , given by expert     is expressed by the 
semantic term    = “acceptable” =A. By the model of 2-tuple 
linguistic representation we can employ the judgment (A, 0) 
presented in Table III for    = “acceptable” =A

and    . The 2-tuple linguistic representations for other 
judgments are aggregated in Table III. 
Due to the first transformation, the 2-tuple representation 
of (A, 0) can be performed as a numerical value     
     
       , which belongs to the interval [0, 6]. 
Furthermore,     {(   ) (   ) (   ) (   )} consists 
of the judgments of the 2-tuple linguistic representations for 
alternative   . 
In addition, we use the notation,      to represent the 
arithmetic mean of the sum of    
  , in which i = 1, …, n and j 
= 1, …, p. The computation of     is given by 
 
     
 ∑    
  
 
   
  
(6) 
 
Example 3: From Table III we obtain     {(   ) 
(   ) (   ) (   )}  {(    ) (    ) (    ) (    )}, 
which leads to    
             
             
   
      and     
          According to (6), the 
arithmetic mean of     is equal to 
 
 (       )     . 
The second transformation    can be regarded as an 
inverse of the first one, i.e., it maps the numerical value 
      into a 2-tuple (    ) by  
 
                  [        ) 
     (    )  
(7) 
 
Here    has the closest index label to     , the interval of 
[   ] represents the space consisting of the semantic label 
indices in the linguistic term set   {  }        . 
Example 4: Let   {       }. According to (6),     
 
 (       )      . Since 1.75 is closer to    than to

  , then we choose    as the semantic word. The difference 
between 1.75 and 2 is 0.25, and 1.75 lies to the left of 2. 
Therefore, we choose –0.25 to be the value of  . By means 
of the second transformation,   (    )  (        ), 
which is depicted in Figure 1.

The third step contains the computation of the 
arithmetic mean  ̅  
  of 2-tuples for each alternative 
          , This is formalized by 
 
 ̅  
    (   )  
(8) 
 
Since the arithmetic means, supplied from the previous 
step, are presented by 2-tuples, a computational technique to 
compare the arithmetic mean for each alternative proposed in 
[15] is given as follows. 
 
 
Let (     ) and (     ) be two 2-tuples linguistic 
representations, with each one representing a 
counting of information as follows: 
1) if    , then (     ) is smaller than (     ). 
2) if    , we check the following conditions: 
if      , 
then 
(     ) 
and 
(     ) 
represents the same information. 
if      , then (     ) is smaller than 
(     )  
if      , then (     ) is greater than 
(     )  
 
 
At last, by comparing the arithmetic values with 
each other and ranking the alternatives, the optimal 
alternative(s) will be obtained. 
C. The Hesitant fuzzy Linguistic Term Sets 
For better understanding of the later application of the 
hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS) in making 
medication prognosis for the second prostate cancer patient, 
we need shortly review the conception of the hesitant fuzzy 
linguistic term set [2]. 
Definition 1: Let   {       } be a linguistic term set. A 
hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set, denoted by   , is an 
ordered finite subset of the consecutive linguistic terms of S. 
 
The empty HFLTS and the full HFLTS for elements 
    are defined as follows [2]: 
 
Empty HFLTS:   (s) =  , 
 
Full HFLTS:   (s) =    
 
Example 5: Let us assume that   {                 } is a 
linguistic term set describing the effectiveness of some 
treatment schemes for prostate cancer patients. If    = 
                      , 
                   , 
                 , 
                 , 
   
                 , 
and 
   
= 
                      =     , then a HFLTS might be 
  ( )  {        } = {     }                     . 
 
We still suppose that   {  }, i =1, …, n represents a 
set including n types of treatment alternatives,    {  }  j = 
1, …, p, denotes a collection of p experts and    {  }, l = 0, 
…,  , consists of     linguistic assessments. We use the 
combination of comparative terms and the words selected 
from S to express the judgments     (the judgments of 
   referring to treatment   ). Especially, S contains the 
elements ordered in such a way that       if and only if 
   ,           [14]. It is worth highlighting that each 
   is represented by a continuous fuzzy number in the Left-
Right form, (L-R form) [19]. The aggregated preferences 
from individual experts are presented in Table IV.

Sets   
   contain these elements of S which consider the 
judgments    .   
   ⊆ S ,i = 1, …, n, j = 1, …, p. By utilizing 
the operation of union on sets   
   on each row, the new 
generated HFLTS,    , i = 1, …, n, becomes a subset of the 
linguistic term set S and obtains all conceivable effectiveness 
assessments. Subsequently, the union of all the elements in 
    yields the effectiveness of each alternative denoted by 
   (  ) =  (  ). We illustrate this by Example 6. 
 
Example 6: Consider three alternatives {        } ⊂ A 
which represent three different kinds of treatment schemes. 
Three experts {        } ⊂ E express their preferences about 
these treatment alternatives by combining comparative terms 
and words selected from the linguistic term set S = 
{                 }, in which    = “contraindicated” = “C”, 
   = “acceptable” = “A”,    = “possible” = “P”,    = 
“suitable” = “S”,    = “recommended” = “R”,    = “strongly 
recommended” = “SR”. Table V displays the collection of 
preferences and Table VI shows the HFLTS’s subset of S.

We use the operation of union on the sets   
   for each 
row, denoted by     ⋃   
  , i, j = 1, … , 3, to obtain all 
possible effectiveness assessments for each alternative.

    {     }  {   }  { }  {           } and     
{   }  {     }  {   }   {         } = {              }. 
Hence, the effectiveness assessments of       and    can be 
given as follows: 
   (  )                 , 
   (  )                 , 
   (  )                      
 
In the HFLTS, the judgment expressions based on 
comparative terms like, e.g., between … and …, greater than 
… or less than …, [2] will be used to supply the preferences. 
Symbolically, we denote “between acceptable and possible” 
as [A, P], “less than possible” as   P and “greater than 
suitable” as   . Single words such as “contraindicated” are 
abbreviated as “C”.  
 
After obtaining the sets     containing all conceivable 
effectiveness assessments, we would like to utilize the 
algorithm for calculating the sum of fuzzy numbers in the 
Left-Right (L-R) form, and later on to transform the L-R 
form into the interval form [19]. Finally, by adopting the 
technique of ranking fuzzy numbers in compliance with [20], 
we hopefully can select the most consensual alternative or 
alternatives. 
 
We recall the information about fuzzy numbers expressed 
in the L-R form. We suppose that    and    are two fuzzy 
numbers in the L-R form, in which q, r = 0, …, g. We 
describe    (           )
  and    (           )   
in which     and     are called the mean values,    and     
are defined as the left spreads,    and     are known as right 
spreads, respectively. The union of    and    is calculated by 
 
      (                       )
   
(9) 
 
Being able to rank the fuzzy numbers obtained from (9), we 
need first transfer them into interval forms. 
We review the fuzzy number transformation from the L-
R form into interval form in [19]. Assume     
(              )
    is a fuzzy number in the L-R form. 
The interval form of      is given by 
 
    [    
           
 ]
    
(10) 
 
in which     is the mean value,      
 
           and 
    
 
           are defined as the left and the right 
border, respectively. The membership function associated 
with the fuzzy number     [    
           
 ]
    can be 
given by the following s-functions [16]-[18]:

Ranking 
fuzzy 
numbers 
in 
a 
decision-making 
environment is a very important and complex procedure. So 
far, the approaches to ranking fuzzy numbers have been 
proposed in [21]-[25]. Some of them are difficult to perform 
and others lead to different outcomes for a same problem. 
Therefore, a revised approach, based on [26] was explicated 
by Wang and Lee in [20]. In [20], the authors argued that 
“multipying the value on the horizontal axis with the value 
on the vertical axis often degrades the importance of the 
value on horizontal axis in ranking fuzzy numbers.” Instead, 
Wang and Lee proposed a technique to overcome the 
shortcomings. The revised method is given by the following 
criteria: 
 
If  ̅(   )   ̅ (   ), then        . 
 
If  ̅(   )   ̅ (   ), then        . 
 
If  ̅(   )   ̅ (   ), then        , thereby we 
check the following conditions: 
 
If  ̅(   )   ̅ (   ), then        . 
 
If  ̅(   )   ̅ (   ), then        . 
 
If  ̅(   )   ̅ (   ), then        ,

Here, ( ̅(   )  ̅   ( ) ) is the centroid point of the 
fuzzy number    ,     (    ( )) and      (    ( )) are 
called the left and the right membership functions of    , 
    (    ( ))
  
and      (    ( ))
  
are known as the 
inverse functions of     (    ( )) and      (    ( )), 
respectively. 
 
III. 
 PRACTICAL STUDIES 
In this section, we want to present two practical studies 
in medical group decision-making task. The physicians from 
a MDT group (urologists and medical oncologists) are 
independently asked for providing the opinions on some 
treatment schemes for two separate prostate cancer patients. 
The methods of probabilistic model, the 2-tuple linguistic 
model are considered for the first prostate cancer patient and 
the approach of hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets is applied 
to the second patient.  
A. The Probabilistic Model 
Let us suppose that   {           }  denotes a 
collection consisting of four physicians. And another set 
  {                 } contains sex types of treatment 
schemes for a prostate cancer patient, where   = “wait and 
see”,   = “active monitoring”,   = “symptom based 
treatment”,    = “brachytherapy”,    = “external beam 
radiation therapy” and   = “radical prostatectomy”. Also, 
  {                     } includes seven linguistic terms, 
in which   = “contraindicated”,   = “doubtful”,   = 
“acceptable”,   = “possible”,    = “suitable”,   = 
“recommended” and   = “strongly recommended”.  
 
By inserting       ,          and l = 0 in (1), we 
obtain the function for     “contraindicated” expanded by 
 
   ( ) 
 
{

 (       
     )
 
   
               
 
 
(16) 
 
 
By following the same procedure for l =1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 
6 we generate membership functions

We sample all functions (16)–(22) in a family of fuzzy

By using the probabilistic model, we collect all the

preference value of each judgment is given in Table VIII.

For other ai, i = 2,3,4,5,6, V(ai) are calculated in the 
similar way as 
 
 (  )              , 
 (  )             , 
 (  )                   , 
 (  )                       ,  
and 
 (  )                     . 
 
The collection of choice values for each            is 
aggregated in Table IX. We choose the optimal therapy 
alternative by means of (4) as 
 
                { (  )}     {                  } 
       (  )  
 
The value of 5 indicates the choice value of    to be 
maximal. This means that the second therapy alternative is 
the most efficacious. 
We want to confirm the result by applying the model of 
2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representations. 
B. The Model of 2-tuple Linguistic Representation 
According to the algorithm for the model of 2-tuple 
representation, the judgment that is transformed into 2-
tuples is given in Table X.

We calculate the arithmetic mean for the first alternative 
   by means of (5). 
    {(   ) (   ) (   ) (   )} is a finite set consisting 
of four 2-tuple linguistic representations for the alternative 
  . By adopting (5), the arithmetic mean value for    is 
calculated as: 
 ̅  
    ( 
 (       ))    ( )  (    )  
 
For the second alternative the arithmetic means value is 
given as follows: 
 ̅  
    ( 
 (       ))    (   )  (      )  
 
By the same reasoning, when setting i = 3,4,5,6 in (5), 
we implement 
 ̅  
    (
 
 (       ))    ( )  (    ), 
 ̅  
    ( 
 (       ))    (   )  (      )  
 ̅  
    ( 
 (       ))    (    )  (        )  
and 
 ̅  
    ( 
 (       ))    (   )  (      )  
The collection of the arithmetic mean values for all 
alternatives is presented in Table XI.

According to the computational technique presented 
earlier, we compare the above 2-tuples that represent the 
arithmetic values for all the alternatives. We obtain the 
result presented as                  , which 
shows that alternative    is the most efficacious treatment 
scheme for this particular patient. This result converges to 
the previous result from “the probabilistic model”. 
 
C. The Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Sets 
In this medical application, another prostate cancer 
patient is considered. We have five health professionals 
constitute the expert group   {              } . The set 
  {                    } contains seven types of 
treatment schemes alternatives, in which   = “active 
expectance”,   = “active monitoring”,   = “symptom based 
treatment”,    = “brachytherapy”,    = “external beam 
radiation therapy”,    = “adjuvant hormonal therapy” and 
  = “radical prostatectomy”. 
Furthermore, 
a 
linguistic 
term 
set 
  {                  } includes six linguistic terms, in 
which   = “contraindicated” = “C”,   = “acceptable” = “A”, 
  = “possible”= “P”,    = “suitable” = “S”,   = 
“recommended” = “R”, and   = “strongly recommended” = 
“SR”. Each linguistic term is associated with a fuzzy 
number restricted by general s-parametric function [16]-[18] 
given by (1). By choosing l = 0, …, 5, we obtain a family of 
six membership functions that map the effectiveness of the 
treatment therapies. Functions    are presented in Figure 3.

single words, the experts express the preferences of the 
treatment 
therapies 
in 
a 
broader 
spectrum. 
These 
assessments are aggregated in Table XII.

The assessment “[A, P]” denotes a comparative term, 
which indicates the terms     between “acceptable” and 
“possible”. It is also a hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set 
  
  = {     } in which {     } ⊂ S.  “  S ” can be 
interpreted as “greater than suitable”, which symbolizes 
another 
hesitant 
fuzzy 
linguistic 
term 
set 
  
  = 
{           }. Furthermore, “  A ” means “less than 
acceptable”, which assigns   
  = {     }. 
In order to obtain the assessments as comprehensive as 
possible and prevent the information loss, for individual 
alternative, we perform the operation of union on fuzzy sets 
to aggregate all possible preferences in one set. Therefore, 
 
    {   }  {      }  { }  {   }  {     }  
  {            }  {                 },

   ={   }  {     }  {   }  {     }  {         }  
{              }. 
 
We recall the union of two fuzzy numbers which can be 
performed by (9). Thereby, the effectiveness of    and    
can be calculated as 
 
   (  )

the centroid point of each fuzzy number    . If there exists 
identical horizontal coordinates, then (15) will be used to

Since no identical horizontal coordinates are found, we 
do not need to compute the values of the vertical 
coordinates. By means of the criteria introduced in [35] we 
obtain the following results: 3 > 2.5913 > 2 > 1.4, i.e. 
 ̅(   )   ̅(   ) >  ̅(   )   ̅(   ) > ̅(   )   ̅(   ) 
>  ̅(   ). The first    = “active expectance” and the fifth 
alternative    = “external beam radiation therapy” have the 
most optimal effectiveness found for the second patient 
according to our computation. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
According to the physicians’ requirements, we seek the 
arrangements of the effectiveness of treatment alternatives 
from the most recommended to the contraindicated for two 
separate prostate cancer patients. 
Three approaches, such as the probabilistic model, the 
model of 2-tuple linguistic representations and the hesitant 
fuzzy linguistic term sets have been applied to two multi-
expert decision-making cases. The convergence results from 
the first two approaches verify the high reliability of 
adopting the linguistic approach in solving group decision 
making problems. Moreover, the independent assumed 
preferences of each alternative make the computation of 
comparing the probabilities easy to be performed. 
Especially, the use of the 2-tuple linguistic representation 
model prevents the loss of information and makes the result 
more precise. The use of s-parametric membership functions 
not only increases the accuracy rate of the comparative 
analysis, but also facilitates the transformation process from 
the linguistic preferences to the numerical values. In the 
approach of hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set, the horizontal 
coordinates of the centroid point of fuzzy numbers are 
adopted for ranking the fuzzy numbers in a decision-making 
environment. The calculating process has its complexity but 
the technique is reliable. 
V. 
DISCUSSION 
We found all three methods very interesting in decision-
making process when panelists were not unanimous. The 
results seem to be reasonable from the clinical point of 
view. The process of sampling the data by filling the 
questionnaires was easy and quickly accomplished, 
especially in the probabilistic model and the model of 2-
tuple 
linguistic 
representations. 
However, 
we 
do 
encountered some issues in filling questionnaires for the 
hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets, mostly because it is not 
as intuitive as the two aforementioned methods. The filling 
of hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets questionnaire needs a 
2-3 minutes preparation, just to maintain the homogenicity 
of the answers. The authors have a feeling that the hesitant 
fuzzy linguistic term sets is a reliable method, but probably 
better to use in other conditions than in prostate cancer 
decisions making, mostly because of its logistical and 
practical problems. We hope to soon introduce one of the 
models in our clinical practice to assess the method in a real 
life conditions. Hopefully, this approach can allow us to find 
better treatment strategies and to give prostate cancer 
patients more flexibility concerning the treatment options. 
This should be a great complement to the current guidelines 
and scientific society recommendations.
