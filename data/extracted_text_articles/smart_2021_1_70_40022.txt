Abstract—The development of smart cities has been 
boosted in recent years. This means improvements for urban 
agriculture. In this paper, we present a low-cost system for 
monitoring conductivity in the irrigation system of urban 
agricultural plots. For this purpose, an inductive, two-coil 
sensor has been developed, where one is located inside the 
other. For the experiment, we have used three prototypes with 
40 spires for the fed part and 80 spires for the induced part, 
but with different pipe diameters. P1 has 20mm, P2 25 mm, 
and P3 32 mm. The sensors were calibrated using salt between 
0 g/L and 20 g/L concentrations. We use concentration of 0 
g/L, 2.5 g/L, 5 g/L, 10 g/L, 15 g/L and 20 g/L with conductivity 
of 0.485mS/cm, 5.53 mS/cm, 10.43 mS/cm, 20.4 mS/cm, 31.3 
mS/cm, and 41.6 mS/cm. The voltage difference between the 
minimum and maximum concentrations in each prototype is 
1.71 V for P1, 1.41 V for P2, and 0.99 V for P3. Subsequently, 
the verification of each prototype was performed, measuring 
concentrations of 7.5 g/L, 12.5 g/L, and 17 g/L, obtaining the 
lowest relative errors for P1 and P3 with 0.34% and 0.31% 
respectively.

I. INTRODUCTION  
For the first time, more than half of the population lives 
in cities. Villages or small towns are being depopulated and 
more are living in cities. Due to the rural exodus, food 
production is becoming complicated and expensive. This 
situation is most relevant in developing countries, where 
people with limited economic resources have difficulty 
accessing basic foodstuffs [1]. 
In this situation, the smart cities (SM) concept has begun 
to take on great relevance [2]. SM integrates new 
technologies with traditional infrastructures. This synergy 
improves the operational and management functions of the 
city, increases control, and optimizes the resources of the 
city itself. In this context, Urban Agriculture (UA) starts to 
gain relevance [3]. This type of practice is carried out on 
relatively small plots of land and is used for the self-
sufficiency of certain groups within cities. This type of 
agriculture reduces the carbon footprint by reducing the 
transport of the products obtained from the fields to the 
cities. Conversely, due to water resource management, 
many urban farmers use untreated municipal wastewater as 
irrigation water [4]. This can cause crop damage.  
At present, the most widely used methods for 
controlling the quality of irrigation water are sampling and 
subsequent laboratory analysis. This process has several 
disadvantages, such as the need to have a person to take the 
sample, the need to have a laboratory and the waiting time 
for the analysis to be carried out, making it an inefficient 
process. One of the most relevant parameters for detecting 
changes in water quality is conductivity [5]. Conductivity is 
considered an indicator of water quality, because it displays 
the purity of the water or whether it contains dissolved 
chemicals or minerals. In this context, a high load of 
dissolved substances would show a high conductivity, 
which is harmful to the crop. Furthermore, in recent years, 
alternatives have emerged to monitor the quality of 
irrigation water. These methods are expensive or do not 
allow continuous monitoring in different parts of the 
irrigation pipes, being systems that are difficult to apply in 
environments such as urban plots. 
In this paper, we propose the development of a low-cost 
system for conductivity monitoring of irrigation water used 
for urban agriculture. The sensor used in this system is 
based on the same principle as previously developed sensors 
[6], based on the generation of electromagnetic fields, 
which interact with the medium causing changes in it. The 
current prototype is considered progress as the design used 
adapts more optimally to irrigation pipes, where previous 
developments could not. The prototype developed has a 
central coil and a shallow coil around the pipe, causing 
minimal obstruction to the internal flow of water in the pipe. 
The rest of the paper is structured as: Related works are 
presented in Section II. Then, the Test Bench is presented in 
Section III. Section IV shows the proposal performed. Then, 
the results are shown in Section V. Finally, the conclusion 
is presented in Section VI. 
II. RELATED WORK 
In this section, we show the different works carried out, 
and explain the advantages of our system compared to 
others. 
N. A. Cloete et al. [7] proposed the design and 
development of a water quality monitoring system. The 
objective of this system is to notify the user of the real-time 
water quality parameters. This system is able to measure 
flow, temperature, pH, conductivity, and oxidation-
reduction potential. They use ZigBee receiver and 
transmitter modules for communication. The proposed 
system is capable of reading physiochemical parameters, 
and can successfully process, transmit, and display the 
readings. Then, N. Vijayakumar [8], present a design and 
development of a low-cost system for real-time monitoring 
of the water quality in IoT (internet of things). This system 
measures different parameters like temperature, PH, 
turbidity, conductivity, dissolved oxygen. Moreover, they 
proposed the use of  PI B+ model as the core controller. In 
the same context, F. Anthony et al [9] developed Water 
Sensor Network (WSN) system prototype developed for 
water quality monitoring in Victoria Basin (LVB). This 
system uses an Arduino microcontroller, water quality

sensors, and a wireless network connection module. The 
parameters that are able to measure are temperature, 
dissolved oxygen, pH, and electrical conductivity in real-
time and disseminates the information in graphical and 
tabular formats to relevant stakeholders through a web-
based portal and mobile phone platforms. 
W. Gong et al. [10] proposed a conductivity sensor 
based on two flat electrodes built on a PBC board. For the 
measurements, they use KCI and water MQ. The sensor is 
suitable for marine environments. This sensor works at 
334kHz obtaining significant variations in a wide range of 
salinity. Then, J. Zang et al [11] proposed a new four-
electrode smart sensor for water conductivity measurements 
of aquaculture monitoring. This sensor has high precision 
with good stability. This system includes a temperature 
sensor to compensate for the water conductivity temperature 
dependence. The developed conductivity is appropriate for 
measuring conductivities between the range of 0-50 mS/cm, 
0-40ºC. 
Besides, J. Rocher et al [12] proposed a system for 
detecting illegal dumping. The proposed system is based on 
a conductivity sensor. This sensor is composed of two coils. 
One of the coils is powered by a sinus-wave and the other 
coil is induced. They experiment in a laboratory where the 
selected prototype has an  4.10 Volts between the samples 0 
and 40 g/l of the table salt. Then D.A. Basterrechea et al [13] 
presents a test of three prototypes with different 
characteristics for controlling the quantity of organic 
fertiliser in the agricultural irrigation system. They perform 
the test using six samples between the 0 g/L and 20 g/L of 
organic fertiliser and measure their conductivity. They 
obtained that in prototype 1 (P1) (coil with 8 layers) the 
working frequency is around 100 kHz, in P2 (coil with 4 
layers) around 110 kHz, and for P3 (coil with 2 layers) 
around 140 kHz. Finally, the results displayed that 
prototype three with configuration 1 is the best device to be 
used as a fertiliser sensor in water. 
Currently, the coil designs produced are not adaptable to 
irrigation pipes, as these have been designed for wider 
spaces. Therefore, the new generation of coils developed is 
suitable for use in different pipe diameters. 
III. TEST BENCH 
In this section, we present the prototypes that have been 
used and the experiments that have been carried out with 
each group of sensors. In addition, the test bench is made up 
of two subsections. 
A. Prototype characterization 
For this experiment, we have created different 
prototypes for the agricultural irrigation system. These new 
prototypes, unlike the previous ones, can be installed in the 
irrigation pipes with the minimum possible interruption in 
the water flow. Moreover, they can be adapted to different 
pipe diameters. In addition, PVC of different diameters for 
the fed coil, such as 20 mm for P1, 25 mm for P2, and 32 
mm for P3, has been used for the construction of these new 
prototypes. The length of the sensors used is 7.5 cm, with a 
thickness of 2 mm. The induced coil is placed inside the 
PVC pipe. For this second coil, a polyethylene (PE) pen 
sleeve filled with silicone has been used to create a solid 
core, which measures 5.3 cm. The diameter of the second 
reel is also 7mm. A ratio of 40 coils for the power supply 
(PC) on the external side and 80 coils for the induction coil 
(IC) on the internal side has been used. 
The three prototypes developed are shown in Figure 1 
where they are compared with prototype designs from 
previous research. The current prototype has a coil on the 
external side of the pipe. In comparison to the previous ones, 
these are suitable to be placed in the pipes directly. 
B. Performance of the experiment 
In order to perform our experiments, the following 
parameters have been selected (see Table I).

For the experiment, we started by placing two PVC 
elbows on each pipe to simulate real pipe conditions. In 
addition, we added a specific volume to each sensor. These 
added volumes are the ones required to cover the pipe 
completely. Furthermore, for P1 we used 105 mL of, 60 mL 
for P2, and 30 mL in P3. Once the pipe was filled, each 
prototype was connected one by one to the generator and 
oscilloscope. In this case, the supplied coil was connected 
to the AFG1022 generator [14] with a 3.3 V peak-to-peak 
supply generating a sinusoidal signal. Besides, the induced 
coil was connected to the TBS1104 oscilloscope. 
Following the connection of the sensor, we perform a 
frequency scan to determine the frequency where the 
magnetic field generated by the sensor is most sensitive to 
the medium. This frequency is considered the working 
frequency. Once the working frequency has been obtained, 
we begin to take data. To do this, values are taken using 6 
solutions of different 
NaCl concentrations. These 
concentrations are 0 g/L, 2.5 g/L, 5 g/L, 10 g/L, 15 g/L and 
20 g/L. The conductivity is measured with a Basic-30. The 
conductivity values obtained are 0.485mS/cm, 5.53 mS/cm, 
10.43 mS/cm, 20.4 mS/cm, 31.3 mS/cm, and 41.6 mS/cm.  
Triplicate values are taken and then averaged. The most 
stable value displayed by the oscilloscope is chosen for 
measurement. After taking the measurements, the 
calibration curve is made to determine the correlation of the 
values obtained with the salt concentration. Finally, 
verification was carried out using solutions of 7.5 g/L, 12.5 
g/L, and 17 g/L, which were measured obtaining a 
conductivity of 15.45 mS/cm, 26.3 mS/cm, and 36.8 
mS/cm. 
IV. PROPOSAL 
This section presents the design and test of the power 
circuit to generate the sinusoidal signal to power the water 
presence sensor. 
A. ICM7555 circuit. 
In order to power the different prototypes of the coil, it 
is required a power supply and excitation circuit to generate 
an alternating current similar to sinusoidal signals. To do 
this, a 555 series oscillator integrated circuit can be used. 
This circuit is configurable by using different values of 
resistors and capacitors. Figure 2 shows the schematic of the 
555 modules in astable mode and the recommended 
equations for calculating the generated frequency.

sensor (Right side). 
 
For configuring a duty cycle of 50%, it is recommended 
to use the values of RA = 1 kΩ and RB = 10 kΩ. As we will 
see in the next section, the three prototypes we use present 
a working frequency between 460 kHz and 470 kHz. So, the 
value of C should also be determined. Using the 
recommended equations, we have calculated the theoretical 
value of C to obtain those frequencies. However, checking 
the actual functioning of this circuit, some differences are 
observed (see Table II). These differences can be due to the 
tolerances of all components.

B. Design of power circuit 
The power circuit is in charge of powering the primary 
coil. As we mentioned before, it is based on the ICM7555 
in the astable configuration. The output voltage provided by 
this circuit is too low for the power of the primary coil, so, 
we included an NPN transistor. This component is in charge 
of allowing the circulating of current to the primary coil 
located in parallel with a resistor. The resistor placed on the 
collector of the NPN transistor is used to limit the current 
that drives through it. A diode in a flyback configuration 
prevents that a continuous current circulates in the coil 
causing the coil to become in a short-cut. The transistor will 
invert the sense of current through the resistor and the coil 
will begin to discharge until a new cycle. All these 
components compose the amplifier phase. In this part of the 
circuit, there is no AC signal. However, there is a change in 
the current sense, so a current is induced on the secondary 
coil that will help us to detect the presence of water in the 
pipe. Finally, it is included a Double wave rectifier bridge 
followed by an RC filter. Those elements are used to obtain 
a DC valued proportionally to the presence of water in the 
pipe. The circuit implemented is shown in Figure 3. 
V. RESULTS 
This section represents the results of the different 
prototypes developed and the comparison of these with 
prototypes made in other studies. 
A. Old prototypes 
Figure 4 shows the results obtained with the previous 
prototypes when applying them outside the pipe. The values 
obtained are homogeneous in 9.28 V at its working 
frequency of 210 kHz. The calibration curve reflects the fact 
that there is no difference between the different 
concentrations of salt solutions used.  
B. Current prototypes 
Figure 5 shows the frequency sweep carried out for the 
3 different prototypes developed. It can be seen that the 
sweep frequencies performed are in a similar range for P1, 
P2, and P3, since the same proportion of spires has been 
used in both the PC and IC parts. The results obtained show 
that the frequencies where the voltage is higher are 480 kHz 
for P1 and 490 kHz for P2 and P3. 
Once the frequency sweep has been carried out, 
measurements are taken at each of the frequencies 
previously displayed for different concentrations of salinity. 
These concentrations are in the range of 0 g/L and 20 g/L. 
The results obtained provide the WF of each prototype 
which is detailed in Table III. The WF of prototypes 1 and 
2 is 470 kHz and of the P3 460 kHz. In addition, the highest 
voltage change is found at P1 with 1.71 V.

concentrations.

The calibration of each prototype for these frequencies 
was carried out once the WF was obtained, using 6 different 
concentrations from 0 g/L to 20 g/L every 2.5 g/L. Figure 6  
represents the calibration lines for P1, P2 and P3. This 
represents a minimum voltage of 4.92 V and a maximum 
voltage of 6.63 V for P1. The change presented is about 1.71 
V. The maximum changes between the measured points are 
located in the first 3 points, then the values stabilise. The 
highest variation is presented between the concentration of 
0 g/L and 2.5 mg/L with 0.56 V. 
 
Figure 6. Calibration model of P1, P2 and P3. 
Similarly, P2 shows a minimum and maximum voltage 
of 6.32 V and 7.73 V, with a voltage change of 1.41 V. The 
maximum changes between the measured points are located 
in the first 3 points, then the values stabilise. The highest 
variation is 0.42 V, presented between concentrations of 0 
g/L and 2.5 mg/L. 
Finally, the calibration model of P3 presented the values for 
the lowest concentration of 5.3 V and for the highest 
concentration of 6.29 V. The maximum change between 
these two concentrations is 0.99 V. The highest variation is 
presented between the concentration of 0 g/L and 2.5 mg/L 
with 0.24 V.  
The calibration curves obtained for each of the 
prototypes offer a determination coefficient (R2) whose 
main purpose is to predict future results or test a hypothesis. 
In this context, the highest R2 is found in P1 with a value of 
0.9848. Then we find P2 with 0.9834 and P3 with 0.9367. 
The equations of each prototype are given by (1)-(3). In 
addition, the three prototypes present a logarithmic 
adjustment of the obtained values.

C. Verification 
Finally, a verification of the developed prototypes was 
carried out. For this purpose, 3 salt solutions of 7.5 g/L, 12.5 
g/L, and 17.5 g/L were used. Table II shows the results 
obtained for each of the prototypes. The errors presented in 
the table have been obtained on an absolute value basis. 
Furthermore, the results show that P3 and P2 have the 
lowest errors, with an Absolute Error (AE) of 0.01 V and

0.02 V, and a Relative Error (RE) of 0.31 % and 0.34 % 
respectively. On the other hand, P2 is the one that displays 
the highest error with 0.13 V of AE and 1.79 % for ER.

In this context, we discarded P2 due to its high error 
compared to the others. Similarly, although P3 shows a 
lower error than P1, the last one is chosen as the best option 
for water monitoring in the irrigation system of urban 
agriculture. This is because P1 displays higher voltage 
differences between the minimum and maximum salt 
concentration, being 1.71 V for it versus 0.99 V for P3. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
Water quality monitoring in urban agriculture is of great 
importance to improve and optimise production from these 
gardens. In addition, conductivity can be classified as one 
of the most important parameters for detecting changes in 
the quality of the irrigation water used. 
In this paper, we proposed a new generation low-cost 
system for monitoring the irrigation of urban crops. The 
presented sensor is optimally adapted to the irrigation pipes 
with minor influence on the water flow. We have 
determined the working frequency of the different 
prototypes with common salt (NaCl). The results indicate an 
optimal behaviour of the 3 prototypes, being the P1 the best 
option. This last prototype has the highest voltage difference 
between the minimum and maximum concentrations. In 
addition, the relative error is one of the smallest values of 
the test. 
In future work, we want to improve the sensitivity of our 
sensor and different salts, suspended solids and pre-treated 
waster waters. Since it is possible to have pipes of not only 
PVC but also concrete and metals alloys, we would also test 
our system in those type of pipes and investigate the 
possibility of integrating them in the manufacturing of 
concrete coils. Finally, we will test the developed sensor in 
a real environment, taking measurements in a dynamic 
system.
