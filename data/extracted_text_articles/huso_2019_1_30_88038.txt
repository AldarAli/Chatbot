Abstract—The ﬁrst step in training a system for automatic
emotion detection consists of manual data annotation. Because
there is no consensus on a standard emotion framework, we
established a label set which is justiﬁed both theoretically and
practically. Frequency and cluster analysis of 229 tweet anno-
tations resulted in a label set containing the 5 emotions Love,
Joy, Anger, Nervousness and Sadness. Our label set shows fair
resemblance to Ekman’s basic emotions, but due to our data-
driven approach, our label set is much more grounded in the
task (emotion detection) and the domain (Dutch tweets).

INTRODUCTION
Emotions play a central role in how we perceive the world
and how we communicate with it, making them a prominent
object of study in many research ﬁelds, including psychol-
ogy [1], linguistics [2], and neurobiology [3]. In Natural
Language Processing (NLP), emotion analysis has attracted
interest the last decades because of its myriad of applications,
including market analysis and customer satisfaction for busi-
ness intelligence [4], educational and pedagogical applications
[5], analysing political tweets and public sentiment [6], crisis
communication [7], and mental health applications [8].
Our overall objective is to create an automatic emotion
detection system for Dutch. As emotion detection has mainly
been studied for English data [9], [10], [11], but only to a lim-
ited extent for some other languages, our ﬁrst step will consist
in manually labeling Dutch textual data with emotions follow-
ing a certain framework. Notwithstanding the long history of
theoretical emotion research in psychology and its recent surge
in NLP, there is currently no consensus on a standard emotion
framework. Categorical models, mostly offering a set of basic
emotions, and dimensional representations (see Section II)
coexist, and even within those models, different sets of basic
emotions and dimensions can be found. This wide spectrum of
frameworks impedes the exchange of data and knowledge re-
sources (e.g., annotated datasets and emotion lexicons), which
are crucial to train supervised machine learning approaches for
emotion detection, and makes it difﬁcult to compare different
NLP systems handling emotions. Moreover, the motives on
which a particular emotion framework is selected in studies
on automatic emotion detection are often unclear, and the
frameworks seem to be chosen rather arbitrary.
In this paper, we wish to establish an emotion framework
which is justiﬁed both theoretically and practically to perform
automatic emotion detection on Dutch tweets. To this end,
we start from theories about emotion in psychology (more
speciﬁcally, the work of Shaver et al. [12]), but, contrary to
research in the psychological tradition, we work with real-life
data instead of words in isolation. This real-life data comes
from the same distribution as the data on which we will
perform the ultimate task of emotion detection. This ensures
that our framework is empirically grounded, which would
not be the case if we arbitrary adopted a framework from
psychological emotion theory.
To this purpose, we collected a large dataset of Dutch
tweets comprising at least one emoji, and we annotated 300
tweets by labeling all possible emotion categories as conveyed
by the author of the tweet. First, we performed an Inter-
Annotator Agreement (IAA) study by having a small subset
of the data (50 tweets) annotated by three different annota-
tors, and we found that for most categories a moderate to
substantial agreement could be observed. Subsequently, the
remaining 250 tweets were annotated and a cluster analysis
was performed. This leads to a reduced, empirically grounded
emotion framework consisting of the 5 emotions Love, Joy,
Anger, Nervousness and Sadness.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in
Section II, we describe the related work. Section III presents
the data collection, IAA study, annotations and explains the
clustering technique that was used. In Section IV, we present
the results and Section V concludes this paper.

RELATED WORK
In emotion theory, two main approaches for emotional
representation coexist, namely, (i) representation based on a
categorical model and (ii) based on a dimensional model.
In the dimensional approach, emotions are seen as a vector
in a multidimensional space, e.g., with the two dimensions
Valence (from Displeasure to Pleasure) and Arousal (from
Calmness to Excitement) [13], the three-dimensional Valence-
Arousal-Dominance model [14] or even a four-dimensional
model which also takes Unpredictability into account [15].
Categorical representation models, however, involve cog-
nitive labeling of emotions, typically using a set of basic
emotions, with the theories of Ekman [16] and Plutchik [17]
being the most inﬂuential ones. Ekman reports that Joy,
Surprise, Anger, Fear, Disgust and Sadness are the six most
basic emotions and that these can be linked to universal facial
expressions. Plutchik added Trust and Anticipation to Ekman’s
set, resulting in a set of eight emotions. Basic emotion frame-
works have been provided by many other theorists, ranging
from 2 to 14 emotions. Table I gives an overview of different
basic emotion frameworks. This list is adapted from [18].
More extensive frameworks exist, but then the categories
are not mere basic emotions. Often, they contain secondary
emotions, which are more complex categories and can be seen

as combinations of basic emotions. The extended version of
Plutchik’s [17] emotion model, for example, counts thirty-two
emotions, of which only eight are basic and the other twenty-
four are secondary emotions (e.g., the secondary emotion
Optimism is deﬁned as the combination of the basic emotions
Optimism and Joy). Also Russel [13] provides a list of some
emotion terms, but these are rather stimuli or examples to
illustrate the representation model and not basic emotions.
Worth mentioning is also the emotion taxonomy proposed by
Shaver et al. [12]. This taxonomy was obtained by means of a
similarity-sorting task of 135 terms that were experimentally
shown to be prototypical emotion words: 213 emotion words
were rated by 112 psychology students for prototypicality,
resulting in 135 prototypical emotion words. Then, 100 stu-
dents grouped those emotion words into categories (without
a predeﬁned number of categories), which resulted in 100
135x135 co-occurrence matrices that were combined and used
as input for the cluster analysis. This resulted in 25 categories,
which were subsequently classiﬁed under six basic categories:
Love, Joy, Surprise, Anger, Sadness and Fear. Table II presents
an overview of these extensive emotion lists.
Regarding frameworks used in NLP, categorical frame-
works are dominant, and both Ekman’s and Plutchik’s set of
basic emotions are popular (see Table III for an overview of
the most used English emotion datasets that use a categorical
label set). Sometimes, another framework is chosen speciﬁcally
based on the task/domain (e.g., [8] employ a set of 15 emotions
to investigate signs of suicidal behavior). However, more often
the motives on which a particular emotion framework is
selected are unclear. [33] expressed the need of a standardized
model for emotion detection tasks, resulting in the creation
of the Emotion Annotation and Representation Language
(EARL). Although this framework originates from the ﬁeld
of Affective Computing, its construction was not data-driven
nor experimentally grounded. Moreover, we are not aware of
any studies in NLP that make use of this framework.

METHOD
In order to establish a framework for emotion detection
that is justiﬁed both theoretically and practically, we collect a
corpus of real-life data which we annotate with an initial ex-
tensive emotion label set. Then, we perform a cluster analysis
to reveal which categories to merge into one category, resulting
in a smaller, empirically grounded label set.
A. Initial Labels
The initial label set needs to be sufﬁciently large to cap-
ture enough nuances between emotion categories. Most basic
emotion sets are rather brief (the most popular ones, [16] and
[17], contain only six and eight categories, respectively) and do
not capture nuances like Frustration and Envy, which usually
are subsumed under the Anger category. However, we think
that such differentiations can be useful in certain domains.
Moreover, much of the frameworks have a skewed distribution
regarding sentiment polarity, with signiﬁcantly more negative
than positive emotions: for example, [22] has only two out
of ten emotions that are unambiguously positive. In Ekman’s
set, only Joy is clearly positive, Anger, Disgust and Fear are
negative, and Surprise can be either negative or positive.
Some frameworks also provide secondary emotions (e.g.,
[17]), which of course results in a larger emotion set. However,

using such a set of secondary emotions as input for cluster
analysis to again obtain a smaller set of categories, seems like
a circular approach and is therefore not an option.
Taking this into account, we chose the emotion taxonomy
of [12] as a starting point (see Table II). The main advantage of
using these 25 emotion words is that the label set is not biased:
although one could argue that these are secondary emotion
words, they are not deducted from basic emotion categories (on
the contrary, it is the other way around). This is a big difference
with a framework like Plutchik’s [17], where a secondary
emotion word is seen as a combination of two or more basic
emotion words. Moreover, this label set is independent, and
not chosen to ﬁt a certain model (unlike for example [13],
where the emotion words are not prototypical, but seem to be
chosen to ﬁt the pleasure-arousal circumplex model).
Although the set of 25 emotions was already further
clustered into a ﬁnal set of six basic emotions in the original
work of [12], our cluster analysis is no repetition of this
approach. While the clustering of [12] was based on the
results of a similarity-sorting task of 135 words, our analysis
is performed on annotations of real-life data. As this data is
similar to the data on which we eventually want to perform
emotion detection, our approach ensures that our label set is
more grounded in the task of emotion detection and on the
domain we are interested in, instead of merely adapted from
the psychology ﬁeld.
B. Data
We wanted to obtain a collection of Dutch tweets that could
be considered high in emotions. To increase the chance of
scraping emotional tweets, we used a list of 72 emoji’s (see
Figure 1) as queries in the database for Dutch tweets Twiqs.nl
[42]. We downloaded all tweets that the database returned
from the year 2017 and took a random subset of 300 tweets.
Before distributing the tweets over the annotators, we removed
all duplicates and non-Dutch tweets and replaced them with
another random tweet from our overall collection.
The tweets were annotated in a multi-label setup: for each
of the 25 emotion words, the annotator needed to indicate
whether the emotion is expressed (explicitly or implicitly) or
not. Because we are interested in the emotional state of the
author while writing the tweet, the annotator was asked to
project oneself into the perspective of the tweet’s author.
The annotation team consisted of three experienced lin-
guists. In a ﬁrst round, all three annotators labeled the same
50 tweets according to predeﬁned guidelines. We determined
inter-annotator agreement by calculating Cohen’s Kappa [43]
between each annotator pair and taking the mean of those
two scores. IAA varied largely across emotion categories (see
Table IV). For most categories, a moderate (0.4 < κ < 0.6)
to substantial (0.6 < κ < 0.8) agreement can be observed.
When leaving the emotions out of consideration for which at
least one annotator never indicated it as present (6 categories),
the mean Kappa score is 0.498 (moderate agreement). Mean
Kappa score between Annotator 1 and 2 was 0.425; 0.465
between Annotator 2 and 3; and 0.533 between 1 and 3.

In the second annotation round, the remaining 250 tweets
were distributed among the three annotators. These annotated
tweets were merged with Annotator 3’s annotations of the
tweets of the ﬁrst round (because she had the highest agree-
ment with both of the other annotators). Tweets for which
not a single emotion was indicated as present (and thus were
judged as objective), were left aside for further analysis. Our
ﬁnal dataset consists of 229 emotional tweets.
C. Clustering
We regarded the annotations as vectors per emotion cate-
gory, resulting in 25 229-dimensional vectors. We construct a
25x25 distance matrix by measuring the Dice dissimilarity [44]
between each emotion vector pair. Dice is a common metric
for assessing the (dis)similarity between boolean vectors, and
contrary to the similar Jaccard metric, it gives a higher weight
to double positives:
d(A, B) = 1 −
2DP
2DP +PA+PB
with DP the number of double positives (value of 1 in both
emotion vector A and B), PA the number of positives (1-
values) in emotion vector A and PB the number of positives in
emotion vector B. Double negatives (value of 0 in both vectors)
are not counted. This implies that vector pairs differing only in
one value not always get the same distance score: the distance
will decrease as more instances have a value of 1 in both
vectors. Emotion pairs that were more frequently annotated as
present will have a relatively smaller distance.
The resulting distance matrix was then used as input
for a hierarchical cluster analysis. We tried seven different
linkage methods: single (Nearest Point Algorithm), complete
(Farthest Point Algorithm), average (UPGMA Algorithm),
weighted (WPGMA), centroid (UPGMC), median (WPGMC)
and Ward’s linkage (Incremental Algorithm).

RESULTS
A. Frequency Analysis
Figure 2 shows that the top 3 most frequent emotions are
all positive emotions (Contentment, Joy and Enthusiasm). The
negative emotions Irritation and Frustration complete the top
5. Eight emotions (of which six are negative) appear less than
10 times in the dataset: Suffering, Relief, Lust, Rejection, Envy,
Fear, Remorse and Torment. Interestingly, only three out of
six Ekman emotions appear in the top 10 of most frequent
emotions, namely Joy, Sadness and Anger. Fear, on the other
hand, is even the third least frequent emotion in this dataset.
This possibly indicates that popular basic emotion frameworks
like Ekman’s are not always the most suitable to apply in an
NLP task like emotion detection, let alone for data coming
from a speciﬁc domain or genre such as Twitter.

B. Cluster Analysis
Figure 3 shows the distance matrix based on the Dice
dissimilarity between each emotion vector pair. This already
gives some insight in which emotion categories are more
related to each other. Frustration and Irritation, for example,
are the most salient in terms of similarity, but also Contentment
and Joy or Enthusiasm and Joy show a small distance.
We used this distance matrix as input for a hierarchical
clustering algorithm. We tried seven different linkage methods,
for which the dendrograms are shown in Figure 4. We asked
the annotators to rank the dendrograms based on their own in-
tuition. Their top 3 consisted of the same clusters but the order
differed. After discussion, the weighted-linkage clustering was
chosen as the most intuitive one. This linkage method is also
known as the Weighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic
Mean (WPGMA Algorithm). At each step of the algorithm,
the two clusters that have the shortest distance between each
other are combined. The distance between clusters is calculated
by considering the distance between each pair of elements
in the clusters (with one element per cluster) and taking the
arithmetic mean of those distances.
Figure 5 plots the WPGMA dendrogram with a distance of
1.3 as cut-off value. This results in eight clusters (of which one
only consists of one separate emotion category: Remorse). Four
of these clusters are related to the basic emotions of Ekman
(Joy, Anger, Sadness and Fear).
However, as the frequency analysis pointed out, not all
emotion categories are equally represented in this dataset.
This is why we also performed a second clustering analysis
excluding those emotions that were indicated less than ten

times. This dendrogram is depicted in Figure 6. The threshold
of ten might seem a bit harsh, especially since this results in the
removal of the basic emotion Fear. However, based on Figure
5, we hypothesised that Fear would still be clustered together
with Nervousness and the effect of removing it would not be
problematic. We tested this and this was indeed the case. As
expected, the clusters of Figure 6 are very similar to the ones
in Figure 5, though only ﬁve clusters remain. Cluster 1 consists
of the emotions Enthrallment, Love, Longing and Optimism,
Cluster 2 comprises Pride, Enthusiasm, Contentment and Joy,
the emotions Disgust, Disappointment, Anger, Frustration and
Irritation form Cluster 3, Nervousness is a category on its own,
and Surprise, Pity and Sadness are grouped together under
Cluster 5.
The dendrogram nicely shows that the ﬁrst two and last
three categories form two distinct groups (positive versus neg-
ative emotions). Although we have a more equal distribution of
negative and positive emotion clusters, our ﬁnal clusters show
a fair resemblance to Ekman’s basic emotions.
To select an umbrella term per cluster, we take the Ekman
emotion if the cluster has a term in common with the Ekman
set. Otherwise, we select the emotion word with the highest
frequency. This results in a ﬁnal label set with Love, Joy,
Anger, Nervousness and Sadness as emotion categories.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We established an emotion framework which is justiﬁed
both theoretically and practically to perform automatic emotion
detection on Dutch tweets. Frequency and cluster analyses of
229 tweet annotations resulted in a label set containing the 5
emotions Love, Joy, Anger, Nervousness and Sadness. Unlike
many emotion frameworks directly borrowed from psychology,
this label set has a more equal distribution over positive and
negative emotions and due to our data-driven approach, it is
much more grounded in the task (emotion detection) and the
domain (Twitter). There is still a fair resemblance between
Ekman’s basic emotions and our labels, but we are the ﬁrst that
give an empirical motivation for the use of these categories.
For future work, we will use a similar approach to deﬁne

a label set for two other domains, namely subtitles of reality
TV and crisis communication data and verify whether these
label sets even deviate more from the popular basic emotion
frameworks. In this respect, mainly the crisis communication
data will be interesting due to its topic speciﬁcity (in contrast
to the more general character of tweets). Moreover, we will
include dimensional annotations and aggregate these into a
varied corpus to be used for Dutch emotion detection.
