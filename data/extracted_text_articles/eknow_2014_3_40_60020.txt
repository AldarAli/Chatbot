Abstract— Our work is
a part
of
the
manufacturing
monitoring systems, using the model of knowledge creation
for
the
realization
of
industrial
diagnosis
dependability
aspects. Knowledge
capital has an important
role
in
organizations, particularly in the industrial sector based
on
knowledge. The aim of this work consists in outsourcing
tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge at the thermal power
plant of Jijel city in Algeria. For our analysis, we used the
methodology
''CommonKADS''
of knowledge
acquisition,
which is standard
for
the development of knowledge-based
systems in Europe; but, the weak points are (i) the lack of an
implementation tool for
this
method,
(ii) weak modeling
language CML (Conceptual Modeling Language), because it
is a semi-formal language, and (iii) lack of inference (the role of
knowledge-based).
Therefore,
we
proposed
the
expert
system generator G2 as a computerized model of expertise
for this methodology; it is a highly efficient development
assistant
of knowledge-based systems.
This comes from the
fact that it contains a natural and formal language. It is
structured and allows the definition of all the elements of the
methodology CommonKADS, it offers possibilities more than
an inference engine. The studied thermal power plant is using
an online monitoring system; it makes the detection of signs
that show abnormalities using alarms. We have proposed a
knowledge-based system that follows the detection to diagnose
in real-time the process that ensures good continuity of
production and availability of inputs, and results in quality of
monitoring equipment and rapid diagnosis.
Saved expertise
should allow a better fit of interventions. Our contribution is in
the conduct and support the diagnosis of a production system.
The proposal is a tool for implementing CommonKADS, based
on improvement of its weaknesses.

I.
INTRODUCTION
The knowledge management is an important need,
whether a company is conscious or not. It should allow
locating and making visible the tacit knowledge of experts,
to be able to keep, access and update, and disseminate best
use of knowledge. Engineering knowledge is not simply a
means of extracting expert knowledge, but it includes
methods and techniques of knowledge acquisition, modeling,
representation and use [1]. We chose the CommonKADS
methodology [2] because it provides a framework for
modeling the knowledge level. The issue is that there is a
conflict between former expert without a degree and new
graduate recruited employee in our companies in Algeria.
Experts resolve problems rapidly using their know-how
acquired over the years of accumulated experience and, the
graduate employees aren’t reactive and make the time to
explore guides, plans, etc. The latter cannot take advantage
of experts because they do not have the same background.
To break these barriers, the company should externalize the
tacit knowledge hidden in the minds of experts; this is the
aim of our work.
In the next sections, a short review of
methods of knowledge management systems shows the
differences
between
them,
then,
a
description
of
CommonKADS method and its weaknesses are presented,
jointly with proposals. The ameliorated CommonKADS is
applied to thermal power plant to give best results of
externalization of tacit knowledge.
II.
METHODS OF DEVELOPMENT OF KNOWLEDGE
SYSTEMS
The pioneer in the methods of knowledge capitalization is
SKANDIA [13], introduced by the Swedish insurance
company SKANDIA. Its strategy is to focus on human
resources and their capacity to innovate and bring wealth to
a business. CYGMA is a method dedicated to profession
memory, in the framework of a design task, while REX and
MKSM are methods which do not focus on a kind of
corporate memory and do not restrict to a kind of task [12].
REX relies on the building of pieces of experience,
stemming
from
several
kinds
of
sources
(human,
documents, databases); such pieces can be retrieved in
answer to natural language request. MKSM [12] takes
inspiration form the complex system theory for offering a
theoretical analysis of organization knowledge, considered
as a complex system. The modeling phases proposed by
MKSM are close to CommonKADS notions. All three
methods were applied to several industrial applications.
Criteria for comparing them more precisely could be: (i) the
complexity level of the method application, (ii) the kind of
corporate memory it enables to build, (iii) the kind of task it
restricts to, (iv) the number and features of effective
applications built with them, and (v) evaluation of such
applications by their end-users.
III.
THE METHOD COMMONKADS
This methodology is one of the results of the ESPRIT
projects KADS-I and KADS-II [12]. It relies on the premise
that knowledge sharing is based on the communication of
knowledge
and
recreation.
Therefore,
knowledge
management means sharing knowledge among multiple

individuals. The primary objective of the method is to assist
in the knowledge modeling of an expert or group of experts
in order to make a decision support knowledge-based
system. CommonKADS uses more of the three categories
listed
above,
six
models
to
analyze
the
knowledge:
organization, task, agent, communication, knowledge and
design.
Figure 1. CommonKADS models.

Organization model: It supports the analysis of
major features of an organization, in order to
discover problems and opportunities for knowledge
systems.

Task model: It analyzes the global task layout, its
inputs and outputs, preconditions and performance
criteria,
as
well
as
needed
resources
and
competences.

Agent model: Agents are executors of tasks. An
agent can be human, an information system, etc.

Communication model: It models communicative
transaction between the agents involved in a task.

Knowledge model: Its purpose is to explain in
details the types and structures of the knowledge
used in performing a task.

Design model: The CommonKADS models together
constitute the knowledge system.
There are several works using CommonKADs method;
Recordel [9] found that CommonKADS provides a good
starting point for modeling multi-agent systems as they are
made
to
create
knowledge-based
systems.
Therefore,
extensions for CommonKADS [9] have been proposed for
modeling multi-agent systems, as CoMoMAS and MAS-
CommonKADS. The combination of CommonKADS with
System Dynamics [10] provide effectiveness in fostering
learning
and
transferring
knowledge
since
such
combination,
integrates
all
important
elements
of
an
organisation's strategy and operations. CommonKADS was
used by Zhang [11] to develop a learner model to give a
user advice based on his knowledge to help the teacher and
the learner in their tasks. In the next sections, we will
illustrate the use of CommonKADS to save expertise of
experts to share and to reuse it, to minimize professional
mistakes, knowing dangers and risks in thermal power, and
to mitigate or even better inhibit conflicts between experts
and new graduate employees.
IV.
APPLICATION OF COMMONKADS TO AN ALGERIAN
THERMAL POWER PLANT
We applied CommonKADS to an Algerian thermal
power plant. Organizational models, tasks, agents are shown
in successsive sections. An extract of data sheme is
presented in the class diagram in UML language [12] (Fig.
2). The principle of monitoring and diagnosis is illustrated
in the diagram activity in UML language (Fig. 3).

A.
Organizational model
Identifying problems in the organization and solution-
oriented knowledge opportunities are the first steps. During
the next decade, the working age population will begin to
decline when experts retire. Exporting know-how (tacit
knowledge) is critical to the future of a company expertise.
TABLE I.
KNOWLEDGE PROBLEMS AND THEIR PROPOSED SOLUTIONS
B.
The knowledge model
The knowledge model proposed in the CommonKADS
methodology allows specifying the types, structures and
roles of knowledge. This model contains three kinds of
knowledge, namely, knowledge of the domain, inference,
and task.
a) The knowledge domain
The S-lubrication concept has attributes which can take
values. For each attribute, we define a type-of-value (value-
type), such as the type-sealing system. It is a symbolic
variable and takes two values (sealed or unsealed) (Fig. 4).
Figure 4.
The concept S-lubrication in CML2 language.
Figure 5. Value-sealing-system in CML2 language.
Figure 6. The relationship between group-turbine generator and alarm
signals in CML2 language.
b) The task knowledge
The second step in building the knowledge model is
knowledge of the task; therefore, the task identification is
very important. The task will support the knowledge-based
system of the diagnosis failure. The knowledge model of the
task has to define the task and the method to achieve it.
Figure 7. Knowledge model of the task.
c) The knowledge inference
Knowledge inference in a knowledge model describes
the inferences, which is the lowest level of a functional
decomposition. The last step of building a knowledge model
is a description of each inference. Figure 8 shows the
inference structure for fault diagnosis task. Inferences

AN IMPLEMENTATION TOOL FOR THE EXPERTISE
MODELUSING THE COMMONKADS METHODOLOGY
A. CML2 language
CML2 (Conceptual Modeling Language) is a semi-
formal language and specific model of knowledge used by
CommonKADS method.
B. Presentation of G2
G2 is a generator of high performance expert systems
development
assistance;
it
is
used
to
support
many
applications
involving
various
techniques
of
artificial
intelligence: Diagnosis, alarm filtering optimization control
and supervision.
C. Specific language of G2
The natural language of G2 is a formal and structured
language; a developer can express instructions with familiar
terms and syntax, because G2 is close to English, which is a
benefit for a developer. The natural language of G2 offers:

An interactive text editor to edit instructions for
rules, procedures.

An interactive graphics editor with:
• Icons objects
• Curves, plans, tables, tools
• Buttons, dialog boxes
• Message, etc.
D.
The domain knowledge
Knowledge of the domain contains a domain schema,
which describes schematically the types of knowledge and
information to build a knowledge-based system.
1) Domain schema
A schema of concepts, attributes, types of values,
relationships between concepts, types of rules and relations
between values is defined.
2) Comparative study between CML2 and G2
A comparison is elaborated, according to some criteria,
between modeling language of CommonKADS which is
CML2 and the language of the generator of expert systems
G2, which we used for implementing our human expert
system
after
externalization
of
tacit
knowledge
from
experience of experts of the thermal power plant.
a) Concepts
The object-oriented concept is the basis of development
in G2. The object can represent something physical like a
pump, a valve or something abstract like an event, a task, a
message, etc.
An object class defines the properties and behavior of
objects (attributes icon, etc.). G2 contains several classes
that can be defined and inherited by the classes defined by
the user. G2 in any class that inherits from a class above
should contain all the attributes of the parent class.
Figure 11 presents the notion of concept in the language
CML2 of CommonKADS method and the specific language
of G2:

b) Attributes of concepts
The attributes are the characteristics of an object. Each
execution of an application under G2 is based on the
behavior of objects and defined object classes.
Figure 12. The attributes CML2 and G2.
c) The type of values
In G2, types of current values of attributes are more
interesting than in CML2, and easier to be handled.
These values are recorded directly in the table object.
Figure 13. The types of values CML2 and G2.
d) Relations between concepts
G2 has two ways to define relationships between
objects: connections and relationships, connections are used
to
represent
a
physical
connection
between
objects.
Relations are only created at runtime and have not a
graphical representation, and they have no attributes. They
can be specified one by one, one to many, or many to many.
Figure 14. Types of relationship CML2 and G2.
E.
The inference knowledge
G2 is an inference engine developing an object referring
to the rules associated to this object, uses backward chaining
to find values and forward chaining rules if a value is
received.
Figure 15. Presentation inference CML2 and G2.
F.
Communication model
The
communication
model
allows
conceptual
independent modeling of interactions between different
agents involved in a task. The agent could be an expert,
operator or a system of monitoring. Figure 16
illustrates
communication
between
different
agents

IMPLEMENTING KNOWLEDGE MODEL BY G2
A. The domain knowledge in G2
Domain objects are defined by icons. Each class object
can have its own icon with, in this case the superclass is the
central class, all elements inherit the characteristics of the
superclass.
Figure 17. The attributes of the lubrication system in G2.
B. Variables
All objects of the same class have the same general
structure, using the following variables. These variables are
recorded directly in the object table, and can have a real-
time representation.
Figure 18 refers to the alarm messages lubrication system.
Figure 18. Variables used in the knowledge-based system in G2.
C. The rules used to check alarm
These rules for inference check if alarmis true or false.
D. The procedures
G2 contains a procedural programming language; it
provides procedures to perform sequential actions. These
procedures for inference identify probable causes and
appear as a message.
Figure 19. The procedures used for inference as identified in G2.
E. The results of the identified inference
The results of the inference are suggesting probable
causes of a failure identified by the expert, as a message
understood by the operating personnel.
Figure 20. The output of the inference in G2.
VII.
CONCLUSION
We
developed
a
knowledge-based
system
under
CommonKADS methodology for the application at the
thermal
power.
The
knowledge
model
specifies
requirements knowledge/reasoning system knowledge base
to implement. Then, we presented a tool that combines
domain
knowledge
(concepts,
attributes,
relationships,
values, variables) and knowledge inference (G2 contains an
inference engine, rules, procedures, formulas, methods).

We found that CommonKADS is structured and offers a
systematic development of based-knowledge systems, via
many facilities in knowledge modeling. It is easy to
understand its configuration, and
ensures reusability.
Otherwise, CommonKADS presents weaknesses, such as
difficulties in the acquisition phase of knowledge, use of a
semi-formal language CML2, which we replaced in our
work with the natural language of the generator of expert
systems G2.
We proposed to use the structured and natural language
of G2 to define all the elements of the CommonKADS
method for extracting better knowledge of an application,
without using CML language which is a language with a
semi-formal complexity in reasoning rules.
This broadens the scope of use of the method and builds
a knowledge-based system more sophisticated.
We believe that this methodology will be used to keep
formalization of the panel memory; achieving system
diagnosis aid may be concretely useful to promote the
sharing of knowledge between experts and all operating
agents and manage the operational know-how of expert’s
field.
Our work emerges from several perspectives:

The application of the methodology CommonKADS
in real time.

The generation of this method for all operating tasks
and maintenance.

The use of model expertise to optimize the process
of preventive and predictive maintenance.

Building a book of knowledge that provides a
complete memory reproducing the know-how and
skills of experts is useful for a company. Our
solutions could be used by other manufacturing
systems; cement and cylinder manufacturing, etc.
