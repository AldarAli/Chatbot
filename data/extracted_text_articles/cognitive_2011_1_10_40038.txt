Abstract—Recent research has shown that cognitive load has 
an effect on gait, especially noticeable in people with 
neurodegenerative disorders. Sophisticated and expensive 
systems are commonly used to measure the variability of gait 
parameters under different cognitive loads. In this paper, we 
propose the use of smart phones and off-the-shelf wireless 
accelerometers to study the influence of cognitive load on gait. 
Making use of this new approach, we measure the effect of 
common “working memory” or “motor” tasks on gait. We also 
analyze the effect on gait variability derived from imposing a 
speed while walking in a treadmill. Our results show that 
current state-of-the-art smart phones and off-the-shelf 
accelerometers can be successfully used to analyze the effect of 
cognitive load on gait.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
There is a growing interest in clarifying the relationship 
between cognition and gait. In the past, walking was 
considered a motor activity independent of any cognitive 
processes and performed automatically by healthy adults. 
However, recent research shows that cognitive load has an 
effect on gait [1-4], especially noticeable in people with 
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease [5], 
vascular dementia, mixed dementia [6] or Parkinson’s 
disease [7]. Psycho affective conditions such as anxiety and 
depression are also linked to specific gait disorders [8]. More 
specifically, a decrease in the frontal cerebral blood flow has 
been associated with modifications in gait [9]. As shown in 
[10, 
11] 
and 
references 
therein, 
cerebral 
vascular 
abnormalities are associated with modifications of the gait 
pattern, namely an increased variability of spatio-temporal 
gait parameters. These observations are consistent with 
studies claiming that gait requires cognitive processes such 
as attention, memory and planning [12, 13], demanding 
frontal and parietal activity in the brain [14, 15]. In fact, 
changes in the frontal regions including the bilateral medial 
areas of the frontal cortex have been identified as a risk 
factor for dementia [16-18], and reductions in the motor 
strength associated with aging increase the attentional 
demands needed for walking.  
The most popular method to analyze the effect of 
cognitive load on gait is the dual task test [3, 4, 10, 12, 19, 
20, 21-29], in which the subject under study performs a 
cognitive 
task 
while 
simultaneously 
walking. 
Most 
researchers choose to avoid prioritizing any of the tasks. 
Since the dual task conditions impose a higher attentional 
demand, the performance in one or both tasks can be 
impaired if the attentional reserve capacity available is 
challenged [22, 30, 31]. This is known as “dual task 
interference”. The effect of the dual task test on gait can be 
quantified through the variability in the spatio-temporal 
parameters of gait, which will depend on the complexity of 
the task and the general condition of the subject [32-36]. For 
example, the effect of the cognitive task on gait can depend 
on factors such as age, gender, executive function, memory 
and verbal IQ [2, 32, 33, 37-42]. 
Another application of the dual task test is to show the 
link between attentional demands and postural control [32, 
43-49]. Recent studies claim that postural stability requires 
both cognitive and sensorimotor processes [50], and 
researchers are analyzing the impact of different details (e.g. 
speech complexity [51]) on postural control. In the same 
sense, the dual task test can be utilized to study the capacity 
of older adults to avoid obstacles [52]. In fact, gait stability 
can be a better predictor of falling than static measures of 
balance [40]. Recent studies have shown a relationship 
between dual task interference and fall risk [53, 54]. For 
instance, a simple measurement of the counting performance 
while walking in comparison with while seated has proved to 
be a good indicator of fall risk in the elderly [53]. In 
particular, there is a growing interest in studying the link 
between the variability of spatial-temporal parameters in gait 
under dual task conditions and the risk of falling in seniors 
[20, 37, 38, 55, 56]. 
In this paper, we review the state of the art in the study of 
cognitive load on gait, showing the different systems, dual 
task tests and spatio-temporal parameters employed by 
researchers in this field. Subsequently, we propose the use of 
smart phones and off-the-shelf accelerometers to measure the 
effect of common “working memory” and “motor” tasks on 
gait. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in 
this field employing this new technology. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 
2, we survey the most common dual tasks employed by 
researchers, and in Section 3, we review the systems utilized 
to analyze the influence of cognitive load on gait and 
postural control. Section 4 focuses on the spatio-temporal 
parameters leveraged for the analysis of cognitive load on 
gait. In Section 5, we describe our proposed methodology 
using smart phones with off-the-shelf accelerometers, and 
summarize tests results. Conclusions are drawn in Section 6.

II. 
DUAL TASK TESTS 
Most of the existing research in this field involves the 
analysis of the effect of a second task on gait or postural 
control. Some researchers claim that dual task interference is 
only possible if the neural networks involved in the two 
processes overlap [2]. For instance, reference [33] suggests 
that only visual/spatial dual tasks would interfere with 
postural 
control, 
since 
postural 
control 
demands 
visual/spatial processing. However, there is no consensus on 
the optimum dual tasks with which to evaluate gait or 
postural control. 
Some of the dual tasks employed by researchers are 
borrowed from neuropsychological tests, while others are 
created specifically for each experiment. And even if there is 
a lack of a standardized evaluation technique to compare the 
cognitive loads demanded by each task, most researchers 
follow practical guidelines to carry out the tests: the task 
should be difficult enough to load the attentional system, but 
it should not cause undue stress or anxiety. Also, the test 
should take into consideration the subject’s skills (e.g. 
mathematical, verbal fluency), since the cognitive loads 
brought by a same task can vary depending on the subject’s 
skills [2]. Table I gathers the most common tasks employed 
by researchers. These tasks can be assigned different 
percentages according to their importance levels and the 
application context.

SYSTEMS EMPLOYED TO ANALYZE THE INFLUENCE 
OF COGNITIVE LOAD ON GAIT AND POSTURAL CONTROL 
A basic approach to analyze human kinematics is 
chronophotography [57]. More sophisticated motion tracking 
systems utilize mechanical, acoustic (including ultrasounds), 
radio-frequency, optical, magnetic, and inertial sensors. 
Descriptions and examples of these systems can be found in 
[58]. The suitability of each system depends on the particular 
conditions and goals of each test. The combination of 
different methods in a multi-modal approach allows an 
enhancement in accuracy and robustness in terms of security. 
In other words, complementing methods can help overcome 
their weaknesses.  
One of the most common and sophisticated commercial 
systems employed in existing research is the GAITRite 
walkway [59, 60], with embedded force sensors to detect 
footfalls and a length of nearly 5 meters, allowing the 
estimation of gait parameters such as speed, length and width 
of the step, and symmetry of the gait pattern. This system 
enjoys high reliability and high concurrent validity when 
compared with video-based motion analysis systems for 
spatiotemporal gait parameters such as gait speed, cadence, 
and stride length. 
For the analysis of postural control, the most common 
solution consists of sensors or force plates installed on the 
floor [61-63]. Commercial examples of such systems 
employed in existing research are described in [20] and [51]. 
Other researchers utilize custom made plates attached to the 
subject to overcome the movement restriction due to the 
small size of force plates. Examples of these approaches 
include the employment of force transducers beneath the 
shoe, pressure insoles and miniature triaxial piezoelectric 
transducers inside the shoe [58].

SPATIO-TEMPORAL PARAMETERS EMPLOYED TO 
ANALYZE THE EFFECT OF COGNITIVE LOAD ON GAIT 
Gait velocity can be used as an indicator of the quality of 
life in the elderly [64]. In this sense, increased variability of 
spatio-temporal gait parameters has been linked to cognitive 
abnormalities [1, 11]. And although numerous gait 
parameters can be measured in sophisticated gait labs, many 
studies focus basically on mean gait speed and stride-to-
stride variability in gait speed [37]. In fact, gait velocity and 
stride-to-stride variability in gait velocity have been 
identified as the best predictors of falls for the elderly [38, 
65]. Stride-to-stride variability (V) in gait speed is commonly 
quantified as the percentage of the standard deviation (SD) to 
the mean [37]:

Other researchers also focus on stride time and swing 
time variabilities [66, 67]. Table III gathers representative 
gait parameters used by researchers to analyze the effect of 
cognitive load on gait.

SUMMARY OF MODIFICATIONS IN SPATIO-TEMPORAL 
GAIT PARAMETERS UNDER DUAL TASK CONDITIONS. 
Gait Parameters 
Decreased gait velocity (as a compensation mechanism which people 
take when stability is challenged). It is interesting to note that this 
parameter is associated with errors in the cognitive dual-task (e.g. 
poorer arithmetic ability [12] or verbal reaction time [52]) 
Decreased stride length   
Increased double support time  
Increased gait cycle time variability  
Increased variability in stride length  
Increased variability in gait speed (greater variability in men than in 
women)  
Decreased cadence  
Increased lateral gait instability (only with arithmetic dual task, but not 
with verbal fluency task) 
Increased postural sway, which is impacted by articulation and visual 
conditions, but not by attentional load (e.g. silent counting)

PROPOSED METHODOLOGY AND TESTS TO ANALIZE 
THE EFFECT OF COGNITIVE LOAD ON GAIT 
We propose to study the effect of cognitive load on gait 
leveraging off-the-shelf wireless accelerometers and smart 
phones implementing a light-weight and low-cost system 
that enables the analysis of gait parameters’ variability with 
an accuracy comparable to the most sophisticated and 
expensive systems available in the market. In particular, we 
analyze through the wavelet transform the signals obtained 
from off-the-shelf wireless accelerometers placed on the 
waist and the ankle of the person under study. These 
wireless accelerometers transmit their signals to a 
processing unit (e.g. smart phone or laptop) using 
Bluetooth. The signal processing methodology we use is 
summarized next.

relationship between the wavelet transform coefficients and 
the kinetic energy of different walking patterns, we can 
actually infer the speed of the movement with the following

where J represents the number of levels of decomposition 
we are using in the wavelet transform, i accounts for the 
specific level we are considering, di symbolizes the detail 
coefficients at level i, and n0 represents the number of 
coefficients considered. In (4), we have considered the first 
5 levels of decomposition in order to cover the frequency 
content of the acceleration ranging from 0.46 Hz to 15 Hz 
(our sampling frequency is 30 Hz), thus including the most 
important frequencies of gait, which are typically between 
0.5 Hz and 4 Hz. We have tested this approach with a total 
of 14 individuals (males and females with ages ranging from 
21 to 77), obtaining excellent accuracies in the velocities, 
with average errors around 5%. In fact, the accuracy of our 
approach is comparable to that obtained with more complex 
and expensive systems, and our results are achieved with 
significantly lower hardware requirements. Once we obtain 
the velocity of the movement, the step length can be 
calculated dividing the velocity by the step frequency, 
which we can obtain from an accelerometer on the ankle 
(through the detection of peaks). 
Making use of this new approach, we carried out tests to 
study the influence of cognitive load on gait. In particular, 
we measured the variability of velocities and stride lengths 
under classical dual task tests such as walking while holding 
a tray with a glass full of water, or walking while 
performing arithmetic calculations out loud (serial 7 and 13 
subtractions). Comparing these results with free walking 
conditions (summary in Table V), we can notice decreases 
in the mean velocities and stride lengths of the individuals 
while performing the dual tasks. Regarding the percentage 
variabilities of velocity and stride length, these terms 
increase in all the dual task tests. All these results match 
perfectly with those obtained by other researchers 
employing more sophisticated systems. In conclusion, the 
effect of common “working memory” or “motor” tasks 
employed in tests for the analysis of cognitive load on gait 
can be measured with current state-of-the-art smart phones 
and off-the-shelf accelerometers, without the need of 
sophisticated and expensive equipment.

Making use of our new approach we also analyzed the 
effect of imposing a velocity (the person should walk on a 
treadmill at a selected speed). For these tests, 20 individuals 
(ages ranging from 11 to 59) walked in a treadmill at the 
suggested speeds of 1 mph, 2 mph, 3 mph, 5 mph and 2 mph 
with inclination. The results regarding the variabilities in 
velocities (obtained as the percentage of the standard 
deviation to the mean) are summarizes in Figure 1.

As observed in Figure 1, there is no significant effect on 
the variability of velocity when the individual is told to keep 
a fixed speed, in comparison with walking at free speed. 
Only at very low speeds (walking type 1 in Figure 1) or 
when the walking surface is kept inclined (walking type 4 in 
Figure 1), the velocity variabilities are higher than those 
obtained without the cognitive load of having to keep a 
constant speed.
