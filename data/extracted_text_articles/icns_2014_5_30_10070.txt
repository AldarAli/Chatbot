Abstract—Much has been written about the depletion of IANA’s
pool of IPv4 addresses and the needs of urgent transition to
IPv6. Several of the biggest content and service providers have
enabled IPv6, however, there is still the lack of information
about worldwide IPv6 adoption and quality of services that are
measured in large scale. The aim of this paper is to present our
methodology to measure penetration and quality of IPv6 adoption
amongst web, mail and DNS service providers. The system is
built to provide an open online access to IPv6 adoption overview
for the whole community. The paper discusses our methodology
and measurement system and compares them with other known
solutions. The analysis of collected data is presented to help to
understand the IPv6 penetration.

INTRODUCTION
Two crucial events concerning IPv6 happened in last two
years. The IPv6 Day on June 8th 2011 and IPv6 Launch
on June 6th 2012. These events should have motivated the
activity of service and content providers to enable IPv6. The
IPv6 Day was considered as a testing day on which mainly
the content providers enabled IPv6 for 24 hours. The event
should have tested how many clients would connect to their
dual stack web servers, how big would be the bandwidth
shift from IPv4 to IPv6 and how many clients would have
problems with their IPv6 connectivity. Observation conﬁrmed
an increase of IPv6 trafﬁc and changes in application mix.
Google kept IPv6 enabled for several YouTube servers, thus
the main contributor for IPv6 trafﬁc since then is YouTube as
Sarrar et al. [1] showed in their report and our observation
conﬁrms their results. Thanks to the results from IPv6 day,
big content providers decided to turn on IPv6 permanently
one year later on IPv6 Launch day.
However, big content providers such as Google, YouTube,
Akamai etc. do not represent the whole Internet. Millions of
other websites still remain without IPv6 addresses. What is
the ratio of enabled IPv6 websites and services (e.g., mail
servers, name servers) and is the ratio increasing or stagnant?
Even more, if IPv6 is enabled, is the quality of service (e.g.,
response time) better, worse or the same as in IPv4? These are
the questions the paper tries to answer.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II describes
related work. Methodology, system’s architecture and imple-
mentation are described in section III. Data analysis and com-
parison of projects measuring IPv6 penetration are discussed in
section IV. Section V evaluates validity of results. Comparison
of results with other projects is presented as well. Conclusion
and future work are discussed in section VI.
II.
RELATED WORK
There are several approaches to measure IPv6 adoption.
Measurement can be performed on the content provider’s
side. The methodology is typically based on inserting a small
invisible image [2] or JavaScript fragment [3] into the content
of content provider’s web page. Client’s browser executes the
code or tries to download the image using IPv4, IPv6 or other
transition technology (6to4, Teredo). The analysis of requests
can show the number of clients that can or cannot connect to
dual-stack Web servers and their latency. This methodology
measures clients. It shows, if IPv6 is supported by application
(web browser), operating system and client’s ISP (Internet
Service Provider). The number of ”consumers” is essential
for content providers, because without IPv6 active customers
they will not invest their time and money to IPv6 transition.
Currently, the numbers are around 2.5 %, as it is shown in
Google’s IPv6 statistics, with some exceptions like Romania
and France as shown in Geoff Huston’s statistics [4].
Another method is based on measuring the number of
autonomous systems announcing an IPv6 preﬁx. The statis-
tics inform how ISPs and transition networks are prepared
to provide IPv6 connectivity for their customers. The good
analysis was presented by Karpilovsky et al. [5]. Their study
has shown, that almost half of preﬁxes are not used at all and
the rest of them is announced long after the allocation. The
drawback of the methodology is that the presence of an ISP’s
IPv6 preﬁx in the global BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) table
does not mean availability of IPv6 for ISP’s customers. Despite
of that, the number of IPv6 preﬁxes in global routing table is
increasing and can be seen as IPv6 transition progress.
One way of measuring the quality of IPv6 service is to
measure the one-way delay. Zhou et al. [6], [7] published a
study comparing IPv4 and IPv6 one-way delay between several
measurement points. They analyzed the RIPE IPv6 data, which
include traceroute, delay, and loss measurements among a list
of IPv6 sites since 2003. Their conclusion is that native IPv6
paths have small 2.5 percentile and median end-to-end delay,
and comparable delay to their IPv4 counterparts. The study
presented by Arthur Berger [8] found that the latency is less
over v4 than v6. For example, for destinations in the North
America, the mean latency is 55 ms over v4 but substantially
higher, 101 ms, over v6. The difference between the IPv4 -
IPv6 performance is more likely correlated with a different
forward AS-level path as was reported by Amogh Dhamdhere
et al. [9]. The measurement by Mehdi Nikkhah et al. [10]
compares performance of IPv6 and IPv4 protocol by measuring
the web page download time. They found that control plane

(routing) is responsible for differences between IPv4 and IPv6,
because the data plane performs comparably.
The methods described above provide information about
IPv6 preﬁx allocation, measures of clients, or test the path
delay. The paper presented by Jakub Czyz et al. [11] tries
to analysis the IPv6 adoption from several perspectives -
allocation of IPv6 preﬁxes, clients readiness etc. However, the
ISPs are more interested in the number of content providers
that enabled IPv6 for their services. The number can indicate
how much IPv6 trafﬁc service providers will expect in case
they decide to deploy IPv6. The next important information
is the quantity of sites reachable from IPv6 only networks.
Several measurements have been published to describe these
information [12]–[17]. These papers will be analyzed in more
detail in the Section V.
This paper describes the measuring platform for gathering
long-term statistics about IPv6 penetration amongst content
providers. The measuring is focused on the penetration of web
services, mail services and name services available over IPv6.
The paper compares also IPv4 and IPv6 one-way delay for
web services to measure the quality of connection from the
users perspective. The results obtained during the information
gathering are discussed together with comparison to other
services using similar methodology.
III.
METHODOLOGY, ARCHITECTURE AND
IMPLEMENTATION
IPv6 penetration amongst content providers can be mea-
sured by checking the appropriate resource records (RR) in
DNS. Table I brieﬂy describes the RRs tested in our method-
ology. If any record contains CNAME record it is followed until
a valid record for IPv4 (A) or IPv6 (AAAA) is found. The web
services are also checked if an alternative record for IPv6 is
available such as www6, ipv6, www.v6. The alternative
records are sometimes used by network administrators for
testing purposes. Availability of records in DNS is tested
periodically and is described in more detail in the section III-A.

The response time of web services is measured for sites
announcing web services over IPv4 and IPv6 protocol as well.
Using IPv4 and IPv6, the system tries to connect to the remote
web server. The time is measured between the ﬁrst packet
initiating relation (SYN) and the answer from the server (SYN,
ACK). Comparing the results obtained via IPv4 and IPv6, it
can be observed, which protocol has a better response. We are
aware of the fact, that the IPv6/IPv4 response time can vary
from location to location (due to asymmetric routing, missing
IPv4/IPv6 peering, different number of hops, link quality, etc.),
however, the goal is to measure the quality from the perspective
of our users.
A. Architecture and Implementation
The architecture of the system is divided into several blocks
as is depicted in the Figure 1. The core of the system is SQL
database containing list of domains and statistical data. There
are two subsystems connected to the database. The ﬁrst one
is responsible for querying DNS system. It takes the list of
domains from the database and periodically updates data with
the information gathered from DNS. The history of changes
for each record is stored as well, allowing us to provide current
and historic data for each domain in the database. The next
subsystem performs the check of IPv6 quality by measuring
the one path delay as was described in the previous section.
It also updates information into domains database and stores
historical information of each measurement.

B. Frequency of Updates
The DNS update process is executed every day, running in
parallel using 100 threads to get the maximum performance.
To update records and gather all data related to one domain,
approximately 10 queries are needed. The system is able to
obtain data for more than 100 domains per second. That means,
the system must perform approximately 1000 DNS queries per
second. Using database containing almost 9 million records,
the whole update process takes approximately 2 days. Domains
are queried in a random order to avoid the overloading of DNS
servers. As was stated in the previous section, web domains
supporting both protocols are checked to measure the quality of
service. The update process is executed every day for domains
that enabled IPv6 for a web service in past 24 hours. All dual
stacked domains in the database are checked periodically once
a week. The whole update process takes close to 6 hours for the
database containing currently approximately 415 000 of dual
stacked domains. However, the DNS system contains errors
causing data inaccuracies. To get rid of invalid data, the system
uses following rules:
•
Queries returning addresses that belong to the re-
served address space (private, link local) are ig-
nored
e.g.,
192.168.0.0/16, 10.0.0.0/8,
fe80::/10.
•
Address of loopback is ignored (127.0.0.1/8,
::1/128)
•
Records with endless loop are ignored - a CNAME
record points to another CNAME which points back
to the original CNAME.
•
The CNAME chain is followed up to 10 levels
•

etc.
are ignored. The list of patterns is managed manually.
C. Data Sources
The total number of tested domains will determine the
precision of the system as is shown in the section IV. The
results will be more accurate with the growing number of
tested domains. A popular source of domains is the list of
domains provided by Alexa The Web Information Company.
It is possible to download daily updated list of the top 1
million sites for free in csv format from the Alexa’s webpage.
However, we believe that only the top list is not enough. For
example, there are about 4 500 domains within Czech TLD in
the Alexa’s top list. The total number of domains in Czech
TLD is approximately 1000000 thus the list contains less
than 0.5 % registered CZ TLD domains. We believe that this
extensively small number of domains is not enough to provide
accurate results of IPv6 penetration. Another drawback of
using Alexa data set only is that all sub domains are aggregated
to appropriate TLD. It is quite common, that subdomains
are used for different services, e.g., scholar.google.com
and maps.google.com, however, subdomains are included
neither in top 1 million sites nor in the list of top 500 sites per
country. Using only top 1 million sites, it is impossible to check
if subdomains are accessible via IPv6 or not. In the previous
example, scholar.google.com is accessible only over
IPv4 and maps.google.com is dual stacked website.
Other sources populating the database can be logs from
mail server, DNS cache and reverse lookup of addresses
accessing a network. The amount of domains that can be
collected using these methods depends mainly on the network
design and the number of users. In our case, we were able
to collect initially approximately 100 000 of valid domains.
Unfortunately, the growth of domains in the database was
slow. The main reason for the slow growth is that we are
a campus network without control of DNS and mail servers
used by faculties of the university. To extend the number of
domains and overcome the drawbacks of using only Alexa top
sites, and DNS cache, the following solution was developed.
Several probes are used in the Brno University of Technology’s
campus network listening to all HTTP requests performed by
users. The requests are inspected using the httpry HTTP
analyzer [18]. The advantage of this solution is that the probes
are able to intercept all HTTP trafﬁc from the whole university.
The output from the analyzer is sent to a collector where the
requests are stored in the HTTP requests database as depicted
in the Figure 1. Once per day, the update process adds the
new unique domains into the main database. Another source
of new domains is a web interface that we provide on our site.
Anybody can use the interface to check data of any domain
and if the requested domain is not found, it will be added into
the database. Lastly, the system is open to add any other source
- e.g., import of whole zone ﬁle.
It is also important to remove domains that do not exist
or have disappeared from DNS. If the domain does not
contain any valid record (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS), the
domain is removed from the database including all related
historical records. If the domain is added later using one of

the approaches described above, it is treated as a new record
in the database.
As of December 2013, the database contains approximately
9 million of domains [19]. The number is depicted in the
Figure 2 and it is still growing as connected users are actively
building the database with their HTTP requests. To summarize,
the beneﬁts of this approach is following:
•
Independence on third party data sets (Alexa list).
•
Visibility of IPv6 enabled sites, which are interesting
for our users.
•
Visibility of sub domains in a TLDdomain. This is
useful because Alexa list does not provide informa-
tion, about visited subdomains, only aggregated data.
•
Long term solution with minimum maintenance.
IV.
DATA ANALYSIS
Data collection is still ongoing. This paper presents data
collected up to August 2013. The total number of web domains
is deﬁned as NWT, the number of web domains supporting
web services over IPv6 as NWV6, the number of web domains
supporting dualstack as NWDS and the number of web domains
supporting IPv6 web through alternative name as NWA6.
•
NWT - domains having at least one IPv4 or IPv6 record
announced for www.<domain>.
•
NWV6 - domains having at least one IPv6 (AAAA)
record and do not have IPv4 record (A) announced
for www.<domain>.
•
NWV4 - domains having at least one IPv4 (A) record
and do not have IPv6 record (AAAA) announced for
www.<domain> and do not have alternative IPv6
record www6|ipv6|www.v6.<domain>
•
NWDS - domains having both IPv6 and IPv4 records
announced for www.<domain>.

The penetration ratio of IPv4 only sites is computed as
shown in equation 1. Other ratios are computed using the same
formula but the numerator is changed accordingly to NWV6 for
IPv6 only sites ratio, NWDS for dualstack ratio etc.

Based on these rules, we can analyze the data in our
database to obtain the IPv6 penetration amongst web service
as shown in Table II. As we can see, the majority of web
pages is accessible using the IPv4 protocols or more precisely
99.9985 %. Despite the two big IPv6 events in last two years
and the fact, that IPv4 addresses are depleted in APNIC and
RIPE regions, the number of web sites accessible over IPv6
still stays on a very low level. The IPv6 only domains are
usually without any meaningful content for end users. These
are test websites used for testing user’s IPv4/ IPv6 connectivity
[4], sites where a www.<domain> has only AAAA record,
but there is also record for <domain> which is accessible
via IPv4 etc. DNS and mail services accessibility using IPv4
protocol is 99.99969 % and 99.99968 % but the availability
using IPv6 protocol is much higher in comparison to web
sites. The higher penetration of these services corresponds to
deployment strategy for a new service, where an administrator
goes from the key services to the less important ones.
V.
VALIDITY OF THE RESULTS
Every measuring system must prove that data provided
by the system are trustworthy. To provide the most accurate
penetration of IPv6 services, all DNS data would have to
be collected. This approach is however impossible thus we
compared our data with similar projects. All projects with no
exception use list of domains provided by Alexa and usually
only a subset of the top 1 million is used.
The projects are compared in the Table III. The Tests
column describes which tests projects run. The web test
obtains the evidence of an AAAA record for selected domain.
alt test checks an existence of alternative names for the
domain (e.g., v6.<domain>). MX and NS tests are testing
presence of AAAA record for mail and DNS services, DNSSEC
and SPF verify the support for these services and avail test
measures the quality of connection using both IPv4 and IPv6.
Results for global penetration and selected TLDs that
in most statistics indicate the largest IPv6 penetration are
compared in the Table IV. The comparison is based on the
data from 17th August 2013 or latest available. As we can see
in the Table IV the obtained results are very different. The
Figure 3 shows one of the reasons for such distinction. The
chart can be interpreted as follows: IPv6 penetration (y axis) is
calculated for every number of domains (x axis). For example,
IPv6 penetration for ﬁrst 3 domains according to Alexa order

is 100 % in .com TLD. If the ratio is evaluated for top 5
domains, it drops to 60 %. If we use the same data source
and top 500 domains, the penetration decreases to 4.86 %.
The results show that it strongly depends on the number of
involved records used for calculation of IPv6 ratio. This also
means, that IPv6 penetration calculated only on several top
websites will tend to over-estimate the overall IPv6 penetration
in web domains.
It can be seen that the IPv6 ratio becomes more stable for
more than 1000 records. The increasing IPv6 penetration for
some TLDs after 5 000 domains is caused by the fact, that the
rest of the data set does not have any ranking, thus is sorted
randomly. The number of requests must be increased at least to
10 000 records in the case of global IPv6 penetration where all
domains and countries are involved. Using a smaller number of
domains will again tent to over-estimate the IPv6 penetration.
Similar observation was published by IPv6 Observatory [13].
A minimum of 10 000 domains is necessary to estimate the
ratio of domains having an AAAA record as calculated from
the top 1 million domains with an error in the range [-0.5;0.5].
The IPv6 Observatory, however, runs analysis using top 500
sites per TLD as was described in the Table IV.
Another reason for such a big difference between the
projects’ IPv6 penetration is that the projects use different
methodologies. For example, the IPv6matrix project shows
58.55 % of IPv6 penetration for .cz TLD. This is due to the
fact that IPv6matrix counts a domain as IPv6 enabled if the do-
main has an AAAA record for NS or MX or web or NTP server.
As shown in the Table II, the penetration of AAAA records
for NS and MX records is high, thus IPv6matrix shows much
higher penetration than others. The 6lab.cisco.com project uses
methodology which counts a weight of a domain. The weight
of a domain is an approximation based on pageviews from
Alexa statistics. The consequence of the weight is that more
visited domains with IPv6 increase the IPv6 ratio for the
country. This is based on an idea, that users are more likely
to connect, spend time and access content on a very small
number of sites as stated in their report [17]. To analyze the
assumption, we used all HTTP requests made by all users in the

BUT network in a day. The requested domains were aggregated
to the ﬁrst subdomain after TLD - e.g., maps.google.com
to google.com. This is due the fact, that Alexa list does
not contain subdomains. The Table V describes the requested
domains which were found or were not found in the Alexa
list. The column Ratio stand for the chance, that a domain is
found in the list. The results conﬁrm that a majority of requests
is found in the Alexa top list, but there is still a signiﬁcant
number of requests that is not found - almost 30 % of requests
for .cz TLD are not found in the Alexa list. Relying only
on Alexa list, the IPv6 penetration could be overestimated,
because the domains which are not found in the Alexa list
show much lower IPv6 penetration.
The HTTP requests for TLDs .com and .cz were further
analyzed and the Figure 4 shows the difference between
IPv6 penetration within the HTTP requests which were/were
not found in the Alexa list. For example, the line COM
found shows that IPv6 ratio is almost 50 % amongst the
HTTP requests which were found in the Alexa list; however,
it is bellow 10 % for the HTTP requests which were not
found as shows the line COM not found. The higher IPv6
penetration during the night is mainly because of automatic
updates, tests of IPv6 connection etc. - e.g., connections to
ds.download.windowsupdate.com. These requests are
not triggered by users. Although, it seems signiﬁcant that
approximately half of HTTP requests in .com TLD made by
our users is IPv6 enabled, it is necessary to understand, that
the reason lies in extensive usage of services like Google ads,
Google analytics and social plugins (Facebook’s ’like’ button,
etc.). These services are IPv6 enabled therefore, regarding a
user visiting a domain which uses these services, there would
be one request to obtain the domain and several other subre-
quests connecting to Facebook, Google and Twitter services.
The Figures 5 and 6 depict the performance between IPv4
and IPv6 connectivity using data from last two years. The
round trip time is measured as described in the section III.
The difference between these two protocols is counted as
IPv4 - IPv6, thus negative values represents measurements
where IPv6 is faster then IPv4. The graph in Figurer 5 plots
the distribution of the difference using cumulative distribution
function. The Figure 5 shows the frequency of measurements
using histogram to provide better insight into the numbers in
the <-5, 5>interval. Further analysis of the data shows, that
IPv6 is more than 1 ms faster in 16% of measurements in
2012 and 22 % in 2013. IPv4 is faster more than 1 ms in
40 % of measurements in 2012 and 18 % in 2013. It can be
seen, that the performance is usually similar - majority of
measurements ﬁts in the <-20, 20>interval. During the last
year, the performance of IPv6 improved and usually is almost
the same as IPv4. This can be a sign, that IPv6 is starting to
be used for production trafﬁc, however there is a substantial
number of sites (3.51 %) we were not able to connect to. These
non-working domains or slow IPv6 connectivity are nowadays
usually handled by implementation of Happy Eyeballs in
modern web browsers, however there is still a large fraction
of clients without Happy Eyeballs implementation.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The paper describes a system and a methodology used for
measuring IPv6 penetration amongst content providers. The
contribution of the paper is following. The system gathers data
from various sources and the latest data were analyzed. The
system does not rely on the Alexa list only but the database is
built actively from users’ HTTP requests in a fully automatic
way. The methodology for computing the IPv6 penetration
has been compared with other projects measuring the IPv6
adoption with ﬁnding that IPv6 penetration amongst domains
can vary from 13 to 60 percent. These differences are caused
by distinct methodologies and strongly depend on the number
of measured records. Unfortunately, only a subset of available
data set is used, thus the IPv6 adoption presented by different
projects is usually overestimated.
Based on the analyzed data, we are recommending to
use at least 1000 domains to compute the penetration for a
TLD. Global IPv6 ratio should be computed using as many
domains as possible. The all domains should be treat equally
without using any weight or only top x sites. The current IPv6

IPv4,IPv6 performance - number of measurements
methodologies measuring IPv6 penetration per TLD use top 50
or top 500 which overestimates the IPv6 penetration.
The presented system measures also quality of IPv6 con-
nectivity and the results are analyzed with ﬁnding that overall
IPv6 performance has been improved, although there are still
number of sites (3.51 %) that are not accessible over IPv6 even
though the website announce AAAA record.
The access to measured data together with all historical
data is available and open to everybody on the project webpage
[19]. As far as we know, our framework and methodology is
the only one, which save all historical data of every page, thus
we are able to see, when the AAAA record is added, removed
etc. Other methodologies measuring the IPv6 adoption update
the global IPv6 penetration only and does not keep the histor-
ical records. The future work could check sites’ unavailability
from different measuring points. We are also collecting the
information, if a domain is signed with DNSSEC [21] or if a
mail server provides SPF record [22]. This could also be a part
of a future analysis. We plan to keep collecting and processing
data, together with checking IPv4 and IPv6 performance.
