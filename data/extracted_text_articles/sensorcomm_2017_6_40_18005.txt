Abstract—
Wireless
sensor
networks
are
finding
widespread use nowadays with the development of
Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Due to their
wireless nature, these devices use batteries as their main
source of power. This creates the problem of continuity
of operation, because batteries have a limited lifetime.
Therefore,
sensors
capable
of
performing
energy
harvesting are preferred. The harvested energy can be
acquired from ambient or dedicated sources consisting
of mobile chargers. This paper deals with a charging
scheme for randomly distributed sensor nodes using a
mobile charger. The charging scheme consists of a
multiple-stage charging procedure, in which in each
stage an energy goal for the target sensor nodes is set up.
For charging in the first stage, all the sensor nodes are
classified into clusters. The theory of an inclusion circle
is used in this process. By clustering based on the
inclusion circle, a sensor node that is located around the
center of grouped sensor nodes is highly likely to be
selected as the cluster head.
The mobile charger only
concentrates about charging the cluster heads. The
charging path of the moving charger is determined
according to the locations of cluster heads. In the
following stages, new clusters are formed based on the
energy level of the sensor nodes in the system, and a new
target energy goal is set up for them.

INTRODUCTION
The currently rapid development of the IoT has seen a
large increase in the usage of sensor networks, generating
challenges for the performance of this technology [1]. The
provision of operating energy for IoT devices is becoming a
major bottleneck in the development of this technology. Due
to advances in chip design and in the deep submicron
fabrication process, sensors that feature characteristics of
low-power and low-cost are being adopted for a variety of
applications, including mission-critical ones. These mission-
critical applications, such as seismic activity [2][3], volcano
temperature
[4],
space
monitoring
[5],
disaster
relief
situation [6], human activity [7], and oceanic monitoring [8]
instruments
are
associated
with
hard-to-reach
sensor
locations. In these environments, it is extremely dangerous
and sometimes impossible to replace the batteries of the
sensor nodes. Depletion of energy by a sensor node is a very
important matter, one that highlights the importance of
power
provisioning.
From
this
perspective,
wireless
(re)charging is a viable solution for sensor nodes capable of
energy harvesting [9].
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In Section
II, we present the state of the art. In Section III, the
proposed scheme of the rechargeable wireless sensor node
with directional antenna is presented. Section IV details the
results of the simulation. Finally, Section V concludes the
paper.
II.
STATE OF THE ART
There are many different ways to provide energy to
sensor nodes in a rechargeable wireless sensor network. Fu et
al. [10] presented a charging scheme with a mobile charger.
The goal of their charging scheme is to find optimal
locations of the mobile charger that can facilitate minimum
charging time for all the sensor nodes to reach a target
energy level. Linear programming is used to find the optimal
spots at which the charger should be stationed over
individual sojourn times. Madhja et al. [11] proposed a
charging scheme employing multiple chargers, with two
different classes of mobile chargers being used. The chargers
that belong to the mobile charger class are responsible only
for charging the infrastructure sensor nodes; the charger in
the super charger class has the duty of charging the other
chargers in the mobile charger class as well as the sensor
nodes. Wang [12] presented a charging scheme with two
different types of energy sources. The sensor nodes are
clustered and the cluster heads have the capability of
harvesting solar energy, while the other nodes are charged by
mobile chargers transferring RF energy.
A
charging
scheme
comprising
multiple
stages
is
proposed in this paper. Initially, using the concept of an
inclusion circle, described by Moraes and Har [13], clusters
and cluster heads are formed amongst the sensor nodes.
Afterwards, the mobile charger will proceed to charge these
cluster heads until a target energy level El is reached. The
mobile
charger
can
have
either
a
directional
or
an
omnidirectional antenna. After all the cluster heads reach the
target energy level, a second charging stage is initiated. The
old clusters are disregarded and new clusters are formed, but
these clusters now include the energy level of each sensor

node as a criterion for being eligible for clustering. Only
nodes under the target energy level El from the previous
stage can participate in the new clustering procedure. A new
charging stage is carried out by the mobile charger with the
new cluster heads. The process of formation of new clusters
and charging by the charger is repeated until all the sensor
nodes in the system are charged to the final required level.
This avoids favoring more centralized sensor nodes in the
charging process, and the distributed nature of the charging
procedure contributes to both decreasing the charging time
and reducing energy expenditure
III.
PROPOSED SCHEME
Consider that there are NT sensor nodes randomly
scattered in a square area. It is assumed that the sensor
nodes in this case are fixed location nodes, for which the
position of each node is known by the charger. Also, the
charger has knowledge of each sensor node SoC (state of
charge), which is a common assumption. The charger can
move freely in the total service area.
The first step in the charging process is the initial
formation of clusters in the system. Many clustering
algorithms already exist in the literature, and for this work
the clustering algorithm utilized was the one described in
[13]. The number of clusters in this algorithm is determined
by
the
distribution
of
the
sensor
nodes,
and
not
predetermined before the clustering starts.
During the charging stages, the moving chargers only
focus on supplying energy to the cluster heads, as was done
in [13]. The time-varying change of charger location during
the charging process can be modeled by concatenated
discrete movements. The possible actions of the charger at
each discrete time step are either to stay at the same location
or to move to the next best location. The time interval ∆tc
for the next movement is uniformly set at 2.5msec; distance
rm between the current location and the next optimal
location is set at 0.05m during the simulations. If the next
discrete movement to the next location circle occurs over a
sizable time, and the location of the mobile charger is
continuously shifted accordingly, the velocity of the mobile
charger is (0.05m/2.5ms)=72km/hour. This circle is shown
in Figure 1 (a). While the next location circle is concerned
with the location of the mobile charger, the service sector
with radius Rs , shown in Figure 1(b), is used to evaluate the
amount of power received by the cluster heads, which
influences the decision regarding the next optimal location
on the next location circle.
The interior angle of each service sector is the beam
width of the antenna, labeled as 2B; the bisector of the
interior angle connects the charger and an undercharged
cluster head. Therefore, the sector size increases as the
antenna gain decreases. In the case of an omni-directional
antenna, 2B is set to 360°.

SIMULATION RESULTS
For the simulation results, the number of sensor nodes to
be considered were set to be 100 and 200. The total size of
the area occupied by the sensor nodes was 100 x 100 meters.
Figure 2 shows the probability density function (PDF) for
the number of sensor nodes charged in the first stage
charging for 100 sensor nodes. The number of sensor nodes
charged in the first stage for 0 dB gain is much larger than
that number for 12 dB gain. This happens because the beam
width with 12 dB is much narrower, and the number of
sensor nodes that will also be charged during the charging of
the cluster heads is small, so the amount of energy needed by
the undercharged sensor nodes in the following stages will
be larger. For 0 dB, the beam width is omnidirectional, so
many sensor nodes will also be charged alongside the cluster
heads. Therefore, the number of sensor nodes that need to be
charged and the amount of energy necessary to charge them
will be significantly lower.
Figure 3 shows the PDF for the number of sensor nodes
charged after the second stage charging. In this case, it is
noticeable that there is a high probability that all sensor
nodes will be charged with the 6 dB antenna. The 6 dB
antenna appears to have the ideal tradeoff range value
between 12 dB and 0 dB. At 6 dB the antenna presents a
directional pattern, and so it will be able to focus on the
cluster heads and speed up the charging process; however,
because there is still a wide beam width angle for this
antenna, many of the clustered nodes will also be charged
during the charging of the cluster heads. To verify that this
trend is maintained for larger numbers of sensor nodes, a
sensor network with 200 nodes was simulated. Figure 4
shows that for 200 nodes the same trends continue, with the
difference that for 0 dB and 6 dB the probability is more
evenly spread out, providing the possibility of charging
larger numbers of sensor nodes. Figure 5 shows the PDF for
the second stage charging. For 200 nodes, it is shown in
Figure 5 that the trend of 6 dB having the best trade-off value
remains in place, with the only difference being that now the
probability of all of them being charged is lower, which is
understandable due to the higher number of sensor nodes in
the system.
V.
CONCLUSION
An alternative charging procedure for wireless sensor
networks was proposed. The procedure consisted in splitting
the charging time into stages so that a mobile charger could
focus on cluster head sensor nodes instead of on the whole

system, changing the assignments of cluster heads with
increases of energy in the system. The procedure was shown
to be able to charge sensors better by using a 6 dB gain
antenna, due to the tradeoff between beam width and
directional gain. The next steps will be to test the time and
energy expenditure incurred with this charging process and
compare those values with values of current models in the
literature.
