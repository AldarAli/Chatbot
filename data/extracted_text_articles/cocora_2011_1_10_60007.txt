Abstract—The paper is about performance evaluation of the IP 
Spectrum Aware Geographic routing protocol (IPSAG). 
IPSAG is an opportunistic cognitive routing protocol, which 
determines a source-destination route in a hop-by-hop manner, 
based on global and local information. Simulation results are 
reported for a particular case of IPSAG, where the cognitive 
radio (CR) nodes are uniformly distributed inside the cognitive 
radio network (CRN) and a two-dimensional random walk 
model is used to model the mobility of CR nodes. The results 
show that the IPSAG protocol is performing well in the case of 
a highly mobile CRN and that the source-destination path is 
successfully found in the majority of cases, especially when the 
network is highly populated.

INTRODUCTION 
Cognitive Radios (CR) have been suggested as a solution 
to the problem of scarce spectrum resource, by giving the 
possibility for the secondary users to use the licensed users 
channels sensed to be free. 
In relation to the existing wireless technologies, the CR 
technology has a revolutionary character by providing new 
functions. The most representative functions are: 
• 
Sensing function: the CR terminal is able to sense the 
entire environment and accordingly change the 
behavior. 
• 
Sharing function: the CR users must respect the primary 
users priority regarding the channel access and, at the 
same time, must be able to share the free channels with 
other CR users. 
The new features have a strong impact on the routing 
function. Due to the unstable nature of CRNs, regarding both 
node mobility and channel availability in time, a very 
dynamic routing protocol is needed. In this direction, 
especially when the channel availability period is much 
lower than the CR transmission duration, there is need for a 
totally opportunistic routing [1]. 
Today, a large number of suggested CR routing are based 
on existing routing algorithms for ad-hoc networks, adjusted 
to respond to CR demands. Most of the solutions are based 
on the Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector protocol 
(AODV), while limiting the broadcast area of the Route 
Request (RREQ) message [2]. 
Furthermore, in order to avoid the network flooding with 
control messages, source/destination based routing solutions 
are advanced. In this case, the needed information is 
obtained with the help of Common Control Channel (CCC) 
[1]. 
Along with the traditional factors (delay, interference, 
throughput), the routing metrics also include the fluctuation 
of the link availability. The vacant channels are selected 
based on probabilistic information [3] or by considering the 
switching frequency from one channel to another [4]. 
Within this context, the IP Spectrum Aware Geographic 
routing protocol (IPSAG) was advanced as a solution to 
routing in CRNs [5]. IPSAG uses the IP principle of step-by-
step forwarding with respect to the channel availability 
status, QoS features and CR node geographic positions. 
The paper evaluates the IPSAG behavior in different 
mobility conditions, from stationary to high CR mobile 
nodes. The CRN model is implemented and tested in Java. 
The rest of the paper is as follows. Section II describes 
the IPSAG protocol functionality. Section III presents the 
advanced CRN model to test IPSAG correctness. Sections IV 
and V provide the obtained results of IPSAG simulation in a 
one-cell and a seven-cells CRN, respectively. Section VI 
concludes the paper. 
II. 
IPSAG PROTOCOL DESCRIPTION 
The IPSAG protocol is a highly opportunistic protocol 
for CRN routing. IPSAG is inspired by the IP flexibility 
regarding the route selection process. The path is determined 
step-by-step according to a position-based approach, which 
also considers the channels availability and the Quality of 
Service (QoS) features. 
The characteristics of the protocol are as follows [5]: 
• 
The next-hop decision process is an individual one, 
taken by each CR node on the source-destination path. 
No previous determined route is used when forwarding 
the data packet. This is the basic concept of IP. 
• 
The spectrum opportunities of CR nodes are considered 
when constructing the step-by-step path: a link between 
two CR nodes can be part of the source-destination route 
if the corresponding CR nodes have at least one joint 
channel sensed to be free; i.e., IPSAG is a spectrum 
aware routing protocol.

• 
QoS elements in the form of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) 
are considered in determination of a channel between 
two arbitrary nodes. Hereby, a channel sensed to be free 
is allocated only if the channel has the SNR above a 
given threshold. 
• 
Geographical routing principles are used to reach the CR 
destination node. Given the CR neighbors with common 
spectrum opportunities (SOP) with QoS, the CR node 
selects the next-hop to be the one closest to the 
destination. 
The local decision process regarding the next-hop 
election is as follows (see Figure 1): 
• 
Each CR node determines its geographical neighbors 
inside a circle (with the node at the center and variable 
radius, usually selected to be equal with the transmission 
range). 
• 
Within the neighborhood, the CR node determines the 
neighbors with which it has common SOP (also 
satisfying the QoS demands); 
• 
The next-hop is the closest node to the destination 
between the pre-determined neighbors. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1.  IPSAG routing example [5] 
For instance, in Figure 1, the Source is running IPSAG 
inside its neighborhood and chooses node Int_1 as the next 
hop to forward the packet. Similarly, node Int_1 selects node 
Int_2, and Int_2 selects Int_3 to be the next-hops. Finally, 
node Int_3 determines that the destination is located in its 
neighborhood and forwards the packet [5]. 
III. 
SIMULATIONS MODELS 
In order to analyze the IPSAG performance for mobile 
CR nodes, a CRN model has been created in Java. The 
elements that provide the CRN simulation environment are: 
• 
Channel class, which models the primary radio channel. 
The channel is characterized by an availability status 
and a variable SNR. It also has an index based on which 
it is identified in the corresponding cell. In our 
simulations the channel status is considered to vary 
between “available/unavailable” with a probability of 
0.5 at each IPSAG iteration. 
• 
Cell class, which models the radio cell. This class 
extends the Polygon Java class and it is described by the 
set of radio channels that can be utilized on its area. 
Also, in each cell, the available radio channels at a given 
time, which correspond to a required SNR threshold, can 
be determined. 
• 
Node class, which models the CR node. Each node is 
able to determine and maintain a table with its 
neighbors, and it can choose the next-hop when running 
IPSAG. The neighborhood radius along which the node 
discovers its neighbors can be varied. The CR node can 
determine the cell in which it is located at a given time. 
It is identified by a global index in the CRN. Initially, 
the CR nodes are uniformly distributed along the 
network and each CR node moves across CRN 
according to the two-dimensional random walk model in 
a discrete manner [6]. At each IPSAG iteration, the CR 
node has the possibility to move with a probability of 
0.5 at left/right and up/down, respectively. The random 
walk implementation avoids the CR nodes exceeding the 
CRN perimeter. The case when a CR node crosses the 
border is not considered. 
• 
Network class, which models the CRN. The user can set 
the simulation parameters. These are: total number of 
CR nodes, number of cells that form the CRN, number 
of radio channels per cell, geographical dimensions of 
the radio cell, number of the channels belonging to the 
Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band used for 
inter-cells routing and the random-walk step where the 
nodes are moving. 
Two CRN models are used in our simulations, namely 
one cell CRN and seven cells CRN (see Figure 2). 
 
Figure 2.  The CRN models used in simulations 
In the first case, the IPSAG routing is used inside the 
cell. In the second case, the IPSAG routing is extended for 
inter-cells routing, with the difference that the channels are 
allocated from the ISM band. 
In all simulation cases we consider a number of 120 radio 
channels per cell. This corresponds to the spectrum 
reutilization scheme factor of N=3, for the 800 MHz band 
(62 carriers for each uplink/downlink communications 
direction) [7]. As mentioned above, the channel availability 
is varied at each IPSAG iteration with a 0.5 probability. 
Furthermore, the cell radius is considered to be 2 000 m, 
which is a common value.

IV. 
SIMULATIONS RESULTS – ONE CELL 
The IPSAG simulations focus on the probability to 
successfully find a source-destination route. Also, the 
probability of not finding the route from the first attempt is 
analyzed in different conditions. According to [8], this is the 
first 
performance 
criteria 
when 
evaluating 
a 
total 
opportunistic routing protocol. At the same time, the number 
of intermediary nodes between source and destination is 
observed. In this case, the results are reported with a 
confidence interval of 95 %. 
The parameters considered in the simulations are: 
• 
The random walk step, from the stationary case to a step 
value around the transmission range of 533 m [9]; 
• 
The number of CR nodes, which gives information about 
the manner in which IPSAG is performing in a 
poorly/highly populated CRN; 
• 
The neighborhood radius value of the circle, inside 
which a CR node determines its neighbors. 
Our results are as follows. 
A. Experiments regarding the random walk step 
For this simulation type, different movement situations 
are considered (random walk step values of 50, 100, 250, 
350 and 500 m, respectively) such as to analyze the influence 
on the IPSAG behavior. The number of CR nodes is 
maintained constant (100 nodes), a value that is very close to 
the number of radio channels (120). 
As we observe in Figure 3, the average number of 
intermediary nodes grows with the random walk step. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3.  The CR nodes random walk step influence on the number of 
intermediate nodes 
At the same time it can be observed that a higher value 
for the neighborhood radius decreases the number of 
intermediary nodes along the path. This is because a higher 
number of CR nodes means a higher number of next-hop 
candidates, influencing thus the optimum next-hop selection. 
We compare our protocol with two other CR protocols. 
These 
are 
Cognitive 
On-Demand 
Distance 
Vector 
(CAODV), which is an improvement of AODV protocol for 
CRN [10], and Opportunistic Service Differentiation 
Routing Protocol (OSDRP), which chooses the “minimum 
delay-maximum stability” route based on the channels 
availability issues [11]. The performance of these protocols 
has been observed to be similar to the IPSAG one cell case, 
for 100 CR nodes. Thus, if IPSAG gives an average hop 
count number of 2.5, respectively of 4 [see Figure 3], 
COADV offers an average hop count of 3.5/4 (see Figure 8 
in [10]) while OSDRP gives a total number of 3 to 8 
intermediary CR nodes (see Figure 4 in [11]), depending on 
the particular simulations parameters. 
An important advantage is that, in a highly mobile CRN, 
IPSAG has a larger probability to find the source-destination 
route from the first attempt compared with the stationary 
case (see Figure 4). In other words, regarding the path 
determination, IPSAG is performing better in a mobile 
environment than in a stationary case. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4.  Probability to find the source-destination route (533 m 
neighborhood radius) 
A small degradation in finding the path at the first 
attempt is observed when decreasing the neighborhood 
radius. However, this still has a better behavior at a high 
random-walk steps (see Figure 5). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5.  Probability to find the source-destination route (450 m 
neighborhood radius) 
These results show therefore that IPSAG is performing 
very well in the case of mobile CR nodes. The neighborhood 
radius value can however diminish the performance at lower 
values or improve it at higher values, which are approaching 
the transmission range. 
B. Experiments regarding the number of CR nodes

simulations the number of CR nodes was maintained 
constant, but in this case it varies between 50 and 200. Also, 
the neighborhood radius is preserved at an optimum value, 
represented by the transmission range (533 m). 
The simulation results show that, in a highly populated 
network, IPSAG is behaving better than in a poorly 
populated CRN. As it can be observed in Figure 6, the 
average number of intermediary nodes is bigger when there 
are only few CR nodes inside CRN. The simulation results 
confirm the previous results according to which the average 
number increases with the random walk step (see Figure 2). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 6.  The number of CR nodes influence on the average number of 
intermediate nodes in the source-destination path 
The probability of finding the route from the first attempt 
is approximately maximum when the CRN is very populated, 
and significantly decreases (0.7) for a lower number of CR 
nodes (see Figure 7). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 7.  Probability of finding the source-destination route (random walk 
step 100 m) 
The probability of successfully finding the route is 
considerably low when the CR numbers and the random 
walk step have small values. The worse case scenario is 
considered for 50 CR nodes and a random walk step of 100 
m, when this probability is going to be approximately 0.6 
(see Figure 7). When the CR nodes are stationary, this 
probability becomes lower than 0.6. 
This decrease is however improved in a highly mobile 
environment (see Figure 8). If, at a 100 m value for the 
random walk step, the probability to find the route at the first 
attempt is around 0.7, for a 250 m step this probability 
increases at 0.8. This result confirms the good performance 
of IPSAG in a highly mobile network. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 8.  Probability of finding the source-destination route (random walk 
step 250 m) 
Thus, the results clearly show that a populated CRN 
improves the IPSAG performance. 
V. 
SIMULATIONS RESULTS – SEVEN CELLS CLUSTER 
The conditions considered in Section 4 remain valid. A 
number of 120 radio channels and a cell radius of 2000 m, 
respectively, are maintained for each cell. Also, the average 
number of intermediary nodes along the path and the 
probability to successfully find the route are considered in 
evaluating IPSAG. In addition, the average number of inter-
cells routing is analyzed. 
A. Experiments regarding the random walk step 
The average number of intermediary nodes between the 
source and destination increases with the growth of the 
random walk step. A lower neighborhood radius value also 
increases this parameter (see Figure 9). This is because, in a 
highly mobile environment, the IPSAG geographical 
selection of the next-hop (closest neighbor to the destination) 
does not have the accuracy of the stationary case.

number of intermediary nodes on the path, but with a 
smaller dependence (see Figure 10). The low dependence 
can be explained by the fact that the next-hop is determined 
at each IPSAG iteration while an inter-cell routing step is 
done only when the destination is located in another cell. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 10.  The influence of the step of random walk on the average 
number of inter-cell routing steps 
As it can be observed in Figure 11, the probability of 
finding the route from the first attempt is good, with the 
remark that, relative to the one-cell CRN instance, it presents 
a higher variability. Also, the good behavior of IPSAG for 
high mobility is maintained. This is because, when CRN is 
very dynamic, the current node always has neighbors that 
satisfy the IPSAG conditions. The price is in form of a 
longer route, given that the number of intermediary nodes 
increases with the mobility degree. 
When the neighborhood radius is reduced, the number of 
neighbors for a given CR node is also reduced and thus, the 
probability of finding the route at the first attempt decreases. 
Furthermore, the tentative number for successfully finding 
the route increases (see Figure 12).

The simulations show therefore that IPSAG is 
performing well in a high mobility environment, even when 
the CRN area is broader, with a perceptible deterioration 
when the neighborhood radius is decreased. 
B. Experiments regarding the number of CR nodes 
In this experiments set the neighborhood radius is 
maintained constant (533 m). 
As showed in the one-cell CRN case, the increase of the 
CR nodes number inside the CRN improves the IPSAG 
performance. When the CRN grows from one cell to a seven 
cells area, the number of intermediary nodes suffers a 2/3 
orders increase (see Figure 13). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 13.  The influence of the number of CR nodes on the average 
number of intermediate nodes on the source-destination path 
Note. Given that the CR nodes are uniformly distributed 
along the CRN area and they are moving according to the 
random walk model, the number of CR nodes may be 
different from one cell to another. This is the reason of using 
the parameter “average number of CR nodes per cell”. 
As expected, a similar behavior shows the average 
number of inter-cell routing steps with the CR nodes density 
growth. As shown in Figure 14, this parameter decreases 
with the increase of the random walk step, which implies a 
short path.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The paper has focused on evaluating the performance of 
IPSAG – a new suggested CR routing protocol. 
A simple CRN simulator has been developed in Java. 
The experiments have focused on the IPSAG performance in 
different mobility conditions. In this respect, a two 
dimensional random walk model was implemented for the 
CR nodes. 
The simulation results showed that IPSAG is well 
performing at high random walk steps. The path was 
successfully found in the majority of cases from the first 
attempt, with the drawback of a longer route in terms of 
intermediary nodes between source and destination. Also, it 
was observed that the IPSAG performance improves in a 
high populated network and diminishes through the 
neighborhood radius decrease below the transmission range. 
The conclusion is therefore that IPSAG responds very 
well to the CRN highly dynamism. This good behavior can 
be explained by the total opportunistic character of the 
protocol in finding the path. 
The future work will focus on the IPSAG performance in 
large areas, by splitting the network into clusters.
