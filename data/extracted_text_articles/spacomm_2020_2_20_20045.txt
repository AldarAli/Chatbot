Abstract‚ÄîMulti-beam satellites have the potential to offer 
high capacity with frequency reuse among different beams. 
Recently, more radical frequency reuse strategy or even full 
frequency reuse has been adopted to further improve the system 
capacity, leading to high co-frequency interference between 
adjacent beams. Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) is 
normally used to deal with the interference. In this paper, we 
propose an optimized SIC algorithm by user grouping and 
sorting to cancel the interference in a better way. Simulation 
results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the bit 
error rate performance compared with the classic SIC 
algorithm. 
Keywords‚Äîsatellite communication; multi-beam satellite;

I. INTRODUCTION  
A multi-beam satellite is defined as a satellite using multi-
point beam and frequency reuse techniques. With the same 
spectrum resources, the capacity of the satellite is several 
times that of the traditional satellite [1]. When the frequency 
reuse scheme is more radical, e.g., full frequency reuse, 
serious interference will be generated between the beams, and 
interference cancellation is needed to reduce the impact of 
interference on the system performance. In the literature, 
Multiuser Detection (MUD) techniques based on Successive 
interference cancellation (SIC) are usually adopted in the 
reverse link to combat the interference. 
In [2], MUD is proved to be an effective solution to 
maximize the capacity of multi-beam satellite system. A good 
review and evaluation of various MUD techniques for 
broadband multi-beam satellite systems is provided in [3]. It 
has been shown that the capacity of current multi-beam 
satellite systems is greatly affected by inter-beam interference, 
which calls for efficient advanced signal processing 
techniques to overcome the interference. 
In [4], the physical layer performance achievable by a 
specific algorithm using MUD is evaluated. The results 
indicate that detecting by two users may be sufficient to 
greatly improve the spectral efficiency of the link. The authors 
in [5] analyzed two basic techniques for MUD: theoretically 
optimal Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection and sub-
optimal Minimum Mean-Squared Error (MMSE) detection. 
The performance of theoretically optimal ML detection is very 
close to the theoretical single-user limit. As the number of 
users increases, the performance decreases. For a small 
number of users, MMSE detection performs very close to ML.  
When the number of users increases, the performance will 
drop significantly. 
A hybrid QR decomposition with Malgorithm  Maximum 
Likelihood Detection (QRM-MLD) MMSE-SIC adaptive 
MUD algorithm is proposed in [6]. In contrast to the optimal 
ML method,  QRM-MLD significantly reduces the 
complexity. A tradeoff between complexity and performance 
is achieved and the performance is compared with the hybrid 
ML-MMSE-SIC scheme. 
In this paper,  the traditional SIC algorithm is optimized in 
two aspects, which can improve the Bit Error Rate (BER) 
performance. First, the received signals are sorted by strength 
before SIC, then the detection is performed in descending 
order of signal strength. Second, the satellite beams are 
grouped. In the process of decoding, parallel and serial 
interference detection are mixed to obtain better performance. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II 
provides the system model of the multi-beam satellite system. 
The classical SIC algorithm is introduced and analyzed in 
Section III. Two improved SIC algorithms are proposed in 
Section IV. Simulation results are given in Section V. The 
conclusions follow in Section VI. 
II. SYSTEM MODEL 
In this paper, we consider a multi-beam satellite system 
and focus on the reverse link of the system. Assume the 
system is based on TDMA, where K users on the ground send 
data in the same frequency band in the same time slot. In this 
situation, K ground terminals can be regarded as K 
transmitting end antennas and the satellite receives signals 
from multiple users in the coverage area of multiple beams. 
Denote by sj the signal transmitted by user j and hij the 
channel coefficient between user j and beam i , the reveiced

III. CLASSIC SUCCESSIVE INTERFERENCE 
CANCELLATION ALGORITHM 
The basic principle of SIC is to reconstruct the 
successfully decoded signal and eliminate the interference of 
the signal from the received signal. The SIC detector detects 
the signals from multiple transmitters through various 
algorithms. Once a signal is detected, the signal is multiplied 
by the corresponding column in the channel coefficient matrix, 
and then the value is subtracted from the original received 
signal. In this way, the Multiple Access Interference (MAI) 
caused by the signal is eliminated. Recursing this process, the 
MAI can be completely eliminated. The performance of the 
SIC is greatly improved compared with the traditional detector, 
and the hardware is not changed much, so it is easy to 
implement. The SIC algorithm is shown in Figure 1.

At the satellite receiving side, since the received signal is 
the sum of signals transmitted from users in multiple co-
frequency beams, if the signal cannot be distinguished, the 
useful information cannot be identified. The SIC detector can 
first make decision on the strongest signal and obtain its 
estimated value. If there are N transmitted signals, the multiple 
access interference cancellation can be performed on other N-
1 users in the following stage of detection, that is, the 
interference caused by the decoded signal is eliminated. It can 
be seen that the larger the number of detection stages, the 
better the multiple access interference will be eliminated. 
According to the detection algorithm, successive 
interference cancellation can be divided into ZF-SIC and 
MMSE-SIC. Both the ZF algorithm and the MMSE algorithm 
are linear detection algorithms. Their basic principle is to 
multiply the received signal vector by the filter matrix G to 
obtain an estimate from which the final solution vector can be 
determined. There are two different benchmarks when 
calculating the filter matrix, so the linear detection algorithm 
can be divided into (ZF) algorithm and minimum mean square 
error (MMSE) algorithm. 
The filter matrix of the ZF algorithm and the MMSE 
algorithm are:

The Zero-forcing (ZF) algorithm is simple to implement 
and has low computational complexity. However, during the 
detection process, the noise is amplified by multiplication with 
the pseudo-inverse matrix, which greatly degrades the 
detection performance. The MMSE algorithm takes into 
account the amplification effect of noise when designing the 
filter matrix. Therefore, its performance is improved 
compared to the ZF algorithm, but its computational 
complexity is also relatively high. The successive interference 
cancellation detection algorithm is performed on users one by 
one, so the SIC algorithm involves the problem of user 
detecting order. For the SIC algorithm, the detection order is 
worth further researching. 
IV. OPTIMIZED SUCCESSIVE INTERFERENCE 
CANCELLATION ALGORITHM 
The problem with SIC is that the interference cancellation 
can only be performed in the order of the transmitting 
antennas, and the interference intensity caused by the previous 
signals is not necessarily the largest. When the strongest signal 
is detected at the end of the detection sequence, the 
progressive interference cancellation effect will be very 
limited. Moreover, if strong interference cannot be eliminated 
in advance, it may also have a bad influence on the bit error 
rate performance of the entire system. Based on this, we 
propose an Optimized Successive Interference Cancellation 
algorithm (Optimized SIC). 
A. Optimized successive interference cancellation 
algorithm based on column norm sorting 
The sorted successive interference cancellation algorithm 
can improve the performance of the detection algorithm, 
improve the accuracy of signal detection, reduce error 
propagation, and does not significantly increase the 
complexity. 
In a multi-beam satellite communication system, the 
proportion of the signal transmitted by the ground user i in the 
received signal is proportional to the column norm 
corresponding to the channel coefficient matrix, and thus is 
ordered according to the column norm size. The larger the 
column norm, the higher the detection priority, so we only

need to calculate the K-th column norm. The algorithm is as 
follows:

Here, the transmitted symbol of the user i is detected and 
a hard decision is made. The detection process uses ZF or 
MMSE detection to obtain ZF-OSIC and MMSE-OSIC 
detection algorithms. The filtered pseudo-inverse matrix G(i)

matrix H(i) to get H(i+1) and updates i=i+1. 
B. Column Norm Sorting Group Multi-Order Successive 
Interference Cancellation Algorithm (GOSIC) 
When the number of users is too large, the multi-beam 
satellite communication system needs to process multiple user 
data, the system complexity of the successive interference 
cancellation cannot be ignored. The concept of grouping is 
introduced on the basis of column norm sorting. Grouping 
based successive interference cancellation divides the entire 
coverage area into multiple detection groups with a certain 
spatial isolation by grouping multiple users according to their 
separated distance. Considering the uplink of the multi-beam 
satellite communication system, the coverage pattern of the 
system is illustrated in Figure 2.

Considering the proposed SIC algorithm based on column 
norm sorting, we introduce multi-level detection using the 
concept of grouping. Parallel and successive detection are 
combined in the decoding process to obtain better BER 
performance. 
Due to the directivity of the multi-beam satellite antenna, 
the interference between the beams with large distance is 
small. Taking the beam cluster in Figure 2. as an example, the 
received signal of beam i can be expressed as:

When considering 7-beam coverage, beam 1 and beam 7 
are very far apart, so the interference between them is small. 
Therefore, the interference of the user 7 to user 1 can be 
regarded as noise. Then, the computational complexity of the 
detector can be simplified. Based on the above thoughts, the 
seven spot beams in Figure 2. are grouped according to the 
detection order. The following grouping results are obtained 
to make the interference between groups relatively small:

Figure 3. Schematic diagram of multi-stage MMSE-GOSIC algorithm 
It can be seen from Figure 2 that users in the second group 
cause relatively stronger interference to users in the first and 
third groups. So in the simulation, we first perform 
interference cancellation on the second group of users, and 
first make decision on the second group of signals through the 
original signal. Then, interference cancellation is performed 
on the first and the third group based on the signal obtained 
from the hard decision results of the second group and the 
original signal. In this way, the estimated signals of the first 
and the third group without interference are obtained. Next, 
the signals of the second group is re-decoded using the 
interference-free signals of the first and the third group. Figure 
3 shows the block diagram of the algorithm structure. 
The estimated signals of the second group are first 
obtained by the original received signal y by performing 
column norm sorting successive interference cancellation the

‚àÜy3 and ‚àÜy1 in the equations (16) and (17) represent 
mutual interference of transmitted symbols between the third 
group and the first group. However, since the distance 
between the third group and the first group is far apart, ‚àÜy3 
and ‚àÜy1 can be regarded as noise in the respective received 
signals, respectively, and the receiving algorithm can be 
simplified. Finally, by eliminating the third group and the first 
group of received signals ùë¶ÃÖ1 and  ùë¶ÃÖ3  of the signal interference 
of ùë•ÃÖ2 , ùë•ÃÖ3 and  ùë•ÃÖ1  can be respectively estimated by the 
successive interference cancellation algorithm that performs 
the intra-group norm sorting.

Where H11 represents the row corresponding to the first 
group of users in the channel matrix and the column 
corresponding to the first group of beams. Since the 
interference caused by ùë•ÃÖ2 has been eliminated, the transmitted 
signals of the second group of users are not considered for the 
beams in the first group. It has been previously specified that 
the transmitted signal from the third group of users is 
considered to be noise. So for signals 1 and 2 in group 1, the 
specified channel matrix H7;1,2 will be reduced to the first 
group H1,2;1,2. That is, H11 above. 
In (16) and (17), we consider ‚àÜy3 and ‚àÜy1 to be noise in 
order to simplify the reception signals of the third and the first 
group. At the same time, we ignore the estimation error of ùë•ÃÖ2. 
This will affect the performance of the algorithm, so we 
introduce the concept of multi-stage detection. We will use the 
estimated signals of the third and the first group in the first 
stage and the original received data to perform a second-stage 
detection on the estimation signals sent by the users in the 
second group, and update ùë•ÃÖ2:

point, all transmitted symbols complete the second-order 
detection. 
V. SIMULATION 
In this paper, the successive interference cancellation 
technique of multi-beam satellite reverse link is studied. The 
multi-beam satellite system model is established according to 
the diagram in section 2. Considering the seven spot beams in 
the cluster and adopting TDMA access, the performance of 
the algorithm studied in this paper is evaluated by comparing 
simulation with the classical SIC.

Therefore, the scenario of multi-beam satellite reverse link 
is established. The various parameters of multi-beam satellite 
reverse link simulated by SIC algorithm are shown in Table 1.  
 
Figure 4. Bit error rate of ZF-OSIC/MMSE-OSIC detection algorithm 
Figure 4. shows the bit error rate simulation of the classical 
linear detection ZF algorithm, MMSE algorithm, nonlinear 
detection ZF-SIC algorithm, MMSE-SIC algorithm and the 
optimized interference cancellation algorithm based on 
column norm sorting. 
It can be seen from the Figure 4. that the performance of 
the MMSE algorithm is significantly better than the ZF 
algorithm at low SNR. This is because the noise is amplified 
by multiplying the pseudo-inverse matrix in the detection 
process in ZF algorithm, resulting in a poor performance. On 
the contrary, the MMSE algorithm takes the problem of noise 
into account. When the SNR value is high, the influence of 
noise becomes small, and the performance of the two linear 
detection algorithms is close. Combining SIC, the bit error rate 
of both ZF and MMSE is significantly reduced and the 
performance is significantly improved. This is because SIC 
algorithm is an iterative process. After each iteration, a signal 
is detected and eliminated to reduce the impact on subsequent 
signal detection. With the increase of SNR, the bit error rate 
of the six algorithms tend to decline, but the bit error rate of 
the OSIC algorithm drops the fastest. When the SNR value is 
high, the bit error rates of the six algorithms are obviously

divided into three groups. The linear detection algorithm has 
the highest bit error rate, the SIC algorithm has the second bit 
error rate, and the OSIC algorithm has the lowest bit error rate. 
This is because the received signals are sorted according to the 
column norm before the detection so that the strong signal is 
first detected and cancelled. Compared with the disordered 
SIC algorithm, the OSIC can eliminate the interference to a 
greater extent. Therefore, the bit error rate of the OSIC 
algorithm is significantly lower than the bit error rate of the 
SIC algorithm.  
Figure 5. adopts the concept of grouping and multi-stage. 
Combined with the MMSE multi-user detection algorithm 
based on the column norm sorting, the MMSE-GOSIC 
algorithm is close to the bit error rate of the MMSE algorithm 
at low SNR. As the SNR increases, the bit error rate of the 
MMSE-GOSIC algorithm decreases rapidly, and its 
advantages gradually emerge. At high SNR, the bit error rate 
of the MMSE-GOSIC algorithm is the lowest compared to 
other algorithms, and its performance is better than other 
algorithms.

VI. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, the SIC algorithm of the multi-beam satellite 
system is simulated by establishing a multi-beam satellite 
reverse link. By investigating advantages and disadvantages 
of the SIC algorithm and the multi-beam satellite system, two 
optimization algorithms are proposed. A successive 
interference cancellation detection algorithm based on column 
norm sorting is proposed. Then, considering the high 
complexity as the number of user increases, the concept of 
grouping is proposed. The combination of grouping 
successive detection and multi-stage detection is used to 
reduce the complexity of the satellite side algorithm while 
ensuring accuracy. The simulation proves that the satellite 
MMSE multi-stage MUD algorithm based on the column 
norm sorting can achieve excellent performance compared 
with traditional SIC based detector. In the future, we will 
evaluate the proposed algorithm under the environments with 
rain fading.
