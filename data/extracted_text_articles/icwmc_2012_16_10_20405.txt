to project and make the extensive distributed multipurpose
automatic control systems with complicated control algorithms
and to automate the process of picking up and centralized data
processing. But, solving this problem requires the use of small

Section
"Data
acquisition
systems"
is
devoted
to
reviewing the available data collection systems. In the
"Wireless module ”, we consider the design features of the
wireless module for data collection. On the basis of the
developed theory, we lead a experimental research that is
given in Section "Testing".

DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEMS
Data acquisition systems may be used in the real-time
regime, for instance, for monitoring different process,
emergency
conditions
identification
in
technological
systems, for management, and also for data archiving, when
they are separated from the processing procedures for the
collection during a time interval. In the real-time systems,
current data save in circular buffer, while older data displace
the new date, during the current time. Information tank of
greater capacity is used in archive systems, and data is
processed after data acquisition completion.
Archive data acquisition systems (loggers, recorders)
may
be
self-contained
unit,
constructed
on
base
of
microcontroller, for instance, airborne recorder, electronic
counter
of
heat
or
electric
power,
portable
electrocardiograph). Data collected by loggers is transferred
to processing to computer with help, for instance, of a USB
flash memory or through serial port. Archive data acquisition
systems (loggers, recorders) may be self-contained unit,
constructed on base of microcontroller, for instance, airborne
recorder, electronic counter of heat or electric power,
portable electrocardiograph). Data collected by loggers is
transferred to processing to computer with help, for instance,
USB flash memory or through serial port.
A data acquisition systems constructed on the basis of
computer allow collecting and processing data at the same
place and often with the help of the same software. This is
the most widespread version of such systems performance.
The wide possibilities for collecting and processing data are
presented by MatLab, LabView, MS Excel.
Systems with parallel bus, including PCI-cards, are used
for fast processes registration (with required sampling rate
more than 1 MHz). Computer boards have limited number of
input, defined by constructional specification, and require
external terminal block for connection of signal source,
which is inconvenient at mounting system.
External devices connecting to computer with such ports
as СОМ, USB or Ethernet are more convenient for slow
process registration. External devices are different by less
noise, while the card inserted into a PC, are influenced by
interference from the computer's digital circuits.
Data acquisition systems may be distributed, when
devices input block is separated on Data acquisition object
territorially, and receiving data collect to one storage and
data transfer with help of network technologies (Ethernet,
Modbus, Profibus, DeviceNet, CANopen, DCON and others,
wireless
network
Bluetooth,
Wi-Fi,
ZigBee,
Internet
technology, intranet). Distributed data acquisition allows
particular uncounted increasing number of inputs channel;
however it is restricted by network date rate. Data acquisition

Distributed
data
acquisition
systems
allow
particular
uncounted increasing number of inputs channel; however it
is restricted by network date rate.
Data acquisition systems input may be universal (current,
inductive and potential) and specialized ( for instance, for
thermocouple, thermoelement resistance or tensormeter).
System with specialized input is economically effective to
user. Universal input uses together with measurement
converter of physical value to current and voltage. There are
system with hybrid input, for instance, when one input
received the thermocouple signal, other input – tensormeter
signal, third - thermoelement resistance and etc.)
Inputs may be differential, single or digital. Differential
input allow more effectively suppress internal noise inducing
to cable transmitted signal from detecting device to input
module. Voltage in the range ±(0...5), ±(0...10) V or current
in the range of 0..20, 4...20 mA is used the data transmission.
Voltage signals is worked out by voltage source and have the
high noise immunity to capacitive pickup; current signal is
worked out by current source and stable to inductive pickup.
Digital inputs receive logical signals (“0” or “1”) arrived
from
limit
switch,
intruder
or
fire
alarm
sensor,
electromagnetic relay, voltage presence sensor and etc [1].
The major settings of data acquisition systems are
channels
number,
inaccuracy,
dynamical
inaccuracy,
establishing time or pass band, resolving power, effective
digit count, sampling rate, galvanic input and interface
isolation availability, availability of defense of careless
usage, overload and overheating.
Generally data acquisition systems have 4, 8, 16, 32, 64
... input, inquired by turn or simultaneously. System with
simultaneous inquiry is consist of identical channel, which is
done the analog-digital conversion of input value at the same
time for all channels. Such system is uncommon due to
expensive cost. Generally input inquiry performs in turn with
help of commutator. Therefore different channels data is
shift to time on the delay equal to relations of inquiry time to
channels quantity [2].

WIRELESS MODULE
There is a few variant of data acquisition systems in the
radio technical monitoring center North (Arctic) federal
university named after M.V. Lomonosov.
As
a
mentioned
above
at
the
present
stage
of
development
various
measuring
and
executive devices
(meters, sensors, actuators, etc.) are widely used and these
devices are increasingly equipped with one of the standard
interfaces such as USART (RS232), SPI, 1 - Wire, I2C, and
etc. The fact is given opportunity to project and make the
extensive distributed multipurpose automatic control system
with complicated control algorithms and to automate the
process of picking up and centralized data processing. But to
solve this problem requires the use of small low-cost
embedded microcontroller systems as buffer management, as
well as GSM and Wi-Fi modules for the organization of a
communication
channel
with
the
data
collection
and
processing center. The use of microcontrollers as the buffer
allows for some level of required operations to produce and
primary processing of data and prepared directly at the
control point. In our case, a system based on high-quality
GSM modules manufactured with built-in powerful Telit
ARM microcontroller and the virtual machine interpreter a
powerful Python. In addition to a sufficiently powerful
processing core, this module is implemented by hardware
support 2 USART interfaces and one SPI, as well as a
number of universal input-output ports for user purposes.
The solution allows to have available a flexible system with
a powerful and versatile scripting language. But the use of
GSM channel is mainly justified when applied to mobile and
very distant objects. When used on most real-world objects
and within the city limits in most cases it is more efficient
use of wireless communication channel based on the Wi-Fi
technology as in this case is easier and cheaper to hold a
LAN to a monitored object and do not pay for the services of
mobile operators GSM / GPRS bands. In the result of led
researching-constructive works the system presented on
follows figure is worked out.
The general system operation principle is displayed in the
picture in general (Fig. 1). Seen from the figure that the
system can adapt itself to a wide range of tasks, changing
only the software on the server, data collection terminals to
client management, and scripts embedded microcontroller,
without replacing the hardware system. In this case, the user
can select the most appropriate for him the connection
channel.
The implemented the center module is constructed using
GSM processor Telit GL865-Dual and Wi-Fi module
SM2144N2 (Fig. 2).
As an analogue of our module considers the following
devices: TWCT20 [3], Cinterion DSB75 [4], AirLink
GL6100
[5].
Considered
analogues
have
similar
characteristics,
but
have,
in
our
view,
a
number
of
disadvantages: impossibility reprogram and change the
settings
of
the
driver
remotely.
Usually
the
remote
parameters change function is supported only; a supported
interface type (RS232).
We have tried to correct the disadvantages of the data.
Our module is:

As part of the total data collection system can not
only change the remote settings of the device, but
also the change of the remote driver to work with
different types of devices. Changing the driver can
happen automatically, without human intervention;

It supports not only the interface RS232, but also
widespread in industry interface CAN;

There is an additional +5 V power supply output for
powering external sensors or, if necessary, power
interfaces, plug-ins.
IV.
TESTING
As the unit tests were analyzed levels of the signal
module and 3G modem (Huawei E173) in the frequencies of
the network GSM. The measurements were performed using
the same SIM-card and the investigation object were placed
in the same point-space by rotation. Measuring levels the
signals was carried out in automatic mode with the help of
the same the software (the script in Python, runs with the
object at the level of AT commands) in order to exclude the
human factor. Measurements were carried out within 10
minutes with an interval of 10 seconds. The results are
shown in the graph (Fig.3).
As seen from the results, our module has a higher level
signal from a base station, which allows for higher rate data
transfer.

CONCLUSIONS
System can adapt itself to a wide range of tasks, changing
only the software on the server, data collection terminals to
client management, and scripts embedded microcontroller,
without replacing the hardware system. In this case, the user
can select the most appropriate for him the connection
channel.
