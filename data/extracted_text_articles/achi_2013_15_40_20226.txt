Abstract— Recently in HCI research, emotion recognition is 
one of the core processes to implement emotional intelligence. 
There are many studies using physiological signals in order to 
recognize human emotions. The purpose of this study is to 
recognize emotions using autonomic nervous system responses 
induced by three different emotions (boredom, pain and 
surprise). Three different emotional states are evoked by 
emotional stimuli, physiological signals (EDA, ECG, PPG and 
SKT) for the induced emotions are measured as the reactions 
of stimuli, and 27 features are extracted from their 
physiological signals for emotion recognition. The stimuli are 
used to provoke emotions and tested their appropriateness and 
effectiveness. Audio-visual film clips used as stimuli are 
captured originally from movies, documentary, and TV shows 
with the appropriateness of 86%, 97.3% and 94.1% for 
boredom, pain and surprise, respectively, and the effectiveness 
of 5.23 for happiness, 4.96 for pain and 6.12 for surprise (7 
point Likert scale). Also, for the three emotion recognition, we 
propose a Fuzzy c-means clustering based neural networks 
using the physiological signals. The proposed model consists of 
three layers, namely, input, hidden and output layers. Here, 
fuzzy c-means clustering method, two types of polynomial and 
linear combination function are used as a kernel function in 
the input layer, the hidden layer and the output layer of neural 
networks, respectively. To evaluate the performance of 
emotion recognition of the proposed model, we use the 10-fold 
cross validation and a comparative analysis shows that the 
proposed model exhibit higher accuracy when compared with 
some other models that exist in the literature.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Emotion recognition in human-computer interaction 
(HCI) studies is the one of topic that researcher are most 
interested in. To recognize human's emotions and feelings, 
various physiological signals have been widely used to 
classify emotion [1] because signal acquisition by non-
invasive sensors is relatively simple and physiological 
responses induced by emotion are less sensitive in social and 
cultural difference [2]. Physiological signal may happen to 
artifact due to motion, and have difficulty mapping emotion-
specific responses pattern, but this has some advantages 
which are less affected by environment than any other 
modalities as well as possible to observe user’s state in real 
time. In addition, they also can be acquired spontaneous 
emotional responses and not caused by responses to social 
masking 
or 
factitious 
emotion 
expressions. 
Finally, 
measurements of emotional responses by multi-channel 
physiological signals offer more information for emotion 
recognition, because physiological responses are related to 
emotional state [3]. Various physiological signals offer a 
great potential for the recognition of emotions in computer 
systems, in order to fully exploit the advantages of 
physiological measures, standardizations of experimental 
methods have to be established on the emotional model, 
stimulus used for the identification of physiological patterns, 
physiological measures, parameters for analysis, and model 
for pattern recognition and classification [4]. 
The objective of this study is to achieve emotion dataset 
including physiological signals for three emotions (boredom, 
pain and surprise) induced by emotional stimuli and to 
develop a recognizer based on neural networks, namely, 
fuzzy c-means clustering based neural networks. 
To induce boredom, pain and surprise emotions, we use 
audio-visual film clip captured originally from movies, 
documentary, and TV shows. Electrodermal activity (EDA), 
skin temperature (SKT), electrocardiac activity (ECG) and 
photoplethysmography (PPG) are recorded from 200 
undergraduate students; during they are exposed to visual-
acoustic emotional stimuli. And participants classified their 
present emotion and assessed its intensity on the emotion 
assessment scale. As the results of emotional stimulus 
evaluation, emotional stimuli were shown to mean 92.5% of 
appropriateness and 5.43 of effectiveness; this means that 
each emotional stimulus caused its own emotion quite 
effectively. Also, 27 features are extracted from their 
physiological signals for emotion recognition. 
In order to recognize three emotions, we propose a fuzzy 
c-means clustering based neural networks (FNN) with 
polynomial function as a new methodology of emotion 
recognizer. Neural networks (NNs) have been widely used to 
deal with pattern recognition problems. It has been shown 
that the NNs can be trained to approximate complex 
discriminant functions [5]. NN classifiers can deal with 
numerous multivariable nonlinear problems for which an

accurate analytical solution is difficult to derive or does not 
exist [6]. It is found however, that the quality and 
effectiveness of NN classifiers depend on several essential 
parameters whose values are crucial to the accurate 
predictions of the properties being sought. The appropriate 
NN architecture, the number of hidden layers and the 
number of neurons in each hidden layer are the important 
design issues that can immediately affect the accuracy of the 
prediction. Unfortunately, there is no direct method to 
identify these factors as they need to be determined on an 
experimental basis [6]. In addition, it is difficult to 
understand and interpret the resulting NNs. These difficulties 
increase once the number of variables and the size of the 
networks start to increase [7][8]. To alleviate the problems 
highlighted above, we propose to consider fuzzy c-means 
clustering based neural networks (FNN) with polynomial 
function exploiting a direct usage of Fuzzy C-Means 
clustering and involving polynomials in the description of 
relationships of the models. The proposed FNN model 
consists of three layers, namely, input, hidden and output 
layers. A neuron in input layer employs fuzzy c-means 
clustering method as a kernel function, namely, this layer 
relates to the partition function of input space using FCM 
clustering. Two types of polynomial and linear combination 
of input signals are used as a kernel function of a neuron in 
the hidden layer and the output layer of neural networks, 
respectively. Using two types of polynomial functions can 
help to improve the characteristic of basic neural networks 
recognizer and caries out the presentation of a partitioned 
local space. The proposed FNN recognizer generates a 
nonlinear discernment function in the output space and has 
the better performance of emotion recognition. The proposed 
recognizer is applied to the obtained emotional physiological 
signals with 27 features and its results are compared with 
performance of C4.5, SOM (Self-organizing map), Naïve 
Bayes and SVM (support vector machines) [9]-[13]. The 
study is organized as follows. In Section II, we discuss 
emotion stimuli and measurements of physiological signals 
obtained as autonomic nervous system responses by three 
emotions. A structure of the proposed FNN is presented with 
an overall description of a detailed design methodology in 
Section III. In Section IV, we report on results of emotion 
recognition for the proposed FNN and conventional models. 
Finally, concluding remarks are covered in Section V. 
II. 
EMOTIONS AND AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM 
RESPONSES 
This section reports a presentation of emotional stimuli 
and the measurements of physiological signals of autonomic 
nervous system responses for boredom, pain and surprise 
emotions 
A. Subjects 
In this experiment, 200 college students (mean age: 21.7 
± 2.3 years) have participated. They have reported no history 
of medical illness due to heart disease, respiration, or central 
nervous system disorder or psychotropic medication. They 
were introduced to the experiment protocols and filled out a 
written consent before the beginning of experiment. Also, 
they were paid $30 USD per session to compensate for their 
participation. 
B. Emotional Stimuli 
For the three emotions, emotional stimuli are selected the 
2-4 min long audio-visual film clips, which are captured 
originally from movies and TV shows, and provoking pain. 
Figure 1 is the example of emotional stimuli using audio-
visual film clips. The stimulus, which provokes pain, is that 
it’s the more pressure an experimenter put on it after wearing 
a blood pressure cuff on subjects’ arm during 1 minute. The 
boring stimulus is the combination a presentation of “+” 
symbol on screen and a repetitive sound of number from 1 to 
10 during 3 minutes. The surprise provoking stimulus is the 
sudden presentation of above images and hog-caller, sound 
of breaking glass, and thunder during concentration on task 
during 1 minute. Audio-visual film clips have widely used 
because these have the desirable properties of being readily 
standardized, involving no deception, and being dynamic 
rather than static. They also have a relatively high degree of 
ecological validity, in so far as emotions are often evoked by 
dynamic visual and auditory stimuli that are external to the 
individual [14]-[17]. 
The audio-visual film clips have been used to provoke 
emotion and tested their appropriateness and effectiveness. 
The appropriateness of emotional stimuli means a 
consistency between the intended emotion by experimenter 
and the participants’ experienced emotion. The effectiveness 
is an intensity of emotions that participants rated on a 1 to 7 
point Likert-type scale, that is, 1 being “least boring” and 7 
being “most boring”. The appropriateness and effectiveness 
of these stimuli were as follows; appropriateness and 
effectiveness of boredom were 86.0% and 5.23±1.36, in pain 
97.3% appropriateness and 4.96±1.34 effectiveness and 
94.1% appropriateness and 6.12±1.14 effectiveness in 
surprise. 
C. Measurements of Physisological Signals and Feature 
extraction 
To collect physiological signals for three emotions, the 
laboratory is a room with 5mⅹ2.5m size having a sound-
proof (lower than 35dB) of the noise level where any outside 
noise or artifact are completely blocked. A comfortable chair 
is placed in the middle of the laboratory and 38 inch TV

monitor set for presentation of film clips is placed in front of 
the chair. An intercommunication device is placed to the 
right side of chair for subjects to communicate with an 
experimenter. A CCTV is installed on the top of the monitor 
set to observe participant’s behaviors and their behaviors are 
storage through the monitor and a video cassette recorder 
outside the laboratory. 
Prior to the experiment, subjects are introduced to detail 
experiment procedures and have an adaptation time to feel 
comfortable in the laboratory setting. Then they are attached 
electrodes on their wrist, finger, and ankle for measurement 
of physiological signals. Physiological signals are measured 
for 60 sec prior to the film clip presentation (baseline) and 
for 2 to 4 min during the presentation of the film clips 
(emotional state), then for 60 sec after presentation of the 
film clips as recovery term. Subjects rate the emotion that 
they experienced during presentation of the film clip on the 
emotion assessment scale. 
The dataset of physiological signals such as skin 
temperature 
(SKT), 
electrodermal 
activity 
(EDA), 
photoplethysmography (PPG), and electrocardiogram (ECG) 
are collected by MP150 Biopac system Inc. (USA). SKT 
electrodes are attached on the first joint of non-dominant ring 
finger and on the first joint of the non-dominant thumb for 
PPG. EDA is measured with the use of 8 mm AgCl 
electrodes placed on the volar surface of the distal phalanges 
of the index and middle fingers of the non-dominant hand. 
Electrodes are filled with a 0.05 molar isotonic NaCl paste to 
provide a continuous connection between the electrodes and 
the skin. ECG electrodes are placed on both wrists and one 
left ankle with two kinds of electrodes, sputtered and AgCl 
ones. The left-ankle electrode is used as a reference.  
The signals are acquired for 1 minute long baseline state 
prior to presentation of emotional stimuli and 1-2 minutes 
long emotional states during presentation of the stimuli as 
emotional state. To extract features, the obtained signals are 
analyzed for 30 seconds from the baseline and the emotional 
state by AcqKnowledge (Ver. 3.8.1) software (USA) as 
shown in Fig. 2. 27 features, namely, bSCL, bSCR, eSCL, 
eSCR, dSCL, and dSCR features from EDA signal, 
BmeanSKT, EmeanSKT and DmeanSKT from SKT, bHR, 
bLF, bHF, bHRV, eHR, eLF, eHF, eHRV, dHR, dLF, dHF  
and dHRV from ECG, and bBVP, bPPT, eBVP, ePPT, 
dBVP and  dPPT from PPG are extracted from the obtained 
emotional physiological signals. These are the features that 
are commonly used in physiological signal analysis.

STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF FUZZY C-MEANS 
CLUSTERING BASED NEURAL NETWORKS 
Neural Network (NN) is a computational intelligence 
model inspired by the structure and functional aspects of 
biological neurons [11]. NN has been widely used to deal 
with pattern recognition problems. The generic topology of 
NN consists of three layers as shown in Fig. 1. A neuron in 
the input layer is connected to a layer of hidden neuron, 
which is connected to output neuron. The activity of the 
input neurons represents the raw information that is fed into 
the network, the activity of each hidden neuron is determined 
by the activities of the input neuron and the weights on the 
connections between the input and the hidden, and the 
behavior of the output depends on the activity of the hidden 
neurons and connection weights between the hidden and the 
output layer. 
The proposed Fuzzy c-means clustering based neural 
networks (FNN) exhibit a similar topology as the one 
encountered in simple neural network. However the 
functionality and the associated design process exhibit some 
evident differences. In particular, the kernel fields of neurons 
do not assume any explicit functional form (say, Gaussian, 
ellipsoidal, etc.), but are directly reflective of the nature of 
the data and come as the results of fuzzy clustering in input 
layer, polynomials in hidden layer and linear combination of 
391

activation signals in output layer. These networks results as a 
synergy between two other general constructs such as fuzzy 
c-means clustering [18][19] and neural networks [11]. 
In input layer, considering the prototypes v1, v2, …, vc 
formed by the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering method, the 
kernel of a neuron is expressed in the following way

The FCM clustering method comes as a standard 
mechanism aimed at the formation of ‘c’ fuzzy sets. The 
objective function Q guiding this clustering is expressed as a 
sum of the distances of individual data from the prototypes 
v1, v2, …, and vc,

number of patterns. The resulting partition matrix is denoted 
by U=[uik], i=1, 2,…,c; k=1, 2, …, N. While there is a 
substantial diversity as far as distance functions are 
concerned, here we adhere to a weighted Euclidean distance

with σj being a standard deviation of the j-th variable. While 
not being computationally demanding, this type of distance 
is still quite flexible and because of that commonly used.  
The minimization of Q is realized in successive iterations 
by adjusting both the prototypes and entries of the partition 
matrix, that is min Q(U, v1, v2, …, vc). The resulting partition 
matrix becomes output signals of kernel function in input 
layer, namely, U=IK. 
In addition, the kernel functions of hidden layer come in 
the product of polynomials of inputs and activation signals 
which are output signals of input layer.

These functions are activated by partition matrix and lead

rates when contrasted with conventional models.

RESULTS OF EMOTION RECOGNITION 
Our objective is to quantify the performance of the 
proposed FNNs recognizer and to compare it with the 
performance of some other recognizer reported in the 
literature. In the assessment of the performance of the 
recognizer, we use the recognition accuracy for three 
emotions. The experiments completed in this study are 
reported for the 10 fold cross-validation for assessing how 
the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an 
independent dataset. 
For the recognition of boredom, pain and surprise 
emotions, Table I contrasts the recognition accuracy (%) of 
the proposed FNNs with other well-known methods (C4.5, 
SOM, Naïve Bayes and SVM) studied in the literatures [9]-
[14]. The experimental results reveal that the proposed 
approach and the resulting model outperform the existing 
methods in terms of better prediction capabilities on feature 
space. 
C4.5 developed by R. Quinlan is one of statistical 
classifier algorithms and builds decision trees from a set of 
training data. C4.5 starts with large sets of cases belonging to 
known classes. The cases, described by any mixture of 
nominal and numeric properties, are scrutinized for patterns 
that allow the classes to be reliably discriminated. These 
patterns are then expressed as models, in the form of 
decision trees or sets of if-then rules, which can be used to 
classify new cases, with emphasis on making the models 
understandable as well as accurate.  
SOM (self-organizing map), called Kohonen map, is a 
type of artificial neural networks in the unsupervised 
learning category and generally present a simplified, 
relational view of a highly complex data set. This is called a 
topology-preserving map because there is a topological 
structure imposed on the nodes in the network. A topological 
map is simply a mapping that preserves neighbourhood 
relations. The goal of training is that the “winning” unit in 
the target space is adjusted so that it is more like the 
particular pattern. Others in the neighbourhood of output are 
also adjusted so that their weights more nearly match that of 
the input pattern. 
The Naïve Bayes algorithm is a classification algorithm 
based on Bayes rule and particularly suited when the 
dimensionality of the inputs is high. When the dependency 
relationships among the features used by a classifier are 
392

unknown, we generally proceed by taking the simplest 
assumption, namely, that the feature are conditionally 
independent given the category, that is,

This so-called naïve Bayes rule often works quite well in 
practice, and it can be expressed by a very simple belief net. 
SVM (support vector machine) finds a hyperplane based 
on support vector to analyze data and recognize patterns. The 
complexity of the resulting recognizer is characterized by the 
number of support vectors rather than the dimensionality of 
the transformed space. The goal in training SVM is to find 
the separating hyperplane with the largest margin. We expect 
that the larger the margin, the better generalization of the 
recognizer. 
The more detail results of emotion recognition accuracy 
by each algorithm are like from Table II to VIII. In analysis 
of C4.5, accuracy of each emotion has range of 42% to 74%. 
Boredom is recognized by C4.5 with 73.9%, pain 42.0%, and 
surprise 58.9% as shown in Table II. In Table III and IV, the 
results of Naïve Bayes and SVM are shown for three 
emotions, respectively. Naïve Bayes provides accuracy of 
71.88 % when it recognized all emotions. In boredom, 
accuracy of 73.9% is achieved, 71.6% in pain, 66.7% in 
surprise. The results of emotion recognition using SVM 
show recognition accuracy of 67%, 62.1%, and 57.3% 
according to orders of boredom, pain, and surprise. For the 
supervised and unsupervised SOM, 61.45% and 59.22% are 
obtained, respectively, as recognition accuracy for three 
emotions. For the each emotion, boredom, pain and surprise, 
69.3%, 52.7% and 62% are obtained in supervised SOM and 
68.2%, 56.8%, and 53.1% are resulted from unsupervised 
SOM. Finally, the recognition accuracy of the proposed FNN 
with constant and linear has 70.2% and 74.49%, respectively 
for three emotion recognition. In case of constant, each 
emotion is recognized by FNN with 79% of boredom, 61.5% 
of pain and 69.8% of surprise. 72.2%, 74.6% and 76.6% are 
shown as results of emotion recognition by FNN with linear 
for boredom, pain and surprise, respectively. 
C4.5 and Naïve Bayes were coming from the 
Classification Toolbox of MATLAB. For SVM, we have 
used Duda’s Toolbox (www.yom-tov.info/toolbox.html). 
SOM toolbox available in MATLAB has offered SOM 
algorithms, see www.cis.hut.fi/projects/somtoolbox/.

pain and surprise emotions. The emotion stimuli used to 
induce a participant’s emotion were evaluated for their 
suitability and effectiveness. The result showed that 
emotional stimuli have the appropriateness of 92.5% and the 
effectiveness of 5.4 point (7 point Likert scale) on average. 
Twenty seven features have been extracted by means of the 
statistical and the geometric approaches in time and 
frequency domain from physiological signals such as EDA, 
SKT, PPG and ECG. These signals have been induced by 
emotional stimuli. In order to recognize the three emotions 
with physiological signals, we have proposed fuzzy c-means 
clustering based neural networks (FNNs) with three layers. 
Fuzzy c-means clustering method as a kernel function has 
used in a neuron in input layer. A kernel function of a neuron 
in the hidden layer used two types of polynomial functions 
and the linear combination of input signals were used in 
output layer of the proposed networks. Using two types of 
polynomial functions helped to improve the characteristic of 
a recognizer and carried out the presentation of a partitioned 
local space. The proposed FNN recognizer generates a 
nonlinear discernment function in the output space and has 
the better performance of emotion recognition. As shown in 
results, the proposed FNN with linear function has 
recognition accuracy 74.49% for the three emotions.  The 
proposed recognizer will lead to better chance to recognize 
human emotions by using physiological signals in the 
emotional interaction between man and machine.
