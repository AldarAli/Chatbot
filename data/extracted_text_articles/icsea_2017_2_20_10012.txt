Abstract—The Internet was originally built based on trust.
After several leaks of information, new risks and challenges
are introduced. In recent years, we have used even more new
devices based on the Internet. Among the main concerns reported
on the literature, we need some special attention to trust,
protection of data and privacy. In this scenario, a new paradigm
has emerged, some information security based on transparency
instead of current models of information security on closed
and obscure approaches. Some initiatives have been emerging
with Blockchain methods and technologies. In this paper, we
propose to build an initial view of the model, as a result of
our preliminary investigations, described in the Methodology as
systematic mapping. The initial results allowed the perception of
the initial requirements involved and open problems. We report
on some frameworks, models, approaches, and other Blockchain-
based Internet of Things (IoT) initiatives. We also evaluate the
adherence of each paper to ten IoT key requirements. This work
contributes to the new and still developing body of knowledge in
the areas of security, privacy and trust. Our ﬁndings are useful
not only for future studies in the Academy but also for companies
from various sectors present in the Internet ecosystem. They
can beneﬁt from the consolidated knowledge and use it to guide
the deﬁnition of their development processes geared to the new
paradigms of the IoT.

INTRODUCTION
The Internet of Things (IoT) is an application domain that
integrates different technological and social ﬁelds. Despite the
diversity of research on IoT, its deﬁnition remains fuzzy [1].
With the increase in demand and production of the new devices
based on the IoT paradigms, trust and privacy can be even
harder for the engineering ﬁeld. Security ﬂaws in the IoT
might lead, for instance, to malicious attacks on secrecy and
authentication, silent attacks on service integrity, or attacks
on network availability, such as the Denial of Service (DoS).
However, privacy and anonymity, on the other hand, are no
less severe issues and must be integrated into the design to
give users control over their privacy.
In this respect, a new approach has arisen in the security
and transparency of information, which takes the place of
current models of information security and is based on closed
and obscure approaches. Some initiatives have come up with
Blockchain methods and technologies [2].
Among the problems of building devices (or embedded sys-
tems) based on the IoT paradigm, we can highlight the absence
of formalism, language or modeling architecture that enables
the uniﬁed development and integration among the various
disciplines of the Semantic Web Stack. We are faced with
certain difﬁculties; in addition to complexity and scalability,
there are also time latency problems (currently 10 minutes
in the Bitcoin network) and the number of conﬁrmations that
must be required for transactions, contradicting IoT concep-
tions regarding real-time processing [1]. The transactions in
the Bitcoin network are visible to all nodes. That presents
some difﬁculties (i.e., transactions carried out only for a few
nodes of the network), when we need devices for controlled
environments [3].
In this context, it is fundamental to comprehend how the
traditional software development could be adapted or evolved
to support those new Blockchain-based IoT requirements.
What consolidated knowledge is, which factors inﬂuence on
device development are.
To achieve the goal of this study, we are conducting a
systematic mapping of critical factors in IoT paradigms-based,
embedded systems building. In this research, we are looking
for answers to the following questions: i) has Blockchain-
based IoT been constructed to stand on development pro-
cesses? Also, ii) which Blockchain-based IoTs character-
istics, principles or requirements have been considered in
Blockchain-based IoT development processes? These research
questions will be answered in Section IV.
The main objective of this research is to understand
Blockchain-based IoT domains as well as best practices in the
ﬁeld, and to present the latest research about the construction
of devices (or things). In addition, this effort contributes to
the very new and still growing knowledge regarding security,
privacy and trust (areas still very undeveloped) of the IoT.
This study is useful not only for future studies in academia
but also for companies from various sectors operating in the
Internet ecosystem. These companies can beneﬁt from the
consolidated knowledge and use it to guide the deﬁnition of
their development processes geared to the new paradigms of
the IoT.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, a brieﬁng about the state of the art is presented.
Section III presents the planning, conduction, and reporting
of the Systematic Mapping. Section IV presents the prelim-
inary studies results. Section V presents current trends and
challenges; and in Section VI, conclusions and future work
are discussed.

II.
STATE OF THE ART
In this section, we present initial concepts for the under-
standing of this paper. The IoT and the Blockchain and its
ontology overviews are brieﬂy presented below.
A.
The Internet of Things overview
The IoT consists of a global network of billions of uniquely
identiﬁable and addressable objects, embedded with sensors,
actuators, and controllers. Those are connected to the Internet
in wireless mode [4]. The IoT is a “dynamic global network
infrastructure that can self-conﬁgure using standards and using
interoperability protocols where things (physical and virtual)
have identities, attributes, and uniqueness, feature intelligent
interfaces, and it can be seamlessly integrated into the net-
work” [2].
The IEEE presents IoT as an application domain that
incorporates different technological and social ﬁelds. IEEE
described the phrase Internet of Thing as a network of items
each embedded with sensors
which are connected to the
Internet [5]. It is a (non-approved) description of the Internet
of Things. However, this statement is treating just one of the
physical aspects of Internet of Things [6].
B.
The Blockchain overview
The Blockchain is a universal digital ledger that works at
the core of decentralized ﬁnancial systems, such as Bitcoin
and many other decentralized systems. The blockchain keeps
a record of all transaction made by each participant. Cryp-
tography is used to verify operations and keep information
on the blockchain private. Several participants verify each
transaction, providing highly redundant veriﬁcation and are
rewarded for the computational work required.
The Blockchain technology has the ability to make the
organizations that use it transparent, democratic, decentralized,
secure, and efﬁcient. The Blockchain can be used to access
to ﬁnancial services, it presents the primary advantages of the
traditional correspondent banking system: i) consistent process
standards; ii) more long-range global reconnaissance.
C.
The Blockchain Ontology
A ﬁrst effort to standardize this technology is the BLONDIE
(Blockchain Ontology with Dynamic Extensibility) ontology.
This OWL ontology can be used to express in RDF different
ﬁelds of the structures of Ethereum or Bitcoin. It can also
be extended to cover other Blockchain technologies. In addi-
tion, BLONDIE being OWL has the ability to make explicit
knowledge available [3].
Ugarte [3] says that an ideal scenario would be that everyone
would use only the original Bitcoin technology, or forks
with minimum modiﬁcations. The protocol itself is already
standardized and well-deﬁned, but since Bitcoin presents many
limitations and was not designed for other functionalities
besides ﬁnancial transactions, it is not a realistic scenario.
Currently, the interoperability between Blockchain tech-
nologies is one of the most discussed issues in the Blockchain
world and this is where we must focus our efforts on. The
devices would be able to communicate to each other directly
to update software, manage bugs, and monitor energy usage.
III.
METHODOLOGY
The research methodology was divided into four steps. In
this paper, we will present only Step #2 (Systematic Mapping)
of this Doctoral research, as shown in Fig. 1, and described
in detail as follows.

A.
Step 2—Systematic Mapping
The systematic mapping study was deemed warranted after
an initial foray into the discussed topic. Before starting a
systematic mapping, we came across a very broad question.
To obtain an overview of this research topic and identify
evidence to provide the best positions on the issues of research,
we have established a systematic mapping [8], ], as shown
a summarization in Fig. 2. The authors still saying that the
systematic mapping allows:
• Mapping the evidence of a domain at a high level of
granularity;
• The identiﬁcation of clusters and void of evidence to
enable future systematic reviews; and
• Discover areas to conduct new primary studies.

Protocol: We have conducted this study based on the
conscious guidelines and procedures. This protocol speciﬁes
the basis for the study research questions, search strategy,
selection criteria, and data extraction and synthesis. The pro-
tocol was mainly developed by one of the researchers and
reviewed by two of the senior researchers aiming to mitigate
any bias [8].
Search string. The standard version of search string was
designed to include variations and synonym terms related to

Search strategy. We selected the following search engines:
ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplorer, ISI Web of Science Sci-
ence Direct, Scopus, Engineering Village. We have considered
opinion of experts, gray literature, and related works of the
included studies.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria. The studies were selected
according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria described
below. In order to select suitable studies to answer our research
questions, we established the following Inclusion (IC) and
Exclusion Criteria (EC):
• IC1. The study discusses Blockchain-based IoT develop-
ment processes.
• IC2. The study addresses Blockchain-based IoT charac-
teristics, requirements, problems or activities related to
Blockchain-based IoT development processes.
• EC1. The study is not related to Blockchain-based IoT.
• EC2. The study does not discuss any Blockchain-based
IoT development process.
• EC3. The complete study is not available.
2)
Conduction of the Research: Once the protocol had
been agreed, the review review itself can be initialized. How-
ever, as noted previously, researchers were expected to try each
of the steps described in this section when they construct their
research protocol [8].
The author [9] recommends the adoption of effective criteria
for inclusion and exclusion of relevant studies to answer
the research questions. Some of the criteria are essential for
the collection of a rigorous and defensible set of data for
evaluation.
Therefore, we applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria
involved in the analysis of the parameters 1) title and keywords
check out, it was applied one 2) summary of the analysis in the
work identiﬁed in the previous phase, if there are questions,
reading the introduction and conclusion; and 3) the complete
reading of the paper.
IV.
PRELIMINARY STUDIES RESULTS
The results are reported in the systematic mapping as
follows.
Table I shows the selection of studies by database (source
studies). The initial search resulted in 25 works. In the
ﬁrst analysis, we excluded 2 items, 23 papers remaining. In
the second selection, applying the criteria of inclusion and
exclusion in the reading of the summary, the number of articles
was reduced to 21. Upon complete reading of each of the
other items, two papers, which had the same content or similar
(duplicate), were found, resulting in their exclusion, leaving at
the end 17 papers with strong and relevant indications to the
area of investigation.

Based on the analysis of the 17 primary studies included, we
have addressed the Research Questions (RQ). In this section,
we will be addressing these Questions.
RQ1. Has Blockchain-based IoT been constructed to stand
on development processes?
We have identiﬁed 17 initiatives of Blockchain-based IoT
development as shown the Table I. Three of these initiatives
are classiﬁed by the authors as Frameworks, four as Models,
six as Approaches, and four as Other Initiatives. For the
other studies, we created the classiﬁcation Other Initiatives
to Blockchain-based IoT Development, which includes single
initiative of methodology, description, [re]engineering, ontol-
ogy, or simulation platform for Blockchain-based IoT.

RQ2. Which Blockchain-based IoT’s characteristics, prin-
ciples or requirements have been considered in Blockchain-
based IoT development processes?
We reported on some frameworks, models, approaches, and
other Blockchain-based IoT initiatives that reﬂect adherence to
well-known development processes to build an initial Body of
Knowledge. We detected key requirements in the IoT and we
determined whether they were functional and non-functional
requirements. Authors of the primary studies classiﬁed their
works as follows: four as Frameworks, four as Models, two
as Methods, and three as Approaches. We classiﬁed four
papers as Other Initiatives addressed in initial descriptions or
superﬁcial studies.
Uckelmann, Harrison and Michahelles described key re-
quirements (kR) that need to be considered in the IoT, as seen
in Table III.
We summarized the domain type: six as generic, eight as
speciﬁc, and three as non-speciﬁc. We then identiﬁed essential
characteristics, processes, modeling phases, tasks and prod-
ucts. Most of these works (16) emphasized domain analysis,
but just seven these presented a domain design, into three
discussed architecture design and only two presented a detailed
and comprehensive design. These papers addressed the product
modeling: ten as a domain model, ﬁve as an architectural
model, and one as agent model. The community still has
no better support for the design, architecture, integration and
testing processes to build Blockchain-based IoT.
Considering the IoT key requirements by [19], Table III
depicts 100% of all studies addressed the kR1 (meet key
societal needs for the IoT including open governance, security,
privacy and trustworthiness). This was followed by 70.6%
which addressed both kR2 (bridge the gap between B2B,
business-to-consumer (B2C) and machine-to-machine (M2M)
requirements through a generic and open IoT infrastructure)
and kR3 (design an open, scalable, ﬂexible and sustainable in-
frastructure for the IoT). Requirement kR4 (develop migration
paths for disruptive technological developments to the IoT)
is covered by 64.7% and kR5 (excite and enable businesses
and people to contribute to the IoT) is covered by 58.8%,
followed by 52.9% for both kR6 (enable businesses across
different industries to develop high added value products and
services) and kR8 (provide an open solution for sharing costs,
beneﬁts and revenue generation in the IoT). The other IoT key
requirements did not achieve at least 50%.
We have also evaluated the adherence of each paper. In
this analysis, the papers are evaluated against the ten IoT
key requirements described in Table III. We highlight the
importance of the studies S1, S8, S14, S15 and S16. They
discuss some main activities or artifacts or modeling of design,
but they did not explicitly address these activities or artifacts
or modeling design in their propositions. However, they did
mention some essential IoT characteristics and processes. On
the other hand, we considered that studies S2, S3, S4, S5, S6,
S7, S9, S10, S11, S12, S13 and S17 covered 50% or less and
therefore did not explicitly address all of the IoT fundamental
processes.
V.
CURRENT TRENDS AND CHALLENGES
The main trends and challenges discussed by the authors of
the included papers about Blockchain-based IoT are described
in this section.
One author [4] says that security ﬂaws in the IoT may lead,
for instance, to malicious attacks on secrecy and authentica-
tion, silent attacks on service integrity, or attacks on network
availability such as the DoS. Privacy and anonymity, on the
other hand, are no less serious issues. IoT devices are natural
“collectors and distributors of information”, so they represent
a unique challenge to individual privacy.
In particular, the challenges include the ubiquitous interac-
tion of users with smart objects and groups of things, as well
as the uncontrolled concentration of such data on platforms
lacking in transparency, perhaps systematically exposing users
to several threats, such as identiﬁcation, localization, moni-
toring, tracking, surveillance, manipulation, proﬁling, targeted
advertising, data linkage, and even social engineering.
The authors in [16] investigated which are the main factors
affecting the levels of integrity, anonymity, and adaptability
of the blockchain. They should further analyze what are the
security properties provided by the Proof of Work, which up
to now is one of the key factors allowing for the achievement
of distributed consensus.
The Ethereum platform supports a feature to encode rules
or scripts for processing transactions through smart contracts.
The authors in [10] investigated the security of running smart
contracts based on Ethereum in an open distributed network.
According to the authors [10][11]there are several new security
problems. These bugs suggest subtle gaps in the understanding
of the distributed semantics of the underlying platform. Those
authors propose ways to enhance the operational semantics to
make contracts less vulnerable through a symbolic execution
tool called Oyente.
Blockchain has recently attracted the interest of stakeholders
from the most varied sectors, from ﬁnance and health-care to
utilities, real estate, and the government sector. That explosion

of interest in Blockchain-based applications has happened
because we need applications that can run only through a
trusted intermediary. And, with the adoption of Blockchain
strategies, we can operate without the need for a central
authority [17].
The authors in [24] also say we can then create some
knowledge basis by deﬁning individual instances of these
classes, ﬁlling in speciﬁc slot value information and additional
slot restrictions.
A.
Threats to Validity
We have detected some threats to validity in this Systematic
Mapping:
• The specic group of interest: This Systematic Mapping
used a specic group of search engines considered the most
relevant. However, some primary studies may be missing.
To mitigate this threat, we adopted the opinion of experts
and snowballing.
• The choice of primary studies: The classication of
the authors was the only evaluation criterion to select
each study, restricted to IoT and Blockchain. No other
nomenclature was considered.
• Placebo effects or courtesy bias or inadequate survey
instrument: Anything that seemed to be real research,
containing results without errors.
• Number of reviewers: SM was conducted by one re-
searcher. We considered adopting the support of experts.
• Study not available: Six primary studies were not avail-
able.
• Data extraction doubts: Some information was not
clearly available and it was very difcult to interpret.
Discussions with experts were considered.
VI.
CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE WORK
We conducted a Systematic Mapping to investigate which
primary development processes have been used in, and which
factors have been inﬂuencing Blockchain-based IoT building.
The ultimate goal of our research is to present the current
panorama about best practices outlined in the literature to
develop an initial Blockchain-based ontology model for IoT
projects. The Blockchain-based IoT research area is so new
and most of the papers and publications (such as a book, a
technical report and others works) are concentrated in the last
ve years (i.e., 17 of the studies that were considered, and seen
in Table II).
We reported on some frameworks, models, approaches, and
other Blockchain-based IoT initiatives that present adherence
to well-known development processes and endeavor to build
an initial body of knowledge. We detected key requirements on
the IoT and, we sorted them by functional and non-functional
requirements. We also evaluated the adherence of each paper.
In this analysis, the papers are evaluated against the ten IoT
key requirements.
Thus, the main contribution of this paper is the under-
standing of the realm of Blockchain-based IoT development,
and we aim to establish best practices in the construction
of devices (or things) that inspire more condence in their
use (or transactions). These are the essential requirements for
building a Blockchain-based IoT, and we have identiﬁed as
32

well as characteristics, processes, former initiatives and current
challenges of Blockchain-based IoT.
Our future work will address the main characteristics,
models and tasks to integrate existing approaches and scalable
blockchains, and in designing an architecture for IoT appli-
cations which addresses integrity, trust and security issues.
Moreover, we will concentrate on building an initial body of
knowledge about Blockchain-based IoT devices. We intend to
conduct semistructured interviews with specialists to evaluate
the original understanding.
