Abstract—We propose a multidimensional key assignment
scheme using modiﬁed hash chains (MHCs) to hierarchically
control access to scalable media. By introducing MHCs, the
proposed scheme manages one key composed of a single key
segment. The single managed key is not distributed to any
user, providing security against key leakage. Collusion attacks
caused by multiple users to obtain media with higher quality
than that allowed by their access rights are prevented with the
key assignment order. Our scheme also inhibits the growth of
hash calculation. Performance analysis shows the validity of
the proposed scheme.

hash chain; cyclic shift; scalable media.
I. INTRODUCTION
With the growth in network technology, scalable trans-
mission has become popular. Hierarchical access control
to protect scalable media has been studied widely [1]–
[8]. A simple and straightforward way to realize versatile
access control for scalable media, to which several entities
belong, is encrypting each entity individually. This approach,
however, has to manage a large number of keys, given a large
number of entities in a medium.
Hierarchical access control schemes have been proposed
for scalable media [3]–[8], such as JPEG 2000 [9] coded
images and/or MPEG-4 ﬁne granularity scalability [10]
coded videos, so that each user can obtain a medium at the
permitted quality from one common enciphered codestream.
OHCs (Ordinary hash chains) [11], hereafter, have also been
introduced to several schemes for reduction of the number
of key segments, which compose each key [5]–[7]. These
OHC-based access control schemes increase the number of
key segments, depending not only on the dimensions of
scalability, but also on the hierarchical depth of scalability.
Another scheme, which is also based on OHCs, has been
proposed to reduce the number of key segments to one, but
this scheme assumes the controlled media has only a single
hierarchy [8].
In this paper, we propose an efﬁcient key assignment
scheme for hierarchical media access control. We assume
that there is multi-dimensional scalability in each scalable
medium. By introducing MHCs (modiﬁed hash chains),
hereafter, the proposed scheme manages one key composed
of a single key segment. The managed key is not distributed
to any users, providing security against key leakage. Our
scheme is also resilient to collusion attacks, in which ma-
licious users illegally access media at higher quality than
that allowed by their access rights. Moreover this scheme
inhibits increasing the amount of hash calculation by using
cyclic shifts.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II brieﬂy
describes hierarchical access control and mentions three re-
quirements for hierarchical access control of scalable media.
The new scheme is proposed in Section III, and is analyzed
in Section IV. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section V.
II. PRELIMINARIES
We brieﬂy describe hierarchical access control for scal-
able media, and also summarize three requirements on key
assignment for hierarchical access control, introducing some
conventional schemes [5]–[7] to clarify the aim of this work.
A. Hierarchical Access Control
Firstly, we assume that scalable medium X has one-
dimensional scalability (J
= 1) and the scalability is
frame rate, of which the hierarchical depth is D1 = 4.
As shown in Fig. 1, medium X should be decoded at 15
(Q0), 30 (Q1), 60 (Q2), or 120 (Q3) frames per second
(fps). Fig. 2 shows a practical diagram of medium X. Ld1
(d1 = 0, 1, 2, 3) represents a set of frames decoded at 15,
30, 60, or 120 fps. Entity E3 is a complementary set of L2,
that is frames decoded at 120 fps only. Similarly, E2 and E1
represent complementary sets of L1 and L0, respectively. E0
represents the same as L0, that is a set of frames decoded
at each frame rate.
For another example, we also assume that scalable
medium X has two-dimensional scalability (J = 2). One

proposed scheme is resistant to collusion attacks.
2) The Less Number of Key segments: Key assignment
schemes that manage one key consisting of multiple key
segments and subordinately derive other keys from the
managed key have been proposed [5]–[7]. In these schemes,
a key consists of multiple key segments.
First, Scheme I [5], which is vulnerable to collusion
attacks, needs the same number of key segments as the
number of the dimensions of scalability, J. The number of
key segments in Scheme I, SI, is
SI = J.
(1)
The second and third schemes [6], [7], Scheme II and
Scheme III hereafter, control access to scalable media with
collusion attack resilience. The number of key segments in
Schemes II and III, SII and SIII, are
SII =
J
∏

D1 ≥ D2 ≥ · · · ≥ DJ,
(2)
SIII ≤
J
∏
j=2
Dj,
D1 ≥ D2 ≥ · · · ≥ DJ,
(3)
respectively, whereas the proposed scheme needs a single
key segment.
3) The Less Amount of Hash Calculation: To decrease
the number of key segments, a cryptographic one-way
hash function is introduced in Schemes I, II, and III. The
maximum amount of hash calculation in these schemes, CI,
CII, and CIII, are
CI =
J
∑

CII =
J
∏

Dj − 1,
(5)
CIII =

∏

(6)
respectively. Thus, these amounts of hash calculation must
increase, deepened the hierarchical depth of scalability, Dj.
The proposed scheme is designed not to increase hash
calculation substantially.
III. PROPOSED SCHEME
In this section, we propose a new key assignment scheme
for access control of scalable media that manages one key
consisting of a single key segment. The proposed scheme is
resilient to collusion attacks the same as Schemes II and III,
and does not increase the amount of hash calculation.
A. Key Assignment and Encipherment
As an example of scalable media for explanation, we
assume three-dimensional scalable medium X (J = 3)
shown in Fig. 6, where it is composed of four kinds of frame
rates (D1 = 4), three resolution levels (D2 = 3), and two
layers (D3 = 2). Fig. 7 shows our proposed key assignment
order, where KEd1,d2,d3 is the key for entity Ed1,d2,d3 and
Km is the managed key. This order is resilient to collusion
attacks. It is noted that a key is not composed of multiple
key segments and consists of a single key segment in the
proposed scheme.
Firstly key KE3,2,1 is derived from Km as
KE3,2,1 = h (Km) ,
(7)
where h(·) is a cryptographic one-way hash function, i.e., the
SHA-2 family (SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA 384, and SHA-
512) [12]. Similarly, keys KEd1,d2,d3 ’s are assigned on each
of d2 or d3 (d2 = 2, 1, 0 and d3 = 1, 0) as
KEd1,d2,d3 = h3−d1 (
KE3,d2,d3
)
,
d1 = 2, 1, 0,

respectively, where hα (β) represents that h(·) is applied to
β recursively α times. Keys KE3,d2,d3 ’s, except KE3,2,1, are
given in the next paragraph. Eq. (8) represents OHCs [11],
and the OHCs are shown with solid arrows in Fig. 7. Eq. (8)
is also represented as
KEd1,d2,d3 = h
(
KEd1+1,d2,d3
)
,
d1 = 2, 1, 0.
(9)
Meanwhile, keys KE3,d2,d3 ’s, except KE3,2,1, are assigned
by MHCs. In this example, keys KE3,1,d3 , KE3,0,d3 are given
on each d3 (d3 = 1, 0) as
KE3,d2,d3 = h
(
s
(
KE3,d2+1,d3
))
,
d2 = 1, 0,
(10)
where s(·) is a cyclic shift. It is noted that the amount of each
cyclic shift doesn’t have to be secret information and that
they can be opened to the public. Replacing the combination
of s(·) and h(·) with f(·), which is an MHC, Eq. (10) is
represented as
KE3,d2,d3 = f
(
KE3,d2+1,d3
)
,
d2 = 1, 0.
(11)
Key KE3,2,0 is also derived as
KE3,2,d3 = h
(
s
(
KE3,2,d3+1
))
= f
(
KE3,2,d3+1
)
d3 = 0.

It is noted that the amounts of cyclic shifts are secret
information. The MHCs are shown with dashed arrows in
Fig. 7.

Distributed and derived keys that the user needs to decompress

By introducing MHCs, all keys KEd1,d2,d3’s for all entities
Ed1,d2,d3’s are assigned based on managed key Km. With
key KEd1,d2,d3, each entity Ed1,d2,d3 is enciphered. It is
noted that any arbitrary symmetric encipher algorithm can
be used in the proposed scheme.
B. Distributed keys and Decipherment
Here, it is considered that a user is allowed to access
medium X with quality Q1,2,0. The user receives keys
KE1,2,0, KE1,1,0, and KE1,0,0 as shown in Fig. 8(a). To
decompress medium X at Q1,2,0, the user needs to decipher
six entities E1,2,0, E1,1,0, E1,0,0, E0,2,0, E0,1,0, and E0,0,0.
Three keys KE0,2,0, KE0,1,0, and KE0,0,0 are derived from
distributed keys KE1,2,0, KE1,1,0, and KE1,0,0 as
KE0,d2,0 = h
(
KE1,d2,0
)
,
d2 = 2, 1, 0.
(13)
By using six keys KE1,2,0, KE1,1,0, KE1,0,0, KE0,2,0,
KE0,1,0, and KE0,0,0, corresponding entities are deciphered
and decompressed to present medium X at Q1,2,0.
As another example, we also assume that a user can access
medium X with quality Q3,1,1. The user receives two keys
KE3,1,1 and KE3,1,0 as shown in Fig. 8(b). To access medium
X at Q3,1,1, the user has to obtain 16 of keys KEd1,d2,d3 ’s
(d1
= 3, 2, 1, 0, d2
= 1, 0, and d3
= 1, 0). KE3,0,1
and KE3,0,0 are derived from distributed keys KE3,1,1 and

Then, 12 of keys KEd1,d2,d3’s (d1 = 2, 1, 0, d2 = 1, 0, and
d3 = 1, 0) are assigned using OHCs as given in Eq. (8), and
the user can decompress medium X at Q3,1,1.
In the proposed scheme, the managed key is never dis-
tributed to any users in terms of security against key leakage.
IV. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON
This section veriﬁes that the proposed scheme meets
requirements described in Section II-B. Table I shows the
comparison result in terms of collusion attack resilience, the
number of key segments and the amount of hash calculation,
which are described in Section II-B. The proposed scheme
is evaluated by comparing with three conventional schemes,
i.e., Schemes I [5], II [6], and III [7], which use only OHCs.
A. Collusion Attack-Resistance
The proposed scheme is resilient to collusion attacks as
well as Schemes II and III, while Scheme I is naive for the
attacks.
In Fig. 6, we assume that Alice is allowed to access
medium X at Q0,2,0 and Bob is allowed to decompress it at
Q3,0,1. Alice receives three keys KE0,n2,0’s (n2 = 2, 1, 0).
She cannot derive any keys from these distributed keys. In
other hand, Bob receives two keys KE3,0,1 and KE3,0,0 and
derives six keys KEn1,0,n3’s (n1 = 2, 1, 0 and n3 = 1, 0)
using Eq. (8). They obtain ten valid keys in total, but
they can not illegally derive any keys which they are not
permitted to derive from these ten keys.
B. The Number of Key Segments
The proposed scheme manages one key consisting of a
single key segment regardless of the dimensions of scalabil-
ity and the hierarchical depth of scalability, while Schemes I,
II, and III must manage multiple key segments, as given in
Eqs. (1), (2), and (3).
The managed key is not distributed to any users in the
proposed scheme in terms of security against key leakage,
whereas the managed key segments are distributed to some
users in Schemes I, II, and III.
C. The Amount of Hash Calculation
The maximum amount of hash calculation in the proposed
scheme is ∏J
j=1 Dj − 1, which is the same as that in
Scheme II, CII, as given in Eq. (5). CIII is ∏J
j=1 Dj, as given
in Eq. (6), and Scheme III must calculate once more than
with the proposed scheme. Although CI is less than those in
other schemes, Scheme I is vulnerable for collusion attacks.
It is noted that the proposed scheme needs cyclic shifts to
assign some of keys.
V. CONCLUSION
This paper has proposed a novel key assignment scheme
for hierarchical media access control, in which MHCs are
employed. The proposed scheme can control access to scal-
able media with multi-dimensional scalability. The scheme
manages one key composed of a single key segment. The
single managed key is not distributed to any users. This
scheme also prevents collusion attacks, in which malicious
users illegally access media at higher quality than that
allowed by their access rights. Performance analysis showed
the effectiveness of our scheme. Future work will focus on
applying this scheme to real systems.
