Abstract—This paper proposes our designed system to estimate
the optimal social networking connections for people with mood
disorders, such as depression. We collected data from Twitter and
analyzed users’ characteristics by adopting an emotional polarity
value index. Based on these data analyses, we deﬁned each user’s
positivity level and estimated the level of mood disorder from the
content of their tweets. We also simulated the system’s use by
people with severe mood disorders. A computational model based
on a knapsack problem, a combinatorial problem to solve using
an optimization method, was created based on the hypothesis that
people likely to have mood disorders will more likely connect with
people who have similarly severe mood disorders. The proposed
system solved it using an approximate solution method that can
be computed in a practical amount of time. As a result, (1)
the user preferred a user with the same mood disorder severity
when a user connected to a user with frequent tweets and (2) the
difference in mood disorder severity was not as important when
the user connected to a user with infrequent tweets.
Keywords-Twitter; SNS; data mining; combinatorial opti-
mization.
I. INTRODUCTION
We will present an outline of our research in this section.
A. SNS and Depression
Social Networking Services (SNSs) have attracted atten-
tion as a communication platform less affected by time and
space constraints compared to face-to-face communication.
However, the cost of SNSs’ convenience is that many people
suffer from physical and mental fatigue. Fatigue caused by
information overload has been studied in large social networks
[1].
Depression can be caused by diverse factors, including
problems with health, family, economics, and employment
and labor, but a relationship between social network use
and depression has also been recently identiﬁed [2]. In other
words, information overload emotional overload must both be
addressed.
Depressed people tend to underestimate their social skills
and avoid communicating with others [3]. A relationship
between loneliness and depression has been suggested, and ap-
propriate communication may help alleviate depressive symp-
toms [4]. Bessiere et al. [5] also pointed out the importance
of considering the psychological impact of communicating on
the Internet.
B. Motivation
One negative effect of social networking sites is people’s
inevitable unpleasant experiences with anonymous communi-
cation. In the real world, more people suffer from depression
for various reasons, and SNSs’ ease of use greatly beneﬁts
society and should be utilized to solve these problems. If we
can improve relationships through SNS, we can alleviate mood
disorders, such as depression.
C. Optimization Problem
The number of people an individual can connect with is
very small compared to the number of people who use an
SNS, so it is important to know who to connect with. Finding
the best connections among users is essentially a combinatorial
optimization problem.
Although combinatorial optimization problems are solvable
in computational theory, solving them in practical computing
time is difﬁcult when their scale becomes large. However,
many solutions to restrictive problems have been studied, and
the solution to the knapsack problem is practical. Optimization
methods based on mathematical programming make it easier to
estimate the calculation accuracy and time required compared
to learning algorithms such as neural networks.
Therefore, these optimization methods are suitable for build-
ing elaborate computational models. In this study, we use the
surrogate constraint method for the multi-constraint nonlinear
knapsack problem to optimize connections among Twitter
users.
D. Research Subject
1) Language: Considering the author’s language-dependent
environment and the possibility of future experiments on
subjects, we targeted SNS users who use Japanese. Notably,
Japanese has no explicit word separators, so a morphological
analysis is needed to generate word list data from sentence
data for analyses.
2) Types of SNS: Several types of SNSs exist, and we chose
Twitter for its wide usage rate among Japanese people and its
easy-to-use an Application Programming Interface(API). The
most popular SNS in Japan is LINE, but LINE is mainly used
for private purposes, so it was excluded from the study.
E. Proposed System
We devised a system that suggests optimal connections for
Japanese Twitter users likely to have mood disorders. Based

on a user’s tweet data, we deﬁned the user’s characteristics,
created a computational model of the knapsack problem by
clustering the characteristics, and calculated a sub-optimal
solution using an approximate solution method.
In general, mood disorders refer to conditions such as
depression and bipolar disorder, which are characterized by
emotional ups and downs so severe or unstable that they in-
terfere with daily life. This study concerned situations ranging
from weak to severe tendencies but did not use a clinical
diagnosis.
Instead, we deﬁned “mood disorder” broadly to cover mild
conditions, such as lethargy and depression to severe condi-
tions with a high possibility of depression. These states were
estimated via statements posted on SNS.
F. Structure of The Paper
The paper is organized as follows: Section2 gives related
works corresponding to our study. In Section 3, we show the
overview of proposed system. In Section 4, the features of
the Twitter users targeted for research are explained. Section
5 describes how to quantify the features of Twitter users and
how to evaluate them. In Section 6, we present our method
for ﬁnding the optimal interactions of Twitter users based
on evaluation method we deﬁned. In Section 7, we show
the results of computer simulations using the method set up
in Section 6. In Section 8, we provide a discussion of the
simulation results, and in Section 9, we conclude and discuss
future work.
II. RELATED WORKS
In this section, we will present the effects on the mind and
the Twitter-based recommendation system as they relate to our
research.
A. Effects on the mind
Tsukawa et al. [6] studied data from remarks on Twitter
to diagnose depression. They used the Zung score [7], a
depression evaluation index obtained using an advance ques-
tionnaire, and performed a multiple-regression analysis using
the frequency of words detected by a morphological analysis
of tweets from 50 subjects. Among detected words, negative
words showed a high correlation with the Zung score. A mod-
erate correlation (correlation coefﬁcient R = 0.45) appeared
between the score obtained by the regression equation and the
Zung score. Considering the number of samples, this result
seems valid, so it should be possible to diagnose depression
symptoms using tweets.
One study of college students indicated that a long usage
history or a high degree of dependence made people seem
unhappier than others [8]. Researchers also stated this ten-
dency would be strong among unacquainted people. On the
other hand, almost no relationship exists between SNS usage
duration and stress or depression when targeting SNSs while
excluding Instagram [9]. The stress load depends on the quality
of communication with other people.
Fig. 1. System ﬂow.
B. Twitter-based recommendation systems
Chen et al. [10] proposed a system that recommends useful
tweets to Twitter users. The system provides collaborative-
ﬁltering-based recommendations via tweet content, social rela-
tionships, and other explicitly deﬁned user data generally used
as indicators of a tweet’s usefulness. This system provided
better recommendations than previous methods.
Research focused on followers has also indicated that
follower-adding patterns can help predict who the user will
follow next [11]. Another system considered users’ emotions
in recommendations focused on users’ interests [12]. The
researchers implemented better recommendations for the user
by including functions with positive, negative, and neutral
parameters in the evaluation axis.
All these studies aimed to efﬁciently select useful informa-
tion for users from the large amount of information ﬂooding
the SNS.
III. SYSTEM OVERVIEW
In the proposed system, we obtain information from target
users whose tweets contain keywords related to depression.
The tweets are then analyzed and mood disorder levels are
assigned to individual users in three phases. The ﬁrst phase is
conducting a morphological analysis of the tweets to determine
the emotional polarity value. The second is quantifying the
user’s characteristics based on the emotional polarity value.
The third is clustering users to improve the optimization by
grouping users with similar characteristics. The second and
third phases depend on the ﬁrst phase’s results, but they are
not mutually dependent. Finally, these data are formulated as
a knapsack problem, and the optimal solution is computed.
Figure 1 shows the ﬂow of our method.
IV. TARGET USERS
Target users include the following words in their tweets:
1) “languid” or “melancholic”
2) medicine names related to depression
The number of users who included the keywords “lan-
guid” (‘da-ru-i’ in Japanese) or “melancholic” (‘yu-u-tsu’
in Japanese) in their tweets was insufﬁcient, so the names

of 27 drugs related to mood disorder treatment, such as
antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and anxiolytics, were added
to the keywords to collect data. Twitter API was used for data
collection, and a maximum of 3200 tweets per user (upper
limit) were obtained. For each level of mood disorder, 500
user accounts were collected. Data were collected in February
2019.
V. DATA ANALYSIS AND DEFINITION
In this section, we will present a method for quantifying
and evaluating the features of Twitter users.
A. Emotional polarity of tweets
The tweets were split into word data for each noun of
a sentence using MeCab [13], a morphological analyzer.
Japanese tweets must be morphologically analyzed because
Japanese sentences have no explicit separators, such as spaces
in English. Word data are quantiﬁed using the emotion polarity
table [14], a database generated by a system that estimates
a word’s emotional polarity (desirability or non-desirability),
with a ﬂoating number from -1 to +1 associated with the word.
Values close to +1 are generally more desirable, and values
close to -1 are less desirable; values close to 0 are neutral.
Words not included in this database are considered 0.
B. Evaluation function of user’s emotional polarity
1) Classiﬁcation of mood disorder level: Based on the
emotional polarity values, a user’s mood disorder level was
set from 0 to 3, and the user was classiﬁed into one of four
classes. Research on mood disorders, especially depression, is
active and many diagnostic scales exist for them. However,
most scales are subjective, use questionnaires, and are not
appropriate for objective assessments based on tweet data.
Non-anonymous computer mediated communication (CMC)
has less effect on users than does face-to-face communication
because CMC has fewer channels compared to communication
in real spaces [15]. However, people with mood disorders are
inﬂuenced by others’ remarks, especially negative remarks.
Thus, positivity should be transmitted differently depending
on users’ symptom levels. We therefore classiﬁed the mood
disorder states according to the rules in Figure 1.
The classiﬁcation involved the following steps. First, target
users were divided into two groups. Group A’s tweets con-
tained names of medications for mood disorders, and Group
B’s tweets did not. Then, each group was further divided into
two groups. In Group A, users whose tweets contained two or
more names of medications for mood disorders were classiﬁed
as Level 3, the highest level. The remaining Group A users
were classiﬁed as Level 2, the second highest level of mood
disorder. Among the members of Group B, users whose tweets
contained the words “languid” and “melancholic” less than
3% of the total tweets were classiﬁed as Level 0, the lowest
level of mood disorder. The remaining Group B users were
classiﬁed as Level 1, the second lowest level. Figure 2 shows
the ﬂow of users.
Fig. 2. The classiﬁcation of users.
2) Deﬁning the evaluation function: We deﬁned the fol-
lowing evaluation function based on the hypothesis that a user
with a tendency toward a mood disorder would be suitable for
communicating with a user who has a similar mood disorder
level and who offers many positive comments.
Pos(k, m) = posk
negk
{1.0 + α ∗ (nk − m)}
where
k : Index of user
posk : Positive value of userk
negk : Negative value of userk
nk : Mood disorder level of userk
m : Mood disorder level of main user
This evaluation function is named the positive function,
which quantiﬁes the degree of individual positivity and con-
siders differences in mood disorder levels. α is a constant and
is speciﬁed, so the function’s value becomes positive. The
values of the function 1.0 + α(n − m) for α = 1/4 and for
1/6 appear in Figure 3.

VI. OPTIMIZATION
In this section, we will present a method for optimizing
Twitter users’ interactions using the knapsack problem.

A. Combinatorial Optimization Problems
Combinatorial optimization cannot be solved in a practical
amount of computation time for a large-scale problem. This is
especially critical for huge social networking sites like Twitter.
For the knapsack problem among combinatorial optimization
problems, however, a method to quickly obtain an approxi-
mate solution using the surrogate constraint method has been
developed [16]. The surrogate constraint method generates
a single constraint function by weighting multiple constraint
functions, and a method for calculating the optimal weights
has also been established [17]. We used this calculation
method to quickly obtain an approximate solution to the single
constrained knapsack problem via the algorithm [18].
B. Nonlinear knapsack problem
The multi-constraint nonlinear knapsack problem is formu-
lated as follows.
maximize
X
i∈N
fi(xi)
subject to
gj(x) =
X
i∈N
gji(xi) ≤ bj(j = 1, 2, · · · , m),
xj ∈ Aj(j = 1, 2, · · · , m),
where N
= {1, 2, . . . , n} is a set of variable numbers,
x = {x1, x2, . . . , xn} and Ai = {1, 2, . . . , ai}(i ∈ N) is the
alternative item set for each variable.
C. Knapsack computation model
To calculate the optimal connections for a user, we deﬁned a
nonlinear knapsack-type computational model of Twitter user
data. Each user has an emotional polarity value, and users with
similar values were grouped into the same class, as shown in
Figure 4.
Fig. 4. Make a knapsack model.
The objective function and the inequalities for constraint
function are as follows:
maximize
X
i∈N
Pos(xi, m)
subject to
g1(x) =
X
i∈N
g1(xi) ≤ b1
g2(x) =
X
i∈N
g2(xi) ≤ b2
where
g1(xk) =
(
1,
member selected in Group k
0,
nobody selected
g2(xk) = days per tweet of user xk
The function Pos() is deﬁned at V-B2. N = {1, 2, . . . , n}
is a set of group numbers, x = {x1, x2, . . . , xn} is a set of
members of the group.b1 is the upper limit for the number of
connected users. b2 is the upper limit for the tweet frequency,
which depends on b1. Thus, b2 = (days per tweet) × b1.
VII. COMPUTATIONAL EXPERIMENT
In this section, we will present a computational simulation
of our proposed method.
A. Creating problem data
1) Setting the positive function: As a parameter of the
positivity function, the user’s mood disorder level (m) was set
to 3. For α, which represents the weight of the mood disorder
level on the positivity level, we set α = 1
4 and = 1
6.
2) Setting the knapsack problem: We created the problem
data according to the model deﬁned in the previous section. A
total of 2000 target users were selected, with 500 for each
of the four mood disorder levels. At each level, the 500
users were sorted by the magnitude of their emotional polarity
values and then divided into 50 groups of 10 users each in a
descending order. It is possible to choose one person from each
group or no one from any group. In other words, we created a
nonlinear knapsack problem with 50 (=500/10) variables and
with 11 choices in each group: 10 ways to choose a member
plus a way to choose no one. The whole problem comprises
50 groups with 4 levels, for a total of 200 groups.
The ﬁrst constraint (b1) is the number of users with connec-
tions, and we created four types: 20, 40, 60, and 80. The sec-
ond constraint(b2) is the number of days per tweet(dpr)×b1,
where dpr is 1
2 or 1
5. We assume that users who tweet twice
a day are casual users, and users who tweet ﬁve times a day
are heavy users.
3) Total number of problems: There were 2 types of param-
eters for the positive function and 4(b1)×2(b2) combinations
regarding the knapsack problem’s constraints, yielding 16 total
types of problems.
B. Computation results
The calculations for each problem appear in tables I to table
IV. * 1: not mood disorder, * 2: early mood disorder, * 3: mild
mood disorder, and * 4 severe mood disorder.

VIII. DISCUSSION
In this section, we will discuss the results of computational
simulations.
A. Computational results
We proposed a method for optimizing a user’s connections
with other users according to the mood disorder level. Based
on the optimization results, the optimal solution is 1) to
connect users with a similar mood disorder level when a user
desires connections with heavy users, and 2) to connect with
others at various levels from 1 (early mood disorder) to 3
(severe mood disorder) when the user desires connections with
casual users.
In connecting with heavy users, we anticipate that the
amount a user communicates with a particular person will
increase and that the user will spend much time browsing
Twitter to see what they are up to. In other words, if users want
to communicate deeply for a long time, they should engage
with people at a similar mood disorder level. In the case of
α = 1
6, the above characteristics appeared in users preferring
to connect with casual users and with heavy users. In the case
of a larger α(=
1
4), however, these characteristics appeared
stronger.
A comparison between heavy users and casual users shows
that users with severe mood disorders (Level 3) often tweet
frequently, and many Level-0 users had fewer tweets per day
than Level-3 users. On the other hand, users who connect
with casual users have shorter visits to Twitter. Therefore,
connecting with people of various mood disorder levels is
considered optimal. This observation aligns with the difference
between using Twitter for communication and using it for
information gathering.
When we want to get to know other people deeply, we gain
a sense of security by connecting with people in situations
similar to ours. When we want a shallow relationship with
people, we gain diverse ideas by connecting with people who
have diverse situations and personalities.
B. About the system
1) Knapsack problematization: Although combinatorial op-
timization problems are generally hard to compute, we quickly
obtained a solution using an approximate solution method in
the knapsack problem. This should be sufﬁcient for developing
applications that run at a practical speed. In this study, we
used the positive function value to group the users. Various
clustering methods can be used to group users via indicators
such as personality and knowledge traits, which will increase
the scope of the analysis.
2) Evaluation function: In this study, we deﬁned a positive
function as an evaluation function. The difference in the
computational results between heavy users and casual users
suggests the positive function worked well.
However, the sentiment polarity dictionary required for the
positive function was created based on WordNet [19] words, so
the performance of the dictionary may not be sufﬁcient in the
SNS world, where abbreviations and new words are created
every day (such as on Twitter).
Developing a sentiment polarity dictionary based on word
variance information on Twitter should be considered to im-
prove evaluation function. Because of the wide variety of
user characteristics and purposes of use in practice, multiple
evaluation axes [20] should be considered instead of using a
single polarity of positive/negative.
C. Limitation
We used the Twitter API’s keyword search to obtain users’
data. The ﬁrst search did not provide sufﬁcient information,
so search words were appended later. In this regard, the data
collection method is somewhat inconsistent.
We conducted an additional study to estimate users with de-
pressive tendencies and obtained data from 1,008,618 proﬁles
from the followers and friends of 100 tweeters. The data were
obtained from a keyword search for “depression” (‘u-tsu’ in
Japanese Kanji). The number of users who had sentences in
their proﬁles that could indicate they were depressed was 882.

By more carefully observing their tweets and their interac-
tion relationships, we should make more accurate estimates of
mood disorder levels. Correlations between mood disorder lev-
els and positive functions, as well as other statistical analyses,
must be studied to show a valid estimation method.
D. Summary
Using this study’s proposed system, we show the possibility
of designing an optimal way for users to connect with other
users. This system reveals to users the best way to interact
with other people.
If this approach can be realized, the system could reduce
mood disorders and provide support for healthy reintegration
into society by using the online resource of SNS.
IX. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we analyzed tweet data from about 2,000
Twitter accounts and calculated positive and negative values
for individual users using an emotional polarity dictionary. We
also estimated the mood disorder degree using the vocabulary
in the tweets and classiﬁed the users into four mood disorder
levels. A positive function was also deﬁned based on the
assumption that statements from other users with similar or
more severe mood disorders would positively affect the user.
Next, we created a computational model of the knapsack-
problem type using these characteristics. We then simulated
the optimal community environment for users with mood dis-
orders by solving the problem. From the results, we assumed
that a user with a high-level mood disorder who wanted to
interact with users who tweeted frequently should optimally
follow people with the same level of mood disorder as the user.
On the other hand, we inferred that a user with a high-level
mood disorder who wanted to interact with casual users who
tweeted infrequently should optimally connect with people
who have various levels of mood disorder.
These estimations can be made in a practical computation
time, suggesting the possibility of developing an interactive
user-recommendation system. Considering actual use, how-
ever, a uniﬁed evaluation function is inappropriate because
individual users have different purposes for using SNS. There-
fore, a system that dynamically generates an evaluation func-
tion according to a user’s purpose and values is necessary.
For future work, we want to examine our proposed system’s
validity and consider systems that can help people with mood
disorders. For users without mood disorders, we should also
research SNS uses that allow them to enjoy their social
networking life to the fullest while maintaining their mental
health. Slandering behavior, ﬂaming, and polarization are
major social issues in modern SNS use. SNSs are a powerful
tool for knowledge acquisition and communication, and it is
important to use SNSs well instead of running from them.
