Abstract—This 
paper 
describes 
significant 
cost 
saving 
opportunities for consumers in developing countries by the use 
of computational intelligence and demand-side-management 
techniques to mitigate the massive use of diesel back-up during 
grid outages. We propose novel statistical algorithms to model 
electricity outages, heavy diesel use and associated customer 
energy costs in developing countries. Using a blackout 
simulator and Monte Carlos analysis, we assess the impact of 
different blackout types such as scheduled, unscheduled and 
annual forecasted outages on consumer energy costs. Variables 
for the analysis included time of outage (morning, evening 
etc.), duration of outage (1-5 hours), Diesel costs (20cents/KW-
hr) and type of outage. We found that cost savings 
opportunities by the use of demand side management to 
mitigate outages can exceed 30% in many cases.

 INTRODUCTION 
Consumers in developing countries are faced with 
major challenges with the power grid such as rampant grid 
outages (Table 1), unreliable power quality with fluctuating 
voltages and power, uncertain grid restoration schedules, 
etc. Consumers need to invest heavily in back-up systems 
(e.g., diesel) and often pay as much as 40-50% of their 
monthly power bills on back-up diesel costs [1-3]. The 
customer is often faced with difficult decisions such as 
whether compromise and curtail his loads or pay high costs 
of diesel to run his normal loads. There is a lack of 
computational tools to effectively predict, manage and 
optimize back-up systems in countries such as India. Also, 
there is a lack of demand side management approaches to 
help the consumer to mitigate outages. This study has two 
goals: one, to statistically model and understand the energy 
cost behavior caused by a stochastic grid and second, to 
define the maximum cost-savings potential by the use of 
demand-side-management techniques.  
 
Risk management for power outages is an enormous 
challenge for consumers in a developing country. There is 
the value of lost load, which is essentially the loss that the 
consumer suffers on account of unsupplied power. The 
back-up system needs a large capital and recurring operating 
expenditures. Managing resources such as diesel storage, 
scheduling factory operations with built-in grid-fail-safe 
systems, providing adequate and expensive equipment 
protection including cascading power failures are commonly 
encountered issues. While diesel generators offer a simple 
and effective solution, there are many challenges that the 
emerging market customer needs to address. These mainly 
include optimal sizing of the diesel systems, minimizing op-
ex costs by intelligent forecasting, risk mitigation by proper 
resource allocation etc. Figure 1 shows a typical model for a 
grid wherein all the system parameters (power quality, 
system voltages consumer loads) behave as statistical 
distributions. Furthermore, one also finds that all dependent 
parameters such as economic metrics (cost) behave 
similarly. In this study, we are exploring the use of normal 
distributions for all system parameters. The paper first 
proposes a novel approach to model grid outages using 
different computational techniques, analyzes impact of 
different outage scenarios on a home consumer and 
characterize the high energy costs to the consumer by use of 
diesel. Finally, as a means to cut this high cost, we 
recommend the use of load optimization or demand-side 
management and assess the maximum potential savings 
possible.

LITERATURE SURVEY 
 
Several studies have focused on the impact of 
unreliable grids as seen in the following works: An in-depth 
investigation into the impact of power outages for 
consumers and businesses in Africa is performed in [4]. 
This study also assesses the economic consequences of the 
unreliable grids. A report on real power cost in India [5] 
reveals that the overall intent of providing cheap and 
affordable power to the consumers in the country is noble, 
but if the supplies are inadequate or unreliable, the 
consumers could actually end up paying a much higher 
price. 
 
A report from United Nations [6] provides directions to 
expand access of modern energy services at the household 
level. An application of combined model of extrapolation 
and correlation techniques for short term load forecasting of 
an Indian substation is presented in [7]. Specific 
opportunities for DSM in the Indian scenario are presented 
in [8]. Low-cost energy generation using bio-mechanical 
energy is presented in [9] and this provides technology 
options for both off-grid users as well as on-grid users who 
have unreliable power. Specific demand-side-management 
techniques to mitigate power outages are proposed and 
assessed in [10]. There is enormous body of literature on the 
use of demand side management algorithms for power and 
cost optimization for the end consumer as follows. The use 
of casual scheduling loads with time-varying prices using 
stochastic dynamic programming is studied in [11] and its 
effect on consumer cost are reported. In [13], a power 
scheduling protocol for demand response in smart grid 
system is explored which focuses on limiting the allowable 
power loads. Algorithmic enhancements to a scheduler for 
residential DSM are presented in [15]. 
The problem of excessive power outages, its impact to 
the consumer and mitigation strategies need to be addressed 
as it is a major painpoint to consumers in developing 
countries. There are no published algorithmic works that 
predict the diesel requirements under periodic and rampant 
outages such as seen in emerging countries.  There is also a 
lack of computation methods in the literature that tackle the 
problem of load-optimization or demand-response during 
outage. In this study, we develop computational methods 
that specifically focus on power outages and quantify their 
impact using different statistical means. Furthermore, we 
show the potential savings possible through the use of load 
optimization.

SIMULATION APPROACH 
Computational methods used in the present study are 
described here. To assess different blackout scenarios, a 
blackout assessment tool is developed (Fig. 2(a)). In this 
study, we have explored the use of normal distributions to 
model the different statistical parameters. Based on our data 
gathered from 20 households in India, normal distribution 
appears to fit the data well. The types of power outage 
scenarios 
modeled 
we 
studied 
include: 
scheduled, 
unscheduled and long-term historic forecast. For each case, 
we study the timing (time of day) and duration of power 
outage. For long-term forecast analysis, since one does not 
know that actual distribution of electricity outage, 
combinatorial algorithms are developed to determine the 
maximum cost impact. Statistical estimation methods such 
as Poisson estimation, Monte-Carlo limit analysis are built-
in the tool for cost benefit analysis. Output parameters for 
the tool are statistical distributions for consumer load profile, 
daily energy consumption, energy costs (e.g. grid cost, 
diesel cost, daily energy cost), power outages (duration and 
length), effective cost of power etc.

The key outcomes of the tool are as follows. First, the 
statistical impact of an unpredictable and uncertain grid 
combined with usage of diesel back-up is evaluated to 
determine the actual consumer cost of energy use. Second, 
maximum cost savings potential that can be achieved by the 
use of demand-side-management techniques is reported. In 
the fast analysis tool, the user can select the desired blackout 
scenario. For example, to perform a scheduled blackout 
analysis, the user can input a fixed power outage time in a 
day. The blackout profile is then generated using the user 
input and the analysis and sensitivity modeling is performed 
using the cost inputs. An unscheduled power outage can be 
triggered in a given timeframe or if the user desires, the tool 
can automatically select create unscheduled outages. Large 
numbers of profiles (10000) are created for each 
configuration. 
For long-term forecasting, the analysis requires 
knowledge of historical data. Since most cities in emerging 
markets do not have organized historical blackout data, a 
typical power outage profile for a year (Fig. 2(b)) is created 
for this study. Actual historic data can be input into the tool 
as required. The Poisson estimator is used to determine the 
expectation value of blackout duration in a given day. Since 
the number of ways that this power outage can be 
distributed in a day is extremely large, the tool uses a 
combinatorial methodology to allocate the distribution of 
the blackout. This method is based on the classic balls and 
bins allocation problem wherein each of the n balls is 
allocated to a set of m bins in a random, but uniformly 
distributed, way. The algorithm developed uses an iterative 
solver combined with a random distributor. The user can 
generate the specified number of distributions for the 
required design of experiments. In this study, it was found 
that 500 iterations are sufficient to provide statistically 
meaningful data. Nominal costs assumed for the grid is 
5c/KWhr and baseline diesel costs assumed in the 
simulation are 20c/KWhr. The standard deviations assumed 
are approximately 10%. Sensitivity analysis is performed 
for diesel cost ratio from 1X to 3X from current diesel costs.  
It is useful to calculate an effective cost parameter, Ceff, 
which captures the net cost of power to the customer. For a 
typical supply configuration with the grid and a diesel 
system, this would provide an average combined cost per 
unit for the customer. This is valuable to the customer as it 
provides a way for the customer to quickly estimate his 
costs, provide insight into quality of the grid by 
understanding the deviation of cost w.r.t. to the grid ad 
provide a benchmark and standardized method to compare 
grid stability and quality across customers and geographical 
regions. This effective cost parameter can be represented as,  
CEFF  = Daily Cost Per Day/ Energy Consumption 
 = (Grid + Diesel Cost)/Energy Consumption 
IV. 
 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The key results of this study are presented in this 
section. From the consumer viewpoint, several parameters 
are of interest such as load distribution, distribution of 
electricity outage duration and timing, daily energy 
expenditure and increase in energy cost due to diesel usage, 
fraction of load executed during outage, and finally, the 
maximum cost savings possible by applying demand-side-
management. Baseline cost data for running the loads on 
grid power are shown in Figure 3 for an Indian home 
consumer. Sample results from analysis of scheduled power 
outages are presented in Fig. 4. Herein, we show the results 
for an outage scenario of 5 hours commencing at 12PM. In 
all, four different outage start times are simulated and for 
each, the duration of power outage is varied statistically. 
The average cost of energy is roughly 2X grid cost (fig. 
4(a)) and diesel expenditure (Fig. 4(b)) as a fraction of total 
energy cost is approximately 66% which is significant. 
Again, the rise in daily energy cost is a 100% over a grid-
only cost.

Figure 5 provides further details on the consumer cost 
and load execution patterns for a residential consumer as a 
function of the outage time. A power failure during 
afternoon has the largest impact on consumer costs, 
followed by morning and evening times. For an outage that 
is 5 hours long, the maximum load executed is as much as 
35% of total daily load and for cases wherein the blackout 
times are <5 hours, the load fraction can be as high as 25%. 
An important finding is that in order to execute only 15% of 
the daily load, the consumer spends as much as 40% of 
daily total energy cost (Fig. 5(b)). For most power outage 
scenarios simulated the consumer pays ~40% over the 
normal grid-only costs for load execution. To execute 30% 
of the daily load, the consumer cost increases by 2X 
compared to the baseline case. In other words, a customer in 
a developing country could spend half of his power 
expenditure for back-up power during peak seasons when 
the power outages are incessant. The ratio of diesel costs 
over the total cost ranges from a typical value of 35% to 
65% per day. Maximum diesel usage is either at 7AM or 
12PM.

 Next, we consider the cases of unscheduled power 
outages wherein the timing and duration of the outage are 
random variables (Fig. 6, Table 2). It must be stated that 
unscheduled power outage generator model needs to be 
calibrated with local grid conditions and measurements to 
provide accurate results. In this study, two types of 
unscheduled 
power 
outages 
are 
simulated. 
First, 
unscheduled power outage distributed through the day as 
multiple outages and second, the unscheduled random 
power cuts are limited to a part of the day. Both these 
scenarios are fairly common in developing countries. As 
described earlier, a random variable generator is used to 
simulate the unscheduled power outage scenario. In our 
model, the average unscheduled power generated is 4.9 
hours per day. Unlike scheduled outages, it is difficult to 
execute power saving approaches such as demand side 
management during unscheduled blackouts due to its 
random nature. Stochastic modeling combined with machine 
learning to refine the predictive models can potentially be 
used to address the problem of unscheduled power outage 
management.

Finally, we show that the high power back-up costs due 
to use of diesel during electricity outages can be 
significantly mitigated through the use of intelligent 
scheduling or demand-side-management (DSM) techniques 
such as load shifting, peak-shaving and valley-filling. These 
techniques enable the user to execute the full load 
requirement with simultaneous cost savings. Since grid 
power is typically inexpensive, the purpose of the demand-
side-management method is to shift the loads to the grid 
when it is available. As a result, the maximum cost savings 
potential is calculated when the entire load is shifted outside 
the power outage region and executed on grid power. 
However, in reality, the actual savings will be dictated by 
the specific distribution of schedulable and interruptible 
loads. The present data provides an upper limit achievable 
for the demand response schemes and the actual 
implementation of the DSM during power outages is 
presented in [10]. The maximum potential savings possible 
is generally upwards of 30% for most cases modeled (Table 
3) and maximum DSM gains are possible when the power 
outage occurs during the afternoon. Measure of the grid cost 
disparity is given in Table 4 through the effective cost 
parameter. The efficiency of a demand-side management 
scheme is measured by how close the effective parameter is 
to the grid cost. For most cases in the present study, the grid 
disparity ranges from 1.5X to 2X the cost of per unit of grid 
power. Table 5 shows the sensitivity analysis using an 
increasing cost of diesel (varied from 1X to 3X to the 
current cost of diesel). The energy costs, based on this 
sensitivity analysis, show that, the effective cost of power 
can be upwards of four times the cost of a grid supported 
load. Such high costs can currently be seen in remote 
locations wherein availability and accessibility to diesel fuel 
is a challenge.  As expected, the corresponding potential for 
load optimization is also high.  
 
      Long-term forecasting using historical data enables 
system planners to mitigate business risks due to grid 
uncertainty. Unfortunately, such historical data is largely not 
available except for a few areas. It is anticipated that upon 
the advent of the smart grid, highly localized behavior 
models of the grid will be available for the customer. In this 
study, we show a methodology to analyze historical data to 
predict annual diesel estimates for the consumer. Using 
combinatorial algorithms, one can generate different 
blackout scenarios. The costs are calculated for each 
individual case and statistical analysis is performed on the 
entire set of data. This is used to forecast diesel projections 
for an entire year as represented in Fig. 7. Overall, in 
summer months of May till November, users incur heavy 
cost due to power outages.

CONCLUSIONS 
 
Computational intelligence methods are used to explore 
the problem of rampant power outages and associated high 
diesel back-up costs in developing countries. Using 
consumer load profiles, outage information and energy cost 
information, we show that in order to execute only 15% of 
the daily load, the consumer spends as much as 40% of the 
daily total energy cost. Further, to execute 30% of the daily 
load, the consumer cost roughly doubles. That is, a customer 
in a developing country could spend half of his power 
expenditure for back-up power during peak seasons when 
the power outages are incessant. In the case of unscheduled 
outages caused by random system failures, Monte Carlo 
analysis shows that the cost impact to the customer can be 
anywhere as much as 60% more than normal operation. 
Similar behavior is also seen for annual forecasting of 
power outages and consumer costs. Assessment of the 
maximum 
cost-savings 
potential 
using 
demand-side-
management methods is seen to be huge and upwards of 
30%.
