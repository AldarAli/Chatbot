Abstract— We are now on the verge of the next technical 
revolution – robots are going to invade our lives. However, to 
interact with humans or to be incorporated into a human 
“collective” robots have to be provided with some human-like 
cognitive abilities. What does it mean? – Nobody knows. But, 
robotics research communities are trying hard to find out a 
way to cope with this problem. Meanwhile, despite abundant 
funding these efforts did not lead to any meaningful result 
(only in Europe, only in the past ten years, Cognitive Robotics 
research funding has reached a ceiling of 1.39 billion euros). In 
the next ten years, a similar budget is going to be spent to 
tackle the Cognitive Robotics problems in the frame of the 
Human Brain Project. There is no reason to expect that this 
time the result will be different. We would like to try to explain 
why we are so unhappy about this.  
Keywords – Cognitive robotics; information; physical infor-
mation;  semantic information. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION  
From the beginning, it was a fascinating idea: to create 
human-like living beings that would help and assist us in 
our tedious everyday duties. The history has preserved many 
famous stories about such undertakings – Pygmalion and his 
Galatea, Talos the guard of Crete (both from the ancient 
Greek mythology), Maharal’s Golem from the late 16th 
century Prague, Frankenstein’s monster of the early 19th 
century. 
In the year 1920, that was Karel Capek who gave them 
their present-day name – Robots. In 1942, Isaac Azimov 
was the first who introduced the term – Robotics. In 1959, 
the first real, not imagined and not legendary, industrial 
robot had entered the factory floor and, strictly speaking, 
has heralded the beginning of the robotics era. Then, at the 
end of the past century, robots start to appear in our human 
surroundings. 
It has immediately become clear that, to work with 
humans (in cooperation and in tight interaction with them), 
robots have to possess some human-like cognitive abilities. 
What does it mean “to possess human-like cognitive 
abilities”? – Nobody knew then, nobody knows today. But 
that does not matter – the robotics research community 
enthusiastically started to cope with the challenge, endorsed 
with ample budget funding provided by the USA Defence 
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the 
European Union Research and Technological Development 
(EU RTD) programme. We would like to provide a short 
account of these efforts. 
II. 
MARCH TO THE GLORIOUS FUTURE 
As it was just said above, the DARPA in USA and the 
European Commission in Europe are today the most 
prominent supporters of scientific and technological 
progress, which are operating worldwide and are promoting 
an extensive range of critically important research initiatives. 
In the past 10-15 years, Cognitive Robotics was certainly 
one among them. 
A. DARPA’s Projects on Cognitive Robotics  
The DARPA has always posited itself as an authority 
aimed to address a wide range of technological 
opportunities directed to meet the national security 
challenges. Endorsed with a budget of up to $2.8 billion (in 
FY 2013), it pursues its objectives through a wide range of 
R&D programs [1]. Cognitive Robotics does not appear in 
DARPA’s programme as a bundle of programs grouped by a 
common theme; on the contrary, in DARPA’s practice 
Cognitive Robotics is handled as a collection of separate 
programs that share a common target issue. The list of 
Cognitive 
Robotics 
and 
Cognitive-Robotics-related 
programs launched in the years 2001-2013 can be seen in 
Table I. 
DARPA’s efforts on robotics are focused primarily on 
military and defence-related applications with a clear goal to 
bring real-time, integrated, multi-source intelligence to the 
battlefield. DARPA does not strive to replace the warrior 
with a robot, but it believes that it is possible to improve the 
abilities 
of 
individual 
warfighter 
by 
combining 
technological achievements with human brain cognitive 
capacities thus making information understanding and 
decision-making far more effective and efficient for military 
users. So, it tries hard, on one hand, to revolutionize the 
underlying technologies (for unmanned sensor systems and 
battlefield information gathering) and, on the other hand, to 
merge them with the next generation computational systems 
that will have some human-like cognitive capabilities (such 
as reasoning and learning capabilities) and levels of 
autonomy which are beyond those of the today’s systems. 
The spectrum of programs presented in Table I reliably 
represents this DARPA’s approach to Cognitive Robotics 
R&D.

B. The European programs on Cognitive Robotics 
European Union research is conducted in a frame of 
research programmes called Framework Programmes for 
Research and Technological Development, in short 
Framework Programmes farther abbreviated as FP1 to FP8.  
Cognitive Robotics related issues start to appear in the 
FP5 programme and then, respectively, continue to evolve 
and expand in the following FP6 and FP7 work programmes. 
Contrary to DARPA’s approach, EU R&D activities are 
clustered to several main “themes” that are further 
segmented into “challenges”, which are further divided into 
“objectives” in frame of which the individual projects are 
carried out. Cognitive Robotics in the Frame Programmes 
FP6 and FP7 is represented as a Challenge (Challenge 2) of 
the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) 
theme (Theme 3). At the time of the transition from FP5 to 
FP6, when subdivision to Challenges was not yet introduced, 
Cognitive Robotics and its related issues such as Cognitive 
Vision and four other particular items appear straight as 
objectives in the Information Society Technologies (IST) 
theme (see Table II).

Juxtaposing Table II, Table III, and Table IV, it can be 
seen how from a Cognitive Vision objective in FP5 (a 
Cognitive Robotics related topic) Cognitive Robotics has 
evolved to a full-blown Challenge (Challenge 2) in the FP6 
and FP7 programmes, steadily growing from 190 M€ in FP5 
to near 1.2 billion euros in the next FP6 and FP7 
programmes (435 M€ for FP6 + 768 M€ for FP7).  
 
III. 
DECEIVED EXPECTATIONS  
During all these times, the declared goals of Cognitive 
Robotics programmes were: (As it follows from DARPA’s 
News Releases) “to create adaptable, integrated intelligence 
systems aimed to augment intelligence analysts’ capabilities 
to support time-sensitive operations on the battlefield” [11]. 
And in another document – “The objectives (of DARPA’s 
programs) are not to replace human analysts, but to make 
them more effective and efficient by reducing their 
cognitive load and enabling them to search for activities and 
threats quickly and easily” [12]. 
Objectives of Challenge 2 programs in the EU research 
initiative have been far more ambitious – The FP6 
Workprogramme for years 2003-2004 states: (The objective 
is) “to construct physically instantiated or embodied systems 
that can perceive, understand (the semantics of information 
conveyed through their perceptual input) and interact with 
their environment, and evolve in order to achieve human-
like performance in activities requiring context-(situation 
and task) specific knowledge, etc. The development of 
cognitive robots whose “purpose in life” would be to serve 
humans as assistants or “companions”. Such robots would 
be able to learn new skills and tasks in an active open-ended 
way and to grow in constant interaction and co-operation 
with humans” [4]. 
These objectives (almost in similar words) are repeatedly 
declared in all further Work programmes. For example, the 
2011-2012 Workprogramme says that in these words: 
“Challenge 2 focuses on artificial cognitive systems and 
robots that operate in dynamic, nondeterministic, real-life 
environments… Actions under this Challenge support 
research on engineering robotic systems and on endowing 
artificial systems with cognitive capabilities” [8]. 
Careful examination of the outcome that results from 
both the DARPA’s programs and from the FP5-FP7 
objectives leads to a univocal conclusion – the announced 
goals of all these programs have never been reached! 
The explanation of this phenomenon is very simple – 
people try to provide robots with human-like cognitive 
abilities, but at the same time the same people are devoid of 
even a slightest understanding about what does the notion of 
“human-like cognitive abilities” really mean. 
During the past years, the problem has become obvious 
and has been even mentioned in the 2011-2012 
Workprogramme: “Hard scientific and technological 
research issues still need to be tackled in order to make 
robots fit for rendering high-quality services, or for flexible 
manufacturing scenarios. Sound theories are requisite to 
underpinning the development of robotic systems and 
providing pertinent design paradigms, also informed by 
studies of natural cognitive systems (as in the neuro- and 
behavioural 
sciences) 
[8].

Even more definite was the statement of the year 2013 
Work programme – “An additional research focus targeted 
under this challenge will address symbiotic human-machine 
relations, which aims at a deeper understanding of human 
behaviour during interaction with ICT, going beyond 
conventional approaches. The work on cognitive systems 
and smart spaces and on symbiotic human-machine relations 
is not restricted to robotics” [13]. 
 This promise was also left unfulfilled. At the end of 2013, 
Cognitive Robotics research has moved to and has tightened 
itself with the human brain research activities. 
IV. 
NEW HOPES 
At the beginning of year 2014, both Europe and USA will 
launch ambitious programmes for human brain research. In 
the USA, the programme is called the Brain Research 
through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) 
Initiative and it was announced by President Barack Obama 
on April 2013. Its accomplishment will be led by the 
National Institutes of Health (NIH), DARPA, and the 
National Science Foundation (NSF) [14]. 
In Europe, the Human Brain Project is a ten-year project, 
consisting of a thirty-month ramp-up phase, funded under 
FP7, with support from a special flagship ERANET, and a 
ninety-month operational phase, to be funded under Horizon 
2020 programme. The project, which will have a total 
budget of over 1 billion Euros, is European-led with a strong 
element of international cooperation. The goal of the project 
is to build a completely new ICT infrastructure for 
neuroscience, and for brain-related research in medicine and 
computing, catalysing a global collaborative effort to 
understand the human brain and its diseases and ultimately 
to emulate its computational capabilities [15]. 
The main features of the two projects are collected in the 
Table V. 
As it follows from the Table V, Cognitive Robotics is not 
among the main goals of the two Flagship initiatives, but it 
is definitely among their main purposes. In the European 
Human Brain Project it appears as the “Cognitive 
Architectures” line in the list of the HBP topics. In the 
American BRAIN Project Cognitive Robotics issues are 
hidden behind the “Link neuronal activity to behaviour” 
topic. 
V. 
AN ATTEMPT TO PREDICT THE FUTURE 
In attempt to predict the future results of these two 
projects, let us juxtapose them with something that is well 
known to us and that we are quite familiar with. We mean 
the enduring and persistent study of National Economics. 
While the human nervous system can be seen as the driving 
force behind the behaviour of a single human, national 
economics can be seen as the driving force behind the 
behaviour of a whole human society. Both are complex 
distributed systems whose efficient operation is supported 
by an all-embracing communication system. In the Human 
brain that is the Nervous system, in the National Economics 
this is the Transportation system. 
From Table VI, one can see that the principal features of 
the Transportation system are well reflected in both brain 
research projects. Only one feature “What is being 
transported?” is missing in the future brain studies. A proper 
answer to the question “What is being transported in the 
Nervous system between different brain parts?” should be 
“Information”. But, for unknown reasons, that is left 
undefined 
in 
both 
future 
mega-projects. 
And 
the 
consequences of this omission are predictable.

On the other hand, the reason of this omission is also 
fully understandable: we don’t know what Information is 
and how it is being transported (processed) in the brain. 
(That the brain is an information processing system is a 
widely accepted hypothesis in the scientific community). So, 
it will be wise to try to understand what information is. 
VI. 
WHAT IS INFORMATION 
While a consensus definition of information does not 
exist, we would like to propose a definition of our own 
(borrowed and extended from the Kolmogorov’s definition 
of information, first introduced in the mid-sixties of the past 
century):  
Information is a linguistic description of structures 
observable in a given data set [16]. 
Two types of structures could be distinguished in a data 
set – primary and secondary data structures. The first are 
data elements aggregations whose agglomeration is guided 
by natural physical laws; the others are aggregations of 
primary data structures which appear in the observer’s brain 
guided by the observer’s customs and habits. Therefore, the 
first could be called Physical data structures, and the second, 
Meaningful or Semantic data structures. And their 
descriptions should be accordingly called Physical 
Information and Semantic Information. 
This 
subdivision 
is 
usually 
overlooked 
in 
the 
contemporary data processing approaches leading to 
mistaken and erroneous data handling methods and 
techniques. 
In [17], E. Diamant presents a list of publications on the 
subject and a more extended explanation of information 
description duality can be found. Meanwhile, it is important 
to explain the consequences that immediately pop up from 
this assertion. And which are critically important for the right 
definition of the notion of cognition. In the light of this just 
acquired knowledge, we can certainly posit that cognitive 
ability is the ability to process information. And that is 
what our brains are doing, and that is what we are striving to 
replicate in our Cognitive Robots designs. 
First of all, physical information is carried by the data and 
therefore can be promptly extracted from it. At the same 
time, semantic information is a description of observer’s 
arrangement of the physical data structures and therefore it 
can not be extracted from the data, because semantics is not a 
property of the data, it is a property of an observer that is 
watching and scrutinizing the data. As such, semantics is 
always subjective and it is always a result of mutual 
agreements and conventions that are established in a certain 
group of observers, or a future group of robots and humans 
that act as a team sharing a common semantic understanding 
(semantic information) about their environment. An 
important sequel of this is that the semantic information can 
not be learned autonomously, but it should be provided to a 
cognitive robot from the outside (semantics has to be taught 
and not learned, as it is usually requested by all 
workprogrammes). 
Another important corollary that follows from the new 
understanding of information nature is that information 
description is always a linguistic description, that is, a string 
of symbols which can take a form of a mathematical formula 
(don’t forget that mathematics is a sort of a language) or a 
natural language item – a word, a sentence, or a piece of text. 
That is a very important outcome of the new theory 
considering that contemporary approaches to the problem of 
information processing are assuming computer involvement 
in the processing task. However, contemporary computers 
are data processing machines which are not supposed to 
process natural language texts which are carrying semantic 
information. 
Finally, we would like to provide some examples of 
widespread misunderstandings that appear in the Calls of 
proposals issued by DARPA and EU Commission: In the 
“ICT Work Programme 2009/2010, (C(2009) 5893)” [7], in 
its “Part 4.2 Challenge 2: Cognitive Systems, Interaction, 
Robotics” the problem that Robotic systems have to cope 
with is specifies as “extracting meaning and purpose from 
bursts of sensor data or strings of computer code…” This is          
114

COGNITIVE 2014 : The Sixth International Conference on Advanced Cognitive Technologies and Applications

      
a false and a misleading statement – sensor data does not 
possess semantics, and therefore, meaning and purpose can 
not be extracted from it. 
DARPA’s Document “Deep Learning” (RFI SN08-42) 
states that: “DARPA is interested in new algorithms for 
learning from unlabeled data in an unsupervised manner to 
extract emergent symbolic representations from sensory 
input…” Again, that is a false and a misleading statement – 
symbolic representations (semantics) could not be learned 
from data. 
VII. CONCLUSION 
Cognitive Robotics R&D is a very important branch of 
contemporary science that is paving the road to the next 
technological revolution – smart robots that are invading our 
everyday lives. Until now, the extensive research efforts of 
the Cognitive Robotics field investigators have been 
derailed by a wrong understanding about the essence of 
information, in general, and semantic information, in 
particular. We hope that the paper will contribute to some 
changes in this situation.
