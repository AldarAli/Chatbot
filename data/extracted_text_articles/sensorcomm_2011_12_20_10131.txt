Abstract—In this work, a low cost automatic sensing system is 
proposed 
to 
detect 
‘synthetic 
milk’, 
which 
has 
been 
reconstructed after adulterating the milk with ‘liquid-whey’.  
The constant-phase angle (CPA) based sensor detects the 
synthetic milk and a micro-controller based circuit drives a 
stepper motor to close the valve installed at the outlet of the 
milk supply line to prevent mixing. The sensor is stick type, 
rigid and hence it is easy to mount. The electrodes of the sensor 
are coated with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) film, which 
makes it bio-compatible and suitable for the application.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Milk adulteration is a century old problem [1, 2]. The 
oldest and simplest method of adulterating milk is by dilution 
with water to increase volume [3] and then to compensate 
specific gravity, different types of salt or sugar [4] are used. 
Sometimes the color change due to adulterants are corrected 
by the addition of a small amount of coloring matter [5] 
which may cause serious health problem [6]. 
A similar type of milk adulteration problem is reported in 
this work, where the volume is increased by addition of 
‘liquid-whey’ (liquid by-product of cottage cheese) to increase 
the volume.  The liquid- whey addition makes the natural 
milk a little acidic and lowers its pH value which is 
compensated by adding NaOH.  
It is a well known fact that NaOH may cause health 
hazards to the patients suffering from heart disease and 
hypertension. It also deprives the body from utilizing lysine 
which is required for growing babies. Moreover, some greedy 
cheese maker uses cheap muriatic acid (a chemical 
composition of hydrochloric acid) to make cheese from milk, 
which causes more health problems. 
The profit of using liquid-whey, as milk adulterants is 
double folded. First of all it is in abundance to the cheese 
maker, so cheap and easily available to the milk supplier. 
Secondly whey retains many natural properties of milk, so 
preparation of synthetic milk from liquid-whey is simple and 
can camouflage the natural milk easily. As a result 
adulteration of natural milk with liquid-whey became a wide 
spread fraudulent activity, where huge amount of cottage 
cheese is used everyday to make different varieties of sweets. 
Hence, this becomes a serious concern to the dairy firms who 
buy milk from thousands of different milk suppliers and need 
a simple, robust and bio-compatible automated sensing 
system to their milk incoming line for quality control. 
In this work a stick type probe, whose electrodes are 
coated with porous film of PMMA [7], is used as a sensor for 
developing the sensing system. The advantage is that it can be 
easily dipped inside the medium and at the same time

biocompatible due to the PMMA coating on the electrodes. 
More over, the detection is based on the principle of change 
of phase angle with the ionic property of the medium. The 
phase angle remains constant over a band of frequency, so 
measurement can be frequency independent, which is an 
important requirement for automated sensing system. The 
other advantages are - it is simple, easy to fabricate, cheap 
and can be replaced easily. 
The paper is organized as follows: Section II describes the 
principle of operation of constant phase angle based sensor to 
detect milk adulteration. Section III provides fabrication and 
characterization of the CPA-based sensor. Section IV details 
the integrated sensing system with the detector circuit. 
Section V discusses the experimental observations and 
results. Section VI presents a conclusion. 
 
II.  PRINCIPLES OF CONSTANT PHSAE ANGLE –BASED 
MEASUREMENT 
 
In earlier works, the construction and working principle 
of the constant phase angle based sensor has been reported 
[8]. The impedance of the sensor (Fig. 2) dipped inside the 
medium can be represented as           
  
Z s = Qs−α
( )
                                                           (1) 
where Z is the impedance, Q is a constant, α is a real number 
and s is the Laplace operator. So, magnitude |Z| = Qω-α and 
phase angle θ = -απ/2, where θ is expressed in radians and 
independent of frequency. When α = 1, Z = Qs-1 and Z 
represents a capacitor. Similarly for α = 0 and -1, Z 
represents a resistance and inductance respectively. 
For the above sensing system, it has been observed 
experimentally that the constant phase angle θ is a function of 
three parameters of the measurement arrangement and 
expressed as  
)
( , ,
σ
θ
= f A t
                                                         (2) 
where ‘σ’ is the property (e.g., ionic, dielectric) of the 
medium under test, ‘A’ is the area of contact of the probe 
with the test medium and ‘t’ is the thickness of PMMA-film 
coated on the electrodes [7, 9].  
In this work, the change in constant phase angle  θ for 
pure milk, adulterated milk and synthetic milk (reconstructed 
after adding liquid-whey) has been observed to identify 
synthetic milk. For a particular measurement, area of contact 
of the probe with liquid medium and the thickness of film 
coated on the electrodes are kept constant.  However the effect 
of these two parameters needs to be studied for standardizing 
the sensor and the optimum area and thickness is to be chosen 
for measurement [10]. It has also been observed that this

constant phase angle changes with the change of physical 
property of the polarizing medium (e.g., ionic concentration). 
This property  of the CPE can be used for sensing purpose- 
this means the phase angle of the CPE will be different for 
plain milk and the milk with some impurity.  
It has been already mentioned that the phase angle 
remains 
constant 
over 
frequency 
which 
makes 
the 
measurement independent of the frequency. However the 
bandwidth is limited to 10 kHz to 20 kHz. In this report all 
the measurement is performed at 15 kHz, so that in automatic 
sensing, if due to environmental or other effect the frequency 
of the detector circuit shifts, it will not effect the 
measurement. 
 
III. FABRICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SENSOR 
The principle of development of thin PMMA-film coating 
on the probe electrodes are similar as reported by the authors 
in earlier report [11]. The sensor used in present application 
is 6 cm long, 6 mm wide, cut from double sided copper 
cladded PCB, generally used in electrical circuit fabrication. 
A thin film of PMMA is coated on the electrode surface using 
spin coating technique. The different film thickness can be 
achieved by changing concentration of the PMMA 
chloroform solution and the speed of the rotation of the spin 
coating machine. In the present study sensor with coating 
thickness of 18 µm is used. 
The fabricated sensor is characterized by measuring 
impedance (Z) and phase angle θ with a LCR meter (Agilent 
Precision Impedance Analyser 4294A). The sinusoidal signal 
frequency is varied from 100 Hz to 4 MHz and peak to peak 
voltage is 1 V.  The phase angle change is noted with 
standard buffer pH 4.0, pH 9.2 solutions, and also in pure 
milk. Each measurement is repeated five times and the 
average value of phase angle is plotted. It can be observed in 
Fig. 1, that the sensor gives a constant phase angle in the 
frequency range 10 kHz-20 kHz. The entire experiment was 
performed in controlled room temperature of 20oC, since 
temperature is one of the dependent parameters of pH value.  
 
IV. DESIGN OF THE SENSING SYSTEM 
Fig. 2a shows the proposed sensing system to detect the 
synthetic milk. The physical dimension of the probe is shown 
in Fig. 2b. The first block consists of the CPA-based sensor 
dipped inside the test sample. The output of the sensor is a 
phase angle (which remains constant over a frequency band). 
A phase detector circuit [12] measures the phase angle and 
gives voltage output. The display will glow indicator circuit 
whenever adulteration is detected. The microcontroller based 
stepper motor drives the control valve so that whenever 
adulteration is detected the control valve at the outlet of the 
milk line shuts off to prevent mixing.

A. Sensor block 
The sensor block consists of the CPA sensor dipped inside 
the test medium. The interaction of the sensor with the test 
medium changes its impedance. In this measurement the 
“change of phase angle” in different test medium is 
considered as the sensor output. In Eqn. 2, it has been 
mentioned that the change of phase angle is dependent upon 
the ionic property of the test medium, hence the milk sample 
consisting of different ions will result different values of the 
phase angle.  The phase angle mode is advantageous as the 
subsequent signal transduction becomes easy [8]. More over, 
for a particular measurement the phase angle remains 
constant over a frequency band, which is an essential 
requirement for automated sensing system [13, 14] where 
change of signal frequency for interference or other effect will 
not hamper the measurement. 
 
B. Phase angle detector  
The phase detector circuit [11] is shown in the Fig. 3. In 
this circuit four op-amps and one XOR gate are used. XOR 
gate mainly perform the phase detection. First two Op-Amps 
(Amplifier 1, Amplifier 2) act as amplifier circuit and second 
two (Comparator 1, Comparator 2) are comparators. The 
lower part of the circuit i.e., Amplifier 2 and Comparator 2 
are used for reference signal. In the inverting terminal of 
Amplifier 2, a resistor of 1 kΩ is connected whereas in the 
Amplifier 1, an element with different phase angle is 
connected. So the outputs from the Amplifier 1 and 2 have 
some phase difference when a sinusoidal excitation is applied. 
Then the output signals are fed to the comparator. The 
comparator converts the sinusoidal signal to square wave.  
From the truth table of the XOR gate it can be seen that 
when d, the phase difference between the two inputs of the 
XOR gate is zero the output voltage v0 = 0, and when the 
phase difference is 900 the output will be maximum (half of 
the VDD applied to the XOR gate chip). The output of the 
XOR gate is fed to a low pass filter containing a resistance 
and capacitance. So, it gives dc output voltage proportional to 
the phase difference between the two inputs. 
Fig. 3 shows the phase detector circuit used for the 
sensing system. Though the circuit is a standard one, but as 
the constant phase angle is to be measured over a frequency 
range, the phase characteristics for individual component is to 
be studied. To do that, frequency response of the individual 
op-amp has been studied before fabricating the complete 
circuit. 
 
C. Actuator  
The micro-controller based stepper motor driver closes 
the control valve to perform the actuation. The output 
voltage corresponding to the pure milk is stored in the 
micro-controller and whenever a deviation occurs the driver 
circuit of the stepper motor is activated. This closes the 
control valve at the outlet and cuts off the milk supply line.

The display unit consists of LCD display and a LED 
array system. The output voltage can be read from the LCD 
and a comparator based LED driver system is used to glow 
the ‘RED’ or ‘GREEN’ LED to indicate the status of the 
milk. 
 
V. EXPERIMENTS, RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. Sample preparation 
250 ml of pure-milk with pH value 7.00 (complete 
specification is given in Appendix-I) is taken in a 500 ml 
beaker and boiled for 15 minutes. Then 1.5 ml of “muriatic 
acid (a chemical composition of HCl) is added to it. In few 
minutes light green color liquid (120 ml) is formed in 
beaker while white colored solid part gets separated. This 
light green colored liquid is filtered by filter paper into the 
conical flask and this liquid is called as ‘liquid-whey’. The 
white solid part is termed as cottage cheese. The chemical 
composition of these cottage cheese and whey is provided 
below.

The above mentioned ‘liquid-whey ‘(pH value 4.33-
4.98) is added to the pure milk which makes the mixture 
acidic (lowers the pH value). To compensate that small 
amount of NaOH is added till the pH value matches the 
original pH value of the pure milk. This reconstructed 
‘synthetic milk’ is the test sample. 
B. Experiment 
The experiments are carried out as discussed in Section 
III. The sensor is dipped inside the tests samples (first 
column of TABLE-2) and then the value of pH is measured 
by precision pH meter (Systronics Digital pH Meter 335). 
The magnitude and phase angle values of impedance of the 
sensor are measured by using precision LCR meter (Agilent 
Precision Impedance Analyzer 4294A) varying input 
frequency. And then output voltage is noted from the LCD 
by varying the frequency of the input signal. The results are 
tabulated in TABLE-2. 
 
C. Results and Discussion 
From Fig. 1, it is apparent that the sensor shows almost 
constant phase angle in the frequency zone 10 kHz–20 kHz 
and can be used for the proposed constant phase angle based 
sensing system. 
The second and third columns of TABLE-2 show the pH 
value of the test samples and corresponding phase angle 
obtained by the sensor at 15 kHz. Point to be noted the 
phase angle is almost constant in the frequency range (10 
kHz-20 kHz) which changes with the different ionic 
property of the test medium. 
From Fig. 4, it can be observed that the output voltage of 
the sensing system also remains almost constant in the 
prescribed frequency zone (15 kHz-20 kHz). Though output 
voltage versus phase angle (Fig. 5) does not show a linear 
curve but exhibits a definite relationship, i.e., with the 
increase 
of 
phase 
angle 
(i.e., 
decrease 
of 
ionic 
concentration), output voltage decreases.

It will be worth mentioning here, that after adding 
NaOH to the whey adulterated milk though the pH value is 
brought to the same value of the pure-milk, the sensor could 
identify between these two test samples and shows different 
phase angles. This is also reflected in the voltage output 
(3.75 volt for pure milk and 3.48 volt for Synthetic milk). 
 
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS 
In this work, a low cost automatic sensing system is 
designed to detect synthetic milk. The synthetic milk is 
reconstructed after adulterating pure milk with ‘liquid-whey’. 
The main difference between the pure milk and synthetic 
milk is the presence of different ions which the sensor is 
capable to detect. Moreover, the measurement is based on the 
change of the value of the phase angle due to the presence of 
ions with different concentration in the test medium. The 
phase angle is again constant over a frequency range, which 
is an added advantage for such automatic sensing systems. 
The instrumentation system is such designed, that whenever

adulteration is detected the micro-controller based stepper 
motor shuts off the control valve in the milk supply line and 
prevents mixing pure milk with adulterated milk. 
The stick type PMMA-film coated probe is rigid and 
hence, easy to install in the system and also replace whenever 
necessary. The PMMA coating makes it biocompatible, an 
essential requirement for the system. 
The proposed system can detect synthetic milk when 30% 
whey is added, but need to increase the resolution of the 
system. Further research work is on in this direction. 
Modification of the electronic transduction circuit to 
improve sensitivity and linearity remain as one of the future 
scopes of work.  Field testing of the sensing system is to be 
carried out and the life time of the sensor as well as other 
components of the system is to be investigated in future.
