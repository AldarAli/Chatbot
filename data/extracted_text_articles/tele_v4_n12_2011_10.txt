Abstract—In this paper, the satellite communication system 
consisting of the earth transmitting station and the satellite 
transponder was considered. Switch and Stay Combining 
(SSC) diversity technics are used on receiving satellite and 
receiving earth stations to reduce fading influence to the 
system performances. The presence of Nakagami-m and Rice 
fading on receiving satellite and receiving earth stations is 
observed. The probability density functions (PDFs) of the 
signal at the Earth receiver station output are determined for 
different parameters. The outage probability, as standard 
performance criterion of communication systems operating 
over fading channels, is calculated under upper conditions. 
The results are shown graphically in several figures and made 
to assess the influence of various parameters. This is very 
useful for mitigation the influence of fading in the design of 
satellite communication systems in the presence of fading 
Keywords- satellite telecommunication system; Nakagami-m

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Satellite communication systems are now a major part of 
most telecommunications networks as well as every-day 
lives through mobile personal communication systems and 
broadcast television [2]. A fundamental understanding of 
such systems is therefore important for a wide range of 
system designers, engineers and users. 
The fading and shadow effect are factors which degrade 
the system performances in telecommunication systems at 
the most. They derogate the power of transmitted signal. 
When a received signal experiences shadow effect or fading 
during transmission, its envelope and phase fluctuate over 
time. The most often are Rayleigh, Rice, Nakagami, Weibull 
and log-normal fading, and they are considered in the 
literature [3], [4]. 
Rayleigh and Rice distributions can be used to model 
the envelope of fading channels in many cases of interest 
The Rice fading is present very often in wireless 
telecommunication systems with direct line of site. When 
the fading appeared in the channel because of signal 
propagation by more paths, and dominate component exists 
because of optical visibility from transmitter to receiver, 
signal amplitude is modeled by Rice distribution [5]. It has 
been found experimentally, that Nakagami distribution 
offers better fit for wider range of fading conditions in 
wireless communications [6]. 
In wireless communication systems, various techniques 
for reducing fading effect and influence of shadow effect are 
used. Such techniques are diversity reception, dynamic 
channel 
allocation 
and 
power 
control. 
Upgrading 
transmission reliability and increasing channel capacity 
without increasing transmission power and bandwidth is the 
main goal of diversity techniques. 
Diversity reception, based on using multiple antennas at 
the receiver, space diversity, with two or more branches, is 
very efficient methods used for improving system’s quality 
of service, so it provides efficient solution for reduction of 
signal level fluctuations in fading channels. Multiple 
received copies of signal could be combined on various 
ways. 
Several principal types of combining techniques can be 
generally performed by their dependence on complexity 
restriction put on the communication system and amount of 
channel state information available at the receiver. 
Combining techniques like maximal ratio combining (MRC) 
and equal gain combining (EGC) require all or some of the 
amount of the channel state information of received signal. 
Second, MRC and EGC require separate receiver chain for 
each branch of the diversity system, which increase its 
complexity of system. 
Maximal-Ratio Combining (MRC) is one of the most 
widely used diversity combining schemes whose SNR is the 
sum of the SNR’s of each individual diversity branches. 
MRC is the optimal combining scheme, but its price and 
complexity are higher. Also, MRC requires cognition of all 
channel parameters and admit in the same phase all input 
signals, because it is the most complicated for realization [7]-
[9].

Signal at the EGC diversity system output is equal to the 
sum of its’ input signals. The input signals should be 
admitted in the same phase, but it is not necessary to know 
the 
channel 
parameters. 
Therefore, 
EGC 
provides 
comparable performances to MRC technique, but has lower 
implementation complexity; therefore, it is an intermediate 
solution [10]. 
One of the least complicated combining methods is 
selection combining (SC). In opposition to previous 
combining techniques, SC receiver processes only one of the 
diversity branches, and it is much simpler for practical 
realization. Generally, selection combining, selects the 
branch with the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), that is 
the branch with the strongest signal [10], [11], assuming that 
noise power is equally distributed over branches. Abu-Dayya 
and Beaulieu in [12] consider switched diversity on 
microcellular Ricean channels. 
Similarly to the previous approaches, there is type of 
selection combining that chooses the branch with highest 
signal and noise sum. In fading environments, where the 
level of the cochannel interference is sufficiently high 
comparing with the thermal noise, SC selects the branch with 
the highest signal-to-interference ratio (SIR-based selection 
diversity) [13]. 
Switch and stay combining (SSC) is an attempt at 
simplifying the complexity of the system but with loss in 
performance. In this case, rather than continually connecting 
the antenna with the best fading conditions, the receiver 
selects a particular antenna until its quality drops below a 
predetermined threshold. When this happens, the receiver 
switches to another antenna and stays with it for the next 
time slot, regardless of whether or not the channel quality of 
that antenna is above or below the predetermined threshold. 
The consideration of SSC systems in the literature has been 
restricted to low-complexity mobile units where the number 
of diversity antennas is typically limited to two [14], [15]. 
Furthermore, in all these publications, only predetection 
SSC has thus far been considered wherein the switching of 
the receiver between the two receiving antennas is based on 
a comparison of the instantaneous SNR of the connected 
antenna with a predetermined threshold. This results in a 
reduction in complexity relative to SC in that the 
simultaneous and continuous monitoring of both branches 
SNRs is no longer necessary.

RELATED WORK 
An analytical technique well suited to numerical analysis 
is presented for computing the average bit-error rate (BER) 
and outage probability of M-ary phase-shift keying (PSK) in 
the 
land-mobile 
satellite 
channel 
(LMSC) 
with 
microdiversity 
reception 
in 
[16]. 
The 
closed-form 
expressions are found for L-branch microdiversity using both 
selection diversity combining (SDC) and maximal ratio 
combining (MRC). These expressions are extended to 
include both M-ary coherent PSK (M-PSK) and differential 
PSK [M-differential PSK (DPSK)]. Following previous 
empirical studies, the LMSC is modeled as a weighted sum 
of Rice and Suzuki distributions. Numerical results are 
provided illustrating the achievable performance of both M-
PSK and M-DPSK with diversity reception. Using measured 
channel parameters, the performance in various mobile 
environments for various satellite elevation angles is also 
found. 
An exact analytical technique is presented for computing 
the average bit error rate (BER) and outage probability of 
differentially detected PSK in the land mobile satellite 
channel (LMSC) when L branch maximal ratio combining 
(MRC) is employed in [17]. Following empirical study, the 
LMSC is modeled as a weighted sum of Rice and Suzuki 
distributions. 
Empirical studies confirm that the received radio signals 
in certain cellular systems are well modeled by Nakagami 
statistics. Therefore, performing relevant systems studies can 
be potentially useful to a system designer. A very useful 
statistical measure for characterizing the performance of a 
mobile radio system is the probability of outage, which 
describes the fraction of time that the signal-to-interference 
ratio (SIR) drops below some threshold. A more refined 
criterion for the outage is the failure to simultaneously obtain 
a sufficient SIR and a minimum power level for the desired 
signal. Thus, in [18] the authors derived new expressions for 
the probability of outage where a mobile unit receives a 
Nakagami desired signal and multiple, independent, 
cochannel Nakagami interferers. A salient feature of their 
results is that the outage expressions do not restrict the 
Nakagami fading parameter, m, to strictly integer values. 
Furthermore, since the received signals in mobile radio also 
experience log-normal shadowing, they analyzed the case 
where the received signals are modeled by a composite of 
Nakagami and log-normal distributions. The outage 
probabilities are computed and graphically presented for 
several cases. The effect of specifying a minimum signal 
requirement for adequate reception is found to introduce a 
floor on the outage probability. It is also found that 
shadowing in macrocellular systems severely degrades the 
desired quality of service by increasing the reuse distance 
necessary for a given outage level. 
In this paper, the satellite communication system 
consisting of the earth transmitting station and the satellite 
transponder was considered. SSC diversity technics are used 
on receiving satellite and receiving earth stations to reduce 
fading influence to the system performances. The presence 
of Nakagami-m fading on receiving satellite and receiving 
earth stations is observed in [1], and the presence of Rice 
fading on both, receiving satellite and receiving earth 
stations is observed here. The probability density functions 
(PDFs)  and the outage probability of the signal at the Earth 
receiver station output are given for different parameters. 
Beside generally used first Section, introduction, and the 
last, conclusion, the paper has further four core sections. The 
second Section of the paper presents related works, the third 
one shows and interprets the system model. The statistics of 
the output SNR is given in the fourth Section and numerical 
results in the fifth one.

SSC combiner with two inputs because the gain is the 
greatest when we use the SSC combiner with two inputs 
instead of one-channel system. When we enlarge the number 
of inputs (branches) the gain becomes less. Because of that it 
is more economic using SSC combiner with two inputs.  
 
       
 
Figure 1. Model of the SSC combiner with two inputs 
 
The model of this system is shown in Figure 1. The 
signals at the combiner input are r1 and r2, and r is the 
combiner output signal. Let see how the SSC combiner with 
two inputs works. 
The probability of the event that the combiner first 
examines the signal at the first input is P1, and for the 
second input is P2. If the combiner examines first the signal 
at the first input and if the value of the signal at the first 
input is above the treshold, rT, SSC combiner forwards this 
signal to the circuit for the decision. If the value of the 
signal at the first input is below the treshold rT, SSC 
combiner forwards the signal from the other input to the 
circuit for the decision, regardless it is above or below the 
predetermined threshold. If the SSC combiner first 
examines the signal from the second combiner input it 
works in the similar way. The probability for the first input 
to be examined first is P1 and for the second input to be 
examined first is P2. 
There are two diversity branches on satellite and on 
Earth receiver station. The SSC combining is used on both, 
receiver satellite and Earth station. System model is shown 
in Figure 2 
Let Nakagami-m fading is present on both, receiver 
satellite and Earth station. The signals at the input are A1 
and A2. In this case the probability density of signal A, at the 
satellite station output, is, for 0<A<AT:

IV. 
SYSTEM PERFORMANCES 
The obtained expressions for the probability density 
function (PDF) of the output signal after diversity 
combining can be used to study the moments, the amount of 
fading, the outage probability and the average bit error rate 
of proposed system. 
The outage probability Pout is standard performance 
criterion of communication systems operating over fading 
channels. This performance measure is commonly used to 
control the noise or cochannel interference level, helping the 
designers of wireless communications system's to meet the 
quality-of-service (QoS) and grade of service (GoS) 
demands. 
In the interference-limited environment, the outage 
probability Pout is defined as the probability which combined 
SIR falls below a given outage threshold γT, also known as a 
protection ratio. Protection ratio depends on modulation 
technique and expected QoS.

NUMERICAL RESULTS 
The probability density function curves (PDFs), p(z), of 
the signal z at the Earth receiver station output, in the 
presence of Nakagami-m fading are given in Figures 3 to 6 
for diferent parameters.

present on receiver satellite and Earth station, for different parameters: 
 σ1 =1, σ2 = 0.5, 0.7, 1, 1.5,  
m1 = m2 =1, Ω1 = Ω2 =1, m3 = m4 =1,  Ω3= Ω4=1, a t=2, At=2

1a  and

The outage probability curves Pout(z), in the presence of 
Nakagami-m fading are given in Figures 7 and 8 for diferent 
parameters.

 Ωa1= Ωa24=1, a t=2, At=2
 
 
The probability density function curves (PDFs), p(z), of 
the signal z at the Earth receiver station output, in the 
presence of Rice fading are given in Figures 9 to 12, for 
diferent parameters. 
 
 
Figure 10. The probability density function p(z) for Rice fading present on 
receiver satellite and Earth station, for different parameters: 
σ1= 0.7, 1, 1.5, σ2=0.7,     σA1 =σA2 =0.5, ΩA1 = ΩA2 =1, σa2 = σa2 =0.5, 
Ωa1= Ωa24=1, a t=1, At=1

Ωa1= Ωa24=1, a t=1, At=1 
 
We can see from these figures the influence of two 
parameters of Rice distribution, the signal amplitudes Ω and 
variances σ, and the standard deviations σi, and the signal 
amplitudes A1, A2, 
1a  and 
2a .

Figure 12. The probability density function p(z)  for Rice fading present on 
receiver satellite and Earth station, for different parameters: 
σ1= 0.7, σ2=0.7, σA1 = σA2 =1, ΩA1 = ΩA2 =1, σa2 = σa2 =1, Ωa1= Ωa24=1,

satellite and Earth station, for different parameters:  
σ1 =1, σ2 = 0.5, 0.7, 1, 1.5, σA1 = σA2 =1, ΩA1 = ΩA2 =1, σa2 = σa2 =1, 
 Ωa1= Ωa24=1, a t=2, At=2
 
 
The dependence of probability density functions, pdf 
p(z), from z, the Earth receiver station output signal, are 
given in Figures 3 to 6 in the presence of Nakagami-m 
fading, and in Figures 9 to 12 in the presence of Rice fading, 
present on receiver satellite and Earth stations for some 
values of distribution parameters. In every graph one or 
several parameters are given by few values and one can see 
the variation of pdf versus values of selected parameters for 
constant other parameters. 
The expression for probability density function (PDF) of 
the output signal after diversity combining is used to study 
the outage probability of proposed system. The outage 
probability 
is 
standard 
performance 
criterion 
of 
communication systems operating over fading channels. 
 
 
Figure 14. The outage probability Pout(z)  for Rice fading present on 
receiver satellite and Earth station, for different parameters: 
σ1= 0.7, σ2=0.7, σA1 = σA2 =1, ΩA1 = ΩA2 =0.2, 0.5, 0.7, 1, σa2 = σa2 =1, 
Ωa1= Ωa24=1, a t=1, At=1 
 
The outage probability curves Pout(z), are shown in 
Figures 7, 8, 13, 14 for determined values of distribution 
parameters: parameters of fadings on receiver satellite and 
Earth station, the standard deviations σi, and the signal 
values at the system inputs. 
The values of Pout(z) for some values of parameters σ2, 
and constant other parameters, are shown in Figures 7 and 
13. From this figure can be seen that Pout(z) decreases with 
increase of parameter σ2, for the same value of z, if z is 
bigger than threshold decision. From Figures 8 and 14, it can 
be seen that Pout(z) decreases with increasing of spread 
parameters Ω1=Ω2.  
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper the satellite communication system consisting 
of the earth transmitting station and the satellite transponder 
was considered. Switch and stay combining (SSC) diversity 
technics are used on receiving satellite and receiving Earth 
stations. SSC is used, as the simplest and the cheapest 
combining method, to reduce fading influence to the system 
performances. The presence of Nakagami-m and Rice 
fading on receiving satellite and receiving Earth stations is 
observed. Rice distribution is used to model the envelope of 
fading channels in wireless telecommunication systems with 
direct line of site, when dominate component exists. This 
type of the satellite communication system can be used for 
propagation channels consisting of one strong direct LOS 
(line of sight) component and many random weaker 
components for both, receiving satellite and receiving earth 
stations and for satellite propagation channels that obey a 
Nakagami m distribution. The fading is the limiting factor in 
both directions. Because it has been found experimentally 
that Nakagami distribution offers better fit for wider range of 
fading 
conditions in 
wireless 
communications, 
the 
influence of this kind of fading is analyzed also.

The probability density functions (PDFs) of the signal at 
the Earth receiver station output are represented for different 
parameter values. The other system performances, such as 
the system error probability and the outage probability,  
could be calculated by the output signal probability density 
function. In this paper, the outage probability, as standard 
performance criterion of communication systems operating 
over fading channels, is calculated and the curves are shown 
also. 
In the future work the other combining techniques, such 
as Maximal Ratio Combining, (MRC), Equal Gain 
Combining, (EGC), and Selection Combining, (SC), could 
be investigated and the results compared with appropriate in 
this paper.
