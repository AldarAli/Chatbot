INTRODUCTION 
Asset formation for the retirement generation is a common 
issue around the world and has been widely discussed in 
various countries. In the U.S., the empirical benchmark is a 
fixed withdrawal rate of 4% of initial assets [1]. On the 
contrary, there are critics who argue that a fixed withdrawal 
rate is inefficient [2] and that "rules" should be set to vary 
the withdrawal rate and amount [3] [4].  
On the other hand, there have been reports of research 
using social simulation to solve problems in social science. 
For example, Yamada et al. [5] have proposed a method that 
utilizes both real data and agent simulation to solve problems 
faced by real businesses and industries. Such a level of 
elaborate analysis that is able to withstand decision-making 
in the field is expected to make a significant contribution to 
efficient decision-making in social and economic activities. 
In addition, there have been many reports of analysis through 
modeling based on real corporate behavior and finance 
theory [6][7]. 
In this study, we focus on a life planning support system 
built based on data and social simulation. In Sections II and 
III, we present an overview of the model and its application.

METHODOLOGY
In this Section, we present an overview of the simulation 
model used in this paper. 
A.
Outline 
This system is designed to run simulations based on data 
of customer attributes, and to evaluate and validate measures 
for customers' retirement assets based on the data and 
simulation results (Fig. 1). The social simulation is 
constructed based on finance theory. And machine learning 
is used for the evaluation and verification of the policy 
measures [8]. 
Through these models, it will be possible to effectively 
discuss measures to avoid the depletion of retirement assets 
[9][10]. The proposed methodology is intended to be used by 
financial planners and others who develop life plans for their 
clients.

Simulation model 
We construct a computer simulation model that expresses 
asset formation and withdrawal before and after retirement 
(Fig. 1). This model is based on a model previously proposed 
by the authors [9][10]. 
Figure 2.  Conceptual Diagram of Simulation Model 
The actors in the model have a specific asset balance at a 
certain age. Actors also have regular income and expenditure 
(cash inflow and outflow) and sudden income and 
expenditure (depending on life events) according to actor’s 
own status (before and after retirement). The attributes of the 
actors can be grounded to statistical data. In addition, by 
manipulating the attributes of the actors, what-if analysis can 
be performed when a policy is implemented．
Next, the assets held by actors include cash, deposits, and 
risk assets. Risk assets are fully invested in a portfolio of 
traditional assets and provide returns according to the risk of

the portfolio. In addition, the regular income and expenditure 
fluctuates according to the inflation rate. Here, the risk-return 
of the portfolio, inflation rate, and their variances are given 
as the external environment. 
C.
Usefulness and limitation of the proposed system 
Conventional analysis has often focused on people with 
specific attributes to simulate asset depletion situations [11] 
[12]. In those studies, ad hoc analysis was required for each 
person in order to examine possible measures to be taken. 
On the other hand, the proposed system is capable of 
comprehensively and semi-automatically specifying possible 
life planning measures for each person. 
One of the limitations of this analysis is that there is 
arbitrariness on the part of the modeler as to which attributes 
of the targeted individuals are reflected in the simulation 
model.

APPLICATION
In this Section, we show an application of our 
methodology. 
A.
Dataset: Individual attributes 
We use the individual questionnaire data from the 
"Awareness Survey on Life in Old Age for Before and After 
Retirement Generations" conducted by the MUFG Financial 
Education Institute [13]. The survey target was men and 
women aged 50 and over. The survey area was Japan, and 
the number of valid responses was 6,192 samples. This 
questionnaire comprehensively investigated the asset status 
of each individual (current asset balance and expected in-
come/expenditure in old age), the planned asset succession 
amount, stance on investment, and outlook for old age, etc. 
B.
Sample of Simulation Results 
Based on the above individual questionnaire data, we 
established several patterns of "possible person attributes" 
through segmentation by feature analysis. Based on these 
attributes, the simulation model described in the Section II 
was used to simulate measures for asset formation and 
withdrawal. Then, we estimated the asset depletion status of 
representative people who were typified by the individual 
questionnaire data (TABLE I) [9].

In addition, we conducted a hypothetical simulation in 
which the actors made various decisions to control asset 
depletion. By calculating feature importance using machine 
learning methods, we examined the effectiveness of these 
decisions (TABLE II) [9].
