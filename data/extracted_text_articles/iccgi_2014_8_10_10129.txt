Abstract‐With the development of cloud computing, the 
amount of data processing and the ability of information 
sharing in e-commerce are increasing. Negotiation based on 
multi-agent is an essential approach to accomplish 
e-commerce. How to make the negotiation based on 
multi-agent to adapt to the change brought by cloud 
computing is an important problem. By considering the 
degree of market competition pressure, negotiation time, 
opponent’s negotiation historical information under cloud 
computing, the paper constructs a negotiation model.

INTRODUCTION 
The emergence of cloud computing represents the 
arrival of new era of the Internet. Under the circumstance 
of cloud computing, the methods of requiring information 
and communication and so on have changed. In cloud 
computing, all kinds of resources on the Internet could be 
packaged into service. The packaged resources could 
supply limitless resource services for requesters [1]. The 
advantage of cloud computing is that the platform 
combines enormous resources and could supply variable 
resources based on actual requirements of users [2]. For 
suppliers, the process of supplying cloud resource to users 
is a process of service trade in nature. Negotiation holds 
an important position in service trade. With the rapid 
development 
of 
Distributed 
Artificial 
Intelligence, 
Multi-agent systems and Autonomy-Oriented Computing, 
lots of researchers devoted into the research of multi-agent 
based negotiation [3]. According to the theoretical basis, 
the multi-agent based negotiation includes negotiations 
based on game theory [4][5], negotiations based on 
heuristic [6][7], and negotiations based on argumentation 
[8][9]. 
The multi-agent based negotiation has good abilities of 
distribution and autonomy, it is suitable for the trade under 
the circumstance of cloud computing especially for cloud 
resource trade. There have been some researchers who 
investigated the multi-agent based negotiation under the 
circumstance of cloud computing. Multi-agent based 
negotiation under the circumstance of cloud computing 
has been concerned by researchers [10][11]. There are two 
markets in cloud computing, i.e., cloud service market 
between users and service intermediaries, and resource 
market between service intermediaries and cloud suppliers, 
and proposed a negotiation mechanism to accomplish 
dynamic SLA (Service Level Agreement) negotiation in 
cloud computing [10]. The supply-demand relationship 
under cloud resource allocation was modeled by game 
theory [12]. Distributed negotiation mechanism was 
proposed for leasing contracts between cloud suppliers 
and users [13]. Under the market of cloud computing, 
negotiation would proceed successfully by take good 
advantage of resource-level information. Then, the 
negotiation would promote the accomplishment of 
business targets. Consequently, a negotiation model based 
on non-addition utility function is proposed to promote the 
business trade under cloud computing [14]. Service level 
agreement should be established to resolve the conflicts of 
participates’ different preferences for cloud service. A 
multi-issue negotiation mechanism is established to 
resolve the multi-issue negotiation for price, time and 
service quality under cloud computing. Moreover, 
corresponding negotiation agreement is established [15]. 
During the process of cloud resource allocation, the 
resource suppliers and users are all self-interest agents. 
The amount of suppliers’ resource and the requirement of 
customers are changing consistently. Facing with these 
problems, a distribute negotiation mechanism is proposed. 
While using this mechanism, supplier agent and customer 
agent could negotiate according to contract price and penal 
sum. The agents could adapt to the changing environment. 
Then, the negotiation’s accomplishment will promote the 
cloud resource allocation [16]. The cloud resource 
suppliers provide large amount of cloud resource to 
customers according to customers’ requirements on IaaS 
layer. A negotiation mechanism of decision making for 
cloud resource allocation is proposed by extending the 
current appointment arithmetic [17]. 
However, current multi-agent based negotiation under 
the circumstance of cloud computing mainly used the 
existing multi-agent based negotiation theory, and aiming 
at maximizing the economic benefits for users and 
suppliers. They ignored the influencing factors during the 
negotiation process, such as degree of competition, time of 
negotiation, historical information of trade and so on. 
Moreover, current research mainly used static negotiation 
process, which may cause the waste of resource and may 
be lack of interaction between cloud resource suppliers 
and users.  
Based on the above analysis, the article designs a 
multi-agent 
based 
negotiation 
model 
under 
the 
circumstance of cloud computing. Firstly, the negotiation 
framework under the circumstances of cloud computing is 
constructed. Intermediary agent is added to the framework 
to filter the resource. Secondly, considering the degree of 
market competition pressure, negotiation time, opponent’s 
negotiation historical information during the negotiation, 
the multi-agent based negotiation model under cloud 
computing is established. Thirdly, the negotiation model’s 
effectiveness is verified by simulation experiment. Finally, 
we summarize our work and propose our future work.

Figure 1.  Multi-agent based negotiation framework under the circumstances of cloud computing. 
The 
negotiation 
framework 
contains 
3 
components:multi-agent system, application interface 
layer and cloud resource market. Multi-agent system is the 
platform for the service trade, agents represent resource 
user, resource supplier and intermediary. Application 
interface connect the multi-agent system to cloud resource 
market. Cloud resource market contains all the resources 
used for service trade. The detailed description of the 3 
components are introduced as bellow: 
1) Multi-agent System 
a) 
Resource Use Agent and Resource Supply 
Agent  
Resource use agents and resource supply agents are the 
main participants of Multi-agent negotiation, who possess 
different targets, get information through intermediary 
agent, and negotiate with opponent agents. Resource 
supply agents possess the resource in the cloud computing 
market. 
b) 
Intermediary Agent

In order to improve the efficiency of matching users’ 
requirements to resources, we add intermediary agent to 
the negotiation framework. The intermediary agent is a 
third party in cloud computing market which is trusted by 
participants of cloud resource trade. It interacts with cloud 
resource market through application interface layer to get 
market information. 
2) Application Interface Layer 
The intermediary agent in multi-agent system connects 
with cloud resource market through application interface 
layer. The application interface layer supplies web service, 
user authentication, application software and so on to 
intermediary agent. 
3) Cloud Resource Market 
Cloud resources are stored in cloud resource market 
Which mainly contains infrastructure layer, virtual 
resource layer, service management layer and application 
layer. The relationship of the layers and the layers’ 
components are shown in Figure 1.  
B. Workflow of Multi-agent Based Negotiation 
We construct workflow of automated negotiation 
(shown in Figure 2) based on Figure 1. As intermediary 
agent is an important part for connection, we also 
introduce it in this section. 
1) Workflow  
The workflow of Multi-agent negotiation is shown in 
Figure 2. 
 
Figure 2.  Workflow of multi-agent negotiation under the circumstance 
of cloud computing. 
①Requests submitting:under the circumstance of 
cloud computing, resource use agents submit their 
requests to intermediary agent, and intermediary agent 
gets resource information from cloud resource market 
through application interface layer. 
②Resource Matching:the intermediary agent matches 
the users’ requests to the resource information and sends 
results to negotiators. 
③Getting Information:the matched agents get market 
information and opponent’s proposal history through 
intermediary agent. 
④Negotiation proceeding:participants of negotiation 
send proposal to opponents. When agent gets the proposal 
that meets its requirement, negotiation succeed. Otherwise, 
negotiation proceeds until reaching to the time limit. 
If negotiator could not get expected result within the 
negotiation time limit, the negotiation fails. 
2) Function of Intermediary Agent 
Under circumstance of cloud computing, in order to 
improve the efficiency of matching the requests and 
resource information, we use intermediary agent to match 
the requests to resource information rapidly. The matching 
of users’ requests to cloud resource information includes 
three steps:selecting, evaluating and recommendation. 
a) 
To select. The resources use agents submit 
resource requests to intermediary agent. Intermediary 
agent acquires service information from cloud resource 
market and compares the requests with resource 
information, then selects the resource that match to users’ 
requests. 
b) 
To evaluate. Because there are lots of elements 
can be evaluated, we only analyze price for the 
convenience of research. Let 
k
F  represents the resource 
that matched successfully, k is the serial number of 
k
F  
and U represents the utility of 
Fk
’s price.

III. 
NEGOTIATION MODEL BASED ON 
COMPETITION-TIME-HISTORY 
During negotiation under the circumstance of cloud 
computing, resource use agents and resource supply 
agents are affected by some influencing factors. The 
pressure of market competition, negotiation time, 
opponent’s historical information may be the most main 
factors. We combine the influencing factors under cloud 
computing circumstance and construct the multi-agent 
based negotiation model. 
A. Formal Description of Negotiation Model 
The negotiation model can be described as following:

S :Negotiation strategy agent uses during negotiation. 
During each round of negotiations, the elements in the 
above model would be updated. During the negotiation 
model, the pressure of market competition is decided by 
t
m  and 
tn , the negotiation time is decided by T, the 
opponent’s historical information is decided by H. The 
specific connotation of three elements is introduced as 
bellow. 
B. The Three Influencing Factors of Negotiation 
1) Pressure of Market Competition 
The pressure of market competition should be 
evaluated in time during negotiation. The evaluation 
function of competition pressure is defined as:

The agent could get the market information through 
intermediary agent. Through analysis, we know that if 
competition pressure 
)
,
(
C mt nt
 is bigger, the probability 
of agent being considered as the best opponent is bigger, 
then the probability of reaching good results is bigger and 
the agent’s competitiveness is bigger. So the environment 
is advantage for agent and the agent should make smaller 
concession. Otherwise, the agent should make bigger 
concession. 
When only 
consider 
the 
pressure 
of 
market 
competition,  the cloud resource use agent’s proposal in 
the next round is:

2) Time 
Time limit is usually set during negotiation, 
negotiators usually take different concession as the time 
goes. The different concession based on time is 
summarized and the time constraint equation is proposed

3) Opponent’s historical information 
Negotiation opponent’s proposals during negotiation 
have some characteristics. If negotiators could take 
advantage of these characteristics, the negotiation would 
be advantage for them.

C. Proposal Generating Based on COMPETITION 
-TIME-HISTORY 
We combine the weighted influencing factors to 
generate new proposals by summation. Agents in the 
negotiation could decide each factor’s weight by 
themselves. The weight reflects agent’s preferences to 
each factor. When using the above negotiation model to 
negotiate, agent could generate new proposal as the

EXPERIMENT AND RESULTS 
CloudSim is a cloud computing simulator developed 
by research group in the University of Melbourne. The 
simulator 
aims 
at 
simulating 
constructing 
the 
infrastructure of cloud computing and comparing 
difference service scheduling and allocation strategies. By 
this way, CloudSim could control the resources in cloud 
computing. 
A. 
Targets of Experiment  
In cloud computing market, the resource users want to 
solve their problems by lower cost, while service suppliers 
want to get more profit by supplying resources. 
Consequently, the process of cloud resource allocation is a 
process of service trade in nature. As negotiation holds an 
important position in service trade, cloud resource 
allocation is a good field to apply negotiation. Moreover, 
negotiation could improve the cloud resource allocation’s 
flexibility, interaction and autonomy. 
During simulation experiment on CloudSim, we apply 
the negotiation model proposed in this paper by modifying 
the class of VmAllocationPolicy in CloudSim. By 
comparing with the default resource allocation method and 
negotiation strategy based on time in CloudSim, we could 
verify 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
negotiation 
and 
the 
effectiveness of proposed negotiation model. 
B. Experimental Parameters Setting 
Hardware environment setting:Intel Core 1.86GHz 
CPU, 2GB RAM, 160G Hard Disk. Software environment 
setting:operating system is windows XP, development 
tools are Java 1.7.0, Eclipse 3.2 and CloudSim 3.0. 
Environment settings of CloudSim:the number of 
virtual machine’s CPU pick up 1or 2 randomly. The 
CPU’s capability of processing is 200MIPS-400MIPS. 1G 
RAM. Network bandwidth is 2M/s-4M/s. Hard disk is 
2G-4G. 
During experiment, we assume that cloud resource 
users only request storage resource and virtual nodes only 
supply storage resource. The experiment will simulate 
how virtual nodes which are on a same data center deal

with 20 tasks. Each task represents a user’s request ( that 
means there are 20 cloud resource users during 
experiment). Each virtual node represents a cloud resource 
supplier and there are 100 virtual nodes on a data center 
during experiment. The data center will use default 
method and the proposed negotiation model to allocate the 
cloud resource. We will verify the advantage of proposed 
negotiation model through comparison. 
During experiment, the cloud resource users’ expected 
price will choose from [10,60] randomly and reserved 
price will choose from [200,250] randomly. Virtual nodes’ 
expected price will choose from [200,250] randomly and 
reserve price will choose from [10,60] randomly. The 
price utility of resource users and suppliers for selecting 
targets is 0.1. Time strategy is chosen from 1/3, 1.0 and 
3.0 randomly. The maximum negotiation round is 20. 
Other attributes is the default value of CloudSim.

Results 
The experiment results are shown in Figure 3-5.We 
will analyze the experiment results from the angle of users 
and suppliers.

Figure 5.  Results of cloud resource allocation using negotiation model based on competition-time-history 
When using the CloudSim’s default method to allocate 
resources, the average negotiation time is 130.035ms, the 
suppliers’ average utility is 0.7215 and the users’ average 
utility is 0.6995. When using the negotiation strategy 
based on time, the average negotiation time is 91.98ms, 
the suppliers’ average utility is 0.807, the users’ average 
utility is 0.8055 and the average negotiation rounds is 6. 
While CloudSim using the proposed negotiation model to 
allocate resources, the average allocating time is 58.04ms, 
the suppliers’ average utility is 0.8975, the users’ average 
utility is 0.8755 and the average negotiation rounds is 
3.55.

Through Table 1, we could see that under cloud 
computing, while CloudSim uses negotiation strategy 
based on time, cloud resource allocation would use less 
time, resource users and suppliers will get higher utility. 
This means negotiation is more effective than CloudSim 
default method in cloud resource allocation. 
While comparing with the negotiation strategy based 
on time during cloud resource allocation, the proposed 
negotiation model based on competition-time-history 
proposed could shorten the resource allocation time and 
improve the final effectiveness. Consequently, we could 
hold the view that negotiation is suitable for cloud 
resource allocation, the proposed negotiation model is 
better than traditional negotiation methods. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The paper designed the multi-agent based negotiation 
framework under the circumstance of cloud computing. 
The intermediary agent could shorten the negotiation time 
and enhance the success rate of negotiation. The 
multi-agent 
based 
negotiation 
model 
based 
on 
competition-time-history proposed in the paper considers 
multiple influencing factors during negotiation, and 
generates reasonable proposal according to current market 
by combining all the factors. Finally, the negotiation 
model was applied to the ResourceAllocation of CloudSim 
and accomplish cloud resource allocation in the simulation 
experiments. Simulation experiment proved that the 
proposed negotiation model could applied to cloud 
resource well and could get higher effectiveness. With the 
development of cloud computing and the rapid increase of 
information 
technology, 
negotiation 
under 
cloud 
computing will face more problems such as credit 
problems, scheduling problems. We will consider how to 
resolve these problems in the future.
