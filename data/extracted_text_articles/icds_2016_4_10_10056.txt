Abstract— The number of foreigners who visit Japan is
increasing and it is important to build mutual understanding
with people of different cultural backgrounds. In order to
enhance foreigner’s visits to Japan, we propose a place
oriented Internet radio called Cross-Cultural Radio (CCR).
Subsequently, a Cross-Cultural Understanding Scale (CCUS)
was proposed and an evaluation experiment was conducted in
Tokyo to measure the effectiveness of CCR. Our experimental
results illustrate that CCR can be effective in certain aspects of
cross-cultural understanding. This paper intends to explore the
acculturation process amongst foreign visitors to Japan by
analyzing the behavior of participants in the experiment.
Keywords— place orientation; Internet radio; cross-cultural
understanding; measurement; evaluation.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Because of the great diversity in the modern world and its
continuous change, defining the term “culture” is an
extremely tough activity. However, like Damasio [1], who
claimed that “culture is a regulator of human life and
identity”, many scholars have attempted to conceptualize
their understanding of culture. Nonetheless, several aspects
of culture such as goods, feelings, actions and words can be
very specific to a particular region. They are difficult to
grasp from guidebooks or from just browsing the Internet,
because, in many cases, these contents are provided based
on visible (and generally superficial) information. It is quite
easy to gain stereotypical ideas about Japan in front of the
laptop but there will never be a better experience than direct
interaction with local people. This is because they give
foreigners real cultural ideas, and thus having a channel to
boost this kind of communication is highly important.
For instance, a keyword which seems to be distinctive for
the culture of Japan is “Kodawari”, which is difficult to
translate literally in English; yet “to be particular about a
manner” would be the closest. Its meaning is not just to be
particular, but to have a strong belief, or an excessive target
on the action. Many craftsmen in Japan have “Kodawari” in
what they create or how they are getting involved in the
industry, and having strong pride in what they do and would
never compromise their work is regarded as a virtue.
Another example of a keyword is “Omotenashi”, a word
that became slightly famous after the presentation to host
the Olympics in 2020. “Omotenashi” means to treat anyone
sincerely and warmheartedly, whether or not that person is a
customer, a guest, a family member, or an acquaintance.
The core of this concept is to express consideration and
respect to others. This act would also require the person to
understand the atmosphere, feel the mood and the invisible
energy, which is wrapped around the occasion or person.
Ultimately, it does not mean to entertain the person and
achieve any kind of self-satisfaction, but to quickly perceive
the person’s needs, desires, overall mood, and entertain the
person accordingly with a warm heart.
As the mobility of people has been rapidly improved and
the number of foreigners who visit Japan is increasing [2],
recognizing diversity to build cross-cultural understanding
is becoming a crucial interest in the country. We have to be
aware that all foreigners are unique individuals, and we
should not generalize them by nationality, ethnic groups,
and religion. Foreigners are visiting Japan for several
purposes such as sightseeing, studying abroad or working.
Likewise, depending on the length of time in Japan or their
cultural background, the problem they encounter greatly
varies, and there will never be a solution applicable for
everyone. Especially, the problems which foreign visitors
face are derived from not knowing Japanese cultural
keywords exemplified previously (and there are countless of
other words, not only “Kodawari” or “Omotenashi”), or it
occurs when the meaning of keywords conflict with their
cultural beliefs in various communicative settings. To
propose a way to solve their problems individually, thus
creating new media to provide foreigners opportunities to
know Japanese culture at a deeper level is meaningful from
a cross-cultural viewpoint. In other words, foreign visitors
further understanding of Japanese culture will be achieved
when they listen to local people’s story in a particular place,
or other foreigners opinion about the place they are visiting.
In terms of tourists revisiting places, previous literature
has shown the effect of motivation and satisfaction is
prominent according to Yoon [3] and Bramwell [4]. Alegre
[5] and Ekinci et al. [6] also pointed out, the eagerness of
tourists’ visiting in relation to the characteristics of places.

In terms of information system, Masuda [7] and Takagi [8]
suggested
a
recommender
system
for
tourists,
which
provides customized tour information, depending on user’s
needs, including using smartphone applications. However,
there is almost no
research on using Internet radio
specifically
as
a
tool
for
building
cross-cultural
understanding in Japan.
In this paper, we propose a place-oriented Internet radio
called CCR, which helps foreigners to recognize Japan from
a cross-cultural perspective by providing place oriented
content. In addition, we created an original criteria CCUS
and conducted an evaluation experiment in Tokyo to
measure the actual effectiveness of content and CCR itself.
The paper structure is explained as follows: first, Section
II describes the design phase of CCR including its concept
and system configuration. Secondly, detailed explanation of
measurement CCUS is offered in Section III, including
background research. Section IV gives a complete set of
evaluation experiments conducted in Tokyo, and Section V
digs the result into a further behavioral analysis. Lastly, the
conclusion and future works are mentioned in Section VI.
II.
DESIGN OF CROSS-CULTURAL RADIO
A. Concept
Previously referred related research, especially Masuda
and Takagi’s recommender system for tourists, are designed
for the usage in a specific place. However, the information
they provide to listeners only focuses on tourist’s preference
and does not include cultural perspectives of the host
country,
which
promotes
cross-cultural
understandings
amongst international listeners.
As for the type of information available, visual material
such as detailed information on smartphone contributes to
get a general idea about a place to a certain extent.
Nevertheless, sound information is far superior to visual
information in giving listeners flexibility, by allowing them
to stretch their imagination about what they have heard.
Furthermore,
sound
information
can
provide
direct
interaction connected to the place including local people’s
story or comments from other tourists. This also might be a
trigger for international listeners to understand Japanese
culture more.
For these reasons, this paper intends to propose a place
oriented Internet radio called CCR as a new sound-focused
media, by providing international listeners several types of
content. The detailed concept is shown in Figure 1.
CCR works in three steps. First is content design for
personalities.
Second
is
listening
process
by
various
listeners such as international tourists, studying abroad
students and multinational corporations employees who are
not familiar with Japanese culture. Third is getting feedback
plus revision of the content. To maximize the influence of
contents, the preferred target of CCR is international visitors
who are staying in Japan for a relatively long period of time,
from a few months to years rather than just a couple of days,
because, in general, understanding a certain culture often
takes time and the experience they have in the host country
is enriched in daily life settings.
Figure 1.
Concept of Cross-Cultural Radio “CCR”
Three types of content are available for international
visitors: the guidebook (audio clips from the famous Lonely
Planet guidebook), the locals (stories or tips from local
people), and tourists (feedback from the listener to be shared
with other tourists). As a first step of the cycle, this paper
explicitly deals with the content Guidebook and Locals.
B. System
Previous research [9]~[12] shows that the acceptable
duration of content should be around 1 minute to 1 and half
minutes. Several companies deal with the production of
audio guide players supporting the delivery of content as
described above.
1)
Selecting Location
As CCR is designed for international visitors for Japan.
The selection of a place where the content is mapped is also
important. In this research, Asakusa, one of the most famous
and popular tourist spots in Tokyo, was chosen. The reason
is that Asakusa has a rich cultural heritage such as Japanese
traditional temples or shrines, as well as dining venues and
souvenir shops that attract many international tourists.
Besides, Asakusa is located in the heart of Tokyo and has
great accessibility, which enables us to conduct fieldwork
effortlessly.
2)
Content “Guidebook”
For guidebook content, several tips of accommodation,
introduction of restaurants and explanation of famous
architecture were picked from Lonely Planet Tokyo [13]
and recorded using voice synthesis software (Figure 2).

Example of content Guidebook
3)
Content “Locals”
For locals content, a couple of interviews with locals
were conducted in Japanese and stories related to their daily
lives in Asakusa were selected. Each story was translated
into English and supplementary explanation about cultural
activity was added if needed (Figure 3).
Figure 3.
Example of content Locals

The audio clips are stored in the website, and linked to
icons using JavaScript code. When the user clicks on an icon,
the associated audio clip is played. The website can be

III.
MEASUREMENT CCUS
To validate the credibility of CCR, an evaluation process
with appropriate criteria is essential. Since CCR has a
unique concept, inventing a new and suitable measurement
tool is more realistic rather than using conventional criteria
without localization. Related literature about measurement
design and cross-cultural adjustment are demonstrated by
Benson [15], Cui & Awa [16] and Yellen [17]. Ten
dimensions of cross-cultural understandings have been
determined, which are:
A. Mobility
An individual’s ability to find his/her way around in the
foreign place is one of the most important dimensions of
cross-cultural understandings. Knowing local geography and
usage of public transportation systems are two potential
items for this dimension. Ability to ask staff around in the
face of uncertainty for directions, or usage of appropriate
tools such as map application on smartphone is included.
B. Food/Diet
Although food allergy is not the case, this dimension
involves being open-minded to try new food, and how he/she
can be adaptable for the change of diet. Accepting foreign
food
and
culinary
manners
cannot
be
omitted
when
understanding certain culture, and for many people eating
food is a big aspect of cultural exchange.
C. Flexibility
As Hofstede defined “uncertainty avoidance” in his
prominent work [18], more or less people from any cultural
background may face culture shock and attempt to escape
from that anxiety. Being flexible, patient, and tolerant for
such uncertain activity or unexpected cultural norm is one
dimension.
D. Knowledge
Whether he/she accepts it or not, acknowledgment of
host
culture
is
an
essential
aspect
of
cross-cultural
understandings. In terms of socially appropriate behaviors,
host country nationals have certain expectations as to how
foreigners in their country should behave includes avoiding
offensive actions. Webb et al.’s unobtrusive measure [19]
could be useful in this regard.
E. Language Skills
This dimension appears consistently as a core criterion
of mutual understanding as former literatures are reviewed.
However, we should be aware that when cultural adaptation
or acculturation occurs, an adapted individual will learn the
language, but individual who learn the language may or may
not adapt.
F. Interaction
The nature and frequency of interactions with host
country individuals is an indication of individual’s level of
cross-cultural understandings. This involves one’s ability to
“Asakusa Engei-hall”
Have you ever seen standup comedy in your country? If
you want to experience Japanese traditional comedy
performance, here is the place. This is called Asakusa
Engei-hall, provides humorous talking by classic rakugo
speakers. The audience also enjoys stage arts unique to
the theater, including the paper cutout and funny music
played by carpenters tool.
“Future of Asakusa”
(After the local’s interview in Japanese) Before World
War 2, Asakusa has been one of the most energetic,
cutting edge cities in Japan. But unfortunately nowadays
it’s taken over by other big cities like Roppongi or
Shinjuku. She feels to revitalize Asakusa as a vivid city,
collaboration with local community is important, not
only bringing lots of tourists from outside. Using social
networking service can be one of them; so young
generation helps older shop owners to introduce these
up-to-date technologies into traditional Japanese shops.

initiate interaction, as well as the extent of his/her eagerness
to
communicate
with
Japanese
people,
regardless
of
language ability.
G. Awareness of Cultural Differnce
A question such as “to what extent are you aware of
Japanese culture/society is different from yours?” is asked
in
this
dimension.
Recognition
of cultural
difference
between their own is a starting point to build mutual
understanding in any circumstances.
H. Nonverbal Communication
In addition to language, there are a variety of ways to
communicate nonverbally. Understanding visible gestures
and appreciating personal space are some of them. Also
having a reasonable repertoire of “communicative currency”
may be useful as a criterion dimension.
I.
Respect
Being interested in the host country citizens and casual
friendliness towards them should be relevant as cross-
cultural
understandings.
For
instance,
willingness
to
participate in activities distinctive to the host country will
raise a fundamental respect for others and might lead to an
appreciation of his/her current state.
J. Relationship
Inclination
to
establish
and
maintain
relationships
regardless of the skills is one crucial dimension. Even
though this can be influenced by an individual’s personal
character such as being extroverted or introverted, we
should be aware that every individual has his/her own pace
for building it. For instance, not all introverts are weak in
relationship building than extroverts; they will establish
deeper and more stable relationship with others.
After the relevant literature was reviewed and dimensions
mentioned above were rationalized, these new criteria were
named CCUS. In the evaluation phase, measurement users
score each dimensions from 1 to 10 (Figure 5), using the
self-evaluation method.
Figure 5.
Scoring system of CCUS
This evaluation is conducted twice, before and after any
related
experiments
such
as
fieldwork
or
interview.
Afterwards, two score results are compared and discussed.
IV.
EVALUATION EXPERIMENT
A. Method
Fieldwork was conducted for twelve international tourists
as CCR listeners, using the same scheme to explore how the
cycle of CCR works as an evaluation experiment. In order to
observe various cultural exchanges, we tried to select
tourists who have diverse cultural backgrounds, as well as
their length of stay in Japan. Fieldwork details and
participants’ attributes are below (Table 1).

B. Instruction
First, a sheet of paper was distributed to the participants
as an experiment instruction. Route of fieldwork is printed
and they were asked to walk and listen to the content
mapped into the route in the numeric order. Before they
started walking, they filled in the CCUS form. We observed
and took pictures of participants while they are walking
(Figure 11), and asked questions to participants for each
content such as “what did you think about the place or
object, which is explained in the content?” or “do you have
any implication or comments compared to your home
culture?”
Fieldwork was done either in English or Japanese,
depending on participant’s language ability. Conversation
was recorded and after they listened to all content, they
answered the CCUS form again.

Most of the dimensions are slightly improved after the

(+1.4pt), “Knowledge” (+1.0pt) and “Interaction” (+1.0pt)
have improved more than other dimensions, and “Language
skills” has declined a bit (-0.2pt).
V.
BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS OF PARTICIPANTS
As shown in the result, CCR has enriched most aspects
of dimensions. We will have a closer look at specific
participant’s
score
based
on
arbitrary choices,
which
recorded notable difference for “Flexibility”, “Knowledge”,
“Interaction” and “Language skills”, as well as who formed
distinct shape of ten dimensions.
A. Participant CH2 (Figure 7)
CH2 is a close friend of CH3 and they took part in the
evaluation experiment together. As she has never been in
Asakusa before, she was a beginner tourist in a way.
Figure 7.
Participant CH2’s CCUS score
Especially after listening to content “Guidebook” about
small museum shows and offering of Japanese traditional
handicrafts, she seemed to be interested in the place
mentioned and took a couple of pictures in front of it. She
had a conversation with CH3 in Chinese and invited CH3 to
go into the museum. Later on, CH2 told us they were
talking about the Japanese craftsmen’s elaborate work and
made a comparison with Chinese merchandise including
price. They recalled handicrafts sold in museum were very
expensive and unfortunately they were not able to purchase
any, nevertheless they were surprised of their good quality.
Talking with a peer participant in home language raised
satisfaction
to
enhance
“Flexibility”
and
“Nonverbal
communication”, which represents acculturation process
[20]~[22] including elimination of uncertainty towards
Japanese culture. It is assumed that CH2 has faced Japanese
craftsmen’s “Kodawari” to their works at the museum as her
tangible experience, and the content worked as the trigger of
cultural encounter.
B. Participant UZ (Figure 8)
UZ is a university student who has been studying
Japanese for two years, and shows a great enthusiasm
towards understanding local cultures. He was particularly
interested in the concept of CCR and was cooperative for
taking part in the evaluation experiment. He was walking
the main street of Asakusa called Nakamise-dori, and after
he listened to the content where a local person discussed the
future of Asakusa (Fig. 3), he mentioned his hometown
Samarkand. He told he genuinely would love but because of
financial reasons lots of residents are leaving the city and
flowing into Toshkent, the capital of Uzbekistan and he
feels sad about it. He wishes people in Samarkand will love
their city just like as Asakusa locals do. Obviously he felt
something in common with Japanese people and cultivated
affinity toward Japanese culture. In other words, he got an
idea
of
Asakusa
locals’
“Omotenashi”
mind
to
the
foreigners, as his own mindset in himself when he would
feel in Uzbekistan.

external factors are about the context of both content.
Internal factors are invisible cultural aspects such as
Asakusa locals’ attitude or value to the place, in relation to
his
radical
improvement
of
“Awareness
of
cultural
difference”. On the contrary, external factors are attainable
by information input, corresponds to “Knowledge”. The
synthesis of these noticeable two dimensions has appeared
as the improvement of “Flexibility”.
C. Participant JP (Figure 9)
JP is a friend of UK and they took part in the experiment
together. Although born in Japan and being a Japanese
citizen, she has international background. She is half Korean
and was raised in Hawaii.
Figure 9.
Participant JP’s CCUS score
After
she
listened
to
“Locals”
content
about
the
founding story of Nakamise-dori and a kindergarten nearby,
she
remembered
when
she
learned
phonetics
in
her
childhood in Hawaii. As she has an Asian look some peers
automatically assumed that she does not understand any
English, hence she had a hard time to build close friendship
with them. Now English is her native language and similar
circumstance occurs when she encounters Japanese people
who guess she would understand Japanese perfectly whilst
she actually does not. JP admits “that awkward and
annoying
moment”
frequently
happens
whenever
she
recognizes disappointment on their faces. JP’s the biggest
decline “Language skills” is not irrelevant with her story.
On the other hand, she improved “Mobility”, explained in
her comment “now I feel more confident walking in
Asakusa without GoogleMaps”.
D. Participant UK (Figure 10)
The fieldwork for JP and UK was conducted in English
since we wanted to encourage the casual conversation
between two peers, which enabled us to observe frequent
cultural exchange. UK arrived in Japan about 2 months
before the fieldwork, and had just started learning Japanese
language and culture.
Figure 10. Participant UK’s CCUS score
According to his feedback, “Locals” content was more
enjoyable than “Guidebook” although he had never visited
Asakusa before. JP and UK take the same courses in their
studying abroad and had established a good rapport already.
UK is researching theories of traditional Japanese music for
his master degree, so it is reasonable to assume that he is
more
interested
in
Japanese
culture
than
most
of
international tourists. He may have felt sympathy to the
local people talking and that influenced his improvement of
“Relationship”, “Awareness of cultural difference” and
“Interaction”.
VI.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE STUDIES
In this paper, place oriented Internet radio called CCR
was
proposed
by
providing
two
types
of
content,
“Guidebook” and “Locals” which gives an idea about real
cultural
aspects
of
Japan,
represented
as
“cultural
keywords”. To validate the effectiveness of this unique
media, we also suggested CCUS as new criteria set to
measure
the
level
of
cross-cultural
understanding.
According to the overall result of evaluation experiment
conducted in Tokyo for 12 participants, it is reasonable to
assume CCR has contributed to the enhancement of several
aspects such as “Flexibility” and “Interaction” which are
cultivated by listening to local’s stories, and “Knowledge”
in relation to the information provided by the guidebook.
Besides,
through
advanced
behavioral
analysis
for
individual participants, some cultural aspects were found
such as;
1)
Uncertainty Avoidance
Participants CH2 and CH3 both improved “Flexibility”
through their conversation about Japanese culture in home
language. CCR content will be more understandable when
cultural uncertainty is reduced, and participants’ verbal and
nonverbal interaction greatly contributes to them.

2)
Affinity towards Culture
For some participants, CCR content functioned as a
sympathy builder. For instance, UZ listened to the “Locals”
content illustrates local people’s values and felt something
in common with his own culture. In his specific case, his
cultural appreciation enhanced “Awareness of cultural
difference” and “Nonverbal communication”.
3)
Awareness of Language Skills
We observed the drop of “Language skills” in certain
participant such as JP. Possibly this is because after the
experiment she was more aware of her level of Japanese
proficiency by listening to the “Locals” content, spoken
partially in Japanese native speed. In addition, it is quite
reasonable to say that just listening to a sequence of short
audio clips will not enrich one’s language skill hugely. In
fact, sometimes it even causes a small decline of confidence.
For the future work, we will develop the variety of place-
oriented content and add more participant of the evaluation
experiment so CCUS will be more reliable. Additionally, the
introduction of content “Tourists” to encourage listener’s
self/mutual reflection between other listeners is needed, to
compare with conventional “Locals” and “Guidebook”
content.
