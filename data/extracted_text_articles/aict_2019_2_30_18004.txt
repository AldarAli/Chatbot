Abstract— Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) uses the edge
of the network to bring computing closer to consumers and the
data generated by applications, which reduces latency and
increases connection speeds. 5G is the next generation of
mobile networks that promises to have estimated network
speeds as fast as 10 Gb/s and ultra-reliable low latency
communication. Both MEC and 5G are considered disrupting
technologies on their own, but combined, they will become a
powerful force in the world of computing. Connected Vehicles
and especially Connected Autonomous Driving (CAD) vehicles
bring a whole new ecosystem with new requirements on the
network architecture to support and to satisfy the real-time
service requirements. This paper provides an overview of the
automotive use cases, some of the key challenges and how
MEC and 5G can play a vital role in overcoming these
challenges.

INTRODUCTION
The automotive industry is evolving towards connected
and autonomous vehicles that offer many benefits, such as
improved safety, less traffic congestion, less environmental
impacts and lower capital expenditure. A key enabler of this
evolution is vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication,
which allows a vehicle to communicate with other vehicles,
pedestrians, road-side equipment and the Internet. With
V2X, critical information can be exchanged among vehicles
to improve situation awareness and thus avoid accidents.
Furthermore, V2X provides reliable access to the vast
information available in the cloud. For example, real time
traffic, sensor and high-definition mapping data can be made
available, which is useful not only for today’s drivers, but
will be essential for navigating self-driving vehicles in the
future.
The paper is organized as follows: Section II provides an
overview of the V2X communication and use cases, Section
III describes the current status of V2X implementation using
the standard IEEE 802.11p. Section IV describes the Cellular
V2X and the associated use cases. In Section V, we propose
the application of V2X using MEC-based architecture
support in the 5G infrastructure. It provides insights into how
emerging 5G technologies will accelerate the realization of
advanced V2X communication to improve transportation
experience and quality of life. For example, 5G-based V2X
is expected to enable very high throughput, high reliability,
low latency and accurate position determination use cases.
Some of the use cases will involve 5G working in tandem
with other technologies including cameras, radar and lidar.
Cellular V2X Communications Towards 5G [3] describes
these use cases, starting with the advanced driving categories
identified in 3GPP, including ranging/positioning, extended
sensors,
platooning
and
remote
driving.
The
paper
conclusion is that a combination of these technologies can be
helpful in achieving the strict requirements of the V2X
communication. It also summarizes how mobile network
operators, vehicle manufacturers, cloud service providers and
regulatory bodies can work together to deliver a brand-new
experience for drivers, travelers and other road users in the
near future.
II.
OVERVIEW OF V2X
V2X, which stands for 'vehicle to everything', is the
umbrella term for the car's communication system, where
information from sensors and other sources travels via high-
bandwidth, low-latency, high-reliability links, paving the
way to fully autonomous driving.
There are several components of V2X, including vehicle-
to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), vehicle-to-
pedestrian
(V2P),
and
vehicle-to-network
(V2N)
communications. In this multifaceted ecosystem, cars will
talk to other cars, to infrastructure such as traffic lights or
parking
spaces,
to
smartphone-toting
pedestrians
and
cyclists, and to data centers via cellular networks. Different
use cases will have different sets of requirements, which the
communications system must handle efficiently and cost-
effectively.

of

communication [1]. It is implied that these communications
are generally bidirectional.

Types of V2X Communication
V2V technology consists of wireless data transmissions
between motor vehicles. The primary purpose of this
communication is to prevent possible accidents, allowing

vehicles in transit to transfer data on their position and their
speed within an ad-hoc mesh network. It uses a decentralized
connection system, which may provide either a fully
connected mesh topology or a partially connected mesh
topology.
Depending on how the technology is developed, the
driver of a vehicle can receive a warning in the event of an
accident risk or the vehicle itself can independently take
preventive actions, such as emergency braking, if it is
designed to carry out safety interventions.
Unlike the V2V communication model, which allows the
exchange of information only among vehicles, the V2I
enables vehicles in transit to interface with the road system.
These components include RFID readers, traffic lights,
cameras, lane markers, street lamps, signage, and parking
meters.
V2P involves direct communications between a vehicle
and one or multiple pedestrians within close proximity. In
addition, communication can be to other vulnerable road
users, such as cyclists. V2P is conducted directly or through
the use of network infrastructure. It will facilitate warnings
to be provided to the pedestrian of an approaching vehicle,
and warnings to the vehicle of vulnerable road users.
V2N enables both broadcast and unicast communications
to take place between vehicles and the V2X management
system and also the V2X AS (Application Server). This is
achieved
by
making
use
of
the
Cellular
network
infrastructure. Vehicles are able receive broadcasted alerts
regarding accidents further down the road or warnings of
congestion or queues on the planned route.
V2V and V2P transmission are based on primarily
broadcast capability between vehicles or between vehicles
and vulnerable road users (e.g., pedestrian, cyclist), such as
for providing information about location, velocity and
direction to avoid accidents.
The 5G Automotive Association (5GAA) categorizes a
comprehensive list of connected vehicle applications [1] [2],
categorized in four main groups of use cases:

Safety,

Convenience,

Advanced Driving Assistance and

Vulnerable Road User (VRU).
To maximize the benefit that connected vehicles can
bring, fast, secure and reliable wireless communications are
required.
Various vehicular communication standards have been
proposed over the years with the dominant standard known
as IEEE 802.11p. IEEE 802.11p defines only the lower
layers of the communication system. The upper layers are
defined in separate standards: in the US this is IEEE 1609
while in Europe this is ITS-G5.
III.
V2X BASED ON IEEE 802.11P
The original V2X standard is based on a Wi-Fi
offshoot, IEEE 802.11p (part of the IEEE's WAVE, or
Wireless Access for Vehicular Environments program),
running in the unlicensed 5.9GHz frequency band. IEEE
802.11p, which was finalized in 2012, underpins Dedicated
Short-Range Communications (DSRC) in the US, and ITS-
G5 in
the
European
Cooperative
Intelligent
Transport
Systems (C-ITS) initiative.
V2X communication via 802.11p goes beyond line-of-
sight-limited sensors such as cameras, radar and LIDAR, and
covers V2V and V2I use cases such as collision warnings,
speed limit alerts, and electronic parking and toll payments.
The DSRC system transmits a basic safety message
(BSM) between
vehicles [3] [4]. The BSM includes
information such as exact vehicle location and direction of
travel, speed, braking status, and some other useful and
relevant data. The driver doesn’t see it, but the BSM
provides safety warnings and could trigger action such as
automatic braking or other collision avoidance maneuvers or
warnings. The BSM is updated and transmitted 10 times per
second [5] [6].
Another
proposed
function
of
DSRC
is
V2I
communications. The vehicle links up with roadside access
points that can provide additional useful information, such as
traffic or road conditions, weather, construction and traffic
light status. A V2N connection is also possible for other
services to be determined.
However, DSRC has several limitations. There is no
apparent path for continued evolution of the radio standard to
meet
changing
technological
and
consumer
needs.
Additionally, as it was designed for rapid transmission of
short-range basic safety messages, it is unable to meet the
higher bandwidth demands of V2N applications such as
autonomous
driving,
multimedia
services.
DSRC
also
doesn’t have the bandwidth necessary to transmit the raw
vehicle sensor data that will become increasingly common in
automated vehicles [3]. DSRC also has limited range: about
300 m.
DSRC
would
require
the
deployment
of
tens
of
thousands of RoadSide Units (RSUs) embedded or attached
to roadway infrastructure to enable an effective network
along the nation’s roads [3].
In summary, there are several challenges present with
DSRC. First, the system relies on RSUs, which are not
currently deployed. Secondly, at the physical layer, several
inefficiencies arise due to the asynchronous nature of the
system, resulting in reduced performance, such as range. The
worst packet delay in DSRC is unbounded and it also lacks
deterministic Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. Due to
the ad hoc nature of DSRC, it is difficult to bind the worst
case CSMA backoff time for MAC scheduling. Finally, there
is currently no evolutionary path (or IEEE 802.11 standards
activities)
to
allow
for
improvements
in
the
DSRC
physical/MAC layers with respect to range, robustness and
reliability [1].
However, a complementary technology, LTE and 5G
cellular systems, has the potential to support existing DSRC
use cases [7] [8]. In addition to that, low latency, high
reliability and high bandwidth offered by the cellular systems
can play a pivotal role in supporting advanced, futuristic and
more challenging features and use cases [9] [10].

IV.
CELLULAR V2X
A challenger to DSRC for V2X has emerged from the
cellular industry: it is called C-V2X and it is designed to
complement
and
extend
existing
cellular
capabilities.
Cellular V2X is an umbrella term for 3GPP-defined V2X
technologies, encompassing both LTE- and forthcoming 5G-
based V2X systems.
LTE cellular networks are already deployed and cover
most parts of the world. With the planned deployment of 5G
in 2020, it will further enhance the network capabilities.
C-V2X can be used in many possible different ways to
improve road safety, while making more efficient use of
transport
networks
and
infrastructure.
The
Intelligent
Transportation Systems (TIS) services can be broadly
categorized
into
safety-related
services
and
non-safety
related services. This section gives examples of the many use
cases in which C-V2X can help to enhance safety and
improve user experience [11]:
1) Vehicle Status Warning. The Vehicle Status Warning
use case includes vehicle detection of abnormal safety
conditions and signaling the associated danger to others.
2) Traffic Hazard Warning. The Traffic Hazard Warning
use case includes vehicle or road infrastructure alerting other
approaching vehicles of immobilized vehicles (e.g., an
accident, a breakdown, etc.) or current roadwork. This use
case prevents collisions by helping vehicles to avoid a
dangerously immobilized vehicle situation or roadwork.
3) Collision Risk Warning. The Collision Risk Warning
use case includes informing a vehicle of approaching
vehicles intending to turn across traffic. This feature
mitigates the risk of collision at an intersection by warning
vehicles in the affected area. A RSU detects and alerts two or
more vehicles.
4) Traffic Condition Warning. The Traffic Condition
Warning use case allows vehicles and roadside stations to
signal to other vehicles of current traffic conditions. This
function helps drivers to choose the best route and leads to
less traffic congestion and brings environmental benefits by
reducing energy consumption.
5) Queue warning. Roadside infrastructure can also use
C-V2X to warn vehicles of queues or road works ahead of
them, so they can slow down smoothly and avoid hard
braking. More broadly, the roadside infrastructure can use C-
V2X to help vehicles retain a consistent speed and reduce the
number of so-called phantom traffic jams caused by the
ripple effect caused by sudden braking and lane changes on
motorways.
6) Avoiding collisions. Each vehicle on the road could
use C-V2X to broadcast its identity, position, speed and
direction. An on-board computer could combine that data
with that from other vehicles to build its own real time map
of the immediate surroundings and determine whether any
other vehicle is on a potential collision trajectory. The
vehicles involved could then take an evasive action, such as
braking or accelerating, that will enable a collision to be
avoided. In cases where a human driver is about to cause an
accident, the information collected by C-V2X could be used
to over-ride the manual controls. For example, if a driver is
about to pull out at a junction into the path of another
vehicle, the on-board computer could automatically apply
the brakes and prevent the car from moving forward.
7) Automated overtake. Fully-automated vehicles will
need to perform overtake maneuvers on two-way roads. Such
maneuvers may be dangerous as a quickly approaching
oncoming vehicle may be out-of-range of vehicle sensors.
Vehicles thus need to cooperate to allow a safe overtake
without a risk of collision.
See through sensors enable the exchange of video
information between a vehicle and the one behind it. For
instance, a vehicle behind a truck receives a video stream
coming from the camera at the front of the truck. This will
give the driver an extended vision of the environment, thus
allowing safer decision making (e.g. when the vehicle
decides to overtake the truck). Such use cases require a high
reliability, availability and data rate, as well as a low latency.
8) High Definition Map (HDMap) download. In fully
autonomous driving, the use of usual 2D digital roadmaps is
not enough. Indeed, autonomous vehicles require precise
information about their complex environment. HDMaps
represent a new generation of maps that could be used for
this purpose. Such maps have high precision at centimeter
level accuracy, but require high data rate to be downloaded
by vehicles.
9) Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC). The
CACC use case uses unicast V2X cooperative awareness
messages to obtain lead vehicle dynamics and general traffic
ahead of a vehicle.This allows the vehicle to enhance the
performances of its existing ACC.
10) Platooning refers to the formation of a convoy in
which the vehicles are much closer together than can be
safely
achieved
with
human
drivers.
Such
automated
convoys make better use of road space, save fuel and make
the transport of goods more efficient. C-V2X can be used to
enable communications between up to three vehicles in the
platoon,
so
that
they
all
slow
down
or
speed
up
simultaneously. C-V2X could also be used to signal the
presence of the platoon to other vehicles and roadside
infrastructure. Platoons will be flexible in that they will
typically be established on a motorway, then broken up when
a vehicle leaves the motorway. For platoons of more than
three vehicles, relaying information between vehicles takes
too long to enable synchronous braking. Therefore, platoons
of more than three vehicles will also need to make use of the
low latency cellular network infrastructure that will be
deployed with 5G [12].
11) Out-of-Coverage Operation. C-V2X can operate
outside of network coverage using direct communication
without requiring provisioning of a Universal Subscriber
Identity
Module
(USIM).
To
enable
USIM-less
communication,
automobile
Original
Equipment
Manufacturers (OEMs) will pre-configure the vehicle device
with parameters necessary for out-of-network operation [4],
including:

Authorization to use V2X.

A list of authorized application classes and the
frequencies to use for them.

Radio parameters for use on direct links.


Configuration for receiving V2X messages via
cellular
broadcast,
for
example,
Multimedia
Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS).
Direct USIM-less communication allows C-V2X to
support critical safety services when network coverage is
unavailable or if the vehicle does not have an active cellular
subscription. These parameters can also be securely updated,
if needed, by the OEM, just like any other updates. Vehicle
OEMs and mobile operators can work together to ensure the
parameters they each provision are compatible, resulting in
harmonious operation of various vehicle devices using the
direct link in an area.
There are two modes of LTE V2X operation: direct and
via the network [13].
Direct communication uses the LTE PC5 interface,
which
is
based
on
Release
12’s
proximity
services
communications
(“ProSe”)
feature
[14].
It
also
has
enhancements to accommodate high speeds/high doppler,
high
vehicle
density,
improved
synchronization
and
decreased message transfer latency. This mode is suitable for
proximal direct communications (hundreds of meters) and
for V2V safety applications that require low latency, for
example Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS),
situational awareness, etc. This mode can work both in and
out of network coverage.
Network-based
communication
uses
the
LTE
Uu
interface from the UE located in the vehicle and the eNBs.
UEs send unicast messages via the eNB to an application
server,
which,
in
turn,
broadcasts
them
via
evolved
Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (eMBMS) for all
UEs in the relevant geographical area to receive. This mode
uses the existing LTE Wide Area Network (WAN) and is
suitable for more latency-tolerant use cases (e.g., situational
awareness, mobility services).
With widely deployed infrastructure in major countries,
LTE has proven its reliability in bandwidth and coverage
area. In spite of such convenience, LTE is still only trusted
with non-time critical and non-safety critical communication
such as hyperlocal weather, road conditions, traffic data, etc.
The
main
concern
comes
from
the
centralized
LTE
architecture. On the data plane, we have eNodeB (eNB), the
Serving Gateway (S-Gw), and the Packet Gateway (P-Gw).
eNBs are normally distributed across the nation providing
radio access to User Equipment (UE), while S-Gw and P-Gw
are part of the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) located at highly
centralized data centers. Since the P-Gw anchors all UEs IP
addresses, all user plane packets must cross a large backbone
network to reach P-Gw of EPC before being routed towards
their destination. The actual end to end LTE packet delay
could be as high as 60-100 ms, exceeding the designed 20
ms user plane latency. Therefore, current cellular networks
become unsuitable for time critical safety messaging [15].
To
decrease
latency,
LTE-D2D
and
LTE-V
are
developed, where user devices communicate directly to their
target rather than going through a base station and the core
networks. However, they share similar issues with most
distributed communication. If the wireless access channels
are
managed
by
the
LTE
scheduler,
we
can
only
communication between two stationary devices under the
same cell coverage, otherwise the mobility issue could also
be challenging.
Since V2X must be deployed in the near term and should
be extended to the future, it must offer the necessary high
performance to meet use cases, e.g., intersection movement
assistance,
emergency
electronic
brake
light,
forward
collision warning, blind spot warning, lane change warning,
etc., while being future proof and scalable to meet the
requirements of use cases of tomorrow, e.g., ADAS, where
vehicles
can
cooperate,
coordinate
and
share
sensed
information, and ultimately CAD.
V.
5G, MEC AND C-V2X
In this section, we propose/analyze an edge-computing
architecture based on 5G for C-V2X in light of some of the
standard use-cases discussed above.
The stringent latency requirements posed by the V2X
system can be satisﬁed by introducing Multi-access Edge 
Computing (MEC) technology to the cellular network
architecture. Let us consider a MEC-assisted network
architecture, in which MEC hosts are collocated with
eNBs/gNBs. They can receive and process VRU messages at
the edge of the access network. Leveraging its ability to
provide processing capabilities at the cellular network’s
edge, an overlaid MEC deployment is expected to assist
vehicles in achieving low packet delays, due to its close
proximity to end users. By means of numerical evaluation, it
has already been observed that, for some of the investigated
system parameterizations, the proposed overlaid deployment
of MEC hosts can offer up to 80% average gains in latency
reduction
as
compared
to
the
conventional
network
architecture [16].
Focusing on the C-V2X technology, the architecture of
the cellular network is expected to have a vital impact on the
support of delay-intolerant V2X services. This occurs
because the End-to-End (E2E) latency of C-V2X signaling is
limited by the quality and dimensioning of the cellular
infrastructure, i.e., the capacity of backhaul connections, the
delays introduced by both the Core Network (CN), as well as
the Transport Network (TN). As one would expect, these
latency bottlenecks will be more prominent for high loads
corresponding
to
coverage
areas
of
high
vehicular/
pedestrian densities. MEC can play an important role in
overcoming these challenges and reducing the latency in
high density scenarios [16].
Figure 2 illustrates the typical network scenario where
MEC and 5G infrastructure will be deployed to support the
challenging requirements of C-V2X communication and
support the various use cases listed above. Another variant of
this network scenario can be where MEC, 5G and 4G
infrastructure co-exist. The edge supports some of the core
network functionalities that are hosted from the core
network. The existing eNB/gNB and/or the RSUs with
processing and storage capabilities can also be used to host
some of the core network functionalities.

Figure 2.
C-V2X Network Architecture with MEC and 5G
5G will support a broad range of V2X and non-V2X use
cases [18], including enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB),
massive Internet of Things (mIoT) and mission-critical
services.
These
use
cases
have
diverse
requirements,
including high data rates for eMBB, low power consumption
and high scalability for mIoT, as well as Ultra-Reliable and
Low Latency Communications (URLLC) for mission-critical
services [17]-[19].
Network slicing allows network operators to define
different types of services and dynamically allocate proper
resources to support this end-to-end service by configuring
different network segments. By using slicing technology, one
physical network can be divided into multiple virtual
networks, each supporting different service requirements or
even different customers [20].
V2N and communication via the network are typical use
cases for network slicing. For instance, autonomous driving
or safety/emergency services would require an URLLC
network
slice.
Meanwhile,
some
auxiliary/comfort
or
personal mobility services would require either a best effort
slice or an eMBB slice in the case of streaming infotainment
videos. A given vehicle could access different slices at the
same time, with passengers watching an HD movie while a
see-through application detects a road hazard and triggers an
emergency message for the cars behind or nearby to slow
down or stop to prevent an accident.
C-V2X is designed to be fully compatible with 5G,
meaning investments in infrastructure and modules today
will not become obsolete for a long time to come.
The deployment of commercial 5G networks from 2020
onwards based on the 3GPP standards will enhance C-V2X
in several different ways [11]. In the 5G era, C-V2X will be
able to support:

Very precise positioning and ranging to support
cooperative and automated driving.

High throughput and low-latency connectivity to
enable the exchange of raw or processed data
gathered through local sensors or live video images.

High throughput to build local, dynamic maps based
on camera and sensor data, which can then be
distributed at street intersections. For example, C-
V2X could be used to supply a driver or an on-board
computer with a bird’s eye view of an intersection or
see-through capability when driving behind a truck.

Very low latency and high reliability to support
high-density platooning [21] [22].
VI.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have described various V2X use cases,
existing DSRC implementation for V2X communication, its
advantages and some of the challenges associated with it.
Also, we have covered the Cellular V2X, which is entering
the vehicular communication space, in competition with the
tried and tested DSRC.
Cellular
V2X
communication
has
the potential
to
enhance the traffic safety, comfort and is going to play a
crucial role in supporting the future use cases towards
autonomous driving. However, under high load conditions, it
might not be able to meet the latency requirements for the
safety related use cases. The automotive industry, OEMs,
standard bodies need to work towards the co-existence of
these technologies to leverage the full potential, which will
make 802.11p and LTE-A/5G more compatible, and can
even consider the option to merge the two, to create a
heterogeneous vehicular networking system that leverages
the best of both – the ability of 802.11p to support safety-
related use-cases, and the ability of LTE-A/5G to support
non-safety-related use-cases.
Widespread
deployment
of
Multi-access
Edge
Computing in 5G networks can help in achieving the latency
requirements to support safety-related use-cases and will act
as accelerators for autonomous driving cars. Network slicing
is also going to play an important role to meet the diverse
requirements of a variety of safety related and non-safety
related use-cases. However, security and safety aspects will
play an important role for V2X communication, be it DSRC,
LTE, MEC or 5G.
