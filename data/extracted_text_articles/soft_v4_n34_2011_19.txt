Abstract—There 
are 
many 
indicators 
of 
sustainable 
development of towns defined by urban specialists, sociologists, 
economists, etc. The paper presents the first part of a project 
whose goal is to find indicators of harmonic development of 
towns based on analysis of forty years development of fifty 
Czech towns. The indicators are studied in land use spatial 
changes, demography and road traffic intensity changes. First 
ten towns were processed for the period between 1970 and 
2009 being mapped in general urban land use classes and 
related to the measured road density. City land use class areas 
were derived from combination of actual and historical city 
plans and remote sensing data using geographic information 
system tools. It was found that the traffic intensity within 
towns and to and from towns is more dependent on existence of 
close highways and by-pass roads unlike number of 
inhabitants, e.g. Political changes from the communist regime 
to the democratic one was also an important breakpoint in the 
city developments. Increase of the road traffic intensity and 
enlarging of residential areas are features proving the fact. The 
paper presents a methodology of spatial mapping of land use 
classes utilized for determination of town development. The 
city developments and their relation to road traffic are 
documented on maps and graphs. 
Keywords-GIS; remote sensing data; city plan; number of 
inhabitants;  urban model;  land use;  road traffic intensity 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
The development of cities during last decades has faced 
us with a new situation. Most inhabitants in many European 
countries are concentrated in large towns. One fifth of the 
Czech Republic population is living in three largest towns – 
Prague, Brno and Ostrava. Fig. 1 shows percentage of 
inhabitants of all analyzed cities compared to two largest 
cities of the country- Prague and Brno - forming nearly half 
of inhabitants; therefore, the results of the analysis can be 
regarded as really representative.  
Present state of the balance among consumption level of 
society and quality of life is a matter of scientific papers, 
research [2][5][6], many projects [1][7], and political and 
economical discussions in many countries. Life quality is 
directly related to a lot of environmental and socio-
economic conditions. These conditions determine a 
harmonic development which should be based on equivalent 
and adequate demands of the human society. To define 
“adequate” means to take into account both consumption, 
and quality of life. Both are closely connected to the road 
traffic and its intensity.

the framework of the Czech Republic 
 
The Department of Mapping and Cartography has been 
processing a COST project focused on a detailed evaluation 
of relations between the quality of life and present behavior 
of the human society. The project goal is to create a model 
allowing improving the present development status in urban 
areas being less demanding and ensuring their sustainable 
development. 
The project is a logical continuation of several projects 
performed by specialists from the Czech Technical 
University (CTU) in Prague in the Czech Republic and the 
State Institute for Regional Planning who have collected and 
summarized large data volume of fifty towns (including 
three largest ones - Prague, Brno and Ostrava) on: 
1. Functional typology comprising five general land 
use classes: housing and infrastructure areas 
summarized into a residential one, industrial and 
agricultural  production areas named areas of 
production, areas of  traffic, areas of recreation 
including sport and green vegetation land, surface 
water areas, etc., and areas of other functions like 
arable 
land, 
orchards, 
meadows, 
technical 
infrastructure – waste water treatment plant areas, 
quarries, e.g., this classification is used by urban 
planners and the individual city land use maps  
utilize its list.  
2. The second group of land use has been collected 
and recorded by the Czech Office for Surveying,

Statistical 
Office 
and consists of urban, 
agriculture, forest and water surface areas and other 
function areas. The data are related to 1970, 1980, 
1990, 2000, 2005, and 2008.  
3. Basic components of the environment. 
4. Basic components of the social and economical 
development. 
The last two groups of data were collected within many 
diploma theses for individual cities as the statistical data 
were recorded for districts only. 
The previous projects were focused on statistical data 
collected from the above mentioned sources and their 
processing. They did not comprise any spatial data and no 
spatial analyses were performed. Their city collection 
resulted in a large range of cities differing by population 
(from seventeen thousand to more than one million 
inhabitants), 
by 
economic 
orientation 
(agricultural, 
industrial, university, touristic), by natural conditions 
(lowland surrounded by agricultural areas, mountainous 
situated large forest areas), by geographic position in the 
republic – close/far to a frontier, etc. The city set is a good 
sample covering practically all Czech city types. 
       The processed project is focused on two new views – to 
select suitable indicators of the sustainable city development 
in the Czech Republic using also spatial characteristics 
together with already collected ones, and the role of the road 
traffic intensity in the development of cities and their mutual 
relation and impacts. 
Individual land use areas offer different conditions for 
living. The same land use classes in different areas and 
therefore all spatial units are characterized by a long list of 
attributes.  
II. 
CZECH CITIES AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT 
The Czech Republic does not have a continuous political 
and urban development. The development was formed 
mainly by political decisions having a decisive role of the 
urban land use changes. After the Second World War the 
urban development was relatively uneven and can be 
characterized by three types of cities. One type of cities had 
only a relatively slow and continuous spatial evolution 
within their administrative boundaries. The second type are 
cities with growing administrative areas; however, this 
growth was artificial as a result of political decisions to join 
surrounding villages to a close city.  This joining was in two 
phases in 70-ies and 1989. The third group of towns is 
similar to the second one; the only difference is in their 
further separation of one or more early joined villages. The 
separations occurred after changing of the political regime 
in the country at the end of 1989 from the communist to the 
democratic regime. This development definition was firstly 
described and denoted by Vepřek [8]. He uses three new 
terms: core area for town size representing in most cases a 
status in 70-ies of the 20th century (1974, 1976). These were 
years when the process of joining villages to neighbor cities 
became an important phenomenon in administrative 
structure of the country. The joined areas are named 
associated areas by Vepřek in [8]. Urban parts in associated 
regions are denoted agglomerated ones by Vepřek in [8]. 
The parts, which became independent villages, are called 
peripheral areas by Vepřek in [8].  
These spatial developments is archived in Cadastre books 
in the form of table records showing concerned cadastre 
districts and also in COSMC data available on its portal as 
excel files.  The transfer of this information into spatial data 
can show the spatial city development using the cadastre 
districts´ boundaries of an appropriate period. This transfer 
was performed also into city plans, whose processing 
intervals vary in individual towns. City size evolutions 
cannot be derived from remote sensing data. If a town 
belongs to the second or third group, there are large spatial 
changes. The largest parts of these changes are in prevailing 
part represented by agricultural areas. The main difference 
between a core area and associated area are separated urban 
parts occurring in them. 
III. 
LAND USE MAPS 
The forty years spatial development is characterized (in 
the project) by land use maps of functional classes in 2009, 
2000, 1990, 1980 and 1970. High number of cities covering 
large areas demanded to use time effective method for their 
mapping. Their creation was based on adaptation of city 
plans, remote sensing and statistical data.  
Each urban area has a city plan as given by the Czech 
Law. Land use class determinations were done from land 
use classes applied by urban engineers in city plans which 
have been processed in several-year periods differently in 
individual cities. Therefore the city plans were the first 
information layer for urban land use maps processing. The 
plans comprise maps of the current land use/cover state and 
proposals for the future development and it was necessary to 
separate the urban plans. The process started by creation of 
the latest year map and ended by the 1970 land use map. 
A. Determination of  Land Use Classes 
The first step of creating of the first time level of each 
land use map was a reclassification of the original city plan 
classes. The city map legends are not standardized in the 
country, however, their class lists are more detailed than the 
classes used in the project. The reclassification reflects both 
five above mentioned land use classes and the COSMC land 
use 
classes 
distinguishing 
different 
ones: 
built-up, 
agricultural, forest, water, and other areas.  
The final functional classes were residential, production, 
recreational, traffic and other areas. Each class is therefore 
formed by a higher number of city plan classes. The 
residential area is formed by mixed residential region, 
general residential and rural ones, and public areas, e.g. The 
reclassification means also including local roads belonging 
to roads of low level in the state road hierarchy into 
residential or other surrounding areas. The reclassification is

performed individually for each town according to its city 
plan classes.   
The advantage of this approach was the fact that the basic 
classification was performed by urban specialists.  
B. Land Use Mapping  
As the city plans comprise not only a real status, but also 
an urban plan (as it was mentioned above), the next step was 
to verify the present city plans and the real state of cities as 
they can and really significantly differ from the real state 
especially in newly urbanized areas. The second reason for 
the verification is also the city plans´ date of origin. This part 
of the processing was done by visual interpretation of the 
remote sensing data (aerial photographs) combined with a 
change registration/vectorization of the vector city plan and 
the result was a map of functional classes of the present state. 
The first map = the latest one (2009) was a result of the 
present city plan processing by implementing corrections 
found in discrepancies between the plan and aerial 
orthophotographs. 
The previous time level of the land use map was derived 
from the present land use map copy by comparison with 
aerial photographs collected in between 1950 and 2000, and 
satellite image data (Thematic Mapper, MSS data) covering 
time span from 1970 to 2000. The satellite data were used for 
detection of land use changes between two time levels [6]. 
They were derived from a subtraction of original satellite 
image bands and normalized vegetation index in two 
different years (the 2008 band minus 2000 band, e.g.) and 
thresholding of the subtracted bands making the verification 
easier and quicker. Found changes were pixels with high 
positive or negative values. This approach yielded areas with 
different land cover, however, there was an additional task to 
determine and “translate” each land cover change into 
appropriate land use change. Each functional class comprises 
a wide range of the land cover classes in the aerial 
photographs spatial resolution; however, these detailed 
classes are not in prevailing part detectable on the Thematic 
Mapper data. The Thematic Mapper resolution does not 
allow determining urban functional classes – agriculture area 
spectral behavior can be similar to vegetated areas for some 
plants, etc. The areas with important changes (extreme 
positive and negative pixel values) were verified using the 
aerial photograph taking into account also their shape and 
texture. The oldest map showing the 1970 year was also in  
certain 
cases 
visually 
controlled 
using 
aerial 
orthophotomosaic created from aerial orthophotographs 
collected in 50-ies in the last century.  
The principle of mapping based on the latest land use 
map as the first processed level and further steps heading 
back to the previous levels using always copy of the 
“younger” processed period as a base map for the “older” = 
previous time level proved to be the most effective. The 
current city plans´ and present land use state differences 
were not so numerous. There was another advantage of this 
approach; it allows ensuring the correct topology of each 
land use development map set, detected classes and their 
evolution. 
All functional classes were controlled by the statistical 
table data available at the Czech Office for Surveying, 
Mapping and Cadastre for city administrative areas. The 
functional classes in individual years were used for further 
evaluation between the road transport density, town 
development and investments into road network in the form 
of new by-pass, highways, etc. The indicators showing the 
relation were the following: development of functional class 
areas, development of number of inhabitants, development of 
road transport density, and building of new decongesting 
roads. 
IV. 
ROAD TRAFFIC DATA 
A large data base of the road network development has 
been created by the Road and Motorway Directorate. The 
data base comprises - among others - measurements of the 
road traffic intensity in many points of roads of various 
classes since 60-ies of the 20th century (1968, 1973, 1980, 
1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010). The road traffic intensity 
is a number of vehicles per 24 hours, which passed through a 
determined point on a road in both directions. It is an average 
of several 24 hours´ data collection. 
The measurements are available in map forms where each 
location is marked together with total amount of passed 
vehicles (including motorcycles), and tables where the 
amount is enumerated in a more detailed way distinguishing 
heavy-duty vehicles, cars and motorcycles.  
V. 
SOCIO-ECONOMIC DATA 
A deep analysis of another large data volume which has 
been collected since the second half of the 20th century will 
be performed in the proposed project. The data comprise 10-
year research of socio-economic data of environmental 
changes performed at the University of Economics in 
Prague, e.g. Each city is described by several hundreds of 
statistical data. The data were collected by many students of 
the university within their theses. The processing of the data 
is not presented in this paper and is a matter of the further 
research. 
VI. 
RESULTS 
First twenty cities processed in the first year and a half of 
the project have brought very interesting results.  
Kladno is one of processed towns situated 30 km north 
west from Prague. The town consists both of a core, and 
associated parts. The city was an industrial city in the 
communist period of the republic. The industrial production 
has been extremely declining since 1990 and most 
inhabitants are employed in Prague at present. Fig. 2 shows 
spatial changes of four functional classes between 1969 and 
2009 mapped by the above mentioned method. The dashed 
line (Fig. 2a) determines the core area as an administrative 
city boundary at the end of 70-ies in the 20th century. The 
solid line delineates the administrative city boundary since 
80-ies of the previous century which has not changed. The 
red color patches are residential areas in 1969. The green 
patches are residential areas built between 1969 and 2008 
[3].

Development of production areas is shown in Fig. 2b,

Town development is further presented on two graphs – 
Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. Fig. 3 shows administrative, core and 
associated areas with their built-up and non-built-up area. 
Fig. 4 represents built-up core area. Looking at the statistical 
evaluation presented in Fig. 4, we can see that it was the 
area of production whose growth was the steepest in the 
core part. Comparing residential parts development, we can 
find that it covers larger areas with a steeper increase of size 
than those of traffic ones within the core region during last 
20 years. However, there is a new highway passing the town 
in 5 km distance enabling the town to be used in prevailing 
part as a terminal location for the road traffic and not as a 
passing through town location in direction between Prague 
and north-west. The town has not yield larger areas for 
recreation, leisure time, sport, etc., during last 40 years (Fig. 
4). 
The administration area has not changed since 1982. The 
core area changed - unlike most towns - between 1982 and 
1989. The residential area and area of production cover a 
similar part of the built-up area, however, the growth of the 
production area is steeper. Non built-up areas are in a 
prevailing part the forested ones. The associated areas are in 
most cases formed by an agricultural and forest land, 
however, their  sizes decline after the 1989 political change. 
The spatial changes are described in the coincidence table

(Table I.). Each row shows the size of an individual class 
and its transformation between 1950 and 2008. Each column 
comprises original areas forming the present size of an 
individual class. Areas without changes are highlighted in 
diagonal cells of the table.Comparing of the last row  (Sum 
2008) and last column  (Sum 1950) allows to find encrease 
and decrease of class areas.  
 
The road traffic intensity was checked both on local and 
higher level class roads. Both road types express a growth, 
however, mutually uncomparable. The slope of the growth 
is lower after 1995 when a new pass-by highway was built 
(Fig. 5a). This phenomenon is presented as an impact of the 
highway construction out of the city on traffic intensity of 
the individual functional land use classes in Fig. 5b.

OF RESIDENTIAL AREAS HAS TRANSFORMED TO THE  TRAFFIC, OTHER, PUBLIC, FACILITY, PRODUCTION, GREEN, AND AGRICULTURE AREAS (SEE THE 
RESIDENTIAL ROW). ON THE CONTRARY, THE PRESENT STATE OF THE RESIDENTIAL AREA IS NEWLY (AFTER 1950) FORMED BY TRAFFIC, OTHER, PUBLIC, 
GREEN, AGRICULTURE AREAS AND ENLARGED ON 130 % OF THE ORIGINAL SIZE (363 HA) (EXAMPLE OF THE CITY OF MĚLNÍK)

Investments 
into 
highway 
and 
by-pass 
road 
constructions can be easily recognized from two graphs in 
Fig, 6. Ten towns with the highest number of vehicles per 
24 hours entering and leavig each town were selected and 
compared to  number of their inhabitants. 
The important influence of by-pass roads can be found 
on Fig. 6. The city of Mělník has a very low number and 
growth of inhabitants in last 40 years if compared to 
Ostrava, as an example; however, numbers of measured 
vehicles leaving and coming to both cities are similar. 
Mělník does not have any by-pass road and is situated on 
the direction among Prague and other important Czech 
cities. Analyzing Kolín and Hradec Králové and/or Plzeň, 
their traffic intensity and number of inhabitants show 
analogue situations [3].

The graphs on Figs. 7, 8 and 9 and Table II show that 
the best correlation between road traffic intensity and land 
use class occurs at traffic areas. These are areas of housing 
that have higher correlation coefficient on traffic intensity 
than areas  of production. The best correlation for all land 
use areas has been found for 2005.

VII. CONCLUSIONS 
The project methodology is based on a multi-
correlational processing using statistical (social, economical, 
geographical and natural) data of cities and spatial land use 
development and changes. There are more than six hundred 
economical, social and other statistical indicators whose 
mutual relation are prepared to be analyzed. The spatial land 
use change developments are visualized by the coincidence 
table (Table I.) and were used as the first group of 
indicators. Their correlation coefficients are in Table II. 
Relations between town development and road traffic 
density showed interesting dependences. The traffic 
intensity changes cannot be generalized for a town as a unit. 
There are serious temporal changes within each town. These 
changes are caused by newly built commercial areas where 
this growth is incomparable to any other locations in the 
city, by new roads passing out of cities, e.g. The road traffic 
is also an important indicator of the economic inhabitant 
level – the traffic increase of personal and heavy-duty 
vehicles intensity on one side and decrease of motorcycle 
intensity and number of inhabitants on the other side since 
70-ies is a proof of the higher economical power of city 
inhabitants which was found at all fifty analyzed cities. The 
fact is also documented on Fig. 10 by increasing sum of 
passing vehicles and decreasing number of inhabitants. The 
higher economical power proves also Fig. 11 accompanying 
Fig.10 and showing the growth of residential areas for the 
decline of inhabitants.  
Results of any urban planning are always long lasting 
phenomena influencing the society. The spatial land use 
changes in 50 various cities will yield a rich source of data 
for the evaluation. The road traffic intensity is information 
on the air pollution; data on life expectancy are an issue 
concerning a social situation and health care, etc. The 
project results should offer a set of usable tools = indicators 
for urban planners and their further urban planning to 
achieve sustainable development of cities in the Czech 
Republic.  
The paper presents a starting part of analysis performed 
for functional classes and road traffic intensity. Spatial 
changes and their relation to the traffic evolution have 
already brought a great deal of information which will be 
processed in a form of one of indicators.  
The first part of the research was presented during the 
IARIA GEOProcessing 2011 [3]. 
The future research is focused on determining a list and 
sequence of indicators for the sustainable development of 
cities. The available data will be processed for selection of 
substantial indicators and their influence.  There are still 
spatial ones, which have not been utilized as – distance to 
frontiers, distance to larger cities, etc. except for mainly 
socio-economical indicators that will be analyzed.
