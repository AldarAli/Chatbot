Abstract—In this work, we report on the use of fiber Bragg
gratings (FBGs) sensor for real-time in-situ temperature
monitoring
during
Radio
Frequency
Thermal
Ablation
(RFTA) tumor treatment. In order to create a thermal multi-
point measurement of the area to be treated, a proper sensing
configuration
was
developed
by
instrumenting
the
RF
commercial probe with more than 30 FBG sensors. The
experiments were conducted on ex-vivo animal liver and
kidney tissues and results confirm that the proposed setup is
able to conduct a multi-point measurement and to distinguish
between different and consecutive RF discharges with a
temperature resolution of 0.1 °C and a minimum spatial
resolution of 1 mm.

INTRODUCTION
RFTA is a local treatment of small tumors that, by using
RF current released by electrodes connected to a RF
generator, locally induces a rapid temperature increase in
the tissue affected by the tumor with resulting immediate
necrosis of diseased tissues [1]. Real-time temperature
monitoring during the treatment is essential in enabling
surgeons to adapt RFTA parameters to the tumor size during
surgery and consequently preserve as much healthy tissue as
possible. Due to their small size, non-toxicity, chemical
inertness, biocompatibility, flexibility and low cost, Fiber
Bragg Gratings seems to be a good solution to monitor the
temperature during the RF treatments [2].
In Section II, a novel setup to temperature monitoring
during RFTA treatment is proposed and the results of a RF
discharge on ex vivo animal liver are shown, while in
Section III the conclusion is reported.

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND RESULTS
The experimental setup is illustrated in Figure 1. In
particular, in the blue box, the RFTA instrumentation is
reported: the RF probe is powered by a 500 kHz generator
(RITA 1500X®) producing up to 250 W of power. The
laparoscopic bipolar RF device Habib 4x® was used,
consisting of two pair of opposing electrodes with active
ends of 6 cm in length. In the red box, it is also reported the
optical interrogation of the FBGs’ sensor used to measure
the reflected signal. This device consists of a commercial
FBG interrogator in the range of 1500-1600 nm with a
resolution of 1 pm and maximum sampling frequency of 1
Sample/s. Several commercial FBGs 1 mm long have been
used. In order to correctly measure the temperature during
the RF discharges, the FBGs were inserted in carbon fiber
needles and properly fixed to the RF probe, as shown in
Figure 2. Several measurements of the spatial temperature
profile
during
multi-step
RFTA
discharges
and
the
monitoring of the heat propagation on animal liver and
kidney organs have been carried out confirming that the
proposed
setup
is
able
to
conduct
a
multi-point
measurement and to distinguish between different and
consecutive RF discharges with a temperature resolution of
0.1 °C and a minimum spatial resolution of 1 mm. For
example, in Figure 3, the temperature is reported by a color
map versus spatial sensor position along the axis parallel
and perpendicular to the electrodes respectively (vertical
axis in the graph) and time (horizontal axis).

CONCLUSION
Thanks to the FBG’s fast response time and small
size, we were able to monitor temperature with a
resolution of 0.1 °C during RF discharges. This mapping
of the tissue temperature allowed the monitoring of the
thermal dose delivered to the patient in real time and, at
the same time, to avoid potentially adverse effects to the
tissue adjacent to the target region.
