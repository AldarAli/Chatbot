Abstract—Reusing batteries of electric vehicles in second life is
one pillar of the European Union’s Green Deal and its derivatives
in order to foster the reduction of greenhouse gases. Product life
cycle data plays an important role in improving and simplifying
the process of finding the most suitable second life application
for a used battery. Such data collected throughout the product’s
life cycle will be summarized in a digital product pass mandatory
for future batteries. Having trustworthy data is a key element
of the battery pass in order to provide authentic batteries.
This paper presents a concept to securely bind the pass to the
battery itself by using physical unclonable functions for creating
unique cryptographic keys per battery. Inhomogeneities and cell-
to-cell variations in a battery pack enable the use of batteries
as physical unclonable functions. The approach combines the
cryptographic keys derived from the battery with certificates and
makes use of Certificate Transparency promoting trust in the
issued certificates. Initial security analysis shows that attacks on
product life cycle data and certificates as well as the introduction
of manipulated and counterfeit batteries can be detected.

I. INTRODUCTION
This paper extends [1]. The European Union’s (EU) Green
Deal aims to reduce greenhouse gases towards net-zero emis-
sions by 2050 [2]. One of the measures is to lower the use of
fossil energy in the transportation sector. Electrically driven
vehicles foster this goal and are expected to achieve high
sales numbers in the upcoming years: The Faraday Institute
forecasts a worldwide demand of more than 5 900 GWh in
the year 2040 (2020: 110 GWh) [3]. The rise of Electrical
Vehicles (EV) is accompanied by an increasing need for high-
voltage batteries. However, batteries degrade during usage and
charging. They can only be used in an EV until their capacity
degraded to 80% [4, 5]. This will result in a large number
of dismounted and unusable EV batteries having a negative
economical, ecological, and social impact [6]–[8]. However,
these batteries may be still fine for other use cases. To support
the recycling and reusing of products and materials the EU
introduced the Circular Economy Action Plan containing the
reuse of batteries as one pillar [9]. Its goal is to set up
applications for a battery’s second life either as a complete
product in a different environment or dismantled in new
products.
The new mass market for EV batteries will also encourage
the production of counterfeit batteries. Non-certified or non-
qualified batteries can introduce safety risks due to deviations
from the specifications of genuine products and especially
due to cost-savings in risk-reducing controls and management
systems [10]. Reduced capacity and lifetime, overheating,
and self-ignition, as well as social aspects like underpaid
workers and bad working conditions during manufacturing, are
examples of likely effects when using counterfeit EV batteries.
Circular economy and the fight against counterfeiting em-
phasize a need for authentic batteries that we define as the
following: trust in the battery’s quality, evidence in the correct
implementation of the specification, and traceability of the
product life cycle enhance the opportunities for second life
applications and lower the risk of introducing low quality
and dangerous products into the market. Both, the readiness
for circular economy and the circulation of only high-quality
batteries, shall be regulated within the new EU-regulation
about the treatment of (old) batteries [11] introducing the
Battery Passport as an electronic record for batteries of EVs,
among others.
This paper presents an approach to inherently bind the digital
pass to the physical battery by using certificates based on
Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF) managed within the
method of Certificate Transparency. The following paragraphs
introduce the basic techniques of the presented approach.
Battery Passport: As of today the final adoption of the new
regulation by the European Council and the European Parlia-
ment is still open [12]. However, no significant modifications
of the regulation are expected until then. Therefore, the fol-
lowing requirements can be summarized: The Battery Passport
shall be unique for each individual battery and shall consist

45

of data relevant to the battery’s model, and static and dynamic
data specific to a single battery. The latter shall accommodate
performance and durability parameters, the status of the bat-
tery, the number of charging and discharging cycles, negative
events like accidents, and operating environmental conditions
including the temperature and State of Charge (SoC).
The Battery Passport shall be available through an online
database. In case of a second life application, the existing data
shall be transferred into a new passport and the legacy passport
shall be deleted. Test reports shall be available to notified
bodies, market surveillance authorities, and the European
Commission to enable examination of compliance with the
battery-related requirements.
The regulation provides for a physical code as an identifier of
a battery. However, we want to solve the identification of a
battery by means of PUFs.
Physical Unclonable Function: A PUF uses physical devia-
tions that occur during production to create a unique and un-
clonable identifier [13]. It is described as a challenge-response-
pair (CRP) where a device to be authenticated needs to prove
the ownership of the PUF-identifier. According to McGrath
et al. [14] a PUF needs to fulfill the following properties:
robust, unique, easy to evaluate, challenging to replicate, and
impossible to predict. In general, a distinction is made between
weak and strong PUFs. Weak PUFs only comprise one or
few CRP, which brings the advantage of storing cryptographic
keys without requiring non-volatile memory. An example of
a weak PUF is the SRAM-PUF: An SRAM memory cell has
two stable states that represent 0 and 1. However, before the
first write operation has been executed, the cells tend either to
0 or to 1. This undefined state is used to derive a cryptographic
key [15].
On the other hand, strong PUFs are defined as having so
many CRP that an attacker cannot solve or recover the PUF
in a finite time. One example of these types of PUFs is the
optical PUF: It consists of a movable laser beam, a scattering
medium, and a sprinkle detector (Figure 1). The orientation of
the laser beam is the challenge, whereas the sprinkles comprise
the response. It is hardly possible to create equal scattering
media and therefore, this principle is suitable as a source of
randomness [15].

source and the measurement process are subject to noise and
variabilities, the PUF’s response differs slightly, even if the
same challenge is used. Therefore, an additional step needs
to be done in order to correct these errors [15, 17]. To
enhance general security, the random number created from the
PUF is hashed using a cryptographic hash function [18]. The
process of deriving cryptographic keys from a PUF is shown
in Figure 2 in which a fuzzy extractor is used for stabilization
and uniformity of the plain PUF response.
The two main areas of application of physical unclonable
functions are a secret key generation (weak PUFs) and authen-
tication at low cost (strong PUFs) [13]–[15]. The advantages
of using PUFs instead of dedicated random number generators
are the following: they are simple as they are using existing
hardware structures and do not rely on pseudo-random number
generators. The secret is only available in a powered mode,
which makes it more difficult for attackers to read out the keys,
the chance for invasive attacks is reduced, and they are more
cost-efficient as they do not need expensive security hardware
modules [15].
As introduced later in Section III, the Battery Passport consists
of certificates. To enable trust and transparency in the issued
certificates, the methods of Certificate Transparency are used.
Certificate Transparency: Certificate Transparency (CT) was
originally developed by Google and is about the transpar-
ent and trust-worthy issuing of certificates used in the Web
PKI [19]. It is summarized in the experimental RFC 6962
[20] and deals with the difficulties of trusting Certificate
Authorities (CA) in general: private keys associated with a
certificate may be stolen or created in a wrongful way such that
encryption itself would not be damaged but an attacker might
be able to decrypt the communication without knowledge of
the necessary key. A common way to check the trustworthiness
of CAs is to examine audits. However, audits often check for
formal aspects only than for the correct implementation of
technical processes.
The idea of CT is about storing certificates in publicly
available append-only logs that can be validated by everyone.
Figure 3 shows the steps needed to implement CT: The owner
of the domain requests a certificate by the CA, which creates
a pre-certificate and sends it to the log. The latter is managed
as a Merkle Tree [21]. A Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT)
ensuring that the certificate is added to the log is sent to the
CA. The certificate is extended with the SCT and transferred

to the domain owner. From this time on, the domain owner
can use it as a normal certificate, e.g., for hosting websites. At
the end user’s site, the certificate is checked for the existence
of SCTs, e.g., during TLS handshake. Some internet browsers
require that the certificate is signed with at least two SCTs. The
certificate logs are checked periodically by external monitors.
The domain owner is informed if there are new and especially
odd activities with certificates of its domain.
Furthermore, there are other methods for detecting counterfeit
products, e.g., by statistical measures [22], physical inspection,
or electrical examination [23]. However, the presented concept
is triggered by the EU regulation concerning the battery
pass and therefore, the concept of logging and auditing is
reasonable.
The remaining paper is structured as followed: Section II
describes related work as a basis for a concept for authentic
batteries, which is introduced in Section III. A brief security
and performance evaluation of the presented approach is given
in Section IV. Current and future activities are summarized in
Section V.
The conference paper’s extensions comprise additional infor-
mation on the regulation concerning the Battery Passport, a
more detailed explanation of PUFs and their characteristics,
an overview of research works related to inhomogeneities and
cell-to-cell variations in lithium-ion batteries, initiatives on
the implementation of the Battery Passport, and an elaborated
explanation of the presented approach to combine the physical
battery with the Battery Passport.
II. RELATED WORK
To the best of our knowledge, the idea of a digital product pass
for single products is unique to batteries. Other applications do
have static product records or they are only implemented for
a group of products and not for single devices. Additionally,
the battery pass will be the first pass that is required by law in
the EU. The following related research results introduce only
comparable parts of the presented concept.
A. Product Passes
The general concept of product passes is not novel. Several
initiatives for passports in other domains already exist. Exem-
plary three implementations are introduced.
The International Material Data System (IMDS) is a collection
of life cycle data in the automotive industry. Original equip-
ment manufacturer (OEM) and supplier store information on
component and material data of vehicles in the IMDS to reduce
the workload and required time of life cycle assessment. The
system has been introduced in the year 2000 and is commonly
used by more than 50 OEMs and 120 000 suppliers [24].
Reusing building materials is important for a circular economy
in the civil industry. The Building Information Management
(BIM) based Material Passport shall enable Urban Mining
by comprising data on materials across the full life cycle,
e.g., of volume and geometry of multilayered components
(concrete, insulation, plaster) or assessment of demolition
acquisition [25].
The Danish ship manufacturer and logistic company Maersk
created a Cradle-to-Cradle passport for enhanced recycling
opportunities at the end-of-life of a container vessel. The
document contains information on built materials as well as
disassembly and recycling activities. This decreases the need
for new materials fostering sustainability and reducing overall
costs [26].
These initiatives show that product passes can enhance and
simplify the assessment of the life cycle and of potentials for
reuse and recycling. However, these product passports do not
take into consideration dynamic activities and modifications
of the product during life.
B. PUFs based on batteries
In [27], Vittilapuram Subramanian and Madhukar Lele de-
scribe the calculation of PUF identifiers out of a set of different
parameters: pressure drop between two sides of the battery, the
batteries natural frequency, the temperature pattern, the open
circuit voltage (OCV), or the air leak rate. The created PUF
identifier is saved as a physical tag on top of the battery or
in the battery management system’s memory. However, the
identifier can only be calculated in a dismounted state. This
method shows the possibility of a battery PUF creation in
general.
Zografopoulos and Konstantinou [28] presented a method
to authenticate an outstation in a distributed energy storage
network. This work takes advantage of the fact that the cells’
voltages differ at the same SoC. Both, the outstation and the

47

master station, sanitize a challenge-reply-table with continu-
ously updated measurements presenting a model of every cell.
The authentication challenge is formed out of a selection of
cells. The SoC and the voltages are measured and sent back to
the master station. If the actual measurements match with the
values in the challenge-reply-table the outstation is accepted
as authentic.
Both works demonstrate that it is feasible to use PUFs on
batteries. However, existing works use PUFs as a mechanism
to create an identity. We want to extend this to use PUFs to
derive keys.
C. Inhomogeneities and cell-to-cell variations in lithium-ion
batteries
Durbarry et al. [29] state that variations from cell to cell are
the origin of a battery’s uniqueness. Differences are noticeable
in capacity, current, impedance, open circuit voltage, and so
in the SoC [30, 31]. The origins of these inhomogeneities can
be split into intrinsic and extrinsic influences.
Intrinsic inhomogeneities: As many parts of the used ma-
terials are natural products they are subject to variations.
For example, the material used for the electrodes differs in
composition, purity, defects, and morphology. An identical
manufacturing process is also hardly achievable due to its
complexity. Differences may also arise with respect to the
production volume [32]. Even if the cells are produced iden-
tically, variations between them may also result from uneven
cell connections [30]–[32].
Extrinsic inhomogeneities: The environment of the battery
pack can also have an influence on differences between cells
as well as the pack design: Unmatched cells and asymmetric
design can result in inhomogeneous cell utilization. The same
applies to an ineffective cooling strategy and external heat
sources resulting in local temperature peaks. Finally, cells in
serial or parallel architecture lead to differences [29]–[32].
The overall result of inhomogeneous parameters leads to
inhomogeneous aging of different cell components and this
again amplifies the variations of parameters. Aging accelerates
over time [30, 31].
These research works show that significant cell-to-cell varia-
tions in lithium-ion batteries exist and are measurable. They
also demonstrate the effects of aging on these inhomogeneities,
which are mentioned later in Section III-E as one major
challenge of the presented concept.
D. Blockchain with PUFs
A common mechanism to implement digital product passes
is the use of blockchain [33, 34]. Casino et al. described a
blockchain as a ”distributed append-only timestamped data
structure” [35, p. 56] where no central and trusted authority
is involved. Exchanging assets, digital or physical, between
two blockchain participants is achieved and recorded with
transactions. They have to be validated by other participat-
ing nodes using a consensus algorithm in order to prevent
corruption or forgery of branches. Blockchains in the sector
of supply chain management can increase trust, traceability,
transparency, and accountability. They are installed for better
visibility and enhanced optimization of a supply chain [35].
Mohanty et al. [36] introduced PUFChain, which is a method
that combines blockchain with PUFs within the Internet-of-
Everything (IoE) domain where trusted nodes authenticate
IoE-data collected from client nodes. The process is divided
into three phases: During the enrollment, the client’s PUF-
CRP are calculated and stored in a secure database. The
phases of transactions consist of data collection, PUF response
generation, and hashing of both. The data and the hash are
added to the blockchain and need to be authenticated by trusted
nodes. These nodes recalculate the hash by using the client
data and the pre-calculated PUF response retrieved from the
database and validate the block if both hashes match. An
application of PUFChain in the Internet-of-Energy was given
by Asif et al. [37].
An approach to enable trust in the supply chain by tracing
was presented by Cui et al. [38]. Newly manufactured devices
need to be registered in a blockchain with a unique ID, e.g.,
a PUF. Device transfers are recorded in the blockchain. The
contractual ownership alters only after a transfer confirmation,
which is done by calculating the unique device ID of the
received device and comparing it with the ID mentioned in
the transaction payload. End users can check the device’s
authenticity by matching the computed ID with the blockchain
content.
Whereas blockchain is a popular method for storing tamper-
proofed data, we decided to use a different approach. In our
opinion, the system consists of trusted partners: A generally
trusted collaboration across the supply chain of EV batteries
has to exist already, meaning that contracts describing a trade
relationship are in place. One major motivation for using
blockchain methodology is to create a network between parties
that do not trust and know each other. Both are not applica-
ble to the application presented in this concept. Therefore,
decentralized distribution of data is not necessary and so, a
central database fits the requirements and can be hosted, e.g.,
by the EU enforcing the battery regulations. In a blockchain,
consensus mechanisms shall ensure the correctness of new
transactions. In this specific application, these mechanisms are
useful only to a limited extent as they will only perform a
proof of formal attributes of a transaction, i.e. a new record
added to the Battery Pass. A blockchain party validating a new
block cannot check the validity and legitimacy of, e.g., a new
temperature maximum or a degradation of the capacity. This
is only possible with direct access to the battery system itself.
As a summary, using a blockchain will add extra effort
without having additional advantages. The key functionality
of generating trusted and tamper-proofed data records can also
be achieved by using the methods of Certificate Transparency.
E. Initiatives working on Battery Passport
The new EU regulation concerning the Battery Passport is
expected to be mandatory within the next years. Therefore,

48
International Journal on Advances in Security, vol 16 no 1 & 2, year 2023, http://www.iariajournals.org/security/
2023, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
several initiatives for the battery pass’s implementation exist.
Due to the early phase of these projects, only introductory
content has been published and so, an assessment of the
architectural concepts is hardly possible. However, a brief
overview of existing projects is given.
The Global Battery Alliance (GBA) is a collaboration platform
consisting of more than 120 partners and organizations and
puts the focus on a sustainable supply chain in the battery
industry. It was founded at the World Economic Forum (WEF)
in 2017. The GBA published proof-of-concept pilots for a
Battery Passport at the Annual Meeting of the WEF 2023 [39].
The pilots contain information on a specific battery: EV
manufacturer, battery producer, battery cell producer, cell type,
chemistry, capacity, and other parameters are shown as well as
information on materials including the origin of raw materials.
The focus of the pilots is on ESG (environmental, social, and
corporate governance) data. Whereas the underlying architec-
ture and processes are not known so far, the proof-of-concept
pilots give an insight into a potentially implemented Battery
Passport.
A project closely related to the GBA is called Battery Pass,
which is a consortium formed by companies from the automo-
tive, battery recycling, and data processing industries [40]. It is
funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs
and Climate Action and shall make use of the automotive
information exchange system Catena-X. A report [41] guiding
through the new EU regulation’s content relevant to the battery
passport has been published. It introduces the consortium’s
interpretation of the requirements and outlines an overview of
the possible data stored in the Battery Passport. This project
aims to give guidelines for interpreting and implementing the
EU regulation and therefore, it should be kept in view. A
demonstrator is expected to be published in 2024.
III. CONCEPT FOR AUTHENTIC BATTERIES
A. Introduction
The general aim of our method is to have one single source
of truth containing information about the battery’s life cycle
including the manufacturing process, product acceptance tests
(PAT), measures of quality control, and usage history. Tracing
materials and processes fosters consumers’ trust in the battery
and enables an easier and more precise assessment of the
batteries’ status for recycling or reusing.
The data of the life cycle record is stored in a database that can
be restricted in order to control the read and write access of
the supply chain parties involved. Access control also protects
the parties’ intellectual property (IP). It is mandatory to have
a secure binding between the life cycle record and the battery
itself ensuring the correspondence between both. The secure
binding is established by the use of certificates in combination
with PUFs that provide unique identifiers for each battery.
B. Data for battery pass’s records
Data is added to the battery pass during manufacturing,
product testing, and quality control. This data brings added

value to the end user, as the user receives information on
a remarkable downgrade of, e.g., the state of health (SoH)
or capacity and on minimum and maximum temperatures,
voltages, and currents. The latter parameters are important to
assess the battery’s health for a second life application. The
data acquisition building the life cycle record is split into three
phases (see Figure 4).
Assembly and initial product testing takes place during the
production stage at the battery OEM. Information about the
manufacturer, working conditions, date of production, and
results of acceptance tests are stored in the battery pass. It
may be split into battery cell OEM and battery pack OEM
having similar data. Afterwards, the battery is transferred
to the vehicle’s OEM to be built into the intended vehicle.
Again, information about the vehicle manufacturer, working
conditions, and the vehicle including the vehicle identifica-
tion number (VIN) are stored in the record. The storage of
information concerning the working conditions shall enable a
socially acceptable supply chain, which goes along the new
EU regulation.
We are assuming the car to be delivered to the consumer
directly after production. At this stage, the battery will be
used in its intended environment of the first life. Significant
changes in the battery’s quality will be logged in the life cycle
record. These changes include temperature, voltage and current
maxima and minima, and SoH and capacity downgrade. The
collection of data at this stage is of high relevance in order
to execute a sophisticated life cycle assessment of the battery
before entering a second life.
The preparation of the second life is divided into two steps:
First, the battery is dismounted from the vehicle and the date
and the implementing company are stored in the life cycle
record. This marks the end of the first life. The activity
of entering the second life contains events like firmware
or configuration updates required for a new environment or
applications, quality tests, and maintenance activities. Again,
the battery will be transferred to a consumer. We assume an

environment in which the life cycle record can be sanitized.
Therefore, the stage of the second life equals the consumer
stage. Depending on the new area of application other or
additional data than before may be stored in the battery pass.
The format of the battery pass’s data is not defined here.
However, the JSON data format may be reasonable as it is
widely used and easy to read and process.
C. Security Requirements
The security demands for the presented concept are mainly
derived from the high-level requirements of the Battery Pass as
presented in Section I. The following security-related aspects
shall be considered:
• The battery pass and its records shall be bound to the
physical battery. This guarantees that the records are only
valid for one specific battery.
• It shall be possible to detect a manipulated battery pass.
Shaping of data towards, e.g., less charging cycles or better
historic environmental conditions, may increase the resale
value of an EV and therefore, these malicious activities must
be prevented.
• The circulation of counterfeit batteries having a stolen or
no battery pass shall be recognized as well.
• Updates of the records shall only be possible from the
battery itself or from a system that has access to the battery.
This ensures the validity of the data without the possibility
of data being added by a third party not involved in the
process.
• Trust and transparency shall be treated to foster the battery
pass’s acceptance by the user and in general a successful
assessment of second life applications.
• It shall be possible to restrict access to the data records of
the Battery Pass to a limited number of users or user groups
in general. This ensures the enforcement of the GDPR
(general data protection regulation) and the protection of
intellectual properties.
D. Security Architecture
The technical implementation of our method is based on
signed battery data whereas the keys are derived from the
battery’s PUF. Figure 5 shows the overall process of adding
data and verifying the battery’s identity. We are assuming the
process of deriving a key from the PUF has already been
carried out. As elaborated in the section on related work
(Section II), this assumption is reasonable.
The general implementation is split into four phases: In the
enrollment phase, the keys and an initial certificate are created.
It is followed by the creation and storage process of a new data
record. In this phase, the battery is the only active part, apart
from storing the certificate in the log. In the third phase, the
battery is not involved anymore, as the verification of a record
can be carried out by using only the entries of the database
and the certificate stored in the log. To verify the identity of
the battery, the battery must prove possession of the private

key to a user, which is comprised in the fourth phase. The four
phases introduced are outlined in the next paragraphs. Except
for the first phase, the stages do not have to be processed one
after another. The activities can be executed independently.
The first phase is to enroll a private and public key and an
initial certificate. As mentioned earlier we assume that a key
has been derived from the battery’s PUF. This key is the
private key and will never leave the battery. A public key
is calculated from the private key and added to an initial
certificate. At this stage, the certificate may contain only
metadata. However, battery-related data will be added in the
next step that immediately follows the enrollment phase in
order to fill the Battery Pass with relevant data.
The most functional part of the method is adding and updating
the data of the battery. The relevant data is described in
Section III-B. If new data is generated it will be sent to a
central database containing historic and current data of this
specific battery (Figure 5b). In the battery or more precisely
in the battery management system the data is signed with the
private key derived from the battery’s PUF. Only the signature
is added to a battery-specific certificate also containing the

public key. If a certificate already exists for the battery a
reissuing is needed and the old one has to be revoked. The
certificate itself is attached to an append-only log. We are
relying on Certificate Transparency, which is a commonly used
method developed by Google to store and handle identity
certificates in a trusted and verifiable way, which has been
introduced in Section I. Whereas the log itself does not fulfill
any functional requirement, it provides additional trust and
transparency into the certificate as it can be validated and
monitored by external and public parties.
One could argue to add the battery data to the certificate
introducing the advantage of having one single document
containing all relevant information about the battery. How-
ever, having this, the battery’s data is publicly available, and
therefore, IP may be revealed as well as the opportunity for
malicious analysis of production statistics and performance
of a battery OEM. A dedicated database can be restricted
to a reduced number of users. This is also in line with the
EU regulation concerning the definition of the Battery Pass,
presented in Section I. Test reports certifying the quality of the
battery shall only be accessible to a certain group of users.
In order to check the validity of the data in accordance with the
corresponding certificate, access to the data and the certificate
is needed. Using the public key stored in the certificate the
signatures can be verified (Figure 5c). In this context, another
opportunity to avoid disclosure of IP may be possible by
letting the signatures be checked by the database itself and
letting it deliver a summary of data not revealing IP.
In the last phase, it is checked that the certificate belongs to
the battery as described in Figure 5d. Therefore, a challenge-
response mechanism is used where the user sends a challenge
consisting of a random number to the battery. The challenge is
signed using the battery’s private key and the response is sent
back to the user. If the received signature can be verified using
the corresponding public key it is proven that the certificate
belongs to the battery as the private key is directly derived
from the battery’s PUF.
To reduce the risk of stolen or reproduced keys by an attacker
the derived key may be stored in a Hardware Security Module
(HSM), e.g., placed on the Battery Management System
(BMS). However, the cost-efficiency of HSMs in the context
of industrial applications with large quantities having high
pressure on costs has to be evaluated [42].
E. Challenges
The main challenge of the presented method is the derivation
of keys from the battery’s PUF. It is required that the keys do
not change over time. However, due to the aging of cells and
the battery pack the PUF and so, the keys may change. The
validation steps mentioned above cannot be executed anymore
resulting in a failure of the complete method. The same applies
to genuine repairs or maintenance activities of the battery.
Single cells will not be exchanged probably, but battery packs.
This would result in a new PUF and so in invalid existing
private and public keys.
To overcome both, two approaches might be appropriate: First,
using a model forecasting the cell and battery aging in order to
create static cryptographic keys. And second, if an imminent
change is foreseeable having a mechanism to modify the
existing keys, e.g., with pre-calculated challenges and a hash
chain for tracking expired keys.
Instead of using the battery’s cells to create unique identifier,
one could also use the surrounding electrical components as
an origin for physical unclonable functions. The entropy might
be enough to create cryptographic keys as there are many
components built into one battery pack. These components
do not age in the same way as cells do.
The creation of the PUF shall only be possible using the
measured data available to the BMS installed in the vehicle.
Measurements that are only obtainable under laboratory con-
ditions cannot be used for these calculations. However, in-situ
measurements reduce the opportunities to retrieve cell-to-cell
variations as stated by Prosser et al. [43]. Therefore, it has
to be analyzed if it is possible to measure the mentioned
inhomogeneities sufficiently within the BMS and if these
parameters offer enough entropy to be applied to cryptographic
applications.
Challenges also arise in the general use of the battery pass.
Standardization across companies is mandatory to enable
comparability of batteries. This also applies to the update pro-
cedure of the battery pass. Questions concerning the frequency
and the resolution of record updates have to be answered.
IV. EVALUATION
A brief analysis of the security and efficiency aspects of the
presented approach is given in the following section. It is
evaluated if the concept meets the requirements outlined in
Section III-C. The approach is also examined with regard to
its efficiency.
A. Security Analysis
The assumed model of the adversary is presented, followed
by an evaluation of the individual requirements.
Adversary Model: We assume that the attacker has read and
write access to the database. As the certificates are stored
publicly following the methods of Certificate Transparency the
adversary can also read certificates. However, the attacker can-
not read or re-create the battery’s private key as we assume that
the physical access to the battery and its related components
is restricted or destroys the physical characteristics resulting
in a modified PUF.
Binding battery pass and battery: The data of the battery
stored in the database is signed using a private key that is
derived from the components of the physical battery. The
signature itself is saved in a certificate, which is the actual
battery pass. Therefore, the physical battery and the battery
pass are distinctly linked.

Detection of manipulated battery pass: Manipulation of a
battery pass can be possible in two ways: First, manipulation of
data in the database and second, manipulation of the certificate.
Data manipulation will be recognized if the signature is
verified. Signature verification should be a mandatory step
when working with these batteries, e.g., for an assessment of
the second life applications. A manipulation of the certificate
can be detected by the monitoring instances within Certificate
Transparency. However, if an attacker can calculate a signature
using a key he controls and if he can add the signature and
the corresponding public key to the certificate, a manipulated
battery pass cannot be detected by only verifying the signature.
To overcome this effect, it must be checked if the physical
battery, i.e. the private key, belongs to the public key stored
in the certificate.
However, in general manipulation or deletion of data can result
in financial and ecological damage as it is the basis for further
use of the battery. If the data is deleted, assumptions based on
statistical measures have to be consulted, which may result in
a worse assessment of the state of health.
Circulation of counterfeit batteries: If an attacker duplicates
the certificate in order to sell a counterfeit battery with a
pseudo-valid certificate, the attack may not be recognized until
the link between the certificate and the battery is verified.
Whereas the signature for the data is valid, the challenge-
response as mentioned in Section III-D will fail: The public
key stored in the certificate does not match the private key of
the battery as the public key is a derivative of the private key.
Therefore, the decrypted response will not match the initial
challenge.
Update of battery pass only with access to battery: In theory,
records can be added to the database without having access
to the battery. As we assume that the attacker has access
to the database values can be added or deleted arbitrarily.
Even a signature can be created by an attacker. However, the
signature cannot be validated correctly as the key used for
signing the data does not match the public key used to validate
the signature. The signature will be validated correctly only if
the private key derived from the battery is used. Therefore, a
valid update of the battery pass is only possible with physical
access to the battery. Nevertheless, the validation must be done
actively and continuously in order to prevent the theoretical
opportunity of adding data without access to the battery. The
monitoring feature of Certificate Transparency supports this
requirement.
Generating trust and transparency: Trust and transparency for
user’s acceptance and for trustworthy assessment of second life
applications is created with the use of cryptographic keys on
the one hand and on the other hand with the use of Certificate
Transparency where certificates can be validated by external
parties.
Several attack scenarios have been described. None of them
can be executed on their own as there need to be attacks
on multiple system parts to be successful. However, it also
showed that a continuous verification of the different links
between certificate, data, and battery is mandatory to ensure
the system’s security. Nevertheless, a complete and in-depth
security analysis will be executed in the future to strengthen
the given statements.
B. Efficiency of Data Transfer and Verification
In the current EU project MARBEL (Manufacturing and
assembly of modular and reusable Electric Vehicle battery
for environment-friendly and lightweight mobility [44]) the
efficiency of data transfer with a state-of-the-art BMS has
been analyzed in a proof-of-concept. Tests have been made
with a frequency of data transfer ranging from 5 Hz to
200 Hz sending single MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry
Transport protocol) messages. Authentication and encryption
were established using the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
protocol adding a security-related overhead to every message.
The average message size summed up to 90 bytes, which
corresponded to a measured maximum data rate of 144 kBits/s.
The findings from these tests appear to support the assumption
of an efficient data transfer. However, a continuous stream of
battery data might not be required as the degradation of the
battery’s SoH is a slow process. Data may be also buffered
over a defined time and sent in blocks.
Data will be verified on servers that can be highly optimized.
Therefore, it is expected that the verification can be carried
out efficiently as well.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Circular economy and the fight against counterfeiting empha-
size a need for authentic products. Digital product passes are
one example to increase trust and transparency in a product’s
life cycle. Within the next years, a digital product pass will
be mandatory for all EV batteries entering the EU’s market.
This paper presented an approach to inherently bind the battery
with the pass by using certificates with PUFs. Variations from
cell-to-cell exist and therefore, it seems feasible to derive
cryptographic keys from a battery-based PUF. The certificates
are managed and validated within the environment of Cer-
tificate Transparency. Challenges arise in the inconsistency of
PUFs due to cell aging and in the availability of measurement
controls in the BMS. An initial security analysis showed that
the presented method enables traceability of and trust in the
product life cycle data and detectability of counterfeit products
and passes.
Future work includes an analysis of cell parameters usable for
a PUF directly retrievable within the BMS. An assessment of
the random data in terms of entropy is also to be done as
well as further investigations on the consistency of PUFs in
the context of EV batteries. The results will be used to create
a proof-of-concept followed by a performance and in-depth
formal security analysis in order to evaluate the functionality
and the security measures of the presented method. Other
mechanisms for detecting counterfeit electronic products will
be analyzed and set into comparison to PUFs.
