Abstract—In this paper, we propose a development of a T-
shaped circulator based on a 2D-photonic crystal, which has a
simple and compact structure. This structure makes the non-
reciprocal transmission of electromagnetic waves. Through a
series of adjustments in the crystalline geometry and using the
Nelder-Mead optimization method, we achieve a high level of
isolation and low insertion losses.

INTRODUCTION
Non-reciprocal components, such as isolators and circula-
tors, are used in communications systems to reduce undesirable
reﬂections that cause instability in generators and ampliﬁers,
as well as loss of performance in these systems.
Different types of circulators based on Photonic Crystal
(PhC) technology are known. Among them there are tradi-
tional three-port Y-circulators in PhCs with triangular lattice
in optical region [1], in THz [2] and W-circulator [3], T-
circulator in PhCs with square lattice [4][5]. All of them
are based on resonance of the standing dipole mode of a
Magneto-Optical (MO) resonator with a complex geometry.
The proposed circulator presents a resonant cavity with a very
simple structure.
Besides, when compared with the circulators presented by
Wang et al. [4] and Jing et al. [5], the proposed one has the
splitting factor about ﬁve times lower. Therefore, the scaling
for operation at higher frequencies is much plausible.
The circulator consists of a square lattice of dielectric
cylinders immersed in air. We consider a junction consisting of
a resonator with MO material and three waveguides coupled to
the resonator. This structure can operate in subTHz and THz
frequency range and perform non-reciprocal transmission of
electromagnetic waves.
The proposed device based on photonic crystal technology
can be built with reduced dimensions, favoring an increase in
the component integration density in communications systems.
Due to strong dependence of parameters of photonic crystals
with respect to geometry, adjustments were made in the crystal
structure by using of an optimization technique.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the
optimization method is discussed and the optimal design is
presented. In Section III, the device performance after using
the optimization process is shown. After that, the conclusion
is presented.
II.
OPTIMIZATION PROCESS
The technique of optimization known as brute force is
not appropriate for solution of our problem. The Nelder-Mead
method, which is available in COMSOL [6], has been used for
the geometry optimization. This algorithm [7] demonstrates a
rapid convergence in comparison with other available methods.
Considering excitation in the three ports of the circulator,
we look for its good transmission and isolation for a particular
frequency band. The objective function was deﬁned as S
parameters of the circulator. Thus, optimized values for the
radius and the position of the ferrite and dielectric cylinders
comprising the resonant were obtained.

the center of the axis between the connecting waveguides. It is
noticed that for this geometrical conﬁguration, there is no non-
reciprocal transmission, which leads us to seek change in the
parameters of the cylinders near the resonator. There are also
high losses of the structure for this geometrical arrangement,
as it can be seen in Figure 1b. Then one realizes that must be
applied to optimization for this problem.
From the values obtained using the optimization module,
the ﬁnal optimal design with the changes made in the crystal
structure can be seen in Figure 2. The white cylinders are re-
lated to the periodic structure of the employed photonic crystal
and each of them has radius equal to 0.2a, where a is the lattice
constant. For frequency f = 100GHz, a = 1.065mm.

After the changes made in the central structure, the radius
of the blue cylinder remained equal to 0.30562a, but is
displaced in relation to the axis of the waveguide between
ports 2 and 3 (∆y1) of 0.69086a. The green cylinder has a
reduced radius 0.01249a and was moved vertically to the axis
of the upper cylinders (∆y2) in 0.2563a. The radii of the red
cylinders were increased to 0.07439a.

OBTAINED RESULTS
The frequency splitting of the rotating modes ω+ and ω−
versus k/µ is shown in Figure 3. It is apparent that our
circulator works with low parameter k/µ = 0.17, i. e. can be
projected for THz region.
The resonant cavity is based on a nickel-zinc based ferrite
rod inserted in the center of the device and the dipole modes
are excited in this rod. The used ferrite is produced by Trans-
Tech [8] and its product code is TT2-111. In order to obtain the
magnetic permeability and permittivity of the employed ferrite,
the following expressions were used in our simulations:

to 620 MHz for excitation at port 1, 680 MHz for excitation
at port 2 and 730 MHz for excitation at the port 3.
The propagation of electromagnetic waves is given as
follows: when the excitation is applied at port 1, there is signal
transmission from this port to port 3, with isolation of port 2
due to the special alignment of the dipole mode, as can be seen
in Figure 5. Similarly, when the input signal is applied in the
port 2 (Figure 6), this is transferred to the port 1, with isolation
of port 3 and in the port 3 (Figure 7), this is transferred to the
port 2, with isolation of port 1. This case corresponds to the
propagation in a counterclockwise direction. If the signal of
the external DC magnetic ﬁeld H0 is reversed, the propagation
of signals is clockwise (1 to 2, 2 to 3 and 3 to 1).
In the cases illustrated in Figures 5 and 6, it can be seen
that the stationary dipole mode excited in the resonant cavity is
rotated by an angle of 45◦, which provides isolation of ports 2
and 3, respectively. On the other hand, in the case illustrated in
Figure 7, it is shown that the stationary dipole mode suffers no
rotation, making the input signal applied in port 3 is transferred
to the port 2 with port 1 isolated.
Analysing intensity of the electric ﬁeld in the T-junction,
one can see that, the resonant cavity is formed by a central
ferrite cylinder and two dielectric cylinders with increased
diameters compared to other cylinders that comprising the
photonic crystal.
IV.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have presented a T-junction circulator with
reduced dimensions. Several changes were made in the device
initial design, in order to realize the isolation function. That
is, to protect the signal source from stray reﬂections of not
a ideally matched load. By using parameter optimization, we
have obtained good characteristics of the circulator, namely,
low insertion losses between the input and the output ports,
high input isolation levels and a relatively wide operating
frequency band.
