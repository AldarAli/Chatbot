Abstract— Since wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are suscep-
tible to physical node capture attacks, it is not sufficient to use 
cryptography for secure communications in WSNs. To resolve 
this problem, we propose a node deployment scheme using an 
air vehicle which tolerates up to k compromised nodes, called 
k-resilience. Our scheme models the environmental effect as 
Gaussian distribution and deploys sensor nodes using an air 
vehicle to statistically ensure k-resilience. We also show how 
well our scheme guarantees k-resilience through a simulation 
in MATLAB.

 INTRODUCTION 
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are vulnerable to 
physical node capture attacks since WSNs are usually de-
ployed in the hostile environment and operated unattended 
for a long time. Hence, cryptography-based secure commu-
nications are not enough for WSNs. One of the most widely 
used solutions is to take advantage of redundancy [1]. Sup-
pose that a sensor node A has three neighbors, one of which 
is compromised by an adversary, thus two nodes send correct 
information and a compromised node send false information. 
In this case, the sensor node A can get correct information by 
selecting the median value among the received messages. 
More generally, each node requires 2k+1 neighbors to guar-
antee k-resilience, which tolerates up to k compromised 
nodes. 
The easiest way to guarantee k-resilience is a determinis-
tic deployment which takes too much effort and is almost 
impossible in large-scale WSNs. In contrast, deploying sen-
sor nodes randomly needs too many sensor nodes to guaran-
tee k-resilience [2]. To meet halfway, we propose a k-
resilient node deployment scheme using an air vehicle. We 
first model the environmental effect such as wind using 
Gaussian distribution, and thus the real position of the 
dropped node from the air vehicle is statistically determined. 
With this statistical information, we propose a node deploy-
ment scheme to statistically guarantee k-resilience. Finally, 
we show that our scheme guarantees k-resilience through a 
simulation in MATLAB and compare the required number of 
nodes for k-resilience with the deterministic deployment and 
the random deployment. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
describes the assumptions and proposes our scheme. After 
evaluating our scheme in Section III, Section IV concludes 
this paper. 
II. 
STATE OF THE ART 
The node deployment schemes in WSNs can be classified 
into three categories: 1) Deterministic deployment, 2) Ran-
dom deployment, and 3) Controlled random deployment [2]. 
The deterministic deployment can easily achieve k-resilience 
by manually deploying k nodes within the transmission range 
of each node. However, this needs too much effort and is 
almost impossible in large-scale WSNs. In contrast, the ran-
dom deployment requires too many nodes to guarantee k-
resilience [3]. The controlled random deployment [2] locates 
each node from the air vehicle considering wind effect, 
which balances between the deterministic and random de-
ployment in terms of feasibility and the required number of 
nodes. However, it does not take k-resilience into account.  
Compared with other schemes, our scheme not only sta-
tistically guarantees k-resilience considering the environmen-
tal effect, but also efficient from the perspective of the re-
quired number of nodes.

PROPOSED SCHEME 
A. Assumptions 
We assume that each sensor node is deployed in the 2-
dimensional area from the air vehicle which moves at a fixed 
height of h, with a constant velocity v in parallel to the axis X 
as shown in Figure 1. While dropping, a sensor node is af-
fected by the environmental effect, mainly wind, which is 
assumed to conform to Gaussian distribution of E ~ N(μ, σ2).

For simplicity, we assume that the environmental effect is 
also 2-dimensional and thus the E is divided to Ex ~ N(μx, 
σx
2) and Ey ~ N(μy, σy
2). Finally, each sensor node is assumed 
to have a fixed transmission range of R. 
B. k-Resilient Node Deployment Scheme 
As stated previously, we select a node deployment 
scheme using an air vehicle to find a balance between the 
deterministic deployment and the random deployment. 
When a sensor node is dropped from an air vehicle as de-
picted in Figure 1, the most probable position P is

where g is the gravitational acceleration, and (x, y) is the 
position of the air vehicle.  The second term and third term in 
the x-coordinate of (1) are from the environmental effect and 
the velocity, respectively. The second term in the y-
coordinate of (1) is due to the environmental effect. Under 
our assumption that the environmental effect conforms to 
Gaussian distribution, we can compute a rectangle where a 
node is really located with a probability of 99.7% using 
μx±3σx and μy±3σy instead of μx and μy in (1). Then, as shown 
in Figure 1, the shaded rectangle S becomes

Using the fact that the real position of the dropped node 
is bounded by the rectangle, which has a width of 6σxh/mg 
and a height of 6σyh/mg, with a confidence probability of 
99.7%, we try to develop a k-resilient node deployment 
scheme. Suppose a circle centered at a node A with a trans-
mission range of R as Figure 2. As mentioned earlier, each 
node must have 2k+1 neighbors to guarantee k-resilience, 
which tolerates up to k compromised nodes. Without the 
environmental effect, we only need to deploy 2k+2 nodes 
within the outer circle in Figure 2. However, the circle 
should be shrunken to the inner circle by σmax which can en-
sure that 2k+2 nodes are located within the outer circle with 
a confidence probability of at least 99.7%. To deploy 2k+2 
nodes within the inner circle, we compute a distance d be-
tween neighboring nodes as follows [4].

Given d, we begin to deploy sensor nodes. Suppose that 
the area to be deployed is a rectangle from (0, 0) to (xmax, 
ymax). Deployment proceeds from (0, 0) to (xmax, 0) in parallel 
with the axis X. To locate the first sensor on (0, 0), an air 
vehicle is firstly located at

The air vehicle then moves with the velocity v in parallel to 
the axis X, and drops a sensor node every d/v second. When 
the air vehicle completes the deployment of the first line, the 
air vehicle moves to deploy the second line which is from 
(xmax, d) to (0, d) aiming at

Then, the air vehicle moves on the reverse direction of the 
axis X in parallel, and drops sensor nodes every d/v second. 
This procedure is repeated until the entire area is covered. 
Note that our scheme does not consider the boundary effect, 
which is left as a future work.

EVALUATION 
In this section, we evaluate our scheme through a simula-
tion in MATLAB where k is 11, S is 10 km × 10 km, R is 
100 meters, h is 100 meters, v is 50 km/hour, m is 100 grams, 
Ex ~ N(100, 5), and Ey ~ N(100, 10). Table I shows that all of 
three deployment schemes guarantee k-resilience, but our 
scheme requires much less sensor nodes than the random 
deployment. It is important to note that our scheme is origi-
nally designed to guarantee k-resilience with the confidence 
probability of 99.7%, but our scheme shows 100 % k-
resilience as shown in Table I. This is because our scheme 
selects the inner circle conservatively as shown in Figure 2.

scheme using an air vehicle which not only guarantees al-

most 100% k-resilience but also requires less number of sen-
sor nodes than the random deployment. Our future work 
includes two things, one of which is to consider the boundary 
effect and the other is to perform the real profiling of the 
environment effect for determining σx and σy.
