 INTRODUCTION 
Temperature is one of the most widely measured physical 
quantities 
in 
industrial, 
consumer, 
and 
computer 
applications. Measurement of temperature is critical in 
various modern portable electronic devices as notebooks, 
tablets and smart phones to monitoring and control battery 
and CPU temperatures and compensate oscillator drift. 
Accurate temperature measurements are also necessary in 
many other measurement systems such as different 
instrumentation applications and process control [1, 2]. 
The modern forecast of MarketsandMarkets analysts 
reports that the market size of temperature sensors in the year 
2010 was $3.27 billion and is expected to reach $4.51 billion 
by 2016, at an estimated CAGR of 5.6 %. In terms of 
volume, 2.02 billion temperature sensors were shipped in the 
year 2010 and the number is expected to reach 3.54 billion 
by 2016, at an estimated CAGR of 10 % from 2011 to 2016 
[3]. Due to improved sensitivity, temperature sensors are 
used in loads of applications such as petrochemicals, 
automotive segments, consumer electronics, computer 
peripherals, space applications, and industrial segment. 
There is a rise in demand for consumer electronic devices, 
which use microprocessors such as smartphones, media 
players, cameras and gaming devices that make use of 
temperature sensors ICs to a greater extent [3]. 
The most common sensors for measuring temperature are 
thermocouple, thermistors and resistance temperature 
detectors (RTDs). Fiber-optic sensors, IR sensors, quartz 
thermometers and ultrasonic thermometers, while more 
specialized, are growing in popularity for temperature 
measurements [4]. 
Thermistors (THERMally sensitive resISTORS) have a 
considerably higher sensitivity than other temperature 
sensors [5].  Thermistors have either a negative temperature 
coefficient (NTC), that is their resistance value goes down 
with and increase in the temperature, or a positive 
temperature coefficient (PTC), their resistance  value goes up 
with an increase in temperature. NTC thermistors are used 
mainly for temperature sensing applications because they are 
more stable, while PTC thermistors are typically used for 
circuit protection applications and as heating elements in 
small temperature-controlled ovens [6]. NTC thermistors 
have found a wide application in temperature measurement 
and control in chemical, food and automobile industries, in 
measurement instruments, and medicine [7]. 
A main advantage of thermistors for temperature 
measurements in comparison with other popular temperature 
sensors is their extremely high sensitivity [8], for example, 
sensitivity of -100 /0C in comparison with 0.4 /0C for 
RTDs. It allows to detect miniature variations in temperature, 
which could not be observed with an RTD or thermocouple. 
Other advantages of thermistors are the following: low 
absolute error  0.05 0C; high resistance value from 30  to 
20 M (at 25 0C); short response time due to low thermal 
mass; easier to wire (2-wire configuration); miniature size, 
and low cost [4, 8, 9]. 
The major tradeoff for these advantages is thermistor's 
highly nonlinear output and relatively limited operating 
range typically from - 55 0C to 300 0C depending on the type 
of thermistor. However, special high-temperature sensors, 
such as chromium oxide ceramic thermistors made by GE 
Sensing can operate up to 1000 0C [5]. 
Typical, average comparative characteristics for common 
temperature sensors are shown in Table 1. 
When thermistors are used in temperature sensing, they 
must be connected to a corresponding measuring circuit. 
Very often, the measurement circuits are voltage dividers or 
bridge circuits. However, due to strongly, exponential type 
of the thermistor characteristic, a linearization must be used 
to make their application much easier [7]. 
With the increasing availability of integrated circuits, the 
demand for high resolution temperature measurement is now 
greater than ever [10] .There is no limit to the resolution of 
thermistors. The limitations are till now in the electronics 
needed to measure to a specific resolution. They also exist in 
determining the accuracy of the measurement at a specified 
resolution [11]. 
Formerly, the nonlinear resistance vs. temperature 
characteristic was problematic in analog sensing circuits 
[12]. Today, however, with the advent of digital and quasi-

digital electronic controls the linearization can be handled 
via equations in software or lookup tables. This paper is 
divided into four main parts. The first part contains state-of-
the-art review of existing interfacing circuits for thermistors 
including integrated solutions, available on the modern 
market. The second part includes a design approach for 
thermistor sensing systems based on a Universal Sensors and 
Transducers Interface circuit (USTI). The third part devotes 
to experimental investigation of designed temperature 
multisensor system prototype based on the epoxy bead NTC 
thermistor S861 from EPCOS [13]. The last part of the paper 
provides conclusions and future research directions.

INTERFACING CIRCUITS FOR TERMISTORS:  
STATE-OF-THE-ART 
The use of thermistors for temperature sensing requires 
some signal conditioning and interfacing hardware to 
produce an output for the further processing. Let consider 
main types of such interface circuits. 
A. ADC based Thermistor Interfacing 
The outputs of most linearizing circuits for thermistors 
are analog in nature and need to be converted to a digital 
form before being interfaced to digital instruments or DAQ 
systems. Digital processing capability (microcontrollers) is 
available now in many sensor systems at reasonable cost. In 
addition, such systems contain an excitation current or 
voltage source, amplifier, lowpass filter, analog multiplexer 
and high-resolution ADC [2, 14-18]. The temperature 
resolution in such systems, using tight tolerance thermistors 
and resistors can be in the order of 0.01 0C [10, 14]. 
Nevertheless a high resolution and small absolute error  
0.3 0C [14] some such technical solutions are not suitable 
for multichannel temperature measurements [2, 14-16]; 
others - contain analog multiplexers [17], which introduce an 
additional error. In addition, such traditional analog design 
approach is not suitable for the further smart sensor system 
integration, especially for technological processes less than 
100 nm [19, 20]. 
B. 
Temperature-to-Frequency (Period) Converter based 
Thermistor Interfacing 
The use of both: PTC and NTC thermistors in resonant 
circuits to provide low frequency output is known from the 
end of 60's [21, 22]. The main advantage of a frequency 
output is that an ADC is not required. A frequency output is 
also useful in applications where the sensor conditioning 
circuitry is combined with a remote temperature sensor [23]. 
Thermistor 
interfacing 
linearization 
circuits 
with 
frequency output based on different kinds of multivibrators 
are described in [7, 24-26]. In these circuits, different 
degrees of linearity were obtained over limited ranges of 
temperatures (see Table 2).  An improved converter based on 
an astable multivibrator with acceptable level of linearization 
over an increased temperature range 0-86 0C with sensitivity 
21 Hz/ 0C has been reported in [27]. 
A modified type of a relaxation-oscillator-based 
temperature-to-frequency converter has been implemented 
using a delay network and described in [28]. It exhibits linear 
input/output relation over the wide range -20 ... + 250 0C 
with a sensitivity of 14.7 Hz/ 0C. The use of inverse 
exponential nature of the voltage-time relationship of a 
charging RC network based on a modified square wave pulse 
generator for thermistor characteristic linearization is 
reported in [29]. Although the experiment was done for a 
temperature range of 5 to 85 0C, the circuit has been 
designed for the extended temperature range of -100 to  
+225 0C with a sensitive of 9.6 Hz/0C. 
The linear temperature-to-frequency converters based on 
monostable multivibrator on the basis of integrated timer of 
555 Series are described in [9, 30] for the temperature range 
of 270 to  +370 0K with sensitivity of 10 Hz/0K and 3 kHz 
output frequency corresponds to temperature of 300 0K [30].  
In the circuit reported in [9], as the thermistor resistance 
varies from 198.3 to 551.2 k, the period of the square wave 
varies from 22,542 to 61,671 s. 
A linear temperature-to-frequency converter using an 
integrable Colpitts oscillator is reported in [31] with 
47

sensitivity of 59 Hz /0C and residual nonlinearity less than 
2.85 % over the temperature range of -20 to +60 0C and 
frequency output approximately from 3.2 to 8 kHz.

A temperature-to-frequency/time converter based on the 
voltage-to-frequency (or time) converter with linearity better 
then 0.1 % per decade is described in [32]. 
In comparison with the analog output, the frequency 
output has many well known advantages [20] including easy 
optical or pulse-transformer isolation. As rule, all described 
above 
temperature-to-frequency 
converters 
based 
on 
thermistors are well suitable for remote temperature sensing 
and telemetry. But the problem to convert frequency-to-
digital with appropriate resolution and accuracy is still 
actual. 
III. 
THERMISTOR SENSING SYSTEM DESIGN 
The designed universal thermistor based temperature-to-
digital converter is based on the novel Universal Sensors and 
Transducers Interfacing (USTI) integrated circuit [20, 33], in 
which a three-signal measurement ramp rate method is used 
for  conversion [20, 34, 35]. There are three possible modes 
for interfacing of thermistors with the USTI IC: resistive 
measuring mode; resistive bridge measuring mode and 
frequency measuring mode. Let to consider these methods in 
details. 
A. Resistive Measuring Mode 
In this measuring mode the offset, reference and 
measurand values are converted into three time intervals by 
internal resistive-to-time converter base on the internal 
comparator. The unknown resistance of thermistor should be 
calculated according to the following equation:

where NT, Noff and Nref are the numbers of reference 
frequency pulses counted during the measurand, offset 
cancelation and reference measurement stages respectively; 
Rc is the precision reference resistor. The interfacing circuit 
for this mode is shown in Fig.1. Design considerations 
concerning selection of external components (R0, Rc and C) 
and charging time are described in details in [20, 34]. 
 
 
Figure 1.  
Thermistor interfacing in resistive measuring mode. 
The USTI IC has three popular serial interfaces for 
connection to a master microcontroller, PC or DAQ system: 
RS232 (master and slave), SPI (slave) and I2C (slave). An 
example of commands for resistive measuring at SPI 
communication slave mode is shown in Fig.2.

<F0>…<F5> fractional part of BCD number.

communication mode. 
The further linearization can be handled via nonlinear 
equations in software (by a master microcontroller or PC) or 
lookup tables, containing the manufacturer's device 
characteristics. The custom designed USTI IC for 
temperature measurement based on thermistors (USTI-TEM) 
can make the linearization by itself. 
B. Resistive Bridge Measuring Mode 
Another method of interfacing thermistor to USTI IC is 
to use a Wheatstone bridge with the thermistor as one arm of 
the bridge (Fig.3), and the linearization can be made by 
three-point linearization technique. The selection of R1, R2 
and R3 will determine the sensitivity of the circuit as well as 
the temperature range for which the circuit is best suited. 
The resistive sensor bridge is considered as a resistor 
network with three inputs and one output [20, 35]. The 
resistance of each input to the output depends on the 
48

measurand. Using each input to turn to charge/discharge a 
capacitor connected to the bridge output yields three 
different time intervals. For a full bridge, the ratio between 
the difference between two time intervals and the third time 
interval yields the fractional resistance change. This change 
x for each bridge arm can be obtained by the following way:

      sign byte and 12 bytes of result in BCD code

C. Frequency Measuring Mode 
The designed universal thermistor based temperature-to-
digital converter can work with any known thermistor based 
temperature–to–frequency (period) converters, described, for 
example, in [7, 9, 21-32]. In addition to thermistor or 
resistive bridge interfacing, two such converters can be 
connected directly to one USTI IC at the same time. The 
linearization can be made by a thermistor based temperature-
to-frequency converter. A three-channel thermistors-based 
temperature sensing system is shown in Fig.5. Appropriate 
commands for frequency measurements are shown in Fig.6. 
The number of channels can be easily increased by two 
ways: a time-division channeling method and space-division 
channeling method. The first one means the use of a digital 
multiplexer on one of the USTI's frequency input. The 
second one can be used in SPI and I2C slave communication 
modes, when appropriate number of USTI ICs is connected 
to a master microcontroller's bus.

of the USTI IC and miniature, epoxy resin encapsulated,

tolerances:  1 %,   3 % and  5 %, and is suitable for 
different applications including heating systems, industrial 
and automotive electronics in -55 0C to +155 0C temperature 
range. It has a nominal resistance R25= 10 k.

basic accuracy 0.05 % or better. The real temperature was 
measured by the true-rms multimeter Fluke 187. Charging

Rnom, Rmin, Rmax, Error % and T are calculated parameters for NDT 
thermistor S861 (EPCOS); Rx aver is the result of measurement at +23 0C. 
 
The average resistance of thermistor was 10713.84 , 
which corresponds to +23 0C  0.3 0C. It means, that the 
USTI does not introduce any additional error in the 
measuring channel, which necessary take into account. 
When current flows through a thermistor, it generates 
heat, which raises the temperature of the thermistor above 
that of its environment. This of course will cause addition so-
called self-heating error in measurement. Typically, the 
smaller the thermistor, the lower the amount of current 
needed to self-heat. Certain operating conditions can 
significantly increase such error, for example, a big number 
of serial measurements for the further statistical averaging. 
The increasing of thermistor's resistance due to self-heating 
effect during 100 serial measurements is shown in Fig. 9. 
This effect is more pronounced in still air. If the thermistor is 
located in moving air, liquids or solids, the self-heating error 
is much lower. 
The USTI's error at thermistor's resistance-to-digital 
conversion has four components: the reference error 10- 4 % 
and three components for appropriate time interval 
measurements 
(Fig.8): 
1)

where f0 = 20 MHz is the reference frequency; tx is the

0.005 %. Taking into account that the sensor error is 1.1 %, 
and based on the rule of neglect of small components of error 
[36], all these components of the resulting error can be 
neglected.

Let compare the USTI IC with other existing integrated 
converters for thermistors available. The ispPAC30-based 
thermistor interface circuit from Lattice Semiconductor 
offers higher level of integration in comparison with a 
traditional implementation, which has significantly higher 
component count [37]. But this converter has only an analog 
output and needs high-resolution ADC. 
The MAX6682 IC converts an external thermistor's 
temperature-dependent resistance directly into digital form 
compatible with 3-wire SPI interface. This IC does not 
linearize the highly nonlinear transfer function of NTC 
thermistors, but it does provide linear output data over 
limited temperature ranges, for example, +10 0C to +40 0C 
and 0 0C to +70 0C [38]. 
The MAX6691 four-channel thermistor temperature-to-
pulse-width converter measures the temperature of up to four 
thermistors and converts them to a series of output pulses 
whose widths are related to the thermistors' temperatures 
[39]. An external microcontroller must be used to measure 
accurately appropriate pulse width and pulse space. 
The Universal Transducer Interface (UTI) provides 
interfacing for 1 k - 25 k thermistors and has a 
microcontroller-compatible period-modulated output [40]. 
The typical value of linearity is 13 bit. 
The number of channels and available interfaces for all 
mentioned integrated converters for thermistors are shown in 
Table 4. Only USTI IC has three different, popular serial 
interfaces and can convert frequency, PWM and period input 
signals into digital, and support three various measuring

CONCLUSIONS 
The novel USTI IC designed by authors for multichannel 
smart temperature sensing system based on thermistors, 
supports various modes for thermistor interfacing: resistive 
measuring mode; resistive bridge measuring modes and can 
work with all existing thermistor based temperature-to-
frequency (period, PWM) converters. It has three channels 
and three popular serial interfaces: RS232, SPI and I2C. The 
USTI's does not introduce any significant error into a 
measuring channel, and resulting error of the temperature 
sensor system is determined only by thermistor's error. Such 
design approach lets considerably reduce a time-to-market 
for various thermistor based sensor systems.
