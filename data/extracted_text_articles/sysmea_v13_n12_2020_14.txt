Abstract—This paper addresses the design of a 60 GHz low-
noise ampliﬁer for radar detection systems. Based on an impulse
architecture, the required characteristics of the ampliﬁer are
determined to improve the system performance, especially in
terms of range. The choice of the design technology is based on
a detailed comparative study. Then, the ampliﬁer is designed in
a 70 nm gallium-arsenide metamorphic high electron mobility
transistor technology. It includes three-stages transistors with
inductive degeneration for a suitable trade-off between gain
and noise. Critical design points related to coupling phenomena
are identiﬁed in the layout realization. To limit these coupling
effects, a progressive optimization method is used. The optimized
ampliﬁer achieves a gain of 14.3 dB and a noise factor of 2.1
dB at 60 GHz. The simulated non-linear characteristics show
an input 1 dB compression point IP1dB = −9.6 dBm and an
input third-order intercept point IIP3 ≈ −4 dBm. A good
impedance matching at the input (S11 < −15.4 dB) and the
output (S22 < −16.3 dB) is obtained in the frequency band of
interest. The designed circuit consumes a total direct current
power of 13.5 mW and occupies an area of 1.47 × 1.0 mm2.
In addition, the sensitivity characterization of the ampliﬁer to
voltage biasing, temperature and input impedance variations
shows a good robustness of the design.

INTRODUCTION
A 60 GHz Low-Noise Ampliﬁer (LNA) has been concisely
proposed in [1] for multi-band impulse detection system. But,
for a more complete study, background, technology choice and
design methodology need to be more detailed. In addition,
the design characterization should be done taking into account
the architecture considered and the targeted performance. This
present study is motivated by the aforementioned reasons to
bring a further development of the work presented in [1].
Availability of unlicensed bandwidth around 60 GHz in
several regions of the world (57-66 GHz in Europe [2])
generates great interest in the development of new wireless
systems. In radar, the use of millimeter-wave frequencies is
often preferred to facilitate the detection of small objects (for
example, bullets whose largest dimension does not exceed
10 cm). Furthermore, large bandwidths allow to achieve high
spatial resolutions (a few cm). But, the use of millimeter-
wave frequencies faces challenges related to the design, re-
alization and even packaging of components. However, in
recent decades, standards developments in millimeter-wave
bands have contributed to signiﬁcant advances in terms of
integrated circuit technologies. For example, new process in
Silicon-Germanium (SiGe) [3] [4] and III-V materials [5]
[6] technologies allow the production of devices and systems
for a variety of applications in millimeter-wave bands. These
opportunities create a need for increasingly high-performance
devices. In this context, this study adresses the design of a LNA
with moderate gain and low power consumption, which has
relatively wide bandwidth and small size in order to improve
the performance of radar detection systems.
More generally, this work is part of a large study on the
development of an ultra-wideband millimeter-wave detection
system combining simplicity in terms of architecture and
signal processing, low power consumption and small size. The
objective is then to detect metal objects such as cylinders and
plates, over short ranges (a few meters). In this study, the
considered detection context is the monostatic radar conﬁgura-
tion as described in Figure 1, where the target is a cylindrical
metal of radius r and height h (r; h). The detection system is
schematized by a transceiver (TX-RX) using the same antenna,
but it can also use two co-located antennas. The incidence
angle θ indicates the orientation of the target with respect to
the antenna boresight.

This contribution proposes the design and characterization
of a LNA in a 70 nm Gallium-Arsenide (GaAs) metamorphic
High Electron Mobility Transistor (m-HEMT) technology. It is
organized as follows: Section II presents the detection principle
and the associated architecture. In Section III the sizing of
the proposed system is presented and the speciﬁcations of
the LNAs are determined. Based on a detailed comparison,
the design technology is chosen and described in Section IV.
Then, the design principle is presented in Section V. In Section
VI, we present the layout realization and electromagnetic
simulations results. Design optimization and characterization
are highlighted in Section VII. In addition, results are discussed
and a comparison with the state-of-the-art is presented. And
ﬁnally, a conclusion and future work are addressed in Section
VIII.
II.
PRINCIPLE OF THE DETECTION
The angular dependence of the Radar Cross Section (RCS)
of typical targets such as cylinders and plates (see Figure 2)

often results in a limitation of the detection range, particularly
when they rotate away from the normal incidence. RCSs shown
in Figure 2 are obtained from an electromagnetic simulation
software called High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS).
This limitation of the detection range occurs even when targets
are close to the radar system and depends on their dimensions
according to the operating wavelength [7]. To overcome this
limitation, we use frequency diversity [8]. The idea is to
take advantage of the frequency channel diversity due to the
frequency dependence of the target RCS. This dependency is
illustrated in Figure 3 with RCS simulations from HFSS for
the normal incidence. Note that this frequency dependence of
the RCSs may be more or less strong depending on the angle
of incidence.

The proposed detection principle is then based on the
impulse technique, using a multi-band approach [7] [9], to
improve detection coverage, particularly the continuity of de-
tection according to the target orientation angle θ. Frequencies
around 60 GHz are chosen for spectrum availability [2], and
also for their short wavelengths (5 mm at 60 GHz) to detect
small objects, i.e., those whose largest dimension ≤ 10 cm.
The architecture associated with the detection principle is
shown in Figure 4 in the case of a dual-band system around
frequencies 57.8 GHz and 62.8 GHz. In the transmitter, Differ-
ential Structure Power Ampliﬁers (DSPAs), whose operation
is based on the even mode rejection are used. DSPA1 provides
both signal division and pre-ampliﬁcation. The signals selected
by the ﬁlter bank are then ampliﬁed by DSPA2 and transmitted
by the same antenna. In reception, simple LNAs are used for
better noise performance. The received signals are selected by
a ﬁlter bank identical to the one in transmission before being
subjected to the detection and decision process. More details
of the architecture operation are given in [9].

The proposed architecture can be applied in a more general
case with N frequency bands. It has advantages in terms of
simplicity of implementation by using impulse technique and
does not required any frequency conversion. The processing of
the received signals can be done by different techniques: selec-
tion combining, cumulative detection [9], coherent integration
or non-coherent integration [10]. All of these techniques can
help to improve the performance in terms of detection range
compared to a single frequency band system.
III.
REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS OF THE LNA
To determine the speciﬁcations of the LNA, a full sys-
tem sizing must be performed. For this, we start from the
monostatic radar equation giving the maximum detection range
(Rmax) as a function of the minimum detectable signal power
Smin [11]:
R4
max = PtG2
Aλ2σ
(4π)3 Smin
(1)
where Pt is the transmitted power, GA is the antenna gain, λ
the operating wavelength and σ the RCS of the target.
As Smin is related to the thermal noise power of the
receiver and the required Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNRr) to
detect a target, the radar equation (1) can be written as follows:
R4
max =
PtG2
Aλ2σ
(4π)3 · kT∆f · F · SNRr
(2)
where k is the Boltzmann constant, T the noise temperature
in K, ∆f the receiver bandwidth in Hz and F its noise factor.

It is important to note that SNRr is the minimum signal-to-
noise ratio at the output of the receiver to ensure the detection
of a given target.
In equation (2), the transmitted power and the antenna gain
are determined by standardization [2]. The wavelength λ is
chosen according to the application and the dimensions of the
targets to be detected. The receiver bandwidth ∆f is deﬁned by
the bandwidth of the front-end ﬁlters, which will set the range
resolution ∆R of the system (∆R = c/2∆f). The SNRr is
deﬁned by the desired performance in terms of detection and
false alarm probabilities. The proposed detection principle is
based on frequency and angle variations of the RCS. Thus,
the receiver noise factor F is the only adjustable parameter to
maximize system performance. Due to the position of the LNA
in the receiver chain (see Figure 4), the impact of its noise
factor will be more signiﬁcant over that of the total Radio-
Frequency (RF) chain according to the Friis formula:
F = F1 + F2 − 1
G1
+ F3 − 1
G1G2
+ ... +
Fn − 1
G1G2...Gn−1
(3)
where Fi and Gi are the noise factor and the power gain,
respectively of the i-th stage, and n is the number of stages.
By setting the objective to detect a cylindrical metal target
(r = 0.6 cm; h = 5.4 cm), up to 2 m at normal incidence, we
will determine the required characteristics of the receiver stage
and in particular those of the LNA. For this purpose, we extend
our system to four bands in 57-66 GHz, distributed around the
frequencies 57.8 GHz, 60.2 GHz, 62.8 GHz and 65.2 GHz.
The output power of each channel of the DSPA2 is set at
15 dBm (taking into account frequency bands standardization)
and the gain of the antennas GA at 12 dBi (which can be
achieved with 4 patches of 6 dBi each). The bandwidth of
each frequency channel is 1.6 GHz and the SNRr depends on
the detection technique used. Filter losses are set at 3.5 dB by
referring to [12]. In a conventional single-band architecture, the
SNRr to ensure the detection of a nonﬂuctuating target with
a detection probability of 90% and a false alarm probability of
10−6 is 13.2 dB [11]. In the case of a multi-band architecture,
with a non-coherent integration of 4 pulses from different
frequency bands sufﬁciently spaced, the SNRr is only 8.3
dB for the same detection and false alarm probabilities. Based
on this case of non-coherent integration and using equation
(2), we established the technical speciﬁcations of the LNA
given in Table I, to ensure the targeted detection objective.
Reﬂection coefﬁcients are chosen < −10 dB for an efﬁcient
power transfer at input and output of the LNA, otherwise a
higher gain will be required.

In addition, to determine the predominant parameter of the
LNA on the system performance, we studied the inﬂuence of
its Gain (G) and Noise Figure (NF) on the detection range.
This study presented in Table II evaluates the range variations

The results show that, on average, a variation of 50% in the
noise ﬁgure leads to a variation of about 18% in the detection
range, while a same variation of 50% in the gain inﬂuences
only about 1% the range of the system. This demonstrates
the overriding of noise ﬁgure over gain in improving detection
performance particularly in terms of range, as it can be directly
seen in equation (4). This result will be very helpful in the
choice of the design technology to realize the LNA.
IV.
CHOICE OF THE DESIGN TECHNOLOGY
We have two design technologies for the realization of the
LNA: SG13S, which is a Bipolar-Complementary Metal Oxide
Semiconductor (BiCMOS) SiGe from IHP [13] and D007IH,
an m-HEMT GaAs from OMMIC [14]. In order to choose
the most suitable technology for the system requirements,
we compare them in two steps. The ﬁrst step focuses on
passive elements such as transmission lines (TLs), inductors
and capacitors. In the second step, a study of a simple ampliﬁer
designed with both technologies is proposed.
The realization of inductances and capacitances becomes
more complex as the frequency rises, partly due to increased
losses in dielectric substrates and conductors, but also due to
coupling effects, which become signiﬁcant. In order to take
these problems into account, we have compared the losses
of the TLs and the quality factor (Q-factor) of the grounded
TLs, inductors and capacitors. Figure 5 shows a comparison
of the losses of the two technologies based on simulations
with Advanced Design System (ADS) from Keysight and
HFSS. With SG13S technology, Metal1, which is at the lowest
metallization level, is chosen as the ground plane. TLs and
inductors are made with TopMetal2, which is located at the top
level. With D007IH technology, the ground plane is located
below the chip. TLs and inductors are made with the metal
IN, which is on the top level. The results show a good ﬁt
between the ADS and HFSS simulations. They also clearly
show that losses are higher with the SG13S (about 0.4 dB/mm
more than the D007IH at 60 GHz). Indeed, in the SG13S
technology model, there are no losses in the substrate (tangent
loss tan δ = 0). This implies that losses come mainly from
conductors. In fact, the ground plane on SG13S is too thin
(0.42 µm) compared to 3.5 µm for D007IH. This partly
explains the fact that the metal thickness is higher in the
SG13S with 3 µm compared to 1.25 µm for D007IH to avoid
too much losses. Furthermore, the substrate thickness between
the ground plane and the metallization level of the TLs in

the D007IH is nearly ten times greater than the thickness of
the substrate between Metal1 and TopMetal2 with SG13S.
This results in narrow tracks to make 50 Ω TLs with the
SG13S. These different characteristics explain why the losses
are higher with SG13S. Finally, this is conﬁrmed by the
negative reactance of the TLs characteristic impedance higher
in absolute value in SG13S than in D007IH (not shown here).

The performances of passive elements of the two tech-
nologies, based on electromagnetic simulations with ADS
Keysight, are summarized in Table III. For the same coil
inductor value of 1 nH at 60 GHz, the two technologies
have almost equal Q-factor. However, it should be noted that
inductors in SG13S are less integrable than those in D007IH
because of their shape. For the same capacitor of about 250
fF at 60 GHz, the D007IH has a Q-factor of twice times
higher that of the SG13S. On the other hand, for an equivalent
surface, the density of a capacitor is higher with SG13S than
with D007IH. However, the maximum capacitance value with
SG13S is limited to only 8 pF, whereas with D007IH it can
achieve 50 pF. As resistors are concerned, we note that the
resistance achievable with SG13S are much higher than those
possible with D007IH. Resistivities are generally higher on
silicon (Si) than on GaAs.
Generally, GaAs technologies have better loss performance
than Si technologies. This is partly due to the fact that the
resistivity of GaAs substrates is higher than that of Si. Given
the characteristics of the passive elements, the SG13S has
the advantage of facilitating the realization of more integrable
components (lines, capacitors, resistors). On the other hand,
it presents too high losses for low noise applications. Unlike
SG13S, the D007IH technology has the advantage of having
low losses. At 60 GHz, the use of TLs is often preferred
for the realization of inductors in particular. Therefore, the
D007IH technology, due to its low losses, presents a major
advantage for low noise applications. However, at millimeter-
wave frequencies, the performance of a circuit does not depend
only on the performance of the passive or active elements taken
separately. Therefore, an overall analysis of the full circuit
elements is necessary. For this reason, we have evaluated
the performance of single-stage ampliﬁers designed with both
technologies based essentially on distributed elements and for
an operation at 61.5 GHz (see Table IV). The ampliﬁer with

MOS transistor is the least efﬁcient in terms of gain, NF and
power consumption (PDC). The one with bipolar transistor has
advantages in terms of gain and power consumption, but its
noise ﬁgure is high. With the m-HEMT transistor, the ampliﬁer
has a gain almost equal to that of the bipolar transistor, with
moderate power consumption (more than half that of the MOS
transistor), and a noise ﬁgure of 1.4 dB lower than that of the
bipolar and MOS transistors. Although its reverse isolation
(S12) is lower than those of bipolar and MOS transistors, the
use of a multi-stage structure will allow to achieve a good level
of isolation. Thus, performance with the m-HEMT transistor,
with its low noise level, relatively good gain and moderate
power consumption seems more suitable to meet our system
requirements.
Based on the comparisons made in Tables III and IV, it
is clear that the D007IH technology is better suited than the
SG13S to meet the required technical speciﬁcations set out
in Table I, particularly in terms of noise. This is supported
by the fact that, regarding to the design, the inﬂuence of the
LNA noise ﬁgure is more signiﬁcant than that of its gain on the
system range. Nevertheless, in order to satisfy the required gain
level, the use of a multi-stage structure will be unavoidable.

D007IH is a 70 nm gate length GaAs technology providing
fT /fmax of 300 GHz/450 GHz. It offers a depletion transistor
m-HEMT [15], with high transconductance of gmmax = 1600
mS/mm, which can support a voltage VDSmax of 3 V and
a maximum current IDSSmax of 400 mA/µm. This type of
transistor offers good performance in terms of noise, with a
noise factor of only 0.5 dB at 30 GHz, giving it a privilege for
security applications (millimeter-band imaging), telecommuni-
cations or radars. The process of the technology consists of a
3.5 µm metal in its underside, a 100 µm thick GaAs substrate
above which different metallization levels are distinguished.
These metallization levels are separated by dielectric layers of
silicon-nitride (SiN) and silicon-dioxide (SiO2). The most used
metal layer for TLs realization is named IN metal and has a
thickness of 1.25 µm. It is also possible to associate this layer
with a gold layer of the same thickness for less losses.
V.
DESIGN DESCRIPTION OF THE LNA
The design of the LNA is done with ADS Keysight. Taking
into account various simulation tests, the common source
topology has been retained. Indeed, this topology is more
suitable for low noise components compared to the cascode
and common grid topologies [16], the latter offering better
stability, higher gain, but also a not desired higher noise
ﬁgure. In addition, the common source topology is simple to
implement and provides moderate gain. In order to meet the
required technical speciﬁcations of the LNAs established in
Table I, particularly in terms of gain, we used a three-stages
structure, as shown in Figure 7 [17] [18]. To optimize the
performance of an ampliﬁer, transistors size and bias point
must be properly chosen. The size of the transistors is selected
so as to ensure a good trade-off between gain and noise for
the optimal bias point. A parametric study allowed to choose
a transistor with 2 × 25 µm gate development and a voltage
VDS = 1 V.
The stability of the LNA is ensured by making each stage
unconditionally stable. As the transistors are identical for all
stages, they are degenerated in the same way so that the
overall circuit is unconditionally stable in a larger bandwidth.
Figure 8 shows the stability of the ﬁrst stage through the
Rollet’s stability factor (K) and the parameter B. In addition,
a resistor is used in the bias circuits to further stabilize the
LNA. The value of this resistor is meticulously chosen because
it inﬂuences the gain and noise performance of the LNA [19].
With the voltage drop across the resistor, the VD potential
is increased to 1.1 V to ensure a current IDS = 4.1 mA.
Moreover, the degeneration of the source allows to closer the
Maximum Available Gain (MAG) and NF circles together, as
shown in Figure 9. This makes the input stage matching easier
[20].

and a GaAs implanted resistor (RG or RD) to improve low
frequency stability. The input matching network is formed by
the link capacitor C1, the open transmission line TL1, which
acts as a capacitor and an inductor made by TL2. The inter-
stages matching networks 1-2 and 2-3 are formed by identical
topologies C2, TL3, C3 and C4, TL4, C5 respectively. This
topology also makes it possible to isolate the power supplies
of the different stages. The output matching is made by a
simple serial structure C6 and TL5, optimized for a better gain,
without too much degradation of the total noise ﬁgure of the
LNA.

LAYOUT REALIZATION AND SIMULATIONS RESULTS
At high frequencies and particularly at 60 GHz, the dif-
ferences between schematic and layout simulations are often
signiﬁcant depending on the accuracy of the passive compo-
nents models, which is related to the technology. Thus, to
minimize these differences, elements such as bias circuits,
Direct Current (DC) and RF pads, transistor access and link
capacitors have been ﬁxed from their electromagnetic models.
This approach allowed the design to be lighter, since only the
matching networks will then be optimized during the transition
to the full layout.
The layout realization is done progressively in two main
steps. Firstly, by considering the results of the partial electro-
magnetic simulations of the components i.e., each element is
simulated alone without taking into account the others. And
secondly, the overall simulation of the full LNA circuit. In
addition, it should be noted that progressive optimizations have
been made in order to maximise the overall performance of
the circuit. The resulting 60.2 GHz LNA layout is shown in
Figure 10 including RF and DC pads. All TLs are made with
the same metal layer denoted IN and ground connections are

result in a more or less pronounced degradation of the circuit
performance. In our case, we can see on Figure 11 the rise in
reﬂection coefﬁcients at both input S11 and output S22, but also
a slight improvement in the S21 coefﬁcient and the noise ﬁgure,

as can be seen in Figure 12. In practice, it is very difﬁcult
to estimate these couplings. However, a re-optimization has
been done to minimize the reﬂection coefﬁcient degradations,
but also to improve as well as possible the gain and noise
performances. Moreover, the stability of the circuit is perfectly
ensured at least until 100 GHz as shown in Figure 13.

The global simulations results meet the targeted speciﬁca-
tions. A gain of 14.5 dB and a noise ﬁgure of 2.06 dB are
noted at 60.2 GHz. Reverse isolation is approximately -34 dB
and the reﬂexion coefﬁcients S11 and S22 are less than -15 dB
in the band of interest (59.4-61 GHz). The -3 dB bandwidth
(for S11 < −10 dB and S22 < −10 dB) ranges from 54 to
65 GHz with a ﬂuctuation of about 0.38 dB in noise ﬁgure.
In the band of interest, the variation in gain is about 0.9 dB
and the noise ﬁgure ripple is less than 0.1 dB. In addition, the
LNA consumes about 13.5 mW.
VII.
DESIGN OPTIMIZATION AND CHARACTERIZATION
To gain in miniaturization, we have optimized the size of
the LNA. This is done progressively in two main steps. We
started by reducing the length of the bias circuits so that the
LNA does not exceed 1 mm following to the height of Figure
10. This was done by replacing the straight quarter-wave TLs
by equivalent meandered lines. The use of meandered lines
more or less changes the impedances presented at the input
and output of the transistors. Therefore, the matching networks
have been re-optimized. Thus, the capacitors and the grounded
TLs have been resized in order to reduce the overall size of the
circuit while minimizing the potential coupling between circuit
elements. This made it possible to limit the rise in coefﬁcients
(S11 and S22) and to guarantee the required performance in
terms of gain and noise. The optimized LNA is shown in
Figure 14 and occupies an area of 1.0 × 1.47 mm2. Its S-
parameters and noise ﬁgure are shown in Figure 15 and the
non-linear characteristics in Figures 16 and 17.
Table V presents a comparison of the LNA performance
before and after optimization in the band of interest for the
detection system. With a gain of 14.3 dB and a noise ﬁgure of
2.1 dB at 60.2 GHz, the optimized LNA has almost identical
performances with the one shown in Figure 10.
The reﬂexion
coefﬁcients are less than -15.4 dB for S11 and -16.3 dB for S22
in the band of interest. Also note that the stability of the LNA

stability is ensured up to at least 100 GHz. The non-linear
characteristics show good performances with a very slight
improvement form -10 dBm to -9.6 dBm for the IP1dB and
from -4.4 dBm to -3.9 dBm for the IIP3. All of the above
mentioned results prove a meticulous optimization of the LNA
with an area reduction of about 27% , while maintaning the
same power consumption of 13.5 mW.

To further characterize our design, we are now evaluating
its sensitivity to bias voltages, temperature and load variations
in the band of interest (59.4-61 GHz). These studies are
necessary to see how these parameters will inﬂuence the
performance of the designed LNA and more globally the
performance of the system.
Voltage sensitivity is evaluated by quantifying the varia-
tions in S21 and NF following the bias voltages VDS and VGS
variations respectively, depending on whether their inﬂuences
are more or less signiﬁcant. Results are shown in Figures 18
and 19 with a variation of ±10 % around the nominal bias
voltage. The results of these studies show that our circuit is not
very sensitive to bias voltage errors. Indeed, a 20% variation
in the VGS voltage leads to a variation of about 2 dB in gain

(< 50 %), which has a negligible inﬂuence on the range of the
system (see Table II). On the other hand, a 20% variation of
the VDS leads to a ﬂuctuation of less than 0.3 dB in the noise
ﬁgure. This corresponds to a variation of less than 1%, thus a
negligible inﬂuence on the system range as it can be deduced
from Table II.
Usually, the simulation temperature is taken at 16.85◦ C
(290 K) as recommended by the IEEE standard for noise ﬁgure
measurements. Thus, to characterize the temperature sensitivity
of the LNA, we have simulated it under different temperatures
ranging from −40◦ C to 125◦ C. The results obtained in
noise ﬁgure variations are shown in Figure 20. Gain variations
are not presented here, because they are obviously negligible
(< 0.1 dB). The results show a maximum variation of 0.24
dB in the noise ﬁgure between 59.4-61 GHz. As with the
voltage sensitivity, these results show a negligible inﬂuence
of noise ﬁgure variations on the system range when the LNA
is subjected to large temperature variations.

we evaluated the variations in gain and noise ﬁgure of the LNA

by changing its input impedance with a ±10% variation around
the nominal value of 50 Ω, as shown in Figure 21. The results
show that both the gain and the noise ﬁgure have a ﬂuctuation
of less than 0.1 dB when the input impedance of the LNA
is varied from 45 Ω to 55 Ω. Again, the performance of the
LNA shows negligible variations that will not have signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on the detection system range.

Concisely, sensitivity studies reveal a high robustness of
the designed LNA with respect to variations in bias voltage,
temperature and input load (mismatch). In fact, in all three
cases, the maximum variation in gain is about 2 dB for a
variation of ±10% in VGS voltage, while for the noise ﬁgure
it is less than 0.3 dB. These sensitivity performances avoid
a signiﬁcant decrease of the system range when the LNA is
subjected to signiﬁcant variations in voltage, temperature or
input load.
Finally, the performance of the designed LNA compared
with the state-of-the-art is summarized in Table VI. LNAs
designed around 60 GHz with different technologies are
considered. Usually, the ﬁgure of merit (FoM) of an LNA
is calculated as a function of the gain, noise ﬁgure and
power consumption as deﬁned in [3]. But, considering that the
inﬂuence of the gain is negligible on the detection performance
of the system (particularly in terms of range, as shown in Table
II), we deﬁne the FoM as follows:
FoM =
1
(NF − 1) · PDC
(5)
This deﬁnition of the FoM is more consistent to our detection
context, especially in relation to the proposed architecture.
Furthermore, it should be noted that in Table VI, the FoMN is
the normalized FoM to our LNA result. Regarding Table VI,
our LNA shows good performance, especially in terms of noise
ﬁgure, even if some of the results are based on measurements.
With a moderate power consumption compared to other III-V
technologies [19] and [27] or even the 40 nm CMOS [21], it
presents a good gain and meet the targeted detection objectives.
Note that more gain can be achieved by increasing the drain
voltage of the output stage or adding a fourth transistor. But
this would obviously increase the power consumption and a
little more the noise ﬁgure. In addition, it is clear that the
non-linear characteristics of our designed LNA are much better
than those of the m-HEMT and CMOS technologies presented
in Table VI. As an example, its IP1dB is -9.6 dBm, while it
is less than -17 dBm for [4] [22]- [24] and [27]. The same is
observed for the IIP3. Moreover, our LNA is more integrable
compared to the reported same type technologies (50 and 100
nm GaAs m-HEMT). In our detection context, our design is
more efﬁcient with a better ﬁgure of merit.
In summary, the performance of the designed LNA satisfy
perfectly the speciﬁcations established in Table I. Furthermore,
with these performances and taking into account the proposed
system (see Figure 4), the detection range is improved up
to 2.3 m for the considered metal cylinder (r = 0.6 cm;
h = 5.4 cm) at normal incidence (θ = 0◦), when a non-
coherent integration is performed over the received signals in
the four frequency bands. This represents an improvement of
30% in range compared to a conventional single-band detection
system.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This work focused on the design of a 60 GHz LNA for
small metal objects detection system. Firstly, the detection
principle was presented with an impulse architecture based on
frequency channel diversity. Starting from the radar equation
and targeted detection objectives, the critical components of
the architecture were identiﬁed and the required LNAs spec-
iﬁcations established. Following this, the design technology
was choosen based on a comparative study between BiCMOS
SiGe and m-HEMT GaAs. Then, the design was done in
a 70 nm GaAs m-HEMT technology from OMMIC. Three
stages transistors with inductive degeneration and bias circuits
including resistance were used to better scale the transistor
with a good trade-off between gain and noise, while ensuring
unconditionnal stability up to 100 GHz. The LNA is com-
pleted with ADS Keysight. Critical design issues related to
coupling phenomena were highlighted. Post-layout simulation
results with ADS Momentum Microwave solver show good
performance, especially in terms of noise. With a noise ﬁgure
of 2.1 dB at 60 GHz, our LNA is much better that those
commonly found in the state-of-the-art. For a moderate power
consumption of 13.5 mW, which is relativeley low for III-
V’s technologies, it exhibits 14.3 dB of gain at 60 GHz. The
reﬂection coefﬁcients are less than -10 dB in the 54-68 GHz
band. The LNA shows an input power at 1 dB compression
point of −9.6 dBm and an input third order interception point
of −3.9 dBm. Furthermore, the designed LNA occupies less
space with 1.0×1.47 mm2 compared to others of the same type
of technology. In addition, it has been characterized in terms of
sensitivity to voltage biasing, temperature and input impedance
variations. This characterization shows good robustness of the
design. At the end, it was compared to other recently published
60 GHz LNAs, particularly with a speciﬁc ﬁgure of merit
adapted to our detection context. The results of our design
show the potential of III-V’s technologies, especially the 70 nm
GaAs m-HEMT for very low noise applications, particularly
to improve the performance of detection systems.
In terms of design, some future work is planned. First, we
have the manufacturing and characterization by measurements.
And in a longer term, the joint design of the reception chain
(i.e., LNA, ﬁlter and detector) to further improve the system
performances.
