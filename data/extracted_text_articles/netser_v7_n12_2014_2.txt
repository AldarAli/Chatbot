Abstract—In this paper, we consider a single-link multirate
loss system, which accommodates different service-classes with
different trafﬁc and peak-bandwidth requirements. Calls of each
service-class arrive in the system according to a random (Poisson)
or a quasi-random process, and have an exponentially distributed
service time. Poisson or quasi-random arriving calls belong to
service-classes of inﬁnite or ﬁnite number of trafﬁc sources,
respectively. The service-classes are also distinguished, according
to the behaviour of calls under service, in elastic and adaptive
service-classes. Elastic calls can compress their bandwidth by
simultaneously increasing their service time, while, adaptive calls
do not affect their service time. A new call (either elastic or
adaptive) is accepted in the system with its peak-bandwidth
requirement, if there is available link bandwidth. If not, the call
retries one or more times (single and multi-retry loss model,
respectively) with a reduced bandwidth. If the available link
bandwidth is lower than the call’s last bandwidth requirement,
the call can still compress its last bandwidth requirement (down
to a certain bandwidth), together with the bandwidth of all in-
service calls. Call blocking occurs, if, after compression, the call’s
bandwidth still exceeds the available link bandwidth. The system
incorporates the Bandwidth Reservation (BR) policy, whereby
we can achieve certain Quality of Service (QoS) for each service-
class, through a proper bandwidth allocation deﬁned by the BR
parameters. To calculate in an approximate but efﬁcient way,
time and call congestion probabilities, as well as link utilization,
we propose recurrent formulas for the determination of the link
occupancy distribution. The accuracy of the proposed formulas
is veriﬁed by simulation, and is found to be very satisfactory. We
show the consistency and the necessity of the proposed models.
Keywords—Poisson process, quasi-random, time-call conges-
tion probability, elastic/adaptive trafﬁc, reservation, Markov
chains, retrials, recurrent formula.
I. INTRODUCTION
Elastic and adaptive trafﬁc of multirate service-classes
grows rapidly in modern networks, a fact that necessitates the
development of efﬁcient analytical tools for the call-level net-
work performance analysis [1]. The term “elastic trafﬁc” refers
to in-service calls that have the ability to compress/expand
their bandwidth and simultaneously increase/decrease their
service time, during their lifetime in a system. On the other
hand, the term “adaptive trafﬁc” refers to in-service calls that
tolerate bandwidth compression without altering their service
time. Examples of elastic trafﬁc are generally TCP-based
applications (FTP, HTTP, STMP), while examples of adaptive
trafﬁc are mostly real-time applications, like audio and video
streaming, which can be transmitted with an acceptable QoS
after bandwidth compression.
Assuming that the call arrival process is Poisson, the calcu-
lation of various performance measures, such as call blocking
probabilities and system’s utilization, can be based on the
classical Erlang Multirate Loss Model (EMLM) [2] - [3],
which has been extensively used for the call-level performance
evaluation of wired (e.g., [4] - [14]), wireless (e.g., [15] -
[21]) and optical networks (e.g., [22] - [26]). If the call arrival
process is quasi-random, i.e., calls come from a ﬁnite number
of users, then the Engset Multirate Loss Model (EnMLM)
arises [27].
In both the EMLM and the EnMLM, calls compete for the
available link bandwidth according to the complete sharing
policy (i.e., calls compete for all bandwidth resources) and
have ﬁxed bandwidth requirements. The latter means that in-
service calls do not compress their bandwidth during their
lifetime in the system. A new call is blocked and lost, if its
required bandwidth is not available. In both models, the steady
state probabilities have a Product Form Solution (PFS), which
leads to an accurate calculation of call blocking probabilities
(see e.g., [2], [3] and [27]).
In [28] and [29], the EMLM and the EnMLM, respectively,
have been extended to include retrials. Blocked calls retry one
or more times (Single-Retry Model (SRM) or Multi-Retry
Model (MRM), respectively) to be accepted in the link by
requiring less bandwidth. A retry call is blocked and lost,
if the available link bandwidth is lower than the call’s last
bandwidth requirement. In [30], an approximate method has
been proposed for both single and multi retries in the EnMLM
that simpliﬁes the calculation of call blocking probabilities.
In [31], the authors have extended [28] by incorporating
the notion of elastic trafﬁc. Instead of rejecting immediately
a retry call, the link may accept this call by compressing
its bandwidth, together with the bandwidth of all in-service
calls of all service-classes. Elastic calls increase their service
time so that the product bandwidth by service time remains
constant. After compression, the retry call is accepted in the

system, if the resultant bandwidth is not higher than the
available link bandwidth; otherwise the retry call is blocked
and lost. When a call with compressed bandwidth leaves
the system, then the remaining in-service calls expand their
bandwidth.
In [32], [33], the authors have extended [31] to include
adaptive trafﬁc, as well as the Bandwidth Reservation (BR)
policy. Adaptive calls compress or expand their bandwidth
without altering their service time. On the other hand, the
BR policy can achieve equalization of blocking probabilities
among service-classes (either elastic or adaptive), or guarantee
a certain QoS for each service-class, by a proper selection of
the BR parameters so that each service-class meets a certain
link bandwidth capacity. Note that the aforementioned models
are consistent; that is, if blocked calls of all service-classes
are not allowed to retry, then the model of [33] results in the
model proposed in [1].
The consideration of the BR policy is of paramount im-
portance in multirate communication networks, given that the
absence of the BR policy leads to an unfair service (the less
required bandwidth, the better call blocking probability). The
system under the BR policy becomes non-PFS, because the
Markov chain that describes the system, loses its reversibility.
In this paper, we extend [29], [30] to include elastic
and adaptive trafﬁc with retrials under the BR policy. Due
to the existence of retrials, the BR policy and bandwidth
compression, the proposed elastic/adaptive single-retry and
multi-retry loss models for quasi-random input do not have a
PFS. However, we propose approximate but recursive formulas
for the calculation of the link occupancy distribution and,
consequently, time and call congestion probabilities, as well
as link utilization. Note that the proposed models are also
consistent: if calls are generated by an inﬁnite number of users
and blocked calls are not allowed to retry, then the proposed
models result in the model of [1].
The remainder of this paper is as follows: In Section II, we
present application areas for teletrafﬁc multirate loss models
that support elastic trafﬁc. In Section III, for the integrity of
the paper, we review the model of [1], named herein Extended
EMLM/BR (E-EMLM/BR). In Section IV, we review the
models of [33], named herein Extended SRM/BR and Ex-
tended MRM/BR (E-SRM/BR and E-MRM/BR, respectively).
In Section IV.A, we review the E-SRM/BR, while in Section
IV.B, we consider the E-MRM/BR. In Section V, we assume
that calls arrive according to a quasi-random process and
propose the Extended Finite SRM/BR and the Extended Finite
MRM/BR (EF-SRM/BR and EF-MRM/BR, respectively). We
prove the recursive formulas for the link occupancy distribu-
tion and provide formulas for the calculation of time and call
congestion probabilities, as well as link utilization. Section VI
is the evaluation section. We present analytical and simulation
results of the various performance measures for the proposed
models. We also provide analytical results of existing models
for comparison. We conclude in Section VII. Finally, we
tabulate as Appendix A and B, all the symbols and acronyms,
respectively, used in this paper.
II. APPLICATIONS OF MULTIRATE ELASTIC LOSS MODELS
Application areas for multirate loss models that include the
case of elastic trafﬁc and the notion of bandwidth compression
are numerous (see e.g., [34] - [41] and the references therein).
These areas can also be considered relevant to our proposed
models, which include the notion of retrials, the BR policy and
the case of adaptive trafﬁc. However, the proposed models are
mostly applicable in wireless networks, where calls may come
from ﬁnite sources (it is justiﬁed by the limited coverage of
a cell) and their bandwidth can be compressed, while the BR
policy can protect handover calls.
In [34] and [35], an EMLM based model for the recursive
calculation of ﬂow throughput and packet loss rate in IP
networks is proposed. A link of certain capacity accommodates
elastic calls of different service-classes. Arriving calls follow
a Poisson process. The link capacity is shared among calls
according to a balanced fairness criterion: if the occupied
link bandwidth does not exceed the capacity of the link, then
all calls use their peak-bandwidth requirement; otherwise, all
calls share the capacity in proportion to their peak-bandwidth
requirement and the link operates at its full capacity. The main
difference of the compression mechanism between [34], [35]
and the E-EMLM/BR lies on the fact that in [34] and [35],
there is no parameter for admission control. The application of
balanced fairness in multirate tree networks and its comparison
with other classical bandwidth allocation policies (e.g., max-
min fairness) are examined in [36], [37].
In [38], a Code Division Multiple Access cell is considered,
which accommodates multirate elastic service-classes. Elastic
calls arrive in the link according to a Poisson process and have
an exponentially distributed service time. The main target of
this paper is the calculation of upper and lower bounds for call
blocking probabilities based on an extension of [9] (named
herein E-EMLM). In [39], the co-existence of stream trafﬁc
(calls cannot compress their assigned bandwidth) and elastic
trafﬁc in IEEE802.16e mobile WiMAX subject to adaptive
modulation and coding is considered. Calls of both stream
and elastic service-classes arrive in the system according to a
Poisson process and have an exponentially distributed service
time. Stream calls have priority over elastic calls and, in that
sense, elastic calls share the left-over capacity of the system.
This means that the blocking probability of stream service-
classes does not depend on the amount of trafﬁc generated
by elastic service-classes. The co-existence of stream and
elastic trafﬁc results in an analytical model which can not
be described by recursive formulas (see also [40] for a more
general multirate loss model) and, therefore, the calculation of
blocking probabilities is based on the solution of the steady-
state probabilities equations. Such a solution is inefﬁcient for
systems with large capacity and many service-classes, due to
the extremely large number of equations that arise. Another
extension of the EMLM that studies the co-existence of stream
and elastic trafﬁc (with similar problems with those described
for [39]) in the downlink of Orthogonal Frequency-Division
Multiple Access wireless cellular networks is proposed in [41].

III. REVIEW OF THE E-EMLM/BR
Consider a single link of capacity C bandwidth units (b.u.)
that accommodates calls of K service-classes. Let Ke and Ka
be the set of elastic and adaptive service-classes (Ke + Ka =
K), respectively. A call of service-class k (k = 1, . . . , K)
follows a Poisson process with arrival rate λk,inf and has
a peak-bandwidth requirement of bk b.u. (integer value), as
well as a BR parameter of t(k) b.u. The latter refers to the
number of b.u. reserved so that service-class k meets a link
bandwidth capacity of C −t(k) b.u. By assigning a bigger BR
parameter t(k) to a service-class k requiring less bandwidth
per call than another service-class, this, beneﬁts all service-
class calls of a higher bandwidth per call. Let j be the occupied
link bandwidth when a new service-class k call arrives in the
link. Bandwidth compression is introduced in the model by
assuming that j may exceed C up to a value of T b.u.; T
is called virtual capacity of the link. If j + bk ≤ C, the
call is accepted in the system with its bk b.u. and remains
in the system for an exponentially distributed service time
with mean µ−1
k . The new service-class k call is blocked and
lost if j + bk > T − t(k). If T − t(k) ≥ j + bk > C, the
new call is accepted in the system. However, the assigned
bandwidth of all in-service calls, together with the peak-
bandwidth requirement of the new call is compressed. After
the bandwidth compression of all calls (new and in-service)
the system state becomes j = C. The compressed bandwidth
of the new service-class k call is calculated by:
b
′
k = rbk = C
j
′ bk
(1)
where r ≡ r(n) = C/j is the compression factor (common
to all service-classes), j
′
= j + bk
= nb + bk, n =
(n1, . . . , nk, . . . , nK), nk is the number of in-service calls of
service-class k, b = (b1, . . . , bK) and j = PK
k=1 nkbk = nb.
Similarly, the compressed bandwidth of all in-service calls is
equal to b
′
i = C
j′ bi for i = 1, . . . , K. The minimum bandwidth
of a service-class k call is given by:
b
′
k,min = rminbk = C
T bk
(2)
After the bandwidth compression, all elastic calls increase their
service time so that the product (service time) by (bandwidth)
remains constant. A simple tutorial example that describes in
detail the bandwidth compression mechanism can be found
in [13]. The mechanism of bandwidth compression/expansion
and the existence of the BR policy destroy reversibility in the
E-EMLM/BR and therefore no PFS exists. However, in [1] an
approximate recursive formula is proposed, which determines
the link occupancy distribution, G(j), (unnormalized values):
G(j) =

0 for j > T − t(k)
(4)
where αk,inf = λk,inf/µk is the offered trafﬁc-load (in erl) of
service-class k.
As far as the computational complexity of (3) is concerned is
in the order of O(KT).
The BR policy ensures equalization of blocking probabili-
ties among different service-classes by a proper selection of
the BR parameters. If, for example, blocking equalization is
required between calls of three service-classes with b1=1, b2=7
and b3=10 b.u., respectively, then t(1) = 9 b.u, t(2) = 3 and
t(3) = 0 b.u., so that b1 + t(1) = b2 + t(2) = b3 + t(3).
The application of the BR policy in the E-EMLM/BR is
based on the assumption that the number of service-class k
calls is negligible in states j > T − t(k) and is incorporated
in (3) by the variable Dk(j − bk) given in (4). The states
j > T − t(k) belong to the so-called reservation space. Note
that the population of calls of service-class k in the reservation
space may not be negligible. In [8] and [42], a complex
procedure is implemented in order to take into account this
population and increase the accuracy of the resultant blocking
probability in the EMLM and Engset multirate state-dependent
loss models, respectively. However, according to [42], this
procedure may not always increase the accuracy of blocking
probability results compared to simulation.
Based on (3), (4), we can calculate time and call congestion
probabilities, and the link utilization, as follows:
1) The time congestion probabilities of service-class k,
denoted as Pbk, is the probability that at least T −bk +1
bandwidth units are occupied:
Pbk =
T
X
j=T −bk−t(k)+1
G−1G(j)
(5)
where: G = PT
j=0 G(j) is a normalization constant.
Time congestion probabilities are determined by the
proportion of time the system is congested.
2) The call congestion probabilities of service-class k,
denoted as Cbk , is the probability that a new service-
class k call is blocked and lost:
Cbk =
T
X
j=T −bk−t(k)+1
G−1G(j)
(6)
Call congestion probabilities are determined by the pro-
portion of arriving calls that ﬁnd the system congested.
Time and call congestion probabilities coincide in the
case of Poisson arrivals (due to the Poisson Arrivals See
Time Averages (PASTA) property [43]), but not in the
case of quasi-random arrivals.

Note that if the BR policy is not applied in the system, i.e.,
t(k) = 0 for all k (k = 1, . . . , K), then the link occupancy
distribution is given by the E-EMLM [9]:
G(j)=

In that case, the calculation of time and call congestion
probabilities is given by (5), (6), respectively, where t(k) = 0
for all k (k = 1, . . . , K). Furthermore, if T = C, then the link
accommodates only stream trafﬁc (i.e., calls of all service-
classes cannot compress their bandwidth) and the EMLM
results. In the EMLM, the link occupancy distribution is given

IV. REVIEW OF THE E-SRM/BR AND THE E-MRM/BR
A.
The E-SRM/BR
Consider again the link of capacity C b.u. that accom-
modates Ke and Ka elastic and adaptive service-classes,
respectively. Service-class k calls (k = 1, . . . , K) follow
a Poisson process with rate λk,inf, request bk b.u. (peak-
bandwidth requirement), have a BR parameter of t(k) b.u.
and an exponentially distributed service time with mean µ−1
k .
Let j be the occupied link bandwidth, j = 0, 1, . . . , T, when
a service-class k call arrives in the link. Now, we consider the
following cases:
a) If j + bk ≤ C, the call is accepted in the link with bk
b.u.
b) If j+bk > C, then the call is blocked with bk and retries
immediately to be connected in the link with bkr < bk.
Now if:
b1) j + bkr ≤ C the retry call is accepted in the system
with bkr and µ−1
kr > µ−1
k , so that bkrµ−1
kr = bkµ−1
k ,
b2) j + bkr > T – t(k) the retry call is blocked and
lost, and
c) C < j + bkr ≤ T − t(k) the retry call is accepted in the
system by compressing its bandwidth requirement bkr
together with the bandwidth of all in-service calls of all
service-classes. In that case, the compressed bandwidth
of the retry call becomes b
′
kr = rbkr =
C
j+bkr bkr where
r is the compression factor, common to all service-
classes. Similarly, all in-service calls, which have been
accepted in the link with bk (or bkr), compress their
bandwidth to b
′
k = rbk (or b
′
kr = rbkr) for k =
1, . . . , K. After the compression of all calls the link state
is j = C. The minimum value of the compression factor
is rmin = C/T.
Similar to the E-EMLM/BR, when a service-class k call,
with bandwidth b
′
k (or b
′
kr), departs from the system, the
remaining in-service calls of each service-class i (i
=
1, . . . , K), expand their bandwidth in proportion to their
initially assigned bandwidth bi (or bir). After bandwidth
compression/expansion, only elastic service-class calls in-
crease/decrease their service time so that the product service
time by bandwidth remains constant.
The existence of retrials, the BR policy and the bandwidth
compression mechanism destroy reversibility in the model and
therefore no PFS exists. However, in [33] an approximate
recursive formula is proposed for the calculation of the un-
normalized values of the link occupancy distribution, G(j):

Dkr(j − bkr) =
 bkr for j ≤ T − t(k)
0
for j > T − t(k) ,
and t(k) is the reserved bandwidth in favor of calls other than
service-class k calls.
The proof of (10) is based on:
i) the application of local balance between adjacent states,
which exists only in PFS models,
ii) an approximation in (10), expressed by γkr(j), which
assumes that the occupied link bandwidth from retry
calls of service-class k is negligible, when j ≤ C −
(bk − bkr),
iii) an approximation in (10), expressed by γk(j) that refers
only to those service-class k calls whose bkr > 0; this
approximation assumes that the occupied link bandwidth
from service-class k calls accepted in the system with
bk b.u. is negligible when j > C.
Having determined G(j)’s, we can calculate time and call
congestion probabilities, as well as link utilization. The ﬁnal
time congestion probability of a retry service-class k call, Pbkr,
is given by [33]:
Pbkr =
T

where G = PT
j=0 G(j) is the normalization constant.
Note that time and call congestion probabilities coincide in
the case of Poisson arrivals. As far as the link utilization is
concerned, it is calculated according to (7), where the values
of G(j)’s are given by (10).
B.
The E-MRM/BR
In the E-MRM/BR, a service-class k call that is not accepted
in the system with its peak-bandwidth requirement, bk, may
have many retry parameters (bkrl, µ−1
krl) for l = 1, . . . , s(k),
with bkrs(k) < . . . < bk and µ−1
krs(k) > . . . > µ−1
k . Similar
to the E-SRM/BR, the E-MRM/BR does not have a PFS and
therefore the calculation of G(j)’s is based on an approximate
but recursive formula [33]:

Having determined G(j)’s in the E-MRM/BR according to
(12), we can calculate the time (and call) congestion proba-
bilities of a retry service-class k call with its last bandwidth

Pbkrs(k) =
T
X
j=T−bkrs(k)−t(k)+1

(17)
The calculation of the link utilization in the E-MRM/BR is
based on (7) where the values of G(j)’s are given by (12).
V.
THE PROPOSED EF-SRM/BR AND EF-MRM/BR
In this section, we extend the retry multirate loss models
of [29], [30] (which do not examine elastic and adaptive
trafﬁc) to include elastic and adaptive trafﬁc under the BR
policy. Blocked calls of quasi-random arrivals have the ability
to retry one or more times (EF-SRM/BR or EF-MRM/BR,
respectively) to be connected in the system with reduced
bandwidth. If the available link bandwidth is still higher than
the last bandwidth requirement of a retry call, then the call
can still try to be connected in the system by compressing
its requirement together with the bandwidth of all in-service
calls.

A.
The EF-SRM/BR
The proposed EF-SRM/BR is a non-PFS model. In order to
prove an approximate but recursive formula for the determi-
nation of G(j)’s we present the following example.
Consider a link of capacity C b.u. that accommodates calls
of two service-classes. The 1st service-class is adaptive and the
2nd is elastic. Calls of both service-classes are generated by a
ﬁnite source population Nk (k = 1, 2). The mean call arrival
rate of service-class k idle sources is λk = (Nk−nk)vk, where
vk is the arrival rate per idle source and nk is the number of
in-service calls. This call arrival process is a quasi-random
process [43]. A Poisson process arises from a quasi-random
process if Nk → ∞ for k = 1, . . . , K, while the total offered
trafﬁc-load remains constant.
Assuming
that
only
calls
of
the
2nd
service-class
can retry, the trafﬁc parameters of both service-classes
are:
(N1, v1, µ−1
1 , b1)
for
the
1st
service-class
and
(N2, v2, µ−1
2 , µ−1
2r , b2, b2r) for the 2nd service-class, with
b2r < b2 and µ−1
2r > µ−1
2 . Initially, let assume that the BR
parameters: t(1) = t(2) = 0. Bandwidth compression is
permitted for calls of both service-classes up to a limit T.
The description of call admission is based on a new service-
class k call (k = 1, 2) that arrives in the system, when the
occupied link bandwidth is j b.u. Then:
i) If j + bk ≤ C, the call is accepted in the system with
bk b.u. for an exponentially distributed service time with
mean µ−1
k .
ii) If j + bk > C we consider the following sub-cases:
a) If T
≥ j + b1
> C, a 1st service-class call is
accepted in the system by compressing b1, as well
as the assigned bandwidth of all in-service calls. The
compressed bandwidth of the 1st service-class call is
given by b
′
1 = rb1 = (C/j
′)b1, where r = C/j
′,
j
′ = j + b1 = nb + b1. Similarly, the bandwidth of
all in-service calls will be compressed (by the same
factor r) and become b
′
k = (C/j
′)bk for k = 1, 2.
After compression has taken place, all calls share the C
b.u. in proportion to their bandwidth requirement, while
the link operates at its full capacity C. The minimum
bandwidth that a 1st service-class call can tolerate is
b
′
1,min = rminb1 = (C/T)b1.
b) If j + b1 > T, the 1st service-class call is blocked and
lost.
c) If j + b2 > C, a 2nd service-class call is blocked and
retries with b2r < b2. Now, we consider three cases:
c1) If j + b2r ≤ C, the retry call is accepted in the
system with b2r.
c2) If j + b2r > T, the call is blocked and lost.
c3) If C < j + b2r ≤ T the call is accepted in
the system by compressing b2r together with the
bandwidth of all in-service calls. The compressed
bandwidth of the call is b
′
2r = rb2r = (C/j
′)b2r
where j
′ = j +b2r. Similarly, the bandwidth of all
in-service calls are compressed (by the same factor
r) and become b
′
k = (C/j
′)bk for k = 1, 2. The
minimum bandwidth that a 2nd service-class call
tolerates is b
′
2r,min = (C/T)b2r.
Although the steady state probabilities in the proposed
model do not have a PFS, we assume that local balance exists
between the adjacent states of the 1st service-class:
(N1−n1+1)v1P(n−
1 )=n1µ1φ1(n)P(n),
1 ≤ nb ≤ T
(18)
where: n−
1 = (n1 − 1, n2, n2r), n =(n1, n2, n2r),
b = (b1, b2, b2r), n1 ≥ 1, P(n) is the probability distribution
of state n, and
φ1(n) =



1
, when nb ≤ C
x(n−
1 )

x(n),
when C < nb ≤ T
0
, otherwise
(19)
where: nb = j = n1b1 +n2b2 +n2rb2r and n2r is the number
of in-service retry calls of the 2nd service-class.
Note that φk(n) is a state dependent factor which describes:
i) bandwidth compression and ii) the increase factor of service
time of service-class k calls in state n. In other words, φk(n)
has the same role with r, but it may be different for each
service-class.
By multiplying both sides of (18) with b1 and r(n), and
based on (19), we have:
(N1−n1+1)α1b1x(n)r(n)P(n−
1 )=n1b1x(n−
1 )r(n)P(n)
(20)
where α1 = v1µ−1
1 is the offered trafﬁc-load per idle source
of 1st service-class, r(n) = min(1, C/j) and 1 ≤ nb ≤ T.
Based on the call admission control mechanism described
for 2nd service-class calls, the following local balance equa-
tions can be derived:
a) For 1 ≤ nb ≤ C, n−
2 = (n1, n2 − 1, n2r), and n2 ≥ 1:
(N2−n2+1)v2P(n−
2 ) = n2µ2φ2(n)P(n)
(21)
where:
φ2(n) =



1
, when nb ≤ C
x(n−
2 )

x(n), when C < nb ≤ T
0
, otherwise
(22)
By multiplying both sides of (21) with b2, and based on
(22), we obtain:
(N2−n2+1)α2b2x(n)P(n−
2 ) = n2b2x(n−
2 )P(n)
(23)
where: 1 ≤ nb ≤ C, and α2 = v2µ−1
2 .
b) If P(n−
2r) is the probability distribution of state n−
2r =
(n1, n2, n2r − 1),
(N2−n2−n2r+1)v2P(n−
2r) = n2rµ2rφ2r(n)P(n)
(24)
where: C − b2 + b2r< nb ≤ T, and
φ2r(n)=



1
, when nb ≤ C
x(n−
2r)

x(n), when C < nb ≤ T
0
, otherwise
(25)
By multiplying both sides of (24) with b2r, and based
on (25), we obtain for C−b2+b2r< nb ≤ T:
(N2−n2−n2r+1)α2rb2rx(n)P(n−
2r)=n2rb2rx(n−
2r)P(n) (26)

Equations (20), (23) and (26) lead to a system of equations:

2r) =
(n1b1x(n−
1 )r(n) + n2rb2rx(n−
2r))P(n)
for C < nb ≤ T
(29)
By assuming that retry calls with b2r are negligible when
1 ≤ nb ≤ C − b2 + b2r and that the population of calls with
b2 is negligible when C < nb ≤ T, we can combine (27),
(28) and (29) into the following equation:
(N1−n1+1)α1b1x(n)r(n)P(n−
1 )+
(N2−n2+1)γ2(nb) α2b2x(n)P(n−
2 )+
(N2−n2−n2r+1)γ2r(nb)α2rb2rx(n)P(n−
2r) =
(n1b1x(n−
1 )r(n) + n2b2x(n−
2 )+n2rb2rx(n−
2r))P(n)
for 1 ≤ nb ≤ T
(30)
where: γ2(nb) = 1 for 1 ≤ nb ≤ C, otherwise γ2(nb) =
0, and: γ2r(nb) = 1 for C −b2 +b2r< nb ≤ T, otherwise
γ2r(nb) = 0.
In order to derive a formula for x(n), we make the following
assumptions:
1) When C < nb ≤ T, the bandwidth of all in-service
calls are compressed by φk(n), k = 1, 2, so that:
n1b
′
1 + n2b
′
2 + n2rb
′
2r = C
(31)
2) We keep the product service time by bandwidth of
service-class k calls (elastic or adaptive) in state n of
the irreversible Markov chain equal to the corresponding
product in the same state n of the reversible Markov
chain:
b1r(n)
µ1
=
b
′
1
µ1φ1(n) or b
′
1 = b1φ1(n)r(n)
b2r(n)
µ2r(n) =
b
′
2
µ2φ2(n) or b
′
2 = b2φ2(n)
b2rr(n)
µ2rr(n) =
b
′
2r
µ2rφ2r(n) or b
′
2r = b2rφ2r(n)
(32)
By substituting (32) in (31), we have:
n1b1φ1(n)r(n) + n2b2φ2(n) + n2rb2rφ2r(n) = C
(33)
where φ1(n), φ2(n) and φ2r(n) are given by (19), (22) and
(25), respectively.
Equation (33), due to (19), (22) and (25) is written as:
x(n)=








for nb ≤ C, n ∈ Ω

C n2b2x(n−
2 )+
1
C n2rb2rx(n−
2r)
for C < nb ≤ T
0
otherwise
(34)
Based on (34), we consider again (30). Since x(n) = 1, when
0≤j≤C, it is proved in [7] that:
(N1−n1+1)α1b1G(j−b1)+
(N2−n2+1)α2b2G(j−b2)+
(N2−n2−n2r+1)α2rb2rγ2r(j)G(j−b2r) = jG(j)
for 1 ≤ j ≤ C
(35)
where: G(j) is the link occupancy distribution, γ2r(j) = 1 for
C−b2+b2r < j, otherwise γ2r(j) = 0.
When C < j ≤ T, we have γ2(j)=0, and due to (34), we
may write (30) as follows:
C
j (N1−n1+1)α1b1P(n−
1 )+
(N2−n2−n2r+1)γ2r(nb)α2rb2rP(n−
2r) = CP(n)
(36)
since r(n) = C/j, when C < j ≤ T.
In order to introduce the link occupancy distribution (G(j))
in (36), we sum both sides of (36) over the set of states
{n ∈ Ω |nb = j }, where Ω = {n : 0 ≤ nb ≤ T}:
C
j (N1−n1+1)α1b1
P
{n|nb=j }
P(n−
1 )+
(N2−n2−n2r+1)γ2r(nb)α2rb2r
P
{n|nb=j }
P(n−
2r)
= C P
{n|nb=j } P(n)
(37)
Since by deﬁnition G(j) = P
n∈Ωj P(n), we may write
(37) as follows:
C
j (N1−n1+1)α1b1G(j−b1)+
(N2−n2−n2r+1)γ2r(j)α2rb2rG(j−b2r) = CG(j)
(38)
where γ2r(j) = 1 for C−b2+b2r < j ≤ T.
The combination of (35) and (38) gives an approximate
recursive formula for the determination of G(j)’s, when calls
of the 1st service-class are adaptive while calls of the 2nd
service-class are elastic and have retry parameters:
G(j) = 1
j (N1−n1+1)α1b1G(j−b1)+
1
min(j,C) [(N2−n2+1)α2b2γ2(j)G(j−b2)] +
1
min(j,C) [(N2− n2−n2r+1)α2rb2rγ2r(j)G(j−b2r)]
for 1 ≤ j ≤ T
(39)
where: γ2(j)=1 for 1≤j≤C, otherwise γ2(j)=0 and γ2r(j)=1
for C − b2 + b2r<j ≤ T, otherwise γ2r(j)=0.
In the general case of K different service-classes, where all
calls may retry, (39) takes the form:

The calculation of G(j)’s in (40), (41) or (42) requires
the values of nk and nkr, which are unknown. In other
ﬁnite multirate loss models (e.g., [11], [27], [29]) there exist
methods for the determination of these values through an
equivalent stochastic system, with the same trafﬁc description
parameters and set of states. However, the state space
determination of the equivalent system is complex, especially
for large systems that serve many service-classes. Thus,
we avoid such methods and approximate nk and nkr in
state j, i.e., nk(j) and nkr(j), as the mean number of
service-class k calls in state j, yk(j) and ykr(j), respectively,
when Poisson arrivals are considered. Such approximations
are common in the literature and induce little error (e.g.,
[30], [46] - [47]). In that case, we may rewrite (41) as follows:

where: αk,inf, αkr,inf and Ginf(j) are the offered trafﬁc-load
(in erl) of service-class k and the link occupancy distribution,
respectively, of the corresponding inﬁnite model (E-SRM/BR)
[33], i.e., the values of Ginf(j) will be determined by (10).
Having determined G(j)’s in the EF-SRM/BR according to
(43), we calculate the time congestion probabilities according
to (11), and the link utilization according to (7). As far as the
call congestion probabilities are concerned, we may again use
(11), but the values of G(j)’s in (43) should be determined
for a system with Nk − 1 trafﬁc sources.
B.
The EF-MRM/BR
Similar to the EF-SRM/BR, the corresponding multi-retry
model does not have a PFS and therefore the G(j)’s calcu-
lation is based on an approximate but recursive formula. In
the EF-MRM/BR, a blocked service-class k call retries s(k)
times with parameters: (bkrs, µ−1
krs) for s = 1, . . . , s(k), where
bkrs(k) < . . . < bkr1 < bk and µ−1
krs(k) > ... > µ−1
kr1 > µ−1
k .
The determination of G(j)’s is based on (46) whose proof is
similar to that of (41) and therefore is not presented:

Having determined G(j)’s in the EF-MRM/BR according to
(47), we calculate the time congestion probabilities according

probabilities are determined again by (17) but the values of
G(j)’s in (47) should be calculated for a system with Nk − 1
trafﬁc sources.
VI. APPLICATION EXAMPLE – EVALUATION
We consider an application example in order to compare
the analytical Time Congestion (TC) probabilities with those
obtained by simulation, in the case of the proposed EF-
MRM and EF-MRM/BR of quasi-random input. Simulation
is based on SIMSCRIPT III [48]. For a better evaluation, we
comparatively present the corresponding analytical results of
the E-MRM and the E-MRM/BR [33], i.e., assuming Poisson
arrivals. We also show the analytical and simulation results
of the proposed EF-MRM for the link utilization; they are
compared with the corresponding analytical results obtained
by the E-MRM. The simulation results of this section are
mean values of 7 runs with 95% conﬁdence interval. The
resultant reliability ranges of the simulation measurements are
very small and, therefore, we present only mean values.
To facilitate the reader, in what follows, we summarize the
order of calculations per model, regarding the analytical TC
probabilities and link utilization:
(A) EF-MRM/BR: Determine G(j)’s according to (47) with
the aid of (48), (49) and (12). Then, determine link uti-
lization according to (7) and TC probabilities according
to (17).
(B) EF-MRM: Determine G(j)’s according to (50) with the
aid of (48), (49) and (13). Then, determine link utiliza-
tion according to (7) and TC probabilities according to
(17) by assuming that t(k) = 0 for all k = 1, . . . , K.
(C) E-MRM/BR: Determine G(j)’s according to (12), link
utilization according to (7) and TC probabilities accord-
ing to (17).
(D) E-MRM: Determine G(j)’s according to (13). Then,
determine link utilization according to (7) and TC prob-
abilities according to (17) by assuming that t(k) = 0 for
all k = 1, . . . , K.
Let us consider a link of capacity C
= 80 b.u. that
accommodates three service-classes of elastic calls. All calls
arrive in the system according to a quasi-random process. The
trafﬁc characteristics of each service-class are the following:
1st service-class: N1 = 100, v1 = 0.20, b1 = 1 b.u.
2nd service-class: N2 = 100, v2 = 0.06, b2 = 2 b.u.
3rd service-class: N3 = 100, v3 = 0.02, b3 = 6 b.u.
The call holding time is exponentially distributed with
mean value µ−1
1
= µ−1
2
= µ−1
3
= 1. Calls of the 3rd
service-class may retry two times with reduced bandwidth
requirement: b3r1 = 5 b.u. and b3r2 = 4 b.u. and increased
service time so that α3b3 = α3r1b3r1 = α3r2b3r2, where
αk = vkµ−1
k , k = 1, 2, 3. The corresponding Poisson trafﬁc-
loads are: α1,inf = 20, α2,inf = 6, α3,inf = 2 erl. In the x-
axis of all ﬁgures (below), we assume that v3 remains constant
while v1, v2 increase in steps of 0.01 and 0.005, respectively.
The last value of v1 = 0.28, while that of v2 = 0.10.
The corresponding last values of the Poisson trafﬁc-loads are:
α1,inf = 28, α2,inf = 10, α3,inf = 2 erl.
Two different values of T are considered: a) T = C = 80
b.u., where no bandwidth compression takes place. In that
case, the proposed model gives exactly the same results

21
International Journal on Advances in Networks and Services, vol 7 no 1 & 2, year 2014, http://www.iariajournals.org/networks_and_services/

with the model of [30], b) T = 82 b.u., where bandwidth
compression takes place and rmin = C/T = 80/82. As far as
the BR parameters are concerned, we choose t(1) = 3 b.u.,
t(2) = 2 b.u. and t(3) = 0 b.u., so that b1+t(1) = b2+t(2) =
b3r2 + t(3). The selection of these BR parameters achieves
equalization of TC probabilities for calls of all service-classes.
In Figs. 1-3 we present the TC probabilities of the EF-MRM
and E-MRM, i.e., we consider the case whereby the BR policy
is not applied. In Fig. 1, we show the analytical and simulation
TC probabilities results of the 1st service-class for both values
of T. Similar results are presented in Figs. 2 and 3, for the 2nd
and 3rd service-class, respectively (TC probabilities of calls
with b3r2). The results of these three ﬁgures show that:
i) The model’s accuracy is absolutely satisfactory com-
pared to simulation (because of the very small differ-
ences of the results).
ii) The TC probabilities are lower, when the compres-
sion/expansion mechanism is introduced. A small in-
crease of T resulted in a great effect on TC probabilities.
iii) The proposed model is important (necessary), since the
results obtained by the existing inﬁnite model (E-MRM)
fail to approximate the results of the proposed ﬁnite
model (EF-MRM).
Successive increases of T will result in even lower TC
probabilities but at the cost of increasing the service time of
all calls. Such behaviour has been observed in various papers
that propose multirate loss models of elastic and/or adaptive
trafﬁc (e.g., [9], [32], [33]). Similarly, the increase of retrials
for a particular service-class will cause the decrease of TC
probabilities for that service-class and a possible increase of
TC probabilities for the rest service-classes. This behaviour
has been observed in various papers that study multirate loss
models with retrials (e.g., [28]-[30]).
In Fig. 4 we present the equalized TC probabilities, when
the BR policy is applied. In addition to the aforementioned
comments for Figs. 1-3, the results of Fig. 4 show an increase
of the TC probabilities of the 1st and 2nd service-classes in
comparison to the corresponding curves of Fig. 1 and Fig.
2, respectively, and a decrease of the TC probabilities of the
3rd service-class in comparison to the corresponding curves
of Fig. 3.
Finally, in Fig. 5 we show the analytical and simulation
results of the link utilization in the case of the E-MRM and
the EF-MRM. Similar results are obtained in the case of
the BR policy, and therefore they are not presented. These
results also show that: i) The model’s accuracy is absolutely
satisfactory compared to simulation. ii) The introduction of
the compression/expansion mechanism slightly increases the
link utilization; the increase of T above C results in a slight
increase of the link utilization, which is anticipated due to
the decrease of TC probabilities. iii) The results obtained by
the E-MRM cannot approximate the results of the proposed
EF-MRM.

CONCLUSION
We propose multirate retry loss models that support elastic
and adaptive trafﬁc assuming that calls arrive to the link
according to a quasi-random process and have an exponentially
distributed service time. Blocked calls have the ability to
retry to be connected in the system one or more times with
reduced bandwidth and increased service time requirements.
Furthermore, if a retry call is blocked with its last band-
width requirement, it can still be accepted in the system
by compressing its bandwidth together with the bandwidth
of all in-service calls. In addition, we incorporate into our
models the bandwidth reservation policy (whereby a part of
the link’s available bandwidth is reserved to beneﬁt calls of
higher bandwidth requirements) and study its effects on the
performance measures. The proposed models do not have a
PFS. However, we propose approximate but recursive formulas
for the calculation of the link occupancy distribution and,
consequently, time and call congestion probabilities, as well
as link utilization. Simulation results verify the analytical
results. As a future work, we intend to study the application of
these models in CDMA networks, and to consider also other
bandwidth allocation policies, such as the threshold policy,
whereby calls of a service-class are not allowed to enter the
system (even if there is available bandwidth), if the number
of in-service calls of that service-class exceeds a predeﬁned
threshold.
