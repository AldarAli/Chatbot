Abstract—Due to the advancement in technology, routers of 
Wireless Mesh Networks can be equipped with multiple 
interfaces to achieve parallel communication sessions among 
nodes. Assigning distinct non-overlapping channels to each set 
of communicating radios increases network connectivity and 
throughput. On the other hand, the performance of wireless 
networks is always limited by the interference phenomena 
among the concurrent transmission sessions. Combined with 
interference constraint topology due to limited available 
orthogonal channels, selfishness of end users further degrades 
individual fairness and affects overall network performance 
due to their protocol deviation in a non-cooperative 
environment. In this paper, we have proposed a non-
cooperative game theoretical model in a multi-radio multi-
channel Wireless Mesh Network based on the end users flows 
in an interference constrained topology. Necessary conditions 
for the existence of Nash Equilibrium have been derived. Our 
simulation results show that our distributed algorithm 
converges to a stable state in finite time where each node gets 
fair end to end throughput across multiple-collision domains at 
the end of the game. Further, the Price of Anarchy of the 
system was measured for several runs which is always near to 
one; showing the strength and stability of our proposed 
scheme.

 INTRODUCTION  
In Non-Cooperative Networks, nodes behave selfishly to 
maximize their own benefit by deviating from the defined 
protocol [2], which leads to system-wide performance 
degradation, instability and individual unfairness. In Mobile 
Adhoc Networks (MANETs) [3], for example, each node 
acts as user of the network as well as rely data for others. A 
non-cooperative node can misbehave by dropping others 
packets to save its battery life while sending its own packets 
to be forwarded by other nodes. This selfish behavior of free 
riders leads to limited connectivity of the network and 
affects individual as well as network-wide performance. If 
all nodes behave selfishly in the same manner, the network 
will end up with each entity in isolation, as shown in Fig. 1, 
nodes c and g drop the incoming packets from other nodes 
 
 
Figure 1.  
Non-Cooperative behaviour in MANETs 
while send their packets to be forwarded by other nodes in 
the network. To cope up with these similar behaviors, 
multiple techniques have been used to enforce cooperation 
among the nodes for the stability of overall system [4]. 
Viewing this behavior from game theoretic prospective, a 
conflicting situation where each entity is self interested in 
the network resources or service leads to a non-cooperative 
game.  
Like MANETs, Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) [5] 
have multi-hop topology spanning multiple collision 
domains. The inherited advantages of self configuration, self 
healing and self organization along with static nature of its 
backhaul routers make it a prime candidate for wireless 
broadband provisioning in users premises.  However, unlike 
MANETs, WMNs routers can be equipped with multiple 
radios due to their static nature and the existence of 
permanent power supplies. Since multiple channels are 
available in the free Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) 
band, multiple radios can be tuned simultaneously to exploit 
the free non-overlapping channels and hence increase the 
overall capacity, connectivity and resilience of the wireless 
mesh backhaul. Due to these characteristics, WMNs is a 
prime candidate to be deployed as a broadband wireless 
access network in the user premises. In WMNs, backhaul 
routers are divided into three types: Gateways, Access 
Points (APs) and core backbone routers. The Gateways have 
direct connection to the Internet while APs provide network

access to the mesh backhaul users. The core backbone 
routers have the responsibilities of forwarding users traffic 
to/from the Internet via mesh gateways as shown in Fig. 2.  
Due to the capabilities of meshing, IEEE has established 
subgroups in their existing network standards like IEEE 
802.11s for WLAN based mesh networks, IEEE802.16e for 
Metropolitan Area Mesh Networks and IEEE 802.15 for 
Personal Area Mesh Networks. Since WMNs have the 
potential to be widely deployed as a broadband multi-hop 
wireless network [6], many vendors have invested in it and 
have deployed practical mesh topologies, e.g., Nortel [7], 
Motorola [8] and TroposNetworks [9]. 
Multi-Radio Multi-Channel (MRMC) in WMNs has 
gained a lot of research attention in the recent years [10]. 
Since wireless networks are always bandwidth constrained 
due to the shared wireless medium, interference from other 
transmissions, high bit error rates and retransmissions limit 
the capacity of wireless networks; multi radios tuned to 
multiple non-overlapping channels improve the overall 
capacity by decreasing the interference as the same channel 
can be reused multiple times in the same backhaul away 
from its transmission and interference range. Since designing 
a good MRMC algorithm is crucial for the WMNs 
performance, therefore a considerable amount of research 
has been done in this specific area.  
Although, selfish routing and forwarding problems in 
MANETs have been well researched by providing solutions 
from Game Theory and considering all nodes as players of 
the game [11,12,13], the static infrastructure of WMNs 
shifts the set of players to the end users premises. Since 
forwarding nodes have no incentive to behave selfishly and 
there is no point to consider them in the set of players [14].  
Game theory is a mathematical tool which is used in a 
situation when multiple entities interact with each other in a 
strategic setup. Formally, a game can be defined [15] as 
consisting of a non-empty finite set of N={N1,N2,….,N|N|} 
players, 
a 
complete 
set 
of 
actions/strategies 
Ai={a1,a2,…a|Ai|} for each Ni  N. A set of all strategies 
space 
of 
all 
players, 
represented 
by 
the 
matrix 
A=A1xA2x…xA|N|.  A(ai,a-i) is a strategy profile when a player 
Ni N selects an action ai from its action set Ai against the 
 
 
 
Figure 2.  
WMNs Components 
actions of all other players N-i. The notation –i is a 
convenient way to represent a set of entities or set of events 
excluding a specific entity or event in a strategic setup. For 
example N-i means set of all players excluding Ni and a-i 
means set of actions of all players excluding action of Ni 
during a strategic interaction. At the end of the game, each 
player Ni N gets benefit in the form of a real number (R) 
called outcome or payoff of the player which is determined 
by the utility function Ui as: Ui=Ai   R. 
Depending on the player’s knowledge about each other’s 
strategies, payoffs, and past histories; games can be 
subdivided into different categories. When players have 
complete information about each other’s strategies and 
payoffs, such type of game is called a game with complete 
information. In games of incomplete information, players 
have partial or no information about each other strategies and 
payoffs.  Games can be simultaneous or sequential 
depending upon the occurrence of individual players actions. 
When players interact with each other and take their 
decisions 
simultaneously, 
such 
games 
are 
called 
simultaneous move games. When the players take decision 
one after the other, such type of games are called sequential. 
When all players have information about each other past 
moves and actions, such type of games are called games with 
perfect information. All the simultaneous move games are 
games with imperfect information. Games where cooperation 
is enforced among players outside the pre-defined rules of 
the game are called cooperative games. In non-cooperative 
games, players cannot communicate with each other through 
some enforceable agreement other than the rules of the game 
[16]. 
In this paper, which is the extension of our previous work 
[1], we address end users flow game across non-cooperative 
multi-radio multi-channel WMNs in a selfish environment 
by considering and interference constrained topology. We 
prove analytically the existence of Nash Equilibrium (NE) 
under certain conditions. 
The rest of our paper is organized as follows. In Section 
II, related research work is presented. Section III provides an 
introduction to our game theoretical model along with some 
essential concepts. In Section IV, we present our analytical 
results and necessary condition for the existence of Nash 
Equilibrium. In Section V, we discuss the convergence 
algorithm. In Section VI, we present our simulation results 
and conclude our paper in Section VII with future directions 
and recommendations.

RELATED WORK 
Application of game theory to networks is not new and a 
huge amount of literature can be found at different layers of  
the protocol stack.  In [17], for example, congestion control 
has been analyzed using game theory while [18, 19, 20] have 
addressed routing games. Power control games have been 
extensively studied in [21, 22] while Medium Access 
Control has been analyzed by using game theoretical 
analysis in [23, 24]. A detailed survey targeting the

telecommunication problems using game theory can be 
found in [25], while game theory applications in wireless 
networks can be specifically found in [26]. 
Due to the practical importance of WMNs, considerable 
research efforts have been put in the designing of an 
intelligent MRMC technique. In [27], authors have addressed 
MRMC with a graph theoretic approach while A. Raniwala 
et al. [28] have presented MRMC models based on flows. 
The work of M. Alicherry et al. [29] addresses routing and 
channel assignment as a combined problem.  Although all of 
the above research work have tackled MRMC from different 
aspects but they consider that all the nodes cooperate with 
each other for system wide throughput optimization and 
selfish behavior has been explicitly ignored. 
In one of their pioneering work, Felegyhazi et al. [30] 
have proven the existence of Nash Equilibrium in a non-
cooperative multi radio multi channel assignment. They have 
formulated channel assignment as a game where nodes, 
equipped with multiple radios, compete for shared multiple 
channels in a conflict situation and the result shows that the 
system converges to a stable Nash Equilibrium where each 
player gets equal and fair share of the channel resources. The 
work of Chen et al. [31] is an extension of [30] where perfect 
fairness has been provided to all players by improving the 
max-min fairness. Despite the interesting results, their work 
is limited to single collision domain while multi-hop 
networks like WMNs span multiple collision domains and 
hence all the above cited work cannot be applied to this 
specific scenario as discussed.  In one of the recent study 
Gao et al. [32] have provided a more practical approach by 
extending the number of hops in the mesh backbone. They 
have proved that allowing coalition among players can lead 
to node level throughput improvement. They have provided a 
coalition-proof Nash Equilibrium and algorithms to reduce 
the computational complexity of equilibrium convergence; 
their solution considers cooperation among the nodes inside 
the coalition and hence cannot be applied to a fully non-
cooperative WMNs environment. More importantly, it will 
be more apposite to consider end users generating flows as 
players of the game [31] because of their competition for the 
common channel resource across the wireless mesh 
backhaul. In such a situation, channel assignment and flow 
routing may be tackled simultaneously.  A class of game 
theoretical model for routing in transportation networks has 
been presented by Rosenthal [33]. The author have 
considered n players in a competitive environment, each 
wanted to ship one unit from source to destination while 
minimizing its transportation cost. They have proven the 
existence of pure strategy Nash Equilibrium. In [34, 35], 
authors have provided game theoretic solutions based on end 
users flows to control  congestion inside the communication 
network. Routing in general wired networks has been studied 
as a non-cooperative game in [36, 37, 38, 39, 40], where the 
conditions for the existence of Nash Equilibrium has been 
derived. Banner et al. [41] have extensively studied the non-
cooperative routing problem in wireless networks based on 
splittable and unsplittable flows. Although, they have proven 
the existence of Nash Equilibrium for both classes of flow 
problems; their solution is not applicable to MRMC WMNs. 
In [14], selfish routing and channel assignment in wireless 
mesh networks is formulated as a Strong Transmission Game 
where it is assumed that selfish nodes at the user premises 
assign channels, in a strategic setup, to their end to end paths. 
While they have solved channel assignment and routing 
problem in a non-cooperative environment from the end 
users selfish prospective, the strong assumption of non-
interference among channels need a large set of orthogonal 
frequencies which is limited by the fewer channels available 
in the IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n standards [33, 34, 35, 36 ]. In 
practice, channel assignment is always an interference 
constrained phenomena due to the availability of fewer 
channels in the orthogonal frequency set of ISM band [46] 
and large backbone size of WMNs. In one of our recent work 
[1], a single stage selfish flow game was formulated in a 
MRMC multiple collision domain and fairness of individual 
nodes was investigated with the assumption of an 
interference free topology. In this paper, we extend our 
previous work by considering channel interference during 
game formulation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
first work in the area of competitive flow routing in a 
MRMC WMNs with interference constrained topology. 
III. 
SYSTEM MODEL AND CONCEPTS 
As shown in Fig. 2, mesh routers having multi radio 
capabilities reside in multiple collision domains. We assume 
that there is always a chance of channel usage conflict 
across the mesh backbone. 
A. Network Model 
We represent multi-hope WMNs spanning multiple 
collision domains with a Unit Disk Graph (UDG) G (V, E) 
[47], where the sets V and E represent mesh backhaul  
routers and their associated links accordingly in the graph 
G. We assume that each mesh router uses same transmission 
power as in IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n [42, 43, 44, 45] standards. 
Any two mesh routers vi and vj can communicate with each 
other successfully, if the Euclidian Distance  between them  
is less than the sum of their radii i-e for any two routers (vi, 
vj)  V:

where rvi and rvj are the radii of vertices vi and vj 
respectively. In other words, they are in the transmission 
range of each other as shown in Fig. 3 by smaller circles 
around the vertices. Let the interference range of a node is 
represented by the outer circle, whose radii is twice that of 
smaller circle, then two set of nodes (v1,u1), (v2,u2) cannot 
communicate with each other if either:  
 
d(u1,v2)<2(ru1+rv2) || d(v1,v2)<2(rv1+rv2) || d(u1,u2)<2(ru1+ru2)   
|| d(v1,u2)<2(rv1+ru2)                                                            (2)

Figure 3.  
Transmission and Interference Range 
Channel assignment to nodes links is essentially  same as 
colouring the edges of UDG with appropriate colours such 
that two edges  ei, ej belonging to any two pair of nodes 
(ui,vi), (uj,vj) satisfying any of the condition in (2)  get 
distinct colours. Refer to Fig. 3, where colouring of UDG 
means assigning distinct colours to interfering edges. 
However, due to the multi-radio nature of mesh routers, 
interference 
constraint 
and 
limited 
available 
non-
overlapping channels; we assume relaxation in the colouring 
assignment where two interfering edges can be assigned 
with same colour. We will discuss it in more detail in 
section B.  
B. Game Theoritic Model 
 
We formulate our game theoretic model by considering 
selfish end users as players of the game with imperfect 
information in non-cooperative multi-collision domain mesh  
network as follows. We divide the core of the mesh network 
in a set of multiple collision domains D={1, 2, 3,…, |d|} and 
the set of non-overlapping orthogonal channels, as present 
in IEEE 802.11a/b [33, 34, 35, 36], are represented by  
C={C1,C2,C3,….C|C|} as shown in Fig. 4. We refer to any 
channel Ci in a specific collision domain as Cij where  CiC 
and   D , respectively. The maximum achievable data rate 
on a channel Ci  C is represented by RCi. We assume that 
the maximum achievable capacity on all the channels is the 
same, i-e: 
          RCi = RCj ,  Ci, Cj  C                                                             (3) 
 
We assume that channels set is limited according to the 
IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n [31, 32, 33, 34] standards and there is a 
chance that a channel reused can interfere according to the 
condition given in (2). We define the degree of interference 
of a channel Ck C as 
ΦCk
, showing the number of links 
which have been assigned the same channel Ck in the same 
collision domain j. In the UDG, it is the number of incident 
edges having same colours as defined in (2).

channel selection vector for each of its flow across the 
multiple collision domains. i.e,:

the arbitrary channel in the channel set across collision

Accordingly, the strategy profile of all players is represented

The nth row of the vector in (5) shows the strategy of player 
Nn, i-e, An as in (4). Each player Nn  N takes a rational 
decision by selecting an end to end path across the core of 
the network towards the gateway of the mesh by maximizing 
its utility function. We formulate the utility function of 
players Nn as:

maximum achievable data rate on channel Ci  C in collision

assume that all users generate CBR flows and define the 
parameter, Fij, representing the number of flows on a specific 
channel, CiC, in any collision domain, jD, as:

player strategy will be to select an end-to-end path having

channels which are least loaded by other flows and the 
channels are least interfered. We define the term 
ΦCi
 as the 
degree of interference on a specific link to which channel Ci 
has been assigned.  In such a selfish environment, game 
theory provides a realistic solution towards the stability of 
the system by reaching a point where no flow can move to 
any other channel across the whole end to end path 
unilaterally. This stable point is called Nash Equilibrium 
(NE) and is defined below [15]. 
A strategy profile A* is called Nash Equilibrium if for

get any benefit by unilaterally deviating from its strategy. 
IV. 
EXISTENCE OF NASH EQUILIBRIUM 
To check the existence of Nash equilibrium in our 
proposed model, we assume two types of channels in any 
collision domain. Channels having maximum number of 
flows are represented by Cmax and the category of channels 
having minimum number of flows as Cmin. We define a 
parameter ℓ%&which is the difference of number of flows on 
any two channels Ci, Ck  C within a specific collision 
domain   D i-e:

where Fij(max) and Fij(min) are the number of flows on Cmax and 
Cmin,  respectively.  
We define another term ψ(Ci, Ck), which defines the 
difference in degree of  interference between two channels 
Ci, Ck C within a specific collision domain   D as:

Where 
ΦCi
 and 
ΦCk
 are the degrees of interference on 
channel Ci and Ck , respectively as defined in section III.  
Being rational, the objective of each player is to 
maximize its utility by selecting an end to end path with 
channels having minimum number of load and minimum 
interference on it. We define some necessary conditions for 
such a selfish environment and prove the existence of Nash 
Equilibrium.

If all the flows of any player Nn selects any channel Ci   
Cmax in any collision domain while flows of all other users Nm 
put their flows on CmCmin, then player Nn will have an 
incentive to unilaterally deviate from her strategy and this 
can no longer be a Nash Equilibrium. As shown in Fig. 5, 
player N1 selects Channel 1 for all its four flows in collision 
domain j. Its utility can be increased if one of the flow is 
transferred to other channels (C2, C3 or C4). 
Proof: Let αn be the gain of player Nn deviating from its 
current strategy which has defined all its flows n.fn on one of 
channel Cij  Cmax. Let Fij be the total flows on CijCmax and 
Fkj be the total flows on CkjCmin.   
then: 
αn = Un

deviating from its current strategy. 
Let θNn is one of the flow, which player Nn redirect to 
another channel CkCmin in any collision domain  jD and 
calculate the benefit of change along the path as follows.

Hence the strategy profile A* cannot be a Nash 
Equilibrium. 
Lemma 2: In a MRMC multiple-collision domain mesh

1%  then the strategy profile A* is not a Nash Equilibrium. 
Let ℓik>1in any collision domain  D along the end to end 
path of flows then it essentially means that there exists a 
channel  CkjCmin in  D  for which

and hence at least one of the flow fn  Nn on CijCmax has 
incentive to change for her benefit. As shown in Fig. 6, N2 
can unilaterally switch one of its flows to C1, C2 or C4. 
Proof:  Let a user Nn  changes its flow, fn,  from CijCmax 
to CkjCmin in jD collision domain along the end to end 
path. The gain of change is calculated as follows:

As shown in Fig. 7, difference of flows of N2 on C2 and

the flow difference of any player on two max, min channels. 
Let Nn redirects one of its flow from Cmax to Cmin in any

V. 
CONVERGENCE TO  NASH EQUILIBRIUM 
In the previous section, we have proven that NE exists in 
a multi-radio multi-channel flow game with interference 
constraint in a non-cooperative environment. In this section 
we present a distributed algorithm running on each end node 
with imperfect information. As shown in Fig. 9, each player 
has information about each channel usage inside all collision 
domains but no player knows the strategy of her opponent 
players, thus a game of imperfect information.  
Using Algorithm 1, each player NnN selects channels 
for all its flows fn  f in each collision domain across the end 
to end path in a distributed manner.  Lines 5, 9, 13 and 17 of 
the algorithm are sufficient conditions where it converges 
and ends up with an NE. Furthermore, each node keeps a 
record of its channel usage, Cij_fnCount , in each collision 
domain for a necessary check at lines 9 and 14. Players in 
this game move simultaneously without having information 
about other players past histories. With this imperfect 
information, the game converges to stable NE in a non-
cooperative environment.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION  
In this section, we evaluate our proposed algorithm and 
show its results in terms of individual fairness and price of 
anarchy. In the second subsection, we investigate and 
compare the throughput difference of our scheme with a 
random channel selection scheme by varying the number of 
players. All the experiments were conducted in MATLAB 
to test the performance and effectiveness of the proposed 
scheme. 
A. Price of Anarchy  and Individual Fairness  
In this subsection, we investigate the Individual fairness 
of end user nodes and Price of Anarchy (PoA). We 
formulate the PoA as the ratio of throughput achieved by 
individual players in case of worst NE and best NE i-e

In the simulation, 40 nodes are deployed randomly in a 
rectangular area of 600X600 units. The transmission range 
is considered 50 units and interference range is taken as 
twice of the transmission range.  We configure 12 nodes on 
the left hand side of topology as players of the game. At the 
right hand side of the topology, 3 nodes are configured as 
the gateways. Each node generates 10 CBR flows of 
64Kbps during each run of the game.  Simulation was 
carried out by considering IEEE 802.11a [31], where 8 non-
overlapping channels were selected for parameter C across 5 
collision domains. Each node is configured with two radios, 
each for transmission and reception. All players move 
simultaneously having no information of one another past 
histories. With this imperfect information, we investigate 
the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of PoA. 
Since multiple NEs exist for this game, the mechanism for 
selecting the best NE by players is beyond the scope of this 
paper. We aim to solve this problem in a separate study. As 
shown in Fig. 10, the PoA is in the range of 0.71 and 1 for 
all the players. This shows a very strong indication that the 
individual throughput is not degraded even if the system 
converges to a worst NE. 
Fairness among players was measured at the end of the 
game. As shown in Fig. 11, individual players achieve end 
to end data rate with a standard deviation of 2.19Mbps, with 
imperfect information, at the end of the game. This shows 
that using our algorithm, players achieve fair end to end data 
rate across multiple collision domains when game converges 
to NE. The reason is that when the game ends up with NE, 
each player is playing its best response as its strategy to 
every other player of the game and hence has no incentive to 
deviate individually from its current strategy. We carried out 
simulation by considering the same set of parameters, where 
nodes deviate from the proposed algorithm with selfish 
behavior. As shown in Fig. 12, although some nodes 
perform better comparatively to our scheme by achieving 
high end to end throughput; the standard deviation is

3.74Mbps. This shows that some of the selfish nodes get 
access to less interfered channels while leaving the crowded 
channels for others. This selfish behavior leads to individual 
unfairness of the system as compared to the proposed 
scheme.  
B. Standard Deviation and Max-Min throughput Difference 
In second scenario, 100 nodes are deployed in a rectangular 
area of 1000X1000 units. The transmission range is taken 
25 units and the interference range as twice of the 
transmission range. Variance among players throughputs 
was measured by varying the set of players, N, from 5 to 40 
in 5 steps. Since the previous work done in this area is either

on selfish routing in wired networks or in wireless networks 
without considering multiple radio multiple channels in the 
core network. Therefore, we compared our proposed scheme 
with random channel selection where flows select channels 
across multiple collision domains arbitrarily. Fig. 13 
compares max-min throughput difference by using our 
scheme 
with 
random 
channel 
selection. 
Max-min 
throughput difference is the difference between the flow 
which gets maximum throughput and flow that gets 
minimum throughput, as in  Chen  et al.  [31]. It can be 
observed that our scheme outperforms random channel 
selection for each set of players by having minimum max-
min throughput difference. The max-min difference is 
higher for both systems at beginning but as the number of 
players increases max-min throughput difference of our 
proposed system either decreases or remains constant when 
the game ends up with NE. This shows the stability of our 
scheme at NE. The max-min throughput difference for 
random selection does not remain stable with varying 
number of players, as shown in Fig. 8. This is because some 
of the selfish end nodes, being rational, select less crowded 
channels across multiple collision domains and thus increase 
their end to end throughput while leaving more crowded 
channels for other nodes. 
Fig. 14 shows the standard deviation comparison of players 
throughputs in our proposed scheme against that of random 
selection. The values for collision domains (D), Channels 
(C), number of flows per node and CBR were kept same in 
both schemes while number of players/nodes was varied 
from 5 to 40 in step 5. Results in Fig. 14 suggest that our 
proposed scheme always performed better than random 
selection irrespective of the number of players. When 
number of nodes is low, some selfish players have always 
incentive to select less crowded channels across multiple 
collision domains and hence variance among players 
throughputs is high leading to high standard deviation. With 
increase in number of players, our proposed system shows a 
constant and predictable decrease in standard deviation while 
random selection scheme is unpredictable. This means that 
our proposed system achieves good fairness in long run 
when the system converges to NE.

VII. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have developed a multiple-collision 
domain MRMC game theoretic model based on end user 
flows in a non-cooperative environment. An interference 
constrained topology was considered due to the limited 
available orthogonal channels. Our analytical results have 
proven that Nash Equilibrium exists with proposed necessary 
conditions in a game of imperfect information.  Based on a 
distributed algorithm, our game theoretic model converges to 
stable state in finite time and all channels are perfectly load-
balanced at the end of the game. Simulation results show that 
standard deviation of players throughputs is less than that of 
random channel selection scheme in long run. Furthermore, 
the Price of Anarchy of the system is close to one showing 
the efficiency of the proposed scheme. 
We have considered single stage static game where 
players move simultaneously and once NE is established 
there is no incentive for any player to deviate from its current 
strategy, individually.  
The work done in this paper can be extended to 
incorporate routing along with channel assignment in a non-
cooperative 
environment 
by 
considering 
co-channel 
interference in the game formulation.  It can be an interesting 
future research direction to investigate the effect of the 
coalition of flows on the overall fairness of players in 
repeated games.  
In future, we are working to extend our proposed model 
to investigate the different mechanisms for selecting the best 
NE among the players. Further, we are working on coalition 
resistance game theoretic models for joint selfish routing and 
MRMC in multi-collision domain WMNs in an interference 
constraint non-cooperative environment.
