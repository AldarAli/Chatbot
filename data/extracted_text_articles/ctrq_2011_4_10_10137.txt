Abstract—Quality of Experience is a parameter used to express
the relationship between Quality of Service and the satisfaction
of network service subscribers. The modeling of Quality of
Experience demands for solving a multidimensional problem.
In this paper, we present a Quality of Experience analysis of
streaming videos. Related to this, we show that we can reduce the
dimensions of the Quality of Experience modeling with the help of
Principle Component Analysis techniques. We demonstrate that
for our data set the Zero Throughput Time and the Packet Delay
Variation are enough to get a picture of the state of the network.
We further calculate the Mahalanobis distance to analyze the
outliers in the data set. We illustrate that for our data set the
97.5 % quantile for the Mahalanobis distance is a good threshold
that indicates low user perception. We also advocate the use of
robust statistics in the analysis of Quality of Experience as we
are dealing with contaminated data sets.

I. INTRODUCTION
Quality of Experience (QoE) modeling is an important
aspect for understanding the impact of Quality of Service
(QoS) on service subscriber’s satisfactions. Current state of the
art QoE models are producing results that are approximately
able to forecast the QoE for mobile streaming videos. Yet, a
single highly effective metric for predicting the QoE in mobile
networks valid in any context is to be established. This paper’s
aim is to contribute to a better understanding of the QoE and
QoS relationship in 3rd Generation (3G) networks.
Linear weighting of QoS metrics has been popular in mea-
suring the QoE [1], [2], [3]. The input of these algorithms
are numerous QoS metrics that are collected during runtime
and are linearly weighted against each other to produce a QoE
estimate. The objective is to ﬁnd a single metric that can be
used to estimate the QoE. For this purpose, we introduce a
new metric to QoE modeling, the Mahalanobis distance [4].
The Mahalanobis distance is a distance metric that expresses
the distance of a measurement point to the center of a data set,
taking into account the correlation of data set. We employ the
Mahalanobis distance to compute a single value over multiple
QoS measurements that tells us how a particular data point is
related to the average state, i.e., the center of the data set, of the
network. We show that the Mahalanobis distance is correlated
to QoE even when computed over a subset of the measured
QoS metrics.
To analyze the efﬁciency of the Mahalanobis distance in
estimating the QoE we conducted a set of experiments where
users watched a video that was streamed over a 3G network
to a mobile device. The users rated the video on a scale
from 1 to 5 with regards to the image quality, as speciﬁed
by the ITU-T recommendation [5]. A different class of QoE
research employs traditional point-based metrics, e.g., Peak
Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Moving Pictures Quality Metric
(MPQM), or Mean Square Error (MSE), to assess the QoE of
video images [6]. The PSNR is computed by comparing the
original image before streaming and the actual image that was
displayed on the end user’s device. In contrast to PSNR, where
computer algorithms are used to evaluate the satisfaction, we
used humans to assess the video quality. This yields more
realistic User Ratings (URs) but also introduces more noise to
the measurement of the UR. Sources of noise originate from
the human behavior, e.g., delay in rating, human forget factor,
inaccurate rating.
We also demonstrate that the modeling can be simpliﬁed by
only using a subset of the available QoS metrics without loosing
much accuracy. We use Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
techniques to reduce the dimensionality of the QoS metrics.
Reducing the dimensionally of the QoS metrics simpliﬁes the
acquisition and reduces the computational efforts to prognos-
ticate the QoE.
Moreover, we advocate the use of robust statistical methods.
In our case the QoS data shows contaminated distributions. The
contaminated part is of particular interest as we show that the
low QoE ratings correspond to the contaminated part of the
data set. Classical statistics fail to identify this contamination
whereas robust statistics are designed to deal with anomalies
in data sets. By means of an example we demonstrate that
the Mahalanobis distance produces more accurate results with
robust methods compared to classical methods.
The paper is as follows; in section two, we elaborate on
the mathematical concepts that we use during the analysis of
our results, followed by an overview of the used QoS metrics.
Section three applies the Mahalanobis distance to our data set.
We discuss the distribution of the Mahalanobis distance, and
identify and model the outliers of our QoS metrics. Section
four brieﬂy explains the practical use of the Mahalanobis
distance in a real-time environment and we conclude in section
ﬁve with the conclusion and future work.

II. BACKGROUND
In this section, we provide an overview of the Mahalanobis
distance and provide an insight in the QoS metrics used for the
assessment of the QoE.
A. Mahalanobis Distance
Mahalanobis distance is a distance metric that expresses the
distance of a measurement point to the center of its data set
taking into account the data set’s correlation. The Mahalanobis
distance differs from the Euclidian distance in the use of the
correlation between the components of the data set.
The Mahalanobis distance is formally deﬁned as
DM(x) =
q
(x − µ)T S−1(x − µ)
(1)
where x = (x1, x2, . . . , xN) is a multivariate vector containing
a set of measurements, µ = (µ1, µ2, . . . , µN) is the center of
the data set and S is the covariance matrix of the data set.
It can be shown that if a data set is multinormal distributed
then the Mahalanobis distances of the data set are distributed
approximately as a chi-square distribution:
D2
M ∼ X 2
p ,
(2)
with p degrees of freedom [7].
We further observe that our data set is contaminated. In such
situations classical statistics yield biased estimates. To obtain
more accurate estimates we employ the Minimum Covariance
Determinant (MCD) algorithm to calculate the covariance ma-
trix. The fast MCD algorithm is a highly robust estimator of
multivariate location and scatter [8], [9]. In our paper, we
used the R implementation of MCD with alpha equal to
0.75 and default remaining parameters. This corresponds to a
breakdown point of 25 %, which ensures reasonable efﬁciency
and high robustness against outliers [10].
B. QoS Metrics
During our experiments we assessed the following ﬁve QoS
metrics: Packet Delay Variation (SD), Packet Rate (PR), Packet
Loss Rate (PL), Clumping Rate (CL), and Zero Throughput
Time (TZ). SD is calculated as
SD =
v
u
u
t
1
N − 1
" N
X
n=1
(D2n) − N ¯D2
#
,
(3)
where N is the number of received packets per interval, Dn the
one-way-delay of packet n, and ¯D the average one-way-delay.
CL is an indicator that detects clumped packets sequences. TZ
is the duration of no observance of throughput. Additionally
we count the number of packets, PR, and the packet loss, PL,
per second. The TZ, SD and CL are different metrics that
describe the variation in one-way-delays of packets. More
detailed descriptions of the presented QoS metrics can be found
in [11].
Before computing the Mahalanobis distances over the
QoS metrics we applied an Exponentially Weighted Moving
Average (EWMA) to the data set. The EWMA is used to address
the human forgetfulness factor and the delay in rating of the
objects under investigation. EWMA is deﬁned as
y(j) = (1 − α) x(j) + α y(j − 1),
(4)
where α is the smoothing factor. In previous research α = 0.75
yielded the most satisfying results [12]. Note that the EWMA
needs a warm-up time to become effective.
III. TESTBED SETUP
We set up a testbed to record URs together with QoS
metrics while streaming videos. We streamed a video from
a Darwin Streaming Server (DSS) [13] to a HTC Dream over
the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) [14]. The users
that participated in the experiment watched a video alone in
a darkened room and rated the quality of the video image
whenever he or she felt was appropriate by pushing one of
the ﬁve buttons on the screen.
The DSS is running on a Linux (2.6.27) Ubuntu 9.04 ma-
chine and streams a video MPEG-4 compressed with dimensions
176 × 144 pixels, 24 kHz AAC stereo sound, 23.97 fps, and
streamed at a rate of 325 kbps. The HTC Dream runs a custom
designed video streaming application on Android 1.5.
More detailed description of the testbed and how the mea-
surements are acquired refer to [15].
We collected data during forty minutes of video streaming
over a 3G network. A total number of 106 URs were recorded.
The ratings in relation to the ﬁve measured QoS metrics after
EWMA are analyzed.
IV. MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
We start the analysis of the QoS starts with the identiﬁcation
of the metrics that are most inﬂuential in the data set and
correlate most to the UR. Then we proceed to compute the
Mahalanobis distance over the selected metrics and analyze
its distribution. With this information we then try to model
the QoS metrics of concern and attempt to optimize the QoE
model.
A. Data set reduction
We ﬁrst look at the pairwise Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient
ρs(QoSi, QoSj) and place the values in the correlation matrix
SP . The correlation matrix (SP ) is presented in TABLE I.

that some QoS metrics correlate moderately ∼ 0.69 while
others show less correlation ∼ 0.42, or very low correlation.
In particular the PL seems to be a very poor estimate of
the UR, given its low correlation. As other QoS metrics show
better correlation among each other and the UR, a Principle
Component Analysis (PCA) is an appropriate technique to see
if the dimensionality of the data set can be reduced without
the loss of much information.

set where λ, the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix, are
proportional to the importance of the PC. The MCD algorithm
was also used to compute the covariance matrix for the
ROBPCA. We used the R implementation with alpha set to
0.75. Reducing the dimension is achieved by disregarding PCs.
A common selection criterion for PCs is
k

(5)
where ˜lj is the jth eigenvalue of the covariance matrix,
˜l1 ≥ ˜l2 ≥ . . . ≥ ˜lr with r = rank(S), and x is proportional
to the compression of the data set after PC reduction. ϕ in
TABLE II is the covariance matrix cumulative sum of the
relative eigenvalues of the data set. By keeping PC1 and PC2
from TABLE II we obtain x ≈ 90 %. The ﬁrst two PCs are
loaded, in order of signiﬁcance, by TZ, SD, PR, CL, and PL.
TZ seems to be the main contributor in PC1 and PR in PC2.
SD is the second largest contributor to variation in both PCs
and overall more inﬂuential than PR. Hence, the data set can be
described by TZ and SD with regards to its variation, given that
the loadings of TZ and SD are approximately 90 % and 35 %
of PC1 and PC2, with weights 0.712 and 0.195, respectively.
We observe that the n dimensions of the QoS data set can
be reduced while approximately maintaining variability. We
show that retaining only TZ and SD after dimension reduction
is appropriate. By using PCA techniques we concluded that
mainly TZ but also SD are the QoS metrics that best describe
the data set with regards to its variability.

B. Mahalanobis distance quantile analysis
We model the QoE with a reduced data set retaining the two
most inﬂuential QoS metrics on the variance of the data set, i.e.,
TZ and SD. The Mahalanobis distance distribution computed
over TZ and SD of the whole data set is shown in Figure 1.
This ﬁgure shows a Q-Q plot where the rated data points are
colored to their UR. Red is a bad rating, whereas green is
an excellent rating. The Mahalanobis distance distribution is
plotted against a theoretical X distribution with two degrees
of freedom.
The Q-Q plot of the reduced data set against the theoretical
X2 disribution starts of as it seems linearly but it diverges at a
given point. The Mahalanobis distance shows approximately
linear relationship with a X2 distribution when the data set of
concern is multinormal distributed. We analyze the distribution
of TZ and SD in more detail later on. We can now observe
that their distribution is contaminated, which, in particular,
gives rise to the tail. The contamination is manifested in the
Q-Q plot through divergence of the quantile equality line (the
dashed line in Figure 1). We observe that the bad and poor
URs correspond to the tail of the distributions, and they are
separated from the main body of the distribution. Therefore
the distribution can be modeled as being contaminated, where
the measurement points in the tail are part of a contamination
distribution and considered to be anomalies or outliers of the
QoS average behavior. The contaminated part is of particular
interest as this is an indicator of poor satisfaction.
C. Mahalanobis Distance Tolerance
Given that the squared Mahalanobis distance is approx-
imately X 2
p=2 distributed, points larger than √
X 2
p,0.975 can
theoretically be considered as outliers [7]. To get a better
insight we construct a set of vectors in R2 that deﬁne the
97.5 % tolerance ellipse on the TZ-SD plane based on the

rated data points. This corresponds to the theoretical χ2 dis-
tribution’s 97.5 % quantile. The tolerance ellipse is shown
in Figure 2. The ﬁgure shows the tolerance ellipse obtained
with classical statistics and with robust statistical methods.
The robust location estimation of the data set is depicted
with the black crosshair, the blue crosshair is the center as
speciﬁed by classical statistics. It is clear that the classical
tolerance ellipse is inﬂated toward the outliers of, mostly, TZ.
The robust ellipse seems to cope well with the outliers. The
robust estimation of the center (47.61, 46.98) focuses on the
major mass center of the data set, in contrast to the classical
center estimation (260.52, 45.57). The estimation of location
for SD is approximately the same for both methods but the TZ
is 547.19 % overestimated by the classical method compared
to the robust one.
When we analyze the consistency of the URs inside the
tolerance ellipse and outside we observe that inside the ellipse
mostly 5 and 4 ratings are located. Outside the ellipse, the
lower ratings reside. UR 3 seems to be mostly inside the
tolerance ellipse. We do not observe a tendency of the URs
distribution in these two areas. After interviewing the humans
under investigation we observed that the streamed videos were
mostly of satisfying quality, and when poor performance was
noticed the satisfaction was very bad. In other words, the
users perceived a reasonably good service, or a quite bad
service, and rarely something in between. This is translated in
a binary satisfaction, where the service perceived is either good
(contraction of URs excellent and good) or bad (contraction of
URs poor and bad). We can simulate such behavior by the use
of the tolerance ellipse, namely inside the ellipse good service
is perceived and outside bad one is perceived.

horizontal dashed line is the √
X 2
p,0.975 cutoff at 2.72. The good
and excellent-rated measurement points above the cutoff are
numbered. We observe that 91 % of the URs above 3 are under
the cutoff and 97 % of the URs under 3 are captured by the
√
X 2
p,0.975 cutoff. As a result 9 % of good URs are located in
the outlier area, i.e., points 3, 1075, 1154, 1354, and 1795.
68.75 % of the fair ratings are below the cutoff line. Ideally
we want a clear separation between good and bad ratings.
Possible causes why this is not the case is improper rating of
the objects of concern or caused by the smoothing effect of the
EWMA. The latter effect can be diminished by using a smaller α
in equation 4. Yet, altering α also affects other measurement
points. In the case of our measurements, α = 0.75 yields
optimum results. Only one value rated under 3 falls under the
cutoff. Reasons for this are similar to the previous case.
E. Contamination of TZ & SD
The √
X 2
p,0.975 cutoff divides our data set in two parts. The
data points representing the network conditions yielding good
user perceptions lie below the cutoff; above the cutoff are the
outliners, indicators of unstable network conditions. With this
information, we can model the TZ and SD as contaminated
time series. The conventional model of contaminated data is
given by
F = (1 − ε) G0 + ε H,
(6)
where ε ∈ [0, 0.5] is the degree of contamination, G0 is the
model distribution and H is the contaminating distribution. ε
must be smaller than 0.5 because this is the limit where the
contamination would become the model distribution and visa
versa. The model in equation 6 can be applied to our QoS met-
rics where the data points below the cutoff are of distribution
G0 and the data point above the cutoff of distribution H. ε is
deﬁned to be the ratio of data points above the cutoff over the
total number of data points, in our experiment ε = 0.137.

Figures 4 and 5 show the Probability Distribution Function
(PDF) of TZ and SD, respectively. The black line is the PDF
of the measured metrics, F in equation 6. The dashed red
line corresponds to G0 (the model distribution) and the blue
dashed line is the identiﬁed contamination, i.e., H.
The contamination of TZ in Figure 4 covers the tail of the F
distribution. The model distribution G0 ﬁts well the body of F
as only minor contamination is present. This suggests that the
tail of TZ can be an estimator for the QoE. The contamination
H of SD at the other hand is mixed in the whole distribution.
Similar to TZ, the contamination accounts for most of the tail
and in the case of SD also the head of F. H is considerable
more present in the body of SD than compared to TZ. For the
SD it is impossible to identify the contamination merely on
the basis of F.
When applying the √
X 2
p,0.975 cutoff we assumed approxi-
mate multinormal distribution. The Anderson-Darling normal-
ity test on G0 of TZ and SD does not yield results in favor
of the normality hypothesis. Both data sets reveal positive
skewness, which is larger for SD than for TZ. A larger data
set helps to clarify the normality hypothesis. Yet, we showed
that the Mahalanobis distance is an effective estimate for QoE.
V. QOE ANALYSIS DURING RUNTIME
The Mahalanobis distance in the above analysis was com-
puted ofﬂine after the experiments took place. Employing
the Mahalanobis distance analysis during runtime implies
the computation of the S matrix and the center of the data
during runtime. For performance reasons this is not desirable,
especially on devices with scarce resources such as hand-
held devices. The Mahalanobis distance computation can be
simpliﬁed by using a predeﬁned S matrix and µ vector. The
computation of the Mahalanobis distance is then reduced to
the multiplication of a matrix, and two vectors. The accuracy
of the Mahalanobis distance estimates are consequently depen-
dent on the selected S and µ. These values must be computed
on a network with a QoS that yields good QoE most of the time.
S and µ might differ for different Internet access technologies
and should be studied separately before merging.
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we focused on the use of the Mahalanobis
distance for the user satisfaction estimation of streaming
video services. We showed with the help of Mahalanobis dis-
tance that there is an approximate binary relationship between
QoS and QoE in 3G networks. We also showed that we can
reduce the dimensions of the QoS metrics to two, without
loosing much information. Of the QoS metrics measured in
our experiments, TZ and SD are the metrics that best describe
the data set with regards to its variation.
We also showed by example that robust statistical methods
yield far better and reliable results than classical statistical
methods. Robust statistical methods are able to handle out-
liers better than classical methods. In our data set, we are
particularly interested in outliers, thus appropriate statistical
methods are of great importance.
Future work includes the generalization of the Mahalanobis
distance method in QoE modeling. We have shown that for
the case of streaming over 3G networks, the Mahalanobis
distance seems to be a good indicator of user satisfaction.
Studies of different Internet access technologies and services
will shed light on the Mahalanobis’ distance generalized
applicability.
Also, an optimized cutoff might yield better results and it
is subject for future work. A larger data set than used in our
paper is necessary to obtain more signiﬁcant statistical results.
A hysteresis approach to the binary modeling is also a good
