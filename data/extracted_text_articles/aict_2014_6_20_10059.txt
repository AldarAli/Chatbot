Abstract—Fuzzy logic is used in various areas such as economics,
train systems, smart home systems, telecommunications. Recently,
fuzzy logic has attracted researchers working in cognitive radio
networks (CRNs). In this paper, we introduce a method that uses
fuzzy logic to combine observed factors of the wireless environ-
ment (e.g., area overlapping and primary receivers density) to
estimate interference level to primary receivers. The computed
results reﬂect the precise impact that may be induced when a
cognitive radio communication is operating nearby. This impact
envisages the effects of CRNs over primary receivers. It can also
be used as a routing metric that helps to choose the route with
minimal impact - lowest interference level - to primary receivers.
Keywords–Cognitive radio; fuzzy logic; routing metric; interfer-
ence avoidance.
I.
INTRODUCTION
In a Cognitive Radio Network (CRN), a cognitive radio
node (CR) makes decisions based on its own observed in-
formation even though these knowledge may be incomplete.
Fuzzy logic, however, can yield useful outputs with incomplete
approximate and vague information (e.g., low or high inter-
ference, sufﬁcient or not sufﬁcient available radio resources).
Furthermore, fuzzy logic does not require too complicated
computation since the calculation is mostly based on If-then-
else rules. Hence, we can use fuzzy logic in real-time cognitive
radio applications for which the response time is crucial to the
system performance [1]. Due to its simplicity, ﬂexibility, and
if-then-else rules composition, fuzzy logic processing time is
minor.
Fuzzy logic introduces a logic theory that was developed
to generalise ‘true’ and ‘false’ values to any value between 0
and 1 [2]. It also presents the approximate knowledge which
may be difﬁcult to express by conventional crisp method (i.e.,
bivalent set theory).
A fuzzy logic system with two inputs and one output is
described in Figure 1. The fuzzy sets are sets of unsharp
boundaries objects in which the membership is a matter of
degree (in range of 0 to 1). For instance, a fuzzy set of
weekend may contain half of Friday, Saturday and Sunday
and a set of weekdays may contain from Monday to ﬁrst
half of Friday. So, Friday can be existing in both sets with
distinctive degrees. To identify the degree of these variables, a
membership function is used to reason the related information.
The membership function assigns a value in the interval [0, 1]
to a fuzzy variable and denotes as µ(weekend(day)), where
weekend is a fuzzy set, and day is a fuzzy variable.
Input crisp values are fuzziﬁed to produce appropriate
linguistic values according to deﬁned membership functions.
Figure 1: General fuzzy logic system
Then, the inference engine will extract the associated outputs
based on the deﬁned rules. These outputs are fuzziﬁed based
on output membership functions. Finally, fuzziﬁed outputs are
aggregated into a single crisp value by the defuzziﬁer.
In the previous articles [3] [4], we showed that reception
overlapping associated with the interference could impact the
primary radio (PR) receivers. However, we also noticed the
case where node density also contributed to the impact. It is
worth mentioning that we only consider non-zero overlapping
situation since zero overlapping does not impact to the primary
network.
The output can be used to investigate how the routing layer
reacts and makes the right decisions to maximise spectrum
resources while avoiding interference to the primary receivers.
For instance, a CR can operate within an area having high
overlap size but low operating primary receivers. We apply
fuzzy logic to determine the overlap size and the probability
of operating primary receivers (e.g., low or high). We also
introduce in details the methodology of Mamdani inference
system so that the audiences can easily follow the proposed
solution.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section II
presents some recent work related to fuzzy logic applications.
Our basic implementation is then discussed in Section III.
The advance implementations in Cognitive Radio Networks
(CRNs) context is presented in Section IV. We conclude the
work with some future directions in Section V.

RELATED WORK
Many fuzzy logic based solutions have been proposed.
For instance, fuzzy-decision based routing was introduced in
[5] for MANET. It was developed on top of the classical
Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol in order to achieve
the fairness of all the routing input metrics and prioritize the
services differentiated packet routing, i.e., to route packets
138

based on QoS priority. Wong et al. [5] proposed a routing
protocol based on fuzzy decision engine that supports service
differentiation and quality of service (e.g., routing protocol
with service engineering or service-based routing in MANET).
Rea et al. [6] used fuzzy logic to instruct route caching
during path exploration process to ensure that only the quality
routes are cached in DSR. The solution also uses hop count as
one of the metrics similarly to [7]. Furthermore, it uses link
strength and energy available at a link vertex as fuzzy inputs.
The outcome is whether a path in a route request is cached
or not and continue with a route request rebroadcast. Though
the solution at that stage was still not completely dealing with
changes of the wireless environment, applying fuzzy theory in
ad-hoc routing is convincing.
Chiang and Wang [8] used fuzzy logic to optimize routing
path in a distributed manner. The objective of the proposed pro-
tocol is to minimize resource energy consumption in order to
lengthen the lifetime of the sensor network. Since fuzzy logic
is a system based on a conditional statements rule, resources
consumption was reduced as expected in this proposal.
Santhi et al. [9] applied fuzzy logic to combine different
QoS criteria to produce a routing metric. Ad-hoc mobile node
uses this metric to predict and choose the most stable but least
cost path to reach the destination. Similar approach can be used
in CRNs but we have to consider the surrounding‘s changes
that affect the routing decision as well as routing performance,
such as the resource availability and operation interference on
the legacy primary systems.
In CRN design development, Baldo et al. [10] suggested
to use fuzzy logic in controlling transmitting power of the
CR devices while it co-exists with PR devices. Le et al. [11]
proposed a design of network accessing scheme based on fuzzy
logic. Fuzzy logic was used to combine multiple feedbacks of a
device on network performance such as delay, throughput and
reliability. The output of the network selection outperformed
conventional scheme on choosing an access based on a single
parameter.
Masri et al. [12] proposed a strategy that used fuzzy logic
to compose multiple independent environment parameters for
multihop routing in CRNs. They accounted for instantaneous
variations of the environment and proved that channel selection
must be part of routing decision jointly with MAC layer
support. In this work, we aim to extend the work described
in [12] by adding impact factors that are derived from the
environment observation. The solution proposes a metric that
could guarantee the minimal impact to the primary system
when it coexists with the secondary system.
III.
BASIC IMPLEMENTATION AND RESULTS
We argue that when reception area of a CR emitter and
reception area of a PR emitter overlap, it produces unavoidable
effects on the primary system, especially to the PR receivers.
This observation was mentioned in [3]. However, we also
proved that not only the overlap size but also the number of
existing primary receivers cause the impact [4]. In this work,
our approach takes into account the overlap ratio and node
density probability as two main factors. The ratio of the overlap
size over the overall size of the PR emitter’s disk, named
overlap ratio while node density probability is the probability
of possible node density within this PR emitter’s disk.
We hence choose overlap ratio and node density probability
to be the fuzzy inputs of our fuzzy inference system. Each
of these two variables is composed of two fuzzy sets, i.e.,
Low and High. The fuzzy output variable is the interference
level that is also a fuzzy set containing two fuzzy variables
Low and High. A proper implication would be applied for
each rule listed in the rules table. Result from implication rule
is then aggregated and defuzziﬁed to obtain the ﬁnal result.
This is the degree of impact on the primary system. A CR
can consider this degree before using a frequency range when
overlap happens.
A. Overlap Ratio Fuzzy Sets
Ratio of an overlap area to reception zone of an emitter is
taken as the fuzzy input variable. To make it simple and easy
to understand, we ﬁrst deﬁne two simple fuzzy sets Low and
High that represent the overlap ratio state. Low set contains all
values that indicate the low overlap ratio. For instance, overlap
ratio is considered low when it is less than 50%, otherwise, it
is considered high. Note that, speciﬁc low and high boundaries
are not precisely deﬁned. We can have different deﬁnitions of
low and high. We are declaring the simplest possibility in this
context. It is said to be 100% low when the ratio is exactly from
0 to 20%. From 20% to further (e.g., 50%), the possibility of
being low hence decreases while the possibility of being high
increases. We describe the membership functions of these sets
in trapezoidal or triangular-shape. Overlap ratio membership
functions are described in equations (1) and (2).

To interpret the output of antecedents (i.e., the overlap
ratio), we use Mamdani Min Implication rules [2] to extract
the ﬁnal result for the overlap ratio fuzzy set. For instance, at

intersection part of two functions, an or operator is used to
connect two sets, the maximum of two membership functions
is evaluated for the antecedent part of the fuzzy rules.
µOverlapRatio(x) = µLow(x) ∨ µHigh(x)
= max[µLow(x), µHigh(x)]
(3)
B. Node Density Fuzzy Sets
Similarly to Overlap Ratio sets, we also deﬁne two simple
fuzzy sets Low and High in order to reﬂect how PR receivers
are scattered within an area. The characteristics of the mobile
receivers are discrete, independent and randomly distributed.
Therefore, the distribution of the nodes in this context is
assumed to follow Poisson distribution. The expected density
value X yields from Grey Model [4]. Since the node density
appearance is a mutual independent event occurring at a known
and constant rate r per unit (of time or space) are observed
through a certain window (a unit of time or space), it follows
the principle of Poisson distribution.
From the historical data (i.e., the input series for Grey
Model), we can compute the possible average density m that
represents the estimated rate λ. The probability the area has at
most X receivers within an area unit is the Poisson accumulate
density function of P(X ≤ x) illustrated in (III-B),
P(X ≤ x) = e−λ Px
i=0 λi
i!
Higher probability of predicted density is, higher chance
the receivers get impact. We consider that the low value of
P(x) belongs to fuzzy set Low and the other belongs to fuzzy
set High. The membership functions of Node Density are also
presented in a trapezoid-shape similarly to Overlap Ratio fuzzy
sets
C. Fuzzy Process for Overlap and Node Density sets
Since Overlap ratio and Node Density are two indepen-
dent entities with different properties and characteristics, we
combine these two sets using a rules table. Output of the
combination represents the interference level (e.g., Low or
High level of interference) to the primary system under speciﬁc
overlap degree µOverlapRatio(ratio) and primary receiver den-
sity degree - deﬁned as µDensity(Px). The interference level
is used to foresee how much impact primary receiver would
be tolerated, density of these nodes are hence prioritized in
this rules table (Table I).

The rules table is expressed in the If-then construct. For
instance, if both the overlap ratio and the density are Low,
interference level is Low. However, interference level is Low
when overlap ratio is High and the density is How. This
explains the case where we have big overlap and low receivers
operating in the emitter’s reception zone. The statement if-part

of the rule is called antecedent or premise, while the then-part
of the rule is called consequence or conclusion. In this context,
the premises are the overlap ratio and the density degree, while
the consequence is the interference level. The consequence is
also a fuzzy set. We deﬁne the fuzzy sets of interference level
in Figure 3.

In general, the inputs to these rules are the current values of
overlap and density degrees and the output would be the entire
fuzzy set of interference level (e.g., Low or High set). This

set is then defuzziﬁed that assigns a single value to indicate
the interference ratio. The mapping is done from-left-to-right
ﬂows as shown in Figure 4 [13]. The graphical view of the
interference level according to the overlap ratio and the node
density is presented in Figure 5.

Table II represents the numerical data after fuzziﬁcation
and defuzziﬁcation process of Overlap Ratio fuzzy sets. Ratio
is the overlap ratio of overlap region to the emitter reception
zone. This is the fuzzy input of fuzziﬁcation process to map
this value to the linguistic variables Low and High. Fuzzy
logic controller (FLC) uses the membership functions deﬁned
in Figure 2 to fuzzify the input ratio. µ(x)Low and µ(x)High
present the fuzziﬁed values obtained from equations (1) and
(2) respectively. For example, at index 2 input ratio that
equals 0.25534 is interpreted as 81.56% Low and 1.07% High
according to the membership functions deﬁned in Figure 2.
These outputs are evaluated as 81.56% low overlap (e.g.,
columns µ(x) Overlap Ratio and Overlap Degree) by Mamdani
Min Implication in equation (3).

The same processes are done and presented in Table III.
Density degree and overlap degree are composed by applying
Larsen implication rule with the rule explained in Table I.
Low overlap ratio combined with low density probability would
result a low interference level. Defuzziﬁed value of this result
is produced by multiplying the crisp values of overlap ratio and
density probability. Table IV shows the ﬁnal output result after
aggregating the two fuzzy sets Overlap Degree and Density
Degree. We can see that if overlap is low and density degree
is low, interference level is hence low (ﬁrst row of the table in
Table IV). Crisp value column represents defuzziﬁed output of
overlap and density degree sets. Interference level is at 79.6%
low when overlap degree is 100% low and density degree is
79.6% low for instance at index 1. The corresponding outputs
of overlap and density degree antecedents are presented in
Table II and Table III.

With this simple approach, we can see that interference
level depends on the predicted density degree. However, it pro-
vides the glimpse of considering overlap and density for better
protecting primary receivers in CRNs. Moreover, considering
binary variables as Low and High is not sufﬁcient enough
to evaluate how interference level is good enough to make a
judgement when it comes to path selection. Clearly, the rule
table as well as the outcome of the defuzziﬁcation process does
not reﬂect any impact of the overlap size. A middle level of
impact may happen due to low overlap even with high density
receivers. An extension of this approach is hence introduced
brieﬂy below. This enhances overlap and density fuzzy sets,
as well as reﬁnes rules table, accordingly.

ADVANCE INTERFERENCE LEVEL IMPLEMENTATION
A. Extended Overlap Ratio Fuzzy Sets
As explained, we need more elaborate deﬁnition for the
input of FLC that covers all possible cases of the over-
lap and density effects. We redesigned the input fuzzy sets
that now contain four linguistics variables Ofuzzyset
=
{low, medium, high, veryhigh} in which, for example, the
overlap ratio:
•
low : 0 < Aoverlap
AP
≤
3
10
•
medium :
2
10 < Aoverlap
AP
≤
5
10
•
high :
4
10 < Aoverlap
AP
≤
7
10
•
veryhigh : Aoverlap
AP
>
6
10
We consider that the overlap ratio is low when the ratio is
from 0 to 10%. The membership function of low overlap ratio
reﬂects the degree of low overlapping which follows the idea
of the possibility that overlap is lower and lower after 10%
of overlap. The possibility of low overlap decreases when the
ratio increases. Other possibilities could be medium or high
overlap after a speciﬁc boundary. For instance, the input value
of an overlap ratio is at 25%, the probability of it to low is
25%. Moreover, the probability of it to medium is 33%. We
can conclude that the input may be possibly at medium overlap
degree.
Figure 6: Enhanced Overlap Ratio membership function.
B. Extended Node Density Fuzzy Sets
Applying the same principle in IV-A, we deﬁne four
linguistic variables corresponding to four fuzzy sets Low,
141
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2014.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-360-5
AICT2014 : The Tenth Advanced International Conference on Telecommunications

Medium, High and Very High. Assume that density of the
receivers is deﬁned as dr =
N
AP .
where N, the total number of receivers within the reception
zone of an emitter, AP the total area size of the zone.
Therefore, within a speciﬁc area A0, the average number of
receivers is navg = dr ∗ A0.
As a node existence is independent from the others within
an area, the probability of x nodes which exist within A0
follows Poisson process with mean λ = navg is yield by (4)
following the Poisson density function.
f(x) = P(X = x) = λx
x! e−λ
(4)
The probability the area has more than the average number
of receivers within A0 is the Poisson accumulate density func-
tion of P(X ≥ x) with x ≥ λ becomes P(X ≥ x) = e−λ(eλ)x
xx
Figure 7: Enhanced Node Density membership function.
Practically, we can have a prediction system that generates
the node density. However, in the context of this paper,
the value is generated via a Poisson process. This value is
converted into an appropriate linguistic value via the fuzzy
logic controller. The membership function of this fuzzy set
follows the deﬁnition from the overlap membership function
above as described in Figure 7.
C. Interference Level Rules and Outputs
As the inputs are reﬁned, the output of this enhanced
inference system is also reﬁned. A proposed rule table for these
fuzzy sets is deﬁned in table V, note that the rules subject to
feasibly change depending on realistic observation later. As
we could see, with the simple approach in section III, the
rules illustrate only two states of the interference level, low
or high. However, we introduced two more variables of reach
input fuzzy sets (medium and veryhigh), the rules should
also reﬂect the changes associated with these variables.
Practically, the level of interference can be at a reasonable
degree such as medium. Based on application needs, the level
could be adapted accordingly.
For instance, the above rules infer the followings.

Figure 8: Enhanced Interference Level membership function.
The fuzzy inference engine combines the rules to obtain
the aggregated fuzzy output. The output is the fuzzy set of the
interference level that is deﬁned in Figure 8. Fuzzy controller
has to defuzzify these outputs into crisp values using centroid
method to make the ﬁnal decisions. Figure 9 shows the system
output as a function of 2 variables, overlap ratio and node
density, with the rules set of 16 conditional statements.
Table VI and Table VII show the fuzziﬁed data of the
inputs based on their deﬁned membership functions. We can
observe that the crisp values are converted into linguistic values
thanks to the membership functions in Figure 6 and Figure 7.

Precisely, FLC maps the fuzziﬁed outputs (a.k.a. the output
of each linguistic variable of overlap ratio and node density
probability) of the inputs to infer the associated consequences.
For instance, the inference engine decomposes an input of
overlap ratio of 0.25596 into µ(low) at 0.29362 and input
of density probability of 0.08049 into µ(low) at 1. This
composition matches the ﬁrst rule in Table V - If (Overlap-
Ratio is Low) or (Density-Ratio is Low), then (Interference
Level is Low).
Depending on the method that we deﬁned at the beginning,
the consequence of these antecedents is calculated and mapped
to the membership functions of the interference level fuzzy
set. With this current example, we opt to use Min implication
method to evaluate the outcome, and compute the interference
output is at 0.14236 for this rule. However, this is not yet the
ﬁnal outcome since after matching all the possible fuzziﬁed
inputs with the rule knowledge, all the outcomes are decom-
posed/defuzziﬁed to produce a single crisp value (refers to the
diagram in Figure 4). This will be the ﬁnal output of the whole
process.

density are two critical inputs of the fuzzy system. Convincing
numerical results conﬁrm the feasibility of using fuzzy logic
in Cognitive Radio Networks for estimating interference. The
decision making process can leverage this information when a
CR selects a possible accessing channel that minimizes the im-
pact on the primary system. Moreover, the estimation can also
be used in extracting a routing metric that considers a path with
minimal interference level. In cross-layer design, this approach
can also be integrated with other factors such as transmitting
power and application requirements for engineering the trafﬁc
ﬂow accordingly.
