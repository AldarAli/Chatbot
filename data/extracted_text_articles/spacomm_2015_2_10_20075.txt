Abstract - This paper describes a recent effort in characterizing 
the weather conditions at the Canberra Deep Space 
Communications Complex of the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration (NASA) Deep Space Network (DSN) to 
assess how they could impact the data return of the New 
Horizons mission during the Pluto encounter period.  The 
frequency of rain occurrence is quantified based on recent 
2014 
statistics. 
 
The 
cumulative 
distribution 
of 
the 
precipitation rate during the rain events and the corresponding 
signal degradation are studied.  The result is then evaluated 
against the anticipated link margin for two possible tracking 
configurations: one with a single 70m antenna, the other with 
an array of a 70m and three 34m antennas.   The array offers a 
more robust link with greater margin, thus, a better protection 
against possible rain degradation; however, it would negatively 
impact other missions that require DSN support over the same 
period.  The determination of possible improvement in terms 
of increased probability of data return offered by the antenna 
arraying helps selecting a strategy that best balances the 
benefit to the New Horizons mission and the impact to other 
missions concurrently supported by the DSN.

INTRODUCTION 
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
(NASA) New Horizons mission is preparing for a historic 
encounter with the dwarf planet Pluto in July 2015.  Since 
this is a once in a lifetime event, the mission design team 
wants to maximize the success probability of data return.  A 
few weeks prior to the actual encounter on July 14, 2015, 
there will be several tracking passes that are critical to 
mission planning.  These passes return the optical 
navigation data on possible hazardous objects around Pluto 
that are critical to the trajectory design of the flyby.  There 
are also a few tracking passes immediately after the flyby 
that return the important scientific observation data.   
To maximize the probability of data return over the 
scheduled passes to ensure the timeliness of trajectory 
design, the New Horizons mission is interested in 
quantifying if there is sufficient link margin to cover the 
adverse weather conditions.  Rains – particularly the heavy 
ones – would reduce the received signal quality.   In rainy 
condition, the signal to noise ratio is reduced by 
simultaneous effects of signal attenuation caused by the 
absorption and scattering of the raindrops, and of the 
increase in the ground system noise temperature.  
In the previous baseline operation, the New Horizons 
mission plans to use the 70m antenna for the return of data.  
To get additional link margin, the mission could request for 
other 34m antennas to be added for arraying with the 70m.  
Doing so however would take away the tracking antennas 
needed by other missions.  It is important then to understand 
if there is significant advantage with the array that would 
justify the negative impact to other missions. 
In this paper, we will address the following questions:  
(1) What is the probability of encountering the rain?  
(2) In the event of rain, what is the likelihood that the 
signal degradation would exceed the available link 
margin?  
(3) Would the extra gain from the array significantly 
improve the probability of a successful data return? 
In Section II, we will discuss the available link margin 
for single antenna and the extra gain provided by the array.  
We will examine the statistics of events where rains affect 
the data return and quantify the probability that a pass may 
encounter rains in Section III. Section IV discusses the 
relationship between the precipitation rate (which is an 
indication on the intensity of the rain) and the signal 
degradation.  Section V considers the statistics of 
precipitation rate observed in past rain events, assesses the 
probability where the link margin can sustain the signal 
degradation, and reflects the resulting operational planning 
under consideration.  Conclusions are captured in Section 
VI. 
II. 
AVAILABLE LINK MARGIN 
The DSN has three tracking complexes spread evenly 
across the Earth longitudes in order to maintain a constant 
visibility to spacecraft in deep space.  The three complexes 
are known as Goldstone, Canberra and Madrid Deep Space 
Communications Complexes, based on the its location in the 
United States, Australia and Spain.   Each complex has a 
70m antenna, one 34m high efficiency (HEF) antenna and at 
least 
two 
34m 
beam-waveguide 
(BWG) 
antennas 
(Goldstone complex has one additional 34m BWG antenna).  
The distinction of the HEF vs. BWG antennas is due to their 
design and performance since the two sets of antennas were 
constructed at different time and with different technology 
31

and operations considerations.  The HEF antenna offers a 
better signal performance because its design is optimized at 
X-band, but its support is limited to S- and X-band.  The 
BWG design focuses mainly on X- and Ka-band, and offers 
other operational advantages such as the ease of 
maintenance and addition of other frequency bands as 
needed. 
For the Pluto flyby operation, the New Horizons mission 
plans to have a reserved 1.5 dB link margin with the 70m 
antenna tracking.  Arraying the 70m with other 34m 
antennas would add additional margin. Each 34m antenna 
has a slightly less than half of the antenna aperture and a 
higher zenith system noise temperature than that of the 70m 
antenna.  Since the system noise temperature changes as a 
function of elevation – due to different amount of 
atmospheric noise contribution resulted from different path 
length that the signal travels through the Earth atmosphere – 
the relative performance metric of Gain over Noise 
Temperature (G/T) between the 34m and the 70m antennas 
varies over the elevation range of the pass. Table 1 shows 
the G/T of the 70m, 34m HEF and 34m BWG at some key 
elevation points.    
TABLE I.  
G/T PERFORMANCE OF VARIOUS DSN ANTENNAS AND 
CONTRIBUTION OF 3X34M ARRAY TO THE 70M ANTENNA 
 
 
At the referenced 45 deg elevation, the 34m antenna G/T is 
about 20% of the G/T of the 70m antenna.  An array of the 
70m and three 34m antennas (one HEF and two BWGs) 
would yield 61% improvement in G/T compared to that of 
the 70m antenna alone.  Allowing for 0.1 dB loss due to 
imperfect estimation and thus compensation of the relative 
delays among the input signals to be combined, the array 
would add 1.95 dB gain to the original 1.5 dB link margin 
of the 70m antenna. At other elevations, the array gain is 
higher, extending up to 2.4 dB at the lower elevation of 10 
deg.  Thus, with the array configuration, the link would have 
a minimum of 3.4 dB margin. 
III. 
RAIN STATISTICS  
In this section, we examine the rain statistics observed at 
the DSN sites. Among the three sites, Canberra typically has 
more rain [1]. Thus, assessment on the rain impact is based 
on Canberra data. 
Records of Canberra tracking passes during January – 
November 2014 indicated that there were 37 events of rain 
that affect the data return.  The majority was associated with 
data loss; however, some just resulted in signal degradation 
without data loss.  The total data affected was 6871 minutes 
over a 10-month period, equated to 1.6% of the time.  The 
probability of a tracking pass affected by the rain is thus 
only 1.6%. 
Since the Pluto Flyby will occur on July 14, 2015 and the 
critical passes under consideration take place in June – July 
2015, there is a concern on whether the weather conditions 
during these two months are different from, or worse than, 
the average statistics.  Table 2 shows the long-term 
averaged precipitation measured at the nearby Tidbinbilla 
Reserve [2].  July is typically considered as one of the 
rainier months.   
TABLE II.  
TYPICAL PRECIPITATION AT TIDBINDILLA NEARBY 
CANBERRA TRACKING COMPLEX 
 
 
Next we examine at the rain statistics specifically in the 
past year of 2014 to further validate the long-term averages. 
Figure 1 shows the actual the day of year when the 37 rain 
events occurred and their duration in January – November 
2014.  The rain impact lasted from a few minutes to up to 10 
hours, with an average duration of about 3 hours (185 
minutes).  The data also indicated that June and July were 
not particularly rainier compared to other months. Instead, 
the rains seemed to occur throughout the year, although with 
less rain in March and May. 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Rain Occurrence at Canberra Complex, January-November 2014 
 
The recent rain observations in 2014 for the month of 
July is different from the long-term average shown in Table 
2.  We attribute the difference to be a variation of one 
specific year from the long-term average. 
IV. 
SIGNAL DEGRADATION MODEL 
As indicated in Section III, the chance of having a track 
coincides with a rain event is rather small (1.6%).  However, 
if the track happens to be on a rainy day, we want to know 
the probability that the link margin can buffer the negative 
effect of the rain.   
As signal travels through the rain, two effects occur.  
First, signal is attenuated because of scattering and 
absorption of signal power by the raindrops. The scattering 
diffuses the signal power.  The absorption - due to a 
32

resonance between the signal waveform and the vibration of 
water molecules - also draws the power away from the 
signal and transfers it to the increased motion of the water 
molecules. These effects become greater as there are more 
raindrops in heavier rains. Based on the Recommendation 
ITU-R P.838-3, Specific Attenuation Model for Rain for 
Use in Prediction Methods [3], the signal specific 
attenuation – attenuation per unit distance (dB/km) – can be 
modeled as a power function of the precipitation rate: 
𝛾(𝑅) = 𝑘𝑅!                                     (1) 
where: 
 𝛾 is the specific attenuation (dB/km) 
𝑅 is the precipitation rate (mm/h) 
𝑘 = 0.0037825 (for circular polarization at X-band) 
𝛼 = 1.38557 (for circular polarization at X-band) 
The total attenuation is equal to the specific attenuation 
multiplied by the path length that the signal traverses 
through the rain.  Assuming a height of rain cloud of ℎ and a 
spacecraft line of sight at 𝜃 elevation, the signal attenuation 
path length 𝐿 can be approximated as: 
𝐿(𝑅) =
! ! .!
!"# !                                     (2) 
In addition to the signal attenuation, the rain also causes 
an increase in the system noise temperature.  This is due to 
the fact that the temperature of the rain (~300K) is much 
higher than that of typical cold sky (~25K) and the rain also 
acts as a lossy waveguide.  As shown in [4], the increase in 
atmospheric noise temperature is: 
∆𝑇 = (𝑇! − 𝑇!)(𝐿 − 1)/𝐿                      (3) 
where: 
∆𝑇 is the increase in atmospheric noise temperature, K. 
𝑇! is the rain physical temperature, ~300K. 
𝑇! is the typical cold sky temperature, ~25K. 
𝐿 is the rain attenuation. 
Figure 2 shows a sample of the rain impact for the case 
of cloud height ℎ = 7.5  𝑘𝑚  𝑎𝑛𝑑  spacecraft elevation 
𝜃 = 45 deg.   This elevation is chosen as an example 
because it is almost the midpoint in the 10-80 deg elevation 
range expected with New Horizons tracking at Canberra. 
Individual effects of signal attenuation (given by (2)) and 
degradation in system noise temperature (given by (3)) are 
included, as well as the total degradation.

degradation and total degradation for various precipitation rates at 45-deg 
elevation and 7.5 km rain height

ASESSMENT 
For the particular case of 45-deg elevation and an 
assumed 7.5 km rain height, the single 70m antenna tracking 
with a 1.5 dB link margin could tolerate any rain with 
precipitation rate up to 1.5 mm/h.  In contrast, with a 3.4 dB 
margin from an array of 70m and three 34m antennas, the 
link can sustain the rains up to 3.1 mm/h. 
To determine the probability of occurrence of rain with 
precipitation rates of 1.5 mm/h and 3.1 mm/h, we examined 
the precipitation rate of each of the 37 rain events in 2014.   
The average precipitation rates are plotted in Figure 3.  
Twenty-five rain events (68%) were found to have 
precipitation rate below 1.5 mm/h, and 32 events (86%) 
below 3.1 mm/h.   
 
  
Figure 3. Distribution of precipitation rate from rain events in 2014 at 
Canberra. 
 
Thus, the probability of sustaining the rain impact with a 
single 70m antenna tracking is 68%.  With an array, that 
probability increases to 86%.   
More general, the probability of successful data return at 
other elevations (10, 20, 30, 45 and 80 deg) is presented in 
Figure 4.  At lower elevations, the single 70m antenna 
configuration has lower probability of success because the 
signal suffers more loss as it travels on a longer path 
through the rain.  In those cases, the benefit of having extra 
gain provided via the array is more significant.  At higher 
elevations, the single 70m antenna has greater chance to 
succeed due to smaller impact of the rain over shorter path.  
Correspondingly, there is a smaller improvement with the 
arraying. 
Note that the New Horizons spacecraft does not spend 
equal amount of time across the elevation range.   Because 
the spacecraft changes its elevation at a much faster rate 
during rise and set, the time spent at low elevations (10 – 30 
deg) is much less than the time at high elevations (30 – 80 
deg).  In a typical New Horizons track at Canberra, 75% of 
the track time is above 30-deg elevation.  Thus, in Figure 4, 
the region of high elevations above 30 degrees is more 
relevant to the assessment of improvement in the probability 
of success between the single 70m antenna and the array

configuration.  At 30-deg elevation, the array would 
increase the probability of success from 73% to 89%.  At 
highest elevation, the success probability increases from 
86% to 95%. 
 
 
Figure 4. Probability of successful data return in the event of rain for single 
70m antenna and array configuration 
 
Given that the probability of success with the single 70m 
antenna at high elevation is already above 70% and the 
array only increases the chance by 9% – 16%, the New 
Horizons mission operations team, at the time of this report, 
is considering a hybrid approach (subject to the final 
decision).  The mission would stay with the single 70m 
antenna configuration for these critical passes.  That would 
allow other missions continue to be supported by other 34m 
antennas in the DSN.  In the event of forecasted rain or 
encountering actual rain during the pass, the New Horizons 
mission would then request the 34m antennas, if available, 
to be added to the array to increase the probability of 
successful data return. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
In summary, our analysis indicates that the probability 
that a New Horizons’ tracking pass could encounter rain is 
about 1.6%.  When subjected to rain, there is a 73% chance 
that a New Horizons pass with a single 70m antenna would 
be able to sustain the rain’s impact.  If an array of one 70m 
and three 34m antennas is used, the link margin would 
increase by 1.95 dB and the success probability of 
weathering the rain would improve by an additional 9% – 
16% at various tracking elevations.  This analysis has aided 
the New Horizons mission planners to design a strategy that 
would maximize the probability of data return within 
various operational constraints.
