Abstract - Cooperation in wireless sensor networks to detect 
the malicious node without any infrastructure is a recent 
trend in research. The current models need more storage, 
computation, 
security 
tools, 
and 
communication 
requirements. They fail in wireless sensor networks due to 
limitation of resources. Trust-based approach does not need 
high-end resource requirement. The proposed agent-based 
approach eliminates the computations in the sensor nodes 
with appropriate trust factor. The proposed approach uses 
an agent-based collaborative concept to ensure the trust in 
the successive node in the path. The proposed agent-based 
framework uses reputation of neighboring nodes as part of 
trust calculation in its successive node. The simulations were 
presented to calculate the trust of a node. 
Keywords: agent-based approach, packet transfer, wireless 
sensor networks, protocols, trust-based approach, resource. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Sensors are small in size, limited computational 
power, and capabilities. Wireless sensor networks are 
based on these small form-factor nodes transmitting the 
collected information to the base station. Since safe 
transmission of information is important, the path of 
transmission must be trustworthy. Therefore, each node 
must trust the successive node in the path. If any node in 
the path is suspicious, the decision node must calculate 
the alternative path.  
There are varieties of methods to calculate the trust of 
a successive node. The methods include the reputation-
based trust management, event-based trust management, 
collaborative trust management, and agent-based trust 
management. In reputation-based trust management, the 
node stores the number of packets transfer from the node 
and calculate the success rate of packets transferred from 
its successive node. In the event-based trust management 
system, the trust rate is calculated at particular or specific 
time events or periodically. In collaborative models, the 
business models are used to calculate the trust similar to 
product 
trust 
management. 
In 
agent-based 
trust 
management systems, an agent node is introduced to store 
the packet transfer information from a cluster of nodes 
within communication distance. The agent-based systems 
relieve the most of the processing time of nodes and the 
nodes concentrate on transfer of information. Trust-based 
systems will help to detect the malicious nodes and 
eliminate them from the communication path.  
A trusted node must transmit the minimum acceptable 
number of packets. The minimum acceptable number is 
called threshold. The threshold is used to rate the node. 
The ratings will be updated and maintained using Sporas 
formula [7] or Molina’s fuzzy reputation model [5] or 
proposed agent-based model. The proposed model 
reduces the overheads on sensor nodes and helps to 
improve the life time expectancy and efficiency. 
Figure 1 show the WSN with nodes, neighbor nodes, and 
an agent to collect and process trust information. The 
agent’s responsibility is to collect the node ratings update 
the trust of each node within communication distance of 
successive node in the path. The agent also provides the 
level of trust and recommends alternative path if the trust 
is below the threshold value. 
The remaining part of the paper discusses the related 
work, reputation based trust, agent-based trust calculation. 
The reputation based trust model uses Sporas formula and 
Molina’s fuzzy model and comparison of these models to 
update the rates. Finally, the paper presents concluding 
remarks and future research.

RELATED WORK 
Trust management is not a new concept in the 
electronic market. Reputation and trust are the basics of 
product sales. Establishing trust on a product manufacture 
industry and reputation of a product is the source of sales. 
Similarly, establishing trust on a node transferring the 
packets and reputation of the node is very important to 
keep the sensor node on data transfer path. Trust 
calculation and update the node ratings uses reputation-
based trust calculation [1, 4], event-based trust 
management [3], and agent-based trust management [7-9]. 
Repeated games help to detect the trustworthiness of a 
node in the path [1].  
Ganeriwal et al. [2] discussed the reputation-based 
framework for high integrity sensor networks. The model

evaluates the trustworthiness of the nodes and various 
type of misbehavior of nodes in the network. The model 
uses the Bayesian formulation and updates the trust with 
direct and indirect trust calculations.  
Trust is not consistent. It varies from time to time and 
event to event. In sensor networks, a series of events 
happens. Data collection, data routing, location report, 
identifying neighbor, reorganizing the network, and time 
synchronization are very common. In event-based 
systems [2], the behavior of sensors and collection of trust 
rating from neighbor nodes is done through agents. The 
agent decides the trustworthiness of sensor and path 
reestablishment.  
The agent-based system [7-9] uses various methods of 
sensor node ratings and calculation of trust of nodes. In 
agent-based models, an agent is created with a set of 
nodes within the communication distance. The agent is 
responsible to calculate the trust and reputation of the 
nodes using various formulas.  
Collaborative reputation in an electronic market [3] 
uses the Sporas formula to calculate the ratings of a node 
on Web. The ratings will conclude the trust in WSN.  Bio-
inspired technique based on ant colony system. The most 
worthy path is detected by using the pheromone traces 
deposited by ants.  
Momani et al. [10] proposed the secure data 
aggregation scheme to detect the inside attack (within 
networks) and trustworthiness of a node in the WSN.  
Further, trust establishment in ad hoc network using 
distributed environment was studied in [12].  
Contribution: Trust ratings with Sporas formula and fuzzy 
reputations of Molina’s formula were derived and 
compared. The two methods used to calculate the trust of 
a node. It is concluded that the learning rate and most 
recent trust rate helps in detecting the malicious node 
quickly. Further, the agent in each cluster minimizes the 
computational overhead of the nodes. The simulations 
were presented to illustrate the theoretical analysis.   
III. 
TRUST AND REPUTATION 
The reputation-based models use the rate of a number 
of packets received to transfer by a node [1]. The event-
based models calculate the trust on the rate of transfer of 
packets at any particular event [2]. Further, business 
(collaborative) models are used to calculate the trust of a 
node depending upon the rating by neighboring nodes [3]. 
All models were used to calculate the trust and detect the 
malicious node, so that they can avoid the malicious node 
from the data transfer path. These calculations show that 
trust is calculated on the behavior of a node in the data 
transfer path.  
Molina et al. used the fuzzy reputation to calculate the 
trust of a node [5, 6]. The trust depends upon the 
reputation of a node

The equation (6) shows that if the remembrance 
 =1 
or

reputation of the node. That is, a long term excellent 
reputation node and recent added good node assumes to 
be trustworthy. 
Further, in equation (1), if the remembrance 
=1, 
then current reputation is average of previous reputation 
and current ratings. Figure 2a shows the relation between 
reputation of a node and current reputation. In normal 
conditions, the current reputation is proportional to 
previous reputation.

Once 
the

get 
updated 
continuously, 
the 
node 
rate 
constantly 
increases 
(stabilizes). If the reputation is random (reputation may be 
low or high) and ratings are increasing or decreasing, the 
node is not trustworthy. The node drops the packets 
randomly. The Figure 2c and Figure 2d shows that if the 
nodes are dropping packets randomly, the increasing 
reputation is better than decreasing reputation. 
In the agent based systems, it is recommended to use 
the Sporas formula to update the ratings, so that the fuzzy 
reputation formula of equation (1) provides better results. 
The reliability of the nodes in WSN is temporary. The 
continuous update of ratings is required in the WSN. 
IV. 
AGENT-BASED APPROACH 
Agent-based trust approach is similar to cluster-based 
approach or watchdog approach [5, 7, 9]. The cluster 
forms with the nodes that are within communicating 
distance. Each cluster has an agent to collect the 
reputation of nodes. The reputation of a node includes two 
factors. 
 Trust of each node in the cluster transmitting the 
packets through same node and must be within 
communicating distance. 
 Trust of a node (constant and less than 1) to its 
neighboring node(s). 
The agent keeps the above information of each node 
within communicating distance and calculates the trust of 
a node in the transmitting path. The trust value decides 
the trust of node in the communication path. Therefore, 
the trust depends upon the direct observations of a node 
plus the indirect observations received from its 
neighboring nodes. The reputation of a node is calculated 
in two ways. 
Case 1: From the Figure 1, the reputation of a node D at 
node A is a sum of the observations of node A, node C 
with respect node A, and node B with respect to node A. 
The reputation of node D at node A is given by

The nodes C and B are neighbors of node A. The 
direct reputations are at decision node and indirect 
reputations are from its neighboring nodes. Initially, the 
constant factor at decision node carries higher value than 
other nodes. The values of 
and 
are based on the 
trust of node A with respect to nodes C and B. Figure 3a 
shows that the higher value of alpha lower the confidence 
of a node that was put in trust test. If the value of 
and 
are larger, then the indirect observations provide better 
results. That is, the neighbor nodes receive more 
confidence on the successive node with respective to the 
testing node (node A is a testing node in the current case). 
Therefore, it is better to adjust the alpha value at lower 
level (<0.5). Figure 3b shows the collaborative trust 
calculation at Node A as trust value decreases. 
Collaborative effort helps and confirms the trust status. In 
the current problem (Figure 3a and 3b), it is clearly shown 
that, the node A to D has communication problem and D 
is not a malicious node. Furthermore, node A can confirm 
from node B and node C the confidence or reputation of

node D using their original trust values which are stored 
at the agent. 
In agent-based systems, the agent has the trust and 
reputation values of all nodes. The agent also has the level 
of belief on its neighbors. The level of belief is the 
multiplication factor (
or
) that helps to calculate its 
belief factor on a specific node. The trust at any node is 
calculated using the equation (7). Further, the agent-based 
system eliminates the computations required at each node 
and saves the energy of nodes. Saving the energy 
increases the life of sensor nodes.

Figure 4a shows the slow decrease of trust calculated 
through equations (9) to (11). The confidence factor helps 
to confirm the successive node status. The Figure 4a is 
drawn with higher reputation of neighbor nodes and trust 
of node A on node D is decreasing. Figure 4b is drawn for 
higher reputation of node D at node A (above the 
threshold value) and lower reputation of nodes B and C 
on D. The results show that the lower reputation of node 
D at neighboring nodes effects the decision at node A. 
The equations (7) and (11) approximately produce the 
same result. The results show that if the node D is 
malicious and temporarily produces better reputation at A, 
the collaborative effort will give warning to drop the node 
from the communication path.

CONCLUSIONS 
Trust-based packet transfer has been taken significant 
importance in recent years. The secure transfer of 
information with low cost is still a debatable problem in 
WSN. In this paper, we first presented the fuzzy rating 
models and Sporas formula for node rating. An agent-
based approach was introduced to calculate the trust using 
the collaborative approach. The ratings of a node and its 
neighbors with respective to the node help for better 
decision on trust calculation of successive node in the 
path. A similar approach was used to lower the burden of 
computational work on the node. Lowering the 
computational work at node increases the life of sensor 
node. 
The future research includes the event-based trust 
calculation. The event-based trust is recently introduced, 
and very little work was done in this line. Event-based 
trust models depend upon the specific events in the 
surroundings of a sensor node. It will be easier to detect 
the malicious node in the communication path using the 
data of specific events in the surroundings of a node.
