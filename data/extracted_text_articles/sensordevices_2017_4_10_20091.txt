Abstract—An indoor positioning system where trichromatic
white Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) are used both for
illumination proposes and as transmitters and an optical
processor, based on a-SiC:H technology, as mobile receiver is
presented. On-Off Keying (OOK) modulation scheme is used,
and it provides a good trade-off between system performance
and implementation complexity. The relationship between the
transmitted data and the received digital output levels is
decoded. LED bulbs work as transmitters, sending information
together with different identifiers, IDs, related to their physical
locations. A triangular topology for the unit cell is analysed,
and a 2D localization design, demonstrated by a prototype
implementation, is presented. Fine-grained indoor localization
is tested. The received signal is used in coded multiplexing
techniques for supporting communications and navigation
concomitantly on the same channel. The location and motion
information is found by mapping the position and estimating
the location areas.

INTRODUCTION
Research on indoor localization and navigation has long
been a popular topic. Localization is one of the essential
modules of many mobile wireless applications. Although
Global Positioning System (GPS) works extremely well for
an open-air localization, it does not perform effectively in
indoor environments, due to the inability of GPS signals to
penetrate through in-building materials. Therefore, precise
indoor localization is still a critical missing component and
has been gaining growing interest from a wide range of
applications, e.g., location detection of assets in a warehouse,
patient tracking inside the hospital, and emergency personnel
positioning in a disaster area. Although many methods are
available, such as WiFi-based [1], [2] and visual indoor
topological localization [3], [4], they require dense coverage
of WiFi access points or expensive sensors like high-
performance cameras to guarantee the localization accuracy.
In the sequence, we propose to use modulated visible light
(carried out by white low cost Red, Green, and Blue, RGB,
LEDs) to provide globally consistent signal-patterns to
perform indoor localization.
We present a 2D localization design, demonstrated by a
prototype implementation. The main issue is to divide the
space into spatial beams originating from the different light
sources, and identify each beam with a unique time sequence
of light signals. The receiver, equipped with a light sensor,
determines its spatial beam by detecting the light signals,
followed by optimization schemes to refine its location
within the beam. Fine-grained indoor localization can enable
a multitude of applications. In supermarkets and shopping
malls, exact location of products can greatly improve the
customer's
shopping
experience
and
enable
customer
analytics [5], [6].
Visible
Light
Communication
(VLC)
is
a
data
transmission technology [7], [8], [9], and [10], based on the
use of visible light. Due to the combination of illumination
and communication, a lot of research has been performed for
VLC applications [11], [12], and [13]. With this technology,
it is possible to achieve simultaneous illumination and data
transfer by means of LEDs. This functionality has given rise
to VLC, where LED luminaires are used for high-speed data
transfer [14], [15]. Moreover, both interior lighting of a room
and data transfer will be achieved without the need of an
additional communication system. Aside from integrability
with the illumination system, VLC has many advantages
compared
with
other
radio
based
technologies:
radio
frequency (RF) interference free, RF interference immune,
safe for human health, and more secure [16]. Luminaires
equipped with multi colored LEDs can provide further
possibilities for signal modulation and detection in VLC
systems [17].
The use of Red-Green-Blue (RGB) LEDs is a promising
solution to high-speed VLC systems as they offer the
possibility
of
the
Wavelength
Division
Multiplexing
(WDM), which can greatly increase the transmission data
rate. In the recent past, we have developed a WDM device

that
enhances
the
transmission
capacity
of
optical
communications in the visible range. The device was based
on tandem a-SiC:H/a-Si:H pin/pin light controlled filter with
two
optical
gates
that
select
the
different
channel
wavelengths. When different visible signals are encoded in
the same optical transmission path [18], [19] the device
multiplexes the different optical channels, and performs
different filtering processes: amplification, switching, and
wavelength conversion. Finally, it decodes the encoded
signals recovering the transmitted information.
This paper provides detailed characteristics of various
components in a VLC system such as transmitter and
receiver, multiplexing techniques, system design and visible
light sensing and applications, such as indoor localization
and
motion
recognition.
A
2D
localization
design,
demonstrated
by
a
prototype
implementation
will
be
analyzed. Fine-grained indoor localization is tested. The
proposed system, composed data transmission and indoor
positioning, involves wireless communication, smart sensor
and
optical
sources
network,
which
constitutes
a
transdisciplinary approach framed in cyber-physical systems.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section I, an
introduction
is
presented.
In
Section
II,
the
system
configuration and its characterization is explained. In Section
III, indoor positioning is analyzed while, in Section IV, some
navigation system examples are shown. Finally, Section V
summarizes the conclusions.
II.
SYSTEM CONFIGURATION AND CARACTERIZATION
A.
Transmitter
The positioning system’s topology is a self-positioning
system in which the measuring unit is mobile. This unit
receives the signals of several transmitters in known
locations, and has the capability to compute their location
based on the measured signals. LED bulbs work as
transmitters, sending information together with different IDs
related to their physical locations. Each LED lamp transmits
data during the time slot it occupies, i.e., the individual LED
lamp transmits its own data depending on the area it locates.
An optical receiver inside the mobile terminal extracts the
location
information
to
perform
positioning
and,
concomitantly, the transmitted data from each transmitter.
The beam area of light radiation of an LED, in the array,
has the form of a circle. The estimate distance from the
ceiling is used to generate a circle around each transmitter
(see Figure 1) on which the device must be located in order
to receive the transmitted information (generated location
and coded data). To receive the information from several
transmitters, the device must be positioned where the circles
from each transmitter overlap, producing at the receiver a
MUX signal that, after demultiplexing, acts twofold as a
positioning system and also a data transmitter. The receiver
detects one or more signals from light beams of different
LEDs. If the signal it receives is only from one LED, the
coordinates of the LED are assigned the device’s reference
point. If the device receives multiple signals, i.e., if it is in
the overlapping region of two or more LEDs, it finds the
centroid of the received coordinates and stores it as the
reference point. Thus, the overlap region is used as an
advantage to increase the accuracy in position estimation
because more overlapping region means more reference
points.
The proposed system considers a set of LED bulbs on the
ceiling and a mobile terminal. The ceiling plan for the LED
array layout of a unit cell is shown in Figure 1a (LED array =
RGBV color spots). A triangular topology was considered
for the unit cell (Figure 1a). The proposed arrangement
employs four modulated LEDs (RGBV), three of them
(RGB-LED) are located at the vertices of an equilateral
triangle and a fourth one (V) is located at its centroid. The
geometric scenario used for calculation uses a calibration
grid (triangular), smaller, to improve its practicality. Here, a
beam radius of 2 cm was assumed for each LED. The chips
of the white LEDs can be switched on and off individually in
a desired bit sequence and are 3 cm away from the receiver.
For each RGB-LED, only one chip (R, G, B) is modulated in
order to broadcast the specific information (payload data).
The extra violet LED sends the network cell’s. We name
point 1 where all the four locations overlap. Points 2, 3 and 4
refer to the locations with three overlaps, points 5, 6 and 7
with two overlaps, and finally 8, 9 and 10 where no overlap
occurs. The grid size was chosen in order to have the triangle
inscribed inside the generated circle estimated around the
violet transmitter.

The triangular topology allows the use of clusters cells
and can be applied on large surfaces (Figure 1b). A large-
dimension indoor environment, like a supermarket or a
library can be considered by dividing the room into unit
navigation cells with an appropriate side length. In Figure
1b, the unit cell was repeated in the horizontal and vertical
directions in order to have a mxn matrix of unit cells that fill
all the space and gives the geographical position assigned to
each unit cell. The violet signal carries the ID of the unit cell.
Cell’s IDs are encoded as rows and columns [rrrr; cccc]
using a binary representation for decimal number. For
instance, number 11 is coded as ”1011” (23+0+21+20). In
case of the presented cell in Figure 1a being part of the
cluster (Figure 1b) the ID from the cell located at row 1:
column 1, will be [0001 0001], whereas in case of row 2
column 3, an ID_BIT [0010 0011] will be send by the violet
LED. With perfect information, this method will give an
exact, unique answer, i.e., the cell location in the cluster and
for each unit navigation cell, the single region at the
intersection of the circles.

As stated, the employment of trichromatic RGB LEDs as
transmitters offers the possibility of WDM, which can
greatly increase the transmission data rate.
Light produced by the LEDs is assumed to propagate as a
Gaussian Beam. Under this assumption, in agreement with
the LED’s datasheet used for the laboratory experimental
measurement, the electric field intensity propagates in free
space in its unique fundamental mode [20]. Applying this
model, we calculate the light intensity projected on the target
screen based on the LED characteristics: wavelength,
intensity and divergence angle (60º). In Figure 2, the
simulation of the projected light intensities is shown for the
unit triangular cell. The coordinates of the LEDs, in
centimeters, were set as: V (0, 0), R (0, 2), B(-1.72, -1), G
(1.72, -1).

To transmit the data, an On-Off Keying (OOK) code was
used. In Figure 3, an example of the digital signals (RGBV
codeword) used to drive the LEDs is displayed. In this
example, the ID_BIT [0101 0011] was sent by the violet
LED and corresponds to the unit cell (5,3). The red, the

Receiver
The optoelectronic sensor is a 1x1 cm double pin
heterostructure produced by PECVD (Plasma Enhanced
Chemical Vapor Deposition) sandwiched between two
transparent
conductive
contacts
(TCO).
The
device
configuration is shown in Figure 4. In the heterostructure, p-
i'(a-SiC:H)-n/p-i(a-Si:H)-n [17], the intrinsic layer of the
front p-i-n photodiode is built of a-SiC:H while the back
intrinsic layer is based on a-Si:H. As a result, both front and
back diodes act as optical filters confining, respectively, the
optical carriers resultant from the blue and red wavelength
photons apart, while the optical carriers generated by the
green wavelength photons are absorbed across both.
The device operates within the visible range using for
data transmission modulated low power light supplied by a
violet (V), and three trichromatic LEDs. The RGB-LED are
used together for illumination proposes and individually, one
only chip, to transmit the channel location and data
information. So, a polychromatic mixture of red, green, blue
and violet; λR,G,B,V; pulsed communication channels (input
channels, transmitted data) are combined together, each one
with a specific bit sequence and absorbed accordingly to
their wavelengths (see arrow magnitudes in Figure 4). The
combined optical signal (multiplexed signal; received data)
is analyzed by reading out the generated photocurrent under
negative applied voltage (-8V), with and without 390 nm
background lighting, applied either from front or back sides
[18].

Data analysis shows that the photocurrent depends, under
irradiation, on the irradiated side and on the incoming
wavelength, the irradiation side acting as the optical selector
for the input channels. Under front irradiation, the long
wavelength channels are enhanced and the short wavelength
channels quenched while the opposite occurs under back
irradiation. Note that, under back lighting, as the wavelength
increases the signal strongly decreases while the opposite
occurs under front irradiation. This nonlinearity is the main
idea for decoding the MUX signal at the receiver.

generation 1 (see Figure 1), the photocurrent generated by all
the input channels was measured under front and back

Figure 6.
MUX signal under front and back irradiation. On the top the
transient optical signal from each RGBV are decoded.
The bit sequence of each channel was adjusted in order to
have all the on/off possible states in an ordered sequence.
The photocurrent was normalized to its maximum value. In
Figure 6a this “standard” MUX signal is displayed, under
front and back irradiation. In Figure 6b a random sequence is
shown under the same conditions. In the top of the figures,
the digital decoded information is shown.
The MUX signal under front irradiation is quite different
from the one under back lighting. Results from the
“standard” sequence (Figure 6a) show that for each possible
24 on/off states, it corresponds a well-defined level. Under
front irradiation, sixteen separate levels are detected (d0-d15)
and correspond to all possible combinations of the on/off
states, concerning the input channels. Under back irradiation,
the MUX signal trend is very close to the one of the violet
input channel and allows the readout of the cell´s ID-BIT. In
Figure 6b, some on/off states are missing, but, as expected,
the behavior is the same: front irradiation enhances the
red/green channels while under back irradiation the violet
channel is readout.The functional principle to decode the
transmitted
information
is
based
on
the
adjustable
penetration depths of the photons into the front and back
diodes (see Figure 4), which is linked to their absorption
coefficient in the intrinsic front and back collection areas.
Front irradiation is strongly absorbed at the beginning of the
front diode and, due to the self-bias effect, increases the
electric field at the back diode, where the red incoming
photons are absorbed, resulting in an increased collection.
Under back irradiation, the electric field decreases, mainly at
the i-n back interface, quenching the red signals and
enhancing the blue /violet ones (see Figure 5).
The algorithms to decode the coded information are
relatively straight-forward since the background acts as
selector that chooses one of the 2n sublevels, being n the
number of transmitted channels, and associates to each level
an unique n-bit binary code [21]. The combination of the
four channels under irradiation, denotes the presence of all
the possible sixteen (24) on/off states, clearly observed in
Figure 6a. Here, each level is ordered by the correspondent
gains in a 4 bit binary code [XR, XG, XB, XV], with X=1 if the
channel is on and X=0 if it is off. In Figure 6, in the right
side, it is presented the selection index for the 16-element
look-up (d0-d15) table, each one in its 4-bit binary code
(RGBV) [18]. Therefore, by assigning each output level to a
n digit binary code weighted by the optical gain of each
channel,
the
signal
can
be
decoded.
A
maximum
transmission rate capability of 30 kbps was achieved in a
four channel transmission using this device. In the top of the
figure, the digital decoded information is shown.
III.
INDOOR POSITIONING
In Figure 7, the MUX signals with the receiver at the
nearest positions 2 and 6, under front lighting, are presented.
In Figure 7a, the “standard” bit sequence (Figure 6a) was
analyzed, while in Figure 7b, the random one (Figure 6b)
was imposed.
Along n channel WDM message transmission, 2n on/off
states are possible during an interval of time T (see Figures 6
and 7). The position of the device during the receiving
process will be given by the highest detected level, i. e., the
level where all the n received channels are simultaneously on
[22]. So, the four (RGBV, Figure 6), the three (RGV, Figure
7) or two (GV, Figure 7) received messages will be given by
the decoding of the n received channels while the device

the violet packet will give the 8-bit address of the unit cell,

network.
IV.
NAVIGATION DATA BITS
A challenge in LED-based navigation system is the way
to improve the data transmission rate while maintaining the
capability for accurate navigation. The input of the aided
navigation system is the MUX signal, and the output is the
system state estimated at each time step. For each transition
between an initial location and a final one, two code words
are generated, the initial (i) and the final (f). If the receiver
stays under the same region, they should be the same, if it
moves away they are different [23], [24].
The suitability of the navigation data bit transition was
tested. The navigation solution is to move the sensor unit
along a known pattern path. One can performed signal
acquisition on the different generated locations, for instance:
beginning in point 5 and ending in point 3 (see Figure 1), in
four consecutive instants (t1, t2, t3 and t4).
In a segment where the initial position of the receiver is
point generation 5, then it moves to point 4, after that goes to
point 7 and finally arrives to point 3, the acquired MUX
signal at the instants t1, t2, t3, and t4 is displayed in Figure 8a.
The decoded channels are depicted on top. On the right hand,
the highest levels (horizontal dotted lines), in each time
interval, and the correspondent code words are pointed out.

As the receiver moves between generated point regions,
the received information changes. In turn, red, green or blue
channels are added or removed, but the violet is always
present giving the location of the cell inside the cluster. In
the considered example, the 8-bit positioning ID decoded
from the violet channel was [0010 0110], which corresponds
to line 2, column 6 of the network. Hence, the retrieved
information when the receiver was under point generation 4
(t2) was: 8-bit positioning ID from the cell in the network
[violet channel, 0010 0110], 4-bit positioning ID from the
point generation cell: [RGBV, 1011], red channel payload
packet: [1010 1010 1100 0100…]. When it moves to
generation point 7 (t3) the cell 4-bit positioning ID changes
to [0011] the red information is lost and the blue payload
data
is
maintained
as:
[1011
0111

Nevertheless, the 8-bit violet ID stays the same [0010 0110]
since it corresponds to the same unit cell (line 2, column 6)
in the network.

the vertices of an equilateral triangle to transmit the payload
data and a fourth one is located at its centroid to send the
positioning BIT ID from the unit cell in the network. Fine-
grained indoor localization was tested. A 2D localization
design, demonstrated by a prototype implementation was
developed.
A detailed analysis of the component’s characteristics
within the VLC system, such as transmitter and receiver,
multiplexing techniques, system design, visible light sensing,
and indoor localization and navigation recognition were
discussed. The results showed that, by using a pinpin double
photodiode based on a a-SiC:H heterostucture as mobile
receiver and RBG-LED as transmitters, it is possible not
only to determine the position of a mobile target inside the
unit cell but also in the network and concomitantly to infer
the travel direction along the time. For future work, by using
multiple emitters and receivers, the transmission data rate
through parallelized spatial multiplexing can be improved.
