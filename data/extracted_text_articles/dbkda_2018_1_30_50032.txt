Abstract—It has been a big issue for universities to setup an 
appropriate environment for their students to learn effectively. 
Traditionally, professors have been supposed to understand 
their students, their attitudes to learning, knowledge levels and 
other factors by themselves. Thanks to the recent development 
of Information and Communications Technology (ICT), it is 
possible to collect various kinds of educational data, analyze 
them, and extract useful knowledge for enhancing education. 
Such approach is called Educational Data Mining (EDM). This 
paper, as a part of EDM, deals with the seat occupation data of 
students in a class. It is often pointed out that students who 
take seats close to the lecturer tend to have good evaluation 
scores, or achievements. Our major aim of this paper is to 
analyze objective data and to investigate how students take 
their seats, to find if seat locations relate to the students’ 
achievements, and to investigate if distances of seats between 
students relate to their differences of achievements.

INTRODUCTION
In order to let their students learn effectively, universities 
have been making great efforts. Professors have to educate 
themselves through faculty development (FD) activities. 
They are expected to capture what their students are like, 
including their attitudes to learning, knowledge levels, and 
other pedagogical features. Recent development of ICT 
makes it easy to collect various kinds of educational data. In 
the field of Educational Data Mining (EDM) [11][12], a lot 
of studies have been carried out for investigating about 
students.  
We have been investigating retrospective evaluation texts 
of students written in a term-end lectures in some studies on 
EDM [3] – [10]. Through these studies, we found that 
students who can study with wider viewpoints have better 
achievements than those who have narrower viewpoints. In 
other words, the students who can position new knowledge 
in their knowledge network what they have already learned 
are able to get better achievements, such as the term-end 
examination for evaluating what they have learned in the 
course.  
As was pointed out in [1][2], psychological issues are 
quite important for students in learning, such as to be well-
motivated, to percept meanings of study, and to have 
appropriate self-images for learning. It is also an important 
issue for the lectures how and how much they involve the 
class and help their students have the best achievements out 
of the lectures. Our studies in educational data analysis 
intend to contribute to improvements for these issues. 
We often observe that the students who take seats close 
to the lecturer in the classroom are eager to learn more than 
those who choose far away seats from the lecturer, who seem 
to have less eagerness for learning. We have been wondering 
if this observation is true or not.  
In this paper, as a part of study about students' attitudes 
to learning, eagerness to study, etc., we add-up the data of 
seat positions occupied by students, and investigate further 
on these issues. We take the term-end examination scores as 
the index for measuring achievements of students. We 
investigate how the seat positions of students and their 
achievements are corelated.  
We also observe that students often form groups of 
friends. They are close to each other, and thus, they like to 
do things together, including taking nearby seats in the 
classrooms, chat a lot, and study together. We hypothesize 
that seat positions and achievements of students in the same 
group somehow relate to each other. Investigation of this 
issue is another important aim of this paper.  
In the long run, our goal of analysis of educational data is 
to better understand our students, such as their attitudes 
towards learning, what they think about their learning style, 
how we could advise them for better performance, etc. The 
study conducted in this paper is a part of our approach 
toward this goal. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 
II, we describe the data we deal with for analysis in this 
paper. Then, in Section III, we investigate how students take 
seats in the class and if seat positions relate to the students’ 
achievements. In Section IV, we define the concept of the 
distance between two students, and then, we investigate if 
distances of two students relate to the difference of their 
achievements. Finally, in Section V, we summarize this 
paper and prospect our future plans.  
II.
THE TARGET DATA FOR ANALYSIS
The data we deal with in this paper are obtained in a 
course called "Information Science" in a university in Japan 
during the semester from September 2013 to February 2014. 
The course aimed to make the students learn sufficient 
elementary knowledge about the computer's hardware and 
software, network, information security, information ethics, 
etc., and was consisted of 15 lectures.  
The number of students who registered for the course 
was 68. The number of students who actually attended the 
classes was 67 because one student did not attend the classes

at all. The students of the course consisted from the first-year 
to the fourth-year. The attending students were asked to write 
a mini-report at the end of every class. There was the term-
end examination for assessing the student's achievement, 
which consisted of 3 questions: The first question asked the 
students to choose appropriate terms for the 20 fill-in-the-
blank-places contained in 6 descriptive sentences. The 
second and the third questions asked them to answer in free-
text style. These questions aimed to assess if the students had 
sufficient knowledge about the technical terms and concepts 
which they had learned in the classes. We consider the score 
of this examination as the measuring index of achievement 
of the student.  
Considering the privacy issue of students, we refer each 
student by his or her sequential number. The seat position 
records used in this paper are the ones students recorded 
themselves at each class.  
Figure 1. Seats occupied by students at least once 
Figure 1 shows the seats occupied by at least once by 
some students. The lecturer's table was located at the center 
area of the lower-end of the figure, and a screen was located 
at the lower-left corner, and two entrance doors were located 
at the right; one at the lower-right corner and the other, at the 
top-right corner.  
The seats were spanned from 1 to 11 horizontally (or x- 
direction) and from 2 to 13 vertically (or y-direction). In this 
paper, we specify a set position by its x- and y-coordinates. 
For example, the seat (1, 2) is the left-bottom-end seat, 
which is the closest seat to the screen. The seats at the 
topmost line with 13 y-coordinate existed only from 1 to 3 in 
their x- coordinates. There were no seats from 4 to 11. Thus, 
the seat at (1, 13) is the left-top-most seat and the seat (11, 
12) is the top-right-most seat of the classroom.  
As we can see easily, quite a few students avoided the 
seats that are close to the lecturer and thus some seats had 
been occupied by no students. For example, the seats from 
(2, 2) to (10, 2) except (3, 2) are never occupied by any 
students. Among 124 seats, 26 seats are never used, and the 
rest 98 seats are used at least once. 
Table I shows how many times each seat was occupied 
during the course. The frequencies range from 1 to 16. The 
seat (10, 11) is the only one which has the maximum 
frequency of 16. There are 4 seats which have the minimum 
frequency of 1, namely, (11, 4), (9, 6), (5, 6), (4, 5), and (2, 
5).  
The right-most column marked as µ, meaning the mean, 
shows the mean of the respective line, and the bottom line 
marked as µ shows the mean value of the respective column.

According to Table I, we can say that the seats in the 
areas which are far-end from the lecturer are very popular. 
For example, the seats surrounded by the areas from 1 to 3 in 
horizontal, or x-coordinate and from 8 to 13 in vertical, or y-
coordinate (i.e., far-left corner) have high values, where the 
mean value of frequency in this area is 11.  
Also, the seats in the area surrounded by from 9 to 11 
horizontally and from 8 to 12 vertically (i.e., far-right corner) 
is also the one that is highly used by students, where the 
mean frequency is also 11. Furthermore, the seats in the area 
from 5 to 7 horizontally and from 9 to 12 vertically (i.e., far-
middle) also has mean frequency 11. On the contrary, the 
seats with 4, 5, 8, and 9 in x-coordinate have very low 
frequency in average, as we can see in the last line of Table 
I, specifically, 5, 6, 6, and 8, respectively.  
As we compare the mean frequencies between the 
horizontal lines of seats which are shown at the right-most 
column marked as µ in Table I, the upper area, or the far-
from-the-lecturer area, from 7 to 13 in y-coordinate have 
high values from 9 to 12, whereas the middle area, or the 
not-far-away-and-not-too-close-to-the-lecturer area, from 5 
to 7 in y-coordinate have small values from 5 to 7 in their 
mean frequencies. The lower area, or the closest-to-the-
lecturer area, from 2 to 4 in y-coordinate has the mean 
frequency values from 8 to 11.  
From these observations, we may roughly conclude that 
both horizontally and vertically, far-end areas are popularly 
used by students. As we compare the columns horizontally, 
left-most, middle, and right-most areas are popular, whereas 
the area between these areas are not so much popularly used. 
As we compare the lines vertically, the upper half area is 
most popularly used, and the lower part of the rest areas are 
the next, whereas the upper area in the lower part is the least 
popularly used area.

SEAT POSITION ANALYSIS

classes, whereas some other students transit a lot from a 
lecture to the next one. We assume that a group of students 
who are friends each other might transit together by keeping 
their seat distances as close as possible throughout the 
course.  
A. Correlation between Seat Positions and Achievements of 
Students 
It is often pointed out that students who take seat near the 
lecturer are more eager to learn, and thus have better 
achievements than those who take far-away seats from the 
lecturer. First of all in this section, we would like to make 
sure if this observation is true or not in our data.  
In order to prepare for further analysis, we give a 
formalized descriptions of the data and important concepts. 
We define S = {s1, s2, ..., sn}, the set of all students. 
Note n  =  68 in our case. We also define the set of 
lectures by L = {1, 2, ..., m}. Note m = 15 in our case.  
Let s ∈S and l ∈ L. Then, the seat data is in the 
form seat(s, l ) = (x, y), where x ∈{1, 2, . . . , 11} for x-
coordinate and  y ∈{2, 3, . . . , 13} for y-coordinate. Note 
that seat(s,l) is undefined if the student s is absent at the 
lecture l. We also define Achv(s) for student s as the 
achievement, or examination score, of s. Note 0 ≤
Achv(s) ≤ 100 for all s. 
We define the concept of achievement value for a  
seat for preparing later discussions. Let p be a seat 
position, i.e., p = (x, y) for some x and y so that 1 ≤ x ≤ 11 
and 2 ≤ y ≤ 13. The achievement value α(p) is defined by:
where so(p) = {(s, l) ∈ S×L | seat(s,l) = p}, and |so(p)| is 
the number of elements of the set so(p).  
According to the definition, α(p) is the mean of the
achievements of the students who occupied the seat p on 
the basis of occurrences of occupation. For example, if 
exactly one student takes the seat p, and no other students 
take it, then the achievement value of the seat is the same 
value as the achievement of the occupying student; i.e., 
α(p) = Achv(s). Note that the student may not attended 
all the lectures.  
Table II and Figure 2 show the achievement values of 
seats. The size of a circle in Figure 2 is proportional to the 
achievement value of the seat located as the center of the 
circle. We can see easily that the size of the circles close to 
the lecturer, i.e., in the lower area, are bigger than those in 
the upper area. The rightmost column of Table II shows the 
mean of the achievement values of the line. They also show 
that the achievement values are larger in the lines with 
smaller number, i.e., closer to the lecturer, than those with 
bigger numbers. Thus, we can conclude that our observation 
that the students closer to the lecturer have better 
achievements than those who take far-away, or rear seats. 
We are also interested in to know if there is a difference 
in achievements between the students who sit near the 
enter/exit doors and those who sit far-away seats from the 
doors. We could not find clear differences of the size of the 
circles between left and right areas of the classroom, more 
specifically, the values range from 52 to 68, with small 
difference. Thus, we may roughly conclude that there are no 
significant differences in the achievement of seats between 
left and right positions.

We would like to analyze the differences between areas 
in the classroom. We divide the classroom area into 6 
smaller areas; left area by column numbers from 1 to 3, 
middle area from 4 to 8, and right area from 9 to 11, and 
front area by line numbers from 2 to 6, and back area from 8 
to 13. Table III shows the mean values of achievement of 
these 6 areas; front-left, front-middle, front-right, back-left, 
back-middle, and back-right. As we can see easily, front-left 
and front-right areas have the highest achievement values, 
followed by the back-middle area, and back-left and back-
right areas. The front-middle area has the least, or worst, 
achievement value. 
We investigate a significant difference of the mean of the 
seat achievement α(p) for the six areas in TABLE III using 
the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test without assuming 
equal variance. We obtain the results that F = 3.734, num df 
= 5.000, denom df = 20.061, p-value = 0.01496. The result 
of the mean difference of seat achievement degree α(p) with

a significance level 5%, the p-value is 0.01496. Thus, we can 
conclude that significant difference holds in at least one pair 
of 6 areas. 
It is interesting to see that the students who sit in front 
area are diligent and having good achievements in general. It 
is also interesting that in the back area, students in front of 
the lecturer may be more diligent than those who sit far-left 
and far-right seats. We need to investigate further on these 
results with other lecture data in order to generalize this 
observation. 
B. Seat Transition Length Analysis 
In this section, we pay attention to the transitions of seats 
of students. According to our observation, some students 
take same seats at every lecture, whereas some students take 
different seats frequently. It may happen that the seat 
transitions reflect the student's attitude to learning or some 
other attitudes which relate to their achievements. We would 
like to investigate if such kinds of relations exist or not in 
this section. 
Figure 3 shows sample seat transition trajectories of two 
students 12 and 27. Student 12 is a typical example who 
keeps their positions, and student 27 is one who transits a lot. 
Note that the numbers next to the points indicate the lecture 
number. 
(a) Student 12                            (b) Student 27 
Figure 3. Sample Seat Transition Trajectories: (a) with Small Transition 
Length, and (b) with Large Seat Transition Length 
For a student s (∈ S), we define the set of attending 
lectures Ls by Ls = {l ∈ L | seat(s, l) is defined }. Let |·|
be the number of elements of the set. Then, |Ls| is the 
number of the lectures which the student s has attended. 
Thus, 0 ≤ |Ls| ≤ 15 holds. Where, |Ls| = 15 means that the 
student s attended all the classes, whereas |Ls| = 0 means 
that the student s did not attend the class at all. 
Now we define the mean transition length τ(s) of the 
student s with |Ls|> 0 by:  
where, there exists a sequence l1, l2, . . . , lk (∈ L) for 
some k (≥ 2) such that l1 < l2 < · · · < lk and Ls = {l1, 
l2, . . . , lk }. Here, d(p1, p2) is the distance function 
defined for every seat positions p1 and p2. Note that k = 
|Ls|. We define τ (s) = 0 if k = 1; i.e., Ls = {l} for 
some l ∈ L. 
According to our definition, τ(s) is undefined if the 
student s did not attend at all. Note that τ (s) = 0 if 
the student takes the same seat every time he or she 
attended. Note that the Σ-part of the definition is the 
accumulated transition distances. Thus, τ is the mean of 
transitions by only considering the seats when the student 
attended. 
In this paper, we define the distance function d as 
follows: For any seats p1 = (x1, y1) and p2 = (x2, y2), d(p1, p2) 
= |x1 − x2| + |y1 − y2|. Note | · | in this definition is the 
absolute value of the number. In our method of analysis 
conducted in this paper, we may take other distance 
functions such as Euclidean distance:  
d(p1, p2) =

pointed out in Figure 3, we can numerically confirm our 
observation by objective data that τ (s12) = 0.5 ≪ τ (s27) = 
5.9.
Figure 4 shows a histogram for τ . We can see that 
the number of students decreases as τ value increases. 
Thus, many students do not transit a lot. From this result, 
we can say that the student 12 is a typical example of 
those who do not transit a lot, whereas the student 27 
represents a rare case who transits a lot. 
Figure 5 shows how τ values and achievements of 
students are correlated. The correlation coefficient is -
0.253*, which is weak in negative and not uncorrelated. The 
p-value is 0.04726 in the Pearson product-moment 
correlation coefficient test. For the students with long 
transition length τ, i.e., frequently moving students for each 
lecture, achievements are not very good.  
The results of our regression analysis test show that the 
explanatory variable coefficient = -1.78* and the intercept = 
68.96***, adjusted R-squared = 0.04841, p-value = 0.04726. 
The seat transition lengths of the top 10 students in 
achievement, i.e., those who's achievement values are greater 
than or equals to 80, are less than 2 except student 8, who 
has 3.14 in seat transition length. The mean seat transition 
length of these 10 students is 0.77. 
It is interesting to see that the worst 10 students in 
achievement also have smaller transition length. Their 
achievement value is ≤ 51 and their mean transition 
length is 2.07. If we avoid the two students who have more 
than 5 transition length, the remaining 8 students have 1.22
in their transition length.  
The students who have roughly from 50 to 80 have a 
wide range of values in their transition length, where their 
mean length is 2.39. 
IV.
SEAT DISTANCES BETWEEN STUDENTS
In this section, we investigate the correlation between 
seat distances and achievement differences of two students. 
We have a hypothesis that students who are friends tend to 
take seats close to each other. They communicate a lot, do 
things together including studying together. As a result, they 
might have similar achievements in the term-end evaluation 
examination. We would like to verify if this assumption is 
true or not in our data. 
To begin with, we define the seat distance (or just 
distance for brevity) between two students. Let s1 and s2 
be students (∈ S). We define the seat distance δ(s1, s2) of 
s1 and s2 by:
when  Ls1 ∩ Ls2 ≠ϕ .
The seat distance is the mean distance of two students 
when both of them are attending. Thus, δ(s1, s2) is 
undefined when Ls1 ∩ Ls2  = ϕ; which includes the case 
when one student is absent at all the lectures, and when 
one student attends the class, the other one is absent all the 
time.  
Figure 6 shows the histogram of seat distances. The mean 
distance is 7.4, and maximum and minimum distances are 
18.7 and 1, respectively. Figure 7 shows the histogram of 
differences of achievement of all the combinations of a pair 
of students. The number decreases as the difference 
increases. However, as we compare the mean values of 
achievement differences of all pairs and only the pairs which 
have less than or equals to 2, the former value is 24 and the 
latter is 21 as the difference of achievement score increases. 
The minimum, maximum, and mean values of the 
differences are 1, 18.7, and 7.4, respectively.

Figure 9. Mean Achievement Differences over the Range of Distance of 
Students 
Figure 8 shows the correlation between the seat distances 
and achievement difference of every pair of students. From 
the figure, there seems to have little correlation between 
them. Actually, their correlation coefficient is a very small 
positive number of 0.08. 
Next, we restrict the range of seat distance to 2 or less 
than 2, there are 59 cases of pairs of students, which 
correlation coefficient is 0.08, nearly the same value as that 
for all data. However, as we compare the mean values of 
achievement differences of all pairs and only the pairs which 
have less than or equals to 2, the former value is 24 and the 
latter is 21, which is somewhat smaller for the intimate 
student pairs than those in general. 
Figure 9 shows the comparison of the mean differences 
from 0 to 20 by dividing them with the range width of 2. We 
can see that the values for the intervals 4-6 and 16-18 have 
smaller difference values than the closest value interval of 0-
2. Thus, we cannot say that achievement difference is small 
when the seat distance is very small. We need to investigate 
in more detail in order to clarify what conditions are needed 
in our assumption that friendship of students might induce 
similarity of their achievements holds.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
The major goal of our series of study is to understand 
about the students, such as their attitudes to the lectures, and 
to learning in general, their motivation and seriousness to 
learning, and their styles in learning, and providing them 
with the best learning environment to them so that they can 
achieve the most out of the lectures.  
Our approach is to extract useful tips for this goal by 
analyzing objective data obtained in the lectures together 
with other data collected by the university they are 
affiliating. By combining these tips and our know-hows 
obtained from practicing lectures, we should be able to 
provide them with good and valuable lectures. 
In this paper, we take seat position data for analysis. 
First, we define an index for seat positions which shows how 
much achievement scores are taken by the students who use 
the seat. The result showed that the students who take seats 
close to the lecturer tend to have good achievements, 
whereas those who take far-away seats achieve rather poorly 
in general, which supports our observation. However, the 
result also inspired that some students with high performance 
may take seats near some far-end corner of the classroom. 
We need to investigate further with different lecture data on 
this.  
Then, we investigate correlation between the transition 
lengths and achievements. We found that students who have 
either high achievements and low achievements rather transit 
a little length, and achievements of the students in the middle 
area vary widely from small transition to big transition 
lengths. 
Even though we have some amount of confidence that 
students who take seat close to each other and transit 
together in order to keep their close distance might have 
similar achievement difference. Experimental result inspired 
that this is not true. One possible interpretation of this result 
is that there are many students who happen to take seats 
close to each other without intending to take close seats. We 
need to investigate further on such possibilities. 
Our future study topics include: (1) to investigate the seat 
data further so that we can extract more valuable tips, (2) to 
analyze text data of the mini-reports which students had 
written at the end of each lecture, (3) to apply the similar 
method presented in this paper to other lecture data and 
compare them, etc.
