Abstract—Time-varying nature of mobile fading channels
can affect the design of wireless systems in many different
aspects. This paper investigates the dynamic behavior of in-
trinsic spatial links in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
transceivers based on Geometric mean decomposition (GMD).
In particular, we suggest using a ﬁnite-state Markov chain
(FSMC) to model the ﬂuctuations of both eigenmodes geometric
mean and capacity for MIMO-GMD schemes in Rayleigh fad-
ing channels. In order to compute the transition probabilities
analytically, a number of related statistical distributions are
developed and employed. Simulation results have illustrated
that FSMC can provide accurate approximations.

fading; Markov model.
I. INTRODUCTION
Spatial multiplexing-based multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) transceiver scheme has been regarded as one of
the key technologies to increase the spectral efﬁciency of
future wireless communication systems. By using multiple
antennas at both transmitter and receiver side, multiple
independent data streams can be transmitted within the same
time-frequency resource with appropriate signal processing
techniques [1]. In some common MIMO transceivers such
as schemes based on singular value decomposition (SVD)
[2], the gains of multiple parallel spatial links are different,
which may lead to high complexity in power distribution
and bit-allocation algorithms in spatial domain. In order
to reduce the complexity, it is possible to use the same
modulation format on all subchannels. However, this may
result in the degradation in error performance since the
BER (bit error rate) is dominated by the sub-channel with
the lowest power gain. In general, the minimum singular
value of the MIMO channel matrix can affect the system
performance in many ways [3].
An alternative MIMO transceiver architecture termed as
Geometric Mean Decomposition (GMD) has been proposed
by Jiang et al. [4], which is able to realize multiple parallel
spatial links with identical gains from a MIMO channel.
Speciﬁcally, the gains of all these parallel links are equal to
the geometric mean of channel eigenmodes. Thus, bit and
power allocation can be undertaken more conveniently as
the modulation/coding scheme on all subchannels should
be the same. In recent years, MIMO-GMD transceivers
have received the attention from many researchers in both
academia and industry. In particular, both LTE-A and
WiMAX (802.16m), two of the most important standards
for the next-generation wireless broadband, have considered
MIMO-GMD in the standardization process [5], [6].
Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, statistical
properties of the link gains realized by GMD in MIMO
fading channels have not been characterized. In this paper,
we are particularly interested in the dynamic behavior of
the link gain and channel capacity in MIMO-GMD, which
is important to the design of various adaptive transmission
mechanisms. For instance, the adaptation/feedback rate for
MIMO-GMD with adaptive modulation could be set in a
more judicious manner if one could gauge the variation of
link gain and capacity. On the other hand, successive inter-
ference cancelation (SIC) is usually used in the detection of
a MIMO-GMD transceiver, in which the reliability of a data
stream is dependent on previously-decoded data streams. If
the receiver fails to detect a data stream successfully, error
propagation is very likely to occur as the receiver is not able
to correctly decode the data on the remaining streams. This
might happen when the spatial link gain is too weak, and
the characterization on channel variation may provide some
crucial information on how frequently an error propagation
event would occur.
Finite-state Markov chain (FSMC) is a commonly-used
tool to model a time-varying process. It generally quantizes
the process into multiple distinct states, and the time-varying
behavior is characterized by the transition probabilities
among these states. Some researchers have designed the
feedback mechanisms for adaptive modulation systems with
channels modeled by FSMC [7]. In this paper, FSMC is used
to model both link gain and capacity processes of MIMO-
GMD systems in fading channels. We provide several uni-
variate and bivariate probability density functions (PDFs)
of spatial links and capacities for a MIMO-GMD scheme
in this paper, and demonstrate the methods of transition-

probability computations using these distribution functions.
Note that the univariate PDFs have already been derived
in [8]. In order to construct FSMC, this paper applies the
results obtained in [8], as well as extending the derivations
for bivariate PDFs.
The remainder of the paper is organized as following: In
Section II, the channel model for our analysis is described,
and the concept of MIMO-GMD architecture and FSMC
are brieﬂy reviewed. In Section III, univariate PDFs are
developed based on Gamma approximations. Then, bivariate
PDFs for eigenvalue geometric mean and channel capacity
are given in Section IV. In Section V, we calculate transition
probabilities for the geometric mean and capacity for the
FSMC. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section VI.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Channel Model and Assumptions
In this paper, we consider an (Nt, Nr) MIMO system with
Nt and Nr antennas at transmitter and receiver respectively.
The MIMO channel matrix, H, is therefore an Nr ×Nt ma-
trix. Here we denote m = min(Nt, Nr), n = max(Nt, Nr)
and l = n − m. Each of the channel entries is modeled as a
complex Gaussian random variable with zero mean and unit
variance (Rayleigh fading). The eigenvalues of the channel
correlation matrix (H† H), represent the power gains of
spatial links intrinsic to the SVD-based MIMO systems (the
so called eigenmodes), and their joint statistics are governed
by central Wishart distribution [9]:
f(λ1, . . . , λm) =
exp (− ∑m
i=1 λi)
m! ∏m
i=1(n − i)!(m − i)!
×
m
∏
i=1
λl

∏

(λi − λj)2.
(1)
On the other hand, we presume that the channel evolves over
time in accordance to:
H(t+τ) = J0(2πfDτ) H(t)+
√
1 − J0(2πfDτ)2 Ψ, (2)
where J0(·) is the zeroth-order Bessel function and fD
and τ are the Doppler frequency and time displacement,
respectively. Ψ is a Nr × Nt random matrix with zero-
mean complex Gaussian elements CN(0, 1). For simplicity,
we denote the auto-correlation ζ = J0(2πfDτ) in the rest
of the paper.
B. Review of Geometric Mean Decomposition
The general input-output relationship of a MIMO trans-
mission in ﬂat-fading channel can be written as:
y = Hx + z
(3)
where y is an Nr × 1 vector of received symbol, x is an
Nt ×1 vector of transmitted data, and z is a Gaussian noise
vector with Nr elements. Based on (3), the authors of [4]
have suggested to design MIMO transceivers using GMD,
in which the MIMO channel is decomposed as:
H = Q R P †
(4)
where P and Q are semi-unitary matrices and R represents
an m × m upper triangular matrix with identical diagonal
elements. By pre-coding the data signal x by P at the
transmitter, and multiplying y by Q† at the receiver, the
transmitted signal can be extracted and decoded using the
nulling and cancelation procedure as in BLAST schemes
[1]. Hence, without considering the effects of error prop-
agation, the data signals are sent on m subchannels. We
denote the diagonal elements of R by gσ and
gσ =
( m
∏
i=1
σi
) 1
m
.
(5)
where σi represents the ith singular value of the MIMO
channel H. Hence, the sub-channel envelops are identical
and are equivalent to the geometric mean of MIMO channel
singular values. Remarkably, as m subchannels have iden-
tical gains, the performance of MIMO-GMD schemes does
not suffer from ”worst subchannel” problems as in some
other transceiver architectures. Presuming that the transmis-
sion power is uniformly allocated on all subchannels, the
resultant channel capacity is
C = m log2(1 + γ g2
s) = m log2(1 + γ g),
(6)
where γ denotes the SNR on each sub-channel and
g = g2
s =
( m
∏
i=1
λi
) 1
m
(7)
is the sub-channel power gain, which is equivalent to the
geometric mean of eigenmodes.
C. Finite-State Markov Chain
FSMC has been widely used for modeling time-varying
processes in various contexts such as signal processing and
wireless communications. In order to model the ﬂuctuation
of a random process using an FSMC, the process shall be
ﬁrstly quantized into a number of discrete states. Then, the
dynamic behavior is characterized by the transition proba-
bilities among these states. In this paper, we only consider
the ﬁrst-order FSMC, in which the transition probability is
solely dependent on the preceding state. In our case, we
partition the processes of both eigenmode geometric mean
and capacity based on their magnitudes. That is, we simply
partition the random process of interest into S states by
setting S − 1 threshold levels. In the ﬁrst state (denoted
as S0), the process has a value smaller than the lowest
threshold level T0. In the ﬁnal state (SS), the process is
larger than the highest threshold level TS−1. Otherwise, the
process is said to be in the ith state (denoted as Si) if
its value falls in the range between threshold levels Ti−1

and Ti. Fig 1 shows an example in which the eigenmode
geometric mean process is partitioned into four states. The
main objective of this paper is to provide analytical methods
of calculations for transition probabilities, which requires the
univariate and bivariate statistical distributions for the target
random processes (eigenmode geometric mean and capacity
in MIMO-GMD schemes). We develop these distribution
functions in subsequent sections.
III. UNIVARIATE DISTRIBUTIONS
For MIMO-GMD schemes with two subchannels (m =
2), the exact PDFs for the eigenmodes geometric mean can
be written as described in [8]:
f(g) =
4 g2(n−1)
(n − 1)!(n − 2)! K1(2 g),
(8)
where K1(·) represents the Modiﬁed Bessel Function of the
Second Kind of order 1. Moreover, the closed-form PDF for
the channel capacity in MIMO-GMD scheme with m = 2
has also been derived as:
f(C) = 2 ln(2)
√

.
(9)
Nonetheless, for MIMO-GMD schemes with m > 2 sub-
channels, the PDFs for both eigenmode geometric mean and
channel capacity are difﬁcult, if not impossible, to derive
due to high computational complexity. Fortunately, some
previous studies have concluded that MIMO eigenmodes
(λ1, λ2, . . . , λm) can be very accurately approximated by
a Gamma random variables [10]. In addition, [11] claims
that the geometric mean of multiple independent Gamma
random variables could be either a Gamma or a mixture of
Gamma distributions. Although MIMO eigenvalues are not

independent processes, they are weakly correlated. So we
may simply approximate the eigenvalue geometric mean g
by Gamma distribution, the PDF which is widely-known.
Therefore, we may make a hypothesis stating that
f(g) ≈ Gamma(k, θ) = gk−1 exp( −g
θ )
Γ(k) θk
,
(10)
where k = E(g)/θ and θ = Var(g)/E(g) are shape factor
and scale factor of Gamma distribution, respectively. The
computations for Var(g) requires the ﬁrst two moments of
g as Var(g) = E(g2) − E(g)2. Note that the vth moment of
g can be calculated as:

where f(λ1, . . . , λm) has been given as (1). To make this
paper self-contained, we have tabulated the numerical values
of E(g), Var(g), k and θ for (4,4), (4,8) and (8,8) cases in
Table I. Hence, one may construct the PDFs for g in these
cases accordingly.
Utilizing Gamma approximation of (10), we can extend
it to ﬁnd the results on capacity PDF. With simple transfor-
mations, we have

(12)
Here we justify the suitability of Gamma approximations
for the eigenmode geometric mean via simulations. In Fig 2,
we can see that Gamma distributions provide excellent
approximation for eigenvalue geometric means. Although
we did not show here, it has been found that Gamma distri-
butions also ﬁt the simulation data in m = 2 cases. Hence,
we can claim that, for practical MIMO systems (m ≤ 8) at
least, the distributions of eigenmode geometric means can
be approximated by Gamma random variables. For channel
capacity, we compare the distributions of simulation samples
with the capacity PDF (12), which was derived based on
Gamma approximation of g. The comparisons are shown in
Fig 3, and we can see that simulation data and computed
results highly agree with each other.

IV. BIVARIATE DISTRIBUTIONS
In the previous section, we have developed PDFs for the
eigenmodes geometric mean and channel capacity based on
Gamma approximations. In order to compute the transition
probabilities for FSMC, the joint probability density for the
process at two adjacent time points is also required. Since
we have observed that the eigenmode geometric mean can be
accurately approximated by a Gamma random variable, the
joint density of eigenmode geometric mean at two correlated
time instants, g(t) and g(t + τ), could be described by the
bivariate Gamma PDFs. Thus, by modifying the bivariate
Gamma PDF in [12], we have:

where bg

= E(g bg) − E(g)2
Var(g)
.
(14)
In (14), both E(g) and Var(g) can be calculated using (1).
On the other hand, the computation for the joint moment,
E(g bg), requires the joint density for eigenmodes at two time
instants [10]:

V. COMPUTATIONS OF TRANSITION PROBABILITIES
As aforementioned, we consider a ﬁrst-order FSMC in this
paper. Therefore, the transition probabilities from Si to Sj,
denoted as Pi,j, for the eigenmode geometric mean process
can be computed as
Pi,j = Prob(g(t) ∈ Si, g(t + τ) ∈ Sj)
Prob(g(t) ∈ Si)
,
(17)
where
Prob(g(t) ∈ Si, g(t + τ) ∈ Sj) =
∫
Sj
∫
Si
f(g, bg) dg dbg,
(18)
and
Prob(g(t) ∈ Si) =
∫
Si
f(g) dg.
(19)
Note that f(g) could be (8) or (10), depending on the value
of m. For sake of simplicity, we assume that the channel
variation is slow enough so the process would only transit
to one of the adjacent states (from Si to Si−1 or Si+1) or stay
in the same state (from Si to Si) in this paper. Therefore,
we have
Pi,i = 1 − Pi,i+1 − Pi,i−1.
(20)
For channel capacity in MIMO-GMD scheme, the transition
probabilities can be computed in a similar fashion. In order
to verify that FSMC is an appropriate tool to model the
ﬂuctuation of MIMO-GMD channel, several Monte Carlo
simulations have been carried out. In particular, simula-
tion results on transition probabilities for both eigenmodes
geometric mean and channel capacity are compared with
our calculations by (17) and (20). Note that the thresh-
old levels for state quantization are set arbitrarily in our
simulations. In practical adaptive modulation schemes, for
example, the threshold levels for state quantization could be
set based on minimum-required channel gain for a target
error performance. We set fD = 30Hz, τ = 0.001sec
and γ = 10dB in all scenarios. In Fig 4, the eigenmode
geometric mean is modeled as a FSMC consisting of four
states with {T0, T1, T2} = {1.5, 2.5, 3.5}, and transition
probabilities from both simulations and calculations are plot-
ted. Similarly, we approximate the MIMO-GMD capacity
process in a (2,2) system using a four-state FSMC with
{T0, T1, T2} = {4, 7, 9} in Fig 5. In both cases, it is
apparent that our calculations can provide very accurate
approximations.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have aimed to model the channel
variation in MIMO-GMD scheme using a FSMC. Since
FSMC simply quantizes the process into multiple discrete
states, which naturally ﬁts to various applications in channel-
dependent adaptive transmission. For example, in link adap-
tation mechanisms, each modulation and coding scheme
usually corresponds to a range of channel gains, which can

use FSMC of eigenmode geometric-mean to examine how
likely the MIMO-GMD system would enter the state with
high probability of error propagation. In order to calculate
transition probabilities analytically, we have approximated
the eigenmodes geometric-mean process by Gamma dis-
tribution, and developed associating bivariate PDFs based
on such approximations. From the simulation results, it
is apparent that our computations can give very accurate
approximations. Hence, we can conclude that FSMC is
