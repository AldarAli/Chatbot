Abstract—This paper investigates the outage performance of a 
Decode-and-Forward (DF) Multi-User (MU) stratospheric 
relay communication system operating over Generalized-
Gamma (GG) fading channels. This system consists of multiple 
users-sources, multiple users-destinations and a High-Altitude 
Platform (HAP) acting as a relay station in the stratosphere. 
Geometry-based optimal relay location with fixed power 
allocation is proposed, in order to minimize the outage 
probability. Exact and approximated expressions for the End-
to-End (E2E) outage probability are derived and opportunistic 
scheduling is applied, where the Source-Destination (SD) pair 
with the highest instantaneous E2E Signal-to-Noise Ratio 
(SNR) is scheduled for communication. The results highlight 
the gains offered by the opportunistic SD scheduling and the 
optimization of the relay location on the overall performance. 
Keywords-Generalized Gamma (GG) fading; High-Altitude 
Platforms (HAPs); Multi-User (MU); oppurtunistic scheduling;

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
A key objective in the development of future generation 
communication systems and the Internet of Things (IoT) 
applications is the seamless integration of wireless terrestrial 
and aerospace infrastructures over heterogeneous networks 
[1] [2]. In recent years, a great interest has been drawn 
towards the development of High-Altitude Platforms 
(HAPs), intending to provide ubiquitous wireless access over 
large coverage areas at low cost, while attaining network 
flexibility and adaptability due to their rapid deployment and 
movement on demand [3]. The term HAPs defines aerial 
platforms flying in the stratosphere. 
The radio links of terrestrial nodes are usually vulnerable 
to fading effects arising from scattering, reflection, 
diffraction, or blockage of the radiated energy by objects in 
the propagation environment. Hence, exploiting the features 
of cooperative diversity techniques by preserving the End-to-
End (E2E) communication between a source (S) and a 
destination (D) via an intermediate relay (R) can fulfill the 
demands for enhanced link reliability with greater mobility 
support and extended network range [4].  
With the rapid growth of the number of connected 
devices, Fifth-Generation (5G) communication systems will 
be deployed in dense-user environments. Hence, shifting 
from Single-User (SU) to Multi-User (MU) systems is 
indispensable [5]. In MU systems, the MU diversity gain can 
significantly 
improve 
the 
system 
performance 
by 
appropriately designing user scheduling schemes. These 
schemes are necessary, as a single relay may be incapable of 
simultaneously serving multiple users. The opportunistic 
scheduling is a well-known and efficient user selection 
schemes that are usually used to select among the users [6]. 
In this scheme, the user with the best channel conditions is 
always allowed to conduct its transmission in both downlink 
and uplink scenarios. Also, this scheme is usually used to 
achieve the maximum sum-rate capacity in wireless 
networks. However, in scenarios where asymmetric link 
conditions exist, a trade-off between capacity and fairness 
among users arises. 
More recently, the investigation of relaying in Multi-
Source (MS) Multi-Destination (MD) networks has been 
investigated [7], since based on these schemes substantial 
achievable rate improvement in shared-spectrum multiple 
access wireless systems are offered. In these networks, 
multiple Source-Destination (SD) pairs simultaneously 
communicate with the help of relay nodes. Typical paradigm 
of this configuration is the Interference Relay Channel (IRC) 
[8], where a relay assists two independent source-destination 
pairs by using different relaying methods, as well as the 
cellular operation, in which multiple users within a cell 
communicate with each other through a base station acting as 
a relay unit.  
Motivated by the aforementioned observations, this paper 
investigates the use of a radio relay installed on a HAP that 
acts as a stratospheric relay station, between multiple user 
pairs. This configuration is envisioned to be applied in 5G 
systems, where the relay nodes are expected to be located at 
the cell edge establishing the communication links between 
cell-edge users. An opportunistic scheduling scheme is 
adopted, in order to select the pair with the best E2E channel 
among the available ones. In the proposed system, each user 
pair is able to communicate through the relay. Depending on 
the propagation environment, each link may experience 
different channel fading conditions. In particular, Rician, 
Rayleigh, and log-normal distributions are suggested to 
model the channel fading in urban, sub-urban, and rural

environments, respectively [9]. By generalizing the previous 
approaches, this paper considers that the channel fading 
follows the Generalized-Gamma (GG) distribution [10], 
which includes many well-known distributions as special 
cases, whereas it has the important advantage of 
approximately describing other distributions [11]. Also, this 
paper proposes geometry-based optimization schemes 
regarding the position of the stratospheric relay for 
determining the SD pair with the best E2E Signal-to-Noise 
Ratio (SNR). The performance of the underlying system is 
analyzed in terms of the outage probability. The results 
demonstrate the effect of the number of SD pairs, fading 
characteristics, and optimized relay location on the system’s 
performance. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II 
presents 
the 
system 
model 
and 
the 
geometrical 
characteristics, whereas Section III analyzes the channel 
statistics. In Section IV, mathematical expressions for the 
outage probability are derived. Section V proposes 
geometrical design recommendation for optimal outage 
performance. Results are provided in Section VI. Finally, 
conclusions are drawn in Section VII. 
II. 
SYSTEM MODEL 
This paper considers a MS-MD relay-assisted airborne 
communication system with slowly-varying, frequency-flat 
block-fading channels, where the channel coefficients stay 
constant over an entire block of communication. As shown 
in Figure 1, the proposed system consists of one cluster of K 
users, the sources, trying to communicate with one cluster of 
K users, the destinations, with the aid of a Decode-and-
Forward (DF) stratospheric relay. This relay is situated 
approximately 20 km above the ground, equipped with two 
antennas, one for transmitting and the other for receiving. In 
this system, two users communicate with each other with the 
help of the relay since the direct links between them are 
obstructed due to high attenuation in the propagation 
medium. To aid our analysis, the subscripts Sk, R, and Dk, 
where 1

 are affiliated with the k-th source, the 
relay, and the k-th destination, respectively. All of the user 
pairs are in the set U, where the k-th user pair is denoted by 


,
.
k

D
 Due to hardware limitations, the communication 
operates in a Half-Duplex (HD) mode and is conducted over 
two phases; the first phase (hop) includes the link between Sk 
and R, while the second phase (hop) involves the link 
between R and Dk. Time is divided in time-slots and multiple 
access is based on Time-Division Multiple Access (TDMA), 
where at each time-slot one SD pair is activated for 
transmission. 
The

between the k-th source (destination) and the relay are 
generalized gamma fading coefficients and identically 
distributed. In addition, in all cases the received signal is also 
affected by Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) with 
variance 
NO.
 
 
A. Geometrical Characteristics 
For analytical simplification purposes, we assume that 
the users and the relay are placed on a x-y plane. 
Specifically, as shown in Figure 2, the users are placed on 
the horizontal axis, whereas the relay is placed on the 
vertical axis. This assumption is reasonable since it 
minimizes the effect of path loss. The fundamental 
parameters, which describe the geometry of the proposed 
system, are the elevation angle

To analyze the performance of the proposed system, 
obtaining the statistics of the E2E SNR provided in (11) is 
required. 
The scheduling is based on an opportunistic SD pair 
selection, where at each time-slot, the pair with the best E2E 
SNR is activated for communication. More specifically, the 
opportunistic SD pair selection will activate the k*-th pair 
according to:

OPTIMAL LOCATION OF THE STRATOSPHERIC RELAY 
An important design parameter is to determine the 
optimal relay position that will minimize the outage 
probability for a given set of users. For this optimal position, 
the proposed scheduling approach determines the pairs of 
users that will communicate, according to the opportunistic 
scheduling principle.  
In order to determine the optimal relay position, we set 
sin
Sk

 and consider a predetermined power allocation

 and fixed values of

Thus, the problem of finding the optimal relay location with 
respect to Sk and Dk can be stated as follows

Using (6), (10), and (17)-(19) and computing the second 
derivative of

 with respect to ,x  one can easily show 
that the objective function is a strictly convex function of

 Moreover, computing the first derivative of

with respect to ,x  the optimal relay location is the root of the 
equation in (21).  
Standard iterative root-finding algorithms can be used to 
efficiently find numerical solutions to

NUMERICAL RESULTS 
This section investigates the performance of the proposed 
system in terms of the outage probability for a wide range of 
transmit SNR values. For this purpose, a simulation setup 
was developed in MATLAB and the transmission of 106 
packets for each SNR value was performed. Unless 
indicated otherwise, the values of model parameters used are

Figure 3 and Figure 4 depict the outage probability as a 
function of the transmit SNR for different number of SD 
pairs and symmetric Rician/Rician and Rayleigh/Rayleigh 
fading, respectively. Both the optimal and the non-optimal 
location of the stratospheric relay is considered. One 
observes that the optimized system outperforms the non-
optimized one. Moreover, a significant performance 
improvement can be achieved, as the number of users 
increases. By comparing the results in Figure 3 and Figure 4, 
it is also obvious that the Rician/Rician fading leads to 
significantly better results. 
Figure 5 shows the outage probability as a function of the 
transmit SNR for four SD pairs and asymmetric 
Rayleigh/Rician and Rician/Rayleigh fading. One observes 
that the type of fading slightly affects the outage probability 
when the stratospheric relay is located at an optimal position.

Overall, the design recommendations ensure the 
successful operation and feasibility of the proposed system 
regardless of the variation of the propagation phenomena of 
both links. On the contrary, the improper position of the 
relay substantially influences the system performance 
depending on the fading conditions. 
VII. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, an opportunistic MS-MD pair selection 
scheme for stratospheric relay systems over GG fading 
channels has been presented. An optimum geometry-based 
design criterion for the placement of the stratospheric relay 
has been also developed, under a high SNR assumption and 
the impact of the number of SD pairs, the type of fading, and 
the 
proper/improper 
relay 
location 
on 
the 
system 
performance 
has 
been 
studied. 
The 
results 
have 
demonstrated that the performance decreases, as the fading 
conditions worsen, the number of SD pairs decreases, and 
the stratospheric relay shifts from its optimized location. 
These results provide guidelines for the solution of the 
fundamental problem of relay placement, in order to 
guarantee the MS-MD advantage in practice.  
This work could be further improved or extended into 
different areas. Apart from the outage performance, the bit-
error-rate (BER) and the throughput performance should be 
also evaluated. It would be also interesting to apply the 
proposed schemes to systems, where the users and the relay 
are equipped with multiple antennas, in order to exploit full 
diversity, i.e., both multi-antenna diversity and MS-MD 
diversity. Since power control is important in MS-MD relay 
networks, jointly optimizing the power allocation and the 
relay location is desirable. Also, in topologies where 
asymmetric link conditions exist, scheduling should be 
modified in order to ensure fairness among the SD pairs. 
Finally, this work can be extended to additionally support 
multiple stratospheric relays with free-space optical (FSO) 
inter-platform links.
