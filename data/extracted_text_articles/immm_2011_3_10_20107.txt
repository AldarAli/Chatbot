Abstract—In this work, we present a semi-automatic semantic 
annotation system which is designed to link publisher entries to 
an existing Ontology and instances.  It assists in categorizing 
the content of Web sites and associating advertisements with 
publishers. Semantic annotation can enhance information 
retrieval 
and 
improve 
interoperability. 
Since 
manual 
annotation is inefficient, Automatic 
or semi-automatic 
annotation makes the process of annotation fast and easy. The 
suggested system is integrated in the publisher’s registration 
platform of the semantic advertising network and serves to 
facilitate registration, semantic annotation and information 
utilization in Web sites. This system is part of a semantic 
advertising network prototype called Lexeme.  
Keywords-semantic web; semi-automatic annotation; 
Advertising Networks; RDF. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Advertising networks or ad networks are companies that 
connect potential advertising Web sites with potential 
advertisers [5]. Ad networks have made advertising on the 
Web very easy. Advertisers pay Web site owners 
(“Publishers”)  to allow ads to be shown on their sites. The 
Publisher is an individual or corporation responsible for the 
distribution of digital publications  who will be using the ad 
network to make a profit from facilitating easy and dynamic 
publishing of ads on his Web site.  
The reliance of ad networks on the keywords (in the 
content) without an accurate interpretation of the context of 
the page results in  a display of irrelevant and unappealing 
ads on a Web page [1]. The Semantic Web is a technology 
that can be utilized by publishers to analyze the meanings 
behind a word or words. It will help to place ads in prime  
web locations for the sole purpose of reaching their targeted 
consumers [2]. We envision an algorithm that contains not 
only information instructing machines as to what ads to 
display, but also structured data which make machines 
understand what ads have been displayed. Such structured 
information that can be read and understood by computers 
[3] is the key. It enables machine-to-machine exchange and 
automated processing in a way that computers can 
understand [4]. In a time of mass content creation, 
improving ad placement through more optimized, findable 
content ushers in a new era of Semantic technology . It  
delivers the right message to the right user. The Semantic 
advertising networks combine the desirable features of both 
advertising networks and the Semantic Web. Semantic 
documents, Web sites and ads are generally written in the 
Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Web Ontology 
Language (OWL) languages [4]. Currently, only a few 
semantic documents exist on the Internet. 
The challenge addressed by this paper is related to 
automating the provision of semantic structure to publishing 
Web sites. The semantic structure is provided to individual 
pieces of information in the Web site and interlinks these 
pieces with semantic relations. This results in a meaningful 
organization of content.   
The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we 
present the semantic representation of Web site content, and 
in Section 3, we show the related work. In Section 4, we 
discuss the proposed semantic annotation system. In Section 
5, we discuss what technology has been used in developing 
the prototype. In Section 6, we show the experiment results. 
The conclusion and future work are given in Section 7. 
II. 
SEMANTIC REPRESENTATION OF WEB SITE 
CONTENT 
In this section, we focus on annotating Web site content 
with semantic representations. Semantic annotation helps in 
effectively matching Web site content with relevant 
resources. 
     Currently, a document might be one page filled by text. 
The data itself are not structured in a way that can be 
interpreted by a computer. There is no complex logic or 
reasoning concerning the data; there are only simple 
keyword-matching algorithms. At this stage, it is necessary 
to establish  a relation among the data so that it can be 
considered a semantic web.  
     However, the next generation of the Web, the Semantic 
Web, makes machines more intelligent as a result of better 
algorithms used to process data on the Web. Web 3.0 is 
about data that is connected and capable of being 
reassembled on demand. This reassembly of data and the 
reorganization of data pieces is a central factor of Web 3.0.

     The resulting intelligence in the structure and format of 
the data 
yields a richer relationship and linking 
infrastructure of data on the Web. The Semantic Web 
specifications, in particular RDF and OWL, are the only 
technology specifications that were purpose-built for use as 
a metadata language entirely dedicated to describing and 
linking data of all sorts at Web scale [7]. Therefore, the 
Semantic Web introduces a logical language that human 
programmers can use to inform computers of the 
relationships among data. It pursues an important goal of  
creating a new form of Web content that is meaningful to 
computers. 
     Ontology is an explicit formal specification of the terms 
in the domain and relations among them [9]. Ontology can 
be used to define the underlying semantics of the Web site 
content through the semantic annotation system, as 
illustrated in Figure 1 below. Semantic annotation helps in 
linking Ontology with Web site content for an efficient and 
easy embedding of semantics. The annotation results are 
stored in an RDF metadata store. 
III. 
RELATED WORK 
This paper is motivated by the need for adding metadata to 
existing web pages in an efficient way and establishing 
relationships among the data. There have already been 
certain researches conducted which are connected with our 
mechanisms for semi-automatic semantic annotation, 
described in Section 4. Our attempt is to demonstrate the 
application of semantic annotation of publishing Web sites 
to serve advertising network applications. The suggested 
annotation system supports an integrated environment with 
the registration of publishing Web sites in a semantic 
advertising network system. In addition, it supports 
document-annotation consistency and separate annotation 
storage. It automatically links salient terms in a Web site to 
relevant ontological instances/classes and their properties. It

Figure1. Linking Web sites and Ontology by Semantic Annotation 
uses simple lexicon-based parsing and linguistic rules to 
identify instances.  
Erdmann et al. [12] describe their approach to finite state 
technologies and support of lexical acquisition, and 
semantic tagging through them. The work coincides with 
our approach and uses the concepts that are stored on the 
Ontology. The source Websites have been manually 
annotated to explicitly represent the semantics of their 
contents. It introduces a proprietary extension to HTML that 
is compatible with common web browsers. Since there is a 
huge amount of relevant information for most communities, 
manual annotation is  burdensome, and it is an impractical 
solution. 
Blythe et al.‟s [13] ACE system enables users to enter a 
free text into a parser. Then it compares the free text with 
the Ontology for term replacement. However, the ACE 
system cannot annotate the whole article. It only accepts 
user annotations as short statements of free text. The system 
is designed to be robust, allowing partial formalizations of 
the annotation and not relying on a successful parse of the 
user‟s input.  
Steffen et al. [14] have been developing a tool, 
OntoAnnotate, that allows usage of domain-specific 
Ontologies for easy annotation of HTML documents and 
creation of meta data by (semi-automatic) annotating web 
pages. Starting from their Ontology-based annotation 
environment 
in 
OntoAnnotate, 
they 
have 
collected 
experiences in an actual evaluation study. 
      Liu et al. [15] propose a semi-automatic annotation 
system, which assists users  in annotating textual web data 
and manages the terms defined by the user. The system uses 
OWL to describe semantic web data and  annotate them. It 
happens in two ways: using a manual annotator with the 
help of the user, or an automatic annotator using the KMP 
algorithm. The work uses string matching to identify classes 
and neglect properties and relationships. 
     Most of the works on Ontology-based semantic 
annotation have been developed based on manual semantic 
annotation. With the huge amount of information on the 
Web and the upswing of the Semantic Web, there comes an 
urgent need for automating the process of adding semantic 
annotation to existing web pages.  
IV. 
SEMANTIC ANNOTATION SYSTEM 
This section illustrates how the semantic annotation 
system works. It gives an example, and then describes the 
suggested architecture of the system and the different 
components that  compose it.  
A. Example Scenario 
The proposed system links Web site registration to an 
existing education advertising domain Ontology (EAO) [9] 
by semi-automatic semantic annotation. A Web site is 
described as a set of concepts followed by a set of 
properties. When the publisher registers his Web site, he has 
to enter the URL of the Web page that will host the  
49

Figure 2. The registration page of the publisher 
advertisements . For example, in our case, the Web site [17] 
is an educational Web site, and it was one of our samples.  
In addition, the publisher has the choice of entering a URL 
that has an RDFa embedded in his Web page (i.e., Semantic 
Web site), as shown in Figure 2. 
     Annotation starts with parsing the content of the 
registered Web site for extracting salient terms. This is 
automated by natural language processing of the Web site 
content. 
     Our system links extracted concepts to Ontology entries 
and suggests a number of terms that may describe the Web 
page, depending on the content of the publisher Web site 
and the Ontology. The publisher has to choose a number of 
terms that describe his Web page the best. In our example, 
the system will suggest the concepts "Color," "Ink," 
"Computer" " Paper," and "Printer" as shown in Figure 3. 
As long as we are suggesting a semi-automated annotation 
system, the system expects verification of the results 
suggested by the parser. 
Then, the system gives a list of properties expressed in 
a natural language, which is suggested by the Ontology 
content. In our case it corresponds to the "Paper" and 
"Computer," 
namely: 
"is 
manufactured 
by," 
is 
dimensioned," "is colored," "is priced for," as shown in 
Figure 4. The publisher selects a property and then assigns 
to it a specific value. In our example, the price of the paper 
was set to "10$" and the computer manufactured by "Dell" 
and priced for "1500$". That represents the value of the 
selected property "is priced for" and the property" is 
manufactured by." 
 
Figure 3. The concepts that match publisher Web site the best 
 
Figure 4. Properties of the selected concept 
 
The system is self-learning. In cases in which some 
related instances or concepts are not defined in the 
Ontology, only the administrator may add a suitable 
instance or concept. The administrator may enter a new 
relation for an existing concept as shown in Figure 5 below. 
Furthermore, if the concepts found on the publisher 
Web page cannot be matched with the Ontology concepts, 
the system suggests terms that have a similar meaning. For 
example, if it finds "Pen" or "Writing Instrument" in the 
Web page, then it will refer to the term "Pen." Figure 6 
shows an XML file storing all the concepts that are in the 
Ontology and their synonyms. The XML file can be edited  
through administration access only. It is used to give each 
term a score that measures the relevancy to the concept that 
is stored in the Ontology. The relevancy score is a 
measuring function that is conducted by the system to help 
in matching the terms found in the Web pages to our 
Ontology concepts. The administrator can add and/or edit 
the concepts in the XML file and calculate the score of the 
relevancy.

Figure 7. Synonyms of the term "Notebook" 
     Also, if the system finds a type of concept, the system 
will suggest the concept to the publisher. For example, as 
shown in Figure 7, the system will suggest  the term 
"Notebook" if it finds one of these terms: "lined Notebook", 
"unlined Notebook", "notebook" or "stationery''.  
B. Proposed Architecture 
Figure 8 illustrates the architecture of our suggested 
system, which helps the publisher to add semantic 
description to his Web page in a semi-automated way. The 
publisher first adds his Web site metadata along with the 
URL through the Web site registration page. The Term 
Extractor is an automatic tool used to extract terms that best 
describe concepts in the Web page. We have used the Porter 
stemming algorithm (or „Porter stemmer‟). It is a process for 
removing the more common morphological and inflexional 
endings from words in English. Its main use is as part of a 
term normalization process that is usually done when setting 
up Information Retrieval systems [8]. 
The Concept Mapper links extracted concepts to 
Ontology entries. The component automatically suggests 
related instances and saves verified annotations in the 
metadata store. Further, the system suggests relationships 
defined between instances by finding related instances from 
the Ontology. Finally, the publisher is provided with a list of 
properties associated with each instance and asks for 
supplying values. The set of concepts, relationships

www.rebelofficesupplies.co.uk content 
and properties describing the Web site semantic content is 
referred to as the RDF model. 
The RDF model will be converted into an RDF graph 
through the Graph constructor. An RDF graph is set of RDF 
triples (subject, verb, and object). Triples are the basis of 
information representation. Figure 9 above shows part of the 
RDF code that  has been generated for the Web site [17]. 
V. 
IMPLEMENTATION 
To develop the semi-automated system, we used Jena's 
APIs [18] as our semantic framework. We also developed

and vice versa. In addition, we asked a few experts to gather 
  
 
Figure 10. The relationship among the entities 
some samples that they considered to be related to the 
educational domain. We then made sure that they were 
100% strictly XHTML pages. 
Failure to find a proper Ontology for putting relevant ads 
on WebPages stimulated us to create our own product. By 
developing a custom-made Ontology, we were able to 
define countless education specialties, such as publications, 
school supplies, and writing instruments, that had not been 
present in any educational Ontology at the time. To build 
the Ontology, we used  the  Protégé  editor [19]. Figure 10 
shows a snapshot of the structure of the Ontology of the 
above scenario. 
VI. 
EXPERIMENT RESULTS 
The system provides indexed RDF matches  and metadata 
matches. In this section, we test the system using two 
evaluation methods. First, we assess the RDF files that have 
been generated by the system for each website using the 
W3C validation service [20] to validate the RDF files. 
Experiments have been carried out using ten educational 
Web sites, the advertisement collection is approximately 50 
ads, and all generated RDF files have been validated 
successfully through this tool. 
 Second, we evaluate the performance of the system using 
Precision and Recall. We do not intend to suggest a 
sophisticated semantic annotation system. Instead, we 
provide a simple demonstration of semantic annotation in 
advertising networks. 
     Semantic match in the system retrieves publishing web 
sites relevant to a submitted ad of interest. A simple 
algorithm is outlined below. 
 
1. Get and conceptualize the ad. 
2. Find relevant publisher‟s web sites by matching the ad 
RDF against the RDF repository of publisher‟s web sites. 
3. Retrieve the metadata of the relevant Web sites. 
4. Place the ad in the ad place defined for ad displays in the 
publisher‟s Web site. 
5. Capture the number of clicks on the ad and add to web 
site metadata. 
6. Direct the visitor to the corresponding ad home page. 
 
 
Jena‟s matching method is used to match the semantic 
content of both the ad and the publishing web sites. 
     The following experiment aims at testing our generated 
RDFs for the publishers‟ Web sites against the stored RDFs 
of the ads. The matching process for both approaches is the 
same. 
     The system will match the RDF that has just been created 
with the stored RDFs in the database and try to find a 
match. The matching process will depend on the number of 
triples in the RDF graph that matches with the Web site 
graph. If it finds a matching triple or a partial matching, it 
will put the matching advertisement in the Web site space. 
Figure 11 shows part of the code that is used for matching. 
The system uses the getSubject() and getPredicate() 
methods that are impeded in Jena to match the two graphs 
depending on their subject and predicate. 
 
Figure 11. Part of the matching code 
public static int Match(Graph g1, Graph g2) 
{ 
    Triple T1,T2; 
    int count; 
    ExtendedIterator iter1, iter2; 
    count = 0; 
     
     /* if the two graphs are isomorphic; stop the loop and the ad will be 
placed in this website. the count will be = -1 */ 
 
     if(g1.isIsomorphicWith(g2)) 
      return -1; 
      iter1 = g1.find(Triple.ANY); //returns an Iterator for all the triples in 
the graph 
   while(iter1.hasNext()) 
     { 
       iter2 = g2.find(Triple.ANY); 
        T1 = (Triple) iter1.next(); // T is a triple from the ad graph 
        while(iter2.hasNext()) 
        { 
            T2 = (Triple) iter2.next(); 
            if (T1.getSubject().equals(T2.getSubject()) && 
T1.getPredicate().equals(T2.getPredicate())) 
            { 
                count++; 
            } } } 
return count; 
}

Figure 12. A fragment of the RDF Representation of the ad 
 
Figure 13.  Displaying the result of the match 
     The RDF file that is shown for the matching ad is shown 
in Figure 12. 
     Among the set of advertisements returned by the system  
to be displayed on the publisher Web site, we selected the 
result shown in Figure 13,  from an advertisement for the 
Dell company, which was placed in the matched website. 
We have used the Precision and the Recall to compute 
the matching Web sites with relevant ad rates. The 
following table shows the Precision and Recall rates for 
each website. Also, it shows the F-score, which is defined as 
the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall to reflect the 
actual performance of the system. 
      Precision is a measure of correctness.  As Table 1 
shows, the Precision rates are mostly 100% because the 
system only retrieves the ads that have matching RDF 
graphs with the website graphs. If the graph does not match, 
the system will discard the advertisement as a choice and 
test another advertisement graph.  
     On the other hand, Recall is a measure of 
completeness. It shows the rate of retrieving all the relevant 
ads, as shown in the table below, where it  ranges from 30% 
to

Figure 14.  the relation between the Precision and the Recall 
100%. The reason for that is that when the system chooses 
one ad and tries to find another ad that matches, it will 
encounter a relevant ad; however, sometimes that relevant 
ad will have fewer matching triples then the original ad. The 
system will not consider it as retrieved.   
     As a result of a greater Precision rate, the Recall rate is 
decreased, as shown in Figure 14, and as the Precision rate 
becomes higher, the number of relevant ads that are 
retrieved is lower. 
     If we combine the two metrics, Precision and Recall, we 
get their harmonic mean, known as the F-measure. This is a 
measure of a test's accuracy. As shown in Table 1, the F-
measure ranges from 44% to 100%. The F-measure average 
is 75.5%. This average is considered high and it points to 
the high accuracy of the system.  Considering the 
experiment results, we believe semantic advertising 
networks have considerable potential.

his Web page using semantic technology and Ontology.  We 
have demonstrated and proven how current advertising 
methods can be improved. The introduction of Semantic 
Technology is essential for reaping larger financial gains. It 
is important for analyzing the meanings between the lines in 
order to place ads in prime web-locations for the sole 
purpose of reaching their targeted consumers. With this 
system, there will no longer be the Web 2.0 emphasis on 
factors such as keyword matching. The emergence of Web 
3.0 means tapping into more important elements such as 
understanding the context of Web pages, and latent or 
hidden connections amid these contexts. It serves to 
discover relationships among concepts and ideas. 
 
In the future, a significant amount of work should be 
done. We will try to provide the publisher with the privilege 
of adding/editing concepts to the Ontology by an 
administration approval that matches his preference. We 
will support the RDF standard for representing metadata on 
the web, representing both Ontologies and generated 
annotated facts in RDFs. This standard will make annotated 
facts reusable and machine processable on the web [10].
