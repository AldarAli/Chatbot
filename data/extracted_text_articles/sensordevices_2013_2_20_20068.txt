Abstract: There are many fuel quality standards introduced by 
national organizations and fuel producers. Usual techniques 
for measuring the quality of fuel, as for example cetane index, 
fraction composition and flash point, require relatively 
complex and expensive laboratory equipment. Therefore, 
testing of fuel is not rapid and can be costly. On the fuel user 
side, fast and low cost sensing of useful state biodiesel fuel is 
important. For this purpose, we have investigated the sensing 
method 
and 
sensor 
head 
that 
could 
be 
cheap 
in 
instrumentation as well as in fuel examination, and lead itself 
to automation. The method presented in this paper is based on 
fiber optic capillaries with local heating. We have investigated 
the construction of the sensor that imitates the fuel injection 
process and of he local heating element, the two critical 
elements for biodiesel fuel testing. We propose a new capillary 
optrode construction that enables measuring of time of vapor 
phase creation. We examine fuels that are mixtures of 
characterized components of petrodiesel fuel and bio-esters as 
well as edible rapeseed oil. We show that useful state of 
biodiesel fuel can be determined from the time of local heating 
that is required for vapor phase creation and the local time of 
vapor bubble formation. 
Keywords: biodiesel fuel, fuel quality, useful state of fuel, 
fiber optic capillaries, fiber optic sensors, capillary sensos.  
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Nowadays, the useful state of diesel fuel is defined by 
producers by several parameters: cetane number (min 51.0), 
density (860 to 890 kg/m3), and distillation temperature T90 
(max. 360C), kinematic viscosity at 40°C (3.5 to 5.0 
mm2/s), etc. Other diesel fuel parameters characterize its 
operability: carbon residue, water and sediment, cloud point, 
conductivity at 20C, oxidation stability, acidity, copper 
corrosion, flashpoint, lubricity, appearance, and color [1]. 
For the ordinary fuel user such collection of parameters is 
often too complex for practical use because it requires 
special laboratory equipment. Therefore, fuel examination is 
not rapid and can be costly. Moreover, the introduction of 
biodiesel fuel increases the number of parameters connected 
with bio component content. In this situation the user 
requires the simplest possible answer to a question: Is that 
fuel useful for my engine?  
Sensing of useful state of biodiesel fuel is exceptionally 
important for car fleet owners and farmers. Car fleet owners 
are interested because of legal regulations and of the 
possibility of buying poor quality fuel. Farmers are interested 
because they can produce bio-fuel components for their own 
use. But the parameters of these components in pure form are 
not optimal. For example, rapeseed and canola oil have too 
small cetane numbers and too high viscosities. However, the 
viscosities of oils decrease with the increase of temperature. 
For these reasons, in tropical countries the potential of using 
biodiesel fuels is larger. The use of mixtures of lychee fruit 
oil with petrodiesel fuel with component shares of 10%, 
20%, 30% and 40% are discussed in [2]. It turned out that, 
despite significant differences in fuel viscosity and flash 
point performance the observed engine parameters with the 
prepared mixtures were very similar [3].  
In a European study, it was observed that using first 
generation of biodiesel fuel at low environment temperatures 
can lead to degeneration of engine parameters [4]. Therefore, 
production standards for biodiesel fuel were introduced: 
density at 15°C (ISO3675) and temperature of fluidity for the 
transitional periods of season and winter (DIN EN 116). The 
disadvantages of biodiesel fuel can be overcome by fuel 
processing [5-8] or by using biopetrodiesel fuel mixtures [9]. 
One of the reasons of low biodiesel fuel mixtures usage 
by farmers is the absence of low cost device to evaluate its 
useful state.  
Our starting point was to consider the critical points of 
fuel conversion into energy. The first is the injector of 
atomized fuel into the combustion chamber by forcibly 
pumping it through a small nozzle. The second critical point 
is the exhaust of gases filtered with the diesel particulate 
filter (DPF). Periodically, the DPF has to be taken up to high 
temperatures to burn off the matter it has collected [10], 
which is realized by contact of DPF with a part of fuel vapor, 
[11].

Typically, fuel is injected into the cylinders just after the 
vapor fires and the exhaust valve opens. At injection point, 
the fuel vaporizes and a part of vapor moves down the 
exhaust to the DPF and cleans it in a precisely controlled 
injection scheme [12]. Because biodiesel fuel has a higher 
distillation temperature than petrodiesel fuel, it does not 
vaporize as fast. Some of the biodiesel fuel can end up 
adhering to the injector, the cylinder wall or runs past the 
rings, diluting the engine oil and diluting DPF deposits 
instead of cleaning it. 
Therefore, the examination of vapor creation parameters 
of biodiesel fuels is critical to evaluate its useful state 
regardless of the composition of fuel. The methods of spray 
forming observation in diesel engine have been used [13], 
but are not good for integration into a sensor device. In this 
work we present new developments and new applications of 
on capillary photonic sensors working on the principle of 
monitoring optical intensity changes in dynamically forced 
measurement cycles, first postulated in [14]. The sensors use 
fiber optic capillaries in which the phase of the filling liquid 
changes locally to gas when forced by local heating, while 
the propagation of light in the capillary is monitored. 
Therefore, the sensors examine simultaneously many liquid 
parameters. 
In this paper are presented the idea of the sensor head, the 
construction of the head, the experimental results of testing 
biodiesel fuels for their quality for use, and conclusions. 
II. 
IDEA OF SENSOR HEAD  
We intend to imitate and examine fuel vaporization in 
conditions that are close to reality. The fuel injector nozzle 
diameters are from 50 to 200m, [15]. Typical temperatures 
inside the fuel injection nozzle are from 235 to 275C, the 
maximum not exceeding 300C (see Fig. 1) [16]. Since the 
flame temperatures in the cylinders are about 1500C and the 
wall temperatures are under 350C, we can’t replicate the 
flame temperatures in the sensor device. We have to create a 
set-up allowing the examination of partial evaporation of fuel 
which take place in the nozzle and can move fuel into orifice 
of few hundreds micrometers diameter. Such nozzle can be 
modeled with two glass capillaries that would allow 
observation of the direct optical fuel phases and their 
movement. The capillary with smaller outer diameter can be 
positioned inside the bigger capillary using glue forming a 
single-use replaceable optrode [17]. The inner temperature 
that is needed to create the bubble of vapor can be achieved 
with a local heater positioned near the capillary. With one 
end of capillary closed, the local heater can acts as a fuel 
pump by producing a vapor pressure (see Fig. 2). The 
creation and movement of the bubble depends on the type of 
liquid and vapor parameters as well as on the geometry and 
thermo dynamical conditions. 
The faster is the bubble creation from liquid phase, the 
more probable is the turbulent flow of fuel in the nozzle. 
Therefore, we have to distinguish two stages of the bubble 
creation: the time of liquid fuel heating and the time of phase 
change from liquid to vapor that forms the bubble filling the 
full cross section of the capillary.

III. 
HEAD CONSTRUCTION 
The sensor’s head consists of two functional blocks: the 
base and the optrode [18]. The base is used to integrate the 
microheater, the optical path and for positioning the optrode. 
The optrode is the replaceable part of the head that imitates 
the fuel nozzle and enables monitoring of creation of the 
vapor bubble. 
A. Micro heater 
The microheater has to supply sufficient heat for the 
biodiesel fuel to reach 300C. We examined experimentally 
and numerically the map of temperatures in the model of 
nozzle. We used Coventor software, a R300 NEC thermo-
vision camera, and InfReC analyzer software. The results for 
a 4mm×4mm planar micro heater positioned at 50m under 
the capillary and dissipating 5W in 30 seconds are presented 
in Fig. 3. The temperature of surface reached 327C while 
the temperature inside the capillary reached 247C. 
Sequential 
simulation 
showed 
that 
the 
microheater 
temperature has to be at least 350C for the assumed distance 
between the capillary and microheater surface, which is more 
than can withstand the planar resistors e.g., Vishay High 
Power Thin Film Wraparound Chip Resistor in 2512 
packaging [19].

Wire heaters can easily work at such temperatures, but such 
constructions does not provide a constant and repeatable 
distance between the microheater and the capillary, and they 
can’t replace the planar structures. The most favorable shape 
of planar microheaters is rectangular with side length from 
2mm to 4mm, and the recommended power of heating is 
5÷7W. The power density is 1.75W/mm2, which is also too 
high for classical hybrid resistors. For the heater current 
supply the recommended value of resistance is between 
10÷50even current dividers from Vishay Current Sensing 
Bondable Chip Resistors type S.C. [19], are not optimal for 
the application. We have built different versions of planar 
microheaters using hybrid technology. With an optimized 
technology, the parameters of the microheater were stable for 
temperature shocks from 30°C to 200°C – the resistance 
changes were low, within 1.5Ω at 30Ω of nominal resistance. 
The microheater reached 350C after 30 seconds, dissipating 
6W of power, but it should not be powered for more than 60 
seconds, because of the possibility of breaking into two 
symmetrical parts. The next heating cycle with maximum 
power was safe, when the heater was allowed to cool down 
to room temperature. In normal condition it required about 2 
minutes. 
B. Path of optical signal 
The bubble creation can be observed from outside or 
inside of capillary with the use of optical fibers [20]. The 
bubble position can vary in the area of local heating due to 
variation of fuel composition. Therefore, the observation 
from outside is not optimal for measuring the bubble creation 
time. Observation of the bubble creation with two fibers 
inside the capillary is not optimal for a replaceable optrode 
set-up, and also complicates the fuel flow. To overcome 
those problems, we used a modified capillary optrode with a 
phosphor layer to convert radiation (see Fig. 4). In the 
presented optrode, the phosphor converts the light from 
460nm wavelength of the high power light emitting diodes, 
to 562nm. Only part of the light radiated in the full angle 
extent propagates in the inner capillary to the area of 
examination. The efficiency of light conversion is low. 
 
 
Figure 4.  Optrode that uses phosphor to convert outer radiation into light 
inside capillary. 
 
Figure 5.  The head construction. 
After optimizing the construction, from a L7113QBC-G 
LED operating at 20mW, we got at the end of the plug made 
from optical fiber, 111nW for an empty capillary and 0.3W 
for a capillary filled with biodiesel fuel. The uncertainty of 
low signal level in our construction was 10nW.  
We optimized the optrode elements position: Lp, Lb and 
Lw, as well as the method and parameters of phosphor 
deposition. The optrode was held in position with elastic 
magnetic strips, while the optical fiber was secured with 
miniature neodymium magnets. The head construction is 
presented in Fig. 5. 
 
C. Optoelectronic signal processing 
As light source driver we built an electronic device that 
enabled current modulation from DC to 50 kHz at selected 
frequencies, and was equipped with configurable current 
limiters to prevent accidental LED burning.  
The optoelectronic detection unit of our own construction 
had an SMA fiber input and consisted of an integrated photo-
amplifier and a band-pass filter with amplification and RMS 
detection. We used the S8745-01, AD8253, UAF42, AD536 
and AD8250 components. The optoelectronic unit was 
connected to a personal computer through an analog input 
IOtech personal Daq 3000 16bit/1MHz USB data acquisition 
system. We fed the heater from a laboratory power supply 
Hameg HM8143 controlled by the analog output from Daq. 
The view of sensor hardware set-up is presented in Fig. 6.  
We also used a Daq 3000 system to monitor the 
temperatures of the measuring head base and of the 
surrounding ambient with two LM35DT circuits connected 
by low pass filters. To operate the system, we designed a 
script in DASYLab with a 0.01s sampling rate. The script 
automates the measurements and automatically switched off 
the heater when the light signal dropped under a specified 
value corresponding to the point of vapor bubble creation. 
The script was programmed also to switch off the heater 
when the maximum heating time was reached, but the bubble 
did not form. The length of signal registration was 60s.

EXPERIMENT RESULTS 
In this section are presented the experimental procedure 
and the results of examination of different biodiesel fuels. 
A. Experiment procedure 
At the start of the experiment the part of the optrode 
consisting of the CV7087Q capillary was filled with fuel, 
after which its end was closed. When there were bubbles of 
gas observed at the initial state of experiment, the optrode 
and capillary had to be withdrawn [14]. When the capillaries 
were filled uniformly by the liquid, the initial levels of 
transmitted signals were measured and used as normalization 
levels. We normalized the initial signal level to 4 a.u.  
As the fuel in the useful state is semitransparent, we 
expected initially high signal levels and low signal levels 
when the bubble would appear. The bubble directed the 
signal from the liquid to the capillary walls. When the 
transmitted signal decreased rapidly it gave the impulse to 
switch off the microheater. We terminated the heating when 
signal dropped under 2.5 a.u. Depending on the thermo-
dynamical conditions; the vapor gas phase moved the fuel to 
the open end with a laminar or a turbid flow. The turbid flow 
could be detected optically after the experiment as a presence 
of series of small bubbles in the CV3040Q capillary. We also 
observed a repeatable presence of a small bubble that 
remained after heating in the center of the microheater, 
Fig. 7.  
 
Figure 7.  Small bubble remaining after heating in the center of the 
microheater 
We thought that bubble appeared due to structural 
changes in fuel induced by heating of the components that 
were added after distillation and some bio-components 
decomposition, since the bubble was present also after 
examination of rapeseed oil. 
B. Examination of biodiesel fuels 
We examined 5 fuel mixtures prepared from the same 
components at different ratios, the commercial 100% 
biodiesel fuel, as well as edible rapeseed oil (RO). Selected 
parameters of prepared fuels are grouped in Table 1. The 
distillation of RO and its parameters can be found in [9].

The laboratory fuel examination prior to the experiment 
showed that fuels P2-P17 were meeting the norms. P21 did 
not meet the distillation standards. We made first 
experiments with P2 fuel with two powers of heating 4W 
and 6W, (see Fig. 8 and Fig. 9). The examination results 
showed that increasing the power from 4W to 6W reduced 
the average time of heating  from 14.5 seconds to 9 
seconds. The differences in time of heating were in 
agreement with the thermo dynamical properties of the 
evaluated mixtures.

From our experiment results we saw that P2, P12 and 
P14 fuels did not differ significantly. The P17 fuel formed in 
our heating condition a vapor phase, but the mixture was 
characterized by very high dispersion of time of heating. 
Interestingly, the P21 seemed to be a worse fuel than RO, 
because it required a longer time of heating while 
occasionally showed a lower time of bubble creation. More 
over the RO had the lowest  dispersion, in agreement with 
its distillation parameters that were close to its boiling 
temperature, which is not a good property for a fuel.  
Therefore, we may set for the parameters of useful state 
of biodiesel fuel the upper limits of average time of heating, 
the range of dispersion of time of heating and the upper limit 
of time of vapor phase creation. The data analysis showed

that in our method the useful state of biodiesel fuel was 
directly and firmly connected with the gas phase creation. 
V. 
CONCLUSIOSNS 
We proposed a sensor working on the principle optical 
examination of fuel under local heating. Our optoelectronic 
devices enabled conducting the experiment in lighting room 
conditions. The results of the measured signals analysis of 
biodiesel fuels showed the relationship of times of gas phase 
creation parameters with the useful state of fuel. We showed 
that the information on useful state of diesel fuel as well as 
biodiesel fuel could be presented in the form of 
recommended ranges and times of fuel heating and vapor 
creation. Because the heating was taking place in a closed 
capillary, the fuel did not ignite during experiments. We 
conclude that the proposed construction may be in future the 
base of commercially marketable instruments.  
The future work will consist of optimization of the 
construction and of the data processing function. The sensor 
construction needs to be integrated into a complete portable 
instrument and be built more resistant for use in harsh 
environments outside of the laboratory.
