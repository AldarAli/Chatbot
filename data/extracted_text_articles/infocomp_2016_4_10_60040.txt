Abstract—According to the development planning of BeiDou 
Navigation Satellite System (BDS), a triple-layered satellite 
network architecture serving as relay satellite is studied. On 
this basis, the spatial information system of satellite network 
architecture is analyzed; the satellite network dynamic 
topology model is established. The geometrical properties of 
inter-satellite links (ISLs) are studied deeply with comparing 
the encounter duration of satellites in different orbits. Having 
analyzed the simulation results by Satellite Tool Kit (STK), the 
connectivity features of the ISLs were acquired, and topology 
structure evolution laws of satellite network were also obtained. 
The simulation result shows that adopting IGSO satellites as 
relay satellites enables better stability of elevation angle, which 
is convenient to trace the antenna of satellite and establish high 
quality links. Moreover, full-time ISLs could be established by 
using MEO satellites serve as relay satellites and is able to 
ensure that at least 15 inter satellite links could be established. 
Keywords-satellite relay; dynamic topology model; encounter 
duration; inter-satellite link. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Due to the Earth's curvature and the linear propagation 
characteristics of radio waves, for observation satellites at 
low Earth orbit, the transmission efficiency (ratio of real-
time transmission time and satellite on orbit time) is being in 
an extremely low state. The expansion of base station can not 
fundamentally solve the problem [1].  
Artificial Earth Satellite can be divided into several types 
considering its orbit altitude, as low Earth orbit (LEO) 
satellite, medium Earth satellite (MEO) and geostationary 
Earth orbit satellite (GEO). Relay satellites are generally 
GEO satellites, and the information between the user 
spacecraft and the Earth station is transmitted by it. Its 
favorable geometric position solves the above problems 
effectively, which makes it has many advantages such as 
good real-time performance and high coverage. This greatly 
improves the transmission efficiency of LEO observation 
satellites. 
BeiDou Navigation Satellite System plans to build 5 
satellites in GEO, 27 satellites in MEO and 3 in inclined 
geosynchronous satellite orbit (IGSO) [2]. The system will 
be able to provide a powerful autonomous navigation and 
positioning service when it is completely deployed. The 
abundant satellite resources of the BeiDou could be used in 
relay services, which will greatly shorten the delay of 
satellite data transmission. 
The key technology of the BeiDou satellite as data relay 
service is the establishment of inter-satellite links. However, 
due to the complexity and dynamic characteristics of the 
satellite network topology, inter-satellite link (ISL) handoff 
problem becomes more serious [3]. No matter it is a multi-
layer satellite network, or a single-layer satellite network, the 
relative motion between satellites on different orbital planes, 
leads to the change of ISL is more frequent, and thus brings 
serious challenges for the design of network protocols [4]. 
Therefore, ISL design is an essential part of satellite network 
research, since it affects the overall performance of the 
network. Z. Wang proposed the positional relationship and 
the necessary conditions using two satellites to establish a 
permanent ISL [4]. Liu proposed the theoretical formula of 
the ISL performance of non-geostationary Earth orbit 
(NGEO), and analyzed the variation law of ISL performance 
with the change of constellation parameters [5]. Gao made a 
thorough study on satellite network geometry model, and 
deduced the equation of link distance and elevation angle [6].   
Based on the analysis of the geometric parameters between 
LEO and MEO satellite layer, L. Wang proposed an 
analytical formula of ISL spatial geometry parameters with 
time variation [7]. However, these studies did not take into 
account the effect of relay satellites in different orbit altitude. 
We proposed triple-layered satellite network architecture 
based on BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, and analyzed 
inter-satellite connectivity and elevation angle to investigate 
the possibility of BDS satellites serving as relay satellites in 
this paper.  
The rest of the article is structured as follows: In section 
II, the network architecture of BeiDou Navigation Satellite 
System is studied and dynamic topology network model is 
proposed; in section III, a comparison is discussed among 
satellites of different orbits to serve as relay satellites; in 
section IV, the performance of BeiDou Navigation Satellite 
System is analyzed. Finally, the conclusion and future work 
are given in section V.

ANALYSIS AND MODELING OF SPACE INFORMATION 
SYSTEM STRUCTURE  
The topology of Spatial Information System is the basis 
of information exchange and sharing, and it is also the 
primary problem to be faced by dynamic network topology. 
In this section, a triple-layered MEO/IGSO/GEO satellite 
network architecture serving as relay satellites based on 
BeiDou Navigation Satellite System is studied firstly, and

the spatial information system of satellite network 
architecture is analyzed. 
A. Structure Analysis of Spatial Information System  
The space segment of BeiDou Navigation Satellite 
System is constituted of MEO group satellites, IGSO 
satellites and GEO satellites. The spatial information system 
can be regarded as triple-layered satellite network structure 
shown in Figure 1. It is composed of the MEO constellation, 
IGSO constellation, GEO constellation and ground stations. 
Ground stations communicate with each other via wired 
networks. 
 
 
Figure 1.  Satellite network structure with MEO / IGSO / GEO 
According to the design of BeiDou satellite constellation, 
the whole spatial information systems can be divided into 
three satellite layers. 
 
GEO layer. Geosynchronous orbit lies directly over 
the equator and the satellite in the orbit is relatively 
stationary to the Earth. GEO satellite network has 
advantages over fewer switching, simple control of 
satellite tracking and global coverage. Suppose the 
total number of satellites in GEO layer is

GEO satellite is expressed as

 
IGSO layer. IGSO was designed primarily to meet 
the needs of the information transmission for Polar 
areas. IGSO satellites have the same orbital altitude 
as GEO satellites; therefore they possess the same 
orbital period as the Earth’s rotation period. IGSO 
constellation possesses a high efficiency use of the 
regional constellation, ranging between GEO and 
MEO. Suppose the total number of IGSO satellites 
is

 
MEO layer. The visibility time of single MEO 
satellite up to 1h ~ 2h. Although the two-hop 
transmission delay is longer than LEO satellite, 
concerning the entire length of the inter-satellite 
links, on-board processing ability and other factors, 
the delay performance of MEO constellation may be 
better than LEO constellation. Relative to LEO 
constellation, MEO constellation owns a lower 
switching probability, reduced Doppler Effect, 
simplified space control system and antenna tracking 
system. Suppose the total number of MEO satellites 
is

. Triple-layer satellite network 
maintains three types of full-duplex links. 
Inter satellite link is the foundation of satellite 
communication, and ground station establishes a data link 
connection to the satellite when it is in the coverage of the 
satellite. 
B. Dynamic Topology Modeling of Spatial Information 
System  
The body of BeiDou Navigation Satellite System is 27 
MEO satellites, which are distributed in 3 orbital planes 
according to the walker constellation. Assuming that the 
configuration code of a Walker constellation is N / P / F, 
which respectively corresponds to the number of satellites, 
orbital plane number and phase factor [8]. Configuration 
code of MEO constellation in BeiDou Navigation Satellite 
System is: 27/3/1, that is, there are three orbital planes, each 
of which has nine satellites, and the phase factor is 1. The 
right ascension and angular distance of the ascending node 
are described by (1), in the equation i  represents the number 
of plane while j represents the number of satellite in one 
orbit plane.

Multi-layer satellite ISL connectivity is determined by 
the running status of satellites, at the same time, the Earth 
and the atmosphere covered the ISL, so orbit altitude and 
satellite distribution should be taken into consideration when 
designing satellite constellation, making it possible to obtain 
more inter satellite visible time. In judging whether the Earth 
will obstruct to the ISL, the ISL protection clearance should 
be taken into consideration as well [9]. Assuming that H is 
the protection clearance, and d is the distance between ISL 
and the center of the Earth, to meet the satellite ISL is not 
covered, H and d should satisfy (10).

TOPOLOGY NETWORK SIMULATION AND ANALYSIS 
In the simulation experiment, BeiDou satellites are 
selected as the relay satellites; the monitoring satellite lies in 
low Earth orbit is selected as the access satellite; three 
ground stations, Beijing, Sanya and Mudanjiang are selected 
as data receive station. A comparison is discussed among 
satellites of different orbits to serve as relay satellites in the 
possibility of link establishment and elevation angle. 
A. GEO Satellites as Relay Satellite  
Geostationary satellite lies in high orbit position, and its 
relative position is stable regardless of the Earth's movement, 
its relatively static properties make it possible for GEO 
satellite to serve as a data relay satellite. As is shown in 
Figure 3, the visibility between GEO satellites and three 
ground stations is permanent, so only the visibility between 
LEO and GEO satellites needs to be considered, then we can 
determine the feasibility of the inter satellite link.

In Figure 3, LEO satellite can establish a long time inter 
satellite link with GEO satellites. Total coverage time 
between LEO and GEO satellites is 82341s, accounting for 
95.30% of the total time, and each of 5 GEO satellites has a 
long time visibility, the shortest time is 64317s, accounting 
for 74.50% of the total time. GEO satellites are able to 
establish more permanent connection to the LEO satellite. 
For the most of time, more than one GEO satellite exists in 
the visibility range of the LEO satellite, the selection 
between satellites depends on the visibility time in order to 
reduce handover. Due to the high orbital position, inter-
satellite links do not exist between GEO satellites. The 
elevation angle between LEO satellite and single GEO 
satellite is shown in Figure 4, changes periodically. 
B. IGSO Satellite as Relay Satellite  
IGSO satellite shares the same orbit altitude with GEO 
satellite. Different from GEO satellites, due to the orbital 
plane is inclined; its star point track on the Earth surface is 
‘8’ shaped, and this kind of satellite make up for the 
deficiency of the GEO satellite’s incomplete coverage in 
polar areas. Adopting IGSO satellite as a relay satellite, 
single satellite cannot achieve full-time coverage to the 
ground station, but 3 satellites working together can achieve 
full-time coverage; Figure 5 shows the visibility between 
LEO satellite and IGSO satellites. 
 
Figure 5.  LEO satellite - IGSO satellite visibility  
 
Figure 6.  Elevation Angle between LEO satellite and IGSO satellite  
As is shown in Figure 5, total coverage time between 
LEO and IGSO satellites is 81485 s, accounting for 94.31% 
of the total time. Due to the business characteristics of 
observation satellite, data from Polar Regions is particularly 
significant. IGSO satellites can provide data relay services 
for blind area [11], where GEO satellite failed to provide 
total coverage in polar areas. However, as is shown in Figure 
6, the elevation angle between LEO satellite and single 
IGSO satellite stays in a high level compared changes with 
GEO satellites, which is benefit to the establishment of high-
quality ISLs. 
C. MEO Satellites as Relay Satellite  
The problem will be more complicated when the MEO 
satellite group serves as relay satellites. Two types of ISLs, 
intra-plane ISL and inter-plane ISL exist in MEO 
constellation, intra plane ISL connecting satellites within the 
same orbit and inter-plane ISL connecting satellites in 
adjacent orbits [12]. 
1) Analysis of  ISLs in MEO constellation  
In circular orbit satellite constellation, the distance 
between adjacent satellites is constant within same obit plane; 
but the length of inter-plane ISL is alterable periodically 
according to the satellite network topology. Figure 7 shows 
the distance of intra-plane ISL and inter-plane ISL if 
ij
Sat  is 
used to denote the orbit number of the satellite j in planei . 
 
Figure 7.  MEO-MEO ISLs analysis 
As is shown in Figure 7, the distance between 
11
Sat  and 
12
Sat  is stable, about 19088 km, and the distance between 
11
Sat  and 
21
Sat  changes periodically, the distance between 
satellites is different because of the existence of phase factor 
and the inclination of the orbit. Multi-ISLs could be 
established while the visibility is constrained, but this will 
greatly increase the system cost and receive low profits. In 
the existing satellite system, only the Iridium constellation 
[13] uses ISL technology: two intra-plane ISLs and two 
inter-plane ISLs. The Iridium system using polar orbit 
satellite constellation, which makes inter-plane ISLs stable, 
and satellite antenna tracking can be realized reliably. 
2) Visibility analysis bewteen MEO satellite group and 
LEO satellite  
The same with IGSO satellite, single MEO satellite could 
not cover ground stations at any time, but MEO satellite 
group working together can achieve full-time coverage. In 
the MEO constellation, satellites are evenly distributed in 3 
orbital planes. The visibility analysis between LEO satellite 
and satellites in one orbital plane can represent the whole 
constellation. Figure 8 shows the visibility between LEO 
satellite and MEO satellites in one orbital plane.

Figure 9.  Elevation Angle between LEO satellite and MEO satellite  
As is shown Figure 8, due to the shelter of the Earth, full-
time ISL could not be established between LEO satellite and 
single MEO satellite, but for one orbit plane in the MEO 
satellite constellation, full-time ISL could be established, and 
be able to ensure that at least 5 MEO satellites in the LEO 
visibility range and this number goes up to 15 for the whole 
constellation. 
Figure 9 shows the elevation angle between LEO 
satellites and MEO satellites, and the angle stays in low level 
for the most of time compared with GEO satellites. 
Moreover, MEO satellites do not possess the strong ability as 
GEO satellite, complicated antenna tracking technology and 
strong communication ability are required. 
 
IV. 
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS  
In this section, the experiment parameters are given 
firstly, and then the performance of relay satellites in 
different orbits is analyzed especially in satellite connectivity. 
A. Data Trasmission Without Relay Satellite 
The BeiDou satellite constellation consists of 5 GEO 
satellites and 30 non-GEO satellites, which contains 27 MEO 
satellites and 3 IGSO satellites. 27 MEO satellites are evenly 
distributed on three orbit planes, and every 9 satellites are 
evenly distributed in an orbit; the monitoring satellite lies in 
low orbit, as a data collecting satellite. Specific parameters 
are shown in Table I.

Figure 10 shows the visibility between LEO satellite and 
ground stations, as we can see from the figure, the visible 
time between the satellite and the ground station is very short. 
The time for LEO satellite to cover ground stations is 9023 s, 
accounting for 10.44% of the total time, and in the rest of the 
time, the link is failed to establish. So, for a long period of 
time, data could not be transmitted to the ground station, and 
the satellite needs to transmit the data to ground stations until 
the satellite cross the border again. In this situation, limited 
resources of the satellite will be occupied and the burden on 
satellite will be increased when the satellite cross the border 
again. 
 
Figure 10.  LEO satellite- Ground  visibility 
From the visibility analysis between LEO satellite and 
ground stations, it is concluded that only the satellite and the 
ground station satisfy visibility conditions, inter satellite link 
could be established. However, the establishment of the inter 
satellite link is related to the quality of the channel, the 
antenna elevation and so on, so the visibility between the 
satellite and the ground station is the necessary condition for 
the inter satellite link. At the same time, observation 
satellites are mostly polar orbiting satellites, whose running 
speed are fast and orbital altitude are relatively low. From 
Figure 10, we can see that covering time of three ground 
stations is relatively concentrated, which is due to geography, 
political and other factors limit the choice of the ground 
station’s location. In a lot of spare time, satellite data cannot 
be transmitted in real time, meanwhile, due to characteristics 
of satellite service, launching a large number of satellites will 
greatly increase the cost of system. 
B. Data Trasmission with Relay of BeiDou Satellites  
Through the analysis of the previous sections, it is 
concluded that using BeiDou navigation satellite system as 
the relay of observation satellites can greatly reduce the 
latency of satellite data transmission, and can achieve the 
timely transmission of satellite data in the absence of new 
ground stations. Due to the fact that relay satellites could 
achieve full-time coverage to the ground stations, the 
feasibility of data transmission depends on the visibility time 
between satellites. In this paper, we mainly discuss single 
layer satellites serving as relay satellites, since multi-layer 
relay satellites would perplex the problem and increase the 
system cost. Table II shows the result of analysis and 
comparisons by using GEO satellites, IGSO satellites, MEO 
satellites as relay satellites respectively.

The model we proposed focuses on the link distance and 
elevation angle, and these two factors are fundamental for 
link establishment. Surely, more factors should be 
considered when judging whether the link could be 
established, such as perturbation of the orbit, antenna

tracking, etc. And these should be considered in a more 
complicated model. 
   From the perspective of the feasibility of establishing a 
link, GEO, IGSO and MEO satellites can provide long-term 
visibility. So, the use of relay satellites can solve the problem 
that LEO satellite could not transfer data to ground stations 
when it’s not in the visibility zones. 
When GEO or IGSO satellites serve as relay satellites, 
the transmission delay will be large, since the distance of ISL 
is long. Therefore, for real-time data transmission, MEO 
satellites will be better choice. However, in the current 
BeiDou satellite system network architecture, the link 
bandwidth of ISLs is rather small and can’t meet the 
acquirement of large-scale data transmission. Compared to 
MEO satellites, the number of GEO and IGSO satellites is 
small and only one hop that we can have data transmitted to 
the ground stations, the routing control is rather simple; on 
the contrary, this problem becomes complex when MEO 
satellites serving as relay satellites since there are more than 
one ISLs could be established between satellites at the same 
time. The satellite to be selected is under a series of 
criterions such as to choose the satellite with the greatest 
elevation angle to possess the best communication quality; 
the longest service time to minimize handoff times, etc. It 
will involve a series of more complex problems of satellite 
handoff. 
Experimental results indicate that the proportion of 
satellite visibility rises to 95.30% when GEO satellites serve 
as relay satellites. The GEO satellite has been widely used as 
a relay satellite around the world, due to its high orbit 
altitude and complex on-board processing capability; 
adopting IGSO satellites to serve as relay satellites solves the 
problem that GEO satellite has blind areas around Polar 
Regions; choosing MEO satellites serve as relay satellites 
could provide a full-time relay service. The number of 
visible satellites is 15 at least, so we can choose the best 
among them to achieve better service. Yet choosing MEO 
satellites as relay satellites faces many difficulties including 
complicated antenna tracking technology, complex on-board 
processing capability, and high system cost. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
BeiDou Navigation Satellite System is one of the most 
important navigation satellite systems in the world, and will 
provide global coverage in the future. Due to the limited 
space resources the new satellite has to be limited launching. 
So make use of existing satellites to complement new 
functions is a feasible solution. In this paper, the Inter-
Satellite Link based on BeiDou satellites is analyzed. Firstly, 
the network architecture of spatial information system 
studied, and the dynamic network topology model is 
proposed. Then, by simulation the running of BeiDou 
satellites, the connectivity features of ISLs were acquired. 
Meanwhile, the topology structure’s evolution laws of 
satellite network and a selection suggestion of relay satellites 
were also obtained by analyzing the simulation results. We 
will explore the more practical computing model of link 
distance by tracing and research handoff algorithm of ISL in 
MEO constellation to choose the optimal satellite to achieve 
acceptable relay performance in future work.
