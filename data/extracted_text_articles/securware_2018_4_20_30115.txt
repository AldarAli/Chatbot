Abstract—An information security system can be divided into
the administrator mode and the user mode, in terms of its
interface. This research can provide a way to achieve effective
results in terms of compliance with security policies through
division. In this paper, we propose a human-centric security
system
which
is
based
on
user-centered
security
(User
eXperience) interface. In particular, this study divides the user
layer by profiling using the UX methodology's personalization
method. Based on this, we apply the information security
system on a scenario-by-scene basis, and prepare the factors
that could cause difficulties in advance. The information
security system was able to confirm the increase of the
management level in terms of security policy compliance at the
user side, resulting in insight from various HCI (Human
Computer
Interaction)s
standpoints.
This
can
lead
to
meaningful
results
that
future
users
can
reference
in
information security systems that they can directly control.
Keywords- Usability; Compliance; Information Security
System.

INTRODUCTION
With
the
performance
improvement
in
computing
infrastructure and the increase in its complexity, there have
been numerous studies on how to solve the difficulties users
face in HCI (Human Computer Interaction) and the need for
a solution to the complexity from the perspective of the
human factor. A security system officer needs to pursue
user-personal security and help users feel comfortable with
security. According to the ‘Psychology of Security for the
Home Computer User’ released at the IEEE Symposium [1],
the current approach to security is not appropriate because it
overlooks the ease of use. In addition, the paper ‘The
Weakest Link Revisited [2]’ written on IEEE Security &
Privacy read that the weakest point from a corporate
security standpoint is the user. In other words, making
security more convenient for users can significantly upgrade
a corporate security level.
In this way, information security is approaching the
service concept for user's efficient business performance
from the aspect of enterprise business. This study aims to
present the direction of an effective information security
system by analyzing the result when the user improves
usability through information security as a service concept.

RELATED WORK
In terms of a study on HCI approach from the
perspective of information security, the NIST [3] has
developed a framework which can reduce user errors in a
control
system
from
the
usability
standpoint.
The
framework provides a common language and mechanism for
organizations to: (1) describe current cybersecurity status;
(2) describe their target state for cybersecurity; (3) identify
and prioritize opportunities for improvement within the
context of risk management; (4) assess progress towards the
target state; (5) foster communications among internal and
external stakeholders.
L. Jean Camp [4] suggested the privacy and mental
model for security (Figure 1). This model is used for the
effective
communication
regarding
the
environmental
aspects of risks and is operated to handle misinterpretations
for complicated risks. It cannot take care of everything, but
can help users have a better understanding using a certain
model. It is applicable to
physical security, medical
infections,
criminal
behavior,
economics
failure
and
warfare.
Figure 1. Security-Usability Threat Model
HCI security has evolved in a way to strengthen the
usability of user application from the perspective of
information security. Ronald [5] proposed the Security-
usability Threat Model (Figure 1) in consideration of HCI
extension in security. This study attempted to discuss its
application which can reinforce the usability of a security
system based on the HCI user methodology.
D. D. Woods [6] studied information processing by
humans in HCI and applied it to system design with a goal
of
maximizing
productivity.
It
applied
organizational
information security policy through profiling techniques
based on demographic characteristics. This study aimes at
classifying users through demographic profiling and then
categorizing the effects of information security policy.

In this study, we construct a map by grouping users
through user profile and interviewing the subjects, and
analyzing key points where users can experience difficulties
based on them. Based on this, we formulate the problems
that users face and draw the conclusion that a more user
friendly information system is needed by applying the
solution system.

METHOD
A. Information System Profiling
This study attempted to apply the HCI approach based
on the diagnosis of the parts which would be handled by
users in person in the past from the perspective of user
interface in a security system. In particular, it analyzes
security system services through profiling and journey maps
which can specify target users in terms of user experience.
One
obvious
approach
to
synthesizing
usability
engineering and securing systems is to apply established
procedures for enhancing usability to developing on existing
secure systems. Techniques for enhancing the usability of
software cover a wide range of fields and sophistication [8].
Contextual Design [9] uses in-depth studies of potential
users’ work habits and needs to determine initial product
goals.
Contextual Inquiry [9] provides usability testing on a
deployed product, where real users using the system in their
daily chores allow observers to record this use.
This study performs a classification through user
profiling before launching a case study and then categorizes
the type of security users. ‘K’ is a professional IT research
agency in which most users have a high level of knowledge
about IT. The age range varied widely. Then, the data was
divided into age and amount of information in a 2X2 format
and
profiled.

B. Information System Journey Map
A journey map [7] (Figure 2) has been widely used in
diverse fields as an analysis technique of user behavior
along with scenario mapping. To derive user pain points, it
is executed in the following procedure.
While there is no standardized approach or methodology
for
customer
journey
mapping,
a
survey
of
current
practitioners and an evaluation of surrounding literature
revealed four universal traits: (1) a team-oriented execution,
(2) a highly visual, nonlinear nature, (3) the use of touch-
points, and
(4) an emphasis on real customers and
consumers.
Figure 2. Journey Map (NN Group)
In this study, we made an IS Journey map for the security
system (Figure 3) based on the NN group map. As a result,
based on interviews with users, we found a point where we
can identify their difficulties.

C. Change of institutional Security Policy to Journey Map
‘K’ agency has performed security management in terms
of managerial security and technical security. From the
perspective of technical security, a centralized security
check solution had been applied. In 2015, however, such

policy improved in a way for users to be able to check
security indicators in person [10]. This change is significant
in two aspects: i) performance improvement after the
replacement of old facilities, ii) shift of a security system,
allowing a user to control the system in person. See TABLE
II.

‘K’ agency’s security policy is organized in a top-down
structure in which national and government-led security
policies are collectively delivered from the top to the
bottom. Therefore, the agencies at the bottom are always
under the influence of those on top. To increase the
flexibility of institutional security policies, a separate
guideline has been prepared to guide the users.
Users were positioned, as shown in Figure 4, to check
PC security vulnerability. First, vulnerability was assessed
through scores (out of 100 points). It was designed for a
central manager to set a target score and make users reach
the goal.
Figure 4. Check on PC Security Vulnerability by Scores
In addition, the level of PC security vulnerability was
classified by color to draw more attention from users. The
indicators in each sector were designed to be fixed in person
and applied as shown in Figure 4. In the case of interface
security, which is simply a change of screen, there is a case
of studying an efficient method for real-time monitoring of
security control [11]. However, below we show examples of
user-centered actual measurement and performance.
IV.
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
According to the application of a new security system, the
security policy of ‘K’ agency has brought the following
results in comparison to conventional policies (out of 100
points). While a security level (scores)
was low in
conventional systems, the related indicators have improved
as stated in TABLE IV through the improvement of a
security system and provision of user-centered security
services.
Score acquisition status was classified by the integration
score before (2015), the application year (2016), and the
operation (2017) for 1 year after application of security
system.

After the replacement of the security system, the scores
improved for most indicators. Until now, the policies have
gradually
improved.
According
to
the
significantly
improved indicators, compliance rates have increased,
focusing on the indicators which can be applied by users in
person after simple settings such as ‘screen saver setting’.
Then, most indicators were close to a perfect score. Finally,
complete content and organizational editing is done before
formatting.
The reason why the new system can acquire high scores
is that the integration score (Figure 4) can be checked
directly,
and
the
user
has
provided
convenience
for
confirming and taking security measures directly.
Based on the findings above, the following results were
obtained:
1) An easy-to-execute security policy was applied with
the application of policies by security of user group
(profiling).
2) Compliance rates increased after a shift from the
conventional centralized policy transferred from a little
understanding of security policies to a way for users to
check them in person.
3) The difficulties in applying security policies through a
journey map were supported in man-to-man format to
make them applied more easily.
A security system gains significant improvements after
analyzing user experience factors from a security service
perspective and applying profiling and user journey map as
a way of service methodology. As a result, it was able to
derive the following implications on the endpoint of future
security systems:
1) Realization of efficient security policies through
classification of major risks and vulnerability factors in a
collective application of security policies by a policy
indicator
2) Shift from the conventional centralized security
policy transfer to user-centered security service
3) Better understanding of users with the application of
service methodology.
V.
CONCLUSION
With the recent increase in security breaches due to the
vulnerability of user security, the importance of internal
security control aside from an outside attack has become
increasingly important [12]. Therefore, this study attempted
to derive the applications of a more efficient security system
through a better understanding of the users from a security
service perspective and service-methodology approach.
Escaping from conventional studies which focused on how
to reduce user errors from a human factor perspective, this
study discussed a way to increase the understanding of end-
users.
As a result, it is anticipated that the study results would
be useful in analyzing the end users’ intention to observe
security policies and establish a turning point with the
intention to reduce a security system manager’s workload.
In this paper, we propose to expand the scope of research
into a more specific security system by establishing a larger
scale and a standard in future research although it is limited
in the subject and scale of user profiling. In addition, there
might be further studies on the extension of a study scope
with
more
types
of
specific
security
systems
(user
vaccination) or a behavioral analysis on the users’ security
awareness to provide customized security services by user.
