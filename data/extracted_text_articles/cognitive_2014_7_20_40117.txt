Abstract—In an ambient assisted living environment, raw data 
can often be very noisy making is difficulty to interrupt by a 
decision and reasoning system.  To help reduce the effects of 
noise, we propose a decision and reasoning system which 
combines an interval fuzzy system and a self-organising fuzzy 
neural network (SOFNN) is presented in this paper. The 
method exploits the use of a trained standard SOFNN 
structure from a fuzzy neural network to initialise the 
proposed approach. Simulation results show that the proposed 
structure 
is 
more 
suitable 
for 
uncertain 
situations 
demonstrating a high level of robustness. 
Keywords- interval type-2 fuzzy system; self-organising fuzzy 
neural network; cognitive decisions; modelling capability;

INTRODUCTION 
 Robotic UBIquitous COgnitive Network (RUBICON) 
[16] is an EU project that aims to create a self-sustaining, 
self-organizing, learning and goal-oriented robotic ecology, 
which consists of four layers: Learning Layer, Control Layer, 
Cognitive Layer and Communication Layer. The Cognitive 
Layer obtains events from the Learning Layer and generates 
goals for the Control Layer. The Cognitive Layer is 
described in detail in [1] and includes a cognitive reasoning 
and decision module. 
The objective of the cognitive decision module is to 
generate decisions signal by integrating the status outputs 
determined by the cognitive reasoning module, taking into 
account current and historical information. These decision 
signals are then used to set the actual goals for the Control 
Layer so as to attempt to ensure that the RUBICON ecology 
behaves appropriately. Ultimately, the RUBICON system 
will be embedded in real environments where, potentially, 
the collected data will be noisy. To minimise the impact of 
noise and the inherent uncertainty of the generated status 
outputs, the decisions module is expected to show a high 
level of robustness. 
A Self-Organising Fuzzy Neural Network (SOFNN) has a 
degree of robustness [2][3]. However, the membership 
functions of a SOFNN are type-1 fuzzy systems, which are 
presented as crisp numbers. This limits the ability of the 
network to model uncertainty. Type-2 fuzzy sets have been 
extended from type-1 fuzzy sets by Zadeh [4] and are 
attracting increasing attention. The advantage of type-2 fuzzy 
systems is that the membership functions can be presented as 
a fuzzy set, not simply as crisp numbers. This enhances the 
ability of the network to handle the uncertainty in the rule 
base [5], which is vitally important for deployment in real 
applications, such as the RUBICON ecology. In this work, 
the combination of an interval type-2 fuzzy system and a 
SOFNN, denoted as SOFNN-IT2, has been proposed for the 
cognitive decision module. 
Background information on the SOFNN and an interval 
type-2 fuzzy system are presented in Section II. Section III 
presents the proposed SOFNN-IT2 learning method. 
Simulation results in Section IV are presented to verify the 
proposed method in terms of its modelling capability and 
robustness. The work is summarised in Section V. 
II. 
BACKGROUNDS 
A. Overview of SOFNN 
A Self-Organising Fuzzy Neural Network (SOFNN) [2] 
is a hybrid network which has the capability to model and 
forecast a complex nonlinear system. The SOFNN is a five-
layer network, namely, the input layer, the Ellipsoidal Basis 
Function (EBF) layer, the normalised layer, the weighted 
layer, and the output layer, as shown in Figure 1. 
 
Figure 1. Structure of SOFNN. 
 
In the EBF layer, each neuron is a T-norm of Gaussian 
fuzzy membership functions [2] belonging to the inputs of 
the network. Every Membership Function (MF), thus, has 
its own distinct centre and width, which means every neuron 
has both a centre vector and a width vector and the 
dimensions of these vectors are the same as the dimension

The SOFNN is thus constructed based on EBFs 
consisting of a centre vector and a width vector. The adding 
approach is based on the geometric growing criterion [6] 
and the  -completeness of fuzzy rules [7]. The pruning 
method is based on the Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) 
method [8] and depends on the second order derivative of 
the objective function with respect to the parameters of each 
neuron, i.e., the Hessian matrix [2]. The Hessian matrix can 
be easily obtained as part of the proposed on-line parameter 
learning algorithm. Further information on this network is 
available from [2] and [3].  
The SOFNN can be used for on-line learning and the 
adding and pruning strategies have the self-organising 
capability to produce a fuzzy neural network with a flexible 
structure that grows in order to minimise the training error. 
The SOFNN has demonstrated good performance in 
applications of function approximation, complex system 
identification, and time-series prediction [2] [3]. 
B. Interval Type-2 Fuzzy System 
An Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic System (IT2FLS) is 
shown in Figure 3. This is similar to a Type-1 FLS (T1FLS) 
containing a fuzzifier, rule base, fuzzy inference engine, and 
output processing. The main difference is that a type-2 FLS 
has a type-reducer in the output processing. The type-
reducer has the ability to generate a type-1 fuzzy set from a 
type-2 fuzzy set. The defuzzifier then can defuzzify this 
type-1 fuzzy set to a crisp number. IT2FLSs have 
demonstrated better ability to handle uncertainties than their 
type-1 counterparts [9].

SOFNN-IT2 LEARNING 
An algorithm combining SOFNN and IT2FLS has been 
developed for the cognitive decision module to attain a high 
level of robustness. The strategy for development exploits 
the following steps: 
1. A trained SOFNN structure, which is a type-1 
fuzzy structure, is obtained following learning. 
2. This type-1 fuzzy structure is then initialised as a 
type-2 fuzzy structure. 
3. The initialised type-2 structure is trained off-line, 
based on gradient descent and Kalman filter 
algorithms. The obtained type-2 fuzzy neural 
structure can be represented as a set of type-2 fuzzy 
rules similar to (4). 
4. The final output of the system can be generated 
after information has passed through type-
reduction and defuzzification. 
The method to obtain a SOFNN structure has been 
described in [2] and [3]. Details on attaining the final output 
of the system by type-reduction and defuzzification can be 
found in [12] and [13]. Steps 2 and 3 are outlined in the 
following sections. 
A. Initialise Type-1 Structure to Type-2 Structure 
The structure of the SOFNN can be represented as a set 
of type-1 fuzzy rules, for example

The proposed training algorithm, combining the gradient

iteration for each incoming training data and repeated for 
incremental offline learning. The trained type-2 fuzzy neural 
network is thus obtained. This network is employed as the 
RUBICON cognitive decision module to generate the 
decision signal to set the actual goals for Control Layer. 
IV. 
SIMULATION 
For the purposes of validating the approach, a 
synthesised dataset consisting of 4500 samples was used as 
input to the reasoning module [1], which generates the data 
needed for the decision module. These data describe typical 
events in a domestic environment, one of the application 
areas of the RUBICON project’s ecology. Figure 5 shows 
the inputs to the decision module are status outputs from the 
reasoning module [1], and the outputs of the decision

module (the SOFNN-IT2) are decision signals to set actual 
goals. The decision module receives 10 status outputs from 
the reasoning module plus an additional 10 one-step-back 
status outputs to make a combined set of 20 inputs. These 
status outputs are then categorised into 1 of 7 goals by the 
decision module. The status outputs and goal labels are 
listed in Table I and Table II, respectively.

A. Testing of Modelling Capability 
The first 3900 points of the data set were used as the 
training data of the decision module, and the remaining 600 
points as the testing data. Using the algorithm outlined in 
the previous section a type-2 structure, SOFNN-IT2, is then 
obtained. The results of training and testing of the SOFNN-
IT2 are shown in Table III, where RMSE is the Root Mean 
Square Error between the output of the network and the 
desired decision signal of the goal (i.e., target) and CD is the 
percentage of correct decision in terms of goals against 
desired goal data. Figures 6 to 8 give results of the decision 
signal of the goal, "Bring Drink for User", and type-2 
membership functions (MFs) of selected inputs.

Figure 9. Results of Bring Drink for User's decision goals. 
 
In Figure 6, the red line represents outputs of the 
decision model and the blue line represents targets. As an 
example, Figure 9 shows the results for the goal "Bring 
Drink for User". In Figure 9, the red line represents the 
goals obtained by the decision module and the blue line 
represents desired goals. In Figure 9, H is the high-level 
signal which triggers the actual goal, L is the low-level 
signal. Any decision signal with a confidence greater than 
0.5 is defined as the high-level goal data; otherwise it is 
defined as the low-level goal data. These results prove that 
the obtained type-2 system, SOFNN-IT2, has the capability 
to model the complex input-output relationship to achieve 
high accuracy decisions. 
B. Testing of Robustness 
To investigate the robustness of the type-2 network 
SOFNN-IT2, its type-1 counterpart network SOFNN is used 
for comparison. Inputs for the obtained SOFNN and 
SOFNN-IT2 structures are a combination of current and 
one-step-back historical data from the reasoning module. 
The 20 inputs are combined with white-noise to assess the 
robustness of both networks. White-noise is chosen from the 
different standard deviations listed in Table IV. Again, the 
RMSE is between the output with noise inputs and the 
output without noise inputs. Table IV provides the results 
for both the SOFNN and SOFNN-IT2 for the goal "Bring 
Drink for User".

Figure 11. Results of Bring Drink for User's decision goals. 
 
It is observed that the RMSEs of SOFNN and SOFNN-
IT2 decrease as the standard deviation of the white-noise is 
decreased. This means that the SOFNN and SOFNN-IT2 
both have a degree of robustness. For white-noise with 
  0.1
, the RMSEs of the SOFNN-IT2 for all outputs are 
smaller than those of the SOFNN and the CDs are similar. 
This illustrates that the SOFNN-IT2 is more robust to noise 
than the SOFNN. Furthermore, for increased white-noise, 
the CDs of the SOFNN-IT2 are better than those of the 
SOFNN, though the RMSEs of the SOFNN-IT2 are slightly 
larger than those of the SOFNN. These results show that, 
compared with its type-1 counterpart structure, the type-2 
structure is more suitable for addressing uncertain situations 
with a high level of robustness.

CONCLUSION 
A type-2 fuzzy neural network SOFNN-IT2, based on a 
SOFNN and interval type-2 fuzzy reasoning, has been 
proposed in this paper. The obtained type-1 SOFNN 
structure is firstly initialised to a type-2 SOFNN-IT2 
structure and then the final type-2 SOFNN-IT2 structure is 
generated by the proposed training algorithm. Extensive 
testing of the cognitive decisions module using this 
SOFNN-IT2 algorithm has demonstrated that the approach 
is highly robust to noise and that performance is improved 
(compared to the traditional SOFNN approach) when 
considerable noise or uncertainty is present in the inputs.  
This is a very important attribute for RUBICON as it will be 
deployed in a real world environment, and thus, subject to 
uncertainty and noisy inputs.
