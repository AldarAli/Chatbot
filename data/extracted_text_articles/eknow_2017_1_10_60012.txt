Abstract— This paper presents a cost/benefit analysis method 
for the normalization of business rules. To determine the economic 
benefit of business rules normalization three variables are 
addressed: 1) the number of anomalies a rule set endures, 2) the 
storage space a rule set requires and the 3) deterioration of rules 
in response time. The approach is evaluated by means of an 
experiment, based on mortgage data of an international bank. 
Results show that the method is useful for determining when to 
normalize business rule sets; the method enables business rules 
analysts 
to 
produce 
more 
cost-effective 
business 
rules 
architectures.

I. INTRODUCTION  
       Good decision making is a key denominator for a 
corporation’s competitiveness [2]. Therefore, organizations are 
increasingly urged to make fast and accurate decisions. At the 
same time, decisions are becoming more and more complex 
affecting maintainability and transparency. Decisions can be 
formulated by means of business rules [22]. A business rule is 
defined by Morgan [13] as: “a statement that defines or 
constrains some aspects of the business intending to assert 
business structure or to control the behavior of the business.” 
To realize changes within an organization’s decision-making 
process, an organization should be able to maintain the 
aforementioned asserts and it should be able to adapt its 
business rules efficiently and effectively to realize changes 
within its decision-making process. In order to realize this, 
information systems, such as expert systems, knowledge 
management systems, case based reasoning systems, fuzzy 
expert systems and business rules management systems have 
been built for and adopted by organizations [12].  
       Research on the management of business rules has been 
conducted since the mid-1960’s [12]. Distinct research streams 
have emerged, focusing on the following three subjects: 1) 
subject transformation, 2) platform transformation, and 3) 
business 
rule 
model 
transformation 
[21]. 
Subject 
transformation research focuses on processes, methods and 
information systems used for mining and cleansing decision 
sources, such as regulations, organizational policies, laws, 
documents and databases. The second stream focuses on the use 
of information technology for the deployment, execution and 
monitoring of business rules. Important research topics are: 1) 
algorithms for faster and easier execution, 2) business rules 
architectures, and 3) business rules engines [1][6][15]. Business 
rule model transformation research focuses on verification, 
validation and improvement of existing business rules. To 
verify business rules, a formal grammar notation and/or a set of 
constructs is applied. A grammar notation describes how a 
business rule should be constructed or formulated. An example 
of a standardized business rules grammar is the Semantics of 
Business Vocabulary and Business Rules [16]. 
       Despite the accumulation of literature, there is a 
surprisingly scarce amount of research that examines methods 
and processes to factor business rules [22]. Factoring entails the 
process of dividing business rules, and therefore decisions, in 
more 
comprehensible 
structural 
elements 
to 
increase 
maintainability and transparency. Research that has focused on 
this subject is “single language oriented” [21][22][23]. Since a 
relatively high number of business rules modelling languages 
exist within scientific and professional literature, a factoring 
procedure per language is not desired from the viewpoint of the 
authors. Furthermore, current research does not provide 
guidelines to financially quantify the value of factoring 
business rules. As far as the authors are aware, no method exists 
that is business rules modelling language-independent in 
combination with quantifying the financial benefits of factoring 
given business rules. An example is the work of [23] which 
solely focuses on achieving the third normal form while 
factoring business rules, without investigating whether this is 
financially optimal. Given the fact that organizations invest 
large amounts of money for implicitly managing business rules, 
a valid question is whether and when an explicit factoring 
procedure is economically beneficial. For example, a business 
rule set, which only changes or is executed twice a year might, 
from an economic perspective, is better off in an un-factored 
form. Taken previous statements into account, the following 
research question arose: “How can business rules be factored 
such that economic beneficial manageability is realized?” 
Following Van Thienen and Snoeck's [18] research on factoring 
decision tables and Zoet’s [22] research on factoring business 
rules, we adopt relational theory to factor business rules. 
       The current study extends previous research by developing 
a factoring method that incorporates mainstream rule modeling 
languages and guidelines to determine the cost and revenue of

(re-)factored business rules. We developed a factoring method 
and validated it by means of an experiment based on case study 
data at a large international bank. The results showed that our 
method is effective in determining the economic costs and 
benefits. 
        In section two, we provide a discussion on the theoretical 
foundations of factoring business rules in terms of relational 
theory, normalization and economic factors. This is followed 
by the construction of the method in section three. In section 4 
we demonstrate the application of the method on mortgage 
decision making at a large international bank. We conclude this 
paper, in section five, with the study’s core findings, 
contributions as well as its limitations. 
II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 
       There are few methods available to (re-)factor business 
rules [22]. Currently, two different methods are described: one 
by Van Thienen and Snoeck [18] and one by [22]. Van Thienen 
and Snoeck's [18] method has two underlying assumptions (1) 
business rules are specified in decision tables and (2) relational 
theory is the basis for normalizing business rules. Guidelines 
are proposed to factor decision tables, thereby improving 
maintainability. However, instead of formulating one common 
procedure they proposed multiple exceptions to the normal 
form. These exceptions have to be formulated, which is an 
implicit result of the foundation of their research namely the use 
of decision tables. The second method proposed by [22] also 
takes relation theory into account. Moreover, this method 
distinguishes itself by applying one common procedure, which 
can be used for several languages. 
       The definition of the term relational as used in this paper is 
adopted from the mathematical domain, more specifically from 
the relational algebra theory [4]. Relational algebra theory has 
received a lot of attention during the last four decades, since it 
is popularized by Codd [4] for database normalization. The 
basic idea of the relational algebra theory involves that a 
relationship (R) can exist of a given set of elements (Sn), 
visualized as follows: R = (S1, S2, ..., Sn) [4]. The elements 
(Sn) can be condition- or conclusion-facts. Most authors [4][9] 
represent element sets by applying two-dimensional arrays. In 
order to apply relational theory on business rules, one must be 
able to translate business rules to sets of relationships. Previous 
research has answered the question [22] whether current 
business rule modelling languages can be translated to unified 
views by applying relational algebra theory. Based on 
representational difference analysis, the authors show that the 
six most common business rules languages can be transformed 
to sets of relations. Representational difference analysis is a 
technique, which is used to identify differences and overlap 
between concepts or constructs in ontology’s, languages and 
visual syntax [8] zur Muehlen and Indulska [20]. The six 
languages which were examined during this study are: If-Then 
business rules [17], Decision Tables [10] Van Thienen and 
Snoeck [18], Decision Trees [3], Score Cards [14], Event, 
Condition & Action Business Rules [5], and Event Condition 
Action Alternative Business Rules [7]. By translating business 
rules to relations between specific sets of elements, 
normalization is made possible. Normalization is the process of 
removing partial dependencies and transitive dependencies 
[4][9]. 
III. METHOD CONSTRUCTION 
         A detailed explanation of the business rules normalization 
procedure can be found in [22]. However, to ground our 
research, a summary of the normalization procedure is provided 
in sub-section A. Subsequently, in sub-section B, we described 
the cost reduction analysis method for business rules 
normalization. 
A. Business Rules Normalization Procedure 
         The process for business rules normalization consists of 
three activities. The results of these activities are (1) the 
transformation of business rules to the proper relational 
structure, and (2) the removal of partial and (3) the removal of 
transitive dependencies. The latter is realized by applying the 
third normal form, while the second normal form deals with 
partial dependencies and the 1st normal form deals with 
achieving the proper structure for business rules. 
         The first normal form is realized by duplicating the 
original business rules equally often as the amount of 
conclusion-facts that exist. In other words, all of the duplicated 
rules exist of all condition- and conclusion-fields. The 
difference between the original and new tables is that only one 
of the original conclusion-fields is now still a conclusion-field 
while the others are condition-fields. In order for a relation to 
be in the second normal form, all condition-facts must be 
functionally dependent on a conclusion-fact and adhere to the 
first normal form. Condition-facts, which are not fully 
dependent on the conclusion-fact must be deleted or added to 
another relationship. The second normal form reveals whether 
condition-facts are included that actually do not contribute to a 
conclusion. To realize the third normal form in business rules, 
condition-facts that are not fully dependent on the conclusion-
fact (but on another condition fact) should be removed and 
added to a new relation. The new relation contains the removed 
condition-facts, as well as the conclusion-fact to which they are 
related. A relationship is established between two sets of 
relations by means of a secondary decision. After applying the 
third normal form, all specified relations do not contain any 
repeating 
groups, 
partial 
dependencies 
and 
transitive 
dependencies anymore. 
       To visualize the normalization procedure a decision tree 
can be used [19]. A decision tree consists of two types of nodes: 
1) normalization decision nodes (squares) and 2) end nodes 
(circles), for example see Fig. 1. A normalization decision node 
represents the decision to further normalize the relationship. 
From a normalization decision node, two types of branches can 
emerge: 1) a stop branch, and 2) a normalization branch. A stop 
branch emerges when further normalization is not needed, 
consequently leading to an end node. When further 
normalization is needed, two or more normalization branches 
emerge from the decision node. These branches lead to other 
decision 
nodes 
representing 
the 
newly 
normalized 
relationships.

        End nodes do not have further identification information, 
whereas normalization decision nodes do. Each node starts with 
the capital letter R, which is an abbreviation for relationship. 
The digit before the decimal point shows the number of the 
relationship. In case two digits are included before the comma, 
it designates a relationship resulting from another relationship. 
Furthermore, the digit after the decimal point indicates in what 
normalization form the relationship resides. In our example (see 
Fig. 1), the node R1,2 means that relationship 1 is in the second 
normal form. Moreover, the nodes R11,3 and R12,3 are both in 
the third normal form and are a relationship resulting from 
R1,2.

B. Cost Reduction Analysis Method for Business Rules 
Normalization 
Currently, in most normalization procedures the decision to 
normalize is generally based on intuitive flair. It remains 
uncertain whether the normalization effort is economically 
beneficial. For example, from an economic perspective, a 
business rule set, which only changes twice a year may not be 
beneficial to normalize. 
Lee [11] and Westland [19] have conducted research 
towards the cost reduction of database normalization, which is 
based on relational theory. Cost reductions realized by database 
normalization are 1) decreased machine time, and 2) decreased 
data-inconsistencies (avoiding loss of business). The three main 
drivers of cost reduction are a) reduced anomalies, b) reduced 
storage requirements, and c) deteriorated response time. 
Anomalies that occur to data are: update-anomalies, insert-
anomalies and deletion-anomalies [4]. Previous research has 
shown that database normalization principles can be applied to 
business rule sets [22]. Taken previous statement into account, 
the following question arose: Can the cost reduction model from 
database normalization be adopted as well? 
Before adopting and adapting the model for business rules 
normalization, first the fit between the database determinants 
and business rules determinants has to be investigated. First, 
both the relations of data and business rules need to be updated 
and deleted, and new data or business rules have to be inserted. 
Second, previous research [11] has shown that business rules 
normalization can also lead to fewer storage requirements, such 
as the case is with database normalization. Thirdly, deteriorated 
response time is an important issue since decision making in 
organizations is increasingly complex with for example 
predictive analytics. As such, we can adopt the formulas 
proposed by Lee [11]. However, before the formulas can be 
used, the variables need to be adapted towards business rules. 
The remainder of this section will discuss the formulas provided 
by Lee altered towards business rules. 
The cost reduction realized by normalization is calculated in 
four phases 1) cost reduction due to reduced anomalies, 2) cost 
reduction due to reduced storage space, 3) cost increase due to 
increased join processing, and 4) comparing cost reduction due 
to reduced anomalies and cost reduction due to reduced storage 
space with the cost increase due to increased join processing. 
Let ф be the cost reduction due to reduced anomalies, see 
also equation 1. We define ф as: 
 
ф = ∑

𝑈 𝜆𝑀
𝑈  ώ𝑀

Equation 1.     Cost reduction due to reduced anomalies 
 
Where 𝑁𝑢, 𝑁𝑖, and 𝑁𝑑 are the number of updates, number 
of inserts and number of deletions, respectively, 𝜆𝑀
𝑈 , 𝜆𝑀
I  and 𝜆𝑀
D  
denote the frequency of the m’th update, the m’th insertion and 
the m’th deletion. The average number of business rules affected 
by the update, insertion and deletion are denoted by ώ𝑀
𝑈 , ώ𝑀
I and 
ώ𝑀
𝐷 . Furthermore, 𝛼𝑀
𝑈 , 𝛼𝑀
I  and 𝛼𝑀
𝐷  denote the cost for each 
insert, update and deletion.  
Let 𝜓 be the cost reduction due to reduced storage space, see 
also equation 2. We define 𝜓 as: 
 
𝜓 = 𝐵ώ − 𝐵𝑥 ώ𝑥 − 𝐵𝑦ώ𝑦 
Equation 2.     Cost reduction due to reduced storage space 
 
Where B represents the storage cost per business rule in the 
current normalized situation. 𝐵𝑥 and 𝐵𝑦 denote the storage cost 
per business rule in the normalized situation + 1. The number of 
business rules stored in the current normalization situation is 
depicted by ώ, while the normalized situation + 1 is depicted by 
ώ𝑥 and ώ𝑦. 
Let 𝛺 be the cost increase due to increased join processing, 
see also equation 3. We define 𝛺 as: 
 
𝛺 = ∑
Ϋ𝑚
∅
𝑀=1
𝑥,𝑦∈𝑜𝑚
 𝜇𝑚 ώ𝑥 ώ𝑦 
Equation 3.     Cost increase due to increased joint processing 
 
Where Ø is the number of joins required to determine the 
conclusion of a specific decision. ϔm denotes the cost per 
execution per business rule for join M. Moreover, μm represents 
the frequency of join M. The time to realize the join is depicted 
by ώx and ώy. The business rule sets (x and y) between which the 
join M is realized, is denoted by x, y, ϵ om. Let O be the cost 
reduction from normalization form R (R1,2) to normalization 
form R+1 (R11,3). We define O = ф + ψ ≥ Ω. O can be either 
positive or negative. If O is positive, then normalization should 
be applied. 
IV. EXPERIMENT SETUP 
        In our validation, we apply an experiment on case study 
data. This allows us to use data from an actual case while fully 
controlling the execution of the method and input variables. The 
method is applied to a mortgage decision of an Anonymous 
International Bank (AIB). Our choice to select this case study 
setting was based on two theoretical criteria. Firstly, the case 
had to provide a proper amount of business rules used to take a 
R1,2 
R11,3 
R12,3 
3

decision. The mortgage decision at AIB consisted of 665 facts 
(conditions and conclusions), and 1479 individual business 
rules. Secondly, the organization had to be willing to provide 
the financial details needed to perform the calculations. AIB 
agreed to this, however, with two demands. The first demand 
implied that their name and financial data were altered when it 
would be published. The second demand entailed that the 
applied business rule sets were not published. Since space 
limitations do not allow to walk through the entire mortgage 
decision and normalization procedure, both demands are met.

Figure 3.    Photo impression 2 of normalized business rules 
The evaluation, by means of conducting an experiment, was 
divided into three phases. Phase one was used to make the 
researchers familiar with the case parameters, by analyzing 133-
pages with descriptions of decisions for completeness and 
accuracy. This phase resulted in the identification of multiple 
gaps. With the help of additional documentation and experts 
these gaps have been fixed. During the second phase, the 
business rules have been normalized according to our method. 
This normalization was done on paper after which the results 
were presented on a big wall (see Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). During the 
normalization, additional gaps were identified. These gaps have 
been marked with “post-its”, see Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. Again, with 
the help of additional documentation and experts, these gaps 
have been filled. 
V. APPLICATION OF THE METHOD 
      To ground our method, we explain the determination of the 
cost reduction from normalization form R to normalization 
form R+1 for the business rule set “personal situation of 
applicant” from the case described in the previous section. The 
business rule set exists of 10 facts, 1 conclusion fact and 8 
condition facts; see left side of Fig. 4. The question that needs 
to be answered before normalizing this business rule set is: 
“Does normalizing the business rule set from R to R+1 realize 
a cost reduction?” 
 
 
 
Figure 4.     Decision tables to determine judgment personal situation 
 
      The decision personal situation is mainly affected by update 
and insert anomalies. For example, the facts “judgment age” 
and “judgment age savings” are updated regularly. Insert 
anomalies occur when new type of rules for age determination 
are inserted. The application of the method exist out of four 
phases 1) determine benefits in terms of reduced anomalies, 2) 
determine savings of storage requirements and 3) determine 
effect on response time, and 4) comparing cost reduction due to 
reduced anomalies and cost reduction due to reduced storage 
space with the cost increase due to increased join processing. 
       During phase one, three steps can be distinguished. Step 
one: determine the type of update, insert and deletion 
operations on a specific business rule set. In our case, “update 
judgment age” and “insert age determination rule”. For each 
identified operation type, it should be determined if the 
operation is affected by anomalies. If anomalies do not occur, 
normalization is not needed at all. If anomalies do occur, the 
frequency of each operation type and the number of business 
rules that are affected should be determined, this corresponds 
to step two. In this specific case 𝜆1
U = 7 (/per 2 weeks), and 𝜆2
U 
= 6 (/ per 2 weeks). Additionally, the number of business rules 
affected by each update needs to be determined. In this specific 
case ώ1
U = 2 and ώ2
U = 1.5. During step three, the cost of an 
anomaly should be determined. In this case, the cost of a person

that adjusts the specific business rules 𝛼1
U = €35.00 per instance 
and 𝛼2
U = €52.50 per instance, see also equation 4. So, the total 
benefit due to reduced number of anomalies is: 
 
ф = (35 ∗ 7 ∗ 2) + (52.5 ∗ 6 ∗ 1.5) = €962.50 
Equation 4.     Total benefit due to reduced anomalies 
 
       The first step of phase two is to determine the results of the 
transformation in terms of business rule sets. In this case, one 
business rule set (personal situation) is divided into three 
business rule sets namely 1) judgment personal situation, 2) 
judgment age, and 3) judgment internationality. The results of 
the normalization are shown in Fig. 3. For each business rule 
set, the number of business rules must also be determined, in 
this case, respectively, ώ = 20, ώ𝑥= 2, ώ𝑦= 3, ώ𝑧= 6. During 
the second step, the cost per stored business rule must be 
determined. This needs to be determined for the current 
situation as well as for the post normalization situation. This 
information was retrieved from the information technology 
department, in this case, respectively, 𝛣 = €4, 𝛣𝑋 = €0,5, 𝛣𝑦 =
€0,5  and 𝛣𝑧  = €0,75. Duplications are removed, thereby 
decreasing the number of individual business rules, see also 
equation 5. The total benefit due to reduced number of 
anomalies is: 
 
𝜓 = 20 ∗ 4 −  2 ∗ 0.5 − 3 ∗ 0.5 − 4 ∗ 0.75 = €73.00 
Equation 5.     Total benefit due to reduced number of anomalies 
 
       To form a decision, two joins are required in the new 
situation, so ∅ =2. The cost for each join Ϋ𝑚 = 0.015. The 
execution frequency of the join is 4000 per two weeks (𝜇𝑚), see 
also equation 6. The additional cost due to additional join 
operations (𝛺) is therefore: 
 
𝛺 = 0.015 * 4000 * (2 + 3 + 6) = €660.00 
Equation 6.     Total additional cost due to additional join operations 
 
       In conclusion, further normalization for the decision 
personal situation is recommended since (962.50 + 73.00) > 
€660.00. Assume a situation where 𝜆1
U = 7(/per 2 weeks), 𝜆2
U= 
6 (/ per 2 weeks) are decreased to 𝜆1
U = 2(/per 2 weeks), 𝜆2
U = 2 
(/ per 2 weeks). Applying these changes reduces ф  from 
€962,50 to €446,25, which changes O from (962.50 + 73.00) > 
€660.00 to (446.25 + 73.00) < €660.00 in which case further 
normalization would not realize a cost reduction. 
        The above example has shown a situation in which 
normalization leads to cost reduction and therefore the 
normalization should occur. By changing two parameters, we 
showed that normalization would lead to a negative cost 
reduction therefore an increase in cost and normalization should 
not be performed. 
VI. EXPERIMENT VALIDITY 
      Internal validity threats, when conducting controlled 
experiments, can be classified into nine categories: 1) 
ambiguous temporal precedence, 2) selection, 3) history, 4) 
maturation, 5) regression, 6) attrition, 7) testing, 8) 
instrumentation, and 9) additive and interactive effect of threats 
to internal validity (Shadish et al., 2002). Ambiguous temporal 
precedence indicates a lack of clarity of variable occurrence, 
thereby influencing the cause and effect relation. In our 
research, temporal precedence occurs when decisions are 
transformed from source code to business rules management 
systems. The cost to realize an anomaly within the source code 
is higher compared to changing a business rule in a business 
rules management system. To reduce the temporal precedence, 
the source code was first transformed to be applicable for the 
business rules management systems, after which normalization 
took place. We can ensure that the learning effect was not 
present during our case. Given the fact that all four subjects who 
have participated in the experiment, already had executed the 
business normalization procedure before. Furthermore, the 
economical beneficially calculation itself was made explicit in 
Excel and required the respondents only to enter the variables. 
We cannot exclude learning during the transformation of the 
case information to the relational representation. Selection, 
history, maturation, attrition, instrumentation and additive and 
interactive effects of threats to internal validity are excluded 
due to the experiment setup. 
       Outcomes of an experiment can vary when subjects, tasks 
or the environment changes. External validity is concerned with 
the extension of variations on such changes (Shadish et al, 
2002). Our results were obtained from one decision: a mortgage 
decision. Therefore, we cannot claim that our conclusions are 
generally applicable. However, the answer to the research 
question itself is not influenced by the fact that only one case 
has been analyzed. Our experiment has been applied outside the 
project life cycle of AIB. We do not consider this as a threat to 
environmental validity since the entire procedure can be 
repeated during normal project life cycles. 
VII. CONCLUSION 
        Business rules are a key denominator for a corporation’s 
competitiveness. Thereby, the management of such business 
rules is increasingly becoming more important. However, 
business rules are becoming more and more complex affecting 
maintainability and transparency. In order to properly structure 
business rules, normalization is applied. Normalization 
increases control over insertion, update and deletion anomalies 
affecting storage requirements and response time. Currently, 
the normalization procedure does not take the costs and benefits 
of normalization into account but is based on intuitive flair. 
Therefore, we defined the research question: How can business 
rules guiding decisions be factored such that economic 
beneficial manageability is realized? 
         We presented a cost/benefit formula that provides 
guidelines for normalizing business rules. To determine the 
normalization business case, three variables were addressed 1) 
the number of anomalies a business rule set endures, 2) the 
storage space a business rule set requires, and the 3) 
deterioration in response time. By means of an experiment 
based on case study data from an international bank, we have 
shown the applicability of the model. Results show the 
importance of properly normalized decisions and what role the 
5

cost and benefit analysis plays in this. On the one hand, 
modelers should attempt to properly factor business rules. To 
achieve this factoring, the three normalization forms can be 
applied. On the other hand, practitioners should take cost and 
benefits of the organization into account when applying such 
normalizations forms. Currently, the transformation of the 
business rules is performed manually. However, in future 
research we aim to develop an approach which applies an 
algorithm to re-write (transform) business rules for applying the 
method presented in this paper. Furthermore, future research 
should also focus on further validating the method presented in 
this paper using more cases, and ideally, cases from different 
industries in various sizes to improve its generalizability. 
         From a practical perspective, our study provides product 
engineers, business rules modelers and decision modelers with 
a method that can be used to normalize business rules based on 
an economic rationale. This rationale comprises the ideal fit 
between storage space utilization, anomaly management and 
execution costs. The method will enable organizations to guard, 
on the one hand, execution costs and, on the other hand, 
performance of business rules.
