Abstract—We examined the property of wind direction 
perception at the frontal region of the head to find a guideline 
for optimal wind source arrangement. In previous experiments, 
localized winds produced by a single compact fan were used as 
stimuli. Such a localized wind is rather different from the 
natural uniform wind in a real environment. Because the 
subjects might be able to judge the wind direction based on the 
facial 
region 
hit 
by 
the wind, 
the 
performance 
of 
discriminating the direction of a localized wind may be 
different from that for a uniform wind. Thus, in this study, we 
examined the human ability to discriminate the wind direction 
using a uniform wind that covered the entire face and 
compared the result with that for a localized wind. We 
measured the Just Noticeable Difference (JND) in wind 
direction perception and found that there was a significant 
difference between the JND for a uniform wind and that for a 
localized wind.

INTRODUCTION 
Recently, in the technical field of Virtual Reality (VR), 
systems that reproduce virtual environments using “wind 
sensation” have been developed. Wind sensation refers to a 
combination of sensations related to feeling the wind, which 
is considered to be a kind of haptic sensation [1]. By 
presenting non-contact stimulation to a user through a wind 
sensation, we expect the system to provide the user with a 
greater sensation of presence. Therefore, numerous systems 
incorporating wind displays have already been developed. 
For example, there are attractions in amusement parks that 
present a wind or fragrance with images and sound, e.g., 
“Soaring” 
[2] 
at 
Disney 
World. 
Movie 
theaters 
incorporating winds and scents, called “4DX,” are now in 
operation [3]. In addition, to provide the sensation of 
existing in a target environment, several studies using wind 
sensations have been conducted. For example, Suzuki et al. 
developed a system that provides air-jet-driven force 
feedback through a ladle-like handheld tool, which achieved 
an interaction with force feedback in an untethered manner 
[4]. Minakuchi proposed the use of wind gusts to help users 
notice and understand information such as determining the 
location of an information source based on the wind 
direction, where the importance of the information is 
represented by the air volume [5]. Sawada et al. developed 
BYU-BYU-View, which is an input/output interface that 
uses wind. When a user exhales toward a special screen, a 
wind emerges from another user’s screen. Thus, the user can 
utilize an application or communicate with a partner [6]. 
Furthermore, systems such as Windcube [7] and Immersive 
3D Wind Display [8] have realized wind presentations from 
different directions by arranging multiple wind sources 
around a user. They showed by questionnaires that the 
simultaneous presentation of a movie and wind using these 
systems enhanced the sensation of immersion compared 
with the presentation of a movie alone. 
However, in such studies, only a small number of wind 
sources have been used. Thus, it is unclear whether a precise 
wind direction can be reproduced using these systems. If the 
wind sources are arranged too sparsely, it is difficult to 
precisely reproduce the wind direction in the virtual 
environment. In contrast, if the wind sources are arranged 
too densely, users would not be able to discriminate the 
wind produced by neighboring wind sources, which is 
regarded as over-engineering. By taking the human ability 
to discriminate the wind direction into account when 
designing a wind source configuration, such over-
engineering can be prevented, and a natural wind can be 
reproduced.  
We examined the properties of wind direction perception 
to find a guideline for optimizing the wind source 
configuration when designing a system that reproduces an 
environment using wind sensation. In our previous 
studies[9][10], however, the results might have been 
affected by errors in the fan alignment (mounting angle) and 
the variance of the wind velocity distribution generated by 
each fan, because multiple fixed fans were used in the 
experimental setup. Furthermore, the localized wind 
generated by a simple fan was quite different from natural 
wind. In this study, we found a new guideline for wind 
source configuration by measuring the property of wind 
direction perception, using a uniform wind blowing on the 
entire face to prevent error due to the wind source.

RELATED WORK 
Several studies that reproduce an environment using 
wind sensation have been conducted. A historic example is 
the famous Sensorama simulator [11] by Heilig. Sensorama 
was a game in which a player felt like they were riding a 
motorcycle. Sensorama provided not only visual and 
auditory stimuli but also tactile and olfactory stimuli, 
including a wind sensation provided by a wind blowing from 
the front.  
More recently, Moon et al. showed that the sensation of 
presence can be improved by providing wind in addition to 
showing a movie of a snowstorm [7]. Kosaka et al. [8] 
arranged 25 fans on a dome-shaped frame at intervals of 45°: 
eight fans on each of three levels (ear-height, 45° higher and 
45° lower) and one at the top of the dome. They showed a 
movie of a person swinging with and without presenting the 
wind. As a result, the presentation of wind achieved a higher 
sensation of reality than that without wind. Cardin et al. 
mounted eight fans on a head mounted display at intervals of 
45° and presented wind with a movie of a flight simulator 
[12]. Lehmann et al. conducted an experiment to evaluate the 
sensation of reality for three conditions: presenting only a 
movie of snow flurries, the movie with wind from a 
ventilator mounted on a traverse system, and the movie with 
wind from two fans mounted on a worn helmet. The results 
showed that 75% of the subjects reported that the ventilator 
provided the greatest increase in realism [13]. Matsukura et 
al. developed a system that gave a user the sensation that an 
odor was emanating from a certain position on the screen, by 
producing winds generated by fans at four corners of the 
screen and allowing them to collide in front to form a wind 
in a direction orthogonal to the original direction [14]. They 
first made vertical winds produced by four fans located at the 
corners of the screen collide two by two to form two 
horizontal winds (leftward and rightward) along the screen. 
They then made these two horizontal winds collide to 
produce a wind heading toward the user sitting in front of the 
screen. Hirota et al. developed a system that could provide 
variable wind direction. They presented wind from two fans 
set in different directions and let them collide obliquely. By 
controlling the velocity of the wind from each fan, they 
succeeded in presenting an intermediate wind between two 
directions [15].  
Some researchers have studied the property of wind 
sensation perception. Kubota et al. reported that the wind 
perception threshold of the face was about 0.2 m/s, 
depending on the temperature or fluctuation of the flow 
velocity [16]. Kojima et al. investigated which part of the 
head was sensitive to wind stimulation, in the context of their 
wearable wind display for local skin stimulation [17]. Their 
results showed that the regions around the ears were the most 
sensitive. Hashimoto et al. examined the perception of wind 
at the fingertips [18]. They measured the absolute threshold 
using the limit method and the difference threshold using the 
constant method. They also measured the difference 
threshold of the directional perception. However, they did 
not conduct tests at the face.  
Among these studies, we have focused on the human 
properties related to perceiving the wind direction. We 
examined the property of wind direction perception at the 
frontal region of the head. As a result, values for the Just 
Noticeable Difference (JND) in wind direction perception 
were obtained, but a significant inter-subject difference was 
observed. In this study, we found the possibility that subjects 
might discriminate the wind direction based on the area of 
the face touched by the wind [9]. Next, we conducted an 
experiment to examine the effect of the stimulation area of 
the face by measuring JNDs using multiple conditions for the 
stimulation area. We found a significant difference between 
JND values of wind discrimination for different conditions 
[10].  
In these studies, a single fan was used to provide the 
wind, following many existing systems with wind 
presentation. However, natural wind is not a local 
phenomenon but a uniform sensation encompassing the 
entire face. Because the point that the wind hits affects wind 
direction discrimination, we supposed that the human 
performance of discriminating the wind direction might be 
different, depending on whether a localized or uniform wind 
was presented. Another problem in our previous study was 
that we used multiple fixed fans to present wind from 
various directions. This might have caused variations in the 
wind velocity and a slight alignment error for each fan. The 
slight alignment error might have affected the results because 
of the potential to discriminate the wind direction by the area 
hit by the wind. For example, when the wind hit the center of 
the face, it also hit the left side of the face if we misaligned 
the position of the fan located on the right side of the subject. 
Because we arranged the fans one by one by hand, there was 
a possibility that slight misalignments accrued. 
Thus, in this study, we measured the JND values of wind 
direction perception at the frontal region of the head for both 
localized and uniform winds. In addition, we compared the 
JND obtained by using multiple fixed fans to that obtained 
by moving a fan, to assess the effect of the fan alignment 
error.

EXPERIMENT 
A. Apparatus 
We used DC fans (SST-AP121 by SilverStone 
Technology Co. Ltd.; 120 mm2) as wind sources, following 
the procedures used in our previous studies [9][10]. The 
maximum air flow was 1.0 m3/min, and the operating noise 
was 22.4 dBA, measured 80 cm from the fan.  
We selected this model of fan because it produces an 
airflow in a circular fashion using a fan filter and swirl-
shaped fan grille and is well-suited to examine the properties 
of wind direction perception because it has better directivity 
than an ordinary fan. In Fig. 1, we show the airflow 
difference between this fan and an ordinary fan. The

“ordinary” fan used for comparison was a DC fan 
(109R1212H102 by Sanyo Denki Co. Ltd.; 120 mm2).

The wind velocity distribution generated by SST-AP121 
is listed in Table I. We measured wind velocities at intervals 
of 5 cm within the limits of a 20-cm square on a plane 
normal to the axis of the fan at a distance of 80 cm from the 
fan. The left, right, top, and bottom of the table correspond to 
the directions of wind movement. The unit is m/s. For a 
comparison with the ordinary fan, we show the wind 
distribution by 109R1212H102 in Table II. Both fans were 
driven at the rated voltage (12 V).

 In Table II, the wind spreads to a wider area. In Table I, 
the wind is the strongest at the center, and the wind velocity 
becomes smaller in the outer regions. Looking at Fig. 1 and 
Table II, we can find that the ordinary fan produces wind in 
an oblique direction rather than straight ahead. 
In previous studies [9] [10], we used a single fan as the 
wind source. In this study, however, we needed to present a 
uniform wind that could cover the entire face. According to 
Table II, a single “ordinary” fan was not sufficient to present 
a uniform wind because the ratio of the minimum to 
maximum wind velocity was only 0.201. 
We designed wind source configurations to present a 
uniform wind. We found that the “selected” model of fan 
(SST-AP121) could produce a unimodal wind distribution, 
i.e., the wind velocity was larger at the center and smaller at 
the periphery. Therefore, by composing a 2 × 2 or 3 × 3 fan 
array, we expected to be able to present a uniform wind that 
could cover the entire face. The composed fan arrays as wind 
sources are shown in Fig. 2, and the measured wind velocity 
distributions produced by the fan arrays are listed in Tables 
III and IV, respectively.

From Tables III and IV, the minimum to maximum wind 
velocity ratios of the 2 × 2 and 3 × 3 fan arrays are 0.491 and 
0.840, respectively. In other words, as the number of fans 
increased, the wind became more uniform. Based on this 
result, we decided that a 3 × 3 array was sufficient as a wind 
source unit to present a uniform wind within an area of 20 
cm2, which was a suitable size to cover the head. The unit 
size was 360 mm × 360 mm. When only the central fan in 
this unit was activated, it corresponded to the experimental 
condition of the previous studies [9] [10], in which a single 
fan was used as a wind source. 
In previous studies [9] [10], we placed 13 fans in a range 
of 60° to 60° with respect to a subject at intervals of 10°. 
The wind from the front of the face was 0° and was 
presented from seven fans in a range of 30° to 0° at 1.3 
m/s. The separation and limit of this stimulus were based on 
a prior study where we estimated the wind direction 
perception. The wind from the front of the subject (0°) was 
the standard stimulus, and winds from seven positions 
ranging from –30° to +30° were comparison stimuli. The 
JND of the wind direction perception was measured using 
the method of constant stimuli (Fig. 3). However, when 
using multiple fans, individual fan differences related to the 
mounting angle and wind distribution might cause a problem.

Figure 3.  Experimental setup for measuring JND 
To prevent individual fan differences from affecting the 
results, we used the single wind source unit shown in Fig. 2, 
instead of 13 separate fans. We attached this wind source 
unit to a moving platform that could be moved on an arc rail 
whose center was aligned at the center of the subject’s head. 
With this experimental setup, we could eliminate the factor 
indicated in a previous study [9], where a slight 
misalignment of the fans could significantly affect the user’s 
perception of the wind direction. 
The distance between the wind source and the subject 
was 80 cm, and the wind velocity was 1.3 m/s. According to 
Tables I and IV, the newly configured wind source unit 
could provide wind with a faster velocity than that produced 
by a single fan, when it was operated at the rated voltage of 
the fan (12 V). Therefore, to make the wind velocity equal to 
that produced by a single fan, the wind source unit was 
operated at 8 V. The unit size was 360 mm × 360 mm, which 
corresponded to an angle of 25°.  
We used a step motor unit (ASC66AK-N5 by Oriental 
Motor Co. Ltd.) to drive the platform carrying the wind 
source unit. The maximum rotation velocity was 360 rpm, 
and 
the 
maximum 
velocity 
of 
the 
platform 
was 
approximately 7.6°/s. 
To prevent subjects from identifying the direction by the 
motor noise, we provided white noise using a portable audio 
player (Walkman NW-754 by SONY Co. Ltd.), along with 
noise-canceling earphones. Although we needed to prevent 
subjects from determining the fan location visually, to 
expose the maximum possible amount of skin area on the 
face to the wind, we did not use blinders. Subjects closed 
their eyes throughout the experiment. Fig. 4 shows an 
overview of the experimental setup.  
 
 
Figure 4.  Overview of experimental setup 
To prevent any misalignment of the head position during 
the experiment, we used a chin support. We separated the 
small mount for the chin support from the table on which the 
rail was placed to prevent vibrations caused by the motor and 
gear from being transmitted to the subjects. 
B. Method 
We measured the JND using a constant stimulus method. 
Wind from 0° in front of a subject was the standard stimulus. 
Wind from any of seven positions within 30° to 30° at 
intervals of 10° was the comparison stimulus. The subject sat 
in front of the wind source and put their face on a chin 
support. The experiment started with their eyes closed. 
First, the wind source presented the standard stimulus. 
Next, it was moved to any one of the positions from 30° to 
30° and presented a comparison stimulus. The subject 
determined whether the comparison stimulus was to the left 
or right with respect to the standard stimulus. Next, the wind 
source returned to the first position (0°), and the standard 
stimulus was presented again, followed by the presentation 
of a comparison stimulus from any one of the positions from 
30° to 30°. We repeated this procedure until each 
comparison stimulus (30° to 30°) was presented 10 times, 
i.e., we presented 140 stimuli in total, including standard 
stimuli. 
Before starting the experiment, we tested whether a 
subject could hear the motor noise to prevent them from 
using sound to discriminate wind directions. If the subject 
could hear the motor noise, they were asked to turn up the 
volume of the white noise until they could no longer hear the 
motor.  
The duration of each stimulus was 4.5 s, followed by an 
interval of 8 s, including the moving time for the wind source. 
The duration for a session was approximately 30 min. A 
subject was asked to attend two sessions: localized wind and 
uniform wind, in random order. We allowed a break of 
approximately 20 min between sessions to let the subject 
relax and cool the motor. Hence, the total duration of the 
experiment for one subject was approximately 80 min. Ten 
male subjects in their twenties volunteered for the 
experiment. 
C. Results 
Examples of plots showing the ratios of the times that 
subjects answered “right” for each comparison stimulus 
angle are shown in Figs. 5 and 6. Fig. 5 is an example of the 
results for a single fan, and Fig. 6 shows the results for the 3 
× 3 fan array. We fitted a cumulative normal distribution 
curve and calculated JND values. The JNDs calculated for 
10 subjects and a pilot study are listed in Table V.

The average JND value for 10 subjects was 6.05° in the 
previous study, with values of 1.68° for a single fan and 
5.55° for a fan array. The JND was larger for uniform wind. 
Eight subjects gave all correct answers except for 0° when 
using a single fan, whereas only one subject could give all 
correct answers when using a fan array. The standard 
deviations over the subjects were 1.73° for the previous 
study, 1.48° for a single fan, and 2.25° for a fan array.  
Fig. 7 shows the average JND values, including the 
previous study [10]. “Pilot study (single)” refers to the 
results of the previous experiment with a single fan (but 
using different fans for different directions). “Single” shows 
the results when moving a single fan, and “3 × 3” shows the 
results with the fan array. The vertical axis is JND (in 
degrees). We conducted a t-test[19] to verify whether there 
was a significant difference between pairs of JND values. 
First, we conducted a t-test between the results of the 
previous study [10] and this study with a single fan. 
 
 
 
Figure 7.  JND for each condition 
Because the subjects in the past study and this study were 
not paired (they used two different groups of subjects), we 
conducted an unpaired t-test. The two-sided p-value was 
0.00001, and there was a significant difference (p < 0.001). 
Because the subject groups of “single fan” and “fan array” 
were identical, we conducted a paired t-test. The two-sided 
p-value was 0.00026. Thus, there was a significant difference 
(p < 0.001). 
D. Discussion 
The results of this study using a single fan were different 
from those of the previous study [10]. The cause of this 
difference was considered to be either the alignment error of 
each fan or individual performance differences in the fans 
used to present winds from different directions in the 
previous study. Moreover, in the previous study, the fans 
were manually fixed on an arc-shaped frame, which might 
have affected the results. In this study, because we presented 
wind by moving a wind source unit on semicircular rail, 
there was little error from the mounting angle and individual 
fan differences. Thus, we obtained stable results. In the 
comparison of the results by a single fan and fan array, we 
found that it was more difficult for subjects to discriminate 
wind directions when a uniform wind was presented. 
Although the JND of subject five for a uniform wind was 
smaller than that for the local wind, this consisted merely of 
the difference in the ratio of answering “right” for 0°. Except 
for 0°, the ratio of correct answers by this subject was 100% 
for both the local and uniform winds. For the other nine 
subjects, the JND values for the local wind were smaller. 
With the localized wind, subjects could discriminate wind 
directions based on the areas reached by the wind. With the 
uniform wind, it was difficult for subjects to discriminate the 
wind direction by the areas reached by the wind, because it 
blew on their entire face. Therefore, some subjects reported 
that they changed their strategy to discriminate the wind 
direction, i.e., focusing on the direction of airflow on the face. 
The standard deviation for the fan array was larger than 
that for the single fan. This implies that subjects could 
discriminate wind directions using the areas touched by the 
winds for the local wind, whereas for the uniform wind, the 
methods used to discriminate wind directions differed among 
individuals. For the local wind, all of the subjects reported 
that they discriminated directions using the areas touched by 
the 
winds. 
For the 
uniform 
wind, 
three 
subjects 
discriminated directions by the side of the face where the 
wind flowed. Because the winds produced by the fan array 
had a larger range than those of the single fan, some subjects 
reported that they used their neck or arms as a reference for 
discrimination. In this way, individual differences are subject 
to occur when a uniform wind is used.  
Moreover, differences in the level of concentration 
existed as individual differences common to the local and 
uniform winds. The subjects became sleepy in 15 out of 20 
sessions (10 subjects, 2 conditions), because their eyes were 
closed throughout the session. A sensitive subject could 
detect the motion of the wind source unit by a slight

CONCLUSION 
In this study, we measured the JND of the wind direction 
perception of a local wind produced using a single fan 
commonly used for a wind display and a uniform wind 
produced by a fan array that was similar to natural wind. As 
a result, we found that the uniform wind provided larger JND 
values and made it more difficult to discriminate the wind 
direction compared to the local wind. By comparing the 
results with those of the previous study [10], we found that 
errors in the mounting angle and individual fan performance 
differences significantly affected wind direction perception. 
Thus, when designing a wind display, the following 
guidelines were obtained: (1) if one wants to present a 
uniform wind, the interval of the wind sources can be larger 
than when using a single fan, and (2) the fans should be 
arranged with extremely high precision if multiple fans are 
used to present winds in different directions.  
The average ratios for the subjects answering “right” for 
0° was 55% with a single fan and 41% with the wind source 
unit. It was thought that the center of the wind source was 
accurately aligned with the subject’s face. However, because 
of the need for a strict fan configuration, the entire apparatus 
should also be arranged with extremely high precision.  
In this study, the JND for a uniform wind was 5.55°, 
whereas the size of the wind source unit corresponded to 
approximately 25°. This means the size of the wind source 
unit was larger than the JND requirement. In this study, to 
present a natural wind, we used a 3 × 3 fan array as a wind 
source unit. Therefore, if we designed a wind display based 
on a fixed fan array, we would have to arrange fans with a 
sufficient density to cover all directions. However, we still 
believe that it is inappropriate to apply the JND value 
obtained in this study immediately, because there are 
numerous factors that affect the wind direction perception, 
e.g., the wind velocity, wind temperature, gender, and age. 
In this 
study, the subjects 
only 
concentrated on 
discriminating the wind direction. However, the existence of 
a movie or sound in an actual wind display might reduce the 
level of concentration on the wind. Thus, we might be able 
to make the wind sources sparser than indicated by the 
results of this study. In future work, we will further 
investigate the required precision when considering the 
property of wind perception to achieve acceptable wind 
displays for people regardless of age and gender. In addition, 
we are going to examine cross-modal effects with the other 
sensory modalities.
