Abstract—People in business companies and academic ﬁelds work
in cooperation with others rather than working alone. They
may discuss their progress with others, like co-workers and
supervisors, to help them obtain the best results. Sometimes
people may feel that such discussions are not conducted well.
However, people do not evaluate the quality of each discussion
every time because it is tough work for them; they usually do
not have enough time for that. In the process of evaluating
discussions, people might look back on their discussions and
make a plan to have an improved discussion next time. This
paper proposes an evaluation method for one-to-one research
discussions. The method makes a model of the discussion process
with transitions of utterance types. The labels of utterance types
are assigned to each utterance in a discussion text manually.
By calculating the transition probabilities between two labels, a
matrix of transition probabilities is obtained. The transitions of
labels with high probabilities are extracted from high quality
discussions and connected to obtain a discussion process model.
The model can be used for the evaluation of new discussions. We
applied the proposed method to discussion texts and found that
the obtained process model from high quality discussions had
several loops of transitions which were connected loosely.

INTRODUCTION
People in business companies and academic ﬁelds work
in cooperation with others rather than working alone. It is
important to discuss their working progress with others, like
co-workers and supervisors, to help them obtain the best
results. Such people can exchange their opinions and advise
each other. These discussions make people understand not only
what others think, but also ensure that members of the same
team are in agreement about their work.
Discussions are sometimes not conducted well. This hap-
pens because discussions have a time limit and people often
fail to arrive at a common understandings due to the difference
in their thinking styles. However, people do not evaluate the
quality of each discussion every time because it is tough work
for them; they usually do not have enough time for that. In
the process of evaluating discussions, people might look back
on their discussions and make a plan to have an improved
discussion next time.
This paper proposes an evaluation method for one-to-one
research discussions between a student and his/her correspond-
ing supervisor. The method makes a model of the discussion
process with transitions of utterance types to evaluate future
discussions. Note that we deﬁne a high quality discussion to
be a discussion in which both the student and his/her cor-
responding supervisor understand their research progress. We
believe that a high quality discussion should have characteristic
transitions of utterance types.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2,
we discuss related work. The proposed method is presented in
Section 3, followed by our experiment in Section 4. Finally,
we conclude in Section 5.

RELATED WORK
Our proposed method is a conversation analysis method.
Previous methods cover not only general conversations [1],
but also purpose-oriented conversations such as conversations
for persuasion [2]. The proposed method targets the analysis of
one-to-one discussions for research progress. A discussion on
the topic of research progress tends to have loops of divergence
and convergence. General conversations should be divergent
conversations while purpose-oriented conversations should be
convergent. A target discussion should be in the middle of
the two types. Our hypothesis is that a loop appears in a
model of the discussion process if the discussion is conducted
well. Many conversational features are used in the conversation
analysis. The number of utterances in a conversation is used
for evaluating the quality of conversations [3]. The length of
silent time in a conversation is also used for the evaluation of
the quality of the conversation [4]. The proposed method uses
utterance types in a discussion as the conversational features.
While the two previous studies use quantitative features, the
proposed method uses qualitative features, i.e., utterance types.
If both features are used for conversation analysis, the analysis
results will become rich.
There are some sets of utterance types for conversation
analysis. The sets such as Switchboard-Dialog Act Markup in
Several Layers (SWBD-DAMSL) [5] and Meeting Recorder
Dialog Act (MRDA) [6] provide labels of utterance types.
Those sets were prepared for analyzing speciﬁc conversations
and discussions. Therefore, we also design a set of labels of
utterance types by referring to our target discussions.

PROPOSED METHOD FOR EVALUATION OF
DISCUSSION
The outline of the proposed method is described in this
section. Firstly, a transcript of a discussion is prepared manu-
ally. One line includes a speaker’s name and an utterance text.

Figure 1. Labels of Utterance Types.
Each utterance is assigned one utterance type label. A matrix
of the transition of labels (i.e., utterance types) is obtained.
Each cell of the matrix has a transition probability between
two labels. Transitions with high probabilities are extracted
from the matrix. The extracted transitions are connected if
the same labels are included, and then a discussion process
model is obtained. The model can be used to evaluate future
discussions.
A. Preparing Transcripts of Discussions
We suppose that a research discussion should be conducted
face-to-face. The research discussion is recorded by a voice
recorder. The proposed method uses transcripts of discussion
to make a model. One line of the transcript includes a speaker’s
name and an utterance text; the utterance text includes ﬁllers.
The length of sound in a word, the length of silent time, and
any laughing time are not included. An utterance text includes
several sentences before turn-taking occurs. Table I shows an
example of a part of a transcript.
B. Assigning Utterance Type Labels to Utterances
Each utterance in the transcript is labeled with utter-
ance types. Though an automatic labeling method has been
proposed [7], the labeling accuracy is not enough. In our
case, each utterance is labeled manually to ensure accurate
labels. Though sets of labels for utterances have also been
proposed [8], most of the sets of labels have their target
discussions and conversations. We design a new set of labels
for utterances of our target discussions, that is discussions for
research progress.
Figure 1 shows labels of utterance types. These labels are
designed by referring to the transcripts of discussions that will
be described in Section IV. The utterance from a supervisor
and the utterance from a student will be distinguished. The
labels for the supervisor’s utterances and the labels for the
student’s utterances will also be distinguished by a different
ending added to the label. The proposed method uses 31∗2 =
62 types of labels in total.
When labeling utterance text, the already appeared utter-
ance texts are also considered. An utterance text may not have
enough information for labeling. If a student says “Yes” for
a question from a supervisor, it means “Yes, you are right.”
But if a student says “Yes” for a proposal from a supervisor, it
means “Yes, I will do it.” The two “Yes”s are different types
of utterances.
Multiple labels may be assigned to an utterance text
because a single utterance may have several roles. The cor-
responding ending to distinguish the speaker is also added to
each label. In this paper, the ending for an utterance from a
supervisor is set to T, while the ending for an utterance from
a student is set to S.
C. Matrix of Transition Probabilities of Labels
A matrix of transition probabilities of labels is obtained by
using the labels information on utterance texts. The transition
probability of labels means a probability between labels.
Suppose that the ith utterance text has a vector of labels L(i)
and the jth utterance text has a vector of labels L(j) (j = i+1).
L(i) is described by (1).
L(i) = {ln|0 <= n <= 61},
(1)
where n is the label index. ln is 0 or 1. If the nth label is
assigned to an utterance text, ln = 1. Otherwise, ln = 0. The
frequency of transition from the label ln in L(i) to the label
lm in L(j) is increased if both of ln and lp are not equal to
zero. Let the frequency be fn,m. Let the number of lines of
the transcript be NL. NL − 1 is the number of turn-taking in
a discussion. The transition probability pn,m from the label ln
to the label lm is calculated by (2).
pn,m =
fn,m
NL − 1,
(2)
where n and m are labels indices. By assigning the probability
pn,m to each cell, a matrix of transition probabilities is
obtained. Table II shows an example of a part of the matrix
that is obtained from discussion texts (detailed in Section IV).
D. Discussion Process Model
A discussion process model is obtained by using the
matrix of transition probabilities. Transitions of labels with
probabilities more than a threshold T are extracted from the
matrix. The extracted transitions are connected if the same
label is included in two different transitions. The graph of
connected transitions is the model to evaluate the discussions
proposed in this paper.
IV.
EXPERIMENT
We made discussion process models for high quality dis-
cussions and low quality discussions. We compared the two
models and found the differences between the two models.
We used eight transcripts of discussion between a supervisor
and a student in our laboratory. The number of supervisors was
two while eight students (four males and four females) were
in the laboratory. Each of the supervisors had for students,
respectively. The students were 21 to 22 years old and were en-
rolled in the College of Information Science and Engineering.
The transcripts of the discussion were read by the 1st author
and the 2nd author. The two authors divided the transcripts
into two classes: a high quality discussion class and a low
quality discussion class. Table III shows the details of the eight
transcripts; the length of discussion, the number of utterances
from a supervisor and the number of utterances from a student
are described. The average length of discussion was 26 minutes
and 58 seconds. The average number of utterances from a
supervisor was 81 while that from a student was 71.5. The
transcripts with IDs 1 to 4 were in the high quality discussion
class while those with IDs 5 to 8 were in the opposite class.
A. Experimental Results and Discussion
Table IV and Table V show the top ﬁve label transitions
with high probabilities in each transcript of the discussion.
Table IV shows the transitions obtained from transcripts of
a high quality discussion class. All of them had the transition
Answer S → Question T in the top ﬁve transitions with the
highest probabilities except in the transcript #4. It means that a
supervisor gave a question and a student answered a question

frequently in a discussion. Table V shows the top ﬁve transi-
tions of low quality discussion class. Though all of them had
the same transition (Answer S → Question T), there were
other labels such as Confirmation T and Explanation T.
This means that the supervisor needed to conﬁrm and explain
to the student frequently in the discussion.
Table VI shows the top nine transitions of labels with high
values of summation of probabilities in transcripts of high
quality discussion and low quality discussion, respectively.
The high quality discussion class has transitions such as
Answer S → Question T, Agreement S → Opinion T
and Answer S → Understanding T. The transitions in-
dicated that the discussions were conducted smoothly. In
contrast, the low quality discussion class has transitions
such as Question S → Answer T and Agreement S →
Explanation T. The transitions indicated that the discussions
were not conducted smoothly and so the supervisor and the
student could not come to a common agreement.
Figure 2 shows the obtained model of the high quality
discussion process. In the ﬁgure, there are loops consisting
of some speciﬁc labels such as Question T ↔ Answer S,
Opinion T
↔
Agreement S, and Suggestion T
↔
Agreement S. The small loops are connected to make a big
loose loop.

Figure 3 shows the obtained model of the low quality
discussion process. In the ﬁgure, there are loops of some
speciﬁc labels such as Question T
↔
Answer S and
Suggestion T
↔ Agreement S. Although some of the
small loops are connected, all loops are not connected. Some of
the transitions have dead-end paths like Understanding S →
Opinion T.

CONCLUSION
This paper proposed an evaluation method for one-to-one
research discussions. We used the research discussion between
a supervisor and a student who is studying for a graduation
thesis at a university. The proposed method makes a discussion
process model with transitions of utterance types. Labels of
utterance types are originally designed for discussion analysis
for research progress.
In this paper, we analyzed eight discussion texts. We

divided the texts into high quality and low quality discussion
classes; each class had four texts, respectively. The obtained
model from high quality discussions had several loops of
transitions, which were connected loosely. In contrast, the ob-
tained model from low quality discussions did not have loops
of transitions. In the model for low quality discussions, the
transitions between “understood by student” and “explanation
by supervisor” were included. The transition in the model
might mean that the supervisor and the student did not come
to a common understanding.
As future work, we will try to evaluate the growth in the
discussion skills of a student by using the proposed method.
We will improve our method to conduct automatic labeling of
utterances for analyzing many discussions.
