Abstract—The second order statistics, such as average level 
crossing rate (LCR) and average fade duration (AFD), for dual 
branch SSC/SC combiner output signals in the presence of 
Rician fading, are determined in this paper by using earlier 
obtained closed-form expressions for probability density 
functions (PDFs) of derivatives at two time instants. The 
results are graphically presented in some figures versus some 
parameters values. The analysis of the parameters influence 
and different types of combiners is given.

 INTRODUCTION 
The fading is one of the most important causes of system 
performance 
degradation 
in 
wireless 
communication 
systems. The communication systems are subjected to fading 
which is caused by multipath propagation due to reflection, 
refraction and scattering by buildings, trees and other large 
structures. After that received signal represents a sum of 
many signals that arrive via different propagation paths. 
Some statistical models are used in the literature to 
describe the fading envelope of the received signal. These 
distributions are: Rayleigh, Rician, Nakagami, Weibull, 
Hoyt, and others. They are used to characterize the envelope 
of faded signals over small geographical area, or short term 
fading. The log-normal and gamma distribution are used for 
describing long term fading, when much wider geographical 
area is involved.  
The performance analysis of complex SSC/MRC 
combiner in Rice fading channel is given in [1]. This paper 
presents an extended analysis of the second order statistics, 
such as average level crossing rate (LCR) and average fade 
duration (AFD), for dual branch SSC/SC combiner output 
signals in the presence of Rician fading, based on closed-
form expressions for probability density functions (PDFs) of 
derivatives at two time instants obtained in [2]. 
Ricean fading is a stochastic model for radio propagation 
irregularity caused by partial cancellation of a radio signal, 
i.e., the signal arrives at the receiver by several different 
paths and at least one of them is lengthened or shorted [3]. 
Rician fading occurs when one of the paths, typically a line 
of sight signal, is much stronger than the others. In Rician 
fading, the amplitude gain is characterized by a Rician 
distribution [4], [5]. Rayleigh fading is the specialized model 
for stochastic fading when there is no line of sight signal, and 
it is considered as a special case of the more generalized 
concept of Rician fading. In Rayleigh fading, the amplitude 
is described by a Rayleigh distribution. 
There are several ways to reduce fading influence on 
system performances without increasing the signal power 
and channel bandwidth. The diversity reception techniques 
are used extensively in fading radio channels to reduce the 
fading influence on system performances [5]. Various 
diversity combining techniques are used. 
Selection combining (SC), where the strongest signal is 
selected between the N received signals [6]. When the N 
signals are independent and Rayleigh distributed, the 
expected diversity gain has been shown to be inversely 
proportional to the number of antennas [7, 8].  
Switched combining: In the case of dual branch SSC, the 
first branch stay selected as long as its current value of 
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is greater than predetermined 
switching threshold, even if the SNR value in the second 
branch maybe is largerer at that time [3]. The receiver 
switches to another signal when the currently selected signal 
drops below a predefined threshold [9]. This is a less 
efficient technique than selection combining. 
 The consideration of SSC systems in the literature has 
been restricted to low-complexity mobile units where the 
number of diversity antennas is typically limited to two. 
Performance analysis of SSC diversity receiver over 
correlated Ricean fading channels in the presence of co-
channel interference is carried out in [10]. 
Equal-gain combining (EGC): All the received signals 
are summed coherently [11]. 
Maximal-ratio combining (MRC) is often used in large 
phased-array systems. The received signals are weighted 
with respect to their SNR and then summed [12]. This is the 
best and most complicated combining scheme. 
In this paper, the probability density functions (PDFs) of 
derivatives at two time instants for dual branch Switch and 
Stay (SSC) combiner output signals in the presence of 
Rician fading in closed-form expressions are presented and 
used for calculating the second order statistics of SSC/SC 
combiner. The results are shown in some graphs versus 
different parameters values. An analysis of the results is 
provided also. To the best author knowledge the

performance of SSC/SC combiner is not reported in open 
technical literature by other authors. 
The remainder of the document is organized as follows: 
in Section II related works are mentioned; Section III 
introduces the model of the SSC combiner; the  probability 
density functions of derivatives are presented and 
graphically shown in Section IV. In Section V, the model of 
complex SSC/SC combiner is given and statistics for this 
combiner is calculated. In the last section, some conclusions 
are presented.

 RELATED WORKS 
The probability density functions (PDFs) of derivatives 
for Switch and Stay Combiner (SSC) output signals at two 
time instants in the presence of Rician fading are determined 
in [2]. Now, in this paper, the second-order characteristics 
will be determined using these PDFs. 
The probability density functions and joint probability 
density functions for SSC combiner output signals at two 
time instants in the presence of different fading distributions 
are determined by these authors. Then, they are used for 
calculating first order system performances, such as the bit 
error rate and the outage probability, for complex systems 
sampling at two time instants. Performance analysis of 
SSC/SC combiner in the presence of Rayleigh fading is 
given in [13]. The outage probability analysis of the SSC/SC 
combiner at two time instants in the presence of lognormal 
fading is done in [14]. The PDF of the combiner output 
signal is derived. Then, the outage probability is numerically 
calculated using this PDF. The results are shown graphically 
in order to compare performances of the SSC/SC combiner 
with regard to classical SSC and SC combiners sampling at 
one time instant. 
This work is motivated by the desire to obtain better 
system performance, in the presence of Rician fading, with 
complex combiner consisting of two cheaper and simpler 
diversity systems (SSC and SC) against MRC diversity 
combining scheme witch is much more expensive. 
III. 
SYSTEM MODEL OF SSC COMBINER 
The SSC combiner with two branches at two time 
instants is discussed in this section. The model is shown in 
Fig. 1. 
The input signals, at the first time moment, are r11 and r21 
and they are r12 and r22 at the second time instant. The 
derivatives are 11
r  and 21
r  at the first time instant and 12
r  
and 22
r  at the second one.  
 
 
Figure 1. Model of the SSC combiner with two inputs at two time instants 
The signals at the output are r1 and r2. The derivatives of 
the SSC combiner output signals are 1r  and 2r . 
The indices for input signals and their derivatives are as 
follows: the first index represents the branch ordinal number 
and the other one signs the time instant observed. The 
indices for the output signal correspond to the time instants 
observed.  
The probability that combiner examines first the signal 
from the first branch is P1 and P2 for the second one. The 
values of P1 and P2 for SSC combiner are obtained in [3]. 
The four different cases are discussed here, according to 
the working algorithm of SSC combiner: 
1)   r1<rT, r2<rT     
In this case all signals are less then threshold rT, i.e.: 
r11<rT, r12<rT, r21<rT, and r22<rT. Let combiner considers 
first the signal r11. Because r11<rT, then 1r = 21
r , and because 
of r22<rT, then 2r = 12
r . The probability of this event is P1. If 
combiner examines first the signal r21, then r21<rT, 1r = 11
r , 
as r21<rT, 2r = 22
r . The probability of this event is P2. 
2)   r1≥rT, r2<rT     
In this case first of the signals is greater than the 
threshold rT, but the other is less. The possible combinations 
related to the probability of the first examination of first or 
second input are: 
- r11≥rT,    r12<rT, r22<rT, 
                   1r = 11
r   2r = 22
r
  
       P1 
- r11<rT,  r21≥rT   r22<rT, r12<rT,       1r = 21
r  
2r = 12
r          P1 
- r21≥rT,   r22<rT, r12<rT, 
 
1r = 21
r  
2r = 12
r
        P2 
- r21<rT, r11≥rT,    r12<rT, r22<rT, 
1r = 11
r  
2r = 22
r
        P2 
3)   r1<rT, r2≥rT     
In this case first of the signals is less then threshold rT, 
but the other is bigger. The possible combinations for this 
case tied with probabilities of order of inputs' consideration 
are: 
- r11<rT, r21<rT,   r22≥rT, 
               1r = 21
r  
2r = 22
r
        P1 
- r11<rT, r21<rT,   r22<rT, r12≥rT,  
1r = 21
r  
2r = 12
r
        P1 
- r21<rT, r11<rT,   r12≥rT, 
 
1r = 11
r  
2r = 12
r
         P2 
- r21<rT, r11<rT,   r12<rT, r22≥rT, 
1r = 11
r  
2r = 22
r
         P2 
4)   r1≥rT, r2≥rT  
In the  last case all signals are greater then threshold rT, 
i.e.: r11≥rT, r12≥rT, r21≥rT, and r22≥rT. Now, the possible 
combinations of  probabilities of  inputs’ examinations are: 
- r11≥ rT,  r12≥rT, 
 
 
1r = 11
r  
2r = 12
r
         P1 
- r11≥ rT,  r12<rT, r22≥rT 
 
1r = 11
r  
2r = 22
r
        P1

V. 
SYSTEM MODEL AND STATISTICS OF SSC/SC 
COMBINER 
The model of the SSC/SC combiner with two inputs at 
two time instants, considering in this paper, is shown in Fig. 
3. The SSC combiner input signals, r11 and r21 at first time 
instant, and r12 and r22 at the second time instant, are overall 
system inputs. The output signals from SSC part of combiner 
are r1 and r2 and they are inputs for second part of combiner. 
The overall output signal from complex system is r. 
The joint probability density functions at the SSC 
combiner outputs at two time instants in Rician fading 
channels for four different cases are: 
r1<rT, r2<rT

The average LCR at envelope level, r, is defined as the 
rate at which a fading signal envelope crosses level r in a 
positive or negative going direction. Denoting the signal 
envelope and its time derivative by r and r , respectively, the 
average LCR is given by [16],[17]

The level crossing rate (LRC) and average fade duration 
(AFD) curves for complex SSC/SC combiner at two time 
instants in the presence of Rician fading, depending on 
different values of the signal and derivative distributions’ 
parameters, are shown in Figs. 4 to 7.

Observing the first order system characteristics of 
SSC/SC combiner at two time instants presented in Fig. 2. 
[13, 14], it is obvious that the benefit of using complex 
SSC/SC combiner exists and it increases with decreasing of 
correlation between input signals. 
Because of that, the expressions for second order system 
performance are derived in this paper and the influence of 
system parameters at second order system characteristics is 
shown in all these figures. These results are useful for 
designing and analyzing of wireless communication systems.  
The level crossing rate of SSC/SC combiner at two time 
instants versus signal amplitude, N(r), for rt =1, A =0.5 and 
 =0 and different values of σ is presented in Fig. 4. It is 
visible from this figure that system performances are better 
for bigger values of parameter σ, because the system 
performances are better for lower values of average level 
crossing rate.    
The level crossing rate of SSC/SC combiner at two time 
instants N(r), for rt=1, σ =2, A =0.5 and different values of   
is plotted in Fig. 6. One can see from this figure that system 
performances are better for lower values of parameter . 
The curves for average fade duration of SSC/SC 
combiner at two time instants, T(r), are drawn in Figs. 5 and 
7. The parameters’ values are rt =1, A =0.5 and  =0.2 in Fig. 
5. Variable is parameter σ. It is evident that performances are 
better for greater values of parameter σ (lower values for 
AFD). The parameters’ values are rt =1, σ=2, A=0.5 in Fig. 7, 
with changeable  . One can conclude that results are more 
favorable for greater values of parameter . 
From all this figures it can be noticed that values of the 
LCR and AFD are growing, have discontinuity in the value 
of the threshold, where there is a drop in the values, and then 
are continuing to grow. In the case of LCR, the increasing of 
the value is evident till it reaches a maximum and then 
begins to fall. The system performance are better for lower 
values of average level crossing rate. For smaller LCR (i.e., 
the shallower fades), correspondingly AFD is larger. AFD 
increases with the value of the signal amplitude in whole 
range, but the curves also have drops at the threshold values. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, the expressions for probability density 
functions (PDFs) of the time derivatives at two time instants 
for output signals from dual branch SSC combiner in the 
presence of Rician fading are given. The second order 
characteristics: the average level crossing rate and the 
average fade duration for complex combiner who makes the 
decision based on sampling at two time instants, are 
calculated by using derived closed-form expressions for the 
case of SSC/SC combiner. To point out the improvement of 
using complex SSC/SC combiner compared to classical SSC 
and SC combiners at one time instant, some graphs are 
presented earlier for several fading distributions. 
Here, the second order system performances are 
calculated and presented graphically. These results are 
valuable 
in 
analyzing 
and 
projecting 
of 
wireless 
communication systems in the presence of Rician fading.
