Abstract—The ranging method based on Received Signal
Strength Indicator (RSSI) widely uses indoor positioning
technology of Wireless Sensing Network (WSN) because of low
cost and low complexity. The primary challenge is how to
overcome
some
of
the
phenomena
that
affect
signal
propagation
in
a
real
environment,
such
as
multipath,
diffraction, and absorption. Also, it makes the positioning
method more accurate. We are interested in the fact that
influences on RSSI measurements from indoor propagation
environments can be another ranging error source. In other
words,
to
improve
the
ranging
accuracy,
the
factors
influencing RSSI measurements should be minimized or
compensated. In this paper, we propose a method using
bimodal Gaussian distribution to get more accurate estimated
RSSI. The proposed method uses RSSI measurements with
bimodal Gaussian distributed characteristics in a reference
position. The experimental results in the proposed method
show that more precise results are achieved compared with the
existing method.
Keywords— RSSI; bimodal gaussian; attenuation log model.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, wireless network technologies, such as
Wi-Fi, ZigBee, Bluetooth, iBeacon have been rapidly
developed and widely used [1][2][3]. According to the signal
transmission intensity attenuation, phase difference, time
delay based on wireless network positioning technology can
estimate the location of the mobile node in the wireless
network coverage area to provide positioning services. The
indoor positioning technology using RSSI measurements is
focused in this research area because of its high positioning
accuracy. It is also compliant with GPS (Global Positioning
System)
in
precise positioning
area [4].
Due
to
the
complexity of indoor environments, the positioning error is
relatively large compared to that of outdoor GPS. Other
indoor positioning methods such as Ultrasonic [5], Ultra-
wideband [6] and so on, which are restricted by the cost and
application condition, are hard to meet the general demands
of indoor positioning.
Ranging algorithms are divided into two categories
according to the method of distance measurement in wireless
sensor networks. One is a ranging-based algorithm, and the
other is a range-free algorithm. The former method measures
RSS (Received Signal Strength),
(Time of Arrival), TDOA
(Time Difference of Arrival), etc. and calculates or estimates
the distance between node and reference [7]. The latter one
utilizes the relationship of geometric location information
between receiving nodes and the transmitting nodes to
estimate the distance.
The positioning algorithm based on more precisely
calculated or estimated distance information can provide
higher positioning accuracy. The RSSI attenuation log
model, which is easily influenced by various factors in
propagation environments, is generally used for distance
estimation.
A suitable method that not only efficiently improves the
positioning error but also expands the measurement range of
indoor positioning is needed.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section
II, the RSSI-based ranging method is introduced. In Section
III, the statistics of RSSI measurements are analyzed. In
Section IV, a new attenuation log model using RSSI
measurements
with
bimodal
Gaussian
distributed
characteristics in a reference position is proposed and its
experimental results are given in Section V. Conclusions are
given in Section VI.
II.
RSSI-BASED RANGING METHOD
In positioning theory, one of the techniques related to
ranging is to estimate the distance between two points by the
signal strength between the transmitting point and the
receiving point. Most devices can currently obtain RSSI.
WSN does not require additional hardware support, and it
does not affect the energy consumption, the size of the nodes
and the cost of the nodes. Therefore, WSN technology and
RSSI technology are very suitable for rough ranging.
In free space, RSSI is inversely proportional to the square
of the distance d between the receiving point and the
transmitting point. The relationship can be expressed using
the famous Friis formula [8]:
ܲ௥(d) = ܲ௧ܩ௧ܩ௥λଶ
(4π)ଶ݀ଶܮ(1)
In Equation (1), ܲ௥(d) is the received power, and the
unit is watts. ܲ௧ is the transmit power, and the unit is
watts.ܩ௧ is the transmit antenna gain.ܩ௥ is the gain of the

receiving antenna. λ is the wavelength of the transmitted
signal and the unit is meter. L is a loss parameter that has
nothing to do with the propagation environment. In fact, the
system loss parameters represent the total loss of the actual
system hardware. It includes transmission lines, filters, and
antennas.
In general, L is greater than one. However, if we assume
that the system hardware has no loss, we can let L = 1.
From (1), we can observe that the attenuation of the received
power is exponential with the distance. So, the free-space
path loss can be directly derived from Equation (1) without
any system loss.
ܲܮி(d)[dB] = 10 log ൬ܲ௧
ܲ௥
൰ = −10 log ቆܩ௧ܩ௥ߣଶ
(4ߨ)ଶ݀ଶቇ
(2)
If we ignore the antenna gain and letܩ௧ =ܩ௥=1,
Equation (2) can be written as:
ܲܮி(d)[dB] = 10 log ൬ܲ௧
ܲ௥
൰ = 20 log ൬4ߨ݀
ߣ ൰
(3)
In a free-space model, the average received signal is in a
logarithmic relationship with the distance d between the
transmitter and the receiver in all environments. In fact, a
more general path loss model can be constructed using the
environment-dependent signal attenuation factor to change
the free-space path loss model. The mathematical expression
of signal attenuation log model is as follows:
ܲܮ௅ே(݀) = PL(݀଴) + 10݈݊݃ ൬ ݀
݀଴
൰ + ܺ଴
(4)
where ݀ represents the distance from the transmitting
node to the receiving node, and the unit is m. ݀଴ is the unit
distance and usually takes 1m. ܲܮ௅ே(݀) is the path loss after
a distance of d, and the unit is dBm. PL(݀଴) is the path loss
after the unit distance, and the unit is dBm. ܺ଴ is Gauss
random number for a mean of 0, and its standard deviation
range is 4~10. When the ݊ value is smaller, the signal
attenuation in the transmission process is smaller, and the
signal can spread farther away. The range is generally
between 2 and 4. Figure 1 shows the signal attenuation
model for indoor positioning.

III. STATISTICS OF RSSI MEASUREMENTS
The
relevant
research
shows
that
the
relationship
between the RSSI and the transmission distance of the
wireless
signal
is
closely
related
and
stochastic
characteristics of RSSI measurements follow a particular rule
pattern.
From the point of view of the probability density
function property，the measured RSSI data were analyzed.
We collected RSSI measurements every two meters and
analyzed them by comparing with the stochastic distribution
model. After thorough analysis, we can find that most of the
RSSI measurements at a fixed location conform to Gaussian
distributions or bimodal Gaussian distributions. At the same
time, there is a small part of abnormal RSSI values. Figures
2-5 give the probability density distributions of RSSI
measurements at 1m, 5m, 9m, and 13m.

IV. A NEW ATTENUATION RSSI LOG MODEL
The existing RSSI attenuation log model utilizes the
mean value of the RSSI measurements at a reference point
for its derivation. Relevant research shows that the RSSI
mean value is close to the representative RSSI value at that
point. Although this value is close to the representative RSSI
value, we find that there is some difference caused by some
error sources in indoor environments. For its analysis, we
collect 240 RSSI measurements at every reference point.
By analyzing Figures 2-5, after removing a small part of
outliers, we can find that the RSSI values measured at 1m
and 13m show Gaussian distributed characteristics and those
at 5m and 9m conform to the bimodal Gaussian distribution.
Therefore, we propose a new RSSI attenuation log
model, which can provide more precise ranging information.
The derivation procedures are presented below.
Firstly, we conducted an analysis based on the nature of
the collected RSSI values, then filtered out the abnormal
value, which produces a big difference with the average.
Secondly, according to Equation (5), we can get a
Gaussian
distribution
model
and
Bimodal
Gaussian
distribution model of the RSSI measurements at a reference
point.
Thirdly, according to Equation (7), we weigh filtered
RSSI measurements which comply with bimodal Gaussian
distribution to get the RSSI estimate at the reference point.
Finally, we propose a new RSSI attenuation log model,
which is valid for up to 15m range.
We take out this part of the RSSI value. Then, we
calculate the estimated RSSI value according to the selected
RSSI measurement values at a fixed point. We obtain
estimates
based
on
bimodal
Gaussian
distribution
or
Gaussian distribution respectively by processing 240 RSSI
data from 1 meter to 15 meters. The equation of mixed
Gaussian distribution is expressed as:

The maximum value of the first peak isܯܽݔଵ, and the
maximum value of the second peak isܯܽݔଶ. If

Mi ݊ is the minimum value between two peaks in
Equation (6). At this time, the 240 RSSI measurements we
have obtained are Gaussian distributions. Otherwise, they are
bimodal Gaussian distributions.

We use the above method to get the estimated value of
RSSI at the reference point.
A new attenuation log model can be composed using the
estimated RSSI values obtained from 240 RSSI measurement
values at a reference point in linear regression model.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In experiments, we use ipTIME N3004 as a node and
place those nodes at the height of 0.2m on the ground. To
reduce the impact of ground reflection on the received RSSI
value and the ranging error, the reference node is also placed
at 0.2m height. Broadcom 802.11 wireless network card
built-in notebook computer is used as a mobile node and is
located 1m away from a fixed node for measurement start.
The considered reference points are 2m apart sequentially to
each other. At each reference point, 240 times measurement
processes are executed. The experiments were carried out in
the third-floor corridor of Kyungpook National University
IT1 Building, as shown in Figure 6.

We compare the performance of the proposed RSSI
attenuation log model with that of an existing attenuation log
model.
We calculate RSSI values at reference points using mean
filtering and bimodal Gaussian filtering for 240 measurement
samples at each reference point. Then, we can obtain an
existing RSSI attenuation log model and the proposed RSSI
attenuation log model like below
Parameters of existing RSSI model: A = -23.84, n = 2.206
Parameters of proposed RSSI model: A = -21.81, n =
2.326
The attenuation log model curve is fitted according to
filtered RSSI values at reference points. After that, we can
obtain a proposed RSSI attenuation log model, which is valid
in range of 1m to 15m, as shown in Figure 7. The red line is
the proposed RSSI attenuation log model.

From Table 1, we can find that the proposed RSSI
attenuation log model provides more accurate distance
information compared with an existing RSSI attenuation
model. Experimental results show that the range error
decreases more evidently beyond the range of 10m, which
indicates that the proposed method can extend the applicable
range. At the same time, the proposed method reduces the
distance error at 11 meter reference point by 0.704m.
From the comparison results, we can conclude that the
proposed method improves the ranging accuracy to a certain
extent and reduces the influence of more substantial ranging
errors due to other factors, such as obstacles.
V.

In this paper, we propose a novel RSSI attenuation model
based on bimodal Gaussian filtering. The proposed method
produces
more
accurate
distance
information
and
is
applicable for more extended ranging case compared with an
existing RSSI attenuation log model method, which is based
on simple mean filtering.
