Abstract—Some users in a question and answer (Q&A) site use
multiple user accounts and attempt to manipulate communica-
tions in the site. In this paper, we ﬁrst show a proper reason
why many users in a Q&A site use multiple accounts from
the viewpoint of personal data protection. On the other hand,
we show some users can use multiple accounts inadequately
and manipulate communications in the site. In order to detect
these inadequate multiple account users precisely, we investigate
them from two new points of view. First point of view is the
number of accounts for submitting questions and manipulating
evaluations of their answers. Second point of view is the deviations
of answer submission order. We show these points of view are
useful for detecting inadequate multiple account users precisely.
The results of this study will give us a chance to investigate
communication strategies of users in a Q&A site, especially,
purposes and methods of inadequate multiple account users.
Keywords–multiple account; Q&A site; evaluation manipulation;
anonymity.
I.
INTRODUCTION
These days, many people use question and answer (Q&A)
sites, where users share their information and knowledge.
Q&A sites offer greater opportunities to users than search
engines in the following points:
1)
Users can submit questions in natural and expressive
sentences, not keywords.
2)
Users can submit ambiguous questions because other
users give some supports to them.
3)
Communications in Q&A sites are interactive. Users
have chances to not only submit questions but give
answers and, especially, join discussions.
As a result, Q&A sites are promising media. One of the
essential factors in Q&A sites is anonymous submission. In
most Q&A sites, user registrations are required for those
who want to join the Q&A sites. However, registered users
generally do not need to reveal their real names to submit
messages (questions, problems, answers, comments, etc.). It is
important to submit messages anonymously to a Q&A site.
This is because anonymity gives users chances to submit
messages without regard to shame and reputation. However,
some users abuse the anonymity and attempt to manipulate
communications in a Q&A site. For example, we showed
some users use multiple user accounts and submit messages
to a Q&A site inadequately [1]. Manipulated communications
discourage other submitters, keep users from retrieving good
communication records, and decrease the credibility of the
Q&A site. As a result, it is important to detect users suspected
of using multiple user accounts and manipulating communi-
cations in a Q&A site. In this case, identity tracing based on
user accounts is not effective because inadequate users are
likely to hide their true identity to avoid detection. A possible
solution is authorship identiﬁcation based on analyzing stylistic
features of messages. In recent years, a large number of studies
have been made on authorship identiﬁcation [2] [3] [4] [5] [6],
however, few researchers addressed the identiﬁcation issues
of authors suspected of using multiple user accounts and
manipulating communications in a Q&A site. To solve this
problem, we proposed methods of detecting
•
multiple account users suspected of submitting questions
and their answers repeatedly [7], and
•
multiple account users suspected of submitting many
answers to the same question repeatedly [8].
However, little is known about the purposes and methods of
inadequate multiple account users. As a result, it is important
to investigate these inadequate multiple account users from
various points of view. To solve this problem, we proposed
two new points of view for investigating inadequate multiple
account users [1] [9]. In this study, we discuss these two points
of view further and introduce them together for detecting
users suspected of manipulating evaluations of their answers
precisely.
First point of view is whether these inadequate users use two
or more accounts for submitting questions and manipulating
evaluations of their answers [1]. It is natural for them to use
multiple accounts for submitting questions. This is because
too many good evaluations from one account may give strange
impressions to other users and operators in the site. Inadequate
users do not want to draw attention to themselves. As a result,
in this paper, we investigate users suspected of using multiple
user accounts for submitting many questions and manipulating
evaluations of their answers.
Second point of view is whether these inadequate users use
multiple user accounts in different ways [9]. Suppose that one
user intends to advocate or justify his/her submitted answer
and uses multiple user accounts as follows:

•
a main account, and
•
secondary accounts for advocating or justifying his/her
answer submitted by the main account.
In this case, the deviation of answer submission order is likely
to occur. As a result, we investigate user pairs who had large
deviations of answer submission order and discuss the reasons
why and how the deviations occurred.
Finally, we should notice that it is difﬁcult to verify the cred-
ibility of our investigation. This is because there is no reliable
information about users who used multiple user accounts and
manipulated communications in Q&A sites. In order to discuss
the credibility of our investigation, we show the results of our
investigation in detail. The results of this study will give us
a chance to investigate communication strategies of users in
a Q&A site, especially, purposes and methods of inadequate
multiple account users.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section II,
we survey the related works. In Section III, we describe Yahoo!
chiebukuro for an example of Q&A sites. In Section IV, we
describe how inadequate users use multiple user accounts in
Q&A sites. In Section V, we investigate user pairs suspected
of using two or more accounts for submitting questions and
manipulating evaluations of their answers. In Section VI, we
investigate user pairs who had large deviations of answer
submission order and discuss the reasons why and how the
deviations occurred. In Section VII, we introduce the proposed
points of view together and show that they are useful for
investigating inadequate multiple account users in a Q&A site.
Finally, in Section VIII, we present our conclusions.

RELATED WORKS
One of the essential factors of the Internet is anonymity.
The author of [10] discussed the anonymity on the Internet
from various points of view. The author of [11] pointed that
anonymity is necessary in almost any protocol, application
or service used in wired or wireless networks, and showed a
survey on anonymity preserving solutions. These days, many
users abuse the anonymity. Take a Sybil attack for example.
In a Sybil attack, the attacker intends to gain large inﬂuence
on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network by creating and using a
large number of pseudonymous identities [12] [13]. Sybil
attacks are cheap and efﬁcient way to gain large inﬂuence on
P2P networks [14]. Similarly, in human online communities,
such as, web-based bulletin boards, chat rooms, and blog
comment forms, many users are thought to use multiple
user accounts inadequately and submit inadequate messages,
such as, deceptive opinion spams. In recent years, a large
number of studies have been made on authorship identiﬁcation
[2] [3] [4] [5] [6], however, few researchers addressed the
identiﬁcation issues of authors suspected of using multiple user
accounts and manipulating communications in the Internet.
One of the difﬁculties of this problem is that we did not have
sufﬁcient number of examples of inadequate multiple account
users. To solve this problem, some researchers tried to extract
inadequate submissions by using heuristic methods based on
text similarities and ranking results [15] [16]. On the other
hand, the authors of [17] pointed that these heuristic methods

were insufﬁcient to detect inadequate submissions precisely,
and showed they could detect inadequate submissions precisely
when they used large number of examples of inadequate
submissions. However, they obtained examples of inadequate
submissions by using Amazon Mechanical Turk [18]. The
examples of inadequate submissions created by workers in
Amazon Mechanical Turk have the following problems.
•
Little is known about the purposes and methods of
inadequate submissions. As a result, it is possible that
their instructions to workers in Amazon Mechanical
Turk were insufﬁcient.
•
There are unreliable workers in Amazon Mechanical
Turk [19].
As a result, it is important to obtain inadequate submissions
from the Internet. To solve this problem, we proposed meth-
ods of detecting inadequate multiple account users and their
submissions [7] [8]. However, as mentioned, little is known
about the purposes and methods of inadequate multiple account
users. As a result, it is important to investigate these inadequate
multiple account users and their inadequate submissions from
various points of view.

YAHOO! CHIEBUKURO
Yahoo! chiebukuro is one of the most popular community
sites in Japan. Users of Yahoo! chiebukuro submit their ques-
tions and answers in the next way.
•
User registrations are required for those who want to
join Yahoo! chiebukuro.
•
Users do not need to reveal their real names to submit
their questions and answers.
•
User accounts of submitters are recorded and shown in
their questions and answers.
•
Each user can submit his/her answer only one time to
one question.
•
The period limit for accepting answers is one week.
However, questioners can stop accepting answers before
the time limits.
•
After the time limits, questions with no answers are
removed and cannot be referable. On the other hand,
questions with answers can be referable.

Each questioner is requested to determine which answer
to his/her question is best and give a best answer label
to it.
Figure 1 shows that user A submitted one question to Ya-
hoo! chiebukuro and three users, user B, user C, and user
D answered the question, and then, user A selected user
D’s answer as a best answer. In this study, we used the
data of Yahoo! chiebukuro for observation and examination.
Chiebukuro means pearls of wisdom. The data of Yahoo!
chiebukuro was published by Yahoo! JAPAN via National
Institute of Informatics in 2007 [20]. This data consists of
about 3.11 million questions and 13.47 million answers, which
were posted on Yahoo! chiebukuro from April/2004 to Octo-
ber/2005. In the data, each question has at least one answer
because questions with no answers were removed. In order to
avoid identifying individuals, user accounts were replaced with
unique ID numbers. By using these ID numbers, we can trace
any user’s questions and answers in the data. Table I shows
•
the numbers of questioners and their questions in the
data, and
•
the numbers of answerers and their answers in the data.
In Table I, the number of questioners is the number of users
who submitted one or more questions to Yahoo! chiebukuro
from April/2004 to October/2005. Also, the number of answer-
ers is the number of users who submitted one or more answers
to Yahoo! chiebukuro from April/2004 to October/2005.
Furthermore, the following kinds of information are de-
scribed in the data.
•
submission time of question
•
submission time of answer
•
problem resolution time
Figure 2 shows an example of a series of events that occur after
a questioner submits his/her question to Yahoo! chiebukuro.
In Figure 2, the submission time of question q is tq. Also,
the submission time of answer a1 and a2 are ta1 and ta2,
respectively. Finally, the problem resolution time of question
q is tpr. At the problem resolution time, questioner Q stopped
accepting answers and determined which answer was the best
answer. By using these kinds of time information, we measured
•
submission time lags between questions and their an-
swers (e.g., ta1 − tq and ta2 − tq in Figure 2),
•
submission time lags between answers submitted to the
same question (e.g., ta2 − ta1 in Figure 2), and
•
answer submission order.
Figure 3 shows the cumulative relative frequency of the
submission time lags between questions and their answers in
Questioner Q submitted question q at tq. Also, answerer A1 and A2
submitted their answers at ta1 and ta2, respectively. Finally, ques-
tioner Q stopped accepting answers and determined which answer
was the best answer at tpr.

the data of Yahoo! chiebukuro. Also, Figure 4 shows the cumu-
lative relative frequency of the submission time lags between
answers submitted to the same question. As shown in Figure
4, the median of the submission time lags between answers
submitted to the same question in social issues category was
greater than those of PC category and all 286 categories. In
social issues category, there were many answers criticizing
or against previous answers. As a result, many answerers in
this category made and submitted answers after they read
other answers to the same question. We think this is one
of the reasons why the median of the submission time lags
between answers submitted to the same question in social
issues category was greater than those of PC category and
all 286 categories.
IV.
SUBMISSIONS BY USING MULTIPLE USER ACCOUNTS
There are many reasons why users in a Q&A site use
multiple user accounts. First, we discuss a proper reason. In
Yahoo! chiebukuro, users do not need to reveal their real
names to submit their questions and answers. However, their
submissions are traceable because their user accounts are
attached to them. Because of this traceability, we can collect
any user’s submissions and some of them include clues of
identifying individuals. Each clue (age, gender, location, oc-
cupation, hobby, health, and so on) is not sufﬁcient to identify
individuals, however, the combination of them is sometimes
sufﬁcient. As a result, to avoid identifying individuals and
protect personal information, it is reasonable and proper that
users change their user accounts or use multiple user accounts.

However, the following types of submissions by using multiple
user accounts are neither reasonable nor proper.
TYPE QA One user submits a question and its
answer by using multiple user accounts (Figure 5
(a)).
We think that the user intended to manipulate
the submission evaluation. For example, in Yahoo!
chiebukuro, each questioner is requested to deter-
mine which answer is best and give a best answer
label to it. These evaluations encourage answerers
to submit new answers and increase the credibility
of the Q&A site. We think that the user repeated
this type of submissions because he/she wanted to
get many best answer labels and be seen as a good
answerer.
(a) TYPE QA: one user submits a question and its answer by
using multiple user accounts. (In this case, user A submits a
question and its answer by using two user accounts.)
(b) TYPE AA: one user submits two or more answers to the
same question by using multiple user accounts. (In this case,
user C submits two answers by using two user accounts.)
Figure 5.
Two types of inadequate submissions: TYPE QA and TYPE AA.
TYPE AA One user submits two or more answers
to the same question by using multiple user accounts
(Figure 5 (b)).
We think that the user intended to dominate or
disrupt communications in the Q&A site. To be more
precise, the user intended to
•
manipulate communications by advocating or
justifying his/her opinions, or
•
disrupt communications by submitting two or
more inappropriate messages.

TYPE AA submissions are more similar to Sybil
attacks in P2P networks than TYPE QA submissions.
The more answers inadequate users submit by using
multiple user accounts, the easier they manipulate or
disrupt communications in a Q&A site.
These two types are not all types of inadequate submissions.
However, these kinds of submissions seriously disrupt commu-
nications in a Q&A site. For example, TYPE QA submissions
are serious because users can manipulate evaluations of mes-
sages by repeating TYPE QA submissions. Manipulated eval-
uations discourage other submitters, keep users from retrieving
good communication records, and decrease the credibility of
the Q&A site. Furthermore, we think we cannot use knowledge
and countermeasures obtained in studies of Sybil attacks in
P2P networks because TYPE QA submissions are different
from Sybil attacks. In a Sybil attack, the more pseudonymous
identities the attacker uses, the easier he/she gain large in-
ﬂuence on a P2P network. On the other hand, in a TYPE
QA submission, the inadequate user can get a best answer
label by using only two user accounts. To solve this problem,
we proposed methods of detecting multiple account users
suspected of repeating TYPE QA submissions [7]. However,
little is known about the purposes and methods of inadequate
multiple account users. As a result, it is important to investigate
these inadequate multiple account users from various points of
view. In this study, we introduce the following two points of
view for investigating inadequate multiple account users.
•
whether these inadequate users use multiple accounts for
repeating TYPE QA submissions, and
•
whether these inadequate users use multiple accounts in
different ways for repeating TYPE AA submissions.
Furthermore, we investigate users detected based on these point
of view and discuss whether these points of view are useful.
V.
DETECTION OF USERS SUSPECTED OF USING TWO OR
MORE ACCOUNTS FOR SUBMITTING QUESTIONS AND
MANIPULATING EVALUATIONS
From the standpoint of the number of user accounts for
submitting questions and manipulating evaluations of their
answers, inadequate multiple account users who repeat TYPE
QA submissions can be classiﬁed into two types:
•
inadequate users each of whom uses only one user
account for submitting questions and manipulating eval-
uations of his/her answers, and
•
inadequate users each of whom uses two or more user
accounts for submitting questions and manipulating eval-
uations of his/her answers.
In this section, we investigate the latter type of users, in other
words, users suspected of using two or more user accounts
for submitting questions and manipulating evaluations of their
answers.
A. Basic idea
Suppose that one user intends to manipulate evaluations of
his/her answers, submitted by using user account a, and repeats
TYPE QA submissions by using two user accounts, q1 and
q2. In this case, it is expected that we observe the following
unusual submissions:
•
user a submits too many answers to questions submitted
by user q1 and q2,
•
user q1 and q2 receive too many answers from user a,
and
•
user q1 and q2 give too many best answer labels to user
a’s answers.
Taking account of these points, we detect users suspected of
using two or more user accounts for submitting questions and
manipulating evaluations of their answers in the next way.
We ﬁrst detect user pairs suspected of repeating TYPE QA
submissions. Then, we detect answerers who are found in two
or more of the detected user pairs. The detected answerers are
suspected of using two or more user accounts for submitting
questions and manipulating evaluations of their answers.
B. Detection of users suspected of using two or more user ac-
counts for submitting questions and manipulating evaluations
of their answers
In order to detect users who intend to manipulate evaluations
of their answers and submit many questions by using two or
more user accounts, we propose a method that consist of the
following two steps:
1)
We ﬁrst detect user pairs of a questioner and an
answerer, who are suspected of repeating TYPE QA
submissions, as shown in Figure 5, by using three
hypotheses: Hypothesis QA1, QA2, and QA3.
2)
We detect users who are answerers in two or more
user pairs detected by using Hypothesis QA1, QA2,
and QA3.
Hypothesis QA1, QA2, and QA3 are as follows:
[Hypothesis QA1]
If user a did not submit unusually too
many answers to user q’s questions, we would expect that user
a submitted at most NQA1(q, a) answers to user q’s questions.
NQA1(q, a) = PQA1(q) × ans(a)
(1)
where ans(a) is the total number of answers submitted by
user a and PQA1(q) is the probability that an user selects
one question randomly and the question is one of user q’s
questions. Because each user of Yahoo! chiebukuro can submit
his/her answer only one time to one question, PQA1(q) is
PQA1(q) = qst(q)
Nqst
(2)
where qst(q) is the number of questions submitted by user
q and, as shown in Table I, Nqst is the total number of
questions in the data of Yahoo! chiebukuro. If this hypothesis is
rejected by an one-sided binomial test, we determine that user
a submitted unusually too many answers to user q’s questions.
The binomial test is an exact test of the statistical signif-
icance of deviations from a theoretically expected binomial
distribution of observations into two categories [21]. There are
two types of binomial tests: one sided binomial tests or two
sided binomial tests. When the critical area of a distribution is
one-sided, in other words, it is either greater than or less than

UPQA is the number of user pairs who are detected by binomial tests based on Hypothesis QA1, QA2, QA3, and QA3aux. UPQA2+ is the number of user pairs the answerers of
whom were found in two or more user pairs detected by binomial tests. AQA is the number of answerers who are found in user pairs detected by binomial tests based on Hypothesis
QA1, QA2, QA3, and QA3aux. AQA2+ is the number of answerers who are found in two or more user pairs detected by binomial tests based on Hypothesis QA1, QA2, QA3, and
QA3aux.
a certain value, but not both, only an one-sided binomial test
is generally applicable. In this study, the distribution area is
one-sided, we use the one-sided binomial test.
[Hypothesis QA2]
If user q did not receive unusually
too many answers from user a, we would expect that user q
received at most NQA2(q, a) answers from user a.
NQA2(q, a) = PQA2(a) × qst(q)
(3)
where qst(q) is the total number of questions submitted by
user q and PQA2(a) is the probability that an user received
one answer from user a when user a selected one question
randomly and answered it. Because each user of Yahoo!
chiebukuro can submit his/her answer only one time to one
question, PQA2(a) is
PQA2(a) = ans(a)
Nqst
(4)
where ans(a) is the number of answers submitted by user
a and, as shown in Table I, Nqst is the total number of
questions in the data of Yahoo! chiebukuro. If this hypothesis
is rejected by an one-sided binomial test, we determine that
user q received unusually too many answers from user a.
[Hypothesis QA3]
If user q did not give unusually too
many best answer labels to user a’s answers, we would expect
that user q gave at most NQA3(q, a) best answer labels to user
a’s answers.
NQA3(q, a) = PQA3(q) × fQA(q, a)
(5)
where fQA(q, a) is the number of answers submitted by user
a to user q’s questions, and PQA3(a) is the best answer ratio
of user a.
PQA3(a) = bestans(a)
ans(a)
(6)
where ans(a) is the number of answers submitted by user a
and bestans(a) is the number of best answers in user a’s
answers. However, if user j satisﬁes one of the following
conditions:
•
all user a’s answers were selected as best answers, in
other words,
ans(a) = bestans(a)
(7)
•
Hypothesis QA3aux, the auxiliary hypothesis for Hy-
pothesis QA3, is rejected, in other words, it is considered
that user a received too many best answer labels,
we set PQA3(a) as follows:
PQA3(a) = Nbestans
Nans
= Nqst
Nans
(8)
where Nbestans is the total number of best answers. Nbestans
is equal to Nqst because each question has one best answer. If
this hypothesis is rejected by an one-sided binomial test, we
determined that user q gave unusually too many best answer
labels to user a’s answers.
[Hypothesis QA3aux]
If user a did not receive unusually
too many best answer labels, we would expect that user a
received at most NQA3aux(a) best answer labels.
NQA3aux(a) = PQA3aux × ans(a)
(9)
where PQA3aux is the average best answer ratio.
PQA3aux = Nbestans
Nans
= Nqst
Nans
(10)
If this hypothesis is rejected by an one-sided binomial test, we
consider that user a received unusually too many best answer
labels.
C. Result of the Investigation
To evaluate our method, we conducted the detection of users
suspected of using two or more user accounts for submitting
many questions and repeating TYPE QA submissions, and
manipulating evaluations of their answers in a Q&A site. In
this experiment, the target users were all submitters in the data
of Yahoo! chiebukuro. As shown in Table I, the numbers of
the target questioners and answerers in the data of Yahoo!
chiebukuro are 165,064 and 183,242, respectively.

In our method, we varied the signiﬁcance levels for Hy-
potheses QA1, QA2, QA3, and QA3aux from 5 × 10−5 to
1 × 10−8 . They were extremely low because we intend to
detect extreme unusual submissions. Table II shows the results
of this experiment.
As shown in Table II, 59 users were detected when the
signiﬁcance level was 5 × 10−6. We should notice that 28
users of them were detected when the signiﬁcance level was
1×10−8. It shows that many users were detected although the
signiﬁcance level was extremely low. As we expected, there
are many users suspected of repeating TYPE QA submissions
and manipulating evaluations of their answers by using two or
more user accounts for submitting questions.
We checked questions and answers submitted by the de-
tected user pairs and found that some questioners were criti-
cized for their unfair best answer selections. For example, user
233650 was criticized that he/she selected user 678451’s an-
swers as best answers repeatedly and unfairly. After criticized
for his/her unfair best answer selection, user 233650 stopped
submitting any questions to Yahoo! chiebukuro. Our method is
useful for detecting these suspicious users. Furthermore, if we
detect and take care of these suspicious users, we can avoid
unnecessary frictions between users.
VI.
DETECTION OF TOO LARGE DEVIATIONS OF ANSWER
SUBMISSION ORDER
Inadequate users repeating TYPE QA submissions are likely
to use multiple user accounts as follows:
•
main accounts, and
•
secondary accounts for submitting questions and manip-
ulating evaluations of main accounts.
On the other hand, little is known how inadequate users
repeating TYPE AA submissions use multiple user accounts.
To solve this problem, in this study, we investigate whether in-
adequate users repeating TYPE AA submissions used multiple
user accounts in different ways as inadequate users repeating
TYPE QA submissions did, and discuss the purposes and
methods of them.
If one user uses multiple user accounts in different ways,
some deviations are likely to occur. Suppose that one user
intends to advocate or justify his/her submitted answer and
uses multiple user accounts as follows:
•
a main account, and
•
secondary accounts for advocating or justifying his/her
answer submitted by the main account.
In this case, the user is likely to submit ﬁrst answers from
his/her main account and other answers from their secondary
accounts. In order to detect this kind of inadequate users, we
introduce deviation of answer submission order.
[deviation of answer submission order]
Suppose user i
and user j submitted their answers to the same N questions,
and, user i submitted Ni answers earlier than user j and user
j submitted Nj answers earlier than user i. The deviations of
answer submission order of this user pair is Ni − Nj.
In this study, we investigate user pairs who had large
deviations of answer submission order. This is because, we
think, deviations of answer submission order give us a chance
to learn inadequate multiple account users from the new point
of view.
In Yahoo! chiebukuro, there were many questions the pur-
pose of which was to collect opinions. For example,
(Q)
What do you think about Prime Minister Koizumi?
He has maintained high approval ratings and does
well in his work.
This kind of question often had many answers. Some of
them were criticizing or against previous answers. Because
of such critical submissions, some users were likely to use
multiple user accounts and submit new answers for advocating
or justifying their previous answers. We think some users used
multiple user accounts as follows:
•
main accounts, and
•
secondary accounts for advocating or justifying their
answer submitted by the main accounts.
This is because it is easy to manage multiple user accounts.
When multiple user accounts were used as above, it is easy to
avoid submitting new answers that were inconsistent with the
previous answers. Inconsistent answers often gave suspicious
impressions to others. However, if multiple user accounts were
used in this way, the deviation of answer submission order is
likely to occur. As a result, in this study, we investigate user
pairs who had large deviations of answer submission order and
discuss the reasons why and how the deviations occurred.
A. Basic idea
In order to detect users who were suspected of repeating
TYPE AA submissions by using multiple user accounts in
different ways, we introduce two ideas. If one user repeated
TYPE AA submissions too many times by using two user
accounts, user i and user j, it is expected that
(idea 1) user i and user j submit too many answers
to the same questions together.
Furthermore, if the user used these two user accounts in
different ways, it is expected that
(idea 2) there are too large deviations of answer
submission order between user i and user j.
Based on these two ideas, we determine whether users repeated
TYPE AA submissions by using multiple user accounts in
different ways.
B. Most frequently encountered user
In order to explain our method of detecting too large
deviations of answer submission order, we introduce the term
most frequently encountered user.
Many users have other users who submitted answers to
the same questions with them. We will use the term most
frequently encountered user of a certain user to refer to a user
who submitted answers to the same questions most frequently
with the user.
[most frequently encountered user]
Suppose user i
submitted answers to the same questions with N users (k =
1, · · · , N), and among them, most frequently with user j.
mfe(i) = max
k∈N Nans together(i, k) = j

where mfe(i) is the most frequently encountered user of
user i and Nans together(i, k) is the number of questions to
which user i and k submitted answers together. Nmfe is the
total number of each user’s answers that were submitted with
his/her most frequently encountered user. For example, Nmfe
is 74,781 in social issues category. As a result, it is expected
that, when a user submitted 100 answers to social issues
category, the user and his/her most frequently encountered user
submitted
Nmfe
Nans
× 100 = 74781
403306 × 100 = 18.5
answers together to the same questions.
C. Detection of user pairs who submitted too many answers
to the same questions
As mentioned, if one person used two user accounts, user
i and user j, and repeated TYPE AA submissions in a Q&A
site too many times, it is expected that we observe unusual
submissions:
•
user i submitted unusually too many answers to the same
questions with user j.
To detect these unusual submissions, we test one hypothesis:
Hypothesis AA.
[Hypothesis AA]
If user i did not submit unusually too
many answers to the same questions with user j, we would
expect that user i submitted at most NAA(i) answers to the
same questions with user j.
NAA(i) = Nmfe
Nans
× ans(i)
where ans(i) is the total number of answers submitted by
user i. Nans is the total number of answers submitted to the
category, and Nmfe is the total number of each user’s answers
that were submitted with his/her most frequently encountered
user. If this hypothesis is rejected by an one-sided binomial
test, we determine that user i submitted unusually too many
answers to the same questions with user j.
D. Detection of user pairs who had too large deviations of
answer submission order
If one user repeated TYPE AA submissions by using two
user accounts, user i and user j, in different ways, it is expected
that we observe
•
too large deviations of answer submission order between
user i and user j.
To detect too large deviations of answer submission order
between user i and user j, we test one hypothesis: Hypothesis
AASO.
[Hypothesis AASO]
Suppose that there are NAA(i, j)
cases where user i and user j submitted their answers to the
same question. If one of these users did not submit answers
too many times before the other did, we would expect that
there are at most NAASO(i, j) cases where one user submitted
his/her answer before the other did.
NAASO(i, j) = PAASO(i, j) × NAA(i, j)
where PAASO(i, j) is the probability that one user submitted
an answer before the other did. In this study, PAASO(i, j)
was set to 0.5. In other words, user i and user j have equal
probability that one user submitted an answer before the other
did. If this hypothesis is rejected by a two-sided binomial test,
we determine that one of these users, user i or user j, submitted
answers unusually too many times before the other did.
E. Result of the investigation
In order to detect too large deviations of answer submission
order, we test Hypothesis AA and AASO. In this study, the
target user pairs are 23,053,308 user pairs each of whom
submitted answers to at least one same question in Yahoo!
chiebukuro. The signiﬁcance level for Hypothesis AA was
extremely low: 5 × 10−6. This is because we intend to
detect extreme unusual submissions. On the other hand, the
signiﬁcance level for Hypothesis AASO was 1 × 10−2.
In this experiment, we ﬁrst applied Hypothesis AA on
23,053,308 user pairs in Yahoo! chiebukuro, and detected
790 user pairs who repeated submitting answers to the same
question too many times. Then, we applied Hypothesis AASO
on these 790 user pairs and detected 382 user pairs who had too
large deviations of answer submission order. In order to discuss
the detection results in detail, we take the result in social
issues category for example. This is because there were many
discussions between answerers in this category. As a result, it
seems more likely that some multiple account users intended
to advocate or justify their answers and repeated TYPE AA
submissions in this category. The target user pairs in social
issues category are 828,812 user pairs. We applied Hypothesis
AA on these 828,812 user pairs and detected 20 user pairs
who repeated submitting answers to the same question too
many times. Then, we applied Hypothesis AASO on these
20 user pairs and detected 7 user pairs who had too large
deviations of answer submission order. Table III shows the
result of the investigation on these 7 user pairs. In Table
III, user A1 mainly submitted answers before user A2 did.
NAA(A1, A2) is the number of questions to which both user
A1 and user A2 submitted answers. NEAA(A1, A2) is the
number of questions where user A1 submitted answers before
user A2 did. TQA(A1, A2) is the median of submission time
lags between questions and the earlier of their answers of
A1 or A2. TAA(A1, A2) is the median of submission time
lags between answers of A1 and A2 submitted to the same
question. Figure 3 shows the cumulative relative frequency of
submission time lags between questions and their answers.
Also, Figure 4 shows the cumulative relative frequency of
submission time lags between answers submitted to the same
question. By considering the similarity of writing styles and
opinions, we determined whether each user pair is one and the
same user or not. Decision shows our judgements. We discuss
•
whether each of these 7 user pairs is one and the same
user or not,
•
the purposes of inadequate multiple account users, and
•
the reasons why and how the deviations of answer
submission order occurred
in detail below.

NAA(A1, A2) is the number of questions to which both user A1 and A2 submitted answers. NEAA(A1, A2) is the number of questions where user A1 submitted answers before
user A2 did. TQA(A1, A2) is the median of submission time lags between questions and the earlier of their answers of A1 or A2. TAA(A1, A2) is the median of submission
time lags between answers of A1 and A2 submitted to the same question. Decision shows our judgements. By considering the similarity of writing styles and opinions, we determined
whether each user pair is one and the same user or not.
User pair (267614, 76731) submitted many answers to the
questions about foreign residents in Japan. We determined that
user 267614 and 76731 were one and the same user. This is
because their writing styles and opinions were quite similar
and their answers often included special words, for example,
personal HP and comic artists, which other users did not cover
in this category. These accounts were likely to be used for
repeating the same words. For example,
[Q: 654871]
I found this exhibitor in the auction [URL].
I think it is against the rule.
[A: 76731]
It is scratchbuild. Let it go. You are a snitch.
[A: 267614]
You are like a snitch in North Korea. Or a
hound.
We thought there was plenty of this kind of inadequate users
in Yahoo! chiebukuro. Our method detected user pair (267614,
76731), however, it was not enough. This is because we did not
think of any reasons why this kind of users used their multiple
user accounts in this way. We are searching more examples of
this kind of inadequate users and intend to ﬁnd the reasons.
Also, in case of user pair (691911, 802184), we determined
these users were one and the same user. This is because the
median of submission time lags between their answers was
only 83 seconds although user 691911 submitted answers at
different times of a day. In addition, user pair (691911, 802184)
had too large deviations of answer submission order in 9
categories, including social issues category. Furthermore, when
user 691911 submitted questions, user 691911 selected user
802184’s answers as best answers in too many times in various
categories. In addition, like the case of user pair (267614,
76731), these accounts were likely to be used for repeating
the same words.
In contrast, in cases of user pair (458523, 518681) and
(414445, 733881), we determined that the users of each pair
were different users. This is because we found many opinion
conﬂict between the users of each pair. Each pair used Yahoo!
chiebukuro almost at the same time of each day. For example,
user 458523 and 518681 mainly used Yahoo! chiebukuro from
8:00 am to 5:00 pm. Also, user 414445 and 733881 mainly
used Yahoo! chiebukuro from 8:00 pm to 1:00 am. As a
result, the users of each pair read questions almost at the same
time. On the other hand, the median of submission time lags
from questions to user 458523’s answers and user 518681’s
answers were 9.9 minutes and 28 minutes, respectively. Also,
Figure 6.
The relation between user pair (649164, 622996) and (471690,
471692).
the median of submission time lags from questions to user
414445’s answers and user 733881’s answers were 7.4 minutes
and 66 minutes, respectively. We think that these time lags gave
the deviations of answer submission order between the users
of each user pair.
Both user pair (649164, 622996) and (471690, 471692)
submitted answers repeatedly to questions about a certain
religious group. We determined that the users of each pair
were one and the same users. This is because they had similar
writing styles and opinions respectively. Especially, there was
only one opinion conﬂict between user 649164 and 622996
just after they were pointed out that they were one and the
same user. As shown in Table III, user 622996 and 471692
mainly submitted their answers after user 649164 and 471690
did, respectively. In both cases, two user accounts were used
in different ways as follows:
•
main accounts (user 649164 and 471690), and
•
secondary accounts (user 622996 and 471692) for criti-
cizing other users’ answers, or advocating or justifying
answers submitted by the main accounts
and repeated TYPE AA submissions. Especially, user 471692
often criticized user 622996’s answers. As a result, user pair
(622996, 471692) was detected although the users of this pair
were different users and had different opinions. Figure 6 shows

VII.
DETECTION OF INADEQUATE MULTIPLE ACCOUNT
USERS FROM NEW POINTS OF VIEW
In this section, we introduce the two points of view, de-
scribed in Section V and Section VI, together for investigating
inadequate multiple account users in a Q&A site and discuss
the effectiveness of them.
Table IV shows the number of user pairs
•
the answerers of whom were found in two or more user
pairs detected by binomial tests based on Hypothesis
QA1, QA2, QA3, and QA3aux and
•
who were detected by binomial tests based on Hypoth-
esis AA and AASO.
Table V shows the number of answerers
•
who were found in two or more user pairs detected by
binomial tests based on Hypothesis QA1, QA2, QA3,
and QA3aux and
•
who belong to user pairs detected by binomial tests
based on Hypothesis AA and AASO.
We take the result under the signiﬁcance level of 5×10−6 for
example. As shown in Table IV, when the signiﬁcance level
was 5 × 10−6, 537 user pairs were detected by binomial tests
based on Hypothesis QA1, QA2, QA3, and QA3aux. Among
them, we found 188 user pairs the answerers of whom were
found in two or more user pairs detected by the binomial
tests. Among them, the following 6 user pairs were detected
by binomial tests based on Hypothesis AA and AASO.
•
user pair (236956, 32780),
•
user pair (494870, 434516),
•
user pair (302153, 434516),
•
user pair (652657, 528067),
•
user pair (479505, 528067), and
•
user pair (691911, 802184).
The ﬁrst users of them were questioners and the second users
were answerers when they were detected by binomial tests
based on Hypothesis QA1, QA2, QA3, and QA3aux. The
accounts of these answerers are thought to be main accounts
of inadequate multiple account users. In this experiment, we
varied the signiﬁcance levels for Hypotheses QA1, QA2, QA3,
and QA3aux from 5 × 10−5 to 1 × 10−8. However, as shown
in Table V, four answerers (user 32780, 434516, 528067, and

NAA(A1, A2) is the number of questions to which both user A1 and A2 submitted answers. NEAA(A1, A2) is the number of questions where user A1 submitted answers before
user A2 did. TQA(A1, A2) is the median of submission time lags between questions and the earlier of their answers of A1 or A2. TAA(A1, A2) is the median of submission
time lags between answers of A1 and A2 submitted to the same question.
802184) were detected in each case. The result shows that
there are few users who used secondary accounts for repeating
both TYPE QA and TYPE AA submissions. This is because
inadequate users do not want to draw attention to themselves.
Next, we investigate the detected 6 user pairs. Table VI
shows the number of answers and best answers of them. On
the other hand, Table VII shows the deviations of answer
submission order of them. We determined that each user pair
was one and the same user. We show the reasons in detail
below.
First, we discuss user pair (691911, 802184). In Section VI,
we determined user 691911 and user 802184 were one and the
same user. This is because the median of submission time lags
between their answers in social issues category was only 83
seconds although user 691911 submitted answers at different
times of a day. Furthermore, as shown in Table VI, user 691911
received 146 answers from user 802184, and selected 143
answers of them as best answers. Also, as shown in Table
VII, this user pair had large deviations of answer submission
order in 9 categories. In addition, user 691911 submitted many
questions about the meaning of technical terms. For example,
[Q: 691911]

is the difference between earthquake intensity and

691911 submitted 10 questions (including this question) in
a row and received 10 answers from user 802184, each of
which showed the URL of the Japan Meteorological Agency
FAQ page. User 691911 selected all these answers as best
answers. The reason why this user submitted trivial questions
like them is thought that the user wanted to increase the
number of his/her best answers without drawing attention to
himself/herself.
Next, we discuss user pair (236956, 32780). As shown in
Table VI, user 236956 received 282 answers from user 32780
and selected 275 answers of them as best answers. Also, user
pair (236956, 32780) had large deviations of answer submis-
sion order. Furthermore, user 236956 received the following
two answers from user 443403.
[A: 443403]
I am quite sure that the ﬁrst answerer will
commit a criminal act!

[A: 443403] Are you guys all fools?????????????????
In both answers, user 443403 criticized other answerers. It is
noteworthy that user pair (443403, 32780) was detected by
binomial tests based on Hypothesis QA1, QA2, and QA3. We
think that user 32780, user 236956, and user 443403 are one
and the same user. It may be not enough for the user to select
his/her answers as best answers and show that he/she is a good
answerer. The user could not help but criticize other users. In
other words, the user did TYPE QA submission and TYPE
AA submission at the same time.
Next, we discuss user pair (494870, 434516) and user
pair (302153, 434516). User pair (302153, 434516) was not
detected when the signiﬁcance level was less than 5 × 10−6.
However, we think user 302153, user 434516, and user 494870
are one and the same user. This is because we found examples
where the user did TYPE QA submission and TYPE AA sub-
mission at the same time. For example, user 494870 received
an answer in which user 434516’s answer was criticized. Then,
user 302153 submitted the following answer as if he/she was
criticized.
[A: 302153]
What are you talking about? Can you show
BA right now? This is a grammar problem. “need
to study more”, who do you think you are?
User 302153 submitted 14 answers to user 494870’s questions
and in many of them he/she criticized other users as he/she
did in this answer.
Finally, we discuss user pair (652657, 528067) and user pair
(479505, 528067). As shown in Table VI, user 652657 received
199 answers from user 528067 and selected 95 answers of
them as best answers. Also, user 479505 received 110 answers
from user 528067 and selected 55 answers of them as best
answers. In both cases, the best answer ratios were unusually
high, however, they were lower than those of the other 4
detected user pairs. As a result, in order to determine whether
user 479505, user 528067, and user 652657 are one and the
same user or not, it is important to discuss the reason why
the best answer ratios were low. Until August 2005, user
652657 submitted his/her questions to various categories, such
as adult issues category and baseball category, and received
22 answers from user 528067 and selected 20 answers of
them as best answers. On the other hand, from September
2005, user 652657 and user 479505 submitted their questions
mainly to Yahoo! auction category and often did not select user
528067’s answers as best answers. In Yahoo! auction category,
user 652657 and user 479505 often submitted questions about
violative items in Yahoo! auction, especially, used underwears.
For example,
[Q: 652657] Oh, No! Violative item! Do something! [URL]
[A: 528067] So, report it by yourself. [URL] [URL]
[URL] is the URL to the page of the violative item. User
528067 showed the URL twice in this example. The question
seemed to be the report of the violative item in Yahoo! auction.
However, many other users thought that the user aimed to
advertise the violative item. As a result, many answers of
protest were submitted to user 652657’s subsequent questions.
[Q: 479505]
I found a traditional store in this ﬁeld. How
amazing! [URL]
Figure 7.

question.
[A: 103719] You dummy. So what?
[A: 652657] Prestige store !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [URL]
[A: 88887]
No advertisement. No advertisement. No
advertisement.
[A: 290533]
What do you mean? I didn’t get your point.
Is it because the seller received high evaluations?
[A: 581219] Advertisement?
[A: 367799] As long as there are violations, please report
them. I’ll be rooting for you.
[A: 528067] Get it eliminated. [URL] [URL]
In this example, user 479505 received 7 answers from 7 users.
4 answerers of them criticized user 479505. User 88887 and
user 581219 accused user 479505 of advertising violative
items. Also, user 103719 and user 290533 criticized user
479505 for submitting the ulterior question. On the other hand,
two of the other 3 answerers, user 652657 and user 528067,
were suspected of being the same user. Also, user 528067
was suspected of being the same user as the questioner, user
479505. Furthermore, user 367799 was suspected of being
the same user as user 528067. This is because user pair
(367799, 528067) was detected by binomial tests based on
Hypothesis QA1, QA2, and QA3. As a result, user 367799,
user 479505, user 528067, and user 652657 were suspected
of being the same user. Figure 7 shows the relations of users
in this example. Until September 2005, the user seemed to
select his/her answers as best answers eagerly. However, in the
example above, the user seemed to submit one question and
three answers although he/she could select only one answer
as a best answer. Actually, in this example, user 367799’s
answer was selected as a best answer. It is thought that
his/her submission reason was changed from the best answer
collection to the advertisement of auction items. As a result,
the best answer ratio was lower than those of other user pairs
suspected of being inadequate multiple account users. In our
previous studies [7] [8], we put off the decision about whether

user 479505, user 528067, and user 652657 were one and the
same user or not because the best answer ratios of them were
lower than those of other detected user pairs. However, by
introducing new points of view, we determined that these users
were the same user. Furthermore, we collected the examples
that show that the advertisement is one of the reasons for using
multiple user accounts inadequately. As a result, it is important
to investigate inadequate multiple account users from various
points of view.
VIII.
CONCLUSION
In this study, we investigated users suspected of using
multiple user accounts and manipulating evaluations of their
answers from various points of view. We ﬁrst discussed reasons
why users in a Q&A site use multiple user accounts. We think
many users use multiple user accounts reasonably and properly,
however, some users use them improperly. For example, there
are many users suspected of using two or more user accounts
for submitting questions and manipulating evaluations of their
answers. In order to detect inadequate multiple account users,
we proposed two detection methods [7] [8]. However, little is
known about the purposes and methods of inadequate multiple
account users. Actually, we found some suspicious users in our
previous studies, however, it was difﬁcult to determine whether
they were inadequate multiple account users because of insuf-
ﬁcient information. To solve this problem, it is important to
investigate them from various points of view. As a result, in this
study, we introduced two new points of view for investigating
inadequate multiple account users:
•
the number of user accounts for submitting questions
and manipulating evaluations of their answers.
•
the deviations of answer submission order.
Then, we investigated users in the data of Yahoo! chiebukuro
from these points of view and found that
•
the introduced points of view were useful for detecting
inadequate multiple account users precisely,
•
there were few users who did TYPE QA submission and
TYPE AA submission at the same time, and
•
some users might use multiple user accounts for pur-
poses other than evaluation manipulation.
We intend to use the results of this study for further investiga-
tion of purposes and behaviors of inadequate multiple account
users in Q&A sites. Especially, we intend to avoid unnecessary
frictions between users in Q&A sites by detecting and taking
care of these inadequate users.
