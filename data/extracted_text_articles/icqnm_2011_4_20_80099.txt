is
solved
by

extended range of the input voltage (at least

I. INTRODUCTION
CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor)
active resistors [1][2][3][4] are very important blocks in
VLSI analog designs, mainly used for replacing the large
value passive resistors, with the great advantage of a much
smaller area occupied on silicon. Their utilisation domains
include amplitude control in low distortion oscillators,
voltage controlled amplifiers and active RC filters. These
important applications for programmable floating resistors
have motivated a significant research effort for linearising
their current-voltage characteristic. The first generation of
MOS active resistors [1] [2] used MOS transistors working
in the linear region. The main disadvantage is that the
realized active resistor is inherently nonlinear and the
distortion components were complex functions on MOS
technological parameters. A better design of CMOS active
resistors is based on MOS transistors working in saturation.
Because
of
the
quadratic
characteristic
of
the
MOS
transistor,
some
linearization
techniques
[3][4]
were
developed in order to minimize the nonlinear terms from the
current-voltage characteristic of the active resistor. An
important class of these circuits, referring to the active
resistors with controllable negative equivalent resistance,
covers a specific area of VLSI designs, finding very large
domains of applications such as the cancelling of an
operational amplifier load or the design of Deboo [5]
integrators with improved performances.
The original idea proposed in this paper is to use a linear
CMOS differential amplifier for obtaining (with minor
changes in the design) two important functions:
 Simulation (in a first-order analysis) of a perfect linear
resistor using exclusively MOS active devices, having the
advantages of a very good controllability of the equivalent
resistance and of an important reduction of the silicon
occupied area, especially for large value of the simulated
resistance;
 Simulation of a controllable negative resistance circuit
with improved linearity;

In order to obtain a linear behavior of the proposed
differential structure, the
ISQ
output current of the squaring
circuit “SQ” must be the sum of a constant term and a term
proportional with the square of the differential input voltage:

The proposed method for designing the required voltage
squaring circuit is based on a differential amplifier (Figure
3), having a controllable asymmetry between the geometries
of its composing transistors. This difference between the
aspect ratios of MOS transistors will introduce in the output
currents of the differential amplifier a term proportional with
the square of the differential input voltage.
