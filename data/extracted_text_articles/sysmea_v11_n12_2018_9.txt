Abstract—Measurement systems are used in every scientific 
and technological process to measure and monitor a number of 
magnitudes. During last years, open source technology and, 
concretely, open source hardware devices are being introduced 
in different R&D projects due to their advantages of low cost, 
easy development, shared information in the Internet and so 
on. Arduino microcontroller is the most illustrative example of 
this kind of devices. This paper presents a measurement system 
based on Arduino board to perform biogas sensing. A set of 
sensors are responsible of measuring the gases that compose 
the biogas (hydrogen, methane, ammonia and carbon 
monoxide) and the results are displayed to the user via a small 
graphical monitoring interface. The development of the system 
is reported and initial results are provided to demonstrate the 
suitability of the microcontroller. 
Keywords- measurement system; Arduino; open source; 
monitoring; biogas. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Every scientific and technological process requires to 
measure and monitor variables of different nature 
(analog/digital) that inform about the behavior or state of 
such process. To this aim, measurement systems follow the 
common architecture depicted in Fig. 1. A physical process 
needs to be monitored and/or controlled, so a set of sensors 
measure the representative magnitudes. These sensors are 
linked to a microprocessor or microcontroller-based board, 
which is responsible of acquiring and processing their 
signals. In Fig. 1, both the sensors and the board are 
considered into the block named Measurement Acquisition 
System (MAS) for a higher level of generality. A Monitoring 
Interface (MI) exchanges data with the microcontroller in 
order to provide useful information, by means of numerical 
or graphical displays, to the user. 
 
 
Figure 1.  General diagram of measurement systems. 
The present paper reports the development of a 
measuring system for biogas sensing using a development 
board called Arduino, which is based on a microcontroller. 
This 
board is 
commonly referred to 
as 
Arduino 
microcontroller. Diverse considerations about the proposed 
system as well as initial results are also provided. 
Particularly, an Arduino Mega board and a set of four 
sensors 
(methane, 
ammonia, 
carbon 
monoxide 
and 
hydrogen) constitute the MAS; whereas a LCD screen plays 
the role of MI. This manuscript is an extended version of the 
congress contribution in [1]. 
A scientific domain where measurement systems are 
profusely applied is that related to Renewable Energy 
Sources (RES), which gains increasing attention both from 
governments and R&D initiatives around the world. As it 
well-known, the dependency on fossil fuels needs to be 
decreased so RES are progressively being introduced in the 
energetic scenario. Within RES, photovoltaic and wind 
energies are the most exploited due to their availability. 
Nonetheless, other important source is available as a result of 
the human activities, namely biogas. Biogas is a combustible 
fuel generated by the disposal of waste, and composed by a 
variable mixture of methane (50-70%) and carbon dioxide 
(30-50%), and also minimal quantities of nitrogen, hydrogen 
and water vapor (Fig. 2). Biogas can be produced in natural 
means or in a sealed, oxygen-free container named anaerobic 
digester, from the reactions of biodegradation of the organic 
matter, by the action of microorganisms in the absence of 
oxygen [2].

versatility and widespread application for diverse scopes, in 
the authors’ humble opinion, it is suitable to act as the core 
of a measurement system to determine the composition of 
biogas. In this sense, the main contribution of this work is 
the development of a fully functional measurement system 
for biogas using such an inexpensive open source 
microcontroller. This paper is envisioned to provide useful 
insights about the implementation of such system, which can 
be a valuable resource for scientists and scholars involved in 
R&D activities related to biogas fuel. 
The remainder of the paper is as follows. Section II is 
devoted to provide a brief review of measuring systems and 
Arduino microcontroller applications in order to highlight 
the relevance of our proposal. Section III deals with the 
description of the developed system, both hardware and 
software approaches. Finally, main conclusions and further 
works are outlined in Section IV. 
II. 
BRIEF REVIEW ABOUT MEASURING SYSTEMS AND 
ARDUINO 
This section provides a background about the utilization 
of Arduino platforms, mainly in the context of measuring 
systems. 
A noteworthy remark is that open source technology, 
comprising both hardware and software, constitutes an ever-
growing trend during last years [3]. The open source tools 
provide the developer with the ability to perform in-depth 
configurations since the source code, schematics and 
documentation are available. As a consequence, these means 
offer serious advantages regarding low, or even inexistent, 
economic costs and custom-designed approaches.  
On the contrary, the main drawback is that programming 
and/or hardware related skills are commonly required. In 
addition, there is no customer support, which can be an 
important boundary for professional solutions. This kind of 
tools is achieving increasing presence in different 
technological and scientific scenarios. For instance, modern 
paradigms 
like 
the 
global 
pervasive 
network 
of 
interconnected devices known as the Internet of Things (IoT) 
will take advantage of open source hardware and software 
projects [4, 5]. 
Regarding open source hardware, Raspberry Pi, 
BeagleBone, Phidget, OpenDAQ, Intel Edison and Arduino 
boards are devices of this nature that are being more and 
more exploited. Low-cost, ease of use and wide availability 
have opened a new door to democratize electronics [6]. Open 
source philosophy implies that a great variety of information, 
examples and tutorials are shared by a collaborative 
community through the Internet, embracing development 
based on this type of devices.  
Arduino is a low-cost single-board microcontroller [7] 
and is the prevalent open source hardware device. 
Concerning R&D and Academia activities, Arduino 
constitutes a merging trend, which has become a powerful 
tool to develop different applications in the fields of data 
acquisition, automation and engineering in general [8]. 
The versatility of this microcontroller is validated by the 
numerous applications reported. Out of the measurement 
systems sphere, it has been used for humanoid robotic [9], 
greenhouse control [10], fuzzy cognitive maps [11], remote 
laboratories for engineering education [12-15], ZigBee-based 
communication [16], cyber-physical systems [17, 18] and as 
electronic 
interface 
between 
Programmable 
Logic 
Controllers (PLCs) and sensors [19-21]. 
Concerning measurement-centered approaches, recent 
works 
report 
Arduino 
applications 
for 
agricultural 
instrumentation [22, 23], monitoring of photovoltaic systems 
[24-27], environmental monitoring [28, 29], Wireless Sensor 
Networks 
(WSNs) 
implementation 
[30], 
air 
quality 
monitoring [31], sensors deployment in Unmanned Aircraft 
Vehicles (UAVs) [32] or for monitoring hydrogen fuel cells 
[8, 33]. 
There is a wide diversity of Arduino boards with 
different sizes and resources. For instance, Uno, Yun, Mini, 
Nano, Mega, Duemilanove, Extreme, Lilypad, etc., so the 
developer can choose the model that fits better the 
application to implement. In the present case, the Mega 2560 
R3 board has been chosen. 
The developed system corresponds to the block diagram 
shown in Fig. 1. The functions of the MI as well as a further 
connectivity link are provided by the so-called shields. They 
are expansion cards with additional features that can be 
directly coupled on the main board. There are an increasing 
number of shields devoted to diverse tasks: data 
visualization, motor control, sensors connection, data 
storage, 
etc. 
Therefore, 
these 
cards 
facilitate 
the 
developments using Arduino, for instance, in the proposed 
approach; a display is used to provide information to the user 
as described in the next section. 
Some advantages of the Arduino boards are now listed in 
order to emphasize the suitability of such a device for the 
purpose of the present work: 
 
 
Low cost. The cost of an Arduino Mega board is 
around 40€ whereas a commercial data acquisition 
board costs about 450€. 
 
Open 
hardware. 
All 
the 
schematics 
and 
documentation 
related 
to 
the 
Arduino 
microcontroller as well as to the shields are freely 
available in the Internet. 
 
Availability of expansion cards. The shields 
constitute an important advantage to promote the 
applications of Arduino since they facilitate the 
connection and configuration of additional features 
or devices. 
 
Great information shared by the community. 
Tutorials, forums and videos offer knowledge freely 
available that contribute to develop Arduino-based 
projects. 
 
Rapid development. As a result of the previous 
consideration, the time and effort required to design 
and implement systems including Arduino are 
shorten. 
 
Continuous 
improvements. 
The 
open 
source 
community continuously enhances the Arduino 
resources like libraries and shields, helping to

improve already existent systems or to design new 
approaches. 
 
Increasing application in R&D domain. As it has 
been expounded, Arduino is widely used as tool to 
develop a multiplicity of R&D applications. 
III. 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE MEASUREMENT SYSTEM 
This section deals with the description of the main 
features of the elements that compose the presented 
measurement system as well as their interconnection and 
configuration. For a better comprehension of the proposal, a 
block diagram of the whole system is provided in Fig. 3. 
 
 
Figure 3.  Diagram of the implemented prototype of measurement system. 
A. Arduino microcontroller 
The measurement system developed in this work is based 
on the open source hardware Arduino microcontroller, model 
Mega 2560 R3. Through this microcontroller we can read the 
data, display them on a screen and share them with other 
devices via Modbus. 
The hardware consists of a printed circuit board with an 
ATmega2560 microcontroller. It includes 54 digital 
input/output ports, 16 analog inputs, 4 UARTs, a 16 MHz 
crystal oscillator, a power jack, an In Chip Serial 
Programmer (ICSP) header and a reset button. It also 
includes a USB connection port from where it is possible to 
power the board and establish communication with the 
computer. 
In order to visualize the concentrations of the different 
gases that make up the biogas, an LCD graphic display will 
be used, which in fact acts as MI. It has been opted for a 
graphic LCD of 128x64 points with an ST7920 controller. 
For the connection of the LCD screen with Arduino, it has 
been decided to use the serial communication under the 
Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) protocol.  
The SPI bus is a communications standard, used mainly 
for the transfer of information between integrated circuits. It 
includes a line of clock, incoming data, outgoing data and a 
select chip pin, which connects or disconnects the operation 
of the device with which one wishes to communicate. In this 
way, this standard allows multiplexing the clock lines. Fig. 4 
depicts the SPI bus scheme. 
On the Arduino Mega 2560, the SPI port is located on 
pins 50 to 53.  
The connection between the MI and the Arduino Mega 
are as shown below (Fig. 5). 
 
Figure 4.  SPI bus scheme of connections. 
 
 
Figure 5.  Connection between the MI and Arduino. 
In order to use the Modbus TCP/IP protocol to access the 
sensor readings an Ethernet port must be added to the 
Arduino Mega. For this purpose, an Ethernet shield that fits 
perfectly with this version of Arduino will be used. 
Specifically, the Hanrun HR911105A Ethernet shield model 
was chosen, which uses the Wiznet W5100 Ethernet chip to 
allow Internet connection.  
This Ethernet shield uses the SPI protocol to share the 
information with the Arduino board. Exactly, it uses the pins 
of the ICSP Port of the Arduino Mega for the connection. As 
can be seen in the Arduino Mega port scheme, the ICSP Port 
also allows connection with the SPI protocol. The physical 
assembly of this shield is very simple, it simply has to be 
inserted in the Mega Arduino and it will be connected and 
fixed. 
Four already available commercial sensors of the 
manufacturer Figaro [34] are used to measure methane 
(model TGS3870), ammonia (model TGS2444), carbon 
monoxide 
(model 
TGS5042) 
and 
hydrogen 
(model 
TGS821). For further details about the features of theses 
sensors and the auxiliary electronic circuitry, see reference 
[35]. 
Furthermore, apart from the Arduino board and the 
Ethernet shield and the LCD screen, to develop this 
prototype, a series of auxiliary electronic circuits are needed 
to operate the sensors. These auxiliary circuits are 
responsible for generating pulses, amplifying signals and 
sampling them.

B. Software implementation 
For the implementation of the microcontroller script, 
known as sketch, the software consists of the Integrated 
Development Environment (IDE) based on the Processing 
environment and a programming language, a simplified 
version of the C++ language, as well as on the bootloader 
that is executed on the board. The Arduino IDE is a free 
software package that allows programming all Arduino 
boards. The microcontroller is programmed by a computer 
via the IDE and using serial communication via a RS-232 to 
TTL serial level converter. Moreover, open source libraries 
are used to configure the additional modules, in the present 
case, the Ethernet shield and the LCD screen.  
The developed software consists on the programming of 
the data acquisition from the sensors, the conditioning and 
scaling of the measured signals and the presentation of the 
results in the LCD screen. 
To control the graphic display, the U8g2 library has been 
chosen, a library that allows the use of a large number of 
monochrome displays with different controllers, including 
the one used in this work (ST 7920). 
For the ModBus TCP/IP protocol, three libraries have 
been used; two of them are specific to Arduino IDE, such as 
SPI.h and Ethernet.h, which allow us to use the Ethernet 
protocol in this project. And the third one is Modbus Library 
for Arduino. This library implements the industrial 
communication protocol ModBus in Arduino, allowing the 
use of the Series physical layer (RS232 or RS485) or 
Ethernet (TCP/IP). Fig. 6 shows the beginning of the 
Arduino sketch where the libraries are included. 
 
 
Figure 6.  Libraries included in the sketch. 
1) Library U8g2: Next, the operation of the U8g2 
library will be briefly described. First, an object is defined 
to select the type of display, the size and type of buffer used. 
It is defined that the controller of the graphic LCD screen is 
the ST920: the screen resolution chosen has been 128 x 64 
pixels. In addition, to remove load from the CPU, the 
hardware buffer that incorporates the controller has been 
used. The SPI port is used for the LCD communication and 
the Arduino pin 48 is defined as chip select line to enable 
the SPI slave. Once the library is configured, the 
Starting_Screen () function will be executed within the 
program's void setup ().This function is responsible for 
starting the screen and displaying an initial animation every 
time the Arduino is started. Fig. 7 shows the corresponding 
code. 
 
 
Figure 7.  Starting screen funtion of the  U8g2 library. 
2) Modbus Library: The operation of the Modbus 
library is concisely explained hereafter. First of all a 
ModbusIP object will be defined. This object will contain 
all the configuration and data registers. To make better use 
of the memory, the analog readings are scaled and 
transferred directly to the corresponding Modbus register. 
Once transferred to the Modbus registers, they will already 
be accessible from a remote master. Fig. 8 shows the 
corresponding code.

IV. 
INITIAL OUTCOMES 
The prototype is within a testing phase in order to 
evaluate its behavior and to detect improvements or 
corrections to carry out. In this sense, diverse experiments 
are being accomplished; some of them devoted to check the 
sensors’ measurements whereas other trials are focused on 
the microcontroller performance. For instance, in the first 
group of experimentations, the repeatability of the

measurements is being studied. On the other hand, some 
delays are introduced into the Arduino sketch in order to 
establish the optimal sampling time.  
A. Final assembly 
In Fig. 9, the diagram of the final assembly is shown. The 
central element of this prototype is the Arduino Mega, with 
which all the peripherals communicate.  
 
 
LCD screen: Communicates with Arduino through 
the SPI bus. 
 
Ethernet Shield: Communicates with Arduino 
through the SPI bus. 
 
Gas sensors: Communicates with Arduino through 
analog signals between 0 and 5V.

measurement system once assembled in the laboratory 
approach.

The physical assembling of the gas sensors is enabled by 
means of a custom-designed methacrylate box (Fig. 11), 
which hosts the sensors and makes the gas to circulate for 
being measured.

As a proof of concept, Fig. 12 shows a photograph of the 
prototype working, where can be appreciated that the MI 
provides real time data about the biogas composition.

B. Discussion and considerations 
Once 
the 
prototype 
has 
been 
described, 
some 
considerations from the authors’ perspective are commented 
below. 
 
Biogas sensing can be effectively solved using the 
open source microcontroller Arduino. 
 
The instrumentation required is already available but 
must be interfaced with the Arduino board with 
custom designed circuitry. The availability of shields 
devoted to connect sensors for gas measurement 
would reduce the time and effort of development. 
 
The wide range of connectivity interfaces provided 
by Arduino allows an easy development of 
networked communication. 
 
As a consequence of the available information about 
Arduino-related projects, the effort necessary to 
become familiar with the microcontroller resources 
has been relatively short. In fact, the time devoted to 

98
International Journal on Advances in Systems and Measurements, vol 11 no 1 & 2, year 2018, http://www.iariajournals.org/systems_and_measurements/
2018, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
configure the Arduino board has been shorter than 
that required to configure the sensors. 
 
Further improvements of Arduino libraries and/or 
shields will enrich the proposed system. 
 
Some minor drawbacks have been found during the 
development such as a weak physical connection 
between the GLCD and the main board, as well as 
inaccuracy of the sample time achieved by the 
microcontroller. 
 
The prototype must be assessed under real operation 
conditions in order to check its robustness. 
 
Reliability and repeatability of the measurements 
must be studied before an intensive utilization of the 
prototype. 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
A 
measurement 
system 
based 
on 
the 
Arduino 
microcontroller devoted to biogas sensing has been 
presented. A set of sensors are responsible of measuring four 
gases, namely hydrogen, methane, ammonia and carbon 
monoxide. On the other hand, the Arduino board performs 
the signal processing of the acquired data and establishes the 
percentage of each gas, displaying such information by 
means of a small screen, which acts as MI. 
This system is still under development and validation; 
nonetheless, initial outcomes at laboratory scale demonstrate 
the suitability of Arduino microcontroller for biogas sensing.  
Arduino acts as the core of the developed measurement 
system, providing important advantages like low cost, open 
source hardware, great amount of information available in 
the Internet and easy configuration, just to name a few. As it 
is evident, this device also presents some drawbacks, being 
the main one the inaccuracy of the sampling time. 
Further works are focused on integrating the proposed 
approach with a monitoring and supervisory system in order 
to enable real time visualization of the biogas composition. 
In addition, the networked operation to provide cloud-
enabled measurements storage is also being considered.
