Abstract—As social, economic, and cultural environments have
rapidly been changing, uncertainties and complexities have
also increased with regard to research and development
projects. Issues are across various fields and interconnected
with different problems, which makes it harder to plan and
design R&D projects and to estimate their effects as well.
Linear and sequential approaches are not appropriate to deal
with
these
changes.
Rather,
circular
and
simultaneous
perspectives with more precision and rigor are needed. To this
end, more information should be gathered and all parties
concerned should be required to cooperate. It becomes
essential to establish a science’s evidence based and integrated
system supported by all parties concerned for high quality and
effective policy making.

SCIENCE OF SCIENCE POLICY
Some
of
the
advanced
countries
have
recognized
challenges and started to run a variety of programs such as
science of Science and Innovation Policy to create the 3rd
generation innovation systems for science and technology.
The concept and term of Science of Science and Innovation
Policy was first brought up and coined by Dr. Marburger of
American Association for the Advancement of Science
(AAAS) in 2005. This was based on the recognition that it is
indispensable to understand complex relationships between
R&D
investments
and
innovation
together
with
their
consequent improvements of competitiveness and social
benefits for policy effectiveness [1].
Among governing bodies attempting to make policy
decisions scientific are Science of Science and Innovation
Policy(SciSIP)
of
the
US
and
European
Innovation
Scoreboard(EIS) and European Research Area WATCH of
EU. Value-based technology innovation such as ‘knowledge
intensification and creative design’ becomes more important
in securing competitiveness of businesses and nations. All
these factors increase the needs for IT infrastructure and in-
depth studying of intellectual business system which support
policy decision making based on scientific evidence [2].
However,
the
linear
approaches
to
technological
innovation model and policy supporting instruments so far
have clear limitations to effectively deal with these technical
changes and complex issues.

DESIGN OF DECISION MAKING SUPPORT SYSTEM
Current researches has stemmed from systems dynamics
based on systems theory and feedback thinking, and evolved
into
cybernetics
and
automatic
control
mechanism.
Interdisciplinary researches on new models of knowledge-
based dynamics and policy aid have been required more than
ever as
high-technologies have
converged
and
policy
management system has changed [3]. In this paper, we
propose mechanisms to achieve the service provision of
Science of Science Policy. For this purpose, current
processes are analyzed to identify factors, which need to be
improved and analytical methodologies are also defined [4].
Then, major components are developed to effectively
support the processes according to each methodology [5].
Evidence-based knowledge is utilized in the activities of
policy adoption, implementation, and evaluation including
decision-making [6]. When designing specific integration
models, each Situation(S) is represented by unit of Topic(T),
which equals Term(T) used in natural language. The
integration model conducts text-mining by processing all
documents and texts within the system into natural language,
resulting in abstracting representative terms. This generates a
knowledge model through analysis of relations between
topics and layered structures of resources. Related to
processes and tasks of the knowledge model, an Address of
document repository is defined as a process and Task is
defined as a name of the specific document directory.
The
model
which
generates
knowledge
models
automatically is defined as below:
Policy Making Supporting Model：M = {Process, Task,
Resource}
Process：P = Document Repository {Address1, … Addressn}
Task：T = Document Directory {Name1, … Namen}
Resource Element：Topic：E = Mining {Term1, … Termn}
A component of a process is defined as task flow and
relation and is designed so as to combine an integrated
information system and service. With regard to collection of

policy information, information has been collected on the
basis of a component supporting tasks. Knowledge base
integration of policy information has progressed through
structuration of task-specific data and information as shown
in Table I.

SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT
Specific policy processes and task connection models are
needed for effective service structure, and integrated process
maps should be designed to address components and
information such as for example data and documents. The
service of Science of Science Policy aims to improve the
efficiency and reliability of producing policy alternatives. It
is very important that while utilizing massive data and
sharing
instruments,
we
analyze
various
functions.
Therefore, a
component-based
development
method
is
appropriate and it should be comprised of unitary system for
organic combination of the services. For example, various
reference information is needed on fields, stages, and targets
to be used both as a forecasting basis and for validity
analysis. However, a particular expert or outdated data have
been the only materials that policy community has depended
on.
Improved
science
policy
support
systems
cause
improvements in the effective activities of the proportion of
researchers with the report, as shown in Table 2. Thus, the
new service for technology analysis helps produce more
objective and timely materials of technology value analysis
and validity analysis through information on technology
trends and massive database analysis on publication, patents,
and market as shown in Table 3. For this reason, the database
we reference provides 2.68 million data on publication,
patents, and market and analysis of 0.34 million items of
documents on policy trends.

CONCLUSIONS
This study has established an integrated knowledge base of
policy support for the service of Science of Science Policy
by standardizing and specifying processes. This approach
has
required
organizing
and
comprising
the
specific
functions on a basis of component units according to demand
from stakeholders such as major information demanders, its
users request patterns and policy decision makers. In turn,
these works have made it possible to create the service of
Science Policy which can control major policies on a real-
time basis by catching and tracking policies’ current states in
the processes of adopting, implementing, evaluation and thus
support evaluation and coordination of them based on
objective data.
