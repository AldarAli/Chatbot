 INTRODUCTION  
Nowadays, DVB-T2 (2nd Generation Digital Terrestrial 
Television Broadcasting) standard is definitely the world’s 
most advanced DTT (Digital Terrestrial Transmission) system, 
which offers robustness and high efficiency for terrestrial 
broadcasting  [1]. It is built on the technologies used as part of 
the first-generation system (DVB-T), developed over a decade 
ago. DVB-T2 extends the possibilities of all parameters of 
DVB-T and significantly reduces overhead to build a system 
with a throughput close to theoretical channel capacity  [2],  [3]. 
DVB-T2 specification includes many innovations in system 
parameters. The combination of LDPC (Low Density Parity 
Check) and BCH (Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquengham) codes give 
a very robust channel coding. Moreover, several options are 
available in areas such as the number of carriers, GI (Guard 
Interval) sizes and pilot signals. Therefore, the overheads can 
be optimized for any target transmission channel  [1]-  [3]. The 
advanced coding and interleaving techniques  [2] offer good 
performance in so called non-selective channels. However, 
frequency selective channels (with deep fadings) need extra 
redundancy, previously given by a lower-rate code.  
DVB-T2 also includes a novel technique of constellation, 
so called rotated constellation, which is one of the main 
innovations in DVB-T2 system configuration. It is an optional 
feature to improve performance even for very frequency 
selective channels  [3]. The technique of the rotated 
constellation and the idea of its use in communication systems 
are not new. This method has been studied since 1997, when 
Giraud et al. presented the lattice constellations for the 
Rayleigh fading channel  [4]. 
After then, in  [5] an alternative diversity technique 
for Rayleigh fading channel was presented, which was 
achieved by the high diversity modulation schemes (rotation 
of constellation points). Now, the exploring of the possibilities 
of rotated constellation technique was used for the improving 
of the DVB-T2 system performance. In  [6] and  [7] the rotated 
constellation technique has been analyzed in terms of BER 
(Bit Error Ratio) evaluation. For the exploring of its 
performance a Rayliegh (P1 channel) and RME (Rayleigh 
Memoryless Erasures)  [2] fading channel models were used. 
On the other hand, the appropriate design of the rotated 
demapper on the receiver side is very important  [8]. When 
rotated constellation is not used, the LLRs (Log Likelihood-
Ratios) soft decision metrics can be derived in the normal, one-
dimensional way  [2], well known from DVB-T. In case of 
rotated constellation the 2D LLR demapping is used. In  [9] a 
very promising solution of this problem was presented, where a 
novel detection method (QAM detector) also reduces the 
demand of the computational resources. 
In this work in progress paper, the investigation is focused 
on the performance of the rotated constellation in DVB-T2 
standard from the perspective of transmission distortion 
in frequency selective channels. To demonstrate simply 
transmission distortions, a two path, 0 dB Echo channel was 
used  [2]. Moreover, this article proposes and evaluates 
a configuration that has been optimized for the mentioned 
channel conditions. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. After the 
introduction and related state-of-the-art works review in the 
area of rotated constellation, a brief description of the main 
differences between the non-rotated and rotated constellation 
techniques is presented in Section II. The parameters and short 
description of used channel model for the analysis and 
simulation are presented in Section III. Section IV contains the 
graphical dependences of the BER before and after LDPC 
decoding on C/N (Carrier-to-Noise Ratio) ratio for both, non-
rotated and rotated constellation modes. Finally, the results are 
evaluated and discussed in Section V.

NON-ROTATED AND ROTATED CONSTELLATIONS 
A. Non-Rotated Constellation 
A constellation diagram is a representation of a signal 
modulated by a digital modulation scheme, such as QAM. 
In DVB-T2 standard, it is a selection from QPSK, 16QAM, 
64QAM or 256QAM modulation. In a classical, non-rotated

constellation, the receiver needs both I (In-Phase) and 
Q (Quadrature) components of one constellation point to 
identify, which information was transmitted. The reason is that 
the estimation of I component does not give information about 
a Q component  [6]. 
B. Rotated Constellation 
As it was mentioned before, DVB-T2 standard introduces 
a novel technique to improve performance in selective fading 
channels. In case of the rotated constellation (see Fig. 1), 
a certain rotation angle is applied in the complex plane to a 
classical signal constellation. Then each component (I or Q), 
has enough information by its own to guess, which was the 
transmitted symbol  [6]. Of course, the performances gain, in 
case of this technique, depends on the rotation angle. These 
angle values are different for each type of modulations in 
DVB-T2 and their exact value (see Fig. 2) can be found in  [2].  
Of course, only the rotation of constellation points is not 
enough for achieving a good performance. The additional 
innovation, and also the trick, is that the rotated constellation 
comes with Q-delay (after the constellation mapping). Delay 
means in this context that the Q components are shifted to the 
next COFDM (Coded Orthogonal Frequency Division 
Multiplexing) cell. This cyclical delay is realized on the level 
of individual FEC (Forward Error Correction) blocks  [7],  [10]. 
Thank to the combination of rotated constellation and Q-
delays, I and Q components are now separated by the 
interleaving process (in cell, time and frequency) so that in 
general they are transmitted on different frequencies, different 
carriers and at different time. Therefore, if the channel destroys 
one of the components (I or Q) the other component (Q or I) 
can be used to recover the information  [2]. 
III. 
SIMULATION PARAMETERS 
A brief description of two constellation techniques for 
DVB-T2 broadcasting standard was presented in the previous 
section. Due to the innovations in constellation mapping, DVB-
T2 standard enables to improve the performance of data 
reconstruction on the receiver side, when the transmission 
conditions contains a lot of fadings. For the comparison 
of differences between the mentioned constellation techniques, 
we used a special type of fading channel, 0 dB Echo, 
well known from DVB-T. 
The 0 dB Echo channel profile has been defined by 
Motivate partners  [2]. Its composition has been largely 
influenced by the nature of the DVB-T/T2 signal. Concretely, 
it is defined by the following parameters:  
• 
Spread spectrum technique - introducing ICI (Inter 
Carrier Interference) sensitivity to Doppler spread,  
• 
Guard Interval - introducing IS (Inter Symbol) 
sensitivity to the echo delays. 
This profile is made of two paths, having the same power 
(0 dB). These echoes are delayed by half of the GI value and 
they are presenting a pure Doppler characteristic  [2]. 
The general graphical representation of the impulse and 
frequency response of 0 dB echo channel is shown in Fig. 3 
and Fig. 4. The Tg is representing the value of the GI.

The implementation of functional model for the simulation 
of DVB-T2 transmission in MATLAB was done as it is 
recommended in  [2]. For the simulation of the DVB-T2 
transmission the following settings were used: 
• 
mode: 2k (mobile reception), 
• 
LDPC code ratio: 1/2 (robust protection), 
• 
modulation: QPSK and 16QAM, 
• 
constellation: non-rotated and rotated, 
• 
rotation angle [Φ]: 29.0 (QPSK) and 16.8 (16QAM), 
• 
Guard Interval: 1/16 (mid SFN - Single Frequency 
Network), 
• 
decoding method: LDPC + BCH (with 50 iteration, as 
recommended in  [2]).

IV. 
SIMUALTION RESULTS 
Simulation results of the DVB-T2 transmission for various 
C/N ratios in the 0 dB Echo fading channel were obtained. 
The simulation was done for two types of constellation 
technique: rotated and non-rotated. 
DVB-T2 uses concatenated LDPC + BCH coding, the same 
as in DVB-S2 (2nd Generation Satellite DVB). These codes 
assure better protection, allowing more data to be transported 
in a given channel. It means that, for achieving a good signal 
quality (low BER); a lower C/N ratio is needed. In this paper, 
the limit of the error-free reception is considered as C/N for 
which BER is equal to 1.10-5 after LDPC decoding, as it is used 
in  [6]. The number of iterations in LDPC decoding 
is depending on the hardware complexity of the receiver. 
In this paper, the number of iterations is equal to fifty (50) 
as recommended in  [2].

As mentioned above, for the comparison of the 
performance of the non-rotated and rotated constellation 0 dB 
Echo channel was used. This type of channel is the worst case 
channel, which consists of two paths, with equal level and the 
second arriving later than the first as shown in Fig. 3. In this 
paper, we used configuration for the mobile scenario (2k mode) 
with mid size (GI = 1/16) of the SFN network. Therefore, the 
delay of the second path is equal to 7 us. Moreover, for the 
increase of the fadings in the channel, the speed of the receiver 
was set to 50 km/h. 
Fig. 5 and Fig. 7 illustrate the BER before the LDPC 
decoding for QPSK and 16QAM modulations, when non-
rotated and rotated constellation techniques were used. In these 
figures the effect of 0 dB echo fading channel can be observed. 
The BER decreases with the increased C/N ratio only slightly. 
The BER before the LDPC decoding (not corrected data) 
in both cases of non-rotated and rotated constellation are very 
similar. As can be seen, at this point, the performance of the 
non-rotated and rotated constellation is almost the same and 
any significant differences can not be found. 
On the other hand, visible differences in achieved BER can 
be seen after the LDPC decoding, which are shown in Fig. 6 
for non-rotated constellation, for rotated constellation in Fig. 8. 
In case, when we are using non-rotated constellation, for 
achieving a 1.10-5 BER it is needed high value of C/N ratio: 
13.2 dB for QPSK and 19.3 dB for 16QAM modulation 
(see Tab. I). In case of rotated-constellation these values are 
9.8 dB for QPSK and 16.5 dB for 16QAM modulation. 
It should be noted that the maximum gain is obtained, when 
QPSK modulation with rotated constellation was used. 
This can be easily explained, since this modulation is the most 
robust to fadings. On the other hand, in comparison with 
classical constellation technique, the gain was better by 3 dB 
for both types of modulations, when the rotated-constellation 
technique was used.  
V. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS 
In this paper, the performance of the rotated constellation 
for DVB-T2, with comparison of non-rotated constellation, 
was explored. It has been shown that for fading channels with 
very bad conditions, a good performance can be obtained with 
rotated constellation. On the other hand, only the features 
of rotated constellation are not allowed for achieving a good 
signal quality. Unconditionally, the mentioned innovation 
of FEC coding/decoding, which is used in DVB-T2, has 
a significant role. Thank to the number of decoding processes 
(50 iterations in this simulation), which is used in this paper, 
the results in the special 0 dB Echo fading channel are much 
better. This advantage of DVB-T2 standard also improves the 
BER ratio in the fading channel  [11]. The additional robustness 
can be used to increase the data rate by choosing a higher code 
rate while keeping the same minimum field strength. 
This work will continue in the future by improving the 
rotated constellation technique for the analysis and simulation 
the transmission distortions in all possible scenarios, which 
can occur in DVB-T2 system configurations  [12]. The work 
will be also focused on the investigation of the performance 
of rotated constellation in, so called, erasures channels. In case 
of DVB-T2 this is the RME channel  [2]. Finally, the MER 
(Modulation Error Ratio) for both constellation techniques 
should be investigated deeper.
