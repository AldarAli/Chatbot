Abstract—The Internet plays an important role in our life
as social infrastructure, and the importance of reliability is
widely recognized in the Internet. There are many studies on
network design with high reliability but most of them intend for
constructing a single network that a network operator governs.
However, the Internet consists of many of small networks, which
are mutually connected. Therefore, it is important to enhance
reliability of inter-connected network consisted from two or more
networks rather than focusing only on the reliability inside
the single network. In this paper, we show how we should
connect two networks for achieving high reliability of inter-
connected network. We evaluate the reliability with various
kinds of connecting structures. Evaluation results show that high
reliability is achieved by a multiscale structure where links for
inter-connection are prepared for connecting nodes belonging to
different hierarchical level in the network.

INTRODUCTION
The number of users connected to the Internet is increas-
ing through mobile terminals and various services such as
social networking service are deployed. The Internet plays
an important role in our life as social infrastructure, and
therefore reliability is one of the important characteristics for
the Internet.
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) construct their own net-
works to accommodate the trafﬁc of customers with a mini-
mum of equipment costs while keeping the reliability against
failures of equipment [1]. A key functionality to keep the
reliability is the restoration, i.e., re-route packets when failures
occur. Network operator of ISP envisions kind of failures and
then designs physical topology and capacity of links so that the
network works under the envisioned failures. However, when
more signiﬁcant failures than initially envisioned, the network
becomes out of control, that is, it may work or may not work.
The network operator faces on the difﬁculty in deciding the
scale of failures of undertakings.
In previous studies, a single node failure and/or single link
failure were supposed as the failure of equipment [2], [3]. The
fundamental approach of these studies is to enumerate all of
failure patterns and then prepares physical links or determines
the capacity of links to accommodate trafﬁc demand for all of
failure patterns. However, it is easily imagined that such the
approach encounters the difﬁculty in designing networks when
the size of simultaneous failures envisioned increases. The
reliability against multiple node/link failures is investigated in
[4], [5]. They focus on the statistical characteristics of topology
and investigate the relation between the characteristics and the
reliability under the multiple failures. Results show that the
power-law network where the probability of existence of nodes
having k links is proportional to k−γ (γ is constant) loses its
connectivity easily when nodes with high degree are failed,
but the power-law network is reliable against random node
failures.
Above studies intend for enhancing reliability of an ISP
network that the network operator governs. However, the
reliability of the Internet is achieved not only by the enhancing
reliability of ISP networks but also by enhancing reliability of
inter-connected network, where two or more ISP networks are
mutually connected, since the Internet consists of many of ISPs
which are mutually connected. In this paper, we investigate
the reliability of inter-connected network that consists from
two networks and their connecting links. Hereafter, we will
call the inter-connected network as global network, and call
its consisting networks as local networks. Our concern is
how we should connect a limited number of inter-connected
links between local networks to make the global network to
be reliable against multiple failures. Note that we evaluate
connecting structure between local networks rather than the
topological structure of local network itself, since the reliability
of local network has been investigated in the above studies.
Recently, the reliability of electronic network that consists
from power-grid network and its control network is discussed
[6]–[8]. Since the control network requires the power from
the power-grid network, the authors investigate that how to
inter-connect two networks such that reliability against cascade
failures is maximized. The cascade failure is successive failures
caused by a cascade of power-outage which is triggered by an
initial failure point. They pointed out that the global network is
reliable against cascade failures when two local networks are
connected with links through “similar” nodes. That is, inter-
connected links should be prepared between nodes with similar
degree or similar clustering coefﬁcient. Unlike the electronic
network where nodes of control network must be connected
with the power-grid network, communication network does
not require full connectivity between two networks. Rather,
it is important for communication networks to reduce the
number of inter-connected links to keep the reliability to some
extent. Note again that our concern of this paper is how
we should connect a limited number of inter-connected links
between local networks, which is particular to communication
networks.
This paper is organized as follows. We introduce related
work of this paper in Section II. Section III shows the topology
model that we use for the evaluations. In Section IV, we
evaluate reliability with various classes of connecting structure
against node failures. Finally, Section V concludes this paper
and mentions the future work.

RELATED WORK
Dodds et. al. showed a network construction algorithm
that constructs ﬁve classes of networks and compared their
robustness [4]. The algorithm starts from a hierarchical tree
topology with branching ratio b and L levels of branching.
Then, the algorithm adds m links chosen stochastically with
a probability. The probability that there exists a link between
two nodes, say i and j, is denoted as P(i, j) and is determined
by the depth Dij of their nearest common ancestor aij. The
probability is also determined by node’s own depths di and dj
(Fig. 1). Formally the probability P(i, j) is deﬁned as,
P(i, j)
∝
e−Dij/λe−xij/ζ,
(1)
where λ and ζ are tunable parameters. xij represents the dis-
tance between two nodes i and j and is set to (d2
i +d2
j −2)1/2,
which represents relative distance in the hierarchy [4]. By
changing the values of λ and ζ, this algorithm generates
topologies with various topological structures. The authors cat-
egorized generated topologies into the following ﬁve classes.
•
Random (R) by setting (λ, ζ) → (∞, ∞): links are
added randomly.
•
Random interdivisional (RID) by setting (λ, ζ) →
(0, ∞): more links are added for smaller value of Dij,
but do not take care of xij. That is, the link between
nodes that have large distance.
•
Local Team (LT) by setting (λ, ζ) → (∞, 0): links
tend to be added between nodes that have short
distance, regardless of their layer in hierarchy.
•
Core-periphery (CP) by setting (λ, ζ) → (0, 0): links
tend to be added between nodes located at higher-
level in hierarchy, and between nodes that have short
distance. The resulting topology exhibits densely con-
nected “core” and sparsely connected “edge” network.
•
Multiscale (MS) with intermediate values of λ (0 <
λ <1) and ζ (0 < ζ <1). The resulting topology has
connectivity dominated by the range from a small xij
to a large xij. The resulting topology has a property
that the link density decreases as the hierarchical level
decreases.
The authors evaluated two kinds of robustness. One is
congestion robustness and the other is connectivity robustness.
Congestion robustness is measured by the maximum conges-
tion that imposes a load of packet processing at node. Connec-
tivity robustness represents the size of the largest connected
component remaining after failures. Their evaluation reveals
that the multiscale structure improves both the congestion
robustness and connectivity robustness.

CONNECTING STRUCTURE FOR INTER-CONNECTED
NETWORK
In this section, we present a model of connecting structure
between two local networks inspired by the network con-
struction algorithm explained in the previous section. There
are two local networks: local network A and local network
B. The global network (inter-connected network) is formed
by connecting links between A and B. Depending on a
strategy where to connect, various connecting structure can
be arranged.
Fig. 1.
Illustrative example of the network construction algorithm (Dij = 2,
di = 2, and dj = 1)
For developing the model, we assume that two local
networks are identical. Note that such the assumption does not
reﬂect the actual network. However, we use the assumption in
this paper since our main concern is to reveal fundamental re-
liability of inter-connected network and investigate differences
of the reliability on various connecting structures. Actually, the
reliability may be different dependent on things of each local
network. We will consider networks having different topology
as a future work. We also assume that the local network has
a hierarchy structure and has a level of hierarchy.
Let us consider that the probability P(i, j) which represent
the probability of link existence between node i from local
network A and node j from local network B. Then, we
calculate connection probability P(i, j) of all nodes pairs
(i, j), which is deﬁned as,
P(i, j) ∝ e−Dij/λe−xij/ζ.
(1)
Note that this equation is the same to the equation in [4].
However, we change the deﬁnition of each notation to apply
our problem that connects two local networks. First, we
redeﬁne the distance xij by using three values di, dj, and
dl. Hereafter, we use a node j′ of local network A instead
of a node j of local network B. Node j′ of local network A
corresponds to the node j of local network B. Note again that
we assume that local networks A and B are identical to reveal
the reliability of global network. In our model, di is deﬁned as
the number of upstream hops in the shortest path from source
node i to a common ancestor aij′. Similarly, we deﬁne dj as
the number of downstream hops from a common ancestor a′
ij′
to node j. dl represents horizontal distance in the hierarchical
local network and is set to the shortest hop length between
i and j excluding di and dj. In this paper, we introduce a
concept of horizontal distance to consider a non-tree-based
topology as the local network. Dodds et al. [4] consider the
tree-based topologies for network construction and the non-
tree-based topology is not treated. Illustrative example of di,

deﬁned as (d2

After calculating connection probability, we connect two
nodes belonged to different local networks. We select con-
nected nodes pair i and j according to P(i, j). We then connect
between node i in local network A and node j in local network
B. We repeat adding links between two local networks until
the number of inter-connected links reaches m.
By changing the parameters λ and ζ, we generate some
classes of inter-connected topology. We use the same deﬁnition
of classes in the way of [4] (shown in Table I and Fig.
3). However, Multiscale structure is deﬁned as the middle
parameters of other four structures, so we cannot set the unique
value for Multiscale structure. Therefore, we evaluate some
parameters other than (λ, ζ) = (0.5, 0.5). We set the number
of inter-connected links to 50, 100, and 200.

RELIABILITY EVALUATION OF INTER-CONNECTED
NETWORK
A. Local Network
We prepare a local network based on BA model [9].
BA model is a well-known generation model for topology
whose degree distribution follows a power-law. The BA model
incrementally adds a new node, and the new node connects
with existing nodes by a preferential manner, i.e., new nodes
tends to connect higher degree node. The detailed of algorithm
to generate the BA topology is as follows:

(b) Local Team
(c) Random Interdivisional
(d) Core-periphery
(e) Multiscale

In this paper, we consider four patterns of local network by
changing values of (n, m) to (500, 2), (500, 3), (1000, 2),
(1000, 3). m0 is set to 3 for all patterns. Hierarchical level of
BA topology is deﬁned by the hop count from the node with
largest degree in the local network.
B. Performance Metrics
We evaluate the average hop length and the connectivity
when multiple failures occur. Hereafter, N denotes the number
of nodes and B denotes the largest connected component after
the failures occur.

H denotes the average hop length for all pairs of

(2)
where dij is the shortest hop length from node i to
node j calculated by Dijkstra’s shortest path algo-
rithm.
•
Connectivity C
C denotes the ratio of the number of nodes in B to a
set of all survived nodes, which is deﬁned as
C =
|B|
N − |r|,
(3)
where r is a set of failed nodes. |B| and |r| means the
number of elements in each set.
C. Reliability against node Failures
In this section, we consider the scenario that a node failure
occurs at random one by one.
1) Parameter settings for Multiscale Structure: As we
discussed in Section II, Multiscale structure is intermediate
of other four structures (Random, Local Team, Random In-
terdivisional, Core-periphery). Since the parameters λ and ζ
takes various values, we ﬁrst investigate the best values of the
parameters for multiple node failures. In [4], setting λ to 0.5
and zeta to 0.5 exhibits best parameter setting for improving
robustness for constructing a local network. A question of this
paper is whether setting λ to 0.5 and ζ to 0.5 is best or not.
In [4], congestion robustness is improved when the Mul-
tiscale structure close to the Core-periphery structure. We
therefore investigate the parameter set which is close to Core-
periphery structure. More speciﬁcally, we evaluate reliability
by changing λ and ζ from 0.1 to 0.5 by 0.1, respectively.
We calculate average of C and H for 100 patterns of local
networks having 500 nodes with average degree 2. The number
of inter-connected links is set to 200.
For obtaining best parameter settings, we change ζ from
0 to 0.5 while λ is ﬁxed. When λ is set to 0.1, 0.1 for zeta
exhibits best reliability in terms of connectivity and average
hop count. We next set λ to 0.2, but again 0.1 for ζ exhibits
best reliability. Finally, we obtained that setting ζ to 0.1 is best
for λ 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, except when λ is set to 0.4; setting ζ
to 0.4 exhibits best reliability. Figure 4 shows connectivity C
and average hop-count H for different value of λ. For each
value of λ, ζ is chosen such that the reliability is maximized.
Comparing results with various λ, we observe that the average
hop length is minimized when (ofλ, ζ) is (0.1, 0.1), but this
is so close to Core-periphery structure that we do not select
the parameters as Multiscale structure. Though we cannot
see notable differences on the average hop length and the
connectivity, we select is (0.3, 0.1) as the parameter (λ, ζ) since
the connectivity C is slightly higher than other parameters.
The reason for showing high reliability is that MS (0.3,
0.1) has more inter-connected links that connect nodes at 2nd
layer than MS (0.5, 0.5). To clarify this, we show the number
of nodes in each layer in Table II, and the number of inter-
connected links dependent on layers in the hierarchy in Table
III (MS (0.5, 0.5)) and Table IV (MS (0.3, 0.1)). When (λ, ζ)

is set to (0.3, 0.1), the number of inter-connected links related
to 2nd layer is 72, which is larger than the case of MS (0.5,
0.5). In the case of BA topology, nodes at 2nd layer tend to
connect with node at 1st layer, i.e., largest degree node. The
average hop length is therefore decreased for MS (0.3, 0.1).
From these observations, we investigate MS (0.3,0.1),
which we set λ to 0.3 and ζ to 0.1, as well as MS (0.5, 0.5)
for Multiscale structure.

2) Evaluation on Connecting Structure: We evaluate re-
liability of networks with MS (0.3, 0.1) in addition to ﬁve
classes of connecting structures shown in Table I. We show
the average hop length in Fig. 5 with 500 nodes and average
degree 2 for local networks. In this ﬁgure, X-axis shows the
ratio of node failures and Y-axis shows average hop length
normalized by the result of Random structure. We observe
that the structures with dense links in upper layers, such as
Core-periphery structure or Local Team structure, could make
the average hop length to be low. However, when we change
the number of nodes or links in local networks, average hop
length H of Core-periphery structure and Local Team structure
get worse, and sometimes close to that of Random structure.
MS (0.3, 0.1) can keep the average hop length low regardless
of the number of nodes or links used for local networks.
Next, we show the connectivity C in Fig. 6. In this ﬁgure,
X-axis shows the ratio of node failures and Y-axis shows
connectivity C normalized by the result of Random structure.
We can see that MS (0.3, 0.1) or MS (0.5, 0.5) show higher
connectivity than that of other structures.
We also show worst case of connectivity C and average hop
length H in Figs. 7 and 8. The deﬁnition of X-axis and Y-axis
is the same to the deﬁnition of Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 7, we
cannot observe any remarkable differences among results of
each connecting structure. This is because we use BA topology
as local networks. BA topology has degree distribution obeying
a power-law and the topology already has a robustness against
random node failures. However, Fig. 8 shows that MS (0.3,0.1)
can take higher connectivity C than other structures against
failure rate. These results show that MS (0.3,0.1) showed low
average hop length and high connectivity when multiple node
failures occur.

D. Reliability for Disaster Failures
In the previous section, we evaluated reliability against
multiple node failures where a single node failure successively
and randomly occurs one by one. This section evaluates
reliability of inter-connected network against disaster failure.
As opposed to random node failures examined at previous
section, we consider multiple node failures where a selected
node and its neighbor nodes fail simultaneously. For evaluating
the reliability against disaster failure, we consider failures of
largest degree node and its neighbor nodes. This is the worst
case scenario for the disaster failure since the scale of disaster
is largest. Of course, it is possible to occur multiple disasters
at the same time, but the possibility is extremely low, so we
do not evaluate multiple disaster scenario.
We examined various local networks by changing the
parameter for generating BA topology. Figure 9 is the results
when we use 500-node with average degree 2 as the local
network. In this ﬁgure, X-axis represents classes of connecting
structure, and Y-axis represents the average hop length H.
Worst and average of H over 100 patterns of local network is
presented for each class of connecting structure. The results
show that MS (0.3, 0.1) and Local Team structure can keep
the average hop length low for both worst and averaged
results. It is also revealed that Core-periphery structure and
Random Interdivisional structure takes high average hop length
at the worst case. We had the same observation for other
local networks, so omitted results in this paper. We also omit
evaluations of connectivity C since we cannot see remarkable
differences among connecting structures.
Based on these results, we conclude that MS (0.3, 0.1)
structure shows high reliability for multiple node failures and
a disaster failure. That is, high reliability of inter-connected is
achieved by connecting nodes belonged to different hierarchi-
cal level in local network and by connecting nodes around the
core of local network densely.
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we revealed how we should connect two
local networks for achieving high reliability of inter-connected
network. For this purpose, we extend the algorithm in [4] with
re-deﬁnition of distance xij between nodes i and j. We then
examined various classes of connecting structures between two
local networks, and evaluate the connectivity and average hop
length after multiple node failures. The results showed that
high reliability is achieved by MS (0.3, 0.1), which is the
Multiscale structure with λ 0.3 and ζ 0.1. The other structures
sometimes take high reliability, but MS (0.3, 0.1) always takes
high reliability.
In the future work, we will investigate the reliability of
inter-connected network between two ISP topologies other than
BA topologies, and extend the deﬁnition of the probability
P(i, j) to be applied to connect two local network whose
topologies are different from each other.
