Abstract—This paper presents an expert system used for power 
quality monitoring, transferred from power generation sector 
up to power delivery within the Romanian power market. First 
of all, the system allows the analysis of methods and means for 
making all maintenance works within substations, belonging to 
TRANSELECTRICA S.A., the National Company for Power 
Transmission, at high efficiency. Secondly, the system allows 
the high voltage facilities environmental impact assessment. 
Using a fuzzy logic based algorithm, it provides efficient 
measures in order to ensure the environmental parameters’ 
quality, both local and regional. As a case study, a 
representative power substation within the Romanian Power 
System (Brasov Substation) is used. 
Keywords-expert system; fuzzy logic; power quality; monitoring; 
environment;  power market. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Electricity is one of the greatest discoveries of mankind. 
It is now used in almost all areas of activity: agriculture, 
industry, medicine, scientific research etc.  In electricity, 
there are, among others, highly topical issues such as: 
• 
Sustainable use of energy resources; 
• 
Quality of electricity supplied; 
• 
Efficient use of generated electricity; 
• 
Reducing the power facilities environmental impact of. 
The implementation of a remote control and monitoring 
system represents a priority for the Romanian Power Grid 
Transelectrica. To achieve this goal, remote control and moni-
toring centres have been established at each transmission 
branch (Figure 1). Currently the following ones are operating: 
Remote Control and Monitoring Centres in Timisoara and Sibiu. 
Timisoara Transmission Subsidiary is operating across 
four counties: Timis, Arad, Caras-Severin and Hunedoara. 
Timisoara Transmission Subsidiary contains: 
• 
400 kV substations: Arad, Mintia, Nada; 
• 
220 kV substations: Arad, Baru Mare, Calea 
Aradului, Hasdat, Iaz, Mintia, Otelarie, Paroseni, 
Pestis, Resita, Sacalaz, Timisoara. 
Sibiu Transmission Subsidiary is operating across the 
following six counties: Alba, Sibiu, Brasov, Mureş, Harghita 
and Covasna. It contains: 
• 
Brasov, Darste and Iernut 400 kV substation; 
• 
Alba Iulia, Fantanele, Gheorgheni, Ungheni, Iernut 
220 kV substations. 
This paper presents the structure of  an expert system used 
for power quality monitoring, some experimental results (for 
Brasov Substation) and advantages obtained by using the 
expert system. Also the 110 kV, 220 kV and 400 kV power 
facilities environment impact can be studied. 
Using this expert system, optimal upgrading decisions 
have been able to be taken for all power substation. The 
additional transmission network losses, due to perturbations 
affecting the power quality, have been mitigated [1]-[2]. 
II.   EXPERT SYSTEM USED FOR POWER QUALITY AND 
ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS MONITORING 
The system is composed of multiple devices and 
software synthetically presented in Table 1. 
Electric field is determined by measuring the potential 
gradient (electric field intensity) in kV / m, using the 
ICEMENERG gradient meter. It is part of the floating 
potential measuring type apparatus, the detector being 
included within the measuring probe. The measuring probe 
is a plane parallel dipole and is therefore made as a parallel 
plate probes isolated from them according to the IEC 
Standard 833 – “Measurement of the industrial frequency 
electric 
fields”. 
The 
ICEMENERG 
gradient 
meter, 
according to the IEC 61786/1998 Standard is part of the 
single axe sensor measuring instruments, for measuring the 
human body electric field exposure. 
Magnetic field is determined by measuring the maximum 
induction B in mT, for the points established using Tesla 
device monitor. The measuring device is part of the 
magnetic field measurement using a coil probe calibrated in 
a uniform magnetic field created by a solenoid with a 
suitable size to ensure the uniformity of the field. Measuring 
device complies with IEC 61786/1998 – “Measurement of 
electric and magnetic fields regarding the human exposure. 
Special requirements for measuring devices and rules”. 
The power quality analyzer is 7650TM type, considering 
the current regulations and standards [3]-[7].  
The PSTN modem is “U.S. Robotics Courier 56 K 
Business type for dial-up telephone line switchable. 
Selected communication speed is 19200 baud / s. This type 
of modem keeps its settings in case of accidental 
interruption of the supply voltage. 
The data server is an HP personal computer Intel P4, 3 
GHz. Due to large volume of data recorded for processing 
into various statistical forms, capacity is 1024MB RAM, 
120GB SATA HDD. Auxiliary power is provided by UPS. 
Data Server has an LCD monitor 19”, a multi colour print 
A4. Fujitsu Siemens notebook communication with the 
server system is achieved by connecting the external modem 
described above, to the analogue telephone circuit.

Microsoft Windows NT operating system is used. On 
request, the data transmitted by the portable computer are 
automatically saved in a dedicated database. The system 
allows the external archiving of transmitted data on DVD 
RW and also their security. 
The entire database saved on the server can be accessed 
on demand to generate the own primary data processing 
programs, data listing, graphical plots, reports. 
The implementation of the system requires the magnetic 
and electric field measurement within the substations. It is 
followed by the transmission and storage of the 
measurements reports at the central point. 
The environment impact assessment fuzzy based expert 
monitoring system provides the substation human operator 
and the one from the central monitoring point with the 
following important information: 
• 
Electric field intensity value and magnetic induction 
values in case of each working area, within the 
substation territory; 
• 
If the measured values are below or exceed the 
imposed ones by the regulations; 
• 
A solution set for eliminating or limiting the 
disturbing effects, having as a goal human beings’ 
health protection that are working within the 
substation.  
Currently, the environment impact assessment system is 
fully implemented within the Brasov substation. Due to the 
advantages obtained using this expert monitoring system, its 
implementation for all the Transelectrica’s substations is 
going to be realized.

The fuzzy logic based algorithm for evaluating the 
environment impact parameters within the substations is in 
patent phase. More details regarding this algorithm are 
going to be offered ion the future, once the patent phase is 
finished. 
Experimental results from each point of measurement 
will be presented:  
• 
Schedule normal operation of the substation for 
electricity conversion; 
• 
Location point for measuring the delimitation of the 
area dotted element network; 
• 
Continuity in the supply measurement point; 
• 
Maintain the analyzer PQ mounted at the 
measurement point; 
• 
Graphical representation of weekly analysis of the 
PQ indicators; 
• 
Representation of numerical analysis for the annual 
PQ indicators; 
• 
Nonframing indicators analysis within the limits 
allowed by their reflection in the real and reactive 
load curves; 
• 
Reports measuring the electric field and magnetic, 
containing the following data: the test, test name, 
date of test, technical prescriptions, test results in 
table; 
• 
Classification analysis / nonframings the values 
measured in the admissible limits. 
The real and reactive energy is flowing in both 
directions through the measurement point being recorded by 
the PQ analyzer, but also by the metering system. This 
meter has been installed by the electric energy remote-
metering within the wholesale market, providing a superior 
accuracy measurement PQ analyzer. The data recorded by 
the remote-metering of the electric energy within the 
wholesale market have been used in the following analysis. 
It has been developed a software dedicated for this analysis 
and it was represented the monthly real and reactive power 
evolution. Excel application is used to represent load curves 
(Figure 5), containing an area that allows the selection of 
alphanumeric interval analyzed. It also contains a graphical 
area plotting the time evolution of energy through the 
network. The user is requested to select the month from the 
list of options, which will be represented in the chart at the 
top, power flow evolution. A set of buttons is available for 
detailed analyses that allow the change of the interest area 
(green rectangle in the chart above), representing it within 
the chart at the bottom. This is the effect of the “magnifying 
glass” that allows the simultaneous observation of the 
development of both monthly and the interest area. 
Starting from the in-depth analyses of the recorded 
events, the effective causes that are leading to power quality 
indicators mitigation have to be determined. Also, this 
analysis has to be correlated with the operation data from 
the substations and electric networks including the ones 
archived in SCADA systems. The power quality indicators’ 
admissible limits’ overpass analysis has been performed 
only within the Brasov substation measuring point. This 
case study has been chosen due to the fact that the supplied 
voltage magnitude had a spectacular evolution.  
3.   EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
Several experimental determinations have been performed 
within the following locations: 
• 
Timisoara 
Transmission 
Subsidiary 
(400

Figure 5.  T1 transformer 110 kV Brasov Substation load curves 
 
According to this figure the phase L1, L2, L3 supplied 
voltage magnitude and the long period flicker level Plt have not 
fitted between the admissible limits. The T1 transformer (type 
TTUS-FS 400 kV ± 8*12.5 % / 121 kV) is provided with the 
possibility of primary circuit voltage control by the under-load 
tap changer type T-III-1000, made by Reinheisen. It has been 
set on 8 position within the 25.02-21.04.2006 period and on 7 
position between 21.04-30.12.2006. The tap changing is also 
highlighted by the supplied voltage magnitude rapid variation 
and also by the reactive energy before and after the 
commutation. 
Starting with 2006 year, an upgrading process, for all the 
voltage levels, has been started within the substation. 
Obviously, the upgrading process is based on the recorded 
values. Several economical advantages have been obtained (the 
accidental events’ number has been reduced, also the operation 
expenses). 
CENELEC - Project ENV European standard 50166-1, 
Human exposure to low frequency electromagnetic fields (0 - 
10 kHz) and the General rules of safety set by the Ministry of 
Labor and Social Protection and the Ministry of Health in 
Romania provide that the maximum permissible intensity of 
the electric field E = 10 kV / m for a time of 8 hours a day. In 
the conditions under which staff are exposed to E > 10 kV / m 
is recommended reducing the waiting time in the electric field 
using the formula t = 80 / E, where t is time in hours. 
The E [kV / m] electric field measurement results, within 
the 400 kV Brasov substation, are synthesized within Table 5 
(only few of the measured values are highlighted). 
Measurements in 148 points have been performed. In 92 points 
values greater the 10 kV / m have been found. In these areas 
with E > 10 kV / m necessary measures to protect staff in 
accordance with international and domestic rules. To protect 
human beings’ health within the Brasov substation, the 
installation of several protection screens has been 
performed. Their role is to reduce the electric field intensity 
values in case of the main working areas. Also, have 
reduced work-time for the intense electric field areas.

Romania in Romania provide that the maximum allowable 
induction of the magnetic field B = 0.5 mT on exchange of 
work (for 8 hours daily). In the conditions under which staff are 
exposed to B = 5 mT duration of exposure will be less than 2 
hours on the exchange work. 
The B [mT] magnetic field measurement results, within the 
400 kV Brasov substation, are synthesized within Table 6 (only 
few of the measured values are highlighted). All values 
measured induction B are much lower than the maximum 
allowable B = 0.5 mT and therefore are not necessary measures 
to protect personnel action against the magnetic field.

4.   CONCLUSIONS 
For all the measuring points, the supplied voltage 
magnitude UR, US, UT, overpasses the imposed limits 99-
121 kV, stipulated within the Electrical Transmission 
Network Technical Code [10]. The upper limit has been 
exceeded for a 95 % period of the week. The revision of the 
Electrical Transmission Network Technical Code has been 
proposed 
considering 
the 
technical 
equipment 
characteristics 
installed 
within 
110 
kV 
electrical 
installations and the experience achieved. The upper limit 
voltage magnitude variation from 121 kV to 123 kV has 
been proposed. 
For a 95 % of the analyzed period, long term flicker has 
not been framed within the limits imposed by the IEC 
61000-4-15:2003 [11]. 
The feasibility study conducted for this expert system 
stresses that its implementation will ensure rapid access to 
information needed FOR all the responsible factors. It is 
necessary to establish concrete measures designed for 
reducing electromagnetic disturbances and to diminish the 
following effects: 
• 
Further losses’ reduction within power transmission 
networks and consumers, mainly by reducing the 
level of harmonics, voltage unbalances and current; 
• 
Proper equipment operation, for those cases when 
their functions and performance are affected by the 
harmonics’ presence and voltage unbalances and / 
or current; 
• 
Reducing the operation expenses for the equipment 
preventive or corrective maintenance, for those 
cases when they are affected by disturbances that 
damage the power quality; 
• 
Increasing the efficiency of the generating units, 
processing 
units, 
lines 
and 
electric 
motors 
(including the ones for the substations’ ancillary 
services) etc.; 
• 
Reducing the costs of power generation / power 
transmission 
and, 
in 
general, 
reducing 
the 
investment within the National Power System. It 
would result from the need of over sizing the 
network 
elements 
to 
cover 
the 
effects 
of 
electromagnetic disturbance with offences against 
limits; 
• 
Reducing the damages to consumers caused by 
voltage (the violation of the rated value, voltage 
gaps and short term interruptions); 
• 
Establishment of concrete protecting measures to 
protect the operating personnel from 110 kV, 220 
kV and 400 kV installations against the electric and 
magnetic fields, based on the literature study. 
Using this expert system, optimal upgrading decisions 
have been able to be taken for Brasov substation. The

additional transmission network losses, due to perturbations 
affecting the power quality, have been mitigated.  
Currently, a profitability index Pi = 2.8 has been 
obtained. It represents the ratio between the sum of the 
yearly updated benefits and the sum of the yearly updated 
expenses, along the considered study period. Consequently, 
the system implementation had an important advantage 
compared to other systems describer within the literature 
[12]-[14].
