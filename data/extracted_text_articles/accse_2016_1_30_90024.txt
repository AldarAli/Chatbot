Abstract—This 
paper 
proposes 
an 
in-vehicle 
interface 
assessment framework for emerging technologies. The 
framework was validated through a driving simulator based 
case study with an emerging user interface design. The result 
suggested that it was useful to evaluate the effectiveness of the 
emerging technology based user interface designs.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
With advancing technology, drivers are more likely to 
engage in non-driving related tasks. Auto industries are 
attempting to develop new user interaction designs, such as 
voice and gesture command to reduce drivers’ distraction [1]. 
However, it is important to determine if new concept of 
driver-vehicle interaction design is indeed effective. 
Recent research suggested a usability evaluation toolkit 
for In-Vehicle Information Systems (IVISs) [2]. The toolkit 
comprises definition of usability criteria, selection of 
evaluation methods, desktop methods, and experimental 
methods. However, detailed information of the experimental 
methods was limited. 
This paper aims to suggest and validate an in-vehicle 
interface assessment framework based on experimental 
methods. 
II. 
IN-VEHICLE INTERFACE ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK 
A proposed assessment framework is illustrated in Figure 
1. The framework begins with definition of usability criteria, 
which definition had to be context specific. Then usability 
criteria are used to guide the selection of methods which are 
most appropriate for evaluating usability. In the experimental 
methods phase, objective and subjective evaluations should 
be repeated until the usability criteria are met. 
III. 
CASE STUDY 
A. Study Overview 
A quantitative assessment framework was developed to 
understand the effectiveness of an emerging user interaction 
device on distraction. A comparative analysis between new 
user interface (NUI) and touch screen (TS) was conducted. 
B. Definition of Usability Criteria 
The usability criteria of new in-vehicle interface was 
defined by identifying input/output modalities and the 
context of use as shown in Table I and Table II.   
C. Selection of Evaluation Methods 
Objective and subjective methods were selected to 
evaluate actual performance levels and users’ opinions as 
shown in Table III. Two subjective methods, i.e., the System 
Usability Scale (SUS) [3] and the Driving Activity Load 
Index (DALI) [4], were selected. The driving performance 
(primary task), secondary task and eye behavior were 
selected as the objective measures. 
D. Experimental Setup 
The simulator experiment was conducted in a fixed-based 
driving simulator. A gaze tracker was mounted on a dash 
board to collect eye behavior data. A touch pad for new input 
method were placed beside a gear lever.

E. Experimental Procedure 
Twenty four participants, consisted of 12 driving group 
(Driving & Survey) and 12 non-driving group (Survey only), 
were recruited. Following informed consent and completion 
of a questionnaire, participants received 10 minutes of 
adaptation time in the simulator. Then, participants were 
trained in the NUI and TS operation. When the simulation 
was resumed, participants drove on a highway for about 20 
minutes twice to perform either the NUI or the TS task. The 
tasks consisted of destination entry, MP3 play, emergency 
mode, and mute function. 
F. Results 
As shown in Figure 2, overall SUS results showed that 
the NUI score (65.7) was 6.7 percent higher than the TS 
score (61.1). Especially, the driving and survey group have 
rated significantly higher than the survey only group 
(p=0.023). Among the six items in DALI, five items of the 
NUI, including global attention demand, visual demand, 
stress, 
temporal 
demand, 
and 
interference, 
showed 
significantly lower workload than the touch screen (see 
Table IV). 
For the objective methods, eye movement and driving 
performance changes are summarized in Table V. In general, 
the NUI showed higher performance and safer behavior than 
the touch screen.

CONCLUSION 
This study proposed an in-vehicle interface assessment 
framework for emerging technologies which have not been 
used in automotive user interaction design. The results of the 
case study have shown that the proposed framework have 
suitable levels of validity. It was also demonstrated that the 
experimental methods using a driving simulator were useful 
to evaluate the effectiveness of the emerging technology 
based user interface designs which are hard to imagine their 
use cases in a driving context.
