Abstract—Currently, web services are the preferred technology 
for implementation of distributed applications that follow a 
Service-Oriented Architecture. The promise of reduced cost 
and time for enabling a large range of company-wide business 
processes shifts the research focus towards reasoning about 
web service selection. This paper proposes an approach 
facilitating clients to select a web service among several ones 
with the same functionality based on their quality of service 
(QoS) properties. It provides a mechanism for integrated QoS 
assessment of web services taking into account all measured 
QoS properties of the client’s interest. The method estimates 
the strength of the mutual dependency of the QoS properties 
using a data set analysis of QoS values accumulated during the 
web service invocation. The approach is summarized in a step-
by-step assessment procedure and is proved through a real 
web service selection scenario. 
Keywords-Web services; Quality of service; Web service 
selection; Theory of fuzzy sets; Probability theory. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Nowadays, the Service-Oriented Architecture is the most 
commonly used paradigm for development of distributed 
software systems, especially in the context of cloud 
computing. Since the web services are one of the 
fundamental technologies used in the cloud, the problems 
related to their quality remain of primary importance. Thus, 
many research efforts are still focused on the development of 
new approaches for quality of service (QoS) assessment. 
A. Problem formulation 
The web service selection is a challenging problem 
especially when different web services provide equal 
functionality [8]. The clients aim to use the web services 
having the best quality, but the selection procedure meets 
several difficulties as follows: 
 
The behavior of the web services with respect to 
QoS is difficult to be predicted. It depends on 
various factors such as availability of the network 
connection or corresponding application server, the 
number of simultaneous invocations and so on. 
 
The client's choice is a result of subjectivity of its 
own understanding about the desired quality of the 
offered resources [12]. 
 
The web service quality is affected simultaneously 
by different QoS properties that often are 
inconsistent. For example, increasing the availability 
of a given web service leads to increasing of its cost, 
which is not reasonable for the clients with limited 
budget. 
B. Current State of the Art 
The recently introduced concept of web service quality 
estimation is based on the probability of the measured 
quality data and fuzzy sets (FSs) to account for the client 
preferences [1], [2], [3]. In [15] a web service selection 
approach based on the weight of client’s satisfaction from 
QoS properties is proposed. Its main drawback is the 
inability to ensure that the service recommending algorithm 
is open, fair and trustworthy. Also, only measurable QoS 
properties are considered. In contrast, a web service selection 
mechanism proposed in [16] deals with all types of QoS 
properties expressing those that are not measurable in terms 
of integer values. The QoS-based selection model described 
in [17], [18] determines the overall web service quality from 
a weighted sum of the normalized values of QoS properties. 
A drawback of the model is that it considers only measurable 
QoS properties that can be directly monitored. Also, the 
normalization of the values of QoS properties in the interval 
of [0,1] leads to losing valuable information. The QoS-aware 
selection method proposed in [19] performs credibility 
evaluation of QoS properties that are classified in two 
categories, i.e. negotiable and nonnegotiable. The values of 
nonnegotiable QoS properties are obtained from historical 
records of web service execution and cannot be modified by 
the provider. The negotiable QoS properties can be changed 
according to the client’s requirements. The web service 
selection algorithm presented in [20] is based on quantitative 
QoS prediction method applied to a dynamic environment. In 
[21] a collaborative filtering based approach is designed. It 
predicts QoS of unused web services taking into account the 
similarity in clients experiences. Such similarity is 
considered also in the service selecting model proposed in 
[22]. 
The disadvantages of the approaches presented above can 
be summarized as follows: 
 
 
Applicability to only measurable QoS properties. 
Most of the approaches do not take into account 
unmeasurable QoS properties. 
 
Subjectivity of the performed QoS estimation. 
Some approaches are based on the ratings that are 
specified by clients after web service consumption.

Others use values of QoS properties that are claimed 
by the web service providers. 
 
Applicability to single QoS property. A significant 
number of the proposed approaches can be applied 
in cases when clients are interested in one QoS 
property in particular. In practice, the web service 
selection procedure requires consideration of several 
QoS characteristics.  
C. Research Objectives 
In our previous work [6] we propose an algorithm that 
enables to compare the quality of several web services with 
equal functionality according to a single nonfunctional 
characteristic. It was implemented in a software tool for 
automated web service selection [14]. However, real practice 
shows that the service selection usually needs to account for 
more than one QoS property. An easily applied new method 
that calculates the level of satisfaction of several jointly 
estimated quality properties of a particular web service gives 
a theoretical frame able to assess the strength of the chosen 
nonfunctional characteristics of a web service [13]. 
The web service selection approach introduced in this 
paper is based on the assessed strength of the multiple QoS 
properties. It calculates the level of satisfaction of several 
jointly estimated QoS properties for each interested web 
service using the data collected during the web service 
invocation. The approach compares the obtained strength 
level in order to advise the client on the web service with the 
best quality. It is summarized in an easily implementable 
algorithm that is proven through a real web service selection 
scenario. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II 
presents the proposed approach for integrated QoS 
assessment. Section III describes a case study of web service 
selection as a proof of concept. Section IV concludes the 
paper and gives directions for future work. 
II. 
INTEGRATED QOS ESTIMATED METHOD 
This section presents a new approach for QoS-enabled 
selection of web services. First, a theoretical background of 
the approach is introduced. Next, an integrated QoS 
assessment for web services is proposed. Finally, a step-by-
step procedure for QoS-enabled selection of web services is 
described. 
A. Theoretical background 
The QoS properties of web services could be divided into 
groups, namely measurable and unmeasurable [10]. The QoS 
properties such as response time, availability and throughput 
are measurable, since they have numerical values. The 
unmeasurable QoS properties such as standard compliance, 
authentication method and data encryption cannot be directly 
measured in terms of numeric values. In contrast, the values 
of a given measurable QoS property could be easily obtained 
through monitoring of the web service behavior during 
operation invocation. They can be treated as values of a 
random discrete variable known as Probability Mass 
Function (PMF) [4]. If x is any possible value of a discrete 
random variable X, the PMF value of x, denoted by p(x), is 
the probability of the event {X=x} consisting of all outcomes 
that give rise to the value of X equal to x: 
 
p(x) = P({X=x}). 
(1) 
The PMF is appropriate for QoS assessment of the web 
services regarding a single QoS property [11]. Unfortunately, 
it cannot be applied to the unmeasurable QoS properties. For 
instance, the QoS metrics that reflect the subjectively 
experienced quality as usability, efficiency, etc., are in fact 
the acceptable cumulative effect on client satisfaction of all 
imperfections affecting the web service [5]. These qualities 
could be only empirically assessed according to the 
subjectivity of the client’s perception sensed during the web 
service usage. Usually, such assessment is not exactly 
defined as it implies some uncertainty. This type of 
uncertainty can be formalized using a powerful mathematical 
tool of the theory of fuzzy sets [7].  
The concept of fuzzy set allows partial set membership 
rather than a crisp set membership. The level of belonging is 
formulated by a membership function, which numerically 
represents the degree to which a given element belongs to a 
fuzzy set. Formally, a fuzzy set is defined as follows: a fuzzy 
set A defined in a universe U is a set of ordered pairs, A = 
{(x, µA(x)), xU, µA(x)[0,1]}, where µA(x) is the degree of 
membership of the element x in A. Thus, the membership 
function is seen as a mapping µA(.): x [0,1]. As µA(x) 
approaches 1, the element x increasingly belongs to the fuzzy 
set A. Commonly, the shape of the membership function is 
identified as a standard function of triangular, trapezoidal, 
Gaussian or other type. Usually, it is determined by expert 
knowledge. 
However, 
there 
are 
different 
practical 
applications, which successfully apply techniques of 
exploratory 
data 
analysis 
for 
membership 
function 
identification. In such a case, µ(.) covers the intrinsic process 
uncertainty that leads to impossibility to find an accurate 
process description [7].  Since the information for a given 
QoS property is collected in a data set of measured values 
then a discrete membership function is applicable to the web 
service assessment problem. It is interpretable in the sense of 
probability distribution obtained by (1) [6]. 
Usually, several quality properties are significant for the 
web 
service 
selection 
problem. 
Often 
they 
have 
contradictory effect on the whole service behavior. By 
improving the quality of one nonfunctional characteristic the 
quality in the sense of another could decrease. For instance, 
when web service reliability and safety are increased, its 
response time could be worsted. Therefore, the joint 
assessment of several quality properties is essential for the 
QoS-enabled web service selection. 
B. Integrated QoS estimation 
Let us consider that we have m different web services Sj  
j = 1,…,m presenting the same functionality. Let us also 
assume that we have n number of quality properties xi that 
determine the QoS properties according to which the web 
services have to be compared. If each quality property value 
is presented as a fuzzy set Qj
i, j = 1,…, m, i = 1,…,n as it 
discussed above, its membership function µQ
j
i(xi) could be 
115

represented as PMF according to (1). In such a case, the joint 
relation of all interested web service QoS properties could be 
estimated via Cartesian product calculation [13]. The 
Cartesian product of the fuzzy sets Qj
i defines a new fuzzy 
set Qj of the cross product for the j-th service: 
 
Qj = Qj
1× Qj
2× … × Qj
n

The FS Qj is a set of all pairs that consists of a tuple of 
QoS properties’ values xj = (xj
1, …, xj
n) and its membership 
degree µQ
j(xj). That membership degree represents the 
strength of the relationship of the QoS values of the 
respective tuple xj. It is calculated as a minimum of the 
membership degrees of the constituent membership degree 
values:

The degree values obtained in (3) could serve as a QoS 
assessment and a web service comparison analysis. From a 
practical point of view, the larger membership degree shows 
more strength of the QoS. By maximizing the strength, we 
are able to select a web service, which provides maximal 
quality. For the QoS properties, whose values have to be 
minimized in the assessment procedure, the negation of the 
membership degree:

C. Integrated QoS selection method 
The theoretical statements presented above can be 
summarized in a procedure that provides an integrated QoS 
web services assessment. Let us assume that for a given web 
service, a number of n QoS properties xi, i=1,…,n are of a 
particular interest. Let the candidate web services, namely 
those that satisfy functional requirements of the client, form 
the set S, where S={S1, S2, …, Sj… Sm}, j=1,…,m. 
The steps of the proposed approach for integrated QoS 
assessment are as follows: 
Step 1: Accumulate data for all interested QoS properties 
within a chosen time window. 
Step 2: Represent each property of each service as a 
fuzzy set Qj
i, j=1,…,m, i=1,…,n corresponding to a 
membership function µQ
j
i(xj
i). 
Step 2 requires calculation of the PMF for each QoS 
property. In case of available data about the incidence of the 
QoS values it is processed according to (1) in order to obtain 
the probability and further, interpret the probabilities values 
as fuzzy membership degrees. For the properties whose 
values have to be minimized in the assessment procedure, 
the negation of the membership degree is performed 
according to (4).     
Step 3: Estimate the Cartesian product of the fuzzy sets 
Qj
i, j=1,…,m, i=1,…,n for each web service according to (2) 
and (3). 
Step 4 Apply (5) to select the highest strength that finds 
the best web service regarding the quality for the considered 
time window. 
III. 
METHOD VALIDATION 
The feasibility of the proposed QoS-enabled approach for 
web service selection is proved by a sample case study. It 
covers four web services providing the same functionality of 
email validation. The web services are compared according 
to three QoS properties. They are throughput (TP), response 
time (RT) and number of completed requests (CR). The 
dataset with QoS values is obtained through load testing of 
the web services using the LoadUI tool [9]. The TP gives the 
data transfer rate and is typically measured in bytes per 
second. The RT gives the time in milliseconds taken to send 
a request and to receive a response from the web service. The 
CR provides information about the number of successful 
processed requests by the web service. Each web service 
receives 10 requests per second during test case execution. 
The total number of requests is 1220 and the test case 
execution time is approximately 20 minutes. This time 
interval is enough for QoS estimation of the chosen QoS 
properties, since the behavior of the web services for a 
longer period of time become repeatable and does not affect 
the proposed method for QoS estimation. The minimal 
(RTmin, TPmin, CRmin) and maximal values (RTmax, 
TPmax, CRmax) of the QoS properties as well as their 
maximum of the respective probability max(P) for all four 
web services are presented in Table I, Table II and Table III.

The PMFs calculated for the RT are graphically 
presented in Figure 1. The maximum of PMFs for all web 
services is obtained for RT lower than 400 milliseconds. The 
“cdyne” web service has a big diversity of singly measured 
values of RT. Its RT varies in a large time interval (see the 
minimum and maximum value in Table I), but most often is 
not higher than 200 milliseconds. The X-axis values of the 
Figure 1 are limited to 2000 and by that increasing the 
readability and showing better the RT values that are most 
frequently obtained during web services testing.

The obtained dataset is used for integrated assessment of 
the web services’ quality. Note that the web services clients 
expect as higher values as possible for TP and CR. In 
contrast, regarding the RT the quality is higher when its 
values are smaller. That is why the PMF of RT is not directly 
used in calculation procedure, since it needs to be negated 
according to (4) to obtain the membership degrees of the 
corresponding fuzzy set QRT. The PMF of TP and CR are 
treated as fuzzy sets QTP and QCR having the membership 
degrees that are used directly in the assessment algorithm.

The Cartesian product Q = QTP × QRT × QCR of the fuzzy 
sets related to the QoS properties of interest is calculated 
according to (2) and (3). The results from the QoS estimation 
are shown in Table IV. As it was underlined, the 
membership grade defines the strength of the relationship 
between the values of QoS properties for each triple. The 
highest value of 0,8885 is obtained for  “postcodeanywhere” 
web service. It provides the highest quality and is 
recommended to the client as the best web service for email 
validation.

CONCLUSION 
The proposed approach provides a procedure that 
assesses the strength of several QoS properties of different

web services with equal functionality. It is based on a solid 
theoretical frame for joint assessment of the QoS properties 
of interest. The approach calculates the level of satisfaction 
of the QoS properties using the fuzzy sets description and 
their cross product in order to find the strength of the 
relationship between the QoS properties. This is proved 
through a real web service selection scenario.  
Since the proposed approach is based on data obtained 
through monitoring, it could be realized in a fully automated 
manner. Further, it uses a theoretical basis that enables to be 
considered not only measured but also unmeasured QoS 
properties. The future work includes comparison of the 
proposed method with other approaches in case of equal web 
service scenarios and to evaluate the method’s effectiveness 
with larger QoS datasets.
