Abstract—This paper presents our study's result on the
influence of personal factors on the design or use of products
and systems in dealing with safety risks. It explores the impact
of
individual
preferences
on
professional
choices.
The
conducted interview results and collected responses show that
personal
preferences
influence
professional
decisions
for
managing safety through design or operation.

INTRODUCTION
Safety is the state of freedom from harm for humans,
properties, and the environment, according to [1]. Safety
overlaps with security. Safety and security are mainly about
people, and humans have the most considerable influence on
them. Humans, or people, have different values and interests.
They sometimes share their interests and sometimes compete
with
each
other.
Also,
people
may
use
products
in
unintended ways or even misuse products. The human
factors and safety culture are well-established in design,
integration, and technical systems operation; see for example
[2][3]. Although human factors for the users have been well-
studied through literature [4], human factors may also
influence
designers
themselves.
In
other
words,
the
personality of designers (or their characteristics) may affect
their design. That is a topic that requires attention because it
can influence the use. This paper focuses on personal styles
and their influences on both design and service.
Dealing with personal factors has been discussed in the
literature. Among others, Katcher et al. define four different
orientations that influence a person's value, interest, and
behaviour [5]. This study adopts Katcher et al. because they
focus on humans' strength to determine their behavioural
styles. They define four main orientations to describe an
individual style. They assume that each person has elements
of all four directions in his or her behaviour. Those four
orientations or categories are
Supporting-Giving
(SG),
Controlling-Taking (CT), Conserving-Holding (CH), and
Adapting-Dealing (AD) [5].
Studies show that human behaviour is also under the
influence of the context. Katcher et al. describe two
particular contexts stated as favourable and unfavourable [5].
They argue that personal behaviour – or the so-called
personal style – is the combination of the four orientations
and the context's influence.

HUMANS SYSTEM INTERACTIONS
For studying the role of humans in connection with a
product or system, we first look into the product/system life
cycle. The entire product life cycle includes three different
phases: functional, technical and operational, according to
[6], as shown in Figure 1.
The role of humans in each one of those phases is
explained next.
A.
Humans in dealing with functional aspects
Functional aspects refer to the life cycle stage which
results in functions and specifications for a system or product
[6]. Safety is a market must and dictated through regulations.
However, pushing safety through a prescriptive approach is
most of the time giving its place to reaching goals and
motivations. In addition to the safety-related requirements,
personal, social, or political interests may compete or
conflict. Those needs – which might be unspoken – may
substantially influence a specific design's success or failure.

operational phases, adapted from [6].

B.
Humans in dealing with technical aspects
Technical aspects refer to the life cycle stage which
results in technical design, production, and installation for a
system or product [6]. This phase is under the direct
influence of designers. Designers are also humans and have
their values, styles, and interest which may influence their
design practices.
C.
Humans in dealing with operational aspects
Operational aspects refer to the life cycle stage which
results in operation, maintenance, and retirement for a
system or product [6].
Managing risks and opportunities for occupational health
and safety is a significant task for the safe operation of
products and systems. The commitment of top management,
sound
policies
and
communication,
consultation
and
participation of workers, and effective processes are critical
success
factors
[7].
Therefore,
proper
commitment,
communication, and culture are indispensable elements of
safe and successful operation.
III.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Designers and users are the two stakeholders who
influence product safety at most, according to [6, 8].
Designers are dominantly present in the functional and
technical phases, and users (or operators) directly affect the
operational phase. This study's primary question is: "do the
personal factors influence the design or use style?". In this
context, the personal, design, and use styles have been
defined as follows:

Personal style refers to the combination of the
orientations that characterises a persons' behaviour

Design style refers to the combination of the
orientations that characterise a designer's choices in
the course of design

Use
style
refers
to
the
combination
of
the
orientations that characterise a user's choices in the
course of the use
In other words, the hypothesis is that the design or use
styles are under the influence of personal orientations. This
assumption leads to two important conclusions. It implies
that design style may be under the influence of the designer's
personality. It also means that the use style may be under the
influence of individual users.

RESEARCH METHODS
A.
Literature domains
This study assumes that people have different styles and
uses four categories of personality types based on the method
developed by Katcher et al. [5]. Those four categories are
SG, CT, CH, and AD. The literature for this research mainly
covers the domains of human behaviour [5][7], safety
engineering [1][9], and design [6][8].
B.
Interviews
In addition to the literature review, this research's
primary hypothesis was reviewed by different experts in
human
psychology,
system
safety,
and
professional
designers.
Interviews
were
conducted
through
an
unstructured approach. Based on the literature review and the
collected feedback, a questionnaire was designed to find the
possible correlation between personal and professional
styles.
C.
Questionnaire
A questionnaire was designed to cover multiple topics
and to identify personal styles, design style, and the
responders' use style. The questions were multiple choice
and had no right or wrong answers. In other words, all the
answers were correct and of an equal level of importance.
They were designed to force the responder to prioritise the
given choices. In this way, the responder is likely to
prioritise those answers that resonate with his/her personal
preferences. A summary of the questions is provided in

Workshop
The responders were asked to participate in a workshop.
The responders were assigned to different groups. The same
use scenario was given to all the groups, and they were asked
to sketch the response of the users/ designers based on
various personal orientations. Based on the author's review,
the outcomes showed that the reactions were converging to
specific patterns.
V.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In
total,
ten
professional
designers
completed
the
questionnaire successfully. In general, the responders found
the questions relevant and exciting. However, they also often
experienced a dilemma to choose the most favourable
answer. The results are presented in Figure 2. In this figure,
the axes show relevant scores per each orientation, and each
colour represents a response. There are two types of markers
in the graph. The circles present the design orientations, and
the triangles present the use orientations. In general, the
figure shows a Pearson correlation between personal, design,
and use orientations.
Table 2 shows the Pearson correlation coefficients
between personal style and design style and between
personal style and use style. In both cases, more than 50% of
answers represented a correlation above 50%.
The results present a correlation between personal
preferences and design or use choices. The results confirm
that a designer with the supporting orientation intends to help
and support others in the best possible way considering that
all human lives are of equal worth. For the conserving
direction, the designer wants to focus on quick solutions and
the users' responsibility. A designer with a conserving
orientation is likely to focus on details, follow instructions,

and use logical arguments for managing risks. A designer
with an adaptive orientation is likely to focus mainly on the
reactions of users, stakeholders, or other team members
aiming to avoid conflicts.

CONCLUSIONS
This paper's main conclusion is that personal factors
(preferences, values, and styles) influence professional
choices for designers, operators, and
users. It seems
necessary to point designers' attention to their unique styles
and make them aware of their strengths and points for extra
attention. Moreover, this awareness can help to design
products and system in a way that will satisfy a variety of
users with different styles. In other words, designers need to
aim to design products and systems in such a way that the
operation in both normal and extreme modes of operation
covers a wide range of personal styles.
The next step for this study will be reviewing and
comparing
the
final
products
delivered
by
different
designers.
