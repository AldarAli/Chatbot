Abstract—Ultra Wideband (UWB) system is overlapped with
various wireless systems, such as WLAN, WiMax and UMTS,
which limits the use of UWB. Cognitive Radio (CR) enables
UWB systems to efﬁciently use the overlapped spectrum with-
out causing interference to other wireless systems. In this paper,
we focuses on the low-complexity joint optimization algorithm
design with respect to transmit power allocation and spectrum
sensing time (SST) for maximizing the spectrum efﬁciency of
the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing based CR-
UWB system. The SST optimization algorithm minimizes the
spectrum sensing time in order to maximize the time length of
applying the power allocation algorithm for data transmission.
The proposed group power allocation algorithm adaptively
assigns the transmit power to the subcarrier groups according
to the effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of each subcarrier
group based on greedy algorithm. The proposed joint optimiza-
tion algorithm can maximize the CR-UWB systems spectrum
efﬁciency at a extremely low primary user SNR regime with
low complexity.

I. INTRODUCTION
The 3.1-10.6 GHz Ultra Wideband (UWB) operat-
ing spectrum overlaps with narrowband systems, such as
WiMAX, UMTS and 802.11a/n [1]. To protect the in-
cumbent wireless systems from being interfered by UWB
systems, the emission Power Spectral Density (PSD) of
a UWB system is strictly constrained by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) regulations (≤ -41.3
dBm/MHz) [2]. With such a limitation, the UWB systems
cannot provide the required Quality of Service (QoS) if
the aggregate interference from the Primary Users (PUs) is
high [3]. Furthermore, a UWB system can cause intolerable
interference to PUs if the transmit (Tx) power of the UWB
system rises within the overlapped spectrum. The spectrum
efﬁciency is low because the overlapped spectrum is far from
being fully utilized by the PUs [4].
Cognitive Radio (CR) technology [5] enables an Or-
thogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based
UWB system to efﬁciently use the overlapped spectrum
by operating within the spectrum according to the CR-
UWB system’s spectrum sensing results. According to the
Multiband OFDM (MB-OFDM) UWB system’s protocol,
the time length for a CR-UWB system’s data transmission
is limited [6]. Thus, the Spectrum Sensing Time (SST)
determines the effective data transmission period in the over-
lapped spectrum. In the data transmission period, the power
allocation algorithm determines the CR-UWB’s spectrum
efﬁciency. Thus, the power allocation scheme is coupled
with the spectrum sensing time scheduling. To use the spec-
trum as efﬁcient as possible, joint optimization algorithm
design that considers the power allocation and sensing time
simultaneously is needed.
For spectrum efﬁciency maximization, the joint optimiza-
tion problem is generally nonconvex for nonlinearity of
the formulated objective and constraint functions. Thus, the
power allocation and sensing time are optimized sequen-
tially to obtain an optimal solution in polynomial time.
For capacity-based optimization, the optimal power can be
derived as a function of a given sensing time by using convex
optimization methods (the joint optimization problem can be
transformed into a convex problem with respect to the CR
system’s transmit power), such as water-ﬁlling method [7],
subgradient method [8], ellipsoid method [9] and Newton’s
method [10]. Then, one-dimensional exhaustive search or
bisection search method is commonly used to obtain the op-
timal sensing time since it is NP-hard to derive an analytical
form. Using convex optimization method to solve the power
allocation problem requires relaxation of constraints, which
will cause the optimization algorithm cannot be implemented
in practical CR-UWB systems. For example, water-ﬁlling
method assumes the number of bits allocated on a frequency
band is non-integer. Furthermore, the convex optimization
algorithm often converges slowly near to the optimum and
needs a large number of iterations to reach the desired
accuracy [7]. For sensing time optimization, the complexity
of the exhaustive search can be high, especially in multiuser
CR networks, since the subsets of users is exponentially
increasing with the number of users. To design a low-
complexity algorithm for more practical spectrum efﬁciency
optimization, the joint optimization problem can be formed
as a knapsack problem with respect to the power allocation
[11]–[13]. In [11], Zhang and Leung applied the greedy
algorithm by allocating a bit to the subcarrier which has
the maximum efﬁciency value in each iteration until one

of the constraints is violated. Since there are multiple PUs
near the signal cognitive OFDM system, there are multiple
interference related efﬁciency values in each subcarrier.
Hence, in a subcarrier, the minimum interference efﬁciency
value is chosen to be compared with other subcarriers’ min-
imum interference efﬁciency values. Choosing the minimum
interference efﬁciency value is to guarantee the PU with the
minimum interference margin will not be interfered. The
complexity of the optimization algorithm is proportional to
the number of source bits, the number of subcarriers and the
number of the PUs. In [12], Koufos et al. formulated a mul-
tiple choice knapsack problem with respect to the sensing
power and power allocation optimization. The authors used a
greedy-based optimization algorithm to achieve the optimal
tradeoff between the expected throughput over the multiple
spectrum bands and the total power spent for sensing. In
this paper, we formulate the joint optimization problem
into a multi-dimensional knapsack problem with respect to
power allocation and develop a suboptimal greedy algorithm
that signiﬁcantly reduces the complexity of maximizing the
CR-UWB system’s spectrum efﬁciency. For sensing time
optimization, we derive a quasi-analytical solution for the
optimal sensing time, which enables the joint optimization
algorithm to quickly compute the value of the optimal
sensing time.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section
II discusses the spectrum sensing model and the trans-
mit power limitation of the CR-UWB system. Next, the
spectrum efﬁciency maximization problem is formulated in
Section III. The joint optimization algorithm with respect
to group power allocation and quasi-analytical sensing time
optimization algorithm is discussed in Section IV. Then,
simulation results are presented in Section V to compare
the spectrum efﬁciency enhancement contributed by the
use of the proposed joint optimization algorithm. Finally,
conclusion is given in Section VI.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
We assume that the overlay spectrum sharing mechanism
is used in the CR-UWB system, since the FCC’s power lim-
itation (≤ -41.3 dBm/MHz) on underlay CR-UWB signals
may result in a signiﬁcantly constrained Quality of Service
(QoS) [14]. The CR-UWB’s spectrum efﬁciency is deﬁned
as the ratio of the usable information transmitted (in bps)
to the spectrum resource (bandwidth in MHz) used for the
information transmitting, and is expressed as
ηeff = Bcog
TsW ,
(1)
where Bcog represents the number of bits allocated on
the CR-UWB subcarriers that are used for effective data
transmission, W is the bandwidth used by the transmitted
OFDM symbol, and Ts denotes the OFDM symbol period.
A. Channel Gain of UWB Subcarrier
The distribution of the UWB’s subcarrier frequency re-
sponse is given by [15]
Hi =
L−1
X
k=0
h[k]e−j2πki/N, i ∈ [0, N − 1],
(2)
where L is the number of the sampled fading path, N − 1
is the number of UWB subcarriers, and h[k] denotes the
discrete-time UWB channel impulse response. Then, h[k] is
derived by [15]
h[k] = X
J
X
j=0
M
X
m=0
αm,jδ(kTs − Tj − τm,j), k ∈ [0, L − 1],
(3)
where αm,j is the multipath gain coefﬁcients (attenuation
factor) which denotes the amplitude of multipath compo-
nents. The amplitude of the multipath components are sub-
jected to log-normal distribution. Furthermore, Ts denotes
the sampling interval, Tj represents the time of arrival of
the j-th cluster, and τm,j is the time of arrival of the m-
th ray in the j-th cluster. Authors in [16] show that Hi
is in good approximation, circularly symmetric complex
Gaussian distributed, which is explained by the fact that Hi
results from the superposition of many time-domain mul-
tipath components. Hence, |Hi| is approximately Rayleigh
distributed, and the probability density function p(|Hi|2) is
approximated by [17]
p(|Hi|2) =
1
E{|Hi|2}e
−
|Hi|2
E{|Hi|2} ,
(4)
where E{|Hi|2} = eϕσ2
x, and ϕ is a constant value.
The frequency response for a UWB Non Line-of-Sight
(NLOS) Channel Model (CM) is shown in Fig. 1. It is
seen that the UWB channel is a frequency-selective fading
channel. In OFDM UWB system, the bandwidth of each
UWB subcarrier is set to be smaller than the coherence band-
width of the UWB channel. Hence, each UWB subcarrier
experience non-selective fading.
B. Sensing Model
The spectrum opportunity for a CR-UWB system, i.e.,
the probability that an overlapped spectrum will contain
less than energy threshold power at any instant of time, is
determined by the probability that a PU is operating within
the overlapped spectrum. Since the Poisson distribution
is widely used to model the spectrum occupancy in CR
networks, the probability that a PU is activated following
the Poisson process is written as [18]
P(H1) = p(x; λt) = e−λt(λt)x
x!
,
(5)
where H1 represents the hypothesis that a PU is activated, x
denotes the expected number of PU’s occurrences during the

period of t, and λ is the average number of PU’s occurrence
per µs.
In MB-OFDM CR-UWB receiver, incoming UWB signals
are demodulated by a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) engine,
which facilitates the use of Discrete Fourier Transform
(DFT) based energy detection and feature detection for
spectrum sensing. Compared with feature detection, energy
detection requires much lower computational complexity
and less information of PU (the complexity of the feature
detection is Nlog2N times of energy detection [19]). Thus,
we assume the CR-UWB system uses energy detection
method. The proposed algorithms can be extended when
feature detection is applied.
A notch ﬁlter is deployed posterior to the Inverse FFT
(IFFT) engine of the CR-UWB’s transmitter. The notch ﬁlter
can attenuate the PSD up to 22 dB over 32 UWB subcarriers
and effectively suppress the sidelobes of the subcarriers
which are immediate to PUs’ operating band [20].
For energy detection, the SST that is required for a set
of target probability of detection Pd and probability of false
alarm Pf is determined by [21]
τs =

(Q−1( ˜
Pf) − Q−1( ˜

(6)
where γp is the received Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of
PUs’ signal at the CR-UWB receiver, and fs is the CR-
UWB’s sampling frequency. Furthermore, Q−1(·) denotes
the inverse of the Q-function. Thus, Q−1(Pd) and Q−1(Pf)
are expressed as
Q−1(Pd) = ϵ(N)/σ2

u is the power of the

In a CR-UWB system, the length of SST determines the
time ratio for the system to apply the spectrum management
function for useful data transmission, and is given by
α = Ttxop − τs
Ttxop
,
(9)
where Ttxop is a pre-deﬁned transmission period in the MB-
OFDM UWB MAC layer protocol, called transmission op-
portunity (TXOP). In ECMA-368, the value of Ttxop varied
for different Access Categories (ACs) (i.e., applications) [6].
We assume that the CR-UWB system starts sensing the
channel prior to the start of a TXOP.
Fig. 2 shows that the value of α increases exponentially
with the increase of the received SNR γp. When γp is
low (< −17.6 dB) for Pf
= 0.01, Pd = 0.99, over
50% of the transmission opportunity is used for spectrum
sensing. Thus, the cognitive UWB system can reach a
higher spectrum efﬁciency if the UWB system totally use
the TXOP for transmission on the non-overlapped spectrum
(i.e., the remaining 64 subcarriers) than performing the
spectrum sensing ﬁrst in order to use the 128 subcarrier for
transmission. When the value of γp continues to increase,
the fraction of time differences for UWB’s data transmission
under the two target values of Pf becomes minor.
The effective number of bits that can be allocated on the
CR-UWB system is given by
Bcog = Bα(1 − Pf)(1 − P(H1)),
(10)
where B denotes the total number of bits loaded in the
UWB subcarriers when all the subcarriers are available.
To maximize a CR-UWB system’s spectrum efﬁciency, an
optimal SST value is needed to maximize α while meet the
target value of Pd and Pf.

C. Transmit Power
In UWB systems, transmit power is allocated on a per
MHz basis. The FCC set the peak PSD for UWB must
not exceed -41.3 dBm/MHz. Thus, the larger the occupied
bandwidth the more available transmitter power. The total
transmit power can be determined by integrate the average
PSD over the UWB bandwidth while the maximum PSD
does not exceed the regulatory limits. The use of zero
padding in MB-OFDM UWB system can keep the spectral
peak-to-average ratio at a very low level so as to maximize
the total transmit power. The maximum allowable transmit
power Ptx (dBm) for transmitting an OFDM symbol in a
sub-band is expressed as [22]
Ptx = −41.3 dBm/MHz + 10log10(Nsu · Bsc),
(11)
where Bsc = 4.125 MHz denotes the bandwidth of each
OFDM subcarrier, and Nsu is the number of the used UWB
subcarriers in the sub-band.
III. OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM FORMULATION
In this paper, we formulate joint optimization problem
into a multi-dimensional knapsack problem, as
arg maxPi,α ηeff =
1
TsW
I
X
i=1
J
X
j=1
bijxij

subject to,
Pe ≤ ˜Pe,
(13)
Pi ≤ Pmask,
(14)
˜
Pd ≤ Pd ≤ 1, 0 ≤ Pf ≤ ˜
Pf
(15)
where Pi is the power allocated to the i-th subcarrier by
the user, bij = 1 represents the proﬁt of allocating the j-th
bit to the user’s i-th subcarrier, and xij indicates whether
the CR-UWB’s j-th bit would be allocated on its i-th
subcarrier. In (13), Pe is the CR-UWB’s uncoded average
BER, and ˜Pe denotes the average BER threshold. The Pmask
represents the maximum allowable transmit power on each
UWB subcarrier. Furthermore, ˜
Pf is the target probability of
a false alarm, and ˜
Pd is the target probability of detection.
For M-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM), by
assuming the channel state information is perfectly known
at the UWB receiver and the transmitted symbols are inde-
pendent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with the symbol
energy, Pe for each CR-UWB subcarrier is expressed as [23]
Pb ≈ 2(

!
,
(16)
where γb represents the average received SNR per bit and
is approximated by [24]
γb =
Pi|Hi|2
2σ2ulog2M .
(17)
Thus, the minimum required power for a certain BER
threshold to assign log2M bits on a CR-UWB’s subcarrier
can be given by
Pi(m) =
2σ2
u(M − 1)(1 − Pe
√
Mlog2M
2(
√
M−1) )2
3Hilog2(M)[1 − (1 − Pe
√
Mlog2M
2(
√
M−1) )2]
,
(18)
where m = log2M, M = 2, 4, 8.... Then, the cost of
assigning one more bit to a CR-UWB’s subcarrier can be
derived by
∆Pi = Pi(m) − Pi(m − 1),
(19)
where Pi(0) = 0, which means no power will be allocated
to the subcarrier if there is no bit assigned to the subcarrier.
IV. JOINT OPTIMIZATION METHOD
To maximize the spectrum efﬁciency by adaptive transmit
power allocation (i.e., the spectrum management part of CR-
UWB system data transmission), a greedy algorithm based
method can be applied to assign bits to the subcarrier with
the lowest cost [25]. The complexity of the proposed algo-
rithm in [25] is proportional to O(β·BtotalNusedlog2Nused),
where Nused is the number of the used subcarriers, and
β denotes the proportion of bits that are assigned during
the advance power and bit allocation process. A detailed
discussion of the algorithm can be referred to [25]. Since
Nused contributes to the complexity of the spectrum efﬁ-
ciency maximization algorithm, a new group power alloca-
tion algorithm is proposed based on the previous algorithm
proposed in [25] to lower the computational complexity.
A. Group Power Allocation Algorithm
The group power allocation algorithm consists of three
steps, they are:
1) Grouping a number of adjacent subcarriers into sub-
carrier groups, next
2) Allocating power on subcarrier groups by the algo-
rithm proposed in [25], then
3) Allocating bits on the subcarriers in each subcarrier
group by equal power allocation.
Table I shows that the coherence bandwidth for each UWB
CM are: 53.6 MHz, 28.9 MHz, 20.6 MHz and 12.4 MHz for
CM1, CM2, CM3 and CM4, respectively. Hence, the adja-
cent UWB subcarriers are grouped into blocks whose total
bandwidth is smaller than the coherence bandwidth of the
UWB channel. By evaluating the channel gain of a certain
subcarrier block, the proposed algorithm can modulate the
same amount of bits to each subcarrier in the block using
M-ary QAM modulation.

The maximum number of subcarriers in a subcarrier block
for each UWB channel model is computed by
Nblock =
BWc
BWs

,
(20)
where BWc is the coherence bandwidth in a UWB channel
model, and BWs represents the bandwidth of a UWB
subcarrier. Thus, the value of Nblock in each UWB channel
model is listed in Table I. The subcarrier grouping process
is performed by
Ng =
 Nused
Nblock

,
(21)
where Nused is the number of the subcarriers used for the
OFDM symbol, and Ng is the number of subcarrier groups
after the grouping process and is listed in Table I when
Nused = 128. The equation (21) implies that the last sub-
carrier block in an OFDM symbol contains Nblock = (Nused
mod Nblock) subcarriers, where mod represents the modulo
operation [18].
The equivalent single channel SNR of each subcarrier
group equals to the geometric mean of the SNRs on each
of the subcarriers in the group. Hence,
SNRGi =


Nblock
Y
j=1
SNRi(j)



Nblocki
,
(22)
where SNRGi is the equivalent single channel SNR of the
i-th subcarrier group, and SNRi(j) represents the channel
SNR of the j-th subcarrier in the i-th subcarrier group. The
value of SNRi(j) is computed by
SNRi(j) = ε · |Hi(j)|2
σ2
=
|Hi(j)|2
BWi(j)σ2 ,
(23)
where ε = 1 denotes a unit power allocation on each
subcarrier, Hi(j) is the j-th subcarrier channel gain in the
i-th subcarrier group, σ2 represents the noise PSD of the
AWGN channel, and BWi(j) denotes the bandwidth of each
UWB subcarrier.
Then, the cost of assigning a number of bits to the
subcarrier group can be derived as (18) and (19), and the
optimal power allocation algorithm proposed in [25] can be
applied. Compared with the power allocation algorithm in
[25], the order-of-growth of the proposed spectrum man-
agement algorithm for the joint optimization algorithm is
reduced to O(β · BtotalNglog2Ng). Since the complexity of
the two algorithms both take linearithmic time, the reduction
of the term N in N · log2N will signiﬁcantly lower the
complexity of the algorithm when the total number of the
allocated bits Btotal is the same in the two algorithms.
B. Sensing Time Optimization Algorithm
Discussions in Section II indicate that an optimal tradeoff
can be made between the probability of false alarm and the
spectrum efﬁciency. Thus, by manipulating (7) and (8), Pf
can be expressed as a function of Pd and τs, as
Pf = Q
 
Q−1(Pd)

2(2γp + N) + γp

(25)
The value of Bcog is a function of τs and Pd.
For a certain target value of
˜
Pd, Fig. 3 shows the
spectrum efﬁciency as a function of the CR-UWB system’s
spectrum sensing time τs in CM1 with Pe being set to
10−4. Under different γp and ˜
Pd, the spectrum efﬁciencies
increases exponentially with the increase of τs and reaches
the optimum at different spectrum sensing time spot. The
ﬁgure shows that there exists an optimized spectrum sensing
time τs for different target Pd under different γp value. The
optimal value of τs will increase in order to reach a higher
target Pd value at a lower γp. For different Pd and γp,
the spectrum efﬁciency decreases monotonically when the
τs grows beyond the corresponding optimal time spot. The
long spectrum sensing time degrade the spectrum efﬁciency
because the corresponding transmission time in an TXOP
for the UWB user’s certain application is shortened.
For a target ˜
Pd, the optimal τs is computed by ﬁnding the
root for
fratio(τs) = 0,

where fratio(x) = F ′

numerical method is used to ﬁnd a value of τs that is
approximate to the optimum.
V. NUMERICAL RESULTS
The UWB CM1 (Line-of-Sight) and CM3 (NLOS) are
used to simulate the wireless channel environment. We
assume that the PUs are WiMAX systems, the parameter
settings for the PUs can be referred to [25]. As shown
in Fig. 4, the spectrum efﬁciency performance of the pro-
posed algorithm is analyzed in CM1 and compared with
the Hughes-Hartogs (HHuwb) algorithm. The spectrum efﬁ-
ciency degradation of using group power allocation increases
exponentially with the increase of the BER threshold, and
the performance degradation is higher when more subcar-
riers are included in one subcarrier group. For example,
the spectrum efﬁciency reached by group power allocation
is 50% lower than that of the HHuwb algorithm when 3
subcarriers are included in each subcarrier group as the
BER threshold approaches 10−4. However, the algorithm
complexity is over 3 times lower in group power allocation
algorithm than that in subcarrier-by-subcarrier the HHuwb
algorithm.
Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 compare the spectrum efﬁciency
achieved without using the SST optimization algorithm and
the spectrum efﬁciency obtained when the SST optimization
algorithm is applied. Observations in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6
show that by using the SST optimization algorithm in low
γp regime (i.e., < −12 dB), the spectrum efﬁciency is
signiﬁcantly increased. For example, at γp = −19 dB, the

spectrum efﬁciency of the CR-UWB system is 0.49 bps/Hz
which is twice of spectrum efﬁciency that is achieved by the
CR-UWB system without using the SST optimization algo-
rithm. With the increase of the γp, the difference between the
two lines decreases exponentially. At high γp regime (i.e.,
> −10 dB), the spectrum efﬁciencies of the two CR-UWB
systems are very close because the large γp value becomes
the dominant part of (24), the target Pd is reached at a very
small τs.
Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 indicate that the SST optimization algo-
rithm is more suitable for the situation where the received
γp is low than the situation where the γp is high.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, a new joint optimization algorithm design
with respect to transmit power allocation and SST for
spectrum efﬁciency maximization is proposed in the OFDM-
based CR-UWB system. The proposed SST algorithm max-
imizes the effective data transmission time for the CR-UWB
system within a limited TXOP under the constraint of the tar-
get probability of detection/false alarm. The proposed group
power allocation algorithm can obtain the optimal spectrum
efﬁciency by adaptively assigning the transmit power to

the subcarrier groups according to the effective signal-to-
noise ratio of each subcarrier group whose bandwidth is
less than the coherence bandwidth of the UWB channel. By
combining the SST optimization algorithm with the group
power allocation algorithm, the CR-UWB system’s spectrum
efﬁciency is signiﬁcantly enhanced with low complexity
when the received PUs’ SNR at the CR-UWB receiver is
low.
