Abstract—In this paper, an energy efﬁcient communication
and localization framework able to manage the synchronization
between nodes and to provide the localization of nomadic nodes
within Nomadic Wireless Sensor Networks is presented. It
is comprised of a MAC protocol based on sleep and active
states and a novel localization algorithm based on Differential
Direction of Arrival. Some numerical simulations was per-
formed to show the low power consumption of the proposed
protocol. Moreover, a system of ﬁxed and nomadic nodes was
implemented to test the proposed localization algorithm. The
reported experiments show a mean positioning error of 0.61
m and a mean orientation error of 17 degrees within a 10 m
x 10 m square space.

col; Differential Direction of Arrival; Switched Beam Antenna.
I. INTRODUCTION
The management of mobility within Wireless Sensor
Networks [1] (WSNs) has recently gained much interest
as the number of applications that require nomadic sen-
sor nodes has increased. The presence of nomadic nodes
within a WSN allows the improvement of system monitoring
capabilities but, at the same time, it increases the system
complexity (since a localization algorithm is required), the
energy consumption, as well as the delay and the latency of
the network. For this purpose, adopting a nomadic WSN is
expected to satisfy calls for a carefully localization algorithm
and an optimized communication protocol able not only
to minimize the energy waste, but also to synchronize the
ﬁxed and the nomadic nodes and to manage the localization
procedure.
This paper deals with a communication and localization
framework suitable for Nomadic WSN. In particular, after
a brief description of the 2D Music algorithm, the pro-
posed localization algorithm is presented in in Section III.
In Section IV, the communication protocol is described.
Finally, in Sections V and VI, protocol performance and
some localization tests are reported.
II. 2-D MUSIC ALGORITHM
Let an array of N omnidirectional elements receive sig-
nals from L (L < N) narrowband far-ﬁeld sources with the
unknown Direction of Arrivals (DOAs) {φ1, . . . , φL}. The
array N × 1 snapshot vector at time k can be modeled as
[2]
x(k) = A(φ)s(k) + n(k)
(1)
where φ = [φ1, . . . , φL]T is the L×1 vector of signal DOAs,
A(φ) .= [a(φ1), . . . , a(φL)]
(2)
is the N ×L signal steering matrix, s(k) is the L×1 vector
of signal waveforms, n(k) is the N × 1 vector of noise and
(·)T stands for the transpose.
Assuming an array of arbitrary geometry, the N × 1
steering vector can be expressed as
a(φ) =
h
. . . , ej 2π
λ (xisinφ+yicosφ), . . .
iT
(3)
where λ is the signal wavelength, j = √−1, {xi, yi} (i =
1, . . . , N) are the coordinates of the ith array element and
and it will be hereafter assumed that the array manifold is
known exactly.
The N × N array covariance matrix can be written as
Rx .= E{x(k)xH(k)} = ARsAH + σ2
nI
(4)
where Rs = E{s(k)sH(k)} is the source covariance matrix,
σ2
n is the noise variance, I is the identity matrix, E(·) is the
statistical expectation and (·)H is the Hermitian transpose
(transpose and conjugate of (·)).
The singular value decomposition of the exact covariance
matrix can be written as
Rx =
N
X
k=1
λkukuH
k
(5)
where λk and uk (k = 1, . . . , N) are the singular values
and corresponding singular vectors. Let the singular values
λk be sorted in nonascending order. Then, the matrices
Us .= [u1, · · · , uL],
Un .= [uL+1, · · · , uN]
(6)

contain L the signal and N − L noise subspace singular
vectors, respectively.
In practical situations, the exact array covariance matrix
Rx is unavailable and its sample estimate
ˆRx = 1
K
K
X
k=1
x(k)xH(k)
(7)
is used, where K is the number of snapshots.
The singular value decomposition of the sample covari-
ance matrix (7) yields
ˆRx = ˆUsˆΛs ˆU H
s + ˆUnˆΛn ˆU H
n
(8)
where the sample singular values are again sorted in
nonascending order (ˆλ1 ≥ ˆλ2 ≥ · · · ≥ ˆλN) and the matrices
ˆUs
.= [ˆu1, . . . , ˆuL] and ˆUn
.= [ˆuL+1, . . . , ˆuN] contain in
their columns the signal and noise subspace singular vectors
of ˆRx, respectively. Correspondingly, the diagonal matrices
ˆΛs
.= diag{ˆλ1, . . . , ˆλL} and ˆΛn
.= diag{ˆλL+1, . . . , ˆλN}
are built from the signal and noise subspace singular values
of ˆRx, respectively.
The conventional MUSIC null-spectrum function can be
expressed as
f(φ) = aH(φ) ˆUn ˆU H
n a(φ) = ∥ ˆU H
n a(φ)∥2
(9)
where ∥ · ∥2 is the vector 2-norm. The spectral MUSIC
technique estimates the signal DOAs from the minima of
this function by searching over φ with a ﬁne grid. The
computational complexity of this spectral search step is
typically substantially higher than that of the singular value
decomposition step because, as a rule, J ≫ N where J
is the total number of spectral points. Note that for each
spectral point, the product of ˆU H
n and a(φ) (or, alternatively
of ˆUs and a(φ)) has to be computed.
Often, the inverse of the normalized MUSIC null-
spectrum function is considered to compute and exalt the
signal DOAs. This function is computed as follow.
f(φ) =
∥a(φ)∥
∥ ˆU H
n a(φ)∥2
(10)
In this case the signal DOAs is estimated from the maxima
of (10).
III. LOCALIZATION ALGORITHM
Let A, B and C be three ﬁxed nodes positioned in
a Euclidean Geometry Plane Π and having coordinates
(xA, yA), (xB, yB) and (xC, yC), respectively.
Let M be a nomadic node also positioned in the plane Π
and having generic coordinates (xM, yM). M is equipped
by a Switched Beam Antenna characterized by a group of N
directive antennas that together cover an angle of 360◦. Let
ai(φ) (i = 1, . . . , N) be the azimuth steering vector (gain
vector) of each directive antenna.
M computes its coordinates (xM, yM) in three steps.
1) It applies the MUSIC algorithm.
2) It applies the law of sines starting from the knowledge
of the coordinates of the ﬁxed nodes.
3) It performs the trilateration algorithm.
A. MUSIC algorithm
According to (1) and (7), M builds up for each ﬁxed nodes
K vectors of N × 1 RSSI values. Let xk0i(·) (k0 ∈ [1; K])
the kth RSSI vector of the ﬁxed node i (i = A, B, C). The
position xk0i(n0) (n0 ∈ [1; N] ∧ k0 ∈ [1; K]) will contain
the RSSI value computed at the kth iteration selecting the
nth antenna’s sector. The RSSI values can also be organized
in matrix form as follow.
Xi =


xN1i
· · ·
xNKi







(11)
Then, according to (7) and (8), M computes for each ﬁxed
node the covariance matrix Rxi (i = A, B, C) as
Rxi
=
1
K
K
P
k=1
xki(n)xH
ki(n)
=

si + UniΛniU H
ni
(12)
Finally, according to (10), M evaluates the angles φi (i =
A, B, C) as
φi = argmaxφ
a(φ)
at(φ)UniU tnia(φ)
(13)
B. Law of Sine
Let a, b and c be the lengths of the legs of a triangle
opposite angles ˆA, ˆB and ˆC. Then the law of sines states
that
a
sin ˆA
=
b
sin ˆB
=
c
sin ˆC
If two sides of a triangle are the radius, the law of sines
states that
|AB| = 2R sin(φC
2 )
(14)
where, as Figure 1 shows, AB is a chord, R is the radius of
the circle and ﬁnally φC is the angle at the centre subtended
by the chord AB. Knowing also that:
1) angles at the circumnference subtended by a chord in
the same segment are equal and
2) if two angles stand on the same chord, then the angle
at the centre is twice the angle at the circumnference,
Equation (14) can be expressed as
|AB| = 2R sin(φAB)
(15)
The law of sines is used by the nomadic node M to
perform another step towards the evaluation of its position.
From the knowledge of the coordinates of the anchor nodes

and the angles φA, φB and φC, M obtains the equation of
three circumferences A, B and C passing for M and for A

can be expressed as follow:

are the centers of the circles and ˆφAB, ˆφBC and ˆφCA are
ˆφA − ˆφB, ˆφB − ˆφC and ˆφC − ˆφA.
C. Trilateration Algorithm
Finally, M ﬁnds its position performing the trilateration.
In particular, it ﬁnds the intersection point of the cirmun-
ferences A, B and C. This concept is shown in Figure 2.
The intersection point is simple to compute thanks to the
following formulas:
x
=
xA + dxk
p + dy
p

A − k2
y
=
yA + dyk

where dx = xA − xB, dy = yA − yB, p =

d2x + d2y and
k = p2+r2

.
Once the position of the nomadic node is estimated, the
orientation is determined in a straigh-forward manner. Given
the position, the angle between the nomadic node and one
of the anchor is easily derived as

IV. MAC PROTOCOL
Taking the IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Func-
tion (DCF) [3] as a starting point, several more energy
efﬁcient techniques have been proposed in literature to avoid
excessive power waste due to so called idle listening. They
are based on periodical preamble sampling performed at the
receiver side in order to leave a low power state and receive
the incoming messages, as in the WiseMAC protocol [4].
Deriving from the classical contention-based scheme, several
protocols (S-MAC [5] and TMAC) have been proposed to
address the overhead idle listening by synchronizing the
nodes and implementing a duty cycle within each slot.
Resorting to the above considerations, a class of MAC
protocols was derived, named Synchronous Transmission
Asynchronous Reception (STAR) which is particularly suited
for a ﬂat network topology and beneﬁts from both WiseMAC
and S-MAC schemes. More speciﬁcally, due to the intro-
duction of a duty-cycle, it joins the power saving capability
together with the advantages provided by the offset schedul-
ing, without excessive overhead signaling.
According to STAR protocol, each node wakes up inde-
pendently, entering an initial idle state (init state) in which
it remains for the time interval necessary for performing the
elementary CPU operations and to be completely switched
on (Tinit). Moreover, before entering the discovery state,
each device starts to organize the time into frames whose
durations are Tf.
In the discovery state, each node tries to identify its
neighbors and to establish a time synchronization with them.
To this purpose, it remains in a listening mode for a time
interval equal to Tset−up ≥ 2Tf and begins to periodically
43

ICSNC 2012 : The Seventh International Conference on Systems and Networks Communications

broadcast a HELLO message sending its ID and its phase.
The phase is the time interval after which the sender exits
from the discovery state, enters the regime state and changes
back in listening mode. A node that receives a HELLO
message adds the source node to the list of its own active
neighbors and transmits an acknowledgement.
Once the discovery state has expired, each node enters the
regime state. Within this state, the operation mode is duty
cycled with a periodic alternation of listening and sleeping
sub-periods whose time intervals are Tl and Ts, respectively.
The duty cycle function is given by the following formula:
d =
Tl
Tl + Ts
(16)
In the regime state, each node tries to preserve the
synchronization with its neighbors. To achieve this, it sends
a frame-by-frame HELLO message in a unicast way to the
active nodes in its list according to the phase transmitted
by them in previous HELLO messages. As in the discovery
state, the HELLO message contains the ID and the phase
that, in this case, is the time interval after which the sender
claims to be again in the listening status waiting for the
HELLO messages. The phase φ is evaluated according to
the following rule:
φ1 = τ − Tl
(17)
if the node is in the sleeping mode, where τ is the time
remaining to the beginning of the next frame. Conversely, if
the node is in the listening status, φ2 is computed as:
φ2 = τ + Ts
(18)
In the regime state, nomadic nodes are able to move
within the operative area. Unlike the ﬁxed nodes equipped
by an omnidirectional antenna, they are hardwired with a
Switched Beam Antenna, a group of N overlapping adjacent
beams (sectors) that together cover an angle of 360◦. When
a nomadic node reaches its intermediate waypoint, it stops
for a predeﬁned pause time (Tpt) and broadcasts a HELLO
message per sector for a time interval equal to 2Tf by
notifying its presence and listening the channel in search
of HELLO messages sent by the ﬁxed nodes in its coverage
area. At the end of the scanning, if the nomadic node found
a number of active ﬁxed nodes less than three, it moves
itself; otherwise it groups the ﬁxed nodes per sector and
chooses the three nodes with the hightest RSSI value and
belonging to different sectors (preferably opposite sectors).
If this choice is not possible, it takes into account only the
three nodes with the hightest RSSI value.
According to the phase stored during the scanning inter-
val, the nomadic node sends a LOCALIZATION REQUEST
message to the ﬁrst ﬁxed node. The ﬁxed node wakes up
and sends k (k/N ∈ N+) LOCALIZATION RESPONSE
messages thanks to which the nomadic node creates a
k/N × N matrix of RSSI values.
The nomadic node performs the same procedure to the
other two ﬁxed nodes.
Finally, it applies the localization algorithm described in
Section III to evaluate its position within the operative area.
Once Tpt is expired, it keeps moving again.
The channel access is managed by means of the carrier
sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)
scheme. This mechanism is very effective in reducing colli-
sions.
Each node remains in the regime state until there is at least
one neighbor, otherwise if there are no active neighbors it
reenters the discovery state in search of connectivity.
To complete the protocol characterization, whenever a
node battery is depleted, this node turns off, entering an
off state.
V. PROTOCOL PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
In order to fully characterize the STAR MAC approach,
the related energy cost normalized can be evaluated, as
follows:
C = crxdTf +csleep[Tf(1−d)−NTpkt]+NCtx
[mAh] (19)
where csleep and crx represent the sleeping and the receiving
costs [mA] and Ctx is the single packet transmission costs
[mAh], Tf is the frame interval [s], d is the duty cycle, Tpkt
is the synchronization packet time length [s] and ﬁnally N
is the number of neighbors. When the following inequality
holds:
NTpkt ≪ Tf
(20)
then:
C ≃ crxdTf + csleepTf(1 − d) + NCtx
[mAh]
(21)
The protocol cost normalized to the synchronization time is
ﬁnally:
C
Tf
= crxd + csleep(1 − d) + NCtx
Tf
[mA]
(22)
As highlighted in TABLE I, it usually happens that ctx ≪
csleep ≪ crx , where ctx = Ctx/Tpkt and Tpkt is the packet
transmission time [s] assumed equal to 100 ms as worst
case. This means that the major contribution to the overall
cost is represented by the listening period that the STAR
MAC protocol tries to suitably minimize.

MAC schemes. It is worth noticing that the performance of
the proposed protocol is better with respect to the existing
approach for a number of neighbor nodes greater than 7.
In Figure 3(b), the normalized costs of S-MAC and STAR
MAC approaches are compared with respect to the duty
cycle duration for a number of neighbor nodes equal to 8. It
is possible to notice that for d < 3.5% the proposed protocol
provide a signiﬁcant gain.
VI. EXPERIMENTAL LOCALIZATION RESULTS
In this section, some experimental results are presented.
The experiments were conducted in a room of 10m ×
10m. Fixed nodes assumed the following positions: A =
(1.25, 1.78) m, B = (8.66, 1.81) m and C = (4.50, 8.50)
m, respectively. This arrangement resambles an almost
equilateral triangle, a suited shape to uniformly covers the
test area. Otherwise nomadic node assumed four position
P1 = (4.50, 4.72); P2 = (2.85, 4.72), P3 = (6.20, 4.72),
P4 = (4.50, 5.50). The nomadic node reference was always
parallel to the positive x axis, i.e it faces the east direction.
Both ﬁxed and nomadic nodes were able to scan signals
in a emphomnidirectional manner (in a 2D sense), but in a
different sense. The ﬁxed nodes were equipped with a com-
mon dipole, a standard low-gain omnidirectional radiator.
The nomadic node instead was equipped with a Switched
Beam Antenna (SBA).
(a) Antenna Element
(b) Pictorial Representation of the 6
Patterns
Figure 4: Switching beam system. Given the antenna pattern,
a six elements arrangement is enough to cover the entire
angular range.
To keep a cost-effective proﬁle, this array is made of 6
printed antennas working at 2.45 GHz directly fed by a
commercial single pole six through (SP6T) FET switch. The
natural arrangement to cover the entire 2π angular range
is the uniform circular array (UCA). This structure is the
best trade-off between the need of simple architecture for
and a wide angle steerable beam. The SBA gain G can be
represented by six element vectors. This structure is the
best trade-off between the need of a simple architecture
and a wide angle steerable beam. The elementary patch
antenna of the array shown in Figure 4 is an Elliptical
Slitted Disc Antenna [6], a circularly polarized radiator
well suited for localization purposes. Printed on a cheap
plastic substrate (εr = 4.4, h = 1.6 mm), the antenna
shows a cardioid-like pattern, suitable for the switched beam
arrangement. The compact dimension of 35 mm is a good
compromise between CP radiations and pattern degradation
by electromagnetic coupling.
The results of the four experiments are depicted in Figure
5 and Figure 6. In all the cases, the radial error was below 90
cm, and the orientation of the system was identiﬁed within
the 35◦ of pointing error. The entire experimental data set
showed an average error in the position estimation of 0.61
m and 17◦ for the orientation.
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The management of mobility within WSNs has recently
gained much interest as the number of applications that
require nomadic sensor nodes has increased. The presence
of nomadic nodes within a WSN allows the improvement
of system monitoring capabilities but, at the same time,
it increases the system complexity (since a localization
algorithm is required), the energy consumption, as well as
the delay and the latency of the network.
In this paper, a communication and localization frame-
work was proposed. The numerical and experimental results
showed the advantages and the feasibility of the proposed
solution. This allows the application of the solution under
investigation to the more general ﬁeld of environmental
monitoring and in particular in robot applications.
