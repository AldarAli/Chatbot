Abstract—RFID systems, in general, increase the efﬁciency of
logistic systems, e.g., inventory of stocks. Unfortunately, present
existing systems come fast to their limits if a certain number of
RFID transponders must be inventoried in a limited period of
time, as the channel access method of current RFID systems
is based on Time Division Multiple Access. To shorten the
inventory process, this work shows an implementation of an
UHF RFID system based on semi-passive UHF transponders,
using Code Division Multiple Access as anti-collision method.
The work focuses on the uplink channel (tag to reader) that
covers the transponders’ backscattered signals. This channel
access method enables simultaneous transfer of transponder
data; i.e., all transponders in the ﬁeld may respond at the
same time within the same frequency band. The data transfer
realized for the uplink channel uses a set of orthogonal
spreading sequences (Gold codes) being different for every
transponder. The RFID reader designed in this work despreads
the backscattered signals and decodes the data of the different
transponders. This work shows, in principle, the opportunity
for a simultaneous data transfer on the uplink channel in
RFID systems, which in turn may reduce the time needed for
a complete inventory round. The entire system is build upon
dedicated hardware, which is, also, a new aspect of this paper.

I. INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, the RFID technology makes it possible to
register all purchased goods of a customer at a checkout
counter, but so far it was not possible to accomplish an entire
stock inventory within a big warehouse, at once. If several
transponders are located within the reading range of a reader,
it may come, with a certain probability, to overlapping
signals (collisions) between some of these transponders. This
is the reason why anti-collision procedures are widely used,
which in turn provide methods trying to prevent transponders
from broadcasting their information simultaneously. Existing
RFID solutions, which are qualiﬁed to cope with reading
several transponder in one inventory round, are based on
Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA, see Figure 1a),
meaning that the transponder in the reader’s ﬁeld transmit
their data at different moments. Loefﬂer et al. show in [1]
that code division multiple access (CDMA)-based systems
(Figure 1b) may improve the process of inventory rounds.

Different communication channel access techniques for RFID:

entiates between the time-independent principle of pure or
unslotted ALOHA and the temporally subdivided principle
of slotted ALOHA. By using unslotted ALOHA, data is sent
at the time it is available, therefore it is fairly unorganized.
In contrast to unslotted ALOHA, the principle of slotted
ALOHA deﬁnes the points of time a broadcasting of data is
permitted. For instance, data transmitted by two transponders
using slotted ALOHA only experience a collision if both
transponders begin to send their data at the same time slot.
The anti-collision procedure of the EPC Gen2 standard
[2], [3] is based on slotted ALOHA. A so called Q-parameter
controls the overall inventory process. The choice of Q is
a typical trade-off. Choosing a high Q will lead in fact to
a smaller number of collisions but on the other hand to an
increased time needed for an inventory round. A smaller Q
will lead to less acquisition time, but to more collisions,
indeed. In addition, the usage of TDMA methods brings the
systems to its limits when a certain number of transponders
have to be inventoried in a very short time. For instance, fast
working production lines could face that kind of problem.
The introduction of Code Division Multiple Access may
ﬁnd a remedy ( [1], [4]). The transponders, each equipped
with a unique orthogonal spreading code, may send their
data at any given point in time. Overlapping signals will be
sorted out by the process of despreading.
The objective of this work is the realization of a CDMA-
based RFID system using semi-passive UHF transponders,
whereby the recognition of the transponders shall be done

quasi-simultaneously. This means that the transponders are
transmitting data within the same time range and frequency
band, in contrast to existing systems based on TDMA. For
a ﬁrst workaround this work concentrates on the uplink
(i.e., tag to reader communication). The designed UHF
transponders operate in semi-passive mode, meaning that the
digital part of the transponders has an active power supply,
whereas the radio frequency (RF) part works in passive mode
(principle of backscatter [3]). The RFID reader, though, is
separated into two parts. Part one, described as transmitting
system, generates a sinusoidal wave at a certain UHF
frequency. The frequency band for the usage of RFID within
Europe is limited to a band between 865 MHz and 868 MHz.
Part two, the receiving system, mixes down the backscattered
signals, which are further processed analog, A/D converted
and processed digital within a DSP. An overview of the
complete system is given in Figure 3.
The paper is organized as follows. Following the intro-
duction (Section I) and related work (Section II), Section III
shows various anti-collision methods for RFID. This section
focuses on ALOHA and slotted ALOHA as well as on some
basic CDMA methods. Also, theoretical considerations are
made to show the essential advantages of CDMA in RFID
systems. Section IV goes into more detail regarding the
combination of RFID and CDMA as channel access method.
The proposed and realized CDMA-based RFID system is
described in Section V. Within this section, the transmit
stage, the transponder and the receiving stage are explained
in detail. Section VI presents measurements regarding the
system parts in the preceding section. Results are depicted in
Section VII, whereas the article concludes with Section VIII.
II. RELATED WORK
There is still ongoing research in the topic of combin-
ing classic RFID and CDMA methods. Mazurek [5]–[7]
describes an approach where active RFID transponders are
used to implement a direct-sequence (DS) CDMA RFID
uplink transmission. The overall system design is described
in [5]. It consists of several tags working in the 433 MHz
ISM (industrial, scientiﬁc and medical) radio band. 127+1
Gold chips are applied at a stated chip rate of the RFID
tags with 97.75 kHz. As the RFID tags are active, the output
power level of the tags’ transmitters is -10 dBm. Also, this
paper shows theoretical, simulated and experimental results
of the implementation. More results of this system are shown
in [6]. Mazurek presents in [7] a performance analysis of the
proposed active RFID system with the unslotted DS-CDMA
transmission scheme. According to his paper, the active
RFID system with DS-CDMA is able to successfully read
out three times more tags per kilohertz bandwidth (RFID
uplink channel) than an ALOHA-based RFID system. This
shows the available potential of CDMA in RFID systems.
Other work related to this subject mainly consists of
theoretical work and carried out simulations. The work
done in [8] compares different approaches to overcome
present limitations by simulating and evaluating slotted
ALOHA, ID arbitration and direct-sequence CDMA. Lim
and Mok [8] came to the result that the performance
results of CDMA gives superior performance compared to
the other two methods. Tseng and Lin [9] demonstrated
(under usage of simulations) that the proposed Spreaded
Partial-Q Slot Count algorithm outperforms existing anti-
collision algorithms (such as common EPC Gen2) in terms
of throughput. This algorithm is indeed a mixture of the
commonly used EPC Gen2 anti-collision algorithm and a
DS-CDMA approach.
A design of a CDMA-based transponder in HF-RFID
(i.e., 13.56 MHz) is proposed by Fukumizu et al. [10]; the
system is based on a PSK-like modulation scheme with a
time hopping DS-CDMA multi-access, i.e., a combination
of TDMA and CDMA. A SAW (surface acoustic wave)
RFID tag is proposed in [11] and a prototype was tested
at a frequency of 250 MHz.
The work from Rohatgi and Durgin [12] is in turn more
closely related to this work. Nevertheless, basic differences
are, e.g., the chosen chip rate, which is 1 kcps (chips per
second), whereas this system operates with a minimum
chip rate of 1.5 Mcps. Another difference is the underlying
code sequence of the transponders. Rohatgi and Durgin [12]
propose the usage of a PN-sequence (Pseudo Noise) in
contrast to the Gold codes used in this work. The generation
of orthogonal code sequences with different lengths is, e.g.,
described in [13] and will therefore not be part of this paper.
III. BASIC PRINCIPLES OF ANTI-COLLISION METHODS
FOR RFID
This section shall outline some basic issues regarding
anti-collision methods within RFID. Basic and state-of-the-
art anti-collision methods are shown in Subsection III-A.
Subsection III-B presents theoretical performance issues re-
garding the throughput by comparing state-of-the-art TDMA
methods with CDMA anti-collision methods.
A. ALOHA and slotted ALOHA
Before
elucidating
the
state-of-the-art
anti-collision
method for UHF RFID systems, the principle of ALOHA
and unslotted ALOHA [14] is illustrated. The ALOHA
protocol (or pure ALOHA), ﬁrst published by Abramson
[15], is a very simple transmission protocol. The transmitter
sends its data, no matter if the transmission channel is
free or not. This means the transmitter does not care
about collisions with other transmitters. The transmitter
resends its data later, if the acknowledgment from the
receiver is missing. RFID systems based on the principle
of pure ALOHA are, e.g., based on the TTF principle, i.e.,
transponder-talks-ﬁrst. The IPX protocol from IPICO [16]
is an example for RFID systems using unslotted or pure
ALOHA.

The extended ALOHA protocol, called slotted ALOHA
[17], introduces time slots in which the transmitter must
send its data at the beginning. Therefore, collisions only
occur within a full time slot. This extension doubles
the maximum throughput of the system. Most current
RFID protocols are based on the principle of slotted
ALOHA, as is also the very common used EPC standard
UHF Class-1 Generation-2 air interface protocol V1.2.0
(ISO 18000-6C), commonly known as “Gen2”. Basically,
the “Gen2” standard works as follows. The standard
deﬁnes, that every communication is triggered by the RFID
reader, i.e., RTF (reader-talks-ﬁrst). An inventory round,
i.e., the process of detecting all available transponders, for
instance, is started with the Query-command to acquire all
transponders available in the read range. This command
inherits a so called Q-parameter. Using this Q-parameter,
every transponder generates a random number RN in the
range [0; 2Q − 1] and initializes its internal slot counter
with this random number. If, at a given moment, the value
of the slot counter of one or more transponders equals
0, the transponders send a 16 bit random number called
RN16. After the acknowledgment of the RN16 through the
reader, the electronic product code (EPC) is transmitted
from the transponder to the reader and the transponder will
be marked as inventoried. All the left-over (non-marked)
transponders are prompted to decrement its slot counter by
sending a QueryRep-command, and the procedure starts all
over again. In the case of several transponders initializing
their slot counters with the same random number RN, it
will come sooner or later to a signal collision as the slot
counters will reach zero at the same time slot. If the reader
recognizes such a collision, another inventory round will be
initiated to identify the left-over transponders. Therefore,
a newly value of Q will be introduced and new random
numbers will be calculated.
Lots of work has been done to improve the current
EPC standard. Improving the current standard anti-collision
method by choosing an appropriate value of Q, e.g.,
dynamically, is described in [18]–[20]. The right choice of
Q is of great importance for the overall system performance,
so that an accurate estimation would improve the time
needed for an inventory round. Slightly new algorithms,
based on the current EPC “Gen2” standard are outlined,
e.g, in [21], [22]. New better performing algorithms for
the slotted ALOHA protocol for RFID are described in
[23]–[26]. A complete new system with time hopping on
the communication link from tag to reader is outlined in
[27].
B. Throughput in TDMA- and CDMA-based Systems
The throughput S in dependence of the trafﬁc channel
rate G describes the performance of a given transmission
system regarding how many packets must be transmitted
(statistically) until a successful transmission occurs. This

Various throughputs S over trafﬁc rate G for ALOHA, slotted
ALOHA and CDMA
statement is given with the term G
S as described by Kleinrock
and Tobagi [28]. The reciprocal of this term, i.e., S
G deﬁnes
accordingly the probability of a successful transmission.
The channel capacity is determined by maximizing S with
respect to G [28]. According to Abramson [15] the pure
ALOHA transmission has a relation between S and G of
S = G e−G
(1)
, whereas the throughput of the slotted ALOHA transmission
is deﬁned after Roberts [17] with
S = G e−2G
(2)
. Accordingly, the maximum channel capacity is
1
2e
≈
18.4% for pure ALOHA and
1
e
≈
36.8% for slotted
ALOHA.
For a fair comparison between CDMA-based systems and
ALOHA systems, the total bandwidth has to be maintained
the same for both systems. A CDMA system has a so called
spreading factor C, which is proportional to the length of the
spreading codes respectively the ratio between chip rate and
bit rate (i.e., Rchip/Rbit) used. According to Linnartz and
Vvedenskaya [29] the throughput S and the offered trafﬁc
rate G is

. Setting C = 1 leads to the slotted ALOHA transmis-
sion scheme. Figure 2 shows various throughputs S over
the trafﬁc rate G. The ﬁgure shows the throughputs for
ALOHA (channel capacity 18.4%), slotted ALOHA and
CDMA with spreading factor C = 1 (channel capacity
36.8%), CDMA with C = 5 (channel capacity 50.87%)
and CDMA with C = 10 (channel capacity 58.31%). This
graph shows the basic difference between TDMA (ALOHA-
based) and CDMA systems. In general, TDMA-based RFID

systems can handle much more RFID transponders with
a lower overall throughput. CDMA-based system, on the
other hand, are able to handle a limited amount of RFID
tags with higher overall throughput. For instance, assuming
a limited amount of RFID transponders for a trafﬁc rate
G = 0.73. The throughput of unslotted ALOHA would be
SALOHA = 16.95% and the throughput of slotted ALOHA
Sunslotted ALOHA = 35.18%. A CDMA-based system with a
spreading factor C of 10 would have there its maximum
throughput of SCDMA,C=10 = 58.31%. This scenario is
shown in Figure 2.
Finally, it can be stated that CDMA-based RFID systems
may be better for particular applications, in which the
number of transponders is limited and the inventory process
has to be made very fast, e.g., fast production lines and
automation processes.
Particular slotted ALOHA CDMA systems and corre-
sponding performances may be found in [30], [31]. Other
works describe certain CDMA systems with error correc-
tion which really outperform the TDMA-based systems.
Examples can be found in [32]–[36]. Also this list is not
complete it gives a short overview of CDMA-based system
performances.
IV. BASIC PRINCIPLES OF CDMA FOR RFID
This section shows some basic work regarding UHF RFID
systems in conjunction with CDMA.
An IC design for an experimental transponder is offered
in [37]. The transponder uses time-hopping DS-CDMA, but
operates within the RFID HF region (13.56 MHz). There-
fore, the transponder cannot be compared directly with the
proposed approach, but shows, that a fully integrated circuit
for future releases of CDMA-based RFID UHF transponders
is possible. Wang et al. [38] describes an anti-collision
method based on CDMA. Gold codes are used as spreading
sequences. Also, a ﬁrst design of a transponder is outlined.
Within this design, a ﬁeld effect transistor (FET) is used as
source for backscattering. A new transmission scheme for
TTF transponders is presented in [39]. The uplink is based
on asynchronous DS-CDMA. It is shown, by simulation,
that the proposed CDMA method outperforms the classical
RFID transmission in terms of channel capacity. Also, Gold
codes are used to separate the various RFID transponders.
Mutti and Floerkemeier [40] explore the chances how
CDMA methods can help to inventory large buildups of
transponders. A combination of slotted ALOHA and CDMA
is proposed to receive better inventory results. Therefore,
the CDMA method is only used at the moments when
the channel collides. Also, they show that Gold codes are
very suitable for the usage within RFID systems. Simulation
results show that Gold codes outperform Kasami codes.
A new anti-collision method is presented in [9] with the
goal to achieve a fast inventory process. A so called spread
partial-Q slot count algorithm which is based on slotted
ALOHA CDMA increases the overall throughput at the cost
of bandwidth and complexity.
Other algorithms are presented in [41], [42], where the
throughput is increased by using dynamic slotted ALOHA
CDMA algorithms with orthogonal variable spreading fac-
tors. Theoretic analysis and simulations show an increasing
performance regarding the identiﬁcation process. However,
the proposed algorithms perform different, when the condi-
tions of the RFID system changes. A better gain may only
be achieved, if the system itself is involved into the design
of the algorithms.
Another approach is described by Liu and Guo [4], that
uses Huffman spreading sequences to improve the process of
inventory. Therefore several performances have been com-
pared. Simulation results show the increase in performance
if proposed Huffman spreading sequences are used. Anyway,
a direct hardware implementation has to consider the various
states within the IQ constellation diagram to be imaged to
the backscatter modulator.
A minimum mean-squared error single user adaptive
receiver for the asynchronous DS-CDMA system, based on
the least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm is presented in [43].
The article states that the proposed algorithm achieves a
faster convergence rate than the transversal LMS algorithm.
Wuu et al. [44] presents a zero-collision scheme, that is
based on CDMA and hash-chain mechanisms. The results
of the paper show that with the applied techniques, not only
a zero-collision scheme, but also a secure channel may be
realized to outperform standard technologies. Anyway, the
authors assume, that CDMA can be implemented into RFID
systems, particularly RFID transponders.
Summing up, it can be stated, that the usage of CDMA
for RFID not only provides better system performance, but
also offers advanced security issues. Furthermore, very low
effort was put into the realization of such a CDMA-based
RFID system as such. Therefore, this missing piece is one
of the subjects of this work.

V. CDMA-BASED RFID SYSTEM
Within this section the basics of the proposed RFID sys-
tem are presented. Going into more detail, subsection V-A
shows the architecture of the Transmitting System, followed
by subsection V-B presenting the proposed semi-passive
RFID transponders and subsection V-C describing the Re-
ceiving System.
Figure 3 shows the basic architecture of the CDMA-
based RFID system. Generally, it consists, as any other
RFID system, too, of two major parts. First, the RFID
reader itself and second, one or more transponders. The big
difference between this system and other current systems
is the channel access method in the uplink (transponder to
reader communication) layer, in this case based on CDMA;
this fact is illustrated in Figure 3 showing every transponder
(Transponder 1 to Transponder n) with a unique spreading
code (Code 1 to Code n).
The basic working principle is also indicted in Figure 3,
showing the RFID reader with transmitting a sinusoidal
wave over its transmit antenna TX, thus allowing the various
transponders in the ﬁeld to modulate and reﬂect (principle
of backscatter) this incident wave back to the RFID reader.
Therefore, the total backscattered signal consists of the addi-
tive superposition of n (if multipath is negligible) backscat-
tered transponder signals with each transponder using its
own unique spreading code. Receiving this superimposed
signal over RX, the reader is, generally, able to separate
the various transponder signals from each other (process of
despreading) in order to restore the transponders’ data.
Figure 3 and Figure 5, respectively, show the concept and
the architecture of the realized RFID reader. The following

Architecture of CDMA-based RFID reader
A. Transmitting System
The proposed semi-passive UHF transponder works in
accordance with the principle of backscattering. The incident
wave to be backscattered is generated by the Transmit-
ting System. Considering the RFID uplink channel (tag to
reader), the introduced Transmitting System (see Figure 3
and Figure 5) consists of a PLL-based RF synthesizer
(Figure 3 and Figure 5) , generating a sine wave (here
with fcarrier = 866.5 MHz, maximum output power Pout =
1 dBm at 50 Ω), an upstream power ampliﬁer (PA, Gain
GP A = 20 dB, 1 dB compression point = 24 dBm), and a
linear polarized 50 Ω antenna (TX, Gain GT X ≈ 7 dBi). The
purpose of the transmitter is to generate an RF wave to be
reﬂected (backscattered) by the UHF transponder whereby
the reﬂected wave is received by the Receiving System
further discussed in subsection V-C.
It has to be mentioned that the RF synthesizer not only
generates a sine wave for the transmitting part, but also
for the receiving part of the system. Indeed, it is used as
local oscillator (LO) source for the downmixing part of the
receiver. However, both synthesized RF waves inherit the
same frequency as they are both created by the same PLL;
the waves only differ of π in phase.
B. Transponder
The major tasks of the semi-passive UHF transponders
are:
• Generate spreading code
• Create spreaded data

Concept of CDMA-based semi-passive UHF RFID transponder
Figure 6 shows the basic principle of an RFID transpon-
der. An incident RF wave is reﬂected by the transponder.
The phase and amplitude of the reﬂected wave is affected
by three major issues: The ﬁrst two issues are structural
mode and antenna mode scattering [45], [46], the third issue
is the multipath propagation. Multipath effects are a non-
changeable fact, so they can be neglected at this point. The
structural mode scattering of an antenna is dependent on the
structure of the antenna itself (material, antenna geometry,
etc.) and cannot be changed - therefore, the structural mode
may not be used for a normal data transmission. The antenna
mode scattering, on the other hand, describes the receiving
and emitting effects of an antenna, which usually depend
on the impedances used; particularly the impedance of the
antenna Zant itself and the corresponding load impedance
Zload of the following transponder system. Assuming that
Zload can adopt two values being Z1 and Z2. According
to Figure 6 the antenna mode scattering may be changed
by altering the load impedance Zload of the transponder’s
antenna according to the data the transponder wants to send.
Binary data may be send by altering Zload between Z1
and Z2, thus changing the reﬂection coefﬁcient between
Zant and Zload, which in turn leads to an alteration of the
reﬂection of the RF wave in phase and amplitude. Again,
this only affects the antenna mode scattering. However, the
total resulting backscattered signal is the superposition of the
multipath signal, the structural mode scattering and antenna
mode scattering effects. Measurements at the end of this
paper will show this effects.
Figure 7 shows the basic concept of the CDMA-based
semi-passive transponder. A central microcontroller gener-
ates the binary output data stream (i.e., the already coded
and spreaded user data) to drive the fast RF switch ’S’, that
alters between two impedance states Z1 and Z2; according
to the binary state of the output data stream, a logical ’1’
triggers Z2, a logical ’0’ triggers Z1 to be the corresponding
load impedance. Therefore, the data stream directly affects
the reﬂection coefﬁcient. The performance of the uplink
(tag to reader radio channel) depends very much on the
modulation efﬁciency ηmod of the backscatter modulator
[47]–[49], which basic calculation is subject of the following
paragraph.
1) Determining Load Impedances: Assuming an antenna
with complex antenna impedance
Zant = Ra + j Xa
(4)
with Ra = Rr+Rl as the sum of radiation resistance Rr and
real antenna losses Rl, and Xa as the imaginary part of the
antenna impedance. The complex reﬂection coefﬁcients Γ1,2
between the antenna impedance and the load impedances
Z1,2 can be described as
Γ1,2 = Z1,2 − Z∗
ant
Z1,2 + Zant

with U0 as the antenna’s open circuit voltage and a being

and Γ2 is maximum. Supposing two vectors (Γ1 and Γ2)
in a complex coordinate system, the maximum difference
between both vectors is achieved at the point when the phase

absolute value of any Γ is limited to 1. That determines the

(13)
The antenna designed for the RFID transponders is a
50 Ω patch antenna (Figure 9). Therefore the imaginary
part (within the speciﬁed frequency range) Xa ≈ 0. This
determines Z2 = −jXa ≈ 0. A load impedance of Z1 = ∞
corresponds to an open circuit wheres Z2 = 0 corresponds
to a short circuit. Choosing open and short circuit states as
desired load impedances, the maximum achievable modula-
tion efﬁciency is, according to Equation (7), determined to
be
ηmod = 2
π2 |+1 + 1|2 = 8
π2 ≈ 81%
(14)
. In order to have the maximum modulation efﬁciency for
the CDMA-based RFID system, the load impedances of the
realized semi-passive transponders are set to open and short
circuit. By choosing these values as load impedances, one
has to keep in mind, that this is only advisable for semi-
passive UHF RFID transponders. If passive transponders are
designed, one has to consider the power consumption into
its calculations. Therefore, open and short circuit values are
not suitable, as the backscattered power is, in fact, too high,
as the transponder needs a large portion of the incoming
power for supplying itself [51].
2) Transponder Basics: Figure 8 illustrates the concept
of the transponder and Figure 9 shows one of the realized
transponders to achieve the previously mentioned tasks. The
microcontroller (µC) is powered by a power supply and
may be user-controlled using USB or pushbuttons. The µC
generates the unique spreading code and subsequently, the
spreaded outgoing data. The data are forwarded to the SPI
interface to drive the modulator of the transponder with
different input voltages to adjust different load impedances
respectively reﬂection coefﬁcients of the modulator. The
block diagram of the modulator (Figure 7) shows the
principle of the proposed simple backscatter modulator. An
example on how to design load modulators can be found
in [52]. However, the incoming spreaded data stream is
low-pass ﬁltered to limit the outgoing bandwidth. As the
modulator should be as simple as possible, an RF switch
’S’ forms the interface between the logic data and the
backscattered HF wave. The inputs of the switch are driven
by the spreaded data stream with two voltage levels (0
and 2.75 V) given by a buffer driver. One connection of
the switch is linked to the patch antenna’s microstrip line
(50 Ω); the ground connection is linked to the patch antennas
ground plane. By triggering the switch’s input with the
spreaded data to be sent, either Z1 or Z2 is connected to
the antenna. This modiﬁcation changes in turn the reﬂection
of an incident electromagnetic wave. The difference of phase
and amplitude of the reﬂection is a direct indicator for
the efﬁciency of a backscattering modulator. As mentioned
above the modulators load impedances are set to open and
short circuit to achieve maximum modulation efﬁciency. An
exemplary spectral extract of the backscattered output of the
transponder, measured at the receiving antenna, is given in
Figure 16. On closer inspection, one can see the spreaded
data (chip rate is 1.5 Mcps) around the carrier frequency
(866.5 MHz). As these data signal levels (P ≈ -90 dBm ±
10 dB) are not very high, an accurate implementation of the
receiving system becomes necessary.
For a limited downlink (reader to tag) capability the
transponders are equipped with a module for measuring
the ﬁeld strength (RSSI) and a module for measuring the
frequency (RF Divider) of the incident RF wave emitted by
the reader. The RF Divider is currently used to indicate the
transponder to send its data as soon as a carrier between
865 MHz and 868 MHz is detected. The RSSI module is
used for statistical measurements. Anyway, both modules
are not part of this work.

3) Modulator: The transponder’s modulator is one of
the key components of the system. Usually, it effects the
energy supply (only for passive working transponders) and
the modulation efﬁciency (for passive and semi-passive
working transponders) of transponders. Therefore, it has a
direct effect for the maximum achievable range of such a
system. The principle of the modulator has been already
discussed above, so that this paragraph focuses primarily

on the realization. Figure 10 shows the modulator, with
and without RF shielding. The left part of the modulator
is connected to the transponder’s base board, the right SMA
plug to the patch antenna as shown in Figure 9. The part
within the RF shielding is responsible for the backscattering
effects. A part of the incident RF wave is fed into the
modulator. The part depends on the antenna (structural
and antenna mode) and the reﬂection coefﬁcient between
antenna impedance Zant and the load impedance Zload of
the connected modulator. This part is fed into the RF switch
and the load impedance (either Z1 or Z2), which corresponds
to the current state of the switch. The state of the switch is
deﬁned by a buffered microcontroller output. which itself
shows the current voltage of the binary data stream to be
sent. In the case of Z1 (open circuit state), the incident
wave is entirely reﬂected with no phase shift. State Z2 (short
circuit) also corresponds to a total reﬂection, but with a
phase shift of 180◦.
Measuring the load impedances of the modulator show a
very good accordance with the theoretical results. Figure 11
shows the reﬂection coefﬁcients within a Smith chart. As
one can see the phase difference is not exactly π. Z2 (short
circuit) has nearly short circuit properties; Z2 (open circuit)
has nearly open circuit properties. The frequency range of
the measurement was between 852 MHz and 882 MHz.

systems. Gold codes seem to be one of the best codes to be
used in UHF RFID systems. Mutti and Floerkemeier [40],
for instance, state that Gold codes outperform Kasami codes.
Moreover, one Gold code family contains a large number of
unique codes, which provides a high probability of ﬁnding
a well-suited set of codes for a system to be designed.
Gold codes, ﬁrst introduced by Robert Gold [53], are
commonly used in spread spectrum systems, such as WLAN
and UMTS as well as in GPS (C/A code). The generation of
Gold codes is quite simple as only two linear feedback shift
registers (LFSR) are necessary to create one set of codes.
134

Other advantages of Gold code are:
• Good balance between auto- and cross-correlation
• Flexibility in code length
• No user synchronization necessary, i.e. the transponders
need not to be synchronized among each other
Because of above mentioned advantages, the proposed
CDMA-based system uses Gold sequences.
However, Gold codes have a length of 2m − 1 with
m being the order of each linear feedback shift register.
For reasons of ﬂexibility a Gold code generator has been
implemented on the transponder’s 32 bit µC. The choice fell
upon a Gold code length of 127 (m = 7). The characteristic
polynomial is 137dec for the ﬁrst LFSR and 143dec for the
second one. The initial value for the ﬁrst LFSR is 85dec. By
choosing two Gold codes (Code 1 and Code 2) the second
LFSR is initialized with 127dec for the ﬁrst and with 111dec
for the second code. Then, a small adjustment was made
to the generated Gold codes to be more compatible to the
µC. A succeeding binary ’0’ is added to each code to move
it to a length of 128 bit. To show the effect of this ’0’,
the auto-correlation function (ACF) and cross-correlation
function (CCF) have been evaluated for both Codes.
Figure 12 shows the ACF Φcc of the original 127 bit Gold
codes. Figure 13 illustrates the ACF Φcc(τ) of the adjusted
(127+1 bit) Gold codes. The results are slightly higher
values beyond the peak value at τ = 0. As not only the
auto-correlation counts, the corresponding cross-correlation
Φ12(τ) between the two codes are presented in Figure 14.
As expected the values of the adjusted codes are slightly
higher compared to the original ones, but without loosing
the typical noise-like character. This means, that the effect
of the added ’0’ is negligible for further considerations.
However, ﬁnal system implementations have to consider
that fact.
C. Receiving System
The major tasks of the Receiving system are:
• Receive incoming signals from several transponders,
i.e., downmixing, analog baseband processing and A/D
conversion
• Find separate data streams (transponders) by despread-
ing, demodulating and decoding the signals
The Receiving system mainly consists of a hardware part that
is needed to mix down the backscattered RF signal, centered
at fc = 866.5 MHz, into baseband, despread, demodulate,
and decode the baseband signal in order to determine the
transponders’ data. Figure 15 presents the structure of this
receiving part of the RFID reader. The incoming RF signal
is caught by a receiving antenna (RX) and ampliﬁed by a
following low noise ampliﬁer (LNA). A subsequent Zero-
IF IQ-Demodulator mixes down the RF signal directly to
baseband. The output of the demodulator consists of differ-
ential I- and Q-signals, which are band-pass ﬁltered, twice

ampliﬁed and active low-pass ﬁltered. It has to mentioned
that the IQ signals are completely handled differentially
throughout the ampliﬁer and ﬁlter stages to keep the signal-
to-noise ratio (SNR) at a high level. The succeeding Analog-
to-Digital conversion (ADC) module samples both, the I-
and Q-signal, simultaneously. The A/D converted signals are
fed into a digital signal processor (DSP) block with a data
rate of 450 Mbps (Sampling of 2 channels with each channel
having a resolution of 15 bit (14 data + 1 status bit) including
a sampling rate of 15 Msps). The DSP module despreads,
demodulates and decodes this data stream. The results are
the user data of each recognized transponder.
The following paragraphs focus on the details of the
receiving system.
1) Demodulator: The incoming low-noise ampliﬁed sig-
nal is fed into the demodulator. The demodulator uses
the second RF synthesizer signal (the ﬁrst is used as RF
signal source for the transmit path, see above) as local
oscillator (LO) source, to mix down the RF signal directly
into baseband (Zero-IF). The demodulator is based on
the LT5575 chip [54] from Linear Technology and 50 Ω-
matched between 865 MHz and 868 MHz. The output of
the demodulator is differential with 2 I- and 2 Q-signals,
respectively.
2) Band-Pass Filter: The differential working band-pass
ﬁlter, which succeeds the demodulator, is used to suppress
the DC-part of the baseband signal, i.e. mainly the non-
information carrying down-mixed carrier signal, and high-
frequency disturbing signals (from the internal mixer of the
demodulator). Therefore the passband is set between 16 kHz
and 20 MHz.
3) Ampliﬁer Stage:
The following ampliﬁer stage is
build upon two differential ampliﬁers (LTC6421-20 [55] and
LTC6420-20 [56]), each with a differential voltage gain of
10 V/V.
4) Active Anti-Aliasing Filter: The last analog signal
processing stage is an active anti-aliasing ﬁlter for the
succeeding ADC module. The cut-off frequency of the 4th
order low-pass ﬁlter (Chebyshev characteristic) is currently
set to 2.5 MHz. This stage is based on LT6604-2.5 [57] from
Linear Technology.
5) A/D Conversion:
One very important part of the
receiving system is a well-designed A/D conversion stage
for the baseband signal. The subjective of the ADC module
is a time synchron sampling of the differential I- and Q-
signals. The module is based on a dual A/D converter of
type AD9248 from Analog Devices [58]. Two channels may
be sampled synchronously with a resolution of 14 bit per
channel. Maximum sampling rate is 40 Msps. As the fast
parallel input of the succeeding DSP module has only 20
bit the internal multiplexer of the A/D converter is used to
transmit the I- and Q-data after each other. Therefore one
status bit is used to indicate the current transmitted channel
data. Here, the A/D converter is driven with 15 Msps per
channel, which corresponds to an overall sampling clock rate
of 30 MHz. The 14 bit per channel plus the status bit and
the sampling rate, generate in total a data rate of 450 Mbps
to be handled by the subsequent DSP module.
6) DSP Module: The purpose of the DSP is the handling
of all calculations, necessary to evaluate the transponders’
user data. Therefore, the following stages are necessary:
• Data acquisition (from ADC module)
• Despreading of baseband signals
• Demodulation of despreaded signals
• Decoding of demodulated data
The following paragraphs give a short introduction to these
topics. The data acquisition phase has to be accomplished
only once, against what the following stages have to be
passed through by every transponder respectively spreading
code available.
Data Acquisition: As the amount of data to handle is
quit large (450 Mbps) the data streams are not handled in
real time. However, through the usage of this DSP (ADSP-
21469 from Analog Devices [59]) the processing speed is
quite high. The A/D converted data signals are acquired
through the DSP’s PDAP (Parallel Data Aquisition Port)
interface. From there, they are transfered to an internal 8x32
bit buffer. Finally, the data are passed via DMA access to
an internal memory. As of limited memory capabilities the
136
International Journal on Advances in Telecommunications, vol 4 no 1 & 2, year 2011, http://www.iariajournals.org/telecommunications/
2011, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org

data is transferred block-wise to the external memory. As
the sampled values are stored as 32 bit values (DWORD),
the amount of data for one shot (duration is Tshot ≈ 188 µs)
is 90112 samples per channel, so in total 720896 bytes or
704 kbytes.
Despreading: The process of despreading is the most
calculation intensive operation the DSP has to handle. As
this phase needs more time than the data acquisition process
the system is, up-to-date not able to work real-time. Parallel
processing would be a good solution. The DSP itself has a
clock rate of 450 MHz.
Despreading data from the baseband signal has to be done
for I- and Q-channel separately. The despreading operation
is realized using the cross-correlation between I and Q
signals and the origin codes used by every transponder
in the ﬁeld. If s[k] is the I or Q signal and c[k] one
of the corresponding codes of one of the transponders,
the cross-correlation Φs,c(τ) between these signals is done
by multiplying every time instance signal s with code c.
Equation (15) shows the corresponding relationship between
c[k] and s[k]
[s ⋆ c][τ] = Φs,c(τ) =
+∞
X
t=−∞
s∗[t] · c[τ + t]
(15)
A code length of 128 chips corresponds to 1280 sam-
ples (Rchip = 1.5 Msps and Rsample = 15 Msps) and
90112 samples per channel for I and Q. This results into
230,686,720 multiplications and 180,224 additions.
One goal was to reduce this high amount of operations.
This is realized through estimation of the time moments the
chips appear within the IQ signals. This estimation method
works as follows. The IQ baseband signal is sampled and
correlated among the ﬁrst 2 · 1280 = 2560 samples. This
results in 6,553,600 multiplications and 5120 additions. The
ﬁrst maximum, corresponding to the ﬁrst peak indicates
the initial index i0 to start the despreading process. The
following peaks are estimated by jumping from i0, 1280
samples ahead. As certain incertitudes (oscillators, etc.)
will lead to synchronization errors, the correlation is not
only made at sample index i0 + n · 1280, but at 5 samples
before and after the estimated time index. That means, the
second peak is determined by executing the cross-correlation
Φi,1(τ) as given in Equation (16).
Φi,1(τ) =
i0+1280+5
X
t=i0+1280−5
s∗[t] · c[τ + t]
(16)
The result is 11 correlations per peak and a new synchro-
nization index, as the new peak indicates the next starting
point for the succeeding peak estimation. With 70 data peaks
within one shot and 1 within the initial guess, the total
number of correlations per channel is 2560+69 · 11 = 3319.
This leads to 8,496,640 multiplications and 6,638 additions
in total for both channels. This is only 3.6% of the full
correlation.
Demodulation: The process of demodulation inherits
the merge of the I and Q signals. According to their signal
quality, estimated through the maximum correlation values,
the signals are weighted and superimposed. This process of
demodulation is beyond this paper’s scope and not further
described.
Decoding User Data: The demodulated signal stream is
Manchester coded [1] and needs to be decoded accordingly.
The resulting data stream corresponds to the transponder’s
respectively the user data.

VI. MEASUREMENTS
This section presents measurements of various parts of the
system, including transponder, analog baseband processing
and DSP.
A. Transponder Measurements
Figure 16 shows the spectrum of the backscattered
transponder signals. For this measurement an RF signal
(PT X = 10 dBm, fcarrier = 866.5 MHz) is fed into the linear
polarized transmit antenna. One transponder is placed at
a distance of 1, 2 and 3 m. The resulting reﬂected signal
spectrum after the receiving antenna is shown in Figure 16.
As expected, the backscattered signal parts drop with
increasing distance from the reader’s antennas.
The IQ constellation diagrams of the received RF signal
are shown throughout Figure 17 to Figure 19. It can
be shown that the backscattered signals show a mixture
between ASK and PSK modulation. For instance, as in
Figure 17, the mean of the data points (from the two
states of the one transponder) is not the origin (0,0).
This discrepancy is the effect of multipath and structural
antenna mode scattering. Same applies for Figure 18 with
2 transponders, generating 22 = 4 constellation points,
and Figure 19 with 3 transponders, generating 23 = 8
constellation points. The number of constellation points for
n transponders is 2n because all n transponders have 2
states sharing the same coherent RF signal from the reader.
However, as expected the transponders show a near exact

B. RX Measurements
Two measurements have been carried out to show the
basic working principle of the analog baseband processing
module. The goal of this module is the signal conditioning
for the succeeding ADC module. Figure 20 shows the output
of the demodulator, i.e. the I- and Q-signals. As mentioned
above these signals are handled differentially (I+, I−, Q+
and Q−). To simplify matters the differential signals have
been put together (I = I+ − I− and Q = Q+ − Q−)
. The signals are ampliﬁed and ﬁltered with a resulting
signal as shown in Figure 21. The signals were recorded
with 2 transponders in the ﬁeld. As in the IQ measurements
before, 2 transponders generate 22 = 4 different signal levels
(evaluated from Figure 21):

C. DSP Measurements
The DSP module comes with some debugging function-
alities. One of these functionalities is able to provide the
DSP values, from its internal or external memories, via USB
to a host PC. Figure 22 shows the results of a full cross-
correlation. For simplicity the CCFs have been normalized
to one. The values show the maximum number of samples
(90112) and the peaks, with each peak describing a bit. The
value of the bit may be positive (+1) or negative (−1).
The difference between the peaks and the noise ﬂoor is an
indicator for the quality of the communication link.

Cross-correlation of signals with origin spreading codes -
Process of despreading / 2 Transponders
VII. RESULTS
According to the measurements the proposed system
worked as expected. It was proved that the UHF RFID
system for broadcasting information data using a CDMA
method worked out very good. During the experiments there
was a maximum distance to the antennas being around 15 m.
The transmitted RF-power at 866.5 MHz was 20 dBm. The
introduced transponders are semi-passive, which means that
the communication link is still passive, whereas the data
generation (on the transponder’s side) is active, driven by
3.3 V power supplies.
Smaller problems arose, when various transponder had a
different path length to the antennas. In that case one
transponder (the nearest) dominated the second transponder
(more far away) which often occurred to a non-detection of
transponder two. This problem is known in CDMA systems
and is referred to as near-far problem [60]. One possibility to
reduce the near-far effect is the usage of Huffman sequences
[4]. But this approach asks for more than 2 states of the load
impedance of the transponder’s modulator. Nevertheless,
carried out indoor experiments showed that the near-far
effect of the proposed system is, in fact, very low.
Also, theoretical work, which states an advantage of
CDMA-based RFID systems compared to state-of-the-art
RFID systems based on TDMA methods, complies with the
measured results of the proposed CDMA-based UHF RFID
system.
VIII. CONCLUSION
This article presented a realization of a CDMA-based
RFID system working in the UHF region. The system
itself is build upon a Transmitting system providing a
continuous electromagnetic wave. This emitted RF carrier
is backscattered through one or more designed UHF tags.
Each of these semi-passive operating transponders generate
a unique spreading sequence. The proposed spreading se-
quences are Gold codes providing a good orthogonality. A
simple modulator on the transponder generates the desired
backscatter signal. The Receiving system captures this signal
by down mixing the RF signal to baseband. Further analog
signal processing and subsequent A/D conversion gives the
DSP the chance to despread, demodulate and decode the
desired transponder signals.
The signiﬁcant advantage of such a structure compared to
present systems lies in the ability to avoid particular TDMA-
based anti-collision schemes. This, indeed, will lead to less
time needed for inventorizing RFID tags, as this can be
achieved within one time slot. Topics for future research
are, regarding the receiver side, the need for much more
computational resources (RAKE receiver, [61]) and the near-
far problem, CDMA-based systems have to deal with.
