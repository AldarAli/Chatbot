Abstract—A good design of node location is critical for efficient 
and effective wireless communications. This paper presents an 
improved algorithm, in order to solve the low localization 
accuracy caused by traditional centroid algorithm. The 
improved algorithm combined with VIRE system and 
traditional centroid algorithm. The VIRE algorithm is 
introduced and the signal propagation model is utilized to 
construct virtual reference tags in the location area. Simulation 
shows that this further developed algorithm has further 
improved the accuracy of positioning up to 35.12% compared 
to the traditional centroid algorithm. It is concluded that this 
algorithm can further improve the locating accuracy in 
comparison with the original centroid algorithm.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Node localization is one of the core technologies in 
Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) [1]. Currently, the 
localization algorithm of wireless sensor network can be 
divided into two categories: the distance-independence [2] 
and distance-dependence [3].   
The common positioning algorithms of distance-
independence are centroid algorithm and Approximate Point-
In-triangulation Test (APIT) [4, 5]. Bulusu et al. [4] 
introduced a node positioning technology-centroid algorithm 
that has a lower computational complexity than that of the 
trilateration [5]. The positioning algorithm, such as Received 
Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), of distance-dependence has 
better accuracy, but the survival of the network is stronger 
when the unknown node has not had a high positioning 
accuracy.  
In order to improve the accuracy of centroid localization, 
this paper proposes a modified algorithm similar to the 
Virtual Reference Elimination (VIRE) algorithm [6]. This 
modified algorithm uses the signal propagation model [7] to 
construct the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) [8] 
information of virtual reference tags in location area and 
locates the object using traditional centroid algorithm. The 
VIRE realizes accurate position using a linear interpolation 
algorithm with adding a grid virtual reference tags based on 
the LANDMARC [9] algorithm.  
To reduce the redundant calculation of VIRE algorithm, 
Shi et al. [10] used Subregion Selection (SRS) mechanism to 
reduce the interpolation area, and a nonlinear interpolation 
algorithm to calculate the RSSI values of virtual reference 
tags. Nevertheless, the location accuracy is affected by 
dividing areas [10].  
To solve the above problem, this paper proposes an 
improved algorithm that combines with VIRE system and 
the original centroid algorithm according to the VIRE 
algorithm and the RSSI information of virtual reference tags 
that are established by signal transmission model in the 
location area. The simulation results show that the algorithm 
can further improve the locating accuracy without any 
additional hardware overhead in comparison with the 
original centroid algorithm. 
The rest of the paper will be organized as follows. 
Section II will describe RSSI location, VIRE disposing and 
transmission model of wireless signal. Section III will 
describe the detailed research approach. Section IV will 
describe the experiments and error analysis. Finally, Section 
V will draw the conclusion and future work.

RELATED  WORK  
A. Ranging methods 
According to the physical medium, there are four 
popularly ranging methods in the signal communications of 
sensor systems: 1) the RSSI (Received Signal Strength 
Indicator) [8], 2) the TOA (Time Of Arrival) [11], 3) the 
TDOA (Time Difference Of Arrival) [12], and 4) the AOA 
(Angle Of Arrival) [13]. The performance comparison of 
four ranging methods is shown in Table I.

TABLE I. THE COMPARISON OF RANGING METHOD BASED ON 
DISTANCE 
 
 
The TOA algorithm requires GPS-assisted equipment, 
which is not used in the indoor environment [16]. Ultrasonic 
transmission distance is limited, which is usually less than 10 
meters, affected by angle, temperature, and obstructions [17]. 
The AOA is reliable only in the line of sight signal dominant 
circumstances [18]. It follows that these limitations of three 
positioning methods lead to an extreme difficulty in dealing 
with the complex indoor environments. The RSSI-based 
ranging method has the advantages of long transmission 
distance, lower cost, lower power consumption, easy node 
hardware, small size, and light weight [19]. However, the 
positioning accuracy of RSSI based methods is low, as it can 
only be used as a rough ranging method [19]. Thus, its 
positioning accuracy must be improved by an adjunct way. 
B. Transmission model of wireless signal  
The Received Signal Strength Indictor (RSSI) converts 
the loss during the process of transmission according to the 
signal intensity of transmitting and node received [14]. In the 
indoor location, the RSSI ranging signal propagation model 
can be simplified as (1) in consideration of environmental, 
cost, location accuracy requirements and other factors:

III. 
RESEARCH APPROACH 
The approach is designed in two phases: first, the system 
structure and the algorithm based on virtual tags; second, the 
realization of algorithm in VIRE system. 
A. System structure and algorithm based on virtual tags 
1)  Construction of VIRE system (VIRE disposing) 
‘Virtual Reference Elimination’ (VIRE) is introduced in 
[6]. In the VIRE, instead of deploying many real reference 
RFID tags, the concept of virtual reference tags is provided 
as denser reference coverage in the sensing areas. 
The distribution of VIRE reader

R and reference tags,
aT, 
bT , 
cT  and 
dT  are shown in Figure 1 with  relationship, 
a,b,c,d∈N+
. The object tags are in the range of specified area. 
The core of VIRE method is related to 4 reference tags as a 
unit grid: N1xN1, shown in Figure 2.

intensity of reference tags and virtual reference tags, 
LANDMARC algorithm is normally used to select a certain 
threshold for solving the nearest reference tag weights, in 
order to obtain positioning results [10]. 
According to the VIRE system, this paper gives a further 
development of the positioning method.

THE SIMULATION AND ERROR ANALYSIS 
In the simulation experiment, Matlab7.6.0 software is 
used. There are two indicators of size set up and the 
positioning accuracy is set as the evaluation criteria, when 
the positioning precision, scale, network coverage rate, and 
power consumption are often used as the evaluation index in 
the WSN. In the simulation experiment, the WSN area is set 
that the S and T are equal to 90. The reference tags are 
located at the four vertices of this area and uniformly 
distributed. The positioning error of the object nodes is 
defined in (11):

A. Searching the optimum number of the virtual reference 
tags 
As shown in Table IV, ten object nodes’ RSSI are from 
the reader
iR
, where i is shown as 1, 2, 3, 4.
  
TABLE IV OBJECT NODES’S RSSI 
 
 
When the number of the virtual reference tags increases, 
the error in comparison with the two algorithms are 
illustrated in Figures 6 and 7. 
Figure 6 shows that there is no obvious change between 
the two algorithms, if the number of the virtual reference 
tags is above 121 and the 90/N2 is greater than 10. The best 
performance shows that the number of the virtual reference 
tags is 49 when 90/N2 is equal to 6. It follows that the 
renewed centroid algorithm could further improve the 
accuracy compared with the traditional centroid algorithm.

B. Comparison of the two algorithms when the number of

Figure 8 shows that the results are obtained by (5) from 
the test for 100 times. It is clear that the renewed centroid 
algorithm gets a further improved localization accuracy 
compared with the traditional one.

C. Error analysis 
For the virtual reference tags, they may not be able to 
choose four ones near the object node, or four virtual 
reference tags are repeatedly chosen, as it may lead to 
excessive error(s). In the radio propagation model, the signal 
is disturbed by the external environment instead of being 
transmitted in free space. Through repeated measurements 
and the statistical average value, some error can be reduced, 
although the further improvement is still needed. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
A. Achievements 
One of the hot topics in WSN is localization of the object 
node. The paper proposes an improved centroid algorithm 
combined with the VIRE system. The algorithm is simple. 
The positioning accuracy of the object nodes has been 
improved significantly in comparison with the traditional 
centroid algorithm. This new algorithm can be used to solve 
the problem of the low localization accuracy of the 
traditional centroid algorithm.

B. Future work 
However, there are still some shortcomings existing in 
the positioning methods. On one hand, the signal 
propagation model applicable to non-free-space conditions 
needs further research. On the other hand, the selection 
methods of the virtual reference tags need further 
optimization so as to further improve the positioning 
accuracy.
