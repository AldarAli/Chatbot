Abstract— In recent years, there has been a huge interest in 
Machine-to-Machine connectivity under the umbrella of 
Internet of Things (IoT). With the UK Government looking to 
trial autonomous (driverless) cars this year, connected vehicles 
will play a key part in improving and managing existing road 
safety and congestion, leading to a new generation of intelligent 
transport systems. This is also well aligned to the current 
initiatives by the automotive industry to improve the driver’s 
experience on-board. However, the wireless channels most 
suitable for this application have not been standardized. In this 
paper, we review the wireless channels suitable for vehicle-2-
vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle–to-x (V2x) connectivity.  We further 
present preliminary analysis on the factors that impact the 
Quality of Service (QoS) of connected vehicles. We use the 
open access GEMV2 data to carry out Analysis of Variance 
(ANOVA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the 
link quality and found that both line of sight and non line of 
sight has a significant impact on the link quality. The work 
presented here will help in the development of connected 
vehicle network (CVN) prediction model and control for V2V 
and V2x connectivity. It will further contribute towards 
unfolding and testing key research questions in the context of 
connected vehicles which may otherwise be overlooked.

 INTRODUCTION  
Improving road safety and traffic management on 
existing infrastructure has huge societal and economic 
impacts. While users’ perception of vehicular experience is 
fast evolving, existing transport infrastructure is still playing 
catch up. There is a disadvantage in using proprietary 
wireless standard as it limits customizability due to the lack 
of open source movement. Therefore, standardization of 
wireless channels is a first step to addressing this challenge 
as it allows for interoperability and user multiplier effect. 
The availability and presence of wireless communications 
and connectivity in vehicles is shaping customers’ on-board 
experience. In the same manner that mobile phones have 
evolved in the last ten years, vehicles are evolving with 
some form of vehicle-2-vehicle (V2V) connectivity. 
According to a market research report, connected vehicles 
will be worth $46.69 billion by 2020 [1]. Connected 
vehicles are defined as a set of moving networked computer 
systems with dozens of electronic control units (ECUs), 
hundreds of sensors and million lines of code [2]. Research 
investigating the suitability of wireless channels is a 
significant starting point to them becoming a reality in the 
near future [3][4]. The benefits of V2V connectivity 
especially in areas of collision avoidance and congestion 
management are huge, V2V is becoming a reality and 
automobile 
industry 
is 
currently 
working 
towards 
standardization. 
A number of developed countries are trialling 
autonomous cars on the roads in the near future. Google’s 
cars have driven 1.2 million miles in USA, with Germany, 
China and the UK [5], also looking to open trials. 
Connected vehicles will play a key part in traffic 
management of autonomous cars. Within the next five years 
there will be some form of autonomous driving on UK 
roads. It is therefore important to investigate the best 
wireless channels in this application so as to fully 
understand the challenges and be able to address them 
effectively. This will also help towards the modelling of 
wireless channels for connected vehicles.  
A number of researchers have presented findings both 
on technique [6] and a network model [7]. Petri nets are 
proposed in [6] for such time critical distributed 
communication and control systems. GEMV2, a geometry-
based V2V channel model has been presented in [7], which 
measures link quality by factoring outlines of vehicles, 
buildings, and foliage to distinguish between the three types 
of links; the links are Line of Sight (LOS), Non-LOS due to 
vehicles and Non-LOS (NLOS) due to static objects. In 
addition, the link quality is calculated with the large-scale 
signal variation deterministically and the small scale-signal 
variation stochastically based on the number and size of 
surrounding objects. GEMV2 is freely available to be used 
by researchers. 
 The objective of this paper is to identify and present 
those challenges and opportunities associated with Quality 
of Service (QoS) in connected vehicles and to identify the 
modelling direction for Connected Vehicle Network (CVN) 
by conducting Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the factors that 
impact link quality.  Here, we define CVN as the network 
between V2V and V2x and where the position and /velocity 
of the vehicle is predicted from the previous vehicle/x. The 
‘x’ 
in 
V2x 
represents 
vehicle/infrastructure/roadside 
sensors/anything else deemed suitable. The vision for CVN 
is that each vehicle on the road will be able to communicate 
with other vehicles and this set of data and communication

will support a new generation of active safety applications 
and systems [8]. Wireless technologies and their potential 
challenges in providing vehicle-to-x connectivity are 
presented in [4]. An overview of applications and associated 
requirements of vehicular networks are presented in [9]. 
Internet mobility in vehicular scenarios along with their 
challenges is presented in [10]. With ever increasing 
connectivity and a vision that migrates towards smart cities, 
security issues and the challenges such as propriety 
networks, inter-operability between networks, etc. therein 
are immense. Work in [11] presents some of the security 
challenges in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET), whereas 
[12] focuses on the four working groups on scientific 
foundations of vehicular networking and presents their 
findings. Connected Vehicle Network is modelled using a 
black-box approach that comprises of vehicles with wireless 
V2V communication using link length estimator to identify 
the number of vehicles in the network [13], whereas [14] 
presented modelling of future state of a vehicle in a platoon 
based on preceding vehicle position and velocity.  
In this paper, we use the data from GEMV2 to carry out 
ANOVA and PCA. Doing so, helps us to better understand 
the QoS relationship between the link quality and the factors 
that impact it. We chose four factors that impact link quality 
as LOS, NLOS, number of neighbours per vehicle and the 
neigh-thresh per vehicle. The parameters are described in 
Section III.   
The work presented in this paper differs from the ones 
listed above since it provides an in depth analysis on the 
various wireless channels available for connected vehicles 
based on our QoS assessment of the GEMV2 data. 
Therefore, the contributions of the paper are two-fold: 
• to present an overview of wireless channel 
requirements in connected vehicles. 
• to present ANOVA and PCA on GEMV2 data to 
understand the impact of line of sight, non line 
of sight, neighbours and neigh-thresh per vehicle 
on link quality. This enables us to present our 
modelling directions for CVN. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
gives an overview of the connected vehicle channel 
requirements. Section III describes the QoS assessment on 
GEMV2 data, whereas Section IV discusses the research 
directions for CVN modelling. Conclusions and future work 
is presented in Section V.

CONNECTED VEHICLES CHANNEL REQUIREMENTS: 
AN OVERVIEW 
The concept diagram of connected vehicles is presented 
in Figure 1, which illustrates V2V and V2x connectivity 
using various access networks which is in turn connected to 
the core network. The concept behind Figure 1 is that 
connected vehicles will be able to communicate with each 
other and with an intelligent transport system (ITS) using 
different wireless channels such as Wi-Fi, 4G/LTE, etc. QoS 
in such application will be critical as vehicles come out of 
one network into the other especially at handover points.  
Connected vehicles are the building blocks of emerging 
Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and Network of Things (NoT) 
[15], which is defined on five primitives as sensors, 
aggregator, communication channel, external utility and 
decision trigger. All vehicles or ‘x’ will have sensors 
connected that will be able to transmit/receive ‘useful’ 
information. This information is converted by an aggregator, 
defined as a mathematical function implemented in software 
that transforms raw data into some ‘useful’ meaning. This is 
underpinned by the communication channel, e.g., WiFi, 4G, 
etc. The external utility can be a software/hardware and will 
execute processes into the overall workflow of NoT. 
Finally, the decision trigger creates the final result needed to 
satisfy the requirements of NoT.    
 
Figure 1. V2V and V2x concept diagram 
The ITS reference architecture from [16] has been 
adapted and is presented in Figure 2. It is a protocol stack 
inspired from the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) 
model and defines three layers as ‘access’, which will 
support the wireless access networks/wireless channels, a 
network & transport layer which supports the routing 
protocols, data transfer, etc. Above it sits the facilities layer 
which will support the application/information. Here, we 
define the position/velocity of the vehicle in this layer. The 
layers of application, management and security run across 
both horizontally and vertically and provides cross layer 
commands and information.  
A number of applications ranging from infotainment, for 
example, media downloading to traffic safety applications, 
such as driving assistance co-operative awareness impose 
diverse requirements on supporting vehicular networking 
technologies. There will be a huge emphasis on inter-
networking between the different standards in order to 
achieve seamless communications.  In addition, there are 
different requirements for inter-vehicle (V2V or V2x) and 
intra-vehicles networks. Intra-vehicle is defined as all the 
ECUs within the vehicle communicating to the driver and 
includes infotainment. Hence, all the wireless channels 
described in this section may play a role in the connected 
vehicle application. Therefore, this section provides an 
overview on the wireless channels available and the 
connectivity challenges required in a V2V or V2x 
communication type.

A. DSRC/Wave 
Dedicated short-range communications with wireless 
access in vehicular environments (DSRC/WAVE) as 
defined by IEEE 802.11p and IEEE1609 (higher layer 
standard based on IEEE 802.11p) is a key enabling wireless 
technology for both V2V and V2R communications. DSRC 
works in 5.9GHz band with a bandwidth of 75MHz in the 
US and 30MHz in Europe and an approximate range of 
1000m. It is designed for both one way and two way 
communication. DSRC are not compatible in Europe, Japan 
and US. Currently, DSRC is the default broadcast 
communication protocol used. Some limitation of DSRC 
includes its dedicated spectrum in supporting V2V 
communication type [17] and lack of QoS support. Key 
application for DSRC is roadside sensors which transmit 
information about hazardous conditions, road surface and 
distance between vehicles and anti-collision information. 
B. Zigbee 
Zigbee is based on IEEE 802.15.4 specification intended 
for wireless personal area network applications with low 
power and cost. Zigbee also has applications in V2R 
connectivity 
where 
the 
moving 
vehicle 
exchanges 
information with the roadside sensors [18]. The Zigbee 
enabled roadside sensors then updates traffic status to an 
intelligent control system seamlessly. It also has application 
in intra-vehicle networking where a small wireless sensor 
network is established between the sensors. 
C. Visible Light Communication (VLC) 
The use of visible light communication (VLC) for V2R 
communication is proposed in [19].  VLC is defined by 
IEEE 802.15.7 standard and can support data rate up to 
96Mb/s through fast modulation of LED light sources [19]. 
It is an emerging area of research given the possibility of 
augmenting existing infrastructure such as traffic lights. 
However, one key limitation of VLC is any poor weather 
conditions such as rain and fog could ultimately degrade its 
communication reliability. 
D. Wi-Fi 
Wi-Fi standards are based on IEEE 802.11 series, 
mainly using the 2.4/5GHz band. A number of automobile 
manufacturers are building new cars with in-built Wi-Fi 
capability, providing infotainment applications. V2V 
connectivity could also foster the integration of bicycles and 
pedestrians into the networks [10] using Wi-Fi. This has a 
huge potential in improving road safety and reducing the 
number of accidents as a result of blind spots.

E. 4G/LTE 
Long-Term Evolution (LTE) is a standard for high speed 
communications for mobile phones and data terminals. The 
standard is developed by 3GPP. The key advantage of LTE-
connected cars [4] is having cars connecting directly to the 
Internet through existing 4G-LTE cellular network. Work in 
[20] presents a hybrid scheme that can achieve seamless IP 
communication over mobile Internet access. 
F. Summary of CVN Channel Requirements 
Table I summarize the various wireless channels, their 
standard requirements and potential advantages and 
disadvantages for V2V and V2x. The current industry trends 
are choosing DSRC and 4G/LTE as the best way to offer 
connectivity between cars. Many critical applications are 
linked to safety applications, e.g., air bag control, automatic 
braking, etc. Inter-operability between these networking 
standards will be an important milestone. Work presented in 
[21] concludes that DSRC configuration choice has an 
impact on safety messages successfully transmitted. In 
addition, as suggested in [22][23], an upper limit on 
information provided to the vehicle may be necessary to 
prevent overloading drivers with information. This poses 
additional requirements and challenges towards the 
standardization 
of 
wireless 
channels 
for 
vehicle 
communication. Depending on the communication type e.g., 
V2V or V2x, all of the wireless channels presented in Table 
I will be relevant and the CVN modelling has to take that 
into account.

(PCA) on GEMV2 data for V2V and V2I. This will help us 
in understanding the interaction between the four parameters 
chosen and their impact on the link quality and lay the 
foundation in establishing the modelling direction for CVN. 
A. GEMV2  
GEMV2 (Geometry-based Efficient Propagation Model 
for V2V communication) [7] data is freely available and is 
implemented in MATLAB. GEMV2 measures large-scale 
variation calculated deterministically and small-scale signal 
variation stochastically based on the number and size of the 
surrounding objects. Both the signal variation is measured in 
decibels. We use the GEMV2 data of large-scale and small-
scale signal variation under the influence of four different 
conditions - they are LOS, NLOS, the number of 
neighbouring vehicles and the neigh-thresh per vehicle. The 
data is available for both V2V and V2I. The communication 
channel is IEEE802.11p.

LOS links have an unobstructed path between 
communicating vehicles, whereas NLOS is obstructed by 
vehicles and buildings. Neighbours is defined as the number 
of transmitting vehicles in the network and neigh-thresh is 
defined as the number of neighbouring vehicles whose 
received power was above the threshold.  
B. ANOVA on GEMV2 Data 
ANOVA was carried out on the GEMV2 dataset. 
ANOVA is chosen as it enables us to understand the 
interaction between the four parameters on link quality. 
Table II presents the results. ANOVA was carried out on 
large-scale signal variation only for both V2V and V2I as the 
interaction between parameters was found to be not as 
significant for small-scale variation.  
Tables II shows the results of the ANOVA. The p-value 
is derived from the cumulative distribution function of F [24] 
and a small p-value indicates that the link quality is 
significantly influenced by the corresponding parameter.  
Between V2V communications, both LOS and NLOS have 
significant impact on the link quality, whereas between V2I 
communications, NLOS is slightly more significant than 
LOS and the Neigh-thresh have a higher impact on link 
quality. However, for V2V, all four parameters have small 
p-values indicating that they all in varying degree are 
significant. However, it is interesting to note that, in V2I, 
the number of neighbours per vehicle is not that significant. 
For V2V, the combined interaction between LOS and 
NLOS and NLOS and Neighbours is most significant. 
Whereas, for V2I, the combined interactions are less 
significant compared to the individual. To better understand 
the interactions, PCA investigation is carried out. 
C. PCA on GEMV2 Data 
PCA was chosen as it reduces the dimensionality of the 
data while retaining as much information as possible. PCA 
involves calculating the eigenvalues and their corresponding 
eigenvectors of the covariance or correlation matrix. 
Covariance matrix is used where the same data has the same 
set of variables and correlation matrix is used in the case 
where data has a different set of variables. In this paper, 
covariance matrix was used because of the same dataset.  
 
Figure 4a. PCA results for V2V 
Figures 4a and 4b show the PCA results for V2V and 
V2I respectively. In addition to the four factors, both large-
scale (Largepower) and small-scale (Smallpower) signal 
variation is used. The horizontal axis represents the first 
principal component and the vertical axis the second. Each

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR CVN MODELLING  
QoS assessment will enable us to choose parameters in 
modelling the CVN. Our small-scale QoS assessment 
highlighted some of the research challenges and hence 
potential opportunities for further work are as follows: 
(i) Overcoming QoS issues in connected vehicles is 
fundamental to the successful deployment of V2x 
connectivity. The QoS can be affected by networking 
parameters such as bandwidth, delay and latency. In 
addition, parameters such as the distance between 
vehicles, road-side sensors and the speed of the vehicle 
all play a part towards the QoS of the V2x network 
thus 
integrating 
connected 
vehicles 
into 
IoT 
ecosystems [25]. QoS will be further divided between 
V2x service reliability for safety related applications 
where parameters such as time-sensitivity during 
message transfer, guarantee of message delivery, etc.  
are highest priorities. While, QoS of on-board 
applications e.g., infotainment will be lower in priority.  
(ii) We also identified that the needs for trade-off between 
the amount of intelligence sitting with the vehicle for 
intra-vehicle connectivity and to that controlled 
remotely via an intelligent control system. Different 
wireless channels will be suitable for inter-vehicle vs 
intra-vehicle connectivity. For example, on-board 
sensors that can sense a motorbike/bicycle within the 
blind spot of the driver can greatly improve road safety 
and reduce accidents.  
(iii) Prediction of CVN will be based on information centric 
network paradigm which is independent of location. 
The CVN will be predicted from the preceding state of 
the vehicle based on position/velocity. 
Figure 5 shows an overview of real time sharing of 
sensor information between vehicles via cloud or V2Cloud 
(via DSRC or LTE-direct). It shows various scenarios of 
connectivity to clouds, ITS, other vehicles, pedestrians, etc. 
The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has established 
communication standards for DSRC for connected vehicles 
(SAE J2735) [26]. This is the first step towards 
standardizing the CVN communication protocols as most 
vehicle manufacturers in the near future will be building 
cars with in-built Wi-Fi capability. An immediate 
application would be to reduce traffic congestion by 
relaying an accident/roadworks/incident to re-route traffic 
thus reducing the overall traffic congestion.  
Therefore, the main research questions that emerge from 
existing literature and our QoS assessment on connected 
vehicles are: 
• What are the QoS issues in V2x networks e.g., what 
impact(s) would weather conditions have on the QoS? 
• What will the network standards for CVN be? 
• Will there be different network protocols within CVN 
e.g., for V2V, V2R, V2I, etc. and what are the 
interoperability challenges here? 
• How does CVN benefit autonomous car evolution? 
• How to enhance security in CVN? 
• What form(s) of connected vehicles will we see in the 
next five years on the roads of most developed 
economies?

CONCLUSIONS 
This paper presents QoS assessment from ANOVA and 
PCA on the link quality of connected vehicles. We used data 
from GEMV2. Our analysis shows that for V2V number of 
transmitting vehicles in the network (neighbours) has a 
bigger impact than in V2I on link quality. However, 
parameters of LOS and NLOS are significant in both types 
(V2V and V2I). This will help us determine the direction of 
modelling of the link network for CVN. It further addresses 
QoS challenges in connected vehicles and presents an 
overview of the various wireless channels and their 
applications in connected vehicles scenarios. The key issues 
identified will help lay the foundation for future research 
directions in this area. Some of the challenges that need to

weather conditions and their impacts, for example how low 
visibility and extreme weather conditions can impact on the 
QoS of the connected vehicle. In addition, cameras and 
ultra-sonic sensors are limited to low distance. The overall 
reliability of the sensor data within connected vehicle 
communication is critical. As suggested in [3], for safety 
management, sensors that can detect fatigue levels of the 
driver by monitoring various bodily conditions can also be 
added. The first commercial vehicles to have onboard units 
installed are expected in summer 2017 from Cadillac [27].  
The data information and filters necessary are also 
investigated, e.g., what is critical, necessary, add-on to 
process in the vehicle and what data to send/receive to/from 
the data centre. The challenge is to maintain the QoS of the 
real-time communication protocol and how to ensure data 
integrity of the process.  With autonomous driving being 
trialled this year in the UK, what role will connected 
vehicles play? These are some of the imminent research 
questions highlighted from our research.  Future direction of 
our research will aim to address the points raised in this 
paper and focus on modelling the CVN with some form of 
control.
