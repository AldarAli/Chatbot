Abstract—Heterogeneous
Mobile
Ad
hoc
Net-
work(HMANET) comprises different nodes with different
capabilities. Hence, transmission and receiving capabilities are
different. This causes unidirectionality problem. Avoidances
is the most used strategy in researches to route data, e.g.,
Blacklist. In this paper, we proposed a strategy for on-demand
routing protocols to detect unidirectional link and resolve it
in timely fashion. This strategy is based on utilizing locations
of nodes to ﬁlter and cache incoming RREQ packets to ﬁnd
reliable path to destination in the existence of unidirectional
links. Simulation results show that our strategy outperforms
Blacklist strategy in homogeneous and heterogeneous MANET.

I. INTRODUCTION
Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs) are networks of
wireless mobile nodes that have no ﬁxed structure. Each
node may act either as a router or an end-user node. In
MANETs, node heterogeneity is one of the main network
conditions that signiﬁcantly affects the performance of the
routing protocols [1]. Although most current MANET rout-
ing protocols assume homogeneous networking conditions
where all nodes have the same capabilities and resources,
in real life MANET may consist of heterogeneous nodes
that have different capabilities and resources like military
(battleﬁeld) networks and rescue operations systems. Hence,
the transmission reachability and quality of data reception
among nodes are different. This can create a problem of uni-
directional link between any two nodes. Unidirectional link
problem is deﬁned, where node B has a higher transmission
range than node A (see Figure 1). Therefore B includes
A in its transmission range while A does not include B.
Consequently, the link between B and A is unidirectional
from B to A only. However, most reactive routing protocols
in MANET, assumes all links between two nodes are bidirec-
tional, which gives incorrect routing information. Therefore,
this incorrect information creates large delay and packet
loss in heterogeneous networking [1]. In [2], suggested that
unidirectional link can be utilised to increase packet delivery
and hence increase reliability. In this paper, we investigate
this issue by proposing a strategy that is Location-Based
Utilization (LBU) to detect and utilise unidirectional links
in route discovery process of on-demand routing protocols.
This strategy utilizes locations of forwarding nodes of RREQ
Figure 1: Unidirectional Link
packets to resolve unidirectionality problem. All received
RREQ packets are cacheed and ﬁltered before they are
processed or dropped.
The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section II
presents related works. In section III, the proposed strategy is
described. The simulation parameters and scenarios that are
used to investigate the performance of the proposed strategy
are given in section IV. Then the results of the simulation
study are summarised in section V. Section VI concludes the
paper.
II. RELATED WORK
The common approaches to detect unidirectional link in
MANETs are via MAC layer or network layer or both. Two
way handshake Request-To-Send (RTS) and Clear-To-Send
(CTS) is the common approach in MAC to avoid unidi-
rectional links [3]. Network layer approaches use feedback
mechanism either to detect and avoid unidirectional link
or utilise it to improve routing processes. In heterogeneous
MANET (HMANET), the issue of unidirectional links has
been investigated. Different strategies have been developed
to enhance the performance of routing protocols in presence
of unidirectional links [2][3][4][5][6][7]. In AODV-Blacklist
[8], when destination node sends RREP (or any node relays
RREP) to next hop in the reserve path, it waits for ACK
of receiving RREP. If it fails to receive ACK because of
unidirectional link , then next hop is cached in blacklist.
This means that when the node receives RREQ for second
time from the node in blacklist, the packet will be dropped.
AODV-BlackList avoids unidirectional link but with cost of
high load of control overheads. Also, delay is increasing
because source node may consume all RREQ RETRIES to
ﬁnd path to destination.

Figure 2: Routing through bidirectional links.
In [9], Early Unidirectionality Detection and Avoidance
(EUDA) mechanism is proposed to detect and avoid unidi-
rectional link in ad hoc network. This mechanism appends
the forwarding node location only in RREQ packet to detect
the unidirectionality. When node receives RREQ packet
for the ﬁrst time, it compares the transmission range to
the distance to forwarding node using location information.
If there is unidirectional link then the packet is dropped
without any processing. This mechanism is used only to
detect and avoid unidirectionality of links without utilizing
it. In the worst case where there is no bidirectional route, all
RREQ RETRIES are consumed. Consequently, the control
overheads increases and the packet delivery ratio decreases
as the path to destination is not establishes. In [2], a powerful
and simple strategy has been suggested to resolve unidirec-
tional links in AODV-Blacklist. This strategy is developed to
resolve the problem of unidirectional links by rebroadcasting
RREP to ﬁrst hop nodes as unidirectional link is detected
and no nodes are blocked. To avoid insufﬁcient exchanging
ACKs during RREP rebroadcasting, TTL is set to 1. Also
source node id and destination id are cached to avoid
duplications of the same RREP packets. The simulation
result shows improvement of AODV performance in term
of packet delivery ratio and control overhead.
III. DESCRIPTION
In LBU, we use the concept of detecting unidirectional
link using location information as in [9]. However, LBU
differs from EUDA in [9] by utilizing the unidirectionality
to improve routing process in on-demend routing protocols
using 2 hops nodes locations . In Figure 2, there are different
nodes with different transmission powers. Source node 1
initiates route discovery to ﬁnd path to node 7. Node 2
will rebroadcasts the RREQ packet. Node 8 will receive
the packet and has path to destination 7. However, it fails
unicast its RREP to node 2 because of unidirectional link.
As receiving a duplicated RREQ packet is ignored, then
Figure 3: RREQ packet formate
Figure 4: RREQ packet traversing
received RREQ from node 9 is ignored in node 8. In AODV-
BlackList, rebroadcasting will continue until the destination
is found or RREQ retries limit is reached. In Figure 2,
node 8 will consider node 2 is unreachable and then inserts
node 2 in its blacklist. Therefore, when node 8 receives
any packet from node 2, it will be ignored. Source node
1 will have long path 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7
to reach destination 7, which 3-hop far. This long path can
degrade the reliability of network and delay data comparing
to expected path 1 → 2 → 9 → 8 → 7. One of the strategy
to resolve this problem, when node 8 detects unidirectional
link to previous forwarding node of RREQ, it rebroadcasts
its RREP to its ﬁrst hop neighbours. As node 9 hears
rebroadcasting of RREQ and RREP packets, it will unicast
RREP packet to node 2. This idea is similar to [2] (see more
details in related work section). However, this may create
large number of paths and increases control overheads,
which may degrade the network performance. Instead of
rebroadcasting RREP as in [2], each node (e.g., node 8)
starts caching all RREQ packets of the same source and
ﬂood id to resolve any unidirectional links. The description
of how to detect and utilize unidirectional links are described
in below subsections.
A. How is the unidirectionality detected?
Each RREQ packet will have two more ﬁelds, see Fig-
ure 3. These two ﬁelds carry locations of last two hops
nodes, see Figure 4. When node receives RREQ packet,

the

interface.

PHY PropagationRange(node, 0, FALSE )
3) The node compares its transmission range to the
distance in step1:
if (Distance > Transmission Range CurrNode)
link is unidirectional
else
link is bidirectional
B. How is the unidirectional link ﬁxed?
Unidirectional link here means that the current node can
not reach the forwarding node while the forwarding node
can reach it. Instead of dropping all RREQ packets of the
same ﬂood id and source id, the node caches the information
in RREQ packet to detects and resolve the unidirectional-
ity during the ﬂooding of the same RREQ packet. These
information is stored in a table called ”seen data table”,
Figure 7: The triangle inequality in distance between nodes
which is similar to seenTable in AODV. seenTable is used
to avoid duplication of the same RREQ packet where it
keeps the id of source and ﬂood number of the ﬁrst incoming
RREQ packet. seen data table is used to resolve unidirec-
tionality. The formate of this table is shown in Figure 5.
Each node receives RREQ packet, detects the type of the
link. Each type of link has different process as following:
Unidirectional Link:
If the link is unidirectional (see Figure 6) then node searches
seen data table for a record, which can resolve the problem
where:
1) source id and ﬂooding number are the same as the
current received RREQ packet. This guarantee the
freshens of nodes locations information and updates
unidirectionality situation in timely fashion within
neighbourhoods nodes.
2) The value of isUnidiLink is false, which means the
forwarded node has bidirectional link to the current
node.
3) Location value of B last loc ﬁeld of the record is
same as Location of Last Node in received RREQ
packet. In Figure 6, node 8 looks in its seen data table
for a node that can reach the forwarding node of the
current RREQ packet.
4) To avoid long path and replace unidirectional link with
only 2-hop link, node is selected based on its location
to form triangle inequality with current and forwarding
node . In other words, we prefer the situation where
the length of unidirectional link is less than the sum
of lengths of other 2 links as shown in Figure 7 where
d1 < d2+d3 and di is the distance between node pair
of nodes.
If a record is found that satisﬁes above conditions then the
”forwarding node address” in seen data table is used as next
hop to the current forwarding node of the current received
RREQ packet. Otherwise, information about the RREQ
packet and unidirectionality are inserted in seen data table.
Also if the received RREQ packet has not been process yet,
then the packet will be processed after unidirectional link is
ﬁxed where node 9 will be the source of the packet. To utilise

Figure 8: Incoming RREQ packet through bidirectional link
node memory, each record that have been used to solve
unidirectionality in seen data table is deleted. Therefore, the
record about node 9 in seen data table is deleted because
it has already been used to solve the unidirectional link
between node 8 and node 2. Consequently, as this problem
has been solved, it is inefﬁcient to insert information about
node 2 in seen data table.
Bidirectional Link:
If the link between forwarding node of the current re-
ceived RREQ packet is bidirectional (see Figure 8) then
information of this packet is used to solve any unidirectional
link in seen data table if:
1) Conditions 1 and 4 are satisﬁed as above described.
2) The value of isUnidiLink is true, which means the
forwarded node has unidirectional link to the current
node.
3) Location value of last loc of the record is same as
location of B Last Node in received RREQ packet. In
Figure 8, node 8 looks for a node where the forwarding
node of the current RREQ packet can reach it while
node 8 can’t.
If a record is found that satisﬁes above conditions then the
address of current forwarding node is used as next hop to the
forwarded node of the recorded packet. In Figure 8, node
9 will be the next hop to node 2. Otherwise, information
about the RREQ packet and bidirectionality are inserted in
seen data table to be used to solve any incoming unidirec-
tional link. To utilise node memory, each record of the unidi-
rectionality that has been solved seen data table is deleted.
Therefore, the record about node 2 in seen data table is
deleted. Each node receives second ﬂood of the same RREQ
packet will delete all records about the ﬁrst ﬂood in the
seen data table.
IV. SIMULATION MODELS
The performance of LBU for unidirectional link is com-
pared to BlackList and RTS/CTS strategy. AODV[8] and
OTRP[10] are used as routing protocols. OTRP combines
the idea of hop-by-hop routing such as AODV with an efﬁ-
cient route discovery algorithm called Tree-based Optimized
Flooding (TOF) to improve scalability of Ad hoc networks
when there is no previous knowledge about the destination.
To achieve this in OTRP, route discovery overheads are
minimized by selectively ﬂooding the network through a
limited set of nodes, referred to as branching-nodes. Those
protocols have been simulated using the QualNet4.5 pack-
age. The simulations ran for 200s with 100 different values
of seeds. Nodes density of 100 were randomly distributed on
1500 x 1500 grids. Random way point was used as mobility
model with ﬁve different values of pause times that were
0s, 50s, 100s, 150s, and 200s. Speeds of the nodes were
varied from 0 to 20 m/s. The simulated protocols have been
evaluated with 10 data trafﬁc ﬂows. Constant Bite Rate
(CBR) was used to generate data trafﬁc at 4 packets per
second. Each packet was 512 bytes. IEEE 802.11b was used
as MAC protocol with constant transmission bandwidth of
2Mbps. The strategy has been evaluated in homogeneous
and heterogeneous MANET where transmission power of
all node was 15dbm in homogeneous MANET. In heteroge-
neous MANET, there are two different types of nodes where
50% of nodes have transmission powers as 15dbm and other
50% has transmission powers as 10dbm. Packet Delivery
Ratio (PDR), End-to-End Delay, and Normalized Control
Overhead (NCO) were used as performance metrics of each
protocol. In addition, we introduce new metric called Retried
Ratio (Ret Ratio), which is ratio of the number of RREQ
packets retried to the number of RREQ packets initiated.
This ratio calculates the number of RREQ retries that has
been consumed to ﬁnd routes. As this ratio is high indicating
that more RREQ retries have been consumed to ﬁnd path to
destination. Conﬁdence interval of 95% is used to scale the
data.
V. RESULTS
LBU is applied on top of AODV and OTRP where Black-
list and RTS/CTS are disabled, see (Figure 9- Figure 10).
The problem of the unidirectionality affects routing pro-
cess of on demand routing protocols, where the forwarding
node of the RREQ may have unidirectional links to its
neighbours nodes. In other words, rebroadcasting nodes
stores incorrect information about the ﬁrst hop, which is un-
reachable because of unidirectionality. Consequently, source
node does not received RREP packet and then the route may
not found. This will increase the number of route discovery
occurrences and consequently increases Ret Ratio.
Blacklist RTS/CTS strategy with AODV and OTRP
detect unidirectional links after it occurs then avoids
unidirectional links without solving. This strategy may

work with homogeneous MANET where nodes have similar
transmission power and the occurrence of unidirectionality
is low. However, LBU outperforms Blacklist RTS/CTS
strategy in term of PDR and NCO under both unidirectional
and bidirectional links, see(Figure 9(b-c) and Figure 10(b-
c)). This is because LBU strategy supports AODV and
OTRP by ﬁltering incoming RREQ packets where not
all
incoming
packets
are
processed.
In
other
words,
incorrect information about ﬁrst hop neighbours is avoided
using LBU. Moreover, our strategy provides sufﬁcient
routing information about 2-hop neighbours by solving
unidirectional
links.
In
homogeneous
MANET
where
bidirectional links are assumed to exist between any
pair
of
nodes,
LBU
performs
more
efﬁciently
than
Blacklist RTS/CTS. AODV LBU increases PDR by 2%
and (see Figure 9(b)) while OTRP LBU increases PDR by
10% (see Figure 10(b)). Although locations of last 2 hops
are attached with RREQ packet in LBU, NCO is improved
comparing to Blacklist RTS/CTS as shown in Figure 9(c)
and Figure 10(c) where AODV LBU and OTRP LBU
reduces NCO by 0.8. However, delay with LBU is higher
than Blacklist RTS/CTS for both protocols where the
number of unidirectional link is low under bidirectional
links, as shown in (Figure 9(a) and Figure 10(a)) . This is
because if unidirectional link is exist between forwarding
node and its relay, this will reduce rebroadcasting area,
which may increase Ret Ratio and then consequently
increases delay as shown in Figure 9(d) and Figure 10(d).
However, detecting unidirectional links and resolving it
immediately can guarantee a reliable path to route data,
which explains the improvement in PDR and NCO.
In
heterogeneous MANET, nodes with different transmission
are exist. Therefore, high percentage of unidirectional
links occur. In both protocols, LBU resolves this problem
without any increasing of NCO or delay comparing to
Blacklist RTS/CTS strategy or other strategies as you
can see in Figure 9 and Figure 10. This is because
LBU detects and immediately resolves any unidirectional
links that may occur in the ﬁrst RREQ RETRIAL (see
Figure 9-(d) and Figure 10-(d)) comparing to Blacklist
strategy where unidirectional links are avoided and some
nodes are blocked. Therefore, AODV Blacklist RTS/CTS
and OTRP Blacklist RTS/CTS consume nearly 2 and 3
respectively out of 3 RREQ RETRIALS to ﬁnd bidirectional
paths to route the data. This will increase delay as shown in
Figure 10(a). Unlike AODV, the number of rebroadcasting
nodes is eliminated in OTRP, which reduce rebroadcasting
area and hence OTRP requires more RREQ RETRIAL.
Therefore, generally the delay with OTRP is sightly
higher than AODV but OTRP LBU has constant delay. As
RTS/CTS is used too, Blacklist RTS/CTS consequently
increase NCO by 1.5 and decrease PDR by at least 6%
as in Figure 9-(b and c) and Figure 10-(b and c) respectively.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, LBU is proposed to resolve unidirectional
link in MANET. Instead of dropping duplicated RREQ
packet, each incoming RREQ packet is used to ﬁlter routing
information of neighbours under unidirectionality. LBU and
Blacklist RTS/CTS are applied on top of AODV and OTRP.
LBU outperforms Blacklist with RTS/CTS strategies under
homogeneous and heterogeneous MANET in term of PDR
and NCO, and without increasing delay.
