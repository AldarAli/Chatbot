Abstract—In advanced countries, populations are getting older. 
Cognitive disorder is a large problem in the countries. To 
understand the cognitive disorder with aging, we need to have a 
whole image of the development and the aging of our cognitive 
functions. We need to measure the performance of brain 
functions with the process of development and aging. For 
synchronizing with other motion, we need to feel the other 
motion, to recognize, to memorize, and to generate the 
synchronizing motion. We need many kinds of brain functions 
to make synchronizing movement. The authors proposed the 
cooperative visual synchronization task, its measuring method, 
implementation and experiments to measure and evaluate the 
performance of motor control function. The new task and the 
measuring method enable to measure the precise movements 
and evaluate the performance of motor control function easily 
in a short period. The proposed method is safe, because there is 
no need to attach the device to a subject nor to make exaggerated 
motions. This paper presents the results of experiments about 
primary school pupil, high-school students, young students, 
manhood people and elderly people. In addition, the authors 
show the overview of development and aging process of motor 
control function from objective measurement of cooperative 
movement in both hands.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Our brain function starts its development from the age of 
infant, keeps its performance in manhood, and deteriorates 
with aging. There is no overview about our brain performance 
from infant to elderly people in single measure. IQ test can be 
applied to wide range of ages. However, the IQ test needs 
much time. The IQ test is not the same in all range of ages. 
The IQ test for an infant is not same with the one for a young 
adult. 
With aging, our physical function deteriorates, and also 
our brain functions [1]. In advanced countries, the populations 
are getting older. Our physical deteriorations are measured 
easily. Also, we need to measure the deterioration of brain 
functions. There are tests to measure the memory functions 
and the cognition disorders. 
A cooperative movement with other movements is more 
difficult than simple movements. For instance, clapping hands 
is easy. However, clapping hands synchronizing with other 
people is difficult. Synchronizing movement is the base of 
cooperative movement. For synchronizing with another 
motion, we need to feel the other motion, to recognize, to 
memorize, and to generate the synchronizing motion. We may 
estimate the performance of total brain function observing the 
process of synchronizing movement. Because of it, we need 
to work many brain functions to complete the synchronizing 
movement. 
Many motor tasks measure the performance of human 
motor function. They are the Purdue pegboard task, a seal 
affixation task, a tray-carrying task, etc. [2] - [4]. These tasks 
estimate the performance of human motor function based on 
the results from the tasks. There is no observation on the 
process of completing the tasks. Some synchronization tasks 
measure motor function of a human. One example is a 
synchronization of ﬁnger taps with periodically ﬂashing visual 
stimuli and synchronization with an auditory metronome. In 
these tasks, the timing between the stimuli and the tapping is 
measured. There is no observation about the process of the 
tapping [5] - [11]. 
Recently, many cheap and easy measurement methods for 
the movements of a human body have been developed. For 
instance, some of these sensors include Kinect sensor, and 
Leap motion sensor [12] [13]. Many applications use these 
sensors to control computers. For example, many video games 
use these sensors to control avatars in the games [14]. 
Using the new motion sensor, we can measure the motion 
of hands easily and precisely. The human hands are the parts 
of a body that can make the most complex movements. We 
have proposed a method that measures the precise movements 
of hands synchronizing the movements of hands on a display. 
The synchronization needs visual perception of the displayed 
hands’ images and precise control over the arm muscles. The 
resulting measure is very sensitive. With this measure, we can 
observe the performance of the motor function precisely [15]. 
This paper proposes the overview of development and 
aging process of our brain with a new estimation method to 
evaluate the performance of a brain function by the 
measurement of a motion control function in cooperative 
synchronizing movements. To draw the outline of the 
development and the aging process, this paper needs many age 
groups that spans from infant to elderly people. This paper 
includes the experiments about primary school pupil, high 
school students, young, manhood, and elderly people. In this 
paper, there is no infant and junior high school student. 
However, this paper can show the outline of development and 
aging of brain function in a single measure. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
discusses a task to synchronize hands’ movements with visual 
presentation. Next, we discuss the experimental setup in

Section III, and show our experimental results in Section IV. 
Finally, we conclude this work in Section V. 
II. 
VISUAL SYNCHRONIZATION TASK 
A. Task and Brain Function 
Many motor tasks intend to measure the performance of 
the motor function of a human [2] - [4]. Motor function is not 
a strength of muscles. The strength of muscles is one measure 
of our body performance. We may have problems of our 
muscles in the case that we cannot have a good performance 
of motor functions. For the people with healthy body, their 
brain performance decides the performance on motor tasks. 
Those motor tasks measure the performance of some motions. 
However, most of these tasks measure the results from the 
tasks. They do not measure the process of motions directly. 
Some tasks measure the synchronization between a finger 
tap and stimuli [5] - [11]. With human observations, it is 
difficult to measure the process of synchronizing movements. 
Classical works measure the timing of pushing a switch. Now, 
we can use a Kinect sensor and a Leap Motion sensor. These 
sensors measure the three-dimensional movements of a 
human body. With these sensors, we can measure the precise 
movements of a human body. 
We can synchronize our movements with each other. For 
instance, when dancing in groups, dancers can synchronize 
their movements with each other. A synchronization of 
movement is a more difficult work than a simple imitation of 
movement. To generate synchronizing movements, we need 
to observe the motion synchronized. We need to generate the 
motion to be similar to the motion synchronized. We need to 
observe the generated motion synchronizing the original 
motion. We need to estimate the divergence between the 
original motion synchronized and the motion synchronizing 
the original motion. We need to control the speed of the 
motion synchronizing. These functions form a feedback loop. 
However, there is a delay in our processing. To compensate 
our brain’s processing delay, we need to estimate the delay 
itself and make a proper amount of feedforward. Therefore, 
our brain functions have a feedback loop and a feedforward 
loop. 
This processing loop is shown in Fig. 1. For estimating the 
total brain function, we need to include all the functions of the 
brain. In this paper, we call the task that a subject synchronizes 
one's movement to the displayed movement, as the visual 
synchronization task. The visual synchronization task includes 
vision and motor functions. The vision includes not only the 
static sight, but also the dynamic sight. 
The visual synchronization task is more difficult than 
audio synchronization. Therefore, we observe the wider brain 
functions with the visual synchronization tasks than the audio 
synchronization tasks. 
Our proposed visual synchronization task is the 
synchronization between the pose of stimuli on a display and 
the pose of the hands. Our synchronization task is not the 
synchronization between the timing of the stimuli and the 
timing of the action. The measurement of timing gets only one 
scalar value in a cycle of stimuli. In our proposed 
synchronization task, the measuring result is a sequence of the 
triples of the pose of subject’s hands in a duration of stimuli. 
For instance, we have 100 triples of floating numbers in a 
second. 
B. Stimuli of Visual Synchronization Task 
For the motor task, the authors select the rotation of both 
hands. Rotation is a difficult movement with a hand. For 
analyzing the synchronization easily, the authors make the 
stimuli that rotation angles follow a precise sine curve. Fig. 2 
shows the example of a pure sine curve. If stimuli form precise 
sine curves, we easily evaluate the observed motion 
comparing with the pure sine curve. 
Our stimuli are a displayed video of both hands’ rotation. 
Fig. 3 shows some frames of a hands’ rotation video for the 
visual synchronization task. In a real world, it is difficult to 
control precisely the motion of hands to follow the pure sine 
curve. If the stimuli images do not follow the pure sine curve,

it is also difficult to evaluate the synchronization between the 
stimuli images and the motions of hands. We can use many 
measures. For instance, the square error of the poses between 
stimuli and hands can work as the performance measure of the 
observed hands’ movements. However, the square error 
changes in the scale of movements of hands. This paper needs 
the method to measure the performance of the motor control 
function. The flexibility of our arms must not affect the 
performance measure. Therefore, square error is not fit for our 
purpose. Using a pure sine curve as stimuli, we can estimate 
the performance of our hands’ movements with invoking a 
signal-to-noise ratio based on the communication theory. This 
proposes a strict base to the proposed measuring method for 
the performance of the control function. 
C.  Implementation 
Fig. 3 shows the sequence of stimuli examples. The total 
sequence of stimuli includes 67 images. The images are 
proposed on a display with a constant interval from top to 
bottom. Then, they are proposed from bottom to top. These 
two sequences make one cycle of the stimuli of hands’ motion. 
In the stimuli images, the right hand and the left hand are the 
same pose. The right one is the mirror image of the left one. 
The authors propose the stimuli generation method that 
displays a proper image at the precise timing. The authors 
recorded the motion of hand’s rotation with a camera and the 
Leap-motion sensor simultaneously using a PC. The records 
include the precise time stumps. From the recorded images 
and measured rotation angles, we constructed the sequence of 
images that rotations follow a pure sine curve. 
In displaying images on a display, there is some delay or 
progress of a timing. Our implementation controls the timing 
of displaying each frame with selecting the best-fit frame at 
the timing. As a result, our implementation displays smooth 
transition between successive frames. 
Our implementation has two sub-processes. The one sub-
process displays the stimuli images. The other sub-process 
measures the pose of hands. With this multi-processing, our 
implementation enables to show the stimuli and to measure 
the reaction of a subject in the best performance. 
In the following experiments, one cycle of hands’ rotation 
is completed in a second. We can rotate our hands 1.5 cycle at 
a second. However, 1.5 cycle at a second is too fast for many 
subjects in our previous experiments. 
We can rotate our hands much more slowly. However, in 
slow rotations, we can easily follow the position of displayed 
hands’ image. In the case, we do not synchronize our 
movements to the displayed hands’ movements. We only 
imitate the poses of the displayed hands. There is no 
synchronization of movements. Therefore, we cannot use 
much slower movements. 
We measure the pose of hands with the leap-motion sensor 
[13]. The sensor measures the poses of hands 100 times for a 
second. As a result, we have two measurements of the poses 
of hands in each cycle of hands’ rotation. The leap-motion 
sensor measures the three-dimensional pose of a hand. We use 
only the rotations around forearms.

D. Motion synchronization measure 
We define the synchronization measure using Fast Fourier 
Transform (FFT) results of the measured rotations of poses of 
both hands in each cycle [16]. If a subject makes complete 
synchronization to the stimuli, the resulting poses of both 
hands follow a pure sine curve. As a result, at every cycle of 
the rotation of hands, the result of FFT has a zero value at the 
second term or higher terms. We define the measure 
representing the noise-to-signal ratio as (1). This measure 
increases with increasing the difference from ideal sine curve. 
𝑁𝑆𝑀 = (෍ 𝑚௫
௧/ସ
௫ୀଶ
) 𝑚ଵ
൘
 
(1) 
In (1), t is the number of terms. 𝑚௫ is the absolute value of 
the 𝑥-th term of the result of FFT. 𝑚ଵ is the power of the 
lowest frequency. This represents one cycle of a hand’s 
rotation. If the rotation of a hand follows the stimuli images 
precisely, 𝑚ଵ carries all powers of the hand’s rotation. Other 
terms carry no power. In that case, the measure in (1) is zero. 
The result FFT has much higher terms from t/4+1 to t. The t/2 
or higher terms are mirrored of lower terms. Therefore, we 
need only treat a t/2 or lower terms. Under t/2 terms, there are 
many noises in upper terms. In a normal processing of FFT, 
we use window function to decrease the noises in observations. 
However, the authors define the measure at each cycle. 
Therefore, it is difficult to use window function. Therefore, 
the authors use only lower half of the all terms. If we can have 
100 measurements in a cycle, we use 25 terms. They represent 
the motion at every 1/50 seconds. This is enough precise for 
observing our brain control loop. 
𝑚଴ is a value that represents the average of poses. This is 
not included in (1). As a result, this measure does not depend 
on the absolute poses of hands. 
Some people rotate their hands largely. Others do not. (1) 
is the ratio between a signal and a noise. Therefore, the scale 
of rotations does not affect the measure. We call this measure 
as Non-Smoothness-Measure (NSM). This measure may span 
from zero to infinity. 
Our proposed system observes two hands. Therefore, at 
every cycle, we have a pair of NSMs. 
E. Phase 
The NSM is the measure of the difference of a motion from 
the displayed motion. However, there is a difference of timing 
between the displayed motion and a user’s motion. The 
tapping test measures the difference between a stimulus and 
the response of a user. In the proposed synchronization task, 
the difference in timing is the difference of phases. 
In the result of FFT, there are phases of all frequencies. 0-
th term carries a constant pose. Therefore, it has not a phase. 
The first term represents the signal of the stimuli. Therefore, 
the authors use the phase of the first-term to estimate the phase 
of the motion of a hand. 
In our experiments, these are from 1 Hz to 50 Hz of terms 
of FFT. The signal of 1 Hz represents the ideal motion based 
on the proposed example motion. Therefore, we use the phase 
of the signal of 1 Hz for evaluating the timing of the motion. 
III. 
EXPERIMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
A. Experiments Setup 
1) Precise type 
From the pre-experiments, the speed of the hands’ rotation 
is best at one cycle per second. Subjects need about three 
cycles to synchronize their movements of hands to the 
proposed motion images and remember the motion. For 
measuring a stable result, we need at least three cycles. As a 
result, one trial of an experiment needs six cycles at least. 
However, there may be some error measurements. For stable 
measurements, we need some redundancy. The authors decide 
10 cycles to measure the hands’ movements synchronizing the 
displayed stimuli images. After the stimuli images disappear, 
the authors want to observe the decay of the motion memory. 
Therefore, the authors observe the motion of hands in fifteen 
seconds. There is no ground about the length of observation. 
However, a subject feels 30 seconds of a trial to be very long. 
For getting reliable results, we decide that the length of a trial 
is 25 cycles of rotations. This means that one trial needs 25 S. 
Fig. 4 shows the relations among parts, cycles, and sections in 
a trial. A cycle is one flip of hands. There are two parts in a 
trial. One part is an example displaying part. The other is no-
example displaying part. The sections are periods to analyze 
measured data. The first section shows the status of a subject 
in the motion example displaying part. The second section 
does the status just after the disappearance of the motion 
example. The third section shows the status at some seconds 
after the example motion disappears. Before starting a trial, 
we instruct subjects to synchronize their hands to the 
displayed hands’ images and continue to move the hands after 
the example motion disappears. 
2) Simple type 
In a large-scale measurement, the precise type 
measurements is too long. It needs at least 25 sends to 
complete. Moreover, there are many error measurements. 
Because, many subjects cannot keep their hands’ movements 
 
 
Figure 4. Structure of precise measurement.

after the displayed hands’ movements disappear. In a large-
scale measurement, the total length of measurements must be 
long. In a long term, there must be some changes of 
environment. In the case, the ratio of error measurement 
increases. However, the authors hope to have a valid trial with 
some error measurements. Therefore, the authors define the 
trial that includes only the example displayed part. The authors 
increase the length of the example displaying part increase to 
fifteen seconds. This is a simple type trial. 
Our simple type of visual synchronization task has no 
measurements of poses of hands without displayed hands’ 
movements. To measure enough valid data, the length of 
measurement is 15 cycles of hands’ rotations. A trial needs 
only 15 seconds. It is 10 seconds shorter than the precise type 
measurement. With longer displayed hands’ movement 
images, many subjects succeed to keep their hands 
synchronizing to the displayed hands’ movements. With some 
error measurements’ cycles, we can have enough valid 
measurements. Therefore, we have a large success ratio of 
trials. 
B. Experiment  
1) People in primary school ages 
We obtained about 400 trials with whole pupils in a normal 
public primary school in Japan. Their ages span from 7 years 
old to 13 years old. The pupils with heavy healthy problems 
attend special support schools. Therefore, the pupils in a 
normal primary school are healthy. The pupils in a first grade 
in a primary school have difficulties to follow the instructions 
of the precise type measurement. The precise type 
measurement needs 1.7 times as much time as the simple type 
measurement. We cannot withstand this increase of 
measurement time. The measurement type must be the simple 
one. 
2) Hight school Students 
There are 35 subjects. However, there are many error trials. 
We have 24 valid measurements. They are third grade of high 
school. They are 17 or 18 years old. They are 21 male students 
and 3 female students. The authors made VST trials for the 
high-school students in voluntary basis. Therefore, the authors 
selected the simple type measurements. 
3) Young people (University Students) 
We obtained 232 trials with five healthy male students, 
with ages between 22 - 24 years old. The measurement type is 
the precise one. 
4) Manhood people 
We performed experiments with manhood people. They 
are 3 females and 12 males. They are from 25 years old to 63 
years old. Their average age is 44 years old. They are all 
healthy. They made 168 trials. The measurement type is the 
simple one.  
5) Elderly people 
We performed experiments with elderly people, 75 years 
old in average. They are from 66 years old to be 82 years old. 
They are all healthy in their ages. In our observation, one 
female has a difficulty about walking. Therefore, we have 14 
healthy elderly people, 4 males and 10 females. 
The measurement type is precise one. Each person made 
two trials. Therefore, we have the 28 trials. One trial had a 
failure in measurement. We obtained 27 valid measurements 
of the trials. 
6)  Performance measure for a trial 
a) Precise type measurement 
At each trial, we have 25 pairs of NSMs and 25 pairs of 
phases at most. In many cases, a subject could not move his 
hands as the displayed hands at the first cycle. The NSM 
shows the difference of the motion of subject’s hands from the 
proposed example motion at each cycle. The phase represents 
the difference of the timing between the proposed example 
motion and the motion made by a subject. 
In a single cycle, measured movements of hands may 
match the proposed example movements accidentally. We 
estimate the performance of the motion control function with 
the average motions in three continuous cycles. In addition, 
we estimate the performance of a subject in a trial with the 
best movements in the averages of three continuous cycles. 
Equation (2) defines the performance of a hand in a trial. 
NSMHp = min
௜ୀଵ,଼ 𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒(𝑁𝑆𝑀௜, 𝑁𝑆𝑀௜ାଵ, 𝑁𝑆𝑀௜ାଶ) 
(2) 
NSMHp is the performance of a hand in a trial in precise 
type. 𝑁𝑆𝑀௜ is the NSM at i-th cycle defined as (1). We have 
two NSMHps in a trial. They represent the performances of 
both hands. 
We define the performance measure in a trial as (3). 
NSMTp = min (𝑁𝑆𝑀𝐻𝑝௅, 𝑁𝑆𝑀𝐻𝑝ோ) 
(3) 
In (3), NSMTp is the performance measure in a trial. 
𝑁𝑆𝑀𝐻𝑝௅ is the NSMHp of the left hand. 𝑁𝑆𝑀𝐻𝑝ோ  is the 
NSMHp of the right hand. This NSMTp represents the 
performance of a subject in a trial. Our previous experiments 
show that the difference between both hands is small. 
However, we select a better one for the measure of motor 
control function. A subject shows a difference of the 
performance between a left hand and a right hand. This paper 
uses the better performance. 
b) Simple type measurements 
At each simple type measurement, there are 15 cycles of 
hands’ movements. At this type of measurement, the author 
uses all 15 cycles to estimate the performance. 
Equation (4) defines the performance of a hand in a trial. 
NSMHs = min
௜ୀଵ,ଵଷ 𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒(𝑁𝑆𝑀௜, 𝑁𝑆𝑀௜ାଵ, 𝑁𝑆𝑀௜ାଶ) 
(4) 
NSMHs is the performance of a hand in a trial. 𝑁𝑆𝑀௜ is 
the NSM at i-th cycle defined as (1). We have two NSMHs in 
a trial. They represent the performances of both hands.

NSMTs = min (𝑁𝑆𝑀𝐻𝑠௅, 𝑁𝑆𝑀𝐻𝑠ோ) 
(5) 
In (5), NSMTs is the performance measure in a trial. 
𝑁𝑆𝑀𝐻𝑠௅  is the NSMHs of the left hand. 𝑁𝑆𝑀𝐻𝑠ோ  is the 
NSMHs of the right hand. The NSMTs represents the 
performance of a subject in a trial. However, we select a better 
one for the measure of motor control function. A subject 
shows a difference of the performance between a left hand and 
a right hand. This paper uses the better performance. 
There is a difference between the definition of NSMTp and 
the definition of NSMTs. However, in most trials, around fifth 
cycle, both of NSMHs and NSMHp show the least value. 
Therefore, we can treat NSMTp and NSMTs in a same manner. 
In the precise type measurements, we have multiple 
measurements of a subject. The precise measurements are well 
controlled. 
 
IV. RESULT AND DISCUSSIONS 
A. NSMs 
1) Pupil in Primary school 
The rotation of hands can be achieved from the five years 
old. In Japan, pupils in primary school are from six years old 
to twelve years old. In these ages, the performance of a brain 
represented as motor control function are developing. The 
authors have a chance to measure the NSMs of all pupils in a 
primary school. 
We summarize the measurements with subjects’ age. Fig. 
5 shows the distribution of all measurements in a primary 
school. In Fig. 5, x-axis is the months from birth. The y-axis 
is NSMTs. A linear approximation of the distribution is shown 
(6). 
Table I shows the averages and the standard derivations in 
each school year. With the progress of school year, the average 
NSMTs decreases. We can estimate linear approximation of 
the distribution. (6) shows the linear approximation. In a 
month, a pupil in a primary school shows 0.0021 decrease of 
NSMTs. 
NSMT = −0.0021M + 0.539 
(6) 
 
In (6), M is the month from birth of a subject. 
The difference of 0.0021 is difficult to be measured. 
However, VST can distinguish the change of 0.002 NSMT. 
VST can measure the development in three months.

In the range from seven years old to 13 years old, (7) 
represents the estimated developmental age of pupils. 
M = − NSMT
0.0021 + 257 
(7) 
In (7), M is the estimated developmental age by months 
from birth. 
There is a large number of subjects of pupils in a primary 
school. We can estimate the quadratic approximation of the 
distribution. (8) is the quadratic approximation of the 
distribution of all subjects in a primary school. 
NSMT = 
0.00001145𝑀ଶ − 0.004658𝑀 + .6781 
(8) 
(8) estimates the distribution of NSMT from 75 months 
old to 147 months old. If we assume that the tendency 
represented in (8) continues, the development takes the peak 
at 17 years old. It is difficult to conclude that the performance 
of motor control function measured by VST takes its peak at 
17 years old. However, this represents the tendency of 
slowdown of the development of our motor control function. 
2) Students in high schools 
In Japan, students in a high school are from 15 years old 
to 18 years old. However, all subjects in this category are 17 
or 18 years old. Fig. 6 shows the distribution of all trials. In 
fig. 6, x-axis represents subject id and y-axis does NSMT. The 
average NSMT is 0.251. 
Using (8), the estimated age of the 0.251 of NSMT is 139 
months. Using (7), the estimated age of the 0.251 of NSMT is 
137 months. This is same as the sixth grade of a primary 
school. The total measurements in a primary school and the 
measurements of 31 high-school students concludes that the 
motor control function of our brain completes its development 
at 12 years old. Of course, there are wide personal derivations. 
3) Comparison between Primary Pupils and High School 
Students 
This paper has no subject in a junior high school. The 
range of ages in junior high school in Japan is from 13 years 
old to 15 years old. This paper compares the last grade of a 
primary school and the high school students. In the last grade, 
we have 66 subjects. However, four measurements have  to 
many errors. Therefore, we reject four measurements, and we 
have 62 valid measurements in the last grade in a primary 
school. We have 31 valid measurements of high school 
students. Table II shows the result of t-test between the pupils 
in sixth grade of a primary school and the students of high 
schools. The NSMT of pupils is larger than the one of high 
schools. However, the probability of both-side in the t-test is 
0.26. Therefore, the t-test shows no difference of distributions. 
The number of subjects in this group is small. We must have 
much larger scale of measurements of VST. 
4) Young people (University Students) 
There are 231 trials. However, there are 18 error 
measurements. As a result, we have 213 valid measurements. 
Table III summarizes the NSMs at each cycle in young people. 
At the first cycle, a subject tries to synchronize his hands’ 
motions with the displayed example motion. The average 
NSM of the first cycle is larger than other cycles. After three 
cycles, a subject completes the synchronization of his hands 
to the displayed motions. The NSMs at cycle 3 to cycle 10 are 
low. At the start of the cycle 11, the example hands image 
disappears. The NSM at the cycle 11 increases a little. The 
differences among cycles are small. Fig. 7 shows the average 
of NSMs in each cycle. 
In our experiments, the memory related to simple motion 
is good in the first five seconds from the disappearance of the 
proposed example motion shown in Fig. 7. After five seconds, 
there is a little loss in motion precision. 
We computed the difference between the distribution of 
the NSMs at the cycle 10 and the distribution of other cycles 
after the cycle 10. 
We confirm that they have the same distributions using t-
test. Table IV shows the probability of sameness of the 
distributions from the one of the cycle 10. Fig. 8 shows the 
probabilities. From cycle 13 to cycle 19, the probabilities are 
decreasing. This shows that the short-term memory of motor

function decrease rapidly. After cycle 20, the subjects lost the 
memory about the motion, and their hands’ motions became 
more randomly. 
With NSMTs, we estimate the performance of the younger 
people in synchronizing their hands’ movement to the 
displayed hands’ movement. Fig. 9 shows the total 
distribution of NSMTs in all trials. In Fig. 9, the x-axis 
represents the trial number. The y-axis is a NSMT. In average, 
NSMT is 0.217, and the standard derivation is 0.0321. Fig. 10 
shows the distribution of NSMTs of younger subjects. The 
NSMTs concentrate around 0.2. Young men show their peak 
of physical development in twenties [17]. 
5) Comparison between high school students and young 
people 
Between the distribution of NSMTs of high school 
students and the one of the young people, t-test shows the 
result of Table V. The both-side probability is only 0.004. 
There is a difference between the result of t-test confirms that 
the distribution of NSMTs of high school students and the one 
of young people. The performance of brain function estimated 
from the VST increases from 18 years old to 24 years old. 
However, the number of subjects of primary school ages are 
large and nearly complete in a region. The number of subjects 
of high school ages are small and selected from total ager’s 
assemblage. The subjects of young people are also selected 
from total ager’s assemblage. The young people are students

of a university. Therefore, the intellectual abilities of our 
subjects of the young people are better than one of total ager’s 
assemblage. 
The difference between high school ages and young 
people may represent the difference of their brain performance 
between different populations. 
The decrease of NSMT per month is 0.000645 from high 
school to young people. This is under one-third of the rate of 
primary school subjects. 
In many fields, developments of human functions show 
growth curve type. The development of brain function 
measured with VST must show the growth curve also. 
6) Comparison between primary school pupil and young 
people 
There is about 10-years difference between sixth grade of 
a primary school and young people. Table VI shows the result 
of t-test between 6th grade of a primary school and young 
people. The t-test confirms that the distribution of 6th grade of 
a primary school differs from one of the young people. 
Using (2), 0.217 of NSMT leads 153.7 months from birth 
as the estimated age. This is one-year difference from the 6th 
grade of a primary school. This confirms that the motor 
control function of our brain slowdown its development over 
12 years old. 
7) Manhood people 
Fig. 11 shows the distribution of measurements of all trials. 
In fig. 11, x-axis is the age of a subject and y-axis is the NSMT. 
We cannot find the relation between age and NSMTs. The 
average NSMT is 0.31886. In the distribution, there are some 
error measurements. Therefore, the author rejects the 
measurements over 0.6 NSMTs. Over 0.6 NSMT, subjects 
have some healthy problems. In the case, the average of under 
0.6 NSMTs is 0.296. This is also a little worth than the 
students of high schools. The number of subjects is not large 
enough to estimate the change of the performance of VST with 
aging. 
With stability in standing posture, we can find the effect of 
aging after 60 years old [18]. The result of this paper shows 
same tendency. 
8) Elderly people 
Table VII summarizes the NSMs at each cycle in elderly 
people. At the first cycle, an elderly subject synchronizes his 
hands’ motions to the displayed example motion. The average 
NSM of the first cycle is larger than other cycles. After six 
cycles, a subject finishes to synchronize his hands to the 
displayed motions. The NSMs at cycle 4 to cycle 10 are low. 
At the start of the cycle 11, the displayed example hands image 
disappears. The NSM increases from cycle 11 to cycle 14. The 
differences between cycles are not large. Fig. 12 shows the 
average of NSMs in each cycle.

We have 158 NSMTs of young people and 27 NSMTs of 
elderly people. On average, the NSMTs of young people are 
smaller than the NSMTs of elderly people. However, we need 
to check the reliability. We make t-test with these two groups 
of NSMTs. Table VIII shows the result of the t-test. The 
probability of being the same is less than 10-9. The deference 
between young people and elderly people is significant. This 
implies that NSMT can measure the deterioration because of 
the aging process. There is an apparent difference between 
NSMs of young people and ones of elderly people, as shown 
in Fig. 7 and Fig. 12. 
 
In elderly people, the deterioration of motor control 
function increases with the aging process. Fig. 13 shows the 
relation between the age and the NSMT of each elderly person. 
The correlation coefficient between the age and the NSMT of

elderly people is 0.467. There is a linear relation between the 
age and the NSMT. The linear approximation is (9). 
NSMT = 0.0088a − 0.26 
 
(9) 
In (9), NSMT is the performance measure of motor control 
function. a is the years from birth of a subject. The age ranges 
from 66 years old to 83 years old. 
From (9), we have (10) that estimates the age from NSMT.  
 
NSMA = 114NSMT + 29.5 
 
(10) 
In (10), NSMA is an aging years of motor control function. 
NSMT is a measured NSM at a trial. This shows the 
measurement of motor control function can estimate the aging 
of a brain function of elderly people. 
The average of NSMTs is about 0.22 in young people. If 
the deterioration of motor control function shows a linear 
relation with the years from birth of a subject from the start of 
the deterioration, we can estimate the motor control function 
age with (10) over 53 years old people. 
The average of NSMTs is about 0.30 in manhood people. 
If the deterioration of motor control function shows a linear 
relation. From (10), we have 63.7 years old as the age starting 
the deterioration with aging process. About 64 years old 
agrees the starting age of deterioration of aging discussed in 
[18]. 
9) Comparison between manhood people and elderly 
people 
The average NSMT of manhood people is 0.296. With 
(10), the 0.296 of NSMT relates to the estimated age 63.2 
years old. Of course, the number of subjects is not enough. 
The estimation of the starting point of aging is not 63 years 
old. There are some personal differences of NSMT. Using the 
normal distribution of NSMTs in manhood people, we have 
the distribution of starting point of aging. The distribution of 
manhood people is 0.0632. This leads seven years’ 
distribution from the average 63.2 years old. The effects of 
aging about VST start from 56 years old to 70 years old. 
Therefore, we need much more subjects in this range of aging. 
10) Total tendency of development and deterioration with 
aging 
From the age of a primary school to elderly people, the 
outline of the development of motor control function and the 
deterioration is observed from many experiments shown 
before. We can summarize the experiments into a total view 
of development and deterioration of motor control function 
measured with VST. Fig. 14 shows the total tendency. In Fig. 
14, some parts do not relate the ages of subjects. However, 
they are high school students and young people. High school 
students are 18 years old. The young peoples are from 22 to 
24 years old. The average of the ages of young people is 23 
years old.

In Fig. 14, x-axis is the age of a subject or the average ages 
of the subjects’ group. In the figure, the range of manhood 
includes small number of subjects. However, the total view of 
Fig. 14 shows the outline of the development and the 
deterioration of the performance measured with VST. 
Fig. 14 clearly shows the development and the 
deterioration with aging. Over 65 years old, a subjects show 
the NSMT under 0.2. These subjects keep their performance 
of motor control function in their ages. 
In Fig. 14, we can see the outline of the development and 
the deterioration of a motor control function measured by VST. 
The tendency shown in Fig. 14 agrees the tendency of 
development in [17] and the tendency of deterioration of aging 
in [18]. 
B. Phases  
The phase of the measured motion represents the timing of 
motion. In precise measurements, phases show apparent 
difference between the first period where the example motion 
is displayed and the second period where the example is not 
displayed in a trial. In the part from cycle 1 to cycle 10, the 
phases keep a similar value. From cycle 11, the phases change 
gradually. This represents the difference between the speed of 
the example motion and one of the memorized motions. From 
this phase change, we can measure the difference of timings 
between the example motion and the memorized motion.  
There is no precise measurement about subjects in a 
primary school and manhood people.  
1) Pupil in Primary school 
In a primary school, we have only simple type 
measurements. In simple type measurement, we cannot have 
the phase change after the displayed hands’ images 
disappeared. However, we can have the phase stability. 
Table IX shows the average phase change between 
adjacent cycles. Fig. 15 shows the average phase changes of 
first grade, third grade and sixth grade. In Fig. 15, full line 
represents the first grade in a primary school. A chain line does 
the third grade. And, another line does the sixth grade. In Fig. 
15, there is an apparent decrease of the average phase changes 
between adjacent cycles with growth. The phase changes 
between adjacent cycles decrease with getting older. In Table 
IX, we can find the development of motor control function. 
However, phases in VST have large distributions among 
subjects. Therefore, personal analysis of a subject is difficult. 
Fig. 16 shows the average phase changes among grades in 
a primary school. We can see an apparent progress of motor 
control function with getting older in Fig. 16. 
2)  High School Students 
High-school students made simple type measurements. 
Fig. 17 shows the phase changes of high-school students and 
the sixth grade of a primary school. In Fig. 17, the phase 
changes of high-school students is less than ones of sixth-
grade pupils in a primary school. In averages, phase change of 
high-school students is 0.227. The average phase change of 
sixth-grade pupils in a primary school is 0.274. The average 
phase change of high-school student is 18% smaller than one 
of the sixth-grade pupils in a primary school. This shows the 
development of motor control function as NSMTs. 
3) Young people 
We assume that the phase change in the first part of a trial 
is smaller than the phase change in the second part of the trial. 
We divided all cycles into three sections. To confirm this 
assumption, we calculate the linear approximation of the 
phases in each section. The first section starts from cycle 4, 
and ends at cycle10. The second section starts from cycle 11, 
and ends at cycle 17. The third section starts from cycle 17, 
and ends at cycle 23, as shown in Fig. 4. In 158 valid trials, 
there are delay and advance in phases. We evaluate phase 
change in absolute value. 
Table X shows the averages of the slant of each section. 
The average absolute slant of phases in the first section is 
smaller than the one in the second section and the third section.

Fig. 18 shows this relation. In Fig. 18, there is an apparent 
increase of phase changes in second and third sections. 
Statistically, the first section and the second section have 
difference bases. Calculation of the t-test confirms that the 
difference is significant. The t-measure between these two 
sections is over 12. The probability is under 10-26. The t-
measure between the second section and the third section is 
0.18. The probability is over 0.85. This confirms that the 
second and the third sections have a same base. This result 
means that the memory about the timing of motion remains 
for at least 15 seconds. 
4) Manhood peple 
In manhood people, we have only the simple type 
measurements. Fig. 19 shows the average phase changes 
between adjacent cycles. In Fig. 19, the full line represents the 
average of manhood people. The dashed line does one of the 
high-school students. 
The average of manhood people is larger than one of the 
high-school students. In average, the phase change is 0.272. 
This is nearly same as the average of sixth-grade pupil of a 
primary school. These are 20% larger than the average phase 
change of high-school students. 
5) Elderly people 
We also calculate the linear approximation of the phases. 
Table XI shows the average absolute slant of phase’s change 
in each section. 
There are apparent differences of the phase changes 
between young people and elderly people. Elderly people have 
some difficulties to keep the pace of flipping their hands. In 
phases, it is difficult to find the proper scale representing an 
aging process. 
C. Discussion  
With the NSMs, there is no apparent change between with 
and without a displayed motion example. Before 15 seconds,

there is little decay of the memory of motion. After 16 seconds, 
Fig. 3 shows a little increase of the NSMs. 
With the phases, there is an apparent difference between 
with and without a displayed motion example. The changes of 
measured phases represent an error in the timing of a measured 
motion. Some trials show delay and others show advance. The 
phase change shows the error about the memory of the timing. 
The proposed method measures the timing and the process of 
movements. A classical tapping test measures the timing only. 
However, in this experiment, the difference of 0.001 radian in 
phase is the difference of 0.00016 seconds in time. The 
proposed timing measure about motor function based on the 
phase of the basic movement is very keen. The classical 
tapping test can measure the difference of 0.0001 seconds now. 
However, the mechanical features about a hand and a switch 
make it difficult to measure the small difference of time. 
Fig. 20 shows the average phase change between adjacent 
cycles. Elderly peoples need seven cycles to synchronize their 
hands’ movements to the displayed hands’ movement. The 
average phase change between the third cycle and tenth cycle 
is 0.37. This is about 0.1 larger than one of the manhood 
people. 
Elderly people has much difficulty about synchronizing 
his hands’ movement to the displayed movement. The phase 
changes between adjacent cycles may have the role to evaluate 
the performance of motor control function. However, the 
phase change can have large dependency to the NSM. In the 
case, we can use only NSM. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
This paper proposes the pair of the measurement and 
evaluation method of motor control function to estimate whole 
image of the development and the deterioration with an aging 
process. The proposed method is implemented and tested in 
experiments. The proposed visual synchronization task is easy 
to perform. For instance, it needs only 25 seconds. The 
proposed Non-Smoothness Measure has enough power of 
discrimination of a motor control function. The phase changes 
also have enough power to measure the very small error in 
timing remembered. 
The experimental results confirm that the proposed 
method can measure and evaluate the development and 
deterioration of a motor control function with an aging process 
precisely. This paper proposed the total view of the 
development and deterioration of the performance of motor 
control function from six years old to 80 years old, and 
developed a method to estimate the age according to the aging 
process of the motor control function in some age groups. In 
the age group over 65 years old, the estimated age from 
NSMT helps to measure the deterioration of the brain function, 
and it can detect the very first stage of cognitive impairment. 
In the age group in a primary school, the estimated age from 
NSMT may work for the index of developmental disorder. 
Many experiments outlined the development and 
deterioration of the performance of motor control function 
with aging process. This helps the understanding of 
developments and deteriorations of brain function with aging 
process. 
We will perform larger-scale experiments in the next step 
for more precise understanding of developments and 
deteriorations with aging process.
