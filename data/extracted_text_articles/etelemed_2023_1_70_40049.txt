Utilizing Ethereum Blockchain  
 
 
Abstract— In this paper, we propose an enhanced 
framework based on Ethereum blockchain technology for the 
healthcare sector. Currently, healthcare systems are often 
centralized, with a single entity controlling and managing 
patient data. This can make it difficult for patients to access 
and share their medical information, while also creating 
potential security risks. Furthermore, existing frameworks 
may not be able to manage large amounts of data due to 
Ethereum's 
scalability 
limitations. 
An 
Ethereum-based 
framework utilizing blockchain technology could help address 
these issues by providing a decentralized and secure system, 
giving patients greater control over their data and reducing the 
risk of unauthorized access. Additionally, Ethereum-based 
smart contracts could automate various healthcare processes, 
such as claims processing and appointment scheduling, 
improving efficiency and reducing administrative costs. This 
paper contributes to the development of such a framework by 
utilizing Apache Kafka techniques to build a private Ethereum 
blockchain that improves scalability and generates immutable 
and secure records via smart contract-generated hashes as it is 
immutable, secure and scalable.

INTRODUCTION  
By enhancing the security and interoperability of 
electronic medical records (EMRs) [1] and opening up new 
use cases like clinical trial data sharing and precision 
medicine, blockchain technology has the potential to 
completely transform the healthcare sector. 
   The ability to create a safe, decentralized record-keeping 
system is one of the key advantages of adopting blockchain 
in healthcare. EMRs can be stored on a blockchain, enabling 
healthcare providers to access and update them in real time 
while maintaining a tamper-proof record of all changes. 
This can help to reduce errors and improve the accuracy of 
medical records [2]. 
    Another potential use case for blockchain in healthcare is 
the sharing of clinical trial data. By using a decentralized 
platform, researchers can securely share data with one 
another and with regulatory agencies, helping to accelerate 
the development of new treatments and therapies. 
Precision medicine is another area where blockchain could 
have a significant impact. By using blockchain-based 
platforms, healthcare providers can securely share and 
access genomic data, enabling them to tailor treatments to 
the specific needs of individual patients. 
Overall, the use of blockchain in healthcare [3][4] has the 
potential 
to 
improve 
the 
security, 
efficiency, 
and 
interoperability of the industry, leading to better outcomes 
for patients. 
 
Transparency and communication between patients and 
healthcare providers have improved as a result of the usage 
of blockchain technology in the healthcare sector. Because of 
duplications, the use of various names and identities, and 
their availability across many networks, healthcare records 
are becoming larger and more complicated, but they have not 
yet been optimised for these characteristics. Additionally, it 
is now crucial to maintain data security and stop illicit 
activity. Patient data can be utilised or sold if unauthorised 
people are permitted access, and everyone with access will 
be able to see the personal information of the patients. Data 
privacy for patients is essential for effective healthcare 
administration[1]. 
 
We are proposing that every time doctors meet a patient, 
information 
on 
underlying 
illnesses, 
food 
or 
drug 
sensitivities, and prescribed drugs must be gathered. In order 
to effectively diagnose and treat patients, these data allow for 
the reduction of needless laboratory or imaging procedures. 
Physicians can access medical information about patients 
who often attend an emergency department (ED) [5] without 
the need for an extra report. 
 
In Malaysia, medical records are still commonly 
transmitted through paper or telephone when patients elect to 
shift from one hospital to another. This is often referred to as 
the "discharge summary" process, where the patient's 
medical records are printed out and given to the patient to be 
carried to the next hospital, or are sent through fax or email. 
However, the adoption of digital medical records in Malaysia 
still faces challenges, such as limited funding and technical 
infrastructure, as well as concerns around data privacy and 
security. It is important for healthcare providers and 
policymakers to continue to work towards a more seamless 
and secure system for sharing medical records, while also 
addressing these challenges and ensuring the privacy and 
security of patient data. In contrast, it can be challenging to 
learn a patient's whole medical history when they 
unexpectedly visit a neighboring hospital, particularly in an 
emergency, as patients sometimes forget specifics about their 
former illnesses, dosages, or drug usage. Personal health 
records (PHRs) connected to hospitals can offer reliable data, 
but if the hospital does not create and distribute PHRs, the 
information is not accessible electronically [6]. 
The paper is organized into several sections, each with a 
specific focus. In Section 2, the authors address objections 
that may arise regarding the proposed health record 
management platform. Section 3 provides background 
information, including a discussion of Blockchain in 
Healthcare and a review of prior system architectures. This 
section helps to contextualize the proposed platform and its 
potential benefits. Section 4 is dedicated to the proposed 
platform itself, which is blockchain-based and utilizes Kafka, 
smart contract hash architecture. This section provides a

Section 5 covers the performance metrics, providing a 
quantitative analysis of the platform's capabilities. In Section 
6, the authors offer a discussion of the platform, including its 
strengths and weaknesses, and consider how it could be

that can be drawn from the proposed platform and its

authors include Acknowledgments and References sections. 
The organization of the paper helps to provide a clear and 
concise understanding of the proposed health record 
management platform and its potential benefits for the 
healthcare industry. 
II. 
OBJECTIVES  
In the envisaged architecture, the blockchain regulates the 
authorization of data transfers between patients, healthcare 
providers, and other users. The blockchain uses Apache 
Kafka to scale the incoming data and manage it in 
immutable logs. The blockchain does not physically replace 
the electronic health record system since the majority of 
hospital information systems store comprehensive Personal 
Health Records (PHRs) in a secure database on site or in a 
backup location outside the hospital. Only the data's 
security, confidentiality, integrity, and availability [3] are 
ensured by the blockchain's design. Stakeholders have 
access to read and write electronic health record data that 
can be securely sent to and from other systems via the 
blockchain. 
The main contributions of this paper are: 
• 
To present the proposed framework for the health 
information records on Ethereum blockchain. 
• 
To present comprehensive literature for readers 
relating Blockchain in Healthcare and on security 
and privacy of the Electronic Health Record (EHR) 
and Personal Health Records (PHR). 
• 
To provide an understanding of the state-of-the-art 
techniques implemented in the healthcare and 
blockchain 
• 
To get cryptographic security visa Hash code in 
smart contracts which are only accessible to the 
designated personnel. 
• 
This architecture is formed via a private P2P 
network, where health records are organized into 
data blocks comprising a linked list and a 
distributed ledger of health data. 
• 
This 
architecture 
introduced 
the 
blockchain 
scalability issue with the data management can be 
an issue. The proposed framework not only address 
the security as well as scalability of data while 
using blockchain. 
III. 
BACKGROUND 
Blockchain technology is based on cryptography, which 
is used to secure transactions and ensure the privacy of 
users. Two key cryptographic concepts used in blockchain 
are hashing and smart contracts [4][16][17]. 
Hashing is the process of taking an input (or "message") 
and returning a fixed-size string of characters, which is 
called the "hash." The same input will always produce the 
same hash, but even a small change to the input will produce 
a very different hash. This makes it useful for verifying the 
integrity of data, as any changes to the input will result in a 
different hash [8]. 
Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the 
terms of the agreement written directly into code. They 
allow for the automation of certain processes, such as the 
transfer of assets. They are stored and replicated on the 
blockchain network, and can be programmed to trigger 
actions based on specific events or conditions. 
It is important to note that as the technology and 
understanding of blockchain is evolving rapidly, new 
research and literature is being produced frequently. Google 
is showing the recent trends in the Health Information 
Exchange.  
 
 
Figure1. Global Health Information Exchange (HIE) google trend analysis 
(Past 5 years 2018-2022) 
 
In order to facilitate exchange agreements between 
hospitals, clinical areas, regulators, insurers, and even 
patients, HIE network organizations have developed. They 
guarantee to offer genuine integrated health systems with 
support for Electronic Health Records (EHR). The evidence 
that is now available continues to point to these systems' 
incapacity to satisfactorily serve stakeholder demands. This 
present architecture has been under fire for being opaque 
and having a centralized authority for failure, attack, and 
ownership. Through intentional or unintentional behaviors 
of these intermediaries, a lack of confidence regarding the 
security and privacy of entrusted patient information is 
growing [4].

A. Blockchain In healthcare 
1) Study Rationale 
 
 
The trust gap prevalent in conventional HIE continues to 
be revealed as a result of competing interests, the inability of 
traditional HIE and PHR-based exchanges to deliver on the 
promise of a shared, integrated EHR, and a number of other 
factors. This distrust has grown as a result of privacy 
regulations and data breach incidents. Stakeholders are 
reluctant to cooperate or collaborate at the levels necessary 
for shared value as a result. The effect is lower health 
outcomes and rising healthcare expenses. Figure 1 shows the 
Google patterns over the past 20 years, which may help to

understand why HIE has attracted attention consistently over 
that time [4][5]. 
 
If this tendency is a clear indicator of contemporary 
global interests in Figure 2 it follows that these difficulties 
persist despite ten years of technical progress. We speculate 
that one major reason for the lack of advancement may be 
the trust gap. Blockchain is currently being used by 
researchers to assist solve some of these trust-related 
problems. The rising surge of interest in blockchain in 
healthcare has been stoked by this and a number of other 
factors.. The study in [4] was commissioned to learn more 
about this field of study and how it has developed. 
2) Prior System Architectures 
 
The following two prior Ethereum based architectures 
have been analyzing because the recent blockchain usage is 
primarily based on Ethereum due to its smart contract-based 
technology. The properties of the mentioned architectures 
are far better than the previous blockchain based 
architecture in previous years. These two are the latest to 
smart frameworks which are managing the data for health 
records. Data sharing that is both secure and scalable is 
necessary for group clinical decision-making. However, 
conventional 
clinical 
data 
initiatives 
are 
frequently 
segregated, 
which 
obstructs 
effective 
information 
interchange and hinders treatment decisions for patients [5]. 
The following restrictions apply to the Ficain DApp 
because it was created using various presumptions: 
• 
Has no mention of semantic interoperability. 
The semantic interoperability problems that the 
FHIR standards have not yet completely 
accounted for cannot be solved by FHIRChain. 
Therefore, manual examination and mapping of 
preset ontologies by professionals in the fields 
of medicine and health data are needed to offer 
semantics to clinical data, and this will continue 
to be the major topic of our future research in 
this area. 
• 
With older systems that do not support FHIR, 
compatibility issues might arise. Many historical 
systems may employ other communications 
norms, such as the more widely used HL7 v2 
norms. 
• 
It 
cannot 
prevent 
medical 
malpractice. 
Clinicians who are interested in working 
together to provide clinical decision assistance 
for patients in remote locations are the target 
users of FHIRChain. Our present design 
assumes that users won't abuse, mishandle, or 
unethically 
disseminate 
the 
data 
they 
communicate over our DApp. 
• deployment fees for DApps. Contrary to popular public 
blockchains like Ethereum, our DApp is created 
utilising a private testnet with no transaction fees (e.g., 
transaction fees). Therefore, if our DApp was made 
available on a public blockchain, it would not be free. 
However, the ease of use offered by a public 
blockchain may make it more affordable to use than it 
would be to buy, operate, and maintain a proprietary 
clinical data exchange infrastructure [5]. 
The architecture, known as Ancile [6], combines smart 
contracts on an Ethereum-based blockchain for improved 
access control and data obfuscation in addition to advanced 
cryptographic techniques for added safety. In order to 
understand how the framework could address chronic 
privacy and security challenges in the healthcare industry, 
this article will look at how Ancile interacts with the diverse 
expectations of patients, providers, and other parties. 
Multiple parties may safely interact with the blockchain and 
its data thanks to Ancile. Ancile prioritizes secure contact, 
therefore the architecture we provide contains a number of 
additions intended to boost privacy and interoperability. The 
Ancile blockchain, in contrast to other blockchain EHR 
systems that have been developed, first maintains hashes of 
the data references while transferring the actual query link 
information in a private transaction via HTTPS. 
The patient's ownership rights are the main emphasis of 
design. As a result, our design adheres to the notion that the 
patient owns the data and that it is not a commodity to be 
traded. As a result, Ancile does not include any mining 
incentives beyond the requirement to utilize the system. 
We believe that governments and service providers 
already have an incentive to protect patient medical 
information. On the blockchain, we also take into 
consideration the various roles played by patients, providers, 
and third parties by using smart contract capabilities for 
access control. This enables the stratification of jobs to better 
serve the various demands of users [12]. 
It is important to note that many of the technologies used 
in the proposed Ethereum-based healthcare framework, such 
as permissioned blockchains and smart contracts, are still in 
the early stages of development. Therefore, the success of the 
framework is highly dependent on the success of these 
technologies. It should also be noted that the proposed 
solution, Ancile, should not be seen as a complete solution to 
the larger issue of Electronic Health Record (EHR) security. 
While it provides a method for re-encrypting a symmetric 
key using proxies selected by the patient in a pseudo-random 
manner, compliance with legal requirements for medical data 
and patient privacy protection requires that the proxy group 
and RC must have been formed beforehand using blockchain 
technology. Now that we know that blockchain technology is 
suffering from scalability issue Anicle [6], wouldn’t 
recommend solution.  
The PHR blockchain architecture created in this study 
provides an effective solution for the management and usage 
of PHRs. The platform was originally presented in Southeast 
Asian countries through the Asia eHealth Information 
Network, [7] and it is currently the first PHR management 
platform for cross-regional medical data exchange (AeHIN).  
 
In order to transmit, store, and share PHR data securely 
between patients and medical healthcare providers, a 
blockchain-based 
PHR 
exchange 
architecture 
and 
management platform was developed. Among its features are 
the ability to see PHRs for personal health management, 
exchange PHRs with a physician, and perform security 
checks on blockchain data. The PHR administration 
component's user interface has also been developed.

IV. 
PROPOSED HEALTH RECORD MANAGEMENT 
PLATFORM BLOCKCHAIN BASED KAFKA SMART 
CONTRACT HASH ARCHITECTURE 
 
The study saved smart contract hash values in a 
blockchain to safeguard the PHR data and verify the 
accuracy of the PHR contents since blocks in a blockchain 
cannot be tampered with or maliciously altered. The 
blockchain architecture employed was Ethereum's private 
chain, and the Ethereum protocol's Geth (Go Ethereum) 
application was used to move transactions from the 
proposed platform to the blockchain exchange framework, 
produce new blocks, and establish a connection to the 
blockchain. as seen in Figure 4. 
   The data are encrypted while being transmitted over the 
network to prevent private information from being 
compromised. To protect the user's privacy, the platform 
encrypts the health record before uploading it to the safe 
database. A malicious attacker will only succeed in getting a 
set of random numbers if they try to access the block 
content. The encryption process combines asymmetric 
encryption with hash encryption. The block content is 
secured using a hash encryption method that transforms data 
into a collection of hexadecimal characters using SHA-
256[9][13]. 
 For scalability of data on the blockchain Apache Kafka 
has been introduced. The data blocks in the super peer’s 
network are distributed using the Apache Kafka platform. 
By expanding its producer and consumer classes, which 
represent client nodes delivering and receiving data locks, 
respectively, Kafka abstracts application concerns about 
data replication [10][14][15]. 
To understand the dynamics of the apache Kafka and 
components the Figure 3 is displaying.  
 
 
 
Figure 3. Apache Kafka Structure 
 
Below Figure 4 shows the architecture of the Apache 
Kafka build Ethereum blockchain. The most well-liked 
distributed publish-subscribe messaging system is Kafka. 
Topics, brokers, producers, and consumers make up it. 
Topics are how Kafka groups a stream of messages. The 
producer sends out streaming messages, which are then 
retrieved by the consumer. One or more servers, referred to 
as brokers, make up a Kafka, which collects and stores data 
reliably before publishing relevant topics. Kafka cluster node 
status is monitored using Apache Zookeeper. A broker 
receives messages from producers. The customer obtains this 
information without any loss, and the broker retains it. 
(Performance Evaluation of Intrusion Detection Streaming 
Transactions Using Apache Kafka and Spark Streaming). 
Figure 4. Proposed Private Blockchain built with Apache Kafka 
 
Fast in-memory processing is offered by Apache Kafka. 
It is a flexible tool for a wide variety of large data 
processing applications since it is appropriate for both batch 
and streaming data. 
These activities consist of interactive big data searches, 
graph processing, and machine learning [11]. Apache Kafka 
will increase effectiveness: The speed of block formation is 
increased, and waiting times for data interchange are 
decreased. extremely scalable and compatible: Additionally, 
intelligent collaborative construction may be finished. 
 
While Apache Kafka is a powerful tool for real-time 
data processing, it is important to carefully consider its 
potential disadvantages, particularly in terms of system 
complexity, security, and message reliability, when 
evaluating its use for specific applications. Potential 
disadvantage is the complexity of configuring and managing 
a Kafka cluster. Setting up a Kafka cluster requires a deep 
understanding of the underlying system architecture, and 
can be challenging for organizations with limited technical 
expertise. In addition, Kafka lacks robust monitoring and 
management tools, which can make it difficult to diagnose 
and resolve issues when they arise. 
   Kafka's reliance on a publish-subscribe messaging model 
can sometimes result in message loss or duplication. While 
Kafka provides mechanisms for handling these issues, they 
can add additional complexity to the system architecture and 
require careful configuration to ensure reliable data 
processing.

PERFORMANCE METRICS  
Blockchain security can be measured by various 
performance metrics. Some commonly used metrics to 
evaluate blockchain security include: 
Decentralization: This metric measures the distribution of 
control within a blockchain network. A more decentralized 
network [2][3] is considered more secure as it is less 
susceptible to a single point of failure. 
     Consensus mechanism: This metric measures the method 
used to reach agreement on the state of the blockchain. 
19
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2023.     ISBN:  978-1-68558-080-3
eTELEMED 2023 : The Fifteenth International Conference on eHealth, Telemedicine, and Social Medicine

Different consensus mechanisms have different security 
properties, and some are considered more secure than 
others. 
      Hash rate: This metric measures the computational 
power of a blockchain network, and is an indicator of the 
security of the network against a 51% attack. 
Network size: This metric measures the number of nodes 
in a blockchain network, and is an indicator of the security 
of the network against a Sybil attack [3].Network size will 
be easier to maintain. 
     Smart contract security: This metric measures the 
security of the smart contracts that run on the blockchain. 
Smart contracts can have vulnerabilities that can be 
exploited by attackers, so it is important to ensure that they 
are secure. 
Auditing and testing: This metric measure the extent to 
which the codebase of the blockchain is audited and tested 
for security vulnerabilities [4]. It is important to note that 
security is a complex and multifaceted issue, and no single 
metric can fully capture it. Therefore, it is important to 
consider multiple metrics to get a comprehensive 
understanding [8] of the security of a blockchain. 
 
 
Figure 6. Blockchain generated Smart Contracts and contract calls on 
Ganache 
 
Blockchain technology as in Figure 6, some transactions 
were done to implement private blockchain and it is often 
considered to be a secure and private way to conduct 
transactions, but there are certain factors that can affect the 
privacy of a blockchain network. Some performance metrics 
that can be used to evaluate the privacy of a blockchain 
include: 
Anonymity: This metric measures the degree to which 
users are able to hide their identities on the blockchain. 
Anonymity can be achieved through techniques such as 
zero-knowledge proofs, ring signatures, and coin mixing. 
Confidentiality: This metric measures the degree to 
which the details of transactions are kept private. 
Confidentiality can be achieved through techniques such as 
confidential transactions and zero-knowledge proofs. 
Traceability: This metric measures the degree to which 
the transactions on the blockchain can be traced to specific 
individuals. Some blockchain networks, such as Bitcoin, 
have a high degree of traceability, while others, such as 
Monero, have been designed to provide a high degree of 
privacy. 
Scalability: This metric with use of Apache Kafka will 
increase 6 times to manage the implementation with 
proposed framework. 
Network analysis: This metric measures the degree to 
which the blockchain network can be analyzed to reveal 
information about the users and their transactions. 
Data protection and encryption: This will potentially 
increase 80 times increasing the data protection via Apache 
Kafka. This metric measures the level of data protection and 
encryption implemented in the blockchain network to ensure 
the privacy of the data. 
It is important to note that even though blockchain 
technology has some features that ensure privacy and 
security, it is not completely private. There are also other 
factors that can affect the privacy of a blockchain, such as 
the regulatory environment and the use of third-party 
services. 
VI. 
DISCUSSION 
This framework A blockchain-based personal health 
record (PHR)/EHR system has the potential to transform the 
PHR/EHR industry by providing a secure, decentralized, 
and tamper-proof way to store and share health information. 
One of the main benefits of using a blockchain for PHR is 
the increased security it provides. Blockchain technology is 
inherently secure, as it uses advanced cryptography to 
ensure that once data is entered into the blockchain, it 
cannot be altered or deleted. This would help to prevent 
unauthorized access to sensitive health information and 
protect patients' privacy. Additionally, a blockchain-based 
PHR system would allow patients to have full control over 
their health data, enabling them to share their records with 
medical professionals and other authorized parties as 
needed. This would reduce the need for paper records and 
improve the speed and efficiency of care. Another potential 
benefit of using a blockchain for PHR is that it would enable 
the creation of a decentralized network of health data, 
allowing for better data sharing and collaboration among 
healthcare providers. This would enable healthcare 
providers to access a patient's complete health history, 
which could help to improve patient outcomes and reduce 
healthcare costs. 
However, it is important to note that this technology is 
still in its early stages and there are still several challenges 
that need to be addressed such as data privacy, data security, 
interoperability, data sharing regulation and standardization. 
We have created smart contracts and also worked on the 
Ethereum blockchain build with Apache Kafka where the 
scalability issue can be solved for the Ethereum blockchain 
in-case of wide adoption of the blockchain technology.  
Work is in progress to create a complete interface for 
implementation of the proposed methodology majorly work 
remaining on the UI/UX off the health application and 
connecting the Ethereum blockchain build with Kafka and 
then the smart contracts with personal health records are 
saved in the  
VII. CONCLUSION 
Blockchain-based architecture is a distributed database 
system that uses a chain of blocks to store data in a 
decentralized manner. This architecture is highly secure, 
transparent, and immutable, making it useful for a wide 
range of applications. However, one of the main challenges 
with blockchain-based systems, including Ethereum, is 
scalability. This is due to the consensus mechanism, which 
requires all nodes in the network to process every 
transaction. To address this challenge, our proposed 
20

framework combines Ethereum with Apache Kafka, a 
highly scalable and high-performance messaging platform. 
The key features of our proposed architecture include 
decentralization, scalability, immutability, security, and 
transparency to increase potentially 6 times than the current 
available solutions. Decentralization ensures that the 
database is distributed across a network of computers, 
making it difficult for any one party to manipulate the data. 
Immutability ensures that once data has been added to the 
blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring the 
integrity of the records. Security is ensured through the use 
of cryptographic techniques, which prevent unauthorized 
access to the data. Transparency is provided by recording all 
transactions and changes to the database, which can be 
viewed by all parties. 
Our proposed framework uses Apache Kafka as the 
underlying messaging platform for the Ethereum-based 
blockchain system, which offloads some of the workload 
from the Ethereum nodes and distributes it across a Kafka 
cluster. This improves the scalability of the system, allowing 
it to handle large volumes of data in real-time. 
In summary, the use of a blockchain-based architecture 
can help to create secure, transparent, and decentralized 
record-keeping systems. Our proposed framework addresses 
the scalability challenge of Ethereum by using Apache 
Kafka, making it useful for a wide range of applications 
VIII. FUTURE DIRECTIONS 
Our proposed blockchain-based Personal Health Records 
(PHR) framework has several important points that make it 
a suitable candidate for full implementation: 
Firstly, PHRs are critical for the foundation of precision 
medicine, which is the future of healthcare. Our PHR 
framework has the potential to be implemented on a large 
scale due to its scalability feature, which enables PHRs to be 
exchanged between nations and allows for potential 
precision medicine uses in the future. Secondly, financial 
data management systems have already successfully 
employed blockchain technology to secure data security and 
privacy. With improved system specifications and a greater 
private blockchain, work can be done to scale the 
framework and improve the user interface and user 
experience. Thirdly, the current global operations require 
the 
development 
of 
a 
cross-country 
medical 
care 
infrastructure, and our proposed blockchain-based PHR 
framework can play a significant role in this infrastructure. 
Lastly, by building the blockchain on a sidechain with better 
system specifications, we can yield better results, and smart 
contract transactions can be managed more effectively. 
Overall, our proposed blockchain-based PHR framework 
has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry by 
providing a secure, transparent, and decentralized record-
keeping system for patients' medical records. It is now time 
to move forward with full implementation of the proposed 
methodology.
