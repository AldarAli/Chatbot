Abstract- This paper aims to improve Personal Information 
systems (PIMs) by understanding how people manage personal 
information items usually kept on notes, cards, agendas, etc., 
and on administration forms (paper or digital). The focus is 
both on what people say about information content, 
organization, trust, willingness to share and on how people 
categorize information. Preliminary studies (focus group and 
questionnaire) looked at how people describe their own use of 
information, and their views on future PIMs needs. They show 
a strong distrust towards such systems and reluctance to share 
personal information. Another study (card-sorting) looks at the 
way people assign individual information items to self-created 
categories. Results show a few variations in structure and 
naming, with a gender effect for category size. Detailed 
clustering and co-occurrence analyses show small differences 
between how people actually organize their personal 
information and our initial "theoretical" assignment. While 
the results suggest some modifications of the information 
structure and content, it supports the user-centric approach of 
the study, starting from user needs and associated documents, 
experimental testing and design iterations, which could be 
generalized for designing usable PIMs. 
Keywords - personal information items, PIMs, semantic 
categories,  naming, e-gov. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Conducted within project PIMI (Personal Information 
Management through Internet), which goal is to develop a 
design environment and a deployment platform providing 
users with personal data access and services relevant to their 
needs, this study aims at gaining knowledge about the way 
users manage their information and services, how they see 
doing it in the future, and what should be the information 
content, structure and naming in a PIMI. Also, which items 
can be shared and other issues such as security and trust. 
In recent years, computing technology (including Internet 
and mobiles) has increased capabilities for managing the 
large information sets needed in everyday life, professional 
or non-professional. Part of that information refers to 
personal data that users might decide to share or not through 
their relationships with other users (e.g., social networks) 
and applications (e.g., e-government services). Stimulated by 
the recent evolution of national governments policies 
towards the improvement of electronic services, e-
government applications tend to require personal information 
for accessing public e-services such as in healthcare, taxes, 
housing, agriculture, education, social services [1]. 
Managing large sets of information is strongly related to 
the domain of Personal Information Management systems 
(PIMs), which corresponds [2] [3] to the research field 
addressing the way people manage their physical documents 
(books, notebooks, sheets, etc.), as well as their electronic 
documents (files, emails, Web pages, etc.), with the aim of 
designing tools that support the management of electronic 
documents (PIM tools). PIMs studies have mostly focused 
on very large data sets, such as the full content of user hard 
drive, and on search issues pointing out the large variability 
in people information search [3].  
While the PIMs area usually covers many contexts and 
activities, in this paper we look at PIMs in a more specific 
way: the individual information items people keep on 
various notes, cards, forms, agendas, etc., the ones that are 
personally attached to us, that we use in our every daily life, 
both professional and non-professional (for administrative, 
social, leisure purposes, etc.). It is not the full set of available 
files. Besides, we look at the intuitive way people organize 
their personal information, with or without computer 
systems. Concerning personal information bits currently 
scattered many places, there is little research with a user-
centric approach, with the view that users-based knowledge 
might help specifying computer-based tools.  
This paper starts with a review of literature and publicly 
available tools. Then, preliminary studies briefly report on 
documents analyses and on what people say and wish about 
their personal information. A section describes the method, 
tool, procedure and participants of a card-sorting study on 
people intuitive organization of personal information. The 
results and their impact towards a future PIMI structure are 
presented. The conclusion summarizes the study, identifies 
its limits and provides insight on future research work.

RELATED WORK 
The context is e-gov. (short for electronic government), a 
diffused neologism used to refer to the use of information 
and communication technology to provide and improve 
government services, transactions and interactions with 
citizens, businesses, and other arms of government [4]. 
In the area of e-gov., a literature review [5] showed little 
specifically on human factors in HCI (Human-Computer 
Interaction). Studies identified dealt mainly with user needs 
and accessibility (a major topic in e-gov. HCI, including 
studies on older people), the applicability of HCI results to e-
gov., ad hoc interaction novelties (e.g., animated faces), ad 
hoc methods (e.g., on document exchange and scenario

planning), issues of user involvement and requirements, user 
acceptance, and patterns. 
About PIMs, a more substantial body of knowledge in 
many different settings has begun to pile up in recent years 
[6] [7]. There is a lot of technical aspects such as: data 
synchronization across devices, version control [8], file 
management and applications [9], collective work and file 
sharing [10], novel user interface paradigms and mobility 
[11] [12], ontologies [13], and tools based on information 
association [14] [15].  
There are also usability, citizen-centric studies, mainly 
about: privacy and security [16], hierarchical files structure 
issues and proposal for a tagging mechanism [17], studies 
following-up on [3, op. cit.], such as: further empirical 
investigation on ways to improve information searching [18], 
investigation of the role of personal notes [19], contextual 
use of PIMs [20], tool evaluation [21], and call for more 
user-centered studies, long-term studies on the evolution of 
user information practice from one work context to another, 
from a role to another [22]. In light of our goals, a few points 
can be selected from these studies. 
One point is that hierarchical structure is the most used 
and preferred by users [23] [24] [25] [26]. The latter study 
actually shows that users built an ownership and control 
feeling about their data, probably due to long use of such 
tools. However, users have difficulties in creating consistent 
structures and naming items categories. More specifically, 
categorizing and naming new items in an existing structure 
seems to be difficult and represent a high cognitive load [24, 
op. cit.], [25, op. cit.]. Adding contextual data, such as tags, 
may help, but tagging may vary from one user to the other, 
and will not solve consistency issues, particularly when 
information spaces are to be shared, even partly. An 
interesting addition to contextual data from sensors (GPS, 
GSM, and movement) has shown to help find images within 
a collection [27].  
About search strategies, users tend to first explore the 
structure, and use search tools only afterwards. Even though 
it may be explained by lack of user knowledge [26, op. cit.], 
the lack of flexibility of these tools may still apply [3, op. 
cit.]. 
One particularly pervasive PIM problem is information 
fragmentation [28], i.e., when information related to a single 
task is scattered across several different applications and 
environments. A typical example is project information, 
where specifications may be in a Word document, budget in 
an Excel file, communication with the customer and the 
project manager may be in emails, and other resources may 
reside in Intranet or the Web. A project member may have 
seen all these documents but may later have trouble re-
accessing them. In [28, op. cit.] it is argued that grouping 
related information is a central PIM activity currently 
hindered by the artificial separation imposed by the different 
applications. In addition, history and versioning must be 
dealt with. 
On the practical side, [28, op. cit.] suggest 5 factors that 
may hinder PIMs use: visibility, integration, co-adoption, 
scalability, return on investment. In absence of visibility, 
when the PIM is not always visible to the user, the tendency 
is to forget it, as well as the data already stored. Integration: 
when not integrated with the other tools, it can be underused. 
Co-adoption: for user cooperation, share and synchronization 
of data (e.g., appointments, agenda) is required, if not 
available the PIM might not be used. Scalability: the PIM 
tool must allow scaling (e.g., more data, projects). Return on 
investment: if the tool requires a large learning effort, it will 
not be used. Guidelines are also offered by [26, op. cit.], 
along three types of strategies: piling, filing, and structuring. 
Concerning information transfer, results of a survey with 
47 participants [30] showed that the main forms of PIM 
storage are computers, then external disk drives. For Web 
sites, the ordered storage preferences are bookmarks, email, 
paper. When data transfer, it is done mainly with email and 
memory sticks, and in some cases on web sites. The main 
difficulty is finding the files. The results also point out the 
important role of email systems in storage, sharing, search, 
and file exchange between computers and other devices. 
In our research, the attempt is to complement these 
earlier findings, first on what people say (in terms of 
information items, of current practice, of shareability, etc.), 
but also focus on a novel issue: what people do intuitively 
with an existing set of unstructured information items.  
We also looked at 15 tools [31] that claim to support 
personal information management. Most tools (Tools # 1, 2, 
3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15) offer an agenda, a calendar, a 
contact list, a keyword based search tool, a centralized 
password management function, and notes editing. In 
addition, a few tools offer more sophisticated functions such 
as: a sort of mind-mapping allowing to represent user's 
thoughts (Tool # 2), a text-based card information 
management system (Tool # 6), a system for managing 
archives (Tool # 9), a document and pictures storage system 
dedicated to Android-based mobile phones (Tool # 14), and 
a note management system that coordinates notes (containing 
files) between (Mac, PC, mobiles) platforms (Tool # 10). 
Few of these tools are available on line (e.g., Tools # 7, 9, 
15). Most others run on personal computers, except for Tool 
# 14 that runs only on mobiles and Tool # 10 that runs on 
personal computer, internet and mobile. Synchronization is 
provided by Tools # 10 and 15. 
Most user interfaces are rather similar. Some allow 
tailoring, mainly on colors, window size, language, menu 
position. A few points concern usability issues. For instance, 
concepts may be difficult to grasp due to naming (e.g., Tools 
# 1, 4, 7). In general, no predefined structures, or default 
patterns are included, or are unusable for new user entries, 
which might make it difficult for a large public. Also, the 
coverage of tools, whenever items and categories are 
proposed, does not include many of the citizens' information 
such as identities, health, finance, work, etc. Some of the 
associated information search tools are powerful (e.g., Tools 
# 1, 2, 7), but a bit cumbersome (many forms and choices). 
Some tools offer also tags, labels, particularly for notes, 
contacts and events (e.g., Tools # 1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 13, 15).  
Overall, useful insight can be extracted from the 
references in this related work section. However, few studies 
concern the information content of PIMs, and very few 
include a full user-centric process approach, such as

proposed in current standards, particularly ergonomics 
standards. 
III. 
PRELIMINARY STUDIES: WHAT DO PEOPLE SAY ABOUT 
PERSONAL INFORMATION 
An initial step has been the analysis of 9 administrative 
forms relating to international actions, students grants, solar 
heating incentives, livestock diseases, sport incentives, etc. 
available from French government and administration.  
The analysis showed a very large diversity of information 
items (500 + 200 synonyms). 21 different topics were 
identified. This information content was classified and later 
supported the design of questionnaires and card-sorting 
material. 
A. Focus groups 
With three focus groups (a group with 6 participants from 
a large industrial group, and two 3rd. year university students 
groups, with respectively 7 and 9 participants), a study 
investigated the issue of electronic information storage for 
personal information, as well as the issue of shareability.  
Besides providing a number of candidate information 
items for a personal information space, the main issues 
covered concerned: a strong distrust of electronic storage of 
personal information (hacking, piracy), the time needed to 
proceed to a single electronic storage of personal 
information, and their reluctance to share personal 
information. 
B. Online survey 
A questionnaire survey investigated current practice 
along the same issues: electronic personal information 
storage, shareability, etc, with the addition of people’s view 
on their future personal information space. A self-
administered questionnaire was available on Internet [32] 
using the tool SurveyMonkey [33]. The survey was 
voluntarily focused on personal information used regularly 
by the public. 
The survey was answered by 30 participants: 14 clerks 
and 16 3rd. year university students. 29 respondents were 
women. 
First, users were asked about their profile and how they 
dealt currently with their personal information.  
Secondly, they were presented with a set of 114 personal 
information items organized into 9 categories and 26 sub-
categories. Figure 1 shows the "theoretical" category 
structure, a pre-defined structure based on preliminary 
studies. Categories are organized in a horizontal menu whilst 
items within a category in the vertical menus options below.  
For each sub-category users were asked to identify 
information items that should belong, provide alternatives 
names if unsatisfactory, express willingness to share that 
information with others, and tell if each sub-category should 
be part of a personal information space. Thirdly, users 
browsed all items, and were asked to point any category that 
could 
be 
missing 
and 
to 
comment 
on 
PIMs 
advantages/drawbacks, potential uses, willingness to share 
their PIMS with administrations, views on tools for 
automatic filling electronic forms.  
 
 
Figure 1.  Structure of the "theoretical" personal information space  
Due to space, results on current and future use are not 
reported here, except to mention a strong distrust for such 
systems and reluctance to share information. Focusing on the 
categorization and naming issues, the results support the 
study material. Regarding information items categories, the 
participants tend to agree (79,2%) with the categories 
offered. For the remaining 20,8% the few categories 
suggested are: Hobbies”, “Insurance”, ”Music”, “Sports”, 
“Union activities”, as well as “Spending”. Regarding 
naming, the participants did not make much suggestion. All 
items are well accepted, except 5 (out of 114) for which 
proposals are made. 
IV. 
HOW DO PEOPLE ORGANIZE THEIR PERSONAL 
INFORMATION ITEMS 
Another study focused on how participants organize 
information items. They were asked to create their own 
“boxes”, i.e., information categories in which to insert their 
personal information items, using a Card-Sorting technique.  
A. Material, procedure, participants 
Card-Sorting 
is 
a 
way 
of 
gaining 
insight 
on 
categorization and mental models about information 
architecture that can be described by means of small cards 
[34]. It starts with writing each statement on the information 
architecture on a small card. Then, participants are asked to 
sort a set of cards with words or pictures into piles of similar 
cards. Participants may be asked to provide labels for the 
card piles they have created or they may be provided with 
pre-defined labels and asked to match the cards to them.  
The Card Sorting tool: currently several card-sorting 
tools are available for enabling users to classify items on a 
computer instead of using paper cards. Most tools run under 
Web platforms, allowing card-sorting studies to be 
administered remotely. The results provided by online tools 
are quite similar to studies run using paper-based cards [35]. 
For this study, we used the tool WebSort [36]. The tool was 
initialized with our 114 personal information items (in 
alphabetical order, random assignment not being manageable 
with the tool). Users moved items from the list presented at 
the left side to the right area, creating groups of items they 
named as categories. 
Material: 114 personal information items focusing on 
everyday life aspects involving health, banking, social 
welfare, citizenship administrative papers, etc.

Procedure: a call for participation was distributed 
through web sites and email lists. The study material was 
accessible from an Internet address. After a short definition 
of "Personal Information", of "Personal Information Space", 
and a description of the study goals, and tool functions 
(creating boxes, naming, renaming, etc.), participants were 
instructed to run their individual session at their own pace. 
Once the session was completed and saved, the participants 
were asked to fill a questionnaire (participants' profile, 
current ways of managing your personal information, views/ 
suggestions on a future personal information space). 
Participants were recruited through various professional 
social networks and email lists. Aside 6 initial answers used 
for pre-testing, and 3 beta-testing answers, 56 participants 
responded to the card-sorting study. Due to incomplete 
answers (from 5 to 112 unsorted items, or no answer to the 
questionnaire), 13 participants were excluded from data 
analysis.  
The characteristics of the remaining 43 are: 32 male 
participants (74%) and 11 female (26%), 33 in the 18-39 y. 
age bracket (77%), 9 in the 40-59 y. (21 %) and 1 in the 60-
74 y. (2%), 9 are single (21 %) while the 34 others are not 
(78%) [18 married and 16 shared living], 14 participants 
have children (33%), while 29 do not (67%), 31 participants 
are employees (72%), 5 self-employed (12%), 4 students 
(9%), 2  unemployed (5%) and 1 retired (2%), 41 from 
France (95%), 1 USA and 1 Belgium. 
B. Card sorting results 
The average time for a full session (card-sorting and 
questionnaire) was 42 minutes: for the Card-Sorting part 
only, average duration was 35 minutes.  
The next sections describe the categories (from now on 
called "boxes") created by the participants, their size and 
content, variations in naming, clustering aspects, and the 
analysis of the role of the participants' characteristics.  
Boxes created: overall, 43 participants each classified 
114 information items, for a total of 4802 items. Together, 
500 boxes were created. Each participant created from 5 to 
22 boxes (mean= 11.627, sd= 4.434, median= 11.000). In 
each box, they included 1 to 53 items per box (mean= 9.739, 
sd= 7.291), i.e., 34 different sizes.  
Four sizes have been distinguished: “Very Large Size 
Boxes” > 21 items (and < 1 to 6 > boxes that size), “Large 
Size Boxes” < 9 to 21 items > (and < 6 to 28 > boxes that 
size), “Midsize Boxes” < 3 to 8 items > (and < 34 to 50 > 
boxes that size - most numerous), and “Small Size Boxes” < 
3 items. Most topics are distributed across boxes, big, mid-
size, and small, without much recognizable patterns. 
These variations are further illustrated Figure 2 showing 
both (ordinate) size of boxes (i.e., number of items in boxes) 
and (abscissa) number of boxes each size (i.e., equal number 
of items in a box).  
One can see that there is a rather regular parallel 
increase/decrease for the boxes size/number of items, 
respectively, until 25 items per box, while from 27 items, the 
curve gets more erratic for the number of large size boxes.  
The next section looks more closely at the boxes content. 
 
 
 
Figure 2.  Curve # items per box X # boxes of each size 
Lexical variations: naming of boxes will be later 
analyzed, particularly to help define naming of categories in 
the future PIMI tool. We simply mention here a few 
elements of variation. 
• 
Imprecise naming, e.g., later, confidential, others. 
• 
Typographic variations: caps/ lowercase, capitalized, 
with/ without accents, typos. 
• 
With possessive or not, e.g., (My)health, (My)family.   
• 
Singular vs. plural, e.g., finance(s), address book (s). 
• 
Syntax: 
verb 
or 
noun 
or 
adjective, 
e.g., 
administrative, administration. 
• 
Synonyms and abbreviations versus names. 
• 
A quite large area of variation concerns the use of 
several terms together covering different aspects. 
Conceptual variations: besides the fact that smallest 
size boxes cover more specific concepts than the larger ones, 
we looked at their scope and meaning. We distinguished 
Single concepts, Multiple Concepts (Explicitly Grouped by 
Name), and Higher-Level Concepts. The way boxes group 
items is quite variable in terms of concept scope, which 
confirms the analysis on boxes sizes.  
These linguistic and conceptual variations have given 
some hints on default names for a future editable PIM, but 
also point at conceptual associations that are discussed in the 
clustering analyses. For instance, the frequency of identical 
"concept names" is quite high for boxes such as "health", 
"bank", "professional life". 
Clustering analysis: a multiple correspondence analysis 
(MCA), using the SPAD tool [37] was performed with 9 
classes (as in theoretical structure). Multiple Correspondence 
Analysis (MCA) is a method for nominal or categorical data 
sets (e.g., [38] [39]). The goal is to visualize a data set by 
representing data as points in a low-dimensional Euclidean 
space. This procedure is similar to principal component 
analysis for categorical data. MCA is also an extension of 
simple correspondence analysis (CA) in that it is applicable 
to a large set of categorical variables. In this case MCA is a 
CA on the Burt table formed from these variables. As in 
factor analysis methods, the first axis is the most important 
dimension, the second axis the second most important, and 
so on. The number of axes to be retained for analysis is 
determined by calculating the eigenvalues (a set of scalars 
associated with a linear system of equations, i.e., a matrix 
equation, sometimes also known as characteristic roots or 
43

values, proper values, or latent roots). In our application we 
have retained 20 axes. On this low-dimensional Euclidian 
space we applied a hierarchical method. Hierarchical 
algorithms find successive clusters using previously clusters. 
This algorithm chosen is an agglomerative ("bottom-up") 
algorithm. This algorithm begins with each element as a 
separate cluster and merges them into successively larger 
clusters. An important step in most clustering is to select a 
distance measure, which will determine how the similarity of 
two elements is calculated. We have selected the Euclidian 
distance on the 20 factors selected by the MCA and the 
aggregative criterion used is the Ward’s criterion [40]. 
Using such hierarchy in the Ward sense, 9 classes were 
detected. It shows overall a rather consistent category 
assignment to items, but some differences with the 
“theoretical assignment”. The initial clustering (see Table I) 
started by leaving out 34 individual items, while establishing 
33 initial groups (called level 1 clusters). They vary in item 
numbers content: 24 groups with 2 items, 7 with 3 items, and 
only 1 with 5 or 6 items.

Distribution of the number of items per level is shown 
Figure 3. Clustering varies little up to level 5 in terms of 
items numbers. There is a drop for levels 6 to 9 that actually 
tend to group item clusters from lower levels. 
 
 
Figure 3.  Curve items per level 
To detail results, the 9 classes are seen at the incremental 
level, from "leaves" to "root" in the SPAD dendrogram. The 
clustering level refers to the rank at which the information 
items are grouped together in the clustering analysis: each 
time individual items or clusters are grouped, it adds a level 
(incrementing by 1 the previous highest level). Otherwise 
said, the more levels within a class, the more variations in 
boxes assignment. It is a hint on coherence of certain groups 
compared to others (e.g., many levels within the finance 
area, while few levels in the taxes, or health areas).  
Looking more closely at the tree, an illustration is 
provided Figure 4 for non-health clusters and Figure 5 for 
health clusters. All grouped items are "boxed", individual 
items are not. All nodes show a level (L1 to 10). The lowest 
level is L1 (minimum items is 2, listed with "+" to associate 
them). All level 1 nodes show in addition a parenthesis 
referring to the level rank as used in the explanatory text 
below. The 9 SPAD classes are identified with " #" (8 non-
health, 1 health). The main observations are the following. 
 
 
 
Figure 4.  Non-Health Clustering Tree  
A first class of 6 items corresponds to taxes. It is a quite 
consistent group, not been found together with other 
financial considerations. This suggests it is a specific concept 
for the participants. 
A second class of 19 items deals with other financial 
aspects: bank (7 items), income (3 items), investments (4 
items), loans (4 items), and savings (1 item). This actually 
contradicts 
the 
theoretical 
assignment 
by 
excluding 
patrimonial aspects.  
A third class of 4 items relate to a “patrimonial” 
category, distinct from other financial aspects. Unlike 
theoretically, monetary savings do not belong, nor vehicles 
meant as collectible, which may not have been clear. 
A fourth class of 7 items groups all codes. This cluster is 
distinct from the other groupings: it is only grouped with 
other clusters at a much higher level.

A fifth class of 5 items groups information related to car 
information (4 items) to which a Vehicle item was added 
(meant to be vintage/ collectible cars, but not clearly 
expressed in card sorting explanations). This corresponds to 
the theoretical "My Personal Transports" with the addition of 
Vehicle, but without Driver’s License. This is a case of 
potential redundancy within a PIM, a driver's license being at 
the same time a vehicle, and a proof of identity. 
A sixth class of 12 items groups a more heterogeneous 
set dealing with: public transportation (4 items), personal 
dates and appointments (4 items), and leisure (3 items), 
adding Institutional contacts, probably viewed as the ones 
needed in every day life. Overall, this cluster shows a large 
number of different clustering levels, which makes it a bit 
unstable compared to others. Again, it may mean that some 
information items should be made redundant, depending on 
their context of use.  
A seventh class of 22 items groups various aspects of 
people identification: personal identity (8 items), contact 
information (4 items), identity documents (3 items), family 
status (3 items), information on relatives (3 items), and 
Driver’s License, which seems to be considered as part of a 
person’s identity. Also, it does not include Health records, 
which was in the theoretical assignment, but meant for 
children health. 
An eight class of 16 items groups all professional 
information: career (4 items), job (5 items), but also 
professional agenda (4 items), professional/clients contacts 
(3 items). Participants tended to group all professional items, 
rather than distinguishing documents/ status items and 
contacts aspects. 
Finally, a ninth class of 23 items joins all health aspects, 
whether biometric data (5 items), or health analyses (12 
items), or administrative and health contacts (5 items), and 
children Health Record. 
 
 
 
Figure 5.  Health Clustering Tree  
Co-occurrence of items in boxes: the analysis searched 
all cases (“frequent sets”) for which at least 80% of the 
participants (i.e., at least 35) put a set of items into the same 
box. This resulted in 1041 sub-sets of items. To reduce that 
large collection, we looked at “closed frequent sets” within 
these “frequent sets”. A “closed frequent set” is a set for 
which all its sub-sets are frequent, but which is not itself 
contained in another “frequent set”. By topics, the items 
were grouped from largest to smallest number of participants 
within largest to smallest sets within a topic. The maximum 
of items found together is 9, minimum being 2.  The analysis 
is consistent with previous clustering analyses. It also shows 
that the primary topics under which information items are 
being put together on a regular basis (highest co-occurrence 
topics, ranked first by number of participants, and within, by 
number of items) relate to health (13), bank/ finance (12), 
and identity (12), followed by work (7) and codes (6), the 
last ones being taxes (2), loans (1), telephone (1), agenda (1). 
Differences due to participants’ characteristics: the 
focus is here, per participant, on the number of boxes, the 
size of the smallest boxes, the average size of the boxes, as 
well as their maximum size (see Table II). 
TABLE II.  
FISHER TEST AND ANOVA ON GENDER 
Out of the participants’ characteristics (gender, age, 
marital status, children, activity, location), only gender 
showed a significant role. It mainly means that women create 
more boxes than men, with a higher variability (Anova F, p < 
0.0565, women std. dev. 5.3632, men std. dev. 3.8834). 
However, women tend to create less small boxes (Student T, 
p < 0.0056), women average 2.6364, while men average 
4.3438. Otherwise said, women tend to use more boxes and 
to vary more in their size and content. 
C. New information category structure 
Results showed that our items list, initial classification, 
and labels were quite satisfactory for participants.  
However, the analyses showed some discrepancies 
suggesting a new candidate structure along: Identity & 
Contacts (personal Identity, Identity papers, personal Contacts), 
Work (current Work, Career, professional Contacts), Agenda, 
Contacts & Transports (personal Agenda, Contacts, individual 
Transports, public Transports), Codes & Passwords, Finances 
(Income and social benefits, Investments, Loans, Bank accounts), 
Taxes, and Health (Social security & Mutual Funds, physicians, 
and medical Records). 
Compared to the previous structure, there are 7 categories 
instead of 9. "My Family" is removed. "My Agenda", "My 
Contacts", and "My Transportation" are grouped, and a 
specific category “Taxes” is created. Agenda may be 
questionnable as distinguishing personal versus professional 
may not make sense if a future tool includes a common 
calendar. In addition, categories and sub-categories were 
reordered according to expected frequency and initial tool 
set-up order. Information items were reduced based on 
assignment stability, but more pragmatically on expected 
usefulness (in a new experiment, young students, may not 
need in their PIMI tool topics such as patrimony or children 
health). In terms of naming, the use of the possessive will not 
be pursued and a number of category and information names

will be changed to reflect the most frequent name generation 
by the study participants. Flexibility is another issue of prime 
importance. Despite any efforts at designing a good 
structure, good naming, there is probably no single solution: 
a future PIMI tool probably should offer a user tailorable 
structure and content, as well as flexible search features. 
D. Questionnaire results 
The participants input to the questionnaire after the card-
sorting exercise is quite rich, and will need further qualitative 
analyses. The main quantitative results, rather consistent 
with the previous survey, are as follows: 
• 
86.5% participants use both paper and electronic 
storage, while 7.7% only electronic and 5.8% only 
paper. 91.7% use a personal computer, 27.1% a 
cellular 
phone, 
10.4% 
an 
iPhone, 
8.3% 
a 
smartphone, 8.3% a PDA, and 18.8% other means. 
• 
Only 30.6% use some information protection method 
for their personal information while 69.4% do not. 
• 
46.9% currently share some of their personal 
information, while 53.1% do not. They share it with 
spouse (62.5%), administration (37.5%), social 
networks (34.4%), family (31.3%), friends (31.3%), 
employer (21.9%), colleagues (18.8%), and 9.4% 
others. The topics for which they show reluctance to 
share are codes, health-related information, and 
income. 
• 
70.6% organize their personal information into 
categories, while 29.4% do not. When stated, the 
categories correspond either to the ones proposed or 
to their naming of the card-sorting boxes, with the 
addition of a few categories such as “bills”, 
"bicycle", "religion", "politics". 
• 
For a future information space, 65.2% did not offer 
new categories, while 34.8% added a few new ones, 
e.g., friends birthday, food recipes, computer IP, 
bills, music, photos and videos. 
• 
71.4% see both advantages and drawbacks in a 
future information space, while 22.8% see only 
advantages, and 5.7% only drawbacks. Those mainly 
concern trust and security, while advantages concern 
centralization and ease of access. Regarding 
expected functionalities, the top ones are searching, 
storage, filtering, and accessibility. 
• 
72.3% are worried about sharing their information 
with administrations, while 27.7% are not. The main 
concerns, relate again to trust and security. 
• 
55% are in favor of automatic form-filling, while 
42.5% have mixed feelings, and 2.5% are against it. 
The main benefit mentioned is time saved, while the 
concern relates to strict selection of information to 
be auto-filled (security and confidentiality issues). 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
This paper reported novel user-centric work in the area of 
PIMS and e.gov., focusing on the personal information bits 
currently scattered many places, electronic or paper, rather 
that on disk file management issues. The methods used 
attempted to identified what people say and what people do 
about their personal information. These methods have limits 
related to remote experiments through Internet, to the card-
sorting tool (management of redundancies, sub-categories, 
monitoring participants’ modification strategies).  
However, the results support the user-centric approach of 
the study, starting from user needs and associated 
documents, experimental testing and design iterations, which 
could be generalized for designing usable PIMs. On the 
practical side, the results also suggest a few modifications of 
the information structure and content to be further tested in 
the PIMI project. 
The design of tools for supporting citizen to use and 
share personal information is a complex task. Some of the 
issues are trust and willingness to share information which is 
of prime importance to users (even though many of them 
have lesser concerns when posting very private material on 
Facebook or other social networks), coping with users 
behavior variability and preferences, setting up proper 
procedures for information exchange in e-gov. contexts, 
reducing the information fragmentation issue, such as 
making sure different tools and environments allow 
consistent and synchronized use resources, and providing 
efficient search tools, with queries adapted to the users. 
In our research, the next step is to test a mockup system 
based on the previous findings. The mockup will be tested in 
depth, with users being monitored, with tasks to perform, 
with usability measurements, both objective and subjective. 
One underlying idea is to explore how people can actually 
tailor their own information space, in terms of structure and 
naming, but also in terms of sharing parameters, and 
associated (flexible and contextualized) search tools. 
Later on, the current static view (i.e., about content, 
information items and categories) will be extended to a 
dynamic view that will include procedures (i.e., using 
personal information items to manage one's personal space 
and local information transfers, as well as to fill manually or 
automatically e-gov. forms). This will concern service 
composition, building ontologies, associating information 
items related documents (e.g., file copy of driver's license, of 
administrative documents). 
An additional goal will be to formalize the design process 
for delivering validated new e-gov. content: context of use 
study (e.g., documents), user needs gathering (ideas through 
focus groups, facts and opinions through questionnaires), 
concepts definition (design step), subjective testing (through 
questionnaires), content assessment (through card-sorting 
and questionnaire), prototype design and user testing. 
Hopefully, in the end, this will contribute to more citizen-
centric personal information systems.
