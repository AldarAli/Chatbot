Abstract—Semantic technologies appear as a step on the way
to creating systems capable of representing the physical
world as real time computational processes. In this context,
the paper presents a toolchain for an ontology based
knowledge management system. It consists of the ontology
editor,
FluentEditor
and
the
distributed
knowledge
representation
system,
Ontorion.
FluentEditor
is
a
comprehensive tool for editing and manipulating complex
ontologies that uses Controlled Natural Language (CNL). Its
main feature is the usage of Controlled English as a
knowledge modelling language. Ontorion is a Distributed
Knowledge Management System with Natural Language
interfaces (CNL) and a built-in rules engine. The Ontorion
system is equipped with plugins for connection with other
software environments, for example rOntorion using an R
language package to access ontologies. It is exemplified with
the semantic extension of On Line Analytical Processing
(OLAP) using R language.
Keywords- Semantic OLAP, Semantic, OLAP, Semantic
Web, Ontorion, FluentEditor.

INTRODUCTION
Business Intelligence (BI) is a technology that enables
the business to make intelligent, data-driven decisions.
Intelligence here is governed by the laws of statistics that
are applied on loosely coupled statistical variables,
however to understand the meaning of data we need to
link statistical variables to the real-life entities. This
improvement can be implemented nowadays with aid of
semantic
technologies.
As
a
result,
we
obtain
the
“smarter” BI system that represents the physical world as
real time computational processes.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In
Section
II,
we
present
the
semantic
knowledge
management framework that can be built with particular
solutions available on the market. In Section III, we
present the idea of OLAP - a powerful BI tool and its
possible implementation in the R language. Semantic
OLAP, the result of our research on bridging together
both semantic toolkit and OLAP, is introduced and
discussed in the Section IV, followed by the conclusion,
in Section V.
II.
SEMANTIC KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT
FRAMEWORK
The expectations of business and science require new,
global, flexible and much more effective technology of
data exchange and processing. When the whole world is
braided with effective communication links, what we need
is a new efficient middleware working in the existing
infrastructure but possessing new possibilities. After a
decade of using file exchange systems, much experience
was acquired. Very simple and easy rules of metadata
connection gained great popularity.
Some factors should be mentioned which are important
from our point of view:
•
Easy exploitation: the end clients do not have any
barriers;
•
Accessibility: they could be used anywhere on
many platforms and media;
•
Effectiveness: acceptable from the point of view
of the data receiver;
•
Stability:
information
about
resources
must
always be reliable;
•
Independence:
each
node
is
completely
autonomous within the system;
•
Limitation of platform co-share: data are of a
very simple form and the system is not able to provide co-
sharing of more complex information.
The factors mentioned above indicate a tendency to
recognize the meaning of a given resource, and in a later
stage to the machine “understanding” of its content (i.e.,

ascribing semantic qualifiers to it enabling automatic
decisive processes). The systems working in this layer use
many technologies, which can be divided into the
following categories:
•
Natural language processing;
•
Artificial intelligence and teaching machines;
•
Ontologies;
•
Meta-information, standardization and tagging
documents.
By modelling domain ontologies with Semantic Web
Rule Language (SWRL) [1] rules we are able to define a
knowledge scheme in any semantic knowledge base. The
store for the knowledge base can be implemented in Not
only SQL (NoSQL) technology (e.g. Cassandra [2], Azure
Tables [3]) or in Resource Description Framework (RDF)
[4] data stores (e.g. AllegroGraph, Virtuoso) [5][6][7]. A
relatively
simple
interface
to
model
ontologies
is
supported by Protégé [8] or NeON [9] editors. Although
these
interfaces
are
rather
simple
for
experienced
practitioners, they are not for common users that do not
know the nuances of ontology engineering. On the other
hand, Semantic Rules Representation in CNL using
FluentEditor [10] is the
simplest
way to
represent
knowledge in a natural language way. Nevertheless, using
natural language is unattainable for the current technology
and thus for the machines that should understand this
knowledge. The most appropriate solution seems to use
controlled natural languages.
A.
Ontorion SDK
Ontorion
[11]
is
a
Distributed
Knowledge
Management System with Natural Language interfaces
(CNL) and a built-in rules engine. It is compatible with
Web Ontology Language 2 (OWL2) [12] and Semantic
Web Rule Language (SWRL) and can be hosted in the
Cloud or OnPremise environments. Ontorion is a family of
products of server and client-side components for desktop
and web allowing for the broad integration of custom
software and existing corporate infrastructure. Ontorion
performs real-time reasoning over the stream of data with
the aid of an ontology that expresses the meaning of the
given data (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Ontorion [11] - Knowledge Management System
Ontorion is a set of components equipped with
algorithms that allows one to build large, scalable
solutions for the Semantic Web. The scalability is realized
by both the NoSQL, symmetric database and the ontology
Modularization algorithm. Modularization algorithm splits
the problem into smaller pieces that are able to be
processed in parallel by the set of computational nodes,
therefore; Ontorion is a symmetric cluster of servers, able
to perform reasoning on large ontologies. Every single
Ontorion Node is able to make the same operations on
data. It tries to get the minimal suitable ontology module
(component) and
perform the desirable task on
it.
Symmetry of the Ontorion cluster provides the ability for it
to run in the “Computing Cloud” environment, where the
total number of nodes can change in time depending on the
user needs.

FluentEditor 2014
FluentEditor
2014,
an
ontology
editor,
is
a
comprehensive tool for editing and manipulating complex
ontologies that uses CNL [13].
FluentEditor, shown in Figure 2, provides a more
suitable alternative for human users to eXtensible Markup
Language (XML)-based OWL editors. Its main feature is
the usage of Controlled English as the knowledge
modelling language. Supported via Predictive Editor, it
prohibits
one
from
entering
any
sentence
that
is
grammatically or morphologically incorrect and actively
helps the user during sentence writing.
Figure 2. Ontology of dimensions edited in FluentEditor 2014
Controlled English is a subset of Standard English with
restricted grammar and vocabulary in order to reduce the
ambiguity and complexity inherent in full English.
Main features:
•
CNL OWL implementation: The implementation of
CNL OWL - FluentEditor grammar is compatible
with OWL-DL and OWL2
•
OWL 2.0 full compliance: Full compliance with OWL
2.0 standard from W3C

SEMAPRO 2015 : The Ninth International Conference on Advances in Semantic Processing

•
OWL API: Compatible with OWL API, which allows
it to be used in cooperation with other tools
•
SWRL compliance: The user can import existing
ontologies from OWL files
•
Dynamic referencing of external OWL ontologies:
CNL documents can dynamically reference external
OWLs from Web or disk.
•
Predictive Edition Support: Users have enhanced
support from the predictive editor
•
Built-in dictionary: The built-in dictionary makes it
easier to avoid misspelling errors
Some examples of other features are:
•
Advanced user Interface, in order to open up semantic
technologies for inexperienced users,
•
In-place error resolving support - direct information
about possible errors with hints on how to resolve
them,
•
Importing existing ontologies – users can directly
import to CNL any external ontology
•
Ambiguity resolution - it keeps track of ambiguities of
concepts
and/or
instance
names
imported
from
different external ontologies.
C.
R language and Ontologies
R language [14] is a widely used tool for statistical
analysis. Combining ontologies and statistics opens an
efficient way for the quantitative-qualitative analysis of
data. It is possible to use both approaches conveniently in
a single place by using an R language package to access
ontologies (rOntorion). rOntorion R package allows direct
access to ontologies created with FluentEditor and opens
them for semantic processing in the R environment.
The R language plugins for FluentEditor are shown in
Figure 3.
Figure 3. Graph of ontology from Figure 2
Beside development of analytical models with R and
rOntorion
it
is
also
possible
to
build
plugins
for
FluentEditor with R language. These plugins have direct
access to the ontology within the editor host and can use
any available R package. Plugins can display graphical
results or textual output directly in FluentEditor.

INTRODUCTION TO OLAP
OLAP is a well-known method [15] used in Business
Analytics to provide decision makers with Online Access
to Analytical Capabilities. It is based on the concept of
data-cubes,
multidimensional
cubes
of
data
that
if
equipped with tools allow the data and problems wherein
to be explored. To create a datacube, we need data that can
be represented in a STAR schema. The central table
contains “measures” while “dimensions” are placed in
surrounding tables (see Figure 4).

Figure 4. Transformation of a given dataset into the STAR schema
(example)
To turn the data into a hypercube, we need to
denormalize the STAR (by creating a single table) and
what is put in each cell in the data-cube (hypercube)
represents an aggregate value of measurements for a
unique combination of each dimension. The aggregate is a
function, e.g.: SUM, AVERAGE, MAX, MIN, COUNT,
etc. See Figure 5.

IV.
THE SEMANTIC OLAP
By using the toolchain of FluentEditor and Ontorion
SDK, it is possible to create something more than OLAP.
We call it “Semantic OLAP”, however, a solution
delivered by Infotopics [16] is similar and it is called
“natural query language”.
In our case, the example application that implements
the Semantic OLAP approach was built on top of the
following tools:
•
Excel [17] – to create the database (see Figure 7)
•
RStudio [18] – an open source integrated development
environment (IDE) for R – to develop the software.
A piece of the code of queries is shown in Figure 8 and the
result of the query from Figure 8 is displayed in Figure 9.

CONCLUSION
The semantic extension of OLAP is proved to be fully
functional
using
the toolchain
of domain
ontology,
FluentEditor and the distributed knowledge representation
system, Ontorion combined with, e.g., Excel as a source of
data and RStudio for OLAP. Moreover, it created the
foundations for already available on the market, developed
and maintained by Cognitum, a solution called Ask Data
Anything (ADA) [19]. The ADA allows exploring data by
using natural language directly, rather than by using CNL,
therefore we classify ADA as a tool that allows to explore
data with natural language.
The modern approach to BI called BigData, is
currently understood to face the problem of “(…) growing
number of insights that are being produced by big data
through automated forms of analysis (…) What happens to
the thousands of insights that are being generated
automatically by all of those nifty machine learning
algorithms? How do they find their way to a person at the
right time?“ [20]. Semantic OLAP as well as its successor
called ADA proves that the problem can be solved with
support of semantic technologies.
