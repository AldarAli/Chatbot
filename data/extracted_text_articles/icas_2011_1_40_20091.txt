Abstract— Computer-based supervisory control and 
data acquisition (SCADA) systems have evolved over the 
past four decades, from standalone, compartmentalized 
operations 
into 
networked 
architectures 
that 
communicate across large distances. There is an 
emerging trend comprising SCADA and conventional IT 
units toward consolidating some overlapping activities. 
This trend is motivated by cost savings achieved by 
consolidating disparate platforms, networks, software, 
and maintenance tools. For reasons of efficiency, 
maintenance, economics, data acquisition, control 
platforms have migrated from isolated in-plant networks 
using proprietary hardware and software to PC-based 
systems using standard software, network protocols, and 
the Internet. In this paper, we present a new approach 
for web based SCADA systems that adapt to the 
behavior of the target application. In addition, we take 
into account the real time constraints that imposed by 
the nature of the problem. We show that our approach is 
more efficient than other approaches in terms of 
consuming as little as possible of the available resources 
(computational power and network bandwidth).

 INTRODUCTION  
As the technical capabilities of computers, operating 
systems, 
and 
networks 
improved, 
organizational 
management pushed for increased knowledge of the real-
time status of remote plant operations. These capabilities are 
known collectively as Supervisory Control and Data 
Acquisition or SCADA. As the name indicates, it is not a 
full control system, but rather focuses on the supervisory 
level. SCADA systems are vital components of most 
nations’ critical infrastructures. They control pipelines, 
water and transportation systems, utilities, refineries, 
chemical plants, and a wide variety of manufacturing 
operations. Automation technology produces large amounts 
of data. This typically represents physical variables such as 
temperature, current, pressure or other production data such 
as number of units, error information and so on. The data 
comes from equally diverse sources: controllers, level 
measuring devices, weighing machines, scanners and 
similar. These data end up being crunched or otherwise 
retained by all sorts of software applications. It may need to 
be placed straight into visualization software for HMI 
(Human Machine Interface).  
One of the most familiar automation protocols now is 
OPC protocol. OPC stands for OLE (Object linking and 
Embedding) for Process Control or Open Process Control 
[2,9]. It provides a mechanism to provide data from a data 
source and communicate the data to any client application in 
a standard way. A vendor can now develop a reusable, 
highly optimized server to communicate to the data source, 
and maintain the mechanism to access data from the data 
source/device efficiently. Providing the server with an OPC 
interface allows any client to access their devices. The 
utility of OPC has now reached the point where automation 
without OPC is unthinkable. This interface is supported by 
almost all SCADA, visualization, and process control 
systems [3]. OPC delivers connectivity and interoperability 
benefits to measurement and automation systems in the 
same way that standard printer drivers deliver connectivity 
and interoperability benefits to word processing. Both OPC 
server and OPC clients are COM objects. It makes no 
difference who developed these objects, when they were 
developed, or in what programming language they were 
written. Not only the services of the OPC servers on the 
same computer are available but also those of all servers 
which can be accessed over the network. Our objective is to 
integrate the existing OPC server data access (OPC DA) 
with the Internet to achieve an efficient web-based SCADA 
system. In our approach we consider many design 
parameters such as how frequent the target data change, the 
consumption of the available resources and the real time 
constraints that imposed by the nature of the application. 
This paper is organized as follows; in Section II we give a 
brief background for some of the solutions that have been 
developed for this problem. In Section III, we present the 
motivation behind our research. We introduce our approach 
in Section IV. In Section V, we present evaluation for our 
approach.  
II. 
BACKGROUND 
There are many solutions that have been proposed to 
solve this problem. These solutions can be classified into 
four categories.  
A. DCOM 
Most of the previous work used DCOM for LANs 
communication with OPC DA server for example, Xiaofeng 
Lee et al. [18] used DCOM communication between an 
OPC DA client and OPC DA server then they transfer the 
OPC DA client data to XML format to be able to access 
these data through Internet with an XML-DA client which 
18

communicate to an XML server (Web server) to get data. 
Truong Chau et al. [16] used DCOM to enable the C# server 
script to access OPC DA through LAN and because the 
OPC DA client is a .NET client they used an OPC .NET 
wrapper to make the transformation from .NET to COM and 
COM to .NET. Zhang Lieping et al. [19] uses the OPC DA 
Toolbox which is integrated in MATLAB 7 and above 
editions, this Toolbox enables MATLAB applications to 
communicate with OPC DA servers through DCOM then 
the user can simply and conveniently realize the operation to 
the OPC objects. Unfortunately, using DCOM through 
Internet is avoided for many reasons such as, DCOM is 
windows dependent platform, difficult to configure, has 
very long and non-configurable timeouts, and cannot be 
used for Internet communication. That is why DCOM is 
best suitable for LANs where there are less number of nodes 
and small delay times.  
B. XML 
        XML is a platform-independent which is an important 
feature to achieve interoperability between different 
applications that is running on different platforms. The other 
advantage of OPC XML-DA is the simple administration as 
it is based on SOAP and XML. Xiaofeng Lee et al. [18] 
suggested designing an information integration system 
which will adopt OPC DA to OPC XML-DA; the design 
includes three layers structure, data source layer, data 
transfer layer and client layer. His conclusion was that 
because of adopting industry standard OPC interface and 
web service transfer interface, the remote monitoring system 
based on OPC XML-DA technology makes it convenient to 
update and expand system. But if we analyze this approach 
we find that there is an overhead in layer2 because of the 
COM-XML transformer, also the authors didn’t expose to 
the problem of client data update is there a data polling 
mechanism that enable the client to get the new data. 
Similar work used XML and/or OPC XML-DA techniques 
such as [3, 15, 17]. Due to possible performance limitations, 
OPC XML-DA is unlikely to be used for real time 
applications, although it is commonly used as a bridge 
between the enterprise and control network. 
C. Webservice 
Webservices as defined by the W3C as "a software 
system designed to support interoperable machine-to-
machine interaction over a network. Nunzio M. Torrisi et al. 
[8] proposed what they called CyberOPC which is a 
communication system that anticipates the use of a gateway 
station called CyberOPC, which will process messages sent 
to the OPC towards the public network and vice versa. Their 
proposed communication system is targeted to best effort 
network with minimum bandwidth reserved for periodic 
traffic. As they claimed that the necessity to satisfy time-
critical and security requirements for remote control has 
stimulated the study of a new protocol for process control. 
And to obtain maximum interoperability with existing 
factory floor technologies, they built their communication 
project over the OPC technology. This approach doesn’t 
solve the problem of periodic data requests from the remote 
client to update its old data with new data, and when the 
remote client makes a request, the CyberOPC will not check 
if there is a change in these data from the last sent data or 
not so if the control process has a high frequency data 
change, the remote client has to increase its periodic data 
requests which will affect the server efficiency and network 
bandwidth. 
Duo Li et al. [3] suggested an approach to implement the 
function of real time monitoring which provide periodically 
updated data to operators, the target data which saved in a 
database is marked and mapped to an HTML file, say file2, 
in a web server, the database server automatically refreshes 
file2 with the latest data whenever the target data in the 
server is updated. To show target data in an HTML file a 
Java applet is developed that connects to file2 to get the 
latest data periodically and display them in the required 
format, another HTML file ,say file1,in which the applet is 
included, is developed to establish a basic human-machine 
interface (HMI) and complete some initiations. 
D. AJAX 
Actually AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) [5] 
started a new line in web based SCADA systems because it 
enables us to create more interactive web pages which are 
our way to replace traditional desktop SCADA application.  
AJAX can be considered as the future of the Internet because 
of its ability to simulate desktop applications by the new 
features it offers like asynchronous client-server calls and 
partial-page updates. Truong Chau et al. [16] used AJAX in 
their approach to get the OPC DA data to the client web page 
with high user interactivity. But because of the problems of 
the HTTP protocol as a stateless protocol they had to use a 
simple data polling mechanism by using an AJAX Timer to 
poll for new OPC DA data set from the OPC DA server 
through the web server. When using an AJAX style of 
programming the old, classic programming approach must 
be given up. There is no form submit any more that posts all 
the client state to the server and requests for a complete new 
page description using HTML. Instead of loading several 
pages until the functionality is done only one page is loaded 
and will stay in the browser until the end of functionality. 
III. 
MOTIVATION 
None of the mentioned approaches considered the 
feasibility of the realization of their work. If we look closely 
to [3, 13, 15, 17] we will find out that they use XML and/or 
OPC XML-DA technologies which have disadvantages  
such as: 
• 
 Not suitable for transferring large data volumes 
• 
XML technology is generally slower than COM 
• 
The interaction parameters are coded using XML, 
which leads to an overhead. 
• 
An OPC XML-DA Service is stateless.

 Also in [12], to allow each node (client or server) to start 
sending data to the other node independently at any time 
(bidirectional communication) the authors have to maintain 
the connection in a permanent open state by making the 
server continuously sending data (whether there is a data 
change or not) to the client which affects the performance of 
the system specially with large number of clients and low 
network bandwidth, and this may lead to server crash.  
     In [14], the authors will need to find a way to 
periodically update file2 which may be a loop or any other 
way, also the java applet which embedded in the HTML 
file1 will need to periodically use a Timer to get the new 
data from file2 and then they will face the problem of 
synchronization between the applet Timer interval and the 
process of updating file2 with new data and this will be 
difficult, also they ignored the heavy network load and the 
need for large server memory to handle the large number of 
requests and the heavy load on the server CPU. It is very 
difficult (nearly impossible) to guarantee a real time 
behavior with such limitations. The only solution is to spend 
money to increase the network bandwidth and the server 
CPU speed and memory capacity (The hardware resources). 
In our work we try to find alternative, much cheaper 
solutions to these problems. Also in [8], the designed 
CyberOPC doesn’t solve the problem of periodic data 
requests from the remote client to update its old data with 
new data, and when the remote client makes a request, the 
CyberOPC will not check if there is a change in these data 
from the last sent data or not so if the control process has a 
high frequency data change, the remote client has to 
increase its periodic data requests which will affect the 
server efficiency and network bandwidth. 
      Finally, in [16],  the authors did not take any attention 
to the efficiency and performance of their approach, the 
Timer they used will get the data without any care if there is 
a significant data changed or not, also how they could 
specify the Timer interval, there are two cases for that, first, 
when the interval is small i.e. 1 second (high frequency data 
polling) by this way the server and network will suffer, 
second if the interval is large they will loss some data change 
events that maybe very important and the system will not be 
considered as a Real-Time monitoring system. So this 
approach still needs some modifications which enable us to 
get optimal efficiency and performance, for this reason we 
choose this approach to be our reference approach. We 
believe that AJAX can be the way to make web applications 
compete with desktop applications by the interesting features 
it offers [5].  
IV. 
THE PROPOSED APPROACH 
The main challenge will be to design and implement a 
new approach for providing a direct web access to 
controllers using OPC DA server that is aware of the 
consumption of the available resources and try to fulfill the 
real time constraints as well. We have two options to 
achieve this target, first using DCOM, second using a web 
server and modern IT technologies. If we used the first 
option, we will face the DCOM problems (see section II). 
Therefore, we will use the second option, which is web 
server and modern IT technologies. However, with this 
option we are going to face many design and 
implementation challenges such as, HTTP limitations, 
responsiveness, real time constraints and the efficiency of 
the approach. In a classic client/server application, there is a 
static communication link between client and server but 
with web applications, this static communication does not 
exist thus the need for a persistent communication 
mechanism by which a client can communicate with the 
server independent of any specific action taken by the user. 
We want that communication take place even if the user is 
not clicking or using any of the controls in the user 
interface. 
A. System Overview 
Our target system consists of a web server, an OPC 
server and a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) units 
which will be connected in the same plant network, which 
may be industrial Ethernet network or Fieldbus network 
(Profibus, MPI... etc), in our case it will be an Ethernet LAN 
because it is now a standard and familiar protocol in 
industry. This LAN connected to internet through an ADSL 
router which has a local (virtual) IP number and an 
international (Real) IP number. A Client (browser) can 
connect to the Webservice residing in the web server though 
internet using HTTP protocol, then the Webservice will 
connect to the OPC server in the same LAN using DCOM to 
get or set the new Data as shown in Figure 1. To achieve our 
goals we will use a modular architecture in the design of our 
web based SCADA system. As shown in Figure 2. Our 
system consists of three main modules, which are: 
 
Figure 1: Proposed System Overview 
1. The Client, which is a web browser that will be used to 
run and display the designed SCADA web page and 
will send the required requests to update the web page 
with the new data. The requests will be sent 
asynchronously (in background) by the AJAX engine 
and the web page will still be responsive. When the 
request’s response comes, the AJAX engine will 
forward the returned data to the web page then the web 
20

page will send another request and so on. A new 
request will be sent only if the response to its 
predecessor request comes.  
2. The web server which will wait for the HTTP client’s 
requests and forward these requests to the Webservice 
which in turn will run the proper web method (WM1 if 
the request asks for new data and WM2 if the request 
contains set-points to the OPC DA server). The WM1 
will wait for a data change in the OPC DA server cache 
and then return the new data to the client. WM2 will 
write the coming client’s set-points to the OPC DA 
server and return to the client without waiting. Also, it 
includes an OPC DA Wrapper, as we mentioned that 
OPC DA protocol is based on Microsoft COM 
technology. However, the Webservice, which we use to 
access this protocol, is implemented in modern .NET 
technology. So, we will have to find a way to access a 
legacy technology from a modern technology, the OPC 
FOUNDATION solved this problem by creating 
wrappers to enable .NET clients to access COM 
servers. 
3. The OPC DA server, which is the interface to the 
physical control process (PLC), the OPC DA server has 
two layers, one to provide the standard COM interface 
to its clients and another one, which is a vendor specific 
driver to communicate with the PLC. 
 
 
Figure 2: Architecture of the Proposed System  
B. Proposed Approach Design 
From the discussion of previous work and because of the 
Internet infrastructure, we conclude that data polling is the 
only solution, which is robust and viable; our main 
challenge will be implementing a data polling that is 
effective and wastes as little as possible of the available 
resources. A traditional data poll such as the one used by 
Truong Chau et al. [16] will query the server, get an answer, 
and then wait until the next query. The client side has to 
choose the rate of polling the server for a new data (i.e., a 
request every 5 seconds) without taking into account the 
frequency of data change (fast or slow). The waiting period 
until the next poll is a dead time during which neither the 
client nor the server can communicate with each other. 
 
Figure 3: The client side 
 
Figure 4: The server side Webservices 
In our approach we do not choose a constant data query 
period instead we adapt to the frequency of data change of 
the application. This can be achieved by converting the dead 
time into a wait time created by the web server. The client 
sends a request and waits for the potential of data change. 
The server responds to the client only when there is a data 
change. Otherwise the request is put in a waiting queue at 
the server. The design flow charts of our approach is shown 
in Figure 3 (for client side) and Figure 4 (for server side). 
For complete description of the design and the code of each 
module, please check [1].

V. 
EVALUATIONS 
Any control process has a number of measurable physical 
quantities, which are measured by different sensors, and 
then the raw signals transferred to the PLC to be converted 
by the A/D converters to digital form to be manipulated by 
the PLC processing unit. The OPC DA server updates its 
cache by the new values available in the PLC according to a 
specified update rate. So a change in the control process 
quantities leads to a change in the OPC DA server cache. 
Hence, to simulate a typical control process we will create a 
software simulation application, which connects to the real 
OPC DA server, and continuously change its cached data. 
The simulation application created using VB.NET 2008 and 
designed to offer many options such as the data change rule 
(Fixed or Random), the number of data changes (Limited or 
Unlimited), and the range for Timer interval in case of 
random data change can be specified, and the changed data 
range can be specified too. In addition, there is a facility to 
start and stop data changing at any time to check the 
behaviors of our proposed approach and other approaches 
with/without data change. The exact time of each data 
change can be stored in a database for analysis purposes. In 
all figures presented in this section we changed the OPC 
data according to the uniform distribution with parameters 
(1, 3). Now to show the extent to which we achieved our 
goals we will compare our approach results to Truong Chau 
et al. [16] approach results, we will use windows Task 
Manager to monitor the web server’s performance measures 
and network bandwidth utilization. Applying Truong 
approach and using simulated OPC data.  We choose the 
timer interval (request rate) for Truong Chau et al. [16] 
approach to be 1 second as they suggested in their paper. 
When we run the experiment, we got the CPU usage as 
shown in Figure 5.  
 
Fig. 5 Truong Approach (CPU load) with Timer interval = 1 sec 
 
 
 Figure 6: Our approach test results (CPU Load). 
As we see in Figure 5, even if there is no data change (check 
the circled areas) the server still working approximately 
with the same CPU usage rate since there is a request 
coming from the client every one second. However, in our 
approach the CPU usage is approximately zero  when there 
is no data change as shown in Figure 6 and that because the 
client does not send a new request until it receives a 
response to the current request and the server does not send 
the response until there is a data change. This means that 
our approach uses the available resources (CPU power and 
network bandwidth) only when there is a need to do so 
(significant data change). Thus we use less computational 
power than previous approaches which proves that our 
approach is more efficient. Also the data transferred through 
network with Truong approach is shown in Figure 7, as 
shown his approach transfers data continuously through 
network (suppose his timer interval is 1 second) regardless 
the data changed or not. However, with our approach the 
data transferred only if there is a data change as indicated by 
the circled areas in Figure 8.

Another experiment we performed using our simulation was 
to calculate the number of request to the web server for each 
change in the target application data. We change the rate of 
data change to be no changes at all, 1 change / 4 seconds, 1 
change / 2 seconds, 1 change/second. Applying Truong 
Chau et al. and our approach we got the following numerical 
data in Table 1.

 As we can see, our approach can adapt to the change 
behavior of the application. The server will send data (use 
the network) to the client only when there is a data change. 
While in previous approaches the server keeps sending data 
to the client even if there is not a data change. For a 
complete set of experiments, please check [1]. 
CONCLUSION 
     As IT technologies progress, web applications will 
replace desktop applications in most of computer 
applications fields especially industrial applications like 
SCADA systems which are now very important in process 
control. AJAX finally enables us to make an efficient web 
based SCADA systems because of the features it offers like 
asynchronous client-server communication and partial page 
update. In addition, Webservices can be used as server side 
scripting. 
Webservices 
provide 
a 
language-neutral, 
environment-neutral programming model that accelerates 
application integration inside and outside the enterprise. 
Application integration through Webservices yields flexible 
loosely coupled business systems. Using AJAX in a proper 
way can give us a very good performance in the server and 
network. In this paper we used AJAX to implement a 
persistent communication between client and server. In 
addition, the threading mechanism used in the Webservice 
was the key concept to achieve this persistent web 
communication. Because of the Internet infrastructure, we 
concluded that data polling is the only viable solution to get 
new data. We showed how our approach for web based 
monitoring and control system adapts to the behavior of the 
target application by responding to the client only when 
there is a data change (the frequency of requests matches the 
frequency of the application data change). Also, that our 
approach is more efficient than previous approaches. In 
addition, we take into account the real time constraints that 
imposed by the nature of the problem. By using as little as 
possible of the available resources (computational power + 
network bandwidth), we improve the responsiveness of the 
application.
