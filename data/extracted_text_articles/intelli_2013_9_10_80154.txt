Abstract— Currently, the method used to analyze the 
manufactured arrow’s performance is to use the accumulated 
impact points of arrow. The impact point of arrow is appeared 
by shooting the arrow repeatedly with same force to a target 
paper using a shooting device. The method has some weak 
points, such as low accuracy, it needs long time to do the 
experiments because the arrow is shoot in several times, and 
difficult to digitize between impact points. Therefore, the 
measuring system for comparing manufactured arrows 
performance 
objectively 
and 
confirming 
quality 
and 
performance of arrow methodically and a sensor that can 
measure high-speed-moving object is needed. In this paper, 
line lasers are placed upper side and left side of a square-
shaped frame, and photodiode sensors are installed at the 
opposite side of line lasers. When fired arrow goes through the 
square shaped frame, the voltage acquisition device measures 
the voltage level difference of photodiodes. Impact points of 
arrow are shown using the data derived by voltage acquisition 
device. A neural network calibration method is implemented 
using impact points which are printed out precisely by 
manufactured grid plate. The calibration method replaces the 
impact points included errors with precision and high 
reliability impact points.

 INTRODUCTION 
Currently, the bow and arrow are used as a tool for 
hunting, recreation, sports to hobbies. Since 1972, at the 
Munich Olympics to date, archery rules have been revised 
and changed drastically. The quality and performance of bow 
and arrow is needed for not only getting a good score at 
Olympics but also increasing of customers demand for 
leisure. Especially, there are plenty of ongoing researches 
about arrow which has complex manufacturing process and 
should analyze scientifically, but there are no systems and 
intuitive numerical data for evaluating [1][2]. The intuitive 
numerical data means information which can be expressed as 
coordinate points, such as distance between impact points, 
two impact point coordinate that has maximum distance, and 
so on. Generally, the method or reference used to evaluate 
arrow's quality and performance is to use data based on 
testimonials by hunters who have used bow and arrow for a 
long time, by technicians who produce leisure sporting goods, 
and by customers. In addition, previous research results 
through patents have biased technology that optimizes 
producing process using manufacturing variables. There is 
testing process for getting performance of arrow. First, attach 
shooting sheet on target. Second, shoot an arrow repeatedly 
with changing angles of nock every time. Third, check 
impact points of arrow and measure how dense they are. The 
denser of impact point, the better of performance and quality 
of the arrow. Analyzing impact point of arrow using 
shooting sheets has some disadvantages, such as low 
accuracy, should be replaced frequently and periodically, and 
the difficulty of digitize between impact points. The other 
way to gather data of arrow's performance is using high-
speed camera, but it has also disadvantages that can see only 
limited angle images, and highly expensive price. For 
overcoming disadvantages of traditional analyze process, this 
paper suggest that by using of line laser and photodiode 
sensors which have high resolution and fast response rate, 
the measurement of high-speed moving arrows produced 
good results. By installing photodiode sensors in array 
formation, it can obtain the voltage level changes in the 
position to be passed by the arrows in the frame. All data 
from the photodiode sensors are acquired by Data 
Acquisition 
Device 
(DAQ), 
produced 
by 
National 
Instruments (NI). Then, they are transferred to Host PC 
connected by port or slot. This transferred data is shown by 
LabVIEW program in PC. However, initially appearing 
impact point of arrow includes errors that occurred by light 
of line laser and structure of photodiode array. To 
compensate the errors, this paper suggests calibration method 
using neural network (NN) [3][4]. 
The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows: 
In section 2, we describe about measuring impact point of 
arrow system. Additionally it describes that previous 
measuring system which has some drawbacks and theoretical 
explains about suggested method. Section 3 gives a 
calibration algorithm using NN. Also it includes experiments 
and results to proof calibration. Finally, a conclusion is 
drawn in section 4 with an outlook to future work.

company are discussed. And also the solving problem by the 
proposed novel hardware structure and method of impact 
point using measuring data are showed. 
A. Problems of impact point measuring system 
Fig. 1 indicates structure of arrow. It consists of point, 
insert, shaft, crest line, fletching, and nock. It also can be 
divided into three parts, each part named arrowhead, shaft of 
arrow, and feathering. Arrowhead is usually made from 
stone or metal which is attached to the end, and its role is to 
penetrate targets substantially. Shaft of arrow is made from 
composite materials, generally produced in the form of 
aluminum core wrapping by carbon fiber. Traditionally, 
feathering is made from feathers. But in modern, it is made 
from plastic materials. It can prevent shaking of arrow, and 
also ensure stability of flight. 
Due to advance manufacturing process and materials, it is 
possible to produce arrows which have not only good quality 
but also good performance, and increased flight distance and 
accuracy. Both flight distance and precise accuracy are 
largely affected by characteristic variables of arrow, such as 
weight, external diameter, spine, straightness, angle and 
shape of feathering. According to these characteristic 
variables, the impact point and flight distance of arrow 
shows different. Hence, there are plenty of researches and 
experiments about impact point’s density by attaching 
shooting sheets on target that find out relations between 
characteristic variable, impact point and flight distance.  But 
in 
case 
of 
measuring 
arrow's 
impact 
points, 
commercialization of technologies and systems are lacking. 
And arrow manufacturing company focuses on patents and 
technologies that optimizing the characteristic variables that 
occurring in production process. That disproportionate 
development caused by difficulties of determining objective 
performance of produced arrow because there is no 
measuring and classifying system of arrow's impact points, 
also there are no data numerically represented. Analyzing 
technology of arrow's impact point density is still in the early 
stage, and there are only a few available measuring platforms 
using handwriting and high-speed camera. Handwriting 
process is shown in Fig. 2b. First, attach shooting sheet on 
rational distance from target. Second, shoot an arrow 
repeatedly changing angles of nock every time. Third, check 
impact points of arrow and measure how dense they are. If 
impact point of an arrow has high density, then the arrow is 
determined that it has good quality and performance. But 
analyzing impact point of arrow using handwriting, there are 
some disadvantages, such as; low accuracy, it should be 
replaced frequently and periodically, and it is hard to digitize 
between impact points. In case of high-speed camera, on the 
other hands, it can compare arrow's shape while flying to 
other arrows using obtained video or images, but it can only 
watch restricted view angles. And it is hard to digitize 
between impact points, like handwriting. Fig. 2a shows the

pictures of launch pad and shooting experiment environment 
which are actually used in manufacturing industry. It is about 
39 meters far from launch pad to target. And the launch pad 
can shoot arrow with the same force. Fig. 2b shows the 
pictures that currently used handwriting impact points of 
arrow result in manufacturing company. 
B. Hardware design for detecing high speed moving object 
In order to solve current system problem that using 
handwriting and high-speed camera, this paper suggests 
hardware design for measuring impact point using novel 
structure and sensors. Photodiode sensor is suitable for 
measuring position of arrow moving in high speed, and 
considering response sensitivity of photodiode, it is 
appropriate pair that red light line laser [5][6][7]. The 
photodiode has 5.6mm diameter, spectral sensitivity is 
450~1050nm range. Power consumption of a line laser is 
100mW, and the laser straightly emits red light laser with 
spread 60 degrees because of inner structure consists of 
small size mirror in the module. Since photodiode is 
converting device that converts light energy to electrical 
energy, so photodiode voltage level changes relying on light 
intensity of line laser. When arrow passes the experimental 
structure consists of photodiode and line laser, namely the 
frame, voltage level changes of photodiode can be measured. 
Based on the measured data, impact point of the arrow can 
be represented. As shown in Fig. 3, two line lasers installed 
in L1, L2 position at the single frame, 80 photodiodes on the 
substrate installed opposite position of line laser. Position of 
the line laser should be placed in the center of photodiode 
substrate. And position should be in the form of coordinates, 
so square-shaped frame is used. The length of one side is 
65cm, and each side is exquisitely crafted in right angle. 
An arrow has high flight speed, average 250km/h and 
maximum 300km/h. For obtaining one point of the high-
speed arrow, sampling time should be about 5ms to 15ms. 
For measuring and dealing with large amount of data, analog 
input module that have high sampling rate and cover lots of 
channels relying on number of photodiodes is needed. 
Therefore, this paper chooses DAQ device, produced by 
National Instruments, which has high sampling rate and can 
handling lots of input channels. In order to measure the data 
that is output from a number of photodiodes, 8:1 
Multiplexers(74HC/HCT4051) are used, and the MUX is 
controlled 3 bit digital signal generated by NI 9401 module. 
Signals from MUX are connected 20 channels as input using 
NI 9205 analog input module. The NI 9205 analog input 
module has maximum 250kS/s on sampling rate, also has 32 
analog input channels. 20 channels used in this paper, and 
20kS/s for each channel. One channel of NI 9205 connected 
to output of MUX, and each MUX cover 8 photodiodes. NI 
cDAQ 9718 8-slot USB chassis performs not only 
synchronizing NI 9401 and NI 9205 module, but also 
sending analog signal that input analog signal from NI 9205 
to Host PC. Trigger signal occurs when arrow is shot on 
launch pad then NI-9178 chassis take the signal as input, and 
acquiring data during 1 second. Due to obtain data for 1 
second, the number of acquiring data from one photodiode is 
2500. The acquired data is sent by computer bus connected 
slot or port from DAQ to Host PC. The computer bus 
performs communication interface between DAQ device and 
computer for transmitting and receiving commands and 
acquired data. Fig. 4 shows hardware design of suggested 
system that starts emitting red light line laser, causes 
changing voltage level of photodiode, DAQ measures the 
changes and finally sends the measured signal to Host PC. 
C. Impact point expresion using voltage level scale 
In previous section, the explanation of devised structure 
for expressing impact point and measuring data generated by 
photodiode sensor using NI DAQ were described. As shown 
in Fig. 5, the flowchart present the entire processes from

sending measured data to Host PC using NI DAQ to 
expressing impact point through processing of the transferred 
signal. When line laser emits light to single photodiode 
sensor, output voltage of the photodiode is about 0.5V. On 
the other hands, if some object makes shadow by passing 
above the single photodiode, then output voltage is dropped 
at about 0.3V.At the moment of shooting arrow the trigger 
signal appeared. After the trigger signal, acquiring time 
begins during 1 second. Due to obtain data for 1 second, the 
number of acquiring data from one photodiode is 2500. The 
voltage dropping levels are slightly different each other 
because of photodiodes sensitivity. And because of line laser 
spreading angle, 60 degree as mentioned earlier, there are 
voltage level difference between photodiodes which located 
center position and photodiodes which located edge of the 
substrate. The center position of photodiodes has higher 
voltage level than the edge position ones. In order to make 
voltage level equivalent, min-max normalization method [8] 
is used. The extracted data is normalized in Host PC, the 
normalized data is used for obtaining center point of 
photodiodes that changing the voltage level because of shade 
of arrow, finally initial impact point is expressed including 
errors. Errors that occurring square-shape steel structure for 
measuring arrow's impact point are calibrated using NN. 
If an arrow passes through single frame, shade occurs by 
the arrow in A, B region that part of photodiode array as 
shown in Fig. 6. Due to the shade by the arrow, voltage level 
of photodiode sensor drops. Using the voltage level of the 
photodiode and its index, center of photodiodes is derived. 
For finding center point of photodiode shaded by the arrow, 
equation of finding center of mass [9] is used, and it is 
represented in,

CALIBRATION AND RESULT OF ARROW’S IMPACT 
POINT USING NEURAL NETWORK 
The calibration algorithm for improving precision of 
measuring arrow’s impact point using grid calibration plate 
is applied. The grid calibration plate has grid points that have 
1cm interval each other and the plate attached on single 
frame. The measuring data before applying calibration 
algorithm using grid plate at the frame and each grid point 
that the position of arrow is shown in Fig. 7. In the figure, 
the measuring data before applying calibration algorithm 
shows gradually increasing tendency of error through center 
to edge of frame. Neural network method with back 
propagation learning is used as calibration algorithm. NNs 
are systems that are deliberately constructed to make use of 
some organizational principles resembling those of the 
human brain. A number of recent reviews have identified a

its learning rate is 0.01. The activation function of hidden

CONCLUSION 
This paper suggests that the novel structure can measure 
impact point of arrow, the sensor can detect high-speed 
moving object, and the system can represent impact point of 
the arrow using the voltage level change of photodiode 
sensor. In order to make measuring system, square-shaped 
steel frame is produced which length of one side is 65cm, 
and the photodiode sensor and line laser is attached at the 
frame. When an arrow passes the frame, NI 9205 device is 
acquiring voltage level changes of photodiode sensor at any 
points, and sending the data to Host PC through NI cDAQ-
9178. Changing interval is extracted using the voltage level 
of photodiode sensor, and the impact point of arrow is 
represented by index and voltage drop size of the photodiode. 
But the represented impact point includes error due to 
structure of substrate that designed for detecting high-speed 
moving object and angle of light emitted by line laser. 
Therefore, the represented impact point is distorted at this 
moment. For solving this problem of impact point, 
calibration method is applied using NN. After calibration, 
average error is decreasing from 3.17mm to 0.62mm. Now, it 
can digitize among the impact points, also the result can be 
used as manufacturing variables that use for performance 
analyzing with other arrows and also making arrow. Our 
proposed measurements method is a reflection in the 
manufacturing process that classifying manufactured arrow 
characteristics, choosing appropriate arrow for user, and 
determining quality and performance objectively.
