Abstract - IEEE 802.16 based Worldwide interoperability for 
Microwave Access (WiMAX) provides broadband wireless 
access with integration of variety of applications such as voice, 
video and data with different Quality of Service (QoS) 
requirements. In WiMAX, MAC layer scheduling is an integral 
part of providing QoS to variety of services. In this paper, a 
hybrid WiMAX scheduler has been proposed and analytically 
modeled using Markov chain. The proposed scheduler consists 
of homogeneous scheduler, Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ), 
strict priority and a Round Robin (RR) scheduler. Analytical 
modeling is carried out to investigate whether the proposed 
scheduler achieves the design goals namely low complexity, 
satisfying QoS requirements of a variety of applications, 
maintaining fairness among all applications. Markovian model 
balance equations are obtained and solved using matrix 
multiplication method to derive the performance metrics for 
comparison, such as throughput, mean queuing delay, and 
packet loss probability of each traffic and interclass fairness. 
The analytical results show that the proposed hybrid scheduler 
satisfies not only the QoS requirements of various applications 
but improves fairness among services.

 INTRODUCTION 
 
Increased demand for support of triple play services 
(voice, video and data) and high speed internet access led to 
the development of Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks 
(WMAN). WiMAX provides advantages of long range 
communication and support for QoS at the MAC layer as 
compared to other access technologies. Various QoS 
constraints are achieved at MAC layer by differentiation of 
traffic types through five service classes as defined by the 
standard: Unsolicited Grant Services (UGS), extended real 
time Polling Service (ertPS), real time Polling Service 
(rtPS),  non real time polling service (nrtPS) and Best Effort 
(BE). In WiMAX, Base Station (BS) implements the 
scheduling for both uplink and downlink connections to 
allocate slots for channel utilization [1]. Although standard 
has defined the service classes, scheduling mechanism has 
not been defined. Scheduler at BS transforms the QoS 
requirements of Subscriber Stations (SSs) into appropriate 
number of slots. BS then informs each SS about the 
scheduling decision through UpLink MAP (ULMAP) and 
DownLink (DLMAP) messages at the beginning of each 
frame.  
WiMAX schedulers can be broadly classified into 
homogeneous, hybrid and opportunistic. Homogeneous 
schedulers are based on legacy scheduling algorithms. 
Homogeneous schedulers are also known as channel 
unaware schedulers as they do not take care of channel 
error, packet loss rates and power level into consideration. 
They serve as intraclass schedulers. Hybrid scheduler is a 
combination of legacy schedulers while opportunistic 
scheduler considers the variability in channel condition [2]. 
 
In this paper, an improved hybrid scheduler is proposed 
and analyzed, for four different applications such as voice, 
video, data and web traffic. The proposed improved 
scheduler not only satisfies QoS requirements of real time 
and non real time applications, but also provides high 
fairness among all applications as compared to the existing 
three queue scheduler proposed in the literature [3]. The 
hybrid scheduler is analyzed using Markovian model and 
the balance equations obtained from Markovian model are 
solved using matrix multiplication method to derive the 
performance metrics for comparison such as throughput, 
queuing delay and packet loss probability of each traffic and 
fairness among various applications. The average rate at 
which packets pass through a scheduler at steady state is 
termed as throughput. Packet loss probability of a traffic 
class is the probability that no space is available in the 
corresponding buffer.  
 
Various studies have focused on analytical modeling of 
hybrid schedulers. In the field of networking, Markov 
models have been widely used to model the behavior of 
communication networks under variable traffic load 
conditions. In [4], queue decomposition method was 
proposed which divided the Priority Queuing (PQ) system 
into a group of Single-Server Single-Queue (SSSQ) to 
obtain their service capacities. Queue length distributions of 
individual traffic are investigated through analytical 
modeling. In this paper, the hybrid scheduler is modeled as 
a Markov chain and stationary probabilities are obtained 
using closed loop expressions and matrix geometric method.  
 
In [5], priority queuing traffic is divided into 
heterogeneous Long Range Dependent (LRD) self similar 
and Short Range Dependent (SRD) Poisson traffic and is 
analytically modeled by Priority Qeueing- Generalized 
Processor Sharing (PQ-GPS) scheduling mechanism. In 
order to deal with heterogeneous traffic, they extended the 
Schilder’s theorem and developed the analytical upper and 
lower bounds of queue length distributions of individual 
traffic flows. A model based on G/M/1 queuing system is

proposed in [6] to take into account multiple classes of 
traffic that exhibit long range dependencies and self 
similarity among traffic. The authors in [6] developed a 
Markov chain for non preemptive priority scheduling which 
is solved to extract a numerical solution for proposed 
analytical framework. The accuracy of the model is 
demonstrated by comparing the numerical solution of the 
analytical 
modeling 
to 
simulation 
experiments 
and 
compared with the actual test bed results. 
 
A discrete time priority queue with two layered general 
arrival process is analyzed in [7] in which higher priority is 
given to small fraction of the requests applications that 
generate large revenues and to applications with small size 
request. 
By 
using 
probability 
generating 
functions, 
performance measures of the queue such as the moments of 
the packet delays of both classes are calculated. Through 
analysis, [8] developed several upper bounds on the queue 
length distribution of GPS with Long Range Dependent 
(LRD) traffic, extending the same to packet based GPS. 
These bounds show that long range dependency and queue 
length distribution of LRD traffic is not affected by the 
presence of other sources. A notion of LRD isolation has 
been introduced in [8] that broadens the range of services 
offered by GPS system by admitting the traffic of low 
priority. 
A hybrid scheduler based on the integration of PQ and WFQ 
schedulers is proposed in [3]. Traffic arrival processes are 
represented by non bursty Poisson process and bursty 
Markov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP). The model 
consists of three separate buffers representing three traffic 
flows. The strict priority scheduler assigns highest priority 
to ertPS traffic and the scheduler WFQ schedules the rtPS 
traffic and nrtPS traffic.  
 
A scheduler for UL and DL is proposed in [9]. Based 
on the QoS requirements and priority of services classes 
needed, resources are calculated and granted in terms of 
number of slots. The calculation of resources depend on 
bandwidth requirements of each connection and ensuring 
that it does not exceed maximum requirement of each 
connection. UL scheduler calculates number of slots needed 
by taking into account the polling interval while DL 
scheduler considers packet size for calculation of number of 
slots needed. Simulation results show that scheduler fulfills 
delay and throughput requirements of all service classes of 
WiMAX. An analytical model for performance evaluation 
of WiMAX networks is developed in [10]. A one 
dimensional Markov chain is developed which takes into 
account frame structure, precise slot sharing based 
scheduling and channel conditions. Closed form expressions 
are derived for the scheduling policies to satisfy slot fairness 
and throughput fairness. Opportunistic scheduling is 
considered to derive the performance metrics.   
 
A mathematical analysis is performed for an uplink 
scheduling algorithm, named “courteous algorithm” which 
gives advantage to lower priority traffic class without 
affecting traffic of higher priority [11]. In this scheme 
scheduling of nrtPS traffic is improved while satisfying the 
delay constraints of rtPS traffic. In case maximum packet 
loss rate has not reached, lower priority traffic is served over 
higher priority as long as the maximum waiting time of 
higher priority traffic is not violated. Various performance 
parameters such as mean waiting time, waiting time for 
courteous packets, maximum burst size and packet priority 
are calculated using mathematical model and validated by a 
simulation. An analytical modeling of MAC protocol of 
WiMAX network is applied through queuing theory and 
Markov chain in [12] to analyze average message delays for 
real time and non real time applications. 
 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: 
Section 2 provides a brief description of proposed hybrid 
scheduler. The analytical modeling of proposed hybrid 
scheduler is outlined in Section 3. The results are analyzed 
and discussed in Section 4. Finally the paper is concluded in 
Section 5.

 DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED HYBRID 
SCHEDULER 
 
 
In this section, proposed hybrid scheduling algorithm 
for the BS and SS in WiMAX system is presented. The 
main objective of the proposed scheme is to provide QoS to 
both real time and non real time applications. The scheduler 
is implemented at the BS for uplink scheduling. Hybrid 
scheduler, consisting of WFQ, RR and strict priority, 
combines the advantages of well known scheduler strategies 
to provide QoS in a communication network [13].  
       Figure 1 illustrates the proposed hybrid scheduler that 
provides scheduling among four service classes of WiMAX 
namely ertPS, rtPS, nrtPS and BE. The incoming traffic is 
assigned to four separate buffers (Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4) and 
each queue is served in First Come First Serve (FCFS) 
manner. As the packets of real time traffic such as voice and 
video, cannot tolerate higher delay they are given higher 
priority than non real time traffic. ErtPS and rtPS packets 
are served before nrtPS and BE packets of non real time 
traffic such as data traffic.

The packets of ertPS and rtPS are buffered in queues Q1 
and Q2 respectively and are served by the scheduler WFQ. 
Packets of nrtPS and BE traffic are placed in queues Q3 and 
Q4 respectively and are served by the scheduler RR. Queues 
Q1 and Q2 are each assigned a weight representing the 
maximum number of packets to be served in each round. 
The weight for queue Q1 is varied from lowest value of 10% 
to highest value of 90% for ertPS traffic and simultaneously 
weight of queue Q2 for rtPS traffic is varied from 90% to 
10%.  
 
III. ANALYTICAL MODELLING OF PROPOSED 
HYBRID SCHEDULER 
 
 
The analytical model of the proposed scheme consists 
of single server multiple queues one for each service class 
subjected to hybrid scheduling.  The system is represented 
by M/M/1/K queuing with queues (Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4) of 
size K1, K2, K3 and K4 respectively. The input traffic is a 
Poisson process and the arrival rate for class c is λc. The 
service time has exponential distribution with service rates 
µ1, µ2, µ3 and µ4 and the service capacity of the system is s. 
The hybrid scheduler is represented by a Markov chain with 
the state space diagram for the proposed hybrid scheduler 
diagram shown as in Figure 2. A state Pmnrs represents the 
number of packets m, n, r, s for classes ertPS, rtPS, nrtPS 
and BE in their respective buffers. A packet added to queue 
Q1 changes the state from Pmnrs to Pm+1nrs. Servicing a packet 
from queue Q1 will change the state from Pmnrs to Pm-1nrs. 
Similarly the state of each queue changes depending on 
whether a packet is added to it or serviced from it.

Matrix multiplication method approach is used to 
determine the steady state or limiting state probability of the 
system. The π matrix represents the steady state probability 
vector and satisfies equations (1) and (2) [3]. 
 
 Q = 0                                     (1) 
 
 e = 1                                        (2) 
 
Where e = (1, 1, 1……1)T  is a unit column vector of length 
(K1+1)x(K2+1)x(K3+1)x(K4+1)x1 and Q is a generator 
matrix and π is a steady sate probability column vector. The 
multiplication of these matrices provide balance equations 
which are further solved to obtain the steady state 
probabilities. 
 
 The probability   
  of having m packets of class c (c = 
1, 2, 3, 4) in the corresponding buffer can be calculated 
from joint state probability pijkl using equations (3) to (6)

IV. 
ANALYSIS OF RESULTS 
 
 
This section deals with investigation on the impact of 
weights of traffic flows scheduled by WFQ on the 
performance metrics: throughput, queuing delay, packet loss 
probability of each traffic class and fairness. The size of the 
buffer for queues (Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4) is set to be 1 for each 
queue. The mean service rate s is 10. The service rate for 
queue 1 increases from 1 to 9 corresponding to increase in 
weight ratio from 10% to 90%. Simultaneously, the service 
rate for queue 2 varies from 9 to 1 corresponding to 
reduction in weight ratio from 90% to 10%. The idea behind 
varying weights is to find the optimum weight at which the 
design goals are achieved for proposed hybrid scheduler 
model Queues Q3 and Q4 are scheduled by RR; therefore, 
both are serviced with same weight. 
 
Class 1 traffic, carried by ertPS service class, represents 
audio traffic which requires a lower delay, while higher or 
lower throughput does not affect much the quality of audio 
traffic. Thus requirement of low delay is mandatory for 
ertPS. RtPS service class, representing streaming video 
traffic, also requires a low delay but the requirement is not 
so stringent. Class 3 traffic, carried by nrtPS, represents the 
web traffic for which the  requirement of high throughput is 
mandatory and low delay and low throughput is optional. 
Class 4 traffic, carried by BE, is the data traffic requiring 
high throughput.  
 
Figure 3 shows the variation of mean queuing delay of 
each traffic class with respect to variation in weight ratio of 
WFQ scheduler. The graph shows that the queuing delay of 
class 1 traffic is reduced with the increase in weight of class 
1 traffic since with the increase in weight more packets are 
serviced from queue and the queue delay is reduced. When 
the weight of class 1 traffic increases, the weight of class 2 
traffic is reduced, causing an increased delay as a smaller 
number of packets is being serviced. Class 3 and class 4 
traffic show a similar behavior as both are scheduled by RR. 
Figure 4 shows the variation of throughput for each traffic 
class with respect to variations in the weight ratio of 
scheduler WFQ. Figure 4 shows that as the weight for class 
1 or class 2 traffic is increased, throughput also increases as 
more number of packets depart from the buffer. Class 4 has 
the highest arrival rate (λ4 )  of 4 while class 3 has arrival 
rate of 3. Therefore, it is observed that the throughput for 
class 4 is the highest. 
 
Figure 5 shows the variation of packet loss probability 
of each traffic class with respect to variation in weight ratio 
of WFQ scheduler. The figure shows that as the weight of 
87

class 1 traffic increases, the packet loss probability reduces 
as mean number of packets in the queue reduces, due to 
higher service rate. Similar behavior is displayed for class 2 
traffic. Class 3 and class 4 traffic have highest packet loss 
probability as both are given lower priority than class 1 and 
class 2 traffic. As long as there are packets in class 1 or 
class 2 traffic buffer queues, lower priority class 3 or class 4 
traffic is not served. 
 
Figure 6 shows the variation of fairness with respect  to 
increase in weight ratio of WFQ scheduler. The interclass 
fairness is the highest for a weight ratio of 9:1. For 
satisfying low delay requirement of class 1 and class 2 
traffic, weight ratio 8:2 can be considered to be optimum as 
at this weight class 1 traffic has lower delay while class 2 
traffic also has lower delay. At a weight ratio of 9:1 class 1 
has lowest delay but class 2 has maximum delay verifying 
that it is not the  optimum choice. At a weight ratio of 8:2, 
class 3 and class 4 have higher throughput than class 1 and 
class 2. Though they have the highest throughput at a 
weight ratio of 5: 5, at this ratio, class 1 traffic does not have 
a lower delay. Therefore, weight ratio of 8:2 satisfies the 
delay requirement of class 1 and class 2 traffic. It also 
satisfies the throughput requirement of class 3 and class 4. 
With respect to interclass fairness, weight ratio 9:1 is 
optimum as it provides highest fairness but at this weight 
ratio QoS requirements of all traffic classes are not satisfied. 
The proposed model not only satisfies QoS requirements of 
all service classes but also provides high fairness among all 
the traffic classes with a complexity of O(N) [13].

proposed in [3] with respect to variation in weight ratio of 
WFQ scheduler. The figure shows that the proposed 
improved scheduler provides better fairness at high weight 
ratio and almost the same fairness at lower weight ratio. 
Hence the proposed improved scheduler is more fair to all 
service classes than the scheduler proposed in [3].

applications served by class 1 and throughput of non real 
time application served by class 3. The class 1 traffic in case 
I is provided highest priority while class 1 traffic in case II 
is scheduled by WFQ.  Therefore, the PLP and queuing 
delay of class 1 for case I are lower as compared to that of 
class 1 of case II. Class 2 traffic in both cases is served by 
WFQ. Case II provides lower PLP and queuing delay for 
lower weight.  
 
The comparison shows that the proposed improved 
hybrid scheduler satisfies the major objective of fairness 
among all service classes along with satisfying the QoS 
requirements of voice, video and data traffic.

V.  CONCLUSION 
 
 
WiMAX supports deployment of triple play services by 
providing QoS through scheduling at MAC layer. This 
paper proposes a WiMAX hybrid scheduler for triple play 
services. WFQ, RR and strict priority schedulers are 
integrated in proposed scheduler to perform scheduling. 
Analysis of the proposed scheduler is carried out using 
queuing theory and Markov chain for deriving expressions 
for performance metrics, such as throughput, mean queuing 
delay, and packet loss probability to investigate the 
effectiveness of proposed hybrid scheduler in satisfying 
design goals. Weight ratio is changed to investigate its 
effect on performance metrics and to discover the optimum 
weight which satisfies design goals of a scheduler. Proposed 
scheduler satisfies QoS requirements of a variety of 
applications and it maintains fairness among all applications 
at a complexity of O (N). It can be used in non bursty 
applications where fairness is the main issue along with 
satisfaction of QoS requirements. The proposed scheduler 
can provide the flexibility in varying the weights of various 
traffic classes for achieving better design objective as per 
the application and requirement.
