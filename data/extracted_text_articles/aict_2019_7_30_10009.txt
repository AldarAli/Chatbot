Abstract—This article discusses the inﬂuence of an effective
energy management strategy in nodes of elastic optical networks
on the loss probability for calls of individual trafﬁc classes. The
structure of the network node is based on the architecture of a 3-
stage optical Clos switching network. A key feature of the energy
management strategy consists in switching off unused switches
of the middle stage of the switching network.
Keywords–Optical switching network; Energy saving; Loss pro-
bability; Clos switching network.

INTRODUCTION
Backbone networks are comprised of multiple facilities that
transmit large amounts of data between the network access
points over long distances through interconnected smaller
networks, such as local or metropolitan networks. Typically,
backbone networks offer large transmission speeds. For ex-
ample, one ﬁber optic link is capable of transporting up to
560 channels in a C-band or 360 channels in the L-band. The
possibility of effective use of such a large number of available
channels to achieve high bitrates (along with different bitrates
depending on different demands by users) is provided by
a successful implementation of the concept of Elastic Optical
Networks [1]–[3]. For competitive provision of services with
high bitrates backbone networks demand huge amounts of
energy necessary for sustainable transmission of signals in
the optical ﬁber. The bulk of network devices that serve as
backbone network nodes are designed with the assumption
that trafﬁc offered to inputs of devices has constant value. The
reality is, however, that this trafﬁc is changeable in time. This,
in turn, leads to a situation where the system does not need
as much network resources to service a given trafﬁc intensity.
When this is the case, constant power supply to all elements of
a device/network node is not necessary. With the application of
an appropriate energy management strategy, that can be based
on temporary disabling of elements of active network nodes,
we are in position to decrease the amount of supplied energy
to devices when trafﬁc load offered to them is slight). Then, in
a situation where network trafﬁc offered to the nodes increases,
additional active elements of a device can be activated.
The issues of energy saving in network devices, as well as
in systems/elements used in constructing nodes of the network
are highly topical, while the increasing number of relevant
publications that have been published over the years clearly
testiﬁes the interest in this innovative ﬁeld [4]–[9].
In this article, the authors show the inﬂuence of the app-
lied energy management strategy in a 3-stage Clos switching
network on the loss probability for calls in this network. The
structure of a large number of present-day network devices
that serve as network nodes is based on the Clos structure.
The investigated energy-saving management strategy will be
based on switching-off individual switches of the middle stage
in a 3-stage Clos switching network. Then, the inﬂuence of the
number of active switches of the middle stage of the optical
network on the values of loss probabilities for individual call
classes that are offered to the network will be investigated.
The article is structured as follows. Section 2 presents
the method for allocating network resources in elastic optical
networks and proposes a deﬁnition of the frequency slot unit.
Section 3 discusses the structure of the optical switching
network and the structure of trafﬁc offered to the network and
presents a description of the path choice algorithm used to ﬁnd
an optimal sequence of choices to reach a certain connection
in optical switching networks. Section 4 includes a description
of the simulator (input data, simulation algorithm and the
condition of termination). Section 5 shows the results of the
simulation experiments for the optical switching networks in
which the switches of the middle stage were switched off.
Section 6 concludes the article.

ELASTIC OPTICAL NETWORKS
According to the information given in [2], ﬁxed and
ﬂexible Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM)
frequency grids are available. The advantage of the ﬂexible
grid architecture, that forms the basic underlying structure for
Elastic Optical Networks (EON), is the possibility of using
elastic allocation of network resources. The optical spectrum
(e.g., C-band or L-band optical spectrum) available for EONs
is divided into frequency slots with ﬁxed spectral width equal
to 12.5 GHz [2]. In thus deﬁned slots optical connections
are allocated, while the number neighboring frequency slots
occupied by them depends on the demanded bitrate and on
the applied modulation technique. According to the elastic
frequency grid, standardized by the ITU-T [10], channel bands
are allocated following a given nominal center frequency fnom
and the channel width ω which is the multiple of 12.5 GHz:
ω = 12.5 × m,
(1)
where m is a positive integer number, whereas 12.5 GHz
is the so-called Frequency Slot Unit (FSU) [11]. The center
frequency for particular channels (slots) is determined on the
basis of the following formula:
fnom = 193.1 + n × 0.00625,

Figure 1. Structure of 3-stage optical Clos network
where n is an integer number, whereas 0.00625 is a ﬁxed
frequency shift, expressed in THz. To sum up, in order for an
optical channel to be created in an EON network, beside the
allocation of the value of the central frequency fnom (similarly
as in the allocation of wavelength in Wavelength Division
Multiplexing (WDM)), the spectrum ω occupied by it should
be also allocated.

STRUCTRURE OF SWITCHING NETWORK
A. Structure of 3-stage optical Clos network
Figure 1 shows a 3-stage Clos switching network. The
network is composed of square υ × υ switches. The switches
of the ﬁrst and third stages make it possible for both the
frequency slot (wavelength) and the output of a switch (optical
ﬁber) to be changed, whereas the switches of the middle stage
allow a change to be introduced in the output only. Each link
in the switching network has the capacity equal to f FSUs.
In addition, one link from each of the switches of the last
stage belongs to one of υ directions. The energy management
strategy introduced in the switching network allows us to
switch off unused middle stage switches.
B. Structure of offered trafﬁc
The switching network (Figure 1) is offered m independent
Erlang call streams with the intensities: λ1, λ2, ..., λi, ..., λm.
The demanded FSUs related to particular trafﬁc classes are:
t1, t2, ..., ti, ..., tm, respectively. Service times for calls of all
classes have exponential distributions with the parameters:
µ1, µ2, ..., µi, ..., µm.
C. Path choice algorithms
Two algorithms for the point-to-group and point-to-point
connection path choice can be used in the switching network.
One of the two path choice algorithms in the switching network
should be selected prior to the activation of the simulation
program.
The point-to-group algorithm performs the following
steps [12]:
Step 1: The counter of the attempts of setting up a con-
nection is set to l = 1.
Step 2: Determination of the switch of the ﬁrst stage at the
input of which a call of class i appeared.
Step 3: Finding the switch of the last stage that has a
free output link and has ti free (consecutive)
FSUs in the demanded direction. If none of the
switches of the last stage have free ti FSUs in
the demanded direction, the call is lost due to the
external blocking. In the instance where there are
more than one switch of the last stage that have a
free output link in the demanded direction, one of
them is chosen randomly.
Step 4: An attempt to set up a connection between the
selected switch of the ﬁrst and last sections.
◦ If successful – the connection is set up. The
operation of the algorithm is terminated. When
there are more than one connection paths bet-
ween the switches of the ﬁrst and third stages,
then one connecting path is chosen randomly.
◦ If unsuccessful, and the counter of attempts is
l < υ, the algorithm returns to Step 3 and the
number of attempts is increased l = l + 1.
◦ If unsuccessful, and the counter of attempts
is l = υ, the call is lost due to the internal
blocking. The operation of the algorithm is
terminated.
The point-to-point algorithm works as follows [13]:
Step 1: Determination of a switch of the ﬁrst stage at the
output of which a call of class i appeared.
Step 2: Finding a switch of the last stage that has a free
output link and has ti free (consecutive) FSUs
in the demanded direction. If none of the swit-
ches of the last stage have free ti FSUs in the
demanded direction, the call is lost due to the
external blocking. In the case where more than
one switch of the last stage have a free output link
in the demanded direction, one of them is chosen
randomly.
Step 3: An attempt to set up a connection between the
selected switches of the ﬁrst and last stages.
◦ If successful – the connection is set up. The
operation of the algorithm is terminated. When
there are more than one connection paths bet-
ween the switches of the ﬁrst and third stages,
then one of them is selected randomly.
◦ If unsuccessful, the call is lost due to internal
blocking. The operation of the algorithm is
terminated.
IV.
OPERATION OF THE SIMULATION PROGRAM
A. Input data
The simulator was written by the authors in C++ language
using process interaction method. The input data for the simu-
lator are the capacity and structure of the switching network.
For each trafﬁc class, the number of demanded FSUs and
service time are given. The average value of trafﬁc offered to a
single FSU in the system is also given. To perform simulation
tests in the switching network composed of the switches with
υ × υ links in which the capacity of a single link is f FSUs,
the values of the following parameters are to be introduced:
• the number m of offered trafﬁc classes,
131
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2019.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-727-6
AICT 2019 : The Fifteenth Advanced International Conference on Telecommunications

• the number ti of demanded FSUs necessary to set up a
connection of class i and average service time µ−1
i
for a
call of class i,
• average trafﬁc a offered to a single FSU in the output
direction,
• the number of ﬁrst-stage, middle-stage and last-stage
switches.
On the basis of these parameters, the intensity λi of calls
generated by sources of a given type of trafﬁc stream can
be determined in the simulator. Therefore, the parameter λi,
depending on the average trafﬁc offered to a single FSU, can
be determined on the basis of the following formula:
m
X
i=1
λi/µiti = afυυ.
(3)
The parameter determined on the basis of Formula (3) can
be treated as the exponential distribution parameter that des-
cribes the process of the occurrence of new calls of individual
trafﬁc classes.
B. General simulation algorithm
The general algorithm according to which the simulation
program is performed can be illustrated in the following steps
that are in line with the process interaction method:
Step 1: Initial conﬁguration of a simulation model – cre-
ation of a list of all sources generating calls of
different trafﬁc classes.
Step 2: Resetting the count of system time to zero.
Step 3: Activation of trafﬁc sources and placement of
events (occurrence of a new call) in the list.
Step 4: Checking the condition of termination for the
simulation. If the condition of termination is sa-
tisﬁed, the simulation is terminated and the results
are stored in a ﬁle.
Step 5: Updating system time to the time of the occurrence
of the ﬁrst event from the list (occurrence of a new
call, termination of call service).
Step 6: Execution of the ﬁrst event from the list.
Step 7: Removal of the ﬁrst event from the list and return
to Step 4.
Two events are then identiﬁed and deﬁned for the switching
network simulation model: occurrence of a new call and
termination of call service. According to the process inte-
raction method these events are serviced by one function. Thus
described approach allows us to deﬁne a large number of trafﬁc
classes in the system.
Consider then a system in which m Erlang trafﬁc classes
have been deﬁned. In the initial conﬁguration of the system,
it is necessary to plan (predict) the occurrence of a call of
class i. The function that executes events related to Erlang
trafﬁc sources for the point-to-point selection (in the case of
the point-to-group selection step 2(b) has to be repeated for
each free link of the demanded output direction, if the earlier
attempt failed to execute the connection) can be described as
follows:
Step 1: Planning (prediction) of the occurrence of a new
call of class i according to exponential distribution,
where the parameter is the intensity λi. Placement
of the event in the list.
Step 2: Checking if the system has enough resources for
the call to be admitted for service:
a) Checking if any of the links in the demanded
output direction have at least ti free (neighbo-
ring) FSUs. If not - the call is lost due to the
external blocking.
b) Checking if there is a connecting path between
the input link at which a call has occurred and an
output link in the demanded output direction that
has at least ti free (consecutive) FSUs, where
free FSUs are meant to be ﬁnding the same
frequency slots between switches of the ﬁrst and
the second stages and switches of the second and
the third stages. If not – the call is lost due to
the internal blocking.
If any of the conditions a) or b) are not satisﬁed,
the next steps are not executed.
Step 3: Occupancy of the resources demanded by a call of
class i.
Step 4: Planning of the termination of service according to
the exponential distribution, where the parameter
is the intensity λi. Placement of the event in the
list.
Step 5: Service termination and release of resources.
C. The condition of termination in the simulation
The condition of termination for the simulation experiment
is, with a determination of the loss probability, the counted
appropriate number of generated calls of the least active class
(typically, it is the class with the highest number of demanded
FSUs). The mean result is calculated on the basis of 5 series.
In practice, to obtain 95%-conﬁdence intervals of not more
than 5% of the mean value of the results obtained on the basis
of simulation experiments, about 1,000,000 calls of the least
active class are necessary to be generated. Conﬁdence intervals
are determined in the following way:

¯X − tα
σ
√r; ¯X + tα
σ
√r

(4)
where ¯X is the arithmetic mean calculated from r results (si-
mulation courses), tα is the value of the t-Student distribution
for r−1 degrees of freedom. The parameter σ that determines
standard deviation is calculated from the following formula:
σ2 =
1
1 − r
r
X
s=1
x2
s −
r
r − 1
¯X2,
(5)
where xs is the result obtained in the s-th course of the
simulation.

RESULTS
The simulator makes it possible to investigate switching
networks with any number υ of inputs/outputs in a single
switch and any number υ of outer-stage and arbitrary number
of middle-stage switches in the switching network.
The number of demanded FSUs necessary to set up a
connection of individual trafﬁc classes not only depends on the
required transmission speed, but also on the type of applied
modulation format or range. For example, using the data given
in [3], Table I shows the number of FSUs demanded by calls of
trafﬁc classes in relation to the type of modulation and range.

Figure 7. Loss probability for class 3 calls in System 2 with point-to-point

are indicated with a separate line in the graph. Figures 4 and
7 show the loss probability for the classes that demand the
highest number of FSUs to set up a connection. It is easily
noticeable that with a decrease in the number of switches of the
middle stage to 3, the loss probability increases signiﬁcantly.
A different situation occurs with the case of the classes that
demand the least number of FSUs (Figures 2 and 5). Here,
switching off one or two switches in the middle stage is
obviously followed by an increase in the loss probability, even
though the obtained values for low loads of the system are
still acceptable from an engineering point of view. Decreasing
the number of middle stage switches has less impact on the
increase in the blocking probability for classes requiring a
smaller number of FSUs. For classes requiring a larger number
of FSUs, the impact is already signiﬁcant.

CONCLUSION
This article presents the results of a study on the inﬂuence
of energy management strategies on the loss probability in
optical Clos switching networks. The simulation program
presented in the article makes it possible to determine the
loss probability in optical switching networks to which Erlang
trafﬁc is offered. The program can be applied to evaluate and
assess when and with what load switches of the middle stage
can be switched off in order to save energy. In future, the
program can be used to verify analytical models of elastic
optical switching networks in which an energy saving strategy
is used.
