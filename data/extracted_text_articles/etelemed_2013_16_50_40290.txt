Abstract—Seizures are both the most common neurological
emergency afﬂicting neonates and the most difﬁcult to detect
clinically. Currently, the monitoring of a multi-channel electroen-
cephalogram (EEG) is the gold standard for seizure detection.
The accurate analysis of this physiological data requires a neuro-
physiologist with expertise in neonatal EEG. The provisioning of
this expertise on a continuous basis can be challenging for medical
facilities. In this paper, we describe a cloud-based platform
capable of supporting clinicians through the creation of expert
knowledge repositories. While the platform is considered general
purpose, in this work it is applied speciﬁcally to neonatal EEG.

I. INTRODUCTION
There is a correlation between the quality of care given to
a patient and the availability of expert knowledge, particularly
that which enables specialist care [1]. Therefore, there is a
need for a platform capable of alleviating issues affecting the
provisioning of this expert knowledge. We propose a platform
that would be capable of broadening the scope of expertise,
both human and machine, available to medical centres.
The ScrutiniseIT platform is based on a scan-and-scrutinise
methodology. It incorporates the scalability beneﬁts of cloud
computing, enabling large volumes of physiological data to be
continuously analysed for the identiﬁcation of features of inter-
est. It relies on expert annotations to the data and an algorithm
designed to search through existing data repositories. The scan
phase of the algorithm runs continually on data streams being
acquired. A simple evaluation function is used to determine
data segments that warrant closer examination. Upon detection
of a potential feature of interest, that section of the stream
is more closely scrutinised. The scrutinise phase determines
if particular features of interest are present in the candidate
signal. This is done within a speciﬁed conﬁdence interval.
ScrutiniseIT is a live platform that affords clinicians the
ability to collaboratively enhance one another’s work. Clini-
cians annotate new data to highlight the occurrence of inter-
esting features, this data becomes part of the overall annotated
data repository. Subsequent processing of the data repository
will be inﬂuenced by these contributions, thus improving the
quality of the system over time.
The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: Section
II provides an overview of related work on classiﬁcation
techniques for seizures in EEG, Section III describes the
technologies that make up the system and provides details
of their implementation, Section IV outlines our proposals
for the experimental evaluation of the platform. Finally, our
conclusions and future work are discussed in Section V.
II. RELATED WORK
Numerous EEG seizure detection algorithms, using a variety
of signal processing techniques, have been described in the
literature. In [2], the authors present a neural network based
system that operates in ﬁve stages: ﬁltering, artifact detection,
feature extraction (of both candidate and non candidate data),
redundancy and relevance analysis. In [3], the author proposes
the use of Discrete Wavelet Transformation, in an effort to
ﬁnd an improved time frequency representation of EEG and
improve classiﬁcation results.
In [4] three algorithms (Celka et al., Gotman et al. and
Liu et al.) for the automated analysis of neonatal EEG are
evaluated. The algorithms employ a variety of classiﬁcation

techniques, such as modelling, complexity analysis, rhythmic
discharge detection and auto-correlative functions. The algo-
rithms were found to have sensitivities ranging from 42.9% to
66.1% and speciﬁcities ranging from 54% to 90.2%.
In [5], it is argued that classiﬁer based approaches are too
rigid due to large variance in a neonate’s signal frequency,
morphology and topography. Instead, the authors attempt to
mimic the behaviour of human experts through the creation
of an algorithm that recognises the characteristics that enable
humans to detect seizures. The algorithm focuses on the
background EEG and the recurrence of patterns in the signal
as a means of providing automated neonatal seizure detection.
While this is an interesting approach, it can be considered a
variant of traditional classiﬁcation techniques.
III. PLATFORM OVERVIEW
The algorithms described in Section II tend to use tried-and-
tested signal processing techniques. However, this approach
results in a static system that tries to identify seizures based
on a single formula that does not change. The platform
described in this paper uses a novel search-based approach
to seizure detection that relies on comparison with a growing
body of historical data. As such, it does not compete with
traditional signal processing techniques, although these can
be incorporated where appropriate during the matching phase.
The platform utilises cloud computing in order to provide a
scalable seizure detection service. The processing of EEG can
be computationally expensive, availing of cloud infrastructure
allows us to employ more resources when necessary. The plat-
form is based on two components, BabyLink and ScrutiniseIT,
each of which is described in detail below. An overview of the
complete platform is depicted in Figure 1.
A. BabyLink

web-based remote monitoring system that allows physiological
data streams to be viewed in near-real-time, while acquisition

is ongoing, via a web interface. This forms the core of the
BabyLink part of the platform. Users are presented with a
continuously updating view of the entire data stream, allowing
them to view new data as they arrive or review data transferred
earlier. The view presented closely resembles that found in the
NICU and offers a similar interface to that seen in a traditional
EEG monitoring machine. The only tool required for viewing
EEG data using BabyLink is a modern web browser with the
commonly available Adobe Flash plugin installed.
BabyLink’s remote monitoring functionality was further
extended, as described in [7], through the introduction of
a facility to annotate data whilst reviewing it. Three top-
level annotations were made available; events, comments and
waveform classiﬁcations. Events indicate occurrences at the
acquisition location. Comments are general, free-form text
markup of the signal data. Waveform classiﬁcations represent
a categorisation of a recording segment by a human analyst.
BabyLink also incorporates an agent framework, as de-
scribed in [8]. This enhances the remote monitoring system by
allowing a user-conﬁgurable set of agents to perform analysis
on physiological signals as they are streamed through the
system. The output of the agents assist with the analysts’ inter-
pretation of the data being streamed through the provision of
alternate visualisations and automatically created annotations.
BabyLink is the gateway from the hospital to the platform.
Enabling a clinician to analyse a patients data stream, toggle
on or off continuous monitoring, or annotate a segment as a
feature of interest. The agent framework enables the contin-
uous acquisition of EEG and transmission of the data in real
time, ensuring the that the platform is capable of “scrutinising”
it as described in the next section.
B. ScrutiniseIT
ScrutiniseIT uses a scan-and-scrutinise approach to seizure
detection, in which a candidate EEG is compared to a set
of known seizures that have been obtained previously. The
EEG data stream is treated as a series of epochs. Each epoch

is examined for potential matches to the database of known
seizures. Once a pre-determined threshold has been reached
the potential for a match is noted, processing of that epoch
ceases, and the process continues by advancing to the next
epoch. The size of the epoch is deﬁned by the Window Size
(WS) parameter described below. A match occurs when a
series of points observed match a similar series in the database.
ScrutiniseIT integrates with BabyLink via the agent frame-
work described in Section III-A. Through the tuning of differ-
ent parameters, the algorithm can either accelerate its search
through the EEG (scanning), or perform slower, more detailed,
analysis (scrutinising). These parameters are:
• Conﬁdence: a percentage value indicating a minimum
threshold that must be exceeded before a match with a
feature of interest is recognised. The higher the conﬁ-
dence speciﬁed, the more exacting the match must be
before the feature is reported.
• Window Size (WS): ScrutiniseIT uses a dynamic slid-
ing window to contextually analyse a candidate signal
pattern. Larger windows are used during the scan phase
when trying to identify regions of interest in the candidate
signal. When such a region is identiﬁed, the window
size contracts appropriately to scrutinise these regions in
more detail in an attempt to report features for a given
conﬁdence.
• Grain Size (GS): ScrutiniseIT operates by matching
turning points in the incoming EEG with similar points in
the database of known seizures. The grain size speciﬁes
the number of points required for a match to occur and
is used to determine when an advance to the next epoch
is triggered. The larger the grain size the greater the
accuracy of the resulting matches.
• Threshold Deltas δt, δp : Matches are compared on each
point at time +/- δt, and with accuracy +/- δp.

dotted line shows a sample signal from the database. Each
turning point in the signal has a known amplitude which
represents a point of interest. The window size being examined
is encapsulated by the dashed rectangle. For each point of
interest, the boundaries deﬁned by the δt and δp points are
shown as a shaded rectangle. The candidate signal is compared
against the database of known signals. Although, in this case,
the candidate signal exhibits a slightly different form; within
the given window there are 11 matches out of 13 possible
turning points exhibiting a conﬁdence rating in the order of
84%. If a conﬁdence rating less than 84% had been speciﬁed
a match would have being reported, if greater than 84% no
match would have occurred.
There is a trade-off between the time taken to process the
signal and the search parameters such as window size (WS)
and grain size (GS). The data shown in Table I illustrates this,
the larger the window size the faster the algorithm executes
but the less accurate the match with the points stored in the
database, similarly the smaller the grain size, the faster the
algorithm executes but the less accurate the match.
Therefore, our initial results show that a larger grain size
will yield more accurate matches but at a cost of slower
execution time. During our preliminary tests we have observed
that for signals containing no known seizures, the number of
matches is tiny.

IV. EVALUATION
Initial tests of ScrutiniseIT have been conducted with a
limited database of known seizures. An excerpt of the results
from these tests are listed in Table I and depicted in Figure
4. In Figure 4(A) total execution speedup obtained versus
selected window size is shown. Three sets of results are shown
for different grain sizes. It can be seen that signiﬁcant speedup
can be achieved by selecting a smaller grain size, albeit at the
cost of a reduction in the quality of matches. For the tests
illustrated in this example, a conﬁdence value of 70% was
chosen.
Figure 4(B) illustrates that, as window size is increased, the
total execution time is reduced. This is due to the reduced num-
ber of epochs that are available for selection. If a signiﬁcant
number of contiguous matches are found, the platform begins
the scanning process at the next epoch. So, larger window
sizes result in faster, less accurate, searches.
Although the results presented here are preliminary, they
are encouraging. To further development, the platform will be
evaluated in collaboration with the Neonatal Brain Research
Group (NBRG, based in Cork University Maternity Hospital,
Cork, Ireland) who have extensive expertise in neonatal EEG
and have assembled a data repository consisting of over 800
hours of multi channel EEG containing more than a thousand
seizures as well as a validation set comprising 70 neonates (35
seizure/35 non seizure). The main focus of the evaluation will
be on the performance of the scan-and-scrutinise algorithm.
V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
The scan-and-scrutinise approach to seizure detection in
neonatal EEG is novel in that:
• Incoming EEG data is compared with a database of
known seizures, this is in contrast to more typical ap-
proaches that apply generalised formulae.
• The provision of the system as a web service will allow
it to evolve over time.
While this is a work in progress, further investigations
into the effectiveness of the platform are ongoing, particularly
in identifying optimal conﬁgurations that balance speed with
accuracy.
