Abstract—Methylene blue (MB) and its derivatives have ap-
plications as photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy. How-
ever, little is known about their interactions with phospholipid
membranes at the molecular level. We employed molecular
dynamics simulations to model the binding between MB and a
dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayer. This was done
in the presence of molecular oxygen within the membrane. The
abitily of MB to induce photodamage was inferred based on its
immersion depth and degree of exposition to a higher oxygen
concentration inside the membrane. In addition, the effect of the
presence of ions in the solvent was explicitly considered.

INTRODUCTION
Photosensitization is the basis of photodynamic therapy
(PDT), a technique that has been used to treat various solid tu-
mors in the skin, breast, lung, bladder, and esophagus [1]. The
method relies on the administration of a sensitizer molecule
that is able to induce the formation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS), for example, singlet oxygen (1O2), when exposed
to light of the appropriate wavelength [2]. ROS-mediated
reactions in the cell membrane eventually lead to severe tissue
damage since these species can act as powerful oxidizing
agents, able to induce irreversible photodamage, necrosis or
apoptosis, in tumor tissues [1].
The study of biological membranes involves the under-
standing of the inﬂuence of many different organelles and
proteins. Model membranes, such as phospholipid bilayers,
are often used in PDT studies. In particular, DPPC is the most
abundant phospholipid in lung surfactant, primarily responsible
for the reduction of surface tension to near 0 mN/m during
expiration [3]. DPPC is zwitteronic having a negative charge
on the phosphate group and a positive charge on the amine.
Methylene blue is a phenothiazinium dye with the follow-
ing properties: strong absorbance in the range of 550–700 nm,
signiﬁcant quantum yield (φ∆ = 0.52) [2], triplet with long
intrinsic lifetime, low ﬂuorescence quantum yield and lifetime,
and low reduction potential [4]. Because of these characteris-
tics, it has been used in a variety of photochemical applications
including solar energy conversion [4] and PDT [5].
Localization of the sensitizer is a key issue in the un-
derstanding and determination of the PDT efﬁciency [1]. To
facilitate drug development, it is often necessary to identify a
target. A systematic study of structure-activity relationships

can then aid in improving the therapeutic procedure. Our
aim in this work was to explore the interaction between a
model membrane (DPPC) and a photosensitizer (MB). In
addition, the effect of the presence of ions in the solvent was
investigated, since they might play a crucial role in determining
the structural and electrostatic properties of model bilayers [6].
This allowed us to access the role of solvent ions in the
interaction of MB with DPPC.
This manuscript is organized as follows. In Section II, we
brieﬂy describe our theoretical approach. In Section III, our
results for the interaction of MB and model DPPC membrane
are discussed and compared to other works whenever posssi-
ble. Finally, a summary is presented in Section IV.

THEORETICAL MODELING
Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using
the GROMACS 4.5.1 simulation package [7][8]. Molecular
motions were computed by numerical integration of Newton’s
equations with a time step of 2 fs. Fully hydrated lipid
bilayers made of DPPC were represented using the force ﬁeld
developed by Kukol [9]. The interaction parameters were based
on the GROMOS53A6 force ﬁeld [10], in which aliphatic
carbon atoms and their adjacent hydrogens are treated as united
atoms. Figure 1 shows the structure of methylene blue (MB)
and DPPC indicating relevant atoms (N, N’, N”, and P) and
regions (A). To simulate fully hydrated lipid bilayers, the SPC
model [11] was used for water. A single oxygen molecule was
added to the aqueous phase. The oxygen molecule dissolved

in the membrane was described with parameters taken from
the literature [12]. For compatibility, the methylene blue was
assembled using the standard functional groups in the GRO-
MOS53A6 force ﬁeld [10]. The MB partial charges were taken
from the density functional calculations performed using the
Gaussian package [13].
Starting conﬁgurations for molecular dynamics were ob-
tained from a pre-equilibrated membrane patch with 128 lipid
molecules. Methylene blue was initially placed at the aqueous
phase at a distance of ca. 3 nm from the bilayer surface. Only
one MB molecule was added. A Cl− ion was added to neu-
tralize the system. In order to simulate systems at polar ionic
strength, 27 Na+ and 27 Cl− ions are added to the aqueous
phase. Overall, each simulated system had lateral dimensions
of ca. 6.2 nm parallel to the membrane surface (xy-plane)
and ca. 8.5 nm along the bilayer normal (z-axis). Periodic
boundary conditions were applied in all Cartesian directions.
The simulation protocol started with an equilibration run for
5.5 ns, during which the position of MB was kept restrained.
The molecule was then released and molecular trajectories
were recorded for 300 ns under controlled temperature (310 K)
and pressure (1 atm).
The drug-membrane binding process was followed in time
by recording both the position and the orientation of the
different photosensitizers with respect to the bilayer. Den-
sity distributions of the membrane building blocks and the
photosensitizer were calculated along the z axis. The degree
of overlap between the distributions of photosensitizers and
molecular oxygen was taken as an indicator of the expected
1O2 generation efﬁciency. Further details of our theoretical
modeling can be found in [14].

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In the ﬁrst step of our study, we have investigated the
inﬂuence of ions in the MB-membrane binding process. Fig-
ure 2 shows the temporal evolution of the MB-membrane
binding process. The immersion depth is deﬁned as the dis-
tance between the center of mass of the photosensitizer and
the water/bilayer interface. The top half of the lipid bilayer
is also represented in the background. In both cases, MB
started at the aqueous phase and reached the membrane surface
within the ﬁrst 2 or 3 ns, driven by favorable drug-membrane
electrostatic interactions. As clearly seen in Figure 2, MB
reaches a largest immersion depth, ∼0.5 to 0.8 nm, when ions
were not considered, compared to ∼0.2 nm in the case they
were included.

Upper panel: temporal evolution of the positions of the nitrogen
atoms with respect to the bilayer/water interface, when ions are not considered.
Lower panel: temporal evolution of the angle, θ, between the nitrogen atoms
vector with respect to the membrane-water interface.
In order to access the orientation of MB when immersed
on the DPPC bilayer, we analyze the relative positions of the
the nitrogen atoms, indicated by N in Figure 1. In the upper
panel of Figure 3 the temporal evolution of the positions of
the nitrogen atoms with respect to the bilayer/water interface
(when ions are not considered) is presented. These relative
positions allowed us to extract the angle, θ, of the nitrogen
atoms vector with respect to the membrane-water interface.
The temporal evolution θ is shown in the lower panel of
Figure 3. MB immersion occurs with the molecule forming an
average angle close to 40◦ with the membrane-water interface,
although a large ﬂuctuation is observed. A similar average
angle, ∼35◦, is observed when ions are added to the water
solution, as shown in Figure 4. However, in this case θ’s
ﬂuctuation is much smaller. Together, Figures 2, 3, and 4
clearly show that, in the absence of ions, MB presents a higher
mobility.
Next, we analyze the density proﬁles of different atoms or
functional groups of MB and DDPC and the oxygen molecule,
as shown in Figure 5, when ions are considered, and Figure 6,
when ions are not taken into consideration. These density
proﬁles give the spatial probability to ﬁnd different molecules
or functional groups along the bilayer normal. The density
proﬁles for the phosphatidylcholine atoms N” and P and the
functional group A are represented by dashed lines. In the
insets, the black dashed lines represent the DPPC membranes
in both cases.
For both systems, the nitrogen atoms of the AM molecule
(N–NMB) present a bimodal distribution (violet solid lines).
The membrane surfaces were heuristically deﬁned at the peaks
of the phosphate group distribution, since the water density
dropped from its bulk value to zero within the region occupied
by this group. It is clear from Figure 5 that, in the presence of
ions, the methylene blue molecule immersion is in such a way
that the one of the symmetric nitrogen atom is in the region

of the phospholipid head group, indicated by P. When ions
are not included, as depicted in Figure 6, the MB molecule
immersion is such that the nitrogen atom is closer to the A
region, around the region where C=O bonds can be found.
The density proﬁles in Figures 5 and 6 predict an increased
oxygen concentration in the membrane interior as compared
with the aqueous phase. Figure 7 shows how MB and the
oxygen molecules are distributed along the bilayer normal
when ions are present in the solvent (right) or not (left). The
probability of electron/energy transfer via type I mechanism
can be estimated, in a simple but effective way [14], in terms
of the integral overlap between the density proﬁles of MB
(ρMB) and of molecular oxygen (ρO2) along the z axis. This
probability can be obtained as
PO2/MB ∝
Z
dzρMB(z)• ρO2(z)

where the integral runs over the entire system length along
the z axis. A direct correlation can not be assumed between
photodynamic efﬁciency and the probability of ROS generation
since the membrane binding might be inﬂuenced by the
presence of ions in the solvent. The integral overlap O2/MB is
indicated in the inset of Figure 7. Since the calculated values
for both cases are very close, we believe that the relative
photodynamic efﬁciency is probably deﬁned by differences in
membrane binding.
In Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), an excited photosensi-
tizer can undergo type I (electron transfer) and/or type II
(energy transfer) reactions to produce highly reactive oxy-
gen species (ROS), resulting in necrosis and/or apoptosis
of exposed cells [1]. Type I reactions generate radical and
radical anion species (e.g., O−
2 , HO−), while type II reactions
produce singlet oxygen (1O2) by energy transfer between a
photosensitizer in its excited state and an oxygen molecule.

In this later case, membrane damage results from the ten-
dency of 1O2 to add to hydrocarbon double bonds, forming
hydroperoxides. Since DPPC is a saturated lipid, the formation
of hydroperoxides via a Type I mechanism is not possible.
However, it is already well stablished [15] that eukaryotic cell
membranes contain mixtures of glycerolipids (in mammalina
cells, all phospholipids except sphingomyelin), sphyngolipids,
and sterols. As a consequence, DPPC can be found in cell
membranes with different unsaturated lipids. Photodynamic
damage is believed to occur in the close vicinity of the
sensitizer because teh main cytotoxic product, singlet oxygen,
has a short life time. Therefore, it is fair to say that when MB
is incorporated in a DPPC domain, the photodamage in vicinal
unsaturated lipids might occur. Following this argument, it is
possible to infer that the photodamage might occur in the
head group region, when ions are included, or close to the
hydrophobic region, when ions are not considered.
By unveiling the interaction of DPPC with AM at a
molecular level, we are contributing for a better knowledge
of structure-activity relationships of such systems. We believe
that this will help in improving the the use of AM as a PDT
agent.

CONCLUSIONS
In this work, molecular dynamics simulations were em-
ployed to examine the interactions between MB and DPPC
bilayer at a molecular level when ions are present in the solvent
or not. We found that the immersion depth of MB is higher in
the absence of ions, but the molecule orientation is the same
in both cases: MB is slightly tilted. Our data also suggests that
MB mobility is also higher when ions are not present. With
ions in the solvent, the methylene blue molecule immersion
is in such a way that it is placed between the phospholipid
head group and the C=O bond region. When ions are not
considered, the MB molecule immersion is higher in such way
that electron/energy transfer mechanisms might also take place
in the hydrophobic region of the DPPC bilayer. In addition, the
probability of energy/electron transfer is estimated and found
to be very similar whith or without the presence of ions.
