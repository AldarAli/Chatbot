(OFDM) suffers from a high Peak-to-Average Power Ratio
(PAPR). Tone Reservation (TR) is a popular PAPR reduction
technique that uses a set of reserved subcarriers to carry the
peak reducing signal. The major advantages of TR technique
include no transmission performance degradation, no trans-
mission of Side Information (SI) and downward compatibility.
Because of all these beneﬁts, TR seems to be promising for use
in commercial standards such as Digital Video Broadcasting-
Terrestrial (DVB-T2). Thanks to a frequency domain ﬁltering
, in this paper, which is an extension of [1], we propose
Classical Transformation (CT) and Adaptive Transformation
(AT) algorithms to transform Adding Signal techniques (like
clipping techniques) to TR techniques in order to beneﬁt of
the TR advantages. As the transformation is a low-complexity
process (about the FFT/IFFT complexity), the obtained tech-
nique results in a low-complexity TR technique. However,
the transformation generates a loss of performance in PAPR
reduction, which can be improved by iterating the process of
transformation. Later in the paper, several Adding Signal tech-
niques (as well-known clipping techniques) are transformed
to TR techniques. Performance comparisons are done based
on Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF),
Bit Error Rate (BER) and Power Spectral Density (PSD)
metrics. The simulation results showed that, at the same PAPR
reduction gain, CT algorithm is 2 times more complex than
AT algorithm.

I. INTRODUCTION
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM),
although used in standards such as IEEE 802.11a/g, IEEE
802.16, HIPERLAN/2 and Digital Video Broadcasting
(DVB) [2], suffers from high Peak-to-Average Power Ratio
(PAPR). Large PAPR requires a linear High Power Ampliﬁer
(HPA), which is inefﬁcient. Moreover, the combination of an
insufﬁciently linear HPA range and large PAPR leads to in-
band and out-of-band distortion [3]. Several PAPR reduction
techniques have been proposed [4–7]. The simplest way to
reduce PAPR is to deliberately clip and ﬁlter the OFDM
signal before ampliﬁcation. However, clipping is a nonlinear
process and may cause signiﬁcant distortion that degrades
the Bit Error Rate (BER) and increase adjacent out-of-band
carriers [8].
Some techniques use coding, in which a data sequence
is embedded in a larger sequence and only a subset of all
the possible sequences is used to exclude patterns with high
PAPR [9]. These techniques require receiver modiﬁcations
to decode the received signal. Also, multiple signal rep-
resentation techniques have been proposed. These include
Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS) technique [10], Selected
Mapping technique (SLM) [11] and interleaving technique
[12]. Theses methods reduce the PAPR by controlling the
phase of the data subcarriers, which provides an effective
solution. However, they are computationally expensive due
to multiple IFFTs and exhaustive search to ﬁnd optimal
phase sequences; also they require transmitting continuous
SI to the receiver, which degrades the capacity of the system.
The overall BER performance may also be degraded if there
are errors in the SI [5].
PAPR can be reduced by the Adding Signal techniques
[13], which are very simple techniques to implement and
have become very attractive. Tone Reservation (TR) [14],
which is a particular Adding Signal technique is a popular
PAPR reduction technique that uses a set of reserved subcar-
riers to design a peak reducing signal. TR technique does not
distort data-bearing subcarriers. Also, it not only eliminates
the need for SI, but also prevents the BER degradation,
as occurs with other techniques. However, TR technique
requires an efﬁcient generation of the peak-reducing signal.
The optimal peak-reducing signal generation is obtained
by solving a Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program
(QCQP), which is a type of convex optimization problem
[14]. Although the optimum of a QCQP exists, it is shown
in [14] that the solution requires a high computational cost
of O

In [1], we proposed a tranformation algorithm to trans-
form Classical clipping in TR clipping. This paper is an
extension of [1], in which we propose two transformation
algorithms the classical algorithm (algorithm from [1]) and
an adaptative algorithm. Moreover, we apply these two
transformations on several Adding Signal techniques like
Geometrical method [17] and several types of clipping [18].
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
Section II introduces the OFDM systems. Section III brieﬂy
reviews the Adding Signal techniques principle, gives some
examples of these techniques and focuses on the TR tech-
niques, which are speciﬁc Adding Signal techniques. Section
IV describes the principle of the digital ﬁlter based on
FFT/IFFT pair and derives the CT and AT algorithms. In
Section V CT and AT algorithms are applied for PAPR re-
duction in a Wireless Local-Area-Network (WLAN) system,
to two Adding Signal techniques and simulation results are
provided, while in Section VI a conclusion is drawn.
II. OFDM SYSTEMS AND PAPR ISSUE
The basic idea underlying OFDM systems is the division
of the available frequency spectrum into several subcarriers.
To obtain a high spectral efﬁciency, the frequency responses
of the subcarriers are overlapping and orthogonal, hence
the name OFDM. This orthogonality can be completely
maintained with a small price in a loss in SNR, even though
the signal passes through a time dispersive fading channel,
by introducing a cyclic preﬁx (CP).

In practice, OFDM signals are typically generated by
using an Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) as

In this paper, the discrete-time indexing [n] denotes

practical designs, we will introduce the notation x [n/L] to
denote oversampling by L. Several different oversampling
strategies of x [n/L] can be deﬁned. From now on, the
oversampled IDFT output will refer to oversample of (2),
which is expressed as follows:

Thus, X(L) is extended from X by using the so-called
zero-padding scheme, i.e., by inserting (L − 1) N zeros in
the middle of X, i.e.,
X(L)

k ∈ S1

,
where S1 and S2 are the set of in-band (IB) indices and
out-of-band (OOB) indices respectively.
The cost of transceiver components depends on the dy-
namic range of the signals. In the literature, the envelope
variations are often described in terms of the crest-factor
(CF), peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR) or sim-
ply peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). In this paper, we
adopt the terms PAPR to quantify the envelope excursions
of the signal. The PAPR of the signal x (t) may be deﬁned
as
PAPR[x]

t∈[0,Ts] |x (t)|2
Px

(4)
where Px = E

|x (t)|2o
is the average signal power and
E {.} is the statistical expectation operator. Note that, in
order to avoid aliasing the out-of-band distortion into the
data bearing subcarriers and in order to accurately describe
the PAPR, an oversampling factor L ≥ 4 is required.
In the literature, it is customary to use the Complementary
Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) of the PAPR as
a performance criterion. It is denoted as
CCDF[x] (ψ)

PAPR[x] ≥ ψ

If N is large enough, based on the central limit theorem,
the real and imaginary parts of OFDM x (t) have Gaussian
distribution and its envelope will follow a Rayleigh distri-
bution. This implies a large PAPR. In [19], it is shown that
the mean of the PAPR, which is a random variable, can be
approximated to

III. ADDING SIGNAL TECHNIQUES FOR PAPR
REDUCTION
There are several different techniques for PAPR reduction,
in this section, we present the Adding Signal techniques
principle and then we focus on the TR techniques, which
are speciﬁc Adding Signal techniques for PAPR reduction.
A. Adding Signal Techniques Principle
In Adding Signal context, the PAPR is reduced by adding
a signal called sometimes “peak reducing signal” or “peak
canceling signal”. Many well known PAPR reduction tech-
niques of the literature such us Tone Reservation (TR)
[14], Tone Injection (TI) [14, 20], Geometric Approach for
PAPR reduction method [17] are known as Adding Signal
techniques. In [13], it is shown that any form of clipping can
be formulated as an Adding Signal technique. The Adding
Signal techniques consist of reducing the envelope of OFDM
signal by adding a peak-reducing signal just before the HPA
as shown in Fig. 2.

Figure 2: Adding Signal scheme for PAPR reduction.
Let xn,
n = 0, · · · , NL − 1
be the L-times oversam-
pled time-domain OFDM signal, where N is the number of
subcarriers. The PAPR reduced signal is therefore expressed
by
yn = xn + cn,
n = 0, · · · , NL − 1.
(6)
The peak reducing signal cn is computed according to
PAPR reduction techniques. In [15], cn is computed based
on an optimization algorithm (SOCP) in frequency domain,
while in [17], cn is computed in time domain based on
a Geometric approach. S. Janaaththanan et al. propose, in
[16], to compute cn in frequency domain with the Gradient
algorithm, which is a low-complexity algorithm. In [13],
the reducing signal cn is computed in time domain based
on a nonlinear function f (.) called “function for PAPR
reduction”. Using f (.) to reduce the PAPR of x [n/L], the
peak reducing signal cn is written as
cn = f (|xn|) ejϕn − xn,
(7)
where ϕn is the xn phase.
B. Some Examples of Adding Signal Techniques
As préviously mentioned, depending on the way to gener-
ate the Adding Signal cn, we obtain many different methods.
In this section, we present the clipping techniques family
[18], which could be easily seen as adding method and the
geometrical method of [17].
1) Clipping techniques family: In the ﬁrst subsection we
formulate the classical clipping as an Adding Signal tech-
nique as described in Fig. 2, then in the second subsection
we describe brieﬂy four clipping techniques.
clipping technique formulated as an Adding Signal
technique: Using the conventional clipping technique [8]
to reduce OFDM PAPR, the output signal yn, in terms of
the input signal xn is given as follows:
yn = f (|xn|) ejϕn,
where ϕn is the xn phase and f (.) is the clipping func-
tion. As f (.) is nonlinear function; according to Bussgang
theorem [21], the output signal yn can be written as
yn = αxn + dn,
where
α = Ryx (0)
Rxx (0).
(8)
Rxx (τ) and Rxy (τ) are autocorrelation and cross-
correlation functions of the input signal and output signal.
It is shown that the distortion term dn is uncorrelated with
the input signal xn, i.e., Rxd (τ) = 0.
From (6) and (8), the peak-reducing signal cn is expressed
as
cn = (α − 1) xn + dn.
(9)
We see from (9) that, the peak-reducing signal depends on
the distortion term resulting in the nonlinear process of the
OFDM envelope.
several clipping techniques: It is obvious that in
Eq. 9, the nonlinear clipping function is included in the
α parameter. In this paragraph, we give some possible
nonlinear function therefore some clipping techniques.
1) Classical Clipping (CC) technique
The Classical Clipping (CC) proposed in [8] is one of
the most popular clipping technique for PAPR reduc-
tion known in the literature [8, 22]. It is sometimes

called hard clipping or soft clipping, to avoid any
confusion, it is called Classical Clipping (CC) in this
paper. In [8], its effects on the performance of OFDM,
including the power spectral density, the PAPR and
BER are evaluated. The function-based clipping used
for CC technique is deﬁned below and depicted in Fig.
5 (a).
f (r) =
 r,
r ≤ A

r > A .
(10)
Where A is the clipping threshold. We derive now, a
bound for the α parameter depending on the clipping
threshold. This derivation, could be performed for
every type of clipping function, but we restrict here
it to the classical clipping function Let us consider
the coefﬁcient α deﬁned in (8).

where f (r) is the clipping function, Px is the OFDM

the statistical expectation operator. It can be shown
that, for a large number of subcarriers, the OFDM
envelope converges to Rayleigh envelope distribution.
Therefore,

Now, let us consider the clipping threshold A sufﬁ-

wise any peak will be reduced, i.e.,
A

5 dB. In this context, (9) becomes,
cn = (α − 1) xn + dn

(14)
From (14), it can be concluded that, for
A
√Px ap-
proaches 5 dB, the peak-reducing signal is approx-
imately equal to the distortion term resulting in the
clipping of the OFDM envelope.
2) Heavyside Clipping (HC) technique: Often called hard
clipping, HC is used in [23] as a baseband nonlin-
ear transformation technique to improve the overall
communication system performance. The heavyside
function is expressed below and depicted in Fig. 5
(b).
f (r) = A,
∀r ≥ 0 .
The HC technique is a case of school, it is widely
used in theory but very rarely in practice. In [18] it is
demonstrated, that HC has the worse performances of
these four clipping techniques.
3) Deep Clipping (DC) technique

Deep Clipping has been proposed in [24] to solve
the peaks regrowth problem due to the out-of-band
ﬁltering of the classical clipping and ﬁltering method.
So, in DC technique, the clipping function is modiﬁed
in order to “deeply” clip the high amplitude peaks.
A parameter called clipping depth factor has been
introduced in order to control the depth of the clipping.
The function-based clipping used for DC technique is
deﬁned below and depicted in Fig. 5 (c).

where β is called the clipping depth factor.
4) Smooth Clipping (SC) technique
In [25], a Smooth Clipping technique is used to
reduce the OFDM PAPR. In this paper, the function
based-clipping for SC technique is deﬁned below and
depicted in Fig. 5 (d).

These four clipping functions are drawn on Fig. 5 and
have been completely studied and compared in [18]. In the
litterature it exists other clipping function, among them we
may cite the ‘invertible clipping’ of [26]. All these clipping
techniques could be formulated as Adding Signal technique
(as previously done in Section III-B1 and therefore could
be transformed in TR techniques (see following sections).

C. Geometric Method for PAPR Reduction
The Geometric Method (GM) is an Adding Signal tech-
nique that was proposed for the ﬁrst time in [17]. The GM
technique is a backward-compatible technique, which means
it does not require any additional information at the reception
and the receiver should not be changed.

Figure 6: Principle of GM technique for OFDM PAPR

The principle of the technique is to ﬁrst generate an “artiﬁ-
cial signal” a (t), which is then modulated into intermediate
frequency ∆f for give rise to an “adding signal” c (t), which
is in principle outside the useful band of the OFDM signal
x (t). The reduced signal y (t) = x (t) + c (t) is modulated
into RF frequency and then ampliﬁed. Immediately after
ampliﬁcation, the adding signal is removed by a bandpass
analog ﬁltering placed in the transmitter side. Fig. 6 shows
the diagram of GM technique.
In [17], the “adding signal” c (t) is determined using a
geometric approach. It is expressed by the below equation
c (t) =

|x (t)| ≤ A

|x (t)| > A
The mechanism of GM technique for PAPR reduction is
described in Fig. 7.
D. Distortion Reduction in Adding Signal Techniques
Some of Adding Signal techniques can create the peak
reducing signal without any in-band and out-of band dis-
tortion; this is the case of TR technique; we will go back
to the details of this technique. However, when the peak
reducing signal is generated based on nonlinear functions,
some distortion are also generated. The well-know Adding
Signal technique, in which some distortion are created is the
clipping [8].
In [27], it is shown that, the peak reducing signal cn
calculated based on nonlinear functions, can be decomposed
as follow
cn = c(IB)
n
+ c(OOB)
n
,
(15)
where, c(IB)
n
is the peak reducing signal component created
in the in-band of the OFDM signal, while c(OOB)
n
is the peak
reducing signal component created in the out-of-band of the
OFDM signal.

In [8], the out-of-band distortion is mitigated by suppress-
ing the out-of-band component c(OOB)
n
of the peak reducing
signal cn. This distortion mitigation is done by a digital
ﬁlter based on FFT/IFFT. But the in-band component c(IB)
n
is kept, reason why in clipping and ﬁltering technique of
[8], the BER of the system is degraded.
The process of the suppression of the out-of-band dis-
tortion in Adding Signal is shown in Fig. 8 in frequency
domain.

One drawback of out-of-band distortion suppression in
Adding Signal techniques is peak regrowth due to the
ﬁltering of the peak reduction signal. Indeed, the digital ﬁlter
based on FFT/IFFT truncates some of the information that
is used to reduce PAPR and create some peak regrowth.
Some peak regrowth reduction methods have been pro-
posed in the literature [22, 28]. A straightforward way of
peak regrowth reduction is the repeated of Adding Signal
and out-of-band distortion ﬁltering. This method is proposed
in [22] in the case of clipping and ﬁltering. In [28], a peak
regrowth reduction method based on the “deeply” clip the
high amplitude peaks of the signal.
E. Overview of TR Techniques
The TR technique [14–16] is an Adding Signal technique.
This technique has been studied mainly on the OFDM
signal, without speciﬁcation of a particular standard and
can be generalized to all types of multicarrier systems. TR
technique is a pioneering method, particularly since it was
the ﬁrst to be modeled as a convex optimization problem.
The precursor of this technique is J. Tellado [14].
The principal idea of TR technique is to reserve Nr sub-
carriers in the OFDM symbol on which will be added a
relevant information in order to change the time signal, so
as to reduce the dynamics of the signal envelope. In this
technique, the transmitter and receiver agree on the number
and the positions of subcarriers, which are reserved to carry
the corrective signal for decrease the PAPR.
It should be understood that at the beginning, TR tech-
nique is not backward compatible. Indeed when it was in-
troduced for the ﬁrst time by J. Tellado in [14], the positions
of so-called “reserved subcarriers” are not ﬁxed (known in
advance), it assumes that the receiver must be informed by
the transmitter on the positions dedicated subcarriers used
to bring the “signal PAPR reduction”.
In this paper, the TR technique will be implemented
using the “unused subcarriers” so-called “null subcarriers”
of the standards in order to make the technique backward
compatible. The schematic diagram of the method is given
in Fig. 9.

Let R = {i0, · · · , iNr−1} be the locations of the reserved
subcarriers and let Rc be the complement of R in S1 . In
TR technique, the constraint on cn is that C must satisfy
Ck ≡ 0 for k ∈ (Rc ∪ S2). On the other hand, X must
satisfy Xk ≡ 0 for k ∈ R. X and C are not allowed to be
nonzero on the same subcarriers, i.e.,
Xk + Ck =
 Xk,
k ∈ Rc
Ck,
k ∈ R
.
(17)
Because of R ∩ Rc = ∅, the BER of the system is not
degraded. Because of Ck = 0 for k ∈ S2, there is not out-
of-band radiation.
The only drawback of TR technique is the loss of troughput
due to the reserved carriers to carry out the “peak reducing
signal”( which is the case, for example, in the DVBT2
standard [2]). To minimize this loss, we propose to use
unused or nulls carriers of the standards as reserved carriers

IV. FROM ADDING SIGNAL TECHNIQUES FOR PAPR
REDUCTION TO TR TECHNIQUES
In this section, we ﬁrst describe the principle of the digital
ﬁlter based on FFT/IFFT pair, which is used for the transfor-
mation of Adding Signal techniques in TR techniques. Then
we derive the algorithms of classical and adaptive trans-
formation of Adding Signal techniques in TR techniques.
Finally, we evaluate their computational complexities.
Using the same principle of out-of band distortion sup-
pression based on FFT/IFFT digital ﬁltering, we have pro-
posed in [1] for the ﬁrst time the idea of the transformation
of PAPR reduction techniques into TR techniques based
on FFT/IFFT digital ﬁltering. In [1], the classical clipping
technique is transformed in TR technique for WLAN (IEEE
802.11 a/g) PAPR reduction. In this paper we propose
an improvement of the classical transformation algorithm
initially described in [1] by adaptively transform Adding
Signal techniques to TR techniques. The new algorithm will
be called adaptive transformation algorithm. Both algorithms
are very similar and are both based on FFT/IFFT digital
ﬁltering.
A. The Digital Filter Based on FFT/IFFT Principle
Let ˜cn, the signal at the output of the IFFT/FFT pair based
ﬁlter as shown in Fig. 10.
The FFT/IFFT pair-based ﬁlter consists of a FFT op-
eration followed by an IFFT operation. The forward FFT
transforms cn back to the frequency-domain. The discrete
frequency components of cn on the reserved subcarriers are

passed unchanged while the data subcarriers and the OOB
components are setted to zero, i.e,
˜Ck = H [Ck] =
 Ck,
k ∈ R
0,
k ∈ (Rc ∪ S2) .
(18)
The IFFT operation transforms ˜Ck, back to the time domain.
This results in the ﬁltered peak-reducing signal ˜cn at the
output of the ﬁlter-based FFT/IFFT.
The relation between the input and the output of the
FFT/IFFT pair-based ﬁlter is written as:
˜cn = F−1 (H [F (cn)]) ,
(19)
where F represents the FFT function, F−1 is the IFFT
function and H is the digital ﬁlter response in frequency
domain.
According to (18), only the components of cn on the re-
served subcarriers (R) are used for OFDM PAPR reduction;
that is why, the resulting PAPR reduction technique is a TR
technique.
The FFT/IFFT pair-based ﬁlter complexity as well de-
ﬁned, depends only on the complexity of utilizing the
FFT/IFFT pair and is approximated as O (NL log2 NL).
The principle of FFT/IFFT pair-based ﬁlter for transfor-
mation of Adding Signal techniques in TR techniques is
shown in Fig. 11.

In the same way as the out-of band distortion mitigation,
the digital ﬁlter based on FFT/IFFT remove a part of
the information, which is used for PAPR reduction and
create some peak regrowth. For both classical and adaptive
transformation algorithms, the repeated adding and ﬁltering
signal for PAPR reduction is used to reduce the peak
regrowth phenomena.
Now let go to the details of classical and adaptive trans-
formation algorithms.
B. Classical Transformation (CT) Algorithm
In this subsection, we describe the classical transformation
algorithm of Adding Signal techniques for PAPR reduction
to the TR techniques, which is based on the FFT/IFFT digital
ﬁlter.
In order to reduce as much as possible the PAPR, the
CT algorithm is based on an iterative algorithm, which the
principle is as follow:
• Set up the locations of the reserved subcarriers R and
the maximum iteration number Niter, and choose the
function for PAPR reduction f (.).
• Set up i = 0, where x(0)
n
= xn is the time-domain
OFDM signal.
• Compute the (i)-iteration PAPR reduction signal as:
˜c(i)
n = f∆
h
f

x(i)
n

− x(i)
n
i
,
(20)
where f∆ = F−1◦H◦F is the FFT/IFFT based digital
ﬁlter response in time domain.
• Compute the (i + 1)-iteration PAPR reduced signal as:
x(i+1)
n
= x(i)
n + ˜c(i)
n
(21)
It must bear in mind that, the system complexity grows
linearly with the number of iterations. The data processed
by this algorithm in this paper are L over-sampled OFDM
symbols. The complexity of computationnal of ˜c(i)
n for each
iteration is O (NL log2 NL) because f∆, which is the digital
ﬁlter response is based on a backword FFT followed by
a foreward IFFT. Assuming that Niter is the maximum
number of iterations, the CT-algorithm complexity can be
approximated to O (NiterNL log2 NL).
C. Adaptive Transformation (AT)-Algorithm
The AT-algorithm for the transformation of Adding Signal
techniques to TR techniques is based on the CT-algorithm. In
distinction of the CT-algorithm, the AT-algorithm scales the
PAPR reduction signal ˜c(i)
n by an optimal scaling factor β(i)
opt
in order to outperform the PAPR reduction performance.
Whereby the PAPR reduced signal for AT-algorithm, at
(i + 1)-iteration, is written as:
x(i+1)
n
= x(i)
n + β(i)
opt˜c(i)
n
(22)
The scaling factor β(i)
opt is the solution of the optimization
problem, which is formulated as
β(i)
opt = arg min
β
h
max
n
x(i)
n + β˜c(i)
n

.
(23)
An exact solution of Eq. (23) exists but leads to a high
computation complexity. An alternative solution to Eq. (23)
is a low computation complexity suboptimal solution. In
[29], it is shown that, a suboptimal solution of Eq. (23) is
given by minimizing the total power of the samples with
x(i)
n + ˜c(i)
n
 > A, where A is the magnitude threshold.
Solving Eq. (23) leads to

V. TRANSFORMATION OF ADDING SIGNAL TECHNIQUES
FOR PAPR REDUCTION TO TR TECHNIQUES IN A WLAN
SYSTEM CONTEXT
In this section, based on the above analysis, using the CT
and AT algorithms, we propose to transform the classical
clipping technique [8] and the Geometric PAPR reduction
technique [17] into TR techniques for PAPR reduction of the
Wireless Local-Area-Networks (WLAN) system based on
IEEE 802.11a/g standards. In the ﬁrst subsection we provide
the caracteristics of the IEEE 802.11a/g standards.Then
using the two CT and AT algoritms in the second subsection,
we give the obtained results .
A. The IEEE 802.11a/g standards based WLAN system
In WLAN IEEE 802.11a/g standard IFFT size (N) is
64. Out of these 64 subcarriers, 48 subcarriers are used
for data, while 4 subcarriers are used for pilots. The rest
12 subcarriers are unused (null) subcarriers located at the
positions R = {0, 27, · · · , 37} of the IFFT input.
The IEEE 802.11a/g Standard speciﬁcations are given in
[30] and the transmit spectral mask requirements is shown
in Fig. 12.

The distribution based on the CCDF is used to evaluate the
performance in terms of PAPR reduction of the system, the
BER metric is used to evaluate the transmission performance
of the system over an AWGN channel and the Power
Spectral Density (PSD) of signals will be evaluated.
We evaluate also the high signal ﬂuctuations of the PAPR
by determining the performance in terms of PAPR reduction
deﬁned as
∆PAPR = PAPR[y] − PAPR[x], [in dB]
where PAPR[y] is the required PAPR of the signal y (t) to
obtain a speciﬁc value of the CCDF, while PAPR[x] is the
required PAPR of the signal x (t) to obtain a speciﬁc value
of the CCDF. Another aspect of performance evaluated in
this paper is the average power variation denoted ∆E and
expressed as
∆E = 10 log10
Py
Px

, [in dB]
where Py is the average power of the signal y (t), while
Px is the average power of the signal x (t).
We also draw PSD of the signal in order to check if, after
the TR mitigation method, the PSD still respects the WLAN
mask of Fig. 12.
Fig. 13 shows the peak power reduction results of
Classical-TR-CC technique for different iterations. Simu-
lation results from Fig. 13 shows that the reduction in
PAPR increases with the iterations number. For example,
at 10−2 of the CCDF, the reduction in PAPR for Classical-
TR-CC technique is about 0.75 dB, 1.75 dB and 2.75 dB
for Niter = 1, 3 and 5 respectively.

The reduction PAPR performance of the Adaptive-TR-
CC technique for iterations number Niter = 1, 3 and 5 are
plotted in Fig. 14 based on the CCDF curve. This ﬁgure
provides the same conclusion as Fig. 13, i.e., the reduction
in PAPR increases with the iterations number.
From Figs. 13 and 14, it is shown that the performance
in PAPR reduction from CT algorithm as well from AT
algorithm increases with the number of total iterations Niter.
Simulation results also shows that, for a given Niter,
Adaptive-TR-CC technique is better than Classical-TR-CC
technique in terms of PAPR reduction and Adaptive-TR-CC
technique with Niter = 3 gives the same PAPR reduction
performance as Classical-TR-CC technique with Niter = 5.
It must bear in mind that, the system complexity grows
linearly with the number of iterations.

Figure 14: PAPR reduction performance for
Adaptive-TR-CC technique for different iterations.
AT algorithm provides signiﬁcant reduction in PAPR than
CT algorithm at the same number of iterations; and AT
algorithm with Niter = 3 provides the same PAPR reduction
performance as the CT algorithm with Niter = 5. This
means that at the same PAPR reduction gain, CT algorithm
is 5/3 ∼ 2 times more complex than AT algorithm.
Fig. 15 shows the PAPR reduction performance according
to A for different iterations. It shows that the reduction
in PAPR increases with the number Niter of iterations. It
also shows that, for a given Niter, the maximum in PAPR
reduction is achieved for
A
√Px ≃ 4 dB and drops to 0 dB
from
A
√Px ≥ 11 dB. The maximum PAPR reduction of
the Classical-TR-GM technique at the value of 10−2 of the
CCDF is 2 dB, 2.5 dB, 2.75 dB and 3 dB for Niter = 1, 3,
5 et 10 respectively.
The reduction in PAPR decreases when
A
√Px increases for
the simple reason that, when the “ threshold” A increases
(i.e when
A
√Px increases), there are fewer and fewer samples
of the multicarrier signal that satisfy the condition |xn| > A.
Therefore, there will be fewer and fewer PAPR reduction.
The study of variation in the average power in the
Classical-TR-GM technique (refer to Fig. 16) shows that
the average power of the transmitted signal increases with
the reduction of PAPR. It is clear that for Niter = 10 where
the PAPR reduction is most signiﬁcant, the increasing of the
average power is the most important.
Fig. 17 shows the transmission performance for Classical-
TR-CC and Adaptive-TR-CC techniques over an AWGN
channel. Fig. 18 is the BER performance for Classical-TR-
GM and Adaptive-TR-GM techniques,
These simulation results show that the BER performance
of the system using the different PAPR reduction techniques
matches with the conventional BER; this means that the BER
of the system is not degraded by the different techniques.

Indeed, the different techniques used for PAPR reduction are
TR techniques, as in TR techniques the data subcarriers and
the PAPR reduction subcarriers are orthogonal, so the BER
of the system is not corrupted.
Fig. 19 and Fig. 20 show the PSD of signals after inves-
tigating the PAPR-reduction algorithms. All the spectrums
respect the WLAN spectral speciﬁcations. However, the
level of spectrum under the PAPR reduction subcarriers with
AT algorithm is higher than the level of spectrum with CT
algorithm. Indeed at the same level of iteration, the power of
the PAPR reduction signal with AT algorithm is higher than
the PAPR reduction signal power with CT algorithm, that is
why the performance in PAPR reduction with AT algorithm
is better than whose with CT algorithm at the same number

Despite the high level of the PAPR reduction signal
spectrum resulting to AT algorithm, the WLAN spectral
speciﬁcations are respected.
VI. CONCLUSION
TR is a popular PAPR reduction technique that uses a set
of reserved subcarriers to carry the peak reducing signal.
Because of its many advantages, TR seems to be promising
for use in commercial systems.

In this paper, thanks to a Frequency Domain ﬁltering, we
have proposed two transformation algorithms to transform
any Adding Signal techniques into TR techniques in order
to beneﬁt of the TR advantages. As the transformation
in TR technique is a low-complexity process (about the
FFT/IFFT complexity), the obtained technique results in
a low-complexity TR technique. In order to increase the
performance in PAPR of the obtained TR technique, the
process of the peak reducing signal computation followed
by ﬁltering must be repeated several times.
Later in the paper, the classical clipping technique [8]
and the Geometric PAPR reduction technique [17] are trans-
formed into TR techniques for PAPR reduction. CT and
AT algorithms proposed in this paper are applied and the
performances of these two techniques are evaluated through

the BER, PAPR reduction, as well as DSP of resulting
signals, in the WLAN context.
From simulation results, it is shown that, AT algorithm
provides more reduction in PAPR than CT algorithm at the
same computational complexity; but leads to an increase
in the level of the PAPR reduction signal spectrum that
nevertheless respects the standard spectral speciﬁcations.
We can conclude that: to transform any Adding Signal
technique into TR technique, AT transformation algorithm
should be preferably used.
