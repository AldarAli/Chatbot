Abstract— It is always difficult to identify the most recent
works that have been published, especially those published in
recent years, due to delays in putting publications online,
citations indexe, etc. Scientometry offers to researchers various
concepts, models and techniques that can be applied to
knowledge
management
(KM)
in
order
to
explore
its
foundations, its state, its intellectual core, and its potential
future development. To this end, we have developed a
scientometric KM framework to calculate the scientometric
indexes related to a query introduced in the Scopus database,
to facilitate research and monitoring of productivity and
collaboration between the authors of KM in particular and
also the dissemination of knowledge. The works between 2014
and 2019 are taken, the industry of services was omitted. It
might help the decision makers and researchers to optimize
their time and efforts.
We used Unified Modeling Language
(UML) to translate the development ideas of the scientometric
framework structure into diagrams, and Delphi 7 to calculate
the indexes and ensure other operations of research (about:
articles, their authors, conferences, etc). This framework is
only valid for Excel files extracted from Scopus or similar
format. Finally, the relation between KM and industry 4.0 was
established on found articles in Scopus.
Keywords-Scientometric indexes; Knowledge management;
Industry; industry 4.0, Scopus; UML; Delphi.
I.
INTRODUCTION
KM is a concept having more attention in the last years;
it was applied to the industry field as a process of creating,
acquiring, transferring and using knowledge in order to
improve the companies’ performance. It is related to two
types of activities: a) activities by which one attempts to
document and appropriate individual knowledge within the
organization
and
b)
activities
that
facilitate
human
exchanges, in which uncodified knowledge is shared [1].
However, because of its novelty and for the reasons of delays
in posting, indexes of citations, it is always difficult to
identify the most recent and impacting published works. The
sociology of sciences has exploited certain possibilities that
mathematics and computer tools offer today to provide new
analytical tools (library analysis, method of co-citations,
method of associated words, etc.), around which a new
discipline has been formed: the scientometry [2]. This
discipline seeks to characterize science by the constitution of
the
objective
laws
of
its development
and
finds
its
practicalities on the one hand in the quality of the tools it
manipulates and on the other hand in the model of science on
which it relies. It is based on the use of mathematical tools,
and in particular on the statistical analysis of long series of
clues deemed objectives, gradually extends.
In this context, a scientometric framework for KM was
developed, able to calculate the scientometric indexes
relating to a query in the Scopus database, to facilitate
research and
follow-up, productivity and collaboration
between KM authors in particular, and the dissemination of
knowledge.
Section
2
gathers
some
scientometric
works.
The
followed methodology is presented in Section 3. Section 4
was devoted to realization and implementation of the
scientometric framework. In Section 5, the relation between
KM and Industry 4.0 is established and followed by a
conclusion.
II.
RELATED WORK
There are several precedent works related to KM. A
relative scientometric analysis of KM [3] was presented, as a
comparison between KM and Intellectual Capital (IC)
journals, by the implantation of scientometric indexes using
the programming language R. The results highlighted the
best journals in KM and IC. Aitouche et al. [4] found that IC
is an emerging field and scientific researchers are more
productive and have immediate impact in it than those of
KM field even though it is novelty. This comparison was
observed through a bibliometric analysis of the evolution of
KM and IC fields. Aitouche et al. [5] have done a keywords
analysis in KM and IC. They observed that KM and IC have
many common concepts such as management, performance,
model,
value.
The
keywords
analysis
allowed
the
identification of existing levels of meaning in scientific
articles as well as the unexpected trends in each area. This
work could be useful to prepare glossaries, ontologies and all
semantic researches. In industry, Caviggioli and Ughetto [6]
proposed a bibliometric analysis of the literature dealing with
the impact of additive manufacturing on industry. It has
gained momentum since 2012, in terms of the number of
articles, received citations and number of involved authors.
Empirical studies represent more than 50% of the sample,
but they have mostly employed a case study approach. The
result
suggests
that
future
empirical
research
could
contribute further with the analysis of larger datasets and
through the adoption of methods relying on surveys or action
research.
Gonçales Filho and Campos [7] analyzed the lean
manufacturing as a viable operations strategy; thereby
identifying
the
lean
production
strategy
adopted
by
companies in the various segments.

III. METHODOLOGY
In this section, we will present the used scientometric
indexes, UML for design of the framework and used data.
A.
Scientometric indexes
Table 1 describes the relative indexes used in this work;
each index has an interpretation according to its definition.
TABLE I. MOST USED INDEXES.
Indexes
Description and/or formula
I-index
Number of citations of articles published in year N/ number of
articles published in the journal in year N.
I10 index
Number of articles with at least 10 citations.
H index
Number of articles N, cited at least N times.
N index
It is calculated by dividing the H index by the number of years
since first publication.
G index
Is the rank g of the article accumulating at least g² of citations?
Π-index
The introduction of a new impact index (π-index) aimed to
privilege articles from highly influential journal, i.e. those that
obtained a relatively high number of citations in all the
analyzed articles.  Π-index = 0.01 C(Pπ) / C(Pπ); hundredth of
the number of citations.
Citescore
Citescore = Number of citations of a journal / Number of
articles in a journal
SCImago
Journal
Rank
(SJR)
SCImago Journal Rank measures weighted citations received
by the serial. Citation weighting depends on subject field and
prestige (SJR) of the citing serial.

(SNIP)
Source Normalized Impact per Paper measures actual citations
received relative to citations expected for the serial’s subject
field.
B.
Design with UML
«Unified Modeling Language» is a visual language
consisting of a set of diagrams, each diagram gives a
different vision of the project to be dealt with. Thereby,
StarUml is used to form the essential diagrams (use case
diagram and class diagram).
Figure 1. Class Diagram of scientometric framework.
In Fig. 1, we presented the class diagram. It contains 7
classes: author, who is the principal actor of research, then
the article containing the majority of information. This latter
is related to its keywords. The classes book, conference and
journal represent the container of article. We need the class
year to separate articles in time.
Figure 2. Uses cases of scientometric framework.
The

cases
diagram
(Fig.
2)
represents
the
functionalities of the proposed computing framework. It
contains calculation of numbers, displaying lists, number
articles
by
criterion,
number
citations
by
criterion,
scientometric indexes and updating used data. The details are
given in Section 4.
C.
Collected data
The collected data for this framework is a set of articles
concerning KM extracted, as an “excel” file, from Scopus
(Fig. 3). The search in Scopus is accomplished with a query
that
finding
articles,
witch
their
titles
contained
the
expression
(KM
AND
(industry
OR
industrial
OR
manufacturing OR factory OR production OR product OR
company OR firm OR enterprise OR organization)).
IV. REALIZATION AND INTERPRETATION
The framework offers several functionalities to calculate
some
scientometric
indexes
using
an
Excel
database
exported from Scopus containing the items of articles
requested.
A.
Calculation of numbers
This functionality (Fig. 3) allows calculating the number
of articles, authors, journals, chapters, laboratory, and
conferences. We found 198 articles, 542 authors, 9 chapters,
and 50 conferences in our integrated database. These
numbers reflect the huge practices of KM in industries.
Figure 3. Menu calculation of numbers.

B.
Lists
This functionality (Fig. 4) allows importing the lists of
authors, journals, chapters, laboratory, conferences, and
country. It imports the list of the indicated criterion.
Figure 4. Interface of lists.
The lists allow the researcher to have a primary idea on
who are the authors, what are the journals, conferences,
books and countries, laboratories, participating to the KM in
industry.
C.
Number of articles by criterion
In this functionality (Fig. 5), we search the number of
articles by criterion (author, journal, chapter, laboratory,
conference, country) or even further, the number of articles
for author, journal, chapter, laboratory, conference, country,
using names everyone needed.
Figure 5. Number articles by criterion.
For countries, as it is observed from Table 2, the most
producing countries are Germany, India, China, UK, Iran,
USA and Malaysia. The more productive authors in KM
applied to industry are Kifor C.V. with 4 articles, and, Tan
L.P., Wong K.Y. and Paszek A., with 3 articles.

Number of citations by criterion
As the previous functionality, our search would be by
criterion too for searching the number of citations (Fig. 6).
The criteria are the same used in Section C.
Figure 6. Number citations by criterion.
Table 4 represents an ascendant classification of articles
by number of citations. The most cited article is entitled
“The
effects
of
industry
cluster
KM
on
innovation
performance” with 71 citations. The second cited one is
entitled “KM and innovation in knowledge-based and high-
tech industrial markets: The role of openness and absorptive
capacity”. The precedent articles highlight the relation
between KM and innovation.
Table 5 shows the most cited authors: Lai Y.-L., Hsu M.-
S., Lin F.-J., Chen Y.-M., with 71 citations and Martín-de
Castro G. with 23 citations. They are the pioneers of KM in
industry, even if they are less productive than the authors
mentioned in section B. They are not really evaluated by
their productivity, but by their impact on the scientific
society.

Scientometric indexes
This is where we could calculate the scientometric
indexes (H-index, G-index, etc.). As it is exposed in Fig. 7,
there is a group of authors where the i-10 index equals to 1;
the highest value of H index is 2, and the highest value of G
index is 3.

Table 9 indicates that all authors have an i-10 equal to 1
or 0. This means that the best author has 1 article cited with
10 citations: this is true only for the selected data.
The author could have an i10 index superior to 1 but
using all his articles which are not present in our data.
The highest h index is 2. This means that these authors
have 2 articles cited with 2 citations.
The highest G index is 3. This means these authors are
the most cited, relatively; the exponential 2 of citations
represents an improved h-index.

Table 10 represents the Π-index of journals (138), 
conferences (50) and books (9). It means that the journals are
more cited and productive than conferences and books,
because Π-index is an index reflecting the productivity and 
the impact in the same time.

It can be justified by the nature of journal articles
containing more exhaustive insights, their experimentation
and interpretation of results.

Update the data
Modifying or changing the file of the database, updating
and integrating it, would be possible (Fig. 8). Data should
have the same Excel format of the Scopus Excel exportation.

One can use this data or another database and introduce
them in the Excel file, having the same items, and introduce
it to the framework to have results.

titles is used in Scopus to find 7 articles.
Table 11 shows that the number of articles on knowledge
management and Industry 4.0 has been increasing over time.
Germany is the most productive country. All authors have
one article.

“Logistics” and “supply chain” gathered appear 6 times;
we understand primarily that industry 4.0 and KM are
applied almost in logistics. “Technology” appears 7 times
and “advantage” appears 2 times. Keywords give insights on
trends of the researches on industry 4.0 and KM.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this work, we put to the researcher’s hands a
framework to facilitate finding what they are looking for,
related to KM in the field of industry; KM is considered as a
new discipline, so it is hard to find documentation related to
it. Scopus is the biggest database containing abstracts,
citations, conferences, books, subjects of research in various
sciences. The data contains articles talking about KM and
industry,
extracted
from
Scopus,
omitted
the
service
industries and were introduced to the framework. Moreover,
we chose Delphi to be the workspace of programming the
scientometric framework. The value of the framework
consists in the relative indexes calculated for a specific
request; they do not exist in research databases.
The type of the updating file has to be “Excel” or a
similar type, so, in this framework, we suggest that a
computer scientist concentrates on developing this point, or
even better searching for a way to integrate Scopus or other
important
database
directly
with
the
programming
application.
A scientometric analysis is applied manually on 7
articles, making the relation between KM and Industry 4.0.
The productivity and the impact of these researches is
increasing over time and domains.
An interesting future development could be updating
more than one database, and comparing them according to
the calculation of the scientometric indexes using the
framework. Furthermore, the databases could be related to
different sciences.
