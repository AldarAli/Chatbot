Abstract—Material Requirement Planning (MRP) is a broadly 
applied production planning method. One problem reported 
by practitioners and identified in research is that capacity 
constraints are not included in the planning algorithm. In this 
paper, the implementation of a simple capacity balancing 
function into the MRP run by allowing to temporarily relax the 
safety stock is investigated. Since such a safety stock relaxation 
method can be implemented in different ways, three specific 
implementations are developed and tested in a simulation 
study. For a simple production system structure with 
uncertainties in processing and customer demand, the 
performance improvement of the different safety stock 
relaxation methods is tested when a rolling horizon MRP 
planning is applied. A detailed analysis of planning parameter 
effects is presented and a broad set of scenarios provides 
further insights in the performance of the developed methods. 
In general, all three methods reveal a significant potential of 
improvement in comparison to MRP. Managerial insights are 
that too low production lot sizes and too low safety stocks 
should be avoided and the interaction between these two 
planning parameters cannot be neglected. Furthermore, very 
high and very low production system utilization reduce the 
improvement potential.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Material Requirement Planning (MRP) is widely applied 
for production planning due to its well comprehensible 
algorithm for scheduling production orders to satisfy 
material requirements. However, one problem in MRP 
application is that capacity constraints are ignored in the 
planning algorithm. In this paper, different methods for 
temporary safety stock relaxation within the MRP run to 
enable a capacity balancing are investigated. Note that this 
paper is an extension of [1] where preliminary results have 
been presented. Specifically, [1] is extended by a more 
thorough safety stock relaxation method presentation, a 
specific algorithmic explanation of its integration into MRP, 
a broad numerical study design and the specific formulation 
of managerial insights based on the numerical results. 
MRP is studied a lot in literature, see [2] for its basic 
development, [3] for a detailed discussion, and [4] for 
parameter optimization. Specifically the problem of 
neglecting the limited capacity has often been addressed in 
literature [5][6][7]. Literature shows that neglecting capacity 
constraints leads to the generation of usually infeasible 
production plans by MRP, which require additional planning 
effort at the production control level [8][9][10]. In the last 
decades, several approaches have been developed to deal 
with the drawbacks of MRP. Especially for the integration of 
capacity constraints, there exist a set of different solution 
approaches [11]. One possibility is to react on capacity 
problems after the MRP run [8][9][12], although it is hard to 
solve these problems, which are generated at the higher MRP 
level. Some authors start before the MRP run and try to 
avoid capacity violations already at the Master Production 
Schedule (MPS) level [13][14]. Another approach is the 
formulation of an optimization problem with capacity 
constraints instead of the MRP run [15][16], or the including 
of a solution heuristic into the MRP algorithm [11]. In 
addition to the high computational effort for solving real 
world planning problems, the theoretical formulations limit 
the practical application of these approaches. The integration 
of a solution heuristic into the well-known MRP algorithm 
for tackling the capacity constraints is another possibility, 
which is more likely to be accepted for practical 
implementations. Different approaches can be found in [11], 
[17], [18], [19], or [20]. 
In [19], capacity planning is integrated into MRP by 
providing simple algorithmic measures, like the temporary 
relaxation of safety stock, load dependent dynamic planned 
lead times and lot size adaption heuristics. The concept 
developed in [19] is Material and Capacity Requirements 
Planning (MCRP), however, only a conceptual framework 
is provided, but details on the implementations are missing. 
In [21] the concept of MCRP is further detailed and some 
first insights on the overall performance of the MCRP 
algorithm 
are 
presented. 
However, 
details 
on 
the 
performance of different safety stock relaxation methods are 
still to be investigated.  
The above introduced literature shows that the 
implementation of capacity limits into MRP is a relevant 
field of research. Practical requirements often imply that 
such solution heuristics should be easy to implement, to

enable a further real world implementation of the specific 
methods. Therefore, the implementation of simple safety 
stock relaxation methods into the MRP run for enabling 
capacity balancing already within the planning algorithm 
provide a significant contribution. In this paper, three safety 
stock relaxation methods for capacity load balancing are 
developed, based on the conceptual framework of [19]. 
Related to these methods, the following research questions 
are addressed: 
 
What is the performance improvement potential of 
the different safety stock relaxation methods in 
comparison to MRP? 
 
What is the influence of the planning parameters lot 
size and safety stock on the performance of the 
developed safety stock relaxation methods and how 
do these parameters interact? 
 
How 
do 
tardiness 
costs, 
production 
system 
utilization 
and 
setup 
effects 
influence 
the 
performance of the developed methods? 
 
What safety stock relaxation method has the highest 
improvement potential and can be applied for further 
research and in practical applications? 
 
To answer these research questions, Section II provides 
the algorithmic extension of MRP and a detailed 
explanation of the different safety stock relaxation methods. 
For evaluating the performance of these methods, a 
simulation study is performed. The respective production 
system setup and the evaluated scenarios are introduced in 
Section 
III. 
To 
identify 
the 
general 
performance 
improvement potential of safety stock relaxation in 
comparison to MRP, the numerical results of a basic 
scenario are presented in Section III as well. The detailed 
planning parameter influence is evaluated in Section IV, 
where again the basic scenario is focused. The influence of 
different tardiness costs, production system utilization and 
setup effects are then evaluated in Section V with a broad 
numerical simulation study. Furthermore, the different 
methods performance is compared in this section in detail. 
In Section VI, concluding remarks summarize the main 
results and outline future research. 
II. 
SAFETY STOCK RELAXATION 
A safety stock within MRP is applied to reduce the 
negative effects of uncertainties in customer demand and 
production processes. From a planning perspective, the 
safety stock is never undershot in the original MRP 
algorithm (see netting in MRP algorithm, [3] and [2]) and is 
only used for unplanned occurrences. In the approach 
introduced in [19], safety stock is already applied in the 
planning algorithm for capacity load balancing, i.e., available 
safety stocks are used to temporary reduce the capacity 
needed. This leads to a shift in capacity consumption since 
this safety stock has to be refilled in later periods, which 
leads to a higher capacity consumption there. The basic idea 
behind that measure is that capacity shortages are only 
temporary and, therefore, some idle capacity is available 
further in the future, i.e., capacity load is balanced. 
In Fig. 1 the MRP algorithm with the extension of the 
safety stock relaxation is presented. The MRP algorithm 
starts at Low Level Code 0 (LLC), which usually includes 
the sales parts, with the step netting for each material. The 
inputs are the gross requirements of LLC0 from customer 
orders or master production scheduling, the scheduled 
receipts from production orders currently processed, and the 
current inventory. After netting, the step lot sizing is applied, 
followed by the step capacitating.

Figure 1.  MRP Algorithm with Safety Stock Relaxation. 
The capacitating step is fundamental for applying the 
safety stock relaxation because capacity constraint violations 
are determined by comparing cumulated capacity available 
with cumulated capacity needed. For each period within the 
MRP run, the capacity needed is calculated based on 
scheduled receipts and planned order receipts applying the 
corresponding processing and setup times for all materials 
and all machines at the current LLC. The available capacity 
is given by the work schedule applied for each machine. 
Whenever the cumulated capacity needed is higher than the 
cumulated capacity available within one planning period, a 
safety stock relaxation is applied. Note that the steps 
capacitating and safety stock relaxation are not part of the 
traditional MRP run. After safety stock relaxation, the steps 
netting and lot sizing are again performed with the relaxed 
safety stocks. These lower safety stocks lead to lower net

requirements 
and, 
therefore, 
influence 
the 
resulting 
production lot sizes. The next steps are backward scheduling 
and bill of material (BOM) explosion. The steps backward 
scheduling and BOM explosion are also executed if no 
capacity problem has been detected. In the following 
subsections, the different methods for safety stock relaxation 
are introduced. 
Fig. 2 shows an example for the capacitating step, where 
a capacity problem is detected in period 5. Note that this 
calculation is applied for each machine within the production 
system. In this example the available capacity for each 
planning period, i.e., periods applied in the MRP run, is 
constant. This could be 8 hours capacity available for each 
day. The cumulated capacity needed includes all capacity 
demands from currently processed orders and new 
production lots resulting from the MRP step lot sizing. The 
capacity needed is scheduled at the planned end date of the 
order in this calculation. Whenever the cumulated capacity 
needed is higher than the cumulated capacity available a 
capacity problem occurs. In the example in Fig. 2, such a 
problem occurs in period 5. This capacity problem is the 
basis for the different safety stock relaxation methods 
discussed in the following subsections.

A. Safety Stock Relaxation Method 1 
In safety stock relaxation method 1, the safety stock for a 
specific material can only be reduced if there is a planned 
order receipt in the period of the capacity problem. Note that 
in the numerical study, the lot sizing rule FOP (Fixed Order 
Period) is applied, which summarizes net requirements of 
multiple periods, so there is not a planned order receipt for 
each material in every period. The safety stock is reduced to 
the level needed, so that the capacity problem is solved in the 
respective period; i.e., cumulated capacity needed after 
safety stock relaxation is equal or smaller than the cumulated 
capacity available. 
Fig. 2 showed a capacity problem in period 5 of c=1.7 
hours. If we assume that the processing time for a material, 
which has a planned order receipt in period 5 is p=2.55 
minutes at the respective machine, the safety stock would be 
relaxed by r=40 pcs, i.e., r=c/(p/60) (1.7 / (2.55/60)), for this 
material. Please note that the safety stock is relaxed for all 
periods of the current FOP lot size. To illustrate the specific 
safety stock relaxation methods, a numerical example is 
generated in which the capacity demand from Fig. 2 is 
generated by only two materials, which both apply the lot 
sizing policy FOP 3. Note that this assumption only applies 
for the simple illustrative example here but not for the 
numerical study presented later. The key results of the MRP 
run for this example are presented in Table I, where the 
period with the capacity problem is shaded in grey. Note that 
the net requirements include a current inventory and no 
projected inventory on hand is reported here to keep the 
example simple. The result in Table I shows that the safety 
stock relaxation leads to lower planned order receipts after 
relaxation, i.e., a lower production lot size for the respective 
lot and, therefore, lower cumulated capacity needed. The 
following production lot, i.e., the planned order receipts in 
period 8, include the net requirements and the amount 
needed to refill the safety stock.

To account for uncertainties, a minimum safety stock 
level can be considered as lower bound for the relaxation. 
For the application of the safety stock relaxation method, the 
materials 
are 
ordered 
according 
to 
their 
capacity 
consumption per piece at the respective machine. The 
method starts with the material, which has the highest 
capacity consumption per piece and is performed for further 
materials until the capacity problem is solved.  
B. Safety Stock Relaxation Method 2 
Safety stock relaxation method 2 extends the set of 
materials for which the safety stock relaxation can be 
applied. In method 1 the safety stock relaxation can only be 
performed, if there is a planned order receipt in the period of 
the capacity problem. In method 2, this restriction is 
removed. A safety stock relaxation can also be performed, if 
there is a planned order receipt that covers net requirements 
(due to lot sizing policy FOP) in the period of the capacity 
problem. This allows that the safety stock for planned order 
receipts with end dates before the period of the capacity 
problem can be relaxed. Table II shows the results for the 
safety stock relaxation of the second material, which leads to 
the capacity demand from Fig. 2. This material has the same 
processing time and a planned order receipt in period 4. 
Note that this example assumes that the safety stock of the 
material from Table I has not been relaxed. Again, the net 
requirements calculation is skipped for simplicity reasons.

The results in Table II show that in this case the safety 
stocks for periods 4 to 6 are relaxed and that the following 
production lot, i.e., the planned order receipts in period 7, 
include the net requirements and the amount needed to refill 
the safety stock. Note that this relaxation solves the capacity 
problem of this simple example since the lower capacity 
demand in period 4 reduces also the cumulative capacity 
needed in period 5. 
C. Safety Stock Relaxation Method 3 
Safety stock relaxation method 3 is an extension to 
method 2 and uses the same logic for the safety stock 
relaxation. However, in a rolling horizon planning, methods 
1 and 2 do not store the relaxed safety stock numbers for the 
next MRP run. In a pure deterministic setting this would lead 
to a situation where the safety stock relaxation decision has 
to be taken in each MRP run until the capacity problem has 
passed. In comparison to methods 1 and 2, the relaxed safety 
stock numbers are stored in method 3 for the MRP run 
performed in the next period. The next MRP run is 
calculated with the predefined relaxed safety stocks. Method 
3 has the effect that when a safety stock relaxation for a 
planned order receipt is made, it is never revised. The only 
exception is that the safety stock can be further relaxed to the 
minimum safety stock, if there is a new capacity problem. 
Note that in a stochastic setting where demands and shop 
floor behavior incur uncertainties, this method may lose 
some flexibility to react on short term influences. The MRP 
run from Table II, in which the safety stock was relaxed from 
period 4 to 6, is repeated one period later in Table III. Note 
that period 3 in Table III corresponds to period 4 in Table II, 
and the period with the capacity problem shifted to period 4.

The relaxed safety stock from the previous period is 
already stated in the safety stock before relaxation and if a 
further capacity problem occurs further safety stocks could 
be relaxed. 
To test the behavior of these three safety stock relaxation 
methods in stochastic environments with rolling horizon 
planning, a simulation study is performed. 
III. 
SIMULATION STUDY 
In this section the modeled production system for the 
simulation study and the different scenarios are described, 
followed by the planning parameters investigated. For a 
basic setting, the performance of the different safety stock 
relaxation methods is compared to standard MRP. The 
generic 
simulation 
framework 
SimGen 
based 
on 
AnyLogic©, also used in [22] and [23], is applied for the 
simulation study. This framework allows to implement 
production planning simulation models efficiently. For 
details, see also [24]. 
A. Production System 
The modeled production system structure applied in this 
paper is motivated by different automotive suppliers’ 
production systems and similar to the production system 
presented in [22]. However, it is a very streamlined version 
(low number of products, simple BOM structure, only one 
machine per low level code) to not disturb the simulation 
experiment results unnecessarily, which are generated later 
on. Fig. 3 shows the resources, bill of material and work 
schedule applied.  
The studied production system is a pure Make-to-Order 
(MTO) system. Eight final products (LLC0) are delivered to 
a set of different customers stating their orders with a 
random customer required lead time in advance of the 
respective due date. These final products consist of 1 piece 
of a semi-processed material on LLC1 and LLC2, whereby 
the raw materials on LLC3 are assumed to be always 
available. One machine is available for each processing step 
and the transformation from one low-level code to the next 
always includes one processing step. The lot sizing policy is 
FOP for all materials (see [3] for details).

B. Scenario Definition 
To evaluate the performance of the safety stock 
relaxation methods in comparison to MRP, three different 
utilization levels are evaluated. This is necessary in order to 
study the effectiveness of the proposed methods, since for 
low work load, in comparison to the available capacity, 
methods for capacity balancing are getting pointless. The 
utilization factors evaluated in this study are 90%, 95% and 
98%. The time that is spent for setup in comparison to the 
total capacity needed can also have an influence on the 
performance of the different safety stock relaxation methods. 
Therefore, two different percentages of setup activities (5% 
and 10%) and two different setup scenarios are investigated. 
In the standard setup scenario, called always setup, setup 
times occur for every order. In the second setup scenario, 
named setup at material change, setup times only occur if 
the next product produced is not the same as the previously 
produced. The different utilization scenarios are generated by 
varying customer demands. Starting with customer demands 
(log-normally distributed with a coefficient of variation of 
1), which result in a shop load of 100% without setup, the 
utilization scenario is generated by multiplying the monthly 
demand with the utilization factor minus a predefined 
percentage of setup activities (5% and 10%). The resulting 
demand for, e.g., final product 10 with initial demand of 
1,059 pcs/month, a utilization factor of 95% and percentage 
setup of 5%, is 953 pcs/month.  
Applicable Customer Required Lead time (CRL) values 
are estimated in a preliminary simulation study. Summing 
up the average production lead times for each processing 
stage delivers a basic lead time value. The average CRL for 
our simulation study is determined by multiplying this basic 
lead time value with a CRL factor of 3. To model stochastic 
effects in CRL a log-normal distribution with a coefficient 
of variation of 0.5 is applied. In our simulation model, all 
customer orders are accepted. Due to an average utilization 
below 100% in the considered production system, short 
term overloads can be balanced in future periods or by 
covering customer orders with safety stocks. 
Overall costs, consisting of holding and tardiness costs 
are selected as performance measure. The holding costs per 
piece and day are 1 CU for final products, 0.5 CU for semi-
processed materials and the tardiness costs for final products 
are 19 CU per piece and day for the basic scenario. In the 
sensitivity analysis, tardiness costs of 9 and 99 CU per piece 
and day are investigated as well. In the simulation study, 5 
years are simulated, where the first year is considered as the 
warm-up period and therefore excluded from the analysis. 
Due to the stochastic effects in demand and CRL, each 
iteration is evaluated with 10 replications.  
C. Planning Parameters 
Applied lot sizing rules, safety stock levels and planned 
lead times are important planning parameters for MRP [3]. 
In our simulation study, we choose Fixed Order Period 
(FOP) as lot sizing policy and the number of periods, for 
which the demand is accumulated into one production lot, as 
a planning parameter. To examine the influence of different 
safety stock levels, a safety stock factor is introduced as 
planning parameter. The actual safety stock is the initial 
value of safety stock multiplied with the safety stock factor. 
The fixed planned lead time of MRP is introduced as a 
factor, which is multiplied by the basic lead time values. 
These values are generated in the preliminary study, which 
is already used for setting customer required lead time 
values (see Section B. Scenario Definition). The initial 
value for safety stock of a product type is its average 
demand per day, i.e., a safety stock factor of 4 means that 
the average demand of 4 days is kept on safety stock. 
For the safety stock relaxation methods, defined in 
Section II, a lower bound for the safety stock is introduced 
as an additional planning parameter. This minimum safety 
stock is again implemented as a factor that is multiplied 
with the applied safety stock. In order to get reasonable 
planning parameters for the safety stock relaxation methods, 
as well as for MRP, a grid search procedure is applied. 
Table IV shows the specified values for all planning 
parameters with respect to the different utilization factors.

D. Improvement potential and best parameters for basic 
scenario 
The basic scenario is defined as the setting with 95% 
utilization, always setup and tardiness costs of 19 CU. 
However, since the percentage setup leads to different 
production systems both 5% and 10% setup are included into 
this basic scenario. The optimized planning parameters are 
found by identifying the parameter combination that leads to 
minimum overall costs for each method of safety stock 
relaxation and for MRP. Table V shows the results for this 
basic scenario with 5% and 10% setup. For both settings, 5% 
and 10% setup, all methods for safety stock relaxation reduce 
the overall costs significantly.  
For 5% setup, method 3 delivers the best result and leads 
to a cost improvement of 25% in comparison to MRP. In this 
5% setup setting, the number of FOP periods and the planned 
lead time factor are similar for all methods, only the safety 
stock factor is higher for method 2 and 3.

In the cost minimum solution for 5% setup, the 
introduced minimum safety stock factor is only applied for 
method 3. 
In the setting with 10% setup, method 1 leads to the best 
result. The selected parameters show that methods 2 and 3 
demand for a higher safety stock and a minimum amount of 
this safety stock, which must not be used for relaxation. 
Again, FOP periods and planned lead time factors do not 
reveal major differences for the applied methods. An 
interesting result concerning the comparison of safety stock 
relaxation methods is that method 1, i.e., having less safety 
stock relaxation occurrences but recalculating these each 
MRP run, leads to similar cost reduction potentials 
independently of the setup times. However, methods 2 and 
3, i.e., allowing the safety stock to be reduced more often, 
do not perform that well if setup times are high. This might 
be related to the fact that safety stock reduction sometimes 
implies a new production lot to refill the safety stock after 
finishing a lot with reduced safety stocks. The negative 
impact of this unintended behavior is higher if setup times 
are higher. 
To understand the influence of the planning parameters 
on the inventory, tardiness and overall cost more in detail, 
the following section discusses respective effects. 
IV. 
PLANNING PARAMETER EFFECTS FOR BASIC 
SCENARIO 
In this section, the influence of the two MRP parameters 
FOP periods and safety stock factor is investigated in detail 
to create a comprehensive understanding of how the three 
introduced safety stock relaxation methods behave in 
comparison to MRP. The influence on the performance, as 
well as the interrelationship of these parameters, is 
analyzed. Note that this analysis is performed for the basic 
scenario with 95% utilization, always setup and tardiness 
costs of 19 CU. The effects of the other parameters are 
discussed in the scenario analysis in Section V. 
A. The Influence of FOP Periods on Performance 
The application of four different methods and two 
different percentages of setup lead to eight different cases in 
this basic scenario, which are examined separately. For each 
specified value of the number of FOP periods (see Table IV), 
we select the combination of the other planning parameters, 
which results in minimal overall costs. Additionally we show 
the amount of inventory and tardiness costs and the 
minimum cost from MRP in Fig. 4. 
 
 
Figure 4.  Influence of FOP periods on costs. 
All cases show a more or less convex function for overall 
costs with respect to FOP periods with just a few outliers. As 
already mentioned in Section III, the optimal value for FOP 
periods are almost the same for all four methods. A low 
number of FOP periods leads to significantly higher overall 
costs in the 10% setup setting, whereas a higher number 
leads to a moderate increase in costs. The reason is that 
lower lot sizes lead to significantly higher setup times and, 
therefore, higher overall utilization in the 10% setup case in 
comparison to the 5% setup case. For all numbers of FOP 
periods, optimal inventory costs exceed optimal tardiness 
costs considerably. Apart from some outliers for small 
number of FOP periods, the inventory costs show a convex 
behavior with respect to the FOP periods. These results are 
in line with analytical production system findings without 
capacity balancing [7].

A detailed comparison of the optimal costs for safety 
stock relaxation methods with MRP shows that for the 5% 
setup setting, all safety stock relaxation methods lead to 
lower overall costs for a broad range of FOP lot sizes. This 
means that for lower setup times the negative effects of too 
high lot sizes can be mitigated by the safety stock relaxation 
methods. For 10% setup, only the safety stock relaxation 
method 1 leads to lower costs for a broad range of FOP lot 
sizes. This means that methods 2 and 3, which allow more 
frequent safety stock relaxation occurrences, are no more 
able to benefit from the capacity balancing if lot sizes 
become higher. This result fosters the finding from the 
previous section that these higher number of safety stock 
relaxation occurrences leads to some additional small 
production lots that reduce the overall performance.  
B. The Influence of Safety Stock Factor on Performance 
For the safety stock factor, the same analysis as for the 
FOP periods is performed and the results can be found in 
Figure 5. Note that the potential to apply safety stock 
relaxation for capacity balancing is linked to the amount of 
safety stock available. This subsection, therefore, identifies 
how much safety stock is needed for relaxation and how well 
additional safety stock is used by the methods. 
 
 
Figure 5.  Influence of safety stock factor on costs. 
The curves for overall costs show a clear convex shape 
with respect to safety stock factor, again with significant 
higher cost values for low safety stock values. For practical 
applications, this means that it is preferable to choose a 
higher safety stock when using safety stock relaxation, 
instead of selecting a safety stock that is too low. Small 
safety stock factors lead to high tardiness costs in 
comparison to inventory costs because the ability to balance 
capacity demands is limited. When safety stock is increased, 
also inventory costs increase and exceed the tardiness costs. 
The results show that method 1, with a lower number of 
safety stock relaxation occurrences, is much more sensitive 
on defining the right safety stock, similar to MRP. On the 
contrary, methods 2 and 3, i.e., more safety stock relaxation 
occurrences without/with memorizing this decision, can also 
benefit from higher safety stocks. Looking at the inventory 
costs shows that methods 2 and 3 also have lower inventory 
costs at higher safety stocks in comparison to method 1 and 
MRP. This implies that in methods 2 and 3 the average 
safety stock is lower which is intuitively clear since more 
safety stock relaxation occurrences are expected with these 
methods. Looking at the safety stock configurations for the 
relaxation methods that lead to lower costs than the optimal 
MRP setting shows that, contrary to the FOP influence, here 
methods 2 and 3 have a broader range of better parameters. 
C. The Influence of FOP Periods on Safety Stock Factor 
To explore the relationship between the parameters FOP 
periods and safety stock factor, for each value of FOP 
periods, the optimal safety stock factor is displayed in Fig. 6. 
This means, that for a fixed number of FOP periods, all other 
parameters are varied in the predefined grid (see Table IV) 
and the safety stock factor, which leads to the minimal 
overall costs is selected. Again, the 5% setup and 10% setup 
settings are shown for the basic scenario. The optimal 
parameter settings presented in Table V are marked by a star. 
In general, a lower number of FOP periods, i.e., higher 
overall shop load due to setup times, leads to a higher 
optimal safety stock factor (apart from one outlier for 
method 2 at 5% setup). This shows that specifically for high 
shop congestion, the safety stock relaxation methods demand 
for more safety stock in order to balance capacity better. The 
result for method 3 in the 10% setup scenario is interesting 
and shows a further increase in safety stock for a high 
number of FOP periods. Note that in this scenario method 3 
performs significantly worse than method 1 (see also Fig. 4). 
This implies that memorizing the safety stock reduction 
decision might in situations with high setup efforts and high 
lot covering ranges lead to system instabilities, which entail 
high safety stocks.

D. The Influence of Safety Stock Factor on FOP Periods 
In this section we fix the safety stock factor and 
determine the number of FOP periods, which result in 
minimal overall costs. The results for all methods and 
scenarios are displayed in Fig. 7. In six of the eight cases, the 
number of FOP periods show a concave shape with respect 
to the safety stock factor. Only for methods 2 and 3 in the 
10% settings there seems to be no influence of the safety 
stock on the optimal value of FOP periods. This is an 
interesting result since these are exactly the two scenarios 
where safety stock relaxation only leads to a rather small cost 
reduction potential (see Table V). 
 
 
Figure 7.  Influence of safety stock factor on FOP periods. 
Low safety stock values lead to the situation that 
flexibility related to the customer demand can only be gained 
by lower production lot sizes. These situations still lead to 
high costs because no capacity load balancing is possible 
(see Fig. 5). For medium safety stock levels, a slight increase 
in lot size leads to a lower overall shop load (and capacity 
balancing by safety stock relaxation is already possible). 
This lower overall utilization combined with the capacity 
balancing leads for most cases also to the lowest overall 
costs. For very high safety stock factors, high inventory costs 
and low tardiness costs result, i.e., customer orders can 
always be fulfilled from the safety stock. Therefore, lower 
lot sizes (lower lot covering ranges) provide a possibility to 
slightly decrease the inventory costs. 
The in depth discussion of the functionality of the 
different safety stock relaxation methods and the effects of 
different planning parameters on the performance of these 
methods indicates that these methods are promising for 
further research and practical application. 
V. 
SAFETY STOCK RELAXATION COST PERFORMANCE 
FOR DIFFERENT SCENARIOS 
After the in depth discussion of the functionality of the 
different safety stock relaxation methods in the last section, 
this section provides an analysis of the cost performance for 
a broader range of scenarios. Since three different methods 
for safety stock relaxation are presented in this paper, the 
current section shows which of them perform best in 
different cases and can be suggested for practical application 
and further research. 
A. Tardiness Cost Effects 
Since production systems face customers, which have 
different tardiness perceptions, this subsection investigates 
the methods performance for tardiness costs of 9 and 99 
CU/day in comparison to 19 CU/day in the basic scenario. 
These values are selected, because based on simple inventory 
models and in combination with inventory costs of 1 
CU/day, they correspond to a service level target of 90%, 
95% and 99%. Table VI shows the results for tardiness cost 
of 9 CU/day and an intuitive result is that overall costs for all 
methods are lower than in the basic scenario. For 5% setup, 
the cost reduction potentials are similar to the basic scenario, 
however, method 1 and method 3 lead to nearly the same 
cost reduction potential. In this case the result for method 1 
is interesting since it needs only very few safety stock. For 
10% setup, the cost reduction potential is in this scenario 
significantly lower than in the basic scenario, specifically 
method 1 performs worse since here a 5.3% cost reduction 
can be realized in comparison to 16.4% in the basic scenario. 
In general the results for tardiness costs of 9 CU/day show a 
lower cost improvement potential with safety stock 
relaxation. Note that the 10% setting is the only one in the 
broader numerical study in which method 2 shows the best 
performance.

For higher tardiness costs, i.e., more impatient customers, 
Table VII shows the results and in general, a much higher 
cost reduction potential is observed. For 5% setup, method 3 
performs best and for 10% setup method 1, which is 
consistent with the results of the basic scenario. However, 
method 2 shows a lower performance than in the basic 
scenario. A further interesting finding is that higher safety 
stocks are applied by most of the methods. This result is in 
line with simple analytical planning parameter optimization 
models without safety stock relaxation opportunity, which 
also show an increase in safety stock if tardiness costs 
increase [4]. The minimum safety stock factor is not 
significantly higher than in the basic scenario meaning that 
all safety stock is available for capacity balancing. 
Summarizing the general results for tardiness costs shows 
that higher tardiness costs lead to a better performance of 
safety stock relaxation. For practical application, this means 
that capacity balancing is more important if customers are 
more impatient or service level sensitive.

B. Utilization Effects 
The comparison between 5% setup and 10% setup in the 
basic scenario already provides the insight that overall 
system utilization has a big impact on the performance of 
safety stock relaxation methods. In this subsection the 
influence of lower overall utilization, i.e., 90%, and higher 
overall utilization, i.e., 98%, is studied.  
The results for lower utilization are shown in Table VIII 
and a general intuitive finding is that lower utilization leads 
to lower overall costs for all methods including MRP. For 
the 5% setup case, no safety stock is optimal for MRP and 
methods 1 and 2, i.e., these methods do not lead to a 
performance improvement. Method 3 leads to a performance 
improvement of 3.9%, which is far less than in the basic 
scenario. For 10% setup, method 3 leads to a cost reduction 
potential of 10.1%, which is higher than in the basic 
scenario. An interesting finding here is that for 10% setup 
method 1 and method 2 lead to higher costs than MRP. This 
means that for low utilization, the additional disturbances, 
which are caused by capacity balancing and relaxing safety 
stocks, have a higher negative influence on the overall 
performance than the positive effect of avoiding capacity 
shortages. The good performance of method 3 shows that 
especially in such lower utilization cases it is important to 
memorize the safety stock decisions to avoid additional 
disturbances. In general the result for 90% utilization shows 
that low production system utilization has only few needs for 
capacity balancing and only low improvement potential.

For high utilization cases, Table IX shows that capacity 
balancing has only a lower improvement potential and that 
all safety stock relaxation methods lead to similar results. 
High safety stocks are needed by all methods including MRP 
and a high minimum safety stock factors is needed for the 
different methods. The high utilization leads to a system that 
is near to instability, i.e., a lot of planning parameter 
combinations lead to a theoretical utilization above 100% 
and, therefore, to an instable system. An interesting finding 
is that all methods (including MRP) lead to optimal lot sizes, 
which are below the maximum lot size of FOP 16. Based on 
the production system and customer demand uncertainties, 
higher lot sizes imply that sometimes short term demands 

98

occur for which additional production lots have to be issued. 
Hence, one explanation for this medium optimal lot size in 
this case is that this medium lot size provides a trade-off 
between too many setup operations based on low lot sizes 
and too many setup operations based on short term demands 
or safety stock refill orders.  
In general, the results concerning utilization show that 
the best performance for capacity balancing can be gained 
for medium to high system utilizations. If the system 
utilization is too low, capacity balancing is not needed and if 
the system utilization is too high, there is only very few room 
for balancing the capacity, i.e., it is difficult for safety stock 
relaxation methods to refill the relaxed safety stock.

C. Setup Effects 
In the scenarios above, each new production order leads 
to a setup at the respective machine. This setting is chosen 
since the production system is a simplified setting with a low 
number of materials in comparison to real world systems. 
However, the results from Section IV and the two 
subsections above indicate that methods 2 and 3 might lead 
for some specific planning parameter combinations to small 
production lots from refilling the safety stock and less 
efficient capacity balancing. Therefore, this last investigation 
allows production lots to be put together and be produced 
without setup. In detail, a setting where setup occurs only if 
the material changes is studied. If there are more production 
orders waiting at a machine, orders with the same material as 
produced last are preferred as long as no other order has an 
earlier due date. This implementation mimics the behavior of 
workers who try to minimize their setup effort at the 
machine. Note that for this simplified production system 
structure this leads to less setup operations needed since only 
few materials are produced at each machine and the 
respective positive effects might be overestimated. 
Table X shows that for all safety stock relaxation 
methods as well as for MRP, this setting leads to lower 
overall costs. Furthermore, method 3 has the highest cost 
reduction potential in this scenario for 5% and 10% setup. 
This means that being able to add smaller production lots 
that just refill the safety stock to other ones that already exist, 
significantly improves the performance of method 3. 
Looking at the optimal planning parameters, shows that 
lower safety stocks, lower production lot sizes and slightly 
higher planned lead times are optimal in comparison to the 
basic setting. An intuitive result is that the cost improvement 
potential improves in comparison to the basic scenario for 
10% setup since there the setup operations show the highest 
influence.

D. Overall performance comparison 
Overall, 12 scenarios have been tested and the planning 
parameters for four methods, i.e., MRP and safety stock 
relaxation methods 1 to 3, have been optimized by search 
space enumeration. This broad numerical study shows that in 
all scenarios, the safety stock relaxation for capacity 
balancing leads to a considerable cost reduction potential. A 
managerial insight is, therefore, that using safety stock to 
balance capacity should be considered for improving 
production planning performance and rather simple 
heuristics already perform well.

Comparing the different safety stock relaxation methods 
shows that method 2, i.e., having more safety stock 
relaxation occurrences but not memorizing them, shows the 
worst performance and is only in 1 of the 12 scenarios the 
best option. Interestingly, methods 1 and 3 show in general a 
similar performance, i.e., method 1 leads in 5 scenarios to the 
best result and method 3 in 6 scenarios. Also concerning the 
average improvement potential, method 1 leads to an average 
cost improvement of 13.2% and method 3 to 13.5%. 
However, their performance in different scenarios differs 
significantly. For example, method 1 shows a significantly 
better performance for 10% setup and the basic scenario as 
well as for tardiness costs 99 CU/day. However, method 3 
shows a significantly better performance at utilization 90%, 
where method 1 shows even a slight cost increase for 10% 
setup. From a managerial perspective, this means that both 
methods perform well but it depends on the specific 
production system structure, which one might be better to 
apply. For further research this means that both methods 
have potential to be further investigated and their sensitivity 
to planning interactions has to be further studied.

CONCLUSIONS 
In this article, three methods for temporary relaxing 
safety stock as an extension to traditional MRP are 
investigated. Since MRP neglects capacity constraints, 
heuristics for balancing capacity demand can improve the 
performance of the production system. The results of the 
simulation study show that all methods for safety stock 
relaxation lead to significant improvement in overall costs in 
comparison to MRP. For a broad range of numerical 
scenarios, the relative cost improvement potential of the best 
respective safety stock relaxation method is between 4% and 
33%. Concerning planning parameter effects, one finding 
with practical relevance is that a higher safety stock is 
advantageous when relaxing safety stock, because there is 
only a small increase in inventory costs while decreasing 
tardiness costs due to capacity balancing. Opposite to this, a 
safety stock, which is too low, leads to considerably higher 
overall costs. Also for production lot sizes, too low lot sizes 
have shown a significantly lower performance than too high 
lot sizes. With respect to tardiness costs, the results indicate 
that higher tardiness costs lead to a better performance of 
safety stock relaxation. Concerning utilization we find that 
most improvement potential is gained for medium to high 
utilization. However, a very high utilization leaves only little 
space for capacity balancing and, therefore, a lower 
improvement potential is reported.  
The performance comparison of the three developed 
safety stock relaxation methods shows that method 1 and 
method 3 perform similar while method 2 shows the worst 
performance. Even though, the performance of method 1 
(leading to fewer safety stock relaxation occurrences without 
memorizing them) and method 3 (implying more relaxation 
occurrences but memorizing them) are similar, they lead for 
different system settings to different results. For further 
research this implies that both methods could be applied and 
combined with further actions for capacity balancing. 
Limitations of this study are the selected ranges for the 
planning parameters for the grid search, which cannot 
guarantee an optimal solution. Furthermore, the simulation 
study is applied to a simple manufacturing structure. In 
further research, the safety stock relaxation methods have to 
be tested in more complex production structures or real 
production systems to get better estimates for the 
improvement potential in real world manufacturing systems. 
The robustness of the solutions, with respect to changes in 
utilization or machine failure behavior, could also be 
investigated. Additionally, other methods for capacity load 
balancing, e.g., lotsize adaption or alternative routings could 
be implemented and the their performance could be 
compared to the safety stock relaxation.
