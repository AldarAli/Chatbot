Abstract—The contribution starts from the European Regulation
2016/679 to analyse the terms ’accountability’, ’responsibility’
and ’liability’ and their meaning. Accountability is the key to
verify that there is an ethical implication in the GDPR through the
evaluation of the related human actions. Every action can qualify
the behaviour as ’accountability’ and hence confer an ethical
connotation. We consider the differences among the meaning of
the mentioned terms as a starting point to deﬁne an ontology of
the GDPR.
Keywords–Data Protection; Ethics; Accountability; Responsibil-
ity; Liability.

INTRODUCTION
The present contribution aims to investigate on some terms
laid down by the European Regulation 2016/679 (General Data
Protection Regulation - GDPR) [1], highlighting how their
meaning is not the same in all the ofﬁcial languages of the
European Union. We think that the deepening on the sense of
the terms ’accountability’, ’responsibility’ and ’liability’ is a
relevant focus both to clarify what each term should explain
in the data protection context and a good starting point for
working on an ontology of the GDPR. We demonstrate that
the meaning of the terms above is not the same in all the
ofﬁcial languages (especially in Italian), where the true sense
belongs to the English languages. Once demonstrating the
correct meaning, it is possible to address the ontology that
is a complex process anyway. Here, we do not explain the
ontology, but we would introduce this topic for the following
works.
II.
THE EUROPEAN REGULATION N. 2016/679
The European Regulation 2016/679 (General Data Protec-
tion Regulation - GDPR) "on the protection of natural persons
with regard to the processing of personal data and on the
free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC
(General Data Protection Regulation)" has been published on
4 May 2016 in the Ofﬁcial Journal of the European Union
and entered into force on 25 May 2016, but it applies from 25
May 2018. According to the Article 94, this Regulation repeals
the Directive 95/46/EC [18] with effects from 25 May 2018.
The GDPR mentions the Charter of Fundamental Rights of
the European Union [2] in the ﬁrst Whereas (The protection
of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal
data is a fundamental right. Article 8(1) of the Charter of
Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ’Charter’)
and Article 16(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the
European Union (TFEU) provide that everyone has the right
to the protection of personal data concerning him or her).
One of the primary goals of the European regulator was to
harmonise the legislation of each Member State: the GDPR is
directly applicable in each European State, to avoid possible
confusion among each domestic law. The aim of the Euro-
pean regulator, conscious of the high value of the personal
information, was to protect the natural person with regard
to the processing of personal data; the GDPR recognises
several rights to the ’data subject’ (Article 4.1 says: "an
identiﬁed or identiﬁable natural person (’data subject’); an
identiﬁable natural person is one who can be identiﬁed, directly
or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identiﬁer such
as a name, an identiﬁcation number, location data, an online
identiﬁer or to one or more factors speciﬁc to the physical,
physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social
identity of that natural person").
The main rights of the ’data subject’ laid down by the
GDPR are:
(a) right to request from the controller access to and rectiﬁ-
cation or erasure of personal data;
(b) right to withdraw consent at any time;
(c) right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;
(d) right of access;
(e) right to rectiﬁcation;
(f) right to erasure (â ˘AŸright to be forgottenâ ˘A ´Z);
(g) right to restriction of processing;
(h) right to data portability;
The listed rights show how relevant is the role of the ’data
subject’ and hence the high value of the personal data.
Regarding the processing of personal data the GDPR
lays down speciﬁc obligations for the controller (Article 4(1)
number (7) says: ’controller’ means the natural or legal per-
son, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or
jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the
processing of personal data; where the purposes and means
of such processing are determined by Union or Member State
law, the controller or the speciﬁc criteria for its nomination
may be provided for by Union or Member State law), and the
processor (Article 4(1) number (8) says: ’processor’ means a
natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body
which processes personal data on behalf of the controller),
mainly observing the principles according to the articles 5 and
6 and implementing "appropriate technical and organisational
measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk"
(Article 32).
The GDPR is a milestone because it brings a new approach
to the protection of natural persons with regard to the pro-

cessing of personal data, introducing numerous changes, such
as, inter alia, the accountability principle, the Data Protection
Impact Assessment (DPIA), the Data Protection by Design and
by Default principle, the data breach notiﬁcation, the Data
Protection Ofﬁcer (DPO), the very high administrative ﬁnes
in respect of infringements of the Regulation, and so on.
It is clear that technology and law are not at the same
level because the ﬁrst one (technology) is always ahead than
the second one (law). The actions on the part of the legislator
always followed the technological solutions, and so the rules
have to be able to consider the technology evolution.
Apart from the law, there is also the "soft-law" that consists
of opinions issued by Data Protection Supervisory Authorities
and the European Data Protection Board (former Article 29
Working Party). The opinions are not binding but provides
clariﬁcation contributing to interpret the data protection law.
III.
THE TERMS ’ACCOUNTABILITY’, ’RESPONSIBILITY’
AND ’LIABILITY’ IN THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGES OF THE
EUROPEAN UNION
According to the Treaty on the functioning of the European
Union [3] and the Treaty on European Union, the ofﬁcial Euro-
pean languages are those mentioned in the Treaties and hence
all those of the States member of the Union. Unfortunately, due
to the language localisation, in some versions of the GDPR,
we cannot see the same terms mentioned above.
In the English version of the GDPR we ﬁnd three terms:
1) ’Accountability’ (Article 5);
2) ’Responsibility’;
3) ’Liability’.
In the Italian version of the GDPR, for example, we see
only the term ’responsibility’. In fact, the before mentioned
words are typical only of the common law systems, and each
one of them has different meanings from the other. In civil
law systems, the only used word is ’responsibility’, and hence
it is quite difﬁcult to translate in other languages, different
from English, the words ’accountability’, ’responsibility’ and
’liability’ each one with its speciﬁc meaning. Hence, the
meaning of the terms above might depend on the context, the
legislation, the jurisdiction and also from the geographic area.
On the one hand, applying the GDPR in Europe, and
especially in civil law systems, it is hard due to the iden-
tiﬁcation of the correct word to adapt in a speciﬁc case of
responsibility. On the other hand, the GDPR applies in Europe
but also all over the world according to the territorial scope laid
down by Article 3, under the conditions set out in paragraph
2. Therefore, to understand the meaning of the three terms
’accountability’, ’responsibility’ and ’liability’ it is necessary
to consider, also in the national context, only the English
version of the EU Regulation 2016/679.
This approach could be the ﬁrst step for the best qualiﬁ-
cation of an ontology of the GDPR.
What does the term ’accountability’ mean? The GDPR
uses the term ’accountability’ referring to the controller and
especially to the principle laid down by the Article 5, paragraph
2, where we read The controller shall be responsible for,
and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1
(â ˘AŸaccountabilityâ ˘A ´Z). The topic is complex. The ﬁrst ref-
erence we used to understand the correct meaning of the term
’accountability’ in Europe is the Interactive Terminology for
Europe (IATE) that is the EU’s terminology database [4]. The
IATE contains several deﬁnitions for speciﬁc domains or area,
and we chose the meanings closer to the data protection ﬁeld.
Checking the word ’accountability’ into the IATE database,
we found some results, among which the European Data
Protection Supervisor (EDPS) vocabulary, with the following
deﬁnitions that seem more relevant, even if they are taken from
different ﬁelds:
Data protection: principle intended to ensure that controllers
are more generally in control and in the position to ensure
and demonstrate compliance with data protection principles in
practice. Accountability requires that controllers put in place
internal mechanisms and control systems that ensure compli-
ance and provide evidence â ˘A¸S such as audit reports â ˘A¸S
to demonstrate compliance to external stakeholders, including
supervisory authorities.
Public sector: the obligations of persons or entities, including
public enterprises and corporations, entrusted with public
resources to be answerable for the ﬁscal, managerial and
program responsibilities that have been conferred on them, and
to report to those that have conferred these responsibilities on
them [7]. The above deﬁnitions show that, depending on the
area, the meaning of the term ’accountability’ might be differ-
ent. Nevertheless, apart from the sector or area, the deﬁnitions
have something in common. In fact, among the most important
dictionaries, we found the same deﬁnitions or the same concept
of ’accountability’ always derived by the root ’accountable’
(The term ’accountability’ is deﬁned: a) the quality or state of
being accountable, especially: an obligation or willingness to
accept responsibility or to account for one’s actions: Merriam-
Webster Dictionary online [6], or b) the the fact or condition
of being accountable: English Oxford Living Dictionary [7],
or c) the fact of being responsible for what you do and able
to give a satisfactory reason for it, or the degree to which this
happens: Cambridge Dictionary online [8]. Analysing the term
accountable we see that the word ’accountability’ is strictly
related to an action by a person (these are the deﬁnitions of
the term accountable: a) subject to giving an account (subject
to giving an account) [9], or b) required or expected to justify
actions or decisions; responsible (ministers are accountable
to Parliament) [10], or c) someone who is accountable is
completely responsible for what they do and must be able to
give a satisfactory reason for it (In settings where responsibility
for policy making is most clear, incumbent politicians are
held accountable for macroeconomic performances) [11], or
d) responsible to someone or for some action; answerable
(The council that represents them is funded by the public to
serve the public - and must be accountable to the public) [12].
In common law systems, the term "accountability" is closely
related to the "responsibility", and the distinction is a thin
line of demarcation. The characteristic of "responsibility" is
autonomy, that is, a person - in his function - can act without
external pressures or interference and therefore be free to make
motivated decisions associated with his / her role while being
bound to duties or obligations. A person "responsible" can
make choices according to his intentions and is not under
the control of others, and he or she is free to decide also
about moral or social choices. The connection between role or
function and the effects of the subject’s actions or omissions
characterise precisely the "responsibility").
49

INTERNET 2019 : The Eleventh International Conference on Evolving Internet

We believe that it is possible to attribute to the term
"responsibility" an ethical connotation on the basis of the
the decisions that a "responsible actor" can freely assume.
Someone [13] describes the "responsible actor" as «[...] one
whose job involves a predetermined set of obligations that must
be met in order for the job to be accomplished. [...] In many
cases, simply discharging this primary obligation (the function
associated with the role) may be sufﬁcient unto itself; however,
responsibility can also include moral obligations that are in
addition and usually related to the functional obligations of the
role. Thus, responsibility assumes that the actor becomes also
a moral agent possessed of a certain level of moral maturity
and an ability to reason».
An "accountable" subject, hence, is obliged to respect
external conditions for which he does not have a power of
self-determination and lacks the autonomy of the "responsible"
subject but he or she is accountable for the consequences of
his work anyway. Thus, an "accountable" subject is obliged
to maintain a behaviour bound by sources external to him-
self, which are beyond his control and the power of self-
determination. An "accountable" subject is also "responsible".
The data controller, therefore, is "accountable" and hence
conditioned by factors external to himself (the regulation to
be respected), although he is capable of self-determination
and has autonomy of action. Similarly, the controller is also
"responsible" as he is free to evaluate the actions to be taken
to comply with the GDPR rules.
Coming back on accountability, according to Thomas
Bivins [13] "The simplest formula is that a person can be
held accountable if (1) the person is functionally and/or
morally responsible for an action, (2) some harm occurred
due to that action, and (3) the responsible person had no
legitimate excuse for the action. Ideally, the assumption would
then be to hold a person who is responsible for an action
also accountable for the results of that action". Bivins [13]
continues with the following statement: "In other words,
accountability is a response to the human acts that one has
performed. If it is a good act, the person deserves praise
and if it is a bad act a person deserves blame. The idea of
responsibility and accountability are closely linked, however
are they slightly different by deﬁnition or moral implication".
According to T. Bivins [13] "accountability might be deﬁned as
"blaming or crediting someone for an action" â ˘AˇT normally
an action associated with a recognized responsibility". The
term ’accountability’, hence, is related to the effects of
an action for which a person is not able to excuse. The
characteristic of accountability is the autonomy, and namely,
a person can act without pressures or interferences hence
being free to make decisions associated with his or her role.
Furthermore, ’accountability’ is linked to a behaviour typiﬁed
by a moral or social connotation. Considering the moral and
social connotation of accountability, we think that it is possible
to evaluate implications in the ethical ﬁeld.
Paragraph 2 of the article 5, in the English version, uses
different terms as compared to the Italian translation, where
we read: "The controller shall be responsible for, and be able
to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 ("accountability
")". We read, instead, in the English version of the GDPR
two ontologically and legally different terms: on the one hand,
the controller shall be: "responsible for ... (paragraph 1)" and
on the other hand "able to demonstrate compliance with ...
(paragraph 1)", qualifying this behaviour as "accountability".
In light of what has been said, the data controller, is
"responsible" (for the power of self-determination to demon-
strate compliance with the regulation) and free to act and take
decisions of moral importance, that is to say, respect or not the
norms. The controller is also "accountable" and bound by the
principle expressed in paragraph 2 of article 5 and responds,
under article 83 for the violation of this principle.
"Accountability" has been translated into Italian with "re-
sponsibility", and the term "responsible" in the ﬁrst part of
paragraph 2 of article 5, is translated as "competent". The
Italian jurist could remain disoriented and confused, having
to qualify juridically "competence" and "responsibility".
In the Italian juridical system, indeed, there is only a
concept: "responsibility". The important aspect is related to the
identiﬁcation of the juridical nature of the behaviour, related
to the role of a subject (the data controller), against the law
(mainly action or omission - The controller shall be responsible
for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1
(’accountability’)). The data controller could act (poorly, and
therefore not respect the principles set out in paragraph 1) or
not act (omit to comply).
The burden of being "able to demonstrate compliance
with" (respect for principles) ﬁnds other references in the
GDPR and speciﬁcally in article 24, Paragraph 3 where we
read "Adherence to approved codes of conduct as referred
to in Article 40 or approved certiﬁcation mechanisms as
referred to in Article 42 may be used as an element by
which to demonstrate compliance with the obligations of the
controller". The legislator, in the English version, used the
term "responsibility" precisely to indicate the status of the
’responsible actor’ who is free to decide whether to use the
certiﬁcation mechanisms to be able to demonstrate compliance
with the obligations laid down by the GDPR. According to the
common law systems approach, here we are not faced with a
hypothesis of "accountability" for the reasons explained above
on the qualiﬁcation of the two different roles "responsible
actor" and "accountable actor".
Moreover, there are differences between the English ver-
sion and the Italian one of Article 82 of the GDPR titled "Right
to compensation and liability". The European legislator used in
the English version the term "liability" to highlight a situation
where, in case of damages, there are different consequences
instead of the administrative fees. Liability, instead, is a legal
obligation. In the Italian juridical system, instead, we qualify
the "liability" always as responsibility.
According to the article 83 paragraph 5, infringements of
the principles laid down by Article 5 "shall be subject to to
administrative ﬁnes up to 20 000 000 EUR or in the case
of an undertaking, up to 4% of the total worldwide annual
turnover of the preceding ﬁnancial year, whichever is higher".
Therefore, the sanction explains how the GDPR, considers
’accountability’ as a high-value principle, layding down ’re-
sponsibility’ and ’liability’ for its infringement. Responsibility,
thus, is related to a person and it refers to the outcomes of
actions and it is strictly related to accountability.
In light of this, it is clear the choice of the term ’ac-
countability’ adopted by the European legislator in the GDPR
because, despite being typical of the common law systems,
has the aim to highlight and stress exactly the actions (or

omissions) of the controller in respecting of the EU Regulation
2016/679.
IV.
ETHICS AND DATA PROTECTION
The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), during
the 40th International Conference [14] said [15]:
"What then is the relationship of ethics and the law?
From my perspective, ethics come before, during and after the
law.
It informs how laws are drafted, interpreted and revised.
It ﬁlls the gaps where the law appears to be silent.
Ethics is the basis for challenging laws".
The mentioned statement was perfectly aligned with the
theme of the conference (Debating Ethics: dignity and respect
in data driven life). Ethics is the new challenge in the ﬁeld of
the protection of personal data, where the primary goal is to
guarantee the data subject’s rights paying attention, particularly
to human dignity.
The attention of the Data Protection and Privacy Com-
missioners, the stakeholders and the civil society, is moving
from purely technical aspects towards more high-level ones,
focusing, hence, on concepts strictly related to human values:
human dignity. The risk is that a natural person becomes
pure data, debasing and losing so the exemplary aspects
belonging to a human. Ethics is the correct path to preserve
the ontological nature of human.
In light of this, the question is: What is ethics? There are
no easy answers because we have several deﬁnitions. We want
to refer to a way of thinking that can help us to distinguish,
generally speaking, what is wrong from what is right, ﬁnding
the right key to conferring a natural person the exact value
belonging to him or her. Accountability is an element related
to ethics on the basis of the behaviour of a person and his or
her choice to take action or not.
We must investigate ethical speciﬁc aspects to allow us
having an efﬁcient approach discovering the correct pathway
towards a balance between Data Protection and Ethics. Robert
Goodin [16] talks about the ’Vulnerability Principle’ which he
thus deﬁned: "Moral agents acquire special responsibilities to
protect the interests of others to the extent that those others are
specially vulnerable or in some way dependent on their choices
and actions". The Goodin’s deﬁnition of ’vulnerability princi-
ple’ mentions terms (moral agents, responsibilities, vulnerable,
choices and actions) that are very close to the accountability
deﬁnition as explained in the previous paragraph. Hence, in
ethical behaviour, people should pay attention to avoiding to
make choices and action that could be a vulnerability cause
for others. In the data protection ﬁeld, it is mandatory to avoid
any detriment to the data subject.
The GDPR does not lay down any speciﬁc rules on Ethics.
Nevertheless, we think that it is possible to start applying the
GDPR principles thinking ethical: it is a matter of approach
even without any norm.
V.
ETHICS AND PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS IN THE DATA
PROTECTION DOMAIN
The main question is "How is it possible in practice to
respect Ethics in the Data Protection?" Also, in this case, the
answer is not simple, but we can indeed refer to the ’Data
protection by design and by default’ principle laid down in
article 25 of the GDPR. In fact, according to the article 25,
paragraph 1, of the GDPR "the controller shall, both at the time
of the determination of the means for processing and at the
time of the processing itself, implement appropriate technical
and organisational measures".
Accountability is the main reference in this case because
any infringement of the mentioned principle entails admin-
istrative fee "up to 10 000 000 EUR, or in the case of an
undertaking, up to 2% of the total worldwide annual turnover
of the preceding ﬁnancial year, whichever is higher". The
controller have to respect the GDPR accountably. In a case, for
example, where developers work on a project to carry out an
algorithm, they respect the ’data protection by design’ principle
paying attention during the design phase to norms and rules
on the protection of personal data.
Nowadays, we assist in an increase in the technical re-
sources that use Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI). Ethics is much
important especially where - through the AI - software works
getting data, often not either provided directly by the data
subject, processing so massive amount of personal information.
Ethics entails the respect of the principles ’Data protection by
design and by default’ and hence, also here, the controller has
to be accountable.
Each natural person, giving his or her personal data, trust
the ’controller’ who must adopt the appropriate technical and
organisational measures and respect the data protection laws.
The misuse of personal data, due to the inappropriate use
of personal information belonging to a natural person, is a
data breach. Any misuse is a breach of trust, and it entails
an ethical violation and, above all, the infringement of the
data protection laws. The AI Now Report 2018 [17] from AI
Now Institute, New York University shows ten points on the
Artiﬁcial Intelligence and in point 5 and point 10 we ﬁnd
reference to Ethics (AI Now Report 2018, New York, 2018
- Point 5. "Technology companies should provide protections
for conscientious objectors, employee organizing, and ethical
whistleblowers. 10. University AI programs should expand
beyond computer science and engineering disciplines").
VI.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we demonstrated how the meaning of the
terms ’accountability’, ’responsibility’ and ’liability’ are re-
lated to a common law system and their translation in other
languages does not ﬁnd useful to explain the appropriate sense.
Thus, our research describes how and why in the GDPR,
we read three different terms related to responsibility, and
this is the reason to refer to the English version to better
understand the sense. We also highlighted the ethical characters
that connotate ’accountability’ in choices taken by a natural
person. Dealing with data protection and privacy should always
suggest to people considering the ethical approach in every
single case, analysing human behaviour - actions (or omission)
- as a part of the ’accountability’. Furthermore, this research,
at the same time, shows how we can consider the terms
mentioned above as a part of the ontology of the GDPR. We
are carrying out a full analysis of the terms laid down by
the EU Regulation 2016/679 hoping to publish soon speciﬁc
research on the GDPR ontology.
