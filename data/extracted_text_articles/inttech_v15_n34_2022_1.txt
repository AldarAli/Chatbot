Abstract—Social media has become one of the most popular
means of social interaction among humans, and recent statistics
suggest that more than two thirds of Internet users use social
media sites. This work investigates and determines aspects of
social media that can be integrated into a notification system to
minimize the effects of information overload. The preliminary
findings of the study showed that introducing social media
elements to notifications and notification systems potentially
increases the credibility of notification systems and the clarity
of notification. The evaluation consisted of the following parts:
user demographics and general knowledge questionnaire, the
execution of predefined tasks, rating of difficulty, and information
provided by the system after the execution. It was carried out
online with 35 students from Graz University of Technology
and high school students from different schools in Austria
and Kosovo. The participants reacted positively to notifications
formatted as social media posts, rating them as more trustworthy
than traditional notifications. Social media elements had the
effect of helping the participants with determining the difference
between fake and real information. The survey results could
provide the initial steps toward new use cases of Social Media
applications in notifications and other disciplines that deal with
users’ cognitive ability to process information or disciplines where
information overload is considered detrimental. This research
shows potential improvements to notification systems with the
use of social media elements.

I. INTRODUCTION
This paper is an extension of our previous work on the
applicability of social media elements in notification systems
in large interconnected organisations, presented in [1].
The use of modern information and communication tech-
nologies (ICT) has increased the amount of available informa-
tion and made that information easily accessible. However, this
has also resulted in users experiencing information overload
[2], which can be defined as the state when users are presented
with large amounts of information that exceed the processing
capacity of the users [3].
One of the domains for information overload are notification
systems. Users receive a large amount of notifications from
multiple applications on multiple devices (i.e., an application
that delivers to users information that they need to know
through messages, e.g., a new email has been received). No-
tifications allow applications such as email clients, messaging
applications, calendars, and others to inform users of incoming
messages from other users, upcoming events, reminders, new
emails, and more without explicitly requiring user interaction
with the application. Since each application has a specific
notification format, the user is presented with a large amount
of different information, making it hard to process and keep
an overview [4].
Based on a study of 40191 randomly selected participants
from different areas of work, users receive on average 44.9
notifications per day from multiple sources. Participants re-
ceived notifications from 173 applications. Some of the appli-
cations were email applications (e.g., Gmail or Outlook), text
messaging applications (e.g., Whatsapp or SMS applications),
and voice messaging applications (e.g., Google Hangout and
Skype) [5]. Findings also shown that high number of notifica-
tions, in particular from email clients and social networking
applications, correlate with increased stress and the feeling
of being overwhelmed. They distract users from executing
current tasks and induce negative emotions [6]. Another study
based on a sample of high-performing management individuals
has revealed that the increase of information overload leads
to more stress and negative emotions in individuals [3].
Users recognize that notifications are potentially disruptive and
distracting, as they disrupt the current engagement of the user
[5].
Despite the disruptive nature of notifications, users decide to
use them because of their benefit in providing relevant infor-
mation. In this context, notification systems can be beneficial
and attempt to aggregate the previously mentioned information
from different sources (e-mail clients, news portals, messaging
platforms, and others) and deliver it to the user in the form
of notifications [7]. In addition to providing information ag-
gregation and notification delivery, notification systems enable
notification management (e.g., selecting which applications are
allowed to send notifications), reducing the need of the user to
constantly interact with different applications [8]. The success

of a notification system depends on the accuracy of supporting
the user with information between tasks, while simultaneously
enabling utility by providing access to additional information
[9]. Notification systems attempt to keep users informed by
balancing the amount of valuable information provided and
the disruption caused by the information. It is necessary to
find means to coordinate the delivery of notifications from
multiple applications across multiple devices or/and display
only relevant information at a glance. By bringing together
multiple sources of notifications, the user can determine the
importance of a notification and reduce the level of distraction
[10].
According to [9], there are three critical parameters for the
creation of a successful notification system:
1) Interruption - is defined as an event where users have
to shift their attention from the main task and switch
focus to the notification. Examples of these events are
receiving notifications while operating heavy machinery,
where the notification should not distract the user from
the main task. However, other situations, such as medical
emergency alerts, require that the notification explicitly
interrupts the user [11].
2) Reaction - is defined as the response to the stimulus
provided by the notification. Some examples of user
reactions are ignoring notifications, removing them from
the notification list, and clicking on the notification.
3) Comprehension - is defined as the use of notification
systems with the goal of remembering and making sense
of information at a later point in time. Based on past
reactions, a notification system can show notifications
to users when they are more likely to read them.
While quick and correct reaction to information is important
in many situations, it is also important to present the informa-
tion in a comprehensible way. Notifications should display a
balance between the interruption, reaction, and comprehension
parameters based on situation, content and user habits and
preference [9].
One of the main challenges with designing a notification
system is learning when and how to display understandable
and valuable messages at a glance without explicitly disturbing
or distracting the user. This problem has been tackled in
different disciplines. Potential practical concepts can be found
on social media, especially Social Media Marketing (SMM).
The goal in SMM is to present information to the user at a
specific time based on previous user behavior and experiences
with other similar users. The information contains social
media elements and should not irritate the user but stimulate
engagement with the content. This SMM information usually
aims to guide the user to a social media site [12].
Social media sites have become one of the most popular
means for social interaction among humans, and recent statis-
tics suggest that more than two-thirds of internet users use
social media sites [13]. One of the main reasons for its pop-
ularity is the user engagement and personalized information
it provides to the users. There are also drawbacks such as
the lack of security and privacy, internet addiction, frequent
interruptions from other tasks, information overload, creation
of information bubbles, and loss of social contacts [14].
Gamification is defined as the adoption of game technology
and game design methods outside the games industry. Using
game design elements in non-game contexts to motivate and
increase user activity and retention has gained traction in
diverse fields. Recent years have witnessed a rapid expansion
of consumer software inspired by video games [15]. Motivated
by gamification and its success we theorized that the reuse of
elements of Social Media and SMM concepts in the field of
notification systems could yield beneficial results. Concepts
related to user engagement and information presentation can
potentially be adopted in notification systems and other infor-
mation systems to improve the flow of messages to users and
improve user engagement.
Kietzmann et al. [16] identified seven main functional build-
ing blocks of social media: identity, conversations, sharing,
presence, relationships, reputation, and groups. These building
blocks can be identified in various social media applications,
like networking sites, photo-sharing platforms, blogging plat-
forms, video-sharing platforms, collaboration platforms, and
micro-blogging platforms.
In this paper, we want to identify social media elements
based on previously mentioned functional building blocks
of social media and explore which of these social media
elements can be adopted in a notification system. The goal is
to improve user interaction and navigation, information value,
information dissemination of notifications, and understanding
of notifications in notification systems. Additionally, attention
is also given to mitigate possible side effects of social media
elements and notification systems, such as wasting time ana-
lyzing and reviewing information provided to the user through
the notification system.
Based on the observations stated above, more specifically,
the main research questions are:
• RQ1: Which elements of social media can be integrated
into notification systems to display understandable and
valuable notifications at a glance without explicitly dis-
turbing the user?
• RQ2: Would users prefer to receive notifications with
integrated social media elements like hashtags, topic
keywords, source information, rating by other users, and
groups information?
• RQ3: How do users react to notifications with additional
information (hashtags, user group information, content
approval/disapproval, and social media posts)?
• RQ4: Which emotions do users experience when re-
ceiving notifications with and without this additional
information?
To this end, the remainder of this paper is organized as
follows: Section II covers the literature overview and discusses
current topics in social media, notification systems, and their
relation and use-cases. In Section III, the methodologies used
in the study and the study are explained. The results are
presented in Section IV, together with a discussion of the study
outcome. Finally, we conclude the work in Section V.

II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
Inspired by SMM, where the integration of social media
elements into marketing information has led to greater user
engagement and satisfaction, we propose adopting social me-
dia elements in notification systems and notifications [12].
In analogy to gamification applying game design elements
in non-game contexts [17], it is proposed to integrate social
media elements in non-social media contexts. The application
in notification systems aims to improve the readability of
notifications and increase its information value.
The remainder of this section assesses the drawbacks and
advantages of notification systems, describes social media
elements, and investigates possible integration in notification
systems.
A. Notification Systems
There are many different implementation versions of no-
tification systems. The most commonly used are push noti-
fication systems for mobile phones, desktop status notifica-
tion systems, browser-based notification systems, in-vehicle
information systems, and others [18]. As mentioned in the
previous chapter, notification systems attempt to communicate
important information to users effectively without creating
an unwanted intrusion into current user tasks [7]. Selecting
important information for the user is a difficult task. A study
of 400+ participants has shown that users are not satisfied
with the notifications they receive from notification systems
because they do not express the user’s current interest. This
leads to users ignoring most notifications from these systems
[19]. Besides determining what is relevant information for
the user, an essential concern in notification systems is the
display of notifications without a significant interruption of
users’ main tasks. Visual implementations of notifications that
typically are not a user’s main attention priority are called
secondary displays. Users willingly sacrifice brief interruptions
from their primary task to view information of interest on these
secondary displays [20].
There are several ways to display notification messages,
and the state of the art can vary depending on the specific
context in which the notifications are being used. Some com-
mon options for displaying notifications include using pop-up
windows or banners on a computer or mobile device, using
LED or visual indicators on hardware devices, or using in-
app notifications within a mobile or web application. These
technologies can be effective for alerting users to important
information or events in a way that is timely and noticeable
without being overly disruptive. Overall, the state of the art
for displaying notification messages is constantly evolving,
and there are many different technologies and approaches
that can be used to effectively alert users to new information
[19][20][21].
B. Social Media Elements
The above-mentioned functional building blocks of social
media are umbrella terms used to cover many elements of
social media observed on different social media platforms.
Based on the analysis of social media sites and research
on aspects of social media [12][16][22] we identified and
summarized some of the most common elements. Table I
displays these elements.
TABLE I
SUMMARY OF MAIN SOCIAL MEDIA ELEMENTS
Social Media
Element
Description
Hashtags
A hashtag is a metadata tag type used on social
networks to help users find resources with a specific
theme or content [22][23]
Microblogs
Microblog services allow users to post and share
short textual messages that are then propagated to an
audience, which can then quickly interact with the
posts and between each other [24]
Content
approval/
disapproval
Social cues that send signals of social appropriateness
or social acceptance of content to the content creator.
Examples of these social elements are Likes, Retweets,
Reactions, and more [25]
User Groups
User groups represent the extent to which users can
form communities and sub-communities. The more
‘social’ a network becomes, the bigger the group of
friends, followers, and contacts.
User-to-User
Relationship
User-to-user relationships express the extent to which
users can relate to each other (e.g., friendships on
Facebook or Followers on Twitter) [16]
User Identity
It represents the degree to which users expose their
identities on social media sites. It includes exposing
information such as name, age, gender, profession,
location, and other users’ identifiable information [16].
Taking into account the definition of social media elements
from Table I and the description of notification systems above,
we have decided to exclude user identity from our research
and for the review in this section. The main reason for the
exclusion of this element is that it is too focused on the
individual. Including user identity information in notifications
displayed to the user does not improve the information on
notifications. Showing this information would be redundant
for the user and could not be integrated into the context of
notifications without privacy concerns.
1) Microblogs: Similar to microblog posts, notifications
are messages displayed to the users with the intent to share
information. These messages can contain information from
different applications (e.g., email subject and part of email
text, new message alert). Based on the above description, it can
be concluded that notifications share similarities to microblog
post entries. However, unlike notifications that do not contain
much additional information in their visual representation,
microblog posts can contain aspects of social media, such
as hashtags, group information, content approval/disapproval,
and others. These elements allow the users to determine the
importance and validity of a post. Aspects such as the number
of individuals that have shared, liked, or approved the post,
topics related to the shared post, and the type of individuals
that have interacted with the post are of crucial importance to
assess the value of the post and the information within [26]
[27].
An example of a microblogging service is Twitter, one of
the largest microblogging services with more than 300.000
3

posts generated daily. Twitter is classified as a social network
because individuals can communicate and connect with each
other to form social groups on Twitter. They form social
groups by following each other or following trending hashtags
and/or topics [24].
2) Hashtags: A hashtag is a metadata tag type that is
used on social networks to help users find resources with a
specific theme or content. The content of hashtags can be
dynamically generated or user-generated and can only consist
of letters, digits, and underscores. Hashtags are iconic features
that enable easy retrieval of connected resources [22][23] .
They are also used to construct a personal word/hashtag vector
space of a user by examining the users’ linguistic expression.
Hashtags are inserted into the existing user word vector space
using co-occurrence information and evaluated to determine
whether the newly constructed vector space represents the
personal linguistic expression of the individual [28]. These
methods intend to represent individuals by learning about
potential representations using hashtags. Different methods
for learning semantic representations exist. Some of them are
Word2Vec, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Latent Dirichlet
Allocation, and Recurrent Neural Network Language Model
(RNNLM) [22]. Besides identifying and representing user
characteristics, hashtags are used to connect similar resources,
by assigning tags to provide contextual information [29].
Hashtag Retrieval is an information retrieval methodology
which aims to retrieve relevant hashtags for a giver query
from a collection of resources. Besides retrieval, an interesting
topic for notifications is hashtag automatic annotation, where
hashtags are generated based on content, with the goal to
classify the content per topic. Automatic tag recommenda-
tion or annotation can improve the efficiency of text-based
information retrieval systems. Due to the nature of hashtags
it is possible to extract correlations between resources from
different systems by exploring their hashtag representations
[22].
3) Content approval/disapproval: There are several ap-
proaches to provide a system with the necessary user feedback
information. IR systems use explicit information through user
feedback or implicit information through user monitoring to
determine user interests. Unobtrusive user interaction monitor-
ing identifies content potentially interesting for users, without
interfering with the user’s normal work activity. Monitoring
systems also leverage heuristics to deduce negative examples
from observed behavior [30][31]. Providing and receiving
feedback is also a fundamental component of participation
in social media. In addition, the popularity of social media
has enabled the use of rich user information from Facebook
and other social networks to predict users’ latent traits for
recommendation [32]. Based on the study mentioned above,
users have expressed a need for more personalization in
notifications; integrating likes or dislikes into a notification
system as a means of collecting feedback from the user
related to notifications could be beneficial for improving the
satisfaction rate of users [19].
4) User Groups: A widely discussed relationship group
metric is the Dunbar Number, proposed by Robin Dunbar in
1992. He theorized that people have a cognitive limit that
restricts the number of stable social relationships with other
people to about 150. Social media platforms have recognized
that many communities grow well beyond this number and
offer tools that enable users management of memberships [33].
The assumption that the vocabulary used to discuss a topic
stays similar between different user communities and does not
vary significantly over time directly suggests that it is possible
to compute the overlap of topics of two or more communities.
This community similarity can connect communities from dif-
ferent social networks (e.g., Facebook), facilitate information
sharing between communities, and extract community interest
[34]. Furthermore, user groups and group behavior information
infer social cues, including group information (e.g., number of
people with the same interests who approved a notification or
executed a specific action) in notifications could increase the
credibility and information dissemination of notifications.
5) User-to-User Relationship: The type of relationships
users form between each other determines what information
exchanges between them. For example, when users form
professional relationships online, the information exchanged
between them will have professional content and high value,
compared to friendly relationships where the information is
of a different nature [16]. User relationship information could
be used in notification systems to determine the character of
information presented to the user.
C. Information Combination
As mentioned in [35], access to internal and external infor-
mation and aggregation of different data sources is one of
the main factors that increase the transparency, innovation,
and productivity of large organisations. According to [36],
linking information on Twitter with information from other
sources like Wikipedia led to increased understanding of the
information and productivity when consuming the information.
D. Privacy
The rapid growth of the Web has not only drastically
changed the way people conduct activities and acquire in-
formation, but has also raised security and privacy issues for
them. Users are increasingly sharing their personal information
on social media platforms. These platforms publish and share
user-generated data with third parties that risk exposing the
privacy of individuals. Textual information is noisy, high
dimensional, and unstructured. It is rich in content and could
reveal many sensitive information that user does not originally
expose such as demographic information and location [37].
E. Discussion
Towards our goal to determine how social media elements
can enrich notifications with additional information, the sec-
tion above outlined vital social media elements and investi-
gated their application for this purpose. Table II summarizes

how social media elements could be beneficial for notification
systems.
Hashtags and user group elements provide additional infor-
mation, potentially enhancing the information in notifications.
Integrating these elements could increase the trustworthiness
of notification systems and reduce the time required for a user
to evaluate the importance of notifications. Since notification
systems lack a direct user feedback mechanism, integrating
content approval/disapproval elements could provide it. Hash-
tags in Microblogging services contain information on the tem-
poral trends of the information stream and the topology of the
spread of information. This makes hashtags a suitable tool for
archiving, tracking, and disseminating information [38][39].
Other applications of hashtags are advertising, indication of
specific objects descriptions in posts or situations, expressing
one’s feelings. Interpreting the meaning of hashtags can be
a means to learn potential semantic representations of words
linked to hastags [28].
For microblogs, besides hashtags, our research focused
on two additional features, Social Media Posts and Content
Sharing. Due to the lack of applicability in notification sys-
tems, content sharing was excluded. However, considering that
social media posts share similarities with notifications, we
determined that formatting information in notifications similar
to social media posts by including hashtags, more personal-
ized text, and information sources could benefit notification
systems.
Even though user-to-user relationships offer great insights
into users’ interests, knowing the user and connections are
mandatory to integrate this element into a notification system.
Due to the setting of our initial study, we excluded this
element from the evaluation since it was necessary to track
user relationships over a more extended period.
To this end, we have selected four social media ele-
ments for evaluation based on their applicability in noti-
fication systems: hashtags, user group information, content
approval/disapproval, and social media posts (formatting the
content of the notification as a social media post).
III.
RESEARCH STUDY
The research study focused on providing insights and an-
swering the previously mentioned research questions (RQ1-
RQ4).
A. Study Design
To evaluate the influence of Social Media elements on
notifications and notifications systems, it was necessary to
conduct a user study that simulates user interaction with
notifications and provides a way to display different types of
notifications to participants. Measuring participant interaction
with different notification types and enabling quantification
of those interactions required the user study to pique partic-
ipants’ interest in cognitive tasks (reading and understanding
articles) while showing notifications. The goal was to make
the participants assume that the notifications were not part
of the evaluation to receive non-biased results. Additionally,
it was necessary to evaluate how well participants handled
new concepts, which ones they preferred, and which ones
they disliked. The evaluation consisted of the following parts:
user demographics and general knowledge questionnaire, the
execution of predefined tasks, rating of difficulty and infor-
mation provided by the system after the execution of a task,
questions for the System Usability Scale (SUS), questions for
the Computer Emotion Scale (CES), Social Media Elements
Importance Rating questionnaire, and a feedback question-
naire.
B. Settings and Instruments
The user study was executed online with students from the
Graz University of Technology and high school students from
different schools in Austria and Kosovo. It was designed as
an AB study, which meant that the participants were separated
into two groups (Group A and Group B). The participants
were instructed to individually complete various tasks, after
the execution of the tasks, they were asked to complete
the previously mentioned questionnaires and specific survey
questions.
1) General Questionnaire: contains questions listed in
Table III that aim to identify the value and effects of additional
information in notifications on the user. This questionnaire
aims to provide insights to RQ1 and RQ2, by explicitly
asking the participants about how they perceive SMEs in the
notifications they received.

GENERAL QUESTIONNAIRE QUESTIONS
Question
Q1: Did you find the additional information in the notification valuable?
Q2: When I received notifications with additional information I was more
confident in the notification?
Q3: Rank the additional information by importance
Q4: It was easier to understand the notification when I had additional
information in the notification?
Q5: Did the notification break your concentration while executing the
task?

2) Article Feedback: contains questions listed in Table IV
aimed to resolve if the users were able to determine and
evaulate if the presented articles were fake or not. Since the
survey was an AB survey, it is possible to use the feed-
back from this questionnaire to evaluate whether notifications
with additional information help determine the truthfulness of
articles and how users react to notifications with additional
information.

Fake or Real?
Q4: Do you think that the article ”3 Reasons Why You Should Stop Eating
Peanut Butter Cups!” is Fake or Real?
Q5: Do you think that the article ”Us Bacon Reserves Hit 50 Year Low”
is Fake or Real?
3) Computer Emotion Scale (CES): The scale is used to
assess the emotions of the participants, as it provides one of
the most scientific ways to evaluate emotions. Anger, anxiety,
happiness, and sadness are the emotions evaluated by the
CES. The scale was used to answer RQ4 by determining the
emotional influence of notifications on the participants, since it
provides one of the most scientific ways for emotion evaluation
[40].
4) System Usability Scale (SUS): The System Usability
Scale (SUS) is used to measure the ease of use (EOU) of a
system. It consists of ten items designed to assess EOU on
a 100-point scale. Since its creation in the 1980s, SUS has
been extensively used in human–computer interaction (HCI)
research and practice to evaluate information technology (IT).
It consists of a ten-item attitude likert scale that gives a
global view of subjective assessments of usability scale. It
is used to determine whether participants would prefer to
receive additional information notifications, which is directly
correlated with RQ2 and RQ3. It provides a trustworthy
evaluation tool for usability testing [41].
5) SME Importance Rating: to determine which SMEs
in Table II were important for understanding and perceiving
notifications, participants were asked to rate the importance of
the elements mentioned above, from 1 (not important at all)
to 5 (Very Important),
6) Article Classification Questionnaire: was used to de-
termine if users concluded that the read article was a real
article or fake news. After reading all articles and receiving
notifications related to the articles, participants were asked
which articles they thought were fake news articles and which
were real articles.
The study was created using the CoDiS Survey Tool [42].
The CoDiS Survey Tool is a web based evaluation tool which
tracks and analyses participants’ behavior while presenting
specific assignments, displaying custom notifications, and dis-

playing questionnaires to the participants. Figure 1 displays
how the user interface of the CoDiS Survey Tool displays the
articles, notifications and tasks for the participants. The user
interface consists of a task view, where the participants can
read the tasks related to the current article, seen in the top
section of the image, above the title of the article and below the
progress element. Below the article text are the user interaction
buttons, that enable the user to execute article specific actions
(e.g., share article on facebook, comment on article, etc.).
C. Procedure
Participants were asked to read articles mentioned in Table
V and execute predefined tasks (share articles, comment on
the article, and more).

As the participants completed these tasks, the notifications
related to the articles were displayed. Notifications were dis-
played as part of the CoDiS Survey Tool as web elements that
appear when the user starts reading an article. Depending on
the user group, these notifications were either with additional
information or without additional information. The additional
information included hashtags, user group information, and
social media post formatting. This additional information
integrates all selected social media elements from the previous
chapter.

D. Study Participants
The participant target groups for the study were high school
and university students. In total, 215 individuals were asked
to participate and only 35 completed the study. The age of the
participants ranged from 15 to 34 years old, with 57.14% of
the participants in the range from 15 to 20 years, 25.72 % in
the range 20-25, 14.289 % in the range 25-30 and 2.85% in the
range above 30 years old. Female participants made 28.57%
of the total amount of participants, while male participants
made 71.43%. As stated previously, the study was designed
as an AB study, which is why the participants were divided
into two groups (Group A and Group B). The purpose of this
division is to reduce bias between users. Both groups received
the first article with additional information notifications. The
purpose of this was to create a control article and familiarize
the users with this type of notifications. Group A received
simple notifications on even-numbered articles, while group B
received them on odd-numbered articles. After the participants
finished reading the articles and the article-related tasks, they
had to complete an evaluation.
IV.
FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION
Analyzing the answers to the questions presented in Table
III, we have concluded that the participants find the notifica-
tions easier to understand and share the thought that they have
more credibility when presented with additional information.
The additional information in notifications has increased
the value of notifications to the user based on answers to
Q1 from Table III. As seen in Table VI, 85.71% confirmed

the premise that additional information is valuable to noti-
fications. The participants had more confidence in notifica-
tions with additional information in comparison to standard
notifications. Table VI shows that 60% of the participants
voted that additional information increases the confidence of
the notifications. Based on Q3 from Table III 77.14% of
the participants stated that they find it easier to understand
notifications with additional information. With 60% of the
participants answering with ”Yes” to Q5 of Table III, we can
confirm that the notifications break user concentration, which
validates the results of previous research [3][5].
According to [9], the success of notification systems is
dependent on the information they convey to the user. The
survey participants agree with this as shown in Table VII.
It reveals that users are predominantly concerned with the
content and source of notifications. It implies that adding
additional information to validate the content and source
increases their value to users. The results in Table VII also
validate our proposal that formatting notifications as social
media posts could improve the information presented to the
user since the content was formatted to be similar to a social
media post. Contrary to our research, the group information
(e.g., ”22 readers validated text”) was not ranked as highly
important by the participants.
As seen in Figure 4, the distribution of SUS answers reveals
that most of the users agree or strongly agree with questions
Q2, Q4, Q6, Q8, and Q10 of the SUS [41] while disagreeing
or strongly disagreeing with the rest of the questions. It is
also visible that questions related to the negative rating of the
system contain a significant portion of neutral answers, com-
pared to questions focused on positive system ratings. These
results indicate that the participants have formulated a positive
opinion about notifications with additional information and
that they would use a system with this feature, while not
explicitly agreeing that there are negative aspects in such a
system.
Due to the large number of neutral answers, the average
rating of the SUS scale is 69.78. This is slightly above the
limit of 68 set by [41] as the value that is the minimum for
a usable system. Based on the SUS results, we can infer that
users would prefer to use a social media notification system.
The result of the CES is shown in Table VIII, the table
contains a list of feelings a participant has experienced.
The CES shows that the users were happy most of the time
executing tasks and receiving notifications, while none of the

Table VIII, the emotion anxiety has the lowest score because
most users rated it with ”none of the time” followed by
sadness and anger.

The best-rated emotion was ”Happiness” where the majority
of the users answered with either ”Some of the Time”,
”Most of the Time” or ”All of the Time”. These results do
not correlate with previous studies, where users experienced
negative emotions and stress while receiving notifications [6].
As part of the evaluations, the participants had to determine
which articles were fake and which were real. The results of
this evaluation are presented in Table IX. Besides the first arti-

cle (”Friends reunion”), the participants could not distinguish
fake from real. Only 57.93% of the cases were the articles cor-
rectly classified. Participants who received notifications with
additional information classified articles with a 6.61% greater
accuracy. As stated in Section III the participants were asked
to rate the importance of the additional information, Figure 5
describes the result of the importance classification. The source
of the information and the content of the notification were the
elements that were rated as very important, while the position
of the notification was classified as not at all important.
Hashtags and group information were elements that were
rated as important, leaning more towards slightly important
than fairly important. In conclusion, the users appreciated
information sources and content of notifications more than the
position of notifications or user group validation information,
while hashtags received a neutral rating.
Due to the inability to track the usage of notifications over a
longer period, we could not evaluate all social media elements.
V. CONCLUSION
This work investigates and determines aspects of social
media that can be integrated into a notification system to
minimize the effects of information overload. With an empha-

sis on SME applications in notification systems, this research
study concludes by demonstrating the potential of social media
aspects in several fields. The preliminary analysis shows
how the selected social media elements might enhance user
satisfaction and the significance of information in notification
systems. Additionally, it is observable that the additional
SME information does not enhance the effects of information
overload, but improves the perception and understanding of
notifications. Based on the SUS it was determined that a
system that uses SME for the enhancement of notifications
is considered a s a usable system. Not all SMEs’ use cases
were investigated due to time restrictions and the limited
number of SMEs considered. Additional SMEs, other media
and devices for notification display could be considered for
review in future work. Future research may also examine how
users respond over time to messages that provide additional
information. This could allow us to evaluate the SME studied
and other SMEs that were unable to participate in this study
more effectively. This may allow for a better evaluation of the
analyzed SME and additional SMEs that could not be part
of this study. Tracking user reactions for longer periods to
different combinations of SMEs in notifications could lead to a
novel approach to the use of SMEs within notification systems.
The survey results could provide the initial steps toward new
use cases of Social Media applications in notifications and
other disciplines that deal with users’ cognitive ability to
process information or disciplines where information overload
is considered detrimental. In conclusion, there are several ad-
vantages to integrating social media elements into notification
systems. Using social media elements for notifications can help
to ensure that important information is disseminated quickly
and widely. This can be especially useful in emergencies,
where time is of the essence. This research shows potential
improvements to notification systems with the use of SME.
