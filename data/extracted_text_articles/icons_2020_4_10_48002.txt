Abstract—In recent years, the security of power systems has
become a growing challenge resulting from the expansion of
the use of wireless power and data transmission. This paper
introduces a new circuit topology for Near Field Communication
(NFC) Topology which are based on the Wireless Power and Data
Transfer (WPDT) systems. Traditional WPDT circuits are based
on inverters to create an oscillation for the transmitter coil. By
adopting switches, the traditional WPDT circuitry has intrinsic
sources of power loss and requires an extra switching time control
circuit for the correct commutation. In addition, these systems
have low data cryptography capabilities. Therefore, a new WPDT
system has been developed which utilises memristors without
adopting switches. In addition, this topology is as advantageous
it is possible to adopt chaotic encryption for NFC security. The
simulation results and tests prove the functionality of the WPDT
based on Memristor and their quality of data generation and
storage. The major application for this type of circuitry is the
NFC digital code for the opening of the high security block.

INTRODUCTION
The growing request for wireless technology has quickly
attracted a lot of attention in the investigation of Wireless
Power and Data Transfer (WPDT) systems for different uses.
Unlike RF transmission, the operating principle of WPDT is
based on the resonance of magnetic and electric ﬁelds by
means of an alternating current in the LC circuit. This AC
power is created by switches activated in external control
system. For short-range tasks such as a gap of few centimetres,
the working frequency of the resonant circuit is generally in
the range from 10 kHz to a few MHz [1]. Typically, the power
dissipation in the inverter grows with the operating frequency.
As the air gap increases, less connection of the magnetic
ﬂux is caught by the receiver winding [2], [3]. Most of the
research results in WPT systems focus on effective transfer
mode, operating principles and circuit topology [4], [5], [6].
In the near future, the inductive WPDT connection will
gradually eliminate charging and communication cables as
power and data can be integrated simultaneously [7]. On the
other hand, it inevitably entails the hazards of theft or loss
of power and data. While a selective WPDT technology can
achieve a power transmission oriented to speciﬁc receivers
through multiple receivers [8], [9], illegal receivers can track
and block the operating frequency to steal power and data.
In this work, we present a new WPDT topology with
advanced security capabilities. We use the memristor to create
LC resonance oscillation instead of traditional switches and
therefore less power dissipation. Also, there is no need to add
an external circuit to operate the switches, and there will be no
timing problems. In addition, thanks to the unique non-linearity
and memory characteristics of the memristor, it is possible to
adopt a mutual authentication key based on the last state and
its subsequent encryption and decryption.
A. Memristor
The memristor is a circuit element based on the electrical
charge q and the magnetic ﬂux ϕ constitutive relationship
theorized by Prof. Leon Chua [10]. This component (short
for memory resistor) was manufactured for the ﬁrst time by
Hewlett Packard laboratories [11]. This device has a pinched
I − V hysteresis cycle with switching mechanism and has
the ability to remember its last state [12], [13]. Details on
the history, device, manufacturing and characterization of
the memristor are available in the following references [14],
[15], [16]. Memristors with their non-linearities are properly
integrated into existing linear or non-linear electronic circuits
to create several new chaotic circuits [17]. Dynamic behaviors,
such as chaos and hyper-chaos [18], [19], coexisting multiple
attractors [20], [21], hyper-chaotic multi-wing [22], [23] and
hidden attractors [24], [25], [26] have been studied and ana-
lyzed by numerical simulations and hardware experiments.
In this work, we therefore propose a memoristor-based
architecture for WPT systems. The system has the quality
of transmitting power and data wirelessly without using any
switch and driver circuitry. In addition, the system is not
predictable by the algorithm and therefore has the ability
to achieve the highest level of encryption due to the last
state of the memristor that cannot be predicted and measured.
The rest of the document is organized as follows. The main
functionality and encryption and decryption capabilities are
shown in the next paragraph. In the section III, there is an
analysis of the WPT based on memristor and its stability.
System functionality and simulation results are presented in
the section IV. Finally, the section V concludes the document.

WIRELESS POWER TRANSFER AND MEMRISTOR
A special type of WPT system very sensitive to the problem
of cryptography is the Near Field Communication (NFC)
which is widely used in contactless credit cards, smartphones
and digital keys. NFC is a low-bandwidth, two-way wireless
communication technology that utilises electromagnetic induc-
tion to transmit information and allows data to be exchanged
between devices separated by up to 4 inches [27]. Access cards
and digital keys have internal user data encrypted by software
and stored in the device. This encryption is traditionally based
on the Hash function [28], [29]. This type of algorithm is well
known and is widely available on the Internet. For high security
applications, this important data must be protected by an
internal electronic device. In this work, we introduce an NFC
system based on a memory circuit capable of producing chaotic
waveforms. There are three great beneﬁts of memristors, which
are used in this WPT application:
•
Provides less heat than transistors or switches.
•
Able to store charge and remember its last state.
•
Ability to develop chaotic behaviour.
In this way, the WPT system with memristor does not require
external circuits to drive the times and is able to create highly
encrypted protection. It is not based on an algorithm that can
be hacked. The generated waveform is chaotic and is based
on the last state of the state variables. Each time the system
reads from the memristor, it will take the internal state of the
memristor to a different point of stability, which is completely
chaotic and unrelated to the previous one.
In literature, there is no such system. The cryptography
proposed in the references [30], [31] is built on the change
in transmission frequency that makes other receivers out of
resonance. Causal variation of the capacitor array according to
the algorithm creates the frequency and correspondence with
the receiver for maximum power output. Then, the transmitted
power can be packed with different frequencies and delivered
to the receiver in a speciﬁc time interval [32], [33], [34].
Nevertheless, these types of switched capacitor cryptography
are affected by discrete algorithm adjustment, ﬁnite selections
and are easy to clone. In comparison, the memristor has been
used efﬁciently in imaging and communication encryption
[35], [36] providing the highest level of encryption achieved.
In a chaotic model of memristor-based cryptography, circuit
chaos is critical to deciding on chaotic encryption and decryp-
tion. For example, a user key, which is deﬁned as the initial
values caused the chaos of the memristor circuit, has a chaotic
generation of sequences. From this sequence, encryption and

decryption is developed. Therefore, it is possible to combine
WTP technology and the chaotic memristor-based circuit to-
gether.

A. Typical Functionality
Memristor-based chaotic cryptography system model con-
sists of two parts shown in Fig. 3 and 4, which are two sym-
metrical Chua‘s circuits, Transmitter and Receiver respectively.
In a typical Chua circuit, the initial condition is applied on
the Capacitor CT from external digital source. Therefore, in
the LT CT and LRCR there is a connection to A/D or D/A
converters. According to the cryptosystem model shown in Fig.
3, the process of chaotic encryption key for opening safety data
is described as follows:
1)
The high security lock has a database of customers
and each lock has in the internal memory the ID of
the customer.
2)
The digital key or Access Card has internal ID
encrypted by the last Memristor chaotic status.
3)
At the attempt to open the safe, the lock and digital
key (Receiver) are connected to each other. Both
Memristors will develop a chaotic behaviour.
4)
The chaotic behaviour generated in the transmitter
circuit depends from the receiver status because it
induces a voltage in the transmitter coil and conse-
quently giving a new initial condition VIN. In this
way, the safe security lock digital part can immedi-
ately recognise the authenticity of the user decrypting
the data received.
5)
If the Memristor status of the digital key is the same
of the last status check, the digital part can convert
data. Otherwise, the receiver will bring the transmitter
Memristor in an unknown variables status, hence not
allowing to open the lock.

When the WPT system has reached an End Of
File, both digital parts will disconnect the Memristor
storing their last status.
Moreover, any forgery attempt to the digital key or smart-
phone will leave an indelible mark as it will bring the mem-
ristor internal status in unexpected value for the authentication
key in safe security lock. There is no possibility to come back.
It is true that the electronic system can be cloned but the
internal value of the memristor can never be predicted and
there is not an algorithm that could predict this value.
III.
STABILITY AND CHAOTIC BEHAVIOUR
In this Section, we analyse the principles of inductive
coupling and Memristor state valiable in order to integrate
them for the developed Memristor-based Wireless Power and
Data Transfer system.
A. Wireless Power Transmission
The WPT system built with memristors is shown in Fig.
4. The memristive Chua’s circuit introduced in 1 has been
improved as the inductor is a mutual inductance and CR is
the compensation capacitor. As depicted in Fig. 4, the system
is completely symmetric as two copies of the Chua circuit.
The latter circuit creates an oscillation which can bring to
equilibrium, chaos or unstability. In reference of memristive
Chua’s circuit, it has been considered the parameters‘ values
shown in Table I. As notices, the inductors values LT and
LR are 8 mH which is lower of the usual values in Chua
memristive circuits around 12 mH. It is possible to use a
lower value because of mutual induction. The current ﬂowing
in LT or the transmitter coil sets up a magnetic ﬁeld around
itself with some of these magnetic ﬁeld lines passing through
the receiver coil LR giving us mutual inductance. When the
inductances of the two coils are the same and equal, LT is
equal to LR, the mutual inductance that exists between the
two coils will equal the value of one single coil as the square
root of two equal values is the same as one single value as
shown:
Figure 5. Non-ideal active voltage-controlled memristor equivalent

The real memristor has similar behaviour and possesses all the qualities
mentioned in the paper but it not available in any simulation library.

where k is the coupling coefﬁcient expressed as a fractional
number between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates zero or no
inductive coupling, and 1 indicating full or maximum inductive
coupling. In our application, the coupling coefﬁcient is an
range between 0.4 to 0.6. A lower value of coupling is not
enough to start chaotic behaviour and to change the status
of the memristor. One coil induces a voltage in an adjacent
coil, therefore the transmitter LT induces a voltage vin
R in the
receiver, and viceversa.

(2)
Using this relationships, it is possible to adopt lower in-
ductances than the Chua‘s circuit and the symmetry of the
circuitry allows to transmit the chaotic behaviour. This chaotic
behaviour is necessary for the encryption. The transmitter and
receiver will resonate at the same frequency :
f0 =
1
2π√LC2
(3)
which adopting the values reported in II gives 6.8 kHz. It is
important to notice that this application it is not necessary to
achieve high efﬁciency. The receiver needs just enough power
to start its own oscillation and the chaotic behaviour necessary
for the encryption.
B. Memristor state variables
Therefore, it is important to show that the system has
no variation compared to the Chua memristive circuit and is
therefore stable. Either side of the system must be capable
of engaging in chaotic behaviour whenever they are in close
proximity to each other. The behaviour of the circuit derives
from the classic third order Chua circuit replacing it with
the non-ideal voltage controlled active memristor shown in
Fig. 5. The latter is composed by a buffer U1, an integrator

SYSTEM PERFORMANCE RESULTS
To assess the design, stability and performance of the
proposed memristor based WPT system, ﬁnite element analysis
(FEA) and system simulation are performed. Initially, it has
been designed the coils using ANSYS Maxwell v19 as it is
is one of the challenging part of this design. It is possible
design the size of the coil in the actual size of a passport 88
x 125 mm. In order to achieve the mutual inductance of 6.4
mH, simulation results has shown that is necessary a gap of
2 mm (air, plastic or any material with relative permeability
µR = 1) between coils. As shown in the simulation design in
Fig. 6a the spiral of the inductors has a thickness of 0.1 mm
merely visible in a larger scale as Fig. 6b. In purple is the
transmitter coil and the brown is the receiver one. By using
PSIM simulations, it is possible to plot the power transferred
and the system to working power as shown in Fig. 7. When
the receiver has ﬁnished the communication, it will stop the
oscillation in blu in the ﬁrst two graphs of Fig. 8, and it will
keep it last status in the 4th graph for a certain period of
disconnection circled in yellow in Fig. 8. Just for illustration,
the disconnection is periodic and we have shown only three
times.
A. Experiment
The system has been build with the advanced software NI
multisim 14.2 with commercial devices and Labview func-
tionality. The coils are designed as coupled inductors with
the a variable coupling factor. In order to start the chaotic
behaviour memristors develop the chaotic waveform following
the Chua’s memristive circuit. The key design speciﬁcations
and parameters are listed in Table I and II. The whole system
has been veriﬁed showing a chaotic temporal behaviour as
plot in Fig. 9. The time plot can only partially give an un-
derstanding of the chaotic behaviour, therefore the system has
been plot with an oscilloscope in X-Y mode. The results are
the phase portraits of the chaotic attractors fully synchronised
between the transmitter (left) and the receiver (right) in a time
representation in milliseconds (10 ms/div). as shown in Fig. 10.
The two circuits can generate multistability and have the same
behaviours because they have the same circuit parameters.
Thus, the initial conditions can be used as a chaotic key
sequence in encryption and decryption which is transmitted
in a synchronisation process.

CONCLUSIONS
In the future, security on power systems will play a critical
role in all electronic devices. This is the main consequence
of the elimination of wires and the deployment of wireless
power and data transmission. This growing challenge is met
with the extreme use of software and algorithms leading to
data encryption and decryption. Unfortunately, once the type
of algorithm is known, it is often violated because it is based
in the programming code. An advanced circuit topology for
wireless power and data transmission using the memory circuit
has been introduced in this article. Traditional WPT circuits
are based on inverters in order to generate an oscillation for
the transmitter coils. By adopting switches, the system has
intrinsic energy dissipation sources and requires an additional
control circuit for the correct switching time. The memristor is
able to create a chaotic oscillation without adopting switches.
The oscillation makes the system transmit power and chaotic
behaviour is very advantageous for high security encryption.
The functionality of the system has been experimented and
veriﬁed. In future works, the system will be experimented with
data transmission performance and improved cryptography
capabilities.
