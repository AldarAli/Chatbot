Abstract— Since the advent of the Internet, software 
development has continuously transformed the healthcare 
industry. Electronic medical or health records are prominent 
examples of healthcare data digitization. However, these 
records are vulnerable to cyber-attacks and data loss. Careful 
attention must be paid to data integrity, patient privacy, data 
management, and storage concerns. Blockchain technology is 
proposed in the literature to integrate healthcare information 
systems through a decentralized and unified network. 
Conceptual configurations of blockchain-based healthcare 
information 
systems 
are 
conquering 
the 
literature. 
Nevertheless, these studies lack empirical evidence. In response, 
we employ the design science research methodology and target 
the healthcare information system in Montreal, Canada. This 
paper presents an empirical research blueprint that proposes an 
integrated healthcare information system through blockchain 
technology. 
Keywords-blockchain; decentralized information system; 
healthcare supply chain; data management. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Building an efficient and trusted healthcare information 
system is arduous, given the direct impact on patients and 
global health [1][2]. In addition, the very primitive tools in 
some medical supply chains continue to challenge healthcare 
data management. Counterfeit medicinal drugs are another 
consistent and growing challenge that impacts recipients and 
the costs associated. According to a joint study carried out by 
the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) and 
the 
Organization 
for 
Economic 
Co-operation 
and 
Development (OECD), the total expenditure on trade in 
counterfeit medicines was €4.03 billion between 2014 and 
2016 [3]. 
The academic literature suggests using blockchain in 
healthcare to enhance the security and privacy of centralized 
information systems. In addition to the financial industry, 
blockchain as a distributed ledger technology attracts 
academia and various industries. Blockchain is defined as a 
decentralized database or distributed ledger of digital records 
or financial transactions that are immutably registered 
according to a precise consensus mechanism [4]–[6]. 
Blockchain’s ledger consists of concatenated blocks of 
information or digital assets using powerful and unbreakable 
cryptographic techniques to ensure the integrity and security 
of the registered data. The consensus mechanism for 
validating data in the blockchain ledger is a key element that 
distinguishes blockchain from other enterprise resource 
planning systems [7][8]. 
Digital records need to be validated to be registered in the 
blockchain ledger indefinitely. Otherwise, it is rejected. 
Small, medium, and large companies have been tested 
blockchain in the supply chain to ensure better financial, 
physical, and information flows [9]–[11]. The healthcare 
industry is no exception [12]–[14]. 
Blockchain applications in healthcare span multiple 
aspects and focus on data management, traceability, 
transparency, privacy, and security [15]. For example, 
tracking medications through blockchain within an integrated 
health information system would drastically reduce tampering 
attempts. In addition, blockchain could provide a reliable and 
secure environment for data exchange between healthcare 
actors and the government in real-time [16][17]. 
This research is motivated by the need to develop an 
integrated healthcare information system through blockchain. 
This is because the integration of healthcare stakeholders’ 
information systems remains out of reach, raising many 
problems concerning patients’ privacy and poor treatment of 
medical data. This research aims to build and test a 
blockchain-based platform that connects different healthcare 
stakeholders in Montreal, Canada. 
First, our study explores the possibility of using the private 
blockchain model (i.e., Hyperledger Fabric) to integrate 
different healthcare information systems and facilitate their 
access to a unified platform. Second, we propose hosting the 
blockchain ledger either on the cloud (i.e., Amazon Web 
Services or Microsoft Azure Cloud) or servers owned by the 
healthcare network. Third, we build application programming 
interfaces and secure access to the platform. 
This paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews the 
literature on blockchain applications in healthcare. Section III 
describes our methodology represented in the design science 
research approach. Section IV presents our preliminary 
findings. To finish with, Section V concludes with remarks.

LITERATURE REVIEW 
Blockchain can be divided into three main models: public, 
private, and consortium [4][5][18][19]. In a public blockchain 
system, access is open to all users where registered 
information is transparent. In addition, users can participate in 
the validation process of the network’s transactions. The

transactions in a private blockchain system may not be fully 
transparent. This is because one or more entities often control 
the network. Also, users who want to join the private 
blockchain network must get permission. A semi-
decentralized blockchain, called a consortium blockchain, is 
managed by more than one entity, and all are involved in 
decision-making on the blockchain network [20]. It is worth 
noting that most studies in the literature do not recognize 
different blockchain models, nor do they consider the benefits 
associated with each model in practice. 
McGhin et al. [21] highlight the need to secure electronic 
health and medical records by ensuring that only the 
authorized stakeholders have access to the records. Also, 
monitoring should be achieved to prevent the risks of possible 
tampering. The authors propose using blockchain to manage 
healthcare data better and mitigate the risk of data loss and 
cyber-attacks. 
Benil and Jasper [22] propose a public auditing scheme for 
the healthcare industry called the Elliptical Curve 
Certificateless Aggregate Cryptography Signature-scheme 
(EC-ACS). The scheme suggests using blockchain to secure 
electronic healthcare records on the cloud. 
In order to enhance patients’ privacy and protect their 
medical records, Zhuang et al. [23] develop a private 
blockchain model that enables a patient-centric Health 
Information Exchange (HIE). The authors explain the strength 
of this technology in HIE and attempt to assess the feasibility 
of its adoption. 
In a similar vein, Shi et al. [24] address the security and 
privacy policies of the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA). The authors show that 
blockchain can improve the healthcare supply chain’s 
resilience and maintain its integrity. 
III. 
METHODOLOGY 
As previously mentioned, we explore blockchain in the 
Canadian healthcare system. We are in the process of 
building an integrated blockchain-based information system 
that facilitates and secures medical records and monitors 
COVID vaccination. To do so, we follow the design science 
research methodology [25][26]. Accordingly, we divide our 
study into five phases as shown in Figure 1.  
 
Figure 1.  Progress of research phases. 
In the first phase, we conduct a systematic review of the 
literature [27]–[29] to identify the problems that confront 
healthcare information systems. In the second phase, we 
conduct interviews with the McGill University Health Centre 
(MUHC) and its stakeholders to assess the literature claims. 
In the third phase, we build the technical solution: a 
blockchain-based healthcare information system to integrate 
different stakeholders’ information systems and improve the 
integrity, privacy, and security of medical data. Other 
technologies (e.g., Internet of Things devices) will be 
considered to ensure data veracity. In the fourth phase, we 
test our system at the MUHC. In the fifth phase, we modify 
and approve the proposed system. Below is a brief 
explanation of the five phases. 
A. Phase 1: A systematic review of the literature 
(completed) 
In this phase, we review the literature on blockchain 
applications in the healthcare industry. We formulate the main 
propositions about the benefits that blockchain can bring to 
the healthcare industry and the challenges that it can resolve. 
A set of inclusion and exclusion criteria was defined to 
collect and analyze the literature. First, we employed two 
academic search engines: Scopus and Business Source 
Ultimate. Many search strings were tested to assess the 
relevance and size of the literature. This procedure produced 
277 academic papers. Second, we read each paper’s title, 
abstract, keywords, and more text if needed to evaluate the 
eligibility of the collected studies. We only included papers 
that examined the use of blockchain in healthcare as a primary 
issue. This procedure minimized the number of articles to 142. 
Third, each article was coded to capture the blockchain’s 
benefits and the challenges that it can resolve. Fourth, we 
carefully assessed the boundary conditions of each paper. 
Fifth, we highlighted the consensus algorithms proposed or 
studied in the literature for blockchain-based healthcare 
systems. Four main algorithms were identified: Proof-of-
Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), Proof of Authority 
(PoA), and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT). 
B. Phase 2: Exploratory study (occurring at the time of 
writing) 
After identifying blockchain benefits and the challenges 
that it can resolve in healthcare, we conduct several interviews 
with the MUHC to refine the literature’s claims (questions are 
listed below). It is worth noting that we do not aim to identify 
the problems of the entire Canadian healthcare system. This is 
a daunting task that may take years. Our research is a step 
forward in this direction. More precisely, our unit of analysis 
is the MUHC and its stakeholders. 
- 
What is the current design of the MUHC supply 
chain? Who are its main stakeholders? 
- 
What type of communication systems are used by 
each stakeholder? What kind of data is exchanged? 
Where is the medical data hosted? 
- 
Are there any supplementary technologies that need 
to be used with blockchain to ensure data veracity?

- 
What are the most apparent issues challenging the 
current communication systems? 
In addition, we conduct a market study to evaluate the 
most recent blockchain solutions proposed in the industry for 
healthcare (occurring at the time of writing). This study aims 
to answer several questions (listed below) that will help us 
refine our blockchain system. 
- 
What model of blockchain is used? 
- 
What is the consensus mechanism to validate and 
register information on the blockchain ledger? 
- 
Where is the medical data hosted? 
- 
Who controls the blockchain network (if any)? 
- 
What is the added value of the blockchain solution in 
healthcare? Is it measured or quantified? 
C. Phase 3: Building the blockchain solution (occurring at 
the time of writing) 
In this phase, we build (code) the blockchain database. As 
previously mentioned, we develop a private blockchain 
system on Hyperledger Fabric. Hyperledger is an umbrella 
project of open-source blockchains. It offers a high degree of 
flexibility and multiple ordering services, making it suitable 
for private sector collaborations. After building the technical 
solution, we ensure better control over the stakeholders’ 
access. 
Overall, the proposed system enables healthcare 
stakeholders to exchange medical data in real time. 
According to the network designed during the exploratory 
study, the information registered on the blockchain ledger 
would be transparent to all or some stakeholders. Figure 2 
shows a sketch of the technical solution. The proposed 
system and its components will be refined after the 
completion of the exploratory study, which is still ongoing at 
the time of writing. 
After considering this sector’s high confidentiality and 
authenticity, the system’s apparent goal is to integrate the 
MUHC’s stakeholders’ information systems with a unified 
and secure blockchain database.

D. Phase 4: Platform validation (to be completed during 
the first half of 2022) 
After building the system, another evaluation process will 
be conducted to assess and validate the proposed blockchain 
database. More precisely, the system will be subject to 
several test experiments at the MUHC. In addition, we 
interview experts, doctors, managers, information technology 
specialists working in the Canadian healthcare system. 
E. Phase 5: Communication and model evaluation (to be 
completed during the first half of 2022) 
In the fifth phase, if the results obtained are as expected, 
our system will be valid. Otherwise, we would take a step 
back to Phase 3 to make the necessary improvements. To 
proceed with this phase, we may need to conduct further 
interviews with the MUHC and its stakeholders to develop 
further or modify the system. 
IV. 
PRELIMINARY FINDINGS 
We have conducted a systematic review of the literature 
and analyzed the collected papers. Our exploratory study is 
occurring at the time of writing. Accordingly, we can report 
some of the preliminary findings. 
Our review of blockchain applications in the healthcare 
industry revealed that many consensus algorithms are not 
suitable for healthcare. Many blockchain architectures and 
new supply chain configurations can emerge by changing the 
blockchain consensus mechanism. 
Proof-of-Authority (PoA) and Practical Byzantine Fault 
Tolerance (PBFT) are examples of suitable mechanisms. 
PoW consumes an enormous amount of energy to validate 
and register information. Although the PoS is considered a 
solution for the energy problem associated with PoW, this 
algorithm does not allow healthcare stakeholders to register 
medical data flexibly. In addition, we categorized tens of 
blockchain benefits that blockchain can offer to healthcare, 
such as traceability, transparency, security, privacy, 
anonymity, interoperability, etcetera. 
Our preliminary findings from the exploratory study 
highlight that current healthcare systems are highly 
fragmented. In other words, each stakeholder has its own 
information system. Accordingly, information is poorly 
communicated with the different stakeholders, which causes 
significant delays. In addition, medical data is not secure and 
vulnerable to data loss and cyber-attacks. These factors 
negatively 
impact 
data 
management 
and 
patients’ 
satisfaction. 
Although blockchain is proposed to solve these problems, 
this potential seems to be still conceptual. We found that 
many companies today (e.g., IBM) offer easy-to-use 
blockchain solutions for the healthcare industry. However, 
these solutions are standard and difficult to customize to 
fulfill specific needs.

CONCLUDING REMARKS 
Research investigating the potential of blockchain in 
healthcare continues to grow, particularly concerning 
security, privacy, integrity, and interoperability. Most articles 
in the literature discuss the capacity of this technology to 
secure medical records. While this cannot be entirely 
dismissed, we believe that this has yet to be proven in 
practice. 
Blockchain technology has proven successful and 
attracted the attention of several industries. However, there is 
still a considerable need to develop and test customized 
blockchain solutions in practice. In response, our proposed 
system is a step forward toward building a decentralized 
healthcare supply chain. Our system solves the integration 
problem highlighted in the healthcare industry through a 
design science research approach.
