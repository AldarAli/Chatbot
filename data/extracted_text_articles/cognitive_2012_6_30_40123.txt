Abstract - The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) proposed 
by T. L. Saaty has been widely used in decision making. Inner 
dependence method AHP is used for cases in which criteria or 
alternatives are not independent enough and using the original 
AHP or inner dependence AHP may cause results to lose 
reliability because the comparison matrix is not necessarily 
sufficiently consistent. In such cases, fuzzy representation for 
weighting criteria or alternatives using results from sensitivity 
analysis is useful. We present local weights of normal AHP 
alternatives via fuzzy sets, and then calculate modified fuzzy 
weights. We also get overall weights of alternatives based on 
certain assumptions. Results show the fuzziness of inner 
dependence AHP if the comparison matrix is not sufficiently 
consistent and individual alternatives do not have enough 
independence.  
Keywords - decision making; AHP; fuzzy sets; sensitivity 
analysis. 
 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) proposed by T.L. 
Saaty in 1977 [1][2][3] is widely used in decision making, 
because it reflects humans feelings “naturally”. A normal AHP 
assumes independence among criteria and alternatives, 
although it is difficult to choose enough independent elements. 
Inner dependence method AHP [4] is used to solve this 
problem even for criteria or alternatives having dependence.  
A comparison matrix may not, however, have enough 
consistency when AHP or inner dependence is used because, 
for instance, a problem may contain too many criteria or 
alternatives for decision making, meaning that answers from 
decision-makers, i.e., comparison matrix components, are 
ambiguous or fuzzy [5]. To solve this problem, we consider 
that weights should also have ambiguity or fuzziness. 
Therefore, it is necessary to represent these weights using 
fuzzy sets. 
Our research applies sensitivity analysis [6] to inner 
dependence AHP to analyze how much the components of a 
pairwise comparison matrix influence the weights and 
consistency of a matrix [7]. This may enable us to show the 
magnitude of fuzziness in weights. We previously proposed 
new representation for criteria and alternatives weights in 
AHP [8][9], also representation for criteria weights for inner 
dependence, as L-R fuzzy numbers [10]. In this paper, we 
propose a fuzzy representation of overall alternative weights 
for double inner dependence structure AHP, using results from 
sensitivity analysis and fuzzy operations. We then represent 
fuzziness as a result of double inner dependence AHP when a 
comparison matrix among alternatives does not have enough 
consistency.   
In Section 2, we introduce AHP and its inner dependence 
method. The sensitivity analyses for AHP are described in 
Section 3. Then the fuzzy weight representation is defined in 
Section 4, and Section 5 is a conclusion. 
 
II.  INNER DEPENDENCE  AHP 
In this section, we introduce steps of normal AHP and its 
inner dependence method. 
A. 
Process of Normal AHP 
 (Process 1) Representation of structure by a hierarchy. 
The problem under consideration can be represented in a 
hierarchical structure. The highest level of the hierarchy 
consists of a unique element that is the overall objective. At 
the lower levels, there are multiple activities (i.e., elements 
within a single level) with relationships among elements of the 
adjacent higher level to be considered. The activities are 
evaluated using subjective judgments of a decision maker. 
Elements that lie at the upper level are called parent elements 
while those that lie at lower level are called child elements. 
Alternative elements are put at the lowest level of the 
hierarchy 
(Process 2) Paired comparison between elements at each 
level. A pairwise comparison matrix A is created from a 
decision maker's answers. Let n be the number of elements at 
a certain level. The upper triangular components of the 
comparison matrix aij (i< j = 1,…,n) are 9, 8, .. , 2, 1, 1/2, …, 
or 1/9. These denote intensities of importance from activity i 
to j. The lower triangular components aji are described with 
reciprocal numbers as follows 
in addition, for diagonal elements, let aii = 1. The lower 
triangular components and diagonal elements are occasionally 
omitted from the written equation as they are evident if upper 
triangular components are shown. The decision maker should 
make n(n-1)/2 paired comparisons at a level with n elements.

(Process 3) Calculations of weight at each level. The 
weights of the elements, which represent grade of importance 
among each element, are calculated from the pairwise 
comparison matrix. The eigenvector that corresponds to a 
positive eigenvalue of the matrix is used in calculations 
throughout in this paper. 
(Process 4) Priority of an alternative by a composition of 
weights. The composite weight can be calculated from the 
weights of one level lower. With repetition, the weights of the 
alternative, which are the priorities of the alternatives with 
respect to the overall objective, are finally found. 
B. 
Consistency 
Since components of the comparison matrix are obtained 
by comparisons between two elements, coherent consistency 
is not guaranteed.  In AHP, the consistency of the comparison 
matrix A is measured by the following consistency index (C.I.) 
where n is the order of matrix A, and λA is its maximum 
eigenvalue. 
It should be noted that C.I.
 0
holds. Also, if the value of 
C.I. becomes smaller, then the degree of consistency becomes 
higher, and vice versa. The comparison matrix is consistent if 
the following inequality holds. 
1.0
C.I.
                  (3) 
Also consistency ratio (C.R.) is defined as  
C.I.
C.R.
M ,

                 (4) 
where M is random consistency value. However we only 
employ C.I., since we mainly use 4 or 5-dimensional data 
whose random consistency value is not far from 1 
C. 
Inner Dependence Structure  
The normal AHP ordinarily assumes independence among 
criteria and alternatives, although it is difficult to choose 
enough independent elements. Inner dependence AHP [4] is 
used to solve this type of problem even for criteria or 
alternatives having dependence.  
In the method, using a dependency matrix F={ fij }, we can 
calculate modified weights w(n) as follows, 
where w is weights from independent criteria or alternatives, 
i.e., normal weights of normal AHP and dependency matrix F 
is consist of eigenvectors of influence matrices showing 
dependency among criteria or alternatives.  
If there is dependence among alternatives, we can calculate 
modified weights of alternatives ui
(n) with only respect to 
criterion i. Then we composite these 2 weights to calculate 
overall weights of alternative k,

where m is number of criteria. 
 
III. SENSITIVITY ANALYSES 
When we actually use AHP, it often occurs that a 
comparison matrix is not consistent or that there is not great 
difference among the overall weights of the alternatives. In 
these cases, it is very important to investigate how 
components of the pairwise comparison matrix influence on 
its consistency or on the weights. To analyse how results are 
influenced when a certain variable has changed, we can use 
sensitivity analysis.  
In this study, we use a method that some of the present 
authors have proposed before. It evaluates a fluctuation of the 
consistency index and the weights when the comparison 
matrix is perturbed. It is useful because it does not change a 
structure of the data. 
Since the pairwise comparison matrix is a positive square 
matrix, Perron-Frobenius theorem holds [11]. From Perron-
Frobenius theorem, following theorem about a perturbed 
comparison matrix holds. 
Theorem 1 Let A = (aij), (i, j = 1,…, n) denote a comparison 
matrix and let A(ε) = A+εDA, DA=(aijdij) denote a matrix 
that has been perturbed. Let λA be the Frobenius root of A, w 
be the eigenvector corresponding to λ A, and v be the 
eigenvector corresponding to the Frobenius root of A'. Then, a 
Frobenius root λ ( ε ) of A( ε ) and a corresponding 
eigenvector w(ε) can be expressed as follows

From the equation (7) in Theorem 1, the component that 
has a great influence on weight w(ε) is the component which 
has the greatest influence on w(1). Accordingly, from Corollary 
2, how components of a comparison matrix impart influence 
on the weights, can be found, to see hij
(k) in the equation (11). 
 Calculations or proofs of these theorem and corollaries are 
shown in [7]. 
    
 
IV.  FUZZY WEIGHTS REPRESENTATIONS 
A comparison matrix often has poor consistency (i.e.,  
0.1<C.I.<0.2) because it encompasses several criteria or 
alternatives. In these cases, comparison matrix components are 
considered to be fuzzy because they are results from human 
fuzzy judgment. Weights should therefore be treated as fuzzy 
numbers. 
A. L-R Fuzzy Numbers  
To represent fuzziness of weights, an L-R fuzzy number is 
used.

B. Fuzzy Weights of Criteria or Alternatives of normal AHP 
From the fluctuation of the consistency index, the multiple 
coefficient gijhij
(k) in Corollary 1 and 2 is considered as the 
influence on aij . 
Since gij is always positive, if the coefficient hij
(k) is 
positive, the real weight of criterion or alternative k is 
considered to be larger than wk. Conversely, if hij
(k) is negative, 
the real weight of criterion or alternative k is considered to be 
smaller. Therefore, the sign of hij
(k) represents the direction of 
the fuzzy number spread. The absolute value gij | hij
(k)| 
represents the size of the influence. 
On the other hand, if C.I. becomes bigger, then the 
judgment becomes fuzzier. 
Consequently, multiple C.I. gij|hij
(k)| can be regarded as a 
spread of a fuzzy weight   concerned with aij. 
Definition 1 (fuzzy weight) Let wk
(n) be a crisp weight of 
criterion or alternative k of inner dependence model, and gij | 
hij

0.1<C.I.<0.2, then a fuzzy weight

V.  CONCLUSIONS 
 We proposed a kind of modified local fuzzy weight by use 
of sensitivity analyses for inner dependence AHP in case of 
the dependence among alternatives exist. Moreover we can 
also calculate overall alternative weights for the inner 
dependence by fuzzy sets.  
Our approach shows how to represent weights and how the 
result of AHP has fuzziness when data is not sufficiently 
consistent or reliable.  
We now plan to investigate the properties of these fuzzy 
weights more and apply it to real data. In the future work, we 
will use this idea for not only inner dependence but also outer 
dependence structure.
