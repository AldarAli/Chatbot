Abstract—
An
orthopaedic
videoconference
(VC)
service
between a university hospital and a district medical centre was
initiated by an orthopaedic surgeon/PhD candidate, who also
ran the service. Four hundred patients were included and
randomized in two groups for the PhD project, where clinical
quality,
patient
satisfaction
and
cost
effectiveness
were
investigated. Five years after its initiation, the service was still
running even after the data collection was completed. The
professionals kept the service running while waiting for the
results of the study to be published because of its advantages.
However, conditions and regulations established for the PhD
project left the service constantly vulnerable to being closed
down at short notice. Based upon empirical observations,
documents, presentations, articles and interviews, I explore
how the service was maintained; that is, the mechanisms
accounting for agency/action in keeping the service viable
under unclear and shifting conditions. Within a socio-technical
perspective I adopt the notion of ‘heterogeneous assemblages’
to
analyse
such
mechanisms,
implying
that
action
is
understood as shaped by a number of shifting, heterogeneous
conditions or influences which may translate into common
strategies
through
interaction.
The
paper
presents
and
analyses the assemblages that came into play in certain phases
of the service, and reflections about the future of the service. I
argue that meaning, issues of improvement of tasks and
augmentation of the scope of related activities were main
conditions that assembled and translated into agency for
stabilizing viability. Human motivation and creativity was
therefore crucial for utilising the advantages of technologies
and
overcoming
unsteady
conditions.
This
assemblage
surmounted
other
assemblages
that
accounted
for
vulnerability. Studying agency as dynamic assemblages and
translations fuelled by motivation, along with the innovative
agency portrayed, may be applicable to other VC services.

INTRODUCTION
Videoconferencing (VC) was established between a
university hospital (UNH) and a district medical centre
(DMC) to strengthen cooperation and to improve services
for orthopaedics patients. The background was that 800
patients from the four northern municipalities in Troms
County, Norway had travelled to the UNH for clinical
consultations and follow up in 2005. Many of them travelled
four to five hours for a consultation that lasted for 15
minutes and then travelled back home the same day. Elderly
patients and parents of children found this tiring, and long
journeys are costly. These experiences were coupled with
results of research showing that VC use was clinically
useful
and
entailed
patient
satisfaction
and
cost
effectiveness; however, such research also indicated more
follow-up consultations [1-5]. The results were not directly
generalizable to the specific conditions at hand, and an
orthopaedic surgeon at the UHN wanted to investigate the
use of VC services. In 2006 she initiated a randomized
controlled study to investigate clinical effects, economic
conditions and patients' experiences with the use of VC. The
study later became this surgeon’s PhD study: ‘Tele-
orthopaedics: Decentralization of orthopaedic consultations
by means of telemedicine solutions’. The goal for the PhD
project was to provide decision-making support for the
establishment
of
a
regular
service
in
orthopaedic
consultations. Tele radiology, that is, digital transmission of
x-rays was a pre-condition.
The service started in March 2007 and is still running in
2014.
The
initial
plan
was
to
include
400
patients
randomized in two groups over a period of two years.
According to the professional participants, they wanted to
continue the VC service after two years because the data
collection required more time. However, some of the
national conditions, such as legal and economic regulations,
necessary for such services as well as regulations that had
been established for the PhD project left the service
repeatedly vulnerable to being closed at short notice.
However, it is still running, as professionals explain, ‘on
overtime’.
This paper reports on an investigation of the development
of the service, as a case study. The contribution of this paper
is to highlight mechanisms that account for viability and
optimization of the service within shifting phases and
unclear conditions. Such mechanisms are considered as
dynamic and heterogeneous assemblages where micro and
macro
influences
are
shifting
and
reconfigured
[6].
Highlighting not predicted processes that account for the use
of
certain
technologies
is
a
common
socio-technical
approach. By analysing heterogeneous mechanisms this
paper has a sociological emphasis. The intention is to add to
the understanding of why planned innovations succeed or

fail: why was this service still running when its conditions
were shifting or unclear?
The
paper
considers
the
agency,
viability
and
vulnerability of the service in the following phases: the
initial phase of the PhD project before and during 2007; the
phase when an additional service for new patient groups not
included in the PhD study was established alongside the
project around 2009–10; and the period in 2013 and 2014
which was focused on maintaining and securing the future
of the services while waiting for the results of the PhD
project to be published.
The questions and approach means that this is a study that
adopts an actor-network perspective. The questions that will
be
answered
are
as
follows:
What
composes
the
assemblages that account for the vulnerability of the VC
services? What composes the assemblages that enact agency
in keeping the service stable during the three phases of the
project?
The latter is the primary question in this paper, which is
structured as follows: In Section II, I present the project
within which the investigation was conducted as well as the
data sources, theories and the analytical perspectives in this
socio-technical study. In Section III, results are presented
according to three phases: Phase A. establishing the service
for the PhD project; Phase B. when the data collection was
completed and additional patients also were offered the
service; and Phase C. keeping it running while developing
future prospects for making it an official and regular
service. Section IV present two discussions: First the
shifting influences that translated into vulnerability and then
shifting influences translating to surmount the vulnerability
and stabilize viability through the different phases. A
conclusion section including future prospects closes the
paper.
II.
METHODS, DATA, THEORETICAL RESOURCES AND
ANALYTICAL PERSPECTIVE
As
already
stated,
this
paper
is
based
upon
an
examination of the development of the orthopaedic service,
in terms of keeping it running through shifting phases. The
examination was made possible through a research grant for
a project designed to investigate processes accounting for
video-conference
collaboration
in
clinical
practice,
in
general.
This
project:
‘Modelling
Videoconference
Collaboration’,
began
in
2013
and
is
still
ongoing.
Information about the project can be found at the website of
The Norwegian centre for integrated care and telemedicine
[7]. It investigates processes and outcomes through multi-
methodological
approaches,
including
quantitative
and
qualitative
methods
and
process
studies.
The
overall
objectives are to explore new models for clinical VC
collaboration and to analyse active mechanisms involved in
optimizing the potential of services, that is, the process of
attaining goals. Assembling agency as discussed in this
paper is considered to depict such mechanisms. The paper
thus
reports
on
an
investigation
addressing
dynamic
processes. The orthopaedic video conference service was
selected as an interesting case for investigating such
processes.
The data for this analysis is collected through various
sources:
literature
studies
of
VC
in
orthopaedic
consultations, presentations of the PhD project, information
material and media articles about the specific service from
its start in 2007. Minutes from meetings concerning
decisions about the project were also studied. This data
collection was retrospective in order to understand the
processes from the initiation of the PhD project that started
in 2007.
In addition, the following observations were conducted
from January to October 2014: five observations of VC
consultations which included a total of 15 patients (three
patients each time). Four of which were conducted at the
UHN site and one at the DMC. The aim of these
observations was to obtain insight regarding the significance
of the service, the actions and collaboration between the
professionals and their opinions and reflections on the
service. Conversations were held with the professionals at
each site after each observation and formal, semi-structured
interviews
with
two
nurses
and
one
surgeon
were
conducted. Sections of the interviews contained factual
information about use of VC services, number of patients
that had been utilizing the services, economic and practical
conditions at present and shifts during the life span of the
service/project. Other sections addressed their reflections
about the value or worth of the service for the patients and
themselves as professionals, challenges encountered on any
aspect of running the service and prospects in terms of
continuing the service. The responses were written during
the
interviews
and
results
were
confirmed
by
the
participants.
As mentioned, the results of the investigations will be
presented and analysed as heterogeneous assemblages. Such
assemblages are described within the body of research
approaches captured in the notion of complexity studies. In
these studies, information and communication technologies
(ICTs) are understood as one influence in heterogeneous
and dynamic assemblages stretching from micro to macro,
gaining power to influence goal attainment in ever-changing
constellations. Viability is considered to be an empirical
question in such assemblages, resulting from ongoing
transparent negotiations between influences, subtle power
games
and/or
material,
mental
or
scientific
resource
allocation [6, 8-10].
Assemblages may comprise (in various mixes and
connections) a plethora of elements, such as professionals,
political
authorities,
technical
agencies,
bureaucratic
organizations, ICT providers, service firms, regulatory
bodies,
software
engineering
companies
and
research
centres, together with technical, functional and normative
components. In different and unpredictable manners, these

all influence whether goals are reached and how they are
reached.
By
examining
“how they
are
reached”
the
perspective
indicates
an
interest
in
how the
various
influences affect the interpretation and enactments of the
goals. It assumes that in certain ways assemblages of
influences may fulfil the innovation within certain world
views. All elements (conditions or goals) that are considered
to belong within an innovation can in this perspective be
subject to being strengthened, disappearing or changing.
An assemblage constitutes a loosely structured, ever-
evolving
ecology
of
heterogeneous
elements
where
boundaries
and
linkages
among
administrative
bodies
cannot be unequivocally fixed, tending to shift and drift in
time. Assemblages are considered always to be ad hoc,
thereby needing constant re-conceptualization. The overall
functioning of assemblages and the viability of the ecology
itself are based as much on communications and functional
relations as authority and norms [8].
These assumptions and concepts are underlying the
approach to scientific inquiry submerged under the broad
category of complexity studies in which the ways individual
roles, groups and organizations emerge, evolve and adapt to
their environment are studied [11]. In this paper I also
consider
human
values
and
actions
as
influences
in
assemblages. To consider agency, I use the concept of
‘translation’
from
actor-network
theory,
meaning
that
interaction between heterogeneous influences may translate
to a common strategy, which in this case can be expressed
as follows: assemblages enacting agency for keeping the
service viable [9, 10].
For
the
analysis
of
conditions,
translations
and
assemblages in different phases of the service, I have
summarized data from the different sources and gradually
interpreted this summary while considering and selecting
concepts from theoretical resources. One of these was a
systematic review that identified heterogeneous conditions
for innovation in service organizations [11]. This is a
combination of a qualitative analysis where I sought to
understand how the participants made sense of what they
did in the VC service, extended with the analysis of the
heterogeneous conditions that made possible and supported
enactments and materialization of meaning.
I argue that the three most significant influences that
assembled to produce stability and viability through the
phases were as follows: the service’s compatibility with and
support of the professionals’ interpretation and actions for
obtaining meaning; its affordances which helped accomplish
tasks; and the options for augmentation of work practices.
These stabilizing influences point to the important role of
motivated professionals and their work to obtain meaning.
In this case, their focus on the help they could provide
surmounted
other
shifting
assemblages
which
enacted
vulnerability [9, 11, 12].
III.
RESULTS
The results section describes heterogeneous conditions
that
formed
assemblages
during
three
phases:
A.
establishing the service for the PhD project; B. the second
phase when the data collection was finished, but a regular
service was also maintained with new patient groups; and C.
keeping the service running while publication of results are
pending and developing future prospects for making it an
official and regular service.
A.
Assembling the PhD project
One of the conditions for the project was the fact that the
Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at UHN had decided to
increase their proportion of research. At the same time, the
Norwegian Centre for Integrated Care and Telemedicine
(NST) was pursuing increased clinical relevance for the use
of VC in UHN and had initiated a project in collaboration
with the DMC in order to decentralize services and increase
use of VC. Technical and financial support to set up the VC
unit at UHN was provided by this NST project, thereby
supporting the PhD.
Different challenges had to be addressed. For instance,
there
were
no
reimbursements
for
telemedicine
consultations, which count as a condition for vulnerability. A
group of experts were systematically working to establish
regulations for reimbursement, which was settled in 2008, so
this condition also gradually supported the service. As the
orthopaedic service to be established for the PhD was used as
an example in the negotiations for reimbursement, this
settlement constituted a strong support for its viability.
Additionally,
only
those
who
are
employees
of
the
organization that owns an IT system or service in the health
care sector in Norway are allowed to access the system or
service. This meant that only the employees of the UHN
could legally access the system. The security team at NST
negotiated with the authorities and a number of meetings
were held. This challenge remains unresolved. To address
the immediate challenge, the nurses at DMC were employed
at UHN for this specific service. This was a creative move
which was a necessary condition for establishing the service.
Due to current legislation, UHN employment of nurses was
essential as it enabled them to enter the electronic patient
record and access booking where they could find out who
had been referred for video consultation. This creative move
also made routines simpler.
In addition, according to the head of clinic, UHN owns
the
equipment
and
is
responsible
for
the
radiology
operations at DMC. The UHN department also signed a
formal agreement to provide equipment for the completion
of the PhD project. Before the project started, the nurses at
the DMC who were now employed at UHN underwent a
period of training through audit. They learned new skills,
such as plastering and using the VC equipment. They were
enthusiastic. The nurses and the orthopaedic surgeon
expressed that being of help to patients was an important
motivation for their work to make this happen. At initiation,
43

eTELEMED 2015 : The Seventh International Conference on eHealth, Telemedicine, and Social Medicine

the project was also subject to extensive media interest. The
queen of Norway visited the DMC and observed one of the
first consultations, and delegations from around the globe
also visited.
All these highly heterogeneous conditions, including
enthusiasm, interacted to form the assemblage accounting
for its success.
B.
Assembling a service alongside the project
The service was running and accomplishing specific
tasks, for instance, gypsum change, hip, knee and shoulder
controls after surgery, and diagnostics of newly referred
conditions, such as hallux valgus. Only patients who had
been referred to UHN and met the inclusion criteria for the
PhD project were selected for the service, which was
organized and carried out by the PhD candidate/surgeon as
an expert. As such, it was not an official service.
New conditions, such as new x-ray equipment at the
DMC in 2006 and improved gypsum expertise, led to fewer
referrals to UHN and challenges to reach the sufficient
number of patients during the planned period of the PhD
project. The challenges influenced the timeframe, which
was adjusted. The service was also considered to work very
well, and the professionals opened for 150 additional
patients who had not been eligible for inclusion. These
additional were for instance, patients suffering from senile
dementia. They had been excluded because they were not
expected to be able to respond to a questionnaire intended
for all the included patients. Travel was considered difficult
for this group, and the service was important. This
expansion thus enacts compassion as a condition.
Motivation to improve knowledge was another condition
for the service’s expansion and endurance. One of the
nurses at DMC stated that, ‘It represents a breathing break, a
positive element in working life. There is much running at
the lab ordinarily, but of course it depends on what is to be
done. Like plastering, it is a little more exciting. We learned
casts at UHN. We have increased our competence and we
also ran inter-municipal plaster courses here’. A nurse at the
DMC also described the emotions of the patients: ‘The
patients feel safe when we are secure; they see the x-ray on
the screen and the surgeon informs them about the
developments and examinations to be done by the nurses. It
is a reassuring situation’.
The surgeon and the nurses both stated that the DMC’s
access to the patient record was an important facilitator. The
DMC can log on to the record and see what has been
planned for VC. One nurse from the DMC said: ‘We do not
need to make appointments with UHN, but can read and
plan our resources according to the booking system. It is
simple and easy, but the UHN computer (a personal
computer assigned for UHN patients and employees) is
locked into a separate room and only the two of us have
access”. The nurses and surgeon described that the service
entailed meaningful work processes and that they also
learned new skills. The service entailed an augmentation of
their daily routines and action. These were conditions for its
expansion. However, security issues concerning access to
sensitive patient data for unauthorized personnel made it
still vulnerable.
C.
Assembling the future of the services
In 2014, the results of the PhD project are pending
publication. Meanwhile, the surgeon and the nurses keep the
service running and they intend to use the results from the
PhD project to argue for its continuation provided these
results are positive. They informed me that the service now
runs under tacit agreement. This tacit agreement is a
necessary condition for its viability. The employment of the
nurses at the DMC and the ownership of the equipment is
still in operation, The x-ray equipment has been improved,
but the VC units are old and need replacement. For instance,
new versions of programs have been installed, disturbing the
compatibility between the x-ray machine and the personal
computer.
There are no plans for continuation of the project, nor
have any new routines been worked out. At the DMC the
need for a new doctor to take care of new patients with
fractures has been communicated. Additional doctors who
have skills in plastering will increase the resource base. In
general, it is also important that additional orthopaedic
surgeons at UNH participate in the services. The skills at the
DMC
have
improved,
also
leading
surrounding
municipalities to use DMC for examination and plastering
of fractures. The good of x-ray labs and professional
radiographers have improved the quality of X-ray taken. X-
rays are described by a radiologist at UHN. The evaluation
of severity, and subsequent decisions about whether or not
to send patients to UHN, are taken by the general
practitioners. The general practitioner can take contact with
the orthopaedic surgeon at call for discussion of the case if
needed and the X-ray is easy accessed for the orthopaedic
surgeon in the hospitals X-ray records. Some patients can
have their treatment by their general practitioners in primary
care, who have skills in plastering. The VC unit has not
been in regular use for emergencies, but this is an option.
The situation concerning legal regulations is still under
development. When it comes to financial issues,
reimbursement is partly resolved, but it also depends on the
results of the discussion about legal communication between
units.
The professionals await decisions on legal regulations.
One of the nurses stated: ‘We run it because it works fine
and we want it to develop further. It is necessary to have a
sense
of
common
meaning
and
be
able
to
discuss
challenges. Now it is dependent on the professionals and
their motivation. It is vulnerable but there are great
opportunities’.

IV.
DISCUSSION
In this section I consider shifting and heterogeneous
influences
in
the
different
phases.
According
to
the
assemblage
perspective
outlined,
I
first
discuss
the
influences that interacted and translated into vulnerability.
The second discussion addresses heterogeneous influences
interacting and translating to a stabilizing common strategy
which made the service viable. The second assemblage is
emphasized as it surmounted the influences accounting for
vulnerability.
A.
Shifting influences translating to vulnerablity
The empirical findings support an impression of some
ad-hoc, heterogeneous and shifting influences. These are
identified on different levels and in different domains: i.e.
political, operational, organizational and economic [13]. The
political influences can be illustrated by the ongoing
negotiations concerning how to solve legal issues of
electronic collaboration between employees at different
institutions. As this question is not solved yet, the political
domain provides unclear conditions for the future of the
service. On an operational level, the character of the
routines that have been developed are shifting and ad-hoc as
there are no plans for how they should be established if the
service continues. The need for new equipment is also an
operational challenge. On the organizational level, the need
for more resources at the UHN site and at the DMC is
communicated.
The
continued
service
is
rendered
vulnerable. With respect to economic considerations, the
financial arrangements established for the PhD project, i.e.
the UHN ownership of laboratories and employing the
nurses, are running without any guarantee of continuation.
The interaction between these heterogeneous influences
translates
and
summarizes
into
an
assemblage
of
vulnerability, ongoing through all phases of the service, and
stretching into prospects for the future.
B.
Surmounting
vulnerability
and
stabilizing
viability
through shifting phases
The initiatives and work to establish a PhD project, to
increase the level of research at the clinic and to improve
clinical relevance at NST, as well as the nurses’ actions to
improve their skills, support a view that actors in this field
are not passive recipients of change and innovations. Rather,
they seek innovations, search meaning in them, develop
feelings about them and modify them to fit particular tasks.
The
discussion
of
agency
therefore
acknowledges
participants as actors who purposefully and creatively
interact with the complexity of levels and conditions for the
service described [11]. The influence of human actors,
especially those running the service, is distinctive in all the
phases.
One of the most influential elements of agency was the
professionals’ understanding and actions for making the
service compatible with meaning. An example of such an
effort was the expansion of the service to groups who
initially were not included in the PhD project. The
compassion for the most vulnerable patients depicts a value-
based driving force. This finding is supported by Dearing et
al. who also found that the meaning of the innovation for the
intended adopter has a powerful influence on the adoption
decision
[14].
Service
innovations
which
are
made
compatible with expressed values and norms have been
discussed as an additional support for uptake [15]. The
orthopaedic VC service is an example of such an effort.
A second influence that stands out from the results is
issues around accomplishment of tasks. The decision and
work to keep the service running under unclear conditions,
along with the way the professionals described the tasks
they were able to perform by using the service, support
notions of task accomplishment. This point of view has also
been discussed by Yetton et al. [16]. They contended that if
the innovation is relevant to the performance of the intended
user's work and if it improves task performance, it will be
adopted more easily.
The third important influence in keeping the service
viable which I derived from the results is the service as
augmentation of work practices. Aubert and Hamel asserted
that if a new technology or service is supplied as an
‘augmented product’, e.g. with customization, training and a
help desk, it will be assimilated more easily [17]. Examples
of such augmentation are the surgeon’s pursuit of a PhD; the
nurses’ accounts of the audit at UHN where they learned
new skills; the provision of a new x-ray machine; the way
the service accounted for a breathing break in a stressful
working situation and the inter-municipal plaster courses
that came with the service. All of these elements augmented
the service and were referred to as being positive.
The
influences
discussed,
i.e.
realizing
meaning,
improving
tasks
and
augmenting
work
activities,
are
considered to influence each other in a network of relations.
They translate into a common strategy and provide enough
firmness and stability to surmount the changing, ad-hoc and
vulnerable influences previously discussed for this case.
This viability is vulnerable, however, as influences and
assemblages are always changing. Human motivation and
work are overarching influences.
Assemblages are usually considered as composed of
heterogeneous elements, and the main ‘engine’ driving the
agency in assemblages is considered to be an empirical
question. In this case, compassion, willpower and meaning
fuelled human agency, helping to utilize the advantages of
the technologies and overcome the disadvantages that were
encountered. The portrait of the assemblages for agency,
including the distinctive role of human agency in this
specific situation, can be transferable to other clinical areas.
Thus, the results may help to understand and develop other
services.

V.
CONCLUSION AND FURTHER WORK
The paper contributes empirical knowledge and a
discussion of mechanisms for vulnerability and stability in a
VC service for orthopaedic consultations.
I argued that the following heterogeneous influences
interacted and were translated into a common strategy for
keeping the service viable through shifting phases: the
professionals’ understanding of - and actions for making the
service compatible with - meaning, task accomplishment
and the service as augmentation of work practices. The
interacting influences surmounted
shifting assemblages
which made it vulnerable. However, the ongoing dynamic
of shifting heterogeneous conditions still renders the future
service vulnerable.
The next phase of the project will address collaboration
models in viable videoconference services which have
existed at least from the beginning of, and through the
project period. The data collection is limited to services
within the North Norwegian Health Region, where the UHN
is located.
