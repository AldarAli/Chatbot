Abstract—A 5th Generation (5G) radio access technology is 
expected to cope with the relentless increase of the data traffic 
demand and is meant to accommodate a plethora of services with 
different requirements. In this paper, we elaborate on the design 
of the radio numerology for a 5G wide area system operating at 
carrier frequencies below 6 GHz. The main requirements are 
identified, and their inevitable conflicts are addressed. The 
proposed numerology options enable low latency with tolerable 
overhead, while maintaining a common clock with the Long 
Term Evolution (LTE) radio technology and robustness to 
hardware impairments.

INTRODUCTION 
The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) has set 
challenging 
requirements 
for 
International 
Mobile 
Telecommunications (IMT) at 2020 and beyond [1]. Such 
targets include peak data rates in the order of 20 Gbps, user 
experienced data rates of 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps, minimum over-
the-air latency of 1 ms. Current radio access technologies 
(RATs) such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) and Long Term 
Evolution- Advanced (LTE-A) [2] have   backwards 
compatibility constraints and inner limitations which make 
them unsuited to fit the ITU requirements. Industry and 
academia are currently exploring new paradigms for a 5th 
Generation (5G) radio access technology, conceived as a 
disruptive design with respects to previous generation RATs 
[3]. Besides boosting the Mobile Broadband (MBB) 
performance, 5G is also expected to support novel 
communication 
paradigms 
such 
as 
Machine 
Type  
Communication 
(MTC), 
including 
Massive 
Machine 
Communication (MCC) with a large set of connected low cost 
devices and Mission Critical Communication (MCC) for high 
reliability services (e.g., communication autonomous driving 
and factory automation).  
The ambitious 5G targets can be achieved by an intelligent 
integration of advanced technology components such as 
Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antenna techniques, 
optimized frame structure, interference suppression receivers 
and scalable bandwidth, e.g., from 10 MHz to at least 100 
MHz. 
An optimized radio numerology has a fundamental 
importance in the system design, since it ensures an efficient 
usage of the radio resources, while coping with the design 
requirements. In that respect, the numerology design is 
depending on the carrier frequency as well as the propagation 
characteristics of the environment, where the system is 
intended to operate. 
In this paper, we elaborate on the numerology design for a 
5G wide area concept operating on below 6 GHz licensed 
cellular bands, though some of the design principles can be 
generalized to other carrier frequencies. Our aim is to identify 
feasible configurations which allow to cope with the 5G 
requirements with a reasonable system overhead. 
The paper is structured as follows. Section II introduces the 
radio waveforms which are considered in the numerology 
design. The main requirements are presented in section III, 
while the numerology design along with tentative proposals are 
presented in section IV. The open issues are addressed in 
section V. Finally, section VI resumes the conclusions.  
II. 
5G WAVEFORMS 
The selection of the radio waveform has an impact on the 
numerology design. It is desirable that the same waveform is 
used in uplink and downlink; this enhances the similarity of 
the radio links, simplifying the system design and enabling 
several gain mechanisms [3]. The Orthogonal Frequency 
Division Multiplexing (OFDM) waveform has been adopted in 
the 4th generation (4G) RATs thanks to its computational 
effective approach of dealing with the multipath channel. On 
the other side, in OFDM the low complexity equalization is 
enabled by the usage of a Cyclic Prefix (CP), which is 
appended at the beginning of the time symbol and represents a 
pure system overhead. Further, OFDM suffers from a large 
Peak-to-Average 
Power 
Ratio 
(PAPR), 
poor 
spectral 
containment in case of asynchronous transmission, and 
sensitivity to hardware impairments such as phase noise and 
frequency offset. Several novel options for a 5G radio 
waveform have been presented in the recent literature, with the 
aim of overcoming the OFDM demerits. In the case of 
Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM) 
waveform [4], an unique CP is used for a large set of symbols, 
thus reducing the system overhead; further, the spectral 
containment is also significantly improved thanks to a pulse 
shaping filter applied at each frequency subcarrier. Filter Bank 
Multicarrier (FBMC) solutions have the promise of 
eliminating the CP overhead and feature an excellent spectral 
containment due to the usage of prototype filters [5]. Universal

Filtered Multicarrier (UFMC) acts instead as an intermediate 
solution between OFDM and FBMC by performing the 
filtering operations on a frequency block basis rather than per 
subcarrier [6]. All the mentioned approaches lead, however, to 
a significantly higher complexity than OFDM, especially in 
the case of MIMO  transmission. 
 
 
Figure 1. Signal generation in OFDM and ZT DFT-s-OFDM. 
It is still under study whether the promised performance 
improvement of the novel options justifies their adoption as 
5G waveforms. Nonetheless, some of the OFDM demerits can 
be easily alleviated with straightforward enhancements which 
do not compromise its selling points. For example, Discrete 
Fourier Transform – spread - OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM) 
modulation, emulates a traditional single carrier transmission 
with remarkable improvements in terms of power efficiency, 
and has been standardized as uplink waveform for the Long 
Term Evolution (LTE) RAT [2].   
Recently, the novel Zero-tail Discrete Fourier Transform 
Spread OFDM (ZT DFT-s-OFDM) waveform has been 
proposed as a further enhancement of the DFT-s-OFDM 
waveform [7]. Fig. 1 highlights the difference between OFDM 
and ZT DFT-s-OFDM in the signal generation process. In ZT 
DFT-s-OFDM, a set of zeros is added to the vector of data 
symbols, which is then DFT-processed before undergoing the 
traditional steps of subcarrier mapping and Inverse Fast 
Fourier Transform (IFFT) transform. The insertion of the zero 
samples leads to a low power tail, referred as zero-tail (ZT), in 
the generated time symbol. Such ZT replaces the CP of 
OFDM and is part of the time symbol itself rather than being 
appended at its beginning. The ZT duration can be modified 
by varying the length of the pre-DFT set of zeros; this allows 
to dynamically set the overhead which is needed to cope with 
the delay spread of the channel rather than hard-coding it in 
the system numerology. Further, ZT DFT-s-OFDM features a 
significantly lower out-of-band emission than OFDM, thus 
improving 
the 
coexistence 
of 
asynchronous 
devices 
transmitting over neighbor bands. As traditional DFT-s-
OFDM, ZT DFT-s-OFDM suffers, however, from noise 
enhancement leading to a Block Error Rate (BLER) penalty 
with respect to OFDM. However, the performance gap tends 
to vanish in case of receive diversity, especially for the case of 
four receive antennas. We refer to [7] for further details on the 
ZT DFT-s-OFDM waveform. 
Given the possibility of partially overcoming some of its 
drawbacks while preserving its remarkable selling points, our 
current vision is that OFDM and its enhancements still 
represent the most valuable candidates for a 5G waveform. 
This has been further justified in [8]. In the rest of this paper, 
the design of a 5G wide area numerology will be presented 
considering OFDM and ZT DFT-s-OFDM waveforms.  
III. 
REQUIREMENTS FOR A 5G NUMEROLOGY 
The aim of this section is to introduce the main requirements 
for the design of a 5G numerology. As mentioned in the 
introduction, in this contribution we are addressing the specific 
case of a wide area macro system operating at carrier 
frequencies below 6 GHz.  
A. 
Support of low latency. 
The ITU has set an over-the-air communication latency 
target of 1 ms. This means, both downlink and uplink round 
trip times (RTTs) should not exceed 1 ms. The downlink RTT 
includes the time of transmitting the data payload from the 
base station (BS), the time for processing it at the user 
equipment (UE) and generating an ACK/NACK message to be 
fed back, and the time for the BS to decode such 
acknowledgement message. The uplink RTT includes the 
transmission of a scheduling grant from the BS, the decoding 
of such grant by the UE, the transmission of a payload by the 
UE, and the decoding of the payload by the BS [2]. Note that, 
in the LTE numerology, the Transmission Time Interval (TTI) 
duration corresponding to the transmission of a payload, is set 
to 1 ms, making it impossible to achieve the sub-ms latency 
requirement. Such short latency can be obtained instead by 
shortening the TTI duration to 0.2 ms or 0.25 ms. Both options 
leave a certain time margin for the data processing at the 
BS/UE. Note that such TTI duration cannot be achieved by 
simply parsing the LTE TTI due to the usage of 14 symbols in 
1 ms, which do not downscale linearly with the proposed 0.2 
ms or 0.25 ms configurations.  
The usage of very short TTIs permits the achievement of 
extremely low latencies but has an obvious drawback in terms 
of higher relative overhead, from sending more frequent 
physical control channels with scheduling grants. Such 
overhead may be unnecessary for services having relaxed 
latency requirements, e.g., for MBB communication. In a 
previous contribution [9], the usage of different TTI durations 
(obtained as a multiple of the shortest TTI) and variable 
control overhead is proposed as a solution for dealing with 
different service requirements.  
B. 
Low overhead for coping with time dispersion 
The usage of OFDM modulation leads to the introduction 
of a systematic overhead given by the CP insertion, which is 
hardcoded in the system numerology. For instance, in LTE 
two different TTI structures have been defined, the first 
comprising of 14 OFDM symbols featuring a CP duration of 
around 4.76 µs each, and the second comprising of 12 OFDM 
symbols with a CP duration of 16.67 µs; both configurations 
fit the duration of 1 ms. Note that the second configuration is 
only used for Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Services

15
(MBMSs). For of the baseline configuration, the CP overhead 
is of 6.67%. In the light of a 5G numerology design, it is 
reasonable not to exceed the CP overhead of LTE.  
The selection of the CP duration in LTE is obtained as a 
tradeoff between overhead and necessity to cope with the 
excess delay spread of a large set of radio channels. 
Nonetheless, a 4.76 µs CP duration appears excessive when 
considering the reported delay spread of the ITU channels, 
which do not exceed 1.9 µs (Urban Macro NLOS with 2 km 
intersite distance [10]). In [11], the impact on the spectral 
efficiency of different CP durations has been analyzed with 
link level simulations assuming different channel models, with 
the conclusion that a CP duration of 1 µs does not lead to a 
spectral efficiency degradation higher than 5-6% even for 
Urban Macro. Nonetheless, a safer margin for the CP may be 
needed in the case of transmission by multiple cells, e.g., for 
Cooperative MultiPoint (CoMP) transmission. Measurement 
campaigns carried out in Dresden and Berlin report excess 
delays of up to 4 µs in case of downlink multicell transmission 
with three cells having intersite distance of around 750 m [12]. 
In the case of OFDM air interface, we therefore consider both 
CP durations of  ~2 µs and ~4 µs.   
In the case of ZT DFT-s-OFDM waveform, the CP is 
replaced by a low power tail which is part of the time symbols 
itself. As a consequence, the low power tail does not need to 
be hardcoded in the numerology, thus simplifying the system 
design. 
C. 
Common clock with LTE 
Future devices are likely to support different RATs and the 
chip manifacturers would benefit from a system which 
maintains a common clock with already supported RATs. In 
that respect, it would be beneficial designing a 5G numerology 
which is based on the same reference clock as LTE. Ensuring 
such commonality does not necessarily require to use the same 
identical rate, but a frequency which can be synthetized from 
the same oscillator. Integer and fraction frequency synthetizer 
offer a simple circuital realization for synthetizing different 
frequencies from the same common reference [13]. For 
example, the 5G clock rate can be synthetized as follows: 
                    5𝐺𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 = 𝐿𝑇𝐸𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 ∙
𝑎
𝑏 = 𝑁𝐹𝐹𝑇∆𝑓𝐿𝑇𝐸
𝑎
𝑏                 (1) 
where 𝐿𝑇𝐸𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 denotes the LTE sample rate, corresponding to 
the product of the Fast Fourier Transform (FTT) size 𝑁𝐹𝐹𝑇 and 
the subcarrier spacing ∆𝑓𝐿𝑇𝐸 (15 kHz), and 𝑎 and 𝑏 are generic 
integers. Equation (1) immediately translates to the following 
requirement for the 5G subcarrier spacing: 
          ∆𝑓5𝐺 = ∆𝑓𝐿𝑇𝐸
𝑎
𝑏                                (2) 
D. 
Similar number of resource elements as LTE 
The chosen subcarrier spacing and CP duration have an 
impact on the number of available resource elements. In 
OFDM, each data symbol is directly mapped to a frequency 
subcarrier; a resource element corresponds then to a subcarrier 
symbol. In ZT DFT-s-OFDM, a resource element corresponds 
to a non-zero pre-DFT data symbol, with reference to Fig. 1.  
In the case of LTE downlink 20 MHz configuration (with 
effective transmission bandwidth of 18 MHz), the resource 
elements correspond to 1200 frequency subcarriers per time 
symbols, for a total of 14 symbols per TTI. This leads to 
16800 resource elements per ms. We consider a reasonable 
criterion maintaining at least the same number of resource 
elements of LTE in a 5G air interface.

E. 
Robustness to hardware impairments and high speed 
Ensuring robustness to impairments such as frequency 
offset or phase noise is another fundamental requirement for a 
5G RAT. This is further motivated by the necessity of 
supporting low cost devices for MTC, which may feature poor 
oscillators and radio frequency front-ends. Further, the phase 
noise is expected to have a larger impact in our 5G concept 
than in LTE since our 5G concept is intended to operate at 
higher carrier frequencies. 
The usage of a sufficiently large subcarrier spacing can 
counteract the impact of phase noise. In [11], the optimal 
subcarrier spacing for a system operating at 6 GHz and 50 
kmph speed was estimated to be around 60 kHz. Such estimate 
was derived by linearly scaling the power spectral density of a 
phase locked loop CMOS oscillator operating at 37.6 GHz. 
Nonetheless, an oscillator model for 5G has not been defined 
yet, since it is still unclear how the evolution of the electronic 
components would impact its performance. As a rule of 
thumb, we set as a requirement for a 5G system operating at 
below 6 GHz carriers to be significantly larger than the LTE 
one, e.g., 𝑎 ≫ 𝑏 with reference to (2). The usage of a large 
subcarrier spacing also improves robustness to the Doppler 
spread in case of high speed UEs.  
Nonetheless, there is a fundamental tradeoff between 
subcarrier spacing and system overhead in the case of an 
OFDM (or ZT DFT-s-OFDM) air interface. The usage of a 
large subcarrier spacing leads indeed to a short time symbol 
duration, and therefore to a large number of symbols to be 
accommodated in a TTI with a given duration: this can 
significantly increase the overall CP overhead (or the overhead 
of the ZT in ZT DFT-s-OFDM).  Fig. 2 depicts the CP/ZT 
overhead as a function of the subcarrier spacing assuming a 
TTI duration of 0.25 ms. The two sets of curves refer to 
absolute CP/ZT durations of 2 µs and 4 µs, respectively, as 
motivated in the previous section. In general, the overhead

tends to increase faster for the ZT DFT-s-OFDM modulation, 
which however features the benefit of setting such overhead 
variable. For the case of a 4 µs CP/ZT, it is not possible to 
obtain significantly a larger subcarrier spacing than LTE while 
having lower or similar overhead; the 6.67% LTE overhead is 
indeed reached for a subcarrier spacing of around ~17 kHz. 
Achieving further robustness to the phase noise at higher 
carrier frequencies comes then at the expense of an overhead 
increase. In the case of a 2 µs CP/ZT, the overhead constraint 
is instead maintained for subcarrier spacing up to around ~35 
kHz.  
IV. 
NUMEROLOGY DESIGN 
In this section, we propose the design of feasible 
numerologies for our 5G wide area concept for below 6 GHz 
carrier frequencies coping with the outlined requirements. We 
restrict here our focus to a Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) 
system, though some of the concepts can be generalized to a 
Time Division Duplex (TDD) system by including Guard 
Periods (GPs) in the frame design. 
A. 
Design for OFDM  
We define the numerology by setting the subcarrier 
spacing of 5G accordingly to (2), and numerically computing a 
large number of combinations by varying both 𝑎  and 𝑏 
parameters. For each combination, the CP duration can be 
expressed as  
                                   𝑇𝐶𝑃 =
𝑇𝑇𝐼5𝐺−
𝑁𝑠𝑦𝑚
∆𝑓5𝐺
𝑁𝑠𝑦𝑚
                                 (3) 
where 𝑁𝑠𝑦𝑚 is the number of symbols in the TTI. The CP 
overhead is given by (𝑁𝑠𝑦𝑚𝑇𝐶𝑃)/𝑇𝑇𝑇𝐼, while the number of 
resource elements per ms is given by  
                              𝑁𝑅𝐸 = ⌈
𝐵
∆𝑓5𝐺 𝑁𝑠𝑦𝑚
𝑇𝑇𝐼𝐿𝑇𝐸
𝑇𝑇𝐼5𝐺 ⌉                         (4) 
where ⌈𝑥⌉ denotes the nearest integer lower than 𝑥 , and  𝐵 is 
the effective system bandwidth. We consider here 𝐵  =18 
MHz, corresponding to the LTE 20 MHz configuration.  
For the case of a CP having an approximate duration of ~2 
µs, it is possible to find configurations coping with all the 
requirements outlined in section III.  In that respect, we restrict 
our focus to subcarrier spacing values at least double than the 
LTE one, i.e., 𝑎 ≥ 2𝑏 with reference to (2), and consider a CP 
ranging from 1.8 µs and 2.3 µs.  
Numerologies for a CP duration of approximately ~4 µs 
need instead to relax either the robustness to the hardware 
impairments or the overhead. We consider subcarrier spacing 
values at least as large as the LTE one, i.e., 𝑎 ≥ 𝑏  with 
reference to (2), and identify options which do not exceed a 
double overhead with respect to LTE, i.e., CP overhead lower 
than 13.33%. We consider here a CP ranging between 3.7 µs 
and 4.3 µs.  
Fig. 3 displays a scatter plot of the CP overhead and 
subcarrier spacing combinations for the configurations 
identified according to the above criteria. For both TTI 
durations, the identified configurations are spanning a set of 
segments localized over different subcarrier spacing values 
corresponding to different number of time symbols in the TTI. 
Configurations for CP duration ~3.7-4.3 µs are distributed 
over a larger number of segments due to the more relaxed 
requirements. Each segment refers to the configurations 
obtained within the range 1.8-2.3 µs/3.7-4.3 µs for a specific 
number of time symbols per TTI, and spans a CP overhead 
increase of up to 2% for subcarrier spacing variations not 
larger than 300 Hz.   
 
Figure 3. CP overhead for the identified configurations. 
B. 
Design for ZT DFT-s-OFDM 
In this case, the ZT duration is not hardcoded in the system 
numerology, since it is part of the time symbol itself rather 
than being appended to it. This leads to a further constraint on 
the selection of the 𝑎 and 𝑏 parameters in (2); the subcarrier 
spacing is indeed feasible in case 𝑁𝑠𝑦𝑚 =
𝑎
𝑏 ∆𝑓5𝐺 𝑇𝑇𝐼5𝐺 is an 
integer number. In order to ensure a fair comparison with 
OFDM, we consider a ZT duration equal to 2 µs and 4 µs 
when computing the overhead and the number of resource 
elements per ms. The ZT overhead is given by (𝑁𝑠𝑦𝑚𝑇𝑍𝑇)/
𝑇𝑇𝑇𝐼, while the number of resource elements per ms is given 
by 
 
                  𝑁𝑅𝐸 = ⌈𝐵 (
1
∆𝑓5𝐺 − 𝑇𝑍𝑇) 𝑁𝑠𝑦𝑚
𝑇𝑇𝐼𝐿𝑇𝐸
𝑇𝑇𝐼5𝐺 ⌉                   (5) 
where 𝑇𝑍𝑇 denotes the ZT duration. Similarly to the OFDM 
case, the combinations coping with the above requirements are 
identified. 
C. 
Numerology examples 
Table I reports the most promising examples of the 
identified configurations for OFDM. The LTE case is also 
included for the sake of comparison. The configurations for a 
0.2 ms TTI duration and CP duration of around ~ 2 µs feature 
same (or higher) number of resource elements per ms of LTE, 
while having a large subcarrier spacing. In the case of CP 
duration of around ~4 µs, two configurations per each TTI 
duration are reported. Configurations I.C and I.G feature a 
large subcarrier spacing at the expense of a larger CP 
overhead. Note that a large CP overhead translates to a lower 
number of resource elements per ms with respect to LTE. On 
the contrary, configurations I.D and I.H preserve the overhead

requirements at the expense of a lower robustness to hardware 
impairments. In case such configurations are used, phase noise 
estimation and correction algorithms need then to be 
implemented at the receiver to cope with the potential 
performance degradation at high carrier frequencies. Note that 
the configuration with the largest subcarrier spacing (I.E) also 
leads to the highest number of symbols per TTI.  
Examples for ZT DFT-s-OFDM are reported in Table II. 
Recall that the ZT duration has no impact on the number of 
time symbols and subcarrier spacing.  Configuration II.A is 
obtained by simply doubling the LTE subcarrier spacing, and 
in the case of a ZT duration of ~2 µs it leads to a larger 
number of resource elements per ms than LTE. Configuration 
II.B features the same TTI structure as II.A but a ZT duration 
of 4 µs is here considered, with a double overhead. 
Configuration II.C represents a tradeoff between the previous 
options.  A similar behavior is visible in configurations II.D 
and II.E, having however a larger overhead due to the higher 
number of symbols. Configuration II.F is again a tradeoff 
between the two previous proposals. 
The most promising options from Table I and Table II are 
reported in Table III along with the number of subcarriers and 
FFT size parameters. This is meant to show how our candidate 
numerologies support a scalable bandwidth, as targeted by 5G. 
For the CP ~4 µs case, we only included options having at 
least 
double 
subcarrier 
spacing 
than 
LTE; 
our 
recommendation is here to accept extra overhead but to 
maintain robustness to the hardware impairments.  Note that in 
the case of ZT DFT-s-OFDM, we are here referring to virtual 
subcarriers rather than the frequency subcarriers, i.e., to the 
non-zero pre-DFT samples (see Fig. 1). For a 20 MHz 
bandwidth, all the configurations feature an FFT size of 1024, 
thus lower than the LTE one; this is a consequence of the 
larger subcarrier spacing. In LTE, transmission over larger 
bands (40 MHz, 100 MHz) is obtained by carrier aggregation 
[2]; multiple 20 MHz spectrum chunks can be then processed 
independently. For the identified 5G configurations, we have 
reported the cases of an unique FFT covering the entire 
spectrum. This corresponds to the case of a contiguous 
bandwidth allocation. Note that due to the larger subcarrier 
spacing, the proposed 5G numerology can achieve a 100 MHz 
carrier bandwidth with an FFT size of only 4096 – only twice 
the FFT size for an LTE 20 MHz carrier.

OPEN ISSUES 
Current radio access technologies based on OFDM 
modulation have set an unique subcarrier spacing definition in 
their numerology. The design described above also subsumes 
the usage of the same subcarrier spacing for all the envisioned 
applications and services.  
The option of relaxing the constraint of uniqueness of 
subcarrier spacing has been discussed in the recent 5G 
literature (e.g.,[14]). Using very large subcarrier spacing leads 
to very short time symbols and thus ultra-short TTIs and

RTTs, with obvious benefits for services targeting ultra-low 
latency (e.g., MCC). The corresponding large overhead, e.g., 
of the CP and control channels, is indeed secondary for such 
services. Moreover, power-limited MMC devices targeting 
sporadic transmissions of small data packets may also benefit 
from the usage of ultra-short symbols. A large subcarrier 
spacing leads indeed to a low number of subcarriers per time 
symbol. This can be shown to reduce the PAPR of the transmit 
signals with remarkable benefits in terms of power efficiency. 
Finally, the benefits of a large subcarrier spacing at high 
speed are twofold: they improve the robustness to the Doppler 
spread as well as the quality of the channel estimation. The 
latter advantage is due to the fact that shorter time symbols 
increase the time correlation of the channel estimates in case 
of pilot patterns scattered between adjacent time symbols. 
In that respect, traditional MBB users with low speed would 
benefit by the low overhead guaranteed by relatively short 
subcarrier spacing, while MTC and high speed users may 
adopt a larger subcarrier spacing to guarantee the quality of 
the communication at the expenses of a data rate reduction. 
Nevertheless, the 1 ms latency target set by the ITU copes 
with envisioned applications such as automation control and 
tactile Internet, and can be achieved by using the TTI 
durations of 0.2 ms and 0.25 ms, as presented above. This 
reduces the necessity of striving towards further shorter TTI 
durations.  
The other mentioned benefits of the usage of different 
subcarrier spacing are however in our view still valid. 
Nonetheless, accommodating users with different subcarrier 
spacing sizes over adjacent bands may significantly affect 
their performance in case an OFDM modulation is used. This 
is because the different symbol duration necessarily makes 
such signals asynchronous, and OFDM suffers from 
significant out-of-band emissions in case of asynchronous 
transmission. In [4], the usage of GFDM is justified for 
improving 
the 
coexistence 
of 
asynchronous 
devices 
transmitting over neighbor bands due to the better spectral 
containment property of this waveform. We believe that our 
proposed ZT DFT-s-OFDM modulation is also a promising 
solution for that purpose since it improves the spectral 
containment with respect to OFDM [7].  
Nonetheless, it is still under discussion whether the 
envisioned benefits of exploiting subcarrier spacing size as an 
extra degree of freedom justify the additional system 
complexity which is necessary to deal with it.

CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we have addressed the design of a radio 
numerology for a 5G wide area concept operating at below 6 
GHz carriers. The main requirements have been identified, 
namely low latency and overhead, common clock with LTE, 
robustness to hardware impairments and similar number of 
resource elements as LTE. The design assumptions have been 
derived accordingly considering OFDM and ZT DFT-s-
OFDM waveforms. For a CP/ZT of around 2 µs, numerologies 
coping with all the requirements have been presented. For a 
longer CP/ZT, we recommend to prioritize the robustness to 
the hardware impairments: the candidate configurations 
feature then a large subcarrier spacing at the expense of an 
overhead increase. The proposed 5G numerology only requires 
an FFT size of 4096 to form a 100 MHz carrier bandwidth.  
Future work will address pros and cons of the usage of 
different subcarrier spacing sizes in the frame structure.
