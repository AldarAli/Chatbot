Abstract—In this paper, we present a Quality-of-Service (QoS)-
aware interference control scheme in femtocell networks. The 
proposed scheme dynamically adjusts the transmission power of 
Home Evolved Node B (HeNB) based on its “troubling” property 
and “servicing” property so as to balance the provisioning of QoS 
for users and the avoidance of interference to neighboring HeNBs. 
The simulation results illustrate that our approach can effectively 
improve the efficiency of resource utilization and aggregate 
throughput of the femtocell networks in comparison with other 
schemes.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The Long Term Evolution (LTE) access technologies 
developed by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) 
group [1][2] are promising Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) 
solutions of providing high data-rate transmissions, extensive-area 
coverage, and high-speed mobility for a variety of wireless 
applications. However, with the growing number of mobile 
devices and various application demands, the traffic congestion 
problem will still be inevitable due to limited frequency 
spectrums even with the BWA technology. Frequency reuse 
might be the most suitable solution to increase the total capacity 
of an area. Moreover, once mobile users enter into a building, the 
radio signal strength can drop tremendously due to a large path 
loss especially when the building is made up of the concrete and 
steel. Therefore, Home Evolved Node B (HeNB), also called 
femtocell is expected to prevail in the LTE networks in the future 
because of certain large amounts of indoor users and further for 
its capability to solve the problem of spectrum insufficiency by 
frequency reuse. 
In femtocell networks, the interference problem can be severe 
if no proper power control or resource management scheme is 
presented. As a matter of fact, the interferences in femtocell 
networks can be classified as cross-tiered and co-tiered 
interferences. When the macrocell and femtocell have an overlap 
area and use both the same frequency spectrum and time slot for 
data deliveries, the cross-tiered interference would be incurred. 
On the other hand, if a number of HeNBs are deployed close to 
each other, the interference between neighboring HeNBs is so 
called the co-tiered interference [3]-[10]. 
In this paper, we tackle the co-tiered interference problem 
between neighboring HeNBs in the LTE networks and propose 
simple and practical interference control and resource allocation 
schemes in a distributed manner. The proposed scheme 
dynamically adjusts the power of HeNBs according to its 
“troubling” property and “servicing” property to simultaneously 
reduce the interference to neighboring HeNBs and improve the 
overall transmission efficiency of the femtocell networks. Our key 
idea is based on the observation that each HeNB simultaneously 
acts as a “servicing node” for data deliveries to the associated 
users, and acts as a “troubling node” with respect to the 
neighboring HeNBs. Thus the power control of each HeNB 
should simultaneously consider the two roles so as to improve its 
individual transmission efficiency, as well as to lessen the 
interference in femtocell networks. We conducted simulations to 
compare the performance of our proposed power control 
algorithm with that of other approaches. The results demonstrate 
that our approach can effectively improve the efficiency of 
resource utilization and aggregate throughput of the femtocell 
networks in comparison with other schemes. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
introduces the existing studies of interference mitigation in 
wireless networks. The problem description is presented in 
Section 3. Section 4 illustrates the proposed power control 
algorithms. Section 5 explains the simulation setup and results. 
Finally, the conclusion is given in Section 6. 
II. RELATED WORK 
There have been many efforts on the mitigation of 
interferences and/or the cooperation of resource allocation in 
previous studies [4]-[10]. Sun et al. [4] proposed a subcarrier 
allocation scheme based on the auction algorithm for solving the 
cross-tiered interference between macrocells and femtocells. 
Hoteit et al. [7] proposed a game-theoretic resource allocation 
scheme in cooperative femtocell OFDMA networks. From the 
evaluation results, it is shown that their proposed game-theoretic 
scheme outperforms other proposals in terms of throughput, 
fairness, and computation time. The studies in [8] proposed a 
cognitive-radio based scheme which uses cognitive relays to 
improve the cross-tier interference performance between 
macrocells and femtocells. However, these centralized schemes 
can be complex and unpractical. When the femtocell networks are 
expected to deployed in indoor environments such as home and 
enterprise buildings, it is hard to adopt a centralized management 
scheme for resource allocation or power control because the 
femtocell management system will maintain a growing data base 
for global interference information with the growth of femtocell 
deployment, and the computational complexity will dramatically 
increase and remain a challenge issue.

III. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION 
To solve the optimization problems of interference control and 
resource allocation, we model the service and interference 
scenarios in the downlink of femtocell networks as a graph 𝑮𝑮 =
(𝑽𝑽, 𝑬𝑬), where V is the set of vertices and E is the set of edges. 
Figure 1 shows an example of the modeled graph. There are two 
types of vertices, namely, the HeNB and UE vertices. The HeNB 
vertex is connected with two kinds of edges including Service 
Edges (SE) and Interference Edges (IE), which represent the 
connection with the served users and interfered neighboring 
femtocells, respectively. For HeNB Hi, let Si denote the set of 
served users and |𝑺𝑺𝒊𝒊| is the number of served users; let Ii denote 
the set of interfered neighboring femtocells and |𝑰𝑰𝒊𝒊| is the number 
of interfered femtocells. In the downlink transmission scenario, Ii 
consists of the femtocells which have users being interfered by 
HeNB Hi. Thus, if 𝐻𝐻𝑗𝑗 ∈ 𝑰𝑰𝒊𝒊, we have 
𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅൫𝐻𝐻𝑗𝑗, 𝑈𝑈𝑘𝑘൯
𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖, 𝑈𝑈𝑘𝑘) < 𝑅𝑅𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡ℎ,𝑈𝑈𝑘𝑘 ∈ 𝑺𝑺𝒋𝒋, 
(1) 
where 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖,𝑈𝑈ℎ) denotes the Received Signal Strength (RSS) 
of UE Uh from the serving HeNB Hi; 𝑅𝑅𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡ℎ is the threshold of 
Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) for data 
transmission. 
For HeNB Hi, let 𝑅𝑅𝑆𝑆𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖,𝑈𝑈ℎ, 𝑈𝑈ℎ ∈ 𝑺𝑺𝒊𝒊 denotes the weight edge 
between HeNB Hi and user Uh, representing the degree of service 
for Uk given by Hi. In this paper, we adopt the QoS class 
identifiers (QCIs) specified in 3GPP [2] to quantify the service 
degree 𝑅𝑅𝑆𝑆𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖,𝑈𝑈ℎ, 𝑈𝑈ℎ ∈ 𝑺𝑺𝒊𝒊 . As Table I shows, each QCI is 
associated with a specific resource type, priority and packet delay 
budget. Denote QCI𝑥𝑥  as the QCI with index x. Let QCIGBR 
denote the set of GBR-type QCIs and QCINon-GBR denote the set 
of Non-GBR-type QCIs. It is shown in Table I that QCIGBR 
consists of QCI1, QCI2, QCI3,  and QCI4, while QCINon-GBR 
consists of QCI5, QCI6, QCI7,QCI8, and QCI9. 
To reflect the service degree according to the priority of QCI, 
we define the weight of QCI𝑥𝑥 , 𝑤𝑤QCI𝑥𝑥  as 10 - 𝑝𝑝QCI𝑥𝑥 , where 
𝑝𝑝QCI𝑥𝑥  is the priority of QCI𝑥𝑥 . Thus, we have 𝑤𝑤QCI1 =  8 , 
 𝑤𝑤QCI2 = 6, 𝑤𝑤QCI3 = 7, 𝑤𝑤QCI4 = 5, 𝑤𝑤QCI5 =  9, 𝑤𝑤QCI6 =  4, 
𝑤𝑤QCI7 = 3, 𝑤𝑤QCI8 = 2, 𝑤𝑤QCI9 = 1, respectively. Assume the 
service type of 𝑈𝑈ℎ, 𝑈𝑈ℎ ∈ 𝑺𝑺𝒊𝒊 is with QCI𝑥𝑥, then 𝑅𝑅𝑆𝑆𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖,𝑈𝑈ℎ can be 
expressed as 
𝑅𝑅𝑆𝑆𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖,𝑈𝑈ℎ = 𝑤𝑤QCI𝑥𝑥, 𝑈𝑈ℎ ∈ 𝑺𝑺𝒊𝒊. 
(2) 
Based on the LTE standards [2], Resource Block (RB) is the 
smallest transmission unit in the LTE system, which consists of 2 
time slots (1 ms) in time domain and 12 sub-carriers (180 KHz) 
in frequency domain. Consider an interference femtocell network 
consisting of K HeNBs, which share F RBs in downlink 
transmissions. For femtocell i, let 𝜎𝜎𝑖𝑖
𝑓𝑓, f = 1, 2, …. F, denote a 
binary variable which is 1 if RB f is allocated to femtocell i, and 
0 otherwise. For RB f, the PHY data rate 𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓 can be expressed as 
[11], 
𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓 =
𝑅𝑅𝑓𝑓
(𝑐𝑐) log2(𝑀𝑀𝑓𝑓)
𝑇𝑇𝑠𝑠𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅
𝐷𝐷𝑅𝑅𝐷𝐷𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅, 
(3) 
where 𝑅𝑅𝑓𝑓
(𝑐𝑐) is the code rate associated with the Modulation and 
Coding Scheme (MCS) used by RB f; Mf is the constellation size 
of the MCS used by RB f; Ts is the OFDM symbol duration; NRB 
is the number OFDM symbols in a RB, which can be 14 or 12 
depending on whether a normal or extended cyclic prefix is used; 
DSCRB is the number of data-carrying subcarriers for a RB. 
Define the RB allocation problem as a constrained 
optimization problem which aims to maximize the overall 
spectrum efficiency of femtocell networks. The optimization 
problem can be formulated as follows: 
max ෍

where 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 is the transmission power of HeNB i; 𝑃𝑃min and 𝑃𝑃max 
are the specific minimum and maximum transmission power of 
LTE femtocell, respectively. 𝛾𝛾𝑈𝑈ℎ is the amount of RBs requested 
by 𝑈𝑈ℎ, and 𝑎𝑎𝑈𝑈ℎ is the amount of allocated RBs. Equation (5) 
shows the constraints of transmission power for femtocells, and 
(6) states that the neighboring femtocells which are in the 
interference domain cannot use the same bands for data 
transmissions. Equation (7) expresses that the amount of allocated 
RBs is guaranteed for GBR-type users, whereas (8) expresses that 
there is no guarantee for Non-GBR-type users [5]. Equation (9) 
indicates that the RBs allocated to a femtocell are shared by its 
served users for data transmission. 
IV. PROPOSED POWER CONTROL ALGORITHM 
To illustrate the key idea of our power control and resource 
allocation scheme, consider the example shown in Figure 2. H1 
has three users which request 7 RBs totally; H2 has two users 
which request 6 RBs; H3 has two users which request 4 RBs; H4 
has two users which request 8 RBs. The number of the total 
required RBs for the four HeNBs is 25. H1 is regarded as a 
“troubling node” for its largest amount of interferences over the 
considered femtocell network (the number of the interference 
edges of H1, H2, H3 and H4 is 3, 2, 2, and 1, respectively). If we 
allocate all the required RBs for H1 without adjusting its power, 
the number of the total allocated RBs in the femtocell network is 
13, and there are 12 RBs unable to be allocated for H2, H3 and H4 
(3 RBs with H2, 4 RBs with H3 and 5 RBs with H4). The frequency 
reuse efficiency is only 30%. In this example, if the transmission 
power of H1 is decreased to a certain level, the overall 
transmission efficiency can therefore be improved. For instance, 
consider another situation when the transmission power of H1 is 
lessened such that H1 has only 2 interference edges, as shown in 
Figure 3. Hence, the number of the total allocated RBs increases 
as 20 (7 RBs for H1, 6 RBs for H2, 4 RBs for H3 and 3 RBs for H4) 
and the frequency reuse efficiency becomes as large as 100%. The 
example illustrates that a power restriction on the “troubling node” 
can provide improvements of the overall transmission efficiency 
in the femtocell network. 
Consider K HeNBs in a femtocell network. For HeNB i, let 
𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖 denote the amount of RBs requested by its served users. 𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖 
can be expressed as: 
𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖 = ෍ 𝛾𝛾𝑈𝑈ℎ

where 𝛾𝛾𝑈𝑈ℎ is the amount of RBs requested by 𝑈𝑈ℎ. We assume 
that the co-channel aware scheme is used for RB allocation, i.e., 
the HeNBs in the interference domain will select different RBs as 
possible. Assume 𝜽𝜽𝑖𝑖 is the set of RBs assigned for HeNB i by 
the co-channel aware assignment, and |𝜽𝜽𝒊𝒊| is the number of RBs 
assigned for HeNB i. |𝜽𝜽𝒊𝒊| can be expressed as: 
|𝜽𝜽𝒊𝒊| = ෍ 𝑎𝑎𝑈𝑈ℎ
𝑈𝑈ℎ∈𝑺𝑺𝒊𝒊
, 
(11) 
where 𝑎𝑎𝑈𝑈ℎ is the amount of RBs allocated to user 𝑈𝑈ℎ stated in 
(7) and (8) for GBR and Non-GBR users, respectively. According 
to the constraints stated in (7) and (8), we have 
|𝜽𝜽𝒊𝒊|max = ෍ 𝛾𝛾𝑈𝑈ℎ

the network capacity is insufficient to support the total service 
requirements of users due to interferences between HeNBs. In this 
case, we argue that the power level of troubling nodes should be 
decreased to improve the RB reuse efficiency. However, a trouble 
node also acts as a service node with respect to its users. Thus, we 
propose an adaptive power control algorithm which dynamically 
adjusts the power of HeNB according to both the interference 
factors and service factors. The interference factor of HeNB i is 
expressed as |𝑰𝑰𝒊𝒊| which is the number of interfered femtocells. 
The service factor of HeNB i, 𝜓𝜓𝑖𝑖 can be expressed as 
𝜓𝜓𝑖𝑖 = ෍ 𝑅𝑅𝑆𝑆𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖,𝑈𝑈ℎ ∙ 𝛾𝛾𝑈𝑈ℎ
𝑈𝑈ℎ∈𝑺𝑺𝒊𝒊
 
(16) 
where 𝑅𝑅𝑆𝑆𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖,𝑈𝑈ℎ denotes the degree of service for 𝑈𝑈ℎ by 𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖 in 
terms of the QCI weight, which is illustrated in (2). The feasible 
transmission power of HeNB should be determined by both the 
interference factor |𝑰𝑰𝒊𝒊| and service factor 𝜓𝜓𝑖𝑖. For example, when 
|𝑰𝑰𝒊𝒊|  is large, we should decrease the power to lessen the 
interference to the neighboring HeNBs. On the other hand, when 
𝜓𝜓𝑖𝑖  is large, we should increase the power to provide service 
qualities for users. Thus, we define a power tuning parameter, 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖, 
which is the ratio of |𝑰𝑰𝒊𝒊| to 𝜓𝜓𝑖𝑖. That is, 
𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 =
|𝑰𝑰𝒊𝒊|
𝜓𝜓𝑖𝑖
. 
(17) 
When 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 is large, we should decrease the power to lessen the 
interference to the neighboring HeNBs; on the other hand, when 
𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖  is small, we should increase the power to improve service 
qualities for users. In case that the network resource is insufficient 
to support the total service requirements of users due to severe 
interferences, the power level of HeNBs with the largest 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 
should be decreased by multiplication with a factor b (0 <  𝑏𝑏 <
 1), That is, 
𝑖𝑖∗ = arg max
1 ≤𝑖𝑖≤𝐾𝐾 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 
(18) 
𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖∗ = max(𝑏𝑏 ∙ 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖∗, 𝑃𝑃min). 
(19) 
Equation (19) states that the adjusted power cannot be lower than 
the specific minimum value 𝑃𝑃min. 
After the power of the trouble node is adjusted, the new 
assignment of RBs by the co-channel aware scheme, ( 𝜽𝜽1
′ ,
𝜽𝜽2
′ , …. 𝜽𝜽𝐾𝐾
′ ), can therefore be obtained. The pseudo code of the 
proposed QoS-aware Power Control (QAPC) is shown in Figure 
4. The power control algorithm will be iteratively executed until 
the network resource is sufficient to support the total amount of 
RBs allocated for users, or the adjusted power is lower than the 
specific minimum value 𝑃𝑃min. 
V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION AND DISCUSSION 
In this section, we conduct simulation scenarios of the 
downlink transmissions in the LTE femtocell network to 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed power control 
scheme. The simulation is constructed by the C++ programming 
and followed the LTE standard closely [2]. The LTE PHY 
parameters and their values are listed in Table II. The simulation 
setup assumes a 100 m ∗ 100 m square area where the HeNBs are 
randomly deployed. We assume that the occurrence of each QCI 
is uniform, while the resource request process is Poisson with a 
constant size of 1000 bytes. The total simulation period is 120 
seconds while the results are provided with the average values 
over 20 times of simulations. We compare the performance of the 
proposed power control algorithm with that of fixed power and 
distributed power control algorithms presented by ElBatt and 
Ephremides [12]. For all these power control approaches, the co-
channel assignment scheme is used for resource allocation (i.e., 
the assignment of RBs will prevent interference as well as 
possible) to clearly examine the achieved performances with

different power control schemes. The performance metrics are 
indexed as the efficiency of RB utilization and average 
throughput. 
First, we examine the efficiency of RB utilization with 
different power control schemes. It is shown in Figure 5 that the 
proposed CA scheme has the best performance in terms of RB 
efficiency in the two cases. In the 3-femtocell scenario, our 
proposed scheme can increase the RB efficiency by 45.33% and 
102.35% in comparison with the distributed power control 
scheme and fixed power scheme, respectively. In the 6-femtocell 
scenario, our proposed scheme can even increase the RB 
efficiency by 45.01% and 105.47% with regard to the two 
schemes, respectively. Figure 6 shows the corresponding 
throughput performances with different power control schemes. 
As a result shown in Figure 6, our power control scheme 
averagely can increase the throughput by as large as 45.41% and 
102.35% over the distributed power control and fixed power 
schemes, respectively, in the 3-femtocell scenario, and by 44.81% 
and 107.84%, respectively, in the 6-femtocell scenario. The 
simulation results demonstrate that our power control scheme 
which adjusts the transmitting power of troubling nodes to lessen 
interferences to neighboring femtocells can improve the RB 
utilization efficiency and overall system throughput in the LTE 
femtocell network. 
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This study tackled the interference problems in femtocell and 
present an interference control scheme. The proposed scheme 
dynamically adjusts the transmission power of HeNB based on its 
“troubling” property and “servicing” property so as to balance the 
provisioning of QoS for users and the avoidance of interference 
to neighboring HeNBs. We conducted simulations to compare the 
performance of our proposed scheme with that of other 
approaches. The results illustrate that our approach can 
effectively improve the efficiency of resource utilization and 
system throughput of the LTE femtocell networks. Our future 
research will investigate the joint optimization problem with the 
proposed power control algorithm and Discontinuous Reception 
(DRX) mechanism for energy-efficiency and QoS performances 
field testing.
