Abstract—Recently, ISO MPEG has developed a new 
media transport technology called MPEG Media Transport 
(MMT) protocol for the next generation hybrid video delivery 
services over IP networks. In this paper, we propose an efficient 
estimation of network jitter using delivery instant parameter of 
MPEG MMT protocol. 
 
Keywords-MPEG MMT; jitter estimation; video delivery 
over IP networks. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
ISO MPEG developed the MPEG-H standard suite 
(ISO/IEC 23008) for the delivery of audio-visual information 
compressed with high efficiency over a heterogeneous 
environment. The MPEG-H suite consists of three functional 
areas: High-Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), 3D audio, 
and MPEG Media Transport (MMT) [1].  
Maintaining timing relationships among packets in a 
single media stream or between packets from different media 
streams is an essential role of MMT. It is the function of the 
synchronization and de-jittering algorithms to re-adjust 
timing relationship between the MMT packets to assure 
synchronized playback [2]. Thus, delivery of time 
constrained MPEG media on time, according to their 
temporal requirements, is an important goal of MMT. For 
this purpose, MMT provides delivery instant parameter in its 
packet header to specify syntax and semantics of a timing 
model to be used by the delivery functions [3]. By using the 
delivery instant parameter, it is possible to estimate end-to-
end transmission delay or network jitter. The total end-to-end 
delay should be kept constant for continuous decoding and 
playback at the receiver.  
In this paper, we propose an efficient method to estimate 
the network jitter for predicting constant end-to-end delay 
and estimating appropriate buffering time using delivery 
instant parameter of MPEG MMT protocol.  
The organization of this paper is as follows. In Section II, 
we describe conventional network jitter estimation method. 
Section III describes the proposed network jitter estimation 
method using MMT protocol. Concluding remarks and 
future works are given in Section IV. 
 
II. CONVENTIONAL NETWORK JITTER ESTIMATION 
METHOD 
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) provides 
timestamps, such as Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) 
timestamp [4], and Network Time Protocol (NTP) 
timestamp. Each RTP packet carries a 32 bits timestamp 
which reflects the sampling instant of the first byte in the 
data packet. For MPEG payloads, the sampling instant is 
derived from a 90 KHz clock. Besides RTP timestamps, an 
NTP timestamp is also transported in the RTCP Ssender 
Report (SR) packet.  
 
 
Figure 1.  Media sampling instant used as an RTP timestamp in RTP 
packetization. 
Figure 1 shows a media sampling instant used as an RTP 
timestamp in RTP packetization. As shown in Figure 1, if 
RTP packets are generated periodically, the nominal 
sampling instant as determined from the sampling clock is 
used as an RTP timestamp, not a reading of the system 
clock. In RTP, the inter-arrival jitter is defined to be the 
mean deviation of the difference in the packet spacing at the 
receiver compared to the sender for a pair of packets. In 
IETF RFC 3550 standard, the following method is used to 
estimate network transmission jitter. If Si  is the RTP 
timestamp from packet i, and Ri is the time of arrival in RTP 
timestamp units for packet i, then for two packets i and j, the 
difference in packet spacing at the receiver is expressed as

The inter-arrival jitter is calculated continuously as each 
data packet i is received according to the following  formula

Because the jitter calculation shown in (2) is based on 
the RTP timestamp, any variation in the delay between the 
sampling instant and the time the packet is actually 
transmitted will affect the resulting jitter that is calculated. 
Such a variation in delay would occur for video encodings 
because the timestamp is the same for all the packets of one 
video frame but those packets are not all transmitted at the 
same time. Thus, the variation in delay until transmission 
could reduce the accuracy of the jitter calculation as a 
measure of the behavior of the network by itself. 
 
III. 
PROPOSED NETWORK JITTER ESTIMATION METHOD 
USING MMT PROTOCOL 
Preservation of timing relationships among packets in a 
single MMTP packet flow or between packets from 
different MMTP packet flows is an important feature of 
MMT. In the conventional method, if the time gap between 
the sampling instant and the transmission instant could be 
always kept as a constant, there would be no problem in the 
accuracy of the calculated jitter. However, the problem 
could occur in transmitting a video frame with huge 
resolution, such as 4K/8K UHD video, as an example.  
 
 
Figure 2.  A video frame of huge resolution is fragmented into three 
different delivery packets, each with different delivery time. 
 
Due to its big size of 4K/8K UHD video frame, the 
compressed bitstream may need to be fragmented into 
several delivery packets before transmission as shown in 
Figure 2. 
Although the three fragmented packets are originated 
from the same video frame with the same sampling instant, 
they are transmitted at different delivery time due to 
additional application layer processing such as Applicatoin 
Layer Forward Error Correction (AL-FEC) and Interleaving. 
Thus, by assigning the delivery instants to MMT packets as 
shown in Figure 3, we would be able to achieve accurate 
estimation of inter-arrival jitter in MMT service. Instead of 
using (1), we can employ the following equation to obtain 
the difference in packet spacing for two MMT packets i and j 
at the receiver:

The proposed algorithm described in Section III has 
been included in the International Standard document of 
MMT [5]. We will focus our attention on the test and 
implementation of the proposed algoirhtm using MMT 
protocol to verify the performance of the proposed network 
jitter estimation method in a real video delivery 
environments over IP networks. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we proposed an efficient method to 
achieve accurate estimation of inter-arrival jitter using 
delivery instant parameter of MPEG MMT at the receiver 
side. To achieve the accurate estimation of network jitter, 
the sender side needs to transmit delivery instant 
information based on the MMT timing model to the receiver 
side. As our future work, we are going to verify the
