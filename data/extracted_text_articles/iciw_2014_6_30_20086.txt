Abstract—Understanding
the
characteristics
of
message
spreading
over
online
social
network
is
important
for
estimating the influence of message initiated from arbitrary
users.
Past
researches
present
some
models,
such
as
independent cascade model and linear threshold model, to
explain the message spreading. Recent studies show many
variations of previous models focused on different issues. In
this paper, we focus on multiple channels that are used for
communicating with each other, and multiple groups that react
differently to the message coming from each channel, in order
to observe a more detailed aspect of message spreading, such
as
spreading
speed
or
chances
to
accept
the
message.
Considering these properties, we propose a new message
spreading model that has multiple member groups and
multiple channels. We examine the impact of channel and
group
preference
in
message
spreading
by
conducting
extensive simulations of our suggested model. Through the
simulations, we observed that considering multiple channels
and multiple groups explains the speed and the coverage of
message spreading in more detail.

INTRODUCTION
Observing information diffusion has always been an
interesting research area, and, thanks to the Internet, there are
more
researches
coming
out,
which
are
related
to
maximizing the effect of viral marketing [1][2][5], or social
influence in Social Network Services [3]. To understand the
message spreading in social networks, many models have
been suggested and some of them are frequently discussed
[1]. Based on each model, many related researches have been
done which focus on different aspects of social network such
as finding the source of information [6], or finding effective
way to spread information [1][2][4]. Also, there are newly
suggested models for different attributes and goals [7][8].
We focus on the means which people use in the social
network to communicate with others.
With the help of technologies developed recently, the
number of ways which people use to communicate with each
other is increasing. We call these ways to communicate as
channels. Since members of social networks have many
choices to send messages, we need to consider the properties
of channels to study about message spreading speed. For the
cases that require urgent message delivery, like accident or
disaster aware services, not only coverage, but also speed of
message spreading is an important property. Considering
speed, every channel has its own unique properties, such as
time it takes to send message or time it takes until receiver
checks the message. Texting and phone calls can be
examples. Since texting requires typing and cannot be sure
whether the receiver checks the message instantly, it has
longer time expectation compared to phone call which makes
the receiver react instantly. For the message that has time
constraints, or to observe the speed of message spreading,
considering these properties is needed to properly estimate
the diffusion.
While considering channels, we find one more thing to
think about, namely, the preference of channel. Channel
preference can be different from one user to another.
According to this, considering each individual user for
applying
channel
preference
is
encouraged, but
it
is
practically impossible. As an alternative, we considered a
user group that shares similar properties, such as age, income
and
professions,
and
the
user
group
explains
the
characteristics and the preference of channels.
After grouping members in network, their common
behavior can be considered. Focused on message spreading,
we considered what channels they prefer when sending
messages, and from what channel they accept the message
and resend to others. As an example, teenagers will prefer
using
Short
Message
Service
(SMS)
[12]
or
instant
messenger to send messages and may have higher chance to
accept
messages
through
these
channels
compared
to
messages from other channels. When communicating with
same groups, this is not an issue. But, when communicating
with members in other groups, this can bring a different
aspect of diffusion due to their different preference of
channels.
In this paper, we propose a new message spreading
model which considers the properties discussed above such
as multiple channels and multiple groups. In this model, a
member who receives the message reacts differently by
which channel the sender used and which group the member
belongs.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In Section
2, related works of message spreading are explored, such as
linear threshold model and independent cascade model.
Section 3 describes the structure of our proposed model and
how this model works related to real situations. In Section 4,

we evaluate our model with the real-world social network
data, and we conclude in Section 5.
II.
RELATED WORKS
There are many models that explain how the information
diffusion happens in social networks and two famous models
are independent cascade model and linear threshold model.
Each model shows a different aspect of influence.
A. Linear Threshold Model
Linear Threshold (LT) Model [1] describes the activation
of a node as following the neighbors’ major opinion or
behavior. In this model, a social network is modeled as
directed graph G = (V, E) , where the vertices of V
represents individuals in the network and edges in E
represents relationships and direction of an edge shows who
is influenced by whom. Every node v in G is in state of either
active or inactive and can only be activated once. Also, node
v chooses a random threshold θv that has range of [0, 1].
A node v is influenced by each neighbor w according to
the edge weight bv,w such that
෍
ܾ௩,௪
௪ ୬ୣ୧୥୦ୠ୭୰ ୭୤ ௩
 ≤  1
If the total weight of activated neighbors reaches the
threshold θv, the node gets activated and affects other 
inactive nodes. Being affected by neighbor nodes explains
the tendency of adoption of message or product when other
neighbors already adopted it. A man will feel like buying
something if many of his coworkers already have one. Some
researches modified this model to explain product adoption
in social network [5].
B. Independent Cascade Model
LT model expresses the diffusion process well, but does
not fit into our purpose since its main idea lies in tendency of
majority. So, we used the other model that is based on
probability, the Independent Cascade (IC) Model [1]. Fig. 1
illustrates the activation process of the IC model. From the
initial stage of the diffusion process, every node starts with
an inactive state except the nodes in initial node set A0. A
node can only be activated once, and when it is activated, it
has one chance to activate neighbor nodes. In Fig. 1, when
node v becomes active by the node x, it tries to activate each
neighbor node w and y which are in inactive state. By the
chance Pv,w, which is 0.5, v becomes active. If node v fails to
activate node w, node v cannot try to activate node w again.
Once node w is activated, it can no longer be activated again
and stays in activated state. The process continues until there
is no further chance to activate neighbor nodes from each
node. Unlike the LT model, this model describes the
diffusion process as cascading of independent decisions
made by each node. Since a node making own decision
better fits our idea of separating channels and groups, we
modify this model to explain the message spreading over
social network, which considers multiple channels and
multiple groups.
C. Considering Groups in Social Network
Classifying
groups
in
social
networks
has
been
researched in order to improve the performance of services
in social networks, such as language learning [9][10].
III. MESSAGE SPREADING MODEL WITH MULTI-
CAHNNEL MULTI-GROUP
A. Modeling
To consider channel attributes and preferences, we
modify the IC model discussed in Section 2. In our new
model, a node v belongs to one of groups in the network
based on grouping rules, which can be profession, age, or
whatever that member of each group can share same
channel preference. Each user group gi, has distinguishing
channel preference Sij for each channel cj to send messages,
S୫×୬ = ൦
Sଵଵ
Sଵଶ
⋯
Sଵ୬
Sଶଵ
⋮
⋮
⋱
S୫ଵ
⋯
S୫୬
൪
where m is the number of groups and n is the number of
channels. Since a node v must select at least one channel,
∑
ܵ௜௝
୬
௝ୀଵ
= 1. It also has acceptance Aij, the chance to accept
and resend the message that comes through channel cj,
A୫×୬ = ൦
Aଵଵ
Aଵଶ
⋯
Aଵ୬
Aଶଵ
⋮
⋮
⋱
A୫ଵ
⋯
A୫୬
൪
Here, 0 ≤ A୧୨ ≤ 1 , since acceptance of each channel
works independently. A message sent through cj has time
delay dj, which is determined by the channel used for
activation.
Fig. 2 illustrates what happens in the model when a node
v tries to activate its neighbor node w. When the process
starts, node v decides which channel to use from c1 to cn
based on Sij, the channel preference of the user group it
belongs. After the node v chooses channel cj, v tries to
activate a neighbor node w through that channel. After the
time delay dj, the time it takes a message to reach its target,

the neighbor node w determines activation by the acceptance
of the channel cj, Aij. With this individual activation process,
Algorithm 1 in Fig. 3 shows the entire node activation
process.
B. Correspondence between groups
Intra-group communication, which takes place between
members of the same group may differ from that of inter-
group communication. People’s tendency of relying on the
most preferred channel is one of the reasons that change how
people
react
to
information
from
certain
channels.
Considering correspondence between members of the same
group, each member will have higher chance to accept the
information from the channel they prefer most. This leads to
the assumption that people may show higher acceptance to
the information coming from the channel they prefer.
Fig. 4 shows an example of the activation process of the
Multi-Channel Multi-Group (MCMG) model that has three
groups and three channels. Based on the assumption that
intra-group acceptance is strong and people rely on what
they use most, each group shows highest acceptance on the
channel which has highest selection chance. Following the
group channel selection rate in Table 1, member t1 in group
T shows highest usage of instant messaging channel. After
member t1’s attempt to activate inactive member m1, t2, and
o1, each member accepts or ignores the message based on
acceptance chance in Table 1. t2 shows 80% acceptance for
the message through instance messaging channel while m1
shows lower acceptance of 20% for the message from same
channel. Group O as a group of members over age of 70,
shows lower acceptance on email since it is possible that
they cannot check the email at all but they show high
acceptance in classical way of communication such as phone
call. The reaction difference to each channel shows why we
need to consider groups more seriously when we consider
channels.
C. Simplified model of MCMG model
In some of previous researches, simple Independent
Cascade Model that has single channel and single user group

has been used to get the result of experiment due to
calculation time and complex algorithm when considering
complex model. A simplified version of our MCMG model
is needed for those reasons, and for comparing MCMG
model’s
aspect
of
message
spreading
with
simple
Independent Cascade Model. To simplify the model, we
consider simplifying channels into one single channel that
presents all other channels.
C = {cଵ, cଶ, ⋯ , c୬}
C → c
delay D = {dଵ , dଶ, ⋯ , d୬}
D → dୟ୴୰
The average delay of channel becomes delay of the
simple channel. Also, due to the simplifying channels,
preference of channels changes into
S୫×୬ → S୫×ଵ
A୫×୬ → A୫×ଵ
where preference S୫×ଵ and A୫×ଵ has value of average
preference for every channel.
Simplifying
groups
into
one
whole
group
should
consider preferences conversion that fits to one group.
G = {gଵ, gଶ, ⋯ , g୫}
G → g
S୫×୬ → Sଵ×୬
A୫×୬ → Aଵ×୬
where simplified preferences
S୬ = avr{Sଵ୬, Sଶ୬, ⋯ , S୫୬} , and
A୬ = avr{Aଵ୬, Aଶ୬, ⋯ , A୫୬}
show general channel selection and acceptance when group
ratio in the networks are some.
If group ratio is considered,
Rଵ×୫ = [Rଵ
Rଶ
⋯
R୫]
RS୫ୡ୫୥ = Sୱ୧୫୮୪୧୤୧ୣୢ
where R is the group ratio.
This model simplifies all nodes into one group and all
channels into single channel that has general tendency. The
model is used for comparison in evaluation.

Dataset
We use real world graph data set from Slashdot [11] to
simulate our MCMG model. Slashdot is a technology-
related news website known for user-submitted technology
oriented news and it has Slashdot Zoo feature, which allows
users to tag each other as friends or foes. We use this
friend/foe links between users of Slashdot as our dataset
which is obtained in November 2008.
Every node in the graph has its unique ids and randomly
assigned to one of groups based on ratio of the groups. The
first message starts from the fixed initial node.

ACCEPTANCE PROBABILITIES OF GROUPS
We consider 5 groups,
G = {gଵ, gଶ, gଷ, gସ, gହ}
and delays of channel, D, where
D = {80, 150, 300, 450}
to see the variations of channels and groups. Delay
differences between channels show the time differences
caused by sending and receiving. As an example, email
usually has long delay due to their time taken from sending
and checking the message while calling on a
phone has
relatively short delay. We consider 4 channels in this case.
Table 3 and Table 4 show the probabilities of channel
selection and acceptance, respectively. Each group has been
set to have higher chances of acceptance to the channels
they show more selection chances, due to the assumption we
have made in modeling.

Simulatior
We implemented a simulator that examines activation of
nodes per time based on the proposed model. It starts from a
set of initial nodes and tries to activate the neighbor nodes.
When the node is successfully activated, the status of node
changes to activated and the node is stored in priority queue
with time stamp value of current time plus delay of channel
used. When the time reaches the value of time stamp, the
node tries activation of its neighbor node and deleted from
the queue after the process. Time starts from 0 and keeps
increasing until there is nothing in the queue. The result
contains time and total activated nodes at that time.
B. Result
1)
Multiple channels
Fig. 5 shows the coverage of message spreading with 3
different models, as a function of time. “multi-channel
multi-group” represents the proposed model. “multi-channel
single group” represents a simplified model which merges
all groups into a single user group. “single channel single
group” means the simplified model described in section 3.C.
In this evaluation, the percentage of each group is set to
equal, 20%. As shown in Fig. 5, cases using multiple
channels show similar result, the fluent curves. Multiple
choices a node can make brought diversity of time delays
that causes different progress in diffusion. But the case that
has only single channel shows step shaped line due to lag of
variance in delay. Though it has same coverage (the total
number of activated nodes), it shows different speed in the
middle of spreading message.
This can be critical under the circumstances that have
time constraint, or that require intermediate values since
those cases require spreading speed at the certain point of
time. Short period marketing, such as limited sale policy,
can use the proposed model to get proper analysis of effect.
Also, analyzing warning message spreading such disaster-
aware service, which is time sensitive, requires activation
rate at certain point too.
The simplified model (single channel single group) is not
appropriate for observing detailed progress of diffusion. It
might
save
the
calculation
time
to
conduct
message
spreading process and to find the eventual coverage, but it
does not consider the diversity that it can easily miss few
important characteristics of channels. Also as the IC model,
the MCMG model surely follows the concept ‘independent’
since every node decides what channels to use on its own.
2)
Multiple groups
To observe the impact of groups to message spreading,
we tried different user ratio for each groups. Fig. 6 shows
the result of considering group ratio in network. In Fig. 6(a),
group1 is the major group which prefers fastest channel
such as internet phone and SNS instant messaging. In Fig.
Figure 5. Activation progress of MCMG model and simplified model

6(c), major group is group5 which prefers slowest channel
such as SNS posting (not instant messaging). In Fig. 6(b),
major group is group 3 whose preference is in the middle
between group 1 and group 5. In Fig. 6(a), as the percentage
of group 1 increases, the speed of message spreading
increases. On the other hand, in Fig. 6(c), as the percentage
of group 5 increases, the speed of message spreading
decreases. That is, the speed of message spreading depends
on which channel the major group prefers.
Besides the speed of message spreading, there is one
more issue to discuss, the coverage. In Fig. 6(a) and Fig.
6(c), it is observed that the coverage of message spreading
increases as the percentage of major group increases. It is
because that the intra-group acceptance set higher than other
in the current evaluation setting. With the same reason,
when the major group is group 3 which prefers two channels,
the coverage is less than other two cases like Fig. 6(b).
These evaluation results show that the coverage of message
spreading may be highly affected by the ratio of user group
and preferences of groups.
These results lead us believe that considering groups is
an
important
issue
when
those
groups
have
their
distinguishable channel preference. Since online social
network in these days consist of many groups with unique
attributes of their own, examining channels they prefer can
help us to follow complex message spreading in the network.
Also, predicting message spreading without considering
groups can cause an overestimation or underestimation
compared to which considers groups.
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Nowadays, the number of channels people use for
communication is increasing with the fast development of
messenger programs and technology. Google Talk, Skype,
or Face Time can be the examples. These channels have
unique characteristics that should be considered when
observing message spreading over social networks. In
addition, every social networks and groups in the network
have preferred channel of their own and this can make the
relation between channels and groups. The key point is that
each group reacts differently to message sent through each
channels. This affects not only the speed of message
spreading, but also coverage of the message. For that reason,
both channel and group in social network should be
considered to examine message spreading.
In this paper, we proposed a new message spreading
model
over
online
social
network
which
considering
multiple channels and multiple groups. With multiple
channels, we considered delay and preference of channels,
and we found meaningful results from dividing channels.
We expect considering the other properties of channels also
will lead to more detailed/accurate aspect of message
spreading. Likewise, more detailed grouping policy will be
helpful to get various results.
As a natural extension of this work, our future work is
finding relations between channels and groups and applying
them into information diffusion model, which are important
to find more effective ways to spread certain messages over
online social network.
