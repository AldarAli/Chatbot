Abstract—Mental health is crucial to the overall well-being of
individuals, societies, and countries. In addition, personality
traits, emotional responses and behavioral states caused by
acute stress have a significant influence on mental health.
However, correlations among personality traits, emotional
responses, and behavioral states were analyzed only by manual
reports in psychology. This might cause a problem in that data
might not be objective. Therefore, the main purpose of this
paper is to examine whether and how personality traits are
associated with emotional responses and behavioral states
using
physiological
data
from
wearable
devices.
In
experiments, 38 male and female university graduates and
undergraduates volunteered as participants, and each of them
first completed a Big Five Inventory (BFI) questionnaire and
then made a presentation in class, to get personality traits,
emotional responses, and behavioral states, respectively. In the
presentation, three wearable devices were used for emotional
response
data
collection,
including
an
Emotive
Insight
detecting electroencephalogram (EEG) data, a Spire Stone
collecting respiration data and a Huawei Fit Watch to get the
heart
rate
value.
In
detail,
six
attributes
of
emotional
responses: focus, interest, relaxation, engagement, stress and
excitement, and 8 attributes of behavioral states: smile, clench,
blink, surprise, furrow, wink, breath, and heart rate were used
to analyze the personality traits. As a result, correlational
analyses have indicated associations among the personality
traits, emotional responses, and behavioral states.

INTRODUCTION
Mental health is crucial to the overall wellbeing of
individuals, societies, and countries [1]. Body sensors can be
applied
to
better
monitor
individual's
psychological
conditions. In addition, personality traits, which can be
defined as habitual patterns of behavior and thought, have a
significant influence on mental health. Correlation analysis
between mental health and personality traits, using physical
data from wearable sensors, is an interdisciplinary field
spanning computer science and psychology.
In psychology, Penley and Joe [2] have proposed that
there are strong associations among the personality traits,
emotional responses and behavioral states. Unfortunately,
their study was conducted only by analyzing the answers to
specific questions, and thus might not be so objective.
In computer science, several studies have found that
personality traits are related to many factors, such as text,
nonverbal communication, social network, and physical
behaviors. For example, in context detection, IBM has
provided Personality Insights [3], a service that uses
linguistic analytics to infer individuals' intrinsic personality
traits, such as the Big Five model [4]. In addition, Gundogdu
et al. [5] proposed that personality traits are related to social
relationships by analyzing face-to-face interactions. What’s
more, personality traits are associated with physical activity,
speech activity, and face-to-face time, was studied based on
wearable sensors [6]. Besides these, with the development of
sensors,
such
as
EEG
and
Electrocardiogram
(ECG),
computing
emotions
become
possible.
More
recently,
ASCERTAIN [7] recognized personality traits by emotions
using data collected by commercial sensors, like EEG, ECG,
and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), while participants were
watching some affective movie clips. However, this work
did not take a person’s behaviors, such as smile and wink,
into consideration.
Hence, this research aims to find out correlations among
the personality traits, emotional responses and behavioral
states using physiological data from wearable sensors. To the
best of our knowledge, it is the first work to analyze
associations among the three aspects of personality traits,
emotional responses and behavioral states using wearable
sensor
data.
A
modified
personalized
mental
health
framework has been proposed to better monitor individuals’
mental health, which has taken the personality traits into
consideration.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
describes the personalized mental health framework. Section
III explains data collection experimental details, which
includes
descriptions
of
participants,
measurements
of
personality traits, and three wearable devices used for getting
emotional responses and behavioral states. Section IV goes
into correlational analyses among the personality traits, the
emotional
responses,
and
the
behavioral
states.
The
important findings of this study and necessary future work
are depicted in the last section.

PERSONALIZED MENTAL HEALTH FRAMEWORK
For
better
monitoring
individuals’
psychological
conditions,
a
personalized
mental
health
management
framework was designed based on [8], shown in Fig. 1. In
this personalized mental health framework, four layers are
designed to transfer raw sensor data to mental health
statements. In the first layer, raw data are collected from
virtual or real sensors, for example, web browsing histories
and accelerometers embedded in mobile phones. Then, the
second layer aims to detect physiological symptoms, like the
mood [9] and the behavior [8], based on these raw data. In
the third layer, detailed factors are illustrated, which can be
reported to professional doctors. Also, these data can be used
to automatically detect psychological statements. On the
other hand, this layer can be considered as a personal health
log management layer. Finally, according to these factors, a
mental health statement can be diagnosed by doctors or a
mental health system. The key point of this framework is that
personality traits were taken into consideration, which have
an obvious influence on mental health. For example, an
individual might get a stress notification sent by the
traditional mental health system, because of a person’s few
number of activities. But, in case of an indoors loving
person, with low openness value, maybe they enjoy time at
home
without
many
activities.
In
this
situation,
the
traditional system will make a mistake because it did not take
into account the personality traits. It is apparent that
personality traits have associations with each layer, and this
idea is assumed in this paper. Whether and how personality
traits influence each layer is still ongoing study, not only in
psychology but also in computer science. So, in this paper,
we address these problems.

DATA COLLECTION
This section mainly explains data collection experimental
details. It can be divided into four parts, participants to this
study, an approach of measuring personality traits, three
wearable devices, and attributes of emotional responses and
behavioral states.
A.
Participants
This
research
is
composed
of
38
university
undergraduates and graduates. Each of them first completed
a Big Five Inventory (BFI) questionnaire, and then took a
presentation in class. When they were presenting, three
wearable
devices
were
equipped
to
record
emotional
responses and behavioral states.
B.
The Measure of Personality Traits
The Big Five Model describes five personality traits:
Openness (O), Conscientiousness (C), Extroversion (E),
Agreeableness
(A)
and
Neuroticism
(N).
In
detail,
personality traits are measured with a 44-item version of BFI
questionnaire [10] and the range of O is [10, 50], C is [9, 45],
E is [9, 45], A is [9, 45], and N is [8, 40].
C.
Wearable Devices
Three devices are applied into this study. They are
Emotive Insight, Spire Stone, and Huawei Fit watch.
1)
Emotive Insight
Emotive Insight is a 5-channel mobile EEG headset that
records a user’s brainwaves and translates them into
meaningful data. Six attributes of emotional responses,
including focus, interest, relaxation, engagement, stress, and
excitement, were recorded in real time. Each emotion
contains 4 metrics: Min, Max, Raw and RawNorm values. In
detail, Min, Max and Raw value are for scientific research
and might be negative. RawNorm is scaled value deduced
from the Raw, Min, and Max value to be bounded between 0
and 1. Besides emotional responses, this device also can
recognize six attributes of behavioral states: smile, clench,
blink, surprise, furrow and wink (left and right).

2)
Spire Stone
Spire stone is a piece of equipment which supports
continuous respiration sensing and real-time interventions.
Respiration data can be considered as the seventh attribute of
behavioral states.
3)
Huawei Fit Watch
Although Huawei Fit is a smart piece of equipment,
which can track sports activity, including sleep monitor,
heart rate, and notification display, it is hard for developers
to get real-time data. Thus, in this study, this device supports
little. But for further study, the mobility of this device might
give a hand. So, only heart rate can be considered as the
eighth attributes of behavioral states.
D.
Emotional Responses and Behavioral States
Due to associations among personality traits, emotional
responses and behavioral states have a significant influence
on mental health, it is very important to create a stressful
scenario since it is strongly related with data quality.
Therefore, a scenario of presentation in class was applied to
this study according to [2].
Because of class time limitation, three classes of
presentation were recorded respectively, and each class had
13, 13, and 12 student presentations, respectively. Each
presentation was about 8 minutes and was composed of 5
minutes personal speech and 3 minutes of questions &
answers. Besides personality traits, all emotional responses
and behavioral states data were collected by wearable
sensors.
Descriptions of six attributes of emotional responses are
as follows.

Interest measures on how much a person likes or
dislikes something.

Excitement captures the level of emotional arousal.

Engagement measures how immersed a person is in
what they are doing or experiencing.

Focus is an ability to concentrate on one task and
ignore distractions.

Stress measures how comfortable a person is with
the current challenge they are facing.

Relaxation is an ability to switch off and reach a
calm mental state.
As summarized, there are eight attributes of behavioral
states that will be analyzed with personality traits.

Smile: The possibility of smiling, ranged in [0, 1].

Clench: The possibility of clench, ranged in [0, 1].

Blink: The possibility of blink, ranged in [0, 1].

Surprise: The possibility of surprised, ranged in [0,
1].

Furrow: The possibility of a furrow, ranged in [0, 1].

Wink left and wink right: Detecting wink activity,
and the range is [0, 1].

Breath: Number of breaths per minute, ranged in
[10, 40], detected by Spire.

Heart rate: Ranged in [30, 200], detected by Huawei
Fit watch.
After data preprocessing, 90837 rows of data are
extracted from raw and real-time data. On average, each
participant contains 2390 rows of data, collected by Emotive
Insight. Breath data are collected from the Spire server and
heart rate data are got from Apple Health Kit.
IV.
CORRELATIONAL ANALYSES
The Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), which
measures the linear relationship between two variables X
and Y, is applied into this study [11]. Pearson correlation
coefficient, noted as r, varies between -1 and +1 with 0
implying no correlation. Positive correlations imply that as
x increases, so does y. Negative correlations imply that as x
increases, y decreases. Equation (1) shows, n is the sample
size, xi and yi are the single samples indexed with i and x ,
y are the mean value of x and y.

To test the null hypothesis that the true correlation
coefficients equal to 0, based on the value of the sample
correlation coefficient r, permutation tests provide a direct
approach to performing hypothesis tests and constructing
confidence intervals. Here, p-value is desired to test the null
hypothesis and it is the proportion of the r values generated
in permutation test that are larger than the PCC that was
calculated from the original data. In detail, p <= 0.01
implies strong evidences to reject null hypothesis, 0.01 < p
< =0.05 implies evidences to reject null hypothesis, 0.05 < p
<= 0.1 implies some
weak evidences to reject null
hypothesis, and p > 0.1 means no evidence to reject null
hypothesis. Here, null hypothesis is that there is no
correlation between two parameters X and Y.
Thus, 38 students’ personality trait values are shown in
Fig.
2.
Each
person
has
5
dimensions:
Openness
Conscientiousness,
Extraversion,
Agreeableness,
and
Neuroticism. In correlational analyses, mean values of
emotional responses and heart rate, sum values of smile,
clench, blink, surprise, furrow, wink left and right, and
breath were analyzed with personality traits. Table I
presents
meaningful
Pearson
correlation

between each dimension of Big Five and the mean values of
six attributes emotional responses.


Openness (O): Openness was positively associated
with wink.

Conscientiousness (C): Conscientiousness is most
associated with interest. In addition, the smaller sum
value of smile and wink, the more conscientious.

Extraversion (E): Extraversion has little influence on
emotional responses and behaviors.

Agreeableness (A): The smaller range of interest
value, the more agreeable. Besides, agreeableness is
most relevant to behaviors. The greater sum value of
blink, wink, and breath, the more agreeable. In
addition, agreeableness is negatively relevant with
clench and heart rate.

Neuroticism (N): N is most relevant to emotional
responses. The easier engaged, focused, interested,
and
excited,
the
more
neurotic.
In
addition,
neuroticism was negatively correlated with stress.
For behaviors, the more blink and greater heart rate,
the more neurotic.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
To summarize, our correlational analyses in this study
revealed two main points. The first one is that Neuroticism
(N) is most related to emotional responses and this
conclusion is also supported by previous psychological
researches. Secondly, agreeableness is most related to
behaviors. But there are still some problems in this work,
such as unstable connection of the Emotive Insight. In detail,
sometimes
participant’s
movement
or
hair
might
not
guarantee a high quality of connection. Based on these two
conclusions, further work is needed on how personality traits
are associated with emotional responses and behavioral
states.
