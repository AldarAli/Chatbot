Abstract— The present paper focuses on architecture 
principles for providing integrated e-learning services both as 
web services and as cloud services, technology that presently 
emerges as ‘on-demand’ services. The information system 
facilities are made available by integrating into a global web 
portal the dedicated services and synchronizing databases 
based on various technologies. The web portal architecture 
that currently comprises e-learning and dedicated information 
systems facilities is extended with cloud on-demand facilities. 
The classical portal architecture, based on MS technology, 
provides, as learning services, management content and e-
learning facilities for various user categories, as well as 
dedicated information system facilities. We design the 
extension of the this architecture with on-demand services in 
the cloud using Office 365, which provides cloud services for e-
mail, office applications and collaboration tools and we 
envision the impact of the new architecture. The described 
services, which are available on-demand, partly hosted in the 
cloud, create an “intensive” focused architecture that may be 
applied for various organization cases.  
Keywords- system integration; database synchronization; e-
learning; on-demand & cloud services; web portal.  
I. 
 INTRODUCTION AND WORKING FRAMEWORK  
Information system integration is a very important issue 
for present organizations and has been tackled in the 
literature especially for business and organizational 
processes [12]. System interoperability has also been dealt 
with from a semantic point of view [13]. 
System integration is best solved within a single sign-
on framework. The problem of managing uniform user 
identities in organizations is addressed by Shaw [16] within 
a management access system for a framework with different 
user identities in specific information systems (Quest 
OneIdentity Solution). The solution relies in building an 
unified identity and access management system – IAM 
within the organization, consolidating multiple identities in 
one (integrated) identity. The IAM approach [16] simplifies 
identity access and management within the organization, 
improving security and productivity, and providing single 
sign on, role management, multiple authentication and 
password management facilities. IAM complexity may be 
managed with [16]: (1) point solutions, which implement a 
password reset within a system and then synchronize it with 
the others, or (2) IAM frameworks, which implement a 
specific IAM solution based on already developed 
frameworks: IBM (Tivoli Identity Manager), Oracle, 
Novell, MS Forefront Identity Manager FIM (Identity 
Lifecyle Manager - ILM). Our paper uses the latter 
approach. The FIM / ILM server provides automated 
synchronization mechanisms that enable the integration of 
Active directory with other services, like SQL, e-mail 
(OWA), chat, etc.  
Universities also adopt information systems and 
integration solutions based on Oracle technologies [32]. Our 
option also takes into consideration the existing MS 
Academic Agreement from an IT strategy point of view [3]. 
In [6], [7], [8] we present the architecture of an e-learning 
portal for providing e-learning and dedicated information 
system services. The architecture, based on Microsoft 
technology, uses a FIM – Forefront Identity Manager [26] 
server, and additional interface modules, for integrating the 
dedicated information systems into the web portal that also 
provides e-learning facilities, based on SharePoint Portal 
functionalities. The proposed framework enables data and 
service integration that may be further exchanged within 
federated web services – see also [11], [20].  
The paper describes the extension of this architecture 
with on-demand services hosted in the cloud. In this respect, 
we are going to use Office 365 cloud services for e-mail, 
office applications and collaboration tools.  
Section 2 describes the present architecture integration 
principles. In Section 3, we present the web services that are 
provided within the portal, while Section 4 focuses on the 
new cloud services and on-demand facilities. Conclusions 
reveal the most important contributions of the paper. 
II. 
SYSTEM INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE  
The integrated e-learning portal provides academic web-
services: e-learning and dedicated information system ones. 
The portal integration with the dedicated information 
systems 
(AcademicInfo, 
ManageAsist, 
Research 
Management System in our case; see Section 3), is described 
further. The architecture we propose (see Fig. 1) is based on 
MS technology; we use an ILM – Identity Lifecycle 
Management – type server ensuring single sign-on 
capabilities and uniform interface to the dedicated 
information systems. Therefore, these dedicated facilities 
8

INTENSIVE 2013 : The Fifth International Conference on Resource Intensive Applications and Services

will be mapped into the portal, together with supplemental 
web services – see Section 4.   
In order to access the dedicated information system 
facilities, we selected the user categories that have specific 
functionalities and designed, for each, an “access point” into 
the portal. Authentication is performed by the same account 
and password into the portal and into the information 
systems, i.e. credentials are the same for the portal and the 
accessed information systems. After portal login and 
credentials check, the logon information is retained as 
current session variables and further passed on towards the 
information systems; access points are designed in respect 
with the account permissions (in our case, user categories are 
students, academic staff and /or research staff, managers, 
secretariats). Each user category may have one or more roles, 
based on which we define access points into the dedicated 
information systems. Credentials are passed to the accessed 
information system as session variables and used in order to 
also perform authentication into the dedicated systems.  
Permissions of each user category are retained in a global 
database, created by synchronizing the information systems’ 
databases with necessary information [7], [8]. In our case: 
 
students access their educational path (AcademicInfo 
system, see Section 3) and learning resources in view 
permissions (portal);  
 
academic staff access disciplines they teach and student 
grades (AcademicInfo [21]) and learning resources in 
design permissions, available facilities in the Research 
management system (activity upload, syntheses) and 
administrative facilities in ManageAsist system;  
 
research staff  access their facilities in the Research 
management system (activity upload, syntheses) and 
administrative facilities in ManageAsist system; 
 
managers access educational syntheses (AcademicInfo), 
research and financial syntheses for the unit they 
manage (department, faculty, institute, university) - 
Research management and ManageAsist systems [9].  
A. Database synchronization principles   
Single sign-on correctness is dependent on the 
permission information, consequently on the database 
consistency; therefore, database synchronization is required. 
The synchronization process will include the information 
systems’ databases and the portal database (Fig. 2). Database 
synchronization ensures global database consistency and 
updates access permissions both for the portal and the 
information systems; credentials logged in the portal will 
therefore be verifiable, within the global database, in respect 
with their permissions in the dedicated information systems.  
 
The global synchronized database is based on the human 
resource & organization chart information, retained in 
dedicated tables, as described in [6]:  
User[userid, account, password, unitid]  
Unit[unitid, unitname, …]  
Organization_chart [unitid, superior_id, horiz_id]  
This common database, used by the ILM server, also 
contains user and group authentication information, together 
with dedicated permissions in each of the information 
systems, in order to ensure access to corresponding 
permissions into the dedicated information systems. 
Permissions within the portal are implemented by means of 
dedicated groups. Active directory AD is provisioned with 
necessary information from the global database, using ILM 
as a synchronization interface (see Section 3).  
Security issues are managed according to AD and ILM 
principles – see [25], [26]. Data privacy aspects are treated 
according to the legal regulation principles (for example 
student grades, teacher wages), and accessible only to their 
owners and may be processed within the dedicated systems 
according to organizational workflows.  
The synchronization process is based on the dataflow 
sequences that occur in information processing; these 
sequences have to be defined in each organization case. In 
our case, the data workflow involves (Fig. 2, left hand side): 
 
1. organization chart and user tables are replicated from 
ManageAsist into the global database;  
 
2-3. these tables are afterwards sent into Research 
Management and AcademicInfo databases;  
 
4. 
grant 
tables 
are 
replicated 
from 
Research 
Management into the global database;  
 
5. these tables are then sent into ManageAsist database;  
 
6. students, disciplines, educational data, fee tables -
transferred from AcademicInfo into the global database;  
 
7. these tables are sent into ManageAsist database [9]  
The synchronization engine follows the above described 
steps 1-7; it searches Update, Insert and Delete operations 
and sends the corresponding information into the global 
database. Potential error messages are retained in a dedicated 
table from the global database. The synchronization process 
runs daily. First run time was around 7 hours, while current 
updates daily vary from 7 seconds to about 30 minutes, 
according to the updates that are performed on the databases. 
For an efficiency evaluation, current database dimensions 
are: AcademicInfo: 9.75GB (with 1.48GB data, rest – logs), 
ManageAsist: 
4.52G, 
Research 
Management: 
132M, 
UBBonline global database: 50.75GB (49.1GB, rest logs). A 
full permission restoration procedure, which sets single sign 
on permissions for ILM server, based on data provided by 
the dedicated systems (human resources, students, contract 
studies, etc.) runs daily, taking around 5 hours. Any potential 
errors are automatically logged and later analyzed; even if an

error occurs, the permission setting procedure is fully 
resumed the next day, so previous errors do not influence it, 
unless they occur consequent to some structural errors, 
which can be identified from the logs and solved.  
The latter process is performed via the ILM server (MS 
SQL web) between the global database GDB and Active 
directory AD information (BDG – UBBonline portal link in 
Fig. 2). We use ILM’s connector space (MS SQL web) and 
two dedicated agents which transfer information from the 
global database, respectively from AD into the connector 
space [9], compare it and synchronize the updated 
information from GDB into AD, updating therefore the 
necessary information in order to apply correct permissions 
within the portal access (ILM – OUs – UBBonline portal 
links in Fig. 2). The ILM server also performs the integration 
with AD and the SQL server managing UBBonline database, 
the e-mail server – MS Exchange and the communication 
server (see Fig. 2, lower right hand side).  
  
 
 
 
III. 
THE WEB SERVICES  
We further describe the web services provided by 
UBBonline e-learning portal [24].  
A. E-learning functionalities and virtual labs  
The implementation of e-learning facilities strongly 
contributed to the development of the student and goal 
centered learning model [1]. E-learning facilities are usually 
provided by means of web services.  
The web-based e-learning facilities provided by the 
described portal are the SharePoint [18] built in ones, 
adapted to our specific needs, and include:  
 
content management and sharing (see Fig. 3);  
 
schedule management and sharing,  
 
communication 
facilities 
(e-mail 
– 
OWA 
type, 
discussion lists, etc.) ,  
 
evaluation tools and feed-back facilities;  
 
task management, blog and RSS tools,  
 
survey tools, as well as other functionalities.   
The system is also open to adding new web-parts, 
services or components (for example, evaluation ones are 
being developed). Virtual lab services enable modelling of 
processes that may be tedious to be accessed in real 
conditions, or are required to be accessed remotely. These 
facilities support learning in experimental sciences and 
sharing experimental knowledge by electronic means in: 
process engineering, environmental engineering, physics,

chemistry, biology, etc. Our virtual labs facilities refer to: 
on-line virtual experiments and on-line labs; case studies 
based on mathematical modelling and simulation; recorded 
video sequences and on-line video streaming; posting 
material to be further processed with dedicated clients. 
Besides facilities for publishing virtual lab educational 
content within the discipline’s media library, the portal 
includes tools for managing virtual lab resources, modelled 
as a workflow for requesting, approving and allocating 
specific resources, like videoconferencing facilities, virtual 
machines, specific experimental equipments, etc.

B. Dedicated services provided by the information systems 
AcademicInfo [21] is an integrated information system 
dedicated to managing educational information, with 
facilities for secretariats, specific access for students and 
teachers and relevant syntheses on the educational process. 
The system models educational processes at BBU level, 
ensuring course selection in all faculties’ curricula, models in 
a flexible manner various types of educational activities (BA, 
MA, PhD, continuous), ensures multilingual support in 
processing &reporting. Specific web services are dedicated 
to: students, teachers, academic management – see also [7]. 
ManageAsist system is the integrated software system 
for administrative management that has been developed for 
our university. The system can be viewed as an ERP 
(Enterprise Resource Planning) system; in its design and 
implementation, 
we 
integrated 
systematic 
efficiency 
principles in software design [4]. ManageAsist’s principles 
and facilities are adapted to high education institutions, 
containing: Document management, Assets, Warehouse, 
Cashier, Finance, Accountancy, Grants, Human Resources 
and Acquisitions modules, decision assistance facilities [4]. 
Each module contains management reports for the 
corresponding compartment. Relevant synthesis from each 
compartment will be integrated, together with global 
management tools into a decision support module. The web 
services [22] include access to grant financial information 
and management of acquisition request, including specific 
reporting facilities for management levels.  
Our Research Management System [23] is a web 
based system that we have developed and implemented 
within Babes-Bolyai University (BBU) in order to manage 
research activities. The system offers, via web interfaces, 
accessible and user-friendly means of collecting specific 
information, and automatically performing quantitative 
analyses, syntheses and evaluations based on the collected 
information. The system is a tool for quantitative research 
evaluation, ensuring proficient management of BBU research 
activity and supporting competitive strategies in the field [2].  
C. Authentication Characteristics 
The portal provides single sign-on [29] facilities using a 
MS ILM - Identity Lifecycle Management Server [26] and 
ISA Server; the authentication is based on Active Directory 
facilities [6]. While OpenAuth protocol [27] grants access 
without sharing passwords, the architecture we describe uses 
the 
ILM 
facilities 
for 
synchronizing 
authentication 
information (User, password), according to [26]. This 
credential exchange is similar to the one used by OpenID 
protocol [28], but is performed by means of the ILM built in 
11

INTENSIVE 2013 : The Fifth International Conference on Resource Intensive Applications and Services

facilities, according to [26]. The authentication mechanism 
also implements the MS Domain Trust policy [25].  
We consider that the architecture based on ILM server 
[26] has good implementation advantages, since it already 
provides built-in web authentication facilities [6].  
D. Extensibility principles 
The solution we propose, based on MS technology and 
ILM authentication server, may be applied in various cases 
that require information system integration. Moreover, such 
an architecture may be enhanced with SharePoint facilities 
in order to provide sharing, communication and e-learning 
functionalities, 
which 
are 
often 
necessary 
within 
organizations. Considering we have available n information 
systems, the software services that can be provided into the 
web portal are represented in Fig. 4. 
 
IV. 
SERVICES ON-DEMAND  
Within the trend of providing proficient on-demand 
services, we have designed an extended portal architecture in 
order to include on-demand cloud services. This architecture 
is based on the integration of  MS Office 365 [31], which 
offers cloud services solution for mail, office applications 
and collaboration tools. Presently, Live@edu’s facilities 
(initially used for student accounts) have been migrated into 
Office 365. Office 365 integrates various product facilities 
within one, on-line tool [31]: office applications streamed 
from the cloud in real time, access to e-mail and calendar 
from any location (personal computer, web access, mobile or 
smart device), professional web sites facilities, file sharing 
and project management facilities, instant messaging, 
presence and conferencing, mobility, security and trust.  
Authentication integration and single sign on are 
performed based on the principles used in the initial 
architecture – see Section 2, by using Forefront Identity 
Manager and Exchange web functionalities are used for 
hosted e-mail accounts. E-mail migration is performed using 
the dedicated tools both for e-mail accounts [33] and office 
features [34] , and pursuing the specific stages.  
Cloud services have important on-demand availability 
characteristics, on an externally hosted infrastructure, and 
convenient costs (for example, in the case of student e-mail 
and file accounts, an owner hardware infrastructure would be 
more expensive). The use of such facilities may be extended 
with Office on-line functionalities.  
Universities’ usage of cloud services, with important 
benefits cost/proficiency benefits for large numbers of 
students are to be taken into consideration. E-mail, file space 
and Office facilities are relevant in this respect. The 
experience, including the information system integration 
principles proposed in Section 3D, may be transferred to 
other organizations with learning goals or with large 
numbers of employees, especially in the case of initially 
scarce infrastructure investments.   
After fully implementing these facilities, we plan to 
compare access time and workload for the on-site and in-
cloud scenarios and to perform a complete cost-benefit 
analysis.  
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  
The paper describes the evolution of portal architectures 
from web services to cloud services. The current portal 
architecture provides system integration facilities, systems 
being integrated, together with sharing and communication 
facilities into a global portal.  
Our case study is performed on an academic institution; 
the universities’ case is quite complex, since their activity 
covers: education, research, administration. The system 
framework integrates various web services within the portal: 
e-learning facilities, virtual labs and dedicated information 
facilities. We describe the integration solution of web 
services into the portal, including web-based facilities from 
the dedicated information systems. The solution is based on 
MS technology and provides means of integrating various 
information systems by implementing a single authentication 
server and mapping specific facilities from the dedicated 
information systems, for each user category. This 
architecture is based on a global integrated database and a 
permission mapping scheme for ensuring appropriate access 
into the dedicated information systems.  
Synchronization processes from the information system 
databases into the global database run daily, taking up to 30 
minutes or less, depending on the database updates, for a 
~50GB global database. Single sign-on permissions are also 
updated daily based on data provisioned by the dedicated 
systems. This web service integration solution has a good 
extensibility degree and may be applied in various 
organizational cases, aiming at providing integrated services, 
by building a single log-on framework for learning, 
collaboration facilities, and integrating dedicated information 
system services. 
On a second development stage, we have extended the 
portal architecture with on-demand cloud services taking into 
account their high availability and convenient costs. 
Therefore, students use Office 365 facilities for e-mail and 
file space facilities. This solution has important advantages 
regarding necessary storage space, which is externalized, as 
well as the necessary software services, which are provided 
in the cloud. After fully implementing these facilities, we 
plan to compare access time and workload for the on-site and 
in-cloud scenarios.  
The advantages of the proposed solution rely in 
providing a uniform web framework for: database 
synchronization of various information systems databases

and web access to e-learning and information collaboration 
& sharing tools and dedicated system facilities. The 
proposed framework enables data and service integration – 
both web and cloud – that are available at with single sign-
on. This integration solution has a good extensibility degree 
and may be applied in various cases.
