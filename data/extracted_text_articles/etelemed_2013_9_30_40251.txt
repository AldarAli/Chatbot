Abstract— A high level of medication adherence is important 
for people with refractory epilepsy. For most people, however, 
it is difficult to have their medication intakes as prescribed 
every day. In this study we investigated if Real Time 
Medication Monitoring (RTMM) with customized SMS-
reminding had an effect on the adherence level of people with 
epilepsy. We found a higher adherence level for people 
receiving these customized SMS reminders, compared to 
monitored patients not receiving reminders. Additionally, they 
also feel more adherent, their seizure frequency or severity 
decreases and they experience a better overall health. 
Keywords: medication adherence; epilepsy; medication 
monitoring; medication reminders; SMS. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Epilepsy is a disorder of recurrent unprovoked seizures. 
the prevalence of epilepsy in Europe is 0.007%, but in people 
with an intellectual disability the prevalence is about 30% 
[1]. Although it is a disturbance of brain function, epilepsy 
can be categorized as a chronic disease. Most people with 
epilepsy need to take daily medication over an extended 
period of time.  
Although medication does not cure epilepsy, in about 
70% of the people with epilepsy seizures disappear with 
medical treatment. For the remaining 30% seizures continue 
to exist. Continuing seizures are seen more often in persons 
with lower cognitive ability. The regularity of medication 
intake is important in epilepsy treatment since omission of 
one or more doses can provoke seizures [2]. The severity of 
these seizures, sometimes after a long period of seizure 
freeness, can be higher, sometimes resulting in a status 
epilepticus or even sudden unidentified death in epilepsy 
(SUDEP) [3]. For most people it is difficult to have their 
medication intakes as prescribed every day. In a Dutch 
questionnaire study into the medication use of people with 
epilepsy an adherence of 65% was found [4]. 
Especially persons with below-average cognitive ability 
and patients in puberty are groups who need extra support in 
medication adherence. 
Several earlier studies evaluated SMS reminders showing 
positive results on adherence [5-10]. In these studies, 
however, SMS reminders were sent regardless of whether the 
patient had taken the medication or not. Such automated 
daily reminders may cause habituation resulting in a loss of 
effectiveness [8]. Hence, in our study we aim to avoid 
habituation by using a Real Time Medication Monitoring 
service with customized SMS-reminding: patients are only 
reminded when they have forgotten to take their medication. 
To our knowledge our study is the first to evaluate a Real 
Time Medication Monitoring service with customized SMS-
reminding to support people with refractory epilepsy in their 
medication use. The main aim of this study is to evaluate the 
effect of this service on the adherence to anti-epileptic 
medication in patients with refractory epilepsy. We focus on 
the aspect of adherence that refers to how well patients 
follow their prescribed regimen [11]. Furthermore we are 
interested in secondary effects of the improved medication 
adherence: do patients experience a change in seizure 
frequency or severity and in quality of life?

METHODS 
A. The RTMM-service 
The RTMM service is based on an electronic dispenser 
(see Figure 1). The dispenser sends a brief message to a 
central server each time it is opened. The message is sent 
wirelessly, through the GSM network via GPRS, to a central 
server. This message contains information about the date and 
time of the dispenser opening. The electronic dispenser 
works in nearly every country in the world at locations where 
mobile phones have network coverage.

Figure 1.  The RTMM service with customized SMS reminders 
Patients were instructed when receiving the dispenser and 
chose one up to four time intervals within which they had to 
take their medication. This was according to their prescribed 
number of daily doses. The medication was placed in the 
dispenser by the patients themselves. An SMS reminder 
would be sent if they had not opened their medication 
dispenser within the agreed time interval. The content of the 
reminder was: “Have you taken your medication yet? Please 
take your medication as prescribed by your health care 
provider”. 
B. Illustration of data registered with RTMM 
Figure 2 shows an example of data as collected by the 
RTMM service. The horizontal axis displays the days of the 
monitored month, the vertical axis displays the 24 hours of 
each day. Each opening of the medication dispenser is 
plotted by one dot in the diagram. The shaded segments 
represent the agreed time periods for medication intake. In 
this example the patient follows a medication regimen of 
four daily doses. The RTMM data reveals quite a regular 
pattern of medication use for this patient.

C. Study design 
The study described here is an observational cohort 
study of data collected during a period of at least two 
months during which participants (n=28) used RTMM with 
the intervention of SMS reminders. 
The use of an electronic monitoring device may already 
contribute to a higher adherence because of patients’ 
awareness of being monitored [12]. To find the exclusive 
effect of the SMS-reminding function in this device, a 
subset 
of 
the 
included 
participants 
(n=18) 
were 
electronically monitored with RTMM without the SMS 
reminders, for at least 6 weeks (see Figure 3). This control 
period (t0–t1) was prior to the intervention period with the 
SMS reminder service (t1-t2). 
 
 
Figure 3.  Included participants per type of intervention 
D. Participants 
Inclusion criteria for participants were: (1) having a 
clinically definite diagnosis of epilepsy; (2) having at least 
one epileptic seizure per week; (3) being able to present a 
precise documentation (diary) of all seizures during half a 
year prior to the start of the study; (4) aged 15 years or older; 
(5) independently taking and managing medication; (6) 
having access to and being able to use a computer and 
internet; (7) owning and being able to use a mobile phone. 
Besides these inclusion criteria there was one exclusion 
criterion: ‘playing’ with the device: opening and closing it 
for non-medication purposes for multiple times a day during 
a week. These criteria are elaborated upon in the research 
protocol [13]. 
Participants were recruited from the outpatient clinic of 
the tertiary epilepsy clinic in Zwolle. They responded to 
posters in the waiting rooms with a call for volunteers. Or 
they were asked by their neurologist, nurse practitioner or 
other paramedical co-worker of the clinic. The inclusion of 
the participants was performed by one of the investigators 
explaining the study and the participant’s role. If the person 
with epilepsy agreed to participate and met the inclusion 
criteria an informed consent was signed by both the 
participant and investigator. Ultimately, 28 persons with 
epilepsy participated in the study. 
E. Outcome measures 
The first two outcome measures were calculated from 
data registered with the RTMM service during the 
intervention period. 
 
(1) Correct intakes: the proportion of doses taken within 
agreed and predefined standardized time intervals. 
This measure is to assess the precision with which 
the patients adhere to the prescribed regimen. 
(2) Missed doses: the proportion of doses not taken, 
calculated by dividing the total number of missed 
doses by the total number of prescribed doses during 
the intervention period. This measure is to assess 
whether the appropriate number of doses was taken 
each day.

The following outcome measures concern patients’ 
experiences which were assessed with written questionnaires 
handed out to each patient both pre-test (t0) and post-test (t2). 
The following aspects were measured: 
 
(3) Patients’ judgment on their medication adherence. 
Patients were asked to compare their adherence to 
medication use with and without the support of 
RTMM with SMS reminders. 
(4) Seizure frequency. Patients were asked for their 
seizure frequency in the prior six weeks based on 
their paper diaries. The paper diaries were also 
handed in and answers were checked by the 
investigators. 
(5) Experienced effects on seizures after RTMM 
intervention. Patients were asked to indicate if and 
how their seizures differed after the intervention 
period. 
(6) Quality of live. The health-related Quality-of-Live 
questionnaire, with 31-items (QOLIE-31) by Cramer 
et al. [14] was used to assess the quality of live. This 
validated questionnaire covers both general and 
epilepsy-specific 
domains. 
Cross-cultural 
translations were made for nine languages among 
which Dutch. 
(7) Satisfaction with the RTMM service. Patients were 
asked for their experience with the SMS reminder 
service on two aspects: convenience of total service, 
and ease of use of the medication dispenser. 
 
III. 
RESULTS 
A. Characteristics of Study Participants 
In total 48 persons with epilepsy received the dispenser 
and the corresponding instructions. Eleven persons did not 
use it at all or only during a few days. Five persons used it 
only during 1-4 weeks and four only during the period 
without SMS reminders (control period). These 20 persons 
were classified as “drop outs”. Their reasons for dropping 
out varied from the design of the dispenser to privacy 
concerns. 
Ultimately, 28 persons with epilepsy participated in this 
study. The characteristics of both participants and drop outs 
are shown in Table I. There are no differences between both 
groups for gender, age, educational level, living situation, 
and seizure frequency. The groups differ in their daytime 
activities: participants had more regular daily activities, like 
work or school, than the drop outs (71.4% vs. 30%, 
p=0.014). Furthermore, the severity of epilepsy differed 
between both groups. In total 35% of the drop outs had 
severe tonic-clonic seizures compared to 14.2% of the 
participants (p=0.041).

In addition to the above control group, ten participants 
received SMS reminders from the start of their inclusion (t0-
t2). In these ten participants the median percentage of 
correct intakes was 88.06% (34.58-97.92). The median 
percentage of missed doses was in these ten participants 
9.17 (1.88-44.17). Both percentages did not differ 
significantly from the control group when receiving SMS 
reminders (t1-t2). 
C. Experienced Adherence 
In the post-test questionnaire a majority of the 
participants (57.1%) indicated they experienced an 
improved adherence due to the RTMM service with SMS 
reminders (Table IV).

Although these results were not statistically significant, 
a trend is visible: participants seem to have less seizures 
during the use of RTMM with SMS reminders than before 
this use. 
E. Experienced effects on seizures 
In the post-test questionnaire participants were asked 
about the effect of the RTMM service with SMS reminders 
on their seizures (Table V). A decrease of seizure frequency 
was mentioned by seven participants (25%). No change in 
seizure frequency but a decrease in seizure severity was 
mentioned by 16 participants (57.1%).

F. Quality of Live 
The Quality of Life in Epilepsy questionnaire (QOLIE-

A comparison for the control group between QOLIE(0) and 
QOLIE(1) indicated no significant differences in Total 
Score, nor in the six different dimensions (Seizure Worry, 
Emotional 
Well-being, 
Energy-fatigue, 
Cognitive 
functioning, Medication effects, Social functioning).

questions about the use of the dispenser showed in general 
results fitting to moderate satisfaction. Most people thought 
the device helped them in medication use resulting in a 
better compliance. They were satisfied with the reminders 
by SMS. Half of the participants were satisfied with the 
design of the medication box.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
People with refractory epilepsy using Real Time 
Medication Monitoring (RTMM) with customized SMS-
reminding to support their medication use, have a higher 
adherence level than patients who do not receive SMS-
reminding. Additionally, they also feel more adherent, their 
seizure frequency or severity decreases and they experience 
a better overall health. Overall, patients’ experiences with 
the RTMM system are positive. 
Since other patient groups have adherence difficulties as 
well, the RTMM service with customized SMS-reminding 
may provide opportunities for increasing adherence for 
other chronic diseases. 
A. Discussion 
Our findings are in line with the results from the single 
previous study we found evaluating the effect of RTMM 
with customized SMS reminders on adherence [15]. Similar 
to our results, Vervloet et al. found increased adherence 
levels for participants receiving SMS reminders compared 
to participants who were only monitored with RTMM. 
Vervloet’s study concerned type 2 diabetes patients. What 
we added to this study was not only the effect on adherence 
for a different group of patients, but also the effect on the 
health of these patients, be it subjective. Where Vervloet did 
not collect clinical data (i.e. blood glucose levels) or 
subjective data on health conditions, we collected data on 
the experienced epileptic seizures and quality of life. 
Participants in our study experience less seizures or less 
severe seizures and an increase in overall health. The latter 
is likely to stem from the decreased number or severity of 
seizures, but may also (partly) be the effect of a feeling of 
reassurance participants get from the SMS reminders: they 
do not have to worry to forget a dose since they will receive 
a reminder by SMS. We did not investigate whether this 
reassurance was one of the effects of the RTMM service 
with customized SMS reminders. 
A common critique of RTMM is that opening the 
medication dispenser is not a confirmation of the actual 
ingestion of the medication. However, the validity of 
electronic monitoring devices is confirmed by studies 
comparing drug assays with medication intake behaviour 
measured through electronic dispensers [16-18]. 
B. Limitations 
This study was performed in a small sample of people 
with refractory epilepsy, in an epilepsy clinic. This 
limitation influences the statistical significance of results 
and it prevented us from analysing results of subgroups 
within the total group of participants. 
A second limitation of the study concerns the chosen 
inclusion criterion of having at least one seizure per week. 
This resulted in participants with high seizure frequencies. 
We selected this group expecting they would benefit most 
from RTMM with customized SMS reminders. Future 
research should also include participants with lower seizure 
frequencies. 
C. Future Work 
Due to the positive results of the above study the RTMM 
service with customized SMS-reminding is now structurally 
embedded in the involved epilepsy clinic. It is offered to a 
broader group of persons with epilepsy than based on the 
above inclusion criteria. Young people, mentally disabled 
people and persons with lower seizure frequencies are using 
the service and will be monitored. This offers the authors 
the opportunity to build on the above study with new data 
concerning longer term effects of a larger sample of 
participants from different subgroups.

The authors strongly recommend for future studies to 
investigate the differences in adherence effects between 
customized and non-customized SMS reminders. The latter 
have become available by freely downloadable apps running 
on smartphones. As indicated in the Introduction, daily sent 
reminders may cause habituation leading to lower 
effectiveness. Future studies should include a control group 
monitored by RTMM but receiving non-customized SMS 
reminders. 
Future research is also recommended to further 
investigate the impact of RTMM and SMS reminders on 
seizure frequency and severity. The authors aim at studying 
this impact by requesting participants to keep a digital diary 
on computer or mobile. Hence, the relation between 
adherence and frequency and severity of seizures can be 
automatically deduced. These studies should concern long 
term intervention periods and also include patients with 
lower seizure frequencies. 
A final recommendation for future research concerns the 
use of the adherence data by involved specialists and nurse 
practitioners. To what extent and how do involved medical 
professionals use this data logged by the RTMM service and 
how does it influence their (medication) treatment of people 
with refractory epilepsy?
