Abstract—New points of view to the problems concerning the de-
centralized control of a class of large-scale systems with relevant
subsystems interactions are presented in the paper. The problems
are transformed into enhanced design conditions through slack
matrices until global asymptotic stability of the complete system
is pursued using Lyapunov approach. As results, a sufﬁcient
condition for the existence is formulated in terms of linear matrix
inequalities while the impact of interconnection uncertainties is
minimized using H∞ approach. The decentralized controllers
proved to globally stabilize the system, both in noiseless and
noisy conditions.
Keywords-Large-scale systems; decentralized control; stabilizing
conditions; linear matrix inequalities; H∞ robust control; control
of multi-area power systems.

INTRODUCTION
Complex large-scale dynamic systems appear in many en-
gineering ﬁelds and so, naturally, the control of large-scale
systems has been studied by many researchers to provide
comprehensive contributions on analytical and computational
methods for feedback control design of such systems [2], [17].
Different decentralized control structures were proposed and
different algorithms were derived depending on the local state
control laws.
If the linear model of a large dynamic system is partitioned
into interconnected subsystems, the interactions of the subsys-
tem play signiﬁcant role in global system stability and, if inter-
actions contain uncertainties, expected performances cannot be
attained if the control is designed only for the nominal models.
The success of these methods can be improved if the system
state are grouped so that subsystem interaction is minimized
and the decentralized controllers are optimized with respect
to interaction uncertainties. The ﬁrst usable results for the
existence of robust decentralized controllers mostly involve the
conditions under which the matrix of interconnections in the
considered large-scale system satisﬁes the prescribed matching
condition [20], [23].
Recently, a number of efforts have been made to extend
the application of robust control techniques using convex
optimization, involving linear matrix inequalities (LMI). It is
well known that LMI-based approaches [5] are powerful for
a centralized control design, but, in the decentralized case,
the control design task may not be oftentimes reducible to
a feasibility problem because of existence of control law
structural constraints.
To meet modern system requirements, controllers have to
quarantine robustness over a wide range of system operating
conditions and this further highlights the fact that robust-
ness to interconnections and interaction uncertainties among
subsystems is one of the major issues. Applying for power
systems control, the most important terms are robustness and a
decentralized control structure [15], [24]. The robustness issue
arises to deal with uncertainties which mainly come from the
varying network topology and the dynamic variation of the
load. On the other hand, since a real-time information transfer
among subsystems is unfeasible, decentralized controllers have
to be exploited. To achieve less-conservative control gains
design conditions, norm-bounded unknown uncertainties in
subsystem interactions, or nonlinear bounds of interconnec-
tions, are included in LMI terms in the design condition
formulation [9].
Focusing on the above problems, the paper is sequenced in
eight sections and one appendix. Following the introduction
in Section I, the second section places the results obtained
within the context of existing requests. Section III brieﬂy
describes the problems concerning with control of the large-
scale dynamical systems with relevant subsystem interactions.
The preliminaries, mainly focused on the H∞ based design
approach as well as on the bounded real lemma forms, are
presented in Section IV. Section V points out the stability
analysis of the controlled system by use of a set of LMIs
and Section VI states the newly proposed conditions for the
state controller design. Section V illustrates the design task by
numerical solutions and system stability analysis and Section
VI draws some concluding remarks. Appendix is devoted to a
model of the multi-area power systems, used in the illustrative
example.
Throughout the paper, the notations is narrowly standard in
such way that xT , XT denotes the transpose of the vector
x and matrix X, respectively, X = XT > 0, (≥ 0), means
that X is a symmetric positive deﬁnite (semi-deﬁnite) matrix,
rank( · ) remits the rank of a matrix, the symbol In indicates the
n-th order identity matrix, IR denotes the set of real numbers,
IRn×r refers to the set of all n×r real matrices, || . || entails the
standard l2-norm and l2⟨0, +∞) connotes the space of random
signal over ⟨0, +∞).

THE STATE OF THE ART
During the past decades, there has been signiﬁcant but
scattered activity in control of the systems with interactions. A
necessary and sufﬁcient condition for solvability, in the case of
ﬁxed interconnections, has been found, e.g., in [7], [8], [25],
where a homotopic method was used to reduce the control
design to a feasibility problem of a bilinear matrix inequality
(BMI). Moreover, if the LMI method is adopted by using a
single Lyapunov function [3], [19], it leads to very conservative
results.
The paper reﬂects the problems concerning with the system
robust stability for one class of disturbed large-scale systems,
in the presence of interconnection uncertainties among sub-
systems. The used approach is concentrated on performance
improvement of control systems and is a continuation of the
earlier work started in [13], [18], especially motivated by the
techniques presented in [4], and improved in [1] with respect
to disturbance transfer function norm minimization, the system
dynamics improvement and the decentralized control design
simpliﬁcation.
Comparing with the above mentioned articles, the merit of
the results proposed in this paper relies on the conservatism
reducing through slack matrices incorporation into enhanced
design conditions. This represents issues which lead to a
newly formulated set of LMIs, giving the sufﬁcient conditions
for design of the decentralized controllers, with closed-loop
system matrix satisfying the Gershgorin circle theorem [11].
Results are illustrated using the load frequency control model
of the multi-area power systems.

PROBLEM FORMULATION
To formulate the control design task, it is assumed that the
subsystems are given adequately to (A.10), (A.11), i.e., it is
considered for i = 1, 2, ..., p that
˙qi(t)=Aiqi(t)+biui(t)+
p
∑
l=1
Gilql(t)+f idi(t)
(1)
yi(t) = cT
i qi(t)
(2)
where qi(t) ∈ IR ni is the vector of the state variables of the i-
th subsystem, ui(t), yi(t) ∈ IR are input and output variables
of the i-th subsystem, respectively, Ai, Gil ∈ IR ni×ni are
real matrices, bi, ci, f i ∈ IR ni are real column vectors. The
disturbance di(t) is a non-anticipative precess, where {d(t) ∈
l2( ⟨0, ∞); IR).
It is supposed that all states variables of a subsystem are
measured or observed, all subsystems matrix of dynamics
Ai, i = 1, 2, ..., p are of full rank, all pairs (Ai, bi) are
controllable, and the i-th subsystem is controlled by the local
state feedback control law
ui(t) = kT
i qi(t)
(3)
where ki ∈ IRni is a constant gain vector.
It is supposed that the interconnections with the uncertainty
terms in (1) can be, in general, written as
Gihi(q(t)) =
p
∑
l=1
Gilql(t)
(4)
where hi(q(t)) ∈ IRni is a vector function, satisfying the
inequality
hT
i (q(t))hi(q(t)) ≤ ε−1
i qT(t)wT
i wiq(t)
(5)
where ε−1
i
> 0, εi ∈ IR is a scalar parameter, related to
interconnection uncertainties, and wi are constant vectors of
appropriate dimensions.
Using the overall system state variable vector q(t), deﬁned
as follows
qT(t) =
[ qT
1(t)
qT
2(t)
· · ·
qT
p (t) ]
(6)
then (5) can be rewritten as
p∑
l=1
hT
l (q(t))hl(q(t)) = hT(q(t))h(q(t)) ≤
≤ qT (t)
[ p∑
l=1
ε−1
l
wT
l wl
]
q(t)
(7)
The global system model with the subsystem interactions
takes now the form
˙q(t) = Aq(t) + Bu(t) + Gh(q(t)) + F d(t)
(8)
y(t) = Cq(t)
(9)
where
yT(t) = [ y1(t)

· · ·
yp(t) ]
(10)
uT(t) = [ u1(t)
u2(t)
· · ·

(11)
dT(t) = [ d1(t)
d2(t)
· · ·
dp(t) ]
(12)
A = diag [ A1

(13)
B = diag [ b1

(14)
G = diag [ G1

(15)
F = diag

(16)
C = diag

(17)
where q(t) ∈ IR n, u(t), y(t) ∈ IR r, A, G ∈ IR n×n, B, F ∈
IR n×r, C ∈ IR r×n and ∑p
i=1 ni = n.
The goal is the parameter design of the control law for
overall system
u(t) = Kq(t)
(18)
where K ∈ IRr×n,
K = diag

(19)
in such way that the controlled global large-scale system is
stable.

PRELIMINARY RESULTS
The main purpose of this section is to present the concept
of system quadratic performance, based on the H∞ norm of e
system transfer matrix. In that sense are proven and exploited
the following results.
Proposition 1: If M, N are matrices of appropriate dimen-
sions, and X is a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix of proper
dimension, then
M T N + N T M ≤ N T XN + M T X−1M
(20)
Proof: [12] Since X = XT > 0, then
(
X− 1
2 M − X
1
2 N
)T(
X− 1
2 M − X
1
2 N
)
≥ 0
(21)
M TX−1M + N TXN − M TN − N TM ≥ 0
(22)
It is evident that (22) implies (20). This concludes the proof.
Deﬁnition 1: Let a linear multi input and multi output
(MIMO) system is described in the the state-space form by
the equation
˙q(t) = Aq(t) + Bu(t)
(23)
and the output relation
y(t) = Cq(t) + Du(t)
(24)
where q(t) ∈ IR n, u(t) ∈ IR r, and y(t) ∈ IR m are vectors
of the state, input and output variables, respectively, and A ∈
IR n×n, B ∈ IR n×r, C ∈ IR m×n and D ∈ IR m×r are real
matrices. Then the transfer function matrix G(s) of the system
(23), (24) is
G(s) = C(sI − A)−1B + D
(25)
Note, this deﬁnition is used only in this section.
The proof of announced lemmas in this section is based on
the following result (see, e.g., the proof of Theorem 1 in [12]).
Proposition 2: (quadratic performance) If a stable system is
described by the transfer function matrix (25) of the dimension
m × r, there exists such positive γ ∈ IR that
∫ ∞
0
(yT(v)y(v) − γuT(v)u(v))dv > 0
(26)
where y(t) ∈ IRm is the vector of the system output variables,
u(t) ∈ IRr is the vector of the system input variables and γ
is an upper bound of square of the H∞ norm of (25).
Proof: It is evident, from (25), that
ey(s) = G(s)eu(s)
(27)
where ey(s), eu(s) stands for the Laplace transform of m
dimensional output vector and r dimensional input vector,
respectively. Then (27) implies
∥ey(s)∥ ≤ ∥G(s)∥∥eu(s)∥
(28)
with ∥G(s)∥ standing for the H2 norm of the system transfer
function matrix G(s). Since H∞ norm property states
1
√m∥G(s)∥∞ ≤ ∥G(s)∥ ≤ √r∥G(s)∥∞
(29)
where ∥G(s)∥∞ is the H∞ norm of the system transfer
function matrix G(s), using the notation ∥G(s)∥∞ = √γ,
the inequality (29) can be rewritten as
0 <
1
√m ≤
∥ey(s)∥
√γ∥eu(s)∥ ≤ ∥G(s)∥
√γ
≤ √r
(30)
Thus, based on Parceval’s theorem, (30) gives for m ≥ 1
1 ≤
∥ey(s)∥
√γ∥eu(s)∥ =
( ∞
∫
0
yT (v)y(v)dv
) 1
2
√γ
( ∞
∫
0
uT (v)u(v)dv
) 1
2
(31)
and, subsequently, it yields
∫ ∞
0
yT (v)y(v)dv − γ
∫ ∞
0
uT (v)u(v)dv ≥ 0
(32)
that is the mapping from u(t) to y(t) is said to have the H∞
norm less than √γ.
It is evident that (32) implies (26). This concludes the proof.
Before exploiting the principle of quadratic performance in
the design of control (18), the following bounded real lemmas
for the system (23), (24) are recalled.
Lemma 1: (bounded real lemma) System described by (23),
(24) is asymptotically stable with the quadratic performance
√γ if there exist a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix P ∈
IRn×n and a positive scalar γ ∈ IR such that
P = P T > 0,
γ > 0

(34)
where Ir ∈ IR r×r, Im ∈ IR m×m are identity matrices of
given dimensions, respectively.
Here, and hereafter, ∗ denotes the symmetric item in a
symmetric matrix.
Proof: (compare [5], [18]) Since overall system (23), (24)
is linear in q(t), using the Krasovskii theorem (see, e.g., [16])
and considering (32), the Lyapunov function v(q(t)) can be
considered as
v(q(t)) = qT(t)P q(t)+
+
t∫
0
(yT (v)y(v) − γrT (v)u(v))dv > 0
(35)
where P = P T > 0, γ > 0.
Thus, evaluating the derivative of v(q(t)) with respect to t
along a system trajectory, it yields
˙v(q(t)) = ˙qT (t)P q(t) + qT (t)P ˙q(t)+
+yT (t)y(t) − γuT (t)u(t) < 0
(36)
Therefore, the substitution of (23), (24) into (36) gives
˙v(q(t)) = (Aq(t) + Bu(t))T P q(t)+
+qT (t)P (Aq(t)+Bu(t)) − γuT(t)u(t)+
+(Cq(t) + Du(t))T (Cq(t) + Du(t)) < 0

and with the notation
qT
c (t) =

(38)
it is obtained
˙v(q(t)) = qT

Since

[ C

(41)
applying Schur complement property to (41), then (40) implies
(34). This concludes the proof.
From this results, the stability problem is reduced to ﬁnd a
Lyapunov matrix P and a parameter γ to stabilize the system
and to guarantee the H∞ norm attenuation between u(t) and
y(t).
Lemma 2: (enhanced bounded real lemma) System de-
scribed by (23), (24) is asymptotically stable with the quadratic
performance √γ if for given positive δ ∈ IR there exist
symmetric positive deﬁnite matrices P , S ∈ IRn×n, and a
positive scalar γ ∈ IR such that
P = P T > 0,
S = ST > 0,
γ > 0

Proof: (compare, e.g., [13]) Since (23) implies
Aq(t) + Bu(t) − ˙q(t) = 0
(44)
then with positive deﬁnite symmetric matrices S1, S2
∈
IR n×n it yields
(
qT(t)S1 + ˙qT(t)S2
)
(Aq(t) + Bu(t) − ˙q(t)) = 0
(45)
Thus, adding (45) as well as the transpose of (45) to (36)
and substituting (24) in (36) results in
˙v(q(t))= ˙qT(t)P q(t)+ qT(t)P ˙q(t) − γuT(t)u(t)+
+(Cq(t) + Du(t))T (Cq(t) + Du(t))+
+(Aq(t) + Bu(t) − ˙q(t))T (S1q(t) + S2 ˙q(t))+
+(qT(t)S1 + ˙qT(t)S2)(Aq(t) − Bu(t) − ˙q(t)) < 0
(46)
Using the notation
q ◦T
c (t) =
[
qT (t)
uT (t)
˙qT (t)
]
(47)
the inequality (46) can be written as
˙v(q(t)) = q◦T

Thus, setting
S1 = S,
S2 = δS
(52)
and applying analogously Schur complement property to (51),
then (49) implies (43). This concludes the proof.
The consequence of this Lemma is that of separating the
Lyapunov matrix P from the system matric parameters, i.e.,
there is no product P A, P B in the LMIs, which substantially
reduces conservatism of solutions, especially if the system is
linear with polytopic uncertainties.
Conversely, in the Lemma, a positive real scalar δ is involved
in the LMIs as a prescribed constant design parameter. The
procedure of adding scalar in LMIs has been widely explored
in literature (see, e.g., [22]). Moreover, such a parameterization
is often needed when converting BMI into linear ones.

Evaluating the derivative of v(q(t)) with respect to t along

Inserting the closed-loop system matrix Ac ∈ IRn×n instead
the system matrix A in (54), where
Ac = A − BK
(74)
the bilinear matrix inequality is obtained. To transform this
BMI into LMI, the next new theorem is proposed.
Theorem 1: The system (8), with output given by the re-
lation (9), is stabilized with quadratic performance via the
controller (18) if there exist symmetric positive deﬁnite matri-

ENHANCED DESIGN CONDITIONS
The idea of separating the Lyapunov matrix P from the
system matric parameters is based on the method of Krasovskii
and the theory of slack matrices [13]. In short, for the linear
large-scale systems this method lies the next new stability con-
ditions, formulated with respect to the subsystem interactions
quadratic performances.
Theorem 2: The autonomous system from (8) is asymptot-
ically stable with bounded quadratic performance if for given
positive δ ∈ IR there exist symmetric positive deﬁnite matrices
P i, V i ∈ IRni×ni and positive scalars γi, λi, ϵi ∈ IR such that
for i = 1, 2, . . . , p
P i = P i > 0, V i = V i > 0, γi > 0, λi > 0, ϵi > 0 (86)

and the matrices P , Γu, Γd given in (56), (57), (58), respec-

Proof: Since (8) implies
Aq(t) + Bu(t) + Gh(q(t)) + F d(t) − ˙q(t) = 0
(92)
then with positive deﬁnite symmetric block diagonal matrices

Then, adding (93) and the transpose of (93) to (60) and
subsequently substituting (9) in (60) results in

In order to make this result applicable and operational, it is
necessary to give the parameter δ and verify the obtained H∞

be used for tuning of the dynamics of the closed-loop system

That, in the both cases, the resulting system time responses
have small relative damping is not given by the attribute of
the presented algorithms but implies from the characteristic
properties of multiarea power systems.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
Decentralized robust control design for large scale systems
with relevant subsystem interactions is formulated in the paper
as an optimization problem and solved by LMIs. A conveyed
characterization for the interaction bounds is presented and the
sufﬁcient condition for stabilizing decentralized robust control
design are newly originated in the bounded real lemma as well
as in the enhanced bounded real lemma structure, respectively.
Since the theorems are newly derived, the proofs was necessary
to include due to their original contributions.
The optimization principe, involving structured matrix vari-
ables in the linear matrix inequalities, takes into account
the interaction bounds and the resulted decomposition gives
enough ﬂexibility to allow the inclusion of more general
subsystem interaction structures and different output channels
measurement gains.
The feasibility and effectiveness of enhanced bounded real
lemma based control design are demonstrated using a multi-
area model of the power system. It was shown that the
global system can be locally asymptotically stabilizable by
the decentralized state feedback laws, where application of the
tuning parameter can improve dynamic system responses.

APPENDIX
Considering a multi-area power system, the next analysis
is based on the assumption that the electrical interconnections
within each area of multi-area power system are so strong,
at least in relation to ties with the neighboring areas that the
whole area can be characterized only by a single frequency
(see, e.g., [18] and the references therein). Therefore, it is
supposed that the power equilibrium applied to the area i can
be written as
TP i
d∆fi(t)
dt
+ ∆fi(t) + KP k∆PT k(t) =
= KP i∆PGi(t) − KP i∆PDi(t)
(A.1)
where TP i is the area model time constant (s), ∆fi(t) is the
area incremental frequency deviation (Hz), KP i is the area gain
(Hz/pu MW), ∆PT i(t) is the incremental change of the total
real power exported from the area (Hz/pu MW), ∆PGi(t) is
the incremental change in generator output (Hz/pu MW), and
∆PDi(t) is the unknown load disturbance (Hz/pu MW).
If the line losses are neglected, the individual line powers
can be written in the form
PT i(t) = |Vi||Vυ|
XυiPυi sin(δi(t) − δυ(t)) =
= PT iυ max sin(δi(t) − δυ(t))
(A.2)
Vi(t)=|Vi| exp(jδi(t)), Vυ(t)=|Vυ| exp(jδυ(t))
(A.3)
is the terminal bus voltage of the line, and Xνi is its reactance.
When the phase angles deviate from their nominal values by
the amounts ∆δi, ∆δν, respectively, the next approximation
can be obtained [14]
∆PT i(t) =
= Vi||Vυ|
XυiPυi cos(δin(t)−δυn(t))(∆δi(t)−∆δυ(t))
(A.4)
∆PT i(t) =
=2π|Vi||Vυ|
XυiPυi cos(δin(t)−δυn(t))
{∫ t
0∆fi(r)dr−
−
∫ t
0∆fυ(r)dr
}
(A.5)
respectively. Related to the area frequency changes, the time
derivative of the individual line powers is
d∆PT iυ(t)
dt
= Siυ(∆fi(t) − ∆fυ(t))
(A.6)
d∆PT i(t)
dt
=
∑
i̸=l
Sil(∆fi(t) − ∆fl(t))
(A.7)
respectively, where Sil is the synchronizing coefﬁcient (elec-
trical stiffness of the tie line).
The incremental generated power of the area i for small
system variable changes around the nominal settings can be
represented by the equations
TT i
d∆PGi(t)
dt
+ ∆PGi(t) = ∆xHi(t)
(A.8)
THi
d∆xHi(t)
dt
+∆xHi(t) = ∆PCi(t)− 1
Ri

where TT i is the turbine time constant (s), THi is the governor
time constant (s) (generator response is instantaneous), Ri is
a measure of static speed droop (Hz/pu MW), ∆PCi(t) is
the incremental change of the command signal to the speed
changer (control input), and ∆xHi(t) is the incremental change
in the governor value position (pu MW), all with respect to
the area i.
From the analysis made above the given formulation shows
that the functioning of the multiarea power system is roughly
a process with relevant interactions. The compact notation of
(A.1), (A.7), (A.8), and (A.9) in the state-space form so leads
to the equations [18]

More details, or multiarea model structure modiﬁcations, can
be found, e.g., in [6], [10].
Under above given model parameters, the stability of the
overall system can be studied by the stability properties of
all subsystems, and by global features of all subsystems
interactions.
