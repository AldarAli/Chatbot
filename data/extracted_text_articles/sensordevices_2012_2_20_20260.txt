Abstract—Investigation on the more suitable technologies 
to register human body movements in 3D space with great 
spatial accuracy is a very challenging task, because a wide 
range of applications are concerned, from registration of 
post-stroke 
rehabilitation 
or 
sports 
performance, 
to 
monitoring of movement of disabled or elderly people, only 
to give some examples. In this paper, the possibilities offered 
by resistive bend sensors to register joint bend angles, for 
human posture recognition and motion analysis, have been 
explored. This paper suggests to extract an electrical model 
either to simulate their electrical behavior during bending 
and extension movements, and to recover the true bending 
angles from model simulation. To give an example, the 
proposed model was applied to track human joint 
movements, and it was demonstrated that it can lead to 
recover the original signal waveform, which represents the 
true joint rotation, also for the fastest human speed.  
Keywords– bend sensor; sensor modeling; motion analysis; 
posture recognition. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Technology progress in the last decades have provided 
the opportunity to observe human behavior in 3D space 
with great spatial accuracy, thanks to image-based 
methods or virtual reality tools. This is a very challenging 
task, because a wide range of applications are concerned, 
from registration of post-stroke rehabilitation and sports 
performance, to monitoring of movement of disabled and 
elderly people, only to give some examples [1]. 
In order to measure human body kinematics, it is 
convenient to adopt sensors, which can measure bending 
angles with good precision despite a low cost. Resistive 
bend sensors can be made of a polyester base material 
printed on with a special carbon ink. The polyester acts as 
a support while the ink's resistance decreases the more it is 
bent. The ink is screen printed so it can be applied on 
virtually any custom shape and size film to fit to each 
body joint. The substrate film material is usually formed 
by Kapton and/or Mylar for their properties, stands the 
fact that substrate must be able to bend repeatedly without 
failure for the sensor to work [2]. The sensor can be over-
molded (for instance with silicon or urethane) and it can 
work in dirty environments (oil, dust). This kind of 
sensors are available on the market (e.g., Images SI Inc. 
[3], Flexpoint Sensor Systems Inc. [4]). Figure 1 provides 
a photo of a sensor strip sample. 
Resistive bend sensors can be applied to body joint as 
electronic goniometers, to realize goniometric sock for 
rotation assessment of body segments in human posture 
recognition, or to goniometric gloves, which enable 
multiple 
finger 
joint 
positions 
to 
be 
acquired 
simultaneously, and allow hand patterns to be recognized 
[5,6,7,8]. However, in order to useful exploit sensor's 
properties, a complete electromechanical characterization 
is mandatory [9]. Moreover, a new modeling technique 
will be developed. Available resistive bend sensor models, 
in fact, continue to incorrectly employ a merely variable 
resistance to model the sensor electrical properties under a 
bending strength. Little experimental study and theoretical 
analysis has been undertaken on the effect of a range of 
bend angles and rates on sensor response, as well as 
investigation on repeatability testing under static and 
dynamic bending strength [7]. One perceived problem is 
to calibrate sensor performance in terms of prediction 
error in high precision and/or high speed applications. As 
a result, an electrical model is required that not only 
models the static resistive response, but also characterizes 
the electrical behavior during bending transitions [10]. A 
logical choice seems to investigate on sensor behavioral 
models, as a consequence of the most important 
manufacturers of commercial bend sensors do not provide 
any description of their own technological process.

In Section II, the experimental apparatus for static and 
dynamic measurements is described, and the static 
performance of bend sensors to different bend angles, is 
provided. In Section III, a new approach to extract 
electrical behavioral models is described. In Section IV, 
the behavioral model was applied either to predict sensor 
performance in tracking slow and fast rotations, and to 
recover the true sensor rotation angles. Finally, some 
conclusions are drawn in Section V. 
II. EXPERIMENTAL   APPARATUS 
The apparatus employed for this analysis was designed 
to emulate, in a controlled environment, the behavior of 
commercial carbon-ink bend sensors, printed on pet strip 
substrates, when applied to body joints to track segment 
rotations. Figure 2 shows a schematic of the experimental 
set-up. The sensor sample was laid as a cantilever beam 
on a metal hinge. In order to bend the sensor from 0 to 
150 degrees (for set-up mechanical constraints) with 
different bending rates, the sample side connected to the 
8.5 cm

electrodes was locked in a stationary clamp, fixed to a 
rotating platform operated by a step motor. The other side 
of the sensor strip was put in a sliding clamp to avoid the 
sample stretching. Bending angle step amplitude was 
changed reliably with one degree resolution from a 
Labview interface serial connected to a PC. The step 
motor is a PD-109-57 sample from Trinamic, connected to 
the PC through a RS-232 cable. Motor speed rate can be 
set changing the TMLC (Trinamic Motion Control 
Language) units (1000 TMCL units correspond to 9.537 
RPS or rounds-per-second). In this way, the sensor 
resistance can be characterized in terms of the expected 
bending angles at different speed rates [11].

a 
digital 
multimeter, 
a 
quasi-static 
resistance characterization against the bending angle of a 
bend sensor from Images SI Inc. has been accomplished. 
Since body segment rotations approximately range from 0 
to 150 degrees, they will be tracked exploiting only 
outward rotations. In this case, the sensor resistive strip 
must be external with respect to the body joint. Sensor 
resistance behavior is almost linear with bending rotation 
degrees, as shown in Fig. 3.

In most applications, however, the response of the 
sensor device under test (DUT) is acquired throughout its 
voltage response in a resistive divider, as shown in Fig. 4. 
In this case, a linear resistance response does not imply a 
linear voltage as also reported Fig. 3. As brought out in 
Fig. 5, the choice of a low or high series reference 
resistance Rref  changes the sensor sensitivity at low or 
high bending degrees, respectively. To enhance sensor 
sensitivity at low bending angles, a series resistance equal 
to the starting value (at 0°) of the sensor resistance is often 
chosen.

Dynamic measurements have been performed at

where it is controlled by the Visual Analyzer program, a 
free software of virtual instrumentation [13]. The 
measurement file data can be saved on a text file. This set-
up allows to perform sensor resistance measurements with 
a great noise immunity. The set-up hardware and software 
interfaces are described by the block schematic in Fig. 6.

III. ELECTRICAL  MODELS 
The most important manufacturers of commercial 
sensors do not provide any description of their 
technological process, and, in any case, this kind of 
investigation does not concern design engineers of sensor 
cognitive systems. From observation of sensor resistance 
response under fast bending rates, that is rotation speed, it 
has been observed a distortion of measured resistance 
waveform respect to that which should corresponds to the 
true forced rotations. If sensor displacement over the 
hinge has been carefully accomplished, avoiding any 
obstacle or friction which can hinder the sensor slide 
inside the hinge guide, this distortion can be accounted 
only to  material relaxation delays. Authors suggest to 
model this behavior through an electrical model 
represented by a low-pass RLC circuit, shown in Fig. 7.  
 
 
Fig. 7. Schematic representation of a resistive divider containing the 
sensor equivalent circuit to describe its dynamic behavior. 
 
The resistance R corresponds to the static sensor 
resistance, corresponding to each bending angle. In order 
to hold linear analysis, R was represented as a piecewise-
constant model, changing its value for each rotation 
degree. The sensor response was therefore obtained from 
an iterative routine, which performs linear circuit analysis 
computing successive step solutions, where the initial 
conditions at each step are the last values of the previous 
one. The global sensor response is obtained as a chain of 
successive solutions. The other two circuit parameters L 
and C can be represented by the resonant factor Q and 
frequency f0 , which can be tuned in a reasonable range to 
fit the model simulation to the measured waveform, with 
no account on their physical meaning [14]. 
This approach has a twofold advantage: from one hand 
the model can predict the sensor performance for different 
bending ranges and rates, especially useful in that 
applications where high speed movements have to be 
monitored, from the other hand, a new method to recover 
the waveform corresponding to the true rotation can be 
developed. 
IV. SIGNAL  RECOVERY 
Once the RLC electrical model parameters have been 
fit to the sensor dynamic measurement, the sensor 
performance 
can 
be

either 
from 
sensor 
measurements with the impedance meter, or circuit model 
simulation from the equation

Equation (8) provide the recovered sensor resistance 
waveform corresponding to the true bending degree of 
joint rotation. In order to avoid spurious spikes on 
simulated data derivatives, a twofold strategy has been 
followed: first of all selecting a model not only on the 
basis of error minimization but also continuity of second 
order derivatives, then adopting smoothing techniques 
based on derivative average and digital lowpass filtering. 
This approach has been also applied to different circuit 
topology, which here are not reported for sake of brevity. 
This method has been applied to distorted sensor 
measurements, obtained from the test equipment setting 
the step motor speed for fast sawtooth rotations of the 
hinge where the sensor is lied, between 0 and 150 degrees, 
at 5 Hz cycle rate, which are, respectively, the maximum 
registered human joint rotation amplitude and speed. 
Look-up tables can map the sensor resistance response in 
the corresponding bending angles through interpolation of 
static characterization shown in Fig. 3. Results are plotted 
in Fig. 8, where it is evident that the suggested method has 
been succeeded to recover the signal waveform 
corresponding to the true hinge rotation, because the two 
traces are almost superimposed.

In order to validate the method, the same modeling 
circuit has been used to recover the true hinge rotation 
from the simulated waveform with less distortion at a 
lower frequency (2 Hz). Results have been plotted in    
Fig. 9, which shows a perfect agreement between the true 
and recovered hinge rotation.

Next developments of this method are foreseen where 
the true signal recovery will be performed in real time by 
digital signal processing routines, applied on input data

microcontroller or digital signal processor [15]. 
V. CONCLUSION 
This paper aimed to demonstrate that resistive bend 
sensor can be applied for human posture and motion 
recognition. Even if static characterization has revealed 
that bend sensors change their resistance nonlinearly with 
bending rotation degrees, true bending angles would be 
correctly detected through corresponding look-up tables, if 
material relaxation delays would not cause signal 
distortion. Nevertheless, modeling the sensor behavior 
with appropriate circuit models, with no mind to the 
physical meaning of the circuit parameters, can lead to 
estimate the sensor performance for different rotation 
speed and amplitude, and to recover the original signal 
waveform which represents the true joint rotation from 
sensor measurements. The method has been successfully 
applied to track the fastest human joint rotation 
movements.
