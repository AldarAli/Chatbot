Abstract— Most brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are based on 
one of three types of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals: 
P300s, steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP), and 
event-related desynchronization (ERD). EEG is typically 
recorded non-invasively using active or passive electrodes 
mounted on the human scalp. The common setup requires 
conductive electrode gel to get the best entrance impedance 
and noise ratio. However, electrode gel is inconvenient, 
uncomfortable, and entails setting problems that are especially 
pronounced when trained users are not available. Some work 
has introduced dry electrode systems that do not require gel, 
but often entail reduced comfort and signal quality. The 
principal goal of this study was to compare the performance of 
dry vs. gel-based electrodes in a very common BCI system: 
P300 spelling.

INTRODUCTION PER CERT 
BRAIN - Computer Interfaces (BCIs) allow new 
communication channels based on different mental states. In 
a typical BCI, a user performs voluntary mental tasks that 
each produce distinct patterns of electrical activity in the 
electroencephalogram (EEG). Using monitoring systems and 
on-line signal processing software, it is possible to identify 
which mental tasks a user performed at a specific time. Most 
modern BCIs rely on one of three types of mental tasks, 
which are associated with different types of brain activity: 
- 
Imagined movement, which produces event-related 
desynchronization (ERD) [1] and [2]; 
- 
Attention to oscillating visual stimuli, which 
produces steady-state visually evoked potentials 
(SSVEP) [3]; 
- 
Attention to transient stimuli, which produces the 
P300 event-related potential [4], [5] and [6]. 
Noninvasive BCIs are hampered by the need for 
conductive gel to get a good contact between electrodes and 
the user’s scalp. The gel is uncomfortable to many subjects, 
and must be washed out of the cap and hair after each use. 
This procedure increases the time and inconvenience needed 
for each EEG recording session. Also, after a few hours, the 
gel dries and new gel has to be applied [7]. These problems 
reduce the appeal of EEG-based technologies to most users, 
and can be especially pronounced for severely disabled users 
– even though these are the people who need BCIs most. 
Numerous articles that survey different end users have 
further confirmed that dry electrodes are a very high priority. 
Casson [8] surveyed neurologists and found that almost 90% 
agreed there is a clinical need for “wearable electrodes”. 
Huggins [9] surveyed 61 ALS patients and found one of their 
main concerns was “set-up simplicity”. Zickler [10] 
surveyed severely disabled users and found that major issues 
included “possibility of independent use” and “easiness of 
use”. Blain [11] presented a focus group study with 8 ALS 
patients and 9 carers. One of their main concerns was a more 
convenient way to sense brain signals.  
However, early dry electrodes had various problems, 
including reduced signal quality, inadequate robustness to 
movement, electrical artifacts, cost, and comfort. A second 
generation of dry electrodes based on an active system is 
used to study the difference in signal quality and robustness 
against artifacts.  
In the following sections, we will first introduce the sys-
tem components of the IntendiX P300 speller software; 
describe its characteristics and the workflow of our 
experiment. Then, we will provide our results comparing dry 
and gel electrodes obtained from 23 patients. 
II. 
METHODS  
A. Experimental procedure  
23 subjects (6 female, age: 22-60) participated in the 
study. All subjects were free of medication, had normal 
vision, and no history of central nervous system 
abnormalities. Subjects sat in front of a laptop computer. 
The laptop used the intendiX row/column (RC) speller 
shown in Figure 1. The RC speller presented 50 characters 
(the 26 letters of the English alphabet, integers from 0 to 9, 
and 14 special characters). Subjects were instructed to 
mentally count each time a target character flashed while 
ignoring other flashes. Subjects were first asked to spell the 
word “WATER” for calibration and then spell the word 
“LUCAS” (only the accuracy results of spell “LUCAS” are 
reported in this paper). The system randomly highlights one 
column or row for 100 ms, followed by a 60 ms dark time

between these flashes. Each row and column was highlighted 
15 times for each letter, resulting in 225 flashes per trial, and 
1125 flashes for a five-letter word. Signal processing 
software extracts ERPs (100ms to 700ms) after each flash 
and uses linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to classifier the 
most important P300 response. The intendiX system then 
presents the target character on the monitor, and the 
highlighting restarts so the user can spell the next letter. 
P300 BCIs are relatively fast. The first BCI to exceed 
100 bits/min was shown by P. Brunner in 2011 [12]. 
B. Hardware and software 
IntendiX P300 software (from g.tec medical engineering 
GmbH, Austria) provides a full personal EEG-based 
spelling system. This application generates the visual 
simulation, calculates the parameters for the classification 
and processes the data to extract a target character. 
Figure 2 shows the electrode configuration for the P300 
speller. The EEG were acquired using a g.USBamp (24 Bit 
biosignal amplification unit from g.tec medical engineering 
GmbH, Austria) with a sampling frequency of 256 Hz. EEG 
electrodes were placed using the international 10/20 
electrode system. EEG recordings based on gel electrodes

were conducted with active g.BUTTERfly electrodes 
(golden ring electrode type with a hole in the middle to 
inject the gel);EEG recordings based on dry electrodes 
instead used active g.SAHARA electrodes (8 gold-coated 
pins with 7 mm length mounted in a circular arrangement, 
diameter 15 mm) [13]. 
III. 
RESULTS 
No significant differences were found between gel and 
dry electrodes. The raw data look similar for both electrode 
types, including the noise created by eye blink artifacts and 
some high frequency activity. 
An accurate study of the evoked potentials shows that, in 
both cases, the evoked potential (EP) reaches its maximum 
of about 6 µV after about 340ms.

The EP looks very similar for the dry and gel based 
electrodes; see Figure 3. This figure shows the P300 
response for dry and gel electrodes in the copy spelling run 
of 1 subject. Each run had 5 characters flashed 30 times, 15 
rows and 15 columns. The comparison of the training and 
copy spelling run shows that the EP is very stable over time. 
Table I summarizes the BCI performance results. One 
column presents the results with dry electrodes from the 
present study. Another column summarizes gel electrodes 
from a large group study with gel based electrodes (N=81) 
[4]. N specifies the number of subjects summarized on each 
column. 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
We show that the used dry electrode sensor concept can 
be used for P300 based BCI systems. Dry electrodes do not 
use gel, resulting in higher skin impedance as well as greater 
comfort and convenience. The higher skin impedance can 
increase vulnerability to artifacts below 3 Hz.  
To test the usefulness of dry electrodes for the P300 BCI 
we conducted a group study with 23 subjects, and compared 
the EPs (for 1 subject) and accuracies (for all subjects). The 
latencies and amplitudes of the P300 appeared to be similar 
for dry and gel based electrodes. 
In this case, dry electrodes require about the same setup 
time as gel electrodes. P300 active electrodes can be 
mounted in about 3 minutes, and dry electrodes require about 
1 minute or below. However, after the cap is mounted, dry 
electrodes need a few minutes to adjust, and therefore the 
preparation time is comparable to active electrodes. 
The biggest advantage of dry electrodes is that no 
abrasive and conductive gel remains in the hair. Therefore, 
the time consuming cleaning of patient’s hair is avoided. 
Another big advantage is that the electrodes do not get in 
contact with water for cleaning and therefore the lifetime is 
enhanced. None of the subjects reported discomfort from the 
dry electrodes. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
The results of the study have important consequences. 
Dry electrodes speed up the cap mounting process, enhance 
user acceptance, increase the possible recording time, and 
therefore bring the technology closer to many people. 
Although the dry electrodes show higher signal power below 
3 Hz resulting from low frequency drifts, we did successfully 
show that the P300 speller works.
