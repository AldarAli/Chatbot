Abstract—It is essential to evaluate the number of cancer cells to 
analyze cancer genome for cancer genomic medicine. However, 
it takes a long time, and pathologists’ skills are needed to 
evaluate it. Our group has developed and proposed a Terahertz 
Chemical Microscope (TCM) to evaluate it easily and fast. In 
this study, antibodies were immobilized by covalent bonding 
and avidin-biotin reaction to detect cancer cells, and their 
immobilizing methods were compared. The results suggest that 
signal accuracy is improved to detect lung cancer cells using 
avidin-biotin reaction.

 INTRODUCTION 
Recently, cancer genomic medicine has been attracted to 
be a cancer treatment to reduce the physical burden of patients 
in cancer treatments. The cancer genome is analyzed, and 
individualized treatment is provided to each cancer patient. In 
order to provide cancer patients with this treatment, it is 
essential to analyze the cancer genome. Before analyzing the 
cancer genome, it is essential to evaluate the number of cancer 
cells in a specimen tissue to analyze the cancer genome 
efficiently. In general, the evaluation is done by treating the 
specimen tissue with Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded 
(FFPE) and observing it with a microscope by pathologists. 
However, in FFPE, the recommended time to fix the specimen 
tissue is from 24 to 48 hours [1], so it takes at least 2 or 3 days 
to evaluate. Also, evaluation precision depends on the 
pathologists’ skills to process the tissue by FFPE or 
distinguish cancer cells from normal cells in the tissue.  
Our group has developed and proposed a Terahertz 
Chemical Microscope (TCM) [2] [3] to evaluate the number 
of cancer cells in a solution without complex pretreatments as 
FFPE [4]-[6]. TCM can measure cancer cells in the solution, 
so little pretreatment is required. Also, TCM can evaluate the 
number of cancer cells quantitatively. In the TCM, cancer 
cells are detected using immune reactions. So, it is crucial to 
immobilize antibodies on a sensing plate used as a terahertz 
emitter.  
In this study, in order to accurate detection terahertz 
signals, the methods of immobilizing antibodies using 
covalent bonding [7] [8] and using an avidin- biotin reaction 
[6] were compared by measuring PC9 and EBC1, which are a 
human lung adenocarcinoma culture cell and a human lung 
squamous cell carcinoma culture cell, respectively. 
II. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
TCM can detect cancer cells in a solution on a sensing 
plate by measuring the amplitude of terahertz wave radiated 
from the sensing plate. Figures 1 (a) and (b) show the 
processes of immobilizing antibodies using covalent bonding 
and avidin-biotin reaction respectively. In Figure 1 (a), 20 
µg/mL of anti IgG (Antigen Affinity Purified, Bethyl 
Laboratories, Inc., Montgomery, Alabama, USA) was 
immobilized on the sensing plate using amino coupling as the 
covalent bonding [7] [8] for 17 h at 4 ºC, and the SiO2 film 
surface was blocked using skim milk to prevent nonspecific 
adsorption for 15 min at 18 ºC-25 ºC. Cytokeratin, AE1/AE3 
(Agilent Technologies Japan, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) which is 
reacted with various tumors such as adenocarcinoma and 
squamous cell carcinoma was used as an antibody and it was 
immobilized by reacting with the anti IgG for 9 h at 4 ºC. In 
Figure 1 (b), 45 µg/mL of avidin (affinity-purified, Vector 
Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, California, United States) was 
immobilized on the sensing plate for 17 h at 4 ºC, and the SiO2 
film surface was blocked in the same way as immobilizing the 
anti IgG. 100 μg/mL of biotin conjugated anti IgG (Antigen 
Affinity Purified, Bethyl Laboratories, Inc., Montgomery, 
Alabama, USA) was immobilized for 5 h at 4 ºC, and 
Cytokeratin, AE1/AE3 was immobilized in the same way as 
the covalent bonding. After that, in the covalent bonding and

the avidin-biotin reaction, 6.7×106 cell/mL of PC9 and 2.7
× 106 cell/mL of EBC1 reacted with immobilized 
Cytokeratin, AE/AE3 for 12 h at 4 ºC, respectively. The 
unreacted PC9 and EBC1 were removed by washing 10 
times. After Cytokeratin, AE1/AE3 was immobilized on 
the sensing plate and the unreacted PC9 and EBC1 were 
washed, the amplitude of terahertz was measured by the 
TCM. The change of terahertz amplitude was calculated. 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Figure 2 shows the average change of terahertz 
amplitude before and after the reaction of PC9 and EBC1 in 
each immobilizing method. Error bars show the standard 
deviation of the change of terahertz amplitude in 3 samples. 
In the covalent bonding, the average changes of terahertz 
amplitude were 0.90±0.66 mV for measuring PC9 and 
0.68±0.43 mV for measuring EBC1. In the avidin-biotin 
reaction, they were 0.82±0.15 mV, 0.33±0.23 mV for 
measuring PC9 and EBC1, respectively. In both methods, 
the average changes of terahertz amplitude in measuring 
EBC1 were lower than measuring PC9, because we think 
the concentration of EBC1 is lower than that of PC9 and the 
charge of EBC1 is smaller than that of PC9. Especially in 
the avidin-biotin reaction, we think that the lower electric 
charge of EBC1 was not transmitted well, because the 
distance between the sensing plate and the EBC1 was 
longer. However, the avidin-biotin reaction was 4.4-fold 
and 1.9-fold lower standard deviation than the covalent  
bonding for the measurement of PC9 and EBC1, 
respectively, because we think that the antibody could be

immobilized in higher density using avidin biotin reaction 
and did not detach from the sensing plate in the process of 
the reaction of lung cancer cells or washing. This result 
shows lung cancer cells could be measured accurately by 
immobilizing antibodies using the avidin-biotin reaction.

CONCLUSION 
Immobilization methods of covalent bonding and 
avidin-biotin reaction were compared by measuring PC9 
and EBC1. In the avidin-biotin reaction, the change of 
terahertz amplitude was smaller. However, the standard 
deviation was 4.4-fold and 1.9-fold lower than the covalent 
bonding. This result suggests that lung cancer cells can be 
measured accurately by using avidin-biotin reaction and 
immobilizing the antibody in high density and firmly.
