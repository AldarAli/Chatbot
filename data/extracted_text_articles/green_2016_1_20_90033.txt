Abstract— This paper presents the channel propagation 
characteristics analysis in 3500MHz outdoor environments and 
verification by Ray-Tracing simulations. Because we are 
studying small cell hot spot environment, we use 3500MHz. We 
describe a computer program to predict radio propagation in 
buildings, based on site-specific information, such as wall 
locations and building materials. Line-of-sight, specularly 
transmitted, 
specularly 
reflected, 
and 
non-specularly 
transmitted and reflected rays are included in the model. 
Actually, we considered two places, each one with different 
environmental conditions: one was Dunsan-dong and the 
second was the Electronics and Telecommunications Research 
Institute (ETRI).  We measured the path loss and, to verify our 
measurement results, we compared them with Ray-Tracing 
results.  
Keywords- path loss;  outdoor path analysis; Ray-Tracing.

 INTRODUCTION 
The purpose of the experiment is to analyze the channel 
propagation characteristics. Currently, the rapid increase in 
demand for wireless communication and the explosive 
growth of the mobile communication service require 
optimization of the next generation mobile communication 
system. The development of efficient frequency use and 
study of competitive next generation radio transmission 
technology are based on the exact identification of the radio 
channel characteristics. Path loss is one of the many channel 
parameters that can represent radio channel characteristics. 
Also, microcellular path loss can be predicted from the Ultra 
High Frequency (UHF) [1]. Finally, the experiment was 
difficult to execute because of poor meteorological 
conditions such as rain, preventing the progress of the 
experiment.  
In this paper, we present results that were obtained in the 
ETRI and Dunsan- dong outdoor environments. We used a 
lisotropic antenna with 3500MHz frequency. Many people 
claim that 3500MHz is the frequency of 5G. For this reason, 
we decided to analyze the 3500MHz. The power was 
different in the two locations: for ETRI, it was 0.974W and 
for Dunsan-dong it was 2W. We focused on propagation 
characteristics, which are important for the development and 
validation of a realistic channel model. No experiment was 
performed in bad weather, so there were difficulties or 
obstacles in that regard. We compared the measurement 
results and simulation results from the Ray-Tracing 3D 
simulator to verify our data. This paper is structured into 4 
sections. In Section II, we explain the measurement 
environments. In Section III, 
we perform 
channel 
characteristic analysis and in Section IV we deal with 
verification of path loss analysis using Ray-Tracing. We 
conclude in Section V.

MEASUREMENT EVIRONMENTS 
The measurements were performed in 2 places in Daejeon 
using an antenna array mounted on a car. These places are 
shown in Figure 1. We used a 1-by-1 antenna, i.e, Single-
Input Single-Output (SISO) and the wideband radio channel 
measurement system was the channel sounder.

As shown in Figure 1, the measurement scenarios 
consist of 2 different Tx locations and Rx routes. Dunsan-
dong Tx is inside a building and ETRI is in stadium. During 
the measurements, the Tx was stationary at each site, while 
the Rx was driven along the measurement routes. TABLE I 
shows the detailed information of the measurement places.

 Antenna was located in the middle of the rooftop on the 
motor vehicle at a base station (BS) with the antenna height 
of 7.3 m. The mobile station (MS)’s antenna with the 
antenna height of 2 m was set on the end of the rooftop on 
the motor vehicle because we could ignore the reflection 
since the absorber was installed on the rear surface of the 
vehicle. TABLE II shows the information related to the 
channel sounder system.

two million per second, the maximum transmit power of 
33dBm in Tx. SISO  was the antenna that we used.

 CHANNEL CHARACTERISTIC ANALYSIS 
Path loss is a major element in planning cell coverage. In 
the UHF (Ultra High Frequency) band case, there are many 
existing 
models. 
For 
example, 
Kronrcker 
model, 
Weichelberger model, etc. But, there are few studies on peer 
to peer signal attenuation at 700 MHz frequency. The 
propagation of energy from the transmitter to the receiver 
occurs in various modes. Because of this, it is important to 
recognize the path loss dependence. The path loss is 
extracted from the measurements and comparisons are made 
with the results [2][3]. 
The distance-dependent part of the path loss is modeled 
to be a function of the geometrical distance, d, as

where L0 is the initial value at the reference distance dref 
and n is the path loss index, and Xσ is standard deviation. 
The measured received power values indicate that the path 
loss decreases when the receiving vehicle moves because 
that path loss is reduced in a logarithmic form [4]. 
Measurement was performed at each place per 100 m, 
and over 100 times of each test point. Path loss occurs when 
the signal passes through a radio channel. Figure 3 shows the 
path loss that occurs when the car moves 10m~500m .

Figure 3. Received level of our measured data 
Comparing the two measurement areas, we can see that 
the Dunsan - dong has a large power attenuation. It means 
that, when the radio wave moves in the wireless channel, 
lots of elements interrupt the flow of the radio wave. 
Actually, high rise buildings, large pedestrian population 
and vehicles added a lot more distractions. Table 3 shows 
the measurement environment by a constant value.

According to the above results, path loss characteristic is 
distance-dependent. Dunsan-dong PL Initial Value and PL 
index are much bigger than ETRI. But the result of standard 
deviation is different; ETRI is bigger than Dunsan – dong. 
 
IV. 
VERIFICATION OF PATH LOSS ANALYSIS USING RAY-
TRACING METHOD 
A. Ray-Tracing simulation configuration 
To verify the validity of the measurement results, we 
made a simulation based on the ETRI and Dunsan-dong 
cases. Then, we compared the simulation results with our 
measurements. We made a 3D model similar to the real 
environment for Ray-Tracing simulation. In the Ray-
Tracing we used quality of the material. A software 
application has been written to implement the model as an 
automated propagation prediction tool. The program uses 
Ray –Tracing to account for all possible propagation paths. 
Ray-Tracing is commonly used for computer image 
rendering and for computer animation. Ray-Tracing is used 
instead of electromagnetic image theory so various channel 
geometries can be considered. Image theory is cumbersome 
when randomly oriented objects or multiple reflections are 
considered. As computation times increase, Ray-Tracing 
acceleration techniques are employed to combat the 
computational requirements of Ray-Tracing. In Ray-Tracing 
we set up some materials [5].  
Floor and buildings are concrete, forest and trees are 
wood, and finally, tennis court is sandy soil. Figure 4 and 5 
show the Ray-Tracing simulation configuration for ETRI 
and Dunsan – dong, respectively.

B. Verification of our measurement result 
Figure 6 shows a comparison between Ray-Tracing and 
our measurement data. The red line represents the 
measurement results and the blue line is the Ray-Tracing 
simulation result. In ETRI, the result of Ray-Tracing and 
measurement are little bit different. The reason is that, in 
ETRI, there are many hills and it is very difficult to express 
that in Ray-Tracing. This is this reason why the graph is not 
perfect match. But, in Dunsan-dong, the 2 graphs are similar.

CONCLUSION  
We presented a measurement system, and measured the 
characteristics of the wave propagation in the outdoor 
environment at 3500MHz. We deduced path characteristics 
for SISO wireless mobile communication systems in the 
outdoor environments from the measured data. Also, we 
compared path characteristics with simulation results 
obtained by Ray-Tracing. From the comparison results, we 
conclude that there is little difference in path characteristics. 
Path loss characteristics have different trend in the Dunsan-
dong and ETRI case. In ETRI, there are many different 
materials so, the graph is a little different. So, we need to 
make a new path loss model for new mobile communication 
system. Finally, to verify the validity of the analysis results, 
the measurement data is compared to simulation results. The 
measurement data and simulated data show similar 
inclination, which leads us to believe that our measurements 
are correct.
