Abstract—-A
new
method
for
mathematically
describing
cellular
and
molecular
structures,
mechanisms, and
states is
presented.
A novel
mathematical formulation of structure is developed,
and new mathematical formulations of structural
complexity and similarity are introduced that take into
account differences in composition and structure at all
levels of detail and apply equally to structures,
mechanisms, and states. A recursive formula for
calculation of structural similarity is derived.
The
methods and mathematical formulations apply equally
to cases in which we have complete knowledge and to
those in which we have only incomplete or partial
information. The formalism and the mathematical
similarity definition are the full generalization of
sequence and sequence similarity.
They enable the
creation
of
repositories
of
formal
multi-level
structural descriptions of biological entities and new
search capabilities, such as searching for processes or
structures similar to a specified one, or with specified
structural or compositional deviations.
Keywords- multi-level structure; mathematical
models of structure; quantifying structural similarity
1. Introduction
DNA and protein sequence databases are of great
value to biologists. They have this value because they
are formal. A DNA or protein is specified by a string
of characters on a 4- or 20-letter alphabet; a PDB entry
is specified by a set of formal atom names and
locations. Because specifications are formal, formal
measures of sequence similarity are possible, and
software such as BLAST is used routinely to find
sequences similar to a query sequence.
By contrast, the great majority of descriptions of
structure, whether of mechanisms or structures, are not
formal. They are in ordinary technical language, in
some cases augmented with graphical devices such as
interaction diagrams and pictures of key molecular
constituents.
Because it is represented primarily in
natural
language,
most
molecular
biological
knowledge cannot be handled algorithmically. We can
search on amino acid sequence similarity, but we
cannot, e.g., query for “all proteins with structure
similar to degree d to human hemoglobin in the R
state,” and get back proteins that have subunits similar
in number, shape, and inter-relationships to those in R-
state hemoglobin.
The situation is even more problematical with
respect to biological situations and conditions.
The
customary concept of state and its formalization
represents only a narrow subset of the intuition of
biologically important facts or situations, namely those
involving only the values of attributes of objects. The
more general concept, for which we use the term state
of affairs, involves processes, objects, and other
component states of affairs, related in various ways.
When
we
say,
e.g.,
“the
p53
molecule
is
phosphorylated,” or “the DNA is damaged,” we are
identifying states of affairs.
This paper, an expansion of the work in [1],
presents a new formalism for describing biological
mechanisms, structures, and states of affairs that is the
generalization of the concept of structure to the entire
range of processes, structures, and states of affairs
encountered
in
biology.
The
strings
of
letters
representing DNA and protein sequences are special
cases of the formalism.
Using the formalism, new
mathematical formulations of the concept of shape and
structural similarity is developed, one that takes into
account differences in composition and structure at all
levels of detail and applies equally to structures,
mechanisms,
and
inter-constituent
relationships.
Additionally, a new mathematical formulation of
structural complexity is defined.
One goal of this work is the creation of databases
of molecular biological mechanisms, structures, and
states analogous to those we now have for genetic and
protein sequences, and software systems using the new
formulations and other algorithms operating on such
multi-level structural knowledge bases.

2. Specification by constituents and
relationships
We approach the problem of specifying structure
of
processes,
objects,
and
states
of
affairs
by
considering the thing to be described as comprised of
immediate constituents with specific attributes and
inter-constituent relationships (temporal, spatial, or
some other kind), and identifying the constituents and
the
relationships
with
formal
names,
as
in
mathematical logic. (Following standard practice in
mathematical logic, an attribute is formally a one-
place relationship, but here we will, for expository
purposes, identify them separately.) We use the
abstract term “entity” as a cover term for object,
process, or state of affairs. Thus, an entity is specified
by specifying its constituents and the relationships
between them. The relationships are the formalization
of the intuitive idea of structure. Each constituent is
itself an entity, and therefore its structure can be
elaborated with a second ES, and so on, continuing to
any level of description desired.
We term the
approach Entity Specification (ES).
An entity may be an object (structure), process
(mechanism), or states of affairs (the generalization of
state). A state of affairs is an entity whose constituents
may be any set of objects, processes, and other states
of affairs, with the necessary constituent attributes and
inter-constituent relationships. States of affairs allow
the formalization of complex situations, such as the
fact that a p53 molecule is phosphorylated, that the
DNA is damaged, the rate or change in rate of a
reaction, a concentration of a molecular species, etc.
An important case is location: location is an attribute
of a process or object, represented formally as with
any other attribute.
Transport processes thus are
processes represented via the same formalism as other
processes.
Specifications of the entity (process, object, or
state of affairs) are done by identifying the immediate
constituents and the relationships and attributes that
must be present for the item to conform to the
definition, and specifying all constituents, properties,
and relationships with formal names and values. For
example, the customary high-level description of
hemoglobin is that it has two immediate constituents,
which are the two αß subunits, and the angle between
subunits, which has one value in the R state and
another in T.
The subunits are further described as
having two
constituents α1
and
ß1, α2 and
ß2,
respectively. Processes have processes and objects as
constituents: the steps of the process and the elements
involved in it. Constituents of states of affairs may be
processes, objects, or other states of affairs. The core
of an ES is thus a list of the immediate constituents
and
a
list
of
the
n-place
relations
among
the
constituents.
As the hemoglobin example illustrates, a set of
Entity Specifications of an entity is formal and multi-
level. ESs employ the same logical device used in
mathematical logic: the use of formal names that are
expanded by use of structured descriptions employing
other formal names. Names of entities and relations
are formal designators; a formal description of an
entity gives further detail, i.e., its constituents and how
they are structured.
2.1 Entity Specification
An Entity Specification (ES) consists of an
ordered pair (N, D), where:
 N is the (formal) name of the entity including,
optionally, a list of alternate names and/or a
numerical ID.
 D is a set of paradigms, the major varieties or
descriptions of the entity.
DNA transcription
has
two
major
varieties,
eukaroytic
and
prokayotic. In addition, if is often desirable to
specify alternate descriptions due to the state of
knowledge of the phenomenon: conjectures,
possible alternative mechanisms, etc.
The
paradigms are the distinct descriptions of the
entity.
Each paradigm of D is an ordered triple (C, R, E),
where:
 C = {(Ci, Ti)}, in which Ci are the constituents
and Ti is each constituent’s classification, an
element of the set {P, O, S}, representing
“object,”, “process,” or “state.”
 R = {rj} is the set of n-ary relationships that
must hold between the named constituents.
Any relationship may be included, not only
those definable in terms of physical locations
or quantities. Equations specifying quantitative
relationships, including differential equations,
are formal relationship names.
 The constituents and their relationships specify
the
structure
of
the
entity.
Additional
information specifies particular instances of the
entity, by identifying which actual “things”
(processes, objects, and states of affairs) fill the
roles
named
by
the
constituents.
This
information we term the eligibilities for the
entity: E is a set of ordered triples (Cj, i, r), in
which, for each Cj,
o
Cj is the constituent;
o
i is the name of the actual individual;
o
r is the rule, or condition, under which i
takes the role of Cj in the entity N.

2.2 Processes
Processes are multi-step changes in objects and
how
they
are
configured,
i.e.,
the
relationships
between them. In addition, processes may occur in
many versions, i.e., combinations of the stages that are
all ways of the specific process occurring.
To represent this concept formally, the {(Ci, Ti)}
for a process are:
1. Two constituents, specifying the before-state
and after-state.
2. A subset identifying stages, i.e., constituents Cj
in
which
Tj
= P.
Some
stages
may be
accomplished via two or more alternatives;
these alternatives are included in this subset.
3. A subset identifying the objects, i.e., Tj = O.
4. A
subset
identifying
the
versions
of
the
process. Each of these version constituents is a
state of affairs, i.e., Tk = S, and its constituents
are the stages that comprise the version.
The relationships between stages specify those
that happen sequentially, in parallel, overlapping, or in
any other temporal relationships.
The stages are the steps of the process, and the
states are the usual concepts of the before- and after-
states of a process.
2.3 Objects
Objects have only object constituents, and in that
sense are simpler than entities in general or processes;
each constituent of an object is of Type O.
Objects provide clear illustration of multiple
paradigms.
For example, the large subunit of a
ribosome is commonly described as having a roughly
spherical main body and three lobes (i.e., with 3
constituents), but it is also described as comprised of
two rRNA chains (5s, 23s) and a number of proteins.
Fig. 3 shows the ESs of the eukaroytic ribosome and
its constituents’ sub-constituents.
2.4. States of Affairs
States of affairs are the most general kind of
entity, since the constituents may be any object,
process, or other state of affairs.
Since there are no restrictions on the constituents
of a state of affairs, the general Entity Specification of
Sec. 2.1 is the form of a state of affairs. This means
that any entity is formally equivalent to a state of
affairs.
2.5 Examples
The kinds of entities most directly of interest in
biology are mechanisms and structures. We illustrate
mechanism ESs with the ES of cell cycle arrest and
gene transcription, in which the Constituents are
Stages, Versions, and Elements, and the relationships
are the constraints on which Stage must complete
before initiation of the next one.
The eukaryotic
ribosome is used to illustrate structure ESs.
2.5.1 Cell cycle arrest
Fig. 1 shows an Entity Specification of the
process of damaged DNA stopping the cell cycle.
(Formal names similar to ordinary English phrases and
sentences are used, with the notational device of
square-brackets to indicate use of formal Element
names in Stages.)
Stage 4, the general process of gene expression, in
this process specifies production of p21, the Individual
for Element “a protein” (shown in Fig. 1 in brackets).
Thus, what actually occurs is the expression of p21,
the phenomenon to be described.

cycle”
2.5.2 Gene Transcription
Step 4 in Fig. 1 is gene transcription.
Fig, 2
shows, in outline form, the information to be specified
in an ES elaboration of it: 7 ESs, at 4 levels of
specificity, with a total of 25 processes identified. The
top, or overall, level is “a cell produces molecules of a
protein from a gene,” with three stages, which are its
process constituents; Stage 3, with formal name
“Ribosomes translate an mRNA transcript of a gene to
molecules
of
the
protein,”
is
of
course
gene
transcription, with 4 stages.
Cell cycle arrest and gene transcription illustrate a
central feature of ESs and ES methodology, namely
the multi-level logical structure of ESs. Any single ES
presents a full (formal) specification of the process,
object, or state of affairs at that level of detail. Further
detail is specified by further ESs.
The hierarchical specification technique is the
formal analog of the commonly used informal method
for describing complex biological processes, namely a
hierarchical
description
elaborating
the
process
structure in finer and finer detail, beginning with a
high-level description in terms of a small set of large
“steps” and continuing with division of steps into sub-
steps, etc..
The outline form of gene expression in
Fig. 2 is an example of just such a hierarchical
description.

Figure 2: Process of gene expression
(outline form)
Complexity in a process is often due to complex
relationships between stages, such as the initiation of
one stage only upon completion of another stage,
perhaps of an entirely distinct process. Further, often
these conditions involve additional factors of several
kinds, e.g., a combination of a concentration of a
biochemical and the physical location of a ligand. In
these cases the formal expressive power of Entity
Specification, in particular the formal inclusion of any
relationship between constituents, as in mathematical
logic, provides the capability of capturing the actual
condition.
A different and important source of complexity in
biological processes is the common situation in which
the “output” of one process is an input to another. Fig.
1 shows an example: Stage 4 specifies the general
process of gene expression; the particular instance of
this general process is the production of p21, the key
molecule in Stage 5.
Fig. 1 thus illustrates two
additional aspects of Entity Specification as applied to
complex processes: 1) specification of a general
process instantiated to produce a specific result – in
this case, a p21 molecule, and 2) formally specifying
the requirement of the presence of an actual object for
the process to continue.
Thus, Entity Specification
represents formally what one can say informally: “the
p21 gene is expressed, producing a p21 molecule,
which inactivates the cyclin E cdk2 molecule, and so
the cell cycle cannot continue.”
2.5.3 Ribosome structure
We illustrate object Entity Specifications with an
ES
of the
ribosome,
formalizing
the
customary
description into RNA subunits and proteins, and their
constituents in turn, as found, for example, in [11].

Figure 3: ESs of the eukaroytic ribosome and
constituents
This example illustrates two significant aspects of
the use of ESs.
First, just as with ordinary-English
descriptions, completeness is not necessary. ESs may
be used to represent as much as is known of the
structure of the entity, or as much as is desired for the
purpose at hand.
The depiction of the ribosomes in
[11] includes only the constituents and their weights,
and one relationship, namely that the SRSU and LRSU
are adjacent; this is the information formalized in Fig.
3. The 5S RNA constituent is described further only
by noting that it contains 120 nucleotides, without
specifying them, and this formalized by the subobjects
Nucleotide1…Nucleotide120
above.
Other
descriptions of the 5S rRNA constituent of the LRSU
of the eukaroytic ribosome specify the particular
nucleotides; these are formalized by specifying the
nucleotides (A, C, G, U) and their structure with ESs
of the constituents of each: the nitrogenous base, the 5-
carbon sugar, the phosphate groups, and the positional
relationships between them.
Second, it illustrates that there is no single
“correct” Specification of an Entity, represented by
having multiple Paradigms. This is not a deficit of the
ES approach, but is rather a formal representation of
the fact that there are often multiple descriptions of the
same thing. Thus, we find the LRSU described in
terms of the 5S, 28S, and 5.8S rRNA constituents, and
we also find it described in terms of constituents of the
main body, central protuberance, ridge, stalk, and
valley.
Paradigms are the means of formalizing multiple
descriptions of the same thing. This is not simply a
semantic technicality. In the next section, we will
show how to use ESs to mathematically quantify the
concepts of complexity and structural differences, and
the definitions and algorithms are based on the
constituents and relationships in a description, i.e., a
paradigm. To put it differently, there is no such thing
as the “real structure” of an entity – structure,
mechanism, or state of affairs.
Rather, there are
multiple descriptions of the entity, in ordinary English
or formal ESs, and it is only meaningful to compare
descriptions of entities.
This however does not preclude the discovery of a
canonical form of ES, or adoption of standards or
conventions for creation of ESs. It may, for example,
be desirable to adopt conventions for automatically
and uniformly converting protein databases to multi-
level ESs representing their secondary, tertiary, and
quaternary structure.
2.5.4 DNA and protein sequence databases
In
Section
1
we
noted
that
the
string
representations of DNA and protein sequences are
special cases of ESs. In DNA or RNA sequences, the
letters “A,” “C,” “G,” and “T” (or “U”) are the
constituents, and the single relationship is “adjacent.”
In a protein sequence, the constituents are the letters
denoting the amino acids.
In actual sequences, the nucleotides (or amino
acids) have relative positions specified by two angles
and a distance, and in certain cases the more complete
symbolic representation of the sequence including is
useful: N1 (φ1,θ1,d1) N2 (φ2,θ2,d2) N3 ….
In ES
representation of this kind of sequence, the letters are
the constituents and the relationships are the three
φ(x,y), θ(x,y), and d(x,y).
2.6 Algorithms
Any set of complete descriptions of processes and
objects is suitable as the basis of software to analyze
and retrieve information about them. When we have
complete descriptions, it is relatively straightforward
to construct algorithms that answer questions such as:
 How does process P take place, in these
conditions?
o
Identify the version that satisfies all the
necessary relationships ri that must be
satisfied for the constituent stages to take
place
o
Identify
the
specific
individuals
that
serve as each object.
 What happens if process P does not take place?
o
Find all processes Q in which there is a
relationship ri stating that stage Z of Q
can occur only if P has occurred.
 What happens if there are none of object O
(such as with knockout experiments)?
6
International Journal On Advances in Life Sciences, vol 1 no 1, year 2009, http://www.iariajournals.org/life_sciences/

o
Find all processes P in which O is an
individual for element E in stage Z.
Since no O is available, Z cannot occur,
so all versions of P including Z cannot
occur, and if there is no version of P
without Z, P itself cannot occur.
These algorithms were successfully implemented and
tested in [3].
Things are much more difficult when there is
partial information at multiple levels. Many, perhaps
most, molecular and cellular processes and structures
are not fully understood down to the individual
molecule level. This requires formal specifications
integrating
descriptions
(knowledge)
at
multiple
levels,
and
algorithms
designed
to
operate
on
incomplete specifications at multiple levels.
ESs
appear to be the first formalization designed for this
multiple-level representation task.
Several software
systems
implementing
algorithms
for
the
above
queries,
and
others,
have
been
built
based
ES
knowledge bases [2, 3].
3. Measuring Similarity and Complexity
Biologists routinely use concepts of complexity
and similarity of structures and processes in analyzing
situations, looking for related structures and processes,
and formulating research questions.
However, these
concepts have, until now, only been articulated in an
intuitive, rather than a formal, way and as a result
researchers have not been able to use them directly.
For example, it would seem obviously valuable to be
able to query a database for enzymes similar to a given
one, similar at all levels of structure.
Retrieval by
similarity – the ability to do BLAST searches – is the
heart of the value of DNA and protein databases, but
such
searches
are
limited
to
primary
sequence
similarity.
In this section we use the ES formulation to
mathematically define the concepts of complexity and
similarity of any two entities. This makes possible the
quantification
of
similarity
between
structures,
processes, or states of affairs that reflects structural
differences at every level, not only primary sequence
similarity.
We first define the structural complexity of an
Entity A, with N constituents A1, ...,AN and K
relationships, recursively as:
N
SC(A) =
N2 + K 2
+ ε ∙ ∑   SC(Ai)2
(1)
i=1
ε
is
an
experimentally-determined
multiplier
modulating the impact of complexity of constituents,
sub-constituents, etc.
In formally defining a similarity measure on pairs
of arbitrary entities, such as biological structures or
constituents of them, we want to take into account the
following intuitions:
 The
measure
should
be
responsive
to
differences
in
attributes
of
the
entities
themselves.
 The measure should be responsive to similarity
of structure. Structure differences in an entity
are
represented
by
having
different
relationships among constituents, or in having
relationships to a different degree.
 When structure of the constituents of the
entities is known, the similarity between A and
B should reflect the similarity of the their
respective constituents.
Accordingly, we define the structural distance
between two entities in terms of the difference of (1)
the properties of the constituents, and (2) how much
the relationships between the constituents differ, as
follows:
Assume we have two entities A and B whose
structural similarity is to be calculated. Denote the
constituents of A and B by A1, ..., ANA and B1, …,
BNB, respectively.
Let the properties of A and B of
interest be p1,…,pM. Denote the relationships between
A-constituents by r1, ..., rK, and those between B-
constituents by rK+1, ..., rK+L.
First, re-order the constituents of A in order of
decreasing complexity, as measured by Formula (1),
and similarly with the constituents of B.
We
represent
the
properties
of
A- and
B-
constituents
in
a
Property
Matrix
P,
and
the
relationships between constituents with a Relationship
Matrix R. P is defined as follows:
 P has M columns (one for each property of
interest).
 Let the top NA rows of P represent the
constituents of A, in order, and the next NB
rows represent the constituents of B, in order.
 The matrix entries are the values of each
constituent on each property pi.
 If a constituent does not have property pi, that
matrix entry is blank.
7
International Journal On Advances in Life Sciences, vol 1 no 1, year 2009, http://www.iariajournals.org/life_sciences/

Figure 4: The Property Matrix P
P now represents the properties of interest of the
A- and B-constituents.
In order to meaningfully
compare
numerical
values
representing
disparate
properties, the value of P
must be normalized.
Accordingly,
 If any column has a value < 0, re-scale the
values of the column by adding the absolute
value of the minimum value of the column to
each value in it.
This makes the minimum
value of each column 0.
 Normalize the values of P to the range 1 to 10,
by setting
pi(Aj) = 10 * (pi(Aj) + 1) / (pmaxi+1),
where pmaxi is the maximum value of column i.
(The value of 10 is an empirically-determined,
selected to emphasize the relative importance of
property differences compared to the number of
constituents.)
 Set each empty entry of P to 0.
The values of the property matrix P are now
between 0 and 10, 0 indicating the component does
not have the property of that column, and 1 being the
minimum actual property value.
We can now define the property distance between
any A- and B-constituents, Ai and Bj, by using the
Euclidean distance between the corresponding A- and
B- rows of P:
M
PD(A, B) =
∑  (pk(Ai) – pk(Bj))2
(2)
i=1
Since the rows of P representing properties of A-
constituents are sorted in order of most-complex-first,
as are the rows of P representing properties of B-
constituents, we have a consistent procedure for
deciding which A-constituent and B-constituent to
compare.
For example, if we are calculating the
structural similarity of the ribosomes of two species,
the
calculated
value
would
differ
significantly
depending on whether the two large subunits and two
small subunits are compared, rather than the large
subunits being compared to the small, and the ordering
ensures that the large are compared to the large, etc.
We now use a similar matrix technique to
calculate similarity based on structure, rather than
properties. Structure is specified by relationships
between A- or B-constituents, each relationship rj
being represented
by an
ordered
n-tuples. Each
relationship has a specific value. For example, in R-
state hemoglobin, the angle between the α1β1 and α2β2
dimers is 15°. Thus, the relationship has the formal
name “angle,” and angle(α1β1, α2β2) = 15.
Denoting the number of A-tuples by NAT, and the
number of B-tuples by NBT, we define R as follows:
 R has K+L columns, one for each relationship.
 Each row of R represents one tuple of A- or B-
constituents, so there are NAT+NBT rows.
 The matrix entries are the values of the
relationships have on the tuples. For example,
the entry for the matrix at the row (α1β1, α2β2),
column “angle,” is 15.
 If a tuple does not have relationship rk, the
corresponding entry of the matrix is blank.
Figure 5: The Relationship Matrix R
The values of R must be normalized in order to be
able to make meaningful calculations with the values,
as were the values of P:
 If any column has a value < 0, re-scale the
values of the column by adding the absolute
value of the minimum value of the column to
each value in it.
 Normalize the values of R to the range 1 to 10,
by setting
ri(Aj) = 10 * (ri(Aj) + 1) / (rmaxi+1) ),
where rmaxi is the maximum value of column i.
(As with P, 10 is an empirically-determined
value
chosen
to
emphasize
the
relative
importance
of
relationship
differences
compared to number of constituents.)
 Set each empty entry of R to 0.
The
A-constituent and B-constituent rows of P
are
ordered,
to
ensure
a
consistent
calculation
procedure. It is necessary to have a consistent scheme

for calculating the Euclidean distance between rows of
R as well, for much the same reason. Therefore, for
any A-tuple taj, let tbκ(j) denotes the B-tuple closest to
taj, using Euclidean distance, i.e., the B-tuple most
similar to taj.
We can now define the total distance between two
Entities A and B in terms of the property distance and
the structural distance:
TD(A, B) =
PD(A, B)2 + SD(A, B)2
(3)
The structural distance SD(A, B) is defined
recursively, using the matrix R, as follows:
Let MC = max(NA, NB) and MT = max(NAT,
NBT). Then if both A and B have Descriptions, i.e.,
specified constituents and relationships, we define the
structural distance SD as
MC
SD(A, B) =
(NA–NB)2 + ∑  PD(Ai, B i)2 +
i=1
MT K+L
∑   ∑ ( ri(taj) – ri(tbκ(j))) 2 +
j=1 i=1
MC
δ ∙ ∑  SD(Ai, Bi)2
(4)
i=1
If NA > NB, PD(Ai, Bi) = PD(Ai, 0 ) for i > NA,
and similarly if NB > MC.
If NAT > NBT, ri(tbj) = 0 for NBT < j <= NAT,
and similarly if NBT > NAT.
If NA > NB, there is no B-constituent to for the
A-constituent, so SD(Ai, Bi) = SC(Ai,), for
NB < i <= NA, and similarly if NB > NA.
If either A or B have no Description, SD(A, B) =
0.
δ is an experimentally-determined discount factor
reflecting the relative importance of the distance
between constituents of A and B. (As with ε,
preliminary work indicates a value of approximately
0.7 for δ.)
Intuitively,
 PD(Ai, Bi) measures similarity of properties of
each pair of constituents.
K+L

∑ ( ri(taj) – ri(tbj)) 2 measures how much the
i=1
constituents of A and B differ on relationship
MT K+L
ri; and the sum ∑   ∑ ( ri(taj) – ri(tbκ(j))) 2
j=1 i=1
measures the total difference in structures A
and B, as articulated
by the relationships ri
between A- and B-constituents.
If A and B are the same except for differing only
in
names
of
constituents
and
relationships
(mathematically, are isomorphic), TD(A, B) = 0.
As the properties of A and B, the number of their
constituents, the properties of the constituents, the
structure of A and B, and the substructures of A and B
diverge, TD(A, B) increases.
3.1 Examples
We illustrate the calculation of SD with two
examples: the simple structures H20 and NH3, and the
more complex case of eukaryotic and prokaryotic
ribosomes, which illustrates the recursive calculation
and the application of the measure in the presence of
incomplete information.
3.1.1. Structural Similarity of H20 and NH3
For the purposes of this example, we ignore PD(H20,
NH3), so TD(H20, NH3) = SD(H20, NH3), i.e., we
calculate similarity due solely to structural differences
between H20 and NH3. We assume that the properties
of interest are atomic mass and electronegativity, and
the relationships of interest are distance D and bond
angle α between the central atom and non-central ones.
(This example illustrates the fact that TD may be
considered a class of measures rather than a single
one, for the particular similarity values will depend on
the
properties
and
relationships
included
in
the
calculation. Choice of properties and relationships
depends on the particular application.)
We suppose that the member attributes of interest
in this case are atomic mass and electronegativity of
the constituents, which give the P and R matrices
shown in Tables 1 and 2:

the pairs of most similar rows are adjacent results in

Denoting the eu- and prokaryotic ribosomes Rib-
eu and Rib-pro, from (3) we have
TD(Ribeu, Ribpro) =
PD(Rib-eu, Rib-pro)2 + SD(Rib-eu, Rib-pro)2 =
4.052 + SD(Rib-eu, Rib-pro)2
=
16.38 + SD(Rib-eu, Rib-pro)2
Calculating SD(Rib-eu, Rib-pro) from (4), we
have MC = 2 and ∑ ∑ ( ri(taj) – ri(tbκ(j))) 2 = 0 because
the only constituent relationship is adjacency, which is
true of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic ribosomes.
Setting δ = 0.7, we have SD(Rib-eu, Rib-pro) =
From the normalized P matrix, the term
2
∑  PD(Rib-eui, Rib-pro i)2
i=1
= 4.32 + 3.62 = 31.1.
2
The term ∑  SD(Rib-eui, Rib-proi)2
i=1
= SD((LRSU-eu, LRSU-pro)2 +
SD(SRSU-eu, SRSU-pro)2
Again from (4), SD(LRSU-eu, LRSU-pro) =
The term ∑PD(LRSU-eui, LRSU-pro
i)2
= 0,
because the ESs here (which are a formalization of the
description in [11]) do not include properties of the
constituents of the LRSU.
52
The term ∑  SD(LRSU-eui, LRSU-pro i)2
i=1
becomes SD(28S, 23S)2 + SD(5.8S, 5S) 2 + SD(5S, 0)2
+ 34*0 + 15*1, because the proteins of the prokaryotic
LRSU correspond to 34 of the 49 of the proteins in the
eukaryotic LRSU and there is no further specification
of those proteins. (Were there such specifications, as
there would be with a specification of the ribosomes’
structure down to the amino acid or atom level, these
terms would not be 0.) The only specification of
structure of the rRNA constituents of the LRSU are
the numbers of nucleotides in them, so SD(28S, 23S)2
+ SD(5.8S, 5S)2 + SD(5S, 0)2 = (4700-2900)2 + (160-
120)2 + 1202 = 3,256,000, and SD(LRSU-eu, LRSU-
pro) =1509.8.
Similarly, SD(SRSU-eu, SRSU-pro) =

64 + 0.7* SD(18S, 16S) 2 = 360.1.
Thus, SD(Rib-eu, Rib-pro) =
0 + 31.1 + 0.7*(1509.8 + 360.1) = 114.5, and
TD(Ribeu, Ribpro) =
16.38 + SD(Rib-eu, Rib-pro)2
=
16.38 + 114.5
= 11.4
3.2 Discussion
It was noted above (Sec. 2.5.3) that there is no
single
correct
description
of
an
entity.
Correspondingly, there is no single “correct” value of
TD or SD. Rather, as we have seen in the ribosome
example, the calculation depends on the particular
properties and relationships chosen as the basis of the
calculation, and on the information represented in the
particular ESs used, which may reflect information
either omitted or unknown. Thus, in use, a researcher
first specifies the properties and relationships of
interest in the particular investigation, and
uses
structural
similarity
search
to
find
structures,
mechanisms, etc. similar in those terms. For example,
it may be of value to find structures with a similar
number
of
constituents
in
similar
positional
relationships, without regard to net charge on the
overall structure, or structures very similar in shape (as
measured
by
similarity
of
angle
and
position
relationships)
but
ignoring
the
properties
of
a
particular constituent. Or, as in ribosome example, the
question of interest may be, “How similar are enzymes
A and B in high-level structure, ignoring the fine
structure of the proteins in each?”
The work of building large knowledge bases of
comprised
of
Entity
Specification
of
biological
knowledge is in its initial stages, and work on building
tools to support the creation of ESs is also in its initial
stages. Because there are many possible descriptions
of
an
entity,
creating
ESs
that
are
accurate
formalizations
of
existing,
informal,
descriptions
requires some expertise in biology.
This means the
work must be done by people with some training in
biology, or in collaboration with them. Experience to
date, however, indicates that producing good ESs does
not require professional-level expertise.
4. Relationship to other work
Entity
specifications
are
based
on
the
“representation formats” of P. G. Ossorio, the Object
Unit, Process Unit, and State of Affairs Unit [2]. The
representations formats, especially the Process Unit,
were the basis of several successful computer systems
implementing
the
algorithms
enumerated
at
the
beginning of Sec. 2.6.
These included a number of
query systems [3] and LDS/UCC, a large system to
actually carry out the processes specified [4].
The
LDS/UCC system shows the applicability of ESs to
simulation,
especially
when
knowledge
of
the
structures and processes is incomplete and at multiple
levels of detail, as is commonly the case in biology.
Representation formats have a clear similarity to
frames, but are a substantial refinement of the concept
of frame. The most important distinction is that the
constituents of ES are those that must be present by
definition of the entity, whereas a frame is defined
simply as “things commonly found together” [5], or as
in Protégé [7], a related concept. (Interestingly, while
clearly
a
refinement
of
frames,
Ossorio’s
work
predates the introduction of frames by several years
[6].)
Entity Specifications may be viewed as a
rigorous
version
of
frames,
combined
with
the
mathematical
logic
approach
to
inclusion
of
relationships.
Class hierarchies, i.e., ontologies, are the most
common representation of biological knowledge. As
we have seen, a set of ESs specifying an entity at
multiple levels of detail is a hierarchy, and thus a set
of ESs has a superficial resemblance to an ontology.
However,
the
resemblance
is
only
superficial,
specifically in that both ontologies and ESs are
hierarchically structured. Ontologies are designed to
represent
class
membership
and
inheritance
information; ESs are designed to represent structure.
In an ontology, a child node represents a particular
kind of the parent node, and members of the sub-class
inherit attributes defined on the super-class; in ESs, a
child node represents a constituent of the larger entity.
Properties of entities and relationships between them
are not inherited by their constituents. Thus, both the
information represented and the fundamental concept
denoted by the parent-child relationship in the node
hierarchy are entirely different.
While relational or
attribute knowledge are often included in ontologies,
the relations and attributes are any of interest, not
those that define the items and its structure.
Frame-based systems such as Protege can be used
to define an ontology, but a slot in a Protege frame is
not the same as a constituent of an entity. While using
frames, descriptions using Protege are nonetheless
ontologies, and thus represent class hierarchies, not
constituents and inter-constituent relationships.
Some ontologies, such as Gene Ontology [8],
include
a
specific
relationship,
part_of,
which
specifies that one item is part of another. This is the
12
International Journal On Advances in Life Sciences, vol 1 no 1, year 2009, http://www.iariajournals.org/life_sciences/

same concept as that of entity being a constituent of
another.
The difference between GO and ES is that
while both provide a mechanism for specifying that
one item is part of another, only ES provides
mechanisms for specifying the other facts about the
parts: how the parts are related (the set of n-ary
relationships {rj}) and eligibilities {(Cj, i, r)} that
specify rules for which actual thing i may serve in the
role of each constituent Cj. For example, in both GO
and ES we can specify formally that α1β1 and α2β2 are
parts (constituents) of hemoglobin, but in ES we can
also specify formally that angle between the α1β1 and
α2β2 is 15°.
Since structure is defined by the
relationships {rj }, this means ES provides the formal
mechanism for specifying all aspects of structures and
mechanisms, rather than the bare fact that one thing is
a part of another.
The GO relationship is_a allows definition of
class hierarchies; and regulates, positively_regulates
and
negatively_regulates,
identify
inter-process
relationships. These are the only relationships in GO.
Entity
Specification
incorporates
the
formal
specification of any relationship, as in mathematical
logic. GO relationships are therefore special cases or
instances of ES relationships.
Peleg et al [9] integrates hierarchical process
descriptions
and
participant-role
logic,
using
organization workflow models combined with the
Tambis [10] ontology to model biological processes.
Tambis has the difficulties of any ontology: the only
relationships that can be represented in it are those
derivable from the pre-defined base relationships
combined by subset/superset and “is part of.”
Certain of the concepts in this paper were also
presented in [12], in the context of applications in the
social sciences.
