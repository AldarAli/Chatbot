Abstract—When Atanssov created Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets, he
imposed the condition that the sum of membership and non-
membership values for each point in the universe of discourse
should be less than or equal to one. We challenge this constraint
and deﬁne some new types of Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets such that,
for any point in the universe of discourse, the sum of membership
and non-membership values can be greater than one, or their
difference can be negative or positive, while one value is greater
than the other, or the sum of their squares is less than or equal
to one.
Keywords-Intuitionistic fuzzy set, Interval-valued fuzzy sets.
I. INTRODUCTION
Fuzzy Sets concept was introduced by Zadeh [1] in
1965. Given an non-empty universe of discourse X, one
can deﬁne a fuzzy set A based on its membership function
µA : X → [0, 1], that is A is a set with ‘vague boundary’
when compared with crisp sets, where µA : X → {0, 1}. Of
course, the bigger the value of µA(x) is, the greater the degree
of membership of x to A is, so µA(x) = 1 represents the full
membership of x to A.
In 1983, Atanassov generalized the concept of fuzzy set
by using two membership functions for the elements of the
universe of discourse. The English version appeared in 1986
[2].
Deﬁnition 1. Let X be an non-empty universe of dis-
course. An (Atanassov’s) Initutionistic Fuzzy
Set (AIFS or IFS) is described by:
A = {(x, µA(x), νA(x)) | x ∈ X}
(1)
where µA is used to deﬁne the degree of membership (mem-
bership function) and νA is used to deﬁne the degree of non-
membership (non-membership function) of x to A
µA : X → [0, 1]
νA : X → [0, 1]
(2)
satisfying the condition
0 ≤ µA(x) + νA(x) ≤ 1, ∀x ∈ X
(3)
The word intuitionistic was added to suggest that
the principle of excluded middle does not hold, so to say
µA(x) + νA(x) = 1 is not true for all x ∈ X if one interprets
ν as a sort of negation of µ. Some operations on IFSs have
been also introduced in [2]:

Deﬁnition 2. Given two IFSs A and B over an universe of
discourse X, one can deﬁne the following relations:
A ⊂ B iff ∀x ∈ X µA(x) ≤ µB(x) and νA(x) ≥ νB(x)
A = B iff A ⊂ B and B ⊂ A
as well as the following operations [2]:
¯A = {(x, νA(x), µA(x) | x ∈ X}
A ∩ B = {(x, µA∩B(x), νA∩B(x)) | x ∈ X}, where
µA∩B(x) = min{µA(x), µB(x)} and
νA∩B(x) = max{νA(x), νB(x)}
A ∪ B = {(x, µA∪B(x), νA∪B(x)) | x ∈ X}, where
µA∪B(x) = max{µA(x), µB(x)}, and
νA∪B(x) = min{νA(x), νB(x)}
A + B = {(x, µA+B(x), νA+B(x)) | x ∈ X}, where
µA+B(x) = µA(x) + µB(x) − µA(x) · µB(x), and
νA+B(x) = νA(x) · νB(x)
A · B = {(x, µA·B(x), νA·B(x)) | x ∈ X}, where
µA·B(x) = µA(x) · µB(x), and
νA·B(x) = νA(x) + νB(x) − νA(x) · νB(x)
In [2] it is proved that the operations ∩ and ∪ are commu-
tative, associative, distributive among themselves, idempotent
and satisfy De Morgan’s law; the operations + and · are
commutative, associative, satisfy De Morgan’s law, and are
distributive with respect to ∩ and ∪.
To measure hesitancy of membership of an element to a
intuitionistic fuzzy set, Atanassov [2] used a third function.

Deﬁnition 3. Given an IFS A = {(x, µA(x), νA(x)) | x ∈ X}
over an non-empty universe of discourse X, the degree of
indeterminacy of x to A is given by
πA(x) = 1 − µA(x) − νA(x)
(4)
The function π(x) is also called the intuitionistic
fuzzy index, the hesitancy, or the ignorance
degree of x to A. Clearly, 0 ≤ πA(x) ≤ 1, ∀x ∈ X.
If πA(x) = 0, ∀x ∈ X, then ν(x) = 1 − µ(x) and the
intuitionistic fuzzy set A is reduced to an ordinary fuzzy set
A:
A = {(x, µA(x), 1 − µA(x)) | x ∈ X}
(5)
Some authors (Yusoff et al. [3], Zeng and Li [4]) consider
that the third parameter π(x) cannot be omitted from the
deﬁnition of an AIFS:
A = {(x, µA(x), νA(x), πA(x)) | x ∈ X}
(6)
and so an AIFS can be depicted as in Figure 2. A line parallel
to the µA(x) + νA(x) = 1 diagonal describes a crisp set of
elements x with the same level of hesitancy to A.

IFSs are not a trivial generalization of ordinary Fuzzy Sets
(FS) because they can be represented in the form [A, B],
where A and B are ordinary fuzzy sets or, even more, one
can deﬁne modal operators necessity and possibility over IFS
(see Atanassov [5]):
□A = {(x, µA(x), 1 − µA(x)) |x ∈ X}

(12)
while in ordinary fuzzy sets we have
□A = A = ♦A
(13)
Of course, all FS results can be easily generalized for IFS.
Deschrijver and Kerre ( [6], [7]) proved that AIFSs can also
be seen as L-fuzzy sets in the sense of Goguen [8] by taking
the lattice ⋆L = {(x1, x2) ∈ [0, 1]2 | x1 + x2 ≤ 1} with the
partial order ≤⋆L deﬁned as
(x1, x2) ≤⋆L (y1, y2) ⇐⇒ x1 ≤ y1 ∧ x2 ≥ y2
In [6] it is proved that (⋆L, ≤⋆L) is a complete and bounded
lattice with the smallest element 0⋆L = (0, 1) and the greatest
element 1⋆L = (1, 0). This lattice (and the similar ones we’ll
introduce later in this section) can then be used to deﬁne
intuitionistic fuzzy negation [9]:
Deﬁnition 4. A function N : L → L, where N is strictly
decreasing, continuous, and N(0L) = 1L, N(1L) = 0L is
called an intuitionistic fuzzy negation.
N is a strong fuzzy negation if it is involutive, that is
N(N (x)) = x holds for all x ∈ L.
Recall that a function ϕ : [0, 1] → [0, 1] that is continuous
and strictly increasing, such that ϕ(0) = 0 and ϕ(1) = 1, is
called automorphism.
Deschrijver and Kerre [6] also proved that any strong
intuitionistic fuzzy negation N is characterised by a strong
negation N : [0, 1] → [0, 1] such that, for all (x1, x2) ∈ L,
N(x1, x2) = (N(1−x2), 1−N(x1)). Trillas et al. [10] proved
that N : [0, 1] → [0, 1] is a strong negation if and only if
there exists an automorphism ϕ of the unit interval such that
N(x) = ϕ−1(1 − ϕ(x)).
II. GENERALISED INTUITIONISTIC FUZZY SETS
In the sequel, let X be a non-empty set and let us consider
A = {(x, µA(x), νA(x)) | x ∈ X}, where µA : X → [0, 1] and
νA : X → [0, 1], are used to deﬁne the degree of membership
and the degree of non-membership, respectively, of x to A.
Given an element x ∈ X, the condition µ(x) + ν(x) ≤ 1
included in the deﬁnition of AIFSs suggests that if one of the
two membership/non-membership functions has a big value
(close to 1), the other function should have a very small
value (close to 0) such that their sum is less than one. But
it is possible that both functions have small values, that is
membership degree and non-membership degree are quite
insigniﬁcant. As one can see on Figure 1, both µ(x) and ν(x)
have small values (less than 0.5) in the square with opposite
corners (0; 0) and (0.5; 0.5) and only one of them has a big
value (bigger than 0.5) in the two remaining triangles. The two
cases are equal possible, in the sense that they cover surfaces
of same size. The deﬁnition of an AIFS shows proneness to
many generalisations. Atanassov’s deﬁnition assumes that the
membership and non-membership functions must have their
sum smaller than or equal to one for every element of the
universe of discourse. While it is a good hypothesis in many
practical situations, there are cases when this constraint does
not work and it must be replaced by other relations.
The deﬁnition of an AIFS shows proneness to many gen-
eralisations. A ﬁrst extension was proposed by T. K. Mondal
and S. K. Samanta [11], where the functions µ and ν satisfy
the condition µ(x)∧ν(x) ≤ 0.5, ∀x ∈ X. A second extension
to both Atanassov and Mondal-Samanta models was proposed

by H.C. Liu [12], by using a constant L ∈ [0, 1] such that
the functions µ and ν satisfy the condition µ(x) + ν(x) ≤
1 + L, ∀x ∈ X and L ∈ [0, 1].
The main contribution of this paper is the replacement of
the original Atanassov relation by some other conditions. We
think that both functions can take any values in [0, 1] as long
as the ignorance degree of x to A is non-negative and less than
or equal to one (after we reshape it in an appropriate way).
The condition 0 ≤ µA(x) + νA(x) ≤ 1, ∀x ∈ X is just a
choice and it can be replaced by others. If Atanassov’s original
deﬁnition dealt with the left bottom triangle of the unit square,
we will consider all four right angle triangles in the unit
square (with the right angle a corner of the square), plus some
other combinations of them, obtained by combining triangles
between the square’s diagonals, as well as the inscribed circle
in the square. Therefore, our ﬁrst generalisation (GAIFS1) is
given by:
Deﬁnition 5. Let X be a non-empty universe of discourse.
Then a generalised Atanassov intuitionistic fuzzy set (GAIFS1)
is described by A = {(x, µA(x), νA(x)) | x ∈ X}, where the
membership/non-membership functions µA : X → [0, 1] and
νA : X → [0, 1] satisfy the condition
µ(x) + ν(x) ≥ 1, ∀x ∈ X
(14)
The degree of indeterminacy of x to A is deﬁned as
πA(x) = µA(x) + νA(x) − 1
(15)
and, once again, clearly 0 ≤ πA(x) ≤ 1, ∀x ∈ X.
If πA(x) = 0, ∀x ∈ X then ν(x) = 1 − µ(x) and the
intuitionistic fuzzy set A is reduced to an ordinary fuzzy set
A = {(x, µA(x), 1 − µA(x)) | x ∈ X}.

First (GAIFS1) new deﬁnition of an AIFS
If we take the set
L⋆ = {(x1, x2) ∈ [0, 1]2 | x1 + x2 ≥ 1}
with the partial order ≤L⋆ deﬁned as
(x1, x2) ≤L⋆ (y1, y2) ⇐⇒ x1 ≥ y1 ∧ x2 ≤ y2
and , for each A ⊂ L⋆, we deﬁne:
sup A
=
(inf{x1 ∈ [0, 1] | ∃x2 ∈ [0, 1], (x1, x2) ∈ A},
sup{x2 ∈ [0, 1] | ∃x1 ∈ [0, 1], (x1, x2) ∈ A})
inf A
=
(sup{x1 ∈ [0, 1] | ∃x2 ∈ [0, 1], (x1, x2) ∈ A},
inf{x2 ∈ [0, 1] | ∃x1 ∈ [0, 1], (x1, x2) ∈ A})
then (L, ≤L⋆) is a complete lattice. The lattice can be deﬁned
as an algebraic structure (L⋆, ∧, ∨) where the meet and join
operators are deﬁned respectively
(x1, x2) ∧ (y1, y2)
=
(max(x1, y1), min(x2, y2))
(x1, x2) ∨ (y1, y2)
=
(min(x1, y1), max(x2, y2))
The smallest element is 0L⋆ = (1, 0) and the greatest element
is 1L⋆ = (0, 1). Therefore, an GAIFS1 A is a L-fuzzy set
whose L-membership function χA ∈ (L⋆)X = {χ : X → L⋆}
is deﬁned such that for each x ∈ X, χA(x) = (µA(x), νA(x)).
The shaded area in Figure 4 is the set of elements x = (x1, x2)
belonging to L⋆.

New Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set as a L-fuzzy Set
The order ≤L⋆ of L⋆ induces a natural partial order on
(L⋆)X: given χA, χB ∈ (L⋆)X, we say that χA ≤L⋆ χB if
and only if χA(x) ≤L⋆ χB(x) for all x ∈ X.
Thus, ((L⋆)X, ≤L⋆) is a bounded and complete lattice in
which the least and greatest elements are χ0L⋆ and χ1L⋆,
respectively. Of course, χ0L⋆(x) = 0L⋆ and χ1L⋆(x) = 1L⋆,
for all x ∈ X. The same considerations apply to all other L
lattices we will deﬁne in the sequel. By using
A ⊂ B iff ∀x ∈ X µA(x) ≥ µB(x) and νA(x) ≤ νB(x)
all AIFS original operations can be re-written for GAIFS1.
The second generalisation (GAIFS2) is given by:
Deﬁnition 6. Let X be a non-empty universe of discourse.
Then a generalised Atanassov intuitionistic fuzzy set (GAIFS2)
is described by A = {(x, µA(x), νA(x)) | x ∈ X}, where the
membership/non-membership functions µA : X → [0, 1] and
νA : X → [0, 1] satisfy the condition
µ(x) ≤ ν(x), ∀x ∈ X

Second (GAIFS2) new deﬁnition of an AIFS
The corresponding complete lattice in this case is
⋆L = {(x1, x2) ∈ [0, 1]2 | x1 ≤ x2}
with the partial order ≤⋆L deﬁned as
(x1, x2) ≤⋆L (y1, y2) ⇐⇒ x1 ≤ y1 ∧ x2 ≤ y2
As described by Deschrijver in [13], if x = (x1, x2) ∈ ⋆L,
then the length x2 − x1 is called the uncertainty and is
denoted by xπ. The interval [x1, x2] gives the “range between
a pessimistic and an optimistic truth evaluation of a propo-
sition” [13]. The smallest and the largest elements in ⋆L are
0⋆L = (0, 0) and 1⋆L = (1, 1), respectively. By using
A ⊂ B iff ∀x ∈ X µA(x) ≤ µB(x) and νA(x) ≤ νB(x)
all AIFS original operations can be re-written for GAIFS2.
The third generalisation (GAIFS3) is given by:
Deﬁnition 7. Let X be a non-empty universe of discourse.
Then a generalised Atanassov intuitionistic fuzzy set (GAIFS3)
is described by A = {(x, µA(x), νA(x)) | x ∈ X}, where the
membership/non-membership functions µA : X → [0, 1] and
νA : X → [0, 1] satisfy the condition
µ(x) ≥ ν(x), ∀x ∈ X
(18)
The degree of indeterminacy of x to A is deﬁned as
πA(x) = µA(x) − νA(x)
(19)
The corresponding complete lattice in this case is
L⋆ = {(x1, x2) ∈ [0, 1]2 | x1 ≥ x2}
with the partial order ≤L⋆ deﬁned as
(x1, x2) ≤L⋆ (y1, y2) ⇐⇒ x1 ≥ y1 ∧ x2 ≥ y2
The interval [x2, x1] gives, once again, the “range between
a pessimistic and an optimistic truth evaluation of a proposi-
tion”, as stated in [13]. The smallest and the largest elements
in L⋆ are 0L⋆ = (1, 1) and 1L⋆ = (0, 0), respectively.

membership/non-membership functions µA : X → [0, 1] and
νA : X → [0, 1] satisfy the condition
µ(x) ≥ ν(x), and µ(x) + ν(x) ≥ 1, or

Deﬁnition 9. Let X be a non-empty universe of discourse.
Then a generalised Atanassov intuitionistic fuzzy set (GAIFS5)
is described by A = {(x, µA(x), νA(x)) | x ∈ X}, where the

νA : X → [0, 1] satisfy the condition
µ(x) ≤ ν(x), and µ(x) + ν(x) ≥ 1, or

νA : X → [0, 1] satisfy the condition
µ2(x) + ν2(x) ≤ 1, ∀x ∈ X
(22)
III. GENERALISED INTERVAL-VALUED FUZZY SETS
Interval-valued fuzzy sets were introduced by Zadeh [14],
Grattan-Guiness [15], Jahn [16], and Sambuc [17]. Because it
is hard in real life problems to assign a precise membership
degree to elements in fuzzy sets, this was replaced by an
interval [µ1, µ2], with 0 ≤ µ1 ≤ µ2 ≤ 1 to which the
membership degree belongs. The length of the interval is
a measure of uncertainty of the membership of an element
x ∈ X to an interval-valued fuzzy set (IVFS) A. It is similar to
the degree of indeterminacy of x to A in AIFS. The FS (AIFS)
standard operations (union, intersection, complementation) can
be extended to IVFS in the canonical way. If M = [µ1, µ2]
and N = [ν1, ν2] are two IVFS, then for all x ∈ X
(M ∩ N)(x) = [min(µ1(x), ν1(x)), min(µ2(x), ν2(x))] (23)
(M ∪ N)(x) = [max(µ1(x), ν1(x)), max(µ2(x), ν2(x))] (24)
¯
M(x) = [1 − µ2(x), 1 − µ1(x)] (25)
The equivalence between AIFS and IVFS has been studied
in [18] and [6]. If A = [µ1, µ2], 0 ≤ µ1 ≤ µ2 ≤ 1 then
µ1 − µ2 ≤ 0 so µ1 + 1 − µ2 ≤ 1. By deﬁning µ1 = µ and
ν = 1 − µ2, we obtain an AIFS. Conversely, starting with
an AIFS A = (µ, ν), µ + ν ≤ 1 , we can create the interval
[µ, 1 − ν] to correspond to an IVFS.
In the case of our ﬁrst generalisation (GAIFS1), where
µ(x) + ν(x) ≥ 1 for all x ∈ X, the above equivalence still
holds. If A = [µ1, µ2], 0 ≤ µ1 ≤ µ2 ≤ 1 then 0 ≤ µ2 − µ1
so 1 ≤ µ2 + 1 − µ1 and, by deﬁning µ = 1 − µ1 and ν = µ2,
we obtain an AIFS.
The above equivalence also holds trivially for GAIFS2,
GAIFS3, GAIFS4, and GAIFS5 generalizations. For instance,
in the case of GAIFS2, µ(x) ≤ ν(x), so the corresponding
IVFS should be characterised by [µ, ν]. In the case of GAIFS3,
ν(x) ≤ µ(x) holds, so the corresponding IVFS should be
characterised by [ν, µ], etc. For GAIFS6 case, we take the
IVFS to be given by the interval [µ, 1−ν]. Then µ2 ≤ (1−ν)2
and µ2+ν2 ≤ (1−ν)2+ν2 ≤ 1−2ν+2ν2 ≤ 1+2ν(ν−1) ≤ 1.
IV. AUTOMORPHISMS
We deal with our ﬁrst generalization GAIFS1 only, the other
cases are treated in a similar way. GAIFS1 is equivalent to the
lattice (L⋆, ∧, ∨, 0L⋆, 1L⋆), where
L⋆ = {(x1, x2) ∈ [0, 1]2 | x1 + x2 ≥ 1}
with the partial order ≤L⋆ deﬁned as
(x1, x2) ≤L⋆ (y1, y2) ⇐⇒ x1 ≥ y1 ∧ x2 ≤ y2
and 0L⋆ = (1, 0) and 1L⋆ = (0, 1). The operations are deﬁned
as
(x1, x2) ∧ (y1, y2) = (x1 ∨ y1, x2 ∧ y2)
(26)
(x1, x2) ∨ (y1, y2) = (x1 ∧ y1, x2 ∨ y2)
(27)

and one can easily verify that
(x1, x2) ∧ (1, 0) = (x1 ∨ 1, x2 ∧ 0) = (1, 0) = 0L⋆
(x1, x2) ∨ (1, 0) = (x1 ∧ 1, x2 ∨ 0) = (x1, x2)
(x1, x2) ∧ (0, 1) = (x1 ∨ 0, x2 ∧ 1) = (x1, x2)
(x1, x2) ∨ (0, 1) = (x1 ∧ 0, x2 ∨ 1) = (0, 1) = 1L⋆
As in any lattice, the meet operator ∧ and the join operator ∨
are related to the ordering ≤L⋆ by the following equivalences:
for every x = (x1, x2), y = (y1, y2) ∈ L⋆
x ≤L⋆ y ⇐⇒ x ∨ y = y ⇐⇒ x ∧ y = x
Indeed, if (x1, x2) ≤L⋆ (y1, y2), then
(x1, x2) ∨ (y1, y2) = (x1 ∧ y1, x2 ∨ y2) = (y1, y2)
(x1, x2) ∧ (y1, y2) = (x1 ∨ y1, x2 ∧ y2) = (x1, x2)
Deﬁnition 11. An automorphism of L⋆ is a bijection
f : L⋆ → L⋆ such that f(x) ≤L⋆ f(y) if and only if x ≤L⋆ y,
for all x, y ∈ L⋆.
An anti-automorphism of L⋆ is a bijection f : L⋆ → L⋆
such that f(x) ≤L⋆ f(y) if and only if y ≤L⋆ x, for all
x, y ∈ L⋆.
It is obvious that an automorphism takes 0L⋆ and 1L⋆ to
themselves, while an anti-automorphism interchanges these
elements.
We denote by Aut(L⋆) the set of all automorphisms of
L⋆ and by Map(L⋆) the set of all automorphisms and anti-
automorphisms of L⋆. They are groups under the composition
of morphisms and Aut(L⋆) is a normal subgroup of order 2
of Map(L⋆). [19]
Let f ∈ Aut(L⋆). Since f(x) ≤L⋆ f(y) if and only if
x ≤L⋆ y, for all x, y ∈ L⋆, then
f(x ∨ y) = f(x) ∨ f(y)
f(x ∧ y) = f(x) ∧ f(y)
f((1, 0)) = (1, 0)
f((0, 1)) = (0, 1)
If f is an automorphism of [0, 1], then, for (x1, x2) ∈ L⋆,
(x1, x2) 7→ (f(x1), f(x2)) is an automorphism of L⋆.
An anti-automorphism N such that N(N(x)) = x, for
all x ∈ L⋆ is an involution or negation. Obviously,
N(0L⋆) = 1L⋆ and N(1L⋆) = 0L⋆.
All elements but identity of Aut(L⋆) are of inﬁnite order;
all anti-automorphisms are of inﬁnite order or of order two.
The order two anti-automorphisms are involutions and
their set is denoted by Inv(L⋆). One (classical) involution is
α : L⋆ → L⋆ given by α(x1, x2) = (1 − x2, 1 − x1), all other
involutions are of the form f −1αf, for any f ∈ Map(L⋆).
In [20] it is proved that if N is an involutive negator on L⋆
(negation) and N : [0, 1] → [0, 1], N(a) = pr1N(a, 1 − a),
for all a ∈ [0, 1], then N(x1, x2) = (N(1 − x2), 1 − N(x1)),
for all (x1, x2) ∈ L⋆.
A triangular norm on L⋆ (t-norm) is any increasing, com-
mutative, associative mapping T : L⋆ × L⋆ → L⋆ satisfying
T (1L⋆, x) = x for all x ∈ L⋆. A triangular co-norm on
L⋆ (t-conorm) is any increasing, commutative, associative
mapping S : L⋆ × L⋆ → L⋆ satisfying S(0L⋆, x) = x for all
x ∈ L⋆.
V. CONCLUSION
We introduced six possible new deﬁnitions for intuitionistic
fuzzy sets by challenging the base condition in Atanassov’s
deﬁnition. While keeping the two membership functions, we
extended the range of possible combinations between them and
showed some interesting properties. We intend to further de-
velop the approach for measuring similarity and compatibility
between different sorts of intuitionistic fuzzy sets.
