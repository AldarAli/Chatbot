Abstract - Enhancing the management of human capital
resources in the Greek public sector addresses the challenges
of
optimizing
the
civil
personnel
recruitment
process,
increasing public integrity while enforcing the principles of
transparency, participation, accountability, effectiveness and
efficiency. The objective is the design and activation of a
central,
unified
Human
Resources
Management
System
(HRMS)
both
in
terms
of
procedures,
methods
and
Information Technology (IT) infrastructure. The blockchain
technology adopted for the needs of public administration
recruitment in Greece and the expected results are described.
The importance of working within an established legislative
framework in which merit is well defined, job requirements
reflect occupational requirements and illustrate the assessment
practices from the Greek public service are set out.

INTRODUCTION
Public sector organizations are expected overtime to
fulfill
mandates
revolving
around
objectives
such
as
qualitative and cost-effective service delivery, as well as
accountability in the management of various types of
resources.
To
achieve
that,
effective
assessment
in
recruitment of the most qualified personnel is of the essence.
Carrying out this complex procedure with the use of multiple
assessment tools and information collected from diverse
sources is expected to provide a more comprehensive
approach of the candidates being assessed and further added
value to the recruitment system overall. Securing access to
the candidates’ work and educational background as well as
performance reviews in a credible way is argued that it will,
the least, improve the current recruitment process in view of
the aforementioned mandates. Blockchain technology is
regarded as a game-changer in several sectors including the
domain of Human Resources (HR) and recruitment, mainly
because of its inherent characteristics of decentralization,
transparency and immutability. There are currently numerous
business and research, private and public sector endeavors, to
explore both the theoretical and practical implications
(technical, political, socio-economic, legal and cultural) of
the blockchain technology. The purpose of this paper is to
report on the development of an innovative assessment tool
being designed whilst making most use of the blockchain
technology that will ultimately provide ASEP, Greece, with
the means to optimize the personnel recruitment process for
the Greek public sector it has been entrusted with.
II.
PUBLIC SECTOR RECRUITMENT IN GREECE
A.
Legal framework
ASEP (Supreme Council for Civil Personnel Selection)
is
an
independent
body
provided
under
the
Greek
constitution,
entrusted
with
performing
public
administration recruitment processes for project agreements
as well as fixed-term and short-term employment agreement
positions at all levels. ASEP is supported by a high-end
electronic information system managing the vast volume of
applications, vacancies, news releases, results and, most
importantly,
candidates
involved
in
ASEP
selection
processes records. Candidates are evaluated based on the
score they achieve in written exams, the outcome of their
interview, and their qualifications overall. Some of the tools
missing
from
ASEP’s
day-to-day
business
are
functionalities that could relieve the public from the
bureaucratic burden (such as achieving validation, i.e.
confirmation of authenticity, of university degrees) and
further
enhance
qualitative
and
cost-effective
service
delivery and accountability (by way of, amongst others,
simplifying the already complex recruitment process of
Highly Qualified Civil Personnel).
Under the current legal framework, ASEP is entrusted
with performing public administration recruitment processes
in Greece, apart from certain exceptions provided by law.
More
specifically,
certain
Greek
public
entities
are
empowered
by
the
said
legislation
to
proceed
with
recruitment of personnel, either supervised by ASEP or not.
It should be noted that ASEP’s competence to supervise the
recruitment process of such a public entity does not, in any
way, overlap with the entity’s competence to deliver that
recruitment process.
B.
Process
Vacancies in the civil sector are made public by ASEP
through newsletters, its official website (www.asep.gr) and
the press, in a non-personalized way. Citizens can make
queries via its website about announced vacancies looking
for those that better match their qualifications. Following the
announcement, citizens sign into the ASEP Registry where
they fill in their qualifications and submit an e-application
regarding the announced vacancies. The e-application itself
does not suffice as the candidates are further expected to
print out their e-application and send it to ASEP along with
the hardcopies of all supporting documents and certificates.
ASEP’s Central Committee then issues and publishes interim

results in the form of tables containing all necessary
information (eg. name, ID number, credits collected per
qualification etc.) which may be appealed by those with
vested interest. ASEP’s Council Members in composition
review the appeals and the interim results, issue and publish
the final results.
Vacancies in the public sector addressed to highly
qualified
candidates,
although
announced
and
handled
similarly with the rest (application process, interim and final
results and so forth), is significantly more complex to the
extent one more step in the recruitment process, just before
the issue of the interim results, is added. More specifically,
ASEP’s Evaluation Committee issues (for internal use only)
an initial ranking based on candidates' declared qualifications
and assessment methodology that varies as it is left by law to
the Committee’s discretion to decide upon this each time.
The candidates ranking high are then called for an interview
and the Committee, upon evaluation, issues and publishes
interim results in the form of tables containing all necessary
information (eg. name, ID number, credits collected per
qualification etc.) which may be appealed by those with
vested interest. ASEP’s Council Members in composition
review the appeals and the interim results, issue and publish
the final results.
Following the announcement of the final results in both
scenarios as described herein above, the public entities who
triggered the recruitment process proceed with hiring the
prevailing candidates as per ASEP’s results and validating
their qualifications. In case of fraud detection, public entities
may submit, within three years from the final results
publication, a request to ASEP for replacement.
C.
Drawbacks in the current process
Qualifications’ evaluation by ASEP (initially by the
Central Committee or the Evaluation Committee as per the
case and later by the Members in composition) is a time-
consuming process as it is performed in a non-automated
way. Qualifications’ validation by the public entities that
trigger the recruitment process and ultimately hire the
prevailing candidates as per ASEP’s results is also performed
in a non-automated way. Both processes are apparently time-
consuming, notably the validation of qualifications requires
exchange of letters and, in certain cases, circulation of
hardcopies, with all the cost that the stakeholders at issue
incur with regard to time, money and manhours. The
replacement process itself is time-consuming and linked with
both direct and indirect costs.
III.
QUALICHAIN POTENTIAL
QualiChain targets the creation, piloting and evaluation
of a decentralised platform for storing, sharing and verifying
education and employment qualifications and focuses on the
assessment of the potential of blockchain technology,
algorithmic techniques and computational intelligence for
disrupting the domain of public education, as well as its
interfaces with private education, the labour market, public
sector administrative procedures and the wider socio-
economic developments.
IV.
PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RECRUITMENT PILOT
Qualichain pilot goals in relation to public sector
recruitment are the following:

Demonstrate and assess the QualiChain concept and
technological solution, by piloting the combination
of disruptive technologies involved in the context of
staffing the public sector.

Assess the impact, i.e. the benefits and risks of the
QualiChain
technological
solution
on
the
full
spectrum
of
stakeholders
towards
which
it
is
addressed in public administration.
A.
Stakeholders
The stakeholders involved in the ASEP use case are the
following:
1)
ASEP
Council
Members
and
Employees:
As
publishers, evaluators, validators, and decision makers with
regard to the candidates’ qualifications and the entire
selection process in general.
2)
Citizen/Candidate: As the main participant of a
selection process and the owner of qualifications.
3)
Public Entity: As “customer” of ASEP selection
process and the future employer of the candidate.
4)
Qualifications’ issuing/accrediting institutions and
their personnel: As (indirect) providers of qualifications or
on the receiving end of requests for verification, by public
entities.
B.
Expectations
The recruitment and competency management services of
QualiChain will be exploited to enhance not just the check of
the
candidates’
declared
qualifications,
but
also
their
screening, leading to a short list of those to be interviewed
and, ultimately, to the identification of the best possible
applicant for the role.
Specifically,
this
pilot
has
the
following
main
expectations, as illustrated in Figure 1:

To provide personalised candidate notifications for
job vacancies by matching individual profiles with
available jobs in the civil sector.

To utilise the solution’s Blockchain based digital
ledger in order to validate academic and professional
qualifications of individual candidates.

To improve efficiency of the selection process in
terms of time and credibility.
C.
Use case steps
The
Highly
Qualified
Civil
Personnel
recruitment
process steps are the following:
1)
The
issuing
organization
issues
a
qualification
component (either an academic qualification or a work
experience certificate) for a citizen.
2)
The
isssuing
Organization,
after
obtaining
the
candidate’s consent, uploads the qualification component in
QualiChain and sends it to the Citizen.
3)
ASEP announces positions/vacancies on QualiChain.

4)
Citizen/Candidate gets notified of new vacancies via
a Data Analytics Tool embedded in QualiChain.
5)
Candidate signs up to ASEP’s Registry (if not
already registered), fills in his qualifications, uploads the
relevant proof of qualifications declared (e.g. university
degree) and applies for the vacancy they are interested in.
6)
ASEP
confirms
the
validity
of
the
proof
of
qualification declared and potentially its metadata (e.g.
year of graduation).
7)
ASEP marks the qualification, the validity of which
has
been
confirmed
to
its
Registry,
as
a
Level
6
qualification. A Level 6 registered qualification means that
this process does not have to be repeated for this
qualification.
8)
ASEP uses QualiChain ´s MCDSS (Multi Criteria
Decision Support System) to get an initial ranking of
candidates.
9)
Based on this initial ranking, ASEP proceeds to the
stage of interviews.
10) ASEP uses QualiChain MCDSS to get the final
ranking and ultimately the interim results.
D.
Challenges
Several
challenges
have
been
identified
from
the
beginning, as follows:

Friendliness and usability of user interface provided
by Qualichain, given that it will be, mainly, used by
ASEP’S members and employees, with no technical
background whatsoever.

Pilot planning and integration with internal ASEP
procedures.

Semantic interoperability between Greek terms used
by
ASEP
information
systems
(e.g.
institution
names, qualifications, certifications, job descriptions
and so forth) and QualiChain terminology.

Compliance with Greek and EU regulation e.g.
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [1].
V.
CONCLUSION
In order to achieve effective assessment in recruitment of
the most qualified personnel in the public sector, methods
and tools must be constantly developed and tested to educate
and train everyone in line with new developments, in our
case, with the blockchain technology, so that their benefits
can be fully realized by all stakeholders. The opportunity to
explore
an
area
that
has
not
had
much
attention
academically, i.e. public sector recruitment process from a
different angle, that of embedding highly sophisticated tools,
enables this effort to be treated as a breakthrough in
contemporary
recruitment
processes,
not
necessarily
restrained in the civil sector.
