Abstract—An online survey of 112 educators who teach in a 
variety of K-adult settings explored the extent to which 
teachers understand and implement two Cognitive Theory of 
Multimedia design principles known to reduce extraneous 
cognitive processing into their electronic slide presentation 
(ESP) designs. Results indicate that although educators 
regularly design their own slide decks, most participants have 
low knowledge of how or why they should design coherent slide 
decks that do not include redundant information. Results also 
show the instrument questions should be refined and clarified. 
Keywords—Electronic Slide Presentations; Cognitive Load 
Theory; Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning; Coherence 
Principle; Redundancy Principle 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Teachers often create their own Technology-Enhanced 
Learning (TEL) materials [1]. PowerPoint® software is used 
extensively in both virtual and face-to-face learning 
environments [2][3]. It is possible that the quality of teacher-
created TEL affects learning outcomes. Yet, it is unclear 
whether educators implement proven pedagogical practices 
in the design of instructional slides [4][5]. The application of 
the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML) 
principles to Electronic Slide Presentations (ESP) has been 
proven to improve student learning in higher education [6]-
[10].  
The completion of a pilot study is no guarantee of the 
success of a main study, but it can result in improvement of 
the instrument [11]. This pilot was conducted to examine 
educators’ understanding of and adherence to two evidence-
based cognitive principles shown to mitigate extraneous 
mental processing (coherency and redundancy) in their 
design and use of ESP slides by seeking to answer: 1) To 
what extent do educators have a working knowledge of the 
CTML principles of coherency and redundancy? and 2) To 
what extent do educators apply the research-based 
multimedia principles of coherency and redundancy in their 
electronic slide design?  
In this paper, the CTML theory and principles under 
investigation are briefly described in Section 2, and Section 3 
explains the method and procedure. Results are reported in 
Section 4. Finally, conclusions and suggestions are presented 
in Section 5.

LITERATURE REVIEW 
Mayer’s development of the CTML principles grew out 
of Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), which is based in part on 
Working Memory (WM) theory [12]. New information 
(regulated by a central executive component) is perceived 
through the ears (phonological loop) and/or the eyes 
(visuospatial sketchpad) [13]. This model is a central tenet in 
both neuroscience and cognitive psychology [14].  
CLT claims three types of cognitive load can interfere 
with learning: intrinsic, extraneous, and germane [15]. 
Intrinsic load is caused by the complexity of the information 
to be learned. The number of interacting elements dictates 
complexity, over which the instructor has no control [16]. 
However, the instructor can influence extraneous cognitive 
load, caused by items and activities that distract a learner 
from the task [17][18]. Germane cognitive load redistributes 
and mediates the cognitive load required to integrate new 
information into long-term memory [17].  
Mayer applied the CLT model to multimedia learning 
and developed the idea that people learn more from both 
pictures and words than from words alone [17]. CTML 
currently proposes fifteen multimedia principles that 
instructors can use to improve learning [12]. This pilot study 
focused only on extraneous load. Within that category, only 
two multimedia principles were investigated: redundancy 
and coherence. The essential idea is to help people learn 
more deeply by presenting information in a way that does 
not cause the visual or auditory channels to compete for 
cognitive resources [17]. 
The redundancy principle implies people will learn more 
easily from a slide with a combination of graphics (visual) 
and narration (auditory) rather than a slide with graphics 
(visual), narration (auditory), and written text (both visual 
and auditory). If a learner’s attention is divided between two 
things requiring visual processing (graphics and text), 
comprehension of both items is reduced [19]. Text on a slide 
identical in meaning to the narration is redundant and causes 
learner distraction [20]-[22].  
The coherence principle states that people learn better 
when the information presented directly pertains to the topic 
[18]. Unrelated information causes distraction and reduces 
learners’ ability to process new information. Moreno and 
Mayer [23] found that unrelated background music played 
simultaneously as narration caused competition in the audio 
channel of working memory and reduced learning.

METHOD AND PROCEDURE 
Descriptive data were collected through an exploratory 
web-based quantitative survey by contact with the 
researcher’s schools, social media, and professional 
educational organizations. Through convenience and 
voluntary response sampling, educators were recruited as 
participants from a variety of virtual and face-to-face school 
settings in North America. The software Qualtrics® 
collected demographic data and Likert scaled responses 
concerning teacher knowledge and implementation of the 
coherence and redundancy principles to reduce extraneous 
cognitive load. Each research question was addressed three 
times. The software SPSS® (Statistical Package for Social 
Sciences) was used to analyze the results. Answers that 
positively reflected the principle were coded with a “1” and 
interpreted as high knowledge of the principle. Incorrect 
responses and I do not know responses were coded with “0” 
and interpreted as low knowledge of the principle.  
Copyright-free images of possible ESP slide decks were 
included to assess knowledge of the principles. Figure 1 
shows the two options for the coherence principle. The 
question was: “From which of the following two slides will 
student learn more deeply?” The slide option to the right 
contains an interesting but unnecessary graphic with 
extraneous text. Figure 2 shows the choices for the 
redundancy principle. The slide option to the right includes 
text redundant to the narration. 
A separate group of questions assessed teacher 
implementation of the principles in ESP deck design. 
Participants responded to questions with four possible 
responses: Always, Most of the time, Sometimes, and 
Never. Answers that showed adherence to the practice of 
implementing the multimedia principle were coded “1,” 
while those that did not indicate adherence to the principle 
were assigned a score of “0”.

IV. 
RESULTS 
    Professional teachers (n = 112) who instruct students in 
different levels, environments, and content areas who use 
PowerPoint® or a similar presentation software tool 
(elementary school, n = 48; secondary school, n = 44; 
post-secondary school, n = 20) responded to the survey. 
The mean age of participants was 43.98 years, and the 
average of all respondents’ teaching experience was 15.76 
years. In all, 72 (64%) of participant educators used ESP 
software face-to-face in a brick-and-mortar classroom; 44 
(39%) in an online asynchronous environment; and 64 
(57%) used ESP software in distance, online, or virtual 
synchronous classrooms.  
A. Knowledge Questions 
    Table 1 presents the responses to the coherence 
principle questions. Overall, participants appear to have 
inconsistent knowledge levels of this principle (M = .59, 
SD = .255). About half (n = 59, 53%) correctly identified 
the definition of the principle. A majority (n = 78, 78%) 
recognized that extraneous background music can be 
detrimental to comprehension, but only about one third (n 
= 43, 38%) drew the same conclusion about unnecessary 
graphics. Most participants, however, could identify a 
visual example of a more coherent slide (n = 86, 77%). 
Several respondents indicated they did not know the 
correct answers (34% for question 1; 21% for question 2; 
and 47% for question 3).

Table 2 presents the responses to the redundancy 
questions. Fewer participants correctly identified the 
redundancy definition (n = 19, 17%) than the coherence 
definition. A slight majority (n = 68, 61%) recognized 
learning is improved when narration is conducted along 
with a graphic rather than printed text. About half of the 
participants chose the sample ESP slide with no redundant 
element (n = 57, 51%). A high proportion of participants 
indicated low knowledge by choosing “I do not know” as 
a response. 
B. Adherence Questions 
    The data indicate that educators’ slide design slightly 
adheres to the principle of redundancy (M = .52, SD = 
.315). However, two questions were criticized for 
assuming educators would show a slide with full 
paragraph of text. The first was “When showing a slide 
with a full paragraph or more of text, how often do you 
read the paragraph to the students?” and the other was, 
“When showing a slide with a full paragraph or more of 
text, how often do you give students time to read the 
paragraph in silence?” Therefore, those questions are not 
included. Only one question, “How often do you combine 
an image with a full paragraph or more of text?” (M = .71, 
SD = .457) is measured. Most participants (n = 79, 
70.5%) were rated as having high adherence to the 
redundancy principle in this question.

V. 
CONCLUSION 
Results of this pilot study reveal an inconsistent 
working knowledge of and adherence to the CTML 
principles of coherence and redundancy in educator ESP 
design. This lack of knowledge is concerning considering 
teachers are increasingly creating their own TEL materials, 
including slide presentations.  
The large proportion of “I do not know” responses to 
knowledge questions may indicate a need for professional 
development. However, the data indicate some educators 
may be more intuitive about identifying higher quality 
slides without having explicit knowledge about definitions. 
It may be worthwhile to evaluate teacher-created slide 
decks and compare the results with teachers’ perceptions 
of their adherence to the principles.  
One purpose of this study was to gather information to 
develop a base of understanding about teacher practices 
before determining if applying CTML principles to ESP 
decks will improve student learning. Unfortunately, the 
results were limited because of unclear question wording 
and restricted answer options. Future studies should 
include clearer questions and use a Likert scaled response 
system.  
Other suggestions for future research are to determine 
training 
requirements 
for 
virtual 
teachers, 
limit 
participation to K-12 virtual learning environments, for 
which there is a scarcity of studies, to investigate 
differences in terms of instruction for different age groups, 
and to expand the number of CTML principles to include 
contiguity and signaling, which are also used to reduce 
extraneous cognitive processing.
