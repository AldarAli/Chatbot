Abstract — There are different factors that can influence a 
learner’s decision on how and when they will use a particular, 
innovative e-learning technology. In the existing literature, 
there are many studies that deal with the identification of 
factors and their impact on a user’s acceptance of e-learning 
technology. This paper demonstrates the results of a meta-
analysis – a statistical synthesis method that provides the 
opportunity of viewing the research context by combining and 
analyzing the quantitative results of several independent 
empirical studies. The meta-analysis was conducted on the 
basis of empirical data gathered from 28 independent 
empirical studies in the field of e-learning acceptance. The 
meta-analysis provided strong evidence that perceived 
usefulness is the strongest predictor of a learner’s adoption of 
an e-learning technology.

 INTRODUCTION 
E-learning is a way of learning that is supported by 
information communication technologies (ICT) and services, 
and that makes it possible to deliver education and training to 
anyone, anytime and anywhere [1]. We can also say that e-
learning is a term that stands for all types of technology-
enhanced learning services and processes, including web-
based learning, virtual classrooms, and digital collaboration 
[2]. E-learning technologies are not only being used by 
educational organizations. Recently, and in the business 
sector especially, companies have been recognizing the 
benefits of using e-learning technologies that can provide 
cost-effective on-line courses to their employees.  
In order to succeed, e-learning technologies must have a 
positive impact on the learners. When the learner is 
presented with a new e-learning technology or service, there 
are different factors that influence their decision on how and 
when they will use a particular e-learning technology or 
service. In the existing literature, we can find many studies 
that deal with the identification of factors that influence a 
user's behavioral intentions and the actual use of an e-
learning technology. These studies are usually based on 
acceptance theories and approaches that have been 
developed and continuously improved over the last two 
decades.  
This paper is organized as follows: in the next section, 
the main acceptance theories are presented. The third section 
describes the research methodology of our study. In the 
subsequent section, the results of the data analysis are given. 
In the last section, we conclude the paper with a discussion 
of the results and the implications of the results of the 
present study.

ACCEPTANCE AND USE OF IT 
According to Venkatesh et al. [3], there are different 
streams of research that deal with answering how and why 
individuals adopt new information technologies. One stream 
of research focuses on the individual acceptance of IT, where 
a user’s behavioral intentions or actual use is used as a 
dependent variable. In the second stream, there are studies 
that focus on implementation success at the organizational 
level. In existing literature, we also found a large amount of 
studies that deal with the conformance level of the 
technology with the tasks that the end users must complete 
by using specific information technology. Figure 1 shows a 
basic 
conceptual

Figure 1  - Basic Concept underlying User Acceptance Models [3] 
 
One of the most widely technology acceptance theories 
being used is the technology acceptance model – TAM [4]. 
Davis proposed TAM to explain the potential user’s 
behavioral intentions of using a technological innovation. 
TAM is based on the theory of reasoned action – TRA [5], 
which is a psychological theory that can be used to explain 
behavior. The Motivational Model (MM) is another 
psychological theory that is often being employed in studies 
dealing with the factors that have an impact on the end user’s 
motivation in the use of an information technology. 
Venkatesh et al. [3] reviewed existing literature and 
empirically compared eight theoretical models: TRA, TAM, 
MM, TPB, the combined TAM and TPB, Model of PC 
Utilization (MPCU), Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT) and 
Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). In the same study, the 
authors introduced and validated a new theoretical model, 
called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of 
Technology (UTAUT). Table I provides a list of independent

Most researchers are interested in the structural 
relationships among constructs in the research model that 
help explain an individual’s acceptance of a technology. The 
empirical data is usually statistically analyzed using 
structural equation modeling (SEM). The results of structural 
equation modeling are usually presented in a set of causal 
relationships, where each causal relationship is described 
using the following attributes: independent variable, 
dependent variable, path coefficient (β), and significance 
value (p). In the next section, the research methodology is 
presented together with the research question and data 
collection process.  
 
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
In existing literature, we can find different studies 
reporting different results about the size estimates of path 
coefficients in common factor relationships. We can find 
variations in the predicted effects and significance levels in 
studies with different types of users and e-learning 
technologies. This fact raises the following research 
question: 
RQ1: What is the mean effect size of a particular factor 
(PU, PEOU, etc.) on a user’s acceptance (BI, ATU or U)? 
 
To answer the above-stated research question, we 
performed a meta-analysis. Meta-analysis allows various 
results to be combined, taking into account the relative 
sample and effect sizes [6]. In the meta-analysis, only 
significant causal relationships were included.  
In the systematic literature review, we used the scientific 
database ScienceDirect for searching relevant studies. The 
papers included in this study were searched using a 
combination of: 
 
Keywords, related to an acceptance theory -  
Technology Acceptance Theory (TAM), Theory of 
planned Behavior (TPB), etc. 
 
Keywords, related to e-learning technologies - e-
learning, elearning, on-line learning, web learning, 
etc. 
 
We identified 28 journal papers (all the paper references 
are listed at the references). We developed coding rules to 
ensure that all studies were treated consistently. The coding 
dealt with the identification and coding of: 
 
Context – the context, in which the study was 
performed. Usually with a short description of the e-
learning technology. 
 
Sample size – the number of respondents included in 
the sample frame. 
 
Ground theory – the theory upon which the research 
model was developed and tested. 
 
Independent variable – the name of the independent 
variable. 
 
Dependent variable – the name of the dependent 
variable. 
 
Path coefficient – the size of the path coefficient (β). 
 
Significance level – the p value.

The chart on the Figure 2 reveals, that most of the studies 
that were reviewed and included in the meta-analysis, used 
TAM as a ground theory.

IV.DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS 
A. Analysis method 
Meta-analysis is a statistical technique that can be used to 
assimilate information from different independent studies. 
Effect size is the main statistical concept in meta-analysis, 
which refers to the magnitude of the effect observed in the 
study, which can be: 
 
The size of the relationship between variables. There 
are many different statistics that can be used to 
estimate the effect size, for example: the Pearson 
product-moment correlation coefficient, r; the effect-
size index, d; odds ratios, etc.  
 
The degree of difference between group means. 
There are different metrics that can be used to 
describe the differences in the arithmetic means of 
different studies. These metrics are, for example: 
Cohen's d, Glass's ∆ and Hedges's g, which was also 
used in this study. 
The basic principle in meta-analysis is to calculate the 
effect sizes for individual studies, convert effect sizes to a 
common metric and then combine metrics to obtain an 
average effect size. This study included several independent 
studies, therefore the meta-analysis was conducted on a 
“random effects” basis. The assumption underlying this was 
that each study included in this study is taken from a 
population that is likely to have a different effect size to any 
other study included in the meta-analysis. 
In the meta-analysis in this study, we focused on a set of 
causal relationships, listed in Table 3. Table 3 shows 
descriptive statistics about causal relationships (independent 
variable  dependent variable) with the following metrics: 
 
the number of causal links, evaluated in all studies 
(N links) 
 
the number of significant positive causal links found 
(SIG+) 
 
the number of non-significant positive causal links 
found (not SIG+) 
 
the number of significant negative causal links found 
(SIG-) 
 
the number of non-significant negative causal links 
found (not SIG-) 
 
the maximum significant positive path coefficient 
size (SIG+ MAX) 
 
the minimum significant positive path coefficient 
size (SIG+ MIN) 
 
the average significant positive path coefficient size 
(SIG+ AVE) 


size (SIG- MAX)

According to the values in Table 3, the causal link PEOU  
PU is the relationship that has been evaluated most often in 
existing e-learning acceptance studies. In almost all studies, a 
significant positive relationship between the perceived ease 
of use and the perceived usefulness of an e-learning 
technology has been demonstrated. The perceived ease of 
use also has a positive influence on the learner’s attitude 
toward using an e-learning technology and the actual use of 
an e-learning technology. There were cases where the 
perceived ease of use had a negative influence on the 
33

learner’s behavioral intentions. However, the negative 
influence on the learner’s behavioral intentions was 
insignificant.  
The perceived usefulness has a positive influence on a 
learner’s behavioral intentions, attitude toward using e-
learning technology and actual use of e-learning technology. 
The learner’s actual use of an e-learning technology is also 
influenced by their attitude toward using the technology and 
behavioral intentions. Anxiety is a factor that can negatively 
influence a user’s perceptions about the ease of use of e-
learning technology.

Table IV shows the estimates of Hedges’s g statistics for 
individual causal relationships. In almost all causal 
relationships, the effect size is medium. The effect size is 
relatively small only in the case of a causal relationship 
between the perceived ease of use and behavioral intentions.

The results of the meta-analysis in the field of e-learning 
acceptance revealed the following facts about causal 
relationships: 
 
The effect size is largest in the case of PU  ATU, 
and in the case of ATU  BI. The perceived 
usefulness also has a relatively strong influence on 
the actual use of an e-learning technology. 
 
The perceived ease of use had a relatively strong 
effect on perceived usefulness. 
 
A medium-effect size was found in ATUBI and 
BIU. 
V.CONCLUSIONS 
The present meta-analysis of 28 e-learning acceptance 
studies involved 8,133 observations. The studies involved 
mostly used TAM as a ground theory for an investigation of 
factors that influence a learner’s adoption of e-learning 
technology. The meta-analysis provided evidence that: 
 
Perceived usefulness is the strongest (direct or 
indirect) determinant for the learner’s adoption of a 
specific e-learning technology. 
 
Perceived ease of use has a relatively small influence 
on a learner’s intention of using a specific e-learning 
technology. 
 
The actual use of an e-learning technology is 
predicted by perceived usefulness and behavioral 
intentions. 
 
The above-listed facts are important for different 
stakeholders. In particular, e-learning system developers and 
e-learning content providers have to improve the set of 
features and functionalities that will best benefit end users 
during their use of an e-learning technology. In our future 
research we will perform a qualitative-quantitative study that 
will help to identify which are the most useful e-learning 
functionalities.  
In our future research, we also intend to include 
moderator variables (for example: user type and e-learning 
type). This will help us to understand if there are any other 
factors that have an influence on individual causal 
relationships.
