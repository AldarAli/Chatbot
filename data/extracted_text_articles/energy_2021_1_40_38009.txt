Abstract—This paper presents studies and investigations on
the dynamics of momentary reserves in electrical power systems
under contingency. Momentary reserve through the machine’s
inertia serves the purpose of primary frequency control and
prevents voltage collapse in the case of reactive power reserves.
A simulation was performed on a realistic Nigerian 330 kV
transmission network in PowerFactory software to study and
investigate the mechanism of these reserve functions on the net-
work buses as an inertia active power control method. Moreover,
we investigated the inﬂuence of geodesic increment of momentary
reserve on the decay of disturbances. The results indicated that
the momentary reserve by inertia alone reduces the frequency
deviation from its nominal value, delays the transmission of dis-
turbances and enhances the damping of oscillations by reducing
the ﬁnal frequency settling time at the buses under contingency.
This numerical experiment also suggests the optimal placement
of the momentary reserves in the grid in order to improve system
stability against power outage disturbances.
Index Terms—momentary reserve; system disturbance; inertia
control, oscillations damping; frequency stability.
I. INTRODUCTION
The active and reactive power reserves of synchronous
generators or Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are the
keys to a successful system control in power systems. For
each power generator in the grid, power reserve represents the
total amount of power remaining after the supply of system
loads and losses. Of course, this deﬁnition does not extend
to exceeding the power capability curve of the generators.
These reserves are particularly referred to as spinning reserves
in synchronous machines more than in other kinds of power
generators, like the wind and solar generators using BESS
[1]. These reserves can be used for both or either primary
frequency control, secondary control and tertiary control [2]–
[4]. Again, not all of these remaining power reserves from
generators are assigned for primary control function alone,
we classify the ones momentarily made available through
the generators’ droop functions speciﬁcally for few seconds
primary frequency and active power control as momentary
reserves of the generators. A lot about system stability and
reliability rest on the grid’s momentary reserve.
The
control
and
response
of
generators
to
network
disturbances or contingencies depend heavily on the kind
and magnitude of the disturbance and amount of momentary
reserves available for use in the primary frequency control
or in voltage security. Since primary control requires fast
control action to be taken within few seconds of contingency,
momentary reserves and their placement play important roles
in the dynamics of the disturbance from the event or fault
location to the rest of the electrical power network. In this
paper, we investigate how the dynamics of a disturbance are
inﬂuenced by momentary reserves ﬁrst at the contingent node,
its neighbour nodes and other nodes located far away from the
fault location. We will see whether a disturbance is damped
as it travels across a grid and whether it could be contained
on fewer nodes (i.e., localized) based on the function of the
grid’s momentary reserves. These investigations are carried
out in the DigSILENT PowerFactory software [5], using the
Nigerian 330 kV grid as a case study.
In this paper, we will start with the description, modeling
and simulation of our test transmission network in Section
II. In Section III, we will investigate the dynamics of the
momentary reserve on the test network and conclude with our
ﬁndings and recommendation in Section IV.
II. MODELING AND SIMULATION OF THE NIGERIAN
TRANSMISSION NETWORK MODEL
To understand our case study system and its parameter
interactions, we will describe the components that make up
the network. The Nigerian 330 kV transmission grid consists
of NS = 71 substations/nodes, NL = 81 over-head transmission
lines (from an alloy of aluminium and steel) with an average
length of 92 km, each with a limiting current of 1320 A.
The grid is comprised of 107 less-decommissioned units of
generators, accounting for the present 29 power stations. The

active power capacity of the Nigerian grid is about 13,208MW
as of 2020 [6]. There are other lower voltage networks
including the 132 kV and 33 kV sub-transmission networks.
For household utilities, there are 11 kV and 0.415 kV 3-phase
distribution networks. The Nigerian network operates at ν0 =
50 Hz frequency and can be described as a grid where most
of the nodes are connected to one another in a ring form [7],
as seen in the diagram shown in Figure 1.
To control the voltage outputs of the generators through
their excitation control, the simpliﬁed excitation Automatic
Voltage Regulator (AVR) model is used [8]. Other controllers
also include Power System Stabilizers (PSS2A-model) tasked
with enhancing the damping of the entire power system’s
oscillations through excitation control.
The input signal to the PSS2A controller is the derivative
of generator’s rotor speed injected to the AVR through the
excitation system. This injection works to terminate the
phase-lag between the voltage reference and the windings’
torque of the generator [9]. For the synchronous machine
model, the choice of the model is inﬂuenced by the IEEE
guide in [10]. The speed governor in the model is the Turbine
Governor (TGOV) model used to maintain the frequency
operational limits according to swing equation [11]. Here,
the swing equation describes the torque balance between
the mechanical torque Tt
in N.m. of each synchronous
machine’s turbine and the electromagnetic torque Te in N.m.

where Ji = 2Hi
ω2
0 Si is the combined moment of inertia of the
generator and turbine in kg.m2 with Hi the generator inertia
constant in seconds and Si the generator apparent power in
Volt-Amperes (VA). Dri represents the rotational loss due to
generator rotor windings for each ith generator in N.m.s and
i denotes the index of power generators in the grid. Here,
t is time in seconds and ωΘ
i
is the angular velocity of the
rotor in electrical rad/s with ω0 as its rated synchronous
value in electrical rad/s. If we assume that a change in the
rotor’s angular velocity (ωΘ
i −ω0) is a derivative of its angular
position δ in electrical radians with respect to its rotating
setpoint, δ0 at t = 0 given as
ωΘ
i −ω0 = dδi

then, with respect to time, the derivative of ωΘ

(4)
In practice, ω0 is related to the grid frequency (vo) by 2πvo,
where vo is 50 Hz in the Nigerian power grid. If we represent
the net mechanical shaft torque at grid frequency to be Tm =
Tt −Driω0, substituting (4) into (1), we then have,

Here, we assumed that the network perturbation effected on
the rotors from the fault location is small. Multiplying both
sides of (5) by the rated speed (ω0) in order to ensure that
we maintain a synchronous 50 Hz revolution throughout the
system, balancing the power, we have
Jiω0

dδi

As power P = Tω, the right side of (6) can now be written as

= Pm −Pe,
(7)
where Pm is the turbine’s mechanical power and Pe is the gener-
ator’s air-gap electrical power. If we represent the rotor angular
momentum at rated speed with Mi (i.e., Mi = Jiω0 = 2Hi
ω0 Si) and
also represent the damping coefﬁcient at rated synchronous
speed with Di (i.e., Di = Driω0), the swing equation can then
be re-written in many forms as,
Mi

Where Pi is the power in the grid’s ith node, NS is the
number of nodes/buses and Wij is the power capacity in
Watt of the transmission lines and it is dependent on the
network voltage with sin(δj − δi) modeling the dependence
of their phase differences which informs the direction of
powerﬂow and the transmission of disturbances in the case of
contingencies. We performed load-ﬂow calculations using the
Newton-Raphson method and electromechanical simulations
in DigSILENT PowerFactory software, as documented in [15].
Here, we report the results applying these simulations to study
the effect of momentary reserves on system dynamics and its
contribution to the overall system stability.

III. DYNAMICS OF MOMENTARY RESERVE
For a power system to be in a balanced state, the total power
generated (P) has to be equal to the sum of the total load and
the transmission losses (Px). This means that for the system
to always remain balanced, any change in the load demand
and/ losses would require a balancing change in the generated
power P. Therefore, the condition ∆P >> ∆Px should always
be fulﬁlled to ensure the security and integrity of power grids.
These dynamic changes result in a permanently changing fre-
quency according to the speed-droop characteristics of power
turbines, given by [3]
∆νi
ν0
= −σi
∆Pi
Px
i
,
(10)
where ν0 is the nominal frequency in Hertz and σi is the
local droop of the generation characteristics at the ith generator
node, σi = Px
i /Pi. Thus, any change in frequency resulting
from a change in load demand or losses requests a generator
response. In this way, if the node is a synchronous generator
node, its inertia is expected to slow down the transmission of
disturbances to other nodes connected to it, while attempting
to damp the frequency oscillations with its momentary reserve
according to its droop σi function. However, its ability to
do so depends on the amount of momentary reserve that the
generator can supply, according to its dead zone speed-droop
characteristics setting. Since it is not feasible to inject power
equally at every node, we aim to understand the dynamics of
these reserves to see how an available momentary reserve at
one node inﬂuences the frequency dynamics at other nodes
as function of their distance from the fault location. A better
understanding of this inﬂuence in the realistic Nigerian grid
model would be advantageous for its optimal placement and
could improve primary frequency control in real power grids.
To show the inﬂuence of geographical distribution of inertia
with available momentary reserve, we chose the Nigerian

transmission grid as the case study grid. As reported in
Section II, we modelled this network in PowerFactory software
and calculated the load ﬂow of the network. We considered
the voltage dependency of grid loads, and the active power
control according to the grid inertia. The effect of provision
of momentary reserves by system inertia on the frequency
stability of the electrical power networks is studied by varying
the aggregated inertia constant Hagg of the entire grid, as
deﬁned by [16],
Hagg = ∑NS
i=1 HiSi
Sn
,
(11)
where Si and Hi are the rated apparent power and inertia
constant of the ith bus, respectively, Sn = ∑NS
i=1 Si is the total
rated power in the grid. Note that Hi on non-generator buses
are set to zero. The Hagg was varied in the entire grid by
multiplying the Si with a common factor. Note that the
Nigerian transmission network does not comprise tie-line
connections and power transfer [6], [17]. The grid frequency
is operated uniformly at 50 Hz across the entire network.
Here, we choose 11 buses for the investigation. The fault
location bus 24, two buses at the same geodesic distance
(unweighted), r = 2 from fault location with no inertia (i.e.,
buses 8 and 10) and three buses with inertia (i.e., buses 22,
55, and 57). We again choose two buses at the same geodesic
distance (unweighted), r = 7 with no inertia (i.e., buses 7 and
30) and three buses with inertia (i.e., buses 3, 28, and 69). The
reason is that we want to investigate the effect of momentary
reserve both in the vicinity of the reserve (i.e., near to the
fault location ) and at far distances from the injection node.
We also want to understand how momentary reserve tentatively
contributes to damping of disturbances as they propagate along
the network. A reference to the network buses numbers is in
[18].
Keeping all system parameters, generations, losses and loads
constant under undisturbed operations, a synchronous machine
outage event (disturbance/contingency) is induced at bus 24 at
exactly t = 5s of the 90s transient electromechanical stability
simulation time frame with a 200ms switching, enabling the
observations on the buses in PowerFactory power simulation
software. The change in frequency propagated across the grid
is related to the change of power in (10). Figure 2 shows
the frequency dynamics at a network bus. Here, the red line
marks the frequency magnitude at ﬁnal settling time. The
black arrows point to the local maxima or minima of the
frequency magnitude and arrival times. From this nodal points
described in Figure 2, we observe at each study case node,
the frequency’s Time of Arrival (ToA), which is deﬁned as
the time when the frequency deviation ﬁrst reaches a small
threshhold of δν = 0.002 Hz, as deﬁned in more detail in
[18]. Furthermore we observe the time of the ﬁrst maximum
(maximat) of the transient and its magnitude (maximamag),
the time of the ﬁrst minimum (minimat) and its magnitude
(minimamag). We also record the ﬁnal Frequency’s Settling
time (FSt), its magnitude (FSmag) and frequency deviation

In Table I and with network Hagg at 2s, a typical behaviour
of high renewable energy source injected grids, we observe a
high frequency deviation (i.e., 0.171 Hz) induced by the large
disturbance (of 1320MW power magnitude outage) at bus 24
fault location. We also observe the disturbance arrival at the
fault location ﬁrst and at the same time as most of its nearest
neighbours at r = 2, but arrived a little later at the distant
buses 7, 30, 28 and 69. The frequency dip described by the
minimamag shows the lowest magnitude of frequency deviation
before the actions of generator governor-turbine.
At Hagg = 2s and in comparison with Table I, Table II
shows the observations when the fault location is injected with

inertia and large reserve. We observe that there are delays in
the frequency ToA at the buses, a reduction in minimat which
corresponds to a reduced frequency dip (i.e., minimamag), a
shorter ﬁnal frequency settling time and smaller magnitude
and hence, a decrease in the frequency deviation from the
nominal value (0.033 Hz).
In Table III, we kept the network parameters constant and
only increased the grid inertia, Hagg = 6s using (11) without
changing the active power injections at any network node.
We did not observe any further decrement in the frequency
deviation or any increment in the frequency ﬁnal settling
magnitude, rather we observe a delay in its time of arrival
at the buses with a corresponding increase in its dip and
ﬁnal settling time. This suggests that increasing the Hagg
without a corresponding increase in the reserve does not
improve the frequency dynamics during contingencies, rather it
increases the arrival time of the disturbance while reducing the
frequency dip across the network (i.e., improved minimamag).
This further delay in ToA also increases the frequency ﬁnal
settling time.
Table IV shows our nodal observations on the case
study buses when we injected more power reserve prior to
contingency at another bus with r = 2, from the fault location
and keeping all other system operation parameters constant
from observations in Table II. Here, the generator’s power
and reserve at the fault location are higher in magnitude than
the injected ones. We observe that the frequency ﬁnal settling
magnitude did not increase, the ToA at the buses remained
the same but there is an observable reduction in the frequency
dip at some nodes.
To investigate the effect of the same reserve at a bus
geometrically farther away from the fault location but with a
higher degree of connectivity, which deﬁnes the number of
edges connected to it, we removed the reserve at bus 22 with a
node degree of 2 and installed it at another bus with r = 7 but
with a node degree of 5 and keeping all other system operation
parameters constant from our observations in Table II. The
result of this new installation in Table V compared with Table
IV shows no observable change in the frequency ToA at the
buses and in the frequency ﬁnal settling magnitude. Rather,
we observe a delay in frequency dip time (i.e., minimat) with
a further delay in the ﬁnal frequency settling time at the buses.
In summary, we observed that an increase in the nodal
momentary reserve generally delays the travel and arrival of
disturbances in a power grid at contingencies. In particular,
it improves the frequency magnitude at the local minima
point and reduces its ﬁnal settling time. We found out that
the optimal placement of momentary reserve is at the point
of contingency as it contributes more in the damping of
disturbance across the network more than in any other place.
Since we may not always be able to predict a fault location,
the optimal solution would be to place momentary reserve
at all buses where resources allow. In this way, the power
system could quickly recover most contingencies within few
seconds after their occurrences. Again, we observed that
injecting momentary reserve at a bus with high connectivity
does not improve the frequency dip time (i.e., minimat) and
ﬁnal settling time at the buses if the bus is geometrically
farther away from the fault location. Hence, the farther away
the reserve is from the fault location, the more time it would
take for the frequency to stabilize at the buses.
Also, we conclude that increasing the grid inertia without a
corresponding increase in the magnitude of the reserve could
only delay the travel and arrival of disturbances in electrical
network but does not reduce the frequency deviation from
the nominal value. This result would be important to the
Transmission System Operators (TSOs) when injecting virtual
inertia in the energy transition to renewable schemes.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have studied the dynamics of power system
reserves. By realistic numerical experiments, we explored
how they contribute to the damping of system oscillations at
contingencies and thereby work to restore the grid frequency to
its nominal value. We have shown that the optimal placement
of momentary reserve would be at the fault location, particu-
larly in the case of generator outage events at plant stations.
Since this situation could not always be predicted, we suggest
placement of reserves in all the nodes where resources permit
as this would improve the overall ﬁnal frequency settling time,
frequency dips, and reduce overall frequency deviation from

the nominal value, thereby contributing to primary frequency
control and reducing the amount of secondary control needed.
Furthermore, our detailed work on frequency dynamics and
spread of disturbances in many case study grids can be found
