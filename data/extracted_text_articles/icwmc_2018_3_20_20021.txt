Abstract—The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has
recently
developed enhanced
vehicle-to-everything
(eV2X)
communication. The requirements of the eV2X service are
significantly higher than those of existing V2X, with the
required data transmission rates ranging from tens of Mbps to
up to 1000 Mbps. In addition, communication should be
performed with an extremely low error probability within a
time delay of several to several tens of ms. In this study, a low-
density parity-check code and 256 quadrature amplitude
modulation (QAM), which are new radio technologies, are
applied to meet the low-latency, high-reliability, and high-data-
rate requirements of eV2X. In addition, we propose a vehicle
multiple-input multiple-output system. The proposed system
increases reliability through transmit diversity and lowers
latency through a short transmission time interval. Simulation
results show that the proposed system exhibits high reliability,
high data rate, and low latency.
Keywords- eV2X; NR; sTTI; Transmit diversity.

INTRODUCTION
Communication
technology
has
been
used
for
communication
between
people
and
for
providing
information. However, in recent years, this technology has
been
applied
to
device-to-people
and
device-to-device
communication. In particular, vehicular communication,
which is also known as vehicle-to-everything (V2X), has
several
applications
including
navigation
and
driver
assistance, travel information, congestion avoidance, fleet
management, payment transactions, and traffic control and
safety. As shown in Figure 1, V2X communication may
occur in multiple contexts, i.e., vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)
communication, vehicle-to-pedestrian communication, and
vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. These applications
are referred to as cooperative-intelligent transport systems
[1][2].
Autonomous vehicles will be developed in the future.
These vehicles must exchange more data with neighboring
vehicles, pedestrians, and road infrastructure with faster and
higher reliability. The new requirement of autonomous
vehicle service is limited by existing V2X communication
technology, and there is a requirement for enhanced V2X
(eV2X) technology to overcome this limitation.
The requirements of the eV2X service are significantly
higher than those of existing V2X, with the required data
transfer rates ranging from tens of Mbps to up to 1000 Mbps.
In addition, communication should be performed with a
considerably low error probability within a time delay of
several to several tens of ms [3][4].
Figre 1. Types of V2X communication.
eV2X is being standardized in the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP), as shown in Figure 2. The 3GPP
defines 5G technology from the Release 15 standard to be
completion in June 2018. This technology consists primarily
of long term evolution (LTE) and new radio (NR). NR is
allowed to use a new physical channel structure and channel
coding scheme with a new wireless access technology that is
not compatible with existing LTE.

addition,
we
propose
a
multiple-input
multiple-output
(MIMO) system that improves reliability through transmit
diversity and reduces latency through a short transmission
time interval (sTTI). The remainder of this paper is
organized as follows: Section II presents NR-based eV2X
communication. Section III describes the details of the
proposed vehicle MIMO system. Section IV presents the
performance analysis of the proposed scheme based on
simulations. Section V states the conclusions of this study.

NR-BASED EV2X COMMUNICATIONS
In this section, we describe the LDPC code and 256
quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), which are NR
technologies.
A. LDPC
LDPC codes and polar codes, which are new channel
coding techniques introduced in NR, can provide low latency
and high reliability for eV2X. A channel coding scheme is a
combination of error detection, error correcting, and rate
matching as shown in Figure 3 [5]. In this study, the LDPC
codes are applied as error correcting codes.
Figure 3. Transport block processing.
For the initial transmission of a transport block with a
coding rate R and subsequent re-transmission of the same
transport block, each code block of the transport block is
encoded with either LDPC base graph 1 or 2 according to the
following conditions:
-
When (1) A ≤ 292 or (2) A ≤ 3824 and R ≤ 0.67
or
(3) R ≤ 0.25, LDPC base graph 2 is used;
-
Otherwise, LDPC base graph 1 is used,
where A is the transport block size (TBS). Table I
summarizes the LDPC base graph selection.

Therefore, 256 QAM improves the wireless transmission
efficiency by 8/6 (or 1.33) times with 8 bit/symbol
transmission of 256 QAM in 6 bit/symbol transmission of
existing 64 QAM.

VEHICLE MIMO SYSTEM
In this section, we propose a vehicle MIMO system that
improves reliability through transmit diversity and reduces
latency through sTTI.
A. Transmit diversity
The eV2X service requires higher reliability and larger
communication range in several use cases. All these
requirements need physical layer enhancements. Transmit
diversity can provide a gain on transmission reliability and
potentially enlarge the communication range.
The symbols sent from two antennas, over two paired
single-carrier
frequency
division
multiple
access
(SC-
FDMA) symbols form space time block coding (STBC), are
as shown in Figure 8 [7].

B. sTTI
TTI is the time interval at which the transport blocks are
scheduled and generally corresponds to the time required to
transmit one transport block. TTI is defined as 1 subframe
corresponding to 1 ms in the LTE standard.
As specified in Release 14 for V2V communication, the
number of sidelink demodulation reference signal (DMRS)
symbols per subframe is increased to 4 to combat a large
Doppler effect in a high-speed scenario. For slot level short
TTI, the structure of the second slot is a suitable choice
where two DMRS symbols are evenly distributed in the time
domain and a guard symbol is at the end.
In addition, STBC requires even number of SC-FDMA
symbols, which can obtain full diversity gain. Therefore, the
slot level sTTI is constructed as shown in Figure 9.
Figure 9. Structure of slot level sTTI.
The latency according to the TTI length is determined
based on the frame alignment time by a 1/2 TTI time length,
the processing time in each terminal or the base station and
the data transmission time in a physical layer by one TTI
time length, and the hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ)
BLER ( p = 0.1 ) is the increase due to retransmission
determined by round trip time (RTT). Assuming that the
processing time is 0.2 ms, the latency of the user plane at 5G
with time length is
0.5்்ܶூ + 2 × 0.2 + ்்ܶூ + ݌ × ܴܶܶ [݉ݏ](5)
Assuming that RTT is equal to 8 TTI, the final latency in
Eq. (5) is
0.4 + (1.5 + 8݌)்்ܶூ
