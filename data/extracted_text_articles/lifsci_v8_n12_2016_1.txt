Abstract — Medical equipments contribute to the quality of 
healthcare services on several levels. They play a key role in 
the diagnosis, the treatment, and the rehabilitation of the 
medical impairment and diseases. However, as any operating 
machine, medical equipments have a definite lifespan that 
expires after a period of time. Theoretically, studies specified 
ten years as the lifespan of medical equipments. In fact, the 
status of the medical equipments defines its age. This status 
should be addressed according to a list of criteria that evaluate 
the efficiency and the performance of these equipments. The 
purpose of this study is to develop a well-designed plan for 
evaluating medical equipments. According to this evaluation, 
the equipments that should be replaced can be ranked in the 
descending order of urgency, taking into account many criteria 
and sub-criteria. 
Keywords – efficiency; healthcare; lifespan; medical 
equipments; performance.  
I. 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
Assessment of medical equipment is increasingly 
becoming the concern of healthcare institutions [1]. For 
several years, great effort has been devoted to the study of 
reliability and maintenance of medical technology and the 
investigation of their malfunctions. In the early 1990s, the 
world raised the attention to the device-related activities and 
many regional offices were opened all over Europe, the 
Middle East, and Asia Pacific [2]. Moreover, the 
International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) 
discussed the future directions in medical device regulatory 
harmonization 
[3]. 
Furthermore, 
the 
International 
Organization for Standards (ISO) defined ISO 13485 as a 
standard for assessing and maintaining the efficacy of 
medical equipments. It deals with the specifications of 
medical technology to meet healthcare requirements for 
healthier outcomes [4]. In addition, the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) generated a Device Evaluation Intern 
Program (DEIP) to monitor the efficiency, safety, and degree 
of risk to public health of the medical equipments [5]. 
Many researchers paid considerable attention to the 
criticality of medical devices and the significance of the 
stringent environment surrounding them, so they dedicated 
their research to the classification of medical equipments and 
analyzed their preventive maintenance data using Failure 
Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) [6]. Similar studies 
measured maintenance effectiveness with failure codes as an 
evidence-based maintenance, where they compared different 
maintenance strategies adopted for seven types of medical 
equipments [7], [8]. Other studies focused on the importance 
of managing the regular maintenance process in hospitals, 
and proposed programs to increase the efficiency of the 
utilization of the medical equipments through a Medical 
Equipment Management Program (MEMP) [9], [10]. Kirisits 
and Redekop highlighted the economical evaluation as a 
critical key point that stands behind the decision making for 
an equipment-upgrading program [11]. Khalaf proposed a 
maintenance model for minimizing the risk and optimizing 
the cost-effectiveness of medical equipments [12]. Another 
study dealt with the problem from another perspective, 
where it shed the light on the relationship between the 
reliability of critical medical equipment (CME) and the 
effectiveness of CME maintenance management in relation 
to patient outcomes [13]. The clinical investigation of 
medical devices in Europe focuses on outlining the risks that 
may threaten both the patient and the staff [14].  
All the above studies discussed the importance of 
preventive maintenance and its effect on the lifespan of 
medical devices. However, the most interesting approach in 
this issue has been proposed by a new Canadian systematic 
study for preventive maintenance prioritization of medical 
equipments. This study classifies the medical equipments 
into five levels of prioritization for preventive maintenance. 
However, this study is limited to the metering of the risks on 
the medical equipments using the quality function 
deployment (QFD) as a new concept in preventive 
maintenance classification [15]. Nevertheless, among all the 
calls regarding the evaluation of medical equipment, a study 
done by Sharareh Taghipour in 2011 assigned six main 
criteria in which some of them are branched into sub-criteria 
[14]. Taghipour focused on the recalls and hazard alerts that 
may occur for medical equipments. Moreover, concerning 
the risks, a great deal of attention was given to the failure 
frequency, the possible redetect of the risk, and the failure 
consequences, where we investigated the safety and 
environment effect of the device.  
On the other hand, Taghipour raised the attention to the 
operational and the non-operational consequences of a 
failure, to inspect the cost of repair. This inspection covers

the ‘manpower’ and the ‘spare parts’ costs to fix a defect. 
Besides, the Canadian study boosted the attention to the out 
of service periods and the number of waiting patients due to 
those failures, defined as the downtime of the device.  
Here, a new evaluation technique, similar to the 
Canadian one, which will be highlighted later in the paper, is 
proposed but with less required data. In our model, we tried 
to make the investigation simple and direct so we focused on 
the function and the age of the medical equipment, as well as 
we focused on the mission criticality, the risks, and the 
maintenance requirements. Actually, collecting data for each 
criterion is very hard and requires a long questionnaire, so 
we designed a checklist questionnaire to gather the required 
data about each equipment. As a case study, we applied this 
model on a Lebanese public hospital and we came back with 
a list of equipments that should be replaced after a period of 
time as defined by the hospital.  
In this paper, we propose the methodology of the study in 
Section II. Then, we show the way to derive the weights and 
the intensities of the tested criteria in Section III. After that, 
we present the missions to accomplish the assessment plan 
through Section IV. In Section V, we analyze the obtained 
results and make decisions accordingly. This is followed by 
a “Case Study” in Section VI to test the validity of the 
presented technique. After that, we 
move to the 
professionals’ evaluation in Section VII, where we re-assess 
the medical equipments from the professionals’ perspective. 
In Section VIII, we go through the budgetary quotation for 
the procurement process for purchasing the nominated 
medical equipments. Finally, we end up with a conclusion 
and our further expectations through Section IX. 
II. 
PROPOSED METHODOLGY 
Medical devices play a significant role in providing 
healthcare, as they affect the patient and the care providers 
directly. Besides, the design of the medical equipments gives 
a share in the safety of the environment [16]. The excessive 
use of the medical equipments is directly proportional to its 
performance with time, which will shorten its expected 
lifespan. The clinical evaluation of medical technology 
should be based on a comprehensive analysis that covers 
relevant criteria and parameters to appraise the efficiency of 
the equipment.  
This paper proposes a model to evaluate the medical 
equipments according to measurable criteria and quantitative 
parameters that identify the time after which this equipment 
should be replaced. To start, we are going to identify some 
main criteria in which some of them are branched into sub-
criteria. To make our work measurable, we assigned each 
criterion and sub-criterion to a specific weight that defines its 
criticality. 
Many methods can be used to appraise and weigh 
clinical data. In our study, we take into account five main 
criteria in which some of them are divided into sub-criteria. 
The main criteria are: function, mission criticality, age, risks, 
and the maintenance requirements of the medical equipment. 
Among those main criteria, mission criticality is evaluated 
by two sub-criteria, the utilization of the equipment and the 
availability of alternative devices. Besides, the risks on the 
equipment are evaluated through three sub-criteria related to 
risks: the failure frequency, the detectability of failure, and 
the failure consequences. Each criterion has a certain weight 
that specifies its weight in the study. Moreover, each 
criterion is limited to a certain range of choices, where every 
choice is assigned to certain intensity. For a clear top view, 
we summarized the main criteria with their sub-criteria in 
Table I below.

After defining the grades and intensities for all criteria, 
the model will be ready for use to assess the devices. To 
compute the final score, we need to calculate the total score 
that is the summation of the product of intensities and 
weights for each criterion. After that, we should calculate the 
Normalized Score Value (NSV) that indicates the relative 
importance of each device in comparison with other devices, 
from which we generated the Transformed Score Value 
(TSV). The transformed score value is the value that allows 
us to rank the medical device according to its importance. In 
order to better understanding the whole process, we 
illustrated the main steps in Figure 1 below.

derivation of all the scientific relations is explained in the 
following section. 
Before going through the steps of the study in details, we 
are going to define some key terms in order not to mix up 
between them. 
 
Missions: the steps taken by our study to apply the 
quantitative part of the model. We assigned five 
consecutive missions; each mission deals with a 
main criterion at a time. 
 
Criteria: the standards and norms of evaluation. We 
considered five main criteria to assess the medical 
equipments: function, mission criticality, age, risk, 
and maintenance requirements. 
 
Parameters: the measurable factors used in our 
study, such as the weights and the intensities. 
III. 
PARAMETERS 
For reliable measurements on medical devices, some 
grades known as intensities and weights for each criterion 
and sub-criterion should be introduced. The grades may 
encounter several classes for one criterion. For example, the 
maintenance requirements of a device may be high, medium, 
or low. The definition of each class differs from one hospital 
to another depending on the decision makers at each hospital. 
Consequently, the term ‘low’ for maintenance requirements 
differs from hospital to another. 
If the criterion of a device contributes with its maximum 
capacity to the upper-level of this criterion, then its intensity 
should record a value of 1. 
According to Sharareh, the intensities and the weights 
are obtained from a pairwise comparison matrix of 
qualitative grades, which is built using expert opinion [16], 
[17]. 
The weight of each grade is obtained in (1):

In our model, we discarded the sixth criterion, which is 
“Recalls and Hazards” from the study, as it is not available in 
the hospital where the study was done. Hence, we distributed 
0.16, the weight of recalls and hazards, equally on the other 
criteria by adding 0.032 on each of the five criteria (0.16 ÷
5 = 0.032). For example, the weight of the criterion 
“Function” was 0.45. After adding 0.032 it becomes 0.482. 
IV. 
MISSIONS 
Assessment of medical equipments requires five 
consecutive missions, where each one deals with a criterion. 
In the first mission, we classify the function of the 
equipment. In the second mission, we specify the mission 
criticality of the equipment through its rate of utilization and 
availability of alternative devices. In the third mission, we 
identify the age of the equipment. In the fourth mission, we 
investigate the risks on the equipment by looking into its 
failure frequency, detectability of the failure, and the failure 
consequences. Finally, in the fifth mission, which is the last 
one, we study the maintenance requirements of the 
equipment. The core of each mission is gathering data. 
Before going through any of the missions, we made up an 
identity card for each equipment by filling up its name, its 
serial number, its brand, and its manufacturer. This 
information will not affect our study, but the aim is rather to 
identify each equipment to make sure that there is no 
overlapping in case the equipment    is shared among the 
units and departments. 
The intensities are obtained from a pair-wise comparison 
of grades; experts construct these grades as elaborated by the 
work of Taghipour. 
First Mission: In the first mission, we classified the 
function of each medical equipment into five categories: 
lifesaving, 
therapeutic, 
diagnostic, 
analytic, 
and 
miscellaneous according to the classification developed by 
Fennigkoh, Smith, and Dhillion [18]. The weight of the

function and the intensity of each category are shown in 
Table IV. 
 
 
Second Mission: This mission accomplishes the second 
criterion; mission criticality of weight (0.132) is divided into 
two sub-criteria: the utilization and the availability of 
alternative devices, as shown in Figure 2. 
 
The usage of the device and its back-up devices identify 
the load of work on that device. Moreover, using the 
equipment excessively will increase the failure on the 
equipment [19]. In the first sub-criterion, utilization of a 
device is the total hours the device is used on average in a 
hospital (the unit can be defined as hours per day or days per 
week or weeks per year). In our proposed model, we 
considered the ‘average hours a device is used per week’ for 
the utilization criterion divided into three classes as shown in 
Table V.

MEDICAL EQUIPMENT.

On the other hand, the availability of alternatives affects 
the mission criticality as it represents the number of similar 
or backup devices for one equipment. However, as the 
number of similar devices at hand becomes fewer because of 
lack of backup of the medical equipment, the risks on that 
equipment will increase. Furthermore, having several similar 
devices with low demand may also harm the device by 
affecting its performance from one side, and by costing the 
hospital regular preventive maintenance from the other side. 
The weight and the intensities of the availability of 
alternatives are shown in Table VI.

Third Mission: The third mission deals with the third 
criterion, which is the age of the equipment. The age of the 
medical device is based on the actual age of a device and its 
predictable lifespan. In general, 10 years is the average 
lifespan for a medical device. The equipments are divided 
into five categories according to the actual age of the 
equipment divided by the lifespan as shown in Table VII. As 
the ratio approaches 1, the equipment is considered as old; 
otherwise, it is considered to be new as the ratio approaches 
zero. The age ratio is expressed in equation (5): 
𝐴𝑔𝑒 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜 =  
𝐴𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝐴𝑔𝑒
𝐿𝑖𝑓𝑒𝑆𝑝𝑎𝑛                        (5)

Fourth Mission: The fourth mission addresses the fourth 
criterion, which is the risk of a device (of weight 0.192). In a 
patient-centric environment, managing risk is the top priority 
that occupies a worthy space under the umbrella of 
healthcare [20]. The risk of a device is the summation of all 
risks threatening patients. These risks can be estimated from 
the actual failures, which have occurred in that device, and 
are shown in the figure below.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3. Hierarchy for risks on the medical equipment 
       Figure 3 illustrates the three sub-criteria of risks. The 
consequences associated with the risks of a device are 
assigned by the failure frequency, the detectability, and the 
failure consequences.  These should be extracted or 
estimated from historical data and device maintenance 
archives [21].

The frequency of failure indicates how often the failure 
occurs. In order to capture this dimension, we considered 
four levels for the frequency of failure as outlined in Table 
VIII. If the failure is frequent, it means that the failure is 
likely to occur (several occurrences in 1 year). On the other 
hand, if the failure is occasional, it means that it probably 
will occur (several occurrences in 1 to 2 years). Then, if it is 
uncommon, this means that there is a possibility of 
occurrence (one occurrence in 2 to 5 years). Finally, if it is 
remote, it means that it is unlikely to occur (one occurrence 
in 5 to 10 years).

Failure detectability is the ability to detect a failure when 
it occurs. This is the most important criterion to assess harm 
[20]. We can detect the failure at many different levels. In 
our model, we used four levels of detectability. The failure 
maybe detected by error, that is when the equipment stops 
working, or by inspection during the regular preventive 
maintenance rounds, it might be visible by naked eye or it 
can be detected by self-announcement, as summarized below 
in Table IX.

The failure consequences, of weight (0.46) deals with the 
safety and the environment where we discuss the effect of 
the failure on the patient and the staff [22]. The failure of the 
medical equipment may harm the patient at different levels. 
It may cause death in extreme cases, injury in which it may 
disable the patient, inappropriate therapy, misdiagnosis, 
which makes the situation worse or failure, which may cause 
a delay in the treatment. Finally, in some other situations, it 
may cause nothing. The intensities of those failures are 
summarized in Table X.

The risk value can then be estimated as a function of 
frequency, consequence, and detectability for each failure 
mode. As a result, the risk of the device is the total risk of all 
its failure modes. 
Fifth Mission: The last criterion, which is the fifth one 
where we studied the maintenance requirement for every 
medical equipment, is covered in the fifth mission. The 
availability of the medical equipments should be based on 
maintenance history and the maintenance requirements [23]. 
According to Fennigkoh and Smith [24], equipment that is 
predominantly mechanical, pneumatic, or fluidic often 
requires the most expensive maintenance. A device is 
considered to have an average maintenance requirement if it 
requires only performance verification and safety testing. 
Equipment that receives only visual inspection, a basic 
performance check, and safety testing is classified as having 
minimal maintenance requirements. We defined each of 
these classes as high, medium, and low with their 
corresponding intensities as shown in Table XI.

MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS.

Identifying the main and the sub-criteria of each 
equipment allows us to determine their relative importance 
according to their goal or their upper level criterion using 
Saaty’s eigenvector technique – a mathematical technique 
that assigns a total score value for each medical device under 
study. This technique is used in multi-criteria decision-
making missions [25]. This total score is generated from the 
weights and the intensities of those medical devices from the 
matrix of criteria and sub-criteria observed [26], [27]. Figure 
4 shows a schematic diagram of the main and sub criteria of 
the evaluation test.

EVALUATION AND DISCUSSION 
After filling the questionnaire for each equipment, we 
can compute the scores using the assigned weights and 
intensities. The total score of each equipment is the

                   (6) 
 
where “w” is the weight of each criterion “j” = 1, 2 … 5 and 
“i” is the intensity of each class.  
At this stage, the total score for the equipments is listed in 
descending order from the highest score to the lowest score. 
This rank helps in calculating the normalized score value that 
indicates the relative criticality of a device compared to other 
devices. Therefore, the Normalized Score Value of each 
equipment is expressed in equation (7): 
𝑁𝑆𝑉 = 
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑒𝑎𝑐ℎ 𝑑𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑐𝑒
𝑀𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒
                     (7) 
The aim of this study is to prioritize the medical devices 
according to their criticality. To do so, we have to calculate 
the transformed score value from the above procedure, which 
can be used for prioritizing or ranking of devices. The TSV 
depends on the NSV of each device involved in the model, 
and on the minimum and the maximum scores that could be 
achieved. The TSV plays an important role in assessing the 
medical equipments according to a percentage. In our 
proposed model, devices can have a total score between 
(0.1257592, 1.0) where score 1.0 is for a device, which gets 
the highest intensity when assessed against every single 
criterion, and 0.1257592 is obtained when the device gets 
the lowest intensity from all criteria. The calculation is 
shown below using (6): 
𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒
= (0.482 × 0.11)
+ 0.132[(0.7 × 0.15) + (0.3 × 0.2)]
+ (0.092 × 0.12)
+ 0.192[(0.3 × 0.15) + (0.24 × 0.13)
+ (0.46 × 0.09) + (0.102 × 0.17)
= 0.1257592 
Similarly, we can calculate the maximum value using 
equation (6): 
𝑀𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒
= (0.482 × 1)
+ 0.132[(0.7 × 1) + (0.3 × 1)]
+ (0.092 × 1)
+ 0.192[(0.3 × 1) + (0.24 × 1) + (0.46
× 1) + (0.102 × 1) = 1 
As it was expected to be, the maximum score value 
recorded a total score 1. This is because the intensity of each 
criterion and sub-criterion is the highest. 
However, the total scores of devices can be used as 
absolute measurements for classification. The ranking of the 
medical devices can be done according to the normalized 
score value, however, for a better reading we can express the 
results in percentage, and so the normalized score value can 
then be mapped to (0, 100%) Transformed Score Value 
using the following equation:  
𝑇𝑆𝑉 = 
𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 −𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚
𝑀𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 −𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 × 100                  (8) 
The whole process of doing these calculations is 
summarized in Table XII.

As an example, let us apply our model on the monitors of 
ICU. Starting with the first mission, the monitor is classified 
as diagnostic equipment (intensity = 0.16), then the score of 
the 
function 
can 
be 
calculated 
as 
follows:  
𝑤𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 × 𝑖𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛= 0.482 × 0.16=0.07712 
In the second mission, we found that the usage of the 
monitor is more than 24 hours per week (intensity = 1). 
Besides, our investigation showed that there are more than 
four back-up monitors in the ICU (intensity = 0.2) and hence 
the score of the mission criticality can be calculated as 
follows: 
𝑤𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 × [𝑤𝑢𝑠𝑎𝑔𝑒 × 𝑖𝑢𝑠𝑎𝑔𝑒 + 𝑤𝑏𝑎𝑐𝑘−𝑢𝑝
× 𝑖𝑏𝑎𝑐𝑘−𝑢𝑝] 
= 0.132 × [0.7 × 1 + 0.3 × 0.2] = 0.10032 
In the third mission, we checked for the age of the 
monitor and the result is obtained below: 
𝑤𝑎𝑔𝑒 × 𝑖𝑎𝑔𝑒= 0.092 × 0.67=0.06164 
In the fourth mission, we examined the risks on the 
monitor of the ICU through the three sub-criteria of risks; 
frequency of failure, detectability, and failure consequences. 
The failure on the monitor is frequent so its intensity is high 
(intensity = 1), this failure is detected by error (intensity = 1), 
and the consequences of that failure results an inappropriate 
therapy or misdiagnosis (intensity = 0.21). Hence, the risks 
on the ICU monitor scores:

0.46 × 0.21] = 0.1222272 
 
Finally, coming to the fifth mission, the maintenance 
requirements on the monitor of the ICU is low (intensity = 
0.17). The score of the maintenance requirements is: 
𝑤𝑚𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑟𝑒𝑞. × 𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑟𝑒𝑞. 
= 0.102 × 0.17 = 0.01734 
Using equation (6), we can substitute the intensities and 
weights for the monitor of ICU, as follows: 
TSV= 0.07712 + 0.10032 + 0.06164 + 0.1222272 +
0.01734 = 0.3786472 
As illustrated in Table XII, in order to determine the 
normalized score value of the monitor in the ICU, we should 
compute all the total scores of the devices under study to find 
the maximum total score. 
Similarly, we computed the total score for all the 
equipments under study in which we obtained a list of total 
scores. Among those scores, the defibrillator scored the 
highest value (Total score = 0.470601297). Using the total 
score of the defibrillator as the maximum score, we got the 
normalized scores for all other equipments. Since the 
defibrillator has the maximum total score, its NSV is 1.

0.8742408 = 0.734004876 
Following the same procedure, we obtained a long list of 
medical equipments with their transformed score values 
(TSV).  
The obtained list of medical equipments can be classified 
into many categories according to the prioritizing plan of the 
hospital, which is related to the budget assigned by the 
decision makers. In our study, the criticality of a device is 
classified into three categories in which a transformed score 
value should belong. The first category is for those which 
should be replaced urgently. The second one for those which 
should be replaced after a year and a half (their replacement 
can be limited to a deadline defined by the hospital according 
to their budget). The third one is for those which are still 
functioning normally and can work for several years to 
come. Using the transformed score value, we can sort the 
medical equipments according to their urgency using Table 
XIII. 
Before knowing the final scores of the medical devices 
under study, we cannot assign the suitable thresholds for the 
evaluation classes. Many factors contribute to the 
classification of the evaluation classes. One of these factors 
is the result obtained in the TSV list, the load of work in the 
hospital, and the rate of in-patient. On the other hand, 
thresholds should be adjusted after applying the model of 
inventory of a hospital [28] and studying the obtained 
transformed score values. The classes in the table below are 
suggested by Taghipour[16]. 
Generally speaking, we can classify equally the 
equipments of a hospital in the order of their urgent need for 
replacement. If the equipment’s score is between 70% and 
100%, it means that the equipment should be replaced 
immediately. If its score ranges between 30% and 70%, then 
the equipment should be replaced after a while. Finally, if its 
score is less than 30%, this means that the replacement of the 
equipments does not need to happen in the near future. This 
was an example on how to classify the results in a hospital. 
Keep in mind that we can consider other intervals to sort the 
tested devices according to the hospital’s financial 
contribution. 
The decision makers at the hospital, where the study was 
applied, set the interval of criticality to be between 65% and 
100%. Therefore, referring to our example, the monitor in 
the ICU scores 73.4%, this belongs to the first class of 
criticality and should be replaced immediately. 
VI. 
CASE STUDY 
In this section, we are going to apply the assessment 
model on the medical equipments found in some units of a 
Lebanese hospital in order to evaluate them for an updating 
program. 
The professional work hours needed to apply such a 
model varies from hospital to another. It depends on the 
number of units running in the hospital, which implies the 
variety of sections and fields we are dealing with, and the 
rate of in-patients in the hospital, which implies the load of 
work on the professionals and so their availability to 
cooperate with the ongoing study.  
In this case, the study was launched in a public university 
hospital that includes 430 beds (in-patient treatment), 14 
operation rooms, 15 units, and over than 1200 medical items. 
Besides, the medical staff was busy all around the clock and 
so scheduling appointments was barely possible. Over and 
above, because hospitals operate 24 /7 all over the year,

emergencies might take place at any time forcing us to 
reschedule for another appointment with the concerned 
doctor. On the other hand, the team was built up of four full-
timers who dedicated four months working six days a week, 
six hours a day. This ended up with dedicating about 860 
working hours.  
All the above factors contribute to the achievement of the 
evaluation model in a specific duration. Consequently, we 
cannot define a common timeline for the application of this 
assessment mission, but we can set definite milestones for 
the process of whole project. 
The whole process is depicted in Figure 5, where firstly, 
it is very important to start the study by getting introduced to 
the environment that we are going to work in, to know the 
units, the technicians, and most importantly, the medical 
equipments – the core of our study. Based on this step, we 
can build up our team, and assign the missions for the team 
members. 
Once this stage is attained, the team should be ready to 
launch the investigation officially, by assigning an opening 
session that should be held with the presence of the chief of 
the Biomedical Engineering Department, the biomedical 
engineers, all the people in charge in all units, the 
technicians, and every person who work in contact with the 
medical equipments. The purpose of this session is to 
introduce the medical staff to the aim of our study and the 
importance of their cooperation and contribution in every 
single information they might offer. After the opening 
session, we need to check on the equipments by launching 
excessive rounds on floors. 
 
Figure 5. Flow chart showing the steps of the whole study. 
This step lead to start filling up the data for the scientific 
evaluation by questioning the end users on floors. After 
gathering the required information, we can apply the 
scientific model theoretically to end up with a list of TSVs. 
With the help of the Biomedical Engineering Department, 
the suitable categories for the replacement plan can be 
classified. According to the list of results, scheduling 
appointments for the professionals’ evaluation can be started. 
At this stage, it is extremely important to respect the 
nature of work of the professionals that we are dealing with, 
as their job might require a lot of emergencies. Considering 
that they are on-call workers, rescheduling several times 
might occur.  
At this level, two results emerge: the match between 
these two findings indicates the precision of the work, one 
being the user of the equipments and the other being the 
calculated total score value (TSV) based on the model. 
However, it is normal to highlight some differences in the 
ranking of the two results. We can align those expected 
differences by applying some modifications with the help of 
the chief of Biomedical Engineering Department, so that to 
end up with one unified list of equipments nominated for 
replacement according the classification defined before. 
Finally, the specifications of the ordered equipments 
according to the requirements of the professionals can be 
addressed. This declares the end of the study, but they went 
further, by contacting medical companies for the best of their 
offers. Besides, they gathered the received offers and 
handled them to the biomedical engineering department and 
they took it from there. The whole process is illustrated in 
Figure 5. 
 
In this study, in order to do the scientific evaluation, the 
researchers have chosen the Dialysis and the Critical Care 
Units as a sample study. These units normally have the 
Intensive Care Unit (ICU), which is dedicated to treat 
patients, who are seriously ill. Besides, we have the 
Coronary Care Unit (CCU), where patients with a 
pacemaker, intra-aortic balloon pump, or with cardiac 
telemetry are treated. Moreover, there is the Cardiac Surgical 
Unit (CSU), where patients having open-heart, lung, or 
vascular surgery are recovered. In addition, the Neonatal 
Intensive Care Unit (NICU) is the unit that monitors the 
neonates, who are facing newborn problems. Finally, the 
Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) is the intensive care 
specialized for pediatrics.  
In these units, the team dealt only with the medical 
equipments that are in direct contact with the patient and that 
might affect the patients’ safety. The equipments that are 
related to the ward medical equipments, housekeeping 
equipments, mortuary equipments, general furniture and 
accessories, are considered as not urgent at all so they are 
kept away from the study with “to be replaced after a 
determined period of time” as a general status. The team 
gathered the required data for 324 equipments distributed 
over 35 different items by questioning 24 of the end users,

most of them are physicians, nurses, and technicians, and 
five biomedical engineers who are responsible for the regular 
maintenance of those equipments. After the feedback of the 
above professionals, the results listed in Table XIV were 
compiled. As one can notice from the obtained results, the 
same item may record different grades when used in 
different units. For example, the ECG in the ICU records a 
grade of 57.35 whereas the ECG in the NICU recorded a 
grade of 42.88. These two different grades for the same item 
reflect the different mode of use and different urgency of that 
equipment at its unit.

At this time, the team is able to make an educated 
decision. According to the hospital’s budget, and with the 
help of head of Biomedical Department, three consecutive 
categories were set, each bounded within an interval of 
grades that matches the updating strategic plan of the 
hospital. In this case study, the three categories were 
assigned based on a strategic updating plan set by the 
hospital. The decision makers at that hospital were planning 
to spend a certain budget after the results of the study, and 
another amount after a year and a half and finally another 
amount after three years. Consequently, the coming three 
missions, as seen in Table XV, were set; the equipments with 
grades between 65% and 100% should be replaced directly. 
Those with grades between 50% and 65% can be replaced 
after a year and a half, and finally, those with grades below 
than 50% can be replaced after three years from the first 
updating plan.

From the above table, the hospital can conduct a plan of 
three phases for upgrading its medical equipments. Each 
phase would be set along a period of time, according to the 
procurement process and the installation program that should 
be launched for each equipment based on its requirements. 
VII. PROFESSIONALS’ EVALUATION 
To make sure that the obtained results are correct and the 
devices that are changed meet the hospital’s requirements, a 
survey was designed that questions the physicians, the 
technicians, and the nurses, where the questions were about 
the 
equipments 
that 
should 
be 
replaced 
directly. 
Interestingly, a list that matched the above one, which was 
achieved by the scientific study, was obtained. 
Since the aim of this evaluation is to check the validity of 
the scientific approach used, it was assumed that there would 
be some error within a short interval ± 𝜀. Consequently, the 
team expected to make some fine-tuning on the results 
obtained, especially for the equipments with grades close to 
the boundaries chosen. Hence, according to the evaluation of 
the professionals and of the persons on charge, one can add 
or remove an epsilon (± 𝜀) to the grade of the equipments 
whose score is close to the boundaries of the intervals 
chosen, where epsilon is the discrepancy between the end 
user recommendation and the findings of our model.  For 
example, the endoscopy monitor recorded 64.39%, so it 
should belong to the second category in the updating 
program. As we can notice here, even though 64.39% is very 
close to 65 but we cannot move it to the first category in the 
program. However, if the professionals, who work on the 
endoscopy monitor, recommended an urgent replacement for 
this monitor for specific reasons to be discussed, we can 
move it to the first category and add it to the equipments to 
be replaced directly. This will not be considered an error 
since the endoscopy monitor is on the boundary so it may 
belong to both categories. 
On the other hand, this step played an important role on 
checking the accuracy of the results obtained. It also served 
on checking if the professionals recommend any additional 
new equipment that was not available at the hospital, and 
consequently not included in the study done. 
Moreover, questioning the end user helped in setting out 
the desired specifications and requirements of the 
equipments to be replaced.  To do so, two forms were 
designed: the first one is a general form to check if the units 
being questioned needed any equipment to be replaced, or if 
they recommended any new medical technology that they 
saw might raise the level of the medical care at their unit. 
The second form is a specific one to highlight the 
requirements and specifications of the desired equipments. 
 
1) The General Form: 
The aim of this form is to specify the list of equipments 
needed in each unit as suggested by the end users. In this 
form, the name of the requesting person and his/her position 
is identified, to make sure that his/her job description 
empowers him/her to suggest the medical technology used in 
the unit. The requester should provide his/her extension 
number so that the team can refer to him/her any time a 
clarification or further information is needed.  
The main part of this form contains a table of three 
columns, the first column to list the name of the new 
equipment, the second column to specify if the named 
equipment is replacing an old one already found in the unit, 
and the third one to specify some details concerning the old 
equipment that is being replaced. The general form is shown 
in Appendix A (CED-F-03). 
 
2) The Specific Form: 
This form includes detailed information about each 
equipment named in the first form. In this form, care is taken 
about some other information related to the replacing 
decision, such as the clinical application of the named 
device, the accessories that should be provided with that 
device. Attention is also paid to underline some suggested

brands and models for that device with some external notes if 
required. Identifying a specific brand for each equipment 
serves in the purchasing process while making the decision 
among many several offers and budgetary quotations.  
If the equipment under discussion is replacing an old one, 
then the third part of the form titled: “Old Equipment 
Identification” will be filled.  
Finally, in the last part of this form that has many 
sections, some specifications concerning the new equipments 
are highlighted. The end user is asked to clarify the status of 
the old equipments that should be replaced; whether it is of 
old technology, obsolete, out of order, or affects patients’ 
safety.  
The other section of this part is designed to make sure 
that the nominated equipment satisfies the suitable 
conditions to meet the international standards for medical 
equipments. One of these conditions is that the equipment 
should comply with the actual clinical standards. Moreover, 
the 
requester 
should 
mention 
whether 
his/her 
recommendation is cost effective or not. Besides, some other 
specifications will increase the acceptance of the proposal, 
such as whether the equipment of the new brand results in a 
better patient care.  
Following the above section, the frequency of use of the 
named equipment as well as we asked for the requirements 
of replacing it was probed. In this manner, a check is made 
whether this replacement requires new installation or 
whether it requires training of the staff.  
On the other hand, the professionals have to justify the 
choice of the new suggested equipment. At this stage, it is 
preferable to list two to three other accredited hospitals using 
the proposed technology; this will empower the suggestion 
in hand. Finally, the value of each request according to the 
emergency status should be specified:  
i. 
High – so that the equipment should be replaced 
immediately without any delay 
ii. 
Medium – means the replacement is critical but can 
be delayed for a short period of time 
iii. 
Low – means that the equipment has no harm on 
patient and the replacement can be postponed for a 
longer period of time.  
The “Specific Form” is shown in Appendix B (CED-F-04). 
 
3) Experimental Versus Theoretical Evaluation: 
The “Professionals’ Evaluation” served in checking the 
accuracy of the results obtained from the scientific study. 
Although this step made a slight change in the three 
categories obtained, it did not induce a fundamental change 
in the list of equipments chosen. As discussed in the example 
above, the endoscopy machine recorded a score close to the 
lower boundary of the first category, and hence can be kept 
in the second category, or can be move to the first one based 
to the evaluation of the main users of this machine. 
 After consulting with the chief of the endoscopy unit, 
and in the presence of the physician and technician working 
there, the above-mentioned two forms were filled. The 
results showed that the endoscopy monitor is seriously 
facing some technical problems and some unexpected 
failures form time to time, and hence needed to be replaced 
immediately.  
Based on that evaluation, the grade of the endoscopy 
machine requires an 𝜀  upward, so that the grade becomes 
64.39 +  𝜀, and hence can be included in the first category, 
raising the status of the endoscopy to an urgent call. The 
same thing is applied on the other equipments with grades 
close to the upper and lower boundaries. 
At the end of this evaluation, some modifications were 
deemed necessary. Actually, these modifications were 
expected, as they were related to the medical equipments 
with grades close to the upper and lower boundaries of the 
three categories. 
The endoscopy monitor and the syringe pump recorded 
64.39 and 64.28, respectively, so they should belong to the 
second category. However, according to the evaluation of the 
end users and the technicians working on them, it was found 
that they constitute risks and should be replaced directly. 
Considering their grades, an 𝜀 can be added to each one and 
move them to the most critical category. Similarly, the 
professionals recommended a very soon replacement for the 
infusion pumps for the floors and the Neonates Intensive 
care Unit. Consequently, the infusion pump was moved to 
the second category with those medical equipments to be 
replaced after a year and a half. 
On the other hand, the person in charge of the dialysis 
unit found that the ECG at their unit is functioning normally 
and there is no load on it, so the replacement of this 
equipment can be postponed for a longer period of time. 
However, the ECG recorded 50.71, which places it in the 
second category, but the recommendation of the second 
evaluation moves it to the third category of replacement. 
It is worth noting that the questionnaire was filled by 
thirteen professionals in charge of the seven units under 
study, as shown in table XVII. 
Most of those professionals’ suggestions were the same 
as those obtained theoretically by the study. However, there 
was a slight mismatch between the results obtained by the

model and the recommendation of the persons in charge and 
this refers back to the reason that the user tends to 
recommend new technologies when it comes to his/her 
choice, whereas the quantitative results show reasonable real 
values. To better assess the correlation between the scientific 
and the professional’s evaluation, let’s denote by R the non-
zero ratio of the scientific results to the professional one. 
𝑅 =
𝑋+1
𝑌+1                                        (9) 
where X is the number of equipments that should be replaced 
as obtained from the scientific model, and Y is the number of 
equipments that should be replaced as recommended by the 
professionals’ evaluation. Getting R=1 means that there is a 
match between the equipments obtained by the scientific 
evaluation and those nominated by the professionals.  
Figure 6 shows the ratio R for the seven units under study 
in the three assigned classes. As it is clearly shown in the 
graph below, there is a good match between the equipments 
ordered upon the scientific evaluation and those ordered by 
the professionals’ evaluation and this is the case in the three 
critical units, ICU, CCU, and CSU. On the other hand, the 
criticality of some medical equipments was increased, as 
recommended by the professionals, such as the endoscopy 
monitors and the syringe pump for the PICU, which were 
classified in middle class by the model, yet were 
recommended 
by 
the 
professionals 
for 
an 
urgent 
replacement, so their criticality was boosted to the first class. 
Similarly, the infusion pump was classified theoretically, as 
third class in criticality, however, the professionals 
recommended an earlier replacement.  
On the contrary, the ECG was moved from the second to 
the third class, as the professionals showed an acceptable 
satisfaction of its work as compared to other devices.  
Referring to Table XIII, one can notice the four medical 
equipments that required a +𝜀 to their obtained grades, 
marked in bold face. Besides, the ECG that required a − 𝜀 to 
its grade is also bolded. 
At the end of the evaluation, the four equipments that 
required displacement from their category to an upper one 
were designated with a single asterisk (*), and those 
requiring moving to a lower category with double asterisks 
(**), as shown in Table XVI. The professionals’ evaluation 
did not fundamentally change the results obtained from the 
scientific evaluation done before; yet, it introduced some 
little modifications – or fine tuning – to the equipments at the 
boundaries of the categories chosen. We cannot consider this 
change an error since it was expected to occur. 
Consequently, the professionals’ evaluation served as an 
experimental tool to test the validity of the theoretical 
evaluation. 
VIII. BUDGETARY QOUTATIONS 
After updating the results, a list of equipments that 
should be replaced directly was compiled. At this phase, 
several companies were contacted asking for a budgetary 
quotation for each ordered equipment. 
In the request, the specifications of the equipments 
needed to be replaced were identified. The description of that 
equipment and the unit to which it belongs were mentioned, 
as well as the minimal requirements and the quantity needed. 
Actually, mentioning the number of the ordered item was 
very effective from a budget aspect. Offers streamed 
positively with higher quantities of each item. 
Besides, the ordered equipment should comply with the 
international standards for medical equipments, such as FDA 
approval or CE certificate.  In addition, the electrical 
specifications were matched with the British standards, as 
recommended by the hospital. Finally, a budgetary price for 
the equipment and all the spare parts that may function with 
it were sought, as depicted in Appendix C. 
After collecting the budgetary quotations received from 
several companies, the team listed them according to the best 
specifications and offers provided.  Several offers from 
different companies were received for each piece of medical 
equipment, and that required some excessive meetings for 
the decision-taking committee at the hospital to come up 
with a verdict. At this level, the list was raised to that 
committee to decide on the equipments that best suit their 
demand. 
Whenever the decision is made, the biomedical 
engineering department can launch the procurement process 
for purchasing the chosen medical equipments. 
 
IX. 
CONCLUSION 
Medical equipment is a critical interface between the 
patient and the diagnosis, the treatment, or the rehabilitation 
process. It provides an opportunity for a better medical 
service. Consequently, medical devices are expected to 
operate in the required way providing the ultimate results of 
accuracy, safety, and reliability for an efficient and healthy 
contribution. As such, this study provides a new model for 
Figure 6. Ratio of the scientific evaluation to the professionals' 
evaluation

assessing the life of medical equipment based on its actual 
usage, and not only speculated based on its suppositional 
lifespan. This method would result in a more accurate 
scheme that would most probably extend the life and usage 
of the equipments thus resulting in substantial savings to the 
healthcare institution from one side, and would serve as an 
assessment tool based on a multi criteria decision-making 
approach from the other side. 
Using such a model of evaluation, the wheel of change in 
the assessment of medical equipments can be turned to 
overreach several sectors in the world of machinery. 
Moreover, adapting an automated management system to 
monitor the evaluation of the medical equipments will be 
revolutionary 
move 
towards 
safety 
and 
efficiency. 
Furthermore, the proposal assessment approach would be 
further enhanced by using information technology, where the 
lifespan of the equipments may be monitored in real time. 
This can be addressed by integrating the equipments with 
information technology software and hardware through the 
usage of the internet. When done, precise and up-dated 
reports may be generated anytime and anywhere, to assess 
the present status of the equipments’ lifespan.
