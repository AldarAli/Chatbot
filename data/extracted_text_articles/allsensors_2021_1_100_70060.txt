Abstract— This contribution presents a novel all-dielectric, all-
optical microfluidic flow sensor based on thermal time con-
stant measurement. The proposed sensor utilizes a single opti-
cal fiber positioned perpendicular to the flow in a glass capil-
lary. A Vanadium-Doped Fiber was utilized, in combination 
with Fiber Bragg grating to measure the thermal time con-
stant of the fiber. The fiber was heated periodically with a la-
ser source. The temperature change of the fiber was observed, 
and the system's thermal time constant calculated simultane-
ously. The thermal time constant of the system correlates di-
rectly with the flow of the fluid. When the fiber was placed in 
a glass capillary with an inner diameter of 650 µm, flow rate 
measurement in the range from 0 ml/h to 300 ml/h was achiev-
able. Furthermore, as shown in this contribution, the sensor 
was not sensitive to losses in the lead-in optical fiber or optical 
source power fluctuations, which is rarely the case with optical 
fiber sensors utilizing an optical fiber heater. 
Keywords—optical fiber sensor; thermal time constant; flow 
measurement.

 INTRODUCTION 
Flow rate measurement is an essential procedure in a va-
riety of applications. Ranging from the process, biomedical, 
microfluidic, petrochemical, and other industries, various 
principles have been employed; some have been tailored 
specifically for a given metering application. Conventional 
mechanical principles are well proven, and used in many 
industrial applications; however, they lack the potential for 
miniaturization. Therefore, a variety of thermal principles 
have been developed in the past which enable miniaturiza-
tion. The majority of the anemometric or calorimetric sen-
sors depend on electrical heating and sensing, which disa-
bles the application of such systems in electromagnetically 
polluted areas, at high temperatures and/or chemically ag-
gressive environments. Many researchers have recently 
proposed using optical fiber setups for thermal flow meter-
ing, using various principles[1]–[12]. Cobalt or Vanadium-
Doped Fibers (VDF) have been used [1]–[9][11][12] in cal-
orimetric or anemometric setups because their use enables 
fast and controllable heating. Cobalt or vanadium doped fi-
bers act as a heater. A standard pump diode is usually used 
as a photon supply for the Vanadium and Cobalt doped fi-
bers, absorbing the light and transforming it to heat. How-
ever, anemometric and calorimetric principles are very sen-
sitive to changes in the heating power delivered to the fiber, 
which is an issue that many optical fiber sensors cannot mit-
igate. Losses in connectors, fibers, and fluctuations of the 
source's optical output power are difficult to control, and 
usually demand complex and expensive compensation sys-
tems, making them non-competitive on the market. Mat-
jasec and Donlagic[13] have shown that this issue can be 
avoided if the appropriate control technique is used in a 
thermal conductivity measurement setup. Instead of a con-
stant power or constant temperature approach, a sinusoi-
dally modulated heating source was employed, which over-
came unavoidable fluctuations of heating power. Measure-
ment of thermal time constant was used in their case to de-
termine the thermal conductivity of the measured liquid. In 
this paper, this principle has been extended to measure flow 
rate. Measured thermal time constant is highly dependent 
on the flow velocity of the liquid surrounding the sensor, as 
is shown in the following sections.  
One of the possible approaches that could mitigate the 
drawbacks mentioned above and simultaneously offer a re-
liable and straightforward design capable of flow measure-
ment could be via the measurement of thermal time constant 
of a structure submerged in a flow. In this principle a time 
varying heat source is submerged in the fluids flow and 
thermal time constant is measured. Nusselt number (ratio of 
convective heat transfer and conductive heat transfer) in-
creases with the increase of flow velocity around the sensor 
due to forced convection introduced with the flow. Such a 
system also enables implementation in a microfluidic envi-
ronment if optical fiber technology is applied to measure the 
thermal constant. Simultaneously, optical fiber technology 
enables the use of the proposed measurement system in ar-
eas that present an unavoidable obstacle for classic electri-
cal sensors, such as high temperatures, chemically harsh, 
or/and radiation polluted environments. Furthermore, sim-
ple construction and low-cost optical fibers enable the use 
of the proposed system in various applications, especially 
for lab-on-a-chip applications, where flow measurement is 
needed during the operation, and later the chip is discarded.  
In this paper, we present an all silica, all-optical, all-di-
electric, microfluidic flow sensor based on thermal time 
constant measurement. The proposed sensor cultivates prin-

ciples from two sensors previously designed by our re-
search group[10][13]. The proposed sensor is based on a 
single Vanadium-Doped Fiber with inscribed Fiber Bragg 
grating (FBG), which acts as a dynamic temperature sensor. 
FBG is a periodic change of the refractive index in the fiber 
core, which generates a wavelength specific dielectric mir-
ror. With temperature increase of the FBG, the reflected 
wavelength increases accordingly. This setup enables meas-
urement of the heat discharge from the heated surface, 
which correlates with the velocity of the fluid. The proposed 
sensor is highly insensitive to the variations or the changes 
of the heating power, which is rarely the case with other 
flow sensors based on thermal principles. Moreover, due to 
its all-silica design, it possesses all the advantages of optical 
fiber sensors, for example, application in electromagneti-
cally polluted areas, in high temperatures or chemically 
harsh environments. The remainder of the paper is organ-
ised as follows. Section 2 presents sensor’s design; Section 
3 presents the manufacturing method and experimental 
setup for the measurements. Section 4 presents the Results. 
Conclusions are made in the last, Section 5. 
II. 
SENSOR DESIGN 
The presented sensor is a redesign from the previous 
work of Matjasec and Donlagic[13]. Their sensor is rede-
signed to employ FBG instead of the Fabry-Perot sensing 
cavity. Redesign allows the sensor to be shorter and inserted 
in a capillary with an inner diameter of 650 µm. It also en-
ables the use of commercially available high-speed FBG in-
terrogators. 
The addition of small amounts of Vanadium to the core 
of silica optical fibers has been found to increase absorption 
of light with wavelengths lower than 1000 nm [14][15]. The 
VDF was initially drawn to 125 µm diameter with a  core 
diameter of about 9 µm. A Medium Power Laser Di-
ode(MPLD) was used, with a central wavelength of 980 nm. 
Such diodes are usually used as pumping sources for Er-
bium fiber amplifiers. MPLD is modulated sinusoidally, 
which causes the VDF to heat up and cool down in the fluid 
flow. To decrease the natural time constant of the system, 
the sensing fiber was etched to a diameter of 35 µm. This 
also decreases the drag in the channel, which correlates with 
fluid velocity. The sensing fiber was positioned perpendic-
ularly to the flow direction, in the middle of the flow chan-
nel. The sensor assembly is shown in Fig. 1, and the manu-
factured sensor is shown in Fig. 2. 
The heating segment was a 250 µm long piece posi-
tioned in the middle of the flow channel. It was spliced to 
an HI 1060 fiber which served as the lead-in fiber. The Va-
nadium-Doped Fiber was custom made and is described in 
[16]. The fiber used in this work can be found as fiber 3 in 
Table 2 of [16]. The fiber's initial diameter was 125 µm with 
a core diameter of 9 µm, which was later etched as de-
scribed further below. The Fiber Bragg Grating was in-
scribed in the section of the VDF which enabled thermal 
time constant measurement. The proposed sensor was posi-
tioned in a glass capillary with an inner diameter of 650 µm 
and an outer diameter of 1000 µm. 
 
III. 
MANUFACTURING PROCEDURE AND EXPERIMETNAL 
SETUP 
The manufacturing process of the sensing fiber consisted 
of a simple cleave and splice sequence. As shown in Fig. 3a, 
a cleaved piece of VDF was spliced to the lead-in single 
mode HI-1060 fiber. This was accomplished in a standard 
arc fusion splicer. The VDF was then cleaved at the length 
of 250 µm from the splice, under an optical microscope to 
ensure the correct length of the VDF. The remaining fiber 
was spliced to the lead-out coreless fiber, as seen in Fig. 3b, 
which was cleaved at a length about 1 mm away from the 
VDF. The FBG was inscribed using a femtosecond laser and 
positioning system as shown in Fig. 3c. The desired length, 
reflectivity, and Bragg wavelength of the FBG can be se-
lected with such a system. With a desired length of 250 µm, 
we  achieved reflectivity of about 10% at Bragg wavelength 
1543 nm. The sensing fiber was then etched in a 40% HF 
solution for about 50 minutes to decrease its diameter from 
125 µm to about 35 µm, as shown in Fig. 3d. Fiber diameter 
reduction shortens the thermal response time and, conse-
quently, enables the use of higher modulation frequencies. 
The same femtosecond laser system was used to drill holes 
with diameter of about 45 µm in the glass capillary, which

served as a flow channel (Fig. 3e). Drilled holes were over-
sized to enable easier insertion of the etched fiber. High laser 
power was used to ablate the material. Lastly, the fiber was 
inserted into the capillary by hand, under an optical micro-
scope. To determine the axial position of the FBG in the fi-
ber, a red laser pointer was coupled in the fiber produced by 
the above-mentioned method, and the position of the FBG 
was clearly visible with the eye due to diffraction of the red 
light on imperfections caused by the manufacturing method. 
This supported flawless positioning of the sensing fiber in 
the middle of the flow channel. High viscosity 2-component 
epoxy glue was used to seal off the holes in the capillary. A 
fully assembled sensor is depicted in Fig. 2 under an optical 
microscope. 
 
 
 
Two interconnected subsystems were used for ther-
mal time constant measurement: A heating power delivery 
subsystem and dynamic temperature measurement and pro-
cessing subsystem. Both subsystems are depicted in Fig. 4. 
The  heating power delivery subsystem consisted of a me-
dium power laser diode (MPLD) with central wavelength of 
980 nm, which was connected to an appropriate driver. The 
driver was controlled with a programmable sine function 
generator. The programmable sine generator enabled control 
over the frequency and amplitude of the modulation. The dy-
namic temperature measurement subsystem consisted of a 
high speed FBG interrogator (FAZ I4E). The Bragg wave-
length data were transferred in real time to a PC using Lab-
VIEW. The sensing fiber was connected to both subsystems 
with a Wavelength Division Multiplexer (WDM), which en-
ables coupling of the light from the MPLD and FBG inter-
rogator. 
 
IV. 
SENSOR OPERATION AND THEROY 
Two principles could be used to measure flow rate with 
the presented setup: a) Measurement of the total/accumula-
tive change of the heated object's temperature due to the ap-
plication of the known heating power, and b) Measurement 
of the thermal time constant of the heated object. While the 
first approach offers more simple interrogation software, it 
requires that the delivered heating power is known and con-
stant. This is a drawback of many optical fiber sensors, be-
cause losses in the optical systems are unpredictable and are 
hard to evaluate. Therefore, we  decided to employ the sec-
ond technique, where the thermal time constant of the 
heated fiber is measured. The MPLD was driven by a cur-
rent that was modulated with a raised sine function, which 
resulted in further raised-sine modulation of the output op-
tical power. This sine-modulated optical power was then 
delivered to the optical sensor inserted in the fluid flow. The 
VDF absorbed the optical power, which resulted in a sinus-
oidal time-dependent variolation of the VDF's temperature. 
This time-dependent temperature variation was then deter-
mined with the use of FBG and a high-speed interrogator. 
Bragg wavelength variation followed MPLD sine modula-
tion but was delayed/lagged in time to the modulation sig-
nal. A lag/phase difference Δφ between the MPLD sine 
modulation and FBG's wavelength (temperature) change

was correlated to the heated fiber's thermal time constant τ 
as: 
 
τ = -tg(Δφ) / 2πf ; -π < Δφ < π  
 
 
(1) 
 
Where  𝑓 represents the frequency of the MPLD modula-
tion and 𝛥𝜑 representes the measured phase delay between 
the modulation and temperature signal. The fiber’s (sen-
sor’s) thermal time constant τ and the thermal conductivity 
𝑘𝑓 are related through the following expression [16]: 
 
τ = ps cs b2 / kf Nu  
 
 
 
   (2) 
 
where ps represents silica specific density, cs silica specific 
heat, b fiber radius and Nu the Nusselt number. Silica spe-
cific density, silica specific heat and fiber radius were, in 
our case, constant. The Nusselt number, however, is a 
fluido-dynamic parameter, which represents the ratio be-
tween convective to conductive heat transfer at a boundary 
in a fluid. We can conclude that, when the flow rate around 
the sensor increases, the Nusselt number increases accord-
ingly, due to forced convection, consequently changing the 
thermal time constant.

MEASUREMENT RESULTS 
The proposed and experimentally produced sensor was 
configured and tested in a liquid flow control system. We 
used a calibrated syringe pump, which provided the possi-
bility to set abslotue flow rates over a broad range of flow 
rate values. Connections between the syringe, sensor and 
waste beaker were made with silicone tubing with an inner 
diameter of 1mm. In the first set of experiments the sensor`s 
response for flow ranging from 0 to 300 ml/h is shown. Iso-
propyl alcohol was used for all experiments. The heating 
peak-to-peak power amplitude corresponded to 34 mW, and 
the frequency was set to 20 Hz. This frequency was selected 
because the sensor`s natural time constant (no-flow condi-
tion) corresponded to around 5 ms. To establish a continu-
ous flow rate measurement through the sensor, the phase 
difference between the FBG’s temperature signals and 
modulation signal was measured continuously over time. 
This was accomplished by performing a Fast Fourier Trans-
formation (FFT) continuously on the FBG temperature ver-
sus time and heating power versus time signals acquired 
within 1 s long time intervals. The phase difference between 
both signals was then obtained by subtracting the phases of 
the components in the FFT that correspond to the excitation 
frequency. This provided a robust and noise-tolerant calcu-
lation of the phase difference between both signals. The 
phase difference between both signals was converted to a 
time constant, using Eq.1. An example of measured time 
constant versus flow rate, using IPA and the above-men-
tioned excitation parameters, is shown in Fig. 5. for the flow 
rate between 0 and 300 ml/h.

As seen in Fig. 5, the flow rate and measured thermal time 
constant are proportionally inverse, as predicted by 
Equation 2. 
Most thermo-optic fiber-based flow sensors 
reported in the literature [1][4][5][12][17] assume that 
the delivered heating optical power is known and 
constant. Deviation from this assumption usually 
translates directly into the increased measurement 
uncertainty. The proposed sensor is, however, due to the 
application of the thermal time constant measurment 
principle, highly tolerant to the variations in delivered 
heating power, as demonstrated by Fig. 6. Figure 6 shows 
the experiment where the flow rate was measured at three 
substantially 
different 
amplitudes 
of 
sinusoidal 
modulation optical power. The results in Fig. 6 
demonstrate that there is no correlation between total 
delivered optical power to the Vanadium-Doped Fiber 
and the measured thermal time constant. However, it 
should also be stressed that, at lower flow velocities, the 
delivered power shall be limited to prevent reaching the 
fluid’s boiling point, as this disturbs the flow and affects 
measurement. On the other hand, very low optical powers 
lead to the degradation of signal amplitude, and, thus, to 
reduced signal to noise ratio, which is reflected further in 
degradation 
of 
the 
measurement 
resolution.

The last set of performed experiments was de-
voted to experimental investigation of the proposed sen-
sor’s measurement resolution. The sensor`s resolution 
was demonstrated at different flows using a siphoning ef-
fect to enable a pulsation free and stable fluid flow.  
Known and predetermined amounts of liquid were added 
to the upper beaker at approximately 20 s intervals. The 
flow rate was verified using a scale by weighting the 
change of mass of the liquid in time. An example of the 
sensor`s resolution demonstration is, thus, presented in 
Figs. 7 and 8 at initial flow rates of around 25 ml/h and 
210 ml/h, respectively. 
By comparing the sensor’s output change with the 
measurement of noise levels in Figs. 7 and 8 we con-
cluded that the sensor`s resolution was about 0.81 ml/h 
for flow rates around 25 ml/h, and 3.1 ml/h for flow rates 
around 200 ml/h. Altogether, we can conclude that the 
proposed sensor’s overall resolution was 3.1ml/h for the 
flow range from 0 to 300 ml/h, which corresponded to 
about 1.03% of the full scale resolution.

CONCLUSIONS 
An all-fiber, all-silica microfluidic flow sensor based on 
thermal time constant measurement was presented in this 
paper. The sensor was based on a short section of Vana-
dium-Doped Fiber with inscribed Fiber Bragg Grating. The 
sensor was heated optically and periodically in time by a 
laser diode, while the temperature change was observed, 
and the phase difference calculated between the modulated 
and measured temperature signal. This phase difference 
was used to calculate the thermal time constant of the sen-
sor, which, in accord with the presented theoretical back-
ground, decreased when the flow of the fluid was intro-
duced around the sensor. The sensor was packaged in a 
glass capillary with an inner diameter of 650 µm, and tested 
for different flow rates using IPA. The proposed sensor was

simple to construct and interrogate. It offers two distinct ad-
vantages over other optical fiber flow sensors. Firstly, it's 
very simple, single fiber design offers the possibility in mi-
crofluidic applications where space is limited. Secondly, its 
immunity to varying losses in optical fibers offers the pos-
sibility to use it in rugged areas with minimal maintenance 
and human interference during its lifetime. The experi-
mental version of the sensor was demonstrated for flow rate 
measurement from 0 to 300 ml/h with a full-scale resolution 
of around 1%. All the experiments were conducted with 
IPA, and calibration of the sensor would be needed in a 
commercial application for the given fluid. However, with 
measurement of the time constant of the liquid when there 
is no flow presented in the channel, an in-situ calibration is 
possible. The sensor is sensitive to debris presented in the 
liquid, especially microfibers, which clog the flow channel 
and interfere with the time constant measurement. Moreo-
ver, any two-phase flow (gas and liquid) would also inter-
fere with the measurement and render it unreliable. The pro-
posed sensor also possesses all the advantages associated 
with fiber-optic sensors, such as, for example, dielectric and 
chemically inert design, electrical passivity, immunity to 
electromagnetic interference, small size, and biocompatibil-
ity. The proposed sensor can measure the flow velocities of 
aggressive fluids and enables use of long lead-in fibers to 
measure flow in remote locations separated from the opto-
electronic interrogation unit. Moreover, the authors believe 
that the sensor's upscaling and downscaling without degra-
dation of properties is possible. While other flow measure-
ment solutions might offer better dynamic range and reso-
lution, the proposed sensors' simple and low-cost design en-
ables use in single-use lab-on-a-chip applications and bio-
medical applications.
