Abstract—In recent times, advanced driving assistance systems 
have become popular, and drivers have had more opportunities 
to interact with the system continually. Although the majority 
of earlier studies compared driving behaviors with and without 
systems or before and after using systems, the effect of the 
system has not been verified from a long-term perspective. 
Therefore, the present study investigates both short- and long-
term effects of driving assistance systems on drivers’ behaviors 
and usability evaluations. The results found two types of 
transition patterns in driving behavior and one stable pattern in 
usability evaluations. This indicates that there are non-uniform 
effects of a single driving assistance system, depending on the 
kinds of risk objects and driving behaviors.

 INTRODUCTION 
There are two popular measures to encourage drivers to 
adopt safer behaviors: educational measures and engineering 
measures [1]. Engineering measures include advanced driving 
assistance systems, while educational measures include driver 
training and safety education. As an example of engineering 
measures, a head-up display system provides visual guidance 
to drivers on the immediate required behavior. In recent times, 
such systems are known to directly intervene in driver 
behavior—for example, emergency brake systems, which 
decelerate a car in danger of collision with others. 
Several educational measures have proven beneficial in 
the long term [2]. However, the effect of engineering 
measures, especially that of an advanced driving assistance 
system, is yet to be proven because of its short duration in use. 
Many studies have compared driving behaviors with and 
without systems or before and after using systems. It is known 
that driver behavior shifted to both safe and risky behaviors 
based on the authority bestowed by intelligent speed 
adaptation systems after using the system [3]. 
As driving assistance systems become popular, drivers 
have more opportunities to interact with the system 
continually. Therefore, it is essential to consider both the 
short-term and long-term effects of the systems. For example, 
drivers’ behaviors appeared to improve for six months 
following brief exposure to the system [4]. However, the 
longer the drivers interacted with the intelligent speed 
adaptation system, the more frequently they overrode it [5]. 
A few earlier studies show that subjective evaluations 
toward systems is related to changes in driving behaviors [6]. 
Similarly, from a long-term perspective, some drivers barely 
trusted and accepted an adaptive cruise control system when 
they were provided incomplete information [7]. These studies 
reveal the importance of measuring subjective evaluations to 
encourage drivers to change their driving behaviors 
appropriately. 
Therefore, it is essential to consider both the short- and 
long-term effects of an advanced driving assistance system. 
The present study empirically verifies the effects of the system 
on drivers’ behaviors and usability evaluations from short- 
and long-term perspective. 
The changes in speed, margin, and evaluation scores 
immediately after driving with assistances are defined as 
“short-term effects,” while the changes after one week of 
driving with assistances are defined as “long-term effects.” If 
drivers can comprehend the system’s intention immediately 
after initially driving with assistances, their driving behaviors 
would improve on day 1 and  no changes would be observed 
thereafter. If drivers understand the system’s intention 
gradually, their driving behaviors would improve gradually 
week after week. 
Section 2 describes the experimental method and Section 
3 describes the results of the experiment. In Section 4, we 
discuss the short- and long-term effects of an advanced 
driving assistance system.

METHOD 
A. Apparatus 
We used a driving simulator equipped with a driving 
assistance system in an experiment (Figure 1). This system 
detects the potential risks that may lead to accidents, such as 
drivers’ blind spots. Such risks are identified based on the 
normative behaviors of expert driving instructors. The 
following two driving assistance stages are employed [8] [9]: 
1) Cognitive guidance: This provides information about 
the surrounding environment and guides the driver to brake 
or turn. 
2) Behavioral intervention: This is an intervention in 
driver braking and steering behavior when cognitive 
guidance does not positively affect driver behaviors. 
The following information is provided when cognitive 
guidance is given and behavioral interventions are performed. 
Three stimuli are provided: a beep and notification message 
(e.g., “Caution! A parked car”) as the auditory stimuli; a 
slowdown icon, an arrow pointing to the left/right, and an 
LED light on the steering wheel as visual stimuli; and steering 
wheel and accelerator vibration as tactile stimuli. 
The scope of the behavioral intervention (i.e., the power 
of braking and steering torque) depends on the status of the 
car and the safety region monitored by the system. Braking 
intervention decelerates the car to a fixed speed when crossing 
an intersection and passing a parked car or a pedestrian. 
Steering intervention autonomously operates a steering wheel, 
but this torque is sufficiently small; therefore, drivers can turn 
the steering wheel against the system’s intervention. This 
intervention occurs when passing a parked car and a 
pedestrian but not when crossing an intersection. 
This driving assistance system provides information about 
the potential risks and encourages drivers to change their 
behaviors if necessary. No assistance (i.e., cognitive guidance 
and behavioral intervention) is provided in the case of safe 
driving. From an educational perspective, if the drivers 
understand the system’s intention, they are expected to adopt 
safer driving behaviors than before. 
B. Course Settings 
Approximately 1,400 meters is used as the length of the 
driving course utilized in the experiment. Although the course 
includes some intersections, participants are required to drive 
straight at all intersections. 
Intersections without signals, parked cars, and pedestrians 
are arranged on the course as the risk objects, which the 
system can detect. Each risk object is of two different kinds, 
depending on their risk level.

• 
Intersections: The size of blind spots can be 
controlled by the height of fences near intersections—
that is, high-risk intersections with high fences and 
low-risk intersections with low fences. 
• 
Parked cars: The size of blind spots can be controlled 
by the size of parked cars—that is, high-risk parked 
trucks and low-risk parked compact cars. 
• 
Pedestrians: The level of risk can be controlled by the 
direction 
of 
pedestrians—that 
is, 
high-risk 
pedestrians in the same direction as the car and low-
risk pedestrians in the direction facing to the car. 
The system provides more assistance toward the high-risk 
objects than toward low-risk objects because the system 
determines the amount of assistance based on the risk levels. 
If drivers understand the relationship between risk levels and 
the amount of assistance, they may adopt safer behavior by 
themselves. 
C. Procedure 
Eighteen 
drivers 
participated 
in 
four 
90-minute 
experiments spanning four weeks, with a one-week interval 
between experiments. Ethic approval was granted by the 
Nagoya University Institute of Innovation for Future Society 
Ethics Committee and participants were provided with an 
informed consent form. 
All four experiments were conducted according to the 
following procedure. Table 1 shows the number of the risk 
objects arranged in each running. 
• 
Practice running: Participants were allowed to drive 
the course once without assistance to understand the 
driving simulator. 
• 
Pre-running: Participants drove the course twice to 
measure the initial driving behavior without 
assistances. The course included each of two kinds of 
risk objects for intersections, parked cars, and 
pedestrians. 
• 
Instruction: Participants were informed that the 
system encourages drivers to adopt safer driving 
behaviors with cognitive guidance and behavioral 
interventions. Participants also watched a movie on 
the assistances provided by the system. 
• 
Pre-evaluation: Participants answered a usability 
questionnaire prior to using the system. This 
questionnaire measured six elements: effectiveness, 
efficiency, satisfaction, understandability, comfort, 
and motivation. Each element has three questions 
rated on a five-point scale [10]. 
• 
Running 
with 
assistance: 
During 
training, 
participants drove the six courses with assistances. To 
encourage participants to understand the relationship 
between the risk levels and the amount of assistance, 
either parked cars or pedestrians were arranged in 
each running. Two filler runnings were included in 
the six courses to inform participants that the system 
does not provide assistances unnecessarily for objects 
with extremely low risk. In this running, the number 
of intersections was reduced to half, as the length of 
the course was set to half the normal length. The order 
of the six courses was counterbalanced with a Latin 
square. 
• 
Post-running: Participants drove the course twice, 
similarly as in the initial pre-running. 
• 
Post-evaluation: Participants answered a usability 
questionnaire after using the system, similarly as in 
the initial pre-evaluation.

RESULTS 
All 18 participants of mean age 30.5 years were analyzed. 
The standard deviation of age was 10.1 years. We conducted 
4 (Day factor: 1/2/3/4) × 2 (Running factor: pre/post) 
ANOVAs for the following analyses. 
A. Driving Behaviors 
Figure 2 shows the transitions in speed when crossing an 
intersection and passing a parked car or a pedestrian, and 
Figure 3 shows the transitions of the margin between the car 
and a parked car or a pedestrian. We can find two types of 
transition patterns in speed and margin: “initial short-term 
effect” and “short- and long-term effects.” 
1) Initial short-term effect: On day 1, short-term effects 
from pre- to post-running were observed, and no changes 
were observed thereafter. This effect appeared for speed 
when crossing an intersection and for margin when passing 
by a pedestrian. Statistically, there were significant 
interactions between day factor and running factor and 
significant differences between pre-running on day 1 and the 
other three pre-runnings (Tables 2 and 3).  
2) Short- and long-term effects: The short-term effects 
between pre- and post-running as well as the long-term 
effects between days appeared simultaneously. Therefore, 
driving behavior improved gradually over four weeks. This 
effect appeared for speed when passing by a parked car and a 
pedestiran. Statistically, there were significant main effects

of both day facror and running factor and no significant 
interaction (Table 2).  
These transition patterns depended on the kinds of risk 
objects and driving behavior, regardless of the risk levels. The 
margin when passing by a parked car did not conform to these 
two patterns (Table 3). 
B. Usability Evaluations 
Figure 4 shows the transition of usability scores. We found 
that each of the scores is not fluctuating, with small variances. 
However, the ANOVA results show significant main effects 
for some elements. First, significant main effect of day factor 
for efficiency was observed (F(3, 51) = 4.89, p < 0.005, η2 = 
0.05). The score on day 1 was significantly lower than that on 
the other three days (day 1-2: t(35) = 2.06, p < 0.05; day 1-3: 
t(35) = 3.50, p < 0.001; day 1-4: t(35) = 3.09, p < 0.005). 
Second, a marginally significant main effect of running factor 
for understandability indicates that participants comprehend 
the system more in post-running than in pre-running (F(1, 17) 
= 3.46, p < 0.10, η2 = 0.01). However, subjective evaluations 
were stable because both effect sizes were extremely small. 
IV. 
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
The present study empirically confirmed the short- and 
long-term effects of an advanced driving assistance system on 
drivers’ behaviors and usability evaluations. As a result, we 
found two types of transition patterns in driving behaviors and 
one stable pattern in usability evaluations. 
The first pattern in driving behavior, in which changes 
between pre- and post-running on day 1 and no changes 
following day 1 are observed, is interpreted as the initial short-
term effect. This pattern appears for speed when crossing an 
intersection and for margin when passing by a pedestrian. 
Drivers adequately understand the potential risks immediately 
after an initial driving session with assistances and remember 
them until the next week. 
The second pattern, in which changes between pre- and 
post-running on each day and changes between days are 
observed, is interpreted as the short- and long-term effects. In 
other words, changes between pre- and post-running on each 
day disappear in pre-running in the following week. This 
pattern appears for speed when passing by a parked car and a 
pedestrian. Although drivers could not adequately understand 
potential risks after their initial driving session with 
assistances, they gradually comprehend the risks after 
repeated runnings with assistances.

What determines the type of effect that appears in driving 
behaviors? The study results indicate that the factor is the 
combination of risk objects (i.e., an intersection, a parked car, 
or a pedestrian) and driving behaviors (i.e., speed or margin), 
regardless of risk levels (i.e., high risk or low risk). 
There is no steering intervention when crossing an 
intersection, unlike when passing by a parked car and a 
pedestrian. Similarly, drivers are prone to experience sudden 
slowdowns prompted by the system because the risk level of 
intersections is higher than the risk levels of parked cars and 
pedestrians. Such salient experiences of slowdowns in an 
intersection encourage drivers to learn the potential risks well, 
which could appear as the initial short-term effect in driving 
behaviors. The number of intersections is likely to influence 
the type of effect because more intersections are arranged than 
parked cars and pedestrians. 
Both braking and steering interventions are conducted 
when passing by a parked car and a pedestrian. A pedestrian 
is the only object that moves autonomously in courses, unlike 
a parked car. Moreover, previous research using the same 
driving assistance system shows that the change in margin 
between the car and a pedestrian after running with assistances 
was larger than that in the margin between the car and a parked 
car [6] [11]. Therefore, drivers could easily understand the 
potential risks that a pedestrian might run right in front of the 
car. Drivers might increase the margin between the car and a 
pedestrian, which could appear as the initial short-term effect 
in driving behaviors. 
The present study revealed that there is no uniform effect 
of a single driving assistance system and it depends on the 
kinds of risk objects and driving behaviors. Although we used 
only engineering measures in the experiment, it would be 
more beneficial to use both engineering and educational 
measures, such as training, in order to encourage drivers to 
adopt safer behaviors in real life.
