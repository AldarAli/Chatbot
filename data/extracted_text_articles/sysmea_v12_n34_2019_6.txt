Abstract—Today, travelers can readily travel around the world 
using convenient transportation. Not only are opportunities to 
go abroad for sightseeing is increasing, but tourism industries 
of every country are developing indirectly. Moreover, many 
travelers obtain the latest tourist information from the internet 
for their journeys. However, most information specifically 
relates to popular tourist attractions, leading to crowds flocking 
there, which make tourists feel uncomfortable. Contrary to 
existing studies, which specifically emphasize analyses of 
popular tourist attractions, we are striving to disperse crowds 
from popular tourist attractions and provide more spots for 
travelers to choose by discovering less-known tourist attractions. 
This study therefore specifically examines discovery of less-
known Japanese tourist attractions under the assumption that 
these spots exist in unfamiliar cities of tourists. According to 
results of analyzing geo-tagged photographs on Flickr, we use 
the X-means algorithm to group Japanese cities into different 
clusters. X-means is an extension of K-means that improved the 
shortcomings of K-means and which greatly reduced the 
probability of being trapped into a local optimum. Furthermore, 
these clusters were used to survey unfamiliar clusters to 
Japanese and Taiwanese people. Thereby, we can eliminate 
spots that are in familiar clusters. We propose a formula for 
ranking tourist attractions that lets travelers choose these spots 
easily. Results of verification experiments demonstrated that 
some less-known tourist attractions appeal to Taiwanese and 
Japanese. Additionally, we examined some factors that might 
affect respondents as they decide whether a spot is attractive to 
them or not.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
In this era of the internet and smartphones, most people 
can readily share and record their tourist experiences on social 
networking services (SNSs) such as Facebook and Flickr. 
Numerous studies have analyzed user records of tours on SNS 
to elucidate user hobbies and preferences. In doing so, one can 
discover popular tourist attractions and recommend some tour 
plans for users according to their preferences [2]–[5]. Using 
SNSs, one can immediately obtain the newest status of friends, 
particularly using well-known functions related to check-in 
and “geo-tagged” photographs, which are useful when one 
wants to share a location with friends. 
Aside from geolocation, diverse information is available 
from different SNS people users. That information includes 
important and useful data for research. For instance, 
Hausmann et al. [6] pointed out that social media contents 
might provide a swift and cost-efficient substitute for 
traditional surveys. Liu et al. [7] proposed an approach for the 
discovery of areas of interest (AOIs) by analyzing geo-tagged 
photographs and check-in information to suggest popular 
scenic locations and popular spots among travelers. Another 
study with similar aims to those of the present study used SNS 
users’ information and geo-tagged photographs to suggest 
obscure sightseeing locations [8]. 
Most tourists receive sightseeing information through 
travel websites. However, almost all of these websites present 
well-known tourist attractions. Consequently, although the 
attractions are crowded and congested, visitors will be guided 
there. Our preliminary investigation revealed that most 
tourists do not like crowded spots that make them feel 
uncomfortable. 
Many earlier studies have specifically addressed analyses 
of popular tourism attractions or AOIs while neglecting other 
unnoticed places. Our goal for this study is to improve several 
aspects through dispersal of crowds from more popular tourist 
attractions because (1) crowded popular tourist attractions 
make visitors feel uncomfortable, (2) foreign visitors are too 
numerous at popular tourist attractions, raising crime rates 
there, and (3) tourism to regions other than popular regions 
should be supported. 
To accomplish our aim, we analyzed scenic geo-tagged 
photographs taken in Japan obtained from Flickr. After 
identifying some worthwhile and less-known tourist 
attractions, we examined them based on scenic photographs to 
assess their tourism value in terms of human landscapes, 
ecotourism, and natural landscapes. This study specifically 
examines natural landscapes: we used scenic photographs to 
appeal to travelers with natural landscapes. This study

therefore has a clearly defined research scope. Results can 
present more tourist attraction options for tourists and can 
reduce crowding at well-known tourist attractions. 
Our earlier study [1] showed that over half of Taiwanese 
and Japanese respondents liked well-known tourist attractions 
and liked less-known tourist attractions. Also, questionnaire 
results indicated that income has little connection to travel 
frequency. Nevertheless, our earlier study has one point of 
possible improvement. Because of the influence of outliers, 
the grouping method used for the earlier study classified more 
than 70% of data into the same cluster, producing a drastically 
uneven data distribution. This study uses the X-means 
algorithm to ameliorate this shortcoming. Furthermore, we 
revised our earlier formula based on current questionnaire 
results. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: 
Section II introduces related work. Section III is an overview 
of the method. Section IV explains the scenic photograph 
evaluation method. In Section V, we present less-known 
tourist attraction estimation and explain our questionnaire 
results.

improvements and present conclusions and future work.

RELATED WORK 
This section presents discussion of some studies related to 
our research, including benefits and risks of international 
tourism, POI and AOI, cluster analysis. 
A. Benefits and Risks of International Tourism 
Recently, tourism has become a development emphasis for 
many countries because international tourism can not only 
bring huge revenues; it can also have positive effects on 
increased long-run economic growth. Several reports have 
described that international tourism can bring benefits by 
promoting foreign exchange revenues, spurring investment in 
new infrastructure, stimulating other economic industries 
indirectly, and generating employment [9]–[14]. Moreover, 
Algieri et al. [15] reported that determinants of competitive 
advantages in tourism are important for both economically 
advanced and developing economies. Those determinants can 
help policy makers to design better strategies to strengthen 
activities exhibiting potential, improve performance, and 
enhance international competitive advantage, terms of trade, 
and economic growth. 
Although the number of tourists continues to increase and 
bring huge revenues for tourism-related industries, benefits 
from tourism are accompanied by latent crises. Kakamu et al. 
[16] discovered that when the numbers of foreign visitors and 
the police force increase, the crime rate also increases. The 
rising crime rates can be expected to reduce willingness to 
visit and thereby tourism income [17].  
B. POI and AOI 
Points of interest (POIs) differ from areas of interest 
(AOIs). A POI is a particular spot that someone might find 
useful or interesting. They can be landmarks, sightseeing 
spots or commercial institutions of all types such as 
restaurants, hospitals, and supermarkets. Furthermore, POIs 
shown on a digital map must include some information such 
as name, type, longitude, and latitude. Based on data types and 
the discovery procedure, the approaches developed for POI 
are divided into two types. The first type is top-down: 
discovery of POI from an existing POI repository or database, 
such as check-in data or yellow pages that are frequently used 
or fit for a specific theme or target [18]–[20]. The second type 
is bottom-up: raw data (e.g., geotagged photos, digital 
footprints with implicit geographic information or metadata 
that involved latitude and longitude) to construct a new 
database or dataset that includes the POI [21]–[25]. 
By contrast, an AOI might include multiple geographic 
features or areas with no prominent landmarks, such as a café 
on a pedestrian street or several neighboring landmarks. Hu et 
al. [26] proposed that elucidating urban AOIs can provide 
useful information for city planners, transportation analysts, 
and supported location-based service providers to plan new 
businesses and extend existing infrastructure. After they 
collected Flickr photographic data of six cities in six countries, 
they used the DBSCAN clustering algorithm to identify urban 
AOI. 
C. Cluster Analysis 
Cluster analysis, or unsupervised classification, is one 
unsupervised learning technique. Cluster analysis can find 
objects with similar characteristics and can then group 
homogeneous object into clusters. Each cluster is distinct from 
the others. This technique is applied widely in fields such as 
machine learning [27]–[29], image analysis [30]–[31], 
information retrieval [32]–[33], bioinformatics [34]–[35], and 
computer graphics. 
Major cluster analysis algorithms include the following. 
1)  Centroid-based 
Clustering: 
Centroid-based 
clustering is an early approach to clustering analysis in which 
the concept of similarity is computing the distance of a data 
point from the centroid of the clusters. Based on proximity, 
objects are assigned to clusters. Typical approaches are K-
means and K-medoids. The former, K-means, is the more 
widely used because it has high-speed performance and easy 
implementation. 
However, 
K-means 
entails 
some 
shortcomings: K-means is sensitive to initial conditions, 
outliers, etc., and choosing an optimal number is difficult. 
According to shortcomings of K-means and our dataset, we 
used X-means for this study to cluster our data, as presented 
in Section IV. 
2) Connectivity-based 
Clustering 
(Hierarchical 
Clustering): Clusters are constructed by calculating “distance” 
between objects, that can aggregate the similar object into 
same cluster according to the chosen similarity measure. 
Similarity measures include the single-linkage agglomerative 
algorithm, 
complete-linkage 
agglomerative 
algorithm, 
average-linkage agglomerative algorithm, centroid-linkage 
agglomerative algorithm, and Ward’s minimum variance. In 
addition, hierarchical clustering is subdivided as explained 
below. 
a) Agglomerative Approach (bottom-up): In this 
method, each node represents a singleton cluster from the 
216

start. The method proceeds by agglomerating the pair of 
clusters of minimum dissimilarity to obtain a new cluster. 
Finally, nodes are merged successively based on their 
similarities. All nodes belong to the same cluster. 
b) Divisive Approach (top-down): All nodes belong to 
the same cluster. The cluster is classified into sub-clusters, 
which are divided successively into their own sub-clusters; 
eventually, each node forms its own cluster. Hierarchical 
clustering is inappropriate processing for large amounts of 
data. The final result of this method is presented as a 
dendrogram. Clustering of the data objects is obtained by 
cutting the dendrogram at the desired similarity level. 
3) Density-based Clustering: Density-based clustering 
can identify distinctive clusters in the data by separating the 
contiguous region of high point density and regions of low 
point density. The regions of low point density are typically 
regarded as noise/outliers. Common examples of density 
models are DBSCAN [36] and OPTICS [37]. 
4) Grid-based 
Clustering: 
Grid-based 
clustering 
quantizes the data space into limited number of cells which 
form a grid structure, which can obviously reduce the 
computational complexity, especially for clustering very 
large datasets. The representative grid-based clustering 
algorithms are STING [38], WaveCluster [39], and CLIQUE 
[40]. 
III. 
OVERVIEW OF THE METHOD 
Figure 1 shows that this section introduces an overview of 
our method. Our method comprises two components: 
definition of less-known tourist attractions and data 
construction. 
 
 
Figure 1.  Overview of the method. 
A. Definition of Less-Known Tourist Attractions  
To differentiate well-known and less-known tourist 
attractions, we adopt two definitions of less-known tourist 
attractions. 
Definition 1: Only some people know about this tourist 
attraction. 
Definition 2: The tourist attraction deserves to be visited. 
It is attractive for tourists. 
B. Data Construction  
Using Flickr API, we collected 769,749 photographs taken 
in 2017 at geolocations throughout Japan. We extracted the 
photograph latitude and longitude to gather details of 
addresses through Google geocoding API. We found that 309 
photographs were shot in the sky or on the ocean photographs 
had no details of addresses. We classified these photographs 
into different prefectures and cities according to the 
photograph address details. Subsequently, we calculated 
numbers of photographs of 47 prefectures and 1,158 cities. 
Figure 2 presents the Top 10 prefectures and cities in terms of 
the number of photographs. 
 
(a) Top 10 Prefectures for numbers of photographs. 
 
(b) Top 10 Cities for numbers of photographs. 
Figure 2.  Numbers of photographs. 
Next, X-means was used to cluster prefectures and cities 
into different clusters to administer the questionnaire survey 
easily. The prefectures are divided into 4 clusters (see Table 
I). Prefectures are distributed into 14 clusters based on their 
characteristics. We also defined scores of the prefecture 
cluster: cluster 1 can yield 4 points, cluster 2 can yield 3 points, 
and so on. The city cluster score is defined according to 
questionnaire survey results. Furthermore, we extracted 2,671 
scenic photographs with tags that mean scenic in English and 
Japanese (e.g., ''風景''，"景色", ''scenery''), and collected

photographs were ranked using formula proposed in this study. 
Finally, eliminating familiar city clusters according to result

SCENIC PHOTOGRAPH EVALUATION 
This section presents our approach of photograph 
evaluation, first illustrating how to detect the characteristic of 
dataset using a box plot. We can choose the most appropriate 
method of cluster analysis to classify our dataset. Based on the 
box plot result, we select X-means to cluster data in this 
research. We also used the elbow method to set the X-means. 
After analyzing the positive comments of scenic photographs 
by application of our formula, weight of our formula is 
ascertained using the entropy weight method. 
A. Box Plot 
Before clustering our data, we observe their characteristics. 
Subsequently, the suitable approach of cluster analysis can be 
chosen for our data. Therefore, a box plot is used to inspect 
the four features of Japanese cities: number of photographs of 
a city, the rate of the number of photographs of a city, the rate 
of number of photographs of a prefecture, and the average 
number of photographs of a prefecture. 
A box plot, also called box-whisker plot, uses a statistical 
five number summary of dataset to visualize the data scatter. 
The five-number summary includes the minimum, first 
quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum. Moreover, this 
method is usually used to detect dataset outliers or to assess 
data symmetry. 
After using feature scaling to standardize the Japanese city 
dataset, the box plot approach was applied to detect this 
dataset. Results are shown in Figure 3, which presents all 
cities’ data scattering. A disparity between our dataset and the 
outliers are readily apparent in these data. These outliers 
cannot be eliminated because each datum represents a 
Japanese city. Less-known tourist attractions might exist in 
this city. Therefore, improper clustering methods that are 
sensitive to outliers should be avoided. For this study, we used 
X-means to cluster our data as we introduce with the next 
subtask.  
 
 
 
Figure 3.  Box plot of dataset. Index 1 is the number of photographs of the 
city. Index 2 is the rate of the number of photographs of city. Index 3 is the 
rate of the number of photographs of the prefecture. Index 4 is the average 
of the number of photographs of the prefecture. 
B. X-means Algorithm 
    The X-means algorithm is one clustering technique 
proposed by Pelleg and Moore [41] to improve the 
shortcomings of K-means. According to the BIC score, the 
X-means algorithm can automatically determine the optimum 
number of clusters that user set only minimum and maximum 
of clusters. Additionally, this approach greatly reduces the 
probability of being trapped into a local optimum and using 
the kd-tree to increase the computational speed. 
The process steps of X-means are presented below. 
1. 
Input dataset, setting the minimum (Kmin) and 
maximum (Kmax) parameters for the number of 
clusters (K). 
2. 
Run K-means. (K= Kmin) 
3. 
Run 2-means in each cluster according to the BIC 
score to decide splitting it or not. 
4. 
If K > Kmax, then stop and report the best scoring 
model found during the search. Otherwise, go to 
step 2. 
Considering the outliers existing in the data, we used this 
method to distribute the 47 prefectures and 1,158 cities into 
different clusters according to their respective characteristics. 
Furthermore, we set the minimum cluster of X-means by 
referring to the result of elbow method. Finally, we obtain 
more scattered results than those obtained earlier by X-means. 
The city cluster result is presented in Table II.

C. Elbow Method 
The elbow method is the most popular technique used to 
ascertain the optimum number of clusters (K). The elbow 
method concept is calculating the total within-cluster sum of 
squares (wss) for each number of clusters and plotting the 
curve of wss. Therefore, we can ascertain the optimum 
number of clusters by finding the location of the warp (elbow 
point) in the plot of the elbow method. 
Figure 4 and Figure 5 present results of the elbow method 
for cities and prefectures. The values of K are shown on the X 
axis. Those of wss of each K are shown on the Y axis. 
Moreover, in Figure 5, although the wss falls rapidly with K 
increasing from 1 to 4, the slope of line still has a marked 
change thereafter. After K=9, the curve goes down very 
slowly. Consequently, we determine optimum number of 
clusters as 9.

D. Comments’ Sentiment 
For this subtask, we assume that the positive comment is 
that of factors to ascertain whether this sightseeing spot is 
attractive for tourists to visit or not. Therefore, we collected 
the scenic photograph comments. Additionally, we eliminated 
the owner comments from the total comments because almost 
all of these comments are merely replies to the viewer 
comments. Subsequently, we analyzed these comments and 
extracted the positive comments, as shown in Table III.

We specifically examined English and Chinese comments 
using TextBlob [42] and SnowNLP [43], which yielded the 
score of sentiment representing the probability of positive 
meaning. Scores of English comments’ sentiments were -1 to 
1. The Chinese sentiment scores were 0 to 1. To increase the 
accuracy of judgment, the score of English positive comments 
was assumed as more than 0.3; the scores of Chinese positive 
comments were assumed to be greater than 0.4. 
E. Formula of Evaluation 
Considering the definitions of less-known tourist 
attractions and data construction, we propose a formula to 
calculate the score 𝑆" to rank the photographs. 
 
𝑆" = $ 𝐹&"𝑊& + 𝑅" , 0 < 𝑊& < 1 𝑎𝑛𝑑 $ 𝑊& = 1

the weight associated with 𝐹5" . 𝐹2"  represents  the 
photographs’ favorite counts. 𝑊2  is 𝐹2" ’s weight. 𝑅" 
represents the positive comment count of the photographs,

TABLE IV.

PART OF TAIWANESE RANKING RESULT 
which is processed by feature scaling. In this formula, 𝑅" is 
regarded as an additional score because most photographs 
have no associated comments. The weight of 𝑅"  is almost 
equal 0. The photograph favorite counts and positive 
comments were assumed as factors attracting someone to visit. 
Therefore, all scenic photographs can be ranked using this 
formula, as shown in Table IV and Table V. 
Table IV and Table V present some Taiwanese and 
Japanese ranking results. The first column is the GPS address 
of the photograph from Google API. The second column is the 
neighboring popular tourist attraction. The third and fourth 
columns are photograph cluster scores. The fifth column 
shows the favorite count of photographs. The sixth column 
shows counts of the photograph positive comments. The last 
column presents the photograph score as calculated using our 
formula. A high score indicates that the place is attractive to 
travelers. In Table IV, the address of the first row is a famous 
resort in Okinawa. The second row presents a hotel on a 
famous hot spring street. The third row is a well-known tourist 
attraction in Hokkaido. In Table V, the first row presents a 
renowned and historical temple in Kyoto. The third row 
location is near Lake Kawaguchi: one of the Fuji Five Lakes. 
The place of fifth row is near Lake Tazawa, the deepest lake 
in Japan. Others are obscure places. 
F. Entropy Weight Method (EWM) 
For this study, we used EWM to set the weights used for 
the formula. EWM is an objective set weight method because 
it depends only on the discreteness of data. Actually, EWM is 
used widely in the fields of engineering, socioeconomic 
studies, etc. [44]–[46]. 
In information theory, entropy is a kind of uncertainty 
measure. When information is greater, uncertainty and 
entropy are smaller. Based on the entropy information 
properties, one can estimate the randomness of an event and 
the degree of randomness through calculation of the entropy 
value. Furthermore, entropy values are used to gauge a sort of 
discreteness degree of index. When the degree of discreteness 
is larger, the index affecting the integrated assessment is 
expected to be greater. 
To complete the setting of the formula weights, we require 
the steps, as described below.  
1) Calculate the ratio (𝑃"7) of the i-th index under the j- 
th index. Therein, 𝑥"7 denotes the j-th index of the i-th 
sample.

scenic photographs. Results show the weight of the formula in 
this research by EWM. In the equations (1), Taiwanese and 
Japanese weights differ because their city clusters are assigned 
distinct scores based on the results of questionnaire surveys. 
The weight results are shown in Table VI: Taiwanese 𝑊4 is 
equal to 0.1338; 𝑊5 is equal to 0.1346 and 𝑊2 is equal to 
0.7316. Japanese 𝑊4 is equal to 0.1619; 𝑊5 is equal to 0.1228

LESS-KNOWN TOURIST ATTRACTION ESTIMATION 
A. Familiarity Level of Japanese City 
For this study, we assume the less-known tourist 
attractions might be included in unfamiliar city clusters. 
Accordingly, a questionnaire was designed and administered 
to 115 Taiwanese and 123 Japanese people to ascertain their 
level of familiarity with Japanese cities. Nevertheless, 
surveying levels of familiarity of each city (1,158 cities) from 
respondents was difficult. For that reason, we clustered the 
Japanese city data. Thereby, we were able to select a city’s 
name randomly from each cluster to decrease the number of 
questionnaire questions. It was easier to find which cities were 
unfamiliar to respondents. 
According to the scale of each cluster, 30 city names were 
selected randomly for this questionnaire. Participants were 
provided with five choices to answer the city questions: (1) I 
have absolutely no idea. (2) I have heard of this city, but I do 
not know its tourist attractions. (3) I have heard of this city 
and know its tourist attractions. (4) I have been to this city, but 
I do not know its tourist attractions. (5) I have been to this city 
and know its tourist attractions. A respondent choosing option 
(1) is assigned 1 point for this question; option (2) yields 2 
points, and so on, with higher scores representing greater 
familiarity with this city. 
Considering that we used the survey sampling approach to 
conduct the questionnaire survey, it might include sampling 
error. To decrease inaccuracy from the sampling error, we 
categorized the cluster as a less-known one using t-tests and 
p-value. 
 
t =
𝑥 − 𝜇
𝑠
√𝑛
 
(6) 
Student's t-test can determine whether a statistically 
significant difference exists between the means of two 
unrelated groups. This approach has three types: one-
sample t-test, independent-sample t-test, and paired sample 
t-test. For this study, we used one-sample t-test to analyze 
our result of questionnaire survey, which can compare 
population means with a sample mean, and found their 
relation. In the following equation (6), 𝑥  represents the 
sample means, 𝜇 denotes the population mean, 𝑠 stands for 
the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size. After 
calculating the t-test values, we used p-value to determine 
whether the sample mean was greater than the population 
mean or not. If the p-value of cluster was less than 0.05, 
then we judged this cluster as an unfamiliar cluster. 
Conversely, the cluster will be categorized into familiar 
clusters when the p-value is greater than 0.05.

Table VII and Table VIII show that we calculated the 
average scores of respective clusters. Table VII and Table VIII 
present results of unfamiliar clusters. The first column shows 
the number of clusters. The second column is each cluster 
average score from the questionnaire survey. The third 
column shows the t-test statistic value. The fourth column 
presents p-values. The last column presents which cluster is 
unfamiliar. In Table VII, one can understand that cluster 3, 
cluster 7, cluster 12, cluster 13, and cluster 14 are unfamiliar 
to Taiwanese. Moreover, Table VIII shows that Japanese 
people are unfamiliar with cluster 3, cluster 6, cluster 7, cluster 
11, cluster 13, and cluster 14. Finally, we can remove these 
familiar clusters from the ranking results of Section IV as our 
aim. 
 
B. Verification Experiment 
Based on the discussion presented above, we can ascertain 
which group is unfamiliar to the Taiwanese respondents 
(clusters 3, 7, 12–14) and to the Japanese respondents (clusters 
3, 6, 7, 11, 13, 14). In this section, we also use the 
questionnaire to verify these less-known tourist attractions, 
which are obscure but attractive to respondents. 
For the verification experiment, we extracted the top 10 
less-known tourist attractions from nine cities of the 
Taiwanese and Japanese unfamiliar clusters to investigate 10 
Taiwanese people (who have touristic experience in Japan) 
and 10 Japanese people, whose questionnaires responses were 
dissimilar. Two questions were asked for each attraction: “Do 
you know this city?” If respondents probably know this city, 
then the answer was “Yes.” The second question was 
“According to this photograph, do you want to visit this place 
of city?” For the second question, respondents assigned a 
score of 1–5 for the attraction, with a higher score indicating 
greater attraction. 
 
Figure 6.  Result of verification experiment. 
This result of the verification experiment showed that 
these places are known by extremely few people, which is 
better than the previous result. In Figure 6, each point 
represents a place in the questionnaire, the horizontal axis 
presents how many people know the less-known tourist 
attraction, the vertical axis shows the attractive level of each 
less-known tourist attraction. The Taiwanese result presents 
the average score of four places are over than 4 points, which 
means these places are attractive for Taiwanese respondents. 
Especially, one place score approaches the full mark. Some 
Taiwanese respondents reported that a few scenic photographs 
are similar to scenery in their own country, which might 
influence their decision. Moreover, for the place with the 
lowest score, the photograph quality was not very high. As a 
result, the respondents assigned few points for this place. The 
required cost of Taiwanese includes a monetary cost and time 
cost, which are higher than those of Japanese people. 
Consequently, Taiwanese prefer to choose tourism attractions 
that include local characteristics or exceptional landscapes. 
For the Japanese result, although only one spot yielded 
over 4 points, two other spots yielded over 3.5 points, 
indicating that Japanese respondents are not excluded from 
visiting these spots. Furthermore, we investigated the answers 
of each Japanese respondent in depth and detected that the 
disparity between their decisions decreased the average. This 
situation expresses that respondents chose the answer 
according to their preference of scenic spots. For instance, 
someone who likes the ocean, but does not like mountains will 
assign a higher score for seascape photographs. Therefore, the 
average of each spot is less than 4 points. Figure 6 also shows 
an interesting situation. The Taiwanese trendline shows that 
the number of people and average score are in direct 
proportion, but the Japanese trendline is inverse to that of the 
Taiwanese curve: Japanese people prefer to visit less-known 
tourist attractions. 
VI. 
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
We proposed a novel method to identify less-known 
tourist attractions for people of different nationalities. By 
collecting and analyzing Flickr photograph information, we 
classified them into prefectures and cities. Subsequently, we 
classified these prefectures and cities into different groups.

Additionally, we used a questionnaire to survey 
Taiwanese respondents and Japanese respondents. We 
obtained unfamiliar city clusters of Taiwanese and Japanese 
respondents. Scenic photographs were ranked using the 
formula for this research. Familiar city clusters were removed 
from respondent ranking results. A second questionnaire 
survey verified our results. Through this research, we found 
less-known tourist attractions for travelers. 
The first questionnaire survey gave the surprising result 
that Taiwanese respondents are more familiar with Japanese 
cities than Japanese respondents are. The reason might be that 
Taiwan and Japan are neighboring countries. In addition, air 
travel from Taiwan to Japan is cheaper, which might engender 
a higher frequency of Taiwanese taking trips to Japan. Results 
show that most Taiwanese respondents prefer individual 
travel in Japan to travelling with groups. 
The verification experiment revealed an interesting thing: 
we provide two seascape photographs from distinct spots for 
Taiwanese respondents. One photograph shows the “torii”, 
which is the traditional gate of Japanese shrines. The other 
only has a clear ocean and beach. Two Taiwanese respondents 
said that the seascape is common in Taiwan, but they are very 
interested in the first seascape because of this spot, which 
includes “torii.” Scenic photographs including some special 
landmarks are expected to increase the attractiveness of these 
spots. 
Interviews of some Taiwanese respondents to ascertain 
what factors lead them to prefer to travel in Japan indicated 
four main reasons it is attractive to Taiwanese. The first reason 
is that air tickets are cheaper and the flight time is short. The 
second reason is that the Japanese environment is neat and tidy. 
Furthermore, public security is high. The third reason is that 
Japanese foods are delicious and exquisite. The fourth reason 
is that Japanese character and culture are similar to those of 
Taiwan, which can help Taiwanese people travel in Japan 
easily. 
As future work, after collecting and analyze more 
photographs taken in distinct years, we expect to sort the 
photographs with lowest quality from our data and remove 
them. Providing higher-quality photographs for travelers 
might induce them to visit. Considering more factors of 
discovering less-known tourist attractions, we expect to 
improve the formula used for this research. Less-known 
tourist attractions will be classified into different types (e.g., 
ocean, mountain, sky), seasons, weather, days, and nights 
according to the times and contents of photographs. We also 
want to provide a personal recommendation service based on 
collaborative filtering.
