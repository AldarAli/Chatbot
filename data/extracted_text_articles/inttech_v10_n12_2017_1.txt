Abstract—An increasing customer usage of Internet services 
with various devices demands a greater effort on data security 
and privacy issues, because more and more devices are con-
nected and much personal information are spread more widely. 
However, in many cases the performance of services is more im-
portant than the provision of data security. Therefore, it would 
be necessary to investigate how the user perception of data se-
curity influences the usage of Internet services, which will be an-
alyzed with a adjusted combined approach of the Technology 
Acceptance Model and the second model of the Unified Theory 
of Acceptance and Use of Technology. To support the analysis 
of this conceptual relationship, an evaluation of the interrelation 
between the perceived data security importance and the user be-
havior is also examined. The aim of this paper is to figure out a 
possible negative impact of the perception of data security and 
security importance on the usage of Internet services. The goal 
of the paper is to prove an influence of data security within an 
adjusted conceptual model based on the Technology Acceptance 
Model and the second model of the Unified Theory of Ac-
ceptance and Use of Technology. In general, a significant rela-
tionship between the perceived data security, perceived data se-
curity importance and user behavior of Internet services cannot 
be found. Particularly, some regressive influences are proved in 
the perceptions of data security importance and usage of specific 
services. The primary result of this paper is that from the per-
spective of customers the general perceived data security is sig-
nificantly most influenced by the perceived email accounts secu-
rity.

INTRODUCTION 
During the last 10 to 15 years, more and more people use 
Internet services. This development leads to a rising global 
Internet penetration and data flow [1][2]. Furthermore, most 
people use mainly services for social media, broadcast-
ing/streaming, gaming and cloud computing. Especially dur-
ing the last years, people started to use the different services 
with various devices [3][4]. Due to this application of ser-
vices the devices get connected among each other. Hence, it 
can be assumed that the personal user data spread to a larger 
degree [3]. For the customers of Internet services, it is elusive 
where the personal data is stored and who gets access to the 
data, because the smart connected devices cover a wide range 
of information over geographical boundaries [4][5]. Finally, 
the usage of Internet services by customers faces the prob-
lems of data security and privacy from the user perspective. 
Personal data include critical information about and intellec-
tual properties. These data are countable assets from which 
enterprises, companies and also criminals can benefit [6].  
In general, the users are responsible for which personal 
data they spread for the usage of different Internet services. 
Hurdle free communication, marketing measures and adver-
tisements disclose also more personal data of the users. Fur-
thermore, a lot of people are willing to share their personal 
data in ignorance of risks of data leakage and data theft to 
reach higher reputation and more contacts. Out of it, it can be 
concluded that data security and privacy gets more and more 
important, because more personal data is disclosed and often 
the users are not able to examine who gets access to their per-
sonal information and who uses them for legal and illegal mo-
tives [1]. However, it cannot be distinguished between (a) 
customers, who disclose their personal information and are 
not aware of the consequences and (b) customers, who com-
pletely know the consequences of data disclosure.  
The authors will figure out what the user perception of data 
security and data security importance is, when they use dif-
ferent Internet services with various devices, especially mo-
bile devices with wireless Internet connections. Moreover, 
each Internet usage is in direct connection with data security 
and privacy issues. For these reasons, it needs to be investi-
gated whether a higher perception of data security and trust 
in a service leads to a preferred usage of this service or device 
[1]. Accordingly, the authors analyze what the users of Inter-
net services do or not do to prevent unauthorized access to 
their personal data. Despite the issue that influence factors 
can possibly impact the user behavior of Internet services, the 
authors will focus on the relation between the perceived data 
security and the usage of Internet services. The authors will 
not deeply analyze the relation and terms of data privacy and 
the misuse of disclosed data.  
Generally, the topic describes a global problem, because 
all over the world customers distribute information and com-
panies, criminals and others use the data for their advantages. 
Nevertheless, the authors focused on the current situation in 
Germany. 
In Section II, the term data security, the challenges and the 
used research models will be described. In Section III, the

methodology presents the theoretical approach for conduct-
ing the study based on presented research models. Following 
this section, the authors will present the data analysis and 
some key results of the survey.  In Section V, the authors will 
critically discuss their results and problems of the survey. In 
the last Section, the improvements of the current research and 
the used survey will be described.

LITERATURE REVIEW 
A. Data Security 
Data security means that users want to keep their personal 
data to themselves. Here, it must be clear for them, who gets 
access to the personal information. Hence, no one should get 
access to the user’s personal data, who does not have the right 
permission for the usage [5]. However, a lot of companies use 
personal data of customers, which customers spread in their 
Internet services, because a lot of users are not fully aware of 
the possible risks of sharing information [6][7]. Furthermore, 
they do not know which huge amount of data they produce 
and how they can prevent such risks [8]. This behavior could 
be a problem for residential users, because 56% of Internet 
services and platforms transmit personal information without 
permissions to third parties [9]. So, users should be better in-
formed and aware of their personal data. In many cases, per-
sons divulge information, which they may regret in a future 
situation. Furthermore, the data can be linked to critical per-
sonal information like credit card numbers, etc. [6][7]. 
Otherwise, the users also have to prevent unauthorized ac-
cesses by changing the passwords regularly, what the authors 
also investigate with a survey. If the users lose their access 
and their data is leaked, the users have to bear negative con-
sequences up to the loss in reputation of image, business part-
ners, relatives and friends [3]. 
User perspective, company perspective, companies’ duties  
In general, users fear: (a) capturing of passwords and ac-
counts, (b) blackmails, (c) eavesdropping, and (d) undesired 
access to personal data from criminals [3]. The users want a 
secure transmission of data and the services should guarantee 
integrity, availability and confidentiality of the data and their 
transmission [10]. 
B. Challenges 
The main challenge for analyzing user perceptions of data 
security is that all user attitudes and beliefs are completely 
subjective and depend on demographic (age) and cultural fac-
tors, which influence the customers’ willingness to share data 
[6].  These discrepancies also include that each user has his 
perceptions of risks and prevention of risks. In many cases 
the people prefer to look for the performance of services in-
stead of the security and data protection measures. To in-
crease the customer caution concerning the disclosure and 
leakage of private data, services should insert several 
measures and rules which the customers have to comply with 
to use the services [11]. Furthermore, services and applica-
tions should state information about consequences of misuse 
and data leakage and insert different messages to make sure 
that the users understand the impacts of their data distribu-
tion. However, it is necessary to investigate what kind of im-
pact the factors have on the individual perception of data se-
curity and the influence on the usage of Internet services, es-
pecially mobile services. Nonetheless, the authors will focus 
on the perceived data security of customers and will not eval-
uate the consequences of data disclosure.  
C. Research Model – Technology Acceptance Model and 
Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2  
For the analysis of the relation between the perception of 
data security and the user behavior regarding Internet ser-
vices, the authors will use the Technology Acceptance Model 
(TAM) [12][13]. To support the findings and background re-
search, the authors also use the Unified Theory of Acceptance 
and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2), which can be used to 
examine the relation of external variables and the user behav-
ior of a new service/innovation [14]. The application of both 
models enables a consideration of the presented problem be-
low in the way of an organizational and customer perspective. 
Due to the focus on private customers, the application of the 
UTAUT2 will be more useful to analyze the user acceptance 
of Internet services [14]. However, the longer experience and 
greater research background of the TAM gives the authors 
some implications about the acceptance and usage of Internet 
services, especially mobile services. Furthermore, the authors 
do not limit the questions in the survey for private usage. 
Thus, the respondents could answer for their business and pri-
vate usage of services. Therefore, both models (TAM and 
UTAUT2) can be used for the evaluation of influences be-
tween data security issues and the usage of Internet services.  
The TAM shall clarify how the customer’s individual ac-
ceptance of Information Technologies (IT) can be explained 
and predicted [12][13]. Our paper will focus on the depend-
ence of the usage of mobile Internet services on security is-
sues and the acceptance of new technologies. It is currently 
known that the perceived usefulness has a positive impact on 
behavioral intentions, which leads to an actual customer us-
age [13]. However, perceived usefulness does not cover the 
user’s perception, that the usage of the service will enhance 
his performance [12].  
The UTAUT describes four key concepts (performance 
expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitat-
ing conditions), which impact the consumer acceptance and 
behavioral intention of an innovation or technology [15][16]. 
Generally, it is known that the behavioral intention normally 
leads to a usage of the service [17]. Venkatesh et al. expand 
their own model with the factors hedonic motivation, price, 
and habit, which are classified as critical influence factors 
and predictors of consumer behavior and have been intro-
duced in the UTAUT2 [14][15]. The UTAUT2 shall illustrate 
how the customers accept new technologies [18]. Especially 
the factors (a) costs, (b) usage advantage, (c) economic effort, 
and (d) expenditure of time are determining if a customer de-
cides to use or not to use an innovation [18]. In the context of 
2

this paper, the habit and experience of usage could be a pos-
sible impact factor, which is described at the end of this sub-
chapter. The other possible influence factors are not consid-
ered in detail. 
Moreover, perceived usefulness and behavioral intentions 
in the TAM are not able to analyze and to reflect the per-
ceived data security, importance of data security and the 
adoption of Internet services, especially mobile Internet ser-
vices.  
In consideration of Appendix 1, Escorbar-Rodriguez and 
Carvajal-Trujillo adapt the UTAUT2 with the external varia-
ble trust [19], which is influenced by several further compo-
nents like perceived security and perceived privacy. As men-
tioned above, the UTAUT2 also describes different con-
cepts/factors as impact factors on the behavioral intention to 
use of an innovation or service [14]. 
The authors analyze the direct relationship of the percep-
tion of data security and importance of data security on the 
actual usage of an Internet service. As displayed in Figure 1, 
the hypotheses will be directly organized for the relationship 
of the named factors perceived data security and perceived 
importance of data security and the use of the Internet ser-
vices. Before these relationships will be examined, the rela-
tion between the both possible impact factors will be meas-
ured too. To support the both components and to address pos-
sible data security measures by the customers. The password 
behavior of customers in email and Social Media accounts is 
analyzed as well. The frequency of password-changes is an 
indicator for the importance of data security. Therefore, the 
authors decide to design the conceptual model in the way as 
it can be seen in Figure 1. The password changing behavior, 
perceived data security and perceived importance of data se-
curity are the external variables, which directly influence the 
actual usage of Internet services by the customers.    
 
Next to the described external variables, credibility as a 
further factor could be perceived. This factor includes the us-
ers’ belief that the used systems and their according attitudes 
would be free of threats for privacy and security [17]. It is 
further known that perceived credibility positively influences 
the behavioral intention to use [20]. Lin et al. have figured 
out that data security and privacy are the most affecting fac-
tors for an acceptance and adoption of a new technology [17]. 
It must be expected that using mobile Internet services will 
often imply security or privacy threats [20].  
Therefore, the authors examine how the perception of data 
security and the importance of data security of specific Inter-
net services influence the usage of the services. Furthermore, 
the component perceived security will be supported by Zhong 
et al. [22], which uses perceived security as external variable 
to show the influence on the behavioral intention to use mo-
bile payments.  
Normally, the external variable perceived security could 
additionally cover customer concerns about risk (perceived 
risk), trust and privacy concerns [21]. The named variables 
also influence the customer decision of adoption. Here, espe-
cially trust plays a major role, because trust describes how the 
customers perceive the credible and secure information and 
experiences of the providers [19][23][24][25]. Based on the 
assumption that perceived risks and trust directly influence 
the usage processes [26], the customers will reduce their us-
age if expect a loss of privacy and a higher risk in usage [27]. 
Therefore, the authors will not exclude these criterions and 
analyze this the influence of trust as a determinant of usage 
behavior in a second survey [28][29].   
Generally, the aim of the analysis is to illustrate how the 
customers perceive their data security and how they rank the 
importance of data security for each Internet service they use.

In comparison to the presented relationships between the 
estimation of perceived security, risks and trust and the usage 
of mobile banking or mobile payments [20][21][22], the au-
thors consider different Internet services for the analysis of 
the relation between usage of services and the perceived data 
security and perceived importance of data security. As men-
tioned in the description of the conceptual model in Figure 1, 
both named concepts will be supported by the external pass-
word changing behavior (for emails and Social Media). Nor-
mally, the password changing behavior could be possibly a 
criterion of the perceived importance of data security but the 
authors are not sure if the customers perceive the same con-
nection. It can be assumed that customers with a higher 
awareness of data security will change their passwords more 
regularly Therefore, the authors will analyze if the password 
changing behavior fits to the perceived importance of data 
security. Based on this examination, the authors will test if 
password changing behavior also relates to the perceived data 
security and usage behavior.  
 
The research hypotheses of this paper are: 
 
 
H1: A higher customer perception of importance of data 
security leads to higher perceived data security.   
 
H2: The customer perception of data security (perceived 
security) has a directly positive effect on the usage of (mo-
bile) Internet services.  
 
H3: The customer perception of data security importance 
(perceived importance of data security) has a directly posi-
tive effect on the usage of (mobile) Internet services.  
 
H4: A higher customer perception of importance of data 
security leads to an increasing password changing behavior.   
 
H5: An increased customer password changing behavior 
leads to a higher perception of data security.   
 
H6: An increased customer password changing behavior 
leads to an increased usage of (mobile) Internet services.  
 
As mentioned, a couple of external variables could possi-
bly describe security issues and threats in consideration of the 
usage of Internet services, especially mobile Internet ser-
vices. For example, Chen identified that the perceived risk 
can be seen as one of the key drivers for the estimation of 
uncertainties in mobile payments [20][21][22]. Conse-
quently, customers are paying attention to the products and 
their providers if they take care about the customers’ transac-
tions and personal information security in the usage of mobile 
payments [22]. This presented relationship is supported by 
different researches regarding mobile payments as important 
issues 
in 
the 
trust 
of 
services 
[30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38]. Zhong et al. and 
Abrahão et al. figured out that trust and perceived risk have 
significant influence on customer acceptance of mobile pay-
ments [20][21][22]. In consideration of the mentioned-above 
factors habit and motivation from the UTAUT2, Lu et al. also 
illustrate that the usage of mobile payment services is posi-
tively influenced by the experience and confidence of the cus-
tomers [39]. This connection supports the previous descrip-
tions and findings and will be more deeply described in the 
paragraph below. Moreover, an influence of trust and per-
ceived risk on the acceptance of mobile banking is found too 
[40][41]. Considering the usage of mobile shopping, trust is 
also an important influence factor [42]. Besides mobile bank-
ing, mobile payments and mobile shopping, the perceived se-
curity issues are even higher in mobile telecommunication 
networks, due to the fact that mobile networks are shared me-
diums and different persons can use the same mobile radio 
cell in the same time. This structure makes the system more 
vulnerable for attacks within the network [43]. Zhou also fig-
ured out that especially mobile transactions are critical for the 
perceptions of trust [28]. The mobile network operators and 
providers have to take care about these issues and the intro-
duction of security measures can mitigate uncertainties and 
risks [44][45][46]. The development of trust in a service is a 
major aim for customers and providers, because the trust in a 
service increase the customer convenience of the customer 
and normally leads to a higher performance [26][47]. So, trust 
needs to be developed [28]. However, especially in mobile 
banking the customers fear a lack of control, which results in 
a greater uncertainty [28]. Consequently, the literature con-
veys the feedback that in several cases trust and the percep-
tion of security, risks and uncertainties influence the cus-
tomer user behavior. All examples and findings demonstrate 
that possible security issues can significant negatively influ-
ence the intention to use mobile Internet services. Therefore, 
the authors have set the hypotheses that a better perception in 
data security leads to an increased usage of services. 
As mentioned above, the habit and experience with the us-
age of a service could be a possible impact factor regarding 
the issues of trust. Generally, people gain experience with a 
usage of the service over time, people are able to learn the 
working process and the handling of the service will be more 
familiar [15][48]. Besides the gained knowledge and in-
creased opportunities with the application, the customers are 
able to develop an increased trust [46]. In the context of mo-
bile Internet services, Venkatesh et al. test the new developed 
concepts of the UTAUT2 on the acceptance of mobile Inter-
net technologies [14]. However, the findings of Venkatesh et 
al. describe a decreasing behavioral intention in case of rising 
usage experiences [14], which can be supported by the fact 
that old known habits and experiences cannot be easily 
dropped by the customers [30]. On the other hand, the expec-
tations of customers can change if the experience with the us-
age of the service increases. Consequently, the impact of ex-
periences and habits cannot be clearly predicted, due to posi-
tive and negative influences on the behavioral intentions of

usage. Therefore, the authors decide to not include this vari-
able in this paper. Nevertheless, uncertainties and risks nor-
mally base on a lack of experience [49][50][51][52][53].  
 
III. 
METHODOLOGY 
To examine these hypotheses, the authors will use a survey 
to prove that data security issues have a negative impact on 
user behavior of mobile Internet services. For the analysis of 
the individual customer groups, separate cross-sectional sur-
veys ("one-shot surveys") will be conducted within a short 
period of time [54]. Here, the answers are taken by interview-
ers in personal oral interviews, thus ensuring completeness 
and accuracy of the answers. The personal interview will be 
conducted on the basis of a random quota sample based on 
the demographic characteristics of gender and age in order to 
be representative of the local population [55][56]. In general, 
the interviewers select their test persons at public places like 
libraries and in the pedestrian zone in Wiesbaden (Germany) 
to reach a diversified and representative number of test per-
sons. The first survey (440 completed questionnaires) which 
the authors use to gain information about the mobile data us-
age have been held in 2016, and was a pre-test, which the 
authors use to get information from the test persons and to 
verify whether the posed questions fit to answer the hypoth-
eses and presented concepts. In 2017, another survey run with 
inclusion of the gained results and information to reach better 
analyses of the developed concepts. 
The data has been analyzed based on quantitative research 
methods with the statistical program Statistical Package for 
the Social Sciences (SPSS). After the evaluation of credibil-
ity and reliability, which will be tested with the Cronbach’s 
Alpha, the Exploratory Factor Analysis has been done to en-
sure the validity and to present related groups of perceptions 
and services. The perceived data security will be queried with 
the question, how the customers perceive their personal data 
in the virtual world (5-Point-Likert-scale: very secure to very 
unsecure). To cover the frequency of (mobile) Internet ser-
vices usage and the perception of the importance of data se-
curity, a 5-Point-Likert-scale (very often to very few and very 
important to very unimportant) has been implemented [57]. 
Besides the consideration of the general perception of data 
security, the authors consider mainly the usage and percep-
tion of data security and importance of data security of the 
services: (a) email, (b) social media, (c) online telephony, (d) 
online shopping, (e) cloud computing, (f) e-learning, and (g) 
instant messaging. Other factors, which are included in the 
survey, are navigation, gaming, online baking, online admin-
istration, internet television and video on demand. Based on 
the fact that the behavioral intention leads in an actual cus-
tomer usage [13], the analysis of the survey shall present the 
regression between the external variables perceived data se-
curity and user behavior and as well perceived importance of 
data security and user behavior. Therefore, the authors use 
the Ordinary Least Square Regression to test the significance 
of each of the named hypotheses. 
IV. 
DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS 
A. 
Descriptive Results 
56.0% of the asked test persons are female and the group 
of persons with an age between 20 and 29 years describes an 
over-representation in this survey with a share of 47.4%. 
Based on statistical elevations, it can be noted that this age 
group represents only 12.2% in Germany [58]. Following 
previous researches activities from ARD/ZDF in 2015, the 
group of people between 20 to 29 years almost completely 
uses the Internet [59]. This situation does not comply with the 
aim to get a representative picture of the German market. But 
this high proportion of Internet users is able to reach better 
results for the test of the influence of data security issues on 
the usage of Internet services, especially mobile services. As 
mentioned, the most test persons use both Internet services 
(based on mobile networks as well as on fixed networks). 
Therefore, they are able to describe the perceptions of usage 
of services. Contrarily, only a smaller share of elder partici-
pants uses the Internet services and so these mostly cannot 
fully estimate their perceptions of the usage of services, be-
havior and their security issues. Consequently, the final di-
rection of the data and their representative nature cannot be 
fully reached and confirmed.  
In general, 43.6% of the participants are feeling a data un-
certainty. On the opposite, only 3.5% of the interviewed per-
sons are perceiving their data to be very secure. Following 
these results, which are displayed in Table I, the participants 
perceive the estimation and importance of data security of the 
services differently. Services which are related to financial 
payments are superiorly estimated with a higher importance 
of data security. In contrast, approximately half of the asked 
persons perceives the necessity of a high data security in the 
services email, social media and instant messaging.  
 
TABLE I. Importance of Data Security.  
 
Internet Services 
Importance of Data Security 
Email 
56.3% very high importance 
Social Media 
45.6% very high importance 
Online Shopping 
64.3% very high importance 
Online Banking 
86.0% very high importance 
Instant Messaging 
47.3% very high importance 
 
Supporting the illustrated perceptions of data security, the 
authors have included questions about the perceived neces-
sity (a) to change the passwords for email and social media 
accounts, and (b) to use an anti-virus program. Over two third 
of interviewees (69.7% for email, 68.5% for social media) 
have answered that they change their passwords less than 
once a year. The authors conclude that they normally never 
change their passwords. However, 84.7% of the persons use 
anti-virus programs to protect their devices. Generally, the 
usage of the anti-virus program should not include costs, be-
cause 70.9% of the persons use the free version of the anti-
virus programs. Following the numbers of McAfee, 14.5% of 
the German Internet users do not use an anti-virus program

 [60]. Based on this study’s results, the 15.3% of persons 
which are not using an anti-virus program indicate a similar 
and representative relation of the generated data.    
B. Reliability and Validity 
The results of the reliability and validity analyses are illus-
trated in Table II. Generally, the examined concepts of Inter-
net service usage and data security are reliable and valid. Fol-
lowing Cronbach, the Cronbach’s Alpha values have to be 
greater than 0.7 to present a good reliability [61][62][63]. 
This value has been achieved by all questions analyzing the 
concepts. The consideration of the exploratory factor analysis 
includes the assessment of Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin criterion, the 
significance test from Bartlett, and the examination of the cu-
mulative variance [64][65][66][67][68]. All of the combined 
questions for the analysis of the determined concepts (a) per-
ceived security, (b) security importance, and (c) user behav-
ior (see Figure 1) have reached significant p values (p<0.05) 
in the Bartlett-Test. Furthermore, all concepts boast Kaiser-
Meyer-Olkin 
values 
above 
the 
mark 
of 
0.7 
[64][65][66][67][68]. Both tests describe a good validity of 
the gained data. Moreover, the cumulative variances from all 
considered concepts are above 50%, which indicate high ex-
planation rates of the variances in the collected data 
[65][66][67]. Consequently, the reliability and validity of the 
collected data are proved. Due to the presented differences in 
the demographics, the asked persons do not completely func-
tion as a representative mirror of the situation in the German 
market.  
C. Correlation Analyses 
The correlation analyses are divided in two parts. Firstly, 
the authors will contemplate the correlations of the percep-
tions of data security in general and in single service consid-
erations. Secondly, the authors also correlate the results of the 
perceived importance of data security with the results of the 
perceived data security in general and for the single services. 
Thirdly, the correlations between the usage of Internet ser-
vices (fixed-line and mobile) and the perceptions of data se-
curity (in general and single view) are considered. 
 
TABLE II. Results of the Reliability and Validity Tests. 
 
Firstly, the general data security perception does not cor-
relate significantly (p>0.05) with the individual perceptions 
of data security from the single services. In consideration of 
individual perceptions of the services, customer perceptions 
of data security for (a) email, (b) social media, (c) online te-
lephony, (d) online shopping, (e) cloud computing, (f) e-
learning, (g) instant messaging, and (h) online administration 
correlate significantly positively (p<0.05) with the percep-
tions of data security of the other services (see Table III and 
Appendix 2).  
The correlation predicts that if a customer perceives a 
higher data security in the usage of email, social media, in-
stant messaging, and online shopping, they will intensively 
perceive a higher data security in the other services. Equally, 
the customer rates the named services with a higher im-
portance of data security. 
The consideration of the correlation coefficient follows the 
classification that high correlation coefficients have Pearson 
correlation values above 0.5 [69][70]. In Table III, the data 
security perceptions of the following Internet services corre-
late strongly with each other: (1) e-learning and online ad-
ministration (value 0.705), (2) instant messaging and social 
media (value = 0.601), (3) email and online telephony (value 
= 0.593), (4) email and online shopping (value = 0.546), and 
(5) instant messaging and online telephony (value 0.504).  
Due to the values above 0.5, the authors assume that a re-
lation between these factors exists. Consequently, the corre-
lations do not indicate a significant connection between the 
general perceived data security and (a) the perceived data se-
curity for the single services and (b) importance of data secu-
rity for the single services. It is doubtful if the further regres-
sion analyses may find significant regressive relationships 
between the named variables. Nonetheless, the correlations 
show that each perception of data security for each specific 
single service correlates positively with each other. This 
means if a customer perceives one service as more secure, he 
feels the same for other services. The same relation is valid 
for the perceived importance of data security.

TABLE III. Correlation Analysis of Data Security Perceptions of selected services. 
 
A linkage between the data security perceptions of email 
services, online shopping and online telephony follows the 
natural order, due to the fact that the online shopping and 
online telephony normally need an email account for the re-
ceipts of transactions and verification of the user. Therefore, 
the customers evaluate the same security issues on the named 
three services. The relations between the assessment of data 
security of instant messaging and social media and online te-
lephony can also be comprehended. Based on the fact that 
social media platforms and online telephony providers in-
clude instant messaging systems in their service, the custom-
ers perceive similarly.  
The interrelation of e-learning and online administration 
can be drawn in the point that both systems are based on plat-
forms which cover personal user behavior and data. 
Interestingly, the frequency of changing the email pass-
word also significantly correlates positively (p<0.05) with all 
of the individual data perceptions of the specific services. If 
a customer changes his password more frequently, he will 
feel safer in the usage of the services and rates the services 
with higher data security importance. However, a significant 
correlation between the password changing behaviors and the 
general perceived data security cannot be found.  
 
It must be predicted that the perceived data security does 
not depend on the password changing behavior for email and 
Social Media accounts.  
Secondly, the consideration of the usage of Internet ser-
vices will be divided in the customer fixed-line application 
and mobile application consideration. In each consideration 
(mobile and fixed-line), the usage of all Internet services cor-
relates significantly positively (p<0.05) with each other (see 
Appendix 3 and 4). It can be predicted that if a customer 
chooses to use one service that he will also use other Internet 
services. Based on the high correlation coefficients over 0.5 
(fixed correlation coefficients: 0.5 to 0.7; mobile correlation 
coefficients 0.2 to 0.6), it can be assumed that the perceptions 
of data security of the specific services belong to each other 
and could have a linear relationship [69][70]. However, the 
usage of the Internet services in the fixed-line network does 
not correlate significantly with the usage of the Internet ser-
vices in the mobile network overall. Here, the authors have to 
assume that the usages of the Internet services within the 
fixed-line and mobile networks do not directly interact with 
each other. This relation does not fit with the current status of 
knowledge, because normally there is a relationship between

the usage of Internet services in fixed-line and mobile infra-
structures.  
The comparison of usage and data security illustrates that 
the general perception of data security does not correlate sig-
nificantly (p>0.05) with the usage of Internet services (mo-
bile and fixed-line) (see Table IV and V). However, in con-
sideration of the specific Internet services, the authors get 
some positive and negative correlations. The usage of emails 
correlates significantly (p<0.05, Pearson-value = 0.105) with 
the perception of data security for emails (see Table VI). De-
spite a lower correlation coefficient [69][70], it can be as-
sumed that a highly perceived data security could lead to an 
increased usage of emails. However, the relation between this 
perception and the fixed usage of this service is quite stronger 
than the usage of this service in the mobile network. The cus-
tomer ratings for the security importance are quite similar. 
Besides a predicted influence of the perception of data secu-
rity for online shopping (fixed-line and mobile shopping) and 
the usage of online shopping, the authors find significantly 
positive correlations between the usage of online shopping 
and the perception of data security for the services emails 
(p<0.05, Pearson-value = 0.142) and online banking (p<0.05, 
Pearson-value = 0.144) (see Table VI). It can be assumed that 
a higher perception of data security concerning the safety of 
online banking and the email accounts could lead to a 
stronger usage of online shopping. Despite the low correla-
tion coefficients (based on [69][70]), it can be noted that both 
services could be used if a customer decides to use online 
shopping platforms. Finally, especially in the usage of mobile 
Internet services the authors also find significantly negative 
correlations of social media (SM) and instant messaging (IM) 
with the data security perceptions of e-learning (SM: p<0.05, 
Pearson-value = -0.158; IM: p<0.05, Pearson-value = -0.113) 
and online gaming (SM: p<0.05, Pearson-value = -0.185; IM: 
p<0.05, Pearson-value = -0.153) (see Table VII). Here, it 
must be predicted that the usage of IM and SM would in-
crease if the users perceive a decreasing data security in 
online gaming and e-learning. From the current point of view, 
a coherent argumentation cannot be included. At this point, 
the authors will consider this relation in the regression analy-
sis in detail. 
Additionally, the authors also analyze the correlation be-
tween the password changing behavior and the usage of the 
services. For the mobile and fixed services, the password 
changing behaviors correlate positively significant (p<0.05) 
with usage of Social Media. The correlation coefficients are 
spread around the value of 0.100 which mean quite weak cor-
relations [69][70]. The prediction would be that people, 
which are changing their passwords more regularly, use So-
cial Media more often.

D. 
Regression Analyses 
The regression analysis follows the same procedure as the 
correlation analysis. Firstly, the authors consider how the im-
portance and perception of data security of the specific Inter-
net services (independent variables) affect the general per-
ception of data security (dependent variable). Following the 
application of the least square regression, there is a positively 
significant regression (p<0.05) between the general percep-
tion of data security and the evaluation of the data security of 
email services. Due to a regression coefficient value of 0.299, 
a higher explanatory rate is reached, which results in a good 
linear regression (see Table VIII). However, the r-square, 
which indicates the explanatory rate of the regression, is only 
8.2% in this case (see Table VIII).  
This value is below the targeted 10% to 20% as found in 
literature [67], the explanatory power of this regressive con-
nection is quite weak. The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), 
which illustrates the rate of multicollinearities, should be be-
low the mark of 3 [64][71][72]. The VIF for this regression 
is 2.579, which leads to the exclusion of multicollinearities in 
this case.  
The same significantly positively regression (p<0.05) can 
be found between the general data security perception and the 
importance of data security for email services. Both tests con-
clude that a better perceived data security for email services 
lead to a better estimation of the data security at all. These 
results are supported by the significant (p<0.05) regressive 
connection between the perception of the general data secu-
rity and the perceived data security of Social Media services. 
However, the regression coefficient is negative (-0.278) and 
multicollinearities can be excluded (VIF<3). Nonetheless, the 
finding that the general perception of data security rises in the 
case that the perceived data security of the Social Media Ac-
counts decreases, does not lead to a useful relationship be-
tween these factors and will not further considered. Consid-
ering that the other tests between the named variables also do 
not lead to significant connections, the authors have to con-
clude that the perception of data security mostly belongs to 
the email security. Consequently, the hypothesis H1 can be 
accepted for the connection with email services only. In gen-
eral, hypothesis H1 has to be rejected.  
The assessment of the interrelation between the password 
changing behavior, data security and usage of services is not 
the main target of the authors’ analysis, but it would be useful 
to collect some more information which can be used for fur-
ther surveys and evaluations. Interestingly, the password 
changing behavior does not significantly lead to a higher per-
ceived data security (p>0.05). Therefore, hypothesis H5 can 
also be rejected.  
This connection implies that the perceived data security 
bases on different influence factors. Furthermore, the pass-
word changing behavior also relies on different customer es-
timations.  
The password changing behavior for emails significantly 
positive (p<0.05) affects the perceived importance of data se-
curity of email services. The reached r-square of 3.0% pre-
sents a very weak linear regressive connection between these 
factors. The regression coefficient with 0.174 is also quite 
weak. Following Petter et al., the reached VIF value of 1 in-
fers an exclusion of multicollinearities [72]. By changing 
passwords for the email services more regularly, an increased 
perception of data security could be achieved.  
The password changing behavior for social media net-
works significantly positively (p<0.05) affects the perceived 
importance of data security of social media services. The 
reached r-square of 2.2% and the regression coefficient of 
0.149 illustrates a very weak linear regressive connection be-
tween these factors. Following Petter et al., the reached VIF 
value of 1 infers an exclusion of multicollinearities [72]. By 
changing passwords for the social media network services 
more regularly, an increased perception of data security can 
be reached. A further connection can be found in the positive 
significant regression of the password changing behavior for 
Social Media accounts with downloads (p<0.05, r-square 
0.125, regression coefficient 0.253). Due to the huge volume 
of information distributed in the social networks, the custom-
ers are able to download a lot of materials. This means, if 
users take care about their personal Social Media accounts, 
they also use downloads. Nonetheless, the other tests do not

lead to significant results and therefore the hypothesis H4 has 
tu be rejected. 
In the comparison of password changing behavior for 
emails and usage of Internet services, the password changing 
behavior significantly is affected by the usage of online te-
lephony (fixed, mobile) and video on demand (mobile) in a 
positive way (fixed-line: r-square=12.1%, p<0.05, VIF close 
to 1; mobile: r-square=15.7%, p<0.05, VIF close to 1) (see 
Table IX). Both considerations are significant and display ac-
ceptable explanatory rates. Based on the VIF values close to 
1, multicollinearities can be excluded. The more the custom-
ers use these both services, more often they change their pass-
words. Additionally, instant messaging in the mobile Internet 
usage affects negatively significantly (mobile) the changing 
behavior for email passwords. Here, the more the customers 
change their passwords the weaker they will use instant mes-
saging in the mobile consideration (see Table IX). However, 
there is no reason why there is no connection to the services 
email or social media.  
To test the hypothesis H6, the previous findings have to be 
analyzed from another perspective, i. e. the authors evaluate 
the dependence of each single service usage on the password 
changing behavior of customers (for emails and Social Media 
accounts). The hypothesis H6 has to be rejected. There are 
only three weak negatively significantly regressive relations 
between (a) the password changing behavior for emails and 
Social Media accounts and the mobile usage of IPTV 
(p<0.05, r-square 2.1%, coefficient -0.197), (b) online shop-
ping (p<0.05, r-square 1.1%, coefficient -0.162) and (c) video 
telephony (p<0.05, r-square 1.7%, coefficient -0.161). Based 
on the low regression coefficients (below 0.500) and the 
weak values for r-square below the mark of 10%, the regres-
sive connections are quite weak and cannot lead to an agree-
ment of the hypothesis [69][70]. Following Petter et al., the 
reached VIF-values below of 3 indicate an exclusion of the 
multicollinearities [72]. Especially, the authors could not find 
any connection between the consideration of the password 
changing behaviors and the usage of fixed Internet services.    
The consideration of the connection between Internet ser-
vices usage and perception of data security and importance of 
data security will be divided in a fixed and mobile perspec-
tive. Table X illustrates how each single service usage in the 
fixed-line infrastructure is affected by the perceptions of data 
security and data security importance (Dependent variable = 
specific usage of the respective Internet services; Independ-
ent variable = perception of data security and data security 
importance of the specific service). The consideration indi-
cates that the usage of Internet services with fixed-line infra-
structures is not significantly influenced by the general cus-
tomer perception of data security. However, for different In-
ternet services the authors can find significantly positive re-
gressions between the perception of data security importance 
of the single services and the usage of services.  
As Table X illustrates, the usage of email services, online 
telephony and online shopping is significantly positively 
(p<0.05) influenced by the perception of data security im-
portance for email services. Therefore, the customers intend 
to use email services, online telephony and online shopping 
if they perceive the email services to be secure and indicate a 
high data security importance. The connection between the 
usage and perception of data security importance for email 
services appears naturally. Also, the usage of online teleph-
ony and online shopping normally needs an account, which 
is generally linked to an email account. Following Schöneck 
and Voß, and Brosius, the r-squares between 8.7% and 10.8% 
and the regressions coefficients of 0.096 to 0.114 indicate 
quite weak significant regressions [67][70].

Therefore, the linear connection between the usage of 
these services and the estimation of the data security im-
portance of email services can be assessed as quite weak. The 
VIF values below the mark of 3 exclude possible multicollin-
earities between the analyzed variables [64][71][72]. How-
ever, the open question is, why the perception of data security 
importance for emails services just affects the usage of these 
three named components and does not impact other Internet 
service usages.  
The other two connections in the usage of Internet services 
in fixed-line infrastructures can be found in (a) the signifi-
cantly positive influence (p<0.05) of the importance of data 
security on cloud computing on the usage of video on de-
mand, and (b) the significantly positive dependence (p<0.05) 
of importance of data security on online banking and online 
administration on the usage of instant messaging. Due to r-
squares of 10.8% and 9.8% and regression coefficients below 
20%, the authors follow the estimated values for regression 
analyses by Schöneck and Voß and conclude quite weak re-
gressive connections between the analyzed variables [67]. 
Based on the VIF below the value of 3, multicollinearities can 
be ruled out [64][71][72].  
For case (a), the authors assume that people, who often 
consume videos on demand, also use clouds to save their vid-
eos, pictures and data, which they produce and consume. In 
the customers’ mind, the usage of video on demand is influ-
enced by the perception of data security importance for cloud 
computing. The only possibility to explain the circumstance 
would be that the customers need higher data security to con-
sume and produce more videos. In this case, more and more 
people, who consume videos on demand, will also produce 
more and more own videos.  
For case (b), no useful connection is evident. Generally, 
administration (e g. employment office) inform their custom-
ers with short messages services, which can be linked to the 
use of instant messages and so a relation to the usage of ser-
vices can be predicted. Here, it can be assumed that the cus-
tomers want a secure news exchange, because the infor-
mation of the administrations are normally personal. Due to 
the fact, the highest regression coefficient is 0.162, this pos-
sible relation should be analyzed by further research. The 
connection to online banking could be that banks often send 
authentication codes per short or instant messages. With the 
authentication codes, the customers are able to do their trans-
actions. Therefore, customers perceive a higher data security 
importance, because people are taking care that no other third 
party can enter this communication and can possibly copy 
critically personal information.  
Considering the usage of the Internet services in the mo-
bile infrastructure in Table XI, there is a significant influence 
(p<0.05) between perceived data security and the usage of 
navigation services. However, the regression coefficient of 
0.042 and a r-square of 10.0% indicate a quite weak linear 
regression (the coefficient value is close to 0 instead of close 
to 1) between these variables. Following Schöneck and Voß, 
the r-square for should be higher than 20% (at least 10%) 
[67]. Following Hagl, and Brosius, the linear regression be-
tween the variables is weak [69][70]. Based on a VIF value 
below 3, multicollinearities can be ruled out [72]. The authors 
assume that customers use navigation services. However, the 
most people do not want to be tracked. Therefore, a safer per-
ception of data security could induce higher usage rates. In 
contrast to the importance of emails in the fixed-line usage of 
Internet services, the mobile Internet services usage is domi-
nated by the application of instant messaging. For the ser-
vices, instant messaging, e-learning and social media, the 
data security importance of instant messaging significantly 
impacts (p<0.05) all three named factors. Based on regression 
coefficient factors, which are ranging between -0.154 (E-
Learning negatively) and 0.101 (social media positively), the 
linear regression values are also quite weak. The r-squares 
reach values between 10.0% and 18.9%, which also do not 
imply good regressive interrelations. Following Petter et al., 
11
International Journal on Advances in Internet Technology, vol 10 no 1 & 2, year 2017, http://www.iariajournals.org/internet_technology/
2017, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org

the VIF values below 3 leads to an exclusion of multicolline-
arities [72]. The relation between the perception of data secu-
rity importance and usage of instant messaging is obvious. As 
mentioned in literature, the perception of the security of one 
service should influence the usage of this service. So, this 
connection should follow the natural order. Also, the connec-
tion between social media and the perception of data security 
importance can be deduced by the issue that the most people 
communicate with instant messaging through social media 
platforms. Mostly, people demand that their messages are be-
ing transferred securely and without interruptions or eaves-
dropping by a third party. The interrelation with e-learning 
cannot be explained at this point and needs further research.  
The other two connections concerning the usage of Inter-
net services in mobile infrastructures can be found in (a) the 
significantly negative influence (p<0.05) of the importance 
of data security for email services on the usage of online te-
lephony, and (b) the significantly positive dependence 
(p<0.05) of importance of data security for online gaming on 
the usage of video on demand. Due to r-squares of 10.2% and 
8.6% and regression coefficients below 20%, the authors fol-
low the estimated values for regression analyses by Schöneck 
and Voß and conclude quite weak regressive relations be-
tween the analyzed variables [67]. Based on the VIF below 
the value of 3, multicollinearities can be ruled out 
[64][71][72]. Both cases cannot be explained from the current 
point of view. Normally, a positive relation between online 
telephony and the importance of data security for email ser-
vices exists (like in the fixed-line consideration) but, the neg-
ative interrelation does not lead to a useful explanation in the 
current moment. A similar argumentation could be performed 
for the connection of video demand usage and the importance 
of data security for online gaming services. The authors can-
not identify a meaningful influence of this perception on the 
usage of video on demand. Therefore, this result will not be 
considered in this paper. The above mentioned possible neg-
ative relations between IM and SM and e-learning and online 
gaming cannot be supported. Therefore, it can be concluded 
that the above-mentioned correlations depend on third un-
known factors.  
Consequently, the authors only find few regressive rela-
tionships between perceived data security, perceived im-
portance of data security and the usage of Internet services. 
In the whole consideration, the authors have to reject the hy-
potheses H2 and H3. 
V. 
DISCUSSION 
The analysis within this paper considers how the test per-
sons evaluate the importance of data security. 
As mentioned above, nearly 70% of the interviewed per-
sons have indicated that they do change their password less 
than once a year. It can be expected that they more or less 
never change their primary passwords.  
From this point of view, the authors conclude: (1) the most 
people are not aware of the importance of data security and 
the safety of their personal data or they do not care about the 
possible risks, or (2) they do not understand the relation be-
tween the password changing behavior and the data security. 
The authors assume that the people (a) do not care about, (b) 
are not aware of the consequences, or (c) are too lazy to take 
care about these issues.     
The majority of nearly 85% uses anti-virus programs to 
protect their devices. However, in the most cases (round 
about 70%) people are not willing to pay money for security 
of their devices. However, the people do not take care about 
that normally the free version of an anti-virus program has a 
smaller program scope and possibly some necessary elements 
for the protection of the devices are not implemented.    
This paper examines the influence of the perception and 
importance of data security regarding the usage of Internet 
services, especially mobile Internet services.  
The presented findings in the previous chapter indicate that 
a general interrelation between the perception of data secu-
rity, data security importance and the usage of Internet ser-
vices cannot be found. However, in the consideration of sin-
gle services and their perception and importance of data se-
curities, some positive and negative regressions could be 
found. But often the natural service data perception does not 
fit with the usage of the service (see Tables IV and V). The 
missing connections support the absence of direct relation-
ships between the analyzed variables. Therefore, the authors 
have to reject all hypotheses in general.  
Though, the particular single relations between the usage 
and the perception/importance of data security of the specific 
services could induce that a possible relation between these 
variables exist. The data security of email services seems to 
be the most important factor for customers. Since the overall 
data security of the customers is essentially influenced by 
their assessment of the data security of emails as well as the 
significance of this data security. These lead to the conclusion 
that if customers feel a higher email security they will use 
more Internet services (independent of the infrastructure). 
This relation is supported by the fact that people on a fixed-
line connection often communicate via emails. In contrast to 
the fixed-line usage, mobile instant messaging takes the same 
position as the explained email services importance for the 
fixed-line infrastructures. Based on the fact that a lot of peo-
ple use instant messengers like WhatsApp, Facebook Mes-
senger, Line and others per mobile phone, obviously the ser-
vices with highest importance also gain the highest data se-
curity importance. Other possible variables and services can 
also have an influence but further research would be needed. 
 Hence, the authors do not reject the hypotheses com-
pletely. It can be noted that the perceived data security for 
emails significantly influences the general perception of data 
security. However, the previous findings indicate that further 
research is necessary. The comparison of fixed with mobile 
Internet usage in connection with estimation of data security 
does not yield useful results.

Therefore, no significant differences in the usage or in the 
perception of data security can be found. The authors do not 
find a significant connection between the perception of data 
security in general and in particular (regarding the specific 
services).  The presented literature, which discloses different 
significant connections between the perceived trust/per-
ceived risk and the behavioral intention to use mobile pay-
ments and mobile banking, show significantly better results. 
In comparison to these findings, the authors aim to explain 
how the discrepancy between the own and external results 
can be comprehended. One possible difference in the results 
bases on the importance of data security. The different ques-
tions for data security importance possibly inhibit the signif-
icance of the perception of data security. The results for the 
perceived security could be therefore affected and over-
whelmed by the concept of data security importance. Sec-
ondly, the TAM and UTAUT2 normally use the external var-
iables as impact factors for the behavioral intention to use 
[12][13][14]. The adaptation of the model with a direct influ-
ence of perceived security and user behavior can possibly 
lead to the discrepancies. It must be considered that this rela-
tion possibly does not exist. Furthermore, the authors did not 
include questions to prove the other concepts of the TAM and 
the UTAUT2 in the questionnaire, which would possibly be 
able to support the findings of the data security analysis.  
Thirdly, the combined consideration of the influence on 
multiple mobile services, which all have different conditions 
and customer evaluations in direction of data security, user-
friendliness and technical requirements poses the problems of 
potentially not being able to examine all factors in one anal-
ysis.

The fourth issue could be that the test persons, who are 
mainly between 20 and 29 years old, are very affine in the 
usage of mobile services and possibly do not take care very 
much for data security. Due to their affinity, the people use 
the services and increase their experience. In connection to 
the explanations in the literature review, an increased experi-
ence can lead to a higher behavioral intention. Furthermore, 
the overrepresentation of this age group also influences sig-
nificantly the whole results of the survey. If other age groups 
would have nearly the same proportion on test persons, the 
results could be quite different. 
Furthermore, more experience will diminish possible un-
certainties and risk with usage of the different mobile ser-
vices. The last issue could be found in the questions of the 
survey, because some of the questions are not suitable to gen-
erate the desired information concerning the presented con-
cepts.

Therefore, the authors have decided to collect all these 
open issues to improve the own research and to carry out an-
other survey. The shortly explained open issues and different 
possible improvements for a second survey will be presented 
in the following section.    
 
VI. 
IMPROVEMENTS AND FURTHER APPROACH 
Generally, the presented results cannot fully describe the 
influence of data security issues on the usage of specific In-
ternet services. However, the results enable finding a general 
perception of data security on the usage of specific Internet 
services. Nevertheless, the perception of data security respec-
tive of single services has shown that an influence of data se-
curity issues on the usage of specific Internet services can be 
comprehended.  
However, the first survey has to be seen as a pre-test as 
some questions do not lead to the aimed findings and cannot 
illustrate possible relationships. To reach better results for the 
examination of the named concepts, the authors will do a sec-
ond survey. The second questionnaire will include some im-
provements to get closer to the perception of perceived cred-
ibility, perceived security, initial trust and firms’ reputation. 
Especially the firms’ reputation will be important, because 
researches found out that reputation increases trust in mobile 
banking [40][44][73][74]. This relation may also fit in the 
consideration of the usage of other services. These implica-
tions can be used for the estimations of the relation between 
trust and the usage of mobile Internet services.  
Based on the findings that (a) the perceived credibility and 
(b) the initial trust will play a major role if customers decide 
to use a system or service, the authors will include these two 
components in the consisting model. In consideration of the 
presented problem, perceived credibility will cover the ques-
tions how the customers estimate and perceive reliability of 
the fixed and mobile Internet network, services and content 
providers.  
Figure 2. Conceptual Model for the Second Survey 
 
 
 As mentioned above, perceived credibility covers (a) the 
users’ beliefs that the used systems would be free of threats 
for privacy and security and (b) their according attitudes, 
which is known to positively influence the behavioral inten-
tion to use the systems [17][20]. The authors relate to the per-
ceived credibility with the initial trust, as known through the 
literature.  
Based on this relationship, initial trust indicates how the 
customers feel their data safe by the providers based on the 
estimation of the questions to perceived credibility. To sup-
port these findings, the concepts of perceived data security 
and perceived importance of data security will be related with 
initial trust too. On the base of the literature, the authors adapt 
the previous model in the way that they relate initial trust di-
rectly to the use behavior of an Internet services, instead of 
the behavioral intention to use.     
Besides the analysis of the relationships in the TAM, the 
improvements are necessary to closer analyze the issues of 
data security and trust from the perspective of the UTAUT2. 
The questions need to be tailored to the findings of perceived 
credibility which shall support the previous findings of per-
ceived security. This approach is needed to prioritize the fo-
cus on the consumer perspective instead of an organizational 
perspective. Nevertheless, the main focus of this work is to 
examine the influence of data security in general and in rela-
tion to the single services. Here, the authors examine the user 
perception of data security regarding single Internet services. 
This approach also enables the analysis of the difference be-
tween the general and single service perception of data secu-
rity.   
Therefore, the other concepts like perceived ease of use, 
performance expectancy, social influence, habit, effort ex-
pectancy, trust propensity, and structural assurance are not 
considered in detail [12][13][14]. As described above, the fo-
cus of the research and the analysis is on the concepts of per-
ceived credibility, perceived security, initial trust and firms’ 
reputation.

This approach could possibly lead to reduced results and 
information from the second survey, due to the issue that the 
authors do not include the other used concepts from the 
UTAUT2 and the TAM. But the authors try to focus on the 
assessment of the single influence of data security (regarding 
trust and credibility) on the customer usage of Internet ser-
vices.  
The authors are aware of the fact that this approach might 
not lead to the aimed results, due to the small number of con-
sidered concepts and the non-observance of moderators.   
In contrast to the first survey, the second survey includes 
the frequency of Internet services usage. Here, the authors 
share the opinion that this approach gives a better overview 
of the usage of services and possibly how data security issues 
impact the frequency of usage.  
In order to cover the perceived credibility about the used 
system, in this paper the fixed and mobile telecommunication 
networks, the second survey includes questions about how 
the customers perceive the security of the infrastructure and 
how the network operators use the gained data from the cus-
tomer. These questions should also cover how the customers 
perceive that the infrastructure is free of risks. Furthermore, 
the customer estimation of the network operators enables a 
possible assessment of enterprises’ trustworthiness and ad-
here the accepted rules from customer perspective [75]. Con-
sequently, the authors are testing the concepts from TAM and 
UTAUT2 in combined questions.  
Finally, the difference to the previous study will be under-
lined by the analysis of other impact factors like culture val-
ues and traditions. The general idea of this paper should be to 
examine a relationship between the perception of data secu-
rity and usage of Internet services, especially of mobile Inter-
net services.
