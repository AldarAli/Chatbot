Abstract—Creating
sustainable
multi-disciplinary
knowledge
resources and enabling advanced features for processing of
associations is one of the major goals of long-term knowledge
development and discovery. This paper presents the main results
from the development of resources allowing the use of advanced
association processing and computation facilities. With the
support from such resources, the paper also presents respective
association processing results on exploiting the geoscientiﬁc and
archaeological knowledge resources components. The practical
application scenario is based on content from a natural sciences
and archaeology research and studies campaign at the ancient city
of Kameiros, Greece. The created resources are providing content,
structures, and features for exploiting computation facilities,
especially a multitude of reference types. The focus is to support
knowledge resources with a set of features, which allow to extend
and exploit long-term content discovery and gain new insights.

INTRODUCTION
This paper presents the research conducted for creating
knowledge resources and developing application components
for supporting and providing advanced integrated systems
for geoscientiﬁc, multi-disciplinary, and multi-lingual appli-
cation scenarios. Existing data collections, unstructured and
structured, combine a number of insufﬁcient features and
drawbacks, missing long-term aspects, support for multi-
disciplinary conceptual knowledge, for classiﬁcation, and for
advanced and fuzzy methods like associations.
The purpose of the developed resources and components
is to provide advanced knowledge object features, especially
association processing features and computation in context
with long-term multi-disciplinary and multi-lingual knowledge
documentation and discovery. The new resources and appli-
cation developments presented here are based on selected
frameworks and resources, which have been created over the
last two decades. The knowledge resources and Collaboration
house framework [1] allowed for the implementation of multi-
disciplinary, long-term knowledge resources and application
components, for dynamical use as well as for complex and
high end computation. The resulting components are used for
universal and consistent documentation of knowledge and sci-
entiﬁc research, and for consequent long-term purposes. These
components are created using a universal classiﬁcation [2],
a ﬂexible and portable all-purpose programming environment
[3], and appropriate international standards [4].
In this case, for advanced association processing, new work-
ﬂows had to be created and dynamically integrated into the
framework components. Such implementation is possible if on
the one hand the components’ workﬂows allow a ﬂexible inte-
gration of workﬂows, e.g., via scripting and compiled sources
and on the other hand that structured knowledge resources can
be extended for allowing a multitude of references types. The
combination allows to create associations by making use of the
available structures, processing, and computation facilities. For
these purposes the object and media knowledge resources and
the framework components were basically extended to support
a data-centric approach.
This paper is organised as follows. Section II presents the
state of the resources and frameworks. Sections III and IV
introduce the new integration of workﬂows and reference types
of the knowledge resources. Sections V and VI discuss the
creation and processing of associations and how computational
facilities can be exploited. Sections VII presents a geosciences
and archaeology case study and implementation. Sections VIII
and IX give an evaluation, present the main results and
summarise the lessons learned, conclusions and future work.
II.
STATE OF RESOURCES AND FRAMEWORKS
The resources and implementations are based on three major
components: An architecture framework, long-term, multi-
disciplinary knowledge resources, and a mostly widely used
universal classiﬁcation framework. The architecture imple-
mented for an economical long-term strategy is data-centric
and based on development blocks. Figure 1 shows the three
main columns: Application resources, knowledge resources,
and originary resources. The central block in the “Collabora-
tion house” framework architecture [5], is represented by the
knowledge resources, scientiﬁc resources, object collections,
containers, databases, and documentation (e.g., LX [6], collec-
tions, containers). These resources provide multi-disciplinary
content, context, and references, including structured and un-
structured data, factual and conceptual knowledge.
The resources also refer to originary resources and sources
(e.g., textual data, media data, photos, scientiﬁc data, lit-
erature). The knowledge resources are used as a universal
component for compute and storage workﬂows. This feature
can also be applied for supporting dynamical and ontology-
based multi-agent, e.g., for production management as with

the implementation supported by the European Framework
Programme 7 (FP7) [7]. Application resources and compo-
nents (Active Source, Active Map, local applications) are
implementations for analysing, utilising, and processing data
and making the information and knowledge accessible. The

the classiﬁcation references based on the LX resources and
UDC, especially mentioning the well structured editions [2]
and the multi-lingual features [8], are essential means for
the processing workﬂows and evaluation of the knowledge
objects and containers. Both provide strong multi-disciplinary
and multi-lingual support.

The three blocks are supported by services’ interfaces. The
interfaces interact with the physical resources: In the local

allows to create any collaboration required for the development
and operation of knowledge resources, required services, and
High End Computing resources like compute and storage.
III.
INTEGRATION OF WORKFLOWS
The integration of association processing workﬂows with
the workﬂows for creating arbitrary result matrices is most
ﬂexible and efﬁcient and was based on the organisation and
object features (Figure 2) in the knowledge resources. Object
details and deﬁnitions have been discussed with computational
views [9]. The illustration shows that object information is
gathered from the objects and references in collections and
containers. Conﬁgurable algorithms like ﬁlters and mapping
are then used to compute a result matrix. The result matrix
is considered “intermediate” because any of such workﬂows
can be used in combination with other workﬂows, workﬂow
chains or further processing.
(a)
Geoscientiﬁc Association Processing Workﬂow Request:
A request for geoscientiﬁc knowledge resources is initi-
ated from within a discovery workﬂow. Such request is
created in level (2) within the architecture.
(b)
Geoscientiﬁc Knowledge Resources: The respective re-
sources are initialised for the workﬂow. The knowledge
resources are located in level (1).
(c)
Collections and containers: The collections and contain-
ers within the resources are provided.
(d)
Association Processing Algorithms and Deﬁnitions: The
algorithms and deﬁnitions for the association processing
are called. The processing involves (1), (2), and (3),
especially the last two.
(e)
Association Processing Intermediate Result Matrix: An
intermediate result matrix is created by the algorithms
and deﬁnitions. The matrix creation involves (1), (2),
and (3), especially (2).
(f)
Geoscientiﬁc Association Processing Workﬂow Reply:
Such reply is created in level (2) within the architecture.
Figure 3 illustrates selected knowledge resources’ objects,
focussing on references in collections and containers.
IV.
IMPLEMENTATION OF REFERENCE TYPES
Objects can carry any type of references. Objects can be
grouped, e.g., in collections or containers. When larger groups
are created then also these groups can carry their references.
These references may occur in any combination but in practice
these references will be a subset or a complementary set to the
objects’ references. Objects can be created by manual, auto-
mated, and hybrid means. Therefore, any type of references of
that kind may exist.
Tables I and II show excerpts of the references, which were
added to be used within the knowledge resources for two types
of object groups, namely collections and containers.

The reference types are organised in three major groups:
Object collections (O), object containers (C), and external or
externally created references (E).
This case study primarily addresses geoscientiﬁc and archae-
ological resources. The resources were extended for using a
multitude of references types of creating associations (Tables II
and I). Therefore, the resources especially contain georefer-
ences, UDC classiﬁcations for any object, including complex
conceptual knowledge, geoclassiﬁcation, concordances like
Universal Classiﬁed Classiﬁcation (UCC) [10], and Content
Factors in order to describe the content. Many reference
types are part of the objects. Nevertheless, in practice, the
organisation of references is more uniform within containers.
The reference types shown provide a lot of information
regarding content and context, which could otherwise not be
deducted from the object data itself. In addition, all reference
types may exist in multiple views, multiple languages, and
multiple context – any of which can be added in instances
created by manual, automatic, and hybrid means.
V.
CREATION OF ASSOCIATIONS AND PROCESSING MEANS
As far as the algorithms implemented in components carry
essential information for processing and computation, e.g., for
creating new results and output, they should be documented
with the knowledge resources themselves. As associations
can be created by arbitrary workﬂows, it is most important
to know, which components can carry which facilities and
how to exploit, e.g., in a multi-disciplinary context like geo-
sciences and archaeology. Geocoordinates’ data can be part
of any knowledge objects, containers, container objects, and
references (e.g., knowledge resources’ references or Google
Maps references). Conceptual knowledge data can be part of
knowledge objects, containers and container objects, but it can
also be contained in unstructured data, mostly used with auto-
mated processes with lower quality results. Associations can
especially result from any constellation of content and context
in object collections and containers, as well as from in-text
references (e.g., comparisons, see), and external sources. Sup-
porting methodologies and technologies, which were exploited
for the creation and processing of associations are, e.g., string
comparisons, transliterations, phonetics, statistics, metadata,
Content Factor, object elements rhythm, and dynamical data.
Associations were used for developing knowledge resources,
optimising result matrices, e.g., within knowledge discovery
workﬂows, creating concordances, creating references, improv-
ing knowledge objects and resources, gaining new knowl-
edge. The combination allows various degrees of precision
and fuzzyness as required for spanning multi-disciplinary and
multi-lingual data. An optimisation can improve the quality
of data, especially the quality of associations introduced for
automated classiﬁcation of unstructured data.
VI.
EXPLOITATION OF COMPUTATION FACILITIES
Within the layers, there are three kinds of facilities, which
are targets to be exploited by computation.

First block: Knowledge resources.
◦
Purpose: Data.
◦
Implementation: Editing components, versioning
tools, and high end text editors are used to-
gether with automation tools and scripting. The
knowledge resources themselves are based on fully
portable structures and markup.
(2)
Second block: Services and interfaces.
◦
Purpose: Workﬂows.
◦
Implementation: Perl, Tcl, and C are used for an
implementation.
(3)
Third block: Processing.
◦
Purpose: Individual and parallelised processes and
tasks as well as dynamical and interactive pro-
cesses.
◦
Implementation: Here, Portable Batch System
(PBS), Torque, and Moab are used, formerly also
IBM LoadLeveler and Condor. As far as required
for a certain scenario also dynamical or interactive
jobs can be executed.
The exploitation of computation facilities is mostly based
on these three featured component groups and the described
implementation. This realises the purposes of extracting data
and information, utilising workﬂow scripts, and submitting
dynamical and batch jobs.
VII.
GEOSCIENCES AND ARCHAEOLOGY CASE STUDY
The implementation has been done according to the de-
scribed architecture and enabling the required association
processing workﬂows based on the available components.
Therefore, the major implementation tasks concentrated on
the content related facilities, especially the geoscientiﬁc and
archaeological knowledge resources, and the application com-
ponents. The respective features were created in the knowledge
resources’ objects, which were under continuous development
over the last decades in the LX knowledge resources. The
application components have been extended and conﬁgured
to work with the required application scenario. This includes
the dynamical components from the Geo Exploration and
Information (GEXI) project, e.g., the actmap components,
based on Perl and Tcl scripting, C and Fortran.
The implementation for the case study was integrated with
the the base for this case study, the long-term knowledge
resources (LX Foundation Scientiﬁc Resources), which were
developed and used over several decades, including geoscien-
tiﬁc and archaeological objects and containers. A case study
example based on the created resources is presented with the
following workﬂow.
A. Volcano and Rhodos association discovery workﬂow

ations and links between “Vesuvius” and “Rhodos”.

priate compute instructions. Steps 6) to 8) handle the sorting,
formatting, and the selection of the intermediate result matrix.
Steps 9) and 10) generate a ﬁrst level association and after that

generate the common objects for levels 1 and 2.

The association processing “Vesuvius – Rhodos” revealed the
reference to Vesuvius / (via Kameiros-associated citations)
Pozzuoli / pozzolan. The excerpt also delivers a number of
associated references on ancient concrete technology [11],
cementitious materials [12], history of concrete [13], and evo-
lution of concrete [14]. Looking for secondary documentation
on eruptions being associated with Pozzuoli, e.g., the 1631
eruption of Vesuvius, delivers bibliographic sources like [15],
which provides a lot of unique context information from an
original source. This means there are several associations
linking Vesuvius with Rhodos and one link is a technology,
based on material from geoscientiﬁc context, documented in

If we extend the discovery and integrate chronological and
associated objects and locations from the resources then the
result matrix also includes years with volcanic, geological,
geophysical, and technological context. The listing in Fig-
ure 10 shows a representation of additional result matrix entries
associated for this case when these attributes were integrated.

Figure 10. Additional result matrix entries for intermediate result matrix
associated with integrated resources (excerpt).
The result is a very rich matrix. With its elements, the matrix
links different content and context from hundreds of objects
and sources. The listing depicts the content of the result
matrix in a readable formatting and excerpts some elements.
The matrix also contains references to the source data within
the knowledge resources and also refers to many other data,
e.g., terms, names, locations, georeferences, bibliographic data,
citations, classiﬁcation, and media data.
D. The Kameiros’ media references results
The following photo data (Figure 11) from the media
references for “Kameiros” was delivered by the result matrix.
Figure 11. Media photo objects associated with the knowledge object
“Kameiros”, referring to pozzolane and Vesuvius (LX resources, excerpt).
The photos have been taken in 2013 by the Knowledge in
Motion (KiM) natural sciences and archaeology sections in the
ancient city of Kameiros on Rhodos, Greece, during the GEXI
Eastern Mediterranean research and studies campaign. Today,
the location on the western coast of the island of Rhodes is
named Kam´ıros.
The data shows the ‘pozzolan’ cement material, the water
tank, and the water pipelines – the objects providing the
missing link. These references from ancient Kameiros are also
associated with Vesuvius volcano and refer to the later Roman
adoption of comparable cement ‘pozzolan’ technology. Contin-
uation of the case study [16] has conceived the documentation
available and planning the additional research and development
and the data to be collected and added to the knowledge
resources.
VIII.
EVALUATION
The structure and the aggregation of references increases
the ﬂexibility of possible workﬂows. Increasing the quality of
data in the described type of long-term knowledge resources
– by including references – can increase the quality of result
matrices from discovery processes.
The examined case showed that a technology and material,
which have not been explicitely documented in context of a
knowledge resources object, can be associated with the context
of different objects. Here, the Greek origin of the “pozzolan”
technology was associated, which was named after the later
use in Roman times.
Association processing can support discovery processes even
when references are not explicitely available in text and doc-
umentation, and would therefore be unexpected or unknown.
Association processing can use multi-level discovery in order
to gain additional information, which is not visible from an
otherwise isolated documentation.
The developed structures and methods can be widely bene-
ﬁcial for knowledge development and discovery as well as for

creating implementations for advanced discovery components.
The methodology allows to extend and exploit long-term multi-
disciplinary content documentation and discovery and gain
new insights from otherwise not associated data.

CONCLUSION
This paper presented the research on advanced features
for processing of associations and some major results from
the resources side and from the case study on geosciences
and archaeology. First, the research showed that structured
knowledge resources can be successfully extended for allowing
a multitude of integrated references types, e.g., geoclassiﬁca-
tion and media. Second, the implementation showed that new
workﬂows, e.g., association workﬂows can be integrated very
ﬂexibly and efﬁciently.
The elements from associations contained in the result
matrix are not procurable when using only plain methods
like simple string search or plain discovery. Furthermore,
the integration of methods, e.g., association, classiﬁcation,
and phonetic algorithms, allows any degree of precision and
fuzziness. From the structural and knowledge point of view,
the extended features are least invasive to the described type
of knowledge resources and procedures.
From the geoscientiﬁc and archaeological side the factual
results are most notable because the methodology integrates
multi-disciplinary and multi-lingual knowledge beyond con-
ventional means and shows a large number of associations,
which cross multiple disciplines and languages. The ﬂexibil-
ity of the knowledge processing beneﬁts from the advanced
organisation of the data, which enables various scalable com-
putational means for implementing directed graphs to fuzzy
links, for which High End Computing resources can be de-
ployed. Future work will be focussed on further developing the
multi-disciplinary knowledge resources and creating advanced
methods for describing the content and context of objects. The
new method should carry facilities for supporting long-term
knowledge development and analysis as well as for enabling
automation and high end computing.
