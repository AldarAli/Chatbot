Abstract—Electronic Commerce (e-commerce) websites need
to provide customers with a positive User Experience
(UX) to be successful and competitive. In this paper, it is
presented a set of 64 heuristics as a tool to evaluate the
grade of UX achievement of these kinds of sites. The set
is based  on  three  studies  which  provide  functional
requirements and guidelines in regard to the quality of e-
commerce web sites. The main contribution of this work
is  the  standardization  of  these  recommendations  by
formulating them in interrogative sentences to facilitate
the  evaluation  of  e-commerce  sites.  Each  heuristic  is
accompanied by examples and suggestions that facilitate
their evaluation by a provided scoring system.
Keywords-Heuristic  evaluation;  E-commerce;  User
Experience.
I.
 INTRODUCTION
Business-To-Consumer  (B2C)  websites  are  complex
interactive systems whose primary goal is to draw a visitor
into completing an online purchase. It is well know that User
eXperience  (UX)  is  one  of  the  most  critical  factors  for
Electronic Commerce (e-commerce) success and as such, it
has become a competitive requirement.  The standard ISO
DIS  9241-210:2008  [7]  gives  one  of  the  most  popular
definitions, it says that UX is: “A person's perceptions and
responses that result from the use and/or anticipated use of a
product, system or service”. Morville [14] has contributed in
the field of UX providing seven well-known facets, these are:
useful, usable, findable, valuable, desirable, accessible and
credible.
However, it seems that UX is not as implemented in e-
commerce  sites  as  it  should  be.  According  to  Baymard
Institute [1], the average shopping cart abandonment rate
from 18 different studies is 67%. Therefore, enhancing the
UX is required in B2C sites as this in turn contributes to an
increase in the number of orders. The first step to improve the
UX  in  existing  and  new  e-commerce  websites  is  their
evaluation.
One of the most used evaluation inspection methods is
the Heuristic Evaluation (HE). It can be applied during the
development process of interactive systems or used on real
operational systems. The HE is an effective method to review
interfaces by taking the recommendations based on User
Centered Design rules and contrasting them with the website.
These recommendations come in different guises, such as
design principles, heuristics, guidelines, best practices or
user interface design patterns and standards [10] that are
supposed  to  serve  interface  designers  and  evaluators.
Despite this, only heuristics are usually orientated as an
evaluation more than a design tool. This is because they are
often written in interrogative sentences instead of being
written in declarative sentences. An study presented by
Masip et al. [11] reveal that evaluators prefer interrogative
sentences because they are more intuitive.
Another difficulty of HE is that it is necessary to adapt
the heuristic set to the specific features of each interactive
system.  Thus,  evaluators  have  to  combine  different
recommendations sources in order to review the specific
application domain. This involves a long reviewing process
as guideline collections inevitably induce conﬂict between
various resources. Guidelines conflicts are caused by the
different characteristics of each set of recommendations.
For  instance,  level  of  detail,  format,  scope,  language,
classification of the principles, updating, level of validity
and  quality  and  development  phase  for  use  [16].  In
addition, each set uses different scoring systems to score the
recommendations, so it is necessary to adjust  it in the
resultant set.
The  process  of  combining  different  heuristic  sets
usually  finishes  up  with  a  long  list  of  duplicated
recommendations, similar statements using different terms
and  potentially  conflicting  guidelines.  A  clean-up  and
selection process is then required to provide a reliable,
consistent and easy to use heuristic set [9]. Furthermore, the
majority  of  the  recommendation  sets  are  written  in
declarative sentences. The evaluators can keep to this way
of writing, as it eases the adaptation process of the heuristic
set, but then the implementation of the evaluation process
will be a far more complicated task.
For e-commerce websites the adaptation of the heuristic
set is especially challenging. It is possible to use universal
usability principles, such as Nielsen's [15], but they do not
cover all the aspects involved in B2C sites. Additional
heuristics  appear  to  be  needed  to  support  e-commerce
specific components and functionalities, such as shopping
cart, customer service, checkout and registration process,
category and  product  pages.  Moreover,  there  are  some
factors that are especially important for the customer, such
as trustworthiness, safety and privacy.
Some  specific  e-commerce  user  interface
recommendations are available; for example, the Bauer's
guidelines for Product Pages [2] or the  Guidelines of E-

Commerce Checkout Design presented by Holst [6]. As of
the  two  previous  examples,  most  of  the  sets  of
recommendations found for e-commerce websites are partial,
presenting principles only for some aspects of B2C websites,
such as shopping cart, product pages, checkout process, etc.
In addition, any recommendations written in interrogative
sentences have been found in this field.
For all the reasons above, it is proposed to pull all the e-
commerce  principles  from  the  literature  together  and
standardize them into interrogative sentences to be ready for
evaluators to use.  A scoring system is also suggested to ease
the reviews and overall scoring of B2C sites. The resultant
heuristic set will prevent the problems that arise from the
combination of the recommendations taken from different
sources.  The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  begin  with  the
recommendations standardization by providing ”a first set of
heuristics“ to evaluate the UX in e-commerce websites.
This  paper  is  structured  as  follows:  first,  in  the
methodology section, the procedure to obtain the heuristic set
and the scoring system are explained. Then, in section 3, the
resultant set and its detailed organization and presentation are
shown.  Finally,  in  the  conclusion  section,  the  main
conclusions and the future work are shortly described.
II.
METHODOLOGY
The heuristic set introduced is based on the analysis of
three studies, these studies present guidelines or functional
requirements for e-commerce websites. The selected studies
are Liang and Lai [8], Lightner [9] and Cao et al. [3]. They
were selected due to their similarity as their criterion is used
to test on-line bookstores. These studies do not cover all the
aspects of User Experience but as stated, this paper's aim is
just to begin the standardization.
The first thing to do to obtain the proposed heuristic set
was to deduce and recollect all the recommendations given
by  the  three  studies.  Then,  each  recommendation  was
rewritten  formulating  an  interrogative  sentence  and
providing examples or advice to facilitate their scoring. In
table I, an applied example is shown in order to clarify the
process followed to obtain the heuristics. In the first column
there are cited the three studies. In the second column there
are  quoted  the  author's  definitions  of  their  own
recommendations.  In  the  next  column  there  are  the
guidelines  about  security  extracted  from  the  studies.
Finally, in the last column, the resultant heuristics which
are  inspired  by the  three  authors'  recommendations  are
presented.

 “Functional requirements derived 
from the customer's perspective”  
“I trust the web site will not misuse my personal 
information”
Does the website show security logos? It should 
show them especially in the checkout process to 
build trust. The logos may be related to the 
shipment (FedEx, UPS, etc.), payment options 
(Visa, PayPal, etc..) or security, like SSL.
“The web site is secure”
“The web site is realiable”
Does the website inform of the level of security 
when paying by credit card? It should 
demonstrate that it is a safe website to buy from.
“I fell protected/safe when I use the site”

“Functional requirements that 
represent facets of customer 
service in a B2C site”
“Provide secure payment”
If personal information is required by the 
website, does it have the Privacy Policy 
available? It should include all possible uses of 
their personal information. The footer is the 
standard location to link this information. It has 
to be easily understandable by the customers.
“Inform customer of paymen security (Safe Shopping 
Guarantee)”
“Inform customer of privacy policy (For instance: Link
during checkout or help, Privacy icon link, etc.)”
Does the website has safety certificates granted 
by external companies? It is important to get 
them and let customers know about them. These 
are companies like VeriSign or ControlScan. It 
must use the secure SSL technology as well.

“A set of factors that capture the

“Claiming security of transactions: Since the seller 
and the buyer do not actually see each other in the 
virtual market, Internet security is a major concern. 
Therefore, adopting proper security mechanisms, such 
as secured electronic transactions, and making 
announcements may help.”
Following that, the heuristics were organized based on
the stages of customer's buying behavior described by Engel
et al. [5]. Consequently, as it is explained in the next section,
the heuristics are organized in the following six parts: Need
Recognition and Problem Awareness, Information Search,
Purchase decision making, Transaction, Post-sales Services
and it has been added a section to gather factors that affect
UX during the whole purchase process. This organization
intends  to  facilitate  the  evaluators'  understanding  of
customer behavior to enhance the HE results. If during the
reviewing of the interface the evaluators follow the stages
of the purchase decision process they will understand the
customer's needs and point of view.
Finally,  a scoring system  has been established as a
convenient  tool  to  assist  the  evaluators  in  conclusion
making by providing quantitative results of the HE. Each

heuristic was assigned either a “yes” or “no” answers or a 1
to 5 Likert scale. To obtain a global score for the evaluated
websites  the  affirmative  answers  get  5  points  and  the
negative answers get 1. For the other system, the evaluator
can grade the level of accomplishment between 1 to 5. The
scale is represented as: 1 strongly disagree, 2 disagree, 3
neither agree nor disagree, 4 agree and 5 strongly agree. The
first scoring system is assigned to the questions that either
have or do not have specific features or functionalities. The
Likert Scale system is attached to the heuristics that require a
ranged score as they depend on expert opinion. Eventually, it
is possible to combine scores together to obtain a total score
out  of  233  points.  This  eases  the  comparison  between
different websites, and is useful to estimate the level of UX
that a website has according to the heuristic set.
III.
RESULTS
In this section, a set of 64 heuristics ready to be rated by
experts is presented. The set is the result of  the compilation
and standardization of the recommendations from the three
selected studies.
A. Heuristics organisation
As it is pointed out  at  the Methodology section, the
heuristics are gathered in 6 groups according to the stages of
the Buying Decision Process described by Engel et al. [5].
1)
Need Recognition and Problem Awareness (Table II):
It is the first step of the process. Without the recognition of
the  need  a  purchase  cannot  take  place.  In  this  stage,
customers use search and navigation tools to find a product
or service which covers their needs. The website has to
stimulate the desire to purchase to enhance that needs.
2)
Information Search (Table III): This is the next step
customers  may  take  after  they  have  recognized  their
problems and needs in order to find out what they feel is the
best  solution.  The  customers  search  for  information
sources  related  to  the  products  which  can  cover  their
needs.
3)
Purchase Decision Making (Table IV): At this stage,
consumers  evaluate  different  products  on  the  basis  of
varying product attributes to find the product which offers
more benefits. After that process, the customers make a
choice.
4)
Transaction (Table V): The checkout is the last step
in the Buying Decision Process. It has to be clear and
trustworthy to drive the customers to finish a purchase.
5)
Post-Sales  Behaviour  (Table  VI): At  this  stage,
companies should carefully create positive post-purchase
communication to engage the customers. Also, the system
has  to  facilitate  tools  to  modify  or  follow  customer's
orders.
6)
Factors That  Affect  The  UX  During  The  Whole
Purchase Process (Table VII): There are many factors that
affect whole purchase process and contribute in providing
a  satisfactory  UX.  One  of  the  most  important  is
trustworthiness because the customers have to believe that
the website is reliable to finish a purchase.
B. Heuristics presentation
The heuristics are presented in the following six tables.
It is shown according to the column order: the heuristics
formulated as a questions to contrast with the website, a
short explanation or examples to assist the rating decision
making, the sources where the recommendation come from
and the most appropriate rating system. It is recommended
to add an additional column where experts can write their
observations and reasons for scoring the heuristics in a
manner of their choosing.

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
As  we  pointed  out  in  the  methodology  section,  the
heuristics  presented  above  are  derived  from  functional
requirements expressed by customers and from factors that
capture the quality of e-commerce websites. Therefore, they do
not  equally  cover  every  UX's  facet  mentioned  in  the
introduction. The only aspect that any of the three studies have
considered  is  the  accessibility.  None  the  less,  it  is  quite
common  to  check  it  separately  with  online  tools  that
automatically analyze it and provide quantitative results [4].
Anyway,  as  a  future  work,  it  is  planned  to  integrate
accessibility requirements in the proposed model to improve
the consistency of the evaluation.
The  presented  heuristic  set  is  an  assisting  tool  for
evaluators based on proved standards to review the aspects of a
website that can affect UX. It is an open list that is going to be
extended in a broader study by adding more recommendations
to create a greater and more exhaustive set of heuristics. The
set will be updated and adapted by modifications, updates and
additions because of the continuous evolution of e-commerce
sites. The follow up study's goal is to cover as many B2C
websites and UX's aspects as possible. In this way, the set can
serve a wide range of e-commerce sites that may require only
small adjustments depending on the website features. Thus, the
set might require some revision to discard the sections and
heuristics which do not apply.
Moreover, it is necessary to add that the current set of
heuristics  has  some  more  limitations  apart  from  the  ones
mentioned. The heuristics understandability has been checked
by two experts, but the set has not yet been used to review any
e-commerce websites. Consequently, it is not possible to prove
empirically its efficiency. 
Finally, as future work, it has been planned to follow this
research introducing the presented heuristics into the Open-
HEREDEUX repository [12][13]. This will enable to start an
experimental test with two objectives: enhance the database of
Open-HEREDEUX heuristics (introducing a specific set for e-
commerce systems) and validate the set of guidelines presented
in  this  paper.  The  second  goal  will  consist  in  evaluating
different e-commerce sites (between 5 and 10) in order to
obtain and analyze the results. This also will serve to refine the
e-commerce set of heuristics.
