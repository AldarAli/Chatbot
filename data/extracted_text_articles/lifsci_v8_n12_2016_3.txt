Abstract—Porous silicon has become the gold standard 
when it comes to improving biocompatibility and bioactivity. 
For this reason, it has become a primary candidate in neural 
electrodes research and development. Consequently, the 
purpose of this work was to investigate the mechanical 
strength of porous silicon neural electrodes. Thus, a finite 
element model representing the proposed electrode was 
generated. Mechanical simulation was done on porous and 
non-porous electrodes using COMSOL® Multiphysics. 
Results showed that porosity decreased the mechanical 
strength of the neural electrode without risking the 
mechanical requirements for neural applications. 
Keywords- biocompatiblity; finite element model; failure 
analysis; neural microelectrodes; porous silicon. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The application of technological advances to cure 
neurological diseases has long seized the attention of 
researchers in neural engineering. The first acknowledged 
use of electrical current in an approach to treat a neural 
disease goes back to the year 1757. This has gravely 
evolved nowadays due to progresses in neuroscience and 
microtechnology, where a wide range of neural electrodes 
have been fabricated and used in neuroscience and neural 
prosthetic research (brain machine interfaces) [1], [2],  [3],  
[4].  
Neural electrodes, which are micro structures that are 
implanted in the brain, serve as a communication channel 
between the electro-active neurons in the brain and an 
outer electronic circuitry [5], [6], [7].  
These electrodes are used in both recording action 
potentials from neurons and stimulating specific brain 
regions. The electrical stimulation of nerve tissue and 
recording of neural electrical activity are the foundation of 
evolving prostheses and treatments for spinal cord injury, 
stroke, sensory deficits, and neurological disorders such as 
seizures, epilepsy, and migraine [7], [8]. 
As schematized in Figure 1, brain-computer interfaces 
(BCIs), which incorporate the use of neural electrodes, 
provide a linkage between the brain and the external world 
by computer processing the recorded neural signal to 
extract the subject’s command to control an external 
device. This technology can allow restoring neural 
functions of patients with severe neurologic impairment 
[9]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
When it comes to the general characteristics of a neural 
electrode, it is notable to mention that the ideal electrode 
should have a very small cross section in a way that it 
displaces or damages as little tissue as possible during 
insertion in order to minimize neural damage. Another 
reason that makes the small footprint of the neural 
electrode desirable is that the smaller size allows the 
selective targeting of the desired neurons, thus improving 
the signal-to-noise ratio of the recorded activity or 
targeting a very specific region to be stimulated. On the 
other hand, the ideal electrode should also be wide enough 
to incorporate a large number of electrode sites to be able 
to record and reliably separate different neurons. 
Regardless of the size, the electrode must be optimized for 
long term biocompatibility and should have enough 
mechanical strength to survive the various forces to which 
it is subjected during insertion and retraction forces while 
implantation [11], [12]. Several types of neural electrodes 
have been designed and developed until this day (Figure 
2). In the 1950s, the initial use of implantable 
microelectrodes to record electrical activities in the 
extracellular environments was traced [13], [14], [15]. 
These microelectrodes, also known as microwires (Figure 
2-A), have the longest history and the widest use in the 
field. Microwires are wires made of a conducting metal, 
such as platinum, gold [16], tungsten [17], iridium [18], or 
stainless steel [19]. Each microelectrode is composed of a 
metal wire entirely insulated except for its tip; it is left 
exposed acting as a recording site [20], [21], [22]. Later, 
the use of microelectrodes advanced into offering the 
ability of provide multiple metal electrode arrays [23].

Those 
were 
constructed 
by 
pasting 
individual 
microelectrodes together [24], [25], or by gathering several 
metal wires on a ceramic plate [26]. However, the 
drawback of this type is that only one recording site is 
available, which is located at the exposed tip. Hence, any 
attempt to increase the number of recording sites would 
include increasing the number of electrodes. This will in 
turn increase the total size of the electrode, which is a 
feature that is not usually preferred due to the resulting 
neural tissue damage it might cause. Furthermore, thought 
a metal microelectrode has the advantage of simplicity in 
terms of the process of fabrication, this simplicity is the 
reason of a major drawback, which is the lack of common 
standards and automation. Thus, the characteristics of the 
electrode would vary from one institution to another or 
from one laboratory to another [11]. 
This drawback was solved with the introduction of 
silicon based neural electrodes that emerged with the 
development of microfabrication techniques and the 
advancement 
in 
microelectronics 
and 
microelectrochemical systems (MEMS) [27], [28], [29]. It 
was in the 1970s when Wise and Angell have published a 
silicon-based electrode to interface neural tissues [30], 
[31]. Generally speaking, silicon electrodes offered a 
superiority over the metal microelectrodes since they 
allowed an increased number of recording sites without 
increasing the whole size of the electrode as well as their 
precise and reproducible fabrication [32]. In other words, 
by using the photolithography process, the designer would 
be able to gain control over the recording site size, shape 
and spacing enabling multiple recording sites to be placed 
at variable heights on a single electrode shank. 
Consequently, it would be possible to introduce an 
increased number of recording sites in a small volume, 
which is not possible with metal electrode arrays [28]. In 
addition, silicon offers well-recognized biocompatibility 
and 
mechanical 
properties 
appropriate 
for 
neural 
electrodes [11]. Well-known examples of silicon neural 
electrodes are the Utah [33], [34] and the Michigan [6], 
[35], [36], [37] electrodes. The Utah electrode array 
(Figure 2-C to the left) is a famous MEMS microelectrode 
array, which is a widely used type of implantable interface 
in BCI. The fabrication of the Utah electrode array 
includes micromachining monocrystalline silicon blocks to 
form a shape similar to a bed of nails. As for the Michigan 
electrode (Figure 2-C to the right), it is composed of a 
boron-diffused silicon substrate, a silicon dioxide and 
silicon nitride dielectric stack, polysilicon traces, and 
iridium electrode sites [38].  
Another type of electrodes is the polymer-based neural 
electrode characterized by improved flexibility and 
biocompatibility as well as the advantage of a simpler 
fabrication 
process 
[39], 
[40], 
[41], 
[42], 
[43]. 
Traditionally, in the process of fabrication of a neural 
silicon electrode, the electrode was usually insulated by a 
silicon nitride or silicone dioxide layer. This was swapped 
by the use of polymeric materials in neural electrodes [44], 
[45], [46]. Serving the purpose of forming a biocompatible 
interface between the neural electrode and the brain tissue 
where it is implanted, several biocompatible polymers 
have been used. These include the use of polyimide and 
Parylene-C, which play the role of insulating the metal and 
silicon region of the electrode [46], [47], [48]. However, a 
significant limitation of this type of electrodes is that they 
are not stiff enough to penetrate the brain tissue on their 
own. In other words, these electrodes suffer from lack of 
rigidity, which leads to less accurate neural targeting due 
to the buckling of the electrode during the insertion phase 
[11].

This article covers the simulation of the mechanical 
behavior of porous silicon neural electrode. The next 
section presents the major limitation of present types of 
chronically implanted neural electrodes due to the resultant 
brain tissue response. Section III shows how using porous 
silicon plays a critical role in solving these limitations.

II. LIMITATION  OF CHRONICALLY IMPLANTED NEURAL 
ELECTRODES: THE BRAIN TISSUE RESPONSE 
While the previously mentioned systems function well 
during acute recordings, they frequently do not succeed to 
operate reliably in clinically relevant chronic settings. The 
reason why these electrodes fail has been attributed to the 
brain tissue reaction against these implants. This brain 
tissue response is provoked by the neural injury upon the 
implantation of the electrode. Consequently, the resultant 
tissue response threatens the long-term functioning of the 
neural electrode. This response includes two major stages 
known as the acute immune and the chronic immune 
responses [20], [49], [50], [51] as illustrated in Figure 3. 
The implantation of any neural electrode is always a 
traumatic procedure. When a neural electrode is inserted 
into the brain, it breaches the vasculature, the extracellular 
matrix, and destroys neuronal and glial processes in its 
path. This gives rise to the acute immune response. 
Forthwith, by misplacing structures along its way, the 
electrode would cause an alternation in the pressure status 
in that region inducing a high-pressure region around the 
electrode. These factors combined cause edema and 
hemorrhage near the implant. Accordingly, the wound 
healing process will be commenced as a result. Since the 
blood vessels are disrupted, this provokes them to 
discharge erythrocytes, activates platelets, clotting factors, 
and the complement cascade. This process will assist in 
macrophage stimulation and the beginning of tissue 
reconstruction. One day after implementation, activated 
microglia will show up around the implant.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
Figure 3.  Acute and chronic neural injury caused by the insertion of the 
neural electrode into the brain cortex [49]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 Soon enough, the acute immune response will start to 
deteriorate, which is directly followed by a chronic 
immune response. The most influential participants in this 
phase are reactive astrocytes and activated microglia [52], 
[53]. This response results in the formation of an 
encapsulation layer termed the “glial scar” around the 
electrode. Activated microglia will be engaged in the 
phagocytosis of the foreign matter for eventual 
degradation. However, the most significant event that is 
notable in the long-term response to the chronically 
implanted electrode is the formation of the encapsulation 
layer. This glial scar is a reactive glial tissue with reactive 
astrocytes being its major element. It isolates the 
implanted neural electrode from the surrounding tissue in 
a process that resembles fibrotic encapsulation reaction 
encountered with non-degradable implants in soft tissues. 
This encourages the inhibition of diffusion and increases 
the impedance of the tissue-electrode interface. In 
addition, this also extends the distance between the 
electrode and the nearest desired neurons. Accordingly, 
the neurite extensions will find themselves in a non-
encouraging environment for growth, the thing that 
pushes redeveloping neural processes away from the 
recording sites. This leads to signal deterioration [20], 
[51], [54], [55], [56]. 
III. ADVANTAGES OF POROUS SILICON FOR NEURAL 
ELECTRODES 
As stated earlier, interactions between the brain tissue 
and the electrode are critical in determining the functional 
performance of the electrode. Various strategies have 
been investigated and experimented as an attempt to 
minimize the immune response towards the chronically 
implanted neural electrode. Some related the degree of the 
immune response to the size of the electrode [56]. Others 
thought that the severity of the immune response can be 
controlled by altering the shape of the electrode [57]. 
Additionally, it has been proven that tissue response is 
highly dependent on the surface topography [58]. In the 
latter approach, it has been tested and proved that rough 
surfaces are more biocompatible than smooth surfaces 
[59]. An alternation in the surface topography so that it 
would be transformed from smooth to rough could be by 
making the surface porous. In particular, the use of porous 
silicon as the material that the implants would be made of 
has shown enhanced biocompatibility and bioactivity  
[60], [61], [62].  
For instance, in a study performed by Hajj-Hassan et 
al. [62], the biocompatibility and bioactivity of porous 
silicon wafers (Si) was assessed by examining the 
survival and replication of mesenchymal stromal cells 
(MSC) isolated from the bone marrow of wild type mice. 
These results were compared with that of cells growing in 
2D culture on tissue culture plastic (TCP) and on smooth 
titanium (SmTi), which is well known for its superiority 
(gold standard) for the manufacture of implants. In the 
first experiment performed, bone marrow derived MSC 
were seeded in porous silicon wafers etched to a depth of 
20 μm (Si20) in 12 well plates and harvested after 3, 6, 
and 9 days of culture. Control cells plated at the same 

29

density on tissue culture plastic were harvested at 6 days 
and stained with toluidine blue to visualize the cells. 
Results showed that the Si20 substrate supported the MSC 
growth. Additionally, an Alamar Blue metabolic assay 
was used to analyze the metabolic activity of cells grown 
porous silicon substrates etched to a depth of 20 μm 
(Si20) or 30 μm (Si30) and compared with TCP or 
smooth titanium, which is a common implant material. 
Representative results of the Alamar Blue assay, shown in 
Figure 4(A), indicate a small increase in metabolic 
activity of the cells grown on Si20 and Si30 samples 
compared to smooth titanium and tissue culture plastic 
controls. The cell counts indicated a steady increase in 
numbers that appeared to be dependent on the substrate 
on which they were grown.

etched to a depth of 20 μm (Si20), 30 μm (Si30), commercial grade

Alamar Blue assay to assess the metabolic activity [61]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
So, it has been shown that the introduction of the 
pores improves the biocompatibility and bioactivity. 
However, a fundamental question imposes itself regarding 
whether their introduction influences the mechanical 
strength of the electrode. In other words, we are interested 
in knowing if the implanted porous electrode will still 
survive the forces exerted by the brain environment 
during and after implantation. The solution to this 
question is demonstrated in the sections that follow. 
IV. DESIGN 
The following section covers the design of the 
proposed neural electrode. The developed neural electrode 
is constructed using a silicon substrate (Young’s Modulus 
= 190 GPa & Poisson’s ratio = 0.17) and is considered to 
be ultra-long with a total length of 10.5 mm. Its overall 
structure is tapered, which facilitates the penetration. The 
geometry of the electrode is sectioned into three main 
regions; a base region, a measuring region incorporating 
the metal recording sites, and a piercing region. The base 
region measures 250 μm in length with a width of 350 μm 
at the base that rapidly reduces to a width of 150 μm. This 
design aids in diminishing brain tissue damage and 
displacement. The measuring region that has a length of 10 
mm starts with a width of 150 μm at the base and ends up 
with 50 μm at the other end. Following the measuring 
region is the piercing region, which has a length of 250 μm 
and is designed to be of 10 μm width at the end of the 
probe. 
The relative dimensions of these regions are indicated 
in Figure 5. The electrode was implemented using 
COMSOL© Multiphysics 4.3 as depicted in Figure 6.

In the selection of the criteria to develop the pores, we 
chose the various dimensions of the pores according to the 
limitations imposed by the standard fabrication processes 
followed. In other words, our selection should be similar to 
what is available and applicable in the fabrication world. 
The medium in which the probe is to be inserted contains 
features that exhibit micro and nano dimensions. In an 
attempt to mimic this medium, we select the radius of the 
pores in the low micro-level and the pore depth was 
constant at 0.6 μm due to fabrication standards. Our 
approach included pores with a cylindrical geometry with 
a radius of 1.5 μm (Figure 7).

The distance separating the pores in both the x and y 
directions is approximately 3 μm. As mentioned earlier, 
each pore had a depth of 0.6 μm. The pores distributed 
along the entire geometry of the probe except at the 
regions were the metal sites and connecting wires are 
placed. This is depicted in Figures 8 and 9, respectively.

V. SIMULATION STRATEGY 
As an attempt to predict the mechanical behavior of 
the proposed probe, both a finite element model 
simulation approach and an analytical calculation 
approach were performed for both a non-porous and 
porous electrode. This is targeted to approximate the 
differences between the two approaches.  
The aim is to mimic the forces applied to the electrode 
during and after insertion into the brain. The naturally 
imposed forces can be classified into three different cases; 
case one includes the application of two axial forces, 
which are imposed during the penetration phase, case two 
includes the application of a single axial force, which 
occurs directly after penetration and may cause the 
buckling of the probe, and case three includes the 
application of a vertical force, which occurs after the 
probe implementation and may result in the bending of 
the probe. Out of plane forces rarely happen because 
when the probe is implanted it is mounted on a motion 
controller, which goes in one direction towards the brain 
(x-axis). Hence, the force along x-axis will be focused 
upon throughout this paper in the different strategies 
followed. 
Most importantly, in both strategies, the maximum 
critical stress was to be yielded and this stress was to be 
compared to the yielding stress of the material. The 
yielding stress of Silicon is approximately equal to 1GPa 
[63]. It is essential to mention that the maximum critical 
stress in both strategies followed is determined using the 
“Maximum Distortion Energy Theory”, also known as the 
“R. von Mises Theory”, which is demonstrated in 
equation (1) below [64], where σe is the  effective stress 
or von Mises stress and σ1,2 are the principal stresses. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  σe=(σ1
2+σ1σ2+σ2
2 )1/2                                    (1) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
The maximum distortion energy theory is one of the 
famous failure theories for ductile material. This theory 
states that failure is predicted to occur in the multiaxial 
state of stress when the distortion energy per unit volume 
becomes equal to or exceeds the distortion energy per unit 
volume at the time of failure in a simple uniaxial stress 
test using a specimen of the same material [65]. In other 
words, a given structural material is safe as long as the 
maximum value of the distortion energy per unit volume 
in that material remains smaller than the maximum 
distortion energy per unit volume required for causing 
yield in a tensile test specified of the same material. The 
simulated effective stress is then compared to the yielding 
stress of the material. 
Regarding the Finite Element Model (FEM) strategy 
increasing forces were gradually applied on both the 
porous and the non-porous electrodes until the yield stress 
of the material is reached. These forces were applied on 
the front face of the piercing tip while fixing the back face 
of the support base region as illustrated in Figure 10. 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
Figure 10.  Marked in green is (a) Area on which the stress is applied, 
(b) area which is a fixed constraint. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
It is notable to mention that during the simulation of 
the porous electrode, pores were restricted to the weakest 
regions of the electrode as seen in Figure 11.  
This 
was 
done 
to 
reduce 
the 
computational 
complexity. These regions are the middle of the electrode 
(during axial loads), and the base region of the electrode 
(during vertical loads) [66]. 
As for the analytical strategy, the internal forces that 
generated in the porous and the non-porous probes upon 
the application of the different combination of loads in the 

31

three cases were calculated. These internal forces were 
used to calculate the resulting principal stresses according 
to equation (2) below, where σx and σy are the induced 
stresses and τxy is the induced shear stress.

These principal stresses were then employed either to 
calculate the maximum distortion energy or the von Mises 
stress in case 1 (x-axis and y-axis axial forces) and case 
three (z-axis vertical force) or to compare with the critical 
stress and the elastic stress in case 2 (x-axis axial force). 
The calculation of the von Mises stresses is done by the 
previously 
mentioned 
equation. 
Meanwhile, 
the 
calculation of the critical stress is done by the calculation 
of the critical buckling load, which is yielded by the 
extended Euler’s Formula stated below [67] .

where A is the cross-sectional area upon which the load is 
applied, Pcritical is the critical load, E is the Young’s 
Modulus of the material, I is the moment of inertia of the 
cross-section, KL is the effective length of the electrode. 
In the case of a column fixed at its base K is equal to 2 
[67]. 
Solving the equations will give us an idea about how 
far the finite element model is from the analytical 
equations. As mentioned earlier, out of plane forces rarely 
happen because when the probe is implanted it is mounted 
on a motion controller, which goes in one direction 
towards the brain (x-axis). Hence, the force along x-axis 
will be focused upon in the analytical strategy.       
However, before starting with the FEM strategy, and 
in order to study the stability of the FEM with respect to 
the results obtained, we tried different element sizes until 
the results started converging to the same average values. 
As it will be shown in Table I in the results, the element 
size is changed, the probe is meshed, and the number of 
elements is measured. 
VI. RESULTS 
The following section elaborates on the results 
obtained from the study done to assess the stability of the 
FEM and the simulation of both the porous and non-
porous electrodes in the FEM strategy and the analytical 
strategy. For each simulation, a plot of the induced 
principal stress in MPa versus the length of the electrode 
in µm as a result of applying the loads is obtained. 
Subsection 1 will cover the results yielded in from the 
FEM stability study, subsection 2 will demonstrate the 
results yielded from the analytical strategy, subsections 3, 
4, and 5 will cover the results yielded from the FEM 
simulation strategy in the three different cases. Subsection 
6 will show a comparison between the analytical and the 
FEM strategies. 
1) Results of the FEM Stability Study 
As mentioned earlier, different element sizes were 
chosen until the results starting converging to the same 
average values. As shown in Table I, the element size is 
changed, the probe is meshed, and the number of 
elements is measured.

The results obtained are also plotted in a curve as 
illustrated in Figure 12. One can notice the exponential 
increase in the number of elements when the element size 
decreased. 
 
The results were also calculated for different 
element size. Element size was decreased until the finite 
element model started converging to a range of close 
values as shown in Table II.

The results obtained are plotted on a curve as 
shown in Figure 13. It is important to note that the y-axis 
starts from 1000 MPa. Starting from 0 MPa the result was 
a straight horizontal line, hence it was changed to start 
from 1000 MPa to shown the fluctuations before the 
results converged.

2) Results of the Analytical Strategy 
It is beneficial to reiterate that the results presented in 
this section are yielded by performing calculations upon 
the application of the axial force since is it the most 
significant. 
For the non-porous electrode, upon the application of 
the maximum force of 527.5 mN the internal stress 
induced was found to be equal to 1055 MPa. Meanwhile, 
upon the application of the minimum force of 2.42 mN 
[68], the internal stress induced was found to be 4.94 
MPa. Additionally, the critical force and critical stress 
that are required for comparison were also calculated 
according to the previously mentioned equations and were 
found to be equal to 4.4 mN and 8.8 MPa, respectively. 
Regarding the porous electrode, two main parameters 
must be obtained in order to characterize the mechanical 
behavior analytically. The parameters are the young’s 
modulus of silicon at the specific porosity and the yield 
stress at which the material will fail at this porosity. The 
porosity was calculated by taking into consideration the 
number of pores and their cylindrical volume with respect 
to the total volume of the electrode. This is demonstrated 
in equations (5) and (6).

In order to obtain the young’s modulus of porous 
silicon at our porosity, different studies were researched. 
These studies are illustrated in Figure 14. The closest 
study for the change in young’s modulus relative to the 
percentage of porosity is the one done by Al-Douri et al. 
[69]. As for the yield stress of our porous silicon material, 
there are no previous studies in the literature so far. Since 
the geometry of the porous electrode is the same as the 
non-porous one, and since both are of the same material 
we will do the following assumption. We will assume that 
both will have the same yield strain that will to failure. 
Having this yield strain and knowing the young’s 
modulus we are able to calculate the yield stress of our 
porous silicon according to Hook’s law given in the 
equation below. 
𝜎 = 𝐸 × 𝜀𝑦                              (7) 
Since in the selected literature the closest young’s 
modulus to ours, which is 190 GPa, is 185, we will redo 
the FEM simulation at 185 GPa in order to compare it to 
the analytical solution. After repeating the simulation for 
case 2 only at 185 GPa, result showed that in the porous 
probe a stress of 970 MPa induced the yield stress of 
961.67 MPa. The color map of this FEM simulation is 
displayed below in Figure 15 only to confirm the yielded 
result.

That being said, the new young’s modulus at our 
porosity (0.16%) is 184.2 GPa and the yield stress is 
969.47 MPa. According to the new E, the new critical 
stress and force are to be calculated. The critical stress for 
the porous electrode was found to be equal to 8.5 MPa, 
and the critical force equal to 4.26 mN. 
3) Results of the Application of a Compression 
Force Along X-axis During Penetration (Case 2) 
This section demonstrates the result of the application 
of a single axial force that occurs directly after 
penetration. For the non-porous electrode, an axial stress 
of 1055 MPa that is equivalent to a force of 527.5 mN 
along the negative x-axis induced stress of around 1GPa 
at a length of around 10.5 mm, which corresponds to the 
tip of the electrode. This is depicted in Figure 16. The 
concentration of the induced stresses is illustrated in 
Figure 17.  
As for the porous electrode, a force of 522.5 mN 
induced a similar response at a similar location as shown 
in Figure 19 and illustrated in Figure 18. It is worth noting 
that the high stress is concentrated at the tip of the 
electrode that is in direct contact with the brain. This 
contact induces the most significant stress that may cause 
the failure of the probe.

4) Results of the Application of the Force Induced 
Due to Slipping Upon Insertion (Case 1) 
This section covers the application of two axial forces 
(along negative x and y axes), which are imposed during 
the penetration phase. For the non-porous electrode, a 
force of 378 mN (x: 375, y: 47.5) induced a stress of ~ 1 
GPa at two locations in the electrode; at a distance of ~ 
5800 μm corresponding to the middle region (the blue 
curve in Figure 20), and at a distance of ~ 10.5 mm 
corresponding to the tip of the electrode (the green curve 
in Figure 20). The resulting surface stresses are 
demonstrated in Figure 21.

Meanwhile, in the porous electrode, a force of 378 
mN (x: 375, y: 47.5) induced a stress of ~ 1 GPa at two 
locations in the electrode; at a distance of ~ 5800 μm 
corresponding to the middle porous region (the blue curve 
in Figure 22), and at a distance of ~ 10.5mm 
corresponding to the tip of the electrode (the green curve 
in Figure 22). The resulting surface stresses are 
demonstrated in Figure 23.

5) Results of the Application of the Force Induced 
Upon Brain Movement After Implantation (Case 
3) 
Finally, this section covers the application of a vertical 
force that occurs after the probe implementation. For the 
non-porous electrode, a stress of 36.5 MPa (18.25m N) 
applied along the –ve z-axis induced a stress of ~ 1000 
MPa (Figure 24) at a length of around 400 μm, which

corresponds to the fixed bottom region of the electrode as 
depicted in Figure 25.

On the other hand, in the porous electrode, a stress of 
23 MPa (11.5 mN) applied along the –ve z-axis induced a 
stress of ~ 1000 MPa (Figure 26) at a length of around 
750 μm, which corresponds to the weakest porous fixed 
bottom region of the electrode as depicted in Figure 27.

6) Discussion 
After the mechanical behavior of the electrodes was 
analyzed using two different approaches, a FEM and an 
analytical approach, we were able to estimate the 
difference between the FEM model simulation and the 
analytical solution by a comparison of both results (Table 
III). This comparison showed that the similarity between 
the two approaches was equal to 96.76%. The minimal 
difference is possibly due to that FEM is a physical model 
and the equations cannot fully represent the model.

On the other hand, regarding the FEM strategy 
performed on the three different cases, due to the 
comparison of the forces that induced the maximum yield 
stress in the three different cases for the non-porous probe 
(Case 1: 378 mN (x: 375, y: 47.5); Case 2: 527.5 mN; 
Case 3: 18.25 mN) and the ones for the porous probe 
(Case 1: 376.8 mN (x: 375, y: 37.5); Case 2: 522.5 mN; 
Case 3: 11.5 mN), one can notice the mechanical 
weakening of the porous silicon probe. This is true due to 
the fact that the values of the forces that induced the 
maximum yield stress in the porous probe are less than 
those in the non-porous probe. The weakening was 0.3 %, 
0.1%, 37% in case 1, 2 and 3, respectively.  
Nonetheless, this weakening will not risk the 
mechanical integrity of the neural probe used in brain 
applications. The reason is that the force that induced the 
maximum yield stress of the porous probe (522.5mN 
along the x-axis) is still much higher than the minimum 
force that the probe must withstand during the penetration 
of the brain tissue (2.42±0.77 mN along the x-axis [66]).

VII. CONCLUSION 
We have presented the novel idea of the mechanical 
simulation of a porous neural electrode. Even though the 
introduction of the pores relatively weakened the neural 
electrode, the electrode was found still capable of 
surviving the brain environment. Nevertheless, certain 
limitations were present especially related to the finite 
element model. The full arrays of pores could not be 
simulated due to computational complexity and they were 
restricted to the weakest areas. Moreover, different radii 
of pores and volume porosity percentages should be 
tested.  The porous electrode is superior to the non-porous 
electrode due to the improved biocompatibility and 
bioactivity it offers. Furthermore, the presence of the 
pores gives an additional advantage where they can 
behave as scaffolds for entrapping neural growth factors 
that encourage the re-growth of neurons. This alteration to 
the electrode’s design is able to advance the healthcare 
services provided to neural diseases’ patients all around 
the world.
