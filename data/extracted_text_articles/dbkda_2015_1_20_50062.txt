Abstract―In this paper, we study the clustering of 
keywords in documents. We consider a model of fuzzy 
neighborhood for measuring similarity between words. 
Fuzzy neighborhoods lead to positive-definite kernels. By 
using the methods of kernel-based fuzzy c-means and 
affinity propagation, we show the results of clustering for 
Chinese documents on the Web. Moreover, Rand index is 
used to compare robustness of hard and fuzzy c-means 
algorithms with respect to different initial values. 
 
Keywords- kernel-based clustering; fuzzy neighborhood; 
c-means; keywords in texts. 
 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
 
  With the development of information and communication 
technology, the Web became a large and complex resource of 
information. However, by processing of the data from Internet 
having non-numeric attributes of huge volume, it is difficult to 
use them effectively and easily, although there is a huge 
amount of important data being used widely in daily life. In 
order to provide a better usability of Web data, a technique 
called text mining has attracted attention of many users. In 
China, with the spread of Internet, the demand and opportunity 
to handle a large number of documents, blogs, Twitter, and 
news Web pages is increasing very rapidly. This has attracted 
attention for text mining. 
  The purpose of this study is to show the effectiveness of 
clustering [1] using a fuzzy neighborhood model [2] [3] that 
regards a document as a sequence of words/terms. By 
extracting words of interest from text data on the Web, we 
calculate the similarity of words based on the neighborhood 
model and we obtain clusters of words using this similarity. A 
feature of this model is that the similarity satisfies the property 
of positive-definite kernel function [4]. This method is applied 
to a set of Chinese documents on the Web, where the methods 
of hard c-means, fuzzy c-means [1], and affinity propagation 
[5] [6] are used. A problem of c-means is the dependence of 
clusters on initial values. We use Rand index [7] to compare 
the degrees of dependence by different algorithms. 
  The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 
describes the methods that are used for clustering, which is the 
main part of this paper. The methods of kernel-based fuzzy 
c-means as well as kernel-based affinity propagation are 
described. Section 3 shows the application of these methods to 
a Chinese document. Finally, Section 4 concludes the paper. 
 
II. 
MODEL FOR CLUSTERING 
   
The purpose here is to generate clusters of words or terms in 
a text.  When we have a set of texts, they are handled as a 
single long text by concatenating them. 
 
A. Fuzzy Neighborhood Model 
  A fuzzy neighborhood is a model for text data analysis. It 
does not just consider the numbers of word appearances, but 
also consider the location of the words in the text. We assume 
that when two words are near, a similarity between these 
words is higher. 
All the items of fuzzy neighborhood model used in this 
study are defined as follows: 
A word set or term set 𝑇 = {𝑡1, … , 𝑡𝑚} is the objects for 
clustering. 
An 
occurrence 
set 
𝑜, 𝑜′, 𝑜𝑖 … ∈ 𝑂  is 
assumed. 
An 
occurrence o is different from a term t in the sense that a term 
can appear more than once in a same document. 
A text is a sequence of occurrences: 𝑜𝑜′𝑜′′ …, where terms 
are occurring several or many times; the relation between an 
occurrence and a term is described by the next relation. 
A fuzzy relation between T and O is assumed: when t and o 
imply the same term, 𝑅(𝑡, 𝑜) = 1; when the t and o are 
different  term, 𝑅(𝑡, 𝑜) = 0, when t and o have fuzzy relation, 
0 < 𝑅(𝑡, 𝑜) < 1. 
D is the distance between occurrences o and 𝑜′ in a text, 
which is defined as follows:  
 
𝐷(𝑜, 𝑜′) ={number of occurrences between o and 𝑜′} + 1 (1) 
 
Another fuzzy relation N of 𝑂 × 𝑂 is defined by using the 
distance, which is called a fuzzy neighborhood. 𝑁(𝑜𝑖, 𝑜𝑗) 
means the degree of nearness between terms 𝑜𝑖 and 𝑜𝑗; 
A 
function 
f 
defines 
a 
particular 
form 
of 
N,  
𝑓: {0,1,2, … } → [0,1]; f satisfies the next conditions: 
1. 𝑓(0) = 1, 
2. 𝑙𝑖𝑚𝑥→∞ 𝑓(𝑥) = 0, 
3. f  is monotone non-increasing.  
Using f and D,  N is defined as follows:

             𝑁(𝑜, 𝑜′) =  𝑓(𝐷(𝑜, 𝑜′)) .              (2) 
The fuzzy neighborhood has symmetry and reflectivity, which 
is shown as follows: 
               𝑁(𝑜, 𝑜′) =  𝑁(𝑜′, 𝑜)                 (3) 
𝑁(𝑜, 𝑜) =  1.                      (4) 
The formula shown below is a typical example of fuzzy 
neighborhood defined by the distance: 
              𝑁(𝑜, 𝑜′) =  max {0 , 1 − 
𝐷(𝑜,𝑜′)
𝐿
},       (5) 
where L is a positive constant. 
Figure 1 shows an example of a functional form of fuzzy 
neighborhood. The center is an occurrence of a term.

  A relation 𝑝(𝑡, 𝑡′) is a similarity measure between two 
words, which is defined as follows: 
𝑝(𝑡, 𝑡′) = ∑
∑
𝑏∈𝑂 𝑅(𝑡, 𝑎)𝑁(𝑎, 𝑏)𝑅(𝑡′, 𝑏)
𝑎∈𝑂
      (6) 
  Another relation 𝑠(𝑡, 𝑡′) is a normalized measure derived 
from 𝑝(𝑡, 𝑡′); 𝑠(𝑡, 𝑡′) is defined as follows: 
        𝑠(𝑡, 𝑡′) =  
𝑝൫𝑡,𝑡′൯
ට𝑝(𝑡,𝑡)𝑝൫𝑡′,𝑡′൯
                (7) 
 
  It can be proved that similarity 𝑝(𝑡, 𝑡′) using (5) becomes a 
positive-definite kernel function [4]. More generally, when 
function f is convex, 𝑝(𝑡, 𝑡′) is positive-definite. See [2] or 
[3] for the proof.  It is not difficult to see that 𝑠(𝑡, 𝑡′) is also 
positive-definite. 
 
B. Kernel fuzzy c-means 
  The method of kernel c-means can be applied to data with 
clusters having nonlinear boundaries; without a kernel, only 
linear boundaries can be obtained by c-means [1]. In this study, 
the similarity calculated by fuzzy neighborhood is a kernel 
function. 
Clustering using kernel function uses a high-dimensional 
feature space, which is the main difference from ordinary 
fuzzy c-means [1]. 
  The objective function of kernel-fuzzy c-means (K-FCM) is 
as follows: 
      𝐽𝑘𝑓𝑐𝑚(𝑈, 𝑊) = ∑
∑
(𝑢𝑖𝑘)𝑚‖∅(𝑥𝑘) − 𝑊𝑖‖2
𝑐
𝑖=1
𝑛
𝑘=1
     (8) 
where Wi is the center of cluster i in a high-dimensional 
feature space, and can be obtained by minimizing (8) with 
respect to Wi: 
             𝑊𝑖 =  
1
𝑁𝑖 ∑
(𝑢𝑖𝑘)𝑚∅(𝑥𝑘)
𝑛
𝑘=1
.            (9) 
  Note that ∅(𝑥𝑘) is called a high-dimensional mapping. The 
functional form of ∅(𝑥𝑘) is generally unknown but its inner 
product is known and given by a kernel function 𝐾൫𝑥𝑗, 𝑥𝑘൯ =
(∅(𝑥𝑗), ∅(𝑥𝑘)). Note that either 𝑝(𝑡, 𝑡′) or 𝑠(𝑡, 𝑡′) can be 
used as the kernel function. 
We cannot calculate (9) directly in c-means clustering. 
Instead, distance 𝑑𝑖𝑘  is calculated by using the kernel 
function 𝐾൫𝑥𝑗, 𝑥𝑘൯ as follows: 
𝑑𝑖𝑘 =  ‖∅(𝑥𝑘) − 𝑊𝑖‖2 = ቯ∅(𝑥𝑘) − 1
𝑁𝑖

  (10) 
Fuzzy membership value 𝑢𝑖𝑘 is given as follows: 
             𝑢𝑖𝑘 = ൥∑

             (11) 
  The algorithm of Kernel Fuzzy c-Means (K-FCM) is as 
follows: 
K-FCM1. Give an initial value of membership degree 𝑈ഥ; 
K-FCM2. Calculate the distance 𝑑𝑖𝑘 of each individual to 
each cluster center in a high-dimensional space; 
K-FCM3. 
Solve 
the 
minimization 
problem 
𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑈∈𝑀𝑓 𝐽𝑘𝑓𝑐𝑚 (U, W) and make 𝑈ഥ as an optimal solution; 
K-FCM4. If the solution is convergent, stop. Else go to 
K-FCM2. 
End of K-FCM. 
  The hard c-means (K-HCM) has also been well-known [1]. 
We omit the detail of K-HCM algorithm. 
 
C.  Kernel Affinity Propagation 
A remarkable point of affinity propagation [5] [6] is that the 
number of clusters is defined by the method itself. In this 
method, all the data points exchange messages between each 
other to decide which cluster to subordinate and which point to 
be the exemplar. 
There are two messages exchanged: responsibility 𝑟(𝑖, 𝑘) 
and availability 𝑎(𝑖, 𝑘). Data point i sends a message of 
responsibility 𝑟(𝑖, 𝑘) to a candidate exemplar point k to show 
how point k is suited to serve as the exemplar for point i. The 
candidate exemplar point k sends the message of availability 
𝑎(𝑖, 𝑘) to point i to reflect the accumulated evidence of the 
degree of appropriateness for point i so that point k is chosen 
as its exemplar [5] [6]. 
Then, responsibility 𝑟(𝑖, 𝑘) is defined by the following 
rule: 
 𝑟(𝑖, 𝑘) ← 𝑠(𝑖, 𝑘) − max𝑘′≠𝑘{𝑎(𝑖, 𝑘′) + 𝑠(𝑖, 𝑘′)}.    (12) 
As the above responsibility is updated by (12), availability is 
updated by the following rule: 
 𝑎(𝑖, 𝑘) ← 𝑚𝑖𝑛 ൛0, 𝑟(𝑘, 𝑘) + ∑
𝑖′∉{𝑖,𝑘} 𝑚𝑎𝑥{0, 𝑟(𝑖′,𝑘)}
ൟ.

But availability of point to itself is different: 
 𝑎(𝑖, 𝑘) ← ∑
𝑖′∉𝑘 𝑚𝑎𝑥{0, 𝑟(𝑖′, 𝑘)}
          (14) 
The similarity 𝑠(𝑖, 𝑘) between two data points is defined 
using the kernel function: For point𝑥𝑖 and 𝑥𝑘, we have 
𝑠(𝑖, 𝑘) = −൫𝐾(𝑥𝑖, 𝑥𝑖) + 𝐾(𝑥𝑘,𝑥𝑘) − 2𝐾(𝑥𝑖, 𝑥𝑘)൯.  (15) 
For data point i, the point k that maximizes 𝑎(𝑖, 𝑘) +
𝑟(𝑖, 𝑘) is chosen to be the exemplar of data point i, in other 
words, data point i belongs to cluster k. 
 
D. Rand Index 
The Rand index [7] is a measure of similarity between two 
data clustering results. The definition is as follows.  
Given N points 𝑆 =  {𝑋1, … , 𝑋𝑁}, and two clusters of them 
𝑌 =  {𝑌1, … , 𝑌𝑠} and 𝑌′ =  {𝑌′1, … , 𝑌′𝑘}, we define: 
・m: the number of pairs of elements in S that are in the 
same set in Y and Y', 
・m’: the number of pairs of elements in S that are in 
different sets in Y and Y'. 
Then the Rand index R is: 
𝑅 =  
𝑚+𝑚′
ቀ𝑁
2ቁ                   (16) 
Assume that we use K-FCM. The result is fuzzy clusters. In 
order to use the Rand index, we make clusters hard by using 
the maximum membership rule: allocate an object to the 
cluster where the membership takes its maximum value.  
When we perform M times of K-FCM algorithm with 
different initial values, we have M results. Then, we use the 
Rand index to calculate each pair of resulting clusters: the 
combination of all the pairs of results is  ቀM
2ቁ . Then the 
average of the Rand index value is calculated. It will show the 
degree of dependence of clusters on the initial values: when 
we have a larger value of the Rand index, it means less 
dependency on the initial values. When we compare the 
averaged Rand indexes for different methods, we can judge 
which method has the least dependency on the initial values, in 
other words, robustness with respect to initial values. 
In this paper, we will show two Rand index values of two 
methods of K-HCM and K-FCM. 
 
III. APPLICATION TO A DOCUMENT IN CHINESE 
 
A document < Company Culture Management > on the Web 
site [8] introduces the importance of company culture and how 
to management the company culture. The data cannot be easily 
clustered by human eyes. Nouns and adjectives of which the 
numbers of occurrences were more than 2 were extracted; the 
number of objects for clustering was 36. 
Figures 2 and 3 show clusters using kernel fuzzy c-means 
and kernel affinity propagation for this document. The kernel 
principal component [4] was used for the visualization. The 
number of clusters for kernel c-means was assumed to be three, 
while the number of clusters was automatically decided in the 
affinity propagation. The number of clusters obtained by the 
latter method can be varied according to the maximum number 
of iterations, but generally the number is far larger than three. 
Investigating the contents of this document, we observe that 
the meanings of the clusters are as follows: 
  ・Cluster 1 (blue): the role of corporate culture and its 
development history; 
・Cluster 1 (red): excellent cases of business or companies, 
such as United States and Japan, outstanding business success 
stories and economic outcomes or impact; 
・Cluster 3 (green): the way we should build the socialist 
modern company culture in the market economy, and the 
importance of modern corporate culture and its role, or the 
regulatory requirements to business leaders, the masses of 
workers and others. 
The details of the keywords in these clusters are omitted 
here, but the three clusters shown by different colors by fuzzy 
c-means correspond well with the three prolonged groups on 
the plane in Figure 2, while geometrical separation of clusters 
is not found in Figure 3. Note that the configuration of points 
in these figures was derived from the kernel principal 
component and is independent of clusters.

and K-HCM. The value of the Rand index was higher when 
we used K-FCM than that of K-HCM, which means that the 
fuzzy method was more robust with respect to the difference 
of initial values than the hard method of c-means clustering. 
 
IV. CONCLUSION 
 
The model of fuzzy neighborhood was shown and the 
kernel based methods of clustering were developed. The 
developed methods were hard and fuzzy kernel c-means as 
well as kernel affinity propagation. The results of application 
to a Chinese document showed interpretable clusters by fuzzy 
c-means, while the result of affinity propagation did not show 
good clusters. Using the Rand index, we showed the method of 
fuzzy c-means gave more robust results than the hard c-means. 
To evaluate the combination of fuzzy neighborhood and kernel 
affinity propagation quantitatively, we need far more 
examples. 
The document is a real Chinese document on the Internet. 
Although the volume is not enough now, further studies of 
Chinese documents or Social Networking Service data seem to 
be promising.
