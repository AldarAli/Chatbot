Abstract—Reliability assessments are generally carried out via 
tests. When a complex system has no opportunity to experience a 
system-level test, Modelling & Simulations (M&S) will be the 
only approach to assess the system reliability, and the 
Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for M&S becomes one of the 
most important techniques. With a method named Quantification 
of Margin and Uncertainty (QMU), reliability could be assessed 
as to make decisions whether the indices have reached the 
demands. With our newly proposed UQ method, QMU could be 
effectively actualized based on M&S. With an example of 
reliability assessment for a stockpiled product, the main ideas and 
the implementation of QMU are demonstrated.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Reliability assessment can be regarded as a decision 
making process in which a decision should be reached 
whether the reliability of products meets the demands. 
Traditionally, such decision making is built on tests, which 
have a solid base of epistemology because of the natural 
creditability about test data. Owing to the impacts from 
politics, economy and security, etc., some complicated 
products can not be subjected to system-level test, so it is 
necessary to predict their performances by scientific 
computing [1]. After the moratorium on the testing of 
nuclear weapons in 1992, National Nuclear Security 
Administration (NNSA) of the United States developed a 
Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP) to assess the nuclear 
stockpile without nuclear testing, and a new method named 
QMU was developed for SSP [2]. For QMU implementation, 
there is an intense divarication how to define the Margin (M) 
and Uncertainty (U). In 2009, we suggested to choose 
probability as QMU metric when failure can not be 
absolutely eliminated due to aleatory uncertainties in 
products, by which QMU gained an unified decision 
criterion as confidence factor C=M/U is greater than unity or 
not [3]. In 2011, Sentz et al. proposed a similar method when 
failures are inevitable owing to the unbounded stochastic 
variables [4]. After that, uncertainty quantification for M&S 
was left to be the main bottleneck in QMU application. 
Many literature works exist on UQ of M&S, but the 
existing methods are roughly falling into two types. One is 
by comparing the simulation results and the test data [5], the 
other is by propagating uncertainties from the input variables 
to the simulation results [6][7][8]. Unfortunately, when 
system-level test is forbidden, the approach with comparison 
can not be used. Considering the probability that the 
systematic deviations may be neglected, and that the 
uncertainties may be overestimated especially when too 
many uncertain inputs exist, the propagated uncertainties can 
not be directly considered as the uncertainties of M&S used 
for prediction. In order to resolve this problem, we propose a 
new method to combine the information originating from 
comparison and propagation [9]. This method has the 
advantage to observe the true-value-covered and uncertainty-
minimized principles of UQ, by which the uncertainties of 
the predictions made by M&S can be effectively quantified.  
The new method includes two important steps, one is to 
extrapolate the uncertainties obtained by comparison from 
validation domain to application domain, the other is to fuse 
the uncertainty information originating from comparison and  
propagation. This paper aims to display the ideas of QMU, 
which is supported by the new methods of UQ. 
In Section 2, a proposition of reliability assessment is 
described. Section 3 shows how to predict the performance 
by M&S. Section 4 shows the UQ of the prediction results. 
Reliability assessment is fulfilled by QMU in Section 5, and 
a conclusion is given in Section 6.

DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSITION 
The example we discuss is about reliability assessment 
for a product which has five parts, namely priming-device, 
high-explosive, special-metal, frame-material and energetic-
material. The lowest demands are 
MJ
Y demand
 500
 for 
yield-energy Y and 
.0 99
Rdemand 
 for priming-reliability R . 
Failures may be caused by random errors in the 
manufacturing process or by aging during stockpile. 
Available system-level test data are of stock time for 0 year, 
3 years, 5 years and 10 years. Test data are unavailable for 
the products that are stocked for more than 10 years. The 
energetic-material is designed to be replaced every 5 years 
for its severe aging rate. We must decide on the proposition 
that both R  and Y  are greater than their lowest demands 
when the product sits in the stockpile for 15 years.  
The priming-reliability R  is obtained as follows

The epistemic uncertainties can be classified as "known 
unknowns" and "unknown unknowns", and the requirement 
to execute the decision making is no "unknown unknowns" 
existing in M&S. Although the material behaviors in the 
products stocked 15 years have a further change compared to 
that stocked less than or equal to 10 years, it can not bring 
essential changes in the detonation process and there is no 
"unknown unknowns" in M&S. So it is feasible to assess the 
reliability for the stock time of 15 years by M&S. 
III. 
PREDICTION BY MODELLING & SIMULATIONS 
M&S was first calibrated using the available test data, 
from which the computing parameters and the physics 
models including aging models of materials are determined. 
Then, in keeping with 0 year stock time and the medium 
values of machining tolerances, we have built a baseline 
entity model, for which we get the average values via M&S

QUANTIFICATION OF UNCERTAINTIES 
We have some repeated test data for each stock time such 
as 0 year, 3 years, 5 years, and 10 years. According to the

Through optimal square approximations, we have got the

such as

CONCLUSION 
The QMU methods proposed here fit engineering systems 
in which aleatory and epistemic uncertainties might coexist. 
Supported by the new methods of UQ for M&S prediction, 
reliability assessment with unified criterion could be fulfilled 
based on M&S even when the new system-level test is 
unavailable. These methods have already been applied in some 
engineering systems.
