Abstract—The goal of this study is to determine factors 
influencing the adoption of RFID and its effects on 
organizational performance. In the research model used in this 
study, factors influencing the adoption of RFID were examined 
under a TOE (Technology, Organization, Environment) 
framework, with a series of hypotheses set up accordingly, and 
organizational performance was measured using a BSC 
(Balanced 
Scorecard). 
The 
data 
were 
collected 
from 
organizations currently using RFID, and the research model 
and hypotheses were tested through structural equation 
modeling. The analysis showed that technology competence, 
technology compatibility, top management support, RFID 
related cost, competitive pressure, and government support 
had an influence on the adoption of RFID, and the adoption of 
it impacted on organizational performance. And policy 
implications were derived from the results and strategies for 
stimulating demand for RFID.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Counted among the top 10 technologies of the 21st 
century [1], RFID is a highly promising technology used in 
a wide-ranging area, from distribution and logistics to 
manufacturing, transportation and defense. RFID is a non-
contact sensor technology using RF signals. A RFID system 
is composed of a tag with an integrated chip and antenna 
and a reader for the processing and transmission of stored 
data [2]. The global RFID market, estimated at US$ 5.6 
billion in 2010, is expected to grow to US$ 24.1 billion in 
2021. By region, the RFID market is predicted to reach the 
largest size in East Asia, in part on the back of a lively 
growth in the Chinese market [3]. 
RFID is one of the technology policy focuses in major 
countries around the world where it is perceived as a next-
generation engine for future economic growth, and related 
R&D is actively underway. In the US, R&D activities in 
RFID are led by the NITRD (Networking and Information 
Technology R&D) program. The diffusion of RFID is 
steadily widening, thanks, in part, to the rule making its use 
mandatory in key government agencies, including the 
Department of Defense, FDA and the Department of 
Homeland Security. In Europe, the use of RFID is actively 
encouraged as part of the effort to build an intelligent 
society. RFID is currently piloted in various fields, in 
Europe, 
including 
distribution 
and 
logistics, 
and 
manufacturing. In Japan, its Ministry of Economy, Trade 
and Industry started a RFID project, called the ―5-yen Tag‖ 
project, in 2006. The Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs 
and Communications, meanwhile, is carrying out projects to 
build infrastructure necessary for the broad use of RFID tags. 
In China, RFID has been selected as one of the key 
technology tasks for the 11th 5-year plan by its government, 
and the government is providing extensive support for 
fostering this industry. Efforts are also underway in China, 
to establish RFID-related standards [4]. In Korea, RFID has 
been included in ‗new IT,‘ one of the six fields selected as 
the next-generation engines for economic growth (which 
otherwise include energy/environmental technology, IT-
based new converged industries, bio-industry, transportation 
systems and knowledge services) [4]. 
RFID is increasingly receiving attention from the 
research community as well, in recent years, with research 
being actively conducted especially on adoption behavior. 
However, most studies remain attempts to identifying 
factors influencing the adoption of RFID by certain 
organizations, and not its massive take-up or the industry-
wide level of adoption. Creating a large enough demand is, 
needless to say, a vital requirement for the viable growth of 
the RFID industry. Meanwhile, it is also important to 
understand, for the long-term prospect of the RFID industry, 
whether and to what extent the adoption of RFID directly 
influences 
organizational 
performance. 
This 
study 
distinguishes itself from previous research on the adoption 
of RFID in that it is an empirical attempt to 
comprehensively investigate whether its adoption has a 
direct impact on organizational performance. The goal of 
this study is, therefore, to determine factors influencing the 
adoption of RFID by organizations and how its adoption 
influences organizational performance so as to develop 
strategies for stimulating demand for this technology. 
This paper is organized as follows. First, in introduction, 
background, necessity, and objectives were described. 
Secondly, in literature review, the factors influencing the 
adoption of RFID were examined through existing 
literatures by means of a TOE framework. In addition, BSC 
methodology was considered to measure organizational 
performance. Thirdly, on the basis of existing literatures, 
research model and hypotheses were set up. Fourthly, 
76

research model and hypotheses were tested with structural 
equation modeling. Finally, implications were derived from 
the analysis, and significance and research direction in the 
future were presented. 
II. 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
A. TOE  Framework 
In this study, we explore factors influencing the adoption 
of RFID using the well-known TOE (Technology, 
Organization, 
Environment) 
framework. 
The 
TOE 
framework has been widely used to determine factors 
influencing the adoption of a new technology or system from 
a technological, organization and environmental perspective. 
Noteworthy studies conducted using the TOE framework 
include Kuan & Chau [5], investigating influence factors for 
the adoption of electronic data interchange (EDI), and Xu et 
al. [6] and Zhu et al. [7]-[9], determining factors influencing 
the adoption of e-business. Joo & Kim [10] used the TOE 
framework to discover influence factors for the adoption of 
e-marketplace, and Soares-Aguiar & Palma-dos-Reis [11], to 
discover determinants of the adoption of e-procurement 
systems. Finally Wang et al. [12] explored determinants of 
the adoption of RFID, utilizing the TOE framework. 
B. Balanced Scorecard(BSC) 
The Balanced Scorecard (BSC), proposed by Kaplan & 
Norton 
[13]-[15], 
is 
a 
technique 
for 
measuring 
organizational performance. Under this technique, the 
performance of an organization is not just measured through 
financial indicators, but is comprehensively evaluated by 
looking also at non-financial aspects; hence, a balanced 
measurement method. Aside from general organizational 
performance, The BSC is also frequently utilized to measure 
the effects of the introduction of a new system or 
information technology on organizational performance. The 
BSC considers four perspectives, namely, financial, internal 
business process, learning and growth, and customer that are 
derived from an organization‘s vision and strategy.  
    Examples of studies using the BSC for measuring 
organizational performance are numerous and are from 
widely-varying research fields. Papalexandris et al. [16], for 
instance, measured performance among Greek software 
companies, using the four perspectives from the original 
BSC proposed by Kaplan & Norton, unmodified. As for 
Michalska [17], he used the BSC in this measurement of 
corporate performance in the Polish metallurgic industry, 
but replaced the learning and growth perspective, one of the 
original four perspectives, with the development perspective, 
and derived appropriate performance indicators for the 
readapted perspectives. Gumbus & Lyons [18] measured the 
performance of Philips, employing a BSC comprising the 
financial, process, customer and the capacity perspective.  
Olson and Slater [19], in their measurement of 
performance among service and manufacturing companies, 
used a BSC framework consisting in the customer, internal 
business process, innovation and growth, and the financial 
perspective. Chand et al. [20], meanwhile, analyzed the 
effects of the introduction of an ERP system on 
organizational performance, employing a BSC framework 
consisting of a process, customer, financial, and a learning 
and innovation perspective. Bhagwat & Sharma [21] 
investigated the impact of supply chain management on 
organizational performance, using a BSC framework 
comprising a financial, customer, internal business and an 
innovation and learning perspective. As for Fang & Lin [22], 
they used a financial, customer, internal, and an innovation 
and learning perspective to analyze how the introduction of 
an ERP system affected organizational performance. 
III. 
RESEARCH MODEL AND HYPOTHESES 
The research model for determining factors influencing 
the adoption of RFID under the TOE framework and 
measuring the effects of the adoption of RFID on 
organizational performance was designed, as shown in 
(Figure 1). In this study, we assumed that technology factors 
such as technology competence, technology compatibility 
and technology complexity; organizational factors such as 
support from company leadership, the size of organization 
and the cost of implementing a RFID system; and 
environmental factors such as competitive pressure and 
government support influence the adoption of RFID. We, 
further, assumed that the adoption of RFID will have an 
influence on organizational performance.  
 
 
Figure 1. Research model  
 
Concerning technology factors influencing the adoption 
of a new technology by organizations, quite an important 
number of previous studies suggested that technological 
competence, technological compatibility and technological 
complexity were among the key factors. Kuan & Chau [5] 
empirically 
confirmed 
the 
impact 
of 
technological 
competence on the adoption of EDI (Electronic Data 
Interchange), and Xu et al. [6] and Zhu et al. [7] reported 
that technological competence was a critical influence factor 
for the adoption of e-business. Kim & Garrison [23] found 
that technological knowledge was positively associated with 
the adoption of RFID for supply chain management. 
Ramamutrthy et al. [24], meanwhile, reported that the 
adoption of EDI was positively influenced by technological 
compatibility. Chang et al. [25] and Tsai et al. [26] 
confirmed through empirical data that technological 
77

complexity was a major influence factor which inhibited the 
adoption of RFID. Brown & Russell [27] and Wang et al. 
[12] found that both technological compatibility and 
complexity importantly influenced the adoption of RFID. 
Drawing on findings from these previous studies, we set up 
the following three hypotheses on the relationship between 
technology factors and the adoption of RFID: 
 
H1. The technology competence has a positive effect on 
RFID adoption 
H2. The technology compatibility has a positive effect on 
RFID adoption 
H3. The technology complexity has a negative effect on 
RFID adoption 
 
Several studies have reported that organizational factors 
such as support from company leadership, the size of 
organization and the cost of implementation were critical 
factors influencing the adoption of a new technology. Huang 
et al. [28], in an empirical study on internet-based EDI, 
found that the adoption of EDI was positively associated 
with support from company leadership. Joo & Kim [29] 
stated that the size of an organization was a major influence 
factor on the adoption of e-marketplace, while AL-Qirim 
[30] found a positive association between the size of an 
organization and the adoption of e-commerce. Wang et al. 
[12] reported, in their empirical study, that the size of an 
organization had a positive influence on the adoption of 
RFID. Wymer & Regan [31] suggested that costs played an 
important role in the adoption of e-commerce. This view 
was corroborated by Kim & Garrison [23] who also found 
that financial resources had a measurable influence on the 
adoption of e-commerce. Brown & Russell [27] reported 
that the attitude of the management and the size of an 
organization had a positive impact on the adoption of RFID, 
and the cost of implementation, a negative impact. Drawing 
on the existing literature, discussed above, we formulated 
the following two hypotheses on the relationship between 
organizational factors and the adoption of RFID: 
 
H4. The top management support has a positive effect on 
RFID adoption 
H5. The organizational size has a positive effect on RFID 
adoption 
H6. The RFID related costs have a negative effect on 
RFID adoption 
 
A large number of previous studies showed that 
environmental factors such as competitive pressure and 
government support had an influence on the adoption of a 
new technology. Huang et al. [28] suggested that 
competitive pressure had a positive impact on the adoption 
of EDI, and Zhu et al. [7] found that it was positively 
associated with the adoption of e-business. Wang et al. [12] 
and Brown & Russell [27] stated that competitive pressure 
was a critical influence factor for the adoption of RFID. Xu 
et al. [6], meanwhile, advanced that government support in 
the form of incentive or legal and regulatory support 
positively influenced companies‘ adoption of e-business. 
According to Chang et al. [32], government support would 
also have an important influence on the adoption of 
electronic sign-off. In this study, we, therefore, set up the 
following two hypotheses on the relationship between 
government support and the adoption of RFID: 
 
H7. The competitive pressure has a positive effect on 
RFID adoption 
H8. The government support has a positive effect on RFID 
adoption 
 
 That organizational performance is positively affected by 
the adoption of new technologies is a well-known fact. Fang 
[33] and Fang et al. [34] empirically established that 
corporate performance is influenced by the adoption of e-
business. Chang & Wong [35], meanwhile, showed how the 
adoption of e-procurement and e-marketplace had an impact 
on corporate performance. In this study, the influence of the 
adoption of RFID on organizational performance is 
measured using a BSC framework, as has been said earlier. 
Improvements in organization performance under the effect 
of the adoption of RFID will be, therefore, measured from 
four perspectives, including learning and growth, internal 
process, customer and financial. We, therefore, set up the 
following four hypotheses on the relationship between the 
adoption of RFID and each of the four BSC perspectives: 
 
H9. The RFID adoption has a positive effect on 
performance of learning and growth 
H10. RFID adoption has a positive effect on performance 
of internal process 
H11. The RFID adoption has a positive effect on 
performance of customer 
H12. The RFID adoption has a positive effect on 
performance of finance

METHODOLOGY 
C. Factors and Data Collection 
To identify factors influencing the adoption of RFID and 
understand whether and to what extend the use of RFID 
affects organizational performance, we developed a series of 
measurement items, drawing on the existing literature, as 
shown in Table 1. All items were measured using a 7-point 
likert scale.  
The data were collected through direct interview of 
companies currently using RFID by contacting them by 
phone or through email. Of 130 total responses returned, 
103 were retained for analysis, after discarding random or 
otherwise invalid responses. The demographics of the 
sample were as follows (see Table 2). An overwhelming 
majority of 82.5% of respondents were men, and people in 
their 30s represented 50.5%.

largest share of 41.8%. As for three-year average sales, the 
greatest number of companies declined to answer this 
question, but among those providing an answer, 100 billion 
won to 500 billion won represented the largest share of

D. Structural Equation Modeling 
In this study, the research model is tested against the 
data using structural equation modeling. Structural equation 
modeling is a technique widely used for evaluating causal 
relationships between constructs. For the purpose of this 
study, we used PLS (Partial Least Squares) based structural 
equation modeling, which helps minimize endogenous 
variable errors and provides a greater level of explanatory 
power.  
The reliability of constructs, when using PLS analytical 
tools, is determined by the value of internal consistency (IC) 
between the constructs. As a general rule, a value of 0.7 or 
greater indicates the existence of reliability [36][37]: 
The validity of constructs is judged based on the value of 
their AVE (Average Variance Extracted. When the AVE is 
0.5 or greater, this is considered an indication of the 
existence of convergent validity. Meanwhile, when the 
square root of the AVE is larger than the correlation 
coefficient between each of the factors, this is considered to 
indicate the existence of discriminatory validity [36][38].

RESULTS 
The reliability analysis performed on the factors used in 
this study revealed that the IC value was greater than the 
threshold of 0.7 for all factors, suggesting a good level of 
reliability. The AVE also proved to exceed the threshold 
value of 0.5 for all factors, attesting to their convergent 
validity. 
All 
factors 
were 
tested 
satisfactorily 
for 
discriminant validity as well.  
When the research model was tested using the structural 
equation modeling technique, all hypotheses, except H3, H5 
and H12, were accepted (see Figure 2). Among the 
technology factors, technology competence and technology 
compatibility proved to have a strong influence on the 
adoption of RFID. Technology complexity, on the other 
hand, showed no significant influence on the adoption of 
RFID. What these results point to is the importance of 
organizational capacities such as knowledge about RFID 
and infrastructure necessary for the deployment of RFID for 
an organization‘s adoption of RFID. The results also 
confirm that whether RFID is compatible with an 
organization‘s strategy or the situation it is currently facing 
and whether it is compatible with tasks routinely carried out 
in an organization are important determinants of its adoption.  
Among organizational factors, analysis revealed that the 
adoption of RFID was measurably influenced by support 
from company leadership and the cost of implanting and 
using RFID. The results indicated, meanwhile, that the size 
of an organization had no real influence on the adoption of 
RFID. These results, therefore, attest to the importance of 
interest and awareness at the level of leadership within a 
company for its adoption of RFID. Also, the higher the cost 
of implementing RFID, the lower the probability of an 
organization‘s adoption of RFID proved to be. Hence, to 
broaden the adoption of RFID, it is necessary to find ways 
of reducing the cost of introducing RFID. 
 
 
 
Among environmental factors, the results confirmed that 
the adoption of RFID was affected by competitive pressure 
and government support. What this says is that the higher 
the level of adoption of RFID among competitors in the 
same business sector, the more willing a company is to 
adopt RFID in its turn.  Equally important is government 
support, in the form of a tax break or legal and regulatory 
improvement to incline a company toward the adoption of 
RFID. 
The results of analyzing causal relationships between the 
adoption of RFID and organizational performance showed 
that learning and growth, internal process and customer 
performance were strongly affected by the adoption of 
RFID. Meanwhile, the adoption of RFID did not appear to 
influence the financial performance of a company. The 
results, therefore, point to important contributions by RFID 
to corporate performance, in terms of learning and growth, 
internal process and customer performance. But, the use of 
RFID is yet to produce an impact on the financial 
performance of companies. The detailed results of 
hypothesis testing are given in Table 4.

CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS 
This study has been an empirical attempt to understand 
technology, organizational and environmental factors 
influencing the adoption of RFID and measure its effects on 
organizational performance of companies. From the results 
obtained in this study, we derived the following policy and 
practical implications for stimulating demand for RFID and 
accelerating its diffusion:  
First, there is a need for policy-level support for the 
technology factors that were found to influence the adoption 
of RFID. For example, education and training programs to 
help companies improve their understanding of, and 
proficiency with, RFID could be very useful.  Also useful 
would be an onsite technical consulting program to assist 
companies in determining whether RFID is compatible with 
their existing systems and tasks they carry out routinely.  
Second, this study found that support from company 
leadership positively influences the adoption of RFID. 
Therefore, programs to kindle interest in RFID among 
corporate executives could effectively help promote its 
adoption. Programs for sharing cases of successful 
implementation and use of RFID and concrete examples of 
benefits resulting from the use of RFID with CEOs would 
be particularly useful for raising interest in this technology 
and encouraging companies to adopt it.  
Third, as emerged from this study, the high cost of 
setting up a RFID system is a factor making companies 
hesitant about its adoption. Hence, financial support from 
the government to assist with initial costs associated with 
setting up a RFID system could help toward an early 
adoption of this technology by companies. SMEs in strong 
need of RFID, but hesitant about actually introducing it due 
to financial burden could particularly benefit from such 
support.  
Fourth, our study found that external environmental 
factors such as competitive pressure from within their own 
business sector and government support played a critical 
role in their decision to adopt RFID. It may, therefore, be 
useful to publicize sector-specific cases of successful 
implementation and use of RFID and details of benefits 
gained from RFID to kindle interest in this technology. Tax 
breaks and other forms of incentive for companies 
introducing RFID will be also effective means for 
encouraging its adoption, along with legislative and 
regulatory improvement to facilitate the process.  
Fifth, concerning the effects of the adoption of RFID on 
organizational 
performance, 
its 
influence 
proved 
particularly strong on learning and growth, internal process 
and customer performance. These are positive findings 
about the beneficial effects of RFID on organizational 
performance. However, we found no concrete effect of 
RFID on financial performance. This, therefore, points to a 
need for further efforts to improve the performance-effects 
of this technology so that its use can also enhance the 
financial performance of companies.  
This study is significant in that it proposes strategies for 
promoting and accelerating the adoption of RFID by 
companies, based on the analysis of influence factors for its 
adoption and the effects of its use on organizational 
performance. Future research can improve on this study by 
developing an objective model for directly evaluating the 
performance-enhancing effects of RFID and by presenting 
strategies for promoting its adoption based on concrete 
performance data. This study found that the use of RFID is 
yet to produce a measurable effect on the financial 
performance of companies. Future research, therefore, also 
needs to investigate factors that can directly influence 
financial performance.
