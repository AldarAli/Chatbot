Abstract—The gaming industry is one of the most influ-
ential in the world and attracts a wide variety of audiences.
However, game development can be a time-consuming
effort. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce this development
time. Software Reuse Techniques have demonstrated their
capacity to reduce game development time and costs.
One of the main approaches used in reuse is Software
Product Line (SPL), which has been successfully adopted
by different companies for the purpose of generating
software on a large scale. In light of this, the purpose
of this paper is to provide an overview of what it would
be like to use SPL for support in game development.
Index Terms—Game, Mods, Derivation, Variations, Soft-
ware Reuse.
I. INTRODUCTION
Games have emerged as a highly prevalent mode of enter-
tainment, attracting fans of diverse preferences and generating
substantial revenue in a period of several years [1]. The
game development process, despite its huge fan community,
has demonstrated an exhaustive and non-systematized process,
resulting in prolonged release timelines for certain games [2].
The practice of Software Reuse has been widely employed
in the industry as a means to mitigate development time and
costs. Various ways have been adopted, ranging from oppor-
tunistic reuse to the implementation of a Software Product
Line (SPL) procedure [3]. SPL is the focus of this work.
Given the aforementioned discussion, the objective of this
study is to present a preliminary concept of utilizing SPL for
game building, with the aim of mitigating the time and costs
resources required in the existing procedure.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section
2, a brief contextualization of the problem related to the
concept introduced in this study is provided. In Section 3,
the suggestion for solving the situation at topic is presented,
while Session 4 provides the final conclusions of this study.
II. CONTEXTUALIZATION
As previously mentioned, the gaming industry has expe-
rienced significant growth in recent years, accumulating a
substantial and dedicated community. Considering the fact that
the process of game production remains expensive, character-
ized by substantial costs and lengthy development periods,
certain enthusiasts exhibit impatience towards the release of
the games, encouraging them in the creation of their own
versions of those games. The phenomenon of game creation by
the community is commonly referred to as modding. It can be
conceptualized as a manifestation of players’ artistic freedom
in remaking and reinterpreting the original game, comparable
to the opportunistic reuse process [4]. In this context, the
original game serves as a structure upon which a new game
is constructed.
The main goal of the SPL method is to create new products
by using the “variation points” present in an SPL of the
original product [3]. For instance, consider a software X with
Y characteristics. These characteristics can be altered, elimi-
nated, or expanded by introducing new features. Consequently,
this process results in the creation of new products with Y+1
characteristics, imagining that we were adding a new feature
to the software.
However, the process of building mods, like the process of
building games, has some issues, with a focus on:
• The lack of specific tools for mods;
• The fact that building a mod can be time-consuming
despite being faster than building a game;
• Making the source code available to be modified.
Specifically, the latter issue has already been addressed by
major companies, who have made Software Development Kits
(SDKs) accessible to users for modifying the original games
[5, 6]. This enables users to make alterations to characters,
maps, and incorporate minor modifications. Nevertheless, the
availability of such services is limited to certain companies,
and it should be noted that the scope of modifications that
can be made is restricted, limited to certain mechanics and
aesthetics of the game.
III. ENGAGESPL
This study proposes the creation of a platform that incor-
porates SPL concepts in order to address the issues identified
in the development of mods and games, as previously exam-
ined. The primary objective of the platform is to facilitate
the effective development of several versions of a game by
streamlining the process and minimizing complications. This
helps with large-scale game development.
The primary concept underlying the platform involves orga-
nizing the game’s characteristics into a hierarchical structure,
called feature tree. This arrangement simplifies the process
of selecting, modifying, adding, or removing these aspects.
The platform was designated as ENgine for GAme GEneration
through Software Product Line (EngageSPL).

The primary objective of EngageSPL is to offer a compre-
hensive range of tools that facilitate the expansion of gaming.
The platform is designed to enable the creation of a game with
the ability to subsequently generate multiple video games with
distinct characteristics by leveraging variation points within
the functionality tree. Initially, it was thought that the platform
could have 3 feature trees based on elements of tTtrad [7]
framework, each of which will be highlighted below.
The elemental tTtrad is a widely recognized paradigm
within the game industry. The properties of games are cat-
egorized into four distinct groups [8], however, in this work
only 2 will be highlighted (Mechanics and Aesthetics).
• Mechanics: can be interpreted as the rules and activities
that may occur during the course of the game.
• Second level mechanics: while the tTtrad elements do
not include the second level mechanics, this study will
incorporate them to elucidate the mechanics that arise
from the combination of primary mechanics. The incor-
poration of this element will be implemented to augment
the level of dynamism inside the proposed adjustments
for the advancement of the games.
• Aesthetics: Can be defined as the graphical part of the
game.
Consequently, there will be three trees: one for the mecha-
nisms of the first level, one for the second, and a third tree for
selecting the game’s aesthetics. Initially, the technology and
story elements of the tTtrad were eliminated from the work.
The first is due to the ease of building for multiple platforms
using current engines, and the second is due to the difficulty
of implementing the game context to dynamically generate the

narrative.
Figure 1 depicts the three trees that correspond to each
component of the previously specified elementary tTtrad. This
figure demonstrates the integration of a new mechanic into
the hierarchical structure of the tree, with the alteration of
some mechanisms at the second level. Ultimately, there exists
the potential to visually represent the alteration of an aesthetic
entity. Hence, the user has the ability to choose desired charac-
teristics and determine the manner in which modifications are
implemented to the existing features inside the game through
the utilization of this tree structure.
IV. CONCLUSION
The gaming industry is seeing substantial growth, with
gaming businesses expanding in scale and generating billions
of dollars in annual revenue. These companies are consistently
publishing a considerable number of titles across many genres,
drawing a diverse range of fans. Nevertheless, as commented
before, the process of game development can be a time-
consuming endeavor that may span several years until its
finalization. In contrast, the gaming community is experiencing
continuous growth on a daily basis. Given the extensive user
base, certain individuals within the community may express
concerns or dissatisfaction regarding the prolonged waiting
period for the commencement of a game.
