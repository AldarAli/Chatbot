Abstract—The main subject of the current paper is the 
modelling of mechanical properties of carbon steels at a 
temperature which exceeds the typical hot rolling temperature 
range as well as a new methodology of such investigation was 
developed. The method requires high accuracy model of semi-
solid steel deformation. Hence, it requires a dedicated hybrid 
analytical-numerical model of deformation of steel with 
variable density. The newly developed methodology allows to 
compute curves depending on both temperature and strain 
rate. In aim to verify the new modified methodology, a number 
of experimental tests using Gleeble 3800 thermo-mechanical 
simulator were done. The comparison between numerical and 
experimental results are presented in the first part of the 
paper. The developed methodology allows reliable numerical 
simulation of deformation of semi-solid steel samples and 
calculation of realistic flow curve parameters. In the second 
part of the paper, the newest results of mechanical properties 
prediction of 11SMn30 grade steel as well as an example 
numerical and experimental results are presented.

 INTRODUCTION 
Due to the global energy crisis in recent years, more and 
more 
new 
production 
technologies 
require 
energy 
preservation and environmental protection. The integrated 
casting and rolling technologies are newest efficient and 
very profitable ways of hot strip production. Only few 
companies all over the world are able to manage such 
processes. The technical staff of a plant located in Cremona, 
Italy is working on new methods of flat steel manufacturing 
for several years now. The ISP (Inline Strip Production) and 
AST (Arvedi Steel Technologies) technologies, which are 
developed in Cremona, are distinguished by very high 
rolling temperature. The main benefits of both methods are 
related to very low rolling forces and favourable field of 
temperature. However, certain problems particular to such 
metal treatment arise. The central parts of slabs are mushy 
and the solidification is not yet finished while the 
deformation is in progress. This results in changes in 
material 
density 
and 
occurrence 
of 
characteristic 
temperatures having great influence on the plastic behaviour 
of the material [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]. The nil strength 
temperature (NST), strength recovery temperature (SRT), 
nil ductility temperature (NDT) and ductility recovery 
temperature (DRT) have effect on steel plastic behaviour 
and limit plastic deformation [5]. The nil strength 
temperature (NST) is the temperature level at which 
material strength drops to zero, while the steel is being 
heated above the solidus temperature. Another temperature 
associated with NST is the strength recovery temperature 
(SRT). At this temperature the cooled material regains 
strength greater than 0.5 N/mm2. Nil ductility temperature 
(NDT) represents the temperature at which the heated steel 
loses its ductility. The ductility recovery temperature (DRT) 
is the temperature at which the ductility of the material 
(characterised by reduction of area) reaches 5% while it is 
being cooled. Over this temperature, the plastic deformation 
is not allowed at any stress tensor configuration. 
 The most important steel property having crucial 
influence on metal flow paths is the yield stress. In the 
literature of the past years, one can find papers regarding 
experimental results [6] and modelling [7] of non-ferrous 
metals. Both the mentioned contributions focus mainly on 
tixotrophy. Thixoforming process is one member of a 
family of semi-solid forming processes and it possesses 
characteristics of both casting and forging. The first results 
regarding steel deformation at extra high temperature were 
only presented in the past few years [8]. This stems from the 
fact that level of liquidus and solidus temperatures of steel is 
very high in comparison with non-ferrous metals. It causes 
serious experimental problems contrary to deformation tests 
for non-ferrous metals which are much easier. Rising 
abilities of thermo-mechanical simulators such as the 
Gleeble 3800 and development of new methods of 
identification of mechanical properties allow investigations 
leading to strain-stress relationships for semi-solid steels, as 
well. This problem became a subject of research done by 
authors of the presented paper for several years now. As a 
result a computer system supporting the investigation of 
mushy steel has been developed. The current paper presents 
the modified methodology, which allows the calculation of

the real stress-strain relationships for a wide range of 
temperatures and strain rate. In Section II, the modified 
methodology of stress-strain curves is described. Section III 
presents a mathematical model, while Section IV presents 
experimental verification of the developed methodology. In 
Section V, the newest results of strain-stress prediction for 
simulations of rolling process are presented. Finally, in the 
last section, the main conclusions and future work are 
shortly described. 
II. 
THE NEW METHODOLOGY 
The old version of steel examination methodology, de-
noted as variant no. 1, was based on both tension and 
compression tests [12] [13]. The temperature range was 
divided into two sub-ranges: lower – below NDT – and 
higher – above this temperature. The usual experimental 
procedure based on tensile tests, which is valid for cold and 
low-level hot deformation was applied for the lower 
temperature range. The resulting yield curves were 
described by modified Voce formula using approximation of 
experimental data [11].  
A special technique of testing was developed for 
temperatures higher than NDT due to several serious 
experimental problems. The deformation process has been 
divided into two main stages. The first one – a very small 
preliminary compression and the second one – the ultimate 
compression. The preliminary deformation was designed to 
eliminate clearances in the testing equipment. The 
coefficients of the Voce formula were calculated using 
inverse solutions. This was the only acceptable method due 
to strong strain inhomogeneity of semi-sold steel. This 
approach allowed to compute strain-stress curves depending 
on only one additional parameter – the temperature. The 
newly developed methodology (denoted as variant no. 2) 
allows the computation of curves depending on both 
temperature and strain rate.  The tension tests has been 
replaced by compression ones and the Voce formula was 
replaced by more adequate equation. Contrary to the old 
version of the method the newly developed one allows the 
computation of curves depending on both temperature and 
strain rate. Figure 1 schematically presents the modified 
methodology. More details concerning the experimental 
work were published in  [14]. The presented approach 
allows to compute realistic yield stress curves depending on 
strain, temperature and strain rate in temperature range from 
1200oC to NDT and above. The objective function of the 
inverse analysis was defined as a square root error of 
discrepancies between calculated (Fc) and measured (Fm) 
loads at several subsequent steps of the compression process. 
The experimental values of the deformation forces were 
collected by the Gleeble 3800 equipment while the 
theoretical ones (Fc) were calculated with the help of a 
sophisticated solver facilitating accurate computation of 
strain, stress and temperature fields for materials with 
variable density.

This solver is the least visible but the most powerful part 
of the computer aided testing system developed by the 
authors called Def_Semi_Solid. The heart of the solver is 
based on a hybrid analytical-numerical mushy steel 
deformation model described in the next section. The 
Def_Semi_Solid solver  was included into Extra-High 
Temperature Solutions Platform (EHTS Platform) in order to 
support modelling of plastic deformation of materials at very 
high temperature levels (Figure 2). The solutions platform 
consists of two independent tools: Def_Semi_Solid v.5.0 – 
complete 2D modelling toolset dedicated for Gleeble® 3800 
thermo-mechanical 
simulator 
with 
integrated 
Pre&Postprocessor and DEFFEM 3D – vertical application 
toolset including three modules: DEFFEM solver (still in 
development) full three dimensional multiscale thermo-
mechanical solver for new methodology purposes, DEFFEM 
inverse and DEFFEM pre&postprocessor. The last two 
modules were tested in real industrial tests during modelling 
of TIG welding process of Inconel super alloy and stamping 
processes. Those modules supported of boundary condition 
identification as well as strain-stress curves based on 
industrial results. More details concerning modelling of 
mentioned processes with DEFFEM inverse module support 
can be found in [9] [10] [15].

Rigid-plastic model was selected due to its very good 
accuracy at the strain field during the hot deformation and 
sufficient correctness of calculated deviatoric part of the 
stress field. Moreover, the elastic part of each stress tensor 
component is very low at temperatures close to solidus line 
and can in practice be neglected in calculations of strain 
distribution. The limits for plastic metal behaviour are 
defined according to Huber-Mises-Hencky yield criterion:

In cylindrical coordinate system  the solution is a 
vector velocity field defined by the distribution of three 
coordinates  = 
, 
, 
 . The field is a result of 
optimization of a power functional, which can be written in 
general form as the sum of power necessary to run the main 
physical phenomena related to plastic deformation. Due to 
the axial-symmetry of the sample the circumferential 
component of the velocity field can be neglected and the 
functional is usually formulated as: 
 
 =  = 	 +  
 +  
(4) 
 
Component 	  occurring in (4) represents the plastic 
deformation power,  
 is the power which is a penalty for 
the departure from mass conservation condition,  denotes 
the friction power and  = 
, 
 describes the reduced 
velocity field distribution.  
Rigid-plastic formulation of metal deformation problem 
requires the condition of mass conservation in the 
deformation zone. In case of solids and liquids with a 
constant density, this condition can be simplified to the 
incompressibility condition. Such a condition is generally 
satisfied with sufficient accuracy during the optimization of 
functional (4). In most solutions a slight, but noticeable loss 
of volume is observed. The loss  occurs because the 
incompressibility condition imposed on the solution is not 
completely satisfied in numerical form. It is negligible in 
case of traditional computer simulation of deformation 
processes although in some embodiments more accurate 
methods are used to restore the volume of metal subjected to 
the deformation. In contrast, in the presented case the density 
of semi-solid materials varies during the deformation process 
and these changes result in a physically significant change in 
the volume of a body having constant mass. The size of the 
volume loss due to numerical errors is comparable with 
changes caused by fluctuation in the density of the material. 
A further problem specific to the variable density 
continuum is power  
, which occurs in functional (4). It is 
used in most solutions and has a significant share of total 
power. Even when the iterative process approaches the end, 
this power component is still significant, especially if the 
convergence of the optimization procedures is insufficient. In 
case of discretization of the deformation area (e.g., using the 
finite element method) if one focuses solely on the  
 a 
number of possible locally optimal solutions appear. They 
are related to a number of possible directions of movement 
of discretization nodes providing the volume preservation of 
the deformation zone. Each of these solutions creates a local 
optimum for  
 power and thus for the entire functional (4). 
This makes it difficult to optimize because of lack of uniform 
direction of fall of total power which leads to global 
optimum. The material density fluctuation causes further 
optimization 
difficulties, 
resulting 
from 
additional 
replacement of incompressibility condition with a full 
condition of mass conservation. 
The proposed solution requires high accuracy in ensuring 
the incompressibility condition for the solid material or mass 
conservation condition for the semi-solid areas. This stems 
from the fact that the errors resulting from the breach of 
these conditions can be treated as a volume change caused 
by the steel density variation in the semi-solid zone. High 
accuracy solution is required also due to large differences in 
yield stress for the individual subareas of the deformation 
zone. In the discussed temperature range they appear due to 
even slight fluctuations in temperature. In presented solution 
the second component of functional (4) is left out and mass 
conservation condition is given in analytical form 
constraining the radial (
) and longitudinal (
) velocity 
field components. The functional takes the following shape: 
 
 = 	 +   
(5) 
 
In case of functional (5), the numerical optimisation 
procedure converges faster than the one for functional (4) 
due to the reduced number of velocity field parameters (only 
radial components are optimisation parameters) and the lack 
of numerical form of mass conservation condition. The 
accuracy of the proposed hybrid solution is higher also due 
to negligible volume loss caused by numerical errors, which 
is very important for materials with variable density. 
As mentioned before, the solution of the problem is a 
velocity field in cylindrical coordinate system in axial-
symmetrical state of deformation. Optimization of metal 
flow velocity field in the deformation zone of semi-
variational problem requires the formulation according to 
equation (5). The radial velocity distribution 
, ,  and 
the longitudinal one 
, ,   are so complex that such 
wording in the global coordinate system poses considerable 
difficulties. These difficulties are the result of the mutual 
dependence of these velocities. Therefore, the basic 
formulation will be written for the local cylindrical 
coordinate system   with a view to the future 
discretization of deformation area using one of the dedicated 
methods. In addition, one will find that the deformation of

cylindrical samples is characterized by axial symmetry. As 
demonstrated by experimental studies conducted using semi-
solid samples the symmetry may be disturbed only as a result 
of unexpected leakage of liquid phase [16]. 
Such experiments, however, are regarded as unsuccessful 
and not subject to numerical analysis. Establishment of the 
axial symmetry, with the exception of cases of physical 
instability can be considered valid also for the process of 
compression or tensile test of semi-solid samples, allows one 
to simplify the model because of the identical strain 
distribution at any axial sample cross-section. Therefore, 
considerations will be carried out in  coordinates for the 
sample cross-section using one of the planes containing the 
sample axis. Components of power functional given by (5) 
have been formulated in accordance with the general theory 
of plasticity by relevant equations. The plastic power for the 
deformation zone having volume of   is given by the 
subsequent relation: 
 
	 = 

 
(6) 
 
where  is the effective stress and   denotes the effective 
strain. The plastic deformation starts when the rising 
effective stress reaches yield stress limit    (  =  ) 
according to yield criterion given by equation (2). Effective 
strain occurring in (6) is calculated on the basis of the strain 
tensor components  according to following relationship: 
 
 = 2
3 
(7) 
 
The components are given by (3). The second component of 
functional (5) is responding for friction. To compute friction 
power on the boundary  of area  a model given by the 
subsequent equation was used: 
 
  =   
√3

‖‖ 
(8) 
In (8),  is the so called friction factor, which is usually 
experimentally selected and  is a relative velocity vector of 
metal and tool  =  −  . In case of tensile test, the 
samples are permanently fixed in jaws of a physical 
simulator and friction must not be taken into account. 
However, compression test requires sharing the friction 
power which is significant. 
For the solid zones the incompressibility condition can be 
described by universal operator equation independently of 
the mechanical state of the deformation process: 
 
∇ =  0 
(9) 
 
Because the semi-solid zone is characterized by density 
change due to still ongoing progress of steel solidification, 
the condition of incompressibility is inadequate to reflect 
changes and was replaced with the mass conservation 
condition, 
which 
describes 
the 
following 
modified 
operational equation: 
 
∇ − 1
 
! 
!" =  0 
(10) 
 
The basis for the optimization of functional (5) is the 
velocity field determined by appropriate system of velocity 
functions in the concerned area. These functions are then the 
source of deformation field and other physical quantities 
affecting the power functional formulation. Obtaining an 
accurate real velocity field requires the use of velocity 
functions depending on a number of variational parameters. 
The functions should be flexible enough to map the field 
throughout the whole volume of the deformation zone. 
Analytical description of each component of the velocity 
field with a single function in the whole area of deformation 
is not preferred. This approach creates difficulties especially 
in areas not subjected to the deformation where the velocity 
function should remain constant. Therefore, the solution to 
the problem of semi-solid metal flow was based on a specific 
method. 
In the case of deformation of axial-symmetrical bodies, 
the incompressibility condition is given by following 
differential equation: 
 
!

! + 

 + !

! = 0 
(11) 
For the semi-solid area, (11) is replaced by the mass 
conservation condition due to existing density changes. The 
longitudinal velocity has been calculated as an analytical 
function of radial velocity using this condition. In cylindrical 
coordinate system the condition has been described with an 
equation: 
 
!

Equation (11) is a special case of (12) and therefore the 
proposed solution will consider the dependence (12) as more 
general. In (12)   is the temporary material density and # is 
the time variable. The proposed variational formulation 
makes the longitudinal velocity dependent on the radial one. 
Condition (12) allows for the calculation of !

In this case, the velocity field depends only on one function – 
the radial velocity distribution. 
Heat exchange between solid metal and environment, and 
its flow inside the metal is controlled by a number of factors. 
During phase transformation two additional phenomena have 
to be taken into account. Note that in the process of 
deformation of steel at temperature of liquid to solid phase 
transformation there are two sources of heat changes.  On the 
one hand, heat is generated due to the state transformation. 
On the other hand, it is secreted as a result of plastic 
deformation. In addition, steel density variations also cause 
changes of  body temperature. 
Thermal solution has a major impact on simulation 
results, since the temperature has strong effect on remaining 
variables. This is especially evident if the specimen 
temperature is close to solidus line when the body consist of 
both solid and semi-solid regions. In such case, the affected 
phenomena are: plastic flow of solid and mushy materials, 
stress evolution and density changes. The theoretical 
temperature field is a solution of Fourier-Kirchhoff equation 
with appropriate boundary conditions [16]. 
The most general form of the Fourier-Kirchhoff equation 
in any coordinate system can be written in operator form as 
follows: 
 
$% $& + ' = ( ∇& + !&
!# 
(14) 
 
where &  is the temperature distribution in the controlled 
volume and % denotes the symmetrical second order tensor 
called heat transformation tensor. In case of thermal 
inhomogeneity, the whole tensor has to be considered. 
 ' represents the rate of heat generation (or consumption) 
due to the phase transformation, due to plastic work done 
and due to electric current flow (resistance heating of the 
sample is usually applied). Finally, ( describes the specific 
heat,   the steel density,  the velocity vector of specimen 
particles and # the elapsed time. 
For axial-symmetrical case, (14) can be simplified. The 
following form of Fourier-Kirchhoff equations for isotropic, 
axially-symmetric heat flow was applied in the presented 
solution:

Equation (15) needs to be solved with appropriate initial and 
boundary 
conditions. 
Combined 
Hankel’s 
boundary 
conditions have been adopted for the presented model.  
One of the most important parameters of the solution is 
the density. Its changes have influence on the mechanical 
part of the presented model. The knowledge of effective 
density distribution is very important for modelling the 
deformation of porous materials. Density changes of liquid, 
solid-liquid and solid materials are ruled over three 
phenomena: solid phase formation, laminar liquid flow 
through porous material and thermal shrinkage. Total 
density changes can be calculated according to following

It is good practice to test materials in isothermal conditions 
[11]. Unfortunately, this is not possible for semi-solid steel. 
Nevertheless, the condition should be as close to isothermal 
as possible due to the very high sensitivity of material 
rheology to even small variations of temperature. The basic 
reason for uneven temperature distribution inside the sample 
body on the Gleeble 3800 simulator is the contact with hot 
copper handles  presented in Figure 8.

Thermal solution of the theoretical model has crucial 
influence on simulation results, since the temperature has 
strong effect on remaining parameters. The resistance 
sample heating and contact of the sample with cold cooper 
handles cause non-uniform distribution of temperature 
inside heated material, especially along the sample. The 
semi-solid conditions in central parts of the sample cause 
even greater temperature gradient due to latent heat of 
transformation. Such non-uniform temperature distribution 
is the source of significant differences in the microstructure

The micro and macrostructure of the tested samples were 
investigated as well. Figure 13 shows microstructure right 
before deformation for both central and boundary regions of 
the heating zone. Microstructure of the cooled samples 
consists of pearlite (the darkest phase), bainite (grey phase 
mainly near the borders of grains) and the bright ferrite. 
This is a result of  phase composition, wide melting zone 
and almost two times lower rate of cooling of central parts 
of the sample (in the case of hot handles).

tests 
were 
performed, 
according to the given methodology. During experiments 
die displacement, force and temperature changes in the 
deformation zone were recorded. The computer simulations 
were performed as well. All series of tests and computer 
simulations were done using long contact zone between 
samples and simulator jaws (cold handle). The deformation 
zone had the initial height of 62.5 mm. The sample diameter 
was 10 mm. The samples were melted at 1430oC and then 
cooled to deformation temperature. During the tests each 
sample was subjected to 10 mm reduction of height. Results 
of each test were used for inverse analysis to compute yield 
stress curve parameters. Figure 15 shows strain-stress 
curves at several strain rate levels for temperature 1300oC.

Comparison between the measured and calculated

the developed computer aided experimental methodology. 
Results of such comparison are presented in Table 1. The

1350oC and 1380oC. Good agreement between the real

equal to 2.76%.

The main reason for that is the lack of strain rate

obtained taking into account the strain rate as a parameter of 
the flow curve are more accurate for temperatures exceeding 
the NDT level.

EXAMPLE RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION OF 11SMN30 
GRADE STEEL 
In this section, the newest results of investigation of 
11SMn30 grade steel are presented. The investigation 
procedures were analogous to those applied in case of C45 
grade steel described in the previous chapter and based on 
new methodology. The long contact zone handles are used 
during all physical tests made using Gleeble 3800 thermo-
mechanical simulator.  The liquidus and solidus temperature 
of 11SMn30 grade steel are 1518°C and 1439°C, 
respectively. The average NST temperature for the selected 
steel was 1410±15°C. In order to determine the nil ductility 
temperature (NDT) a number of experiments were done.  
All the tests indicate a common temperature of 1425°C.  
The estimated ductility recovery temperature was 1400°C. 
At this temperature the sample’s reduction of area was 
around 5% and rose very fast with the temperature drop. 
The predictions of strain-stress relationships were based on 
compression tests. The sample were melted at 1430°C and 
then 
deformed 
after 
dynamic 
cooling 
to 
selected 
temperature levels between 1200oC and NDT. The 
temperature program used for all experimental tests are 
presented in Figure 19. 
  
 
Figure 19.  Temperature program used for all experimental tests. 
For dynamic cooling and deformation processes in some 
regions of the sample the remainder of liquid phase can be 
observed at temperatures lower than NDT. We must 
remember that for cold handles the core temperature is 
higher about 35oC than nominal test temperature. Due to 
significant strain inhomogeneity inverse analysis is the only 
method allowing appropriate calculation of coefficients of 
yield stress functions at any temperature higher than NDT. 
The objective function was defined as a norm of 
discrepancies between calculated (Fc) and measured (Fm) 
loads in a number of subsequent stages of the compression 
according to the following equation:

The theoretical forces Fc were calculated with the help of 
sophisticated FEM solver facilitating accurate computation 
of strain, stress and temperature fields for materials with 
variable density. As written before, experiments for 
temperatures higher than NDT are difficult. Several serious 
experimental problems arise. Apart from problems with 
keeping temperature constant and uniform during the whole 
experimental 
procedure 
there 
are 
also 
difficulties 
concerning interpretation of the measurement results. The 
inhomogeneity in strain distribution and distortion of the 
central part of the sample lead to poor accuracy of the stress 
fields calculated using traditional methods which are usually 
good for lower temperatures. Hence, the application of the 
developed FEM software is necessary in order to ensure 
appropriate 
interpretation 
of 
experimental 
data 
but 
experimental procedure has still to be carried out with great 
caution. More details concerning the applied inverse model 
can be found in [12].  
Figure 20 presents an example graph of stress versus 
strain curve at temperature of 1400°C for the several strain 
rates levels. The presented curves are plotted using the 
calculated coefficients for temperature levels observed in 
the samples’ cross-sections. The formula itself can be 
written in the following form: 
 = 4exp (5)exp (−6&)

where: A, n, b, C are calculated coefficients and , , & are 
strain, strain rate and temperature, respectively.

The verification of the model was done by comparing  
numerical and experimental results. The developed yield 
stress curves were used for example simulations of 
compression of cylindrical samples with mushy central part. 
The length of the potential deformation zone of the sample 
was 30 mm (the rest was mounted in the testing equipment 
jaws), but only a part of it has been subjected to the 
deformation due to huge temperature gradient along the 
sample. Samples were melted at 1430°C and then subjected 
to the deformation at nominal test temperature with height 
reduction of 10 mm. In Figure 27, the final temperature 
distribution in the cross-section of the sample just before the 
deformation at 1425°C is presented. Taking into account the 
value of NDT temperature, solidus temperature as well as 
the temperature difference between the surface and central 
part of the sample one can assume existence of mushy zone 
in the sample volume.  
 
 
Figure 27.  Initial temperature distribution (right before the deformation at 
1425°C) in the ¼ part of sample cross-section. 
The non-uniform temperature distribution in the sample 
cross-section has a great influence on the strain field and 
deformation zone size and shape. The inhomogeneity of the 
strain field leads to inhomogeneous stress distribution. The 
analysis of the strain shows its maximum values in the 
central region of the sample. In the Figures 28-33, example 
strain distribution in the cross section of the deformed 
samples at several temperatures are presented. The one can 
observe that strain level is higher for high-dynamic process. 
On the other hand, the level of strain increases with 
increasing test temperature for both processes: medium and 
high-dynamic.

investigations leading to development of crack propagation 
model, which will be implemented into developed FEM 
system.

Finally, the verifications of the model were done. Two main 
comparative criteria were used for the verification: 
-comparison 
between 
the 
measured 
and 
calculated 
maximum sample radii, 
-comparison between the measured and calculated length of 
zone, which is not subjected to the deformation. 
Figures 35-36 and Figures 37-38  show example application 
of the 1st and 2nd criterion, respectively. The figures confirm 
quite good agreement between theoretical and experimental 
results.

VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The investigations reported in the current paper have 
shown that temperature distribution inside the controlled 
semi-solid volume is strongly heterogeneous and non-
uniform. Axial-symmetrical model does not take into 
account all the physical phenomena accompanying the 
deformation. Finally, the error of the predicted strain-stress 
curves can still be improved. The proposed solution of the 
presented problem is application of both fully three-
dimensional solution and more adequate solidification 
model taking into consideration evolution of  forming steel 
microstructure. Therefore, the study of multiscale modelling 
of mechanical properties is the main target of the future 
work. Contrary to the current model, the new approach 
should allow to better capture the physical principles of 
semi-solid steel deformation in micro-scale. Additionally, 
the methodology should allow to transfer the characteristics 
of the material behaviour between the micro- and  macro-
scale. As a consequence, the final results should be more 
precise and accurate. Modelling of deformation of steel 
samples at extra-high temperatures involves a number of 
issues. One of them is the difficulty of calculating of 
thermal and mechanical material properties. Another most 
important problem is the right interpretation of the results of 
compression tests that provide data for flow stress 
calculation. The presented testing methodology allows 
reliable numerical simulation of deformation of semi-solid 
steel samples and calculation of realistic flow curve 
parameters. The presented research was focused on 
mechanical properties of investigated semi-solid steel. 
Compression tests carried out for semi-solid materials could 
only be interpreted using inverse analysis. Temperature 
strain and strain rate as parameters of the flow curve provide 
accurate results of computer simulation of semi-solid steel 
behaviour. 
The authors have run further investigations leading to 
development of fully three-dimensional simulation system 
of integrated casting and rolling processes, as well as the 
soft reduction process, that are part of strip casting 
technology. Like the model presented in the hereby paper,

mechanical and density changes. All of them are dependent
