Abstract—Connected vehicles have huge potential in improving 
road safety and traffic congestion. The primary aim of this 
paper is threefold: firstly to present an overview of network 
models in connected vehicles; secondly to analyze the factors 
that impact the Quality of Service (QoS) of connected vehicles 
and thirdly to present initial modelling results on Link QoS. We 
use the open access Geometry-based Efficient Propagation 
Model (GEMV2) data to carry out Analysis of Variance, 
Principal Component Analysis and Classical Multi-Dimensional 
scaling on the link quality for vehicle-2-vehicle (V2V) and 
vehicle-2-infrastucture (V2i) data and found that both line of 
sight and non-line of sight has a significant impact on the link 
quality. We further carried out modelling using system 
identification method of the connected vehicle network (CVN) 
in terms of Link QoS based on the parameters identified by the 
QoS assessment. We evaluated the CVN in terms of a step 
response achieving steady-state within 80 seconds for V2V data 
and 500 seconds for V2i data. The work presented here will 
further help in the development of CVN prediction model and 
control for V2V and vehicle-2-anything connectivity.

 INTRODUCTION  
The autonomous car phenomenon is underway in most 
developed economies. While we are many years away from 
full autonomy of vehicles, partial autonomy is becoming a 
reality. Connected vehicles offer huge potential in improving 
road safety and congestion. Authors in [1] have conducted 
quality of service (QoS) analysis on connected vehicle 
network which has been extended in this paper. According to 
a recent report from the Department of Transport, from 
October 2015 to September 2016, there was around 183,000 
casualties resulting from traffic accidents of which 1,800 were 
fatal and over 25,000 were life changing [2]. Therefore, the 
vision is that vehicle-2-anything (V2x) connectivity will 
reduce this figure by at least 76%. A number of developed 
countries are trialling fully and semi-autonomous cars on the 
road. Google’s cars have driven 1.2 million miles in USA, 
with Germany, China and the UK, also looking to open trials. 
Connected vehicles will play a key part in traffic management 
of autonomous cars. Within the next five years there will be 
some form of autonomous driving on the roads of UK.  
Connected vehicles are defined as a set of moving 
networked computer systems with dozens of electronic 
control units (ECUs), hundreds of sensors and million lines 
of code [3]. Research investigating the suitability of wireless 
channels is a significant starting point to them becoming a 
reality in the near future [4][5]. This will also help towards 
the modelling of wireless channels for connected vehicles. 
The benefits of vehicle-2-vehicle (V2V) connectivity 
especially in areas of collision avoidance and congestion 
management are huge, V2V is becoming a reality and 
automobile 
industry 
is 
currently 
working 
towards 
standardization. 
The emerging Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is offering the 
platform to provide real time exchange of information to 
realize the opportunity of improving road safety and 
congestion. It has huge applications in autonomous car 
revolution, intelligent transportation system and smart city. 
IoV integrates three networks – an inter-vehicle network, an 
intra-vehicle network and vehicular mobile Internet. 
Therefore, IoV integrates these three networks and is defined 
as 
“a 
large-scale 
distributed 
system 
for 
wireless 
communication and information exchange between V2x 
according to agreed communication protocols and data 
standards” [6].  
There are a number of challenges within the IoV network 
based on the priority of data exchange messages. For example, 
priority has to be given to safety critical messages, whereas 
on-board messages related to infotainment will be lower on 
that scale. The work presented in [7] proposes an abstract 
network model for IoV based on individual and swarm 
activities. Petri-nets have been used recently in vehicular 
authentication [8], modelling and control of vehicular 
networks [9] and traffic signal analysis in [10]. The work 
presented in [11] models vehicular networks using spatio-
temporal locality and information-centric networks (ICN) are 
presented in [12] to model the connected networks.  Recently, 
the concept of Network of Things (NoT) with Internet of 
Things (IoT) has been presented in [13].   
A number of researchers have presented findings both on 
technique [9] and a network model [14]. Petri nets are 
proposed in [15] for such time critical distributed 
communication and control systems. GEMV2, a geometry-
based V2V channel model has been presented in [14], which 
measures link quality by factoring outlines of vehicles, 
buildings, and foliage to distinguish between the three types 
of links; the links are Line of Sight (LOS), Non-LOS due to 
78

vehicles and Non-LOS (NLOS) due to static objects. In 
addition, the link quality is calculated with the large-scale 
signal variation deterministically and the small scale-signal 
variation stochastically based on the number and size of 
surrounding objects. GEMV2 is freely available to be used by 
researchers. 
The aim of this paper is to identify and present those 
challenges and opportunities associated with Quality of 
Service (QoS) in connected vehicles and to identify the 
modelling direction for Connected Vehicle Network (CVN) 
by conducting Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Principal 
Component Analysis (PCA) and Classical Multi-Dimensional 
scaling (CMD) on the factors that impact link QoS.  We 
further apply the concept of NoT to the emerging IoV as 
presented by NIST [13] and review the connected network 
models presented in literature identifying the challenges and 
solutions.  Here, we define CVN as the network between V2V 
and V2x and where the position/velocity of the vehicle is 
predicted from the previous vehicle/x. The ‘x’ in V2x 
represents vehicle/infrastructure/roadside sensors/anything 
else deemed suitable. The vision for CVN is that each vehicle 
on the road will be able to communicate with other vehicles 
and this set of data and communication will support a new 
generation of active safety applications and systems [15]. 
Wireless technologies and their potential challenges in 
providing vehicle-to-x connectivity are presented in [5]. An 
overview of applications and associated requirements of 
vehicular networks are presented in [16]. Internet mobility in 
vehicular scenarios along with their challenges is presented in 
[17]. With ever increasing connectivity and a vision that 
migrates towards smart cities, security issues and the 
challenges such as propriety networks, inter-operability 
between networks, etc. therein are immense. The work in [18] 
presents some of the security challenges in vehicular ad hoc 
networks (VANET), whereas [19] focuses on the four 
working groups on scientific foundations of vehicular 
networking and presents their findings. Connected Vehicle 
Network is modelled using a black-box approach that 
comprises of vehicles with wireless V2V communication 
using link length estimator to identify the number of vehicles 
in the network [20], whereas [21] presented modelling of 
future state of a vehicle in a platoon based on preceding 
vehicle position and velocity.  
In this paper, we use the data from GEMV2 to carry out 
ANOVA, PCA and CMD. Doing so, helps us to better 
understand the QoS relationship between the link QoS and 
the factors that impact it. We chose four factors that impact 
link quality as Line of Sight (LOS), Non-Line of Sight 
(NLOS), number of neighbours per vehicle (neighbours) and 
the number of neighbouring vehicles whose received power 
was above the threshold (neigh-thresh). Based on the QoS 
assessment [1], we model the parameters to predict the Link 
QoS using System Identification method [22]. The 
parameters are described in Section III.   
The work presented in this paper differs from the ones 
listed above since it provides an in depth analysis on the 
various wireless channels available for connected vehicles 
based on our QoS assessment of the GEMV2 data.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
formulates the problem statement, whereas, Section III gives 
an overview of the network models for connected vehicles. In 
Section IV the channel requirements for CVN is presented. 
Section V describes the QoS assessment on GEMV2 data, 
whereas, Section VI presents the modelling of Link QoS. 
Section VII discusses the research challenges in CVN 
modelling. Conclusions and future work are presented in 
Section VIII.

PROBLEM STATEMENT 
The sheer volume of traffic leads to congestion during 
(increasing long) peak periods, and high traffic density 
increases the probability of collision. If each vehicle in the 
system is a node in a communication system, then drivers can 
be provided with easier warning of impending issues. This 
IoV would enable dynamic planning in the event of local 
constrictions in traffic flows. These systems are equally 
applicable to drivers and to autonomous vehicles. Successful 
implementation of such systems should lead to shorter journey 
times, more efficient use of resources (minimized travel time 
and fuel use), and avoidance of accidental damage and 
consequent financial loss and human injury/death. These 
systems need to be resilient and while communication 
distances are short in heavy traffic the system should be 
capable of working to the same QoS in the early hours when 
traffic is sparse. QoS in this context is the minimum 
acceptable quality of the connected vehicle network to enable 
V2V or V2x communication type.  
The intelligent transport system (ITS) reference 
architecture from [23] has been adapted and is presented in 
Figure 1. It is a protocol stack inspired from the Open 
Systems Interconnection (OSI) model and defines three 
layers as ‘access’, which will support the wireless access 
networks/wireless channels, a network & transport layer 
which supports the routing protocols, data transfer, etc. 
Above it sits the facilities layer, which will support the 
application/information. 
Here, 
we 
define 
the 
position/velocity of the vehicle in this layer. The application 
layer supports vehicle operations based on parameters of 
reliability, security, latency, etc. measured in terms of LOS, 
NLOS, etc.  The layers of application, management and 
security run across both horizontally and vertically and 
provides cross layer commands and information.

QoS of this IoV is affected by a number of parameters. 
These parameters can be divided in access network, facilities 
and application levels. In the access network layer QoS can be 
characterized as: 
𝑄𝑜𝑆 = 𝑓(𝑃𝐸𝑅, 𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑦, 𝑗𝑖𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟, 𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦, … . . ) 
In the facilities level, QoS is given as:  
𝑄𝑜𝑆 = 𝑓(𝑉𝑒ℎ𝑖𝑐𝑙𝑒 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑, 𝑉𝑒ℎ𝑖𝑐𝑙𝑒 𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛) 
In the application level, QoS is given as:  
𝑄𝑜𝑆 = 𝑓(𝑉𝑒ℎ𝑖𝑐𝑙𝑒 𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ, 𝐿𝑜𝑆, 𝑁𝐿𝑜𝑆, … . . ) 
Figure 2 shows the overall modelling direction combining 
parameters from all three layers.

Therefore, the contributions of the paper are three-fold: 
 to present an overview of network models and 
wireless channel requirements in connected 
vehicles. 
 to present ANOVA, PCA and CMD on GEMV2 
data to understand the impact of line of sight, non-
line of sight, neighbours and neigh-thresh per 
vehicle on link quality.  
 to present initial modelling results on Link QoS. 
III. 
AN OVERVIEW OF NETWORK MODELS IN CVN 
This section presents an application of NoT to IoV and an 
overview of the two network models [24] presented in 
literature.  
A. NoT applied to IoV 
The concept diagram of connected vehicles is presented 
in Figure 3, which illustrates V2V and V2x connectivity 
using various access networks which is in turn connected to 
the core network. The concept behind Figure 3 is that 
connected vehicles will be able to communicate with each 
other and with an intelligent transport system (ITS) using 
different wireless channels such as Wi-Fi, 4G/LTE, etc. QoS 
in such application will be critical as vehicles come out of 
one network into the other especially at handover points.  
Connected vehicles are the building blocks of emerging 
Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and Network of Things (NoT) 
[13], which is defined on five primitives as sensors, 
aggregator, communication channel, external utility and 
decision trigger. All vehicles or ‘x’ will have sensors 
connected that will be able to transmit/receive ‘useful’ 
information. This information is converted by an aggregator, 
defined as a mathematical function implemented in software 
that transforms raw data into some ‘useful’ meaning. This is 
underpinned by the communication channel, e.g., WiFi, 4G, 
etc. The external utility can be a software/hardware and will 
execute processes into the overall workflow of NoT. Finally, 
the decision trigger creates the final result needed to satisfy 
the requirements of NoT.    
 
 
Figure 3. V2V and V2x concept diagram 
 
Within the NoT [13] all vehicles will have sensors 
connected that will be able to transmit/receive ‘useful’ 
information. This information is converted by an Aggregator, 
defined as a mathematical function implemented in software 
that transforms raw data into some ‘useful’ meaning. Both 
Sensor and Aggregator are shown as Roadside sensors in 
Figure 3. This is underpinned by the communication channel, 
e.g. WiFi, 4G, etc. Again, Figure 3 shows the wireless 
channels such as Wi-Fi/4G etc. between V2V and V2x. The 
External Utility can be a software/hardware and will execute 
processes into the overall workflow of NoT. Finally, the 
Decision Trigger creates the final result needed to satisfy the 
requirements of NoT. The External Utility and Decision 
Trigger is combined together and presented within ITS in 
Figure 3.

Based on these NoT primitives [13], we present three 
primitives. We combine the primitives of Sensor and 
Aggregator as just Sensing Technologies, Communication 
Channel and again combine External Utility (eUtility) and 
Decision Trigger as one and call it Data Processing as shown 
in Table I. In Table I, feature describes the potential features 
for each primitive.   
B. Swarm and Individual Network Model 
The model presented in [7] integrates human, vehicle, 
thing and environment. The individual model focuses on one 
vehicle and the swarm model focuses on multi-user, multi-
vehicle, multi-thing and multi-network scenarios. Through 
swarm intelligence, crowd sensing and sourcing and social 
computing, IoV can provide services/applications. Factors 
such as network partitions, route failures, change in channel 
quality and data rate and network load are addressed using 
swarm intelligence computing at the service providing stage. 
This is shown in Figure 4.   
 
 
Figure 4. Swarm and Individual Network Model of IoV [7] 
 
Authors in [7] also highlight that understanding the 
service limits is critical for sustainability, i.e. network 
resources under diverse high-dimensional data and limited 
bandwidth of the wireless network. 
C. Cloud, Connection and Clients  
Three major network elements of IoV are identified in [25] 
as cloud, connection and client as shown in Figure 5.  The 
‘cloud’ infrastructure provides a platform for a range of 
wireless access technologies. With the magnitude of traffic 
related information likely to drastically increase, it is ideal to 
handle the information using cloud computing framework. 
‘Connection’, on the other hand, utilises Third Party Network 
Inter Operator (TPNIO) to reduce direct Service Level 
Agreement (SLA) between the operators of the networks, 
enabling seamless roaming without compromising the quality 
and security of network operators. The ‘client’ element with 
the help of Wireless Access Technology (WAT) are broadly 
prioritized and split applications into safety and management 
oriented and business oriented. 
 
 
Figure 5. The three network elements of IoV [25] 
 
D. Summary of Network Models for CVN  
The challenge for any network model in IoV is to be able 
to exchange information from V2V and V2x, where x can be 
a roadside sensor, another device or a person. In addition, 
there may be incompatibility among devices, different 
qualities and response time for Internet connections and 
limited access to data processing and storage. There will be 
additional complexity where some vehicles will be connected 
while others not.  
Future and emerging vehicle applications will consume a 
huge amount of sensor data in a collaborative manner. Content 
centric [26] and information-centric networks [12] will play a 
key role. Vehicles move fast, therefore, in a content-centric 
networking style, vehicle position, speed and direction from 
the rest of the vehicles are continuously sent. Whereas, ICN 
focusses on what instead of where to fulfil primary demands 
from both content publishers and consumers. Vehicular-cloud 
and ICN will contribute to the ‘cloud’ to produce advance 
vehicular services, resource sharing and storing. Four 
categories of services are provided by cloud computing as - 
Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), 
Network as a Service (NaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service 
(IaaS). SaaS is mainly application working over the Internet, 
whereas, PaaS provides a platform to build application and 
services, virtual network are provided by NaaS to the users 
and IaaS provides computation and storage services. The 
proposed architecture for ICN – Named Data Networking 
(NDN) [27] has been extended to vehicular networks where 
content is found and not hosts or IP addresses.  
The revealing of location information has huge concerns 
in vehicle privacy. In addition, location verification of 
neighbouring vehicle is also challenging due to the absence of 
trusted authority in vehicular communication. To capture 
vehicles in line of sight and away from sight presents yet 
another challenge due to the impact of moving and static 
obstacles in the network model. The integration of automotive 
and information technology will be promoted as a result of 
IoV. The biggest challenge in IoV implementation is the lack 
of coordination and communication. This paper aims to 
address the QoS issues in communication challenge. Some of 
the challenges identified are: 
 
Maintaining an accurate line of sight 
 
Accounting for vehicles/x that are outside the line of 
sight

 
Position/velocity of the vehicle in order to model the 
dynamic platoon of vehicles 
 
Vehicles that are not connected  
 
Security considerations and protection from theft 
 
Integration of different wireless protocols e.g. DSRC, 
IEEE 802.11abgn Wi-Fi, 4G/5G cellular networks, 
VLC 
 
Device-to-Device (D2D) communication (defined as 
direct communication between devices in range 
proximity without the involvement of a network 
infrastructure) [28] based on LTE 
 
Safety vs comfort applications 
 
Integration with cloud architecture 
 
Big data analysis in IoV 
 
QoS guarantee – investigate into software defined 
networking techniques  based on the combined 
information from multiple sources rather than 
individual  
IV. 
CVN CHANNEL REQUIREMENT 
A number of applications ranging from infotainment, for 
example, media downloading to traffic safety applications, 
such as driving assistance co-operative awareness impose 
diverse requirements on supporting vehicular networking 
technologies. There will be a huge emphasis on inter-
networking between the different standards in order to 
achieve seamless communications.  In addition, there are 
different requirements for inter-vehicle (V2V or V2x) and 
intra-vehicles networks. Intra-vehicle is defined as all the 
ECUs within the vehicle communicating to the driver and 
includes infotainment. Hence, all the wireless channels 
described in this section may play a role in the connected 
vehicle application. Therefore, this section provides an 
overview on the wireless channels available and the 
connectivity challenges required in a V2V or V2x 
communication type.  
A. DSRC/Wave 
Dedicated short-range communications with wireless 
access in vehicular environments (DSRC/WAVE) as defined 
by IEEE 802.11p and IEEE1609 (higher layer standard based 
on IEEE 802.11p) is a key enabling wireless technology for 
both V2V and V2R communications. DSRC works in 
5.9GHz band with a bandwidth of 75MHz in the US and 
30MHz in Europe and an approximate range of 1000m. It is 
designed for both one way and two way communication. 
DSRC are not compatible in Europe, Japan and US. 
Currently, DSRC is the default broadcast communication 
protocol used. Some limitation of DSRC includes its 
dedicated spectrum in supporting V2V communication type 
[29] and lack of QoS support. Key application for DSRC is 
roadside sensors, which transmit information about 
hazardous conditions, road surface and distance between 
vehicles and anti-collision information. 
B. Zigbee 
Zigbee is based on IEEE 802.15.4 specification intended 
for wireless personal area network applications with low 
power and cost. Zigbee also has applications in V2R 
connectivity 
where 
the 
moving 
vehicle 
exchanges 
information with the roadside sensors [30]. The Zigbee 
enabled roadside sensors then updates traffic status to an 
intelligent control system seamlessly. It also has application 
in intra-vehicle networking where a small wireless sensor 
network is established between the sensors. 
C. Visible Light Communication (VLC) 
The use of visible light communication (VLC) for V2R 
communication is proposed in [31].  VLC is defined by IEEE 
802.15.7 standard and can support data rate up to 96Mb/s 
through fast modulation of LED light sources [29]. It is an 
emerging area of research given the possibility of augmenting 
existing infrastructure such as traffic lights. However, one 
key limitation of VLC is any poor weather conditions such as 
rain and fog could ultimately degrade its communication 
reliability. 
D. Wi-Fi 
Wi-Fi standards are based on IEEE 802.11 series, mainly 
using the 2.4/5GHz band. A number of automobile 
manufacturers are building new cars with in-built Wi-Fi 
capability, providing infotainment applications. V2V 
connectivity could also foster the integration of bicycles and 
pedestrians into the networks [16] using Wi-Fi. This has a 
huge potential in improving road safety and reducing the 
number of accidents as a result of blind spots.

standard is developed by 3GPP. The key advantage of LTE-
connected cars [4] is having cars connecting directly to the 
Internet through existing 4G-LTE cellular network. Work in 
[32] presents a hybrid scheme that can achieve seamless IP 
communication over mobile Internet access.

F. Summary of CVN Channel Requirements 
Table II summarizes the various wireless channels, their 
standard requirements and potential advantages and 
disadvantages for V2V and V2x. The current industry trends 
are choosing DSRC and 4G/LTE as the best way to offer 
connectivity between cars. Many critical applications are 
linked to safety applications, e.g., air bag control, automatic 
braking, etc. Inter-operability between these networking 
standards will be an important milestone. The work presented 
in [33] concludes that DSRC configuration choice has an 
impact on safety messages successfully transmitted. In 
addition, as suggested in [34][35], an upper limit on 
information provided to the vehicle may be necessary to 
prevent overloading drivers with information. This poses 
additional requirements and challenges towards the 
standardization 
of 
wireless 
channels 
for 
vehicle 
communication. Depending on the communication type, e.g., 
V2V or V2x, all of the wireless channels presented in Table 
II will be relevant and the CVN modelling has to take that 
into account.   
V. 
QOS ASSESSMENT IN CVN 
This section presents the QoS assessment using Analysis 
of Variance (ANOVA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
and classical multidimensional scaling (CMD) in MATLAB 
on GEMV2 data for V2V and V2I. CMD has been introduced 
as an extension to the analysis conducted in [1] to further 
understand and confirm the results of the interactions. This 
will help us in understanding the interaction between the four 
parameters chosen and their impact on the link quality and lay 
the foundation in establishing the modelling direction for 
CVN. 
A. GEMV2  
GEMV2 (Geometry-based Efficient Propagation Model 
for V2V communication) [13] data is freely available and is 
implemented in MATLAB. GEMV2 measures large-scale 
variation calculated deterministically and small-scale signal 
variation stochastically based on the number and size of the 
surrounding objects. Both the signal variation is measured in 
decibels.  
We use the GEMV2 data of large-scale and small-scale 
signal variation under the influence of four different 
conditions - they are LOS, NLOS, the number of neighbouring 
vehicles and the neigh-thresh per vehicle. The data is available 
for both V2V and V2I. The communication channel is 
IEEE802.11p. 
LOS links have an unobstructed path between 
communicating vehicles, whereas NLOS is obstructed by 
vehicles and buildings. Neighbours is defined as the number 
of transmitting vehicles in the network and neigh-thresh is 
defined as the number of neighbouring vehicles whose 
received power was above the threshold.  
B. ANOVA on GEMV2 Data 
ANOVA was carried out on the GEMV2 dataset. ANOVA 
is chosen as it enables us to understand the interaction between 
the four parameters on link quality. Table III presents the 
results. ANOVA was carried out on large-scale signal 
variation only for both V2V and V2I as the interaction 
between parameters was found to be not as significant for 
small-scale variation.

Tables III shows the results of the ANOVA. The p-value 
is derived from the cumulative distribution function of F [36] 
and a small p-value indicates that the link quality is 
significantly influenced by the corresponding parameter.  
Between V2V communications, both LOS and NLOS have 
significant impact on the link quality, whereas between V2I 
communications, NLOS is slightly more significant than 
LOS and the Neigh-thresh have a higher impact on link 
quality. However, for V2V, all four parameters have small p-
values indicating that they all in varying degree are 
significant. However, it is interesting to note that, in V2I, the 
number of neighbours per vehicle is not that significant. For 
V2V, the combined interaction between LOS and NLOS and 
NLOS and Neighbours is most significant. Whereas, for V2I, 
the combined interactions are less significant compared to the 
individual. To better understand the interactions, PCA 
investigation is carried out. 
C. PCA on GEMV2 Data 
PCA was chosen as it reduces the dimensionality of the 
data while retaining as much information as possible. PCA 
involves calculating the eigenvalues and their corresponding 
eigenvectors of the covariance or correlation matrix. The 
covariance matrix is used where the same data has the same 
set of variables and correlation matrix is used in the case

where data has a different set of variables. In this paper, the 
covariance matrix was used because of the same dataset.  
 
 
Figure 6a. PCA results for V2V 
Figures 4a and 4b show the PCA results for V2V and V2I 
respectively. In addition to the four factors, both large-scale 
(Largepower) and small-scale (Smallpower) signal variation 
is used. The horizontal axis represents the first principal 
component and the vertical axis the second. Each of the 
parameters is represented by a vector. There are six 
components in Figures 6a and the first three components 
account for more than 90% of the variance. Figure 4a shows 
the first principal component contributes largely to LOS and 
NLOS.  
 
Figure 6b. PCA results for V2I 
Figure 6b shows the PCA results for V2I. Similar to Figure 
6a, Figure 6b the first three components account for over 80% 
of the variability. Points on the edge of the plot have the lowest 
scores for the first principal component.  
D. CMD on GEMV2 Data 
Classical multidimensional scaling (CMD) was carried 
out on the GemV2 data. CMD takes a matrix of interpoint 
distances and creates a configuration of points. It allows data 
to be visualized to get a sense of how near or far points are 
from each other. Therefore, it offers a way of confirming the 
results obtained from PCA and ANOVA in terms of the 
interactions of the chosen parameters. A scatter plot of those 
points provides a visual representation of the original 
distances and can produce a representation of data in small 
number of dimensions.  
 
 
Figure 7a. CMD results for V2V 
Figures 7a and 7b show the CMD plot of V2V and V2I 
data respectively.  
 
 
Figure 7b. CMD results for V2I 
Comparing Figure Fig 7a to 6a, we get similar results and 
shows that both LOS and NLOS are closely correlated. 
Similarly, Figure 7b mirrors Figure 6b and shows close 
correlation between LOS and NLOS. CMD analysis confirms 
the results obtained by ANOVA and PCA earlier. The

cophenetic coefficient was 98.76% for V2V and 99.6% for 
V2I. 
VI. 
CVN MODELLING  
We modelled the CVN in terms of the Link Quality with 
the three QoS parameters – LOS, NLOS and neighbours. 
Figure 8 shows an overview of CVN modelling. Neigh-thresh 
was not chosen as it was not found to be significant from the 
QoS assessment.  
In the future, we will extend this to include parameters 
from each layer, e.g., from the application layer, congestion 
modelled by number of vehicles, LOS, NLOS. Similarly, the 
access layer is modelled by parameters such as Packet Error 
Rate (PER) and delay and the facilities layer contributes the 
vehicles position and velocity.  
 
 
Figure 8. CVN modelling 
 
We used System Identification toolbox in MATLAB on 
the GEMV2 data to present the response of V2V and V2i 
when subjected to a step response. The advantage of this 
method is that it uses measured data directly to estimate the 
model. It uses Auto Regressive Exogenous (ARX) models 
based on the method of least squares to determine the best fit 
line to the data. The method generalizes to finding the best fit 
using simple calculus and linear algebra of the form: 
 
𝑦 = 𝑎1𝑓1(𝑥)+ . . . + 𝑎𝐾𝑓𝐾(𝑥)                                  (1)  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Where, f1,…,fk are given functions to find values of 
coefficients a1,…,aK.  
 
“ARX model structure, in discrete time”, is a difference 
equation with the following form:  
 
𝑦(𝑡) + 𝑎1𝑦(𝑡 − 1) + ⋯ + 𝑎𝑛𝑎𝑦(𝑡 − 𝑛𝑎) = 𝑏1𝑢(𝑡 − 𝑛𝑘) +
⋯ + 𝑏𝑛𝑏𝑢(𝑡 − 𝑛𝑘 − 𝑛𝑏 + 1) + 𝑒(𝑡)                        (2) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 9a. Step response for V2V data 
 
Where, y(t) it’s the output at time t , u(t) is the input at 
time t, na is the number of system poles, nb is the number of 
‘b’ parameters and  ‘b’ is equal to number of zeros plus 1, nk 
is the number of delays in the system. The error function in 
eq. (2) is given by e(t) and is defined as the white-noise 
disturbance value and given as noise in Figure 8.  The discrete 
time transfer function can be defined as: 
 
𝐻(𝑧) = 𝑌(𝑧)
𝑈(𝑧) =
𝑏1𝑧−1 + ⋯ + 𝑏𝑛𝑏𝑧−𝑛𝑏
1 − 𝑎1𝑧−1 − ⋯ − 𝑎𝑛𝑎𝑧−𝑛𝑎           (3) 
 
Figures 9a and 9b show the step response of the 3 inputs 
on the Link QoS for v2v and v2i data. 
The step response in Figure 9a shows that the link QoS has 
a steady state response (~-3.4) with the three inputs chosen for 
V2V.

The step response in Figure 9b shows that the link QoS has 
a steady state response (~-13.2) with the three inputs chosen 
for V2i. This enables us to extend our inputs in the future into 
other layers as shown in Figure 2 to give a better prediction 
for the CVN model.  
VII. RESEARCH CHALLENGES IN CVN 
Our small-scale QoS assessment highlighted some of the 
research challenges and hence potential opportunities for 
further work are as follows: 
(i) Overcoming QoS issues in connected vehicles is 
fundamental to the successful deployment of V2x 
connectivity. The QoS can be affected by networking 
parameters such as bandwidth, delay and latency. In 
addition, parameters such as the distance between 
vehicles, road-side sensors and the speed of the vehicle 
all play a part towards the QoS of the V2x network thus 
integrating connected vehicles into IoT ecosystems [37]. 
QoS will be further divided between V2x service 
reliability for safety related applications where 
parameters such as time-sensitivity during message 
transfer, guarantee of message delivery, etc.  are highest 
priorities. While QoS of on-board applications, e.g., 
infotainment will be lower in priority.  
(ii) We also identified that the needs for trade-off between 
the amount of intelligence sitting with the vehicle for 
intra-vehicle connectivity and to that controlled 
remotely via an intelligent control system. Different 
wireless channels will be suitable for inter-vehicle vs 
intra-vehicle connectivity. For example, on-board 
sensors that can sense a motorbike/bicycle within the 
blind spot of the driver can greatly improve road safety 
and reduce accidents.  
(iii) Prediction of CVN will be based on information centric 
network paradigm which is independent of location. The 
CVN will be predicted from the preceding state of the 
vehicle based on position/velocity. 
The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has 
established communication standards for DSRC for 
connected vehicles (SAE J2735) [38]. This is the first step 
towards standardizing the CVN communication protocols as 
most vehicle manufacturers in the near future will be building 
cars with in-built Wi-Fi capability. An immediate application 
would be to reduce traffic congestion by relaying an 
accident/roadworks/incident to re-route traffic thus reducing 
the overall traffic congestion.  
VIII. CONCLUSIONS 
This paper presents QoS assessment and modelling of 
CVN. QoS assessment was conducted using ANOVA, PCA 
and CMD on the Link QoS of connected vehicles. We used 
data from GEMV2. Our analysis shows that for V2V number 
of transmitting vehicles in the network (neighbours) has a 
bigger impact than in V2I on link quality. However, 
parameters of LOS and NLOS are significant in both types 
(V2V and V2I). This enabled us to model the three 
parameters of LOS, NLOS and Neighbours on Link QoS and 
subject it to step response. The step response result shows that 
the system settles on a steady state. It further addresses QoS 
challenges in connected vehicles and presents an overview of 
the various network models and wireless channels and their 
applications in connected vehicles scenarios. The key issues 
identified will help lay the foundation for future research 
directions in this area. Some of the challenges that need to be 
addressed by wireless channels in connected vehicles are 
weather conditions and their impacts, for example, how low 
visibility and extreme weather conditions can impact on the 
QoS of the connected vehicle. In addition, cameras and ultra-
sonic sensors are limited to low distance. The overall 
reliability of the sensor data within connected vehicle 
communication is critical. As suggested in [3], for safety 
management, sensors that can detect fatigue levels of the 
driver by monitoring various bodily conditions can also be 
added. The first commercial vehicles to have onboard units 
installed are expected in summer 2017 from Cadillac [39].  
The data information and filters necessary are also 
investigated, e.g., what is critical, necessary, add-on to 
process in the vehicle and what data to send/receive to/from 
the data centre. The challenge is to maintain the QoS of the 
real-time communication protocol and how to ensure data 
integrity of the process.  With autonomous driving being 
trialled this year in the UK, what role will connected vehicles 
play? These are some of the imminent research questions 
highlighted from our research.  Future direction of our 
research will aim to address the points raised in this paper and 
focus on refining the modelling of CVN with some form of 
control.
