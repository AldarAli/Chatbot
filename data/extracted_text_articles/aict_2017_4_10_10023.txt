Abstract—Capacity and coverage improvements in 
mobile 
communication 
networks 
have 
evolved 
to 
accommodate increased use of broadband data. One way to 
enable the use of broadband data is to utilize the mmWave 
band. The mmWave-based mobile backhaul solution is very 
useful for providing broadband data traffic for mobile 
service providers, including carriers. However, when 
moving at high speed like a high-speed train, a proper 
handover algorithm is required in a mobile backhaul 
system in order to overcome the high handover shortage or 
delay experienced at these frequencies. Fast and efficient 
handover reliance on these high-speed moves has a 
significant impact on the control layer procedure. In this 
paper, we design a cascade handover method and evaluate 
the throughput of handover data in a Mobile Hotspot 
Network (MHN) using a spectrum band over 6 GHz.

INTRODUCTION 
Mobile data traffic has grown 4,000 times over the 
past decade and global mobile data traffic is growing 
30.6 exa-bytes per month by 2020 [1]. As more than 50 
billion connected devices are expected to be launched, 
including 
1.5 
billion 
cars 
worldwide, 
mobile 
communication networks have become an important 
factor in meeting the needs of specific vertical 
industries and dramatically increasing the number of 
devices [2]. Cellular-type small cells below 6GHz are 
not the same in terms of user and system requirements 
to meet the need for a significant increase in data 
traffic when considering ultra-dense network solutions. 
Especially when moving at high speed, very different 
requirements are required.  Small backhaul in urban 
areas is an effective solution for inter-cell interworking. 
However, the problem caused by mobility in high-
speed is still under investigation in the mmWave-based 
backhaul network [3], [4]. Especially, it can provide 
low cost and small architecture, such as mmWave 
backhaul, channel feasibility, use of large scale MIMO, 
measurement 
of 
mmWave 
propagation, 
and 
combination of multi beam antenna for outdoor 
mmWave mobile communication [5]-[7]. MmWave-
based technology has evolved over the last few decades 
and has contributed to reducing the number of cells 
required. Backhaul and fronthaul networks for 5G 
transport are also presented in the Xhaul architecture, 
which allows for flexible and reconfigurable all 
network elements.  
For high-speed transport (HST), such as subways 
and trains, some results with high data rates of up to 
350 km/h have been presented [9]-[10]. At 60 km/h at 
60 GHz, the Doppler spread is over 3 kHz and is 
several hundred microseconds faster than today's 
cellular systems. Also, high shadowing conditions can 
overcome beam conditions, but channel conditions 
force mmWave beam blocking due to large changes in 
path loss in mobile environments [3]. We design and 
implement a cascade handover scheme, which enables 
faster and more efficient handover. Through this 
simulation, we tried to confirm the relationship between 
packet generation and handover at high speed. We 
propose this method and evaluate the performance of the 
method according to data throughput. The rest of this 
paper is mentioned as follows. Section II introduces 
related work and Section III outlines the MHN system. 
Section IV presents the proposed cascade handover 
scheme including window. Then, procedures and 
performance 
evaluations 
for 
synchronization 
and 
handover execution are described in Sections V and VI. 
The conclusion is in Section VII.

RELATED WORK 
To provide broadband access, such as virtual reality 
and augmented reality services for users in these HSTs, 
it is imperative to overcome the challenges of poor 
channel conditions and large numbers of simultaneous 
handovers. As the number of small cell layout increases 
in 5G, fast handover is required at cell edge [8], [11]. 
Reference [11] shows two improvements in handover 
performance in LTE systems. One is to prevent radio 
link failure in the handover, which provides the 
reliability of the transmission of the handover procedure 
while the user equipment is under poor radio channel 
conditions. The other is to define an early handover 
preparation through an Early Handover Preparation with 
Ping-Pong Avoidance (EHOPPPA) handover to ensure 
reliable transmission of the handover procedure in good 
radio channel conditions. In order to apply this in HST, 
we face some problems, such as mmWave-based beam 
processing and high mobility. Thus, an mmWave-based 
Distributed 
Antenna 
System 
(DAS) 
for 
mobile 
communication systems is introduced and can transmit 
data up to 1 Gbps at distances of up to 1 km using the 27 
GHz spectrum band [12]. In addition, having a network

of moving connected terminal devices can support faster 
and higher functionality. 
Since the advent of new technologies for mobile 
communications for HST, multiple base stations have 
been designed for low interference and low handover 
times. For this purpose, MHN is a mobile backhaul 
based on mmWave, and several base stations are 
installed at intervals of 1km next to the railway for users 
who boarded in HST, and trains pass through MHN's 
mRUs along the railways in turn. The focus of this paper 
is on the subway of the city and in the HST placement in 
rural areas and is designed to have a cell radius that is 
wider than the current small cell size for city radius and 
small cell placement, i.e., a radius of 500 m. The 
coverage of this arrangement is such that the spacing 
between the two mRUs is less than 1 km due to the 
mmWave characteristics such as propagation loss, 
shadowing (e.g., humidity, rain fades and blockage) and 
Doppler spread [12].  
The LTE physical layer is designed to support high 
throughput data delivery of 350 km/h and even 500 km/h 
in rural areas than 3G systems. However, the situation of 
HST can still suffer from LTE networks. First, the 
wireless channel status changes greatly in HST 
environment. Second, handover between cells is often 
apt to occur in terms of speed. To solve this problem, 
LTE-based cell array technique was introduced in [10]. 
While cell arrays may be effectively active on the 
approaching LTE cell, there are some difficulties in 
supporting seamless handover that does not interfere 
with the multimedia stream. LTE-based solutions are 
limited in meeting Gbps multimedia services. The 
handover decision procedure in LTE network between 
two eNBs is typically initiated by the eNBs without 
communicating with the MME. The decision of the 
home eNB that moves the UE to the target eNB is based 
on a measurement report for the UE, such as a Channel 
Quality Indicator (CQI), the target eNB is ready to 
prepare radio resources before confirming the handover. 
As soon as a handover is completed, the target eNB 
indicates the home eNB to release its resources. 
III. MOBILE HOTSPOT NETWORK 
Since MHN typically spans geographical areas, it is 
not economically feasible to build specific networks for 
users who are always in the HST. Therefore, a mobile 
wireless backhaul network that can be accessed even 
during high-speed movement between Wi-Fi and the 
network is needed so that users can connect to the network 
via Wi-Fi installed in the HST without changing the 
specifications of the terminal. In the MHN, the 27 GHz 
band was designed and used to provide mobile wireless 
backhaul to the HST. An mmWave backhaul data traffic is 
converted to Wi-Fi data traffic inside the HST. In Figure 
1, 
the 
MHN 
architecture 
based 
on 
mmWave 
communication for HST is introduced. The overall 
architecture consists of multiple mobile radio units (mRU), 
multiple mobile vehicular equipment (mVE), and mobile 
digital devices (mDU) connected to the mobile gateway 
(mGW). Each mDU communicates with multiple mRUs 
over fiber optics and is responsible for baseband signal 
processing. Each mRU function is an important part of the 
RF transmission at the base station with unique cell 
identity. Beamforming can support multiple independent 
wireless links between mRU and mVE. One mDU and 
several mRUs belong to mNBs. The handover procedure 
is established between the home mNB and the target mNB 
via the M2 interface. Other Packet Data Unit (PDU) 
streams can be transmitted between mRU and mVE. The 
multi-antenna installation of mVE is designed to reduce 
handover latency by maintaining multiple connections to 
the mRU over the M-Uu interface. MVE is a relay that is 
connected to the mobile router using the T1 interface and 
the mobile router is connected to the Wi-Fi AP using the 
T2 interface. Passengers on board can easily access Wi-Fi 
via their mobile handsets. This architecture also greatly 
improves spectral efficiency by allowing mRUs to 
simultaneously use the same radio resources. The mRU in the 
mNB can communicate with the mVEs before and after the 
HST using a beam like the mmWave-based base station [12]. 
 
 
 
Figure 1. MHN Architecture. 
IV. HANDOVER SCHEME WITH WINDOW 
The MHN handover scheme has a synchronized 
channel structure and a cell search algorithm that can 
reliably process neighbor cell search when the 
interference of the home channel is 25 dB or more. The 
MHN proposed a cell search algorithm in which the 
offset and the reserved region are located at positions of 
synchronized channel symbols according to cell ID [12]. 
In this paper, we propose a handover method for fast 
movement between mVE and mRU. The handover 
procedure of cell 3 must be triggered at the maximum 
power of the assumed mRU3 before entering the next cell 
4 in the target mRU4 due to the sudden drop of the 
received power at the cell edge of cell 3. From the 
viewpoint of high-speed movement, the faster the 
handover time, the lower the data transmission rate. 
Further, if the handover time is too late, the received 
power of the target mRU4 received by the mVE is too 
low, which may cause a handover failure as shown in 
Figure 2. In [12], it provides an LTE-based solution that 
can support high throughput and continuous multimedia 
services for HST users, in order to ensure that wireless 
channel conditions change rapidly and connections are 
not interrupted frequently for fast handovers.

(a) Concept and (b) Scheme. 
  
The solution uses a “cell array” that can organize 
continuous cells along the railway in cooperation with 
the femtocell service through Wi-Fi communication that 
collects traffic demand within a train [10]. The cascade 
handover method uses the window based on the moving 
speed of the HST, and the size of the window is 
determined by the HST’s speed. As the moving speed 
increases, the size of the window increases. When the 
speed decreases, the size of the window decreases. 
Equation (1) determines the size of the W window based 
on the moving speed and shows how to calculate the 
window size through each moving speed (= velocity):

where Wsize represents the window size being shipped. 
The velocity indicates the moving speed in km/h. From 
the point of view of the handover between the two 
mRUs, the corresponding window size was calculated 
using the moving speed received from the HST.

Table I shows the results of a simple method of 
calculating the window size according to each HST 
mode with different moving speeds (e.g., the speed of 
the subway is 100 km/h, about 500 km/h for HST and 
about 750 km/h for future HST). This minimizes 
interrupt times for handover and cell search times (e.g., 
mVE and target mRU should find best handover timing). 
Therefore, depending on the speed characteristics of the 
HST over 500 km/h, which is a condition experienced by 
the system, the connection to be sustained is affected by the 
long downtime that can be very intermittent between 
mRUs.

as shown in subway. (b) Velocity is about 500 km/hour as shown in 
HST. (c) Velocity is about 750 km/hour for future HST. 
V. CASCADE HANDOVER PROCEDURE 
We use neighboring cell search and handover 
structure in the region where the power of the home cell 
is very large. In our procedure, a cascade handover 
concept and technique with window is used as shown in 
Figure 3. The window considers the special features of 
the mRU to determine the moving speed, coverage and 
radio resource management. The handover scheme aims 
at selecting and transmitting the target mRU without 
interruption. The shorter the duration of the unnecessary 
handover procedure, the more efficiently the handover 
mechanism will be implemented. Also, as shown in 
Figure 2-(b), the home mRU decides to handover the UE 
moving to the target mRU when the signal strength is 
high. To use this technique, the mRU must be 
synchronized within the calculated window size before 
performing the handover procedure. An improved 
handover procedure is shown in Figure 4. 
 
A. Synchronization for handover preparation 
Synchronization between home mRU and target 
mRU has been introduced to minimize handover 
interruption time due to high speed. If the home mRU in 
source mNB is mRU0 and mRU0 is followed by target 
mRU1, mRU2, ... mRUn, then the target mRU1 to mRUn 
are the neighbor cells to be handed over. First, we 
calculate the window size according to the speed of 
movement by HST, as in (1). In addition, a synchronous 
channel structure / cell search algorithm is required to 
stably perform neighbor cell search even when the 
interference of the home cell is higher than 25 dB. In this 
paper, we introduce a synchronization procedure 
between mRUs on the assumption that the synchronous 
channel structure and the cell search algorithm are 
operating.

Figure 4. Handover procedure using window between mVE and mNBs. 
 
The home mRU then sends a handover ready 
message to each target mRU corresponding to the 
window size calculated as the handover preparation 
information. Note that the mRU belongs to the mDU, 
and because the mDU and mRU belong to the mNB, the 
message is received by the mDU in the mNB. If window 
size is 3, it is assumed that the moving speed of the HST 
between the home mRU and the target mRU is about 500 
km/h. In case of synchronization for handover between 
home mRU and target mRU, improvement of Radio 
Resource Control (RRC) message and application of 
window use are performed in terms of time and location. 
 
target mRUs at Home mRU(= mRU0)  → {mRU1, mRU2, mRU3}   (2) 
target mRUs at Home mRU(= mRU1)  → {mRU2, mRU3, mRU4}  (3) 
: 
target mRUs at Home mRU(= mRUn-3)  → {mRUn-2, mRUn-1, mRUn}  (4) 
 
Equation (2) to (4) list the sequence of target mRUs 
according to the change of the home mRU when the 
window size according to the HST speed is determined. 
The overall value for this can be explained by the 
following (5). The mRU not participating in the 
handover is in the sleep mode in order to block the 
power consumption, and the value "0" in (5) means the 
mRU corresponding to the sleep mode. For efficient 
operation of the sleep mode, inter-mRU synchronization 
by the RRC in the mDU is most important.

There is the number of mRU and velocity for HST. For 
the considered simulation practical environment, we 
select the velocity for train is below 750 Km/h and the 
number of stations is more than 3 respectfully.  
B. Handover preparation in home mRU in mNB 
As soon as the handover decision is complete, the 
home mRU of the mNB sends a "handover request" 
message containing target mRU IDs to target mRUs 
equal to the window size for admission control when 
dynamic resource allocation by the scheduler is activated. 
MRU compares its mRU ID with the target mRU ID sent 
from the home mRU. An mRU with a different ID does 
not send a “handover request confirmation” message to 
55

the home mRU. In this way, the moving speed of the 
HST is stably maintained even when the moving speed 
changes between 0 km/h and the maximum speed. 
C. Handover execution in home mRU in mNB 
For handover performance, in order to ensure smooth 
mobility between the home mRU and the target mRU in 
the mNB, the home mRU and all target mRUs within the 
window size need to share the optimal resource 
allocation. The home mRU sends resource allocation 
information to the target mRUs for fast handover 
execution. When the handover procedure is complete, 
the role of the home mRU is taken by the target mRU 
and the window move is moved to the next mRU. This 
approach is done so that the neighboring target mRUs of 
the home mRU are pre-assigned with the logical network 
entities by the control entity of the peer mRUs to the 
users accessing the Wi-Fi via the mVE in the HST. In 
particular, cooperating peer mRUs can centralize the 
architecture associated with the handover procedure that 
controls the data service of the target mRU, thereby 
contributing to a reduction in seamless service and 
handover interruption time. 
D. Sleep mode for less power consumption in mRU 
Due to the characteristics of subways and trains, the 
ratio of the total running area to the whole area is very 
limited depending on the moving speed and position of 
the train. The train passes the waiting status for a certain 
period of time and then the next train passes. Therefore, 
since the base stations located between the train and the 
next train continue to consume electric power, the 
electric power is cut off after the train has passed and the 
entrance of the train is received from the neighboring 
home RU in the vicinity of the RRC message in advance, 
which will contribute to power saving. The data delivery 
in home mRUs is typically done using a point-to-multi 
point approach, which is deployed in a dense 
arrangement. This scheme ensures a high data rate 
between the mVE and the mRU and at the same time 
minimizes intra-system interference that may occur 
between different cells of the MHN. Therefore, mRUs that 
do not participate in the handover procedure are put into 
sleep mode without power consumption. The home mRU 
enters the sleep mode as soon as it receives the “handover 
complete” message. In particular, if the mDU to which the 
home mRU belongs is different from the mDU to which 
the target mRU belongs, the base station handover must 
occur. At this time, the entire mNB (its mDU and mRUs) 
serving as the base station transits to the sleep mode. 
VI. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
A simulation based on a MHN in the mmWave range 
assumes that the train will run on a straight rail. The 
simulation model presented in this paper is evaluated on 
trains as an on-off model, and the possibility of access 
interception has a great influence on fast handover and 
scheduler design. Because the test cannot be performed 
in a real environment like a train running at a speed of 
500 km/h, this simulation has replaced train speed by 
adjusting the interval of packets occurring between two 
mRUs. The design of on-off model for the application 
level depends on exactly how the access is described at 
the link level. In probabilistic modeling, each on-off 
source can be characterized by a two-state Markov chain 
with a Poisson ratio. Under this assumption, the analysis 
of the IP traffic model between mNB and mVE is mainly 
performed using the on-off model. The data streams 
exchanged between the mRU and the mVE can be 
described by an on-off model, which indicates that the 
processing time of each “on” model represents the 
generation of one data stream at a constant rate of 500 
Mbps and the processing period of each “off” model is 
indicated the inactivity period between adjacent data 
streams. The configuration and flow of the on-off model 
for evaluating the handover procedure is shown in Figure 5.  
 
 
 
 
Figure 5. On-off Model to generate packets for handover 
  
This model shows the operational status of the mVE, 
which provides a different set of performance than the 
3GPP common User Equipment (UE). MVE converts the 
data received from multiple UEs into a packet stream 
through Wi-Fi which is an access point (AP) operating in 
the HST, and transmits the data stream to mRU. When 
the transmitted packet stream arrives at the mRU, the 
mRU may select it based on the exponential distribution. 
In probabilistic modeling, individual on and off modes 
can be characterized by a two-state Markov chain with a 
Poisson's rate, λ. The sojourn times of the two states can 
be exponentially distributed by the exponents α and β. 
This means that the model is related to the next 
interaction. ① mRUs receiving the users' data streams 
from the mVE send the data stream to the connected 
mDU. ② the gateway is connected not only to the home 
mDU, but also to the target mDU, which is the neighbor 
mDU of the home mDU to control the data stream. Each 
data stream is distributed within the mNBs in the home 
and target mDU. The distribution between mVE and 
mRU means the capacity of mRU and handover 
triggering, and the distribution between mRU and mDU 
includes handover at the cell boundary. mDU 
orchestrates those interactions and make sure of keeping 
session connection without interruption.

Figure 6. Handover interruption time according to traffic arrival rate. 
 
In Figure 6, it can be shown that the handover 
downtime increases from 100km/h to 750km/h according 
to the data traffic arrival rate, when the window size 
requiring minimum handover interruption time is 
expected. The data traffic arrival rate is generated by 
PDUs that occur per second. When HST is operating at 
500 km/h or less, the handover interruption time is 
maintained steadily according to the traffic, but the 
performance is drastically degraded as the traffic 
gradually increases at 750 km/h. This means that if the 
HST speed exceeds 500kh/h, the data traffic arrival 
interval is less than 1msec, or the data arrival rate is 
more than 12,500, the proposed handover method cannot 
provide proper window size. Therefore, we need another 
approach for handover that depends on window size. For 
example, as the HST operates at a speed of 750 km/h, the 
cell radius between the two mRUs must be at least 500 m 
to solve the performance degradation. 
VII. CONCLUSION 
The 
large 
bandwidth 
available 
at 
mmWave 
frequencies can greatly increase the capacity of the fifth 
generation wireless systems based on wireless backhaul. 
However, when moving at high speeds, utilizing the 
optimal handover algorithm in the MHN system to 
overcome the high handover shortage rate or delay 
experienced at these frequencies, a suitable handover 
algorithm is required. In particular, a fast moving mVE 
ahead of the target mRU will require a decision as to 
when to initiate a handover, and if this determination is 
made too fast or too late, a delay or short circuit of the 
session may occur. In this paper, we propose a method 
for providing information about target mRUs through a 
window to determine timing to start a fast and efficient 
handover. The results show that cascaded handover with 
windows improves cell search and extends link range to 
reduce handover interruption time. This procedure 
provides the user of the HST with an efficient handover 
scheme from the home mRU to the target mRU in the 
window according to the rate, and can be performed 
without collaboration with the evolved packet core 
(EPC). A prepared message communicates directly with 
the target mRU and the home mDU to which the home 
mRU belongs. It also analyzes both the MHN using the 
27 GHz range and shows all of the measurement and 
simulation results to verify the use of the handover 
method with the MHN window. In addition to 
supporting high speeds of over 500 km/h, many 
technical issues remain. We will improve the proposed 
handover 
method 
by 
extending 
the 
simulation 
environment for further research.
