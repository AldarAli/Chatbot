Abstract – This document proposes to evaluate the transmis-
sion of Video on Demand using Intelligent Streaming and Next 
Generation Networks concepts. Intelligent Streaming is an adap-
tive methodology to take advantage of bandwidth and the net-
work resources, the streaming system had been tested over the 
UDNET and RUMBO-RENATA networks during the peak data 
traffic.  Jitter deviation, data packet losses, user datagram proto-
col efficiency and quality of service are some of the indicators 
measured. The Intelligent Streaming guarantees the quality of 
service matching the server with the client needs, without chang-
ing the network policies delivery systems. 
 
Keywords – Intelligent Streaming; Video on Demand; Next Gen-
eration Networks; TCP and UDP; Network Efficiency. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Communications have generated a change in people’s daily 
habits since Internet is accessible to everyone. Internet has 
become the main tool for work, networking and leisure activi-
ties due to home use as well as the number of smart mobile 
terminals. Now, the way to share Internet content has changed 
with the Next Generation Networks (NGN) because the files 
are sent in data packets [1, 2]. An efficient way to broadcast 
information is video streaming which has become the main 
application for video-conferencing, Video on Demand (VOD) 
and video-aided distance learning [3, 4]. 
The streaming transmission over the web has been devel-
oped for many authors [5, 6], where the reliability of real time 
playing of video segments is shown. Some of them study the 
point of traffic in the network making a pre-release of infor-
mation and broadcast at a defined time. If someone wants to 
access to specific video, the user has to subscribe and when 
the information is available the user has to authenticate the 
subscription [7]. One of the limitations for video streaming is 
the consumption resources when too many users are con-
nected. Bandwidth efficient algorithms applications show the 
non - reduction of efficiency system when the level of interac-
tion increases. The interaction available is not affected and the 
overheads are associated to external sources and not to an 
algorithm failure [8]. 
The development exposed in this paper is a transmission 
VOD using intelligent streaming, increasing the QoS (Quality 
of Service) and decreasing jitter. In this proposal the QoS is 
defined according to the features of the client’s connection and 
the streaming server capability, keeping the policy delivery 
unmodified.  
The advantages of intelligent streaming are playing the vid-
eo while the information is being downloaded and analysing 
the client’s speed connection in order to transmit the data 
packet in a bit rate appropriately in relation with the channel 
bandwidth, avoiding delays and getting hung up [10, 11]. The 
strategy for improving the systems quality and transmission 
rate is the use of dedicated servers for streaming instead of 
web servers. These servers are in charge of storing and operat-
ing the data packets [12].  
The design requirements are a trade-off between latency, 
memory and the overhead, take advantage of bandwidth,  
availability of data network and decrease in data packet losses 
and jitter [13, 14].  
This paper is organized as follows; the first part shows the 
features of a streaming system, the tool chosen for this devel-
opment, the process for encoding files and the selection of 
encoding rates for multimedia contents. Next the streaming 
model proposed for being tested using VOD is described. Also 
the delivery polices and the operation of the server streaming 
sub-system. In the last section the test results over the UDNET 
and RENATA-RUMBO networks are compiled and analysed. 
II. STREAMING STUDY FEATURES 
A streaming system comprises the user with a specified 
bandwidth and transmission rate [1], a player that supports 
video and audio, an Internet Service Provider (ISP), a stream-
ing server with a control, storage and communications sub-
system, an encoding and compression unit and video and au-
dio sources. The components are explained briefly next. Fig. 1 
depicts a typical structure of streaming.

User: supports the multimedia contents reception and uncut 
viewing as well as VCR (Video Cassette Recorder) com-
mands.  
Player: is in charge of sending the user requests to the 
streaming server, the storage received contents in local buf-
fers, encoding contents and synchronize the data for display-
ing. 
Distribution and Delivery: Internet is the platform for ex-
changing information between player and streaming server. 
Streaming server: the main functions are management of 
the policies delivery, system storage of the contents and to 
answer the requests made by the clients.  
Encoding and Compression: is in charge of modifying the 
video and audio sources in a compatible format file with the 
user player.  
Video and audio: are the sources for a streaming system. 
Their transmission can be on demand or live. 
The aim of NGN and IPTV is convergence [15], for this 
reason the software for developing the application must satisfy 
this.  
The tool Windows Media® has been chosen for its encoding 
system with a public domain license useful for files format 
supported by WMP® (Windows Media Player) like wma for 
audio files and wmv for video files. WME® (Windows Media 
Encoder) is a free multimedia contents player; the platform 
server is Windows Server 2008. 
WME® offers a variety of possibilities for video edition and 
guarantees high quality and high compression file [16, 17]. 
The most important feature of WME is the capture contents in 
frames enabling the transmission of encoding sequences for 
different transmission rates, what is known as Intelligent 
Streaming. Besides it has other features: hardware accelera-
tion, high definition video, multi-channel sound quality, seg-
ment-based encoding, easy to use because it has an intuitive 
interface, save contents and manage QoS delivery policies 
with the client. In addition to, it supports protocols for copy-
right like ISAN (International Standard Audiovisual Number), 
Ad-ID (Advertising Industry Standard Unique Identifier) and 
DRM (Digital Rights Management). 
For encoding contents using WME it is necessary to get the 
source in a digital format, select the source, the distribution 
method and the characteristics of user connection, add the 
meta-data to the file and apply DRM. The process of encoding 
contents is: 
File Conversion: this option allows for converting an avi or 
mpeg format file to compatible formats file with WME like 
wmv, wma or wav. 
File Information: in this stage the meta-data are updated in 
the streaming file.  
Direct Encoding: WME® allows it capture multimedia con-
tents directly from the sound card or video card for encoding.  
Select Source: the input file must be selected for encoding 
as well as the file name and the storage directory. 
Distribution Method: is selected depending on the encoding 
formats and the kind of application. The streaming server for 
this development is WMS® (Windows Media Server). 
 
Connection Characteristics: the transmission rate must be 
set, depending on the quality of connection. Also is possible 
set the transmission rate for multiple terminals that will be 
adjusted by intelligent streaming as is proposed in this docu-
ment. In Table I. are showed the encoding rates selected.

III. MODEL SERVICE CHARACTERIZATION 
The streaming systems are classified according to services 
offered like interactivity and information availability [17]. 
These characteristics make attractive the service increasing the 
interest and the desire to interact and learn about specific top-
ics. The most common services offered are “Live” and “On 
Demand”. 
Live: is a transmission that is being generated in real time 
[16]. On demand: is a transmission that is has its information 
stored in a buffer, allowing the user to download at any time 
video selected [4]. The model proposed and tested to VOD 
and applying Intelligent Streaming is presented in Fig. 2.

Intelligent streaming is a feature of WMS that scaling the 
data rate transmission through multiple video tracks [18]. The 
process for intelligent streaming begins with the request from 
the user, this request defines if the data source is live or VOD. 
Then the streaming server start the negotiation of rate trans-
mission defining the QoS policies. In all streaming transmis-
sion the audio has priority over the video, because of overlap-
ping is less noticeable in video than audio. Next, media con-
tent can be broadcasted in any of the 4 coding rates explained 
and the requests are analyzed to broadcast the video preserv-
ing the audio quality. The next steps are encoding separately 
audio and video and synchronize them on the client player. 
Data transmission is the stage that define if it is necessary 
storage the encoding files in a storage server, it happens when 
the request is unicast, while a broadcast request send the in-
formation to all terminals and each client decide what infor-
mation wants to watch [16]. The advantage of broadcast is the 
traffic reduction over the net, the decreasing bandwidth 
needed and the streaming server processes are steady. The 
player has a storage system that save a part of files and the 
playing begins, this stage is a dynamic system that is storing 
and playing the information [8]. 
Streaming server delivery policies are the basis to synchron-
ize data transmission ensuring data flow along all network and 
are related with a control sub-system [19], a communications 
sub-system and a storage sub-system as is depicted in Fig. 3.  
 
 
Fig. 3 Server Streaming Sub-systems 
 
The storage sub-system has three sub-modules, storage, file 
system and storage control. All the encoding files are saved on 
data storage and the sub-module file system is in charge of 
enabling the data saving or transmission depending on the 
control sub-system requests. The sub-module storage control 
is communicated with the sub-module delivery policies of 
communications Sub-system, and its function is informing the 
capabilities of system during the transmission [19].  
The control sub-system has the sub-modules of admission 
control and scheduling. The admission control must ensure the 
QoS and the resources availability as disk bandwidth, 
processing bandwidth, bandwidth network and space for sto-
rage, for the client. The scheduling sub-module has two sub-
modules, disk Scheduling and network scheduling their func-
tion is planning how must be the data transference from the 
Storage sub-system to the memory buffers and from the mem-
ory buffers to the network. Communications sub-system has 
the sub-modules, delivery policies and net interface.  The main 
function is responded to user requests and offers the services 
according to client capabilities.  
IV. NETWORK ANALYSIS MEASUREMENT RESULTS 
With the known benchmark program GNU Iperf [20], 
which measures some TCP/IP network features, two networks 
are studied as study case with the same video data and are 
evaluated with different performance indices in order to show 
the effectiveness of the intelligent streaming model proposed.  
Fig.4 shows two pictures of the same video from a server to 
a client – server, the software mentioned evaluate the TCP and 
UDP performance. 
 
   
 
Fig. 4 Real Time Video Streaming Implemented 
A. Measurements on the UDNET Network  
The first study case is the UDNET Network (Universidad 
Distrital Network) which is LAN (Local Area Network) and 
its theoretical transmission bandwidth is of 100 Mbps/s, the 
evaluation indicates that this network has more efficiency with 
large amount of information without fragmenting; the first test 
shows the TCP window rate with 8, 20000, 100000 and 
1000000 Kbytes and is observed how the efficiency increase 
with those windows rates. Fig. 5 shows this network test. 
 
Fig. 5  TCP Effective Bandwidth of UDNET Network.  
 
Data packets have not always the same delay [14], this as-
sociated to the jitter effect which relates the time expected 
when packets arrive, with the time of packets are delivered.

average. 
Jitter measurement in this application is presented in Fig. 6; 
the jitter difference between the average is minimal; it shows

that there is no degradation in video transmission. The average 
level of jitter deviation is 0.38ms, with a maximum value of 
0.689ms and a minimum of 0.118ms. 
It is well known that packets of data do not have a correct 
order in delivery and the rate transmission has losses and is 
also inconstant, however the audio requires this rate to be 
constant. Jitter buffer at the receiver compensates the effects 
by its function of trade off between delay and loss [10], these 
jitter buffers have a variations of 30ms and manage the audio 
transmission at a constant rate.  
If the rate of transmission is slower than supported in 
buffer, is presented with high losses in packets spoiling the 
transmission quality, the maximum limit of losses should not 
exceed 1% [10, 12], due to these data losses which are notice-
able in the final user and the service is demoted. The data 
video on the network studied shows the next behaviour ac-
cording to the amount of information transferred.  
 
 
Fig. 7   In blue: Amount of Information Deviation Transferred. In red: 
Amount of Information Average. 
 
According to the effective average of data transmitted, 
which is of 7.36 Mbytes, 3600 samples per hour are sent 
(sample per minute), Fig. 8 shows the variability of losses, 
obtaining a minimum deviation of average reference. 
 
Fig. 8 In blue: Data Packet Sent Losses on the UDNET Network. In red: 
Information Losses Average. 
 
The packet average lost is of 49 packets per 5351 packets 
sent, with a maximum lost of 80 and a minimum of 35 pack-
ets. In percentage terms the value of data packet losses is 
about of 0.91%, which is suitable to guarantee a QoS (Quality 
of Service QoS) in voice and video standard demand of lower 
value of 1%.  Tests on UDNET network shows this fulfillment 
demanded in this kind of service. Fig. 9 shows the efficiency 
measurement mentioned.

cy Average. 
 
The efficiency average in the network faced with observed 
variations, has a measured value of 99.1% which is in the 
within margins in a correct service. 
Table II shows the main measurements performance indices 
evaluated in the UDNET Network, where TB, EB and TCP 
WR mean Theoretical Bandwidth, EB Effective Bandwidth 
respectively (Mbytes/s) and TCP Window Rate (Kbytes).

rates of the first case, this presents a better efficiency trans-
mission packet that is about of 20000 Kbytes and its theoreti-
cal transmission rate is of 60Mbytes/s.

V. CONCLUSIONS 
Next Generation Networks have become a viable option for 
firms and has impacted positively in clients which demand 
them, tests performance in this document demonstrate the 
simplicity to broadcast multimedia contents with intelligent 
streaming in networks where it is not apparently supported. 
A high efficiency performance of TCP and UDP is obtained 
in both Intranet networks (92.7%), even though the peak hour 
traffic (8:00 am – 9:00 am) and it validate the implementation 
QoS in the two study network cases developed here. 
This real time application shows how it is improved the 
quality of service applying intelligent streaming in some local

study cases networks, without a change in the policies or 
access network, only requiring network negotiations between 
client and the server. 
It has found that the peak hour is between the 8 and 9 of 
morning because in this hour the University starts the most 
Network activities, start to work the administrative area and a 
big part of University´s computers request access to the serv-
ers, as shown in Fig. 15. 
Multimedia streaming has been gradually gaining ground 
from peer to peer networks used to download and make play 
lists contents, due to streaming technology it does not require 
high storage capacity of streams, on the other hand, peer to 
peer requires first, a complete download to reproduce the 
content. 
The TCP Protocol is used only for the service website and 
the connection control, the pair of protocols RTP/UDP was 
used for the transmission of audio and video data. 
SCTP Protocol was no used because their greatest features 
as RTO and heartbeats to declare inactive or failed connec-
tions would not be exploited, also for this specific application 
was unlikely that the computer, laptop or smartphone to have 
3 or more IP address to take advantage of another great feature 
of this protocol as the “multihoming”.  
This paper shows a relatively easy and efficient way to 
transmit audio a video through a typical network and an aca-
demic network of advanced technology using techniques such 
as intelligent streaming with support for IPv6 using Windows 
Server 2008, and comparing the results of efficiency in both 
networks.
