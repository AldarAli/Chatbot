Abstract—A computational study of structural and vibrational 
spectroscopic properties of hydrophilic drug irinotecane was 
carried out. Both static and dynamical approaches to the 
problem have been implemented. In the static ones, vibrational 
spectra of the title system were computed within the double 
harmonic approximation, diagonalizing the mass-weighted 
Hessian matrices. These were calculated for the minima on 
AM1, PM3, PM6 and B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) potential energy 
surfaces. Within the dynamical approach, atom-centered 
density matrix propagation scheme was implemented at AM1 
level of theory. From the computed molecular dynamics 
trajectories at series of temperatures (ranging from 10 to 300 
K), velocity-velocity autocorrelation function was calculated 
and the vibrational density of states was sequentially obtained 
by Fourier transformation. Comparison with the experimental 
data revealed that the employed density functional level of 
theory 
exhibited 
remarkable 
performances. 
Of 
all 
semiempirical theoretical levels, PM6 was found to perform 
best, comparable to B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) when lower-frequency 
region is in question. 
Keywords-theoretical

 INTRODUCTION 
The classical paradigm in pharmaceutical sciences 
concerning drug delivery systems has changed significantly 
upon the advent of nanoscience and nanotechnology [1]. 
This emerging research area has opened quite new 
possibilities in achieving appropriate administration and 
targeting 
of 
pharmacologically 
active 
substances. 
Appropriate drug delivery is of essential importance in 
medical treatment of diseases, as it can affect most important 
aspects of drugs’ pharmacological activity, such as its 
pharmacokinetics, distribution, metabolism, as well as the 
direct therapeutic effect itself. 
The field of drug delivery along with the efforts directed 
towards controlled release have exhibited a significant 
evolution in the last few decades: starting from matrix-
incorporated, 
hydrogel-encapsulated 
and 
finally 
nanoparticle-encaged drug paradigm. In the context of 
previous discussion, finding the most appropriate system for 
drug administration and targeted delivery is of essential 
importance in current research in pharmaceutical sciences 
[1].  
In the last period, it has been shown that complex 
delivery systems built up when a hydrophilic drug is 
entrapped into a nanoparticle composed of hydrophobic 
polymer exhibit remarkably controllable properties.  
Recently [2], the hydrophilic drug irinotecane (in the 
form of hydrochloride) has been incorporated into 
nanoparticles built up by poly lactic-co-glycolic acid 
copolymer 
(PLGA) 
and 
co-adsorbed 
PEO-PPO-PEO 
(polyethylene oxide – polypropylene – polyethylene oxide) 
copolymer. The formulations were designed by a planned 
experiment approach, and the nanoparticle-drug interaction 
upon encapsulation was studied by differential scanning 
calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) 
spectroscopy. Subtle changes in the IR spectral properties of 
predominantly the co-polymer part of this complex system 
were used to derive conclusions about the drug incorporation 
into the nanoparticles and the nature of nanoparticle-drug 
interactions. Due to the inherent complexity and size of this 
multi-component system, to get an in-depth understanding of 
the mentioned phenomena, it is of essential importance to 
carry out theoretical simulations along with the spectroscopic 
experiments. In the course of the main aim to understand the 
vibrational spectroscopic, as well as energetic aspects of the 
nanoparticle-drug interactions, in the present study we carry

out a computational study of vibrational dynamics of the 
hydrophilic drug irinotecane. We rely on the contemporary 
theoretical approaches to the mentioned issue, which are yet 
computationally feasible for studies of the drug molecule 
itself, as well as the drug incorporated into the nanoparticle 
cage. 
In Section 2, we describe the two computational 
methodologies – static and dynamic. Section 3 presents the 
results from the implementation of both computational 
methods and a short discussion. In Section 4, we provide the 
conclusion. 
 
II. 
COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS 
To be able to get an insight into the changes of geometry 
and vibrational force field of the irinotecan molecule upon its 
inclusion in the PLGA/PEO-PPO-PEO nanoparticles, one 
has to explore in details the corresponding aspects in the case 
of free molecular system. For that purpose, we have adopted 
the 
following 
computational 
methodology. 
Two 
computational approaches were actually implemented in our 
current study: static and dynamic one.  
Within the static approach, the geometry of neutral 
irinotecan molecule was first optimized using Schlegel’s 
gradient optimization algorithm [3]. This was done at density 
functional level of theory (DFT), as well as using 
semiempirical AM1 [4], PM3 [5] and PM6 [6] Hamiltonians.  
DFT 
calculations 
were 
performed 
employing 
a 
combination 
of 
Becke’s 
three-parameter 
adiabatic 
connection exchange functional (B3 [7]) with the Lee-Yang-
Parr correlation functional (LYP [8]); this computational 
approach is denoted by the (B3-LYP) acronym in the 
computational chemistry literature. The Pople-style basis set 
6-31G(d,p) was used for orbital expansion in solving the 
Kohn-Sham equations, which was done in an iterative 
manner. This basis set is flexible enough to account for 
necessary structural specificity of the studied molecule; it 
contains a set of d-type polarization functions on “heavy” 
(i.e., non-hydrogen) atoms and set of p-type polarization 
functions on all hydrogen atoms. It has been already 
demonstrated in numerous studies that DFT results exhibit a 
remarkably good convergence with the basis set size and 
double-zeta quality basis sets (as the one implemented in the 
current study) are often quite sufficient for a wide variety of 
purposes. For numerical integration in the course of DFT 
calculations, we have used the pruned (75,302) grid, 
consisting of 75 radial shells and 302 angular points per shell 
(leading 
to 
approximately 
7000 
points 
per 
atom). 
Subsequently to location of the stationary points on the 
molecular potential energy hypersurfaces (PESs), we have 
performed vibrational frequency calculations for the 
corresponding geometries. These computations were carried 
out within the harmonic approximation (diagonalizing the 
mass-weighted Hessian matrix). The aim of harmonic 
vibrational analysis was two-fold: to examine the character 
of the located stationary point on the corresponding PES, as 
well 
as 
to 
compute 
the 
intramolecular 
vibrational 
frequencies. The absence of imaginary frequencies (i.e., 
negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrices) served as an 
indication that a true (real) minimum has been located on the 
corresponding PES (instead of a saddle-point, i.e., transition 
structure).  
Within the dynamical approach, we have used the atom-
centered density-matrix propagation scheme (ADMP) 
quantum molecular dynamics methodology [9]. A series of 
ADMP simulations were carried out for the irinotecan 
molecule, under constant temperature conditions, employing 
semiempirical AM1 method. The temperature was kept 
constant by velocity scaling at each step of the dynamical 
simulation. Dynamical simulations of the studied system 
were carried out at 10, 100, 200 and 300 K. Dynamical 
vibrational spectral characteristics of the title system were 
computed from the results of dynamical simulations as 
explained further in the paper. Each dynamical simulation 
consisted of 2000 steps, and the initial kinetic energy was set 
to 51297 microHartrees. The fictitious electronic mass was 
set to 0.1 amu; simulation step size was set at 0.2 fs. 
All quantum mechanical calculations in the present study 
were carried out with the Gaussian09 series of codes [10].   
 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
In this Section, we provide the results from the static and 
dynamic approaches for finding the vibrational spectroscopy 
of hydrophilic drug irinotecan.  
A. Static approach 
The optimized geometry of irinotecan molecule at the 
B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory (i.e., the minimum on the 
corresponding PES) is shown in Fig. 1.  
 
Figure 1. Optimized geometry of irinotecan at B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of 
theory. 
 
As can be seen from Fig. 1, the structure of neutral free 
irinotecan is characterized by an intramolecular O-H…O 
hydrogen bond. The H…O distance in this intramolecular 
contact is 2.0054 Å.  
Semiempirical levels of theory give quite similar 
structures for free irinotecan molecule, the main predicted 
structural differences being in the conformationally flexible 
intramolecular 
degrees 
of 
freedom. 
The 
structures 
corresponding to real minima on the AM1, PM3 and PM6 
PESs of free irinotecane molecule are shown in Fig. 2. 
Perhaps the most notable difference in the predicted 
minimum-energy 
structures 
at 
the 
implemented 
semiempirical levels of theory is the conformational 
flexibility of the OH group. As can be seen from Fig. 2, both 
AM1 and PM3 levels of theory predict minimum energy 
structures in which the proton from the OH group is far 
below the plane in which the C-C=O fragment (containing 
the carbonyl group oxygen atom) lies. Such arrangement 
does not conform to an arrangement of atoms characteristic 
12

for a hydrogen bond. Obviously, therefore, these two 
semiempirical levels of theory fail to predict the existence of 
intramolecular hydrogen bond of the O-H…O type. 
Contrary to AM1 and PM3 levels, however, the results 
obtained with the PM6 semiempirical Hamiltonian are 
similar with this respect to the DFT results. We are therefore 
apt to conclude that the PM6 semiempirical level of theory 
should be regarded as more reliable that AM1 and PM3 
when structural consequences of specific intramolecular 
interactions are in question. Concerning the conformational 
flexibility of the mostly-aliphatic part of the molecule (with 
sp3 hybridized carbon atoms), on the other hand, all levels of 
theory predict different conformational landscape generated 
by rotations around the C-O and O-N bonds. However, due 
to the absence of specific intramolecular interactions in this 
part of the molecule, such flexibility is in fact expected. 
Moreover, in presence of relatively low barriers to 
intramolecular torsional motions (i.e., hindered rotations) of 
the mentioned types, the actual molecular structure may be 
an 
average 
of 
the 
thermally-induced 
dynamically 
interchanging configurations.

The main aim of the present study is to establish a 
reliable computational methodology for prediction of 
vibrational spectroscopic properties of free irinotecan 
molecule, which could later be used for prediction of spectral 
changes as a consequence of inclusion of this molecule 
within PLGA/PEO-PPO-PEO nanoparticles, followed by 
subsequent adsorption on the inner, hydrophilic wall thereof. 
We have therefore further computed the IR spectra of the 
title molecule at the employed theoretical levels, by 
diagonalization of mass-weighted Hessian matrix. Since this 
procedure essentially gives the harmonic vibrational 
frequencies, to account for the known systematic differences 
between 
experimental 
(anharmonic) 
values 
and 
the 
theoretical ones, as well as to account for the known 
systematic errors due to inherent assumptions to each of the 
employed theoretical models, we have scaled the initially 
computed vibrational wavenumbers with the established 
scaling factors [11]. The resulting IR spectra obtained by 
convoluting the delta-function spectra with Lorentzian 
functions with a half-width of 4 cm-1 are presented in Fig. 3.

B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) levels of theory. 
 
As can be seen, the methods exhibit rather different 
performances when vibrational modes appearing above and 
around 3000 cm-1 are in question. However, as the 
experimental spectroscopic data have usually been collected 
in the region below 2500 (or 2000) cm-1, this is the region 
that may be considered to be of primary importance in the 
context of present and also of upcoming studies of this 
molecular system, either isolated (gas-phase) or embedded 
within a condensed phase environment. When one considers 
the mentioned region, however, it becomes obvious even 
from visual inspection of the theoretical spectra that PM6 
semiempirical approach performs rather comparably to the 
B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) “model chemistry”, and thus is the 
method of choice for further studies of vibrational 
spectroscopic properties of irinotecan incorporated in 
PLGA/PEO-PPO-PEO nanoparticles. Such nanoparticles are 
rather large from computational viewpoint, with rather 
disordered structure viewed at molecular level. It is therefore 
of substantial interest to compare the performances of 
various computational methods with this respect. If the 
performances of a method with lower computational cost are 
comparable to those of a well-established computational 
approach (such as, e.g., B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)), it could be of 
high significance for prediction of changes of the vibrational 
spectroscopic signature of irinotecan molecule upon its

incorporation (encapsulation)/inner wall adsorption within 
the mentioned nanoparticles serving as drug-carriers. Finally, 
we compare the experimental ATR FTIR spectra of 
irinotecan hydrochloride with the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) 
theoretical one in Fig. 4. 
As can be seen, the agreement between theory and 
experiment is remarkable.

Figure 4. Theoretical IR spectrum of free irinotecan computed at DFT 
B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory (lower curve), together with the 
experimental ATR FTIR spectrum of irinotecan hydrochloride. 
 
While the spectral region above and around 3000 cm-1 is 
dominated by bands due to OH and CH stretching vibrations, 
the lower frequency region (usually below 2000 cm-1) is a bit 
more complex and contains the so-called molecular 
fingerprint region. This spectral region is dominated by 
bands due to carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibrations in two 
spatially distant segments of irinotecan molecule, appearing 
at about 1744, 1737 and 1674 cm-1 in the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) 
theoretical spectrum (IR intensities are 349, 503 and 469 km 
mol-1 respectively). The carbonyl stretching band appearing 
at lowest frequencies is due to the carbonyl group attached to 
the 
heterocyclic 
aromatic 
ring. 
Therefore, 
partial 
delocalization of electronic density into the aromatic ring 
leads to lowering of the corresponding C=O bond force 
constant value and consequently lower C=O stretching 
vibration as compared to the other intramolecular carbonyl 
moieties which are not attached to aromatic systems. Note 
that the band appearing at about 1608 cm-1 (with IR intensity 
of about 204 km mol-1) is due to a mode containing a 
significant contribution of the C=O stretching coordinate 
(along with the C=C stretching ones and in-plane CCH 
bending one – δ(CCH)). Yet another band due to the 
aromatic C=C stretching mode appearing at about 1532 cm-1 
is of appreciable IR intensity (~175 km mol-1). The lower-
frequency part of the spectrum is dominated by intensive 
bands due to CH and CH2 bending, scissoring and wagging 
modes appearing at 1414 and 1401 cm-1 (IR intensities being 
151 and 447 km mol-1 respectively) and further at about 
1220, 1198, 1180, 1170, 1143 and as low as about 1000 cm-1 
(with IR intensities varying from 100 to about 400 km mol-
1). 
 
B. Dynamical approach 
In a realistic system relevant to the present study, the 
molecules are not static, and the processes take place at 
temperatures high above absolute zero. The static quantum 
chemical approximation is therefore insufficient to account 
for all dynamical features related to drug incorporation and 
adsorption on the inner walls of nanoparticles. In the present 
pilot study, we employ the atom centered density matrix 
propagation approach (ADMP) to study the dynamical 
aspects of the tackled problem. In comparison to other 
studies related to theoretical vibrational spectroscopy of drug 
molecules, one of the main aims of the present study is to 
make a thorough comparison of the performances of variety 
of static methodologies (based on exploration of molecular 
PES and subsequent computation of the second derivative 
matrix) with the dynamical ones, such as the presently 
implemented ADMP one. From a fundamental viewpoint, 
ADMP methodology is an extended Lagrangian approach to 
molecular dynamics, based on usage of Gaussian basis 
functions, in which it is the density matrix that is being 
propagated [9]. The system’s extended Lagrangian is written 
in the form:

a Lagrangian multiplier matrix, used to impose the 
constraints on the total number of electrons in the system and 
on the idempotency of the density matrix. The Euler-
Lagrange equations for density matrix propagation may 
subsequently be obtained applying the principle of stationary 
action. These equations can be written in the form:

the velocity Verlet algorithm, under the conditions described 
technically in the Computational details section. Since we 
deal with a finite-size molecular system, periodic boundary 
conditions have not been imposed in the present study.  
From the computed ADMP molecular dynamics 
trajectory, we have subsequently computed the velocity-
velocity autocorrelation function, defined as [12]:

CONCLUSIONS AND DIRECTIONS FOR FURTHER 
WORK 
In the present study, we have carried out a theoretical 
vibrational 
spectroscopic 
study 
of 
hydrophilic 
drug 
irinotecane. Semiempirical AM1, PM3 and PM6 levels of 
theory were applied, along with the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) DFT 
level. The DFT level was found to reproduce remarkably 
well the experimental FTIR spectra of the title system. Of all 
semiempirical levels the PM6 approach was found to 
perform comparable to B3LYP. Vibrational spectra were 
also computed from ADMP molecular dynamics simulations 
at series of temperatures. The conclusions derived have 
established 
an 
appropriate 
choice 
of 
computational 
methodologies for upcoming studies of irinotecan molecule 
entrapped in PLGA/PEO-PPO-PEO nanoparticles. The 
approach elaborated in this paper has two main advantages. 
The first one concerns the computational cost of the 
prediction of IR spectral features of drug molecules (such as 
the presently studied one), which is significantly reduced by 
using appropriate semiempirical Hamiltonian, while the 
results remain of DFT-like (B3LYP) quality. The second 
advantage is the explicit account of dynamical features in 
computation of the vibrational spectra of the title system by 
using ADMP methodology.
