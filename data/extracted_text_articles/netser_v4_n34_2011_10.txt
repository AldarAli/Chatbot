Abstract — Internet processes information in the form of 
distributed digital resources, which have to be available for 
authorized usage and protected against unauthorized access. 
The implementation of these requirements is not a simple task 
because there are many ways for its realization in the modern 
congested multipurpose operation networks. The problem of 
access control can be presented as the task of identifying the 
characteristics of virtual connections by calculating the 
appropriate access code. The paper considers the aspects of the 
filtering 
algorithms 
that 
reduce 
the 
computational 
requirements of the access code and the dynamic priority 
processing of the packets in the buffer firewall.

I. INTRODUCTION  
Access control to the network resources is an 
important task of the information security. Distributed 
digital resources that have to be available for authorized 
usage, and protected against unauthorized access. In the 
modern computer networks, informational interaction is 
occurred using application protocols over virtual transport 
connections. As the result, the problem of access control can 
be presented as the task of identifying the characteristics of 
virtual connections by calculating the appropriate access 
code. 
The complexity of this problem is the fact that the 
access code can be calculated exactly only after the virtual 
connection is finished. However, in this case, the access 
control problem can’t be solved, because the access 
becomes irreversible. 
The information protection in computer systems has 
been discussed for almost 50 years. However, the well-
known methods of protection of the local data from a 
remote attacker don’t take into account the specifics of 
modern computer networks such as: 
• 
Territorial distribution and concurrency; 
• 
The dual nature of access control procedures that 
doesn’t allow to form a "security perimeter" as a 
static requirement concerning network services; 
• 
Non-locality 
of 
network 
resources 
and 
characteristics; 
• 
A semantic gap between security policy description 
and firewall configuration parameters. 
The paper considers the problem of computing the 
access code for virtual connections passing through the 
corporate firewall based on the analysis of the packets that 
form the virtual connections. The estimates of the result are 
probabilistic, but they could improve the effectiveness of 
information security introducing various mechanisms to 
control throughput of such virtual connections. 
We propose a formalism in which virtual connections 
are considered as network “meso” objects and packets are 
the “micro” ones. 
Properties of “meso” objects, such as its throughput, 
could be changed according to the security policy and the 
characteristics of the “micro” objects, which are determined 
while passing through the firewall. 
The 
proposed 
formalism 
is 
applied 
to 
the 
management task of the local user access to the external 
information resources, which are considered as network 
“macro” objects. To solve the problem of calculating the 
dynamic code we suggest using the indicator function, 
whose properties depend on the information model of the 
macro object and on the description of the access policy, 
which defines the rights of users and measured data of 
packets generated by virtual connection. 
In this paper, we propose a new approach to access 
control flexibility enhancement based on active queuing 
management mechanism and randomized preemptive 
procedure. The offered solution can be implemented by a 
firewall and can be applied in the existing network 
environments. The adaptability of the proposed mechanism 
improves 
network 
security, 
but 
it 
requires 
large 
computational resources of the firewall. The paper suggests 
the aspects of the filtering algorithms that reduce the 
computational requirements of the access code and the 
dynamic priority processing of the packets in the buffer 
firewall. 
In 
order 
to 
realize 
information 
security 
in 
multipurpose operation networks we propose: 1) the new 
classification of virtual connections (VC) based on access 
code: 
security 
VC 
characteristics 
and 
throughput 
requirements; 2) VC model, which takes into account fractal 
characteristics of packet flows; 3) randomized preemptive 
queuing management mechanism in congested operation 
networks. We use a combined method of VCs throughput 
management that unites principles of feedback and program

control within a framework for Policy-based Admission 
Control (Fig. 1): 
• 
Policy Decision Point (PDP).  
• 
Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) – security-critical 
component, which protects the resources and 
enforces the PDP's decision. 
• 
Policy Administration Point (PAP). 
 
Figure 1.  Firewall as a central component of access policy enforcement 
In this framework, firewall combines PDP and PEP 
by controlling access request and enforcing access decisions 
in real-time. In this case, access control can be considered as 
the throughput control of VC. So, access to the specific 
network resource is prohibited when the corresponding VC 
between the user and resource has no available throughput. 
Therefore from PAP firewall receives two types of access 
policy rules: packet filtering rules and data flow rules. 
The parameters of firewall rules depend on the set of 
network environment and/or protocols characteristics A. 
This set can be divided in two classes with different access 
conditions. In proposed approach, the classification decision 
is based on access code F and firewall has three modes 
according to possible F (A) values (Fig. 2): 
• 
“–1”, if the data flow is forbidden according to the 
access policy (filtering rules); 
• 
“1” and “0” for permitted VCs. 
The state of the virtual connection is controlled 
throughout its lifetime, since the value of access code for 
“meso” object could change while receiving new “micro” 
objects. 
 
Figure 2.  Data flows devision in firewall 
When the network environment is congested or when 
VCs have different QoS requirements the subset of 
permitted connection has to be divided into new subsets 
with different access codes: 
• 
“1” for prior “meso” objects that have low 
throughput and demand low stable delivery time; 
• 
“0” for background ones that demand high 
throughput 
and 
have 
no 
delivery 
time 
requirements. 
For more accurate data sorting we propose to use 
multiple priority levels. In this paper we consider the 
simplest situation with two priority levels. It is not enough 
for practice tasks so we propose some easy ways to increase 
the number of levels using subsets of permitted VCs (Fig. 
3). 
 
Figure 3.  Multiple priority level in congested operation networks 
In order to provide this classification procedure we 
proposed active queuing management mechanism, which is 
based on randomized preemptive control. Therefore in the 
firewall, the data flow throughput and time that packets 
spend in queue (minimum value for priority permitted flows 
and infinity for denied) are the functions of randomized 
control parameter α. Each of the firewall rules has a set of 
attributes, access code: identifiers of subject and object and 
the access rights from one to another. In the modern 
network environment, access rules have much more 
attributes that need to identify two subsets of permitted 
flows. Therefore the actual problem of access control within 
framework for Policy-based Admission Control is the 
flexible configuration of firewall rules, which considers 
dynamics of network environment including specific 
congested conditions. 
The paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we 
suggest the architecture of the security monitor. In Section 
III, there is a new classification of virtual connections. In 
Section IV, a model of the virtual connection is presented. 
Sections V and VI are the theoretical parts of the paper 
where the mathematical model and basic equations are 
analyzed and estimated. The Section VII is about the 
practical usage of the proposed method. The Section VIII 
concludes. 
II. SECURITY MONITOR ARCHITECTURE 
Computer network security is a main issue of modern 
information 
infrastructure. 
This 
infrastructure 
stores 
information in the form of distributed digital resources, 
which have to be protected against unauthorized access. 
However, the implementations of this statement are far from

simple due to the dynamic nature of the network 
environment and users activity [1]. 
The virtual connection can be described entirely only 
when it is closed, but in this case, it will not allow us to 
provide the required level of information security. While we 
receive information from the VC, there is always the non-
zero probability that the VC’s properties have been wrongly 
estimated. In this paper, we consider the architecture of 
security telematics device that have to decrease this 
probability using multiple sources of information: 
• 
current data about network traffic that the firewall 
receives from packet headers fields; 
• 
current data about network environment and users 
from IDS and special user-activity monitor; 
• 
prior data from informational resource model about 
expected traffic properties. 
So below we describe a new approach to configure 
the security network appliances, which allows an 
administrator to overcome the semantic gap between 
security policy requirements, the ability to configure the 
firewall filtering rules [2] and to decrease the wrong VC’s 
properties estimation probability. The architecture of the 
proposed system is presented in Fig. 4.

Network monitor controls the whole system. 
Network environment state consists of three main parts: 
• 
“User activity” is the information about what 
computer is currently used by which user. This 
information can be obtained from Microsoft Active 
Directory (AD) by means of LDAP protocol. 
• 
“Shared hardware resources” is the information 
about network infrastructure and shared internal 
resources that can be described by network 
environment state vector Xk 
• 
“Network state” is the information about external 
network channel received from Intrusion Detection 
Systems (IDS). 
B. Access policy description module 
Filtering rules of a firewall in itself are a formalized 
expression of an access policy. An access policy may 
simply specify some restrictions, e.g., “Mr. Black shouldn’t 
work with Youtube” without the refinement of the nature of 
“Mr. Black” and “work” [2],[3]. 
There is a common structure of access policy 
requirements, which uses the notions of subject, action and 
object. Thus, the informally described requirement “Mr. 
Black shouldn’t work with Youtube” can be formally 
represented as the combination of the subject “Mr. Black”, 
the action “read”, the object “www.youtube.com” and the 
decision “prohibit”. This base can also be augmented by a 
context, which specifies various additional requirements 
restricting the cases of rule’s application, e.g.: time, 
previous actions of the subject, attributes’ values of the 
subject or object, etc. 
However, access rules, which are based on the 
notions of subject, action and object are not sufficient alone 
to implement complex real-world policies. As a result, new 
approaches have been developed. One of them, Role Based 
Access Control (RBAC) [4], uses the notion of role. A role 
replaces a subject in access rules and it’s more invariant. 
Identical roles may be used in multiple information systems 
while subjects are specific to a particular system. As an 
example, remember the roles of a system administrator and 
unprivileged user that are commonly used while configuring 
various systems. Administrator-subjects (persons) may be 
added or removed while an administrator-role and its rules 
are not changing. 
However, every role must be associated with some 
subjects as only rules with subjects can be finally enforced. 
During policy specification roles must be created firstly, 
then access rules must be specified with references to these 
roles, then the roles must be associated with subjects. 
The OrBAC [5] model expands the traditional model 
of Role Based Access Control. It brings in the new notions 
of activity, view and abstract context. An activity is to 
replace an action, i.e., its meaning is analogous to the 
meaning of a role for a subject. A view is to replace an 
object. “Entertainment resources” can be an example of 
view, and “read” or “write” can be examples of an activity. 
Thus, the notions of role, activity, view and abstract context 
finally make up an abstract level of an access policy. 
OrBAC model allows to specify the access rules only on an 
abstract level using the abstract notions. Those are called the 
abstract rules. For instance, an abstract rule “user is 
prohibited to read entertainment resources”, where “user” is 
a role, “read” is an activity, and “entertainment resources” is 
a view. The rules for subjects, actions and objects are called 
concrete access rules.

To specify an OrBAC policy, a common language, 
XACML (eXtensible Access Control Markup Language) 
was introduced. The language maintains the generality of 
policy’s specification while OrBAC provides additional 
notions for convenient editing. 
C. Firewall rules generator 
There is a feature common for all firewalls: they 
execute an access policy. In common representation, the 
main function of access control device (ACD) is to decide 
whether a subject should be permitted to perform an action 
with an object. A common access rule “Mr. Black is 
prohibited to read www.youtube.com”. 
As was mentioned above, “Mr. Black” is a subject, 
“HTTP service on www.youtube.com” is an object, and  
reading is an action. So the configuration of ACD consists 
of common access rules that reference the subjects, actions 
and objects. 
Although a firewall as an ACD must be configured 
with common access rules, each implementation uses its 
own specific configuration language. The language is often 
hardware dependent, reflecting the features of firewall’s 
internal architecture, and usually being represented by a set 
of firewall rules. Each rule has references to host addresses 
and other network configuration parameters. An example of 
the verbal description of a firewall rule may go as follows: 
Host with IP address 10.0.0.10 is prohibited to 
establish TCP connections on HTTP port of host with 
IP address 208.65.153.238. 
The main complexity of this approach is to find out  
how such elementary firewall rules could be obtained from 
common access rules. 
Each firewall vendor reasonably aims at increasing 
its sales appeal while offering various tools for convenient 
editing of firewall rules.  However, so far the problem of 
obtaining firewall rules from common access rules is not 
resolved in general. Moreover, this problem has not been 
paid much attention to. 
The most obvious issue concerning this problem is 
that additional information beyond access rules is necessary 
in order to obtain the firewall rules. This information 
concerns the configuration of network services and the 
parameters of network protocols that are used for data 
exchange – “network configuration”. In general, it can be 
stored among the descriptions of subjects, actions and 
objects. An example: 
Mr.Black: host with IP-address = 10.0.0.10; 
www.youtube.com: HTTP service (port 80) on host with 
IP-address = 208.65.153.238. 
Thus, the final firewall rules can be obtained by 
addition of the object descriptions to the access rules. It 
should be noted that even for small and especially for 
medium and large enterprises it is necessary to store and 
manage the network configuration separately from the 
security policy. The suggested approach allows us to 
achieve this goal: the security officer can edit the access 
rules with reference to real objects while the network 
administrator can edit the parameters of the network objects 
[2]. 
It should also be noted that there is no need to 
specify any fixed rules regarding association of the network 
parameters with the objects. For instance, HTTP port may 
be a parameter of an object or it may be a parameter of an 
action. A criterion is that the most natural representation of 
access policy must be achieved. 
While generating the rules, the parameters of 
network objects can be automatically retrieved from various 
data catalogs. DNS is the best example of a world-wide 
catalog, which stores the network addresses. Microsoft 
offers the network administrators the powerful means, 
Active Directory, to store information about users. 
Integration with the above mentioned technologies greatly 
simplifies the work of a security officer as he has only to 
specify the correct name of an object while forming firewall 
rules. 
D. Information resource model 
Interaction between subject and object in computer 
network can be presented as a set of virtual connections. 
Virtual connections can be classified as technological virtual 
connections (TVC) or information virtual connections 
(IVC). (see Fig. 5).

Figure 5.  Layers of access control policies. 
To implement the policy of access control, the 
filtering rules are decomposed in the form of TVC and IVC. 
These filtering rules can be configured for different levels of 
the data flow description based on the network packet fields 
at the levels of channel, transport, and application protocols. 
At different layers of access control policy model, 
the filtering rules have to take into account various 
parameters of network environment and objects. At the 
packet filter layer, a firewall considers standards static 
protocol fields described by RFC. At the layer of TVC, 
firewall enforces the stateful inspection using finite 
automata describing states of transport layer protocols. On 
the upper layer of IVC firewall must consider a-priori 
information about subject and object of network interaction 
[6]. 
As was mentioned above, the information about 
subject can be obtained from catalog services by LDAP 
protocol, e.g. Microsoft Active Directory.

According to existing approach [7] a resource model 
can be presented in: 
1) logical aspect – an N-dimensional resource space model 
[8]; 
2) representation aspect - the definition based on standard 
high-level description languages like XML or OWL 
[9]; 
3) location aspect – the physical storage model of the 
resource including resource address. 
All these approaches describe the network resource 
as a whole but don’t take into account the specific access 
control task. Any remote network resource can be fully 
classified when the connection between this resource and 
local user would be closed. So it is necessary to control all 
virtual connections in real time while monitoring traffic for 
security purpose. 
In this paper, we propose to implement a special 
service external to the firewall that would collect, store and 
renew information about remote network objects. It should 
automatically create information resource model, describing 
all informational virtual connections that have to be 
established to receive this resource. This service should 
periodically renew information about resource to keep it 
alive. 
Firewall should cooperate with this external service 
to receive information resource model and enforce access 
policy requirements. 
E. Algebra of filtering rules 
As was mentioned above, the information security is 
defined by an access policy that consists of access rules. 
Each of these rules has an access code, a set of attributes; 
the basic ones among them are identifiers of subject and 
object and the rights of access from one to another. In 
TCP/IP-based distributed systems, access rules have 
additional attributes that help to identify flows of packets 
(sessions) between the client and network application 
server. Generally these attributes identify the network 
subjects and objects at different layers of TCP/IP interaction 
model: MAC-addresses at link layer, IP-addresses at 
network layer, port numbers at transport layer and some 
parameters of application protocols. 
The access policy in large distributed informational 
system consists of a huge number of rules that are stored 
and executed in different access control appliances. The 
generation of the access policy for such appliances is not 
very difficult: information must be made available for 
authorized use, while sensitive data must be protected 
against unauthorized access. However, its implementation 
and correct usage is a complex process that is error-prone. 
Therefore the actual problem of rule generation is 
representation, analysis and optimization of access policy 
for large distributed network systems with lots of firewall 
filtering rules. In our papers, we proposed an approach to 
description, testing and verification of access policy by the 
means of specific algebra with carrier being the set of 
firewall filtering rules. According to proposed approach we 
define a ring as algebraic structure over set of filtering rules 
or R [10]. 
III. VIRTUAL CONNECTION CLASSIFICATION 
In this paper, we use the term “access management” 
as the combination of access control and traffic management. 
Access control is the basic technical method of information 
security in the computer networks. It is providing 
confidentiality by blocking the denied data streams, 
availability by permitting legal connections and integrity by 
reducing the risk of data modification or destruction. 
Confidentiality, integrity and availability are the core 
principles of information security. Access control is based on 
subject-object model, where subjects are the entities that can 
perform actions in the system and influence the environment 
condition and objects are the entities representing passive 
elements between which access need to be controlled. Data 
flows between objects and subjects named virtual 
connections. As it was mentioned before, the virtual 
connection is the type of information interaction between 
applications on object and subject by means of formation 
one-way or duplex packet stream, and also the logical 
organization of the network resources necessary for such 
interaction. 
Computer network can be considered as the set of 
such VCs. In classical subject-object model the set of VCs is 
divided into two subsets by security characteristic: 
• 
Non forbidden connections that do not harm the 
protected information; 
• 
Forbidden 
connections 
that 
can 
low 
the 
confidentiality, integrity or availability of protected 
information. 
From another point of view the set of VCs can be 
divided into several subsets by the type of transmittable 
information and its quality of service request: 
• 
priority ones, which demand low stable delivery 
time; 
• 
non-priority ones, which demand high throughput 
and have no delivery time requirements. 
The last subset of non-priority VCs also could be 
divided into several subsets with different priority levels. So 
in this paper, we present the simplest example with three 
subsets: 
1) priority non forbidden connections; 
2) background non forbidden connections; 
3) forbidden connections.

Figure 6.  Virtual connections classification model 
As it was described there are always type I and type II 
classification errors, but using additional information in 
proposed architecture of security monitor we are trying to 
minimize them. 
On Fig. 6 there is graphical interpretation of 
considered classification. 
IV. VIRTUAL CONNECTION MODEL 
The modeling of the VC behavior has received 
considerable attention in recent years. In this paper, we 
present a simple model of VC. Each connection can be 
described by several parameters: 
)
,
,
,
( ,
Vc S O Th Type Fr
 
where 
S,O
 are the subject and object of information 
interaction, Th  – virtual connection throughput, Type  – the 
resource requirements, Fr  – fractal nature of VC. 
From this point of view we suggest to divide set of 
virtual connections into two subsets by Fr  characteristic: 
• 
fractal natured virtual connections based on 
transport 
protocols 
with 
feedback 
(TCP 
connections; 
• 
data flows without fractal properties like UDP data 
streams. 
Researches have shown that fractal properties of VCs 
influence its throughput. For calculation the average 
throughput of TCP connection it is necessary to create a 
model of connection with fractal properties. 
In this paper, we suggest to use a simple discrete 
time model of TCP connection: at each discreet time 
moments “k” TCP throughput “Th” can be describes by 
formulas:

As it is known from an example of Cantor set the 
fractal properties appears at loss of the set’s part. Fractal 
properties of TCP-connection characterize the throughput 
losses because of feedback mechanism. On Fig. 7 there are 
shown the throughput losses because of CWND adaptation 
mechanism. 
 
Figure 7.  TCP throughput losses because of CWND mechanism 
We suggest using different algorithms to calculate 
the throughput of VC with fractal properties and without 
ones. 
For the connections of type 2 without fractal 
properties we will use the simple formula:

shown on Fig. 8.

V. MODEL OF NETWORK ENVIRONMENT 
According to the VC models written above we 
consider the preemptive priority queueing system with two 
types of customers. First type of customers has priority over 
the second one. The customers of the type 1 (2) arrive into

the buffer according to the Poisson process with rate 
1
λ  
(
2
λ ). The service time has the exponential distribution with 
the same rate µ  for each type. The service times are 
independent of the arrival processes. The buffer has a finite 
size k  (
1< k < ∞
) and it is shared by both types of 
customers. The absolute priority in service is given to the 
customers of the first type. Unlike typical priority queueing 
considered system is supplied by the randomized push-out 
mechanism that helps precisely and accurate to manage 
customers of both types. If the buffer is full, a new coming 
customer of the first type can push out of the buffer a 
customer of type 2 with the probability α . We have to 
mention that if α =1 we retrieve the standard non-
randomized push-out. 
The scheme described priority queueing is resulted on 
Fig. 9. The priority queueing without the push-out 
mechanism (
α = 0
) and with the determined push-out 
mechanism (
α =1
) are well-studied. The concept of the 
randomized push-out mechanism with reference to network 
and telecommunication problems is offered in [12] where 
this mechanism was combined with relative priority, instead 
of absolute, as in our case.

In the modified by G.P.Basharin Kendel notation, the 
general structure of a label and sense of its separate 
positions remains, however in each position the vectorial 
symbolic is used [13]. There is an additional symbol 
if j
, 
where i  specifies priority type (0 – without a priority, 1 – 
relative, 2 – absolute), and j  specifies a type of the pushing 
out mechanism (0 – without pushing out, 2 – the determined 
pushing out). So
j =1
 wasn’t used. In [12], authors offer to 
use this value for the randomized push-out mechanism, as 
an intermediate between variants 
j = 0
 and
j = 2
. So, using 
this new notation, system represented on Fig. 9 has

The history of one-channel two data-flow priority 
systems research includes already more than half a century, 
however, as far as we know, there is only one work [12] 
where the randomized push-out mechanism have been 
studied (in a combination with the relative priority for 
queueing

 type). At the same time, for the 
typical models with the push-out mechanism (
j = 0
 and 
j = 2
) the problem is solved basically. 
Problems of research priority queueing have arisen in 
telecommunication with the analysis of real disciplines of 
scheduling in operating computers. Last years a similar sort 
of queueing model, and also their various generalizations 
are widely used at the theoretical analysis of Internet 
systems. 
As has been shown in [12], the probability pushing 
out mechanism is more convenient and effective in 
comparison with other mathematical models of pushing out 
considered in the literature. It adequately describes real 
processes of the network traffic and is simple enough from 
the mathematical point of view. The randomized push-out 
mechanism helps precisely traffic management and security. 
Another control and security factor is the telematics device 
buffer size. It can be varied to increase the throughput of 
necessary connections and reduce throughput of suspicious 
ones.

Exploring these formulas we found some useful 
properties of this system described in this article. One of 
them presented on Fig.11, 12. When incoming stream of 
priority packets getting more intensive, system starts to 
prohibit admission of non-priority packets. While the total 
flow rate is less than unity (
1
2
1
ρ
+ ρ
≤ ), the probability of 
loss is equal to zero. This means that the system is fully 
copes with the load (see Fig.11). In Figure 12, the graph 
does not start from zero because the system is initially 
overloaded with non-priority packets. Same effect and in 
this case. 
On Fig. 13 an expected result can be seen that the 
probability of losing priority packet decreases with 
increasing size of a buffer, but not as much as has been 
expected. Probability of loss is decreasing not more than 5% 
for small values of α. Therefore, only for large probability 
values increasing buffer size effectively influences the 
losses. For priority stream influence of this effect is the 
same for all values of alpha, but for non-priority packets the 
situation is different. Figure 14 shows that it is sometimes 
advantageous to have a buffer of smaller size. With a small 
buffer probability of be pushed out much lower, what 
explains this effect.

Next interesting variable is average queue length of 
priority packets (see Fig.15, 16, 17), computing as (3). 
While the system is not loaded, the average queue length is 
zero, as shown in the bottom of the chart (see Fig. 13). But 
once the system begins to fill, then average queue length 
begins to grow rapidly. And as seen in the Figures 15, 16, 
17, that by using the α  be strong enough to influence the 
filling of the queue. In some cases, change the setting at 0.1 
entails the complete filling of the queue.

According to the packet’s mark (Forbidden, Priority,

Background) the period that packet spend in queue can vary 
from 1 to 1014 times, which can be used to control access to 
information resource providing confidentiality.

For highly congested network the priority type is 
much less important, than the push-out mechanism and the 
value of α  parameter. The push-out mechanism allows to 
enforce access policy using traffic priority mechanism.  
By choosing α  parameter we can change the time 
that packets spend in the firewall buffer, which allows to 
limit access possibilities of background traffic and to block 
forbidden packets. So by decreasing the priority of 
background VCs and increasing the push-out probability α  
we can reduce the VC throughput to low level without 
interrupting it.

The most wide range of control can be reached in 
intermediate environment conditions when linear law of the 
losses has already been broken, but the saturation zone has 
not been reached yet. Numerical experiment [17] has been 
made to detect conditions in which 
 varied over a wide 
range from 0,1 to 2,5, and few fixed values for 
. 
VII. PRACTICAL USAGE AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.  
Good example of opportunity to use such mechanism 
is the problem of controlling removed robotic object, which 
telemetry data and a video stream are transmitted on global 
networks. In this case, control commands are transmitted by 
TCP, and a video stream data are transmitted by UDP. A 
mean values of throughput of our robotic object: throughput 
of TCP channel (control and telemetry packets) ~100Kb/s, 
throughput of UDP video stream ~1,2Mb/s. 
 
 
Figure 21.  The scheme of space experiment "Contour" 
In a considered example on Fig. 21 (ROKVISS 
mission [18]), the choice of a priority of service and loss-
probability of a priority packet 
 allows to balance such 
indicators of functioning of a network, as loss-probability of 
control packets 
 and quality of video stream for various 
conditions of a network environment. The parameter 
 can 
vary for delay minimization in a control system’s feedback. 
The given problem is important for interactive 
control of remote real-time dynamic objects, in a case when 
the complex computer network is the component of a 
feedback control contour, therefore minimization of losses 
and 
feedback 
delays, 
is 
the 
important 
parameter 
characterizing an effectiveness of control system. 
In future, this method of preemptive access 
management could be used in new joint space experiment 
METERON-R 
(Multi-purpose 
Experimental 
TElecommunication Robotic Operations Network - Russia) 
that will be carried out on ground and on-board the ISS, in 
order to research efficiency and security of robotic 
operations in space and ground environments, including the 
configuration of robotic control systems as a part of 
multipurpose operations network (Fig. 22). The joint 
experiments will focus on the analysis of how well 
astronauts can operate complex robotic systems based on 
operation networks with mobility and manipulation 
capability from within the highly constrained ISS and 
micro-gravity environment. Multiple human-robot interfaces 
will be used in combination, while simulating realistic 
robotic 
remote 
operations 
with 
round-trip 
time 
communication conditions representative of future human 
planet exploration missions. 
 
Figure 22.  The scheme of space experiment "METERON-R" 
For communication experiments, the primary focus 
will be on the usage of real-time duplex commanding, in 
combination 
with 
Delay 
Tolerant 
Network 
(DTN) 
approaches and Inmarsat channel. Real-time channel will 
have low delay (15-20 ms) and high throughput (4 Mb/s), 
but the connection would be established only when the 
space station is in the radio-optical range (7-10 min). DTN 
channels have high delay and low throughput, but function 
for 24/7. Inmarsat channel characteristics are between real-
time and DTN and they are much depend on quantity of 
retransmission satellites. 
Robotics objects within multipurpose operation 
network would execute the programs and interact without 
human involvement. However there would be always 
situations when the robot couldn’t make a decision by its 
own. In that case, the human-operator will have several 
opportunities: 
1) remote telecontrol through real-time channel; 
2) to send several commands or additional data through 
Inmarsat channel; 
3) to send new program through DTN. 
Each of these data will have its own priority level. So 
in this case, two types of priority are not enough for traffic 
management 
in 
multipurpose 
operation 
network 
environment, but the recurrent mode of proposed procedure 
can increase the number of priority VCs subsets.

VIII. CONCLUSION.  
1. The offered access control approach allows more 
deeply and more detailed understanding of requirements of 
access policy in the form of firewall configuration rules. 
2. In multipurpose operation networks, we propose a 
new formalism in which the distributed digital resources are 
considered as “macro” objects, virtual connections are the 
network "meso" ones and packets are the “micro” objects. 
Proposed formalism allows to enforce security policy and 
provides 
authorized 
usage 
and 
protection 
against 
unauthorized access.  
3. Proposed model based on DiffServ approach 
considers computer network as the set of VCs, which 
throughput is easy controlled by proposed classification 
procedure and algorithm that divides the set of non forbidden 
VCs in two subsets: non forbidden priority connections and 
non forbidden non priority or background connections. 
4. Introduced VC model takes into account several 
parameters such as: dynamic and statistics characteristics 
including fractal properties of VC with feedback throughput 
control like TCP. 
5. Considered preemptive queueing mechanism can be 
viewed as a background for DiffServ access control because 
it provides a wide range packet loss probability ratio using 
flexible randomized push-out algorithm. 
6. Proposed push-out algorithm based on selecting 
priority parameter controls packet loss probability taking into 
account restricted capacity of packet buffer in DiffServ 
access point. The most interesting result obtained in 
congested network allows to keep priority VC throughput 
near the requested value, which is important for specific 
space experiment with robotics arm on ISS board. 
7. We described the future usage of proposed formalism 
in joint space experiment where several types of operations 
are serviced by security monitor in multipurpose operation 
network.
