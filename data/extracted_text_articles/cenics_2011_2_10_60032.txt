Abstract—In this paper, the design of an original fully 
integrated band-pass filter at 4 GHz using low-aspect ratio 
Through Silicon Vias (TSVs) is presented. Response of the 
filter has been simulated within a single BGA (Ball-Grid 
Array) package implemented on a Rogers substrate. 
Simulations have been performed with the help of a FEM 
(Finite Element Method) 3D EM (Electro-Magnetic) simulator. 
Prior to filter implementation, a comparison between 
simulated and measured data is proposed on both 3D solenoids 
and the package in order to calibrate the simulator and 
validate the simulation methodology. The obtained simulation 
results are successfully correlated to measurement results. 
Then the filter is built taking into account the previously 
defined building blocks (solenoids + packaging) and optimized 
by taking into account its global environment. The proposed 
solution allows a clear reduction of the filter footprint 
compared to discrete devices based implementation. The total 
area of the filter is 3.6 mm x 2.4 mm. The insertion loss and 
return loss at 4 GHz are about 2.6 dB and 16 dB respectively.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The concept of 3D packaging using TSV stacking is one 
of the most promising technologies. It can extend Moore’s 
law by stacking and shortening the connection path between 
memory and logic [1]. Due to the increase in functional 
integration requirements, more and more assembly house 
and wafer foundries are looking into 3D TSV technology, 
which allows stacking of Large Scale Circuits (LSI’s) 
thereby enabling products to be made smaller with more 
functionality. 3D technology realizes miniaturization up to 
300-400% compared to the conventional packaging [2]. 
Furthermore TSVs are also relevant to develop “more than 
Moore” applications [3], where passive functions originally 
lying on the PCB (Printed Circuit Board) can be designed 
with the help of TSVs using original component 
architectures such as embedded solenoids (see Fig. 1).  In 
that sense, distributed L, C filters based on TSVs can be 
investigated and implemented within interconnect dies. 
Indeed, the increasing demand of the wireless 
communications applications requires the radio frequency 
(RF) receiver to be operated in multiple frequency bands so 
that users can access different services with a single handset. 
In designing the RF receivers, a band pass filter (BPF) is 
added to perform the filtering of unwanted signals and to 
pass the signal of the specific frequency from the antenna. 
Filters are either integrated on chip (using planar coils and 
Metal-Oxide-Metal (MOM) capacitors) or integrated in a 
hybrid application such as MCM (Multi-Chip Module) lying 
on a ceramic or organic substrate using a micro strip 
architecture.

Some well known structures have been already 
successfully implemented and reported [4]. For the former 
ones, they can suffer from their low quality factors (mainly 
due to the resistive losses within the planar coils) while the 
latter ones exhibit high performances but can deviate a lot 
from nominal behavior compared to silicon due to process 
spread. An other alternative also consists in implementing 
the filters on top of the carrier substrate (Printed Circuit 
Board for example) with the help of Surface Mounted 
Devices (SMDs). The main advantage of such approach is 
the high quality factor value that can be reached, but 
generally they have limited performances at higher 
frequencies, the total footprint is bigger and the lack of 
accurate and scalable electrical models limits their 
applications and implementation in view of a high selectivity 
of the signals. 
In case of fully integrated filters within silicon IC 
processes, some passive integration dedicated processes have

been already developed to tackle the low quality factor of the 
unit components. Devices are generally deposited on HRS 
(High Resistive Substrate) that clearly limits the effects of 
eddy currents [3]. Thick top metals are also implemented and 
copper is often used to reduce the resistive losses. Thickness 
up to 8 um can be considered in certain cases. Recent 
achievements have highlighted really good performances for 
band-pass filter for TV on Mobile applications [5]. For this 
application, coils exhibit regular planar shape, which 
provides a good compromise for designers between ease of 
layout and manufacturing and the electrical performances. 
On the other side, together with the emergence of new type 
of interconnects such as TSVs, embedded solenoid 
implementation within silicon or glass substrate [6] is now 
considered to easily build a coil-type structure. Several 
proposals have been done in that sense leading to very 
promising results [7][8]. In fact, integrated solenoids can be 
used to produce larger quality factor than in RF 
BiCMOS/CMOS planar technologies within a given 
footprint [9]. This increase in quality factor can be attributed 
to both metal thickness and the specific solenoid property of 
storing energy according to:

So, in this paper, we propose to take advantage of TSVs 
implemented with thick patterned metals within an IPD 
(Integrated Passive Devices) process to design a band-pass 
filter at 4 GHz. The paper will be organized as follows: 
Integrated solenoid as well as MOM capacitance will be 
introduced in the first part; their performances will be 
presented from an electrical point of view together with their 
relative precision taking into account the process spread. 
Solenoid performances obtained from wide-band frequency 
2-ports S-parameters measurements will be presented. EM 
(Electro Magnetic) modeling done with the help of a 3D 
FEM solver will be also described and compared to 
measurements. 
As the effect of packaging plays a significant role on the 
device performances, the second part of this study will be 
devoted to the characterization of a conventional QFN 
package using a very single test-case. Measurement data will 
be then used to calibrate the EM simulator. 
In the third part of this paper, we report the design 
methodology and the simulation results for a 4 GHz band-
pass Chebyshev filter done using TSVs.  
II. 
3D INTEGRATED SOLENOIDS 
A. Solenoid geometry description 
We have already reported the fact that 3D TSV based 
solenoid can be implemented within a silicon die [9]. This 
process has been developed by IPDiA (formally NXP 
semiconductors). Our 3D solenoid uses the thickness of the 
silicon as the third dimension. Indeed each turn of our 
solenoid is fabricated with the TSV as the vertical sides. A 
front side and back side metallization of the bulk wafer leads 
to connect the top and the bottom tracks, thanks to the TSV, 
allowing creating loops embedded within the silicon. 
Thereby we obtain a square section 3D solenoid architecture. 
On the top side of the silicon, a second level of metal is also 
used to realize MOM capacitors with a density of 100 
pF/mm2. 
Copper is deposited onto front and back sides of a 300 
µm depth high resistivity silicon substrate (HRS) according 
to a pattern defined in Fig. 2. The vias are partially filled 
with the same metal on the external sides as highlighted by 
the SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) picture in Fig. 1b. 
Consequently N-turns 3D solenoids consist of N elementary 
spirals placed side by side and connected in the direction of 
the pitch between two consecutive vias. Due to the TSV 
technology process, parameters such as via diameter and via 
height are fixed and so can not be modified. In our case, the 
aspect ratio AR (height/diameter) is equal to 4. To avoid 
mechanical stress, the pitch between two vias is set to a 
minimum value equal to 125 µm. Nevertheless the 
dimension of the metal tracks in front and back sides can be 
modified in order to improve the intrinsic component 
electrical characteristics as suggested by [10]. Hence the 
solenoid is defined according to its number of turns N, its 
width Dy and the metal track width W (that can be different 
between top and bottom traces). A change in the metal tracks 
width will also impact the spacing SP between two 
consecutive metal tracks.

B. Solenoid measurements 
To support our theoretical investigations, solenoids with 
1 to 5 turns were designed and grown on silicon. Then the 
designed test-case inductors have been placed within 
conventional GSG pads (Fig. 3)  and measured using a 
network analyzer PNA8364B from Agilent Technologies, 
with high frequency micro-probes. Full two ports S-
parameters were performed for each device up to 20 GHz. 
During the RF characterization, the wafer was stacked to a 
grounded chuck to ensure a global reference ground to the 
wafer, the network analyzer and the micro-probes. If no 
precautions are taken, a short circuit appears between the 
grounded chuck and the bottom metal tracks of the wafer. As 
a consequence, a sheet of glass fiber (~100 µm thick, εr = 
4.5) has been placed between them. For each measured 
devices, self-inductance value and quality factor have been 
extracted on five crystals. In [9], we have already shown that 
the self-inductance variation versus the number of turns N 
was really close to a linear law, suggesting a very low 
inductive coupling between the loops. This is due to the 
24

minimum pitch defined by the process that is relatively large 
(=125 µm). As a consequence, the capacitive coupling is also 
reduced, which allows using the inductors at several GHz. 
Furthermore, due to the typical geometry of the solenoid, the 
quality factor is improved up to several GHz compared to 
classical planar IC coils either in CMOS or BiCMOS 
processes. A physical lumped elements electrical model was 
proposed also in [9] to simulate the device behavior versus 
frequency. This model is indeed really helpful to generate 
contour plots in order to pick-up the right solenoid 
parameters (N, W, Dy, SP) and thus decrease the design 
iterations. By the way, as any other compact model, it is not 
correlated to the global environment of the device (parasitic 
coupling, ground rails …). So in view of designing passive 
filters, we have developed an EM (Electro Magnetic) based 
model.

C. 3D solenoid modeling 
 Dedicated test-cases presented in the previous paragraph 
have been simulated using the 3D FEM solver EMPro from 
Agilent. First, TSVs have been defined within the substrate 
stack taking into account the partial fill of the vias with 
copper, the barrier between the copper and the silicon bulk 
(to avoid copper diffusion in the silicon). Geometry of the 
vias is also simplified: the circular shape of the TSVs is 
converted to an octagonal one, in order to speed-up the mesh 
and thus the simulation time without losing any accuracy on 
the results. Bulk silicon has been described with the help of 
its relative dielectric permittivity (εr=11.9) and its resistivity 
- equal to 1000 Ω.cm. A comparison between both self-
inductance value and quality factor against frequency is 
presented in Fig. 4. Self-inductance and quality factor values 
have been extracted according to the following relations:

solenoïd (a): self inductance value (b) quality factor and 2-turns solenoid 
(c): self-inductance value (d) quality factor 
From the available test-cases, a pretty good agreement is 
found for the self-inductance as well as the quality factor 
variations versus frequency. The SRF (Self-Resonant-
Frequency) is also well predicted suggesting that the parallel 
capacitances are also well evaluated with the proposed 
approach. Typically, a difference of 3 % is observed on the 
self-inductance value and 10% on the overall variations of 
the quality factor. This validates our approach that will be 
used to design a 3D solenoid based passive filter. By the 
way, these measurements and simulations have been 
performed on-wafer without any coating on top of the 
substrate. In the following part of this paper, we propose to 
study a single test-case combining a chip, a package and a 
line on a board to validate our EM tool for packaging 
applications also.

III. 
PACKAGE MEASUREMENTS AND MODELING 
Indeed, 
the 
emerging 
applications 
of 
wireless 
communications require effective low-cost approaches to 
microwave and RF packaging to meet the demand of the 
commercial marketplace. In that sense, surface mountable 
packages and especially plastic packages are a cost effective 
solution for low-cost assembly and packaging. However, 
plastic packages, whatever their types (standard QFN or flip-
chip based solutions such as BGA) contain unavoidable 
parasitic elements. As a consequence, development of 
characterization techniques for surface mounted packages is 
motivated by the need to predict the parasitic behavior of 
packages at microwave frequencies. In fact, the capability of 
accurately and easily characterizing packages provides a 
means to study and correctly model their high frequency 
behavior. Work in the literature relies mainly on EM 
simulations [11][12]. In this paper, we will present an “on-
wafer” method of measuring the microwave performances of 
a chain containing a chip, a package and 50 Ω line on Rogers 
substrate. Final goal of this part is to calibrate the EM 
simulator (in our case EMPro from Agilent) based on this 
single test-case. 
A. Test-case description and measurement 
One of the main problems of package characterization is 
that the terminals of the lead-frame are not accessible 
without significant modification to the investigated structure. 
To overcome the need for this modification, we have divided 
the test-case into three main parts. A photograph of the test-
case is provided on Fig. 5. 
So the first part of the test-case is a BiCMOS (NXP in 
house process) silicon die containing a coplanar line. The 
line is designed in such a way that it allows GSG probing 
with conventional micro-probes from Cascade micro-tech. 
This line is then connected with the help of 4 bond wires (2 
for the signal and 2 for each ground path) to the pins of the 
package. Classical 20 µm diameter gold bond-wires have 
been considered for this study. Then, to be able to measure 
the electrical characteristics of the package, it is mounted 
onto a RO4003C substrate from Rogers Corporation 
(thickness = 406 µm, εr = 3.38, tan δ = 2.7e-3). A specific 
coplanar access is also designed on the substrate allowing 
also GSG probing (bottom side of the photograph in Fig. 5). 
In order to perform 2-ports S-parameters measurements, 
the package is then opened to access the GSG pads on the 
chip. Prior to measurements, a SOLT calibration is 
performed. Four test-cases have been measured up to 50 
GHz to ensure a good reproducibility of the measurements. 
Results are presented in Fig. 6. 
The first results clearly show a good reproducibility 
between the measurements. Insertion and Return loss of the 
total chain are respectively equal to -1.3 and -10 dB at 4 
GHz, which makes such a package suitable for several GHz 
applications. Of course, many improvements can be 
considered 
to 
improve 
these 
performances 
(ground 
connection, wire loop profile, down bonds implementation). 
But, these techniques won’t be addressed in this paper.

B. Package modeling 
The aim of this paragraph is to calibrate the 3D FEM 
solver EMPro from Agilent to correctly handle the S-
parameters variations of the previously measured test-case. 
The 3D EM model should estimate the electrical 
performances of the package as accurately as possible, but on 
the other hand, should not be too complex for the EM 
simulations of more complex block. The following 
methodology has been applied: 
• 
Bond wires cross-section have been first described 
with a square shape. Generally speaking, all round 
shapes should be avoided as much as possible as 
they are really time consuming for the simulations 
and the 3D mesh generation. 
• 
Bond wire profiles were estimated based on a circle 
shape assumption as proposed by Alimenti and al. 
[13].

• 
Package terminals are defined into two equal steps 
(each is 100 µm thick) to have accurate modeling of 
the thick metal. One should try also to approximate 
their geometries with a few corner points as possible 
but the modifications should not affect the electrical 
response of the simulator. 
• 
Coplanar ports have been used on both the chip and 
substrate lines. 
• 
All dielectrics are defined with finite bricks taking 
into account their relative permittivity and the loss 
tangent or the conductivity. Plastic brick is open 
with an “Air” brick in order to stick as much as 
possible to the measurement configuration. 
• 
The common ground reference was set to the bottom 
metal of the Rogers substrate 
 
Both reflection and transmission S-parameters obtained 
from EM simulations are plotted on Fig. 6 together with 
measured data. The simulated data corroborates the 
measured ones with a good accuracy up to several tenth of 
gigahertz. To conclude this part, the EM simulation tool 
enables relatively accurate and complex package analysis. So 
based on these two previously studied test-cases (solenoid 
and package) the FEM solver is calibrated and ready for 
embedded filter design with TSVs. 
IV. 
FILTER DESIGN AND MODELING 
Based on the previous building blocks that have been 
studied here before (i.e., package and solenoid measurements 
together with EM modeling), this part will focus on the 
design feasibility of a 4GHz band-pass filter. Objective is to 
design a band pass filter with a maximum of 4dB insertion 
loss.  
A. Schematic design 
In a first time, a third order Chebyshev architecture has 
been considered to design the filter prototype. By the way, 
taking into account coefficient in [14] and applying the well 
known transform from low-pass to band-pass filter, lead to 
an inductor value in the serial electrical path that is equal to 
9.13 nH. Such an inductor will have a high serial electrical 
resistance that will seriously affect the insertion loss of the 
overall filter and will also have a Self-Resonant Frequency to 
close to operating frequency clearly limiting its usage. So, a 
choice has been made to split the filter into two different 
parts as shown on Fig. 7 and already proposed in [5]. The 
first part is a 5th order low-pass filter while the second one is 
a 3rd order band-stop filter. Both are Chebyshev filters. By 
doing this, only MOM capacitors and small inductances 
values (i.e., 451 pH for L6 and L10) will be present in the 
serial path of the filters. This approach allows reaching the 
specified level of insertion loss. 
All inductors will be designed with the help of TSVs 
with the same architecture as the ones presented in the first 
part of this document. The quality factor of inductors L6/L10 
have been simulated prior to implementation and are equal to 
10, which is sufficient for the targeted application. For 
inductors placed on the parallel paths (i.e., L1, L3, L5 and 
L9) their impact is really low regarding the insertion loss.

Figure 7. Schematic view of the band-pass filter considered for this study 
For the capacitors, a choice has been made to use the 
“free” MOM capacitor offered by the process. In fact two 
metallization are present and can be patterned as well on the 
top-side of the wafer. They are separated by a classical oxide 
with a density of 0.1 nF/mm2. A very low serial resistance 
value induced by the capacitor is expected to results from the 
use of two thick copper layers as device electrodes. 
Furthermore, very precise values of capacitance can be 
obtained since its relative precision is driven by the oxide 
thickness, which is really low (+/- 5%). 
All these components will of course interact one with 
another leading to a change in the frequency response of the 
filter. That’s why, a top level EM simulation is required to 
adjust and optimize the topology of the overall filter taking 
into account the interconnections as well as the ground return 
path. 
B. Layout implementation 
Special care has been taken to optimize the electrical 
resistance on the serial path. Wherever possible, the RF path 
was designed by stacking both levels of metallization 
connected together with the help of vias. Orientation and 
aspect ratio of capacitors have been chosen in such a way to 
minimize the resistive losses. A view of the simulated filter 
is shown on Fig. 8.  
First order dimensions of the solenoids (Dy, N) have 
been deduced from the analytical model provided in [9]. The 
value of the ground path inductance (metal tracks + bumps) 
is then taken into account as they participate to the self-
inductance value from the RF path to the ground (inductors 
L1, L3, L5 and L9). The metal track inductances have been 
calculated in reference to partial inductance concept 
proposed by Ruehli and Zhong [15][16]. Electrical 
parameters of the bumps have been evaluated by calculation 
and single EM simulations as proposed in [17].  
LC tanks (L6, C7 and L10, C11) in the stop-band filter 
have been realized with one-turn solenoids. Then prior to top 
simulations, each solenoid of the filter is placed with care in 
order to avoid as much as possible coupling between them. 
Typically the maximum space is considered, and an 
orientation of 90° between each inductor is applied to 
minimize magnetic coupling. Dimensions of the whole filter 
are 3.6x2.4 mm2 and clearly outperform conventional 
microwave structures such as hairpin filter for similar 
application [18]. The full structure is then simulated within

Figure 9. Simulations results of the proposed filter. Dark blue line 
corresponds to loss-less schematic filter simulated with ADS© schematic 
From the available results, the filter exhibits insertion 
and return loss of 2.6 and 16 dB respectively. Insertion losses 
are clearly within the specifications even if they are higher 
than classical micro strip filters. The main contributions to 
the insertion losses are both inductors L6 and L10 for whom 
electrical resistance increases very fast with the frequency. 
This approach gives indeed good results in case of moderate 
loaded Q (few units) but won’t be accurate in case of narrow 
fractional bandwidth where higher loaded Q-factors are 
required. For these very specific applications classical micro 
strip filters deposited on low loss substrates such as ceramic 
should be considered. TSVs can be used to build compact 
filtering function up to several GHz.

CONCLUSION 
This paper reports a novel approach based on TSVs to 
integrate and miniaturize band pass filter for L and S-band 
applications. This kind of approach is very interesting for 
moderate loaded quality filter devices. It can be used within 
hybrid systems where passive functions are combined with 
improved interconnections in order to obtain high 
performance devices. A simulation methodology based on a 
step by step calibration of the FEM tool and measurements 
on single 3D structures is described. It allows at the end 
simulating the filter in its packaging environment. From the 
simulation results, we have demonstrated the feasibility of 
TSV based BPF with insertion loss of about 2.6 dB at 4 
GHz.
