Abstract—We present results of our research works related to 
the study of thick-film multiwall carbon nanotube/tin oxide 
nanocomposite sensors of propylene glycol (PG) and 
dimethylformamide 
(DMF) 
vapors 
derived 
using 
hydrothermal synthesis and sol-gel methods. Investigations of 
response/recovery characteristics in the 50-300oC operating 
temperature range reveal that the optimal operating 
temperature for PG and DMF vapor sensors, taking into 
account both high response and acceptable response and 
recovery times, are about 200 and 220oC, respectively. A sensor 
response dependence on gas concentration in both cases is 
linear. The minimal propylene glycol and dimethylformamide 
gas concentrations at which the perceptible signal was 
registered by us were 13 ppm and 5 ppm, respectively.

I. INTRODUCTION 
There are various harmful and hazardous matter vapors, 
which have a major role in diverse spheres such as 
environmental protection, industrial manufacture, medicine, 
as well as national defense. As an illustration, propylene 
glycol (PG) is an excellent solvent for many organic 
compounds and is used as an active ingredient in engine 
coolants and antifreeze, brakes, paints, enamels and 
varnishes, and in many products as a solvent or surfactant. It 
can also be found in cosmetics, perfumes, as well as in 
pharmaceuticals. 
Another example is the dimethylformamide (DMF) 
which is used as a solvent in vinyl resins, adhesives, 
pesticide and epoxy formulations; which purifies and 
separates of acetylene, 1,3-butadiene, acid gases and 
aliphatic hydrocarbons, also in the production of polyacrylic 
or cellulose triacetate fibres and pharmaceuticals or in the 
production of polyurethane resin for synthetic leather [3]. 
DMF and PG have a huge impact on human organs (e.g. 
liver, skin, eyes and kidneys [1]-[3]). PG can cause nausea 
and vomiting, headache, dizziness and fainting. Moreover, it 
is known as a combustible liquid, which can explode in fire.  
Due to the information noted above, PG and DMF gas 
sensors have a huge application for detecting and continuous 
monitoring of these gases, in the spheres where they are 
used. As a result of our carefully conducted analysis of the 
literature data, we did not find any works related to research 
and development of resistive sensors of PG and DMF gases. 
There are only sensors working in other principle (for 
example sensors working on modification of color of the 
substance), which is incompatible for contemporary technic, 
while, resistive gas sensors made from metal oxides have 
advantages such as  electric signal, measurement of 
concentration, small sizes, low power consumption, high 
sensitivity, and long reliability [4]-[6]. 
Nanomaterials, as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), metal-oxide 
nanoparticles, nanotubes, nanowires and other various 
nanopatterns formation [7]-[12] are widely used in gas 
sensings for their excellent responsive characteristics, mature 
preparation technology, and low cost of mass production. 
Due to the covering of CNTs walls with metal-oxide 
nanoparticles, specific surface area of such gas-sensitive 
nanocomposites increases more. Moreover, nanochannels in 
the form of hollows of CNTs promote penetration of gas 
molecules deeper down in the nanocomposite sensitive layer 
[13]. Hence, it can be expected that application in gas 
sensors technology of nanocomposite structures composed of 
metal oxide functionalized with CNTs should enhance the 
gas sensor parameters, such as gas response, response, 
recovery times, and operating temperatures.  
Our recent works related to the study of gas sensors 
based 
on 
multiwall 
carbon 
nanotubes/tin 
oxide 
(MWCNTs/SnO2) nanostructures are also argued in [10] [14] 
[15]. The choice of tin oxide as a component of 
SnO2/MWCNTs nanocomposite structure is conditioned by 
the fact that SnO2 is well known and studied basic material 
for metal-oxide gas sensors (see, for example [4] [9] [16] 
[17]). We expected that coating of functionalized MWCNTs 
with SnO2 nanoparticles with admissible, (close to double 
Debay length) sizes [16]-[20] should provide the improved 
performance of the gas sensor and lowered temperature of its 
operating  
Here, we present the characteristics of the PG and DMF 
vapor 
sensors 
based 
on 
ruthenated 
thick-films 
MWCNT/SnO2 nanocomposite structures. The choice of 
corresponding processing technique, treating conditions and 
regimes for CNTs functionalization, as well as modification 
of thick films surface with Ru catalyst, are described below 
in the second section. Results of the measurements of PG

and DMF vapor sensors and their discussions are given in 
the third section. 
II. EXPERIMENTAL DEVELOPMENT 
 MWCNTs/SnO2 nanocomposite material processing and 
thick-film sensor manufacturing technology on the base of 
this nanocomposite are presented in this section. It is shortly 
described both the MWCNTs preparation and its covering 
with SnO2 nanoparticles obtained by using the hydrothermal 
method. Ruthenium catalyst deposition technology is also 
shown here.  
A. Material preparation 
Firstly, MWCNTs were prepared by the decomposition 
of acetylene (CVD method) using Fe, Co/CaCO3 catalyst 
[21] [22]. Such growth procedure using CaCO3 catalyst 
enables a highly efficient selective formation of clean 
MWCNTs, suitable for effective bonding between CNT and 
metal-oxide, particularly, for SnO2 precursors. 
The preparation of nanocomposite materials with a 
hydrothermal method was carried out in two steps. Firstly, 
purified MWCNTs were dispersed in water via sonication. 
Then, a calculated amount of precursor of the SnCl2•2H2 was 
dissolved in another beaker in water, whereupon 3 cm3 HCl 
was added to the solution. In the next step, the MWCNT’s 
suspension and the solution of the precursor were mixed and 
sonicated for 30 min. For preparing the nanocomposites, we 
poured the above-mentioned solutions into autoclaves, where 
hydrothermal synthesis was carried out at 150oC for 1 day. 
At the end of this procedure, all obtained nanocomposite 
powders were filtered and dried at 90oC for 5h. The final 
mass ratios of the nanocomposite MWCNT/SnO2 obtained 
with the hydrothermal method in this study were 1:200, 
respectively. The hydrothermal synthesis process is 
presented in details in [10] [23]. 
B. Samples 
The paste for the thick film deposition made by mixing 
powders with α-terpineol (“Sigma Aldrich”) and methanol 
was printed on the chemically treated surface of the alumina 
substrate over the ready-made Pt interdigitated electrodes. 
The thin-film Pt heater was formed on the back side of the 
substrate. Then, the obtained composite structures were cut 
into 3×3 mm pieces. After that, the drying and annealing 
processes of the resulting thick films were carried out in two 
stages: The first step is the heating of thick films up to 220oC 
with 2oC×min−1 rate of temperature rise and holding for 3h 
and then increasing in temperature until 400oC with 
1oC×min−1 rate and holding for 3h. In the second step, the 
thick-film specimens were cooled down in common with the 
oven. 
After annealing and cooling processes, the surface of 
MWCNTs/SnO2 thick films was ruthenated by dipping 
samples into the 0.01M RuOHCl3 aqueous solution for 
20min whereupon drying at 80oC for 30 min. Then, the 
annealing treatment was carried out again by the same 
method noticed above. The choice of the ruthenium as a 
catalyst was determined by its some advantages [10] [15] 
[23]. At the final stage, ruthenated MWCNT/SnO2 chips 
were arranged in TO-5 packages and the gas sensors would 
be ready to measurements after bonding of leads. 
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
Some results of the nanocomposite surface morphology 
study, as well as gas sensor characteristics, are shown in this 
section, but the performances of PG and DMF sensors are 
separately considered. Also, the dependence of electrical 
resistance of the sensors on operating temperature, as well as 
values of responses, response and recovery times of the 
sensors at various operating temperatures or target gas 
concentrations are shown here too.  
A. Material characterization 
The morphologies of the prepared SnO2/MWCNT 
nanocomposite powders wit diverse compounds were studied 
by scanning electron microscopy using Hitachi S-4700 Type 
II FE-SEM equipped with a cold field emission gun 
operating in the range of 5–15kV. The presence of an oxide 
layer was confirmed by SEM-EDX. Furthermore, the 
crystalline structure of the inorganic layer was also studied 
by an X-ray diffraction method using the Rigaku Miniflex II 
diffractometer 
(angle 
range: 
2θ 
[o]=10–80 
utilizing 
characteristic X-ray (CuKα) radiation). Results of these 
investigations were presented in [10] [23] more detailed. 
Here, we are only noting that average crystalline size of 
SnO2 nanoparticles estimated from SEM images and XRD 
patterns are less than 12 nm but the average diameter of non-
covered by SnO2 nanoparticles CNTs was about 40 nm. 
B. Gas sensing characteristics  
Gas 
sensing 
properties 
of 
the 
MWCNTs/SnO2 
nanocomposite structures were measured by home-made 
developed and computer-controlled static gas sensor test 
system [20]. The sensors were reheated and studied at 
different operating temperatures. When the electrical 
resistance of all studied sensors was stable, the vital assigned 
amount of compound in the liquid state for sensors testing 
was injected by a microsyringe in.measurement chamber 
Moreover, the target matters were introduced into the 
chamber on the special hot plate designed for the quick 
conversion of the liquid substance to its gas phase. After its 
resistance reached a new constant value, the test chamber 
was opened to recover the sensors in air. The sensing 
characteristics were studied in the 20-300oC operating 
temperature range and the gas response of the sensors 
determines as Ra/Rg where Ra and Rg are the electrical 
resistances in the air and in target gas-air atmosphere, 
respectively. The response and recovery times are 
determined as the time required for reaching the 90% 
resistance changes from the corresponding steady-state value 
of each signal. 
C. PG vapor sensor characteristics 
Firstly, we should determine the operating temperature of 
the sensors. As a result of measurements of the sensor 
resistance in air and air/gas environment, the maximal 
response to 650 ppm PG vapor was revealed at 200oC 
operating temperature (Figure 1 and Figure 2).

Changes of the response of PG vapor sensor, as well as 
the response and recovery times depending on operating 
temperature, are shown in Table I. Pursuant to the Table I, 
maximal response to PG vapor (Ra/Rg=125) was fixed for 
about 5s at 200oC operating temperature, but recovery 
process takes place sufficiently slowly at this temperature. At 
higher operating temperatures, the recovery of the sensor 
parameters occurs for a considerably short time, but the 
response of the sensor decreases noticeably.

Dependence of 
the resistance

of 
MWCNTs/SnO2 sensor on PG vapor concentration is shown 
in Figure 4 and Figure 5, respectively. As it is obvious from 
the figures, the sensor response occurs down to small target 
gas concentrations (15 ppm) but the response approximately 
linearly depends on the gas concentration.

D. DMF vapor sensor characteristics 
The sensor response derived as a result of 500 ppm DMF 
vapor exposure versus operating temperature is presented in 
Figure 6. It can be seen that maximal response, in this case, 
is registered in the range of 210-225oC. Taking into account, 
a relatively high response, shorter response and also recovery 
times (see Table II), are demonstrated at 225oC operating 
temperature. 
Dependence of the sensor response on versus DMF vapor 
concentration is also linear (Figure 7).

E. On possible mechanism of gas sensitivity 
It is known that the attachment of carboxyl groups on the 
surface of MWCNTs is effective in nucleation and trapping 
the other materials including tin oxide nanoparticles. As it 
was shown earlier, COOH groups attached on the surface of 
MWCNTs have a strong interaction with alcohol vapors 
resulting hydrogen bond between COOH groups and the OH 
groups of alcohol molecules [10] [15]. This hydrogen bond 
should be removed by increasing the temperature, which 
contributes to long recovery times in MWCNTs/SnO2 
sensors.  
The higher operating temperature of the gas response is 
observed until it reaches its maximal value. With the 
subsequent increase in operating temperature, desorption of 
chemisorbed oxygen ions takes place and gas response 
decreases; the recovery time decreases, too. 
MWCNTs nanochannels play a smaller role at relatively 
more content of SnO2 in the nanocomposite (as in our case), 
as nanotubes are closed by plenty of SnO2 nanoparticles. Due 
to it, accessibility of gas molecules penetration to MWCNTs 
nanochannels through the metal-oxide thick film is very 
difficult. Therefore, the gas response is mainly determined 
by a number of metal-oxide nanoparticles and a considerable 
amount of surface adsorption sites. MWCNTs only prevent 
the formation of agglomerates of SnO2 and ensure the 
development of the surface because of repulsive forces 
between the carboxyl groups adsorbed on it. 
The oxidation reaction of PG and DMF vapors on the 
nanocomposite surface could be represented as follows, 
respectively: 
C3H8O2(g) + 8O- → 3CO2(g) + 4H2O(g) + 8e- 
and 
4C3H7NO(g) + 42O- → 12CO2(g) + 4NO2(g) + 14H2O(g) + 42e- 
At the temperature corresponding to the highest response, 
the reactivity of the target gas molecules is proportional to 
the speed of diffusion into the sensing layer. Hence, the 
target gas has the chance to sufficiently penetrate into the 
sensing layer and react with an appropriate speed. The 
competition between the amount of adsorbed target gases 
and their oxidation rate supports the maximum response and 
its sharp decline. With the following increase in operating 
temperature, desorption of the adsorbed oxygen ions from 
the surface of the sensor is increased. It follows that less 
amount of oxygen ions presents on the surface of SnO2, 
might take part in reaction with target gases at higher 
operating temperature. Therefore, the response falls at high 
operating temperatures. Furthermore, it influences the 
physical properties of the semiconducting sensor material. 
For instance, at higher temperatures the carrier concentration 
increases (resulting from the release of electrons back to the 
conduction band in consequence of desorption of adsorbed 
oxygen) and the Debye length decreases. This may also be 
one of the possible reasons for the rise in Rg curve in Figure 
1, which leads to the decrease in response at higher 
temperatures. 
Although molecular weights of both considered target 
gases are close to each other, the quantity of carbon atoms is 
47

the same. Nevertheless, the response from DMF vapors 
influences less due to many adsorbed oxygen ions, resulted 
from the chemical decomposition, which demands for the 
full oxidation reaction. Thus, the 1:200 weight ratios of the 
nanocomposite sensor components with relatively large 
amount of SnO2 particles promote an initiation of a 
sufficiently large quantity of ionized adsorption centers, 
which ensure relatively high response to DMF gas exposure. 
As 
for 
selectivity, 
this 
nanocomposite 
sensor 
demonstrates cross-sensitivity to some alcohols, such as 
butanol, methanol and ethanol at 200oC operating 
temperature. Moreover, it influences by other gases, and as a 
rule, does not facilitate the formation of noticeable gas 
response at 200oC operation temperature. A sufficiently large 
signal is possible to obtain at higher operating temperatures, 
at which developed sensor does not react to diverse impacts 
of PG and DMF gases. For instance, the sensor exhibits a 
high response to toluene vapor only around of 250oC 
operating temperature [14] [23].  
Unlike existing other type PG and DMF sensors, 
presented nanocomposite sensor is able to measure the 
concentration of mentioned gases in the atmosphere. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have carried out the investigation of 
obtaining 
ruthenated 
MWCNTs/SnO2 
thick-film 
nanocomposite sensors using hydrothermal synthesis and 
sol-gel technologies. It is revealed that studied sensors give a 
sufficiently high response to such harmful and hazardous 
gases as PG and DMF at relatively low operating 
temperatures. The fast response of the sensors (at the order 
of seconds) and acceptable recovery times are observed 
under all gas concentrations influence at 200oC operating 
temperature. The minimal PG and DMF gas concentrations 
at which the perceptible signal is registered are 13 ppm and 5 
ppm, respectively. 
Due to the linear dependence of the response on the 
concentration of target gas, it is possible to easily measure 
the concentration of mentioned gases in the atmosphere.
