Abstract—In the fast time-varying channel, there exists in-
terference among subchannels for the orthogonal frequency-
division multiplexing (OFDM) system. The problem of inter-
subchannel interference (ICI) also appears in the single-carrier
(SC) block transmission with frequency-domain equalization
(FDE). There are several ICI reduction algorithms for the
OFDM system, and some of these algorithms can be applied
in the SC-FDE system. On the other hand, unlike the scenario
of carrier-frequency offset, the ICI caused by the time-varying
mobile channel cannot be completely removed, and the residual
ICI exists after the ICI reduction. In this paper, we analyze
the effect of residual ICI. We show that the impacts of the
residual ICI on the OFDM system and the SC-FDE system are
quite different. For the SC-FDE system, the residual ICI incurs
the “error rising” when we detect the time-domain symbols
after the frequency-domain equalization. The error-rising effect
is worse than the error-ﬂoor effect. To avoid the error-rising
effect caused by the residual ICI, one can apply the maximum-
likelihood (ML) detection, or its complexity-reduced schemes,
like the K-Best algorithm. The simulation results verify our
analysis.

I. INTRODUCTION
In
modern
wireless
communications, the
orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system is widely
applied for its low-complexity frequency-domain equalization
(FDE) in the multipath fading channel. The intersymbol
interference (ISI) can be removed with a proper cyclic preﬁx
(CP). On the other hand, one can also implement the single-
carrier (SC) block transmission with FDE by adding a CP
ahead of each transmitted block of symbols. Compared with
traditional SC systems, the SC-FDE system attains higher
spectral efﬁciency. The SC-FDE system also avoids the effect
of high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) in the OFDM
system.
In the high-mobility channel, both the OFDM system
and the SC block transmission suffer the inter-subchannel
interference (ICI). Compared with the ICI caused by the
carrier-frequency offset, the ICI caused by the channel
mobility is more difﬁcult to handle. Since for the high-
mobility channel, the received signal is composed of the
components from different angles around the receiver, and
these components have different Doppler frequency shifts.
Among the ICI cancellation or reduction algorithms [1]-
[9] for the OFDM system, the ICI self-reduction algorithms
[3][4][6][7][9] are of much lower complexity, and the ICI
reduction is independent of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
We can also apply some of these algorithms for the SC block
transmission in the high-mobility channel. The algorithm in
[6] extends periodically the time-domain (TD) signal to add
the diversity of FD symbols, and the receiver makes efﬁcient
combination of the diversity to reduce the ICI. The algorithm
of [9] further provides more efﬁcient combining coefﬁcients
to improve the performance. Both the algorithms in [6][9]
can be directly applied in the SC block transmission.
Since we cannot completely remove the ICI incurred by
the fast time-varying mobile channel, there exits residual ICI
after the ICI reduction in the receiver. However, as we will
show in this paper, the impacts of the residual ICI on the
OFDM and on the SC-FDE systems are quite different. For
the OFDM system, the residual ICI on a subchannel only
affects the FD symbols on this subchannel. If the fading of
a subchannel at some time slot is deep, then the residual
ICI may lead to incorrect detection of the symbol on this
subchannel, but it does not affect the detection of symbols
on other subchannels. However, for the SC-FDE system, the
transmitted symbols are in time domain. When the fading
of a subchannel is deep, the residual ICI in this subchannel
may be enhanced in the process of FD equalization, and
this enhanced interference affects all TD symbols after the
IFFT. By analysis we show that the residual ICI leads to
the “error-rising” effect on the error rate when the SNR
increases for the SC-FDE system. The simulation results also
verify our analysis. We can apply the maximum-likelihood
(ML) detection or its complexity-reduced algorithms, such
that the error-rising effect can be removed, as shown by
the simulation. In our simulation, we apply an efﬁcient ICI
self-reduction algorithm that is a modiﬁed version of the
algorithm in [9]. Instead of taking direct periodical extension
the original symbols as both [6] and [9], the algorithm ﬁrst
reduces the number of symbols within a block, followed by
the periodical extension to the original block size.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
introduces the signal model. The effect of residual ICI is ana-
lyzed in Section III. In Section IV, we discuss the use of ML
detection and the related complexity-reduced schemes. Some
simulation results are shown Section V. Finally, Section VI
concludes this paper.

Notation : In this paper, we use bold lower-case letters
and bold upper-case letters to denote vectors and matrices,
respectively. For example, the identity matrix is denoted by I.
The transpose and Hermitian transpose of a vector or matrix
are denoted by (·)T and (·)H, respectively. We deﬁne the
fast Fourier transform (FFT) matrix F of size N as [F]km

N , 0 ≤ k, m < N, and therefore its inverse is
F−1 = NFH.
II. SIGNAL MODEL
Fig. 1 shows a precoded OFDM (POFDM) system. A block
of transmitted symbols is denoted by
b = (x0, x1, . . . , xN−1)T
(1)
where N is the block size. When we set P = I, we have the
typical OFDM system; while for P = F, it is the SC block
transmission system and x = b. The associated baseband
signal can be expressed as
x(t) =
N−1
X
k=0
xk g

t − k T
N

,
− Tg ≤ t < T,
(2)
where T denotes the original duration of transmitting a block
of symbols in (1), and Tg is the duration of guard interval. In
(2), we denote by g(t) the associated periodic pulse [10] with
the period T . The period of g(t) is T , and during (−Tg, 0)
we transmit the periodic extension of g(t) (or CP). The ideal
interpolation pulse g(t) in (2) can implement the exact multi-
carrier modulation when combined with the IFFT [10].
At the receiver, after removing the CP, we can write the
received signal as
y(t) =
Lp−1
X
ℓ=0
h(ℓ)(t) x(t − τ (ℓ)) + w(t)
(3)
for 0 ≤ t < T , where Lp is the number of paths, and
we denote by h(ℓ)(t) and τ (ℓ) the channel impulse response
and delay, respectively, of the ℓth path. In (3), the noise
component of y(t) is denoted by w(t). We assume that
τ (ℓ) ≤ Tg for 0 ≤ ℓ < Lp, such that there is no ISI.
The received signal y(t) is sampled at t=kT/N for 0 ≤
k < N, and these N samples are denoted by y = (y0, y1,
. . ., yN−1)T , where yk = y(kT/N). Then y is transformed
into frequency domain by the FFT for equalization. The FFT
of y is denoted by yF = (Y0, Y1, . . . , YN−1)T . We can write
Ym as
Ym = Hm,mXm +
N−1
X
m′=0
m′̸=m
Hm,m′Xm′ + Wm
(4)
for 0 ≤ m < N. In (4), we observe that on the mth sub-
channel, there exists interference from other subchannels, due
to time variation of the multipath channel. The interference
from the m′th subchannel on the mth subchannel depends
on Hm,m′, which can be expressed as
Hm,m′ = 1

ℓ=1

h(ℓ)

N
(5)
for 0 ≤ m, m′ < N, where h(ℓ)
k
= h(ℓ)(kT/N), and Wm’s
are the noise components of Ym’s. For time-invariant or
slowly time-varying channels, each h(ℓ)
k
is constant during
0 ≤ k < N, or h(ℓ)
k
= h(ℓ), which is independent of k. In
this scenario, by (5) we observe that Hm,m′’s are zero for
m ̸= m′, since

(6)
if m ̸= m′, and there is no ICI in (4).
In the above, for the SC-FDE system, although the trans-
mitted symbols are in time domain, it also suffers the effect of
ICI. For the typical OFDM system, in which one can readily
apply either the block type or the comb type pilot schemes
in Fig. 2 for the CR estimation. However, for the SC block
transmission, one can only readily apply the block type pilot
arrangement. Since the transmitted symbols in (1) are in time
domain, if we apply the comb type pilot scheme, then when
inserting FD pilot symbols, we need to increase the sizes of
xF, x, y, and yF in Fig. 1. Then we also need to increase
the sizes of F−1 for IFFT in the transmitter and F for FFT
in the receiver. This makes P and F have different sizes.
On the other hand, for the block type pilot arrangement,
consider a group of FD symbols along time slots in the
process of joint CR estimation, as indicated by the red line in
Fig 2(a). If we apply the ICI self-reduction schemes in [6][9],
the TD periodic extension increases the relative time variation
of channel along time slots, and degrades the performance
of CR estimation. Therefore, we also give a modiﬁed ICI
self-reduction algorithm in Appendix A based on [9]. For
this modiﬁed algorithm, we do not apply direct TD periodic
extension, and the block duration is the same as the original
block duration.
III. THE RESIDUAL ICI
One can apply some ICI reduction algorithms to reduce the
effect of ICI. However, unlike the case of carrier-frequency
offset, we cannot completely remove the ICI in the time-
varying multipath channel. Therefore, there exists residual
ICI after the ICI reduction. We can express the signal after
the ICI reduction as
ˆYm = HmXm + Ires,m + Wm,
0 ≤ m < M,

where Ires,m denotes the residual ICI on the mth subchannel.
The expression of Ires,m depends on the ICI reduction
algorithm. In general, the power of each Ires,m is proportional
to the power of transmitted symbols.
A. Detection Based on the MMSE Principle
We ﬁrst consider the signal model without ICI, and write
(7) as
ˆYm = HmXm + Wm,
0 ≤ m < M,
(8)
For the OFDM system, if we have the estimate of Hm, we can
detect Xm simply by making hard decision on the equalized
signal,
ˆYm
Hm
= Xm + Wm
Hm
,
0 ≤ m < M.
(9)
For the SC block transmission, however, since the symbols
are in time domain, we need to further take the IFFT of (9).
For the scenario of deep fading, or |Hm| ≪ 1 for some m, the
detection in (9) incurs the noise enhancement, which results
in a large
 Wm
Hm
. The noise enhancement may cause large
interference on other TD symbols after the IFFT. Therefore,
for the SC block transmission, we need to modify (9) as
ˆYm
Hm + 1/γs
=
Hm
Hm + 1/γs
Xm +
Wm
Hm + 1/γs
(10)
where γs = (2σ2
X)/(2σ2
W ) for the quaternary phase-shift
keying (QPSK) modulation. The equalization in (10) is based
on the minimum mean-squares error (MMSE) principle.
Compared with (9), the item 1/γs can mitigate the effect
of noise enhancement when deep fading |Hm| ≪ 1 occurs,
since
Wm
Hm + 1/γs
≤
Wm
1/γs
. For the OFDM system, on the
other hand, the noise enhancement in (9) does not affect the
symbols on other subchannels, and we can simply apply (9)
for equalization.
B. The Effect of Residual ICI
In (10), we consider the scenario that there is no ICI.
When the ICI exists, after the ICI reduction, there exits
residual ICI on each subchannel, since the ICI cannot be
completely removed in the time-varying multipath fading
channel. Substituting (7) for ˆYm in (10), we have
ˆYm
Hm + 1/γs
=
Hm
Hm + 1/γs
Xm + Wm + Ires,m
Hm + 1/γs
(11)
for the QPSK modulation and γs = 2σ2
X
2σ2
W . When |Hm| ≪ 1
(deep fading on the mth subchannel), we can approximate
the second term of (11) as
Wm + Ires,m
Hm + 2σ2
W
2σ2
X
≈ 2σ2
X
2σ2
W
(Ires,m + Wm).
(12)
Since the power of residual ICI, Ires,m, is proportional to the
signal power, or 2σ2
X. At high SNR, or |Wm| ≪ 1, we can
further approximate (12) as
2σ2
X
2σ2
W
Ires,m
(13)
which increases with SNR more than linearly. For the OFDM
system, this only affects the detection of the transmitted

symbol Xm on the mth subchannel. However, for the SC
block transmission, because the transmitted symbols are
in time domain, the enhanced ICI in (12) will affect the
detection of other TD symbols after the IFFT of (11).
In the above, we show that after the ICI self-reduction,
if we apply the principle of MMSE in the FD equalization,
the residual ICI may be enhanced at some subchannel which
is under deep fading, and this affects all the TD symbols
after the IFFT for the SC block transmission. We will show
by simulation that the bit-error rate (BER) rises with the
increasing SNR at high SNR, and this veriﬁes that the
enhanced residual ICI increases with the signal power more
than linearly, as (13) indicates.
IV. MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD DETECTION
To avoid the effect of “error-rising” caused by the residual
ICI when the receiver applies the MMSE FD equalization
after the ICI reduction, one can resort to the ML detection
or the associated complexity-reduced suboptimal schemes.
Referring to Fig. 1, we can write yF as
yF = HxF + wF
(14)
where H is a diagonal matrix that represents the FD channel
responses, and wF is the vector of noise plus residual ICI.
Note that in (14), we assume H is a diagonal matrix after
the ICI reduction. Since xF = Fx, we can write (14) as
yF = HFx + wF.
(15)
For the SC block transmission, after the ICI self-reduction, as
indicated in Fig 4, the ML detection of the transmitted vector
of symbols x is given by
ˆx = arg min
x ∥yF − HFx∥2.
(16)
Although by the exhaustive search of all possible possible x
and calculating the associated norm ∥yF − HFx∥2, we can
determine the ML estimate of x by ﬁnding the minimum
norm in (16), the exhaustive search and calculation leads
to much high complexity that grows exponentially with the
length of x. We can resort to the sphere decoding (SD) algo-
rithm, which can efﬁciently implement the ML detection, or
the corresponding complexity-reduced suboptimal schemes,
like the K-Best algorithm. Note that in (16), we do not have
explicit equalization process, and this avoids the enhancement
of residual ICI and the associated error-rising effect, as we
will show in Section V.
V. SIMULATION RESULTS
In Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, we consider the detection of an SC-
FDE system. The size of a block is 64, and there are 64 virtual
subchannels in frequency domain. We apply an modiﬁed
ICI self-reduction algorithm given in Appendix A, which
we propose based on the algorithm in [9]. In Fig. 5, the
system is equalized in frequency domain with the MMSE
principle. We observe the error-rising effect, as indicated by
the analysis in Section III-B. The performance also degrades
with the increased values of normalized Doppler frequency
fdTs, where fd is the maximum Doppler frequency shift
and Ts is the block duration. In Fig. 6, the detection is
implemented by the suboptimal K-best algorithm based on
(16) and the receiver in Fig. 4. We observe in Fig. 6 that the
error rising effect is removed, and with the K-Best algorithm,
the performance is improved with the increased values of k.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we analyze the effect of residual ICI in the
detection of SC-FDE system. For the time-varying multipath
channel, unlike the case of carrier-frequency offset, the ICI
cannot be completely removed, and there exists residual ICI
after the ICI reduction. Our analysis shows that compared
with the OFDM system, the residual ICI in the SC-FDE
system results in the error-rising effect at high SNR if we
apply the MMSE FD equalization. The error-rising effect
is more unwanted than the error-ﬂoor effect. On the other
hand, we can alternatively apply the ML detection that can
be efﬁciently implemented by the SD algorithm, or the
corresponding suboptimal complexity-reduced schemes, like
the K-Best algorithm. The simulation results verify the error-
rising effect, and show that by the ML-based detection, one
can effectively remove the error-rising effect.
APPENDIX A
AN ICI SELF-REDUCTION ALGORITHM
Now we give an improved ICI self-reduction algorithm
based on the algorithm in [9]. This algorithm can be applied
in the SC-FDE system. We set P = F and this leads
to x = b for the transmitter in Fig. 1. As [7] indicates,
for the ICI reduction in the high-mobility channel, unlike
the scenario of carrier-frequency offset, we need to reduce
the transmission throughput. Unlike the algorithm in [9],
which directly apply periodical extension on the original
block (x0, x1, . . . xN−1)T , we ﬁrst reduce the block size to
M < N, where M ≥ N/2. The transmitted symbols within
a block are x0, x1, . . . xM−1. Denoted by
x = (x0, x1, . . . xM−1, x0, . . . , xN−M−1)T
(A.1)
then x contains the periodic extension of x0, x1, . . . xM−1.

self-reduction transforms y into ˜y based on (A.10), followed
by the FFT of ˜y in (A.9).
