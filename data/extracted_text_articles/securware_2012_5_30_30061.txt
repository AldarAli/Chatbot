Abstract: Review of data breach trends in the last five years
reveal that data at rest, in use, and in motion, inside and over
the extended network, is being increasingly affected. While
organisations primarily focus on protecting sensitive customer
financial information, the protection of custodial data and
company secrets has been a back burner issue. Moreover, er-
rors, mistakes and accidents on the part of the employees
working/ travelling/ residing onsite and off-site with company
media/data, have worsened the situation such that current
technical and socio-technical controls are not adequate in pre-
venting theft of media or the accidental or intentional mis-
use/loss of portable data. To overcome this issue, the security
action cycle model of Straub and Welke (based on the general
deterrence theory) is used as a theoretical lens to build a data
centric security cycle model to safeguard the data that are “at
rest, in motion and in use”. Finally, the paper discusses how
the model can be further empirically validated using the up-
dated IS success model of DeLone and McLean.
Keywords-IS Security; data breaches; data centric security.

INTRODUCTION
Security and privacy has remained one of the top ten key
issues for Information Systems [IS] executives since 2003
[1] and crucial to the continuous wellbeing of modern or-
ganisations [2] with the result that organizations need to
protect information assets against cyber crime, denial-of-
service attacks, web hackers, data breaches, identity and
credit card theft, and fraud [3]. A firm’s information related
assets are now among its most valuable assets [4]. Thus, the
protection of this asset through the process of information
security, is of equal importance [5]. The application of exist-
ing technical IS security frameworks and IS controls have
been effective in preventing attacks from external entities
into the organizational networks, but the mobility of the
organizational staff and information technology (IT) assets
along the extended network have posed serious risks to or-
ganizational data.
Inside organizations, valuable and critical data may exist
in laptops, portable storage media, storage media at distant
locations, and in emails in online and offline mode. In this
instance, sensitive data is not only out of the organizational
security defenses but that the existing organizational IS con-
trols and assurance cannot be monitored and thus becomes
voluntary on the part of the employees to protect it from
theft, accidental loss and misuse. While information security
controls and models exist for securing the organisational
network, data loss prevention is an area of scant research.
The object of this paper is data, which primarily refers to
custodial data (protection required by regulation/law) and
company secrets (high value intellectual property and as-
sets). The objective of the paper is to propose a model to
protect and control this data. Protection, focus on the data in
its raw form as it rests in the file system, flows through the
network and while it is being used. The controlling aspect
considers how the data or information is used once author-
ized users have gained access to it and even revokes the
access to it. The output of this paper is a data centric securi-
ty cycle model to protect the data (hereinafter refer to data
that are “at rest, in motion and in use”) in real time. The
theoretical basis of the model rest on the security action
cycle model of Straub and Welke [6], which in turn is de-
rived from the general deterrence theory.
The paper is divided into five sections. The current state
of IS security breaches is analyzed from statistics to high-
light the relevance of data loss prevention (Section 2). This
is followed by analyzing the high profile data breaches oc-
curred during the last five years from 2007 to 2011 to find
out the gaps in the socio-technical security structure (Sec-
tion 3). Then, the current literature on IS security is evaluat-
ed to ascertain the existence and appropriateness of relevant
IS security models for data protection and to select an ap-
propriate theoretical basis for the model (Section 4). Finally,
the selected theory is employed to build up the proposed
Data Centric Security Cycle (DCSC) model, as well as pro-
vide the rationale for using the updated IS success model of
DeLone and McLean [7] for evaluating the success of the
model (Section 5).

DATA BREACH ANALYSIS
The central objective of any security system is the ability
to prevent undesired access, while still allowing authorized
access to information [8] but with cyber incidents growing
in intensity and severity [9] the risks related to information
security have become a major challenge and a top manage-
ment priority for many organizations [10]. Thus, despite the
critical role and relevance of information and information
security in an organisation, unauthorized breaches into or-
ganisational internal and the extended networks occur with
greater frequency and severity [6] [9] [11] [12]. IS security
have remained within the top ten key issues in information
systems since the advent of the Internet in the early 1990s
[13], and maintained this position in subsequent studies [1]
[14] [15] [16] [17]. This section analyses data breaches from
a statistical as well as from a methodological perspective to
ascertain the severity and cause of breaches.
A.
Data Breaches – a Statistical Perspective
As organisations rely heavily on information to conduct
their daily activities [5], any disruption or intrusion poses
grave threat to the organisation and its extended enterprise.
Recent statistics taken from different sources reveal the se-
riousness of the issue. In the annual 2010/2011 CSI comput-
er crime and security survey (285 respondents), 41.1% of
those surveyed reported a security incident in their company
[18]. Similarly, a 2011 sector wise study by Deloitte on 138
organizations revealed that 75% experienced an IS security
breach, which was an increase over the previous year by
62% [19]. Also the average total cost of a data breach rose
to $6.75 million in 2009, with major increase in number of
records lost per incident [20] where stolen laptops were cit-
ed as the number one cause of a data breach in 2009.
From a numerical perspective, in 2011, the US Identity
Theft Resource Centre (ITRC) reported a total of 419
breaches resulting in 22,918,441 records being compro-
mised [21]. Compared with ITRC, Datalossdb [22] reported
890 breaches in 2011 with insiders (accident and malicious)
accounting for 39% of the breaches. Among the three types
of breaches namely reported abuse, discovered abuse and
undiscovered abuse [23], the above figures mainly represent
only the reported abuse all of which involve substantial loss
to the stakeholders. The breaches identified by the various
sources are not uniform as they use newspaper articles, cop-
ies of letters reporting a breach to consumers, notification
lists of state agencies, direct entry of incidents by the public,
and other web sites as sources for the breaches [24].
ITRC statistics that are based on publicly available
breaches in United States provides categorized statistical
data on breaches (see Figures 1 and 2). Considering acci-
dental exposure and data on the move, statistics from 2007
till 2011 does not indicate any drastic reduction in either the
number of breaches or records breached.
Figure 1. Total number of reported/known breaches in US from
2002 to 2011 (Source: ITRC, 2007 - 2011)
While payment card information and authentication cre-
dential are still the most sought after data, the largest
breaches (in terms of the number of records) reveal that the
personal information along with company secrets are a po-
tential target (Figure 3). The above statistical figures reveal
the increase in intensity and frequency of threat to all finan-
cial and organizational data from within and external to the
organization.

Figure 3. Varieties of data compromised by number of breaches and records [25]
Information can be categorized into custodial data and se-
crets [26]. It has been noticed from the above statistics that
hackers have shifted from financial information to the wider
custodial and company secrets (see TABLE I). Irrespective
of the type of date, the cost incurred by the organisation
comes at a price.
B.
Cost of Data Breach
While IS security breaches cost dearly for the organiza-
tions, the question is not whether organizations need more
security, but to look at cost-benefit methods to evaluate IT
security so as to ‘optimize’ security countermeasure invest-
ments and reduce spending without sacrificing protection
(Arora et al., 2004). The financial loss suffered by US com-
panies average $ 5.1 million for a single data breach and the
cost incurred for one compromised record comes to $214
[27]. Taking the 2011 ITRC reported breaches into consid-
eration, this would amount to $ 2136 million (at the rate of
US $ 5.1 million x 419 breaches). Calculating the loss from
a records compromised, the loss amounts to $ 4904 million
(22.9 million records based on ITRC x $ 214). Verizon
(2012) reported 855 incidents with 174 million compro-
mised records in 2011 from the small global sample from
the 33 participating countries. If this statistic is taken to cal-
culate
the
loss,
it
comes
to
an
annual
loss
of
$
37,236,000,000 from this small sample.
C.
Human Factor and Mobility in Data Breaches
The human being remains the weakest link in the control
and security of systems and networks [28] and “frequently
security violations involve those who are authorized or have
access to the sensitive data of concern” [29] (p. 26). Moreo-
ver, it is estimated that at least half of the breaches to IS
security are unauthorized system access made by internal
personnel [30]. Thus, the involvement of humans in infor-
mation security is equally important and many examples
exist where human activity can be linked to security issues
[2]. As noted by Schultz [31], information security is pri-
marily a people problem and technology is designed and
managed by people, leaving opportunities for human error.
It has been observed that organisational security target the
prevention of external threats, such as hackers and viruses,
leaving organizations open to breaches from the inside [30].
Hence, the occurrence of IS security breaches by internal
personnel may be reduced if greater emphasis were placed
on internal threats to IS security that can occur when em-
ployees handle information in their day-to-day jobs (ibid).
The environment of today's worker is evolving from cen-
tralization and control to mobility and performance [32].
With the rapid adoption of mobile office, modern organiza-
tions are exploiting mobile media and their infrastructure in
a more strategic manner, thus developing work styles and
office designs that are evolving around new technologies
like mobile phone, laptop and email address [33]. While
these technological advances provide advantages to organi-
zations [34], all of these pose significant threat to infor-
mation. This mobility highlights the relevance of protection
to the data, focusing on the data itself and evaluate how sen-
sitive data and information can be securely delivered and
shared/transferred beyond the organisational network. This
calls for a data focused security model that can incorporate
the policies and controls into the technical security architec-
ture to protect data from unauthorised access, wherever it
resides (fixed infrastructure, end points and mobile devices).
III. CAUSES OF DATA BREACH
The year 2011 witnessed a spate of high profile cyber-
attacks, and the top ten reported cases (number of records
breached) in the US and a few organizations in Europe is
taken to analyze the gaps in IS security. Since the ITRC and
the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse (PRC) [35] documents
publicly available breaches in US, these sources were com-
bined and analyzed to come up with a list of top ten data
breaches in 2011.

Table I reveals theft/accidental loss of media as a com-
mon cause of breach rather than hacking into the company
network. In the above ten cases, the data stolen mostly con-
tained personal and company information, rather than credit
cards or financial data which can be sold to third parties or
used for further social engineering attacks. Secondly, in all
of these top ten breaches, only cases 1, 2 and 5 attacks came
from external parties into the organizational network for
which the IS security manager have control of. In these
three cases, a simple analysis of the IS security defenses and
improved IS security can prevent further attacks. Regarding
the rest seven cases (3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9), data loss/theft oc-
curred with ease, and since the data was in media out of the
organizational perimeter defense it would have been impos-
sible to track with the normal internal controls. These cases
prove that the IS security manager need to have more con-
trol over the data that are at rest, in motion and in use. Thus,
IS security should not only be built like a staircase of com-
bined measures in order for information security measures
to become effective [36] but mutually dependent on each
other [37] Berghel, 2005 cited in [36] Hagen, Albrechtsen
and Howden.
The cases analyzed in this section highlights the rele-
vance of, control and changing access to information in real
time even after it has been sent out to the extent of even
restricting functions on secured documents, e.g. print, copy,
save as, print screen. If the data is outside the authorized
perimeter then the manager should have the right to revoke
access instantly, even after delivery has been taken, no mat-
ter where it has ended up (except in the case of back up
tapes). This can be equated to digital rights management

(DRM), which broadly refers to the set of policies, tech-
niques and tools used to manage the use of digital content.
While there are solutions in digital rights management, this
are limited to a few media and does not have the time bound
or rights revoke methods.
IV. INFORMATION SECURITY MODELS
The prime goals of information security is to provide
confidentiality, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation (to
data) and the key factor in getting value from security is to
insure that technology investments protect the right things
[38]. Based on this objective, numerous models and frame-
works have been proposed for securing information systems
in an organisation, apart from a few studies to secure infor-
mation. But, very few researches have been done for secur-
ing data “at rest, in motion and in use”. While it is impossi-
ble to totally secure any information systems, much is
known today about how "systems risks" can be substantially
reduced through effective management practices [6].
Lehman [29] presented a detection model using audit
trails in tracking potential security violations. Deterrence
theory was used for modeling sanctions by Siponen et al,
and Starub [39, 40]. The use of marketing campaigns in
security breach prevention has been proposed by McLean
[41] along with training and education model by [42].
Straub and Welke, [6] proposed the security planning model
that addresses deterrence, prevention, detection and reme-
dies using the general deterrence theory. A five level infor-
mation security management model by Solms, et al, [43]
encompass deterrence, prevention, detection and discipline.
Straub’s [40] model for detection and discipline of computer
abuse was focused more on evaluating investment in IA
security, while Trcek’s [44] layered multi-planes model for
information systems security focus on e-business systems
security. Ganame et al [45] proposed a distributed SOC (Se-
curity Operation Center) which is able to detect attacks oc-
curring simultaneously on several sites in a network, and a
six view perspective of system security was presented by
Yadav [12]. The model of Siponen and Vance [46] uses
neutralization technique and deterrence theory to develop
and implement security policies. Analysis of these models
reveal that they target organisational and security systems
rather than data. In the realm of data centric security, the
first and only attempt to provide security at data level re-
sulted in the data centric security model proposed by IBM
[47]. The purpose of the IBM model was to directly align
business strategy and IT security through the common
thread of data. This model focuses only on authentication,
authorization and disclosure control, thus only partly com-
plying with the security action cycle (deterrence, prevention
and detection, but not remedial actions).
A.
The Security Action Cycle Model
An analysis of the security models reveals that either one
or more of the four components of the security action cycle
(Figure 4) namely, deterrence, prevention, detection and the
discipline (remedies) element is used to provide a compre-
hensive protection to the information systems as a whole,
rather than focus on the data itself. Since hackers and unau-
thorized personnel target data, the four components of the
security action cycle is used to built a model to focus and
protect the data. The general deterrence theory have been
used in IS security models [40, 46]. The security action cy-
cle model [6] which is based on the general deterrence theo-
ry outlines four components for preventing ‘systems risk’
(information systems damage or loss)
such as deterrence,
prevention, detection and remedies. Two classes of coun-
termeasures—deterrents and preventives— have been found
to be effective [23]. Deterrents are passive, administrative
controls that take no active role in restricting the use of sys-
tem resources. Examples include computer security aware-
ness training sessions and distributed policy statements that
specify conditions for proper use of the system. Preventives,
on the other hand, screen access to the system to admit au-
thorized users only and include physical restraints such as
locks on computer equipment room doors and programmed
restraints such as software locks on accounts, files, transac-
tions, and data items [40]. Detection is the process of moni-
toring the events in a network. Remedies have been de-
scribed by Starub and Welke as punishment and recovery
procedures. The application of these four elements involves
the use technical as well as non-technical information sys-
tems controls which is referred to as audit.
B.
Role of Controls in IS Security
Internal controls are policies, procedures, practices, and
organizational structures put in place to reduce risks [48].
Appropriate controls are necessary to protect organizations
from suits against negligent duty and compliance to com-
puter misuse and data protection legislation [49]. While a
“control framework is a recognized system of control cate-
gories that covers all internal controls expected in an organi-
sation” (IIARF 2002, cited in [50], an internal control pro-
vides reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of
objectives in the area of effectiveness and efficiency of op-
erations, reliability of financial reporting and compliance
with regulations [51].

The analysis derived from the three sections direct the
researcher to the need for audit, protect data, transfer data
across networks, control the access of data and revoke ac-
cess even after delivery. These analysis viewed through the
security action cycle is given in Figure 4.
Figure 4. Data centric components embedded into the security
action cycle
V.
DATA CENTRIC SECURITY CYCLE MODEL
Data centric security is a relatively new field and despite
the fact that there exist a few security ontologies in the liter-
ature, none has yet touched on the topic of data-centric secu-
rity [52]. Data-centric security starts with a hard look at
what data the business must protect and its classification
where the focus is on the data instead of the network [53].
Data sharing among the extended stakeholders requires
complex procedures in the form of data sharing agreements,
contracts, access privileges, usage and routing control infra-
structure in the form of security policies [52], but despite
these controls, the extent of data breaches, data loss and data
pilferages could not be contained.
The data centric security cycle (DCSC) model revolves
around five dimensions namely protection of data, securely
deliver and share sensitive information, audit every single
activity doen by users to information, control and change
acceess on a continual basis, and if necessary revoke access
even after the delivery of information has been taken by the
user. Security of information here refer to where, when, who
and how security can be used as an enabler of business, not
as a restriction. This is done through storing information in
encrypted format wherever needed, protecting through
strong encryption, digital rights management and business-
focused data leakage prevention. This ensures sharing data
solely amongst authorised users, both internal and external
to the organization and controlling it in real time of all user,
administrator and file activity. The ISO 27001 IS security
standard reiterates the cyclical nature and thus incorporates
the Plan – Do – Check - Act (PDCA) cycle of
Edward
Deming.
Figure 5. Data centric security cycle model
Also, taking into account the cyclical nature of the security
action cycle, the model presented in Figure 4 can be refined
further to the data centric security cyclical model (Figure 5).
A data centric security solution provides persistent protec-
tion (persistent -at rest, in transit and in use); Strong encryp-
tion that is dynamic and granular data centric rights man-
agement where the rights can be managed at any time and in
real time and it can be assigned in a granular way (adminis-
trators, users and data). The concept puts data control back
in hands of data owners by separation between administra-
tors and owners/users (Independent management) thus mak-
ing it flexible for both internal and external users, for any
type of file, at any storage location, for any size and type of
solution, customization and integration. This data centric
security concept is easy to use, simple, easy to administer,
implement, maintain and is complete in terms of securing
data. Since the control of data use is in the hands of the ad-
ministrator, the human factor in data breaches due to acci-
dent and negligence can be substantially reduced, but not
fully contained.
Next, the application of the model is discussed. When
converted into a tangible solution, the model consists of
three components namely the server, the web client and the
agent. The server component manages all operations namely
data protection, encryption, all information related to user
profiles and their rights to access and use of shared files.
The web client users are able to access all the functionality
of the server via any Internet browser, for both Windows
and Mac. The agent provides added security functions like
block screen capture, print screen, video streaming, revoke
access any time, create encrypted local disks, synchronize a

local disk with the centralized resources through the web
client, encrypt local resources making them accessible even
without connection to the server and even provide
time
bound offline access. Once cases are selected this will be
provided to them for implementation and thereafter for em-
pirical evaluation, the researchers plan to use the updated IS
success model of DeLone and McLean [54] using the varia-
bles namely information quality, systems quality and service
quality from a IS security perspective. Once the users use
the model, feedback (interview questions) will be framed
based on these above variables.
VI
CONCLUSION
Regulation and compliance are increasingly important
where compliant doesn’t mean secure and secure doesn’t
mean
efficient.
While
organisataions
need
to
secure
networks
and
financial
information,
the
concept
of
focussing on the data that are in use, in motion and at rest
has gained relevance as is evident from the data breaches..
With this objective, this paper propose a model that focus on
the real time protection/control of data. The model that was
based on the security action cycle model can audit, protect,
control, secure and even revoke rughts to data in online and
offline mode by the data custodian. Further research can
focus on protecting/controlling media and digital backup
tapes using RFID technology.
