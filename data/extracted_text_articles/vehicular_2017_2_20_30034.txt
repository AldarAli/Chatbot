Abstract—Latency is an important metric for time-critical
safety applications in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs).
Medium access control (MAC) protocol can be greatly exploited
to achieve low latency. In this paper, we modify the existing
VeMAC protocol frame structure to enhance its latency aspects
for time-critical applications. We introduce additional emergency
slots for transmission of emergency messages so that vehicles
with time-critical emergency messages do not have to wait for
their turn for the transmission of such messages. Our modiﬁed
low latency version of the existing VeMAC protocol shows great
improvements in latency for transmission of emergency messages.
We analyze the VeMAC protocol and the proposed protocol
through simulation and show that the proposed MAC achieves
low latency under different scenarios.

I. INTRODUCTION
A vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) is a network of
moving vehicles, where the vehicles, equipped with sufﬁ-
cient sensing, computation, and communication capabilities,
dynamically form an ad-hoc network without any mandatory
infrastructure. VANETs are a special class of mobile ad-
hoc networks (MANETs), but having unique characteristics
such as high mobility of nodes, dynamic network topol-
ogy, varying communication environment, varying number of
nodes, varying node distribution, etc. VANETs are designed
for the purpose to exchange trafﬁc or accidental information
between vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-road side
unit (V2RSU) networks. VANETs have received tremendous
attention due to plethora of applications they support such as
intelligent transportation system (ITS), trafﬁc information dis-
semination, infotainment, and the Internet connectivity on the
go [1] [2]. Among these, the potential application of VANET
is ITS, where the core objective is to control accidents, reduce
trafﬁc congestion, and improve driving safety in urban areas.
Owing to importance of VANETs and the multitude of
applications supported by the technology, several efforts were
taken to standardize it, FCC allocated 75 MHz spectrum in
the 5.9 GHz band for Dedicated Short-Range Communication
(DSRC) [3] solely for the purpose of V2V and V2RSU
communication. DSRC is widely recognized as the IEEE
802.11p Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE)
and is considered the de facto standard for VANETs [4], it is
based on IEEE 802.11 MAC and IEEE 802.11a PHY layer [5].
The prime goal of VANETs is to disseminate safety
and emergency messages, the timely transmission of such
messages is critical to smooth operation of safety applica-
tions. As latency is an important performance metric for
safety/emergency applications and can be controlled through
the medium access control (MAC) layer so this requires for
efﬁcient medium sharing. Thus, an efﬁcient MAC protocol
should ensure high reliability, low end-to-end latency, and high
throughput. Therefore, we analyze and exploit the MAC layer
in reducing the latency for safety/emergency messages in the
context of V2V communication.
In this paper, we propose the emergency enhanced MAC
protocol which is a variant of the VeMAC [6] protocol.
VeMAC is a multichannel TDMA MAC protocol which is
based on ADHOC MAC [7]. The proposed protocol uses
emergency slots to transmit time critical emergency messages
in case of road accidens or collisions among vehicles in
VANETs. Our proposed protocol achieves low latency for
emergency messages under different scenarios and is evaluated
through simulation.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, we discuss VeMAC, its working principle, frame
structure and highlight its drawbacks for low latency as-
pects. Subsequently, Section III gives overview of the desired
changes in VeMAC to achieve low latency. In Section IV, we
describe the evaluation details of our proposed MAC protocol
through simulation. We also discuss different real life scenar-
ios for which the protocol is evaluated. Section V discusses
results of the simulation and shows latency improvements
through box plots. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper.
II. RELATED WORK
In this section, we review the related work, especially we
focus on VeMAC. We thoroughly explain VeMAC and its
frame structure.
VeMAC frame structure: VeMAC [6] is a multi-channel
TDMA protocol for VANETs, which utilizes two radios. One
of the radios is always tuned to the control channel c0, while
the other radio can be tuned to one of the service channels.
Each node should acquire exactly one slot on the control
channel. The node holds onto this slot until it does not need
it anymore or until a merging collision occurs. The collisions

occur if two nodes, with the same slot, enter the same two-hop-
neighborhood due to their Monument. To reduce the number
of collisions, the slots are divided into disjunct sets L, R, and
F as shown in Figure 1. The frame structure is split in two
disjunct sets based on the general direction of movement of
the vehicles. If a node travels in general eastern direction, so
0 − 180◦ degrees of a compass, it would be in the R-subset,
the rest in the L-subset as shown in Figure 2. F is an optional
set for RSUs which has no direction of movement. That way,
vehicles driving in opposing directions are not competing
for the same slot and it reduces the relative speed of nodes
competing for the same slots and thereby increases the network
topology persistence within these sets.
The directions are provided by the GPS unit that each
vehicle is mandatory to be equipped with. With the GPS unit
it is possible to synchronize the frames through the pulse per
second (PPS) signal provided by each GPS receiver. A frame
should start at the beginning of each GPS second.
Figure 1. Frame structure of VeMAC [6].
The VeMAC protocol proposes a time division in a period-
ical frame structure of ﬁxed duration. One frame consists of
100 slots, where the length of one slot is of 1 ms duration,
hence a frame length of 100 ms. Each node should transmit
periodically one message per frame in its allocated slot. The
message consists of a header ﬁeld, two ﬁelds to organize
the allocation of slots on the service channels as well as
one ﬁeld for exchange of information for high-priority short
applications.
Each node should have a unique random ID to identify the
node. The header of the message of node x includes, amongst
others, the set N(x) which is the set of IDs of the one-hop
neighbors of node x on channel c0, from which node x has
received packets on channel c0 [6] in the previous 100 slots.
With the sets N(y) of each one-hop neighbor y, the node
is able to determine which slots are used by its two-hop
neighborhood. These slots, that the node must not use in
the next 100 time slots, are denoted by T0(x). With this
information, the node builds the set of available slots A(x) =
T0(x) respectively with regard to the directional division, e.g.,
A(x) = T0(x) ∩ R for vehicles driving in eastern direction.
With the provided information the node is able to solve the
hidden-terminal problem.
Node x also determines whether or not all of its one-hop
neighbors received its last broadcast by looking for its ID in
the right slot in all N(y). It thereby constitutes a reliable
broadcast mechanism. Due to the regular transmitting, there
exists an upper bound for transmission of messages of 100 ms.
However 100 ms is a long time in high mobility scenarios.
Figure 2. Division of node per direction [6] showing the distinction for the
L set and R set.
Limitation of VeMAC for emergency messages: In 100 ms,
a car traveling on the highway with the recommended speed of
130 km/h already covers a distance of 3.6 meter and many cars
drive considerably faster on the highway in Germany. While
the 100 ms limit should be sufﬁcient in normal use, it might
be too long for emergency situations where fast responses are
crucial.
III. PROPOSED LOW-LATENCY OPTIMIZED MAC
To reduce the latency in emergency situations, in this paper,
we propose emergency enhanced VeMAC (EEVeMac), which
is variant of the VeMAC protocol, by introducing emergency
slots at the beginning of the L set in slot 0 and R set in slot 50
as shown in Figure 3. They are evenly distributed across the
frame structure to reduce the average distance to any other
slot. The slots are based on the principle of CSMA for the
transmission of time-critical emergency data. In case of an
emergency, a vehicle wants to send time-critical data to notify
other vehicles of its situation. In this way, instead of waiting
for its next allocated slot, the vehicle can use these additional
emergency slots to quickly transmit the messages and avoid
catastrophic situations. With additional slots, vehicles have
three possible slots instead of one to transmit their data during
emergency situations, effectively bringing down the upper
bound latency to 50 ms. While the upper bound latency is
50 ms, the median average is further reduced since a slot
is able to choose from three possible slots for emergency
transmission instead of one.
While the original VeMAC protocol does not deﬁne the
exact nature of N(x) for node x, we implemented them in
both VeMAC and EEVeMAC as pair of ID and slot number
to preserve the reliable broadcast mechanism in EEVeMAC.
Through this modiﬁcation, an ID can be twice in a set. A
receiving node then thereby acknowledges the reception of an
emergency message by including the ID of the sending node in
the emergency slot number in which it received the emergency
message. This implementation decision will extend the length

of the regular message by a maximum of 100 bytes (88 bits
total, 7 bits for representation of numbers up to 128, rounded
up to 8, multiplied by 100 slots).
IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
We evaluate the proposed protocol in OMNeT++ [8] sim-
ulation environment together with Veins [9] and SUMO [10].
Veins is an open source simulation framework for vehicular
network simulation. It bi-directionally couples two softwares:
OMNeT++ is utilized for network simulation and the open
source trafﬁc suite SUMO of the German Aerospace Center
provides the trafﬁc simulation data. SUMO has several car-
following-models and lane-changing-models to reproduce re-
alistic trafﬁc behavior. Veins integrates MiXiM [11] for mod-
eling physical layer effects and provides realistic interference
models. For our simulation we use the two-ray-interference
model provided by Veins [12].
Scenario: The highway interchange Münster south, Germany
was created in SUMO as shown in Figure 4 and provided with
trafﬁc statistic of the state ofﬁce for road construction NRW
[13] to achieve a realistic trafﬁc scenario.
Two scenarios "straight" and "interchange" with reduced
road trafﬁc and normal road trafﬁc were tested to examine
the inﬂuence of node numbers on collisions. In the straight
scenario, only trafﬁc from northern and southern directions
was present; in the interchange scenario vehicles started from
each direction. In each scenario, 20% of cars were presumed
to change from one highway to the other highway with
10% in each direction of the highway. The road trafﬁc was
implemented with the trafﬁc ﬂow functionality of SUMO
which regularly introduces vehicles based on the number of
vehicles per hour. The scenario consists of a car that drives
on the highway in northern direction and wants to change
the highway in western direction on the interchange. It breaks
down on the clover interchange lane and sends an emergency
message. The car drove in north-west direction and hence it
has a regular slot in the ﬁrst half of the frame structure. In each
scenario, the emergency was set to three different slots. To slot
1, directly after an emergency slot, to slot 25, in the middle
between two emergency slots, and to slot 49, right before an
emergency slot. Each conﬁguration was run with 50 repetitions
to achieve a good conﬁdence interval. In combination with the
other parameters as summarized in TABLE I, this resulted in
600 simulation runs.

In addition to the aforementioned scenarios, we conducted
a scenario "dense trafﬁc" with additional cars to simulate
extremely dense trafﬁc as it would be expected in urban trafﬁc.
We conducted it with the same parameters as the "Interchange"
scenario, but increased the numbers of vehicles to 13600
vehicles per hour.
V. RESULTS
For the evaluation of EEVeMAC protocol, we measured
two values. The latency from the moment the emergency
occurred to the moment the one-hop neighbors receiving the
emergency message. The second evaluation value consists of
the occurrence of collisions, which were calculated to the
arithmetic average per node. The results showed an overall
improvement of the latency as further explained below.
A. Latency in straight scenario
In the straight scenario, there were 21 nodes in transmit-
ting range of the emergency vehicle at the moment of the
emergency situation. The emergency message took a median

time of 69.99 ms to reach the one-hop neighbors of the
emergency vehicle in the original VeMAC. With EEVeMAC,
with the addition of emergency slots, this value was reduced
to 16.57 ms as shown in Figure 5. If the emergency occurred
in the ﬁrst slot after an emergency slot, the median latency
was closest to the original protocol with 34.58 ms (VeMAC)
vs. 25.01 ms (EEVeMAC) since there is a good chance that
the regular slot of the emergency vehicle is between the slot
in which the emergency occurs and the next emergency slot.
If there is a regular slot in between the emergency and an
emergency slot, there is no difference between both protocols
as they would both transmit the emergency message in the
regular slot. The improvement occurs in the cases where the
emergency slot is used. The biggest improvement could be
measured with the emergency in slot 49, directly in front
of an emergency slot with 73.79 ms (VeMAC) vs. 0.61 ms
(EEVeMAC) as shown in Figure 8 (a). Without the emergency
slots, the emergency vehicle has to wait at least 50 ms if it
does not have slot 49 as its regular slot. It can not transmit in
the slot numbers 50-99 since the emergency vehicle is driving
in north western direction and hence prefers a slot in the L-
set in slot numbers 0-49 of the frame. With the emergency
right between two emergency slots, the median latency was
improved by 57.61 ms from 81.730 ms in the original VeMAC
to 24.120 ms in EEVeMAC with emergency slots.

B. Latency in interchange scenario
The results of the interchange scenario with trafﬁc ﬂow
from each direction showed similar improvements as shown
in Figure 6. In this scenario, 35 nodes were in transmitting
range present during the emergency situation. The median
latency was improved by factor 3 from 48.73 ms (VeMAC)
to 14.66 ms (EEVeMAC). The biggest improvement could be
once again measured if the emergency occurred in the slot right
before an emergency slot 75.61 ms in the original VeMAC
vs. 0.61 ms in the EEVeMAC, the smallest improvement
with the emergency right behind an emergency slot 27.45 ms
vs. 24.7 ms. When the emergency occurred in the middle
between two emergency slots, the median latency still shows
an improvement of 14.6 ms with 38.67 ms measured in the
VeMAC and 24.07 ms in the EEVeMAC as shown in Figure
8 (b).

Figure 8. Overview of evaluation of latency results for the straight scenario and the interchange scenario with the emergency in slots 1, 25, and 49.
C. Latency in dense trafﬁc scenario
In this scenario with additional trafﬁc, 50 nodes were in
range of the emergency vehicle. The results showed overall
similar results as in the normal interchange scenario. The
median latency was measured slightly higher with 16.05 ms
(EEVeMAC) vs. 75.65 ms (VeMAC) as shown in Figure 7.
D. Collisions
The reservation of two slots for transmission of emergency
messages results in a higher expectation of collisions. Instead
of 100 slots for transmission of their regular message, the
nodes only have a maximum of 98 slots to choose from.
Therefore, we also measured the number of collisions. As
a measurement, we took the average number of collisions
per node. The number of collisions increases in the straight
scenario from 0.04575 average collisions per node in the
original VeMAC to 0.04747 average collisions per node in
the EEVeMAC. The results of the second scenario show that
the effect is negligible compared to the effect the numbers
of nodes have. The VeMAC had 0.29483 collisions per node
whereas the EEVeMAC had 0.29096 collisions per node on
average. The average number of collisions increases further
with additional trafﬁc in the dense trafﬁc scenario. In the
simulation runs with VeMAC, 0.52835 collisions occured
whereas EEVeMAC measured 0.66370 collisions.
VI. CONCLUSION
The introduction of emergency slots in VeMAC shows great
improvements for the transmission of high-priority emergency
messages. Instead of median latencies of up to 80+ ms we
achieved in our test conﬁgurations a maximum of median
latencies smaller than 25 ms. The latencies were reduced by
factor of 3-4. The median and average latencies were improved
in each study conﬁguration. The reduction of available slots
for regular transmission through the reservation of emergency
slots had negligible effects on the rate of collisions.
Further, in situations where several vehicles try to send
out an emergency message at the same time, competition
emerges and latency increases as the vehicles fail to acquire
the emergency slot. The vehicles can still use their normal
slots to transmit the emergency message which means that
the average latency converges to the maximum latency of
VeMAC, e.g. 100 ms. The performance of EEVeMAC in
emergency situations with two or more involved vehicles
remains to be evaluated. Moreover further research is to be
conducted in regards to the optimal number of emergency
slots and their effect on collision rates.
