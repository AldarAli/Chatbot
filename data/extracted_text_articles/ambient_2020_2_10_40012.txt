Abstract—A systematic review of 459 Ambient Displays, 
reported in 410 publications between 1996 and 2016 was used as 
the basis for an analysis of the high-level design features 
associated with the technology. An analysis of these displays 
considers three main aspects: the modalities used to display 
information, the physical form of the displays and the level of 
implemented interaction. The paper provides a longitudinal 
overview of the various forms of Ambient Displays over a 
twenty-year period. This allows for the provision of a 
comprehensive timeline of past work in the field of Ambient 
Display and establishes a sound basis for further reviews or 
studies related to this technology.

Review, Evaluation; Modality. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Ambient Displays or Ambient Information Systems are 
designed as everyday, peripheral information sources that 
visualise useful data in a way that can be attended to when 
possible [1]. They are designed to display abstracted, non-
critical information on the periphery of a user’s attention [2] 
[3]. They should be non-obtrusive and try not to overload the 
senses [4] [5] while also considering the aesthetic appeal of 
the display and the need to be seamlessly embedded within 
an everyday environment [2] [6] [7]. 
The field of Ambient Display was motivated by Calm 
Technology [8], a desire for less intrusive displays in a noisy 
world of dynamic and ubiquitous information. The 
technology, under different names, has been studied since 
about 1996 and is most commonly referred to as Ambient 
Displays, Ambient Information Systems, Peripheral or 
Pervasive Displays [9]-[12].  
There have been several narrative reviews of the 
technology in the past [1] [7] [13]-[30]. However, these 
narrative reviews do not attempt to cover the majority of 
historical examples of Ambient Display. This paper is 
designed to address this gap and categorise key design 
features based on the analysis of results from a systematic 
review [31] that identified 459 Ambient Displays published 
in 410 studies between 1996 and 2016. This historical 
analysis supports a fuller description of the common 
attributes of Ambient Display in a field comprised of 
disparate systems that has evolved over time. Providing a 
comprehensive timeline of historical studies into the field of 
Ambient Display offers a sound basis for detailed meta-
analysis of the technology and acts as an introduction to the 
field’s progression across the design, development and 
evaluation of Ambient Display.   
While some other studies have also taken a systematic 
approach [31]-[33], these works focus on restricted portions 
of the domain and thus describe a more limited set of the 
overall number of Ambient Displays. This study takes a more 
expansive approach, assuming that further insights may be 
gained by a systematic categorization of a large, longitudinal 
sample of this display technology.    
The systematic review identifies three broad design 
categories of Ambient Displays, the modalities used to 
display information, the physical form of the display itself 
and the level of interaction implemented. It serves to 
highlight some key differences in the types of Ambient 
Displays and suggests gaps in the field. 
   This analysis begins next in Section 2 which discusses 
previous naming conventions and definitions for the 
technology, which leads to the systematic review 
methodology that is documented in Section 3. Sections 4, 5 
and 6 discuss each of the major design attributes of the 
technology discovered through the review process including; 
modality (see Section 4), physicality (see Section 5) and 
interaction (see Section 6). This leads to discussion of 
conclusions and future work, which are presented in Section 
7.    
II. 
NAMING CONVENTIONS AND DEFINITIONS 
The definition of Ambient Display technology is difficult 
as there are no consistently accepted terms used to describe 
these systems in the existing literature [1]. This includes the 
key features of the technology, which can be described in 
divergent ways while still being interpreted as aligning to the 
ideals of Calm Technology [8]. So, just what is an Ambient 
Display, and how has the technology developed over time?   
Common overarching names for this type of display 
technology include Ambient Displays, Ambient Information 
Systems, Peripheral or Pervasive Displays [9]-[12]. There are 
some reoccurring themes within the previously suggested 
definitions of the technology. These include the display of 
potentially useful [10] [36] information [1]-[6] [11] [19] [34]

[36]-[41] in one’s periphery [4] [34] [56] [57] [61] through 
aesthetically designed systems [2] [6] [7] [10] that do not 
impose on the user or become intrusive [4] [5] [19] [34] [39] 
[43].   
These divergent attributes suggest the need for a more 
structured review process, to understand how the domain has 
developed over time and to highlight general categories of 
these technologies. Therefore, this review aimed to document 
a high volume of previous displays and quantify them into 
broad design categories that would inform how the key 
design features of such displays have developed over time. 
III. 
METHOD 
A systematic review was designed to analyze a large body 
of published work related to Ambient Displays. This was 
intended to cover a twenty-year period beginning with the 
suggestion of Calm Technology in 1996, through to the end 
of 2016.  
The disparate nomenclature of the technology had to be 
addressed early when selecting terms used to query the 
academic databases. A pragmatic approach was taken in 
selecting Ambient Display, Ambient Information System, 
and Peripheral Display as key terms for search. This decision 
was based on the common use of these naming schemes. 
Since this search identified over fifteen thousand articles, it 
was decided not to include further terms. 
These terms were queried in four separate academic 
databases; ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus and 
Web of Science. The attributes of the search query used in 
each database are shown in Table 1. 
Searching across these three databases resulted in over 
fifteen-thousand documents (n=15,693), which required 
further assessment for determining their relevance to the 
study. Only papers that documented a specific Ambient 
Display design, implementation or discussed theoretical 
concepts relating to the technology were included. 
As a next check, all publications were assessed to 
determine if the system described was consistent with two 
typical definitions of Ambient Display (see Table 2). This 
process acted as a further pre-screening of the literature that 
did not align to the intentions of this research.

THE TWO DEFINITIONS USED IN THE INITIAL ASSESSMENT 
OF LITERATURE 
Definition 1 
“Ambient displays are abstract and aesthetic 
peripheral displays portraying non-critical 
information on the periphery of a user’s 
attention.” [2] 
Definition 2 
“Ambient Information Systems are designed as 
everyday, peripheral information sources that 
visualise useful data in a way that can be attended 
to when possible.” [1] 
 
Publications that were found to conform to either of these 
definitions were considered further to determine if the 
described technology conformed to the original ideals of 
Calm Technology [8]. Advertising displays and displays 
relating directly to digital signage were excluded. Finally, 
publications describing systems with high levels of user-
interaction, such as computing games or interactive 
information systems were excluded. 
This screening process resulted in 410 unique documents 
that were judged as being most relevant to this study. Most of 
the literature was found to relate to the development and 
evaluation of Ambient Display (n=254) or the development 
of Ambient Display (n=115). The remaining literature was 
found to relate to the evaluation of Ambient Display (n=7) 
and a subset of studies (n=34) that discuss the theory or 
classification of the technology.  
Found within these studies were 459 Ambient Displays 
that were classified according to three general attributes 
which were found to reoccur across these implementations. 
These attributes were the modality, the physical form and the 
level of interaction designed for each of these displays. These 
document references, the data used in Figures 1-3 and 
discussed in this paper have been made available in a public 
data repository for open access [31]. 
IV. 
DISPLAY MODALITIES 
Almost since the beginning of Ambient Display in 1996 
[8], there has been the associated notion of Ambient Media 
[44]. This has implied that diverse modalities might be used 
to encode data and display information across a range of 
senses. As might be expected, across the 459 Ambient 
Displays the modalities were diverse [31] (see Figure 1). 
Although, only about 12% of these were identified as 
multimodal displays (n=54). By contrast, 76% of the displays 
provided only a light-based mode, implemented using 
physical lights, projected images or traditional computer 
screens (n=348). Other approaches included object 
movement (n=32), sound (n=12), olfaction (n=2) temperature 
(n=2) or vibration (n=9).  
In total, 87% (n= 398/459) of the reviewed systems were 
found to use some form of light for output. The majority (n= 
348) of these implementations used light as the single output 
medium. A smaller subset of displays (n=49) incorporated 
light as part of a multimodal presentation. While the use of 
light was the primary media used for output, some systems 
adopted more novel modalities, including the use of smell

Figure 1. Distribution of Ambient Displays over time, classified by modality. The numbers directly reference identifiers in the systematic review data [31]
(n=3), sound (n=53), vibration (n=13) and temperature (n=6). 
These novel displays often depart significantly from typical 
computer systems. 
In the scope of this review, only a few implementations 
were identified that solely make use of sound for output 
(n=12). This result is somewhat unexpected given the 
ambient nature of sound and the opportunities afforded by 
sonification that allows encoding of abstract data into non-
speech sounds [45].  
V. 
PHYSICAL FORM 
The review also identified a broad range of physical forms 
that could be described in two general categories.  Firstly, 
there are those that make use of screen or projection 
technology for output. Alternatively, there are displays that 
are more tangible or sculptural in form and are categorized as 
object-based Ambient Displays. The distribution of these two 
different hardware types was largely even across the domain 
with 49% (n=224/459) being screen-based and 51% 
(n=235/459) being tangible display objects (see Figure 2). 
These screen-based implementations typically used off-
the-shelf LCD, CRT monitors or projection technology. 
Computer-driven displays permit considerable flexibility 
around the selected data mapping. These screen-based 
displays tend to use either natural metaphors or symbols for 
encoding data. The focus tends to be in mapping layers of 
information into art-like compositions, typically in the form 
of pictures or posters [6]. Often these systems adopt a wall-
based, ‘Informative Art’ approach [6].  
This Informative Art approach is well documented where 
screen-based technologies are typically used to visualize a 
live data source by enhancing the attributes of an existing 
artwork. For example, the work of Piet Mondrian has been 
the inspiration for a dynamic display where the volume of 
email received is represented through the size of colored 
shapes [6].  
Around 51% of all reviewed Ambient Displays were 
found to make use of tangible objects. Given their sculptural 
nature these displays were found to take numerous forms and 
use a range of modalities. The distribution of modalities 
across object-based displays was similar to the domain as a 
whole, with a high proportion of light-based systems. 
Due to their physical nature, these displays are also 
referred to as being sculptural in form [3] and could be 
classified as Tangible User Interfaces [35]. This group of 
Ambient Displays are implemented using diverse hardware 
that ranges from augmented household objects through to 
more complex custom-built artefacts. The creation of these

Figure 2. Distribution of Ambient Displays classified by physical form. Numbers directly reference identifiers in the systematic review data [31]
displays typically combines off-the-shelf technologies or 
requires custom hardware to be built. Unlike screen-based 
displays, the amount of information that can be displayed 
on object-based displays is usually limited as these displays 
only support a few attributes of information [3]. As a result, 
the time and effort required to build these tangible objects 
may be greater than using off the shelf display hardware, 
although more tangible forms may allow for a further 
subtle visualization through display mechanicians that may 
not be light based. This approach is well documented in an 
early example of the technology, the ambientROOM where 
sound and object-based projections are used to visualize 
data [35].   
VI. 
INTERACTIVITY 
Ambient Displays are typically designed to function 
with no direct input from the user. This non-interrupting, 
approach follows the basic tenants of Calm Technology. 
Therefore, these displays might be expected to remain fully 
ambient and only output information. However, some 
systems while predominantly ambient, also support a low 
level of direct interaction. In contrast to fully ambient 
systems, displays that provide a minimal level of 
interactivity are classified as semi-ambient.  
The systematic survey identified 58% (n=266/459) of 
the reported systems as fully ambient, accepting no input 
from the user. Such systems, by design are intended to not 
interrupt the user’s primary attention and remain 
peripheral. Many of the traditional examples of Ambient 
Displays, such as the Dangling String [8] have no direct 
interaction. They reside within their environments 
presenting information without need or support for user 
input. 
Despite this non-interactive expectation, the inclusion 
of active or passive interaction features were still 
reasonably common (42%, n=193/459). These semi-
ambient systems still aim to remain peripheral but possess 
interactive capabilities that may move the system to the 
centre of the user’s attention for short periods of time. The 
intent is to allow momentary interaction from the user so 
they can configure, enhance or in some other way 
manipulate the function of the display. For example, to 
change the display features, connect to another data source, 
or change the data mappings.

Figure 3. Distribution of Ambient Displays over time, classified by interactivity. Numbers directly reference identifiers in the systematic review data [3]
These semi-ambient systems adopt several interaction 
methods to enhance the function of the Ambient Display. 
This includes the use of buttons, touch screens, local 
sensing technologies, body movements and eye contact. 
These interaction events are typically optional and are 
usually designed to change the on-screen visualization or 
enable additional interactive features. While the inclusion 
of interaction into Ambient Displays may increase their 
utility in some situations, display designers are typically 
conscious of the effect that excessive interactivity may 
have on the peripheral nature of the device. 
A good example of the novel approaches taken to 
reduce the imposition of potential interactive features is in 
the Ambient Widget [40], where interaction is optional 
depending on the user’s distance from the device. While 
being far away from the device, the user will be presented 
with information in a subtle and visual manner as in other 
more traditional Ambient Display implementations. As 
they move closer, the user will be granted the option for 
more direct gesture-based interactions with the display 
[40], limiting the requirement of interaction to those who 
desire more detailed information than presented by the 
device’s more ambient mode.  
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This longitudinal review of the field of Ambient 
Display highlights the great diversity in display modality, 
visualization approaches, form and levels of interaction. In 
this systematic review we categorized a large subset of 
these displays across the three broad design dimensions of; 
modality, physical form and level of interaction. 
These displays adopt a range of modalities including 
light, sound, object movement, object manipulation, 
vibration and olfaction. Seventy-six percent of the displays 
used 
light 
as 
the 
only 
modality 
for 
output. 
This diversity in modality is indicative of recent 
advancements in the field where display development 
remains common along with the exploration of various 
output modalities. Some contemporary examples include: 
low resolution light displays to visualise energy usage [46], 
ambient lights that visualise stress levels [47], monitoring 
of weather conditions through an LED enabled sculpture 
[48], signalling of driving decisions through coloured light

AMBIENT 2020 : The Tenth International Conference on Ambient Computing, Applications, Services and Technologies

[49], presenting peripheral information through emerging 
augmented reality technologies [50], visualising heart rate 
through a light emitting wearable device [51], displaying 
information through plant [52] or human [53] shadows and 
to engage people with dementia through Ambient Displays 
[54]. While these recent developments in the field are 
indicative of the technologies covered in this review an 
analysis of literature from 2017 and onwards represents an 
opportunity for further research.   
When categorizing the Ambient Displays by form 
about half of the displays used standard screen-based 
display technology, while the other half were based on 
tangible everyday objects. There is a clear divide here 
between the two types of display. Two distinguishing 
features of these groups are the greater complexity of 
information that can be displayed using screen-based 
devices and the limited range of information opportunities 
and bespoke development requirements for tangible 
objects.  
The final category considered interaction level and 
identified 58% of the displays to be fully ambient while 
42% provided some low-level of interaction. In terms of 
utility, the non-interactive displays are most aligned to the 
principles of Calm Computing, as the user is not distracted 
from their primary task by engaging with the display. The 
inclusion of interactive features may seem counterintuitive 
to the creation of peripheral technologies. However, these 
systems usually try to adhere to the tenets of the Calm 
Computing by limiting the frequency of interaction, 
allowing voluntary interaction or providing more passive 
methods of interfacing. 
In addition to these themes, it was found that most of 
the Ambient Display literature simultaneously considers 
the design, development and evaluation of the technology 
(n=254). This results in limited studies relating to non-
implementation specific evaluation methods and literature 
discussing the theory underpinning the field. In this sense, 
there would be opportunity for further research regarding 
these more theoretical areas of the domain in a field 
dominated by practice-based studies.
