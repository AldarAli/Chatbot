Abstract—An ethanol sensor incorporating nanostructured 
zinc oxide film and silicon micromachining is reported.  A 
salient feature of the sensor is its lower operating temperature 
which has been achieved due to the use of nanostructured 
material as sensing layer. A suitably designed nickel 
microheater has been integrated with the sensor. The optimum 
temperature of operation for ethanol sensing was found to be 
100 °C, though the sensor could operate at temperature as low 
as 50 °C with reduced sensitivity. The power consumption, at 
an operating temperature of 100 °C, was 180 mW while at 50 
°C, it is only 90 mW. The sensor is capable of giving detectable 
response for concentrations of ethanol vapor as low as 10 ppm.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Sensors based on metal oxides for detection of volatile 
organic compounds (VOCs) and gases have been widely 
investigated because of their small size, low cost and 
compatibility with semiconductor processing. ZnO has great 
potential for use in gas sensors because of the high mobility 
of conduction electrons and good chemical and thermal 
stability under the operating conditions. The higher 
operating temperature (approximately 400 °C) and poor 
sensitivity are some of the major concerns in using ZnO as 
sensing layer [1]. The use of CMOS (complimentary metal 
oxide semiconductor) compatible MEMS (micro-electro-
mechanical-systems) technologies in sensor fabrication is 
advantageous on account of miniaturization of the devices, 
lower power consumption, faster sensor response, batch 
fabrication at reduced cost and greater sensitivity [2–5].  
The use of nano-structured materials for the sensing 
device is envisaged to further improve the sensitivity of 
these devices. This is attributed to enormously increased 
surface to volume ratio compared to their bulk counterpart. 
It is further envisaged that the use of nanostructured 
material may leads to lowering of operating temperature of 
gas sensors based on metal oxide semiconductors [6]. Very 
few reports have been published on sensors using nano-
structured ZnO thin film on micromachined silicon 
substrate [8, 9]. In most of the publications on sensors 
incorporating micromachined microheaters, either platinum 
or polysilicon microheater has been used as the heating 
element as these materials are particularly suitable for the 
higher temperature operation (400–700 °C) [10-12].  
Furthermore, with a view to reduce the power consumption, 
the platforms for micromachined gas sensor reported so far 
are based on a SiO2-Si3N4 composite layer on a thick (~ 400 
μm) silicon substrate [13]. A thin Si plug underneath the 
dielectric membrane can be used for achieving uniform 
temperature distribution over the active heater area owing to 
the higher thermal conductivity of Si [14]. Recently, few 
reports on operating gas sensors at relatively lower 
temperatures using nanotextured semiconducting oxides 
have been published [7, 15]. This type of gas sensor 
operates at relatively lower temperature (150–250 °C) and 
does not require an expensive Pt or poly-Si microheater [7, 
15]. The microheater may be fabricated using a low cost 
material such as nickel.  
The present work is an attempt to address the problems 
of elevated operating temperature and high power 
consumption by taking a twin approach namely: (a) 
reducing the operating temperature through the use of 
nanostructured metal oxide (ZnO) and (b) reducing the 
power consumption through the deployment of MEMS 
structure with a thin silicon membrane. In this paper we 
report 
a 
nanostructured 
ZnO 
based 
sensor 
using 
micromachined silicon substrate for efficient detection of 
ethanol vapors in the range of 200 – 1000 ppm at fairly low 
operating temperature of 50 °C. For this purpose, a nickel 
microheater 
has 
been 
designed 
and 
monolithically 
integrated with the sensor to obtain the required heating of 
the sensing layer. The response of the nanostructured ZnO 
based sensor having an integrated nickel microheater has 
been evaluated at different operating temperatures in the 
range of 30–100 °C, for different concentrations of ethanol 
vapors.  
 
II. 
EXPERIMENTAL WORK 
A schematic drawing of the sensor structure is shown in 
Fig. 1 and the corresponding process flowchart is shown in 
Fig. 2. The starting silicon wafer is 280 μm thick, N-type, 
having 5-10 Ω-cm resistivity and (100) orientation. A layer 
of SiO2 (0.8 μm) was grown by thermal oxidation process. 
After opening a window in SiO2 by photolithography 
technique 
on 
the 
backside 
of 
the 
wafer, 
bulk 
micromachining was carried out in 40 % KOH solution at a 
temperature of 80 °C, to obtain a 100 μm Si membrane.

A silicon oxide layer (0.8 μm) was then grown in the 
next step. The purpose of this oxidation is to reduce the 
thermal losses from the backside of the membrane. A layer 
of nickel (0.3 μm thickness) was then deposited using RF 
diode sputtering on the front side of the oxidized wafer. The 
Ni layer was then patterned using photolithography to form 
the microheater. The meander shaped Ni microheater has 
line- width of 100 µm and the gap between the lines was 
also kept 100 μm. A layer of SiO2 (0.8 µm) was then sputter 
deposited on the front side of the wafer. The purpose of this 
step is to electrically isolate the heater and the aluminum 
interdigital electrodes (to be formed in the next step). The 
aluminum layer of 0.8 µm was then deposited by thermal 
evaporation and patterned to form the sensing interdigital 
electrodes. A thin film of Zn (0.3 µm) was then deposited 
by 
thermal 
evaporation 
and 
patterned 
using 
photolithography process.  The wafer was then heated to 
300 °C in air for 6 h and cooled slowly to room 
temperature. It was observed that, following the annealing 
process, the color of the deposited Zn films turned white 
from the grey color of the as-deposited zinc films. The 
active area of the sensing layer was 2 mm X 2 mm while the 
total chip size was 5 mm X 5 mm.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The SEM image of the backside of the membrane is 
shown in the Fig. 3. Most of the papers reported so far use a 
freestanding 
dielectric 
layer 
(SiO2 
or 
SiO2–Si3N4 
composite) for lower power consumption and higher 
operating temperature at the cost of long-term stability [16-
17]. In the present work, a 100 μm Si membrane has been 
used for better mechanical stability which also provides 
fairly good temperature uniformity. The SEM image of Ni 
microheater is shown in Fig. 4. The resistance of the heater 
was measured to be about 120 Ω. The experimentally

measured power consumption versus temperature graph for 
the Ni microheater is shown in Fig. 5. 
It can be observed that the power consumption, at a 
temperature of 50 °C, was 90 mW and at 100 °C, it was 180 
mW. The microheater was driven by 5 V supply. The X-ray 
diffractograms (XRD) of the as-deposited Zn film and ZnO 
film (obtained by annealing of Zn film in air at 300 ºC for 6 
h) are shown in Fig. 6. The XRD of the annealed film 
shows the peaks corresponding to ZnO, confirming that the 
Zn film has been completely oxidized to form ZnO. The 
SEM image of nanostructured ZnO film is shown in Fig.7. 
It can be seen that the film consists of nanocombs of ZnO. It 
is further observed that each comb is composed of stem to 
which many nanowires are attached. The nanowires have 
diameter in the range 40-50 nm and length of up to 500 nm.   
The sensor was tested for ethanol vapors in a closed 
chamber. The sensor was heated to different temperatures 
by applying power to the integrated heater. The ethanol 
vapors were introduced in the chamber by bubbling N2 
through the ethanol maintained at room temperature (20 
°C). The desired concentration of the vapors was obtained 
in the chamber by controlling the flow rate of N2 through 
ethanol and adding pure air through a separate gas line [18]. 
The flow rates were measured and controlled using 
precession flow meters. The concentration of ethanol vapors 
was calculated using the following equation [19].

Based on this equation, the relationship between the flow 
rates and the concentration of ethanol in ppm is summarized 
in Table1. Fig. 8 shows the response (Ra-Rg) / Rg of the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sensor for 200 ppm of ethanol vapors as a function of its 
operating temperature. Here, we define Ra and Rg as the 
resistance of the sensor in clean air and in the ethanol 
containing air respectively. From Fig. 8, it can be observed 
that the maximum sensitivity is achieved at the operating 
temperature of 100 °C. At the lowest operating      
temperature of 30 °C, the sensitivity falls significantly, but 
the sensor is still able to detect the presence of ethanol.   
 
Table I. Relationship between flow rates and ethanol vapor concentrations 
in the test chamber at 20 °C. The vapor pressure (P*) of ethanol at 20 °C is 
67.5 mm of Hg [19, 20].  
 
At 50 °C, the sensitivity of the sensor improves 
significantly. It is evident from Fig. 8 that as the operating 
temperature of the sensor decreases the time to reach the 
saturation level increases. This is consistent with the 
operation of gas sensors based on metal oxides [9, 12]. Fig. 
9 shows the response of the sensor to successively 
increasing concentrations of ethanol vapor. This was 
achieved by increasing the flow rate of N2 through the 
bubbler corresponding to the desired concentration levels, 
as shown in Table 1. As expected, the sensitivity increases 
for higher concentrations of ethanol. Furthermore, it can be

seen that there is varying delay in reaching the saturation 
value of the sensor resistance, as the ethanol concentration 
is increased in steps. Since the volume of the test chamber 
is quite large (14 L) in our test set up, this does not reflect 
the true response time of the sensor [18].  The dynamic 
response of the sensor was also evaluated. For this purpose, 
the N2 gas (flowing through the bubbler) was turned ON 
and 
OFF 
periodically, 
as 
indicated 
in 
Fig. 
10. 
Measurements were made at an operating temperature of 50 
°C. It is evident that the response of the sensor is 
reproducible for the selected concentration of ethanol 
vapors (200 ppm). The response and recovery time of the 
sensor was almost constant for several cycles which show 
the good repeatability of the sensor. It was also found that 
the sensor is sensitive to humidity. Furthermore, if more 
than one VOC vapors are present then the sensor may give 
false response.

We have successfully synthesized nanostructured ZnO by 
a low cost process of oxidation of Zn film in air without 
using any template or catalyst. The integration of the 
nanostructured ZnO with sensor fabrication process is 
demonstrated. The sensitivity of the sensor is significantly 
enhanced and the operating temperature is considerably 
reduced by using the ZnO nanostructured material. 
Lowering of the operating temperature of the sensor has 
significant advantage in terms of power consumption and 
choice of the heater material. A low cost nickel heater has 
been successfully integrated with the sensor in the present 
work.  ZnO based MEMS micro-hotplate (with Ni 
microheater) provides a promising platform for low power 
sensors for ethanol sensing at a fairly low operating 
temperature of 50 ºC. Integration of nanostructure ZnO film 
along with MEMS technology provides a platform for low 
power low temperature sensor with appreciable sensitivity 
and response time. It will be interesting to see the sensor 
behavior in the presence of other VOCs.
