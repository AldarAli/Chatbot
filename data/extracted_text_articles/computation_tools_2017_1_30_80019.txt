Abstract—Information Security Management is focused on pro-
cesses and it is currently guided by control-based standards such
as ISO27002. Controls may be: management objectives, available
resources or desired behaviours that contribute to information
security. Under this process perspective, to reach some security
level means to accomplish a speciﬁc set of controls. There are
qualitative approaches and maturity models that help managers
to select what controls to implement next, whilst quantitative
approaches have just recently emerged under simpliﬁed formula-
tions. The purpose of this paper is to show an answer set solution
to the problem of selecting what controls to implement next, based
on a given budget, security proﬁt, and temporal dependencies
between controls. The solution is illustrated by using Clingo.

INTRODUCTION
A standard for information security consists of a set of
rules that aim to regulate a company's operation, with a
special emphasis on information management and information
assurance. In general, the accomplishment of some information
security standard means to achieve a set of objectives, get
resources or implement actions deﬁned by the standards [1].
All these elements are known as information security controls
[2] and may be grouped by dimensions.
In particular, one of the most widely-known security stan-
dards is ISO/IEC 27001:2013 [3]. This standard proposes
114 controls classiﬁed in 14 main dimensions, described in
ISO/IEC 27002:2013 [4]. The degree of compliance with
these controls determines the organization's security level and
whether it can apply for certiﬁcation.
Therefore, the map of implemented/non-implemented con-
trols becomes a management tool to progress in information
security. In Table
I, some examples of controls and their
corresponding dimensions from ISO27002 are shown.
The general problem of managing information security has
been addressed through different approaches and different dis-
ciplines [5]–[7]. Various frameworks have been proposed for
measuring the level of standard compliance [8]–[11]; however,
these approaches do not suggest a plan for the implementation
of controls, obtained quantitatively from the current level of
compliance to some desired security level.
Investigations in this area have led to the incorporation of
quantitative methods for managing security controls, some of
them based on multicriteria analysis, such as, [12]–[14]. Other
investigations [15]–[21], combined the System Grey Theory
[22] with other quantitative techniques of analysis.

Another investigation proposed a simulation-based ap-
proach [23]–[25]. In this approach, simulated attacks are run
over a model of the organization. Each attack occurs under
different scenarios of implemented controls. According to
the results of the simulations, the optimal set of controls is
determined. The difﬁculty of this method is that choosing
different sets of controls to simulate an attack is a human task
within a combinatorial framework.
It seems clear that optimizing controls implementations
is an open problem where quantitative approaches are just
emerging. In [26] ,the conceptual framework for a quantitative
optimization approach and several types of constraints are de-
scribed. Mainly, we remark the temporal dependency between
controls, the existence of a given budget, and the objective
function focused on maximizing security by minimizing vul-
nerabilities.
To solve this quantitative optimization problem, we propose
an answer set solution approach. Answer set programming is
a research product on knowledge representation, logic pro-
gramming and constraint satisfaction to cope mainly with np-
hard problems [27]. Nowadays, there are some mature tools
allowing the speciﬁcation and solution of general models [28].
In this paper, we propose a speciﬁc solution approach for
selecting controls by using the answer set tool named Clingo
[29]. Clingo is a framework to solve combinatorial problems
with Answer Set Programming (ASP), a simple and powerful
modeling language [30].
In order to show the solution, in section II, we explain

the basis of the model by means of a small, but illustrative
example. In section III, we show the results of applying the
model using data from a public governmental ofﬁce. The
conclusion section highlights the simplicity of the proposed
model but also the necessity to compare this approach to
traditional models from operational research.
II.
ANSWER SET MODELLING FOR SELECTING SECURITY
CONTROLS
The basic principle to be applicable in an answer set
solution is that there are different possible solutions, i.e.,
there is a space of solutions to be evaluated. An answer set
program may be composed of four sections: (i) the ﬁrst section
expressing the basic conﬁguration of the problem, (ii) the
second section for generating the different answer sets, (iii)
the third section for the derived or non basic deﬁnitions plus
the terms to evaluate solutions, and (iv) the fourth section
containing the problem constraints. These forms are brieﬂy
reviewed.
The basic conﬁguration is composed of true facts, which
are represented as literals (classic propositions) or predicates
on speciﬁc literals (objects). The possible forms are as follows:
l0.
P1(l1).
P2(l2, l3).
(1)
To represent the different answer sets, rules are needed.
These rules are known as the disjunctive form because several
alternatives, represented as a set, may be generated starting
from proved facts. These rules have the following form:
l{A0, A1, ..., Ak} u ← A1, ..., An.
(2)
Under this form, the alternatives in the set stay bound by l
and u, and these values represent the minimum and maximum
number of elements in the set, provided, of course, that it is
possible to derive them from the true conjuctions A1 to An.
The third section should represent the deﬁnitions in the
universe of discourse. In this case, the rules follow a simpliﬁed
version of the previous form, this time without alternative sets,
i.e., having only predicates on variables or literals in the left
part. Thus, classical deﬁnitions may have the following form:
P0(V0) ← A1, A2, ...
P1(V1, V2) ← B1, B2, ...
(3)
The fourth section speciﬁes the constraints. These are
speciﬁed similar to the previous rules, but having only the
right part, as follows:
← A0, A1, ..., An.
(4)
In order to illustrate the given solution, we consider an
example having ten controls, a set of temporal dependencies,
and each control having its corresponding implementation
cost and also a corresponding security proﬁt. In Fig. 1, we
show the basic conﬁguration of the example. First, we have
the identiﬁcation of the control (C1 to C10), its cost and
proﬁt (third value). This security proﬁt is abstract and may
be considered from a single increment in the percentage of a
standard accomplishment, to the reduction of vulnerabilities
belonging to key information assets. The dependencies are
represented by the curly brackets. For example, the control
C5 may be implemented if and only if controls C1 and C2
have been already implemented.
Figure 1. Candidate controls to implement, their cost, proﬁt and
dependencies.
Firstly, we notice that there are several possible answers
that match the answer set conditions to be applied, under
a bounded budget. For example, for a given budget of 500,
we may have an implementation plan including the controls
C3, C8 and C10, having a total cost of 390 (150+100+140)
and a total proﬁt of 6 (3+2+1). But also we may have an
implementation plan including the controls C1, C2 and C6
having a total cost of 492 and a total proﬁt of 11.
In order to code the solution, we have used Clingo 4.5.4
[29]. As described above, we divide the explanation in four
parts.
To conﬁgure the basic initial state, we have used the
predicates: control, for setting the variables that represent
controls, cost, for specifying the implementation cost of each
control, and require, for representing the dependencies be-
tween controls. In Fig. 2, we show the Clingo sentences for
this conﬁguration.

To represent the answer sets, we have used two rules that
we show in Fig. 3. The ﬁrst rule represents that it is possible to
plan a speciﬁc control (variable Y) provided that this control
does not depend on other controls. The bounds 0 and 1 specify
that this control may or may not be part of the solution. The
second rule states that a control that depend on others can also
be part of the solution, provided that all their required controls
(totalRequired) have been planned (totalIncluded).

Figure 3. Rules generation.
The necessary deﬁnitions are in Fig. 4. Here, we deﬁne the
formulas for total cost, total proﬁt, total number of required
controls for each control, and total number of planned controls
among the required ones. Finally, we show the deﬁnition of
terminal controls that are deﬁned as those controls that do not
require the implementation of previous controls in order to
plan them.

Finally, the fourth section is shown in Fig. 5. This contains
the deﬁnition of the available budget and the constraint that the
total cost needs to always be less than the budget. Moreover,
Clingo allows to add optimization expressions by using the
macro clauses maximize or minimize. In this case, we have
used maximize to search for the best result on information
security proﬁt (totalProﬁt). In Fig. 6, the result is illustrated,
as displayed by Clingo. For the given example, the solution
included the controls C1, C3, C4, C6 and C7, having a total
cost of 871 and a total proﬁt of 19.
Finally, we present Table II, to illustrate the combinatorial
power of this problem, under the given constraints.

EXAMPLE
To illustrate the operation of the proposal in a real situation,
we have applied the proposed model to a situation adapted
from a real audit of a public organization of the Chilean State.
The proposal must recommend the optimal set of controls to

be implemented, considering a limited budget, the costs of
implementing the controls and the beneﬁts obtained by the
progress in complying with the controls of the standard.
In this case, the organization wished to evaluate its compli-
ance with three standards of information security to which it
subscribed. As a public entity, the organization must comply
with the information security regulations established by the
Government of Chile: (i) Supreme Decree 83 (DS83) [31], a
security standard for public ofﬁces; and (ii) the methodological
guide for information security (GUI) [32], in the framework
of the Chilean government’s improvement program, which
describes the technical requirements associated with the diag-
nosis, planning and implementation of an information security
system. In addition, the organization decided to evaluate its
compliance with the international ISO Standard 27001, in its
2005 version.
For the purposes of the example, we will only present the
dimension referring to the security of facilities, since it was the
main focus of evaluation after the earthquake of the year 2010
in Chile. In this dimension, we analyzed 30 controls from the
three above standards.
The beneﬁts associated to each control were established
considering the standard to which they belong to. We represent
greater beneﬁts on those controls explicitly mentioned into
the Chilean norms of information security for public insti-
tutions. Therefore, those controls, that belong to more than
one standard, will report a greater beneﬁt to the organization.
Considering this, a higher score was given to the controls
that met the rules of the government of Chile and those that
satisﬁed more than one norm.
The implementation costs of each control were estimated
based on the operating conditions of the organization. In
addition, a budget constraint was assigned to the problem.
In this way, the model delivers the set of controls that,
considering costs and budget, provides the higher beneﬁt to
the organization. The implementation of the situation yielded
18 possible responses to the problem, which met the con-
straints of the problem. Table
III, summarizes the progress
of the optimization process. The table shows the number of
implemented controls (second column), their corresponding
cost (third column) and the previewed beneﬁt (fourth column).
It should be noted that the 18 delivered answers do not
correspond to the total universe of possible solutions. The
implementation only shows those sets of controls that present a
better proﬁt than the previous answers. Therefore, the last line
represents the ﬁnal recommendation which includes a set of 22
controls that reports a beneﬁt of 55 at a cost of $ 19.950.000
(expressed in Chilean money).

case example can be downloaded from [33]

CONCLUSIONS
A contemporary approach to manage information secu-
rity on organizations is following process-based standards
as the family of norms ISO/IEC27000. This process recom-
mends the implementation of a set of security controls (e.g.
ISO/IEC27002). From this perspective, in order to accomplish
the standard, an information security assessment produces,
as relevant outcomes, a set of controls already implemented
and another set of controls to implement. Making a decision

about the next information security controls to implement
is a np-hard problem. This has been demonstrated in [34]
for the general problem of process-based compliance norms.
Under this approach, the unique isomorphism to apply is
to consider as separate tasks the implementation of security
controls, which is what we have modeled in our answer set
programming approach.
Although other quantitative solutions have been proposed,
here we have presented a solution having three kinds of
constraints: temporal dependencies between controls, a limited
budget, and different information security proﬁts given by the
different controls to implement. Under the consideration of
this set of different variables, as far as we know, it is the most
complex quantitative solution shown in an academic setting.
We have shown an answer set programming solution simple
and illustrative. Firstly, we have shown that a quantitative
solution is not hard to implement, and, moreover, secondly,
it can be easily extended to support additional controls (facts)
and constraints, due to the modular nature of rules in answer
set programming.
However, it is known that answer set solutions are based
on general optimization settings. For this reason, it logically
follows that speciﬁc operational research solutions may present
a better performance. Therefore, in terms of future work, we
will compare this answer set programming solution to classical
optimization algorithms on operation research platforms, but
we would like to add modelling time as a variable to observe.
