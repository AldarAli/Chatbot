Abstract - The inner dependence Analytic Hierarchy 
Process (AHP) is useful for the cases in which criteria or/and 
alternatives are not independent enough and related to 
modeling and optimization. However, using the original AHP 
or inner dependence AHP may cause results that cannot have 
enough reliability because of the inconsistency of the 
comparison matrix as data. In such cases, fuzzy representation 
for weighting criteria or/and alternatives using results from 
sensitivity analysis is useful. In this research, we first define 
fuzzy local weights of criteria and alternatives. Moreover, via 
fuzzy sets, overall weights for double inner dependence 
structure AHP in 4 levels are obtained.  
Keywords -  AHP; fuzzy sets; sensitivity analysis. 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) proposed by T.L. 
Saaty in 1977 [1] is widely used in decision making, 
because it reflects humans feelings naturally. A normal AHP 
assumes independence among criteria and alternatives, 
although it is difficult to choose enough independent 
elements. The inner dependence method AHP [2] is used to 
solve this problem even for criteria or alternatives having 
dependence.  
On the other hand, the comparison data matrix may not 
have enough consistency when AHP is applied because, for 
instance, a problem may contain too many criteria or 
alternatives for decision making. It means that answers from 
decision-makers, i.e., components of the matrix, do not have 
enough reliability. They may be too ambiguous or too fuzzy 
[3][5]. To avoid this problem, we usually have to revise 
again, but it takes a lot of time and costs. 
Then, we consider that weights should also have 
ambiguity or fuzziness. Therefore, it is necessary to 
represent these weights using fuzzy sets. In our research, we 
first applied sensitivity analysis to normal AHP to analyze 
how much the components of a pairwise comparison matrix 
influence the weight or consistency of a matrix, and 
proposed new fuzzy weight representation for criteria and 
alternatives in normal AHP. Then, a representation of 
criteria weights for inner dependence AHP was proposed 
using L-R fuzzy numbers [4]. In the next step, we started to 
deal with double inner dependence structure [6] and their 
fuzzy weight.  
We now consider fuzziness for double inner dependence 
[7][8] (among actors and criteria, respectively) when a 
comparison matrix among elements does not have enough 
consistency in 4 levels problem (object, actors, criteria and 
alternatives). 
In Sections 2 and 3, we introduce the inner dependence 
AHP, consistency index, and sensitivity analyses for AHP. 
Then, in Section 4, we define fuzzy weights for double inner 
dependence structure, and Section 5 is a summary. 
 
II.  CONSISTENCY AND INNER DEPENDENCE  
A. 
Process of Normal AHP 
 (Process 1) Representation of structure by a hierarchy. 
The problem under consideration can be represented in a 
hierarchical structure. At the middle levels, there are 
multiple criteria. Alternative elements are put at the lowest 
level of the hierarchy. 
(Process 2) Paired comparison between elements at each 
level. A pairwise comparison matrix A is created from a 
decision maker's answers. Let n be the number of elements 
at a certain level, the upper triangular components of the  
matrix aij (i< j = 1,…,n) are 9, 8, .. , 2, 1, 1/2, …, or 1/9. 
These denote intensities of importance from element i to j. 
The lower triangular components aji are described with 
reciprocal numbers, for diagonal elements, let aii = 1.  
(Process 3) Calculations of weight at each level. The 
weights of the elements, which represent grades of 
importance among each element, are calculated from the 
pairwise 
comparison 
matrix. 
The 
eigenvector 
that 
corresponds to a positive eigenvalue of the matrix is used in 
calculations throughout in the paper. 
(Process 4) Priority of an alternative by a composition of 
weights. With repetition of composition of weights, the 
overall weights of the alternative, which are the priorities of 
the alternatives with respect to the overall objective, are 
finally found. 
B. 
Consistency 
Since components of the comparison matrix are obtained 
by comparisons between two elements, coherent consistency 
is not guaranteed.  In AHP, the consistency of the 
comparison matrix A is measured by the following 
consistency index (C.I.)

where n is the order of comparison matrix A, and λA is its 
maximum eigenvalue (Frobenius root). 
If the value of C.I. becomes smaller, then the degree of 
consistency 
becomes 
higher, 
and 
vice 
versa. 
The 
comparison matrix is consistent if the following holds.

Inner Dependence Structure  
The normal AHP ordinarily assumes independence 
among criteria and alternatives, although it is difficult to 
choose enough independent elements. The dependency 
means some kind of interaction among the elements. Inner 
dependence AHP [2] is used to solve this type of problem 
even for criteria or alternatives having dependence.  
In the method, using a dependency matrix F={ fij }, we 
can calculate modified weights w(n) as follows, 
where w represents weights from independent criteria or 
alternatives, i.e., normal weights of normal AHP and 
dependency matrix F is consist of eigenvectors of influence 
matrices showing dependency among criteria or alternatives.   
If there is dependence in both lower levels, i.e., not only 
among criteria but also among alternatives, we call such 
kind of structure ”double inner dependence”. In the double 
inner dependence structure, we have to calculate modified 
weights of criteria and alternatives,  w(n) and ui
(n). Then we 
composite these 2 modified weights to obtain overall 
weights of alternative k,

                               (4) 
where m is the number of criteria. 
Also, using the same steps again, we can composite 
weights of ”triple inner dependence” structure, in the case 
when there is dependency in the 3 lower levels, i.e., not only 
among alternatives and 1 level criteria but also 2 levels of 
criteria. 
III. SENSITIVITY ANALYSES 
When we use AHP in some applications, it often occurs 
that a comparison matrix is not consistent or that there is not 
great difference among the overall weights of the 
alternatives. In these cases, it is very important to 
investigate how components of the pairwise comparison 
matrix influence its consistency or the weights. In this 
study, we use a method that some of the present authors 
have proposed before. It evaluates a fluctuation of the 
consistency index and the weights when the comparison 
matrix is perturbed. It is useful because it does not change 
the structure of the data. 
Since the pairwise comparison matrix is a positive 
square matrix, Perron-Frobenius theorem holds. From 
Perron-Frobenius theorem, the following theorem about a 
perturbed comparison matrix holds. 
Theorem 1 Let A = (aij), (i, j = 1,…, n) denote a comparison 
matrix and let A(ε) = A+εDA, DA=(aijdij) denote a matrix 
that has been perturbed. Let λA be the Frobenius root of A, 
w be the eigenvector corresponding toλA, and v be the 
eigenvector corresponding to the Frobenius root of A'. 
Then, a Frobenius root λ ( ε ) of A( ε ) and a 
corresponding eigenvector w( ε ) can be expressed as 
follows

About a fluctuation of the consistency index, the

Then, we can evaluate how the components of a 
comparison matrix impart influence on the weights, to see 
hij
(k) in  (10). 
 Proofs of these corollaries are shown in [4]. 
IV.  FUZZY WEIGHTS REPRESENTATIONS 
When a comparison matrix has poor consistency (i.e.,  
0.1<C.I.<0.2), 
comparison 
matrix 
components 
are 
considered to be fuzzy because they are results from human 
fuzzy judgment. Weights should therefore be treated as 
fuzzy numbers [5][6]. 
Definition 1 (fuzzy weight) Let wk
(n) be a crisp weight of 
criterion or alternative k of inner dependence model, and gij | 
hij
(k)| denote the coefficients found in Corollary 1 and 2. If 
0.1<C.I.<0.2, then a fuzzy weight 
k
w   is defined by

Then, we assume about double inner dependence 
structure in 4 levels problem. For example, above of the 
criteria level there might be actor’s level for decision. 
“Leisure in holiday with family” may have 4 family actors 
{father, mother, older child A, younger child B}, 4 criteria 
{popularity, good for rain, fatigue, expense} and 4 
alternatives {theme park, indoor theme park, cinema, zoo}. 
They may have dependency structure at 2 in 4 levels and 
inconsistency in some levels. 
Even in these cases, we can define overall weights of 
alternatives with fuzzy representation using sensitivity 
analysis. Let the modified local weight of a actors,

V.   CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
There are many cases in which data of AHP does not 
have enough reliability. For these cases, we propose fuzzy 
weight representation and compositions for double inner 
dependence in 4 levels AHP using sensitivity analysis.  Our 
approach can show how to represent weights and is efficient 
to investigate how the result of AHP has fuzziness even if 
data are not enough consistent or reliable. 
In the next step, we must find better fuzzy multiplication 
for composition fuzzy weights.
