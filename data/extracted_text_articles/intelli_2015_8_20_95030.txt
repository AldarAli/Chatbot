INTRODUCTION
There is no denying that the manufacturing industry is
facing
a
transition
towards
a
completely
interrelated
knowledge-based business [1]. Intelligent machines, which
are able to communicate and are aware of their own status,
are becoming indispensable in order to assure and enlarge
the competitive advantage and to help the process towards a
flexible and sustainable production. This paper describes the
business
process
and
respective
criteria
for
on-hand
incorporation of NETDEVs into the production line.
A NETDEV is an acronym for Network-Enabled-
Devices. These can be considered as logical entities, which
encapsulate a device, as equipment or part of equipment, a
single sensor or network of sensors or a combination of these
components. In general, NETDEVs are able to incorporate
build-in intelligence based on a set of models. These models
enable the production device to expedite ramp-up process,
find
optimal
process
parameters,
and
support
for
maintenance and quality assessment.
The concept and the
NETDEV itself has been developed within the EU-funded
research project I-RAMP³ [4], whose goal is the creation of
novel solutions for enhancing competitiveness of European
industry sector by creating a concept for fast and optimized
ramp-up and operation of production lines.
For the majority of companies creating an added value
with operating machines, the incorporation of network-
enabled
devices
is
projected
to
be
advantageous.
However, prior to the implementation into active production
lines, it has to be considered that implementations like these
require an inter-divisional composition of all business
processes, considering evaluation, planning, and change
management. For every company, the de facto person in
charge of production output and production costs, e.g.,
Chief-Technical-Officer (CTO), has to analyze the current
state-of-the-art of the manufacturing facility and, based on
this, to fathom if the advantages of an implementation
prevail.
In Section 2, an overview for a business process for
implementing NETDEVs is being provided. Section 3
describes the target definition, as first phase, in more detail,
followed by a conclusion in Section 4.
II.
GENERAL APPROACH
The process of implementation should go along with
existing planning standards, such as the planning process
according to VDI 5200-1 “Factory planning” [2] (Figure 1)
or
other
approaches
aiming
to
execute
green-field
installations,
expansions,
or
re-structuring
of
existing
production facilities. As reference for a planning structure,
this instruction was chosen as it is considered as a common
planning standard to decision makers within the industrial
environment.

SMART
(“Specific,

Accepted, Realistic, and Timely”) targets the first phase aims
to set the goals for the future project. In the use case of
implementing NETDEVs into an existing production line,
decisions have to be made on which equipment is technically
applicable with the upgrade using NETDEVs. Also, its
economic viability has to be reviewed before a final
definition on the scope can be determined. This paper is
focusing on the process of this phase, which will be
examined in detail in the following sections.
After fixing the final definition of the scope, structured
requirement analysis, considering framework conditions, use
cases and scenarios, roles will follow in a second step. The
design of the NETDEV architecture would follow according

to standardized, but customized to the requirements of
NETDEV implementation, development methodologies.
In the phase of implementation, acceptance procedures
and standardized methods for change management could be
applicable. This would go along with appropriate training of
personnel,
manual
working
instructions,
and
documentations, which are based on the results of the
requirement analysis and following phases.
III.
PHASE I: TARGET DEFINITION
Starting with target definition, it becomes clear that a
differentiation has to be made which production machines
should be equipped with additional communication and
intelligence capabilities, such as the NETDEV.
This analysis is necessary due to the fact that, despite its
advantageous
aspects,
the
installation
requires
human
resources
for
initial
installation,
integration
and
customization of the NETDEV for all considered production
equipment. Further on, maintenance efforts also would cause
additional costs during the future life-cycle of the equipment.
Potential realization risks may cause unscheduled downtimes
of the machine and would possibly lead to idle periods at
process equipment within the value chain.
As a pre-condition, prior to the implementation, an
analysis of technical features of the production equipment is
indispensable.
Giving
an
example,
connecting
the
equipment,
which
would
have
no
communication
requirements, would also not underlie any flexibility aspects,
such as for exchange of tools or changing process recipes,
and would not consider any deviating manual working
instructions for operators. Applying a NETDEV for this use
case should be questioned. Coming along with the fact that
the
production
equipment
is
an
easily
exchangeable,
multifold redundant and not cost intensive tool, some
analysis would be appropriate to evaluate its economically
viability. Putting it into a nutshell: a ramp-up exists, in
various natures and scopes, for a wide range of production
equipment and components. And every ramp-up time causes
unused capacities and by that potentially negative impact on
life-cycle-costs.
An additional aspect could be its projected life-cycle.
Given that installing a NETDEV with equipment which will
last for several years makes sense, does not automatically
imply that it is profitable to integrate a tool which is
definitely worn after a couple of days. (Using a NETDEV to
prolong this period of time would be an additional argument
for installing.)
Besides
technical
conditions,
additional
framework
requirements could have an impact on the decision to
potentially install a NETDEV. Based on the fact that a
certain knowledge and education is necessary in order to
handle
higher
complexity
could
possibly
hamper
the
installation in individual cases.
These arguments make clear that it is not useful to equip
every production machine with a NETDEV and by that to
provide additional intelligence and communication abilities
to it. Even if arguments would support an installation, it is
important to identify at what level, and respectively which
parts of the equipment should be integrated.
It is worth mentioning that NETDEV implementations,
triggered by equipment suppliers, in detail would underlie
different rules. However, in order to be successful on the
market it is required to satisfy customers’ requirements.
Despite potential disadvantages and risks, by nature, a
range of positive aspects also have an impact on the
definition of the scope of integration of NETDEVs.
Additional intelligence and communication skills provide
a range of advantages. Due to the bulk of known benefits, in
the context of this paper only an extract is be provided.
An expedite integration of the production equipment with
controlling,
Manufacturing-Execution-System
(MES),
sensors and actors, and other peripherals enables a fast
integration when ramping-up, either at initial installation or
after a product exchange or an unscheduled downtime.
An instant access to data and information can be
achieved. Also additional analyzes by applying “Big-Data”,
respectively Data-Mining methodologies can be executed.
Knowledge can be used to identifying existing or potential
problems, and by that may allow identifying potentials for
further optimization on the production system.
All of these advantages, by nature, could be executed
without any intelligent network-enabled system. However,
the
efforts
to
detect,
analyze,
evaluate,
and
provide
suggestions for optimizations could be significantly higher
than with applying a NETDEV or other net-enabled devices
providing similar features.
IV.
CONCLUSION
The remarkable progress in the field of intelligent
production inspired the authors to do research on how new
technologies,
like
the
NETDEV,
could
efficiently
be
transferred
into
industrial
applications.
By
applying
standardized
implementation
processes,
combined
with
existing technical and economic planning methodologies,
ramp-up phases can be shortened [3]. Implementing a more
complex system, like a NETDEV well planned approaches
become even more relevant in order to gain significant
synergies applying NETDEVs.
