Abstract— When a person bends his/her back, it makes it easier 
to exhale the air from lungs but difficult to inhale. In contrast, 
when a person lean his/her back, it makes it difficult to exhale 
but easier to inhale. This simple fact opens the possibility to 
regulate human breathing involuntary with posture control. We 
developed a posture-respiration feedback regulation system and 
tested the efficacy of the proposed architecture. The results 
indicate that “deep breathing” was successfully induced when 
the posture control was precisely synchronized with the user’s 
own respiration.

 INTRODUCTION 
 
Breathing control has numerous benefits on our daily life. 
A voluntary breathing control improves the task performance 
[1], alleviates anxiety [2]-[4], and appropriately controls the 
autonomous nervous system activities such as heart rate and 
blood pressure [5]-[8], and even immune functioning [9]-[11]. 
On the other hand, breathing-related disorders appear to be a 
great danger to our daily life, e.g., obstacle sleep apnea is a 
prominent risk factor of cardiovascular disease [12].  
To obtain the benefits of breathing control, a variety of 
methods have been developed, such as sports, yoga, religious 
meditation, etc. In addition to such voluntary breathing control, 
in a clinical setting, passive ventilation equipment has been 
developed and has proven its great efficacy [13][14].  
However, there are still some limitations in the breathing 
control methods, both voluntary or passively. First of all, 
voluntary breathing control requires much effort and 
concentration so it is difficult to continue over a long period 
of time, especially for the elderly. On the other hand, the 
passive ventilation, such as continuous positive airway 
pressure (CPAP) [13] and adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) 
[14] requires patients to be fitted with a nasal cannula or 
respirator, so it cannot be suitable for daily use at home. 
Therefore, in this study, we propose an alternative method 
for semi-passive breathing control method via posture control. 
The idea is based on the simple fact, as follows: when a person 
bends (rounds) his/her back, it makes it easier to exhale the air 
from the lungs, but more difficult to inhale. In contrast, when 
a person leans his/her back, it makes it difficult to exhale, but 
easier to inhale. This simple fact opens the possibility to 
regulate human breathing involuntary with posture control. 
Then, we developed an architecture which forces to change 
the posture of the user synchronously his/her own breathing 
cycle. 
In the next section, the architecture of the developed 
system, the procedure of the experiment to test the efficacy of 
the system are described. The following sections describe the 
results of the experiment, discussion, and conclusion.

detected by a pressure sensor, the analog signal from the 
sensor is converted to digital format with DAQ, the adaptive 
feedback (described later) is achieved with an interactive 
software (LabVIEW) which controls the inflation/deflation of 
the air-chamber via switching circuits to intervene in the 
posture of the user [15]. The silicon-made air-chamber placed 
beneath the subject’s back deflates/inflates according to 
subjects own respiration cycle. For example, when a subject 
starts 
inhaling/exhaling, 
the 
air-chamber 
starts 
to 
inflate/deflates so as to assist his/her inhalation/exhalation of 
the air into/from the lungs. We assume such an intervention to 
posture would make subject’s breathing deeper and longer, 
and leave them more relaxed in terms of body and mind. 
To test this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment with 
three different respiratory intervention conditions: 1) the air-
chamber inflates/deflates synchronously with subject’s 
inhalation/exhalation (namely, “SNC” hereafter), 2) the air-
chamber asynchronously inflates/deflates with breathing, as 
such it inflates/deflates when subject exhales/inhales (namely, 
“ASN”), and 3) the air-chamber inflates and deflates with a 
certain and constant rhythm (namely, “CST”). In SNC and 
ASN cases, the inflation and deflation cycle of the air- 
chamber is precisely decided with each one of the subject’s 
respiration, whereas, in CST condition, the cycle of the air-
chamber is set to the same duration with each subject’s mean 
deep breathing cycle which was obtained in advance.   
Ten healthy male university students (aged 22-24) 
participated in this study. The experiment consisted of 1 
minute initial rest period, 15 min of intervention period, and 
10 min of another rest period (recovery period).  
Respiration of the subjects were measured by a thermistor 
sensor. Electrocardiogram (ECG) was measured with a 
biological amplifier to evaluate the cardio-physiological 
functioning by the posture-respiration intervention.  
The experiment was conducted such that each participant 
went through all three conditions in a randomized order. 
For statistics, paired-t test was performed with p-value of 
0.05 as the level significance.  
The study was conducted in accordance with ethical 
principles and informed consent was obtained for all subjects. 
The study was approved by the ethics committee of Nagaoka 
University of Technology. It should be noted that the number 
of participants was limited less than 10 and they were required 
to be among the healthy population because this is the very 
first pilot study to examine the physiological effect of our 
proprietary developed feedback architecture.

III. 
RESULT 
Figures 2 and 3 show the change in the interval and the 
amplitude of respiration. As expected, the respiration was 
longer (p < 0.01) and deeper (p < 0.01) in SNC than other two 
conditions. In ASN, subjects’ breathing was remarkably 
restricted. In the meantime, in CST condition, the change in 
respiration was depicted in between SNC and ASN.  
Figures 4 and 5 show the change in the heat rate (HR) and 
the high frequency (HF: 0.15 - 0.40 Hz) component of the 
heart rate variability. As seen in these figures, HR did not 
differ among conditions (p > 0.05) in the intervention period. 
Meanwhile, HR in the recovery period in ASN was 
significantly higher than other conditions (p < 0.01), and it 
reached a higher value than the initial rest period (overshoot). 
HF in SNC was the lowest in the intervention period and 
thereafter (p < 0.01).  
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
In this study, the impact of posture-respiration feedback 
system on respiration and cardiac autonomous system 
function was investigated. As expected, in SNC where the 
inflation/deflation of air-chamber was synchronized (i.e., no 
phase delay), respiration was made longer and deeper. This 
implies that our developed system can induce “deep breathing” 
unconsciously. 
On the other hand, in ASN where the posture regulation 
was administered asynchrony with respiration (i.e., phase 
delay is 180 degree), there was no change in the interval and 
amplitude. Moreover, in the recovery period, a sort of 
overshoot of HR was observed in ASN. HR overshooting is 
frequently observed in the recovery period after mild excise 
[16]. It occurs to meet the requirement to balance the greater 
oxygen cost of fat catabolism during the early recovery period. 
It might be rather speculative but if the HR overshoot seen in 
this study share a part of the same background with that of 
after exercise, it might reflect the lack of oxygen in the 
intervention period as such, despite of the large effort of doing 
respiration, whether it be intentional or unconscious, ASN 
condition made it difficult and worsen the efficiency of 
ventilation, and and this phenomenon mislead the body into 
believing the concentration of air oxygen is “low”, resulting 
in a higher requirement for oxygen after intervention (in 
“normal” circumstance). 
In CST, the impact on respiration and cardiac autonomous 
system were marginal compared to SNC and ASN, and the 
breathing seemed to be gradually entrained with the constant 
rhythm. The cycle of air-chamber movement in CST was 
fixed at the same duration with each subject’s “deep 
breathing”, so subjects might modulate their breathing cycle 
voluntary to their deep breathing. However, the interval and 
amplitude of the respiration in SNC reached far beyond CST. 
In this sense, our developed posture-respiration intervention 
architecture have demonstrated the prominent impact on the 
respiration. 
On the contrary, HF in SNC was strongly suppressed as 
shown in Figure 4. The HF component of the heart rate 
variability has been frequently taken as an index of cardiac 
parasympathetic nervous system activation [17]. However, 
one cannot interpret the result of our study as SNC condition 
suppress parasympathetic nervous activity. Since it is the 
respiration that we intervene, HF component is not just a naïve 
representation of parasympathetic nervous system activity. 
More detailed physiological study is needed to further discuss 
on this phenomena.  
V. 
CONCLUSION 
In summary, we tested the efficacy of our developed 
posture-respiration intervention system in a manner of real-
time feedback regulation. The results indicate that “deep 
breathing” was successfully induced when the posture control 
was precisely synchronized with user’s own respiration.  
Regarding the impact of cardiac function, HR overshoot was 
observed as the after effect of asynchronous regulation. 
Further physiological study promises to reveal the 
underground mechanism of the impact of our system.
