Abstract - Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is major 
method for decision making, and inner dependence AHP is 
used for cases in which criteria or/and alternatives are not 
independent enough. Using the original AHP or inner 
dependence AHP may cause results that cannot have enough 
reliability because of the inconsistency of the comparison 
matrix. In such cases, fuzzy representation for weighting 
criteria or/and alternatives using results from sensitivity 
analysis is useful. In the previous papers, we defined local 
weights of criteria and alternatives and overall weights for 
double inner dependence AHP (among criteria and among 
alternatives, respectively) via fuzzy sets. In this paper, we 
extend these weighs to those of triple inner dependence 
structure AHP (among 2 levels of criteria and among 
alternatives, respectively).  
Keywords -  AHP; fuzzy sets; sensitivity analysis. 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) proposed by 
T.L. Saaty in 1977 [1] is widely used in decision making, 
because it reflects humans feelings naturally. A normal AHP 
assumes independence among criteria and alternatives, 
although it is difficult to choose enough independent 
elements. The inner dependence method AHP [3] is used to 
solve this problem even for criteria or alternatives having 
dependence.  
A comparison matrix may not have enough consistency 
when AHP is used because, for instance, a problem may 
contain too many criteria or alternatives for decision making, 
meaning 
that 
answers 
from 
decision-makers, 
i.e., 
comparison matrix components, do not have enough 
reliability, they are too ambiguous or too fuzzy [3]. To 
avoid this problem, we usually have to revise again or 
abandon the data, but it takes a lot of time and it is 
expensive [1][2]. 
Then, we consider that weights should also have 
ambiguity or fuzziness. Therefore, it is necessary to 
represent these weights using fuzzy sets. Our research first 
applied sensitivity analysis to inner dependence AHP to 
analyze how much the components of a pairwise 
comparison matrix influence the weights and consistency of 
a matrix [4]. This may enable us to show the magnitude of 
fuzziness in weights. We previously proposed new 
representation for criteria and alternatives weights for inner 
dependence, as L-R fuzzy numbers [5]. In the next step, we 
address the double inner dependence structure [7]. Then, we 
consider composition of weights to obtain over all 
alternative weights for double inner dependence structure, 
using results from sensitivity analysis and fuzzy operations. 
At last, we apply these fuzzy weighs to a result of triple 
inner dependence (among 2 levels of criteria and among 
alternatives respectively) when comparison matrices in all 
levels do not have enough consistency.   
In Sections 2 and 3, we introduce the inner dependence 
AHP, consistency index, and sensitivity analyses for AHP. 
Then, in Section 4, we define fuzzy weights, and Section 5 
is a summary. 
 
II.  CONSISTENCY AND INNER DEPENDENCE  
A. 
Process of Normal AHP 
 (Process 1) Representation of structure by a hierarchy. 
The problem under consideration can be represented in a 
hierarchical structure. At the middle levels, there are 
multiple criteria. Alternative elements are put at the lowest 
level of the hierarchy. 
(Process 2) Paired comparison between elements at each 
level. A pairwise comparison matrix A is created from a 
decision maker's answers. Let n be the number of elements 
at a certain level, the upper triangular components of the  
matrix aij (i< j = 1,…,n) are 9, 8, .. , 2, 1, 1/2, …, or 1/9. 
These denote intensities of importance from element i to j. 
The lower triangular components aji are described with 
reciprocal numbers, for diagonal elements, let aii = 1.  
(Process 3) Calculations of weight at each level. The 
weights of the elements, which represent grades of 
importance among each element, are calculated from the 
pairwise 
comparison 
matrix. 
The 
eigenvector 
that 
corresponds to a positive eigenvalue of the matrix is used in 
calculations throughout in the paper. 
(Process 4) Priority of an alternative by a composition of 
weights. With repetition of composition of weights, the 
overall weights of the alternative, which are the priorities of 
the alternatives with respect to the overall objective, are 
finally found. 
B. 
Consistency 
Since components of the comparison matrix are obtained 
by comparisons between two elements, coherent consistency 
is not guaranteed.  In AHP, the consistency of the

comparison matrix A is measured by the following 
consistency index (C.I.)  
where n is the order of comparison matrix A, and λA is its 
maximum eigenvalue (Frobenius root). 
If the value of C.I. becomes smaller, then the degree of 
consistency 
becomes 
higher, 
and 
vice 
versa. 
The 
comparison matrix is consistent if the following holds.

Inner Dependence Structure  
The normal AHP ordinarily assumes independence 
among criteria and alternatives, although it is difficult to 
choose enough independent elements. The dependency 
means some kind of interaction among the elements. Inner 
dependence AHP [2] is used to solve this type of problem 
even for criteria or alternatives having dependence.  
In the method, using a dependency matrix F={ fij }, we 
can calculate modified weights w(n) as follows, 
where w represents weights from independent criteria or 
alternatives, i.e., normal weights of normal AHP and 
dependency matrix F is consist of eigenvectors of influence 
matrices showing dependency among criteria or alternatives.   
If there is dependence in both lower levels, i.e., not only 
among criteria but also among alternatives, we call such 
kind of structure ”double inner dependence”. In the double 
inner dependence structure, we have to calculate modified 
weights of criteria and alternatives,  w(n) and ui
(n). Then we 
composite these 2 modified weights to obtain overall 
weights of alternative k,

where m is the number of criteria. 
Also, using the same steps again, we can composite 
weights of ”triple inner dependence” structure, in the case 
when there is dependency in the 3 lower levels, i.e., not only 
among alternatives and 1 level criteria but also 2 levels of 
criteria. 
III. SENSITIVITY ANALYSES 
When we actually use AHP, it often occurs that a 
comparison matrix is not consistent or that there is not great 
difference among the overall weights of the alternatives. In 
these cases, it is very important to investigate how 
components of the pairwise comparison matrix influence its 
consistency or the weights. In this study, we use a method 
that some of the present authors have proposed before. It 
evaluates a fluctuation of the consistency index and the 
weights when the comparison matrix is perturbed. It is 
useful because it does not change the structure of the data. 
Since the pairwise comparison matrix is a positive 
square matrix, Perron-Frobenius theorem holds. From 
Perron-Frobenius theorem, the following theorem about a 
perturbed comparison matrix holds. 
Theorem 1 Let A = (aij), (i, j = 1,…, n) denote a comparison 
matrix and let A(ε) = A+εDA, DA=(aijdij) denote a matrix 
that has been perturbed. Let λA be the Frobenius root of A, 
w be the eigenvector corresponding toλA, and v be the 
eigenvector corresponding to the Frobenius root of A'. 
Then, a Frobenius root λ ( ε ) of A( ε ) and a 
corresponding eigenvector w( ε ) can be expressed as 
follows

IV.  FUZZY WEIGHTS REPRESENTATIONS 
When a comparison matrix has poor consistency (i.e.,  
0.1<C.I.<0.2), 
comparison 
matrix 
components 
are 
considered to be fuzzy because they are results from human 
fuzzy judgment. Weights should therefore be treated as 
fuzzy numbers [5][6]. 
Definition 1 (fuzzy weight) Let wk
(n) be a crisp weight of 
criterion or alternative k of inner dependence model, and gij | 
hij
(k)| denote the coefficients found in Corollary 1 and 2. If 
0.1<C.I.<0.2, then a fuzzy weight

V.   CONCLUSIONS 
There are many cases in which data of AHP does not 
have enough reliability. We show the possibility to apply 
fuzzy weight representation to triple inner dependence. Our 
approach can show how to represent weights and will be 
efficient to investigate how the result of AHP has fuzziness 
when data is not sufficiently consistent.
