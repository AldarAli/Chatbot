Abstract—This paper presents the studies and investigations on
the dynamics and mechanism of momentary reserves contribu-
tion in electrical power systems under contingency. Momentary
reserve through the machine’s inertia serves the purpose of
primary frequency control and prevents voltage collapse in the
case of reactive power reserves. A simulation was performed on a
realistic Nigerian 330 kV transmission network in PowerFactory
software to study and investigate the mechanism of these reserve
functions on the network buses as an inertia active power control
method. Moreover, we investigated the inﬂuence of geodesic
increment of momentary reserve on the decay of disturbances and
in turn estimated the value of the post contingent frequency at the
network buses. The results indicated that the momentary reserve
by inertia alone reduces the frequency deviation from its nominal
value, delays the transmission of disturbances and enhances the
damping of oscillations by reducing the ﬁnal frequency settling
time at the buses under contingency. These results were further
extrapolated by the numerical experiments carried out on a
synthetic Square 330 kV power network to account for the effects
of meshedness as a distinguishing factor in grid topologies. These
numerical experiments also suggest the optimal placement of
the momentary reserves in the grid in order to improve system
stability against power outage disturbances.
Index Terms—momentary reserves; system perturbation; inertia
control, oscillations damping; grid meshedness.
I. INTRODUCTION
The active and reactive power reserves of synchronous
generators or Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are the
keys to a successful system control in power systems. For
each power generator in the grid, power reserve represents the
total amount of power remaining after the supply of system
loads and losses. The deﬁnition and importance of many power
reserves have been discussed in [1] and would be reiterated
here. This deﬁnition of power reserves does not extend to
exceeding the power capability curve of the generators. These
reserves are particularly referred to as spinning reserves in
synchronous machines more than in other kinds of power
generators, like the wind and solar generators using BESS [2].
These power reserves can be used for both or either primary
frequency control, secondary control and tertiary control [3]
[4] [5]. Again, not all of these remaining power reserves from
generators are assigned for primary control function alone,
we classify the ones momentarily made available through
the generators’ droop functions speciﬁcally for few seconds
primary frequency and active power control as momentary
reserves of the generators. A lot about system stability and
reliability rest on the grid’s momentary reserves.
The control and response of generators to network distur-
bances or contingencies depend heavily on the kind and mag-
nitude of the disturbance and amount of momentary reserves
available for use in the primary frequency control or in voltage
security. Since primary control requires fast control action
to be taken within few seconds of contingency, momentary
reserves and their placement play important roles in the dy-
namics of the disturbance from the point of contingency (PoC)
or fault location to the rest of the electrical power network. In
this paper, we investigate how the dynamics of a disturbance is
inﬂuenced by momentary reserves ﬁrst at the contingent node,
its neighbour nodes and other nodes located far away from the
fault location. We would see whether a disturbance is damped
as it travels across a grid and whether it could be contained
on fewer nodes (i.e., localized) based on the function of the
grid’s momentary reserves. These investigations are carried
out in the DigSILENT PowerFactory software [6], using the
Nigerian 330 kV grid as a case study. In order to account
for a distinctive grid topology characteristic, we would also
consider a synthetic Square 330 kV power network as another
case study because of its high degree of meshedness.
In this paper, we would start with a brief literature review
of reserve functions in Section II. We would then proceed
with the description, modeling and simulation of our test
transmission networks in Section III. In Section IV, we would
investigate the dynamics of momentary reserve on the test
networks with a concise summary of the results in Section V
and conclude with our ﬁndings and recommendation in Section
VI.

II. LITERATURE REVIEW
For many years, synchronous machine reserves have been
the major source of power compensation in complex power
grids prior to the popularity and grid integration of ma-
jor successful storage devices like the BESS and hydrogen
storage. These power compensation reserves, now from both
synchronous machines and other storage sources can be called
on during grid contingencies, especially in power outage
events due to loss of generators or major transmission lines to
ensure sufﬁcient system frequency oscillation damping, control
and stability. These power reserves can be categorized as
momentary, primary, secondary and tertiary based on the grids’
request time, duration and magnitude of need of them as shown
in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Categorization of Power Reserves based on Grid’s Compensation
needs in request time, duration and magnitude. PLFC indicates power reserves
injected at low frequency contingencies.
According to [3] [4] [7], the time, duration and magnitude
factors characterizing the need for grid’s power compensation
are determined by forecast and sudden imbalances between
the power generation, consumption, losses and minutes to
hourly contingencies. While the primary reserves are expected
to be fully activated within 30 seconds of local request time,
the secondary reserves are expected to be automatically and
fully activated between 10 to 15 minutes of request time in
order to restore power balance and to bring the frequency
back to its nominal value. The tertiary reserves account for
additional dispatches possible through market negotiations to
bring the grid to stability in case of prolonged contingencies,
which could not be handled by ﬁnite continuous response of
secondary reserves. While the secondary and tertiary reserves
are controlled and implemented by system operators and where
multiple network authorities may be involved [7] [8], the
momentary reserves, which are constantly available by droop
call function within seconds (i.e., fastest response) followed
by continuous response (i.e., primary reserves) made available
through agreements between the grid operators and power
generating ﬁrms for quarterly compensation or contingency
purposes are our focus in this numerical experiments. Many
authors have carried out extensive research on the effects and
importance of primary, secondary and tertiary control reserves
[9]–[11]. Machowski, Bialek and Bumby in [4] have conﬁrmed
the importance of primary frequency control to the overall
frequency stability of the network, especially for inter-area
modes of oscillation. A new nonlinear droop control function
was studied for wind turbine in [12] where a new dynamic
droop coefﬁcient is connected as the negative feedback of
the original droop control coefﬁcient in order to bring the
product of the original droop control coefﬁcient and nominal
frequency within a controllable range. This was done in real
time according to the target frequency to improve the primary
frequency control. The adaptive droop control action was
simulated to show its frequency control rate but there was
no concrete understanding of the mechanism of this action
on the network bus rather than reducing the frequency dip
at post-contingency. This means that little has been numeri-
cally investigated to practically understand the mechanics and
mechanisms of contribution of momentary control reserves in
the stability of power grids. We predict that these ﬁrst few
seconds of primary control response determines the system’s
need for continuous (i.e., full activation of primary control
reserves) and secondary reserves and is therefore essential
to system recovery from contingencies. As a result, this
paper is directed towards studying the numerical mechanics
of dynamics and effective distribution of control response
function of momentary reserves at a fault event in realistic
model of Nigerian network and a Square grid in order to
account for varying network topologies.
III. MODELING AND SIMULATION OF THE NIGERIAN
TRANSMISSION NETWORK MODEL
To understand our case study system and its parameter
interactions, we would describe the components that make up
the network. The Nigerian 330 kV transmission grid consist
of NS = 71 substations/nodes, NL = 81 over-head transmission
lines (made from an alloy of aluminium and steel) with an
average length of 92 km, each with a limiting current of 1320
A. The grid is comprised of 107 less-decommissioned units
of generators, accounting for the present 29 power stations.
The apparent power capacity of the Nigerian grid is about
13,208MW as of 2020 [13]. There are other lower voltage
networks including the 132 kV and 33 kV sub-transmission
networks. For household utilities, there are 11 kV and 0.415
kV 3-phase distribution networks. The Nigerian network op-
erates at ν0 = 50 Hz frequency and can be described as a grid
where most of the nodes are connected to one another in a
ring form [14], as seen in the diagram shown in Figure 2.
To control the voltage outputs of the generators through
their excitation control, the simpliﬁed excitation Automatic
Voltage Regulator (AVR) model is used [15]. Other controllers

include power system stabilizers (PSS2A-model) tasked with
enhancing the damping of the entire power system’s oscilla-
tions through excitation control.
The input signal to the PSS2A controller is the derivative
of generator’s rotor speed and its output is injected to the
AVR through the excitation system. This injection works
to terminate the phase-lag between the voltage reference
and the windings’ torque of the generator [16]. For the
synchronous machine model, the choice of the model is
inﬂuenced by the IEEE guide in [17]. The speed governor
in the model is the Turbine Governor (TGOV) model used
to maintain the frequency operational limits according to
swing equation [18]. Here, the swing equation describes the
torque balance between the mechanical torque Tt in N.m. of
each synchronous machine’s turbine and the electromagnetic
torque Te in N.m. as governed by the differential equation
given as [3] [4] [11],

i denotes the index of power generators in the grid. Here,
t is time in seconds and ωΘ
i
is the angular velocity of the
rotor in electrical rad/s with ω0 as its rated synchronous
value in electrical rad/s. If we assume that a change in the
rotor’s angular velocity (ωΘ

position δ in electrical radians with respect to its rotating
setpoint, δ0 at t = 0 given as

in DigSILENT PowerFactory software, as documented in [21].
Here, we report results applying these simulations to study
the effect of momentary reserves on system dynamics and its
contribution to the overall system stability.

IV. DYNAMICS OF MOMENTARY RESERVE
For a power system to be in a balanced state, the total power
generated (P) has to be equal to the sum of the total load and
the transmission losses (Px). This means that for the system
to always remain balanced, any change in the load demand
and/ losses would require a balancing change in the generated
power P. Therefore, the condition ∆P >> ∆Px should always
be fulﬁlled to ensure the security and integrity of power grids.
These dynamic changes result in a permanently changing fre-
quency according to the speed-droop characteristics of power
turbines, given by [4]
∆νi
ν0
= −σi
∆Pi
Px
i
,
(10)
where ν0 is the nominal frequency in Hertz and σi is the
local droop of the generation characteristics at the ith generator
node, σi = Px
i /Pi. Thus, any change in frequency resulting
from a change in load demand or losses requests a generator
response. In this way, if the node is a synchronous generator
node, its inertia is expected to slow down the transmission of
disturbances to other nodes connected to it, while attempting
to damp the frequency oscillations with its momentary reserve
according to its droop σi function. However, its ability to
do so depends on the amount of momentary reserve that
the generator can supply, according to its dead zone speed-
droop characteristics setting (i.e., possibility of ∆Pi and in
the absence of no generator overload in the case of sudden
load injection). Since it is not feasible to inject power equally
at every node, we aim to understand the dynamics of these
reserves to see how an available momentary reserve at one
node inﬂuences the frequency dynamics at other nodes as
function of their distance from the fault location. A better
understanding of this inﬂuence in the realistic Nigerian grid
model would be advantageous for its optimal placement and
could improve primary frequency control in real power grids.
To show the inﬂuence of geographical distribution of inertia
with available momentary reserve, we chose the Nigerian
transmission grid as the case study grid. As reported in Section
III, we modelled this network in PowerFactory software and
calculated the load ﬂow of the network. We considered the
voltage dependency of grid loads, and the active power control
according to the grid inertia. The effect of provision of mo-
mentary reserves by system inertia on the frequency stability
of the electrical power networks is studied by varying the
aggregated inertia constant Hagg of the entire grid, as deﬁned
by [22] [23],
Hagg = ∑NS
i=1 HiSi
Sn
,
(11)
where Si and Hi are the rated apparent power and inertia
constant of the ith bus, respectively, Sn = ∑NS
i=1 Si is the total
rated power in the grid. Note that Hi on non-generating
buses are set to zero. The Hagg was varied in the entire grid
by multiplying the Si with a common factor. Note that the
Nigerian transmission network does not comprise tie-line
connections and power transfer [13] [24]. The grid frequency

is operated uniformly at 50 Hz across the entire network.
Here, we choose 11 buses for the investigation. The fault
location bus 24, two buses at the same geodesic distance
(unweighted), r = 2 from fault location with no inertia (i.e.,
buses 8 and 10) and three buses with inertia (i.e., buses 22,
55, and 57). We again choose two buses at the same geodesic
distance (unweighted), r = 7 with no inertia (i.e., buses 7 and
30) and three buses with inertia (i.e., buses 3, 28, and 69). The
reason is that we want to investigate the effect of momentary
reserve both in the vicinity of the reserve (i.e., near to the
fault location) and at far distances from the injection node.
We also want to understand how momentary reserve tentatively
contributes to damping of disturbances as they propagate along
the network. A reference to the network buses numbers are in
[23].
Keeping all system parameters, generations, losses and loads
constant under undisturbed operations, a synchronous machine
outage event (disturbance/contingency) is induced at bus 24 at
exactly t = 5s of the 90s transient electromechanical stability
simulation time frame with a 200ms switching, enabling the
observations on the buses in PowerFactory power simulation
software. The change in frequency propagated across the grid
is related to the change of power in (10). The Figure 3
shows the frequency dynamics at a network bus. Here, the
red line marks the frequency magnitude at ﬁnal settling time.
The black arrows point to the local maxima or minima of
the frequency magnitude and arrival times. From this nodal
points described in Figure 3, we observe at each study case
node, the frequency’s time of arrival (ToA), deﬁned as the
time the frequency deviation ﬁrst reaches a small threshhold
of δν = ±0.002 Hz, as deﬁned in more detail in [23]. Fur-
thermore we record the time of the ﬁrst maximum (maximat)
of the transient and its magnitude (maximamag), the time of
the ﬁrst minimum (minimat) and its magnitude (minimamag).
We also observe the ﬁnal frequency’s settling time (FSt), its
magnitude (FSmag) and frequency deviation (Devmag) from the
nominal 50Hz value, for each of these nodes. For case studies
I-V in Tables I-V, we show the observations in milliseconds
for the case study nodes, with static network power ﬂow of
the Nigerian transmission grid.

PoC
Figure 4: The Square 330 kV Power Grid. The Red pointer is the Point of Contingency (PoC, i.e., fault location) [23].
In Table I and with network Hagg at 2s, a typical behaviour
of high renewable energy source injected grids, we observe a
high frequency deviation (i.e., 0.171 Hz) induced by the large
disturbance (of 1320MW power magnitude outage) at bus 24
fault location. We also observe that the disturbance arrived at
the fault location ﬁrst and at the same time as most of its
nearest neighbours at r = 2, but arrived a little later at the
distant buses 7, 30, 28 and 69. The frequency dip described
by the minimamag shows the lowest magnitude of frequency
deviation before the actions of turbines’ governors.
At Hagg = 2s and in comparison with Table I, Table II
shows the observations when the fault location is injected
with inertia and large reserve. We observe that there are
delays in the frequency ToA at the buses, a reduction in
minimat, which corresponds to increased frequency dips
(i.e., minimamag), shorter ﬁnal frequency settling times with
smaller magnitudes and hence, a decrease in the frequency
deviation from the nominal value (0.033 Hz).
In Table III, we kept the network parameters constant and
only increased the grid inertia, Hagg = 6s using (11) without
changing the active power injections at any network node.
We did not observe any further decrement in the frequency
deviation or any increment in the frequency ﬁnal settling
magnitude, rather we observe a delay in its time of arrival
at the buses with a corresponding increase in its dip and
ﬁnal settling time. This suggests that increasing the Hagg
without a corresponding increase in the reserve does not
improve the frequency dynamics during contingencies, rather it
increases the arrival time of the disturbance while reducing the
frequency dip across the network (i.e., improved minimamag).
This further delay in ToA also increases the frequency ﬁnal
settling time.
Table IV shows our nodal observations on the case
study buses when we injected more power reserve prior to
contingency at another bus with r = 2, from the fault location
and keeping all other system operation parameters constant
from observations in Table II. Here, the generator’s power
and reserve at the fault location are higher in magnitude than
the injected ones. We observe that the frequency ﬁnal settling
magnitude did not increase, the ToA at the buses remained
the same but there is an observable reduction in the frequency
dip at some nodes.
To investigate the effect of the same reserve at a bus
geometrically farther away from the fault location but with a
higher degree of connectivity, which deﬁnes the number of
edges connected to it, we removed the reserve at bus 22 with a
node degree of 2 and installed it at another bus with r = 7 but
with a node degree of 5 and keeping all other system operation
parameters constant from our observations in Table II. The
result of this new installation in Table V compared with Table
IV shows no observable change in the frequency ToA at the
buses and in the frequency ﬁnal settling magnitude. Rather,
we observe a delay in frequency dip time (i.e., minimat) with
a further delay in the ﬁnal frequency settling time at the buses.
To further understand and verify if the above ﬁndings on the
inﬂuence of momentary reserves would be general in different
power network topological settings with special emphasis on

network’s degree of meshedness, which is calculated by the
coefﬁcient of meshedness given as [25],
φM = NE −NB +1
2NB −5
,
(12)
where NE and NB are respectively the total number of
transmission edges/lines and buses, we transformed the
Nigerian 330 kV transmission network (N) into a Square
power grid (i.e., S or S-grid) as shown in Figure 4. Note: φM
has a maximum value of 1 for a completely meshed power
grid. The φM for Nigerian 330 kV grid is 0.11 while that of
Square power grid is calculated to be 0.40. See Ref: [23] for
the details of the transformation.
In the Square grid shown in Figure 4, we choose for the
purpose of veriﬁcation, the point of contingency (i.e., bus 29),
buses 13 and 20 with no inertia and bus 31 with inertia, all at
the same geodesic distance of r= 2 from fault location. Also,
at a geodesic distance of r= 5 from fault location, we choose
buses 42 and 48 with no inertia and bus 55 with inertia. We
choose r= 5 in the Square power grid because of the inertia
criterion of selection and the limited number of buses with
r= 7 from the fault location. Keeping all system parameters
constant and inducing a synchronous machine event at bus
29 exactly at t =5s in a 90s transient electromechanical
simulation time frame, we measure the change in frequency
transmitted across the grid by this disturbance by placing a
small threshold at δν = ±0.002 Hz exactly as in the case of
the Nigerian transmission network studies. Again, we show
the dynamic observations in milliseconds for the case study
nodes, with static Square network power ﬂow, recording the
ToA, minimat, maximat, (FSt), FSmag and Devmag. For case
studies in Tables VI-X similar to the ones studied in Tables
I-V.
In Table VI and with Hagg at 2s in comparison with Table I,
we again observe a high frequency deviation (i.e., 0.187 Hz)
effected by the same large disturbance magnitude but induced
at bus 29 point of contingency (PoC). Here, we observe the
disturbance arrived at the PoC ﬁrst but the arrival at the
neighbouring buses with r= 2 are exponentially delayed. As
geodesic distance, r is increasing from the PoC, the frequency
dip described by the minimat is reducing while the minimamag
of the buses are increasing as expected.
At Hagg = 2s and in comparison with Table VI, Table
VII shows the observations when the PoC is injected with
inertia and a large reserve. We observe that the delays in the
frequency ToA at the buses improved. There are reductions in
the minimat with correspondingly improved frequency dips
(i.e., minimamag) similar to Table II and with reductions in
the ﬁnal frequency settling time (FSt) and magnitude (FSmag).
These lead to a decrease in the frequency deviation, Devmag
value (0.035 Hz) from the nominal.
In Table VIII, we increased only the grid inertia, Hagg = 6s
by using (11) without changing the active power injections
at any network bus and keeping all other network parameter
constant as in Table VII. Again, we did not observe any
change in the frequency deviation or any increment in the
frequency ﬁnal settling magnitude, rather we observe a
delay in the frequency’s ToA at the buses increasing with
geodesic distance (r) and with a corresponding increase in
the frequency dip (minimat) and ﬁnal settling times. This
again suggests that increasing the Hagg alone without a
corresponding increase in the reserve provides a delay in
propagation of disturbances while reducing the frequency
dip across the network (i.e., improved minimamag). However,
it does not improve the Devmag during contingencies. This
further delay in ToA resulting from increasing the Hagg also
increases the frequency ﬁnal settling times, similar to our
observations in Table III above.
Table IX shows our nodal observations on the Square grid
case study buses when we injected more power reserve prior
to contingency at bus 31 with r = 2 from the PoC and
keeping all other system operation parameters constant from
the observations in Table VII. Here, the power capacity of the
generator and reserve at the PoC are higher in magnitude than
the injected one.

We observe that the ﬁnal frequency settling magnitude
increased by 1 mHz, the ToAs at the buses relatively increased
but there is an observable delay in the minimat with improve-
ments in the magnitude of the frequency dips as the geodesic
distance increases.
Furthermore, to investigate the effect of the same reserve at
a bus geometrically farther with r= 5 from the PoC but with
the same degree of connectivity, we keep all other system
operation parameters constant from our observations in Table
VII. The result of this new reserve placement in Table X
compared with Table IX shows little observable changes only
in the frequency ToAs at buses 31 and 55, which happens to
be the locations of inertia. We also observe no change in the
ﬁnal frequency settling magnitude. Also, we observe that the
ﬁnal frequency settling time at the buses improved but with
no observable change in its magnitude (i.e., FSmag) similar to
our observations in the case study 5 in Table V.
From the above numerical experiments, we can note that
the frequency ToA at any network bus is a function of system
parameters, in particular inertia while the frequency dip time
(i.e., Minimat) and its ﬁnal settling magnitude are respectively
functions of turbine’s governor time constant and reserves. we
can then estimate the deviation in frequency and the resul-
tant frequency magnitude from the mechanics of momentary
reserve dynamics if we consider important times of arrival
at various points on any network bus after contingency. If a
bus with inertia and momentary reserve undergoes contingency
speciﬁcally of power outage event type and in a low Hagg (i.e.,
high renewable energy source penetration), we can estimate
the ﬁnal frequency settling time (FSt) at the network buses to
be,
FSt = (ToAMt)−ToA +φM,

where ToA is the frequency time of arrival (ToA), φM is the
grid’s coefﬁcient of meshedness as deﬁned in Section IV and
Mt is an abbreviation of Minimat, which is a function of speed-
droop characteristics of turbine governor deﬁned in (10). The
value of FSt in (13) is true provided that Hagg is low. With
more momentary reserve distribution at contingent neighbour-
ing buses in the low inertia grid, FSt can be estimated and
given as,
FSt = (ToAMt)+ToA +φM.
(14)
However, if a network has a high Hagg (e.g. Hagg = 6s) with
no corresponding increment in the magnitude of momentary
reserves, we can estimate FSt at the network buses to be,
FSt = (ToAMt)−ToA −Mt −φM.
(15)
Irrespective of the conditions for the value of FSt in (13) - (15),
the resultant ﬁnal frequency settling magnitude (with unit in

Hertz) as a result of 1/FSt deviation can now be estimated as,
FSmag = ν1 − 1
FSt

(16)
where ν1 and FSmag are the pre-contingent and post-contingent
network bus frequencies, respectively. The value of ν1 at
normal operation is ν0 (i.e., 50 or 60 Hz).
V. RESULTS SUMMARY
To properly summarize the characteristics of the case study
grids, we combine the 5 study cases in spider graphs to en-
hance the visualizations, differences and similarities between
these grids with different topologies and degree of meshedness
(φM). We reiterate that an increase in the nodal momentary
reserve generally delays the travel and arrival of disturbances
in a power grid at contingencies as shown in Figures 5 and
7. These observations are found to be similar to the ones
in Figures 6 and 8, respectively. In particular, momentary
reserves improve the frequency magnitudes at the local minima
points and reduces the ﬁnal frequency settling time in Nigerian
network as shown in Figures 7 and 9. These ﬁndings are also
valid for the Square grid as respectively shown in Figures 8
and 10 but in addition, we observe that its ﬁnal frequency
arrival times are more clustered. This is maybe due to its high
degree of meshedness.
Moreover, we found out that the optimal placement of mo-
mentary reserve is at the point of contingency as it contributes
more in the damping of disturbance across the network more
than at any other place as visualized in Figures 11 and 12.
Since we may not always be able to predict a fault location,
the optimal solution would be to place momentary reserve
at all buses where resources and costs allow. In this way, the
power system could quickly recover most contingencies within
few seconds after their occurrences. Again, we observed that
injecting momentary reserve at a bus with high connectivity
does not improve the frequency dip time (i.e., minimat) and
ﬁnal settling time at the buses if the bus is geometrically
farther away from the fault location. Hence, the farther away
the reserve is from the fault location, the more time it would
take for the frequency to stabilize at the buses.
Also, we conclude that increasing the grid inertia without a
corresponding increase in the magnitude of the reserve could
only delay the travel and arrival of disturbances in electrical
network but does not reduce the frequency deviation from
the nominal value as seen in case study 3, irrespective of
the grid’s φM. Moreover, we established an estimation for
the ﬁnal frequency settling time and magnitude at network
buses after contingency, especially of power outage event type.
These results would be important to the Transmission System
Operators (TSOs) when injecting virtual inertia in the energy
transition to renewable schemes.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have studied the dynamics of power system
reserves in a realistic model of Nigerian power grid as well
as synthetic Square power network. By realistic numerical
experiments, we explored the mechanisms of momentary re-
serve contributions to the damping of system oscillations at
contingencies and thereby work to restore the grid frequency
to its nominal value. We have shown that the optimal place-
ment of momentary reserve in a highly penetrated renewable
energy source grid would be at the fault location (i.e., PoC),
particularly in the case of generator outage events at plant
stations irrespective of the network’s degree of meshedness.
Since this situation could not always be predicted, we suggest
placement of reserves at all nodes where resources permit as
this would improve the overall ﬁnal frequency settling time,
frequency dip, and reduce overall frequency deviation from
the nominal value, thereby contributing to primary frequency
control and reducing the amount of secondary control power
needed.
