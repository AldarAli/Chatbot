Abstract— In order to simplify the gaze calibration required for 
gaze measurement in Virtual Reality Head-Mounted Displays 
(VR-HMDs), we proposed a new gaze calibration method that 
combines eye-frontalization and single-point calibration. Deep 
Convolutional Neural Network was used for the frontalization 
of the eyes. Our method enables to estimate the gaze coordinates 
on the screen as soon as the user puts on the VR-HMD and to 
improve the accuracy of gaze measurement due to slight 
changes in the positional relationship between the VR-HMD 
and the face by updating the parameters of the gaze calibration. 
The accuracy of the proposed method was about 5 degrees for 
both eyes.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Gaze information is essential in research and technology 
using visual processing. This information provides insight 
into the characteristics of the object of interest, gazing order, 
and eye movements. Although we can control the gaze 
position arbitrarily, eye movements associated with changes 
in the gaze position are involuntary [1]. Therefore, eye 
movements are used as response indices to stimuli presented 
on a screen [2]. In the medical field, these indices are used to 
determine visual acuity for visual field testing [3] and as input 
interfaces for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients 
[4]. The information of eye movements also has been applied 
to rendering processing [5] and industrial robot control [6].  
Recently, there are Virtual Reality Head-Mounted 
Displays (VR-HMDs) equipped with eye trackers, such as 
HTC Vive Pro and Fove, which enable eye tracking in Virtual 
Reality  (VR). These devices have a wider viewing angle of 
the stimulus and provide more stable eye tracking than non-
contact eye trackers. However, if the position of the VR-
HMD during the initial gaze calibration and the subsequent 
position of the VR-HMD relative to the face change, the 
accuracy of the gaze measurement will be degraded. This 
problem is caused by its inability to compensate for the gaze 
point using the corneal reflection, as in non-contact eye 
trackers. Figure 1 shows the eye tracker mechanism in the 
VR-HMD and the corneal reflection image indicating that the 
corneal reflection image cannot be captured correctly when 
gazing at a wide viewing angle.   
In this study, we propose a new gaze calibration method 
that can compensate the accuracy of gaze measurement for 
changes in the position of the VR-HMD relative to the face. 
The proposed method consists of eye-frontalization and 
single-point calibration. The former involves inferring the 
image of an eye gazing in the frontal direction from the image 
of an eye gazing in an arbitrary direction. This method was 
inspired by the study of gaze redirection [7]. The latter is a 
higher-order polynomial that connects the gaze direction of 
the frontal gaze to the direction of the surroundings. This 
polynomial allows to estimate the gaze point when gazing at 
the screen (Point of Regard; PoR) without gaze calibration if 
the image of the eye while looking at the center of the screen 
can be obtained [8]. 
Our proposed method will have the following advantages. 
First, since the single-point calibration can be performed 
automatically by frontalizing the eyes, the PoR can be 
obtained instantly after the user wears the VR-HMD. 
Secondly, the gaze accuracy will not be degraded even if the

positional relationship between the VR-HMD and the face 
changes, thus enabling gaze measurement in long-term. 
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we 
describe related work on the frontalization process of eye 
images. In Section III, we describe the frontalization process 
and how to obtain the gaze position. In Section IV, we present 
the validation methods and results on reconstruction error and 
gaze accuracy. Finally, the results of this research and future 
perspectives are presented. 
II. RELATED WORK 
Gaze redirection is a method of modifying the gaze in any 
direction for a given eye image. This method is an emerging 
research topic in computer vision and computer graphics, 
especially in applications such as the generation of eye 
contact in video conferencing to improve communication.  
The initial work on gaze redirection was conducted by 
Wolf et al. [7]. Their method detects the position of an eye 
and replaces it with the image of the most similar eye in the 
dataset, looking straight at the camera. A simple deformable 
eye model was used to adjust the size and orientation of the 
eye area. The limitations of this method are that the results 
depend on the accuracy of the eye region detection and the 
inability to handle large head movements. Wood et al. [9] 
proposed a 3D model of a large eye region covering the 
eyelids and lower eye area to achieve a more natural eye 
resemblance. The fitting of the 3D model to the eye region 
was done by minimizing the energy in the similarity of both 
images and landmarks of the model and the target eye. The 
disadvantages of this method are the high computational cost 
that makes it impractical to run in real-time. Instead of using 
a large 3D model, Isikdogan et al. [10] used the Eye 
Correction Model Network (ECC-NET) to guide the gaze 
from the eye region cropped by the facial landmark detector 
and applied the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to 
the U-Net based network to generate natural-synthetic eye 
images. Moreover, in order to stabilize the output image, 
temporal filtering was performed before generating the final 
output. 
III. 
PROPOSED GAZE CALIBRATION METHOD 
The proposed gaze calibration method consists of three 
processes: eye-frontalization, pupil center localization, and 
PoR calculation. 
A. Eye frontalization  
We build a convolutional neural network (CNN) that 
performs eye-frontalization by referring to ECC-Net, which 
is based on U-Net. This network uses a Pre-Activation 
Module (PAM) [11], which makes it easier to inherit local 
features. This not only lowers the computational cost but also 
allows for a better output of eye images. Figure 2 shows the 
CNN build for this study. The input eye image is set to 
128x128 pixels. L1Loss (absolute error) is used for the loss 
function of the network, as in previous studies. 
B. Getting the pupil center coordinates 
Blob searching is commonly used to localize the pupil 
center coordinates from an eye image. By approximating the 
shape of the blob with ellipse, the center of the resulting 
ellipse is treated as the center of the pupil. The brightness of 
the pupil region, however, is not constant due to eyelashes, 
eyelid shadows, and Purkinje images. Hotta et al. [8] used 
Semantic Segmentation (SS) to generate a blob image from 
an eye image, and then used the Starburst algorithm to find 
the center of the blob [12]. This method provides a stable

result of the center of the pupil. In this study, we adopted the 
method of Hotta et al. [8] to determine the coordinates of the 
pupil center.  
C. PoR calculation 
In this study, the PoR is obtained by applying single-point 
calibration [8] to the coordinates of the pupil center. The 
relationship between the pupil center coordinates (𝑥, 𝑦) after 
the eye-frontalization and the screen coordinates (𝑢, 𝑣) is 
computed using the following pre-determined n-order 
polynomial obtained by the single-point calibration 
experiment.

(1) 
The coefficients 𝑎𝑗,(𝑗−𝑘) and 𝑏𝑗,(𝑗−𝑘) are obtained by the least-
squares method. Finally, the current gazing point (𝑢′, 𝑣′) on 
the screen (PoR) is calculated by  
[𝑢

Here,  (𝑡𝑥, 𝑡𝑦) represents the horizontal and vertical 
difference between (𝑢, 𝑣) and the screen center coordinate.

EXPERIMENT AND RESULT 
36 subjects participated in this experiment. All of the 
subjects had no visual acuity problems. The experimental 
setting, data collection, and accuracies of the eye-
frontalization and PoR are described as follows. 
A. Environmental setting 
Table I shows the specifications of VR-HMD and the 
desktop PC used in the experiment. The software application 
programs for frontalizing the eye and displaying the stimuli 
during 
the 
experiment 
were 
implemented 
using 
openFrameworks (C/C++). 
B. Data collection and training the CNN  
To train the CNN for the frontalization process, we 
collected images of eyes gazing at the center screen and other 
locations on the screen. We collected images of all subjects' 
eyes gazing at 25 visual targets on the screen, as shown in 
Figure 3. Each subject was requested to fixate on 25 targets 
three to four times, resulting 4,000 eye images. These images 
were used for training. Figure 4 shows the input eye image, 
the resulting frontalized image, and the image of the eye 
gazing at the center screen. 
C. Eye-frontalization accuracy 
The accuracy of the frontalized eye image is not 
determined by the difference in its appearance relative to the 
image of the eye gazing at the center screen. Instead, both 
pupil centers are extracted, and the difference in their 
distances (deviations) is calculated as a measure of eye-
frontalization accuracy. Figure 5 shows the distribution of 
horizontal and vertical deviations for the frontalized left and 
right eyes. The mean deviation for this experiment was 1.67 
± 0.98 pixels and 1.74 ± 1.04 pixels for the left and right eyes, 
respectively. 
D. Accuracy of PoR 
We calculated the PoRs using equation (2) from the 
images of the eyes when gazing at 24 targets, excluding the 
center of the screen. The accuracy of PoRs is calculated by 
𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦 = 1
𝑁 ∑ √(𝑇𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡𝑥𝑖 − 𝑃𝑜𝑅𝑥𝑖,𝑗)
2
+ (𝑇𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡𝑦𝑖 − 𝑃𝑜𝑅𝑦𝑖,𝑗)
2
𝑁
𝑖=1
 
(3) 
Here, 𝑇𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡𝑥𝑖and 𝑇𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡𝑦𝑖 are the abscissa and the ordinate of 
the i-th target, respectively. Likewise, 𝑃𝑜𝑅𝑥𝑖,𝑗 and 𝑃𝑜𝑅𝑦𝑖,𝑗 are 
the abscissa and the ordinate of the i-th PoR, respectively. N 
is the total number of PoRs. 
The accuracy of PoR was 5.07±3.30° and 5.50±3.25° for 
the left and right eyes, respectively. Figure 6 shows the 
distribution of PoRs for all subjects. As the accuracy of the 
typical eye Tracker is approximately 1°, we can say that the 
accuracy of the proposed method is insufficient. However, it 
is acceptable for the first attempt of automatic gaze 
calibration. 
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this study, we have proposed a new gaze calibration 
method that combines eye-frontalization and single-point

calibration. Since the accuracy of a typical eye tracker is about 
1°, the accuracy of the proposed method can be considered 
low, but it is within the acceptable range for the first attempt 
of automatic gaze calibration. The proposed gaze calibration 
method can be used to compensate for the accuracy of gaze 
measurement even when the position of the VR-HMD relative 
to the face changes. 
In the future, we will continue to improve the calibration 
method to make the eye tracking system for head-mounted 
displays easier to use and more accurate.
