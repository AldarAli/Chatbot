Abstract— Online review comments have become a popular 
and efficient way for sellers to acquire feedback from 
customers and improve their service quality. These online 
reviews in the e-tourism era, in the format of both textual 
reviews (comments) and ratings, generate an electronic Word 
Of Mouth (eWOM) effect, which influences future customer 
demand and hotels’ financial performance and thus have 
significant business value. This paper proposes an approach 
for hotel quality evaluation according to online review 
comments and ratings using Fuzzy Pattern Matching (FPM) 
for mining customers’ opinions and Fuzzy Cognitive Maps 
(FCM) for evaluating the attributes that contribute to the 
review rating. The proposed approach was applied to a 4-star 
hotels dataset in Athens, Greece and experiments were 
performed.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Online comments have become a popular and efficient 
way for sellers to acquire feedback from customers and 
improve their service quality [1]. According to a survey, with 
the increased popularity of online bookings, 53% of 
travellers state that they would be unwilling to book a hotel 
that had no reviews, while a 10% increase in travel review 
ratings would increase bookings by more than 5% [2]. 
Customer online reviews of hotels have significant business 
value in the e-commerce and big data era, while they affect 
room occupancy [3], revenue, prices [4] and market share 
[5]. These online reviews in the e-tourism era, in the format 
of both textual reviews (comments) and ratings, generate an 
electronic Word Of Mouth (eWOM) effect, which influences 
future customer demand and hotels’ financial performance 
[6]. 
Hotel owners want to know the details about hotel 
guests’ experiences, to improve the corresponding product 
and service attributes, and customers’ overall evaluation of 
the hotel stay experience, to obtain a snapshot of the hotel’s 
operational performance and overall customer satisfaction 
[7][8]. Although the direct measurement of customer ratings 
in terms of closed-ended survey questions can show overall 
customer satisfaction in a direct way [7][8], they suffer from 
confounding the data of customers’ true evaluation because 
of variations in survey design from different approaches [9].  
Recently, many studies have focused on textual reviews 
[8][10]. In contrast to a pre-designed questionnaire survey, 
online textual reviews have an open-structured form and can 
show customer consumption experiences, highlight the 
product and service attributes customers care about, and 
provide customers’ perceptions in a detailed way through the 
open-structure form [8]. The provided information is free 
from obvious bias and is helpful in understanding and 
assessing hotel performance [11]. In addition, such 
information is inexpensive and efficient to collect [12]. 
However, the exploitation of online textual reviews is still 
largely under-explored [8], while there is a lack of advanced 
data analytics approaches and algorithms for modeling 
complex dynamics of online hotel review data. 
Hotel quality evaluation from online reviews is an 
emerging research field; however, the vast majority of 
existing research works have been performed from a tourism 
management perspective. Therefore, the applied methods 
and algorithms are limited to descriptive statistics, e.g., using 
well-established regression models. However, the increasing 
amount of online reviews as the core means for customers to 
express their level of satisfaction about a hotel pose 
significant challenges to the data analytics and computer 
science community for the development of advanced data 
analytics models aiming at providing a higher level of 
intelligence and thus, increased business value. 
In this paper, we propose an approach for hotel quality 
evaluation from online reviews using Fuzzy Pattern 
Matching (FPM) and Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM). The 
objective is to provide a unified algorithm, which both: (i) 
mines customers’ opinions from online hotel reviews (review 
comments and rating); and, (ii) evaluates the hotel 
performance by identifying how the various attributes (e.g., 
location, cleanliness, breakfast, etc.) affect the overall review 
rating. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 
II presents the related work on methods and approaches for 
hotel evaluation based on online review comments. Section 
III describes the research methodology and the proposed 
approach for hotel quality evaluation from online reviews 
using FPM and FCM. Section IV presents the results from 
the adoption of the proposed methodology on a dataset of six

4-star hotels in Athens. Section V concludes the paper and 
outlines our plans for future work. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
The business value of online consumer reviews has 
emerged in recent year in the hotel industry aiming at solving 
the problems confronted by the traditional hotel service 
quality assessment methods [13]. For example, in [14], the 
authors performed hierarchical multiple regressions in order 
to examine the effects of traditional customer satisfaction 
relative magnitude and social media review ratings on hotel 
performance and found that social media review rating is a 
more significant predictor. In the traditional hotel quality 
assessment, domain experts or customers are asked to fill in 
a questionnaire and score each evaluation index to be used in 
a service quality assessment model [15]-[17].  On the 
contrary, online comments are made by a large amount of 
customers with actual user experience shortly after the 
consumption is completed. In addition, the increasing 
amount of reviews-related data pave the way for the use of 
advanced data analytics and machine learning algorithms 
that outperform traditional statistical methods based on 
sampling [2]. 
Technical attributes of online textual reviews can explain 
significant variations in customer ratings and can have a 
significant effect on customer ratings [18][19]. In this 
direction, in [8], the authors developed an approach for 
predicting overall customer satisfaction using the technical 
attributes of online textual reviews and customers’ 
involvement in the review community. They calculated 
subjectivity and polarity measurements by using naïve Bayes 
classifier and sentiment analysis. The research work in [10] 
investigated the underpinnings of satisfied and unsatisfied 
hotel customers by applying text mining techniques on 
online reviews.  
The literature is rich of methodologies based on 
descriptive statistics aiming at providing insights on hotel 
quality performance for various datasets. In [20], the authors 
applied statistical methods in order to assess how several 
characteristics, such as timeliness of the response, length of 
the response, number of responses, etc., contributes to the 
hotel’s financial performance. The research work in [21] 
compared the rating dynamics of the same hotels in two 
online review platforms, which mainly differ in requiring or 
not requiring proof of prior reservation before posting a 
review (respectively, a verified vs a non-verified platform). 
In [22], the authors examined the effect of factors of online 
consumer review, including quality, quantity, consistency, 
on the offline hotel occupancy (i.e., how popular the hotel is 
among consumers). 
In [3], the extent to which digital marketing strategies 
influence hotel room occupancy and revenue per available 
room and how this mechanism is different for different types 
of hotels in terms of star rating and independent versus chain 
hotels was investigated. In [23], the authors examined the 
determinants of customer satisfaction in hospitality venues 
through an analysis of online reviews using text mining and 
content analysis. The research work in [24] investigated the 
impacts of online review and source features (usefulness, 
reviewer expertise, timeliness, volume, valence and 
comprehensiveness) upon travelers’ online hotel booking 
intentions by applying factor analysis and regression 
analysis. In [11], the authors compared customer satisfaction 
by classifying several attributes influencing customer 
satisfaction in: satisfiers, dissatisfiers, bidirectional forces, 
and neutrals. Reference [25] applied qualitative research 
methods and extracted six main factors influencing the 
positive or negative emotions of the comments of travelers 
staying in the hotel.  
Reference [26] conducted a multilevel analysis of factors 
affecting customer satisfaction, such as service encounter, 
visitor, visitor’s nationality, hotel, and destination. In [27], 
the authors applied a multi-group analysis and an 
importance-performance map analysis by means of PLS-
SEM in order to differentiate between service quality 
performance scores and their influences on customer 
satisfaction across accommodation with a different star 
grading. Reference [28] assessed social media content 
produced by customers and related review-management 
strategies of domestic and international hotel chains with the 
use of multilevel regression.  
As mentioned earlier, the increasing amounts of reviews-
related data require advanced data analytics and machine 
learning methods for exploiting the full potential. To this 
end, the research work in [2] assessed whether terms related 
to guest experience can be used to identify ways to enhance 
hospitality services. They developed a model based on naïve 
Bayes classifier in order process vast amount of data and to 
classify reviews of hotels. Reference [29] developed a 
framework in order to integrate visual analytics and (deep) 
machine learning techniques, such as clustering for text 
classification and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to 
investigate whether hotel managers respond to positive and 
negative reviews differently and how to use a deep learning 
approach to prioritize responses. Reference [1] combined 
fuzzy comprehensive evaluation and fuzzy cognitive maps 
aiming at identifying the causal relations among evaluation 
indexes from online comments. Based on this, their proposed 
approach recommends more economical solutions for 
improving the service quality by automatically getting more 
trustworthy evaluation from a large amount of less 
trustworthy online comments. 
III. 
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
Our research methodology consists of three main steps: 
(i) Extracting the evaluation criteria from online comments; 
(ii) Mining customers’ opinions using FPM; and, (iii) 
Applying FCM for attributes evaluation. These steps are 
described in detail in the following sub-sections. 
A. Extracting the Evaluation Criteria from Online 
Comments 
The proposed approach utilizes three fields from the 
online hotel reviews: (i) review title; (ii) review comments; 
and, (iii) review rating. This step of the methodology 
processes the review title and the review comments in order 
to extract the evaluation criteria from the online comments.

More specifically, based upon an evaluation index for hotel 
service quality [1], this step identifies the criteria mentioned 
in the hotel reviews under examination, e.g., location, price, 
breakfast, room space, etc. In this way, the criteria are 
defined dynamically out of the pre-defined list, according to 
the dataset of the available online comments. The extracted 
evaluation criteria of the previous step play the role of a 
questionnaire and the online review comments can be 
considered as the answers to the questionnaire made by 
customers, so that they can be further processed with the use 
of Fuzzy Pattern Match Template (FPMT), as we describe in 
Section III.B. Moreover, along with the review rating, they 
constitute the concepts of the FCM, as we describe in 
Section III.C. 
B. Mining Customers’ Opinions Using Fuzzy Pattern 
Matching 
Since online comments are written in natural and 
informal language, there is the need to mine customers’ 
opinions so that they subsequently feed into the FCM for 
further processing. FPM, alternatively mentioned as fuzzy 
string searching or approximate string matching, has been 
developed in the framework of fuzzy set and possibility 
theory in order to take into account the imprecision and the 
uncertainty pervading values, which have to be compared in 
a matching process [30]. This technique has proved effective 
for implementing patterns of approximate reasoning in 
expert system inference engines, and for designing retrieval 
systems capable of managing incomplete and fuzzy 
information data bases and vague queries.  
In online review comments, different customers may use 
different words or phrases to express their opinions, while 
the comments may be vague. For example, poor cleanliness 
can be expressed as: “The room was too dirty”, “Very dirty”, 
etc. Regular expression is an efficient pattern match [31] 
technology to identify the specific pattern strings from a long 
text. 
A simple 
example 
of regular expression is 
“[\s\S]∗?[room|bathroom][\s\S]∗?dirty[\s\S]∗?” 
that 
can 
match “The room was too dirty.” However, the regular 
expression method causes a binary value result: match or not 
match. 
In the proposed approach, we apply FPMT [1] as an 
effective fuzzy pattern matching method to deal with the 
vagueness of the free text online comments. FPMT is a set of 
pattern strings with membership degrees, denoted as:  
FPMT = {(p1, w1), (p2, w2), …, (pi, wi), …, (pn, wn)} 
where pi is a pattern string described by regular expression, 
and wi is the membership degree that a string falls into the 
object FPMT when the string matches pi. When a string 
matches multiple pattern strings at the same time, the max 
membership degree of these pattern strings will be selected 
as the final membership degree. Although this method results 
in some mismatched cases due to the limitation of pattern 
strings, this causes little impact on the final result, because 
there are many redundant comments with similar semantics. 
The output of customers’ opinions mining is a fuzzy 
evaluation of the extracted criteria. Specifically, first, the 
extracted evaluation criteria of hotel quality are assigned to a 
five-level Likert scale (1 – Very Low, 2 – Low, 3- Neutral, 4 
– High, 5 – Very High), which serve as an equivalent to 
responses of a Likert scale questionnaire. Then, following 
the approach proposed by [32], this step considers the 
median of the resulting responses in order to represent the 
magnitude of causality among the evaluation criteria to be 
used as FCM concepts in Section III.C.  
C. Applying 
Fuzzy Cognitive 
Maps 
for Attributes 
Evaluation 
This step applies FCM in order to evaluate the quality of 
the hotels with respect to the extracted evaluation criteria, 
i.e., attributes, from Section II.A and to identify the effect of 
each criterion to the review rating. An FCM is a graph 
consisting of nodes Ci that represent the concepts of the 
domain in study, connected to each other with weighted arcs 
W(i,j) showing how concept i is causally affected by concept 
j. The weights on the arcs connecting two concepts 
correspond to fuzzy qualifiers, such as ‘a little’, 
‘moderately’, ‘a lot’, or fuzzy numbers can be assigned in 
order to show the extent to which a concept affects another. 
FCMs are used to model and study perceptions about a 
domain, to investigate the interrelationships among its 
concepts and to draw conclusions based on the implications 
of scenarios. The impact among the concepts of a FCM is 
estimated using the indirect effect i.e., the impact caused due 
to the interrelationships among the concepts along the path 
from a cause variable (X) to an effect variable (Y) and the 
total effect, i.e., the sum of all the indirect effects from the 
cause variable X to the effect variable Y [33]. 
FCMs can be represented by means of an N×N matrix E 
= [eij], where N is the number of the concepts in the FCM 
with i and j representing concepts in the FCM. Every value 
eij of this matrix represents the strength and direction of 
causality between interrelated concepts. The value of 
causality eij is assigned values from the interval [-1, +1], as 
follows [34]: 
 
eij > 0 indicates a causal increase or positive 
causality from node i to j. 
 
eij = 0 there is no causality from node i to j. 
 
eij < 0 indicates a causal decrease or negative 
causality from node i to j. 
The multiplication between matrices representing FCMs 
produces the indirect and total effects [35] and allows the 
study of the impact that a given causal effect D1 causes. 
Causal effects can be represented with a 1×N vector [36]. 
This impact is calculated through repeated multi-plications: 
E × D1 = D2, E × D2 = D3 and so on, that is, E × Di = Di+1, 
until equilibrium is reached, which is the final result of the 
effect D1. Equilibrium is reached when the final result equals 
to zero, i.e., all cells of the resulting vector are equal to zero 
(0) and there is no any further causal impact caused by any 
concept. Different thresholds, depending on the modelling 
needs, restrict the values that result from each multiplication 
within the range [-1, +1] [32].  
The FCM suitability for hotel quality evaluation through 
online review is argued by considering that a variety of what 
– if sensitivity simulations can be performed effectively. 
Through what – if simulations, hotels can identify a set of 
relevant review factors, pertaining to the customer 
63

satisfaction as well as hotel services that need to be 
improved. In the proposed approach, the FCM concepts 
matrix consists of the extracted evaluation criteria plus an 
additional concept referring to the review rating. The latter is 
affected by all the other concepts and does not affect any of 
them.  
The FCM is applied separately for each hotel in order to 
allow each hotel gaining meaningful insights for its 
performance. However, there is also the possibility for 
aggregated results of more than one hotel (e.g., in one region 
of interest, specific number of stars, same overall review 
rating, etc.) in the sense of an “augmented topology”, thus 
allowing the combination of multiple FCMs into a single 
knowledge-based representation. Multiple weighted FCMs 
are combined into a single averaged FCM by adding their 
scaled and augmented adjacency weight matrix. This 
procedure is based on the mathematical transformation of the 
causal weight matrices [37]. If the FCMs involve different 
concepts, each causal matrix is augmented by adding a new 
column and row filled with zeros for each additional concept.  
IV. 
RESULTS  
The proposed methodology was applied to a dataset 
including six 4-star hotels in Athens, Greece. Each hotel had 
60 reviews consisting, among others, of the review title, the 
review comments, and the review rating. The superset of the 
FCM concepts is shown in Table I. These concepts represent 
the extracted evaluation criteria from FPMT (C1-C9) along 
with the review rating (C10).

After the fuzzy evaluation of the aforementioned 
concepts for each hotel, the weight matrix is created and is 
inserted to the FCM model. Figure 1 depicts the result for 
one indicative hotel, while Figure 2 depicts the augmented 
FCM topology of all the six hotels under examination. The 
C10: Review Rating has been put on the left so that the effect 
of the various attributes on the review rating is more visible. 
For these visualizations as well as for experimental purposes, 
we used the “FCM Expert” software tool [37]. The rest of 
the experimental analysis deals with the augmented 
topology, thus providing insights on a regional basis. As 
shown in Figure 2, the review rating (C10) is mainly affected 
by Location (C1), Cleanliness (C3), Room Space (C4) and 
Interior Design (C8). 
Table II presents the values related to the degree 
centrality. It is a local centrality measure determined by only 
its directed connections. The degree centrality of a node is 
the summation of its absolute incoming (indegree) and 
outgoing (outdegree) connection weights. Furthermore, we 
performed inference using various reasoning rules (Kosko’s 
activation rule, Kosko’s activation rule with self-memory, 
Rescaled activation rule with self-memory) in order to 
compute the output vector including the weights of the 
concepts. Figure 3 presents an indicative visualization of our 
results. Specifically, Figure 3a depicts a chart and Figure 3b 
depicts a table with the iterations of the algorithm until 
convergence.

learning, differential Hebbian learning, and balanced 
differential Hebbian learning. Hebbian learning constitutes 
an unsupervised technique initially applied on the training of 
artificial neural networks [38]. The main feature of this 
learning rule is that the change of a synaptic is computed by 
taking into account the presynaptic and postsynaptic signals 
flow towards each processing unit (neuron) of a neural 
network [39].

Hebbian rule varies significantly compared to the outcomes 
of differential Hebbian learning and balanced differential 
Hebbian learning. Non-linear Hebbian learning constitutes 
an extension of differential Hebbian learning and is able to 
capture effectively non-linear relationships [40]. However, 
despite the differences in the estimated weight vector of the 
criteria, all the aforementioned implementations result in the 
same order of significance in terms of their impact on the 
review rating (C10), i.e., C8 – C3 – C4 – C9 – C5 – C2 – C1 
– C7 – C6.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
Hotel quality evaluation from online reviews is an 
emerging research field, while the use of data analytics and 
machine learning methods are able to exploit its full potential 
in an e-tourism context. This paper proposed an approach for 
hotel quality evaluation according to online review 
comments and ratings using FPM for mining customers’ 
opinions and FCM for evaluating the attributes that 
contribute to the review rating. The results show that the 
proposed approach is able to model the complex dynamics of 
online hotel review data, which are derived from both the 
textual nature of the review comments and the uncertain 
relationships between these comments and the review rating. 
Regarding our future work, we plan to apply our 
methodology to further datasets and to investigate the role of 
user profiling in hotel selection.
