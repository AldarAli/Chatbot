Abstract— Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) is associated with 
cardiac arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. The Long QT 
Type 2 (LQT2) phenotype, which accounts for 35–40 % of all 
LQTS patients, is caused by mutations in HERG gene. The 
mechanisms of arrhythmia in presence of LQT2 conditions are 
not 
fully 
understood. 
We 
utilized 
anatomically 
and 
electrophysiologically 
realistic 
numerical 
simulations 
to 
elucidate the mechanisms of arrhythmia initiation in presence 
of blockade in rapid component of delayed rectifier potassium 
current, IKr. We utilized a 3D finite element model of rabbit 
ventricles integrated with His-purkinje network to simulate 
whole heart response to LQT2 conditions. We observed that the 
loss of IKr function produced more severe phenotype in cardiac 
Purkinje cells than that in ventricular myocytes. Our 
simulations also revealed that arrhythmia susceptibility is 
increased when there is a loss of IKr functionality.  Our multi-
scale computer modeling results provide useful insights into the 
potential mechanisms of arrhythmia in LQT2 conditions.

 INTRODUCTION  
The Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is an acquired or 
congenital cardiac electrical disorder characterized by the 
prolongation of the QT interval on an ECG, which is 
associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and 
sudden cardiac death [1]–[3]. Gene mutations in KCNQ1 (the 
gene that encodes slow delayed rectifier potassium current, 
IKs), HERG (the gene that encodes rapid delayed rectifier 
potassium current, IKr), and SCN5A (the gene that encodes 
fast inward sodium current, INa) are responsible for LQT1, 
LQT2, and LQT3 respectively, which account for 95% of the 
congenital LQTS in patients [3]–[5]. In LQT2, mutations in 
HERG cause partial or complete blockade of IKr which delays 
the repolarization process causing action potential (AP) 
prolongation and subsequent prolonged QT interval in ECG. 
A myriad of IKr-blocking drugs, such as E-4031 
(benzenesulfonamide), dofetilide or D-sotalol, may also lead 
to drug-induced LQTS [2]. Arrhythmia occurrence has been 
well documented in LQT2 patients, but exact mechanisms are 
still poorly understood.  
Numerical biophysical models with high fidelity can offer 
the missing mechanistic link between experimental or 
clinical findings and their therapeutic implications. 
Fortunately, very advanced biophysical computer models, 
numerical techniques and computing facilities are available 
today to conduct realistic “numerical experiments”. We have 
used detailed computer modeling to study the functional 
effects of various cardiac mutations [6]–[8] as well as to 
investigate complex arrhythmia mechanisms [9][10]. Iyer et 
al. used computer models of Purkinje Cell (PC) and 
Ventricular Myocyte (VM) to study alterations in channel 
functions in different LQT phenotypes and concluded that the 
His-Purkinje system (PS) may represent an important 
therapeutic target for heritable channelopathies [11]. 
Seemann et al. [12] used a heterogeneous and anisotropic 
three-dimensional computational model of the human 
ventricles to study LQT1, LQT2, and LQT3. Recently, 
patient-specific numerical models of LQTS using human 
induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes

(hiPSC-CMs) have been used to investigate the loss of 
repolarizing currents on AP abnormalities [3][13][14]. The 
high incidence of LQT2 compared to other LQTS types 
except for LQT1 [15] and the significant consideration of the 
blockade of HERG channels in the developmental process for 
new drugs makes it more imperative to have a complete 
understanding of the mechanisms of LQT2 [16]. 
In this paper, we present a multiscale computer modeling 
approach to investigate the effects of complete or partial IKr 
blockade at single cell and 3D ventricular anatomy levels in 
rabbit heart. The effects of IKr block on AP morphology in 
two cell types: ventricular myocytes (VM) and cardiac 
Purkinje cells (PCs), and implications on reentry initiation in 
ventricles were studied systematically.  
This paper is composed of four main sections. In section 
1, which is the introduction, gives an overview of LQTS. A 
literature review on how LQTS has been studied both in 
simulation and experimentation. It then follows up with a 
justification for studying LQT2 syndrome and the approach 
we used for the studies. Section 2 describes how we 
performed single cell biophysical and 3D anatomical 
simulations respectively. We further explained how reentry 
was initiated in the 3D anatomical model. The results section 
follows section 2, and it gives an account of the observations 
from our simulations. In section 3(discussion), we discussed 
our results and compared them to our findings in literature. 
The last section(conclusion) provides a summary of our work 
and the outcomes likely to result from it. 
II. 
METHODS 
A. Single cell Biophysical Simulations 
Single cell AP simulations were performed using rabbit 
VM biophysical model by Mahajan et al. [17] and rabbit PC 
model by Aslanidi et al. [18]. Both models were paced at 500 
ms basic cycle length (BCL) for 50 sec to attain steady state 
before they were used in simulations. IKr was blocked from 
0% (Control) to 100% (complete blockade) by applying 
corresponding scaling to the maximum conductance of IKr and 
its effect on AP durations at 50% and 90% repolarization 
(APD50 and APD90, respectively) were studied in both tissue 
types. 
B. 3D Anatomical Simulations 
The 3D simulations were performed in a rabbit ventricular 
anatomical model. The model consists of a finite element 
tetrahedral mesh, based on the San Diego rabbit heart [19], 
consisting of 547,680 myocardial nodes (862,515 nodes 
including surrounding bath and cavities), with an average 
internodal spacing of 250 μm (see Figure 1). LV and RV stand 
for are left ventricle and right ventricle, respectively. 
The PS comprised of a branching network of one-
dimensional cubic Hermite elements. PS nodes were 
separated by discrete gap junctions that were modeled as fixed 
resistances. The purkinje-myocardial junctions (PMJs) were 
modeled as resistive junctions as described in [20]. The 
electrical activity in the tissue was modeled by bidomain

equations as described elsewhere [10][20]. The intracellular, 
𝛷𝑖 and extracellular,  𝛷𝑒 potentials are related through the 
transmembrane current density, 𝐼m by the equations: 
 
 
∇. (σi̅ + σ̅e)∇Φe = −∇. σi̅∇Vm − 𝐼e

∇. σi̅∇Vm = −∇. σi̅∇Φe + 𝛽𝐼m 
 
(2) 
 
𝐼m =  Cm
∂Vm
∂t + 𝐼ion(Vm, ν) − 𝐼trans 
(3) 
 
, where σi̅ and σ̅e are the intracellular and extracellular 
conductivity tensors respectively, 𝛽 is the surface-to-volume 
ratio of the cardiac cells, 𝐼trans is the transmembrane current 
density stimulus as delivered by the intracellular electrode, 𝐼e 
is the extracellular stimulus current density, Cm  is the 
membrane capacitance per unit area, Vm is the transmembrane 
voltage which is defined as 𝛷𝑖 − 𝛷𝑒
 and 𝐼ion is the current 
density flowing through the membrane ionic channels which 
depends on the transmembrane voltage and several other 
variables ν [28]. 
The membrane biophysics of ventricular myocardium (V) 
was simulated by Mahajan et. al. model [17] whereas that of 
Purkinje network was simulated by Aslanidi et al. model [18].   
To simulate sinus rhythm activity, stimulus was applied to 
the top nodes of His bundle with BCL of 500 ms for at  
least 5 sec before any simulation protocol was applied. To 
ascertain the cardiac activity in the presence of LQT2 
phenotype, maximum conductance of IKr   in both V and PS 
was reduced by a percentage (25% block, 50% block and 
100% block). Pseudo ECGs were generated by extrapolating 
the extracellular potentials to approximate limb locations for 
leads I, II and III. 
C. Reentry Induction Protocol 
Reentry was simulated by S1-S2 protocol for Control and 
100% IKr block in V and PS. The myocardial conductivity in 
the model was reduced by 50% to slow the conduction and 
accommodate reentry wavelength in the tissue. Both models 
were paced at His with BCL of 500 ms for 5 sec to simulate 
sinus rhythm (S1). Then an ectopic stimulus (S2 stimulus) 
was delivered to a quarter region of myocytes on the right 
ventricle. The S1-S2 duration was varied between 200-300ms

in the steps of 10 ms to determine a window of vulnerability 
to reentry initiation. The S1-S2 duration was varied in steps 
of 1-5ms within the window of vulnerability to allow fine-
grain control of the timing at which reentry occurs. The 
reentrant activations were classified as tachycardia if they 
were sustained beyond 500 ms duration. 
The 3D simulations were performed using Cardiac 
Arrhythmia Research Package (CARP), an in-silico cardiac 
simulator [21]. Single cell simulations were performed using 
bench utility in OpenCARP simulator [21]. All simulations 
were performed on High Performance  
Computing (HPC) facilities of Old Dominion University 
(ODU) using 40 computing nodes and 2GB of physical 
memory per node.

RESULTS 
A. Ventricular myocyte and Purkinje cell action potential 
Figures 2A and B show the rabbit AP for both the VM 
and PC from the single cell simulations with varying IKr block 
ranging from 0% (Control)to 100% (complete blockade). 
Both the VM and PC APs exhibited the characteristic spike 
and dome morphology. In VM, the APD90 was prolonged by 
13% as compared to the Control when IKr was completely 
blocked (192 ms in Control vs. 216 ms in 100% block).  The 
effect of IKr block in PC was more severe in which the APD90 
was prolonged by 26% when IKr was blocked completely

the percent prolongation in APD90 for various extents of IKr 
block in VM and PC models.  
B. Pseudo-ECG Recordings During Sinus Rythm  
Pseudo-ECGs for the primary three leads (I, II and III) 
were derived during sinus rhythm for Control and IKr block 
models. Figure 3 shows Lead I ECGs during sinus rhythm 
with aligned QRS for comparison. The QT prolongation was 
evident when IKr was blocked, and the extent of QT 
prolongation increased with the extent of IKr blockade.The 
QT duration measured was 94ms, 100 ms, 104 ms, and 114 
ms for the control, 50% IKr, 75% IKr and 100% IKr block, 
respectively. 
C. Window of Vulnerability to Reentry  
Figure 4 summarizes the outcome of S1-S2 stimulation in 
Control and 100% IKr block models. If S2 stimulus occurred 
too soon, it was blocked by the refractory tissue (grey region). 
Whereas if S2 occurred too late, it was conducted by the 
entire ventricular tissue causing a premature excitation (blue 
region). When the S2 stimulus occurred when the tissue is 
partially excitable, more complex interactions were observed. 
In this case, the timing of the ectopic stimulus yielded the 
following consequences: 1) when myocytes in the vicinity of 
the stimulus were excitatory and right bundle branch (RBB) 
was excitatory, the ectopic stimulus induced activations in the 
right ventricle, which were picked up by the right distal 
purkinje fibers and conducted retrogradely through the PS.  
The retrograde activations spread rapidly through the 
RBB exciting the left bundle branch (LBB) and the left 
ventricle, and 2) when myocytes in the vicinity of the 
stimulus were excitatory but the RBB was refractory, the 
right purkinje fibers blocked the activity from spreading 
through the RBB. The activations spread to the left ventricle 
via transseptal conduction instead. These two scenarios 
resulted in reentry and ventricular tachycardia (red region).  
It is also evident from the figure that the window of 
tachycardia occurrence is extended significantly when IKr is

blocked. Thus, the ventricles are more susceptible to 
arrhythmia in presence of IKr block induced LQT2 phenotype. 
D. Simulated Reentry Mechanism 
Figure 5 shows a typical activation sequence in presence 
of 100% IKr   block for a reentry duration that lasted at least 
500 ms hence was referred to as tachycardia. The ectopic 
stimulus was delivered when the S1-S2 interval was 240 ms. 
When the ectopic stimulus was applied, the RV myocytes in  
the vicinity of the stimulus were excitatory while the RBB  
was refractory (Figure 5A). The ectopic stimulus induced 
activations in ventricles which were picked up by right distal 
PS network (see Figure 5A black arrow, V- P). 
However, the excitation within the PS was blocked by the 
refractory RBB, thus preventing retrograde propagation 
towards the LBB. Excitations spread to the left ventricle via 
transseptal conduction (Figure 5A, white arrow). Due to the 
slowed conduction in the septum, the LBB recovers 
completely before the activation is picked up by the left distal 
PS network (Figure 5B). The activation excites the LBB 
which conducts retrogradely to the RBB, thus exciting the 
right PS and RV (Figure 5B, white arrow).   
At 5500 ms, stimulus from the His bundle is blocked by 
both the RBB and LBB because both branches are refractory. 
Retrograde propagation from the LBB to RBB between 5500 
and 5700 ms (Figure 5C) experiences a conduction block 
(CB) (Figure 5C, blue arrow). Excitation spreads to the right 
via transseptal conduction. Both bundle branches were now 
excitable as excitation reached the right (Figure 5D). 
Excitation from the ventricle (Figure 5D, black arrow, V-P) 
excites the RBB. Retrograde propagation (Figure 5D, yellow 
arrow, P-P) through the RBB reached the LBB, exciting it 
and the LV. Similar excitation pattern continued throughout 
the duration of tachycardia. 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
In this study, we utilized single cell biophysical models of 
ventricular myocyte and Purkinje cell as well as 3D 
anatomical model of ventricles to investigate the susceptibility 
to arrhythmia in presence of HERG mutation leading to loss 
of IKr function. The main findings of our numerical study 
include: 1) loss of IKr function results in prominent QT 
prolongation in ECG, 2) the effects of IKr blockade on AP 
morphology are more severe in cardiac  
purkinje cells than that in ventricular myocytes, 3) the loss of 
IKr function increases the spatial dispersion of repolarization 
and refractoriness resulting into increased vulnerability to 
reentry and ventricular tachycardia, and 4) the His-Purkinje  
system plays an active role during maintenance of 
tachycardia. 
A. AP Morphology in PC vs. VM 
The characteristic spike and dome morphology was more 
prominent in the rabbit PC than in VM. Higher peak density 
of transient outward current (Ito) has been reported in rabbit 
PCs than ventricles [22] which produces the characteristic 
early repolarization in PCs. The inward rectifying potassium 
current (IK1), which is responsible for keeping the cell at rest, 
is smaller in PC [22] than in ventricles. This results in a larger 
diastolic membrane resistance in PC allowing small charge 
displacements to cause significant changes in the membrane 
voltage [23]. The higher resistance accounts for the more 
substantial change in APD90 in PCs than VMs. IKr is the 
prominent repolarizing current in PCs. PCs also exhibit lower 
repolarization reserve than in VMs [27], hence the effects of 
IKr block on AP prolongation are more significant in PCs than 
VMs.   
B. QT Prolongation in Pseudo-ECG 
The limited availability of more definitive tests for LQTS 
makes ECG very important in its diagnosis [6]. Single-cell 
studies can only determine how much an APD is altered and 
cannot quantify the percentage QT prolongation. The 
widespread distribution of electrical pulses throughout the 
ventricles is mediated by the PS, and there is a significant 
change in the behavior of PS when it is coupled to a large 
mass of ventricular muscle [14] due to electrotonic loading. 
Our 3D model comprised of an integrated His-PS network 
which is capable of reproducing myocardial loading effects. 
Our model was able to successfully reproduce the prolonged 
QT interval and prominent notching of the T in ECGs 
corresponding to the loss of IKr as reported previously [6]. 
C. Arrhythmia in LQTS 
Repolarization in cardiomyocytes depends on a delicate 
balance 
between 
various 
ionic 
currents. 
Abnormal 
repolarization of the AP provides a substrate for life-
threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Early afterdepolarizations

 (EADs), which are abnormal membrane depolarizations 
during the plateau or the repolarization phase of an AP, are 
thought to be responsible for arrhythmia initiation in LQTS. 
EADs increase substrate vulnerability (by increasing APD 
dispersion) and promote triggers for reentry formation [19]. In 
vivo monophasic AP recordings from the LV endocardium of 
rabbits induced with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia was 
preceded by deflections consistent with EADs in the 
monophasic APs [24].  The mutations in the HERG channel 
can prolong APD sufficient to generate EADs which may 
trigger life-threatening arrhythmias [25]. Electrophysiological 
studies of transgenic LQT1 and LQT2 rabbits reported 
prolonged APD and QT intervals; however atrioventricular 
(AV) blocks and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia were 
developed only in LQT2 rabbits [26].  
In our study, we demonstrated tachycardia induction by 
applying a premature stimulus, which has a similar effect of 
EAD-induced tachycardia. More simulations are warranted to 
establish the mechanisms for increased susceptibility of the 
ventricular conduction system to trigger EAD-induced 
arrhythmia in LQT2 conditions. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
We presented a multiscale numerical simulation study to 
investigate the arrhythmogenic effects of HERG channel 
block producing an LQT2 phenotype. Our model was able to 
reproduce clinically observed QT prolongation in ECG as a 
result of IKr block. Our study revealed that, a complete IKr 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
blockade results into more severe phenotype in Purkinje cells 
than in ventricular myocytes. The window of susceptibility to 
reentry that degrades into tachycardia was significantly 
prolonged in presence of IKr block. Our simulation outcomes 
may provide vital insights into the mechanisms of arrhythmia 
susceptibility as observed in LQT2 patients.
