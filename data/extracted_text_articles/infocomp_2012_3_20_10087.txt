Abstract—For investigating the nonlinear character at the 
confusion and cluster process of cryptography, the nonlinear 
transformation’s 
impact 
factor 
has 
been 
introduced. 
According to sorting result by different years, the amount of 
online cryptography is accounted. And then the nonlinear 
indexes, which are related to the outcome of amount reflecting 
the nonlinear character directly, are researched at the 
confusion process and the cluster process respectively. The 
nonlinear transformation’s impact factor which includes both 
the private-key cryptography and public-key cryptography is 
studied with known nonlinear index at naïve Bayesian model, 
which combines with the networks environment fused in 
protocol whenever confusion or cluster process. To any 
networks environment, higher the nonlinear transformation’s 
impact factor is, more popular the used cryptography is 
because more amounts of kinds of level users requiring 
stronger secure cryptography. So, the impact factor of the 
nonlinear transformation is a kind of cryptography’s label 
indicating the suitable to application environment by suitable 
crowd. Contrarily, the extent of secure can measure up the 
nonlinear character of cryptography precisely.

 INTRODUCTION  
Nonlinear transformation (NT) [1][2][3][4][5], which 
exists at any kinds of secure communication systems, is an 
important part of cryptographic study. The cryptography 
includes private key and public key cryptography. The 
private key cryptography is a secure process which uses one 
secret key to confuse and recover the information, and the 
private key process system is depend on a pseudorandom 
number generator, such as HASH [6][7][8], the block 
cipher[9][10][11][12], the stream cipher[13][14][15]. The 
public key cryptography is a process which is used two keys 
to ensure the information, and it is based on a mathematic 
problem, such as integer factorization and Elliptic curve 
[16][17][18][19]. Whether private or public key, the NT is 
evolved [20][21][22] from value tables supported by 
development of the information technology[23]. Since the 
Future Internet [24][25][26][27][28], wireless sensor[29][30], 
RFID[31][32] and quantum communication [33][34][35] are 
developed, the application of block cipher, stream cipher and 
HASH[36] is prevalence to ensure the communication’s 
secure. The RSA [37], ECC[38] are used at mini-information 
secure condition, such as digital signature, key exchange 
schemes. The 
Lattice-based cryptosystem 
is simply 
introduced at the paper. The NT Impact factor (IF) of 
cryptography is a simple and popular way to value the NT 
influence at Bayesian model [39][40][41]. 
This paper focuses on the nonlinear transformation 
impact factor of cryptography, which is clustering with the 
different time, different scales of nonlinear transformation 
and different application environment. The rest of the paper 
is organized as follows. Section 2 contains the two inversed 
study directions which are confusion process and cluster 
process at cryptography. The nonlinear indexes and NT IF 
according to Bayesian model are described in section 3. 
Section 4 includes conclusion about the effect of NT IF.

CONFUSION AND CLUSTER PROCESS AT CRYPTO 
The confusion and cluster process are the certain parts of 
encipher and decipher of information at cryptography. The 
whole cryptographic system is a nonlinear process because 
of the sharing of NT or nonlinear mathematic problem. The 
confusion process is the nonlinear part besides the key

addition and linear diffusion process at secret key condition, 
and it is the whole operation process at the public key 
condition. Meanwhile the cluster process is the first step 
which is a simple differential sort process at whenever the 
secret key cryptographic system’s condition of white box, 
gray box or black box, and is the exponent of the public key 
cryptographic. It shows the sort of online cryptography 
according to the change of time at figure 1. The published 
online cryptography amount has a jump as figure 2.

A. Confusion and Cluster Process Precisely Depicted  
The confusion processes and cluster processes of 
cryptography sort out to 5 categories, which are confusion of 
block cipher, of stream cipher, of HASH, of RSA and of 
ECC in this paper. The confusion process of block cipher has 
a NT, which is from N bits to M bits. At the beginning of the 
published block cipher, the confusion process is constructed 
by 6 bites to 4 bits NT, which is activated 4 to 8 times and 
repeated 16 rounds, such as DES in 1976. IDEA is also an 
old block cipher which is 16 bits to 16 bites NT repeated 8.5 
rounds in 1991. Updated block cipher is constructed by 8 bits 
to 8 bits NT activated 8 to 16 times and repeated 10, 12 or 14 
rounds, such as AES in 1998. Camellia is a new block cipher 
which is the same nonlinear part similar as AES repeated 18 
rounds in 2000. The stream cipher has none any nonlinear 
part at first, such as A5 used in the GSM cellular telephone 
standard. From November 2004 to April 2008, the project 
founded by EU ECRYPT network founded, eSTREAM, 
identify new stream ciphers suitable for widespread adoption. 
Salsa20, which is based on software, is one of the winners. 
The NT of Salsa20 is 128 bits to 128 bits repeated 20 rounds. 
Trivium based on hardware is one of the winners. Its NT is 
228 bits to 228 bits at 4th rounds. Those are some nonlinear 
emblematical transformations. 
The old HASH SHA1 is published at 1995, which is 96 
bits to 96 bits NT repeated 80 rounds. SHA2 has a NT which 
is 96 bits to 96 bits activated 2 or 4 times repeated 64 or 80 
rounds. A new SHA3 competition is an open competition 
from October 31, 2008 to the end of 2012, and the final 
round candidates have occurred on December 10, 2010. 
Keccak of finalists has a NT, which is 192 bits of 64 bit 
memory to 64 bits repeated 24 rounds. Skein of finalist has a 
NT, the designers call it MIX, which is 128 bits to 128 bits 
repeated 72 rounds or 256 bits to 256 bits repeated 80 rounds. 
RSA and ECC are another typical type of cryptography 
comparing to block cipher, stream cipher and HASH, being 
called the public key cryptography. While the RSA patent 
expired in 2000, the NT of RSA is the naïve bit amount of 
prime number at ANSI X9.31 in 1998, which is 1024 bits. 
Meanwhile, the NT of ECC is the 192, 224, 256, 384, and 
521 bits according to FIPS 186-3 in 2009. The Lattice based 
cryptography is a new mathematic problem appears with the 
post-quantum cryptography. The "ideal lattice" designed by 
Craig Gentry, which is announced by IBM at 6.2009, NL is 
depicted by the Lattice problem in n-dimensional Euclidean 
space Rn with a strong periodicity property. 
B. Nonlinear Transformations at a Confusion process  
The confusion process is to confuse the information to 
pseudo-random data which cannot be reversed at the useful-
life time of the information. The different cryptography uses 
different nonlinear transformation to obtain the random. The 
block ciphers, being the popularity from public game AES, 
have active or non-active model at NT. If the box or the 
value table implement at NT part, the active number of box 
affects the nonlinear complexity and speed directly. More 
active boxes, more complexity the NT is. The mathematic 
problem NT depends on the exponent of the nonlinear 
function. There are some distinctions, which are the speed 
and secure influences, between all boxes activated and part 
of boxes activated at confusion process. There are some 
useful nonlinear factors at sub-key rolling in process. The 
information block and nonlinear complexity of sub-key are 
covered up by NT because they are far lower exponent than 
NT’s. And then, the effect of NT is diffused with a linear 
array. By the way, a block cipher is constituted by iterative 
rounds which include information block, sub-key addition, 
NT and diffusion. The stream ciphers have a high speed 
character, which is usually suitable to the secure of wireless 
communication and a high-capacity bandwidth environment. 
The stream ciphers usually constitute by linear feedback shift 
register (LFSR) or nonlinear feedback shift register (NFSR) 
fusing by NT. If the NFSR is the part of a stream cipher, the 
resilience function, which has both better balance and better 
anti-differential analysis, is a better choice than bent function. 
The NT part of stream cipher can be just similar to a whole 
43

rounds or mini rounds of block cipher. And more and more 
simple NT fused directly to LFSR or NFSR is appearing, 
such as Trivium, Grain, or NUSH. Information is confused 
by a simple NT of stream cipher has lower secure but higher 
speed. HASH is a stream cipher or a block cipher adding 
kinds of digest function. The digest function is considered as 
a linear part so that the NT of HASH process refers to the 
stream or block cipher. So the NT of HASH is the same as 
the stream or block cipher. 
The confusion process of public key cryptography is to 
ensure the mini-scale communication key’s security. The 
mathematic confusion process is nonlinear because exponent 
is more than 1. The NT of RSA is up to 210 in 2010. Then 
the successor ECC has a popular confusion process at the 
equation y2 = x3+ax+b. So the NT of ECC is considered as 32. 
Until now, the idea model of the Lattice based confusion 
process is a no known bounds iteration of vectors at least 2 
equivalence dimensions. The NT of lattice based confusion 
process is (number at least 2)n, the n is unknown. 
C. Nonlinear Transformations at a Recovery Process  
A recovery process is to unveil the cipher step by step at 
the condition of White-box, grey-box and black-box. If the 
confusion process is totally published, the recovery process 
is at a white-box situation. If there only are confusion date or 
some parts of confusion process, the recovery process is at a 
black-box or a grey-box situation. The NT at a recovery 
process based on a white-box has to operate carefully rounds 
by rounds, or just operates the reversed process of the 
mathematic problem. At this situation, the NT is strictly 
equal to the reverse of NT at confusion process. According 
the grey-box and black-box conditions, the cluster process is 
necessary to congregate the confusion date. By the NT of 
cluster process, the data is sorted by some factors, such as 
the linear index, the nonlinear index, characters of Pseudo-
Randomness or avalanche, including by other mathematic 
ways and means. Then those sorts are the results of first 
glimpse of the recovery process, in which the grey-box is 
covered to the white-box and the black-box to grey-box. The 
black-box is equivalent to several grey-boxes which also are 
considered as the scale of white-box based on the results. 
When the cluster data has a certain sameness with a certain 
white-box, the grey-box can be equal to the white-box at the 
scale. In conclusion, the black boxes mix with white boxes 
according to results of NF cluster at recovery process can be 
converted to grey boxes, which are prepared to be white. 
So, the cluster process of NT can recovery white-box 
completely and converse the deep color box to undertone 
box in basis of confusion date clustering. 
III. 
NONLINEAR INDEXES BASED ON BAYESIAN MODEL  
Bayesian inference is a rational engine for solving such 
problems within a probabilistic framework, and consequently 
is the heart of most probabilistic models of nonlinear indexes 
the cryptography. The nonlinear indexes, which include the 
private-key cryptography and public-key cryptography are 
sorted at naïve Bayesian model, whenever it’s confusion or 
cluster process. The simple NT index reflect the nonlinear 
character itself meanwhile the NT IF combine the networks 
or cryptography protocols into NT index. 
A. Nonlinear transformations index at cryptography  
The nonlinear transformations index at cryptography is a 
kind of rough description about the strength of cryptography. 
The NT index of block cipher is the product of the active 
boxes number of a block and exponent of nonlinear function. 
For example, the NT index of standard AES which has 16 
actives s-boxes at each of 10 rounds is that product of 8 and 
160. The NT index of stream cipher is the sum of each part 
of nonlinear functions’ exponent. The stream cipher Grain 
has a NT index which is the product of 3 and 6. The NT 
index of HASH evolved from the certain cipher, which is 
block cipher or stream cipher, is the same count method as 
the certain cipher. The NT index of public-key cryptography, 
such as RSA or ECC, is that 1024 or 9 referring to the 
standard. The ECC has the homothetic nonlinear character as 
private-key cryptography. 
If only consider the NT index, the block cipher is equal 
to many times of stream cipher, such as NT index of AES is 
about 72 times of Grain. Meanwhile, RSA is almost equal to 
120 times of ECC. Thus, standard AES can be secure the 72 
times bandwidth data the same as Grain. The signature with 
RSA is equal to 72 signatures of ECC. The figure3 shows the 
NT IF by years at different networks environment. 
 
 
Figure 3.  NT IF at different environments according to time  
B. The Nonlinear Transformations Impact Factor Based 
on Naïve Bayesian Model  
The NT impact factor is related to NT index according to 
the application of cryptography at the naïve Bayesian model. 
The NT index reflects the nonlinear character directly and 
NT IF combines with the networks environment fused in 
protocol. So T0 is the NT index which is the cryptography’s 
nonlinear measure and the T1 is that is the different networks. 
Naive Bayesian networks are identified with theories at the 
lowest, most concrete level of the abstraction hierarchy, level 
T0. The categorization grammars are typically identified with 
the T1-level theories that define hypothesis spaces of T0-level 
structures and assign prior probabilities to those hypotheses, 
thereby guiding inferences about the naive network structure 
T0 mostly likely to have given rise to some observed dataset 
d. A Bayesian learner evaluates a naive network hypothesis 
T0 based on its posterior probability: 
44

INFOCOMP 2012 : The Second International Conference on Advanced Communications and Computation

P (T0|d,T1) =（P(d|T0)P(T0|T1)）/P(d|T1)     (1)  
where the denominator is 
P (d|T1) =   
P(d|T0)P(T0|T1)    (2) 
The naive grammar T1 specifies a probabilistic process 
for generating naive-network hypotheses. With such a 
Bayesian model, the NT IF of cryptography is discussed in a 
causal way which is considered as naive condition. NT IF is 
the iteration of Bayesian model result and the amount of the 
cryptography. There is one kind of NT based on ciphers’ 
application among different networks which occurs between 
private-key cryptography and public-key cryptography. So 
the NT IF is identical as the cryptography amount online. 
The table1 is the NT IF result considered the impact by the 
frequency of same networks environment.

IV. 
CONCLUSION 
The nonlinear character of both private-key cryptography 
and public-key cryptography is expressed by the nonlinear 
transformation’s impact factor simply. At confusion process, 
the NT IF is a complexity of nonlinear character. At cluster 
process, the NT IF is the appearance color of nonlinear box 
or the known degree of a cryptography algorithm. At any 
networks, higher the NT IF is, the more popularity the 
cryptography is used. The reason is that more amounts of 
users require stronger secure level. Furthermore, the NT’s IF 
of cryptography at confusion and cluster process based on 
Bayesian model, which is an advanced description of the 
nonlinear character according to the different application 
environments, demonstrates that higher NT IF is a suitable 
wider width-band data communication. The NT IF can be a 
label of a cryptography system indicating the suitable crowd 
and suitable application environment. Contrarily, the extent 
of cryptography’s secure can be measure up the NT impact 
factor’s precision deeply.
