Abstract— This research paper explores the potential of 
enhancing 
cognitive 
robots' 
knowledge 
transfer 
and 
performance through the application of metacognitive 
strategies. An ontology called "Cognitive Robotics with 
Metacognitive Strategies" (CRwMS) is proposed as a structured 
and clear framework for modeling and analyzing the impact of 
these strategies. The ontology accurately represents the 
concepts and relationships related to cognitive robots, their 
knowledge and skills, problem situations, solutions, and 
metacognitive 
strategies,

confirmed 
through 
expert 
validation and graph analysis. CRwMS Ontology is a useful tool 
for understanding and improving the performance of cognitive 
robots through the application of metacognitive strategies. The 
results of this study suggest that the CRwMS Ontology is a 
useful tool for understanding and improving the performance of 
cognitive robots through the application of metacognitive 
strategies.

robotics, ontology. 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
Cognitive robotics is a subfield of robotics that aims to 
imbue robots with intelligent behavior [1]. To achieve this, 
cognitive robotics involves providing robots with a processing 
architecture that enables them to learn and reason about how 
to behave in response to complex goals within a complex 
world [1][2].  
Metacognition has been extensively studied in humans to 
improve knowledge transfer and learning [9][10]. It refers to 
the ability to monitor and regulate one's own cognitive 
processes [11]. Metacognition involves understanding how 
we think, learn, and process information, as well as the ability 
to use this knowledge to improve our learning and problem-
solving abilities [12].  Metacognitive strategies are techniques 
that help individuals regulate and monitor their cognitive 
processes. They allow learners to understand how they learn 
and how to apply their knowledge and skills in different 
contexts. Utilizing metacognitive strategies can improve the 
learning abilities of cognitive robots, help them adapt to new 
situations, and transfer their knowledge more efficiently. 
Metacognitive strategies can be categorized into three main 
types: metacognitive knowledge, metacognitive regulation, 
and metacognitive experiences [9].  
In recent years, various research studies have explored the 
use of metacognitive strategies to enhance cognitive robots' 
knowledge transfer. These studies have shown promising 
results, demonstrating that metacognitive strategies can 
improve the robots' adaptability, flexibility, and performance. 
The use of metacognitive strategies has been shown to 
significantly enhance a cognitive robot's ability to transfer 
knowledge between different tasks, according to a study by 
[16]. The researchers utilized the Soar cognitive architecture 
to develop a robot with a diverse skill set. Implementing 
metacognitive strategies, which include self-monitoring and 
behavioral adjustment based on feedback, the robot 
demonstrated up to 50% greater efficiency in knowledge 
transfer between tasks. These results highlight the potential of 
metacognition as a valuable tool for improving the problem-
solving and learning capabilities of cognitive robots [16]. 
Another study demonstrated that metacognitive strategies 
could improve the cognitive robot's ability to learn from 
human demonstrations and transfer this knowledge to new 
environments [17]. 
One potential strategy for implementing metacognitive 
strategies in cognitive robots involves developing an ontology 
that represents the relevant concepts and relationships 
involved in cognitive robotics with metacognitive strategies 
[13] [14] [15]. 
Several studies have built ontologies to describe various 
aspects of metacognition. Unfortunately, there is no complete 
set of standardized features to describe the domain of 
metacognition applied to knowledge transfer in intelligent 
systems. Therefore, each study has developed partial 
ontologies to address specific problems such as failures in AI 
systems [18], metacognitive cycling [19], and metalevel 
control [14]. There is still a lack in the literature of a general 
ontology to describe the domain of knowledge transfer with 
the use of methodological strategies in cognitive robots. 
Metacognitive strategies offer a promising approach for 
developing more autonomous and adaptable cognitive robots, 
which can perform a wider range of tasks in various 
environments. However, more research is needed to fully 
explore the potential of metacognitive strategies for enhancing 
cognitive robots' knowledge transfer. 
In the described context, the main goal of this paper is to 
explore the use of metacognitive strategies to enhance 
cognitive robots' ability to transfer their knowledge and skills 
to solve new problems or situations. Specifically, the paper

examines the use of ontologies as a potential strategy for 
developing cognitive robots with metacognitive abilities, 
enabling the representation of relevant concepts and 
relationships involved in cognitive robotics. 
In this way, this study aims to comprehend the role of 
metacognition in knowledge transfer for cognitive robots, 
contributing to the development of more effective and 
efficient robots in various industries.  
The main contributions of this research are: 
•

for modeling and analyzing the impact of 
metacognitive strategies on knowledge transfer

strategies. The CRwMS Ontology provides a 
foundation for further exploration of these 
concepts and relationships. Future research in 
this area may lead to the development of more 
advanced and efficient cognitive robots.

II. RELATED WORKS 
 
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in 
understanding the role of metacognition in knowledge transfer 
for cognitive robots. This section presents a comprehensive 
review of the state of the art in the field of cognitive robots' 
knowledge transfer through metacognitive strategies. 
One of the foundational studies in this area was conducted 
by Gick et al. [23], who investigated the impact of 
metacognitive training on knowledge transfer in human 
learners. They found that individuals who received 
metacognitive training demonstrated higher levels of 
knowledge transfer compared to those who did not receive 
such training. This research highlighted the potential benefits 
of metacognitive strategies in improving knowledge transfer 
and sparked further exploration in the context of cognitive 
robots. 
Hernández et al. [22] explored the application of 
metacognitive strategies in the domain of autonomous 
navigation for cognitive robots. They developed a 
metacognitive control system that enabled the robots to 
monitor their perception, decision-making, and action 
execution processes. The results demonstrated that the robots 
equipped with metacognitive strategies exhibited improved 
navigation performance and adaptability in complex 
environments. 
In a similar way, Daglarli [21] focused on investigating the 
role of metacognition in problem-solving and decision-
making tasks for cognitive robots. The main components of 
the system were composed of several computational modules 
including dorsolateral, ventrolateral, anterior, and medial 
prefrontal regions. The findings of their study indicated that 
the inclusion of metacognitive strategies significantly 
improved the robots' problem-solving and decision-making 
abilities. 
Furthermore, recent research by Agbozo at al. [20] 
conducted a study to examine the application of metacognitive 
strategies in cognitive robots for knowledge transfer. They 
developed a framework that integrated metacognitive 
processes, such as self-reflection and self-regulation, into the 
cognitive architecture of the robots. The results demonstrated 
that the robots equipped with metacognitive strategies 
exhibited 
enhanced 
knowledge 
transfer 
capabilities, 
outperforming those without such strategies in manufacturing. 
Overall, the studies reviewed in this section highlight the 
increasing interest and potential benefits of integrating 
metacognitive strategies into cognitive robots for knowledge 
transfer. These works provide valuable insights into the design 
and implementation of metacognitive frameworks and their 
impact on improving the robots' performance in various 
domains. However, further research is needed to explore the 
specific mechanisms and algorithms that underlie effective 
metacognitive strategies in the context of cognitive robots. 
III. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER MODEL BASED ON 
METACOGNITIVE STRATEGIES 
In this section, a formal specification of the knowledge 
transfer model based on metacognitive strategies for cognitive 
robots is provided. The formal specification allows for a 
precise and rigorous representation of the model, ensuring 
clarity and consistency in its implementation and evaluation.  
Additionally, the formal specification and ontology for the 
knowledge transfer model based on metacognitive strategies 
in cognitive robots is presented.  
A. 
Formal specification 
Let 𝐶𝑅 be the set of cognitive robots with two cognitive 
levels, called meta level and object level. The object level in a 
cognitive robot maintains a model of the world that consists 
of a set of objects and their properties. This model enables the 
robot to perceive, reason about, and act upon the environment. 
The object level also uses cognitive processes, such as 
reasoning, learning, and problem-solving, to solve real-world 
problems. Let 𝑀 be the set of all possible models of the world 
that a cognitive robot can maintain.

The meta level of a cognitive robot maintains a model of 
the self, which allows the robot to monitor and control the 
cognitive processes that take place at the object level. The 
meta level also includes metacognitive processes, such as self-
awareness, reflection, and self-regulation, that enable the 
robot to reason about its own cognition and monitor and adapt 
its behavior accordingly. Let 𝑀𝑆 be the set of all possible 
metacognitive states that a cognitive robot can maintain. 
Let 𝐾 be the set of all knowledge and skills possessed by 
a given robot, including declarative, procedural, and 
metacognitive knowledge. 
Formally, the knowledge and skills of a cognitive robot 
𝑟 can be represented as a set of propositions: 
 𝐾𝑖  =  {𝜑1 𝜑2,. . . , 𝜑𝑛}  where 𝜑𝑖  is a proposition that 
represents a particular knowledge or skill possessed by 𝑟, with 
𝑟 ∈  𝐶𝑅. 
Let P be the set of all problem situations that a cognitive 
robot can encounter, and S be the set of solutions to these 
problems, which the robot can generate using its cognitive and 
metacognitive processes. 
𝑃 =  {𝑝1,𝑝2, . . . , 𝑝𝑛} , where 𝑝𝑖  is a structure that 
represents a particular problem situation. 
The set of solutions to these problems is represented as: 
𝑆 =  {𝑠1, 𝑠2, . . . , 𝑠𝑚} , where 𝑠𝑖  is a proposition that 
represents a particular solution to the corresponding problem 
𝑝𝑖. 
The set of problem situations that r can encounter is 
represented as: 
Properties of solutions can be defined as follows: 
Satisfiability: A solution is satisfiable if it is logically 
consistent and can be realized in the real world. This can be 
represented in Description Logics as 𝑆 ⊨  Φ , where Φ 
represents the logical constraints that must be satisfied for a 
solution to be considered feasible. 
Optimality: A solution is optimal if it is the best possible 
solution given a set of constraints and criteria. This can be 
represented in Description Logics as 𝑆 ⊨  Ψ  where Ψ 
represents the criteria and constraints used to evaluate the 
optimality of a solution. 
Feasibility: A solution is feasible if it can be implemented 
within a given set of constraints, such as time, cost, or 
resources. This can be represented in Description Logics as 
𝑆 ⊨  Ω , where Ω  represents the constraints that must be 
satisfied for a solution to be considered feasible. The transfer 
of knowledge and skills from one situation to another can be 
represented as a function 𝑇: 𝑃 ×  𝐶𝑅 ×  𝐾 →  𝑆. 
The model of the world at the object level is represented 
as a set of propositions: 
𝑀𝑟  = {𝑚1,𝑚2, .. . , 𝑚𝑘}, where 𝑚𝑖 is a proposition that 
represents a particular aspect of the world that 𝑟  has 
knowledge of. 
The cognitive processes used by 𝑟 to solve problems in the 
world are represented as a set of functions: 
𝐹𝑟  = {𝑓1,𝑓2, . . ., 𝑓𝑘}, where 𝑓𝑖 is a function that takes a 
problem situation 𝑝𝑖 and a model of the world 𝑀𝑟 , and 
produces a solution 𝑠𝑖. 
The model of the self at the meta level is represented as a 
set of propositions: 
𝑀′𝑟  =  {𝑚′1,𝑚′2, . . ., 𝑚′𝑙} , where 𝑚′𝑖  is a proposition 
that represents a particular aspect of 𝑟′𝑠  own cognitive 
processes. 
The cognitive processes used by 𝑟 to monitor and control 
its own cognitive processes are represented as a set of 
functions: 
𝐹′𝑟  = {𝑓′1,  𝑓′2, . . . ,𝑓′𝑙} , where 𝑓′𝑖  is a function that 
takes a model of the self 𝑀′𝑟 and a model of the world 𝑀𝑟, 
and produces a control action that influences the cognitive 
processes used to solve problems in the world. 
In the described context, a cognitive robot can be defined 
as a tuple 𝑟 = (𝑀, 𝑀𝑆, 𝐾, 𝑃,𝑆) , where 𝑀  is the set of 
possible models of the world, 𝑀𝑆  is the set of possible 
metacognitive states, 𝐾 is the set of knowledge and skills 
possessed by the robot, 𝑃 is the set of problem situations, and 
S is the set of solutions to these problems. The object level of 
the robot can be defined as a function 𝑂𝑏𝑗 ∶  𝑀 ×  𝐾 ×  𝑃 →
 𝑆 that maps a model of the world, knowledge and skills, and 
a problem situation to a solution. The meta level of the robot 
can be defined as a function 𝑀𝑒𝑡𝑎 ∶  𝑀𝑆 ×  𝑀 ×  𝐾 ×  𝑃 →
 𝑀𝑆 that maps a metacognitive state, a model of the world, 
knowledge and skills, and a problem situation to a new 
metacognitive state. 
Some properties and attributes of a cognitive robot 𝑟 are: 
Lists are easy to create: 
• 
𝑟 has the ability to learn from experience and 
adapt to new situations, which can be denoted 
as: 
o 
𝑟 ∈  𝐶𝑅 , where 𝐶𝑅  is the set of 
cognitive robots. 
o 
𝑟 has the property of "learning from 
experience." 
o 
𝑟 has the property of "adaptability". 
• 
𝑟 has a specific set of sensors and effectors that 
it uses to interact with its environment, which 
can be denoted as: 
o 
𝑟 has the property of “having sensors". 
o 
𝑟  has the property of "having 
effectors." 
o 
𝑟 has the property of "adaptability." 
• 
𝑟 can process and interpret sensory data using 
algorithms and computational models, which 
can be denoted as: 
o 
𝑟 has the property of "processing sensory 
data." 
o 
𝑟 has the property of "using algorithms and 
computational models." 
Integrating metacognitive strategies into the learning 
process of cognitive robots can result in the creation of a new 
function 𝑇′: 𝑃 ×  𝐶𝑅 ×  𝐾 ×  𝑀𝑇 →  𝑆, where the set 𝑀𝑇 
represents the collection of metacognitive strategies that are 
integrated into the learning process of cognitive robots to 
enhance their ability to transfer knowledge and skills from one 
problem situation to another. These strategies are aimed at 
improving the cognitive abilities, self-awareness, and 
adaptability of the robots. The strategies in 𝑀𝑇 may include 
techniques such as monitoring, planning, reflection, and 
evaluation of their own learning processes. Incorporating

these metacognitive strategies into the learning process of 
cognitive robots can help them to better understand their own 
learning processes, evaluate their performance, and adapt to 
new problem situations. This, in turn, can result in more 
effective knowledge transfer and performance. The function 
𝑇′ considers the self-awareness, adaptability, and cognitive 
abilities of cognitive robots, which are improved with the 
integration of metacognitive strategies. 
Measuring the success rate of the transfer of knowledge 
and skills between different problem situations is a method to 
evaluate the effectiveness of 𝑇′. 
The performance of cognitive robots with and without 
metacognitive strategies can be compared to determine the 
impact of these strategies on knowledge transfer and 
performance. 
B. CRwMS Ontology 
The development of ontologies has become a crucial 
component in the design and implementation of cognitive 
robots with metacognitive strategies. With the increasing 
interest in the potential benefits of metacognition for 
knowledge transfer and learning in robots, the need for a 
comprehensive ontology that accurately represents the 
relevant concepts and relationships involved in cognitive 
robotics has become more pressing. In this section, an 
ontology called "Cognitive Robotics with Metacognitive 
Strategies" (CRwMS) is introduced to address this need, 
which represents various aspects of the cognitive robot, such 
as its knowledge and skills, problem situations, and 
metacognitive strategies. The CRwMS ontology provides a 
framework for researchers and developers to ensure that 
cognitive robots possess the necessary knowledge and 
strategies to transfer knowledge and learn effectively. 
 The formal specification provides a precise and rigorous 
representation of the model's structure and behavior, ensuring 
clarity and consistency in its implementation. The ontology 
serves as a conceptual framework for capturing and 
organizing the relevant knowledge and relationships involved 
in the knowledge transfer process.

The CRwMS Ontology was developed using the version 
5.5.0 of Protégé, a popular open-source ontology editor and 
knowledge management system. Protégé provides a user-
friendly interface for creating, editing, and visualizing 
ontologies. 
IV. 
EVALUATION 
Ontology evaluation is a crucial step in ensuring the 
quality and usability of ontologies. In this section, three 
methods for evaluating ontologies will be presented: expert 
evaluation, knowledge graph-based evaluation, and case 
study-based evaluation. 
A. Expert evaluation 
The evaluation process involved engaging domain experts 
with expertise in cognitive robotics, metacognition, artificial 
intelligence, 
knowledge 
representation, 
and 
ontology 
engineering. Five experts from the fields of Cognitive 
Robotics, Metacognition, Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge 
Representation, and Ontology Engineering evaluated the 
CRwMS Ontology overall. The evaluation experts were 
selected based on their research contributions and expertise in 
the relevant fields. Confidentiality and ethical considerations 
were ensured, and the experts were provided with the 
necessary information and resources to conduct their 
evaluation. The evaluation experts were given access to the 
developed ontology, CRwMS, which represented the concepts 
and relationships involved in cognitive robotics with 
metacognitive strategies. They were asked to review the 
ontology and provide feedback on its design, completeness, 
consistency, and suitability for representing the relevant 
domain. The evaluation experts were encouraged to critically 
analyze the ontology, identifying any potential gaps, 
inconsistencies, or areas for improvement. They were also 
asked to assess the ontology's effectiveness in capturing the 
essential components of cognitive robots, knowledge and 
skills, problem situations, and metacognitive strategies. The 
evaluation 
process 
included 
various 
modes 
of 
communication, such as email exchanges, virtual meetings, or 
workshops, depending on the availability and preferences of 
the experts. The feedback and insights provided by the 
evaluation experts were carefully analyzed and considered.  
The expert in cognitive robotics evaluated the 
representation of CognitiveRobot class and its relationships 
with other classes and found it to be accurately represented in 
the ontology. The expert in Metacognition evaluated the 
representation of the MetacognitiveStrategy class and its 
relationships with other classes and found the ontology to 
accurately represent the metacognitive strategies used to 
enhance knowledge transfer. 
The expert in artificial intelligence evaluated the 
consistency and completeness of the ontology and found it to 
accurately represent the concepts and relationships involved 
in artificial intelligence and cognitive robotics. The expert in 
Knowledge 
Representation 
evaluated 
the 
ontology's 
representation of the knowledge and skills that a 
CognitiveRobot obtains in different problem situations and 
found it to be well-represented in the ontology. 
The expert in Ontology Engineering evaluated the 
ontology's adherence to ontology design principles and found 
the ontology to follow best practices in ontology engineering. 
They also found the ontology to be usable and compatible with 
other ontologies and systems. 
The evaluation results indicate that the CRwMS ontology 
represents the key concepts and relationships involved in 
cognitive robotics and metacognitive strategies accurately and 
robustly. The five experts from diverse fields of expertise 
evaluated and confirmed its reliability and validity, making it 
a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in 
artificial intelligence, cognitive robotics, and knowledge 
representation. 
B. Knowledge graph-based evaluation 
Integrating the ontology into a knowledge graph and 
calculating various metrics such as the number of nodes, 
edges, and triples are methods used to measure the 
completeness and accuracy of knowledge graph-based 
evaluation. The knowledge graph can be queried to evaluate 
the ontology's consistency.  and then use reasoning to check if 
the graph is consistent and conforms to the intended meaning 
of the ontology.  The rdflib library in Python is used for this. 
the Figure 1 shows a partial view of the knowledge graph. 
 
 
Figure  1. Knowledge graph based on CRwMS Ontology 
The results of the validation with graph showed that the 
CRwMS ontology is a well-formed and logically coherent 
representation of the concepts and relationships related to 
cognitive robots, their knowledge and skills, problem 
situations, solutions, and metacognitive strategies. The 
ontology provides a clear and structured framework for 
modeling and analyzing the impact of metacognitive 
strategies on knowledge transfer and performance in cognitive 
robots. The ontology includes a set of classes and properties 
that allow for the representation of the different components 
of the domain, such as the CognitiveRobot class, the 
KnowledgeSkill class, the ProblemSituation class, the 
Solution class, and the MetacognitiveStrategy class, among 
others. The ontology also includes a set of axioms and rules

that ensure the consistency and coherence of the ontology, 
allowing for the inference of new knowledge and the 
validation of existing knowledge. the results indicate that 
CRwMS ontology provides a robust and reliable tool for 
conducting simulation studies and evaluating the impact of 
metacognitive strategies on knowledge transfer and 
performance in cognitive robots. 
C. 
Case study-based evaluation 
In a simulated cognitive robot study, the effectiveness of 
metacognitive strategies in improving knowledge transfer and 
performance is being tested. Two groups of 10 robots have 
been 
randomly 
assigned: 
one 
group 
will 
receive 
metacognitive training, while the other group will not. 
The task given to both groups is to solve a series of five 
object recognition problem where the robots have to identify 
and classify different objects based on their shape, size, and 
color in a virtual environment, and after each problem, the 
success rate and transfer knowledge rate of each group is 
recorded.   
The problem representation using the ontology is 
formalized as follows: 
 
---Classes: 
o 
𝐶𝑜𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑅𝑜𝑏𝑜𝑡: represents a robot with cognitive 
capabilities. 
o 
𝑀𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑐𝑜𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑅𝑜𝑏𝑜𝑡:
 represents 
a 
𝐶𝑜𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑅𝑜𝑏𝑜𝑡  that has been trained with 
metacognitive strategies. 
o 
𝑂𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑚: represents a problem 
where robots must identify and classify different 
objects based on their shape, size, and color. 
o 
𝐼𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑆𝑒𝑡: represents a set of initial object 
recognition problems. 
o 
𝑁𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑆𝑒𝑡: represents a set of new object 
recognition problems. 
o 
𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛:  represents a solution to a 
problem. 
 
---Properties: 
o 
ℎ𝑎𝑠𝐼𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑆𝑒𝑡: relates a 𝐶𝑜𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑅𝑜𝑏𝑜𝑡 
to an 𝐼𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑆𝑒𝑡. 
o 
ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑁𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑆𝑒𝑡: relates a 𝐶𝑜𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑅𝑜𝑏𝑜𝑡 to 
a 𝑁𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑆𝑒𝑡. 
o 
ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛: relates a 𝐶𝑜𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑅𝑜𝑏𝑜𝑡 
to a 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛. 
o 
ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑆𝑢𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒: relates a 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 to a 
success rate value. 
o 
ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑓𝑒𝑟𝐾𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑙𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒:

a 
𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛  to a transfer knowledge rate 
value. 
o

 relates 
a 
𝐶𝑜𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑅𝑜𝑏𝑜𝑡 to a 𝑀𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑐𝑜𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑅𝑜𝑏𝑜𝑡. 
 
---Axioms: 
 
𝑀𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑐𝑜𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑅𝑜𝑏𝑜𝑡 ⊑ 𝐶𝑜𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑅𝑜𝑏𝑜𝑡 
ℎ𝑎𝑠𝐼𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑆𝑒𝑡 ∘  ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑁𝑒𝑤𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑆𝑒𝑡 ⊑  ⊥ 
ℎ𝑎𝑠𝐼𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑆𝑒𝑡 ∘  ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 ⊑  ⊥

This ontology allows for the representation of the different 
concepts and relationships involved in the problem, such as 
the cognitive robots, the object recognition problems, and the 
use of metacognitive strategies. The use of axioms ensures 
that the ontology is consistent and that the relationships 
between the classes and properties are accurately represented. 
To validate the effectiveness of the metacognitive 
strategies in improving knowledge transfer for cognitive 
robots, two tests were implemented: success rate and transfer 
knowledge rate. The success rate test was designed to measure 
the ability of the cognitive robots to solve a series of new 
problems after being trained on a set of initial problems with 
and without the use of metacognitive strategies. Success rate 
refers to the percentage of robots in each group that 
successfully solved the problem.

Success rate test 
 
According to the Figure 2, in the first problem situation, 
the success rate of the group trained with metacognitive 
strategies was 80%, while the success rate of the group 
without metacognitive training was only 50%. The subsequent 
problem situations will show how the success rates of the two 
groups compare and whether there is a significant difference 
between them.

metacognitive strategies

effectiveness of metacognitive strategies in improving 
knowledge transfer and performance in cognitive robots.

Transfer knowledge rate test 
 
 The robots were tested on their ability to transfer their 
knowledge and skills to solve new problems in the virtual 
environment. 
The effectiveness of the metacognitive strategies was 
evaluated by measuring the success rate of the transfer of

knowledge and skills between different problem situations.   
The impact of metacognitive strategies on knowledge transfer 
and overall performance was determined comparing the 
performance of the two groups of robots. 
After conducting a series of tests, the cognitive robots 
utilizing metacognitive strategies demonstrated a higher 
success rate in transferring their knowledge and skills to new 
problem situations compared to the group of robots that did 
not employ metacognitive strategies. In particular, the group 
of robots using metacognitive strategies achieved an average 
success rate of 85% in solving new problems, while the group 
without metacognitive strategies achieved an average success 
rate of only 65%. These results suggest that the integration of 
metacognitive strategies has a significant positive impact on 
the ability of cognitive robots to transfer knowledge and 
improve their overall performance. 
The simulated environment was developed using Python 
3.10.0, a programming language widely used in scientific 
computing, 
data 
analysis, 
and 
artificial 
intelligence 
applications. 
V. DISCUSSION 
This study aimed to explore the role of metacognition in 
knowledge transfer for cognitive robots. The findings 
demonstrate that integrating metacognitive strategies into the 
cognitive architecture of robots can enhance their ability to 
transfer knowledge effectively. The discussion highlighted 
several key factors contributing to the improvement, including 
the assessment of knowledge and skills, self-regulation of 
learning processes, and the ability to generalize knowledge to 
new problem situations. 
These findings align with previous research in the field of 
metacognition and knowledge transfer in humans [22] [23]. 
Studies conducted on human learners have shown that 
metacognitive strategies enhance learning outcomes and 
improve problem-solving skills. The similarities between 
human and cognitive robot behavior suggest that similar 
principles apply to both domains. This study reinforces the 
potential of metacognitive strategies in enhancing knowledge 
transfer for cognitive robots by leveraging insights from 
human metacognition research. 
Additionally, this study contributes to the existing body of 
literature on cognitive robotics and metacognition. While 
there is a growing interest in integrating metacognitive 
capabilities into robotic systems, limited research has been 
conducted specifically on knowledge transfer in cognitive 
robots through metacognitive strategies. This study expands 
our understanding of how metacognition can benefit cognitive 
robots and paves the way for future investigations in this area 
by addressing this research gap. 
It is worth noting that there are still challenges and 
limitations to be addressed. Similar to other studies 
[2][3][18][21], the development of robust metacognitive 
frameworks for cognitive robots remains a challenge. 
Additionally, scalability and generalizability of metacognitive 
strategies across different domains and tasks need further 
exploration [19]. These challenges indicate areas for future 
research and emphasize the need for ongoing efforts to refine 
and optimize metacognitive approaches in the context of 
cognitive robotics. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
Based on the results of the validation process, it can be 
concluded that the CRwMS Ontology provides a robust and 
reliable representation of the key concepts and relationships 
involved in cognitive robotics and metacognitive strategies. 
The ontology offers a clear and structured framework for 
modeling and analyzing the impact of metacognitive 
strategies on knowledge transfer and performance in cognitive 
robots. 
The validation using graph analysis showed that the 
CRwMS Ontology accurately represents the concepts and 
relationships related to cognitive robots, their knowledge and 
skills, problem situations, solutions, and metacognitive 
strategies. This ontology provides a structured and clear 
framework for analyzing and modeling the impact of 
metacognitive strategies on knowledge transfer and 
performance in cognitive robots. 
Expert validation confirmed the reliability and validity of 
the ontology, making it a valuable resource for researchers and 
practitioners in artificial intelligence, cognitive robotics, and 
knowledge representation. The positive evaluation results 
from five experts with diverse fields of expertise add further 
evidence to the robustness of the ontology. 
This 
research 
demonstrates 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
metacognitive strategies in improving knowledge transfer and 
performance in cognitive robots. The CRwMS Ontology 
provides a solid foundation for further exploration of these 
concepts and relationships. Future research in this area may 
lead to the development of more advanced and efficient 
cognitive robots. 
While this study provides valuable insights into the role of 
metacognition in knowledge transfer for cognitive robots, 
there are certain limitations, boundaries, and constraints that 
should be acknowledged: 
o 
Simulated Environment: The experiments conducted 
in this study were performed within a simulated 
virtual environment. While this allows for controlled 
testing and data collection, it is essential to recognize 
that the outcomes observed in a simulated setting may 
not fully reflect real-world scenarios. The application 
of metacognitive strategies in physical environments 
may present additional challenges and complexities. 
o 
Human Factor: While the study focuses on 
knowledge transfer in cognitive robots, the role of 
human involvement cannot be disregarded. Human 
interaction, guidance, and supervision may influence 
the effectiveness of metacognitive strategies in 
robots. Future research should explore the interplay 
between human and robot collaboration in the context 
of metacognition and knowledge transfer.
