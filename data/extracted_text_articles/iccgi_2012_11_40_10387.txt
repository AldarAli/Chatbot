Abstract — The enterprise of the years 2000 are facing 
competition in various fronts, like reduction of product life 
time, increase of diversification, reduction of customer 
response time, competition internationalization. Due to those 
factors, it became necessary to reach a higher degree of 
relationship between the enterprise and suppliers network and 
customers networks, avoid unnecessary costs and response 
time between then. Besides that, the utilization of automation is 
not necessarily done with balanced criteria, creating isles of 
excellence divorced from the rest of organization. The paper 
proposes a integration model of the Extended Enterprise that 
associates automation growth with business process model of 
the organization in order to create an integration environment 
that will minimize the application, maintaining the information 
flows as balanced as possible. The integration status is 
obtained applying the same level of automation in the various 
activities of the business processes, measured through 
automation indexes, resulting in a model which levels of 
integration of the Extended Enterprise and discussed in a 
holistic mode. 
Keywords - Extended Enterprise; Automation Index;

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES 
In this century, companies are facing changes due to the 
competition and so a need of fast response previewing the 
clients’ demands is quite mandatory. Besides to focusing on 
the customer, it is also important to establish partnerships 
with suppliers and create strategic alliances in order to 
increase business agility and reliability and to meet market 
needs. However, fast responsiveness requires changes in 
both internal and external processes mainly with respect to 
the relationship with customers and suppliers. In this context, 
the concept of the Extended Enterprise arises. 
Extended Enterprise need new ways of organization and 
collaborative management, providing them an integration 
status of their internal and external activities. It was a 
thought, mainly in the 90s, that this integration status could 
be achieved through massive application of Information 
Technology 
resources. 
Although 
the 
promise 
that 
Information Communication Technology (ICT) would 
connect 
people, 
processes 
and 
information, 
current 
implementations are strongly document-oriented, and the 
difficulties of integration between companies remain [1]. 
Nevertheless, the use of Information Systems is a key 
success factor, since they have potential to integrate business 
processes inside the company and between related suppliers 
and customers. 
The extended enterprise can be seen as an evolution of 
the Integrated Supply Chain, because all interrelationships 
are based on rules and contracts, and nave as principle, that 
everyone should win whith the transactions, sharing 
equivalently all the gains and risks of the business, and this 
success depends on the collective performance rather than 
isolated parts. To this purpose it is important to manage all 
the interfaces between organization, consumers and 
suppliers, in order to ensure a synchronized supply for all 
the supply chain. 
Integration of the Manufacturing System is a prerequisite 
to obtain the attributes of competitiveness, i.e., leadership 
and responsiveness. The Business System integration 
represents an organization state, reflected in the ability to 
move information synergistically between their process and 
activities [2].  
The business processes integration and the information 
technology has been one of the key factors for a successful 
execution of an integrated enterprise system [3]. 
The objective of this paper is to propose a conceptual 
integration model for the extended enterprise. The 
integration model will be based on automation application, 
through the utilization of automation indexes.  
This paper is structured as follows. In Section II, the 
literature review will be present. In Section III the 
automation indexes definition will be discussed. In section 
IV the proposition of the extended enterprise integration 
model is expanded. Section V presents the possible 
configuration for the extended enterprise integration model 
and in Section VI focuses the conclusions.

LITERATURE REVIEW 
In order to contextualize the Extended Enterprise and the 
Integration model, it will be presented a review of the main 
concepts of Collaborative Network, Extended Enterprise, 
Supply Chain, Business Process, application of automation 
and definition of Automation Indexes. 
Collaborative Network is “a network consisting of a 
variety 
of 
entities 
that 
are 
largely 
autonomous, 
geographically distributed, and heterogeneous in terms of 
243

their operating environment, culture, social capital and 
goals” [4]. 
The concept of Extended Enterprise emerged at the same 
time as other concepts that emphasize the inter-
organizational collaboration such as: virtual enterprise, 
supply chain and enterprise network [5]. It refers to the 
collaborative relationship between supply chain members, 
from which buyers and sellers obtain a competitive 
advantage and achieve higher customer satisfaction against 
other supply chains [6]. The extended enterprise is an 
evolution of the integrated supply chain and can be 
considered as a complete set of collaborative companies, 
both upstream and downstream, from raw material to the 
final consumer, working together to bring value to the 
market. The advantages of the Extended Enterprise derive 
from the ability of companies to use their full network of 
suppliers, vendors, customers and clients [5]. The extended 
enterprise may also be defined as: “A conceptual business 
unit or system that consists of a purchasing company and 
suppliers, who collaborate closely so as to maximize the 
returns to each partner”. The extended enterprise is a 
philosophy where member organizations (EE actors) 
strategically 
combine 
their 
core 
competencies 
and 
capabilities to create a unique competency [7].  
According to [4], extended enterprise represents a 
concept typically applied to an organization in which a 
dominant enterprise ‘‘extends” its boundaries to all or some 
of its suppliers. An extended enterprise can be seen as a 
particular case of a virtual enterprise. 
During the two last decades, there was a fast growth of 
the 
inter-organizational 
collaboration. 
Managers 
and 
academic researchers representing different areas, as diverse 
as marketing, economics, marketing, economy strategy and 
sociology, have carefully studied the inter-organizational 
network, joint-ventures, coalitions, extended enterprise, 
partnerships and alliances [5]. In an extended enterprise, 
which usually involves complex supply chains, the main 
concern is related to the integration of all members of the 
supplier and distribution chains, which share a common goal - 
to obtain a market share through the product realization [8]. 
In the XXI century, it is expected that the competition 
will occur between value chains effectively integrated into 
their competences and resources, in order to compete in a 
global economy [7]. The extended enterprise also reflects the 
high level of interdependence between organizations and 
how to conduct businesses [9]. There are similarities 
between value chain, supply chain and extended enterprise. 
At low-levels of integration there are no major differences. 
The differences emerge when the level of integration and 
collaboration increase [6]. Managers and researchers 
recognize that there is a critical interdependence between 
companies, customers, investors and communities. Such 
dependence cannot be described only on the basis of a 
contractual exchange because it involves interactions and 
network effects. The effective management of the extended 
enterprise requires both a concept and a approach to practical 
issues that emerged in this scenario [10]. The Council of 
Supply Chain Management Professional (CSCMP) considers 
that: “Supply chain as encompasses the planning and 
management of all activities. Importantly, it also includes 
coordination and collaboration with partners, which can be 
suppliers, intermediaries, third party service providers, and 
customers” [11]. This is the definition adopted for the 
present work. 
The Association for Operations Management (APICS), 
has the following definition for supply chain management 
[12]: “The design, planning, execution, control, and 
monitoring of supply chain activities with the objective of 
creating net value, building a competitive infrastructure, 
leveraging worldwide logistics, synchronizing supply with 
demand, and measuring performance globally”. 
Companies need access to accurate information in real 
time in order to meet the growing challenges of globalization 
and the reduction in the product life cycle. To a large extent, 
especially in the last two decades, the use of information 
technology, mainly based on Enterprise Application Systems 
(EAS), have allowed companies to respond effectively to the 
dynamic changes in business [13]. In that sense, it is 
reasonable to say that information technology is the key to 
the integration of the extended enterprise. Along with 
business process reengineering, strategic alliances and 
management changes, IT can be deployed to enable the 
planning, control, integration of decisions, information 
integration and integration of business processes, which may 
allow companies to operate in the extended enterprise as if it 
were a single company [6]. 
Business process management (BPM) is seen as both an 
IT development, as well as an implementation of quality 
management, being knowledge and information key factors 
for its success [14]. According to [14], business processes 
constitute a “systemic approach to design and continuously 
improve the organizational processes, by potentialized 
people and team work, combining emergent technological 
competences and under a philosophical stance for quality, 
aimed at delivering value to customers”. Also, according to 
[2], a business process is a set of activities, logically ordered 
according to precedence rules. The activities and were 
developed from the definition of manufacturing as a system 
which can be interpreted as the composition of all business 
processes and activities.  
Business process management is an integral part of 
today's enterprises, in particular those related to e-business, 
because the efficiency and effectiveness of the underlying 
business processes have become a major source of 
competitive advantage of companies. The process design is 
the foundation and a critical component of BPM, where new 
business processes are developed to meet the needs of 
business problems or existing processes are reviewed to 
improve company performance [15].  
Enterprise integration is the process of ensuring the 
interaction between enterprise entities necessary to achieve 
domain objectives. Enterprise integration can be approached 
in various manners and at various levels as - (i) physical 
integration, (ii) application integration and (iii) business 
integration [16]. 
As a consequence of changes in the competitive 
environment and marketplaces, in the middle of ‘90s the EE 
model 
started 
to be analyzed 
in the engineering

III. 
AUTOMATION INDEX APPLIED TO BUSINESS SYSTEM 
Automation, when seen as an available technology 
provides mean for the information flow in each activity of 
the automation system. In this research the programmable 
automation is used. Automation is programmable when the 
human attribute is substituted by the computer program [2]. 
The automation index developed by [2], applied to 
quantify automation, is defined as follows:
 
 
T
A
A
n
i  n
 
where: 
Ai  = automation index 
= number of human activities replaced by devices or 
instruments with an automation concept 
nT = total number of activities performed by humans 
 
It can be argued that



Ai
, with the boundaries 
limits:  
iA = 0  - all activities are performed by humans  
iA  = 1 - all activities performed by humans are replaced by 
automation devices, 
This definition of automation index is applied to a 
Business System [2], whose model is shown in Figure 1, 
considering the main business processes grouped in four 
groups - Engineering, Shop Floor, Support and Commercial. 
To facilitate understanding, each group is broken in sub group 
of business processes, as shown in Figure 1. It is considered 
that information flows inside each group through the activities 
of the correspondent business processes, and outside the 
groups, performing the links between the four groups 
themselves.

The automation index for each group and subgroup of 
business processes will vary as follows:

Each block of process and activities can be represented 
by a three axles diagram, with the automation index iA 
varying from 0 to 1 at each one of the axles. Taking in 
account the automation indexes, it is defined [2] that the 
business systems will have structural integration if the 
automation index iA is approximately the same in numerical 
terms, for each one of the business process groups and sub 
groups. Automation indexes with approximately the same 
numerical values mean the information flow with the same 
technological degree of automation; consequently with the 
same interfaces, facilitating the synergies the exchange 
information flow between the activities. The level of 
organization maintains coherence with the degree of 
automation for each architecture.  
The four blocks of activities, associating the approximate 
numerical values of iA for the twelve axles is shown in 
Figure 2. This Figure is shows, one condition of structural 
integration of high the business system.

 INTEGRATION MODEL ASSOCIATED TO AUTOMATION 
INDEXES APPLIED TO THE EXTENDED ENTERPRISE 
A. Integration Model definition 
Integration of the Business System is a prerequisite to 
obtain the attributes of competitiveness, such as innovation 
and responsiveness. This article proposes a integration 
definition, by which the Business System integration 
represents an organizational state, reflected in the ability to 
move information synergistically between their activities and 
sub activities [2]. The information will flow synergistically if 
the level of automation of the several activities of the 
Business System is approximately the same in the activities 
of the Business System. The level of automation will be 
measured by the automation indexes. 
Total Structural Integration Manufacturing System is 
achieved when it provides harmonic growth of automation, 
with approximately the same rate in the coordinate axles as 
shown in Figure 2. One can defined harmonic growth of 
automation if the indexes iA increases simultaneously their 
numeric value at the same rate in the three activities axles 
[2]. 
Harmonic growth of automation, measured by their 
indexes, as well as ensure structural integration in various 
manufacturing system architectures, provides important

strategic tool to obtain the attributes of competitiveness [2]. 
B. Business Processes in the Extended Enterprise 
As shown in Figure 1, the block of the business system 
processes that interfaces with customers and suppliers is the 
Commercial one, deployed in the sub-set of business process 
of Planning that interfaces with the Shop Floor business 
processes.  
Each one of the Supplier and Customer set of business 
processes can be associated to the Business System model 
shown in Figure 1, as each one represents a Company or 
Organization, so can be represented according to Figure 3.  
Extracting from model in Figure 1 adopts the commercial 
set of process as link with suppliers, customers business 
process as Figure 3.

Source: Based [2] 
 
a) Commercial – Set of processes that interfaces with 
both customers and suppliers. It is the place in which the 
product is assembled and finished so that it can reach the 
final consumer, through final distribution. 
b) Suppliers - Set of business processes that supplies 
raw material and finished parts to the Organization. The set 
of all suppliers of the constitutes the supply chain network. 
Among the suppliers, there are those with high level of 
automation and integration and those with near-zero 
automation and low integration. 
c) Customers - Set of business processes that allow the 
Organization market to sell its products, and include the 
final consumer, chain stores, wholesalers, retailers, utilities, 
etc. The set of all customers forms the customer network. 
As in the supply chain network, the automation and 
integration rates vary among customers. The customer 
network is responsible for distributing the finished product 
and deliver it to the consumer. 
After the conceptualization of enterprise integration 
model using automation indexes [2], the same concepts will 
now be applied to the extended enterprise. In order to 
perform these concepts, the extended enterprise model will 
be those from the Figure 3, where the Commercial will 
interface with the suppliers and customers network. The 
determination of the extended enterprise model will use the 
integration concepts developed in [2]. So, the application of 
automation in the organization business process can be 
classified in three different discrete points, as shown in 
Figure 4, represented by the three-orthogonal axles of 
marketing, supply and planning. 
 
Automation indexes tend to 0.33, meaning mostly 
manual activities and use of paper lists; 
 
Automation indexes tend to 0.66, meaning mostly 
usage of individual computers without a network 
connection, running individual software, without 
integration between them. 
 
Automation indexes tend to 1, meaning mostly usage 
of integrated business systems, such as Enterprise 
Resource Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship 
Management (CRM), Supply Chain Management 
(SCM), 
Engineering 
software, 
Manufacturing 
Execution Systems (MES), etc., running in distributed 
environment, connecting mid range computers and 
data storages.

C. Proposal of Extended Enterprise Integration Model 
The proposal of Extended Enterprise Integration Model 
associated with automation index achieves its excellence 
when the three activities – supply, marketing and planning – 
are in the approximate automation index level and in both 
internal and external business process of the organization. 
To exemplify the integration concept using the 
automation index harmonic growth see Figure 5. Assuming 
that the suppliers and customers have the same structural 
model, the integration of the extended enterprise can be 
obtained when the automation indexes of the commercial, 
supplier and customer business processes have automation 
approximately the same automation index values.

POSSIBLE CONFIGURATIONS FOR EXTENDED 
ENTERPRISE INTEGRATION MODEL 
A. Low integration of extended enterprise and among 
Commercial, Suppliers and Customers  
Where Commercial Business is without integration due 
to high values for iCP and low values for ICS and iCP, Supplier 
without integration due to high values of iSM and iSP and low

values of iSS, and customers without integration due to high 
values of iCS and iCM and low values for iCP. Figure 8 shows 
the plan representation for this condition where dashed lines 
represent the integration level between activities and the 
continuous lines represent the integration level between 
companies.

B. High integration of Commercial processes, but low 
integration with Customers and Suppliers. 
The situation in which there is integration among the 
activities of each company is describe in Figure 9, but there 
is no transorganizational integration in the extended 
enterprise taking in account that each organization has the 
same numerical values for each axle but they are not the 
same for the three companies.

Figure 9 - Integration inside the companies, but without transorganizational 
integration. 
The Commercial processes have integration between the 
set of activities with automation indexes close to 1, but the 
customers, even though present internal integration, have 
low values of automation indexes which does not allow 
integration with the Commercial processes. It is the same 
situation with the supplier: even though this supplier is 
internally integrated, it presents a medium automation index, 
and does not reach integration with the Commercial 
processes. In this case, the Commercial provide resources 
that cannot be shared with customers and suppliers. So, there 
are situations where there are unequal investments in 
Information Technology. In this configuration, the Company 
acquired an ERP system but still uses tables and lists to 
communicate with customers and suppliers, e.g., via Fax.  
Besides the usage of ERP system, the company still uses 
tables and lists to communicate with customers and 
suppliers, e.g., via Fax. On the other hand, the customer 
employs a manual planning but has a CRM to communicate 
with clients and a SCM to communicate with suppliers. In 
addition to that, the supplier has an ERP system, uses CRM 
with its Customers but communicates with its suppliers 
manually, and in this configuration does not use information 
systems with their customers. 
C. Extended enterprise with total structural integration  
This configuration is the best situation for the extended 
enterprise: there are three situations, as shown in Figure 10, 
where all extended enterprise has the approximately same 
automation index, both inside the companies and between 
companies. There are three automaation situations - high (iA 
= 1), medium (iA = 0,67) and low (iA = 0,33) integration.

CONCLUSIONS 
The proposal of an Extended Enterprise Model with 
characteristics of integrating the enterprise itself, its 
customers and suppliers was presented. The integration is 
obtained through the application of automation indexes with 
approximately the same numerical value in the nine axles. 
The integration concept developed in this paper is based 
upon equivalent numerical values of the automation indexes 
that will facilitate the information flow, due to the fact that,

with equivalent numerical values of the automation, the 
information exchange interfaces have the same nature and 
technology. 
This concept of integration applied to the frame - 
Commercial, Supply Chain and Customers networks 
presents an extended enterprise architeture that will enable 
the supply chain and customers network to operate in 
optimal conditions, diminishing the response time and 
saving resources. 
The application of this research will be made in an 
automotive extended enterprise.
