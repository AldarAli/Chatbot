Abstract 
 
To find desired information by mobile phones, it is 
necessary to set search keywords easily and to explore 
a search if a user’s information needs are not well 
defined. We propose an information navigation method 
to help users successfully find information by mobile 
phones. Our proposed method presents users a focus 
facet by analyzing the context about contents, users, 
and dialogs. The focus facet is presented each time 
users refine a search. They can select a keyword from 
the facet, check the search results, and then define 
their ambiguous needs through interaction. We 
compared our method with traditional search methods. 
InfoCruise effectively discovers desired information, 
because its discovery rate and the satisfaction rating 
are higher than those of the traditional search methods. 
InfoCruise efficiently searches, because both the 
keyword correction rate and the number of times users 
changed facets in it are lower than those in traditional 
search methods.

1. Introduction 
 
With the spread of the Internet, a great deal of 
information about products or shops has become 
available online that people can locate by search 
systems, not only by PCs but also by mobile phones. 
For example, when a user wants to go out to eat, he 
might search for an appropriate restaurant by mobile 
phone. But several problems exist with mobile 
searches. First, since the user’s search purpose is often 
ambiguous, he can’t search well. When searching for a 
restaurant, many users don’t know its name or fail to 
stumble upon the right search word. The second 
problem is the constraints of mobile devices. Users 
have difficulty viewing long lists of search results on 
the small screens of mobile phones. They might also 
feel annoyed by repeatedly setting and changing search 
keywords because a mobile phone’s communication 
speed is low.  
Faceted navigation is a solution when a user’s 
search purpose is ambiguous [2], [3], [4], [5]. This 
search method uses the metadata of information. 
Metadata have several facets, which are attributes in 
various orthogonal sets of categories. Faceted 
navigation displays the aspects of a current results set, 
so users can switch easily between searching and 
browsing. It also only shows the populated facets when 
users drill down search results by facet. So, users can 
explore search results without dead-ends. Faceted 
navigation is a good search method when a user’s 
search purpose is ambiguous, because users can 
combine querying and browsing to clarify their 
purposes 
and 
find 
information. 
Most 
faceted 
navigation systems show all facets and many facet 
values on a PC screen. They need a wide screen area. 
But since mobile phones have small screens, showing 
all facets, such as current faceted navigation systems 
do, seems difficult. 
As 
a 
solution, 
we 
propose 
InfoCruise, 
an 
information 
navigation 
method 
to 
help 
users 
successfully find information by mobile phones [1]. 
We support searches on small screens and when the 
search purpose is ambiguous. Our proposed method 
calculates the priority of facets by analyzing the 
context about contents, users, and dialogs and presents 
keywords in a focus facet each time a search is refined. 
The contents of this paper are organized as follows. 
Section 2 describes the kinds of contexts as factors that 
affect the priority of facets. Section 3 describes our 
navigation method’s overview, and Section 4 describes 
our application system to search for restaurants. 
Section 5 describes a user study in which we evaluated 
our method’s effectiveness and efficiency. Section 6 
discusses the results of a user study, Section 7 
describes related works, and Section 8 provides a 
conclusion.

2. Focus facet determined by context 
 
Information has many attributes, and leveraging 
metadata for searching has received attention in recent 
years. Hearst et al. [4], [6] used metadata (facets and 
facet values) as a tool to guide users in formulating 
queries. Their interface uses metadata in a manner that 
allows users to both refine and expand the query. 
Users select some facets and decide facet values for 
their demand to search. But it seems difficult to show 
many facets on a mobile phone with a small screen, so 
deciding on a focus facet among all facets is crucial. 
We propose to select and present a focus facet based 
on the user context. The following three kinds of 
contexts as factors affect the priority of facets: contents, 
users, and dialogs.  
 
2.1. Context about contents 
 
The context about contents affects which facet will 
be focused on. One reason why formulating queries is 
difficult is a lack of knowledge about target 
information [7]. It is important for users to know 
characteristics of target information. We think 
characteristics of target information are the content 
distribution about various data attributes. For example, 
when a user finds a restaurant, which facet is important 
among style, price, or location depends on the content 
distribution of these attributes. If most of the 
restaurants around a certain location are Chinese (he 
might be in a Chinatown), the user should learn that 
Chinese is the major type of restaurant nearby. In that 
case, the user would rather search by the “style” facet 
first than by another facet. 
We calculate the priority of facets using the content 
distribution of each facet.  
 
2.2. Context about users 
 
The context about the circumstances around users 
also affects which facet will be focused on. For 
example, when a user wants to find a restaurant around 
him, the “location” facet is important. If a user wants 
to find a restaurant at midnight, he would search for 
restaurants using “open time” first. When a user wants 
to find a restaurant while he is driving, he would 
search using “parking” first. If a user can search for 
restaurants with the facet that suits the user’s context, 
he can find restaurants efficiently. 
We prioritize the facet associated with user context. 
If we relate the “location” facet with the current 
position and the system detects a user’s current 
position, the system prioritizes the “location” facet. We 
can relate the “open time” facet with the current time 
and the “parking” facet with the means of 
transportation.  
 
2.3. Context about dialog 
 
Context about dialog history also affects which 
facet will be focused on. If a user can’t find the desired 
information on the first search, using a different facet 
from the first search might prove successful. For 
example, if a user can’t find a good “Chinese” or 
“Japanese” restaurant using a “style” facet, she might 
have success using another facet such as “atmosphere” 
because she can change her aspect. We believe that 
context about dialog history, which means when a 
facet was used, is important for searching.  
Instead of prioritizing the facet just used, we 
prioritize another appropriate facet. However, the 
priority of a facet used before gradually increases each 
time a user refines a search. 
 
 
3. Navigation architecture overview 
 
InfoCruise handles the information structure when 
contents have values in various orthogonal sets of 
categories. Fig. 1 shows an example where a restaurant 
has facet values in style, atmosphere, and parking 
facets. InfoCruise selects a focus facet among all facets 
and shows facet values as search keywords about the 
targeted information. InfoCruise also shows a dialog 
that explains why the facet and facet values were 
chosen.  
Figure 2 shows the navigation architecture of 
InfoCruise. The system generates search keywords and 
dialogs in the following steps. The first step calculates 
the priority of facets by analyzing the context of the 
contents, users, and dialogs. In particular, the 
evaluated value of each facet is calculated using three

contexts, and all facets are ranked by the evaluated 
values. The rule for the calculation of the priority of 
facets is defined as the “search strategy.” The second 
step selects facet values from the highest priority facet. 
The third step generates a dialog.  
When a user selects a search keyword, the system 
refines the contents using that search keyword and 
generates new search keywords and dialogs for the 
search results once again. The contexts about the 
contents are updated using the refined content 
distribution of each facet, and the contexts about the 
dialogs are updated using the most recent history.  
InfoCruise iteratively generates a focus facet and 
facet values as search keywords for the targeted 
information. Users can select desired search keywords, 
check the search results, and then define any 
ambiguous needs through interaction. 
Our navigation architecture can define plural search 
strategies for some situations in an application. If users 
feel that the proposed search keywords aren’t suitable, 
they can change the search strategy and select other 
search keywords.  
 
4. Application system by mobile phone 
 
To search for restaurants, we developed an 
application system composed of a server and a client. 
The client is a mobile phone. Search keywords and 
dialogs are created on the server computer and sent to 
a mobile phone. Fig. 3 is an image of InfoCruise on a 
mobile phone. 
We used information about 4,500 restaurants in the 
Kansai area in Japan. The content has nine facets: 
location and open time, parking, price, interior design, 
service, cuisine, atmosphere, style, and sub-style. The 
facets and facet values were manually assigned. We 
also defined four user contexts: current position, 
current time, whether the user drives, and budget. 
These contexts will be acquired automatically in the 
future when the GPS function and electric money in 
mobile phones become widespread. However, we set 
these contexts manually in our prototype.   
 We prepared two search strategies for the retrieval 
of restaurants by mobile phones. One is an exploratory 
search strategy used when a user wants to know the 
most common type of restaurant in the area. In this 
strategy, we prioritize the facet with the largest 
difference among facet values because this is the most

relevant information. Users select this strategy when 
they don’t know the area around them very well.  
The second strategy is a quick search strategy used 
when a user wants to decide on a restaurant as soon as 
possible. In this strategy, we prioritize the facet in 
which the number of contents for each facet value is 
the most equal to refine the contents with certainty. 
The advantage of the exploratory search strategy is 
that users can discover new and unexpected 
information by traversing the information set. But a 
disadvantage of the exploratory search strategy is that 
searches 
are 
time-consuming. 
In 
contrast, 
the 
advantage of the quick search strategy is that users can 
search rapidly. However users can’t extract new 
information using the quick search strategy. 
We describe the method for ranking the facets of 
each search strategy as follows. 
 
4.1 “Exploratory search” strategy 
 
In the “exploratory search” strategy, the evaluated 
value of each facet is calculated by Formula (1) and 
the facet of the highest evaluated value is selected: 
i
i

C
E

Ei is the evaluated value of facet i. Ci is the 
evaluated value of the context about the contents of 
facet i. Ui is the evaluated value of the context about 
the users of facet i. Di is the evaluated value of the 
context about the dialog of facet i.  
 The evaluated value of the context about the 
contents, Ci, is calculated using the difference of the 
contents distribution among the facet values. If there is 
the largest difference among facet values in a facet, we 
think the facet has some characteristic that should be 
pointed out to users. Ci is calculated by formula (2):

       (2) 
 
In Formula (2), mi is the number of facet values in 
facet i. Ni,j is the number of contents of facet value j in 
facet i, which is normalized by the summation of the 
contents of all facet values in facet i. For example in 
Fig. 4(A), value Cstyle is higher than value Catmosphere, 
because there is greater variation in restaurant styles. 
The evaluated value of the context about users, Ui, 
is defined as follows. We prioritize the facet associated 
with user context. If a user’s current position and time 
are set, the evaluated value of the “location and open 
time” facet is prioritized. If the user is driving, the 
evaluated value of the “parking” facet is prioritized. If 
a price range is set, the evaluated value of the “price” 
facet is prioritized. Specifically, Ulocation and open tim are 
1.8, Uparking is 1.5, Uprice is 1.3, and Uothers=1. 
 The evaluated value of the context about dialog Di 
is calculated by Formula (3). We define the priority of 
a facet used just before lower than other facets, but its 
priority gradually increases each time a user refines a 
search:  
⎩

In Formula (3), ni is the number of dialogs since 
facet i was used (when facet i was used ni=0), and αi 
is the gradient. In this systemαi =0.01. We adjustedαi  
so that a facet used before appears again after several 
dialogs. 
 
 
4.2 “Quick search” strategy 
 
In the “quick search” strategy, the evaluated value 
of each facet is also calculated by formula (1) to select 
the facet of the highest evaluated value. The evaluated 
values of the context about dialog Di, and users Ui are 
used in the same way as the “exploratory search.”  
The evaluated value of the context about contents Ci 
is calculated using the evenness of content distribution. 
A user can refine the contents with certainty if he 
selects a facet in which the number of contents for 
each facet value is equal. The facet should be pointed 
out to users. Ci is calculated by Formula (4):

 In Formula (4), M is determined by the number of 
search keywords that can be shown on a mobile phone. 
We calculate the variance of the top M facet values of 
each facet. Ci is raised when the variance becomes 
small. Ni,k is the number of contents of facet value k in 
facet i, which is normalized by the summation of the 
contents of M facet values in facet i. For example in 
Fig. 4(B), value Catmosphere is higher than value Cstyle. 
 
4.3 Interactive navigation 
 
Ranking facets and selecting keywords are done 
each time a user refines a search. If a user’s current 
position is known, the system prioritizes the “location” 
facet and presents search keywords about location to 
refine the contents, as shown in Fig. 5. When a user 
selects a search keyword in the “location” facet, its 
priority is decreased because it was just previously 
used. Next, the system calculates content distribution 
and prioritizes the facet with greater variation such as 
“cuisine” under the “exploratory search” strategy.   
 
4. 4 Example of operation 
 
We now explain an example of our system operation. 
In Fig. 6(A), a user sets his current position, budget, 
date, and time as user contexts. He also selects his 
favorite search strategy from “search exploratory” or 
“search quickly.” The concept and purpose of each 
search strategy were explained to users in advance. His 
current position and time are set, so the evaluated 
value of the “location and open time” facet is 
prioritized. In Fig. 6(B), the system presents such 
dialogs to users as “If you select ‘within 2 km’ of 
Kyoto, 105 restaurants are available” and search 
keywords about distance. The system automatically 
searches for restaurants open at the current time and 
calculates the distance from the current position to 
each shop. The system defines the presentation number 
of shops and distance such as “105” restaurants and 
“2” km. When a user selects a search keyword “within 
2 km,” the system generates a focus facet and facet 
values once again to refine 105 contents. In Fig. 6(C), 
the system presents to a user a focus facet “style” with 
the largest difference among facet values under the 
search exploratory strategy. The system presents a 
dialog such as “105 restaurants are found within 2 km. 
How about Japanese because it is the most common 
type around here?” When a user selects “Japanese” as 
a search keyword, the system presents a focus facet 
“cuisine” with the largest difference among facet 
values to refine the 55 contents. Sometimes after a user 
selects keywords and the number of contents are 
reduced well (e.g., under five contents), the system 
stops proposing search keywords, as shown in Fig. 
6(E). 
If the user feels that the proposed search keywords 
aren’t suitable, she can change the search strategy, for 
example, from an exploratory to a quick search 
strategy (Fig. 6(C)). The system newly generates a 
focus facet and facet values to refine the same 105 
contents and presents an “atmosphere” focus facet in 
which the number of contents for each facet value is 
the most equal. In Fig. 6(F), the system presents search 
keywords about atmosphere. 
 
5. User study 
 
We evaluated our information navigation method 
from the viewpoints of effectiveness and efficiency. 
We compared InfoCruise to two experimental systems 
using traditional search methods. One system searches 
by category (facet) using a pull down menu. All 
categories and search conditions are shown fixedly at 
all times. The other resembles traditional faceted 
navigation systems in which only one facet is shown 
and the appearance order of the facets is fixed, for 
example alphabetically.

5.1. Measures 
 
Some measures were defined to evaluate our system’s 
effectiveness and efficiency. 
 
5.1.1. 
Effectiveness. 
Since 
InfoCruise 
is 
an 
exploratory search system, it has difficulty defining 
what contents a user wants before a search. Since we 
don’t know the correct answer, we can’t use such 
traditional search measures as relevance or recall ratios. 
Therefore, we measured the discovery rate and the 
satisfaction rating to evaluate effectiveness. The 
discovery rate is the number of tasks in which users 
found the content versus the number of all tasks. It 
does not matter whether the content found by the user 
is what the user wanted before the search. The 
satisfaction rating is a subjective ranking in which a 
score of 5 is defined as satisfied and 1 as dissatisfied. 
If a user can’t find a restaurant, the rating is 0.  
 
5.1.2. Efficiency. InfoCruise is an exploratory search 
system in which users repeat a search and confirm its 
results until they get their desired information. They 
clarify their needs through a process, so reducing the 
total operation time is not important. We used two 
indexes to measure whether futile operations decreased. 
First, we measured the correction rate to evaluate the 
efficiency. InfoCruise shows search keywords and the 
number of search results for each keyword to refine the 
current contents to help users preview their search 
results. Since users can select appropriate keywords 
using InfoCruise, so they won’t need to correct 
keywords during the search. The correction rate is the 
number of corrected search keywords versus the 
number of search keywords set in one search. Second, 
we measured the number of times users changed facets 
for InfoCruise compared to traditional faceted 
navigation methods. InfoCruise analyzed the facet 
priority using context. This method will probably 
reduce the times users changed facets.

5.2. Experiment  
 
Two kinds of experiments were conduced to compare 
InfoCruise with traditional search systems.  
 
5.2.1. Experiment 1: comparison with search by 
category 
system. 
We 
evaluated 
InfoCruise’s 
effectiveness for a traditional search by a category 
system using the discovery rate and the satisfaction 
rating and its efficiency using the correction rate. The 
two systems had the same database and a similar UI 
(Fig. 7). The contents were located at the top of the 
screen and the search conditions at the bottom. The 
compared search system fixedly showed its categories 
and search conditions at all times. Users selected 
conditions using a pull-down menu and a “GO” button.   
The 16 participants, who ranged in age from 20 to 
40, commonly used mobile phones but they were not 
PC or Internet experts.  
Participants searched for an appropriate restaurant 
under a designated situation. The tasks were prepared 
in five abstraction levels for search purposes to 
evaluate the InfoCruise’s effectiveness when user 
needs were ambiguous. As shown in Fig. 8, each task 
defines a situation that designated some search 
conditions. Task T1 is the most abstract, which means 
the user needs were ambiguous. The situation is only 
designated by the location and date conditions. T5 is 
the most concrete, so its situation is designated by 
location, date, and two search conditions. 
In our experiment, users executed five tasks (one for 
each task level) for InfoCruise and the compared 
system. Users pushed the “complete” button when they 
found a desired restaurant or users pushed the “give 
up” button when they wanted to quit. To measure the 
discovery rate, users could quit whenever they chose. 
After 
finishing 
one 
task, 
they 
completed 
a 
questionnaire containing satisfaction ratings and 
comments and then executed the next task. After 
finishing all five tasks of one experimental system, 
they moved to the other experimental system. The 
users executed five different tasks on the two 
experimental systems. 
 
5.2.2. Experiment 2: comparison with faceted 
navigation system.  We evaluated InfoCruise for a 
traditional search system like faceted navigation. 
InfoCruise presents user search keywords in a focus 
facet based on context. In contrast, the compared 
system shows search keywords in one facet whose 
appearance order is fixed alphabetically. If the ranking 
method of facet in InfoCruise is useful, the times that 
users change facets may be reduced. The main purpose 
of the experiment is to evaluate efficiency using the 
times users changed facets. We also measured the 
discovery rate, the satisfaction rating, and the 
correction rate for the traditional search system like 
faceted navigation. 
The InfoCruise interfaces are shown in Fig7 (a). The 
interfaces of the compared system were the same as 
InfoCruise, but the appearance order of the facets was 
fixed alphabetically. If the users don’t like the

presented search conditions in one facet, they can 
change the facet by clicking the “Other category,” in 
both InfoCruise and the compared system.  
The procedures of Experiment 2 were the same as in 
Experiment 1, but only tasks 1, 3, and 5 were used: the 
five participants were in their 20s and 30s. 
 
5.3. Results 
 
We describe the results of the two experiments from 
the viewpoint of effectiveness and efficiency. 
 
5.3.1. Effectiveness. Table 1 shows the results of 
Experiment 1 comparing InfoCruise to a traditional 
search system showing all categories any time fixedly. 
The discovery rate and the average satisfaction rating 
in all tasks and at each task level are shown in Table 1. 
The discovery rate of InfoCruise in all tasks (87%) was 
10% higher than the compared system showing all 
categories any time (78%). The satisfaction rating of 
InfoCruise in all tasks (3.42) was 0.6 point higher than 
the compared system (2.8). The difference between the 
two systems was significant (p<0.05). The results 
suggest that InfoCruise is effective for desired 
information discovery. 
Based on the discovery rate of each task level in 
Table 1, InfoCruise’s ratings were better than the 
compared system in all task levels except Task 2. The 
difference between InfoCruise and the compared 
system in Task 1 was 25%, but the difference in Task 5 
was only 4%. Furthermore, based on the satisfaction 
rating of each task level in Table 1, InfoCruise’s rating 
was only significantly better than the compared system 
in T1. This means that InfoCruise is more effective 
under T1 than under T5. T1 is the most abstract task. 
The result suggests that InfoCruise is especially 
effective when user needs are ambiguous.  
Table 3 shows the results of Experiment 2 
comparing InfoCruise to a traditional search system 
like faceted navigation in which the appearance order 
of facets is fixed alphabetically. The discovery rate of 
InfoCruise in all tasks (100%) was higher than the 
compared system (87%). The satisfaction ratings 
between two systems were not different.  
  
5.3.2. Efficiency. Table 2 shows the correction rate 
of Experiment 1 comparing InfoCruise to a traditional 
search system showing all categories any time. 
InfoCruise’s correction rate, which was also calculated 
by each search strategy, was much smaller in all tasks 
(8.9%) than the compared system (37.4%). The 
correction rate of the “search exploratory” strategy was 
5.9%, and the correction rate of the “search quickly” 
strategy was 16.7%. The average task completion time 
was 255 seconds for InfoCruise. In contrast, it was 291 
seconds for the compared system. This means that 
since users can select appropriate keywords using 
InfoCruise, they don’t need to correct keywords during 
the search and they can find contents more quickly 
than using the compared system. 
Table 3 shows the number of times that users 
changed facets and the correction rate of Experiment 2 
comparing InfoCruise to a traditional search system in 
which the appearance order of facets is fixed 
alphabetically. The number of changing facets for 
InfoCruise (0.8) was smaller than the compared system

(1.7). The operation load for changing facets was 
reduced. InfoCruise’s correction rate was also smaller 
than the compared system. 
These two results suggest that users can search 
efficiently using InfoCruise. 
 
5.3.3. User Comments. We gathered user comments 
by questionnaires. There were four possible answers to 
the question, “In what situation might you use 
InfoCruise?” The answers were: “when I want to 
quickly decide on a restaurant” (5 users), “when I 
don’t have any idea where to go” (3), “when I want to 
pick a restaurant as close as possible” (1), and “when I 
have to decide on a restaurant in a new place” (1). 
Furthermore, there were four answers to the question, 
“What are the good points of InfoCruise?” The 
answers were: “I could find new information” (3), “it 
is easy to use on a mobile phone” (3), “I enjoyed the 
search process” (2), and “I got various kinds of 
information” (2).  
 
6. Discussion 
  
First, we discuss the effectiveness. InfoCruise’s 
discovery rate was higher than the compared system 
showing all categories any time. Based on the user 
comments, users want to use InfoCruise when they 
don’t have any idea where they will go or when they 
have to decide on a restaurant in a new place. In this 
situation, selecting keywords is difficult using such a 
traditional search method as the compared system 
because the user information needs are ambiguous. On 
the other hand, users can select keywords from 
presented keywords, define their needs through 
interaction, and find a restaurant using InfoCruise in 
this situation, so the discovery rate might increase.  
InfoCruise’s satisfaction rating was also higher than 
the compared system showing all categories any time. 
Based on user comments, they enjoyed finding new 
information and the search process itself. Even if the 
restaurant found was unexpected, the user might be 
satisfied with it through the process. On the other hand, 
when empty result sets were shown using the 
compared system, users felt like they had hit a dead 
end. After such a dead end, users seemed to settle on a 
kind of restaurant that they really didn’t want. So the 
satisfaction rating of the compared system might be 
lower than InfoCruise.  
Next, we discuss the efficiency. The correction rate 
of InfoCruise was much smaller than the compared 
system showing all categories any time. Fig. 9 shows 
an example of a user’s operation on both systems. The 
facets, the selected search conditions, and the number 
of search results are shown. In the compared system, a 
user changed the keyword set before on the same facet 
such as “location” and “style”, perhaps because the 
number of search results was too great or too small. 
There was waste in the user operations, and the 
correction rate of the compared system was high. 
Otherwise, in InfoCruise, a user added keywords from 
different facets and gradually refined the contents. The 
user alternately selected a keyword from the location, 
cuisine, sub-style, and atmosphere facets. Fig. 10 
shows the presented facet and search keywords in this 
experiment. The user’s selection order followed the 
one presented by the system. Users can add keywords 
gradually after checking the search results, so the 
correction rate is low.  
In addition, users can narrow down restaurants from 
an unexpected view with InfoCruise. For example in 
the experiment, one user, who selected a keyword in 
an atmosphere facet on the fourth search (Fig. 9), 
commented that “I don’t have any restaurant 
preference.” If the user hadn’t searched for restaurants 
using InfoCruise, she wouldn’t have selected a 
keyword from an atmosphere facet. The presented 
focus facet on InfoCruise inspired new interest in the 
user such as atmosphere. 
Based on the correction rate of each search strategy, 
the correction rate for the “quick search” strategy was 
a little higher than for the “exploratory search” strategy. 
The search keywords presented for “quick search” 
might not fit the user’s intention so well.  
In the comparison between InfoCruise and the 
system in which the appearance order of facets is fixed 
alphabetically, the times users changed facets in 
InfoCruise was about half that of the compared system. 
So the algorithm for ranking facets might be useful to 
reduce user operation loads. If users aren’t satisfied 
with the presented facet, they can change it. But in our 
experiment, many users tentatively selected a keyword 
from the facet presented by the system and corrected 
their selected keywords later. So the correction rate of 
the compared system was higher than InfoCruise.  
In conclusion, since users enjoyed the search 
process and found a restaurant using InfoCruise even 
when their needs were ambiguous, both InfoCruise’s 
discovery rate and satisfaction rating might increase. 
The result suggests that InfoCruise is effective for 
desired 
information 
discovery 
when 
a 
user’s 
information needs are not well defined. In InfoCruise, 
a user added keywords from different facets and 
gradually refined the contents, so the keyword 
correction rate was low. The algorithm for ranking 
facets was also useful to reduce user operation loads. 
The result suggests that InfoCruise is efficient for 
searching for information.

7. Related work 
 
Our purpose is to support searches on small screens 
and when the user’s search purpose is ambiguous. 
Faceted navigation is an existing solution for 
ambiguous search purposes. Most faceted navigation 
systems show all facets and many facet values on a 
screen [3], [4], [5]. If a screen is big enough such as a 
PC, these techniques are very effective for searches. 
However, mobile phones have small screens, and 
showing all facets such as existing faceted navigation 
systems seems difficult. Our method, which selects a 
focus facet for which users can choose a search 
keyword easily, is effective on the limited screens of 
mobile phones. FaThumb [2] is faceted navigation for 
mobile searches in which a number keypad navigates 
the metadata. Fathumb needs to make hierarchical 
metadata that include up to nine facets at one hierarchy. 
Our method sets the priority facets using context. If the 
number 
of 
facets 
increases, 
our 
method 
can 
automatically present a refined facet.  
InfoCruise has two main features. One is presenting 
keywords to lighten the load for generating search 
queries. The other is interactive navigation. We discuss 
the relation between our method and other works by 
their features. 
From the viewpoint of the presenting keyword 
function, Google Suggest, one technology that 
provides additional keywords after user input [8], 
presents keywords related to the input keyword by 
analyzing co-occurrence keywords selected from user 
logs. InfoCruise also presents keywords in a focus 
facet. But our method generates keywords based on the 
context about the users and contents. We can present 
keywords adapted to user circumstances or content 
distribution. 
From the viewpoint of easing the load for 
generating search queries, research exists on query-
free retrieval that automatically gathers information 
without user input. Reference [9] selects information 
based on text being written or read in Emacs. 
Reference [10] selects information based on the user’s 
physical context such as his location, the people in the 
area, or the date. These systems automatically retrieve 
contents; otherwise InfoCruise presents keywords to 
refine them. We believe when systems infer using 
context, 
presenting 
keywords 
and 
confirming 
interactively might provide satisfying search results. 
 From the viewpoint of interactive navigation, 
relevance feedback [11] repeatedly performs a search 
and locates results close to a user’s demand by 
generating queries from the search results users judged 
as matching their demands. The content of search

results has many features, so the system doesn’t know 
which feature is important from the user’s evaluation 
of the content. A user selects a search keyword made 
directly from the metadata of the contents in 
InfoCruise. Our method could bring search results 
closer to a user’s demand more directly.  
 
8. Conclusion 
 
We 
proposed 
InfoCruise, 
an 
information 
navigation method that presents keywords in a focus 
facet by analyzing the context about the contents, users, 
and dialogs. Our method calculates the priority of 
facets by analyzing three kinds of contexts. We 
developed an application system to search for 
restaurants by mobile phone and evaluated our method 
compared to traditional search methods. In our 
experiments, both the discovery rate and the 
satisfaction rating of our system are higher than those 
of the traditional search methods, so InfoCruise is 
effective to discover desired information. Both the 
keyword correction rate and the number of times users 
changed facets in our method are lower than those in 
the traditional search methods, so users can search 
efficiently with InfoCruise. 
As future work, developing metadata assigned 
technology is important. In this paper, we used 
manually assigned metadata. Keywords must be 
automatically extracted that describe content features 
as 
well 
as 
people 
do. 
Moreover, 
keyword 
categorization technology is needed to make pairs of 
facets and facet values. In our method, dialog history 
affects the priority facets, but it is only a short-term 
history in one search. Long-term dialog history must 
also be treated because it reflects user preference. Our 
future work also involves calculating the priority facets 
based on context containing long-term dialog history.
