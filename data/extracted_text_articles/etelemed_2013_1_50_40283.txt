Abstract—Medication usage and administration are key
areas for standardisation and interoperability in specialty-
agnostic, secondary care research systems. Based on the
requirements of four medical research specialty areas in
Central England, we developed a medication record model,
for the purpose of keeping track of medications the patients
are taking, both from a patient-care and future research-
participation perspectives. In this paper, we present the
model
that
is
flexible
enough
to
capture
the
core
requirements of all research specialty areas, but also
extensible
to
include
more
specific,
non-generic
requirements. This work supports the electronic health data
standardisation
and
interoperability
efforts
within
the
secondary care domain.

I.
INTRODUCTION
The interoperability and standardisation of medical
information in secondary care is an ongoing challenge,
also
reflected
in
secondary
care
research,
where
information
is
collected,
processed,
queried
and
exchanged for clinical studies within various specialty
research areas. A recent report [1] highlighted the
disparity between the primary and secondary care sectors,
in terms of the systematic application of information
technology in healthcare. In the eight countries studied,
secondary care adoption of health information technology
and health information exchange was behind that of
primary care. This was particularly the case in England.
Our work aims to find solutions towards the increased
interoperability and standardisation of information in
secondary care research. One specific area focuses on
patient medication recording, that is, the recording of
medications
administered
to
patients
by
healthcare
professionals, and also other medications self-reported by
the patients. Medication usage information is necessary
for the clinical care of the patient—the knowledge of
treatments
for
particular
conditions;
for
safety—the
interactions of drugs; and for including or excluding
patients from participation in clinical studies.
In this paper, we present a patient medication model,
developed to capture the requirements of four research
specialty research areas: asthma, bronchiectasis, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and early arthritis.
While medication recording is common to all four, the
level of detail captured varies. The proposed model
captures the links between
medication, patient and
healthcare professional; and it also fits within the
extensible Comprehensive Unified Research (CURe)
framework
for
developing
secondary
care
research
systems. Our model builds on existing efforts by the
English National Health Service (NHS), such as the
dictionary
of
medicine
and
devices
(dm+d)
[2],
prescribing model [3] and dose syntax model [4]. Our
medication
model
addresses
a
specific
context—
monitoring medication usage by patients—and differs
from the contexts addressed by e-prescription, medication
adherence and management, which are the focus of many
of the research work on the subject of medication.
Although the model describes the set of medication data
elements useful for secondary care research registries, we
will illustrate the data items recorded in the CURe
applications for the four specialty areas.

RELATED WORK
Our work currently applies to the Central England
region and as such, we have looked into the models used
by the NHS, the main provider of healthcare. We have
also considered relevant work in the literature regarding
the medication datasets and their standardisation.
A.
Prescribing and Dose Syntax Models
In July 2012, the NHS adopted the dm+d as the
standard dictionary of medicines licensed in the United
Kingdom [5]. The dm+d is the basis for all medicine and
device codes forming the SNOMED CT UK Drug
Extension, following the need to integrate dm+d with the
Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms
(SNOMED CT), the NHS strategic clinical terminology
solution, necessary for the interoperability of electronic
health records [6,7]. Dose-based prescribing is normal
practice in secondary care [3]. On paper, this combines
the generic drug name (virtual therapeutic moiety, VTM),
dose, route and frequency, for example: Paracetamol
(drug name), 500 mg (dose) — oral (route) — qds

Figure 1. Medication entity model
(frequency, Latin abbreviation for four times a day). In
electronic prescribing systems, the dm+d implementation
guide
suggests
using
VTM
concepts
to
prescribe
generically, while taking into account some exceptions
and the prescribing rules [3]. The dm+d is structured
around five key components, ranging from a generic drug
(VTM, e.g. Atenolol) to an actual medicinal product pack
(AMPP), which is drug manufactured by a specific
supplier with the drug having form and strength values,
e.g. Atenolol 100 mg tablets (Alpharma) x 28 tablet.
Although the dm+d provides a standard description
and electronic identifier for medicines, there is no
standard structure for representing dosage instructions, for
example, "take two tablets three times a day". Without
standardisation, this information can only be sent and
stored electronically using free text. Work is ongoing to
develop standard dosage syntax so that this information
can be sent in a standard coded format, which will enable
diverse
clinical
systems
to
manipulate
the
data
transferred, for example calculate a dose or quantity. This
will also improve patient safety by standardising the way
that dosage instructions are communicated and reducing
the potential for misinterpretation. The dosage syntax
model was developed by the NHS Information Authority
in conjunction with the international health standards
organisation, HL7 [8, 9], with a cut down version of the
dose syntax model for e-prescribing [10].
B.
Medication Datasets
A number of related projects on electronic health
records have defined
datasets for
medication,
with
different usage to supporting research. MyMedicationList
[11] is a prototype application that helps users to manage
their personal medication record. The medication record
is
based
on
a
document
model
that
captures
the
medication name, interval, quantity, frequency, patient
instruction, indication, available generic substitute of a
branded drug, prescriber and supplier.
The Continuity of Care Record (CCR) schema is a
core
dataset
of
the
most
relevant
administrative,
demographic, and clinical information facts about a
patient’s healthcare [12]. It is one of suite of standards for
health information systems used in the United States,
developed to organise and make transportable a set of
basic healthcare information that can be accessed by
medical practitioners and patients. The CCR schema
defines a medication object to describe a patient’s current
medications. Similarly, openEHR [13] develops open
specifications
for
health
information
systems.
For
medication management, openEHR has identified data
groups relating to medication order or administration [14].
The above works have informed our medication
model, developed to capture routine medication usage
information useful for research studies. The following
sections
describe
how
our
model
captures
user
requirements, and its implementation within CURe.
III.
SCOPE AND CONTEXT OF WORK
A.
CURe Framework
The CURe framework has been developed as part of
the design and development of a research system to be
used for clinical research databases and clinical studies
across multiple research specialty areas in secondary care.
The extensible framework adopts a modular approach to
solve some of the problems of localised clinical research
systems, where a system is built for a single clinical unit
to
solve
immediate
localised
problems,
without
considering the possibility of similar requirements from
other units or research specialty areas, irrespective of
location [15]. User requirements are used to build generic
models of common data elements between specialty areas.
By using an extensible design pattern, the common
elements create scalable object oriented taxonomies
designed around generic and non-generic data objects.
Our work also includes an adaptation and implementation
of technical standards, especially in data recording, which
facilitates interoperability across research systems for
different specialty areas.
B.
User Requirements
The knowledge elicitation process, aided by the
participatory approach with the domain experts, led to the
gathering of the medication recording needs of users in
the four research specialty areas. The common data items
include
generic
drug
name;
drug
category;
active
ingredient (name, strength); dosage (value, unit); start and
stop dates; frequency. Other data items include brand
name; and route of administration.
IV.
MEDICATION MODEL
Based on the user requirements and the medication
standardisation decisions, we present the core medication
model, as well as aspects of the extended model that cater
for some of the additional requirements within CURe.

The entity model (Figure 1) presents the components of
the medication model, specifically highlighting their
relationships from an architectural design perspective.
A.
Medication Data Group
Medication-related data elements are presented in
Table 1. The last three rows are attributes relating to the
links
among
medication,
patient
and
healthcare
professional, that we model in CURe for validation and
auditing purposes. The second column of Table 1
describes each data element and gives examples of what
data values we have used in CURe. The generic drug
name is a key element in this group. In CURe, we adopted
the NHS dm+d VTM for the standardised generic drug
names as used in the UK. Similarly, to make the drug
information interoperable, we are using SNOMED CT
codes to uniquely identify each generic drug. This has an
advantage over the British National Formulary [16],
which, although widely used by healthcare professionals
for prescribing, it does not have unique codes for drugs.
For users who want to specify the brand name, we are
using the SNOMED CT Trade Family concepts. For data
values, such as units of measure, frequency and route of
administration, we have used dm+d editorial policy
guidance and international standards where applicable.

V.
DISCUSSION
A.
Interoperability
The medication model presented caters for the major
aspects of interoperability in terms of drug names, coding
system and common dosage instructions. While in this
model, active ingredient strength and dosage use a single
unit, some specialties have indicated the need for multiple
units, or conversion units, e.g. for inhaled steroids.
References to standard conversions can be made available
to users on the user interface, instead of representing them
in the medication model.
B.
Recording of unlicensed drugs
The
medication
information
recorded
concern
prescribable licensed drugs. However, some domain
experts have requested the recording of clinical trial drugs
or unlicensed drugs. The medication model presented is
not for an e-prescribing system. As such, it does not limit
the recording of only licensed drugs. However, to
differentiate between licensed and unlicensed drugs, the
model could incorporate a data element to indicate this,
hence
preserving
the
meaning
of
the
information
recorded. Moreover, this requirement will impact on the
standardised terminology for drugs and ensuring that both
licensed and unlicensed drugs are present.
VI.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we presented a medication model to
record the medication usage of patients in secondary care.
The need for such a model arose from the lack of
integration between healthcare systems, especially those
developed for research. The medication model has been
developed to allow patient medication information to be
recorded and queried across multiple medical research
specialty areas. Existing drug dictionaries and datasets
have been developed mainly to standardise electronic
prescription and medication order and management. We
have adopted some of the relevant elements to develop a
medication model to support secondary care research.
In
future
work,
we
will
be
investigating
the
categorisation of drugs by experts to facilitate the
selection of drugs.
This is aimed towards providing an
agreed shortlist of medications based on each specialty
area, or other grouping, such as inhalers, to enable users
to select drugs from the shortlist rather from the list of all
drugs. In the CURe application, we are also working on
enabling users in different research specialty areas to view
medications recorded across specialty areas, for the safety
and care of the patients, while respecting the ethical and
authorisation measures in place.
