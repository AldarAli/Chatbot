Abstract—The prediction of the running injuries based on self-
reported training data on load is difﬁcult. At present, coaches and
researchers have no validated system to predict if a runner has
an increased risk of injuries. We aim to develop an algorithm
to predict the increase of the risk of a runner to sustain an
injury. As a ﬁrst step Self-reported data on training parameters
and injuries from high-level runners (duration=37 weeks, n=23,
male=16, female=7) were used to identify the most predictive
variables for injuries, and train a machine learning tree algorithm
to predict an injury. The model was validated by splitting the data
in training and a test set. The 10 most important variables were
identiﬁed from 85 possible variables using the Random Forest
algorithm. To predict at an earliest stage, so the runner or the
coach is able to intervene, the variables were classiﬁed by time to
build tree algorithms up to 7 weeks before the occurrence of an
injury. By building machine learning algorithms using existing
self-reported training data can enable prospective identiﬁcation
of high-level runners who are likely to develop an injury. Only
the established prediction model needs to be veriﬁed as correct.

INTRODUCTION
In the context of the project ’Groningen Monitoring Ath-
letic Performance Study’(MAPS) [1] two years of data was
gathered about load, and tests on the performance of compet-
itive athletes. The investigation into the factors that inﬂuence
performance and injury risk of athletes lead to more insight.
The effect of a change in load on injuries is difﬁcult to predict.
The knowledge on the relationship between load and the effect
on injuries might be improved by matching self-reported train-
ing data and injury data using machine learning techniques. At
present, Human Movement Researchers of the project MAPS
have no published ﬁndings on the relation between a change
in load and injuries on endurance athletes. To identify the
predictors, a choice has to be made on which information is
to be used for developing an algorithm for the prediction of
injuries. There are two kinds of data available, the daily self-
reported training log data and the injury data of high-level
competitive runners. An injury is deﬁned as any musculosketal
problem of the lower extremity or back that lead to an inability
to execute training or competition as planned for at least one
week [2]. The training log data contains information about
the training duration and the training intensity. The intensity
times the duration is the workload of a training. The terms
acute and chronic workload are used to descibe the intensity
of the immediate window of training. Acute workload is the
average workload of the last seven days, chronic workload
is the average workload of the last 28 days. [3]. A study to
sustain an injury risk of rugby league players was conducted
with the acute:chronic ratio and concluded that there was
a relation between High Chronical workload, spikes in the
acute workload and the increased risk on injuries [4]. To ﬁnd
a relation between the workload and injuries for high-level
runners, the data of the training data log is to be converted
to predictors, which are based on the acute:chronic ratio,
derived ratio’s and the workload. Machine Learning is an
appropriate manner for examination of all these predictors [5]
because Machine Learning Techniques can discover complex
high dimensional interactions between predictors and predict
the label of injury/no injury.

METHODS
A. Study design
The study design stems out of the MAPS project. A
prospective cohort study was used in which 23 high-level
competitive runners (16 male, 7 female) were followed for
14 months. During this period they reported data on training
parameters and injuries(Table I).

B. Dataset description
1) Overall dataset: The runners kept a daily training log,
in which, information about the training duration, the training
intensity and the sustained injuries was reported. The dataset
contains 208 training patterns of 7 weeks, 52 patterns with
injuries and 156 patterns without any injury. To ﬁnd a relation
between the workload and injuries for high-level runners, the
data of the training data log is converted to features, which
are based on the acute:chronic ratio, monotony, strain and
the workload. For a sliding window of 7 weeks before the
injury, every single week the same ratio’s and workload were
calculated. The ﬁnal step was to determine the percentage of
change between the features of the identiﬁed weeks and add
this to the dataset

2) Injuries: There were 22 runners, out of 23, injured
during the observed period of 14 months. Only the complete
patterns were selected for the dataset. These are the athletes
who had no missing data in their daily training log in combi-
nation with the reported injuries. And only the injuries, which
had a sliding window of 7 weeks of self-report data before the
injury were used.
3) No injuries: The period before the injury has to be
compared with the period in which the workload doesn’t lead
to injuries. Therefore the 7 week period without resulting into
an injury, before the 7 weeks sliding window of the injury
date, was taken for every individual athlete.
C. Model development
For the identiﬁcation of the most important features Ran-
dom Forest of Sklearn was used. Random Forest builds trees
on subsets of the data, bagging, and there for applicable for
relative small datasets. [6] Next, the relative importance of the
features can be identiﬁed. To intervene as early as possible,
single trees will be assembled based on the moment in time
using the identiﬁed features.
D. Feature selection
The features within and between the sliding windows are
correlated with each other. The following features are identiﬁed
as the most important, sorted by decreasing importance.
1)
average workload week 2
2)
sum workload week 2
3)
percentage change monotony between week 1 and 2
4)
acute:chronic ratio 7 over 42 week 7
5)
acute:chronic ratio 7 over 28 week 7
6)
percentage change strain between week 1 and 2
7)
percentage change workload between week 2 and 3
8)
acute:chronic ratio 7 over 42 week 2
9)
percentage change strain between week 2 and 3
10)
strain 2
The Random Forest is also used to predict on the dataset and
had predicted 67 percent of the injuries correct.
E. Predictive modelling building
The 10 features are used to build individual trees to be
able to identify as early as possible the increase of risk. The
dataset was divided random in a training and a test set in
respectively 75% and 25%. Building a tree on the features
’acute:chronic ratio 7 over 42 week 7’ and ’acute:chronic ratio
7 over 28’ resulted in an accuracy of 75 %. With these ratios
the prediction of the injury was 75% correct. Other trees are
not built yet.
III.
RESULTS
We selected 10 predictors to predict the occurrence of an
injury in the future over an sliding window of 7 weeks. The
predictive modelling is promising but it is also a bit suspicious
that an tree is more accurate using 20% of the features in
comparison with the Random Forest.
IV.
CONCLUSION
The predictive modelling using two steps in the process
seems to be promising. But the accuracy of the tree on 20%
of the feature set is very high, future work is to investigate
the rationale behind the results. The established prediction
model needs to be veriﬁed as being correct. When a robust and
accurate prediction model is realized, the model will be added
to an app. The app will get information about the workload per
training session and, using the model, predicts the probability
on sustaining an injury.
