Abstract—The Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has 
emerged as an exciting research field in recent years and has 
the potential to revolutionize applications such as industrial 
monitoring and automation, environmental monitoring and 
biomedical science.  Wireless sensor networks achieve these 
objectives using sophisticated networks of low cost smart 
sensors 
that 
co-operatively 
monitor 
and 
communicate 
information such as gas concentration, humidity, temperature, 
etc. One of the shortfalls of the existing wireless sensor 
network technology is limited coverage area. Environmental 
monitoring applications such as bushfire detection require vast 
coverage areas for wireless sensor networks to be economically 
effective. In this paper, we present the architecture and 
characteristics of a long range wireless sensor network 
targeted for environmental monitoring applications. Firstly, 
the hardware design and software implementation are 
explained and then the achieved results are evaluated. The 
developed wireless sensor node can cover several hundreds of 
kilometers by using a proprietary mesh protocol.

 INTRODUCTION  
     Wireless sensor networks have become an important 
field in wireless technology. Wireless sensor networks have 
certain features that differentiate them from other wireless 
networks. A typical wireless sensor network has processing 
and sensing capabilities in addition to the expected 
communication capabilities. Wireless sensor networks also 
have very stringent power consumption requirements and 
have very limited computational and storage capacities. A 
typical wireless sensor network should be able to function 
unattended for extended periods of time, usually a number 
of months off say two AA batteries. 
    The challenges involved in the design of WSN are how to 
minimize 
power 
consumption 
and 
increase 
the 
computational efficiency. Most of the power in WSN is 
consumed during data communication. It is, therefore, very 
important to implement efficient networking algorithms.  
   Some of the interesting applications of wireless sensor 
networks include habitat monitoring [1], environmental 
monitoring [2], and biomedical applications [3]. The design 
choice of a wireless sensor network is very application 
dependant. For example, for environmental monitoring 
applications we ideally need a wireless sensor network that 
can cover large geographical areas, whereas in biomedical 
applications, the wireless sensor network should be tiny and 
accurate. Nevertheless, the design of the wireless sensor 
networks should be modular to some extent, in order for the 
development and manufacturing to be economically viable. 
    One of the shortfalls of the currently developed sensor 
nodes is that they can only cover small geographical areas 
due to their limited transmission range. For applications 
such as environmental monitoring, the coverage area needs 
to be at least several kilometers. One example of 
environmental monitoring application is bushfire detection. 
A bushfire monitoring system should cover tens of 
kilometers in order to be effective. Even though the short 
transmission range of existing wireless sensor networks can 
be compensated by deploying a mesh topology, it would be 
economically infeasible to have thousands of densely 
deployed sensor nodes to monitor bushfire. In fact, one of 
the advantages of WSN is its low deployment cost. 
    One possible solution to address the transmission range 
limitation of the existing sensor nodes is to connect the local 
wireless sensor network to a larger network, such as the 
internet, through a gateway node. The weakness of this 
solution is that it relies on pre-existing infrastructure. For 
example in a forest-fire detection application, the sensor 
nodes are scattered in remote areas where there is no other 
network coverage. In this situation, the nodes must be able 
to route the messages without relying on any existing 
network infrastructure. 
    Another solution is to modify the transceiver hardware of 
the existing sensor nodes to increases their receiver 
sensitivity. The JCUMote [4], a sensor node based on the 
MICAz achieves this through the use of RF power 
amplifiers. The advantage of this solution is that, it utilizes 
the already developed technology in the MICAz, but the 
increased transmission range is still not sufficient for 
applications such as forest-fire monitoring. 
   The aim of this paper is to develop a wireless sensor 
network with vast coverage to be used for environmental 
monitoring applications. In order to achieve this, we firstly 
developed the hardware platform. We then developed the 
node logic or software and integrated a long range 
transceiver with advanced built-in networking capabilities 
into the system. 
    The field tests results are very promising with 
approximately 22 kilometers of line-of-sight range. The

implementation of a mesh network has greatly extended the 
coverage area and has resulted in enhanced reliability and 
robustness of the overall network.

METHODOLOGY 
A. Node Architecture 
   The hardware of the developed sensor node is composed 
of two sensors, transceiver, antenna, expansion connectors, 
external memory and a microcontroller. The developed 
sensor node interfaces with a PC via a USB connector, and 
can be reprogrammed using the dedicated on-board 
programmer.  A block diagram of the sensor node 
architecture is shown in Figure 1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
B. Sensors and Expansion Connectors 
   There are two analog sensors integrated into the developed 
wireless sensor node, namely, humidity and temperature 
sensors. These sensors were chosen because of their 
popularity in many environmental monitoring applications.  
 
 
 
Figure 2. HIH-4030 and LM335 Sensors. 
 
   HIH-4030 [5] from Honeywell was chosen as the 
humidity sensor. HIH-4030 is an analog humidity sensor 
that can be connected directly to the microcontroller due to 
its near linear output. The special packaging provides 
protection 
against 
environmental 
hazards 
such 
as 
condensation, dirt, dust, and other chemicals. 
   According to the datasheet, output voltage and relative 
humidity are related according to the following equation. 
 
               Vout = (Vcc) (0.0062(RH) + 0.16                   (1) 
where Vout stands for the output voltage of the sensor, RH 
for relative humidity in percentage and Vcc for the supply 
voltage. The output of the sensor is connected to one of the 
ADC channels on the microcontroller via a current limiting 
resistor. 
   In order to compensate for temperature changes, which 
affect the precision of the sensor, the following equation is 
used. 
           True RH = (Sensor RH) / (1.0546-0.00216T)      (2) 
 
where True RH stands for the compensated relative 
humidity and T for the temperature in degrees Celsius. 
    LM335 [6] from National Instruments was chosen as the 
temperature sensor. LM335 is an analog temperature sensor 
that operates over a -55 degrees Celsius to 150 degrees 
Celsius temperature range. It can be directly connected to 
the microcontroller due to its near linear output response. 
   According to the datasheet the calibrated output of the 
sensor and temperature in Celsius are related according to 
the following equation. 
 
              T(C) = T0 (K) (Vout/ VoutT0) – 273                      (3) 
 
where T(C) stands for temperature in degrees Celsius, T0 
(K) for a reference temperature in Kelvin, VoutT0for the 
output voltage at the reference temperature and VoutT for the 
output voltage at any temperature. The chosen reference 
temperature for this sensor was 298 degrees Kelvin and the 
corresponding output voltage was measured to be 2.94 volts. 
   The developed sensor node has expansion connectors for 
two analog sensors, two SPI compatible sensors and three 
I2C compatible sensors. I2C and SPI interfaces were 
implemented because of their popularity in digital sensors. 
An 
external 
EEPROM 
is 
also 
connected 
to 
the 
microcontroller via I2C interface.  
C. Processor 
    ATmega168 is the chosen processor for the developed 
wireless sensor node due to its user friendly interface and 
author’s prior experience in programming Atmega family of 
microcontrollers. The important factors in choosing the 
processor were: power consumption, built-in interfaces for 
UART, SPI, I2C, speed, and size.  
D. Communication and Networking 
   The transceiver is where the communication and 
networking take place in the sensor node. The important 
factors for choosing the transceiver were transmission range, 
network topology support, power consumption and size. The 
Xbee-PRO from Digi International, the RMX-232 from 
Embedded Communication Systems and the 9-Xtend from 
MaxStream [7], [8], [9] were evaluated. The 9-Xtend RF 
radio module was the chosen transceiver due to its superior 
transmission range and support for mesh networking. The 
transceiver is connected to the microcontroller via UART 
interface. The following table summarizes the characteristics 
of the evaluated transceivers.

TABLE I. SUMMARY OF EVALUATED TRANSCEIVERS. 
 
   DIGIMESH [10], a proprietary mesh network protocol, is 
the networking protocol used in the developed sensor node. 
In a mesh network, messages are routed through several 
nodes in order to reach the final destination. Other than the 
extended range, DIGIMESH offers a unique set of 
capabilities that makes it suitable for our sensor node. Some 
of the important features of DIGIMESH include: 
 
• 
Self healing 
• 
Flexibility to expand network 
• 
Elimination of expensive gateway routers 
• 
Reliability 
 
   Self healing means that during node failures, the network 
can find an alternative path to the destination. Flexibility to 
expand the network is due to the fact any node can be added 
and removed from the network without affecting the 
functionality of the network as a whole. The homogenous 
nature of the network results in equal functionality of all the 
nodes; therefore there is no need for any gateway node with 
enhanced functionality. This makes the configuration of the 
network substantially easier. Finally, reliability is achieved 
through the use of acknowledgments and retransmissions.  
   The routing algorithm in DIMIMESH is very similar to 
the AODV (Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector) [22] 
algorithm. There is an associative routing table for each 
node that maps the destination address to its next hop 
address. Thus messages from the source node will go 
through possibly several nodes until they reach the 
destination node. When the source node doesn't have a route 
for the specified destination, it will initiate a Route 
Discovery process.  
   During the Route Discovery process, the source node 
broadcasts a Route Request message. Upon reception of 
Route Request message, the intermediate nodes rebroadcast 
the Route Request message if they don’t have a better route 
back to the source node, otherwise they drop the message. 
When the destination node eventually receives the Route 
Request message, it unicasts a Route Reply message back to 
the source node. Therefore, the source node might receive 
multiple Route Reply messages. It will choose the one with 
the best round trip route quality. It should also be noted that 
the destination address of the source nodes has to match 
with the source address of the destination node. 
E. Power Consumption 
   There are several wireless sensor nodes already available 
in the market such as TelosB [11], MicaZ [12], Waspmote 
[13], etc, all of which have low power consumption, but 
they have limited transmission range, usually several 
hundred meters. There are other long range transceivers 
available, but they are targeted for industrial applications 
and require constant power supply, and are usually very 
bulky and expensive.  
F. Final Design 
   A detailed block diagram of the developed sensor node is 
shown in Figure 3. A PCB for the complete design, 
including the microcontroller, transceiver, sensors and other 
peripherals 
was 
designed 
using 
ExpressPCB 
[11] 
manufacturer as shown in Figure 4. The PCB has two 
copper layers and is 80mm by 70mm in size. A five volt 
battery is housed underneath the PCB.

G. Node Logic 
   The node logic is shown in the following flowchart. In the 
first step the node is initialized. During node initialization, 
the ADC, UART, I2C and SPI modules are configured and 
the associated registers are initialized. Then, the sensors are 
sampled including any external sensors attached to the 
sensor node. The readings from the sensors are digitalized 
and calibrated. The calibrated results are compared against 
predefined thresholds and if they exceed, an alarm message 
is generated and sent to the transceiver via the UART 
interface. The transceiver then takes care of packetisation 
and RF transmission of the message to the base-station. 
After a brief wait, the above procedure is repeated.

RESULTS 
   The modulation technique used in the 9-Xtend RF radio 
module is BFSK (Binary Frequency Shift Keying) [23]. In 
BFSK, digital data is carried using discrete variations in the 
carrier frequency. In other words, we will represent 0s with 
one frequency and 1s with another frequency. At the same 
time, the 9-Xtend RF radio module also utilizes Frequency 
Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) [24]. In FHSS, the carrier 
frequency is varied within the available bandwidth according 
to a pseudo-random function. Consequently, the carrier 
signal will change with time and is no longer fixed. Figures 6 
and 7 demonstrate two different snapshots of frequency 
spectrums measured by portable spectrum analyzer at a close 
distance from the sensor node.

From figures 6 and 7, it is evident that 0s and 1s are 
transmitted using two different frequencies (i.e., two peaks 
around -20 dBm ) and the corresponding frequency for 0s 
and 1s varies  with time. These features reduce the amount 
of interference from other sources and improve the security 
of the developed sensor node. 
The transmission range of the developed sensor node was 
tested under three different environmental conditions. The 
maximum line of sight range is almost 22 km. These tests 
were conducted at 9600 bits per second RF throughput, 1 
watt antenna output power and using a dipole antenna with 
gain of 2.1 dBm. The following graphs demonstrate the 
signal strength vs. distance at different conditions. The 
maximum range in vegetated areas is 1100 m

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper proposed the development of a long range 
wireless sensor network for environmental monitoring 
applications. Initially, the hardware of the sensor node was 
designed and then a long range RF radio was integrated into 
the system. The developed sensor node was further 
enhanced by deploying the DIGIMESH protocol to improve 
range and overall reliability and flexibility of the proposed 
wireless sensor network. Future works include developing 
an algorithm for improving power consumption efficiency 
and incorporating a 2.4GHz radio transmitter so that the 
node can be used for both long and short range 
communications.
