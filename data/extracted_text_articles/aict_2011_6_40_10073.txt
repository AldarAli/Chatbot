Abstract—The paper proposes a new analytical method
for determining trafﬁc characteristics of multi-stage switching
networks implementing threshold mechanism with hysteresis.
The proposed method makes it possible to calculate point-to-
group blocking probability in switching networks with multi-
rate trafﬁc streams. The basis of the presented method is
the effective availability concept. The results of analytical
calculations in two switching networks are compared with
simulation data.

I. INTRODUCTION
Due to an enormous increase in the amount of information
that the public has access to in an open communications
network, attributed to the increasing popularity of multi-
media services, the Internet is on the verge of collapse
from congestion of available resources (bit rates) [1]. This
situation has been triggered by an ever-increasing number
of demanded network resources by services that can be
differentiated into three trafﬁc classes – considered in trafﬁc
theory, i.e. streaming, adaptive and elastic trafﬁc classes [2].
In the streaming service, a demanded amount of resources
is ﬁxed and cannot undergo any changes with an increase
of the load of the system. The adaptive class allows for
decreasing admitted resources to accommodate new calls,
with their service time unchanged. As far as the elastic class
is concerned, the primary task – regardless of the available
resources – is to execute a given service call. Therefore,
along with an increase in the load of the system, it is possible
to decrease the amount of the resources allocated to new
calls with a simultaneous lengthening of the service time.
Any

adopted
by
telecommunications operators to counteract the growing
congestion require performing appropriate trafﬁc analyses
of the operating network systems and their optimal shap-
ing and dimensioning. Until recently, the main empha-
sis has been put on the trafﬁc analysis of links between
telecommunications nodes. Increased capacity of these links
and the introduction of technically advanced trafﬁc con-
trol mechanisms have effected, however, in a situation in
which switching structures of network nodes have again
become topical and relevant. One of the most frequently
used switching structures, in networks with electronic and
optical switching alike, are multi-stage Clos networks. The
literature considers Clos networks both within the context
of applicable transmission techniques [1], algorithms for the
selection of connection paths [3] and a modiﬁcation to the
structure itself [4]. Nowadays, in order to fully determine the
inﬂuence of elastic and adaptive services on the effectiveness
of a telecommunications network it is thus necessary to
work out analytical methods that would enable us to model
trafﬁc characteristics of switching networks that perform and
execute this type of service.
The present article proposes an analytical method for
a determination of point-to-group blocking probability in
switching networks carrying multi-rate trafﬁc streams gen-
erated by streaming, adaptive and elastic services. For this
purpose, a threshold mechanism with hysteresis is proposed,
i.e. a system in which the decompression limit ("decom-
pression limit" – the occupancy state below which the
amount of assigned resources is equal to the initial values)
is lower (often considerably) than the compression limit
("compression limit" – the occupancy state above which
the amount of assigned resources decreases). This type of
threshold mechanism allows to limit the number of changes
in the amount of the assigned resources and improves the
operation stability of the switching nodes. In the work on
threshold systems hitherto reported and published, the focus
is mainly on single resources (links).
The ﬁrst attempt of elaborating the method devoted to
determining blocking probability in switching networks with
threshold mechanism was taken in [5]. In [5] only the
basic model of threshold mechanism was considered – the
threshold mechanism without hysteresis – it is the model
assuming that the upper limit (compression limit) is equal
to the lower limit (decompression limit). However, such
an operation of the threshold mechanism causes frequent
changes in the amount of assigned resources for calls,
especially when the average load of the system is closed
to the threshold state (the upper limit is equal to the lower
limit) of the system.
The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows.
In Section II the basic assumptions related to switching
networks are presented. In Section III the implementa-
tion of the threshold mechanisms with hysteresis in the
switching networks is proposed. The models of inter-stage
links and outgoing links are described in Section IV. The
proposed method of determining the blocking probability in

analytical modeling of the considered switching networks
are compared with simulation data in Section VI. Section
VII concludes the paper.
II. BASIC ASSUMPTIONS
In the paper the switching networks with Clos structure
are considered. The model of 3-stage switching network with
multi-rate trafﬁc is presented on Fig. 1. Each of inter-stage
links has the capacity equal to f BBUs (Basic Bandwidth
Units) and outgoing transmission links create link groups
called directions. One of typical methods for realization
outgoing directions is presented is Fig. 1; each direction
υ has one outgoing link υ from each the last-stage switch.
Each switch has υ inputs and υ outputs.
The switching network is offered m Erlang trafﬁc streams
generated by Poisson call streams. Poisson call streams are
described by the arrival rates λ1, . . ., λi, . . . , λm of calls of
particular trafﬁc classes. A class i call requires ti BBUs to
set up a connection. The holding (service) time for the calls
of particular classes has an exponential distribution with the
parameters: µ1, . . . , µi, . . . , µm. The intensity λi of Poisson
call stream of class i does not depend on the occupancy
state of the system. Thus, the mean trafﬁc Ai offered to the
system by Poisson calls of class i is equal to λi/µi.
The considered switching network works with point-to-
group selection. Following the control algorithm of this
selection, the control device of the switching network deter-
mines the ﬁrst stage switch, on the incoming link of which
a class i call appears. Then, the control system ﬁnds the
last-stage switch having an outgoing link with at least ti free
BBUs in the required direction. Next, the control device tries
to ﬁnd the connection path between the ﬁrst-stage and the
last-stage switch. Existence of the connection path causes
realization of the connection. In opposite case, the control
system begins the second attempt to set up a connection. If
the connection path cannot be found during the last try υ
(the number of possible tries equals the number of links in
the required direction), the call is lost as the result of the
internal blocking. If each last-stage switch does not have ti
free BBUs in the required direction, the call is lost because
of the external blocking.
III. SWITCHING NETWORKS WITH HYSTERESIS
The losses in the switching networks occur as the result
of the internal blocking or the external blocking. In order to
shape the dependencies between the blocking probabilities
of various trafﬁc classes it is possible to apply the thresh-
old mechanism with hysteresis to the considered switching
networks. The threshold mechanism with hysteresis can be
considered as a realization of the Call Admission Control
(CAC) function.
In the paper the threshold mechanism with hysteresis is
applied only to the outgoing links forming the outgoing
directions of the switching network. The application of this
mechanism allows to adapt the trafﬁc parameters of carried
trafﬁc classes to the occupancy state of a system. It should
be noticed that the introduction of threshold mechanism
to the outgoing links has an indirect impact on trafﬁc
characteristics of the internal links due to the decrease of the
number of assigned BBUs for calls accepted in pre-threshold
area and post-threshold area.
According to the adopted method of switching networks
modeling, in the paper it is assumed that the interstage links
can be modeled by the full-availability group [6] while the
outgoing links (outgoing directions) can be modeled by the
limited-availability group [6], presented in the next section
of the paper.
IV. SWITCHING NETWORK’S LINKS WITH HYSTERESIS
A. Model of Inter-stage Links
Let us consider a threshold model with hysteresis of
the full-availability group with multi-rate trafﬁc, the so-
called FAGTH model (Full-availability Group Threshold
with Hysteresis). The capacity of the system is equal to V
BBUs. Let us assume that set T contains the trafﬁc classes,
selected from all m trafﬁc classes offered to the switching
network, to which the threshold mechanism with hysteresis
has been applied. Let us assume further that two thresholds
Q1 and Q2 are introduced (Q2 < Q1) for calls in set T
(the threshold is the deﬁned occupancy state of the system,
determined by the number of busy BBUs). In the instance of
an increase in the load of the system above the pre-deﬁned
ﬁrst threshold Q1 a decrease in the number of assigned
BBUs to calls of belonging to set T ensues, and the average
holding time of the calls may be increased (the holding
time changes in the case of elastic services and remains
unchanged in the case of adaptive services). However, when
the load of the system decreases below the second threshold
Q2, an increase to the default values of the number of
demanded BBUs by calls belonging to set T ensues, and

Fragment of two Markov chains
the average holding time of the call may be decreased. The
service processes of the considered system can be presented
as two Markov chains presented in Figure 2. Analyzing both
the Markov chains of the service process occurring in the
considered system, one in each direction, we can observe
that the occupancy distribution in the inter-threshold area
can be approximated by the following weight distribution:
[Pn]Q,V = PI [Pn]Q1,V + PII [Pn]Q2,V ,
(1)
where PI and PII are weights which describe the proba-
bilities that the system is in the occupancy states belonging
to inter-threshold area as well as the passage direction in
inter-threshold area, while the distributions [Pn]Q1,V and
[Pn]Q2,V are the occupancy distributions determined for the
systems in which single threshold Q1 and Q2 are introduced,
respectively (i.e., in the systems with thresholds without
hysteresis). Pn determines the probability of occupancy state
n, i.e., the probability of n BBUs being busy.
Probabilities PI and PII can be determined on the basis
of passage probabilities described for state n of the Markov
chain (Fig. 2):
PI =
Pm
i=1 Aiti,0
Pm
i=1 Aiti,0 + w,
(2)
PII =
n
Pm
i=1 Aiti,0 + w,
(3)
where ti,0 is the number of BBUs assigned to class i calls in
the ﬁrst threshold area (in the occupancy states lower than
Q1 when the load of the system increases – Fig. 2a) and w
is determined by (4).
In Equations (2) and (3) it is assumed that the probability
that the system is being in the given occupancy state de-
pends on the sum of effective trafﬁcs (Pm
i=1 Aiti,0) offered
to the system and on the occupancy state of the system
(Pm
i=1 yi(n + ti,0)ti,0), where yi determines the average
number of class i calls being serviced in state n. It means,
that the probability PI – the increase in the load of the
system to the state of n BBUs being busy – is directly
proportional to the sum of effective trafﬁcs offered to the
system. However, probability PII – the decrease in the load
of the system to the state of n BBUs being busy – is directly
proportional to the sum of effective trafﬁcs serviced in state
n (Fig. 3). The values of these probabilities, determined for
Figure 3.
Fragment of Markov chain for state n
the states belonging to inter-threshold area, differ from each
other slightly. Consequently, in order to determine the values
PI and PII state w between states Q1 and Q2 has been
selected:
w = ⌊(Q1 − Q2)/2⌋ + 1.
(4)
In order to determine the weighted threshold distribu-
tion let us determine the occupancy distributions in single-
threshold (without hysteresis) systems, i.e., the distributions
[Pn]Q1,V and [Pn]Q2,V . First, let us consider the system with
single threshold equal to Q1 introduced for trafﬁc classes
from set T. According to [2], [7]:
n[Pn]Q1,V =


0
for
i ̸∈ T,
0
for
i ∈ T ∧ n ≤ Q1,
1
for
i ∈ T ∧ n > Q1.
(7)
For all states higher than Q1 (Fig. 2a), the number of
assigned BBUs for class i calls decreases from ti,0 to ti,1.
The mean number of given class calls being serviced in
particular occupancy states (threshold area q) of the system
(the so-called reverse transition rates) can be determined on
the basis of the local equilibrium equations:

i,q (n) =

for
q = 1 ∧ n > Q1 + ti,1.
(8)
Subsequently, let us consider now the other system in
which for classes from set T also a single threshold, equal
to Q2 has been introduced. Analogously as in the case of

for

(11)
When the load of the system decreases (the system in
occupancy states below state Q2) (Fig. 2b), the assigned
number of BBUs for calls from set T increases from ti,1 to
the initial value ti,0.
The mean number of class i calls being serviced in
particular states of the system with threshold Q2 can be
determined analogously to the system with threshold Q1:

The blocking probability for class i calls can be deter-
mined as the sum of the probabilities of the states in which
the system cannot admit a new class i call:

(13)
where the occupancy distribution [Pn]Q,V is calculated on
the basis of (1).
B. Model of Outgoing Links
Since the outgoing directions of the considered switching
networks are modeled as the limited availability groups let
us consider now the so-called threshold model of limited-
availability group with hysteresis, i.e., LAGTH (Limited
Availability Group Threshold with Hysteresis) model. Let
us remind that the limited availability group is the model
of systems consisting of υ identical separated transmission
links. Each link has the capacity equal to f BBUs [6]. Thus,
the total capacity of the system V is equal to V = υf BBUs.
The system services a call – only when this call can be
entirely carried by the resources of an arbitrary single link.
In the paper it is assumed the occupancy distribution in the
limited-availability group with the threshold mechanism with
hysteresis can be calculated on the basis of the appropri-
ately modiﬁed generalized Kaufman-Roberts recursion [8].
For taking into consideration the inﬂuence of the speciﬁc
structure of the limited-availability group on the process
of determination of occupancy distribution using the gener-
alized Kaufman-Roberts recursion the using of conditional
coefﬁcients of passing σi,LAG(n), was proposed. The value
of parameter σi,LAG(n) can be determined as follows [6]:
σi,LAG(n) = F(V − n, υ, f, 0) − F(V − n, υ, ti − 1, 0)
F(V − n, υ, f, 0)
,
(14)
where F(x, υ, f, t) is the number of arrangement of x free
BBUs in υ links, calculated with the assumption that the
capacity of each link is equal to f BBUs and each link has
at least t free BBUs:
F (x, υ, f, t) =
⌊ x−υt
f−t+1⌋
X
r=0
(−1)r
υ
r
x−υ(t−1)− 1−r(f −t+1)
υ−1

.
(15)
Let us observe that in the case of the considered LAGTH
model the operation of the threshold mechanism introduces
additional dependence between the trafﬁc stream in the
system and the current state of the system. This dependence
can be taken into consideration by the introduction of
the threshold coefﬁcient of passing σi,q(n) to each of the
thresholds q. The threshold mechanism is introduced to the
group regardless of its structure, what allows us to carry on
with a product-form determination of the total coefﬁcient of
passing in the limited-availability group σi,q,Total(n):
σI
i,q,Total(n) = σI
i,q(n) · σI
i,q,LAG(n),
(16)
σII
i,q,Total(n) = σII
i,q(n) · σII
i,q,LAG(n).
(17)
For determining basic trafﬁc characteristics in considered
system we can used, appropriately adapted, FAGTH method.
The modiﬁcation of FAGTH method consists in regarding
the coefﬁcients of passing deﬁned by (16) and (17) during
the occupancy distribution calculation.
V. ANALYTICAL MODEL OF SWITCHING NETWORKS
WITH HYSTERESIS
A. Effective availability in switching networks
Multi-service switching networks were the subject of
many analysis [6], [9]–[11]. At present, for blocking proba-
bility determination in the considered switching networks the
well-proven methods of the so-called effective availability
[6], [11], [12] are usually applied. According to the main
idea of the effective availability methods [6], the calculation
of blocking probability in switching networks with multi-
rate trafﬁc comes down to the calculation of the blocking
in an equivalent network carrying a single-rate trafﬁc. Each
link of equivalent network is treated as a single-channel link
with a ﬁctitious load el(i) equal to blocking probability for
a class i stream in a link of real switching network between
section l and l + 1. This probability can be calculated on
138

the basis of the blocking probability in the full-availability
group implementing threshold algorithm with hysteresis
(Formula (13)).
The effective availability in a real z-stage switching
network is equal to the effective availability in an equivalent
switching network and can be determined by the formula
derived in [6]:
d(i) = [1 − πz(i)]υ + πz(i)ηY1(i)+
+ πz(i)[υ − ηY1(i)]wz(i)σz(i),
(18)
where:
d(i) – the effective availability for the class i trafﬁc stream
in an equivalent network,
πz(i) – the probability of non availability of a given last
stage switch for the class i connection. πz(i) is the proba-
bility of an event where the class i connection path cannot
be set up between a given ﬁrst-stage switch and a given last-
stage switch. Evaluation of this parameter is based on the
channel graph of the equivalent switching network,
υ – the number of outgoing links from the ﬁrst stage switch,
Y1(i) – the average value of the ﬁctitious trafﬁc served by
the switch of the ﬁrst stage:
Y1(i) = υe1(i),
(19)
η – a portion of the average ﬁctitious trafﬁc from the switch
of the ﬁrst stage which is carried by the direction in question;
if the trafﬁc is uniformly distributed between all h directions,
we obtain η = 1/h,
wz(i) – the ﬁctitious trafﬁc carried by a single input of
the equaivalent switching network, equal to the blocking
probablity ez(i) of class i calls in the corresponding link in
the real switching network, calculated according to FAGTH
method,
σz(i) – the so-called secondary availability coefﬁcient [6]
which is the probability of an event in which the connec-
tion path of the class i connection passes through directly
available switches of intermediate stages:
σz(i) = 1 −
Yz−1
r=2 πr(i).
(20)
B. Distribution of available links
In effective availability methods, the second element
essential for determining blocking probability in switching
networks is so-called distribution of available links [6]. This
distribution determines the probability P(i, s) of an event in
which each of arbitrarily chosen s links can carry the class
i calls:
P(i, s) =
XV
n=0[Pn]V P(i, s|V − n),
(21)
where [Pn]V
is the occupancy distribution in limited-
availability group with hysteresis (LAGTH method) and
P(i, s|x) is the conditional distribution of available links,
which determines the probability of such an arrangement of
x = V − n free BBUs in s links that each of s arbitrarily
chosen links has at least ti free BBUs required for set up a
connection for class i call, while in each of the remaining
υ − s links the number of free BBUs is lower than ti [6]:
P(i, s|x) =

The research was conducted for the multi-service switching
networks to which independent classes of Erlang trafﬁc
streams were offered. The result of simulation are shown
in the charts with 95% conﬁdence intervals that have been
calculated according to the t-Student distribution for the ﬁve
series with 1,000,000 calls of each class. The research was
carried out for two different structures of switching networks
servicing three (Figure 4) and four (Figure 5) trafﬁc classes.
VII. CONCLUSION
In the paper, the threshold mechanism with hysteresis
for switching networks servicing a multi-rate trafﬁc was
proposed. The proposed mechanism ensures a substantial
decrease in blocking probabilities of certain trafﬁc classes
in the access to switching network resources. The analyti-
cal methods of calculations of the point-to-group blocking
probabilities in the multi-service switching networks with
threshold mechanism with hysteresis is also presented. The
method is based on the concept of the effective availability
and ensure fair accuracy of calculations.
