Abstract—Some users in a question and answer (Q&A) site
use multiple user accounts and attempt to manipulate com-
munications in the site. In order to detect these inadequate
multiple account users precisely, it is important to investigate
them from various points of view. In this paper, we investigate
users suspected of manipulating evaluations of their answers by
using two or more accounts for submitting many questions. The
results of this study will give us a chance to investigate purposes
and behaviors of inadequate multiple account users in a Q&A
site.
Keywords–multiple account; Q&A site; evaluation manipula-
tion; credibility.

INTRODUCTION
These days, many people use question and answer (Q&A)
sites, where users share their information and knowledge.
Q&A sites offer greater opportunities to users than search
engines in the following points:
1)
Users can submit questions in natural and expressive
sentences, not keywords.
2)
Users can submit ambiguous questions because other
users give some supports to them.
3)
Communications in Q&A sites are interactive. Users
have chances to not only submit questions but give
answers and, especially, join discussions.
As a result, Q&A sites are promising media. One of the
essential factors in Q&A sites is anonymous submission. In
most Q&A sites, user registrations are required for those
who want to join the Q&A sites. However, registered users
generally do not need to reveal their real names to submit
messages (questions, problems, answers, comments, etc.). It is
important to submit messages anonymously to a Q&A site.
This is because anonymity gives users chances to submit
messages without regard to shame and reputation. However,
some users abuse the anonymity and attempt to manipulate
communications in a Q&A site. For example, some users use
multiple user accounts and submit messages to a Q&A site
inadequately. Manipulated communications discourage other
submitters, keep users from retrieving good communication
records, and decrease the credibility of the Q&A site. As
a result, it is important to detect users suspected of using
multiple user accounts and manipulating communications in a
Q&A site. In this case, identity tracing based on user accounts
is not effective because inadequate users are likely to hide
their true identity to avoid detection. A possible solution is
authorship identiﬁcation based on analyzing stylistic features
of messages. In recent years, a large number of studies have
been made on authorship identiﬁcation [1] [2] [3] [4] [5],
however, few researchers addressed the identiﬁcation issues
of authors suspected of using multiple user accounts and
manipulating communications in a Q&A site. To solve this
problem, we proposed methods of detecting
•
multiple account users suspected of submitting ques-
tions and their answers repeatedly [6], and
•
multiple account users suspected of submitting many
answers to the same question repeatedly [7].
However, little is known about the purposes and methods of
inadequate multiple account users. As a result, it is important
to investigate these inadequate multiple account users from
various points of view. One example is how many accounts
these inadequate users use for submitting questions and ma-
nipulating their evaluations. It is natural for them to use two or
more user accounts for submitting questions and manipulating
evaluations of their answers. It is because they do not want
to draw attention to themselves. As a result, in this paper, we
investigate users suspected of using two or more user accounts
for submitting many questions and manipulating evaluations of
their answers.
Finally, we should notice that it is difﬁcult to verify the
credibility of our investigation. This is because there is no reli-
able information about users who used multiple user accounts
and manipulated communications in Q&A sites. In order to
discuss the credibility of our investigation, we show the results
of our investigation in detail. The results of this study will
give us a chance to investigate purposes and behaviors of
users who use multiple user accounts and intend to manipulate
communications in a Q&A site.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section
II, we survey the related works. In Section III, we describe
Yahoo! chiebukuro for an example of Q&A sites. In Section
IV, we describe how inadequate users use multiple user
accounts in Q&A sites. In Section V, we show how we detect
users suspected of using two or more accounts for submitting
questions and manipulating evaluations of their answers. In

RELATED WORKS
One of the essential factors of the Internet is anonymity.
Joinson discussed the anonymity on the Internet from vari-
ous points of view [8]. These days, many users abuse the
anonymity. Take Sybil attack for example. In a Sybil attack,
the attacker intends to gain large inﬂuence on a peer-to-
peer (P2P) network by creating and using a large number of
pseudonymous identities [9] [10]. Sybil attacks are cheap and
efﬁcient way to gain large inﬂuence on P2P networks [11].
Similarly, in human online communities, such as, web-based
bulletin boards, chat rooms, and blog comment forms, many
users are thought to use multiple user accounts inadequately
and submit inadequate messages, such as, deceptive opinion
spams. In recent years, a large number of studies have been
made on authorship identiﬁcation [1] [2] [3] [4] [5], however,
few researchers addressed the identiﬁcation issues of authors
suspected of using multiple user accounts and manipulating
communications in the Internet. One of the difﬁculties of this
problem is that we did not have sufﬁcient number of examples
of inadequate multiple account users. To solve this problem,
some researchers tried to extract inadequate submissions by
using heuristic methods based on text similarities and ranking
results [12] [13]. On the other hand, the authors of [14]
pointed that these heuristic methods were insufﬁcient to de-
tect inadequate submissions precisely, and showed they could
detect inadequate submissions precisely when they used large
number of examples of inadequate submissions. However,
they obtained examples of inadequate submissions by using
Amazon Mechanical Turk [15]. The examples of inadequate
submissions created by workers in Amazon Mechanical Turk
have the following problems.
•
Little is known about the purposes and methods of
inadequate submissions. As a result, it is possible that
their instructions to workers in Amazon Mechanical
Turk were insufﬁcient.
•
There are unreliable workers in Amazon Mechanical
Turk [16].
As a result, it is important to obtain inadequate submissions
from the Internet. To solve this problem, we proposed meth-
ods of detecting inadequate multiple account users and their
submissions [6] [7]. However, as mentioned, little is known
about the purposes and methods of inadequate multiple account
users. As a result, it is important to investigate these inadequate
multiple account users and their inadequate submissions from
various points of view.

join Yahoo! chiebukuro.
•
users do not need to reveal their real names to submit
their questions and answers.
•
each user can submit his/her answer only one time to

•
The period limit for accepting answers is one week.
However, questioners can stop accepting answers be-
fore the time limits.

After the time limits, questions with no answers are
removed and cannot be referable. On the other hand,
questions with answers can be referable.

each questioner is requested to determine which an-
swer to his/her question is best and give a best answer
label to it.
Figure 1 shows that user A submitted one question to Ya-
hoo! chiebukuro and three users, user B, user C, and user
D answered the question, and then, user A selected user
D’s answer as a best answer. In this study, we used the
data of Yahoo! chiebukuro for observation and examination.
Chiebukuro means pearls of wisdom. The data of Yahoo!
chiebukuro was published by Yahoo! JAPAN via National
Institute of Informatics in 2007 [17]. This data consists of
about 3.11 million questions and 13.47 million answers which
were posted on Yahoo! chiebukuro from April/2004 to Octo-
ber/2005. In the data, each question has at least one answer
because questions with no answers were removed. In order to
avoid identifying individuals, user accounts were replaced with
unique ID numbers. By using these ID numbers, we can trace
any user’s questions and answers in the data. Table I shows

In Table I, the number of questioners is the number of users
who submitted one or more questions to Yahoo! chiebukuro

IV.
SUBMISSIONS BY USING MULTIPLE USER ACCOUNTS
There are many reasons why users in a Q&A site use
multiple user accounts. First, we discuss a proper reason. In
Yahoo! chiebukuro, users do not need to reveal their real names
to submit their questions and answers. However, their submis-
sions are traceable because their user accounts are attached to
them. Because of this traceability, we can collect any user’s
submissions and some of them include clues of identifying
individuals. As a result, to avoid identifying individuals, it is
reasonable and proper that users change their user accounts
or use multiple user accounts. However, the following types
of submissions by using multiple user accounts are neither
reasonable nor proper.
TYPE QA One user submits a question and its
answer by using multiple user accounts (Figure 2
(a)).
We think that the user intended to manipulate
the submission evaluation. For example, in Yahoo!
chiebukuro, each questioner is requested to deter-
mine which answer is best and give a best answer
label to it. These evaluations encourage answerers to
submit new answers and increase the credibility of
the Q&A site. We think, the user repeated this type
of submissions because he/she wanted to get many
best answer labels and be seen as a good answerer.
TYPE AA One user submits two or more answers
to the same question by using multiple user accounts
(Figure 2 (b)).
We think that the user intended to dominate or
disrupt communications in the Q&A site. To be more
precise, the user intended to
•
manipulate communications by advocating or
justifying his/her opinions, or
•
disrupt communications by submitting two or
more inappropriate messages.
TYPE AA submissions are more similar to Sybil
attacks in P2P networks than TYPE QA submissions.
The more answers inadequate users submit by using
multiple user accounts, the easier they manipulate or
disrupt communications in a Q&A site.
These two types are not all types of inadequate submissions.
However, these kinds of submissions seriously disrupt commu-
nications in a Q&A site. Especially, TYPE QA submissions are
serious because users can manipulate evaluations of messages
by repeating TYPE QA submissions. Manipulated evaluations
discourage other submitters, keep users from retrieving good
communication records, and decrease the credibility of the
(a) TYPE QA: one user submits a question and its answer by
using multiple user accounts. (In this case, user A submits a
question and its answer by using two user accounts.)
(b) TYPE AA: one user submits two or more answers to the
same question by using multiple user accounts. (In this case,
user C submits two answers by using two user accounts.)
Figure 2.
Two types of inadequate submissions: TYPE QA and TYPE AA.
Q&A site. Furthermore, we think we cannot use knowledge
and countermeasures obtained in studies of Sybil attacks in
P2P networks because TYPE QA submissions are different
from Sybil attacks. In a Sybil attack, the more pseudonymous
identities the attacker uses, the easier he/she gain large in-
ﬂuence on a P2P network. On the other hand, in a TYPE
QA submission, the inadequate user can get a best answer
label by using only two user accounts. To solve this problem,
we proposed methods of detecting multiple account users
suspected of repeating TYPE QA submissions [6]. However,
little is known about the purposes and methods of inadequate
multiple account users. As a result, it is important to investigate
these inadequate multiple account users from various points
of view. For example, it is important to investigate how many
accounts these inadequate users use for submitting questions

and manipulating evaluations of their answers. Inadequate
multiple account users can be classiﬁed into two types:
•
inadequate users each of whom use one user account
for submitting questions and manipulating evaluations
of his/her answers, and
•
inadequate users each of whom use two or more user
accounts for submitting questions and manipulating
evaluations of his/her answers.
In this study, we investigate the latter type of users, in other
words, users suspected of using two or more user accounts
for submitting questions and manipulating evaluations of their
answers.
V.
DETECTION OF USERS SUSPECTED OF USING TWO OR
MORE ACCOUNTS FOR SUBMITTING QUESTIONS AND
MANIPULATING EVALUATIONS
Suppose that one user intends to manipulate evaluations
of his/her answers, submitted by using user account a, and
repeats TYPE QA submissions by using two user accounts,
q1 and q2. In this case, it is expected that we observe the
following abnormal submissions:
•
user a submits too many answers to questions submit-
ted by user q1 and q2,
•
user q1 and q2 receive too many answers from user a,
and
•
user q1 and q2 give too many best answer labels to
user a’s answers.
In order to detect users who intend to manipulate evaluations
of their answers and submit many questions by using two or
more user accounts, we propose a method which consist of the
following two steps:
1)
We ﬁrst detect user pairs of questioner and an-
swerer, which are suspected of repeating TYPE QA
submissions, as shown in Figure 2, by using three
hypotheses: Hypothesis QA1, QA2, and QA3.
2)
We detect users who are answerers in two or more
user pairs detected by using Hypothesis QA1, QA2,
and QA3.
Hypothesis QA1, QA2, and QA3 are as follows:
a) Hypothesis QA1: If user a did not submit abnormally
too many answers to user q’s questions, we would expect
that user a submitted at most NQA1(q, a) answers to user q’s
questions.
NQA1(q, a) = PQA1(q) × ans(a)
(1)
where ans(a) is the total number of answers submitted by
user a and PQA1(q) is the probability that an user selects
one question randomly and the question is one of user q’s
questions. Because each user of Yahoo! chiebukuro can submit
his/her answer only one time to one question, PQA1(q) is
PQA1(q) = qst(q)
Nqst
(2)
where qst(q) is the number of questions submitted by user
q and, as shown in Table I, Nqst is the total number of
questions in the data of Yahoo! chiebukuro. If this hypothesis
is rejected by an one-sided binomial test, we determine that
user a submitted abnormally too many answers to user q’s
questions.
The binomial test is an exact test of the statistical sig-
niﬁcance of deviations from a theoretically expected binomial
distribution of observations into two categories [18]. There are
two types of binomial tests: one sided binomial test or two
sided binomial test. When the critical area of a distribution is
one-sided, in other words, it is either greater than or less than
a certain value, but not both, only the one-sided binomial test
is generally applicable. In this study, the distribution area is
one-sided, we use the one-sided binomial test.
b) Hypothesis QA2: If user q did not receive abnor-
mally too many answers from user a, we would expect that
user q received at most NQA2(q, a) answers from user a.
NQA2(q, a) = PQA2(a) × qst(q)
(3)
where qst(q) is the total number of questions submitted by
user q and PQA2(a) is the probability that an user received
one answer from user a when user a selected one question
randomly and answered it. Because each user of Yahoo!
chiebukuro can submit his/her answer only one time to one
question, PQA2(a) is
PQA2(a) = ans(a)
Nqst
(4)
where ans(a) is the number of answers submitted by user
a and, as shown in Table I, Nqst is the total number of
questions in the data of Yahoo! chiebukuro. If this hypothesis
is rejected by an one-sided binomial test, we determine that
user q received abnormally too many answers from user a.
c) Hypothesis QA3: If user q did not give abnormally
too many best answer labels to user a’s answers, we would
expect that user q gave at most NQA3(q, a) best answer labels
to user a’s answers.
NQA3(q, a) = PQA3(q) × fQA(q, a)
(5)
where fQA(q, a) is the number of answers submitted by user
q to user q’s questions, and PQA3(a) is the best answer ratio
of user a.
PQA3(a) = bestans(a)
ans(a)
(6)
where ans(a) is the number of answers submitted by user a
and bestans(a) is the number of best answers in user a’s
answers. However, if user j satisﬁes one of the following
conditions:
•
all user a’s answers were selected as best answers, in
other words,
ans(a) = bestans(a)
(7)
•
Hypothesis QA3aux, the auxiliary hypothesis for Hy-
pothesis QA3, is rejected, in other words, it is consid-
ered that user a received too many best answer labels,
we set PQA3(a) as follows:
PQA3(a) = Nbestans
Nans
= Nqst
Nans

where Nbestans is the total number of best answers. Nbestans
is equal to Nqst because each question has one best answer.
If this hypothesis is rejected by one-sided binomial test, we
determined that user q gave abnormally too many best answer
labels to user a’s answers.
d) Hypothesis QA3aux: If user a did not receive abnor-
mally too many best answer labels, we would expect that user
a received at most NQA3aux(a) best answer labels.
NQA3aux(a) = PQA3aux × ans(a)

If this hypothesis is rejected by one-sided binomial test, we

labels.

RESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION
To evaluate our method, we conducted the detection of
users suspected of using two or more user accounts for sub-
mitting many questions and repeating TYPE QA submissions,
and manipulating evaluations of their answers in a Q&A site.
In this experiment, the target users were all submitters in the
data of Yahoo! chiebukuro. As shown in Table I, the numbers
of the target questioners and answerers in the data of Yahoo!
chiebukuro are 165,064 and 183,242, respectively.
In our method, we varied the signiﬁcance levels for Hy-
potheses QA1, QA2, QA3, and QA3aux from 0.00005 to
0.00000001. They were extremely low because we intend
to detect extreme abnormal submissions. Table II shows the
results of this experiment.
As shown in Table II, 59 users were detected when the
signiﬁcance level was 0.000005. We should notice that 28
users of them were detected when the signiﬁcance level was
0.00000001. It shows that many users were detected although
the signiﬁcance level was extremely low. As we expected, there
are many users suspected of repeating TYPE QA submissions
and manipulating evaluations of their answers by using two or
more user accounts for submitting questions.
We checked questions and answers submitted by the de-
tected user pairs and found that some other questioners were
criticized for their unfair best answer selections. For example,
user 233650 was criticized that he/she selected user 678451’s
answers as best answers repeatedly and unfairly. After crit-
icized for his/her unfair best answer selection, user 233650
stopped submitting any questions to Yahoo! chiebukuro. Our
method is useful for detecting these suspicious users. Further-
more, if we detect and take care of these suspicious users, we
can avoid unnecessary frictions between users.
VII.
CONCLUSION
In this study, we investigated users suspected of using
two or more user accounts for submitting questions and
manipulating evaluations of their answers. We ﬁrst discuss
reasons why users in a Q&A site use multiple user accounts.
We think many users use multiple user accounts reasonably
and properly, however, some users use multiple user accounts
improperly. For example, there seem to be users who use
two or more user accounts for submitting questions and
manipulating evaluations of their answers. However, little is
known about the purposes and methods of these inadequate
users. As a result, in order to investigate these inadequate
users, we proposed a detecting method based on binomial
test in this paper. Then, we applied our method to the data
of Yahoo! chiebukuro, and found that many users suspected
of using two or more user accounts for submitting questions
and manipulating evaluations of their answers although the
signiﬁcance level was extremely low. We intend to use the
results of this study for further investigation of purposes and
behaviors of inadequate multiple account users in Q&A sites.
For example, it is important to investigate which and how
many categories inadequate multiple account users tried to
manipulate evaluations. Also, it is important to analyze what
inadequate multiple account users mentioned in their questions
and answers. Furthermore, we intend to avoid unnecessary
frictions between users in Q&A sites by detecting and taking
care of these inadequate users.
