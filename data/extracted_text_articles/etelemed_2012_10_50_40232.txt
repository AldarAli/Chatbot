Abstract—Quality indicators play an important role in 
quantitatively measuring the quality of medical services. In 
this paper, we introduce a representation system that helps 
define quality indicators and calculate their values in a 
coherent manner based on the data in medical databases. The 
representation system primarily consists of three parts. The 
first one is an ontology to define concepts related to medical 
services. The second one is a set of graphs that express the 
targets of quantification. The third one is a set of quantifying 
concepts that abstract quantities of the target concepts. The 
proposed representation system adequately divides the work 
for defining quality indicators and calculating their values 
from the data in medical databases, and, hence, it assists 
medical staffs and system engineers who manage medical 
databases to perform their own work and to collaborate on the 
evaluation and the comparison of medical services. 
Keywords - quality indicator, evaluation of medical service, 
ontology, medical database.

INTRODUCTION 
A. Background 
It is important to fairly evaluate or compare the qualities 
of medical services that hospitals provide in order to improve 
the services. To this end, the qualities of medical services 
must be identified and adequate methods must be found to 
measure these qualities accurately [1]. Quality indicators, 
which are quantitative criteria for the evaluation of medical 
services, have been attracting attention [2]. Many quality 
indicators already have been defined by standards 
organizations and projects such as IQIP [3], MHA [4], and 
OECD [5]. 
However, although many good quality indicators have 
been developed, the following issues remain for using 
quality indicators to fairly evaluate and compare medical 
services among hospitals. 
Issue 1: While many quality indicators (of medical 
services) are defined by terms in relation to medical care, 
many medical databases are developed from the aspect of 
accounting management. Moreover, many medical databases 
are developed in the vendors’ or hospitals’ own schema. 
Therefore, to calculate the values of quality indicators or to 
define them, it is often necessary for medical staffs to 
collaborate with system engineers who manage or developed 
the medical databases. However, the gaps in their knowledge 
and viewpoints often prevent them from collaborating to 
calculate the values of quality indicators and/or to define 
them accurately. 
Issue 2: Many words for medical services have meanings 
that differ according to the hospital or community of the 
medical staff. For example, at least in our country, the 
meaning of "new patients" or "inpatients" sometimes differs 
according to the medical staff in some hospitals, even though 
the hospitals may belong to the same hospital group. Such 
different interpretations of words also prevent medical staffs 
from coherently calculating accurate values of the quality 
indicators among multiple hospitals. 
B. Goal of this paper 
In this paper, we introduce a representation system of 
quality indicators. The representation system helps to define 
quality indicators and calculate their values in a coherent 
manner that is based on the data in medical databases. The 
representation system primarily consists of three parts. The 
first one is an ontology to define concepts related to medical 
services. The second one is a set of graphs that express the 
targets of quality indicators. We call these graphs “objective 
graphs”. The third one is a set of quantifying concepts that 
abstract the quantities of the subjects, which we call 
“quantifier concepts”. The proposed system represents a 
quality indicator as a combination of an objective graph and 
a quantifier concept.

An objective graph can be interpreted as a set of 
instances of a concept. The set is defined by the properties 
described by the labels of the arrows in the graph. We also 
explain the interpretation of objective graphs for the sets in 
this paper. 
C. Significance of the proposed system 
One can define quality indicators by constructing 
objective graphs and selecting quantifier concepts. Objective 
graphs consist of concepts in the ontology of medical 
services. Therefore, medical staffs can define quality 
indicators in the representation system without knowledge of 
medical databases. The interpretation of objective graphs 
enables one to calculate the value of a quality indicator 
described in the representation system based on a series of 
virtual tables generated from the ontology of medical 
services. Thus, by establishing the mapping between the 
virtual tables and the corresponding tables of the database, 
the values of quality indicators in the representation system 
can be calculated by using the data in the database. As a 
result, medical staffs and system engineers who manage 
medical databases can perform their own work; the former 
can focus on defining quality indicators and the latter on 
establishing mappings. 
By collaborating with medical staffs in other hospitals to 
develop the ontology of medical services and objective 
graphs, the gap between interpretations of quality indicators 
can be clarified, and, hence, the problems in the second issue 
(the use of words with different meanings) can be reduced. 
Moreover, the quantifier concepts define adequate "rates", 
"averages", and so forth in templates, and so they provide a 
coherent way to abstract quantities from the target concepts 
and prevent defining unreasonable quality indicators. 
D. Organization of this paper 
 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section II briefly explains our framework to define quality 
indicators and to calculate their values based on the data in 
medical databases. Section III explains the representation 
system of quality indicators. Section IV briefly explains a 
way to calculate the values of quality indicators based on 
the medical databases. Section V concludes this paper. 
II. 
FRAMEWORK TO DEFINE QUALITY INDICATORS AND 
CALCUATE THEIR VALUES 
The framework to define and calculate quality indicators 
consists of (i) a representation system to define quality 
indicators, (ii) medical databases (or medical data 
warehouses) that are used in hospitals, (iii) several mapping 
systems that connect a data model generated from the 
medical service ontology defined in the next section and the 
data models of given medical databases (see also Sec. IV), 
and (iv) an assistance tool that helps users (medical staffs) to 
construct quality indicators based on the representation 
system. By using the framework, medical staffs, system 
engineers and designers of concepts (or words) of medical 
services can perform their own work while collaborating on 
the evaluation and the comparison of medical services in the 
manner illustrated in Fig. 1. 
In this paper, we focus on the representation system of 
quality indicators. 
III. 
REPRESENTATION SYTEM OF QUALITY INDICATORS 
In this section, we define the three main components of 
the representation system of quality indicators: an ontology 
of medical services, objective graphs, and an ontology of 
quantifier concepts. 
A. Ontology of medical services 
The ontology of medical services is an ontology 
consisting of concepts related to medical services. Here, we 
define the ontology by defining its concepts and properties. 
(In ontology engineering, concepts are called classes, and 
properties in an ontology are often called roles or slots.) The 
ontology, which we define as follows, was developed based 
on an ontology developing tool called the “Semantic Editor” 
[6]. 
1) Conceptss 
We first define concepts in the medical service ontology. 
Because of space limitations, we define some main concepts 
only. We describe a concept by the [name of a concept]. The 
concepts below are indicated by brackets.  
1. Concepts of stakeholders: 
    [patient], [medical staff] 
2. Concepts of events 
2.1. Concepts of events with terms: 
 
[hospital stay], [hospital visit] 
    2.2. Concepts of events with no terms 
        2.2.1. Concepts of scheduled events: 
 
    [hospital admission], [hospital discharge], 
 
    [diagnosis], [medical examination], [test], 
 
    [operation], [prescription] 
        2.2.2. Concepts of unscheduled events: 
 
    [death], [bedsore], [falling] 
3. Concepts of states: 
    [state of age], [state of life or death], [state of disease]

4. Concepts of organizations: 
    [department], [facility], [hospital] 
5. Concepts of items: 
    [medicine], [clinical instrument], [medical device] 
6. Concepts of methods: 
    [method], [cure], [method of examination] 
7. Concepts of diseases: 
    [disease] 
8. Concept of time 
    8.1. Concepts of time points: 
 
[date], [clock time] 
    8.2. Concepts of terms: 
 
[number of years], [number of months], 
 
[number of weeks], [number of days] 
A concept can be regarded as a set of instances of a given 
concept. Thus, we often identify the concept [patient] with 
the set of instances of that patient. 
2) Properties 
The ontology has two types of properties: the first type is 
an attribute of a concept, and the second type is a relation 
between two concepts. 
a) Attributes of concepts 
In medical service ontology, the concepts of actors, events 
and states have their own attributes. As an example, we 
describe the attributes of state concepts in Fig. 2 and the 
attributes of event concepts in Fig. 6 on the last page of this 
paper, where yellow rounded rectangles denote concepts, 
and pink rounded rectangles denote attributes. 
 
 
b) Relations between concepts 
We define the primary relations between concepts. We 
describe a relation by name of a relation. Relations are 
denoted in the angled brackets.  
Relations of patients and events: The relations are 
defined between the [patient] and all event concepts. For 
example, the following relation denotes the relations between 
patients and their hospital stays. 
subject (of an event)  [patient]×[hospital stay]. 
Note that these relations share the same name “subject 
(of an event)”. We omit the explanation of the relations 
between patients and other events. 
Relations of patients and states: The relations are 
defined between the [patient] and all state concepts. For 
example, the following relation denotes the relationship 
between patients and their states of diseases. 
subject (of a state)  [patient]×[state of disease]. 
Note that these relations also share the same name 
“subject (of a state)” and that all concepts of states have the 
attributes of starting time points and terminating time points. 
We omit the explanation of the relations between patients 
and other states. 
Relations of time ordering: The relations are defined 
between the concepts of events and the states. For example, 
the following relations denote the relationships between 
operations. 
more than <p> before [operation]×[operation], 
less than <p> before [operation]×[operation], 
less than <p> after [operation]×[operation] and 
more than <p> after [operation]×[operation]. 
Here, “<p>” denotes a parameter. For example, the relation 
before more than <2 weeks> consists of a pair <op1, op2> 
if op1 and op2 are performed and if op1 is performed more 
than two weeks before op2.  
Belonging relations of events: The relations are defined 
between concepts of events with no term and events with 
terms. For example, the following relation denotes the 
relations between operations and hospital stays that have 
operations. 
belonging [operation]×[hospital stay]. 
The relation contains a pair (op, sty) of an event of an 
operation op and that of a hospital stay sty if op is performed 
in the duration of sty. 
B. Representation of objects of quality indicators 
In this subsection, we define a graph that represents a 
target of quantification based on the medical service 
ontology defined in the previous subsection. We call such a 
graph an “objective graph”. An objective graph is defined as 
a finite and labeled directed graph with a root node.  
1) Definition of objective graphs 
An objective graph
 consists of the five components 
(N( ), R( ), E( ), L( ), C ( )), where  
(i) N( ) is a set of nodes, 
(ii) R( ) is a root node, 
(iii) E( ) is a set of edges, 
(iv) L( ) is a label function on N( )E( ), and 
(v) C( ) is a concept. 
 
We define these components by induction on the 
structure of the node labels, as follows. 
Case 1. Assume that the following data are given: 
(a) concept C, 
(b) attributes A1,…, An of C, and  
(c) values a1,…, an of A1,…, An, respectively. 
Then, we define an objective graph
, as follows. 
(i)  N( ):={*0, …, *n},  
(ii) R( ):=*0,  
(iii) E( ):={f1,…,fn}, where each f i is an edge from *0 to 
*I, 
(iv)  L( )(*0):=C,  
 
L( )(*i):=ai for i =1,…, n, and,  
 
L( )(fi):=Ai  for i =1,…, n, and  
(v) C( ):=C. 
Note that if n=0, then N( ) is the singleton set {*0} and 
E( ) is the empty set. 
Case 2. Assume that the following data are given: 
(a) an integer n with n1,

(b) a set of objective graphs {
0, …, 
n}, 
(c) a set of relations {R1,…, Rn}, where each Ri is a 
relation between C(
i) and C(
0), 
(d) a set of integers {n(i,j)}0in,0jn and,  
(e) for each i with 0in and j with 0jn, the set of 
relations is {Ri,j
1,…, Ri,j
n(i,j)}, where each Ri,j
k is a relation 
between C(
i) and C(
j). (Note: if n(i,j)=0, the set {Ri,j
1,…, 
Ri,j
n(i,j)} is the empty set). 
Then, we define an objective graph , as follows. 
(i)  N( ):= {*0, …, *n}, 
(ii) R( ):= *0, 
(iii) E( ):={f 1,…, f n}(0in,0jn{f 
i,j
1,…, f 
i,j
n(i,j)}), 
where each f 
i is an edge from *i to *0 and each f i,j
k is an edge 
from *i to *j, 
(iv) L( )(*i):=
i  (i = 0,…, n), 
 
L( )(f i):=Ri  (i = 0,…, n) , 
 
L( )(f  j,i
k):= Ri,j
k  (i, j = 0,…, n and k = 1,…, n(i, j)), 
and 
(v) C( ):= C(
0). 
Each f i is called a main edge of 
 and each f i,j
k is called 
an optional edge of . 
2) Example of an objective graph 
We give an example of an objective graph. For example, 
let us consider the quality indicator “5-year stomach cancer 
survival rate”. The definition of the quality indicator is the 
ratio of the number of 5-year surviving patients to all 
stomach cancer patients, where a “stomach cancer patient” is 
a patient who had a diagnosis whose result was stomach 
cancer, and a “5-year surviving patient” is a patient who had 
a diagnosis whose result was stomach cancer but who is 
alive 5 years after that medical examination. Thus, we 
express the set of 5-year surviving patients in Fig.3. We first 
construct three objective graphs 
0, 
1, and 
2, as follows. 
(1) 
0 = ({*}, *,  (the empty set), L0, [patient]), where 
L0(*)=[patient]. 
(2)  
1 = ({*0, *1}, *1, {f1:*0→*1}, L1, [diagnosis]), 
where L1(*0) = [diagnosis], L1(*1) = stomach cancer, 
L1(f1) = resultand [diagnosis] denotes an event concept, 
stomach cancer denotes an instance of the concept of 
diseases, and resultdenotes an attribute of the concept 
[diagnosis]. Note that the range of resultis the concept of 
diseases. 
(3) 
2 = ({*0, *1}, *1, {f1:*0→*1}, L2, [state of life or 
death]), where L2(*0) = [state of life or death], L2(*1) = 
true, L2(f1) = survive, [state of life or death] denotes the 
viability status of a patient, stomach cancer denotes an 
instance of the concept of diseases, and resultdenotes an 
attribute of the concept [diagnosis]. Note that the range of 
resultis the concept of diseases. 
(1)
0=
 
(2) 
1=
 
(3) 
2=
 
We next construct an objective graph of “5-year 
surviving stomach cancer patients” , as follows. 
(i) N( ) = {*0, *1, *2}, 
(ii) R( ) =*0, 
(iii) E( ) = {f 1:*1→*0, f 2:*2→*0, f21:*2→*1}, 
(iv) L( )(*i) =
i (i = 0, 1, 2), 
 
L( )(f 1) = subject (of the event),
 
L( )(f 2) = subject (of the state),
 
L( )( f 21) = after more than <5 years>, and 
(v) C( ) = C(
0) = [patient]. 
Figure 3. 5-year surviving patients with stomach cancer (objective graph ) 
3) Segments of an objective graph 
In the following subsection (Sec. II.C), we interpret an 
objective graph 
 as a set that is obtained from C(
) by 
adding the conditions defined by L(
). We define an 
objective graph 
*, which is called a segment of 
 and 
which can be interpreted as a super set of a given objective 
graph , as follows.  
Case 1. If 
 is an objective graph defined in Case 1 of 
the definition of objective graphs, then graph 
* defined in 
the following properties is a segment of . 
(i)  N( *)  N( ), 
(ii) R( *) = R( ), 
(iii) E( *)  E( ), 
(iv) L( *) = L( )| N( *)E( *) (the restriction of L( ) to 
N(G*)E(G*)), and 
(v) C( *)= C( ). 
Here, for sets X and Y with Y X and for a function f on 
X, f|Y denotes the function of Y  that is defined by f|Y(y) := f(y) 
for all yY. We often refer to f|Y as the restriction of f  to Y. 
Case 2. Let  be an objective graph defined in Case 2 of 
the definition of objective graphs. Then, graph 
* defined in 
the following properties is a segment of . 
(i)  N( *)  N( ). 
(ii) R( *) = R( ). 
(iii) E( *)  E( ), where, for all *i N( *)\{*0}, the 
main edge from *i to *0 in E( ) is contained in E( *). Note 
that, for sets X, Y with YX, X\Y denotes the set {xX| xY}. 
(iv)  L( )(*i):= *i  for all *i N( *), where 
*i is a 
segment of 
i, 
 
L( )(f i):=Ri  for all  f i E( *) and  
 
L( )(f  j,i
k):= Ri,j
k  for all  f  j,i
k E( *). 
(v) C( *) = C( ). 
4) Example of a segment of an objective graph 
For the objective graph 
 in Fig. 3, the objective graph 
* in Fig. 4 is a segment of 
, which expresses the set of 
stomach cancer patients.

C. Values of objective graphs 
1) Definition of values of objective graphs 
    For an objective graph , we define a set [[ ]], as 
follows. 
Case 1. Let  be an objective graph defined in Case 1 of 
the definition of objective graphs. Then, 
[[ ]]:={cC | f1(c.A1)=a1  …  fn(c.An)=an  )}, where 
c.Ai is the value of the attribute Ai on c and the symbol  
denotes the logical connective symbol of “and.” 
Case 2. Let  be an objective graph defined in Case 2 of 
the definition of objective graphs. Then,  
[[ ]]:={x0[[
0]] | x1[[
1]],…,∃xn[[
n]]  
(i=1,…,n  Ri (xi, x0))(i,j=0,…,n (k=1,…, n(i,j)  R i,j
k (xi, xj)))}. 
Lemma. For an objective graph  and a segment 
* of ,  
[[ ]]  [[ *]]. 
Proof. One can easily show the lemma above by induction 
on the structure of . 
D. Quantifier concepts 
A quantifier concept plays a role in a function that has an 
objective graph and optional parameters as input data and 
that outputs a numerical value. In general, one can classify 
quantifier concepts into three types. In the following, we 
explain each type of quantifier concept. We describe a 
quantifier concept by name of a quantifier concept. Note 
that we often identify a concept with a set and that all sets 
are considered to be finite. 
a) Total numbers 
 
For a finite set S, the summation of numbers obtained 
from elements of S is called the total number of S. For 
example, if each element is assigned to 1 as the existence of 
the element, then the total number is the same as the 
cardinality of S. The quantifier concept cardinality is 
regarded as a function that has an objective graph 
 as input 
data and that outputs the cardinality of [[ ]]. 
 
For a concept S, attributes A1,, An of S, and the real-
valued function f on the set of values of instances of S with 
respect to A1,, An, the summation sS  f(s.A1,..., s.An) is 
called the total attribute number of S with respect to A1,…, 
An and f, where s.Ai denotes the value of an instance s with 
respect to Ai, is an attribute quantifier function. 
    The quantifier concept total attribute number is 
regarded as a function that has the following data as input 
data: 
1. 
an objective graph ,  
2. 
attributes A1,..., An of C( ), and 
3. 
f: C1...Cn→ , where Ci := {s.Ai | s[[ ]]}. 
total attribute number outputs the total attribute number 
of [[ ]] with respect to A1,..., An and f. 
b) Rate 
For a finite set S and a subset S* of S, the rate of the total 
number of S* among the total numbers of S obtained in the 
same way as that to calculate the total number of S* is called 
a rate of S* among S. In particular, the rate of the cardinality 
of S* among that of S is called the cardinality rate of S* 
among S. Moreover, the rate of the total attribute number of 
S* with respect to A1,..., An and f among that of S with 
respect to the same attributes and the same attribute 
quantifier function is called the total attribute number rate. 
    The quantifier concept cardinality rate is regarded as 
a function that has the following data as input data: 
1. 
an objective graph , and  
2. 
a segment * of . 
In contrast, the quantifier concept total attribute number 
rate is regarded as a function that has the following data as 
input data: 
1. 
an objective graph , 
2. 
a segment * of , 
3. 
attributes A1,..., An of C( ), and 
4. 
f: C1...Cn→ , where Ci := {s.Ai | s[[ ]]}. 
total attribute number rate outputs the rate of the total 
attribute number of [[ ]] with respect to A1,..., An and f 
among that of [[ *]] with respect to the same attributes and 
the same attribute quantifier function. 
c) Average 
For concept S, attributes A1,..., An of S, and attribute 
quantifier function f, the ratio of the total attribute number of 
S with respect to A1,..., An and f and the cardinality of S is 
called the average of the value of S with respect to A1,..., An 
of f. The quantifier concept cardinality rate is regarded as 
a function that has the same input data as that of total 
attribute number and that outputs the average of the value 
of S with respect to A1,..., An of f. 
E. Examples of quality indicators in the representation 
system 
A quality indicator can be represented as a combination 
of an objective graph and a quantifier concept. In this 
subsection, we describe one of the typical quality indicators 
“stomach cancer 5-year survival rate” with objective graphs 
and a quantifier concept. This indicator is defined to be the 
rate of the number of patients diagnosed with stomach cancer 
surviving 5 years after diagnosis among the number of 
patients diagnosed with stomach cancer. Thus, the numerator 
and the denominator of the indicator can be described to be 
objective graphs 
 and * in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, respectively. 
Thus, one can describe the quality indicator by using 
, 
*, 
and the quantifier concept cardinality rate as the graph in 
Fig. 5 on the next page. 
IV. 
CALCULATION OF VALUES OF QUALITY INDICATORS 
BASED ON MEDICAL DATABASES 
In this section, we briefly explain how to calculate the 
values of quality indicators described in the representation 
system by using medical databases. One can obtain an entity-
relationship model [7] from the medical service ontology in 
Sec. III.A by translating the main concepts to entities and the 
properties between them to the relationship between entities 
obtained from the given concepts. Moreover, by translating 
the attributes of a main concept to those of the entity 
translated from the concept, one can obtain a relational data 
model, which we call the global data model (GDM) of 
medical service ontology.

eTELEMED 2012 : The Fourth International Conference on eHealth, Telemedicine, and Social Medicine

By the interpretation of Sec. III.C, one can perform a 
query on the GDM from a given objective graph 
 by 
translating the condition of [[ ]] in a way based on relational 
calculus [8], since the condition of [[ ]] is defined as a 
formula in first-order logic on the concepts and properties, 
and all properties are simple so that one can translate them to 
queries on the GDM automatically. Therefore, for a given 
medical database MD, if one has a suitable mapping between 
the data model on the MD and the GDM, one can 
automatically calculate the value of quality indicators based 
on the data in the MD. 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
It is important to describe quality indicators that have no 
ambiguity of interpretation and to calculate their values 
accurately in a coherent way. In this paper, we introduce a 
representation system of quality indicators, which consists of 
(i) an ontology of medical services, (ii) objective graphs to 
represent the subjects of quantification and interpretation of 
objective graphs as sets, and (iii) quantifier concepts. We 
also briefly explain the whole image of our framework to 
define quality indicators and to calculate their values and a 
way to calculate the values of quality indicators based on the 
medical databases. The proposed representation system plays 
a central role in the framework and assists the specialization 
of jobs of the medical staffs, who evaluate their medical 
services, and the system engineers, who develop or manage 
medical databases, and the collaboration between them.
