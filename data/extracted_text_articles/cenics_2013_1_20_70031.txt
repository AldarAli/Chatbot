Abstract—In this paper, we elaborate on the dimensioning
of the ultra low voltage gate with keeper. We compare the
gate conﬁguration to ULV5 and demonstrate the potential and
weaknesses of the new gate conﬁguration with the keeper.
We also pinpoint the crucial signal paths (mainly regarding
the clock drivers) while also providing an overview of the
propagation through a chain of gates.

I. INTRODUCTION
For decades, technology has been driven by scaling the
size of the transistor. We have evolved a fabrication process
to reduce the size from several micrometres (µm ) to tens of
nanometres (nm). The heart of technology is the transistor
and it has been one of the key components that has allowed
the plethora of portable electronic gadgets that enrich our
everyday lives. Unfortunately, millions of transistor chips
fabricated using modern processes suffer from very low
yields (<50%) [1]. Meanwhile, the consumer market has
dramatically increased demand for sophisticated portable
electronics, such as handheld computers and smart-phones.
Portable electronics drive the need for low power and low
voltage due to a limited budget set by a ﬁxed maximum
battery mass. Soon, we will see research toward embedded
circuits in human bodies and the need to harvest energy
will become more evident. Several approaches exist to lower
the energy consumption. One of the most fundamental and
effective approaches is to lower the supply voltage [2], [3],
[4]. When the supply voltage is reduced to hundreds of
millivolts, it is known as Ultra Low Voltage (ULV) [5],
[6]. However, scaling of the supply-voltage has an adverse
effect on the speed of operation of the design. The main
challenge is to obtain high speed at supply-voltages that
are as low as possible. To maintain good response times
at ultra low supply voltages, the threshold voltages of the
transistors must also be reduced [7]. Unfortunately, this
requires a change to the CMOS fabrication process. The
multiple-Vdd technique has been proposed for low voltage
high performance circuit designs [8] without the need to
change the fabrication process. Floating-Gates (FG) have
also been proposed for ULV and Low Power (LP) logic
[9]. Unfortunately, modern processes face signiﬁcant gate

leakage due to the thin oxide. A ULV ﬂoating-gate inverter
employing a frequent recharge technique has shown good
properties for achieving high speed at ultra low voltages [10]
Even though the ULV gate has shown good performance it
also has limitations, due the leakage at the semi-ﬂoating-
gates (SFG). A differential ULV gate has been proposed
which includes a keeper function [11]; it is argued to have
the speed of an ULV but the stability of a standard CMOS
gate.
In this paper, we elaborate more on the attributes of the
ULV gate and its modiﬁcation to resemble a precharge logic.
Furthermore, we discuss the inclusion of a keeper transistor
that enables reduction of the static power consumption. The
main aim of this paper is to evaluate the advantages and
reliability that the modiﬁcation allows in terms of delay re-
sponse, transistor matching and power consumption. We also
discuss secondary effects such as clock driver dimensioning.
The structure of this paper is as follows: in Section II, the
ULV5 and the keeper transistor modiﬁcation of the ULV
structure are presented. In Section III, a discussion of the
results achieved is given. Finally, the paper concludes by

results demonstrated throughout this paper were obtained
using a simulation produced in a TSMC 90 nm process
environment provided by Cadence.
II. ULTRA LOW VOLTAGE GATE WITH KEEPER
The ULV gates have been presented in ﬁve evolution
steps, from ULV1 to ULV5 [12], [13]. The most recent
modiﬁcation of ULV5 is presented in [12], with an additional
improvement made by adding a keeper transistor to the
evaluation transistor in the N- and P-domino logic gates. The
ULV5 without the keeper transistor is illustrated in Figure
1, while modiﬁcation of the gate with the keeper transistor
is illustrated in Figure 2. The keeper transistors (KEn and
KEp) are highlighted in gray. Considering Figure 2(a), the
transistor KEn would contribute to weaken the pull-down
transistor (En) when the output (Vout) is to be kept high (Vdd).
The signal ﬂow for a precharge 1 domino inverter with the
keeper transistors would be as follows, for input with:
(a) Non-transition - The output is to be kept high. The
KEn would be turned off, the gate of Pp would be
low (0) and hence Vout is held high through Pp to Vdd
. The feedback from the keeper transistor KEn would
pull the ﬂoating-gate at the input of En to the source
of the KEn, which, at the time, would be 0 (φ= 0).
Given time, the keeper transistor KEn would turn the
En completely off and moreover signiﬁcantly lower the
static power consumption during the evaluation period.
(b) Positive transition - The output would, as a result of
the input transition, be pulled towards 0 through the
En-transistor. As the output Vout decreases, the feedback
keeper KPp-transistor would increasingly turn on and
contribute to the shut-down of the pull-up transistor Pp.

In turn, this would increase the speed of pulling Vout
to 0. The more Vout is lowered, the weaker the keeper
transistor KEn contribution to the ﬂoating-gate at the
En.
The main improvement made by adding the keeper tran-
sistor is the signiﬁcant decrease of static power consumption.
This is primarily due to the shut-down of the evaluation
transistor, which competes with the precharge transistor
during the evaluation period for a non-transition input.
The current consumption during a clock cycle for a non-
transition input for both the ULV5 and the ULV5 with keeper
conﬁgurations is shown in Figure 3. The simulation results
show that the keeper conﬁguration has a current dissipation
factor approximately 10,000 times lower through the En.

Figure 5.
Parametric simulation with changes based on the width
of the precharge transistors. The plot shows the evaluation period
for a ULV5 (without keeper), and its ability to hold the output (Vout)
for the case of a non-transition at the input (Section II(a)).
During the precharge period, the current dissipations are
different due to the starting point of the ﬂoating-gates and
the speciﬁc DC voltage at the output Vout. For a positive
input transition the current dispassion is equal, hence the
high speed of the gate is ensured. The simulation result for
the gate with a positive transition is shown in Figure 4.
The ULV5 with keeper conﬁguration is therefore a great im-
provement in terms of static power, while all other beneﬁcial
attributes are maintained compared with standard CMOS. In
the following section, we are to elaborate on the details of
the different elements within the gate. We aim to analyse
which dimension gives the best overall effect.

plot is based on the same simulation environment as for the ULV5
without the keeper, shown in Figure 5.
III. SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We start by elaborating on the effect of the capacitive
input to the gates. The dimension of the input capacitance
(Ci) directly affects the gate by attenuating the transition
(the input voltage swing) and thus increasing the delay. The
lower Ci is, the more signiﬁcant the role the parasitic gate-
capacitances play. The higher Ci is, the higher the load
(CL) that is required to burden the previous gate. Therefore,
there should be a trade-off between the amount of parasitic
capacitance and the load. Our parametric simulation for the
gate with keeper conﬁguration considering parameterisation
of Ci is shown in Table II, with focus on the gate delay.
From the table, we have chosen to use a 2.5 fF input
capacitance. The input capacitance for the N- and P-domino
gates has different input gates, hence nMOS and pMOS;
therefore considerations must be made regarding matching
of the nMOS and pMOS transistors for both evaluation and
precharge. Transistor matching for the nMOS and pMOS
for these low supply voltages (Vdd) has different mobility
abilities. Matching of the nMOS and pMOS for a standard
CMOS inverter is shown in Table II. The dimensions of
the evaluation transistors are preferably kept at a minimum,
especially concerning matching of the Ci. This leads to
the dimensioning of the precharge transistors, hence these
directly affect the matching of the evaluation-transistors and
the precharge through relative values. The other side-effect
of changing the precharge transistors is the fact that the

precharge delay would be either longer or shorter. The delay
in precharge (isolated) is of no concern due to the fact
that we can use a skew clocking strategy, and the only
aspect of importance is the DC value of the level, either
Vdd or ground. The other consideration when dimensioning
the precharge-transistors is their ability to hold the signal.
This is of particular importance for the ULV5 conﬁguration.
As shown in Figure 5, the larger the width of the precharge
transistor the better, and the longer it holds the output value
in the case of a non-transition. For the ULV5 with the keeper
conﬁguration, shown in Figure 6, we see that holding of
the value is of no concern. We would particularly like to
stress the fact that a ULV5 with keeper can actually have
a conﬁguration with width of the precharge transistor as
small as 100 nm. In this case, we are able to lower the
area consumption for an overall perspective. One potential
issue which needs to be addressed is that, contrary to

CMOS domino logic, the clock signals (drivers) play a more
dominant role. The clock signals are not only connected to
the gate node of the transistors, but also to the drain/source
of the evaluation transistors, speciﬁcally to the En, Ep, KEn
and KEp transistors. Hence the clock drivers must be strong
enough to not become a bottleneck for the evaluation. The
most crucial path is for the En and Ep. In Figure 9, the
critical path is shown in red. In the case shown in Figure
9(a), of an evaluation for a positive transition at the input,
the evaluation transistor En must pull the output Vout down to
ground. The critical path shows that the nMOS of the clock
driver has a bottleneck issue; it must be large enough to
pull through all the current dissipation and at the same time
not increase the overall power dissipation. Our simulation
results indicate that the optimal size for the nMOS width of
the clock-driver is 4.0µm , with a length of 200 nm. The
pMOS is kept minimum, thus the pull-up and pull-down of
the clock driver is skew matched. Figure 7 shows the effect
of the delay of the gate with regard to the increase in the
width, while in Figure 8 illustrates the power consumption
through the same node. Figure 10 and Figure 11 show the
energy (PDP) and the EDP, respectively.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have elaborated on the matching and di-
mensioning of different elements of the ULV gate. We have
demonstrated the potential improvement concerning static
power dissipation of the ULV5 with keeper conﬁguration
compared with the unmodiﬁed ULV5. Furthermore, we have
discussed the importance of the clock drivers dimensions. In
particular, we have considered the issue of bottlenecks for
