Abstract—OSC (Orthogonal Sub Channel) is an enhancement 
for the GSM voice service. It provides up to double capacity in 
the radio interface with the same hardware compared to the 
GSM Half Rate (HR) mode. This paper investigates the effects 
of OSC on the capacity utilization as a function of the OSC 
capable handset penetration. The variation of the radio net-
work capacity is studied by taking into account the division of 
the time slot usage between HR and OSC capable terminals, 
which depends on the OSC capable handset penetration. The 
achievable capacity gain is studied by investigating the block-
ing rate behavior. In addition, a set of test cases was carried 
out in a GSM network in order to evaluate the radio perform-
ance of OSC in terms of the carrier per noise level. The tests 
were performed in a noise-limited indoor environment, and the 
quality and received power level distributions were analyzed. 
Based on the post-processing and analysis of the performance 
data as a function of the OSC penetration, a generic model to 
estimate the effect of OSC on the GSM capacity gain was 
developed. The model utilizes the network statistics and 
performance indicators of GSM, and provides an estimate of 
the possible OSC gains in the investigated regions before the 
OSC feature is actually activated.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The capacity utilization is one of the most important 
optimization items of the GSM radio interface. The recently 
developed Dual Half Rate (DHR) functionality can be con-
sidered as a major step in the 2G evolution path. OSC 
(Orthogonal Sub Channel) is a solution for offering the pair-
ing of two separate users into a single HR (Half Rate) time 
slot resource in such a way that no hardware enhancements 
are needed in the network side. OSC utilizes a SAIC (Single 
Antenna Interference Cancellation) functionality of the al-
ready existing handsets, which means that OSC provides a 
SAIC penetration dependent capacity gain as soon as it is 
activated via a software update of the Base Transceiver Sta-
tions (BTS) and Base Station Controllers (BSC) of the GSM 
radio network. 
Based on  [1], this paper presents an extended analysis of 
the OSC gain as a function of SAIC handset penetration, and 
complements the analysis by investigating further the radio 
performance analysis presented in  [2]. These results are 
processed in order to form a complete OSC gain model that 
consists of the predicted effect on the capacity and radio per-
formance of GSM voice calls. 
During the evolution of the circuit switched (CS) domain 
of GSM, there have been various capacity enhancement 
methods applied in the networks like Dynamic Frequency 
and Channel Allocation  [3], Adaptive Multi Rate codecs  [4] 
and Frequency Hopping (FH)  [5]. Also several other solu-
tions have been proposed, although these are still under 
development, like multiple beam smart antennas  [6]. At the 
moment, though, one of the most concrete ways that provide 
with a notable capacity effect is the SAIC concept. There are 
various studies available presenting the respective benefit in 
different environments  [7] [8] [9] [10]. 
The first DHR deployments are based on the OSC func-
tionality that has been evaluated and standardized by 3GPP 
GERAN  [11] [12] [13] [14]. It utilizes SAIC and provide 
capacity enhancement without need for modifications to the 
already existing new mobile station generation. 
Despite of the availability of various studies about the 
SAIC gain, the capacity behavior in a typical OSC network 
deployment is not clear. This paper presents thus an analysis 
of the effect of OSC on the offered capacity by investigating 
the benefits, e.g., in terms of the utilization and possibility 
for the reduction of the transceivers as a part of the frequency 
re-farming between GSM and other technologies such as 
HSPA (High Speed Packet Access) and LTE (Long Term 
Evolution). Based on realistic radio measurements in an in-
door environment, this paper also investigates the effective 
proportion of the coverage area where OSC can be utilized. 
The GSM HR mode is selected as a reference for the 
investigations as it is assumed to be available in a typical 
environment. The capacity gain of OSC is obviously lower in 
the cell edge where the network dependent algorithm 
switches the OSC first to the HR mode and eventually to the 
FR (Full Rate) mode assuming that Adaptive Multi Rate 
(AMR) functionality is utilized. This paper investigates the 
capacity effect of OSC together with the impacts on the radio 
quality, which together forms a complete prediction model 
for the OSC gain as a function of the OSC penetration. 
First, a brief overview to the principles and functionality 
of OSC is given in Section II. Then, a theoretical analysis of

the capacity behavior of OSC is presented in Section III. The 
analysis shows the mapping of the estimated OSC penetra-
tion value in the actual usage of the Time Slots (TSL) for 
OSC and GSM Half-Rate (HR) modes. Then, the effect of 
OSC is investigated on the variation of the offered traffic, 
which gives possibility to estimate either the reduction of the 
already deployed capacity (transceiver units, TRX) or, which 
gives time for the postponing of the future hardware capacity 
additions yet maintaining the original or lower blocking rate 
of the GSM cell. The effects of OSC on the radio perform-
ance are investigated in Section IV, which provides informa-
tion about the usability of OSC within the coverage area. The 
field tests carried out in this section are based on the noise-
limited indoor environment, but the results can be extended 
also to the outdoor. Based on Sections III and IV, the com-
plete model is proposed in Section V. The input of the model 
is based on the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) of GSM. 
The output predicts the effect of OSC on the respective OSC 
coverage compared to the GSM HR (Half Rate) mode as a 
function of the OSC penetration. Finally, Section VI presents 
the conclusions of the work. 
II. 
THE FUNCTIONALITY AND USABILITY OF OSC 
GSM technology is globally most widely deployed cellu-
lar mobile communication system. In emerging markets, the 
increase trend of new-developed subscribers and consequent 
voice traffic explosion creates a great pressure on network 
operators, especially for those operators that need to provide 
service to a large population with only limited bandwidth. In 
mature markets, GSM frequencies are being re-farmed to 
UMTS and LTE in order to provide a national-wide mobile 
broadband service with a limited investment and better qual-
ity; this action will squeeze GSM bandwidth and increase 
demand over GSM technology to achieve higher capacity 
and spectrum efficiency, so as to maintain the current traffic 
volumes and user experience. Furthermore, considering that 
the Average Revenue per User (ARPU) continues decreas-
ing, most operators are facing the challenge of improving 
their hardware utilization efficiency. 
In order to cope with the scenarios outlined above, some 
possible solutions are brought up. Among them, one of the 
most promising proposals is the OSC feature, a voice capac-
ity enhancement for the GSM networks. OSC is standardized 
in 3GPP, and the first live network OSC trials have been 
carried out in 2010. OSC is backwards compatible solution 
with the original TDMA frame structure of GSM, exploiting 
the single 200 kHz frame bandwidth by multiplexing more 
users to its 8 physical time slots. The OSC DHR (Dual Half 
Rate) mode utilizes a single physical TSL for up to four us-
ers compared to the HR mode that can multiplex two users 
within the same TSL, or only one user in the FR (Full Rate) 
mode. 
In Downlink (DL), OSC DHR distinguishes between two 
independent GSM users sharing the same HR resource by 
interpreting the 8-level GMSK modulation as two separate 
QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) modulation dia-
grams in such a way that the users form pairs within the HR 
TSL as presented in FIGURE 1.

FIGURE 1. Two separate OSC DHR users can be multiplexed in DL via 
the pairing based on the QPSK constellation. 
 
As presented in FIGURE 2, a MUD (Multi-User Detection) 
receiver is used in Uplink (UL) in order to identify two users 
sharing the same physical time slot, and the separation of the 
users is handled via different training sequences  [11]. This 
requires antenna diversity in the GSM base station with 
MUD functionality  [9]. The applied Multiple-Input, Multi-
ple-Output (MIMO) concept gives benefits especially in 
Rayleigh fading channel  [12]. A GMSK modulation is used 
in UL.

As FIGURE 3 indicates, the TSL division for the OSC and 
HR calls can be estimated to be 1:2 in case of 50% OSC 
penetration, i.e., OSC utilizes 1/3 of the physical TSL re-
sources in this case. 
When the radio conditions are ideal, i.e., there are no 
restrictions from the radio network side in the usage of the 
TSL for OSC DHR, HR or FR calls, it is thus possible to fit 2 
times more OSC DHR calls into the same TSL compared to 
HR calls. 
The following analysis shows the more detailed division 
of the TSL utilization for the OSC DHR and HR users as a 
function of the OSC penetration, assuming that the network 
supports both modes in the normal operation. 
III. 
EFFECT OF OSC ON CAPACITY 
This analysis shows the behavior of the GSM cell capac-
ity when both GSM HR and OSC DHR users are found in 
the area. More specifically, the distribution of the HR and 
OSC users in the same cell is studied as a function of the 
OSC capable SAIC mobile station penetration. The capacity 
enhancement is shown between the extreme values, i.e., 
when only HR users are found, and when the cell is popu-
lated with OSC users, in a fully loaded cell. 
In the scenarios presented in this paper, it is assumed that 
the functionality of the OSC is ideal, i.e., it is transparent for 
the existing HR traffic, and that there is no impact of the 
feature on the previous functionality of the network. It 
should be noted that this analysis concentrates purely on the 
radio interface time slot capacity, and does not consider the 
effects of the feature on the radio link budget. The assump-
tion of these calculations is thus the presence of a coverage 
area where the quality and received power levels are suffi-
ciently high for the functioning of the OSC. 
The benefit of OSC is obvious in a fully loaded network 
where major part of the GSM Mobile Stations (MS) is OSC 
capable. The presented investigations are divided into three 
scenarios: The effect of OSC DHR on the TSL distribution in 
a fully loaded cell, on the number of users per TSL, and on 
the blocking rate, which can result the possibility to reduce 
TRX units from the GSM sites. 
A fully loaded cell can be taken as a basis for the study. 
The assumption is that both HR and OSC capable users are 
uniformly distributed over the investigated area. This means 
that the OSC capable MS penetration equals to the probabil-
ity of the OSC MS entering to the cell, the rest of the MSs 
entering to the cell utilizing the HR mode. It should be noted 
that the term HR refers to a MS that is capable of utilizing 
both HR and FR modes. 
When the OSC feature is activated in the GSM network, 
the total number of users, i.e., Mobile Stations that are di-
stributed in the investigated area, is a mix of OSC DHR users 
and GSM HR users:

The amount of the OSC users depends on the OSC capa-

The total number of physical TSLs is divided to the TSLs

The formula contains physical TSLs for OSC and HR. As 
a single OSC TSL can be utilized by a total of 4 OSC users, 
we can present the relationship between the TSL and the 
number of the users in the following way:

Equally, a total of 2 HR users can utilize the TSL, which

FIGURE 4 clarifies the idea of the notation. In this specific 
case, the OSC user penetration α is 12 / 22 = 55%, and the 
physical TSL utilization for OSC users is 3/8. 
Assuming that the users are distributed uniformly in the 
coverage area, the utilization of the TSLs depends on the 
OSC penetration. The following analysis represents the best 
case scenario of a number of HR MSs, which is multiple of 2 
and a number of OSC MSs, which is multiple of 4 so that no 
TSL is occupied by less than 4 OSC MSs or less that 2 HR 
MSs.

Similarly, we can express the total number of MSs that 
can be served as a function of the total number of available 
TSLs and the OSC penetration coefficient. 
Let's then introduce β with {β∈ℝ|0≤β≤1}, which gives 
the percentage of the physical TSLs occupied for the OSC 
users. The analysis can be carried further and we can write:

FIGURE 5. The TSL utilization for the OSC and HR calls as a function 
of the OSC penetration. 
 
One point of interest of FIGURE 5 is the SAIC handset 
penetration of 50%, which indicates that the OSC paired 
connections utilize 33% of the physical TSL capacity of the 
cell, the rest being occupied by HR users. Another point of 
interest is the breaking point where both HR and OSC utilize 
the same amount of TSLs. The graph shows that it is found 
at 67% of OSC penetration. 
It should be noted that the calculation is valid within the 
functional coverage area where OSC can be used, i.e., where 
the received power level is high enough. For the areas out-
side the OSC coverage, HR and FR modes are assumed to 
function normally with their respective ranges of received 
power levels indicated in  [15]. 
B. The effect of OSC on the number of users per TSL 
As the number of the OSC and HR users is known as a 
function of α, we can create a function that expresses the 
usage of a single TSL in terms of the number of users served. 
It is clear that the values of the served users oscillates within 
the range of [2, 4], lowest value indicating 100% HR, and 
highest value representing the 100% DHR OSC penetration. 
The number of the users per TSL in a cell that contain 
mixed HR and OSC users can be obtained by utilizing (10) 
and (11):

FIGURE 6 shows the number of users per TSL as a function 
of the OSC penetration α. As can be noted, the extreme value 
of 4 is a result of OSC penetration of 100%. 
As an example, the 50% OSC penetration level provides 
an offered capacity for about 2.67 users (which is a mix of 
OSC and HR users in average) per timeslot. It is again as-
sumed that the OSC functionality can be utilized over the 
whole investigated area, meaning that the cell border area of 
the GSM coverage is not considered in this analysis.

C. The effect of OSC on blocking rate 
The original situation of the fully occupied cell with only 
HR users present, i.e., when OSC is not activated, can be 
taken as a reference also for the following analysis. Assum-
ing that the blocking rate of the GSM HR cell in busy hour is 
B, we can estimate its change via the well-known Erlang B 
 [16] after OSC has been activated:

Term B is the blocking rate (% of the blocked calls com-
pared to the number of whole attempts), N is the available 
amount of time slots, and A is the product of the average call 
density and average time of reservation, i.e., the offered load. 
As it is not possible to solve the equation of offered traf-
fic analytically, it can be utilized in a recursive format:

Furthermore, the offered traffic (Erl) can be expressed as: 
 
)
1(
B
A
x
−
⋅
=
 
(17) 
 
We can establish a reference case with OSC 0% in the 
following way. The B(N)[OSC = 0%] can be set to 2%. This 
means that, e.g., in the case of 7 traffic TSLs for FR GSM, 
the respective offered load A = 2.94 Erl and the offered traf-
fic is x = 2.88 Erl. The proportion of the offered traffic over 
the whole timeslot capacity x  / TSLtot = 0.41 Erl/TSL. If HR 
codec is utilized, there is double the amount of users served 
within the same TSL number. This can be expressed in Erlag 
B formula by marking the available radio resources as 14, 
which results A = 8.21 Erl and x = 8.04 Erl. The x  / TSLtot 
is now 1.15 Erl/TSL, i.e., FR TSL. The difference between 
these figures shows the Erlag B plus HR gain, i.e., the more 
there is available capacity, the more efficiently the calls can 
be delivered with the same blocking rate. 
When the OSC functionality is activated and the same 
blocking rate is maintained, the available resources with the 
same hardware is now 4·7 = 28 for the B(N)[OSC = 100%], 
i.e., when α = 1. The x  is now 19.75, and the efficiency 2.82 
Erl/TSL, i.e., FR TSL. This shows one of the benefits of 
OSC as it increases clearly the capacity efficiency via the 
Erlang B gain if the same amount of hardware is maintained. 
If instead the amount of users is kept the same, the addi-
tional capacity that is liberated via the more efficient usage 
of TSLs via OSC can be removed partially or totally. This 
provides the basis for 3G re-farming if the operator has both 
2G and 3G licenses. 
With a lower amount of timeslots, the same number of 
users can still be served with the same or lower blocking rate 
like FIGURE 6 indicates. The blocking rate depends on the us-
age of the TSLs for OSC, i.e., on β, which can be expressed 
as a function of α as shown in (13). 
D. The effect of OSC on the TSL and TRX reduction 
It is possible to investigate the dependency of the number 
of users and Erlang B formula's offered traffic as a function 
of the OSC penetration. In order to carry out this part of the 
study, an Erlang B table was created by utilizing (15) and 
(16). 
A case example with a blocking rate of 2.0% was se-
lected. A table of 1−200 TSLs was created as a basis for the 
analysis. FIGURE 7 summarizes the behavior of the channel 
utilization. It can be seen that the performance of the cell 
increases due to the Erlang B gain, along with the OSC pene-
tration growth compared to the original proportion of the HR 
capable users.

penetration on the total reduction of the time slot number is 
presented. The calculation can be made by assuming that the 
offered traffic level x and the call blocking rate B are main-
tained in the original level. 
FIGURE 8 summarizes the analysis carried out for 20−100 
Erl of offered traffic. FIGURE 8 can be interpreted in such a 
way that when the OSC penetration grows, the needed num-
ber of TSLs with the same blocking rate (originally 2%) is 
now lower. 
According to the basic behavior of the Erlang B model, 
the effect is logically strongest for the higher capacity cells. 
This can be noted especially from the highest investigated 
offered traffic class of 100 Erl, which requires only half of 
the timeslots when OSC penetration is 100%. 
The effect of OSC can be seen in FIGURE 9, which shows 
the analysis for the required number of TRXs for a set of 
offered traffic classes (Erl) when the OSC capable SAIC 
handset penetration is known.

FIGURE 9. The effect of the OSC penetration on the required amount of 
TRXs when the blocking rate B is kept the same (2%). 
The assumption in this case is that each TRX contains 8 
traffic channels. It is now possible to interpret the benefit of 
OSC in terms of the transceiver units. Table I summarizes 
the calculation as a function of TRX number. 
 
 
 
TABLE 1 indicates that the benefit of OSC starts to be 
significant when the original BTS contains at least 4 TRX 
elements (per sector or in omni-radiating site). In that case, 
already a relatively low OSC penetration of 25% provides a 
possibility to remove a complete TRX element (i.e., one fre-
quency block of 200 kHz) from the cell, yet still keeping the 
blocking rate below or the same as was observed originally, 
which is 2% in this example. If this capacity is removed, it 
can be utilized for the re-farming of 3G frequencies. Alterna-
tively, if no TRX units are removed, the offered capacity can 
be utilized more efficiently for parallel packet data via the 
lower circuit switched call blocking rate. There are thus 
various different network evolution scenarios available due 
to OSC. 
FIGURE 10 summarizes the amount of TRXs (assuming that 
each offers 8 physical traffic TSLs) that can be removed 
from the site depending on the OSC penetration and the of-
fered traffic in such a way that the blocking rate would not 
change from the original 2 % figure. It should be noted that a 
small part of the TSLs are used also for signaling, and that 
each TRX unit is a physical 8-TSL equipment, so only inte-
ger values rounded up should be considered in the interpreta-
tion of the number of TRXs.

The presented analysis provide a base for the GSM net-
work re-dimensioning in the following scenarios: 
1) In the case of still growing GSM traffic, the estimation 
of the already existing penetration of SAIC terminals when 
the OSC feature is activated, as well as the prediction of the 
SAIC penetration development within the forthcoming years 
gives a possibility to adjust the radio capacity plans. This 
means that the otherwise required TRX extensions can be 
postponed or rejected as long as the blocking rate can be 
maintained in the allowed level with OSC. 
2) In the case of stabilized or lower GSM traffic, the 
same blocking rate can be maintained with a lower amount 
of the TRX units. This liberated bandwidth can be reused for 
the delivery of the growing 3G traffic in the same frequency 
band, if available for the operator, which makes the fre-
quency re-farming more fluent with OSC. 
IV. 
OSC RADIO PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS 
A. Methodology for the analysis 
The laboratory environment consisted of Base Station 
Sub system (BSS) and Network and Switching Sub-system 
(NSS) with functional elements (Base Transceiver Station 
BTS, Base station Controller BSC, Mobile Switching Centre 
MSC and Home Location Register HLR) as shown in FIGURE 
11. The Abis interface was based on the IP emulation. The 
BTS was located in Madrid, Spain, and BSC in Finland. The 
voice calls were established only within the test network. 
Discontinuous Transmission (DTX) and Frequency Hopping 
(FH) were disabled during the measurement data collection.

FIGURE 11. The laboratory setup consisted of a functional GSM 
network with a single radio cell. 
 
The test network consisted of one cell in the indoors. The 
link budget was dimensioned by using adjustable attenuators 
and minimal TRX output power, which resulted in a cell ra-
dius of about 40 meters. The indoor radio propagation condi-
tions provided nearly line of sight, with light wall obstacles. 
This setup represents a noise-limited environment within the 
whole functional received power level range of GSM. 
For the evaluation of the radio performance, the quality 
level Q and received power level PRX were correlated and 
stored in Slow Associated Control Channel (SACCH) frame 
intervals of 480 ms during the active voice calls. The corre-
lated Qn values with n = 0...7 and PRXm categories with m = 
0...5 were collected to a matrix. TABLE 2 presents the equiva-
lence of the Q levels and bit error rate (BER), and TABLE 3 
shows the PRX categories in terms of dBm ranges  [15]. 
The values for the Carrier-to-Noise ratio (C/N) are based 
on the thermal noise level and terminal's noise figure. The 
value for the noise floor can be estimated by applying the 
formula:

where kB is Boltzmann's constant (1.38·10-23 J/K), T is the 
temperature (290 K is assumed) and B is the bandwidth in 
Hz. For a single GSM frequency channel of 200 kHz, the 
thermal noise level is thus −120.98 dBm. The values of TABLE 
3 contain also the receiver noise power of about 3 dB, result-
ing in total noise level N of −118 dBm. 
The OSC functionality was set up to the BTS and BSC 
by utilizing non-commercial R&D software. DHR mode of 
OSC was utilized in a single TSL with minimally correlating 
training sequences. 
 
 
 
 
 
B. Laboratory tests with SAIC handsets 
The data collection was carried out over the functional 
coverage area by applying BSC measurement called RxLevel 
Statistics. SAIC terminals were used for the test calls. The 
collection was done in systematic manner by moving the 
terminals approximately 0.5 m/s with a test platform. 
The correlated (Q, PRX) matrix was collected for both 
OSC and reference GSM HR calls. It should be noted that 
the testing was done only for one physical TSL whilst the 
other traffic TSLs were blocked. As the environment was 
noise-limited and no inter-TSL interferences were present, 
this represents a fully loaded cell. The interval of the (Q, 
PRX) matrices was 15 minutes. 
FIGURE 12 shows the principle of the data collection, which 
was carried out in three different phases within high, medium 
and low ranges of received power levels. This method was 
applied to the investigations in order to collect the data over 
the PRX categories in as uniform manner as possible.

C. Laboratory results 
The correlated (Qn, PRXm) results can be organized to a 
matrix format in such a way that the elements vi,j correspond 
to the number N of the samples of Q8-i, where i=0,1,...,8, and 
PRXj-1, with j=0,1,...,5, is indicated as N(Qn, PRXm). The result 
of (Q0, PRX0) represents thus the value of the matrix element 
v8,1 and (Q1, PRX1) corresponds to the element v7,1. The last 
result of (Q7, PRX5) is found in the element v1,6. The following 
format clarifies the idea.

In the original GSM mode and with full load of a single 
TSL, a total of two HR users consume the whole physical 
TSL. In the OSC mode, in turn, a total of 4 DHR users util-
izes the physical TSL in the fully loaded TSL. 
The Qn and PRXm results were collected in three phases, 
each lasting 15 minutes. One area is characterized as a strong 
field with main part of the results occurring in PRX categories 
of PRX5 and PRX4. The second represents medium field with 
values of PRX3 and PRX2, and the third area represents low 
field with values belonging to PRX1 and PRX0. The results 
were then combined in order to present the matrix of the 
complete field. 
All the measurement data samples were collected as uni-
formly as possible by moving the platform in a constant 
speed. The data collection in the lowest field was done by 
observing the Radio Link Timer (RLT) parameter value di-
rectly in the mobile phone's engineering mode channel dis-
play. When the field reached the critical level, there occurred 
SACCH frame errors and the retransmission parameter value 
started to decrease from the original value of 20 towards 0. 
Before the zero-value was reached (which drops the call), the 
mobile was moved to the better field in order to raise the 
value back to 20 without breaking the connection. 
There were a total of 20,383 and 19,399 samples col-
lected during the GSM HR and OSC modes, respectively. In 
average, there is thus more than 400 samples per matrix ele-
ment, which results in an average margin error Err[95%] = 
0.98 / √(400) = 4.9% with 95% confidence level per each 
matrix element. Table III shows the Err[95%] for each PRX 
category. 
 
 
D. OSC Radio Performance Model 
Based on the analysis presented previously, a comparison 
of the matrices can be now performed. GSM HR matrix 
MGSM can be selected as a reference in order to produce a 
matrix Mdiff, which indicates the difference or change of the 
original correlated (Q, PRX) distribution in %-units due to the 
OSC mode. The matrix is:

It can be noted that in the original MGSM, there are all 
quality classes Q0...Q7 present in the lowest field, i.e., in PRX0 
category, whilst MOSC produces samples only to the quality 
classes Q6 and Q7 in the same field. It can be seen that the 
collection of samples for different PRX levels is not uniform, 
indicating that the data collection happened slightly un-
equally in different fields, in addition to the fact that the 
ranges associated with each PRX are different. This makes the 
comparison of the matrices challenging. 
In order to cope with this issue, the result matrices can be 
normalized over each PRXm category (that is by column) in-
stead of the total number of the collected samples, in the 
following way:

It can be seen from the matrices that the proportion of 
quality classes Q7 and Q6 is higher in OSC than in GSM HR. 
FIGURE 13 shows the impact of OSC on the quality level 
per each PRX category. The most affected categories are PRX0,

The introduction of OSC feature causes each CDF to shift 
towards the higher Q classes corresponding to higher BER. 
This indicates that the useful coverage area produced via the 
OSC mode is smaller than the one produced by HR. 
 
1) Scenario 1: Difference of the radio quality in a fully 
loaded GSM HR and OSC cell 
TABLE 5 summarizes the laboratory test analysis in CDF, 
showing the differences between HR and OSC per PRX cate-
gory. As can be noted, the Q5, i.e., BER in the interval 
[3.1%, 6.4%] can be reached with HR between PRX0 and PRX1 
[−95, −110 dBm]. According to Table III, the OSC moves 
the C/N requirement higher, and the Q5 can now be found 
between PRX1 and PRX2 [−90, −99 dBm]. 
 
 
 
It can be assumed that the practical threshold for the 
GSM call is at quality level of Q4, corresponding to a BER in 
the range [1.6, 3.2]. FIGURE 16 shows the CDF of the com-
bined PRX classes as a function of the Q, indicating that the 
Q4 is at 89.5% for GSM HR, and at 80.0% for OSC over the 
whole investigated area AGSM in this specific case.

As the OSC brings up to 100% capacity enhancement 
compared to the GSM HR, the benefit of OSC is clear even 
with this level cell size reduction. 
In practice, the original cell size remains as determined 
by the GSM FR and HR limits for the C/N and C/I levels. In 
other words, when the OSC feature is activated, the cell con-
tains OSC, HR and FR coverage regions. The FR proportion 
remains the same also after the activation of OSC, but HR 
region is divided into OSC and HR regions. The final size of 
these depends mainly on the original overlapping portions of 
the neighboring cells and the criteria of the intra/inter-cell 
handover algorithms. 
Furthermore, the OSC proportion depends also on the 
time slot usage by OSC, β, which in turn depends on the 
OSC capable handset penetration α. 
 
2)  Scenario 2: Only OSC (SAIC) handset penetration is 
known 
In a practical GSM network, there is a certain penetration 
of OSC capable terminals in the investigated field. When 
OSC is activated, there are legacy terminals that are capable 
of functioning only with the previous GSM codecs (FR, HR, 
AMR), and SAIC terminals that are also capable to function 
in the DHR mode. 
It is thus important to take the SAIC terminal penetration 
into account when modeling the effect of OSC in the field. 
The M'GSM and M'OSC presented previously show the corre-
lated distribution of (Q, PRX) in a fully loaded situation, i.e., 
when all the time slots are occupied either by GMS HR or 
OSC users. We can still utilize this assumption of fully 
loaded cell in order to find the limits of the effect. Let's as-
sume the SAIC handset penetration is α of all the terminals 
in the investigated area. As the OSC DHR utilizes single 
TSL for a total of 4 users whilst GSM HR can multiplex two 
users in the same TSL, the TSL capacity related scaling fac-
tor is needed for the performance model. 
In a typical case, there are 2 or more TRXs per cell in 
sub-urban areas, and 4 or more in dense city environment. 
The TSL utilization of the OSC vs. HR can be estimated by 
α. The TSL utilization factor β for the OSC TSL occupancy

Now, when M'GSM, M'diff and OSC penetration α are 
known, the M'OSC can be obtained by scaling the original

the matrix M'GSM as

M'GSM and M'OSC obtained from the laboratory can be util-
ized directly, and the estimate of the new M'OSC (α) can be 
thus constructed by interpolating linearly the matrix values 
element-by element basis. 
The usage of the laboratory results is most accurate in 
environment that contains approximately same type of radio 
channel, i.e., in noise-limited environment with almost line-
of-sight and light proportion of Rayleigh fading. If the radio 
channel differs considerably from the laboratory, Scenario 3 
should be considered instead. This means that the case re-
sults presented in this paper might vary depending, e.g., on 
the level of the co-channel and adjacent channel interfer-
ences as well as on the type of multi-path propagation 
characteristics in the investigated area. 
 
3) Scenario 3: OSC (SAIC) handset penetration and 
new M'GSM are known 
When the new M'GSM is known, showing the correlated 
(Qn, PRXm) matrix for HR calls, it can be assumed that the 
new M'OSC is possible to construct by applying the M'diff that 
was obtained from the laboratory. The assumption is that the 
OSC feature performance is independent of the radio condi-
tions, i.e., the reference M'GSM obtained from the laboratory 
already contains the radio channel related performance, 
whilst M'OSC includes this same radio performance effect and 
an additional OSC performance specific performance. 
Assuming this is applicable in varying radio conditions, the 
new M'OSC can be constructed by taking into account the 
OSC penetration:

As explained in scenario 2, the activation of OSC is seen 
within the HR coverage area, the FR area staying unchanged. 
The utilization of the OSC compared to the original HR re-
gion can now be interpreted from the practical measurements 
or by taking again the Q4 criterion as a basis. Also another 
value of the quality classes can be utilized, if that corre-
sponds to the OSC pairing and un-pairing criteria of the OSC 
algorithm. 
V. 
COMPLETE OSC MODEL 
The strength of the developed model is that it requires 
only few and basic inputs, which are: 1) Rx Level Statistics 
tables before the OSC functionality is activated; 2) estima-
tion of the OSC capable penetration in the initial phase of the 
OSC activation; and 3) optionally the percentage of the util-
ized HR and FR codecs. 
A. OSC model process 
FIGURE 18 shows the complete process of the model. The 
model processes the input data in such a way that the ex-
pected (Q,PRX) matrix is formed based on the measured and 
correlated (Q, PRX) table element-by-element according to 
(27). By default, the scaling of each element can be done by 
utilizing the already formed difference matrix. It should be 
noted that the presented difference matrix is valid for the 
noise-limited environment, so new difference matrix might 
be needed for the interference-limited environment.  
The output of the model indicates the proportion of the 
OSC usage as a function of the OSC capable handset 
penetration, with the capacity gain that can be expressed in 
122

terms of increased offered load/traffic or of the possibility to 
reduce TRX elements. The radio performance result is based 
on the analysis of the changed C/I or C/N distributions. 
When the complete model is applied in the investigation 
of a realistic GSM network, the steps described in FIGURE 18 
can be taken into account for solving first the impact on the 
radio performance, i.e., on the changes of the quality. 
The actual capacity gain depends on the radio perform-
ance, i.e., which proportion of the GSM call can be utilized 
for the OSC, and on the OSC penetration, i.e., what share of 
the handsets can take the advantage of the usable coverage 
area for the OSC. The estimate of the performance change 
due to the activation of OSC would be made based on the 
pre-formed difference matrices and the SAIC penetration.

When the Rx level statistics table of GSM is measured 
from the field (i.e., the table without OSC feature activated), 
it can be assumed that the corresponding expected Rx level 
statistics table for the OSC is possible to construct by apply-
ing the correction curves that were obtained from the labora-
tory as shown in FIGURE 13. The assumption is that the OSC 
feature performance is independent of the radio conditions, 
i.e., the reference table of GSM obtained from the laboratory 
already contains the radio channel related performance, and 
that the OSC table includes this same radio performance ef-
fect and an additional OSC performance specific perform-
ance. Assuming this is applicable in varying radio condi-
tions, the new OSC table can be constructed by taking into 
account the OSC penetration:

where M'OSC is the matrix format for the new OSC Rx 
level statistics table, M'GSM is the matrix of the measured 
GSM Rx levels statistics table in the field, and M'diff is the 
correction matrix obtained from the laboratory measure-
ments. The practical way of constructing the OSC Rx level 
table is to utilize the β factor element-by-element basis for 
scaling first each of the difference matrix elements. Then, the 
difference matrix is utilized to scale the GSM Rx level statis-
tics table element-by-element basis. 
B. Process steps 
The complete OSC model considers the radio perform-
ance, or changes of the performance due to the OSC activa-
tion, as well as the resulting capacity gain. The steps for the 
investigation of the OSC impact are: 
Step 1: Storing of the Rx Level statistics measurement 
and codec utilization measurement via BSC. This gives the 
reference for the GSM performance without OSC. 
From the codec utilization measurement, also the esti-
mate of what is the utilization (percentage) of HR and FR 
codecs can be included. That information gives the equiva-
lence of the original HR-FR division also area-wise as shown 
in FIGURE 19.

FIGURE 19. The original division of the FR and HR mode utilization 
before the OSC feature has been activated. 
 
The investigation of the utilization of the codecs can be 
done for any time of the traffic, but the peak hour as criterion 
is recommended in order to collect as  much data as possible 
in the given time window, and to make sure that the behavior 
of the effect of OSC on the capacity is done in the extreme 
conditions that represents the practical limit for the gain. In 
order to increase the accuracy of the estimate, the Rx level 
statistics measurement for the storing of the correlated Q and 
PRX table can be done at the same time as the codec division. 
Step 2: Estimation of the OSC capable SAIC handset 
proportion in the field, i.e., the factor α. The estimate can be 
carried out via the network statistics that is based on an IMEI 
(International Mobile Equipment Identity) analysis, which is 
correlated with the database of the models that support 
SAIC. The estimate can also be done based on the sales 
statistics, or other practical "best-effort" estimate. Based on 
this information, the average TSL utilization for the OSC 
capable handsets can be estimated by using (23).  
Step 3: Estimation of the capacity regions assuming the 
OSC DHR functions within a part of the HR region. The FR 
region can be assumed to work unchanged, as the situation

was before the OSC activation. The criterion for the OSC 
percentage can be selected as presented in FIGURE 16, i.e., 
based on the Q4 level in CDF of the area. If the practical 
implementation of the OSC pairing and un-pairing is based 
on the other Q levels, that can be utilized instead.

FIGURE 20. When OSC feature is activated, there will be functional 
areas for OSC DHR, HR and FR in the cell, each providing different 
capacity performance. 
 
Step 4: Capacity estimate for the OSC and HR regions, 
and estimate of each region proportions. The division can be 
estimated by the HR and FR codec utilization statistics of 
BSC, UHR indicating the utilization for HR (%) and UFR 
indicating the utilization for FR (%). This division gives the 
first type of indicator for the capacity gain. 
C. OSC utilization 
During the laboratory measurements described above, the 
codec utilization measurement was not yet activated. In prac-
tice, the voice codec statistics measurement can be activated 
in BSC in the same manner as (Q, PRX) statistics in order to 
obtain the realistic division of the HR and FR utilization. In 
this analysis, we can assume case values of UFR = 10% and 
UHR = 90%. The comparison is done by calculating first the 
reference situation, i.e., the total capacity utilization via HR 
and FR, by giving a weight of δHR = 2 (users / TSL) for HR 
(δHR) and 1 (users / TSL) for the FR (δFR):

The reference value is for full FR utilization, which re-
sults 100%. The HR mode as such gives thus 80% capacity 
gain in this specific example. When OSC is activated, the 
utilization of OSC and HR can be estimated accordingly, and 
the new capacity utilization can be thus calculated by:

where the weight for OSC users (δOSC) is 4 (users / TSL). 
Assuming the utilization is still 10% for FR, we get the new 
division between the HR and OSC utilization by observing 
the Q4 criterion and CDF as shown in FIGURE 16. The respec-
tive division between the HR and OSC regions can be thus 
solved. 
In this specific case of the laboratory results, by observ-
ing the FIGURE 16 and respective result via (30) and (31), the 
OSC utilization is 100−10.6 = 89.4 (%) compared to the 
original HR area. The remaining 10.6 (%) share of the area 
represents thus the new HR region. The total utilization of 
the capacity when OSC is activated is thus:

The original situation without OSC presenting a 100 % 
reference, this means that the capacity gain of Dual Half 
Rate OSC is 248.8% compared to the presence of only FR 
mode, and 348.8⋅100/180−100 = 93.8% compared to the 
presence of both, FR and HR modes. 
It is possible to investigate further the dependency of the 
number of users and Erlang B formula's offered traffic as a 
function of the OSC penetration as shown in FIGURE 7, which 
shows the principle of the method with an example of 2% 
blocking rate. Other blocking rates are possible to be used as 
a basis for the calculations based on the statistics collected 
from the network. In order to estimate the capacity gain cor-
rectly, the investigation of the blocking rate of the network 
area of interest during the busy hour is thus needed. 
FIGURE 7 summarizes the behavior of the channel utiliza-
tion. It can be seen that the performance of the cell increases 
due to the Erlang B gain, along with the OSC penetration 
growth compared to the original proportion of the HR capa-
ble users. 
D. TRX reduction gain 
The calculation for the reduced GSM resources can be 
made by assuming that the offered traffic level and the call 
blocking rate are maintained in the original level. FIGURE 8 
summarizes the analysis carried out for 20...100 Erl of of-
fered traffic when the blocking rate is 2%. 
As can be seen from FIGURE 8, along the growth of the 
OSC penetration, the needed number of TSLs with the same 
blocking rate (originally 2%) gets lower. According to the 
behavior of the Erlang B model, the effect is logically 
strongest for the higher capacity cells. This can be noted 
especially from the highest investigated offered traffic class 
of 100 Erl, which requires only half of the timeslots when 
OSC penetration is 100%. 
Two cases can be constructed based on the offered traffic 
behavior of GSM as a function of OSC penetration. As a first 
case, the offered capacity can be maintained the same, which 
means that the blocking rate for the users will be lower (gain 
of lower blocking rate). This case applies also to the situation 
where future TRX expansions are planned they can be post-
poned until the original (or separately decided new) blocking 
rate is achieved. 
If, instead, the offered capacity is lowered by keeping the 
blocking rate the same, we can estimate the OSC capacity 
gain in terms of the savings in the TRXs. This TRX reduc-
tion can be made based on TABLE 6, by taking into account 
that each TRX element should be informed as integer num-
124
International Journal on Advances in Telecommunications, vol 4 no 1 & 2, year 2011, http://www.iariajournals.org/telecommunications/
2011, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org

ber that is rounded up (containing always 8 physical TSLs). 
Again, the blocking rate of 2% (or lower) is utilized as the 
criterion. The possibility to reduce the TRX elements can be 
utilized for the additional capacity for 3G and 4G. 
 
 
TABLE 6 indicates the capacity gain obtained as a function 
of the OSC penetration in terms of the TRX element reduc-
tion within the functional area of OSC. This case applies to 
the re-farming of the 2G, 3G and 4G frequencies. 
The reduced need for the GSM bandwidth in order to still 
deliver the original 2G traffic with an unchanged quality of 
service level may provide the possibility to add a new UMTS 
carrier of 5 MHz  [17] to the same band. As an example, if 
the original GSM band is of 10 MHz (50 channels of 200 
kHz each), according to FIGURE 9, the 80 Erl traffic can be 
offered with half of the original amount of TRXs when the 
SAIC handset penetration is near 100%. This means that the 
original GSM traffic could be possible to deliver within 5 
MHz band still maintaining approximately the same blocking 
rate, which leaves sufficiently space for adding a complete 
UMTS carrier as a parallel solution. 
The benefit can also be seen with LTE, which provides 
more freedom to select the bandwidth, compared to the fixed 
5 MHz band of UMTS. The narrowest LTE bands, i.e., 1.4, 3 
and 5 MHz  [18] can be utilized to the gradual increasing of 
LTE, when first, GSM traffic can be offered in smaller band 
by OSC, and when GSM traffic eventually lowers. 
By applying the model and reference measurements for 
the quality effect of OSC in noise-limited environment, the 
optimal site configurations can be achieved. According to the 
results presented in this paper, the sites that contain at least 4 
TRXs with approximately 2% blocking rate during the peak-
hour, can benefit from the activation of OSC in such a scale 
that the 4-TRX cell with OSC penetration of about 25% 
would give possibility to remove one complete TRX, the 
blocking rate still being at the same or lower 2% level. 
Alternatively, if the SAIC penetration is relatively high, in 
order of 75%, one TRX element can be removed even from a 
3-TRX cell without impacts on the blocking. 
In the live network, the final effects of OSC depend on 
the proportion of the overlapping cells, co-channel interfer-
ence levels, inter-cell handover algorithms and their parame-
ter values. In any case, the presented analysis gives indica-
tion about the behavior of OSC when the OSC-paired HR 
calls, which can fit a maximum of four users to a single TSL, 
are switched back to HR mode that allows two users to a 
single TSL, or to FR mode that occupies the whole TSL for a 
single connection. The presented model shows how to esti-
mate the proportion of these regions, and what the effect of 
OSC is on the final capacity compared to the network that 
supports only the basic mode of FR/HR. 
VI. 
CONCLUSIONS 
This paper shows the behavior of the OSC capacity and 
radio performance as a function of the OSC penetration by 
comparing it with the GSM HR/FR traffic. The presented 
analysis is based on theoretical studies of the capacity and 
traffic behavior, as well as on single cell indoor measure-
ments in the non-interfering environment.  
According to the analysis presented in this paper, the 
OSC might function in about 10% smaller coverage area 
than HR mode in a tightly dimensioned environment. This 
proportion depends on the network dimensioning, which 
should be taken into account in the interpretation of the pre-
sented results. 
The results presented in this paper show that the OSC of-
fers a SAIC capable MS penetration dependent capacity 
gain, which can be utilized for lowering the blocking rate of 
the GSM network. In this scenario, the OSC does not benefit 
only the voice capacity, but it also provides higher efficiency 
for the data calls as OSC leaves more time slots for the use 
of packet switched domain. As in this case, the OSC allows 
the circuit switched calls to be delivered via lower amount of 
TSLs, it also liberates TSLs for the PS calls resulting higher 
average data throughputs per data user. It also means that 
recently standardized DLDC (Downlink Dual Carrier) of 
GSM benefits from OSC as the probability to obtain TSLs 
from two separate carriers for DLDC users increases. 
Alternatively, the OSC feature can be utilized for releas-
ing a part of the TRXs still maintaining the same or lower 
blocking rate that is dimensioned for the GSM HR network. 
This scenario can be utilized for the frequency re-farming. 
Assuming that the renewal period of current GSM handsets 
is typically from 3 to 4 years, i.e., the OSC capable MS 
penetration grows relatively fast, the OSC functionality pro-
vides efficient parallel utilization of GSM and 3G/4G. 
The presented method is based on the correlated received 
power level and quality measurements of BSC. It is shown 
that the matrix format, even if the utilized PRX category 
ranges are relatively wide (from 5 to 10 dB resolution) due to 
the limitations of the statistics collection tool, can be utilized 
in the estimation of the OSC performance based on the qual-
ity measurements of the GSM network before the OSC is 
activated. The benefit of this method is that the statistics can 
be collected by activating the correlating data collection un-
der the whole BSC area. The collected data is thus statisti-
cally considerably more accurate compared to a single mo-
bile radio interface measurement results. 
The results indicate the OSC performance in indoor radio 
channel that contains a relatively small proportion of fast 
fading components. The speed represents a typical slow-
moving pedestrian type, and the cell is noise limited. The 
GSM HR codec was utilized for the reference. In case of 
other references (GSM FR and different AMR levels), and 
other radio conditions, additional measurements are needed 
for creating the M'diff matrix, which would be a future work

item. Assuming the effect of the environment is low on the 
M'diff, the results presented in this paper may be used as a 
general estimate of the OSC. As a future work item, the 
model will be evaluated in the outdoor environment with 
interfering components present. 
The model can be considered useful because only basic 
KPIs and statistics about the OSC capable handset penetra-
tion is required as  input values. The result of the model indi-
cates the effect of the OSC for the combination of the radio 
performance and capacity behavior.
