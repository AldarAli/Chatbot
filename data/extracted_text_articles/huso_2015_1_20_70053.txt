Abstract— In Japanese, to receive a guest with 
hospitality and assist him in various ways is called 
“omotenashi”. The word “omotenashi” has become 
internationally recognized as designating a form of 
welcoming rooted in the traditions and culture of Japan. 
Greeting is the basis of omotenashi, and one of the ways 
to greet is to bow. We conducted an experiment on the 
difference in maneuver between an experienced and 
inexperienced person and measuring the positions and 
timing of the bowing motion. Furthermore for the 
inexperienced persons, we conducted an analysis of the 
improvement of the motion with presence or absence of 
instruction as variable. The bow of the experienced 
person had a stable angle, with the shoulder angle (θ1) 
being around 180 degrees all three times, and the angle 
of the waist (θ2) was at around 20 degrees all three times. 
The transitions from the beginning of the bow until the 
head was lowered and from the head beginning to rise 
until the end of the bow were about equal speed, and the 
speed of the head was relatively slow at 300 (mm/sec). 
Inexperienced persons can be trained to a certain level 
by watching footage of model bowing, though there are 
significant differences according to the individual.

 INTRODUCTION  
In Japanese, to receive a guest with hospitality and assist 
him in various ways is called “omotenashi”. The Japan 
Productivity Center defines “omotenashi” as “work to 
provide special service from the heart while valuing the 
perspective of customers and/or residents.” In foreign 
countries, the same concept exists and called for example 
“hospitality (U.S.),” “dai ke zhi dao (China), and 
“hospitalité (France),” but recently the word “omotenashi” 
has become internationally recognized as designating, along 
with the definition above, a form of welcoming rooted in the 
traditions and culture of Japan. According to an 
investigation of the Japan Productivity Center, a majority of 
people in the U.S., China, and France have heard of the 
word “Omotenashi” [1]. 
One of the reasons for the rising awareness of 
omotenashi is the increase in foreign visitors to Japan. In 
2013, the number of foreign visitors passed 10 million for 
the first time, due to economic growth in Asian countries as 
well as success in the promotion of travel to Japan by a 
tourism policy called “Visit Japan” that was devised in 2003. 
The Japanese government will further devise a plan to 
increase the number of visitors to 20 million by 2020. In 
2020, Olympic and Paralympic Games will be held in 
Tokyo. As the host country for the Olympic and Paralympic, 
Japan has an urgent need to convey its culture to the world 
in a comprehensible way. As stated earlier, omotenashi is a 
form of hospitality rooted in the culture and traditions of 
Japan, one that gives importance to touchpoints with the 
customer, an original way of giving high quality service 
from the heart based on mutual communication. Omotenashi 
could be said to be Japan’s most important aspect.  
Greeting is the basis of omotenashi, and one of the ways 
to greet is to bow. Bowing has different shades of meaning 
according to the country or region, but generally speaking it 
is the action of bending from the waist to greet someone, 
express thanks, or apologize. In Japan, bowing also is a way 
to greet, give thanks, and apologize, but its role as the 
fundamental action of Japanese hospitality and culture 
known as “omotenashi” and its designation as high quality 
service from the heart gave it a different significance from 
that in other countries. Japanese bowing is classified 
according to the angle at which the bowing is done, the 
levels being “eshaku (greeting bow)”, “keirei (respect bow)”, 
and “saikeirei (highest respect bow)”. The classified bowing 
are in Figure 1. The levels differ in degree of honoring and 
are used in different circumstances. The maneuver consists 
in these three stages: to stand tall, to bend from the lower 
back, and to return from the lower back.  
To spread Japanese culture internationally, it is urgent to 
consider how to convey omotenashi in ways easily 
understood by foreigners starting from the act of bowing. In 
the field of traditional Japanese industry and care, there is a 
prior case studies on the comparison of experienced and 
inexperienced person by the motion analysis. Based on these 
previous studies, we conducted an experiment on the 
difference in maneuver between an experienced and 
inexperienced person by recording their movements using a 
video camera and measuring the positions and timing of the 
bowing motion. Furthermore for the inexperienced persons, 
we conducted an analysis of the improvement of the motion 
with presence or absence of instruction as variable [2]-[4].

By performing this analysis, for the provider of services, 
it is expected that the point of the teaching becomes clear. 
On the other hand, for the receiver side of the service, by 
being able to quickly reach the elementary level that can 
understand the hospitality, and it is expected to deepen the 
understanding of the Japanese culture. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
describes experimentation method. Section 3 describes the 
measured angle, and speed of the bow. Section 4 is 
discussing this experiment. Section 5 goes into conclusion 
of this paper.

EXPERIMENTATION METHOD 
A. The Test Subject and the Bowing 
The test subjects were one experienced person with a 
history of teaching omotenashi for 7 years and 4 
inexperienced persons. Gender, age and physical condition 
are shown in TABLE 1. Japanese persons who had never 
received instruction in the motion of a bow. For the bowing, 
we used “keirei”.

B. Experimentation Method 
As shown in Figure 2, a marker was placed at the head, 
shoulder, waist, and knees of the test subjects, and the 
bowing motion of each was recorded by a video camera, and 
measurements were made for the passing of time and the 
location of the markers. 
  
 
Figure 2  Measurement Graphics 
Furthermore, with the inexperienced subjects, measure-
ments were made with three divisions: “bowing without any 
outside influence”, “bowing after looking at the bow of the 
experienced 
person”, 
and 
“bowing 
after 
receiving 
instruction from the experienced person”.   
1) The bow of the experienced person. With a marker 
placed on the head, shoulder, waist, and knee of the 
experienced person, a recording with a video camera was 
made from the side of the “keirei” bow.  The same motion 
was made three times.   
2) Bowing 
without 
outside 
influence. 
The 
four 
inexperienced persons who had never received instruction in 
bowing each performed a bow as they understood it three 
times and this was recorded by a video camera. 
3) Bowing after looking at the bow of the experienced 
person. After looking at the footage of the experienced 
person’s bow, the four inexperienced persons performed a 
bow and this was recorded by video camera. 
4) Bowing 
after 
receiving 
instruction 
from 
the 
experienced person. The inexperienced persons were made 
to study from a video that explains the meaning of bowing, 
and afterwards they performed a bow and it was recorded by 
video camera. The explanation video was common for both 
genders and taught the following 5, items1. The meaning of 
the act of bowing in Japan. 2. Types of bowing. 3. Speed of 
bowing. 4. Posture while bowing. 5. Gaze while bowing. 
C. Analysis Method 
With the measured time and information of the markers’ 
locations we discerned the transition of location and speed. 
We paid special attention to the speed of the head (Vh). And 
from the distance between the four points of head, shoulder, 
waist, and knees, we calculated the angle of head-shoulder-
lower back (θ1) and the angle of shoulder-waist-knee (θ2).

THE TIME, MEASURED ANGLE, AND SPEED OF THE 
BOW 
A. Time Needed for Each Test Subject to Bow 
Three measurements were made, and the results are 
shown in TABLE 2 according to test subject. The three 
measurements were divided as “from the beginning of the

bow until the head is lowered” as motion 1, “the head 
lowered and stopped” as motion 2, and “from the raising of 
the head until the end of the bow” as motion 3.  
The total time for the experienced person was 1,122ms, 
but for the inexperienced persons it ranged from 1,206ms to 
1,812ms. The difference between the inexperienced 
individuals was great, and compared to the experienced 
person more time was required.

B. The Bow of the Experienced Person 
The transition of the angle of the bow of the experienced 
person is shown in Figure 3. The angle of the shoulders, θ1 
is about 180 degrees all three times and hardly shows any 
difference. Also the angle of the lower back, θ2 is held at 
about 20 degrees all three times.   
Figure 3  Standardized Transition of Angle of the Bow of the Experienced 
Person (θ1/θ2) 
In Figure 4, the transition of the speed of the 
experienced person’s bow is shown. Motion 1, from the 
beginning of the bow until the head is lowered, and motion 
3, from the raising of the head until the end of the bow, had 
almost the same speed during the transition.

C. Mastership of Bowing 
Here, we measure for each inexperienced person the 
influence that the bowing instruction had on their motions. 
1) Bowing without any Outside Influence. The test 
subjects were made to do three bows that they felt were 
correct, and θ1 and θ2 were measured. As a result, a 
tendency for θ1 and θ2 to be synchronized was seen, so 
bending at the waist occurs simultaneously with the motion 
of bending the neck. The speed is generally faster than test 
subject 1 who is experienced, and also there were cases of 
motion 3 being faster than motion 1 and of speed increasing 
or decreasing as the three bows were performed (Figures 
5~8).

2) Changes after Observing the Experienced Person’s 
Bow. The results of bowing three times after observing the 
experienced person’s bow are shown in Figures 9~12.  
There was no change for test subjects 2 and 4 for θ1 and θ
2 to synchronize, but with test subjects 3 and 5, θ1 holds a 
steady angle. This is thought to be because they noticed that 
the experienced person’s bow has no change in the 
shoulders’ angle and the motion is done by bending at the 
waist.  For test subject 5, speed is clearly lowered.

bowing of the inexperienced persons after receiving 
concrete instructions of bowing by the instructor.

Figure 16  Vh and θ1/ θ2 of Test Subject 5 (Vh:mm/sec) 
From the instruction test subjects 2 , 3 and 5 were able to 
maintain a steady θ1. Speed generally became stable at a 
low speed (Figures 13~16). 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
First, we will consider angles (θ1/ θ2). The angle of the 
shoulders, θ1 of the experienced person is about 180 
degrees all three times without much change. Also the angle 
of the waist, θ2 is maintained at about 20 degrees all three 
times. A bow is done by bending from the waist, and must 
not be done by bending the angle of the shoulder, or in other 
words the neck must not be bent. The basics of a Japanese 
bow are being performed here. For the speed of the head, it 
could be seen that the speed is relatively low at 300 
(mm/sec).  
The bows of the four test subjects were standardized 
from the ones they thought were correct to begin with. As a 
result, θ1 and θ2 tended to synchronize. This shows that the 
waist and neck are bent simultaneously. In terms of speed, 
there were cases of motion 3 being faster than motion 1, the 
motions becoming faster as the three bows progressed, and 
the motions becoming slower as the three bows progressed.   
For the results of bowing three times after observing the 
experienced person, θ1 and θ2 being synchronized did not 
change with test subjects 2 and 4, but with test subjects 3 
and 5 θ1 maintained a steady angle. This can be said to be 
because they noticed that a bow should be done by only 
bending the waist and not the shoulders. In terms of speed 
no changes especially were noticed.   
In the results of bowing after receiving instruction from 
the experienced person’s bow, subjects 2, 3 and 5 were able 
to maintain a steady θ1. This is considered to be because 
they received instruction from the experienced person and 
understood the meaning of a bow which made them realize 
they must not change the angle of the shoulders, but go 
through the bending motion from the waist.   
The level of change before and after receiving the 
instruction differed for each individual test subject, and each 
motion lacked stability. This is thought to be because there 
is individual difference in perspective and understanding, 
even if they all observe the experienced person or receive 
instruction, and because it is difficult to measure the angle 
of one’s shoulders and waist by oneself. And with speed, 
regardless of there being instruction or not, the difference 
between the experienced person and inexperienced persons 
was great, which shows that verbal instruction is insufficient 
for learning the “gentleness” of the experienced person’s 
bow. For instruction it is considered that there needs to be 
more depth in instruction method for stability and 
maintaining a gentle speed or for skills such as where to 
look when maintaining the angle of the shoulders.   
V. 
CONCLUSION 
In this research, we focused on Japanese bowing, a form 
of greeting which is fundamental to omotenashi, and 
conducted experiments involving the angles of bowing of 
experienced and inexperienced persons, the difference in 
speed, and the changes that take place when inexperienced 
persons received instruction. As a result, the following 
things were understood. 
y 
The bow of the experienced person had a stable angle, 
with the shoulder angle (θ1) being around 180 degrees 
all three times. In other words, the head was straight 
and the angle of the waist (θ2) was at around 20 
degrees all three times.   
y 
The transitions from the beginning of the bow until the 
head was lowered and from the head beginning to rise 
until the end of the bow were about equal speed, and 
the speed of the head was relatively slow at 300 
(mm/sec).  
y 
Inexperienced persons can be trained to a certain level 
by watching footage of model bowing, though there 
are significant differences according to the individual.
