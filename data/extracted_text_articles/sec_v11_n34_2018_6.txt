Abstract—Many cloud users are heading into a potentially dev-
astating regulatory disaster zone. A major unresolved cloud
issue, namely the cloud forensic problem, this is likely to mean
many cloud users will be unable to be compliant with the
new EU General Data Protection Regulation. We consider the
possible use of blockchain, a cryptocurrency based mechanism,
to address the as yet unsolved cloud forensic problem. We believe
that the underlying blockchain could be adopted to provide a
robust mechanism for ensuring that cloud forensic and audit
trail records can be securely maintained. This would ensure
that cloud users would in turn be able to ensure they are
compliant with the new EU General Data Protection Regulation,
thus minimising their exposure to punitive levels of ﬁnes. We
analyse the key risks in cryptocurrencies, namely the operational
risk, market risk and cross contamination risk associated with
co-movement of cryptocurrencies with other asset forms, using
the most predominant and oldest of those, Bitcoin, to provide an
example of how removing these risks might provide a far more
effective solution to the cloud forensic problem. Our contribution
is to demonstrate how this might be done, and by removing
the incentive for attackers, to provide a much higher level of
compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation for
cloud users.

INTRODUCTION
All computing systems connected to the internet are con-
stantly under attack, and for traditional networked computer
systems, this presents a serious challenge to ensure a high level
of security and privacy can be maintained. For cloud systems,
these challenges increase exponentially, due to the increase
in complexity in software, and the multiplicity of layers and
actors involved in modern cloud ecosystems, especially in light
of their disparate agendas.
There remains one serious, but as yet, unresolved chal-
lenge, namely the cloud forensic problem. This problem arises
where an attacker breaches a cloud system and becomes an
intruder, whereby there is nothing then to prevent that intruder
from escalating privileges and removing all trace of their
incursion by deleting or modifying the forensic trail identifying
all their actions and routes into the system. The intruder seeks
to remain hidden in the system, where they can continue
absorbing information. In [1], we considered whether it might
be possible to utilise blockchain technology to help deal with
this problem. This article extends that earlier work.
The cloud forensic problem is particularly problematic for
companies who both use cloud, and are liable to fall under
the jurisdiction of, and therefore require to be compliant with,
the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [2].
Without ensuring their cloud provision can properly retain full
audit and forensic records, those who use cloud will struggle
to meet compliance requirements. Given the punitive level
of possible ﬁnes for non-compliance (up to the greater of
e20million or 4% of last year’s global turnover), this is likely
to have a considerable impact on companies who are unable
to be compliant.
The very convenience of cloud use for a great many
companies is likely to place them at a competitive disadvantage
now that the GDPR is live. Due to the long lead time required,
the enormous costs involved, and the level of expertise needed
to securely set up such systems, moving back to conventional
distributed network systems is currently unlikely to present a
feasible option for many companies, who will effectively be
“waiting for the sword of Damocles to fall”.
It is imperative that a viable solution be found as quickly
as possible. We take a look at the latest global phenomenon
of cryptocurrencies, and the technologies they use to ensure
security. Security for all ﬁnancial systems is a necessary
priority in all ﬁnancial companies. They are subject to an
incredible range of risks, and we believe it may be worthwhile
looking at the operational risk which encompasses the actions
that undermine the technological infrastructure and security
assumptions of cryptocurrencies, as well as the market risk
related to cryptocurrencies.
We start by examining the cloud forensic problem to
understand why it is such a challenge for cloud users to
become compliant with the GDPR in Section II. Next, we
turn to cryptocurrencies and consider operational risk in such
systems in Section III. In Section IV, we conside the impli-
cations of market risk, while in Section V, we look at the
co-movement of cryptocurrencies with different currencies,
indices, and commodities, to show the role of cryptocurrency
as a commodity, currency, or a speculative investment under
portfolio diversiﬁcation theory. In Section IX, we consider the
robustness of this approach for dealing with security issues. In
Section X, we discuss our ﬁndings and consider future work,
and in Section XI, presents our conclusions.
II.
THE CLOUD FORENSIC PROBLEM AND GDPR
COMPLIANCE
All computer systems connected to the internet are contin-
uously subject to attack, and cloud systems are no exception.
It is certainly the case that no system is immune to attack,
and that is particularly true for cloud systems. During the past
decade, a great many research papers have allowed a far greater
level of security and privacy to be achieved in cloud systems.
There have been many good papers produced on both security
[3]–[14] and privacy [11], [15]–[30], and a number of others
have looked at better accountability as a means to meeting
these ends [7], [8], [12], [17], [24], [27], [31]–[50] However,

244
International Journal on Advances in Security, vol 11 no 3 & 4, year 2018, http://www.iariajournals.org/security/
2018, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
despite all those efforts, no solutions have yet been found to
address the cloud forensic problem.
This problem arises once an attacker compromises a cloud
system, thus gaining even a small foothold. Once embedded
in a system, the attacker becomes an intruder and seeks to
escalate privileges until they can access and delete, or modify,
the forensic logs in order to hide all trace of their incursion into
the system. This allows them to retain a long term foothold
within the system, thus allowing them to help themselves to
whatever data they wish.
Many companies do not retain records of which database
records have been accessed, and by whom, meaning that once
a breach occurs, the ability of the company to be able to report
which records have been accessed, copied, modiﬁed, deleted or
ex-ﬁltrated from the system becomes an impossible task. This
results in non-compliance with the GDPR, meaning exposure
to potentially punitive levels of ﬁnes.
To achieve compliance with the GDPR, all companies must
ﬁrst be able to report a breach within 72 hours of discovery.
The global average time for all companies between breach and
discovery in 2012 was an average of 6 months [51] [52]. This
had improved to some 4 weeks by 2016 [53] — still far short
of what is needed to understand what has been going on with
the intruders while they were undiscovered.
In the light of cloud use, and in particular the Internet
of Things (IoT), this raises the question of just how feasible
complying with such a time threshold might be. Where a
company uses cloud, the company is breached and it has made
no special arrangements to ensure the safety of forensic and
audit trail data, the 72 hour deadline is moot, since in the
ﬁrst place, it will have no means of knowing that it has been
breached, so will have nothing to report, since the requirement
is to report within 72 hours of discovery. However, once
discovery does occur, there will be no realistic prospect of
that company ever ﬁnding out just which records have been
compromised. When the forensic and audit trail is gone — it
is gone!
The IoT, of course, brings a whole new suite of problems
to bear, not least of which is the general insecure level of
devices, their small resource level, yet high throughput level
of data. some of which may be lost in transit. The issue might
not be so much with the data lost from IoT devices, rather
than with the ability of attackers to easily compromise the
devices, thus allowing them access via corporate networks to
other more valuable devices in the system. We do not address
the IoT within the scope of this paper, but do recognise that
any company using IoT devices will require to take special
measures to ensure GDPR compliance can be achieved.
Where a company does not take these special measures
to safeguard their forensic and audit trail data, they will be
less likely to be able to discover the occurance of the breach.
Shoud they by chance manage to discover the breach, they
would certainly be in a position to report it with 72 hours of
discovery, they will simply struggle to be able to report what
has been compromised, meaning they will be liable for some
level of ﬁne.
Obviously, the longer an intruder has available to spend
inside a company system, the more information they will
be able to acquire, and the more potential damage they can
cause. While the GDPR was changed from “... within 72
hours of a breach occurring...” to a much less stringent “...
within 72 hours of discovery ...”, this rather misses the point
that if a company cannot discover a breach within 72 hours
of the breach occurring, how will they possibly be able to
discover that is has arisen at all, let alone what data has been
compromised once the intruder has deleted all forensic and
audit trails?
So, not being able to discover that a breach has arisen,
while not putting the company technically in breach of the
GDPR, it will certainly make it extremely difﬁcult to enable
them to report which records have been compromised once
discovery actually occurs. This means the non-compliance
will necessarily become far more serious, thus enlarging the
exposure to risk of steeper ﬁnes.
While there is no speciﬁc requirement to encrypt data,
there is certainly a strong recommendation that this should take
place, and should do so within a reasonable time. Encryption
and decryption keys should not be stored on the cloud instance.
Failure to address these issues will certainly lead to steeper
ﬁnes in the event of a breach. An obvious point is that if
encryption is not used, then the regulator will require the
company to report the breach to every compromised user,
which will prove an impossible task where the forensic and
audit trails have been lost, again leading to yet steeper ﬁnes.
Due to the large number of high value clients, ﬁrms
involved in ﬁnancial services are generally subject to greater
attack than many other market sectors [54]. It is worth taking
a look at how they address security requirements. We believe
there may be some merit in considering cryptocurrencies, since
as a new entrant to the market, there is more likelihood that
their security approach, being designed from the beginning,
might offer better prospects rather than relying on existing
methods.
III.
OPERATIONAL RISK OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES
Operational risk refer to any action that undermines the
technical infrastructure and security assumptions relating to
cryptocurrencies. Considering operational risk will provide us
with an understanding of how well these risks are dealt with in
cryptocurrencies. In looking at high value successful breaches
of cryptocurrencies, we can see that these vulnerabilities relate
mainly to operator errors and security ﬂaws, which we discuss
later. And most importantly, the Bitcoin platform also faces
potential vulnerabilities from protocol designs. Operational
insecurity has been addressed by Moore and Christin [55],
who suggests that fraudulence is an issue among cryptocuren-
cies. Exchanges act as de facto banks, but almost half of
them ceased operation due to the resultant impact of security
breaches. However, these exchanges failed to reimburse their
customers after shutting down. As an alternative approach,
other users have instead deposited their Bitcoins in a digital
wallet which has also become a target for cyber-criminals.
A small number of theoretical papers written by computer
scientists address the mining pool protocols and anonymity.
Miners opted out for the pool in long rounds, in which a
potential block will be shared with large groups. Based on
a peer-to-peer network layer, Babaioff et al. [56] argue that
the current Bitcoin protocols do not provide an incentive for
nodes to broadcast transactions. This is problematic, since
the system is based on the assumption that there is such an
incentive. Instead, by focusing on block mining protocol, Eyal

245
International Journal on Advances in Security, vol 11 no 3 & 4, year 2018, http://www.iariajournals.org/security/
2018, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
and Sirer [57] show that mining is not incentive-compatible
and that so-called “selﬁsh mining” can lead to higher revenue
for miners who collude against others. Houey [58] observed
that larger blocks are less likely to win a block race when
including new transactions into blocks. Karame, Androulaki
and Capkun [59] analysed the security of using Bitcoin for
fast payments, and found that double-spending attacks on fast
payments succeed with overwhelming probability and can be
mounted at lower cost unless appropriate detection techniques
are integrated in the current Bitcoin implementation. Regarding
the double-spending and selﬁsh mining attacks, Kogias et
al. [60] proposed the usage of ByzCoin as a novel protocol
to optimise transaction commitment and veriﬁcation under
normal operation while guaranteeing safety and liveness under
Byzantine (It leveraged scalable collective signing to commit
Bitcoin transactions irreversibly within seconds) faults.
The protection of online privacy and anonymity arises and
are both addressed in the literature. Christin [61] examined the
anonymous online marketplace in cryptocurrencies. Böhme et
al. [62] examined what can be learned from Bitcoin regarding
Internet protocol adoption. Many studies analysed the public
bitcoin transaction history and found a set of heuristics that
help to link a Bitcoin account with real word identities.
Androulaki et al. [63] quantiﬁed the anonymity in a simulated
environment and found that almost half of the users can be
identiﬁed by their transaction patterns. Using two examples,
Bitcoin and Linden Dollars, the report focuses on the impact of
digital currencies on the use of ﬁat money. Gans and Halaburda
[64] analysed the economics of private digital currencies,
but they explicitly focus on currencies issued by platforms
like Facebook or Amazon (that retain full control), and not
decentralized currencies like Bitcoin. Dwyer [65] provided
institutional details about digital currency developments. The
security, privacy and anonymity issue related to Bitcoin has
been addressed by Krombholz et al. [66], in which they
surveyed 990 Bitcoin users to determine Bitcoin management
strategies and identiﬁes how users deploy security measures to
protect their keys and Bitcoins. They found that about 46% of
participants use web-hosted solutions to manage Bitcoins, and
over 50% use such solutions exclusively.
Among all the potential causes for operational risk,
the denial-of-service (DoS), or distributed-denial-of-service
(DDoS) attack is the prominent form suggested by Böhme et
al. [62], which entails swamping a target ﬁrm with messages
and requests in such volume that either mining pools or
exchanges become very slow and unusable. This type of attack
is especially effective on the Bitcoin ecosystem because of its
relative simplicity of monetising the attacks.
We need to consider another major risk of cryptocurrencies,
market risk, and how this affects the volatility of the currency
element.
IV.
MARKET RISK OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES
Market risk via price ﬂuctuation in the exchange rate is
inevitable for users holding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
Figure 1 shows the average US dollar-Bitcoin exchange rate,
along with its trading volume. It is clear that the market
volatility is tremendous for Bitcoin, leading to a high potential
market risk.
There is also some attention from the literature focusing on
the price dynamics and speculative bubbles in cryptocurrency
Figure 1: A Comparison Between Price and Volume [67].
markets. Cheah and Fry [68] claimed that cryptocurrencies are
prone to substantial speculative bubbles, and they found that
the fundamental value of Bitcoin is zero, by examining the
daily closing prices of Bitcoin from 2010 to 2014. A more
recent study is conducted by Blau [69], which emphasised that
the high volatility of Bitcoin is not related to the speculative
activities in this period. The volatility of Bitcoin has been
analysed by Katsiampa [70]), Cheah and Fry [68], and many
others.
Glaser et al. [71] suggest users treat Bitcoin as speculative
assets rather than as a type of currency. The diversiﬁcation ben-
eﬁts offered by Bitcoin is also studied by Briére, Oosterlinck
and Szafarz [72]. They found Bitcoin can offer diversiﬁcation
beneﬁts after looking into the correlation between Bitcoin and
other asset classes. Gandal and Halaburda [73] examined the
exchange rates of different virtual currencies to observe the
co-movement and identify the opportunities or triangular arbi-
trage. But they found little opportunity based on daily closing
prices. Yermack [74] analysed changes in Bitcoin price against
ﬁat currencies and concludes that its volatility undermines its
usefulness as currency. To be qualiﬁed as a currency, Bitcoin
needs to serve as an intermediary of exchange, as a unit of
account and store value. Also, they have been proved not to
be able to function as those by Bariviera et al. [75].
The market risk of cryptocurrencies is also reﬂected in
behavioural factors, such as trading volume and other exoge-
nous factors. Corbet et al. (2017) investigated the fundamental
drivers for cryptocurrency price behaviour, and found that
there is the existence of bubbles. Jiang (2017) reported the

246

2018, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
existence of long-term memory and the inefﬁciency of the
cryptocurrency market, using a similar approach. Alvarez-
Ramirez et al (2018) analysed long-term correlation and infor-
mation efﬁciency, and reported that the Bitcoin market exhibits
time-varying efﬁciency and price dynamics, which are driven
by anti-persistence. Bariviera et al. (2017) compared crytocur-
rencies with other standard currencies and found that the
hurst exponents changed signiﬁcantly in the initial stage and
stabilised thereafter. Bouri et al. (2018) found that the ﬁnancial
stress index could be used to forecast the price movement of
cryptocurrencies. Other behavioural factors were found by later
researchers. Feng et al. (2017) found evidence on informed
insider trading of Bitcoins prior to big events, implying that the
informed trading may contribute to explaining the dynamics
of the Bitcoin price. Dotsika and Watkins (2017) employed
keyword network analysis and identiﬁed potential disruptive
trends in block-chain technologies.
Next we turn to how cryptocurrencies relate to conventional
assets in the context of portfolio theory in order to understand-
where the weaknesses arise.
V.
CO-MOVEMENT OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES AND
PORTFOLIO THEORY
Despite extensive studies on the economic aspects of
cryptocurrencies, there are relatively fewer studies conducted
on analysing the inter-linkage of cryptocurrencies with other
ﬁnancial assets. A number of papers have analysed the ability
of cryptocurrencies, usually Bitcoin, to act as safe havens or
hedges mentioned by a series of papers such as [76]–[78].
Dyhrberg [76] analysed the hedge properties of Bitcoin using
a selection of explanatory variables such as gold (cash and
future), the dollar-euro and dollar-pound exchange rates and
the the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 (FTSE 100)
Index. The results of the GARCH model [79] showed that
Bitcoin can be used in hedging against the dollar and the UK
stock market, showing similar hedging capabilities to gold. In
Figure 2, we see how a basket of crypro-currencies compare
with each other based on price.
Bouri, Azzi and Dyhrberg [78] used a quantile regression
approach to analyse the relationships between Bitcoin and
global uncertainty. The ﬁndings demonstrate that at the longer
frequencies VIX have strong negative impact on Bitcoin re-
turns, while at the shorter frequencies uncertainty does have
positive and signiﬁcant impacts only on high quantiles. This
implies that Bitcoin can hedge against global uncertainty at
short investment horizons and in a bull regime only. Another
study by them in 2017 investigated interrelationships between
Bitcoin and the world equity indices, bonds, oil, gold, the
general commodity index and the US dollar index using the
bivariate DCC model by Engle [80]. The results show limited
evidence of hedging and safe haven properties of Bitcoin;
however, Bitcoin still can be an effective diversiﬁer.
Next, we carried out some empirical research using the
three largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple,
by addressing the impact of volatility, which we cover in the
next section.

THE EMPIRICAL TESTS, RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
In this section, we carry out some empirical tests on
the volatility of the three largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin,

Ethereum and Ripple. Figure 3 shows the market capitalisa-
tion of the largest three cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin,
Etherum, and Ripple. In this section, we will look into the
conditional volatility, correlations, causal relationships, time
variation on such relationships, and external factors that may
affect the relationships.

We model the conditional volatility for cryptocurren-
cies, by comparing different volatility models. We
present the ﬁndings on Bitcoin as the baseline cryp-
tocurrency. We examine the natural logarithm of the
closing price ratio of consecutive days from 28 April
2013 to 24 Feb 2018. The daily return of Bitcoin
index is 0.2435% with standard deviation of 0.04503.
The returns are negative skewed and leptokurtosis.
The p-value of the Jarqu-Bera test indicates that the
returns deviate from a normal distribution. We also
test there is signiﬁcant ARCH effect in the returns of
Bitcoin returns, suggesting the ARCH family models
as the more appropriate speciﬁcation to model. The
unit root test from ADF, PP and KPSS test shows the
return series from Bitcoin is stationary. The descriptive
statistics and unit root tests are presented as follows
in Table I.

the AR(1)-EGARCH(1,1) is the best speciﬁcation
based on the results of likelihood ratio test. We fore-
cast the conditional volatility from this speciﬁcation.
Figure 4 shows the persistence and asymmetry in
Bitcoin return volatility, especially around late 2013,
the beginning of 2015, and the end of 2017.
•
The contagion of spillover effects of multiple cryp-
tocurrencies can be investigated using trivariant-
GARCH models. The following Figure 5 exhibits
the covariance of each pair of cryptocurrencies. It
is evident that the covariance between these three
cryptocurrencies increases signiﬁcantly around the re-
cent one year compared to the initial one year. The
covariance between Ripple and Ethereum is more
sensitive to external economic conditions, implied by
the more volatile ﬂuctuations.
•
According to Markowitz portfolio theory, an asset that
is unrelated or even negatively correlated with another
asset in the portfolio is characterised as hedging
effective. Thus, it is worth looking into the correlation
among the major cryptocurrencies in terms of their
roles on portfolio diversiﬁcation. In this study, we

utilise the Granger causality test and vector autoregres-
sive (VAR) model, in order to investigate the short-
term dynamic causal relationship between different
pairwise cryptocurrencies. In Table II, we present the
ﬁndings for the short-run causality from different di-
rections, on the null hypothesis of no short-term causal
relationships. A p-value (Prob.) less than a predeﬁned
signiﬁcance level (5%) indicates a rejection of the
existence of a causal relationship. We ﬁnd that under
the condition of short-run exogenous economic shock,
Ripple has a signiﬁcant causal impact on the returns of
Bitcoin. And Etherum has a causal relationship with
Ripple. The direction of such causal relationship can
be seen in Figure 6, by impulse response function. We
ﬁnd positive causal relationships from all directions.
•
As indicated in the previous ﬁndings, cryptocurrencies
have entered into a more dynamic market with more
potential risks. Hence, we especially focus on the
recent full year from 2016 to 2017, to examine the
time variation of the causality. The following Figure

others by having an increasing covariance with the
other two. There is a signiﬁcantly positive causal
relationship from Bitcoin to other currencies, which
can be concluded according to the Granger block

responses from Ethereum and Ripple.
•
Other external factors may also become sources af-
fecting the market risk of cryptocurrencies. According
to the review of ﬁnancial literature, trading volume
is a main factor affecting the risks and returns of
ﬁnancial assets. Therefore, we examine the causal-
ity of behavioural factors like trading volume on
cryptocurrencies by implementing a VAR model and
Granger causality test. Table IV shows the causality
of volume from these three currencies to their returns.
We ﬁnd that the trading volume of Ripple has a
signiﬁcant causal relationship over Bitcoin and Bitcoin

VII.
A SUMMARY OF THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS
The design of Bitcoin presents distinctive risks that differ
from other payment methods and thus pose security issues
related to operational risk, market risk, and contagion risks
with other cryptocurrencies.
Operational risk occurs when certain actions undermines
the technical infrastructure and security assumption of crypo-
tocurrencies, such as fraudulence of exchanges, mining pool
inefﬁciency, double spending attacks, and online anonymity.
However, we know that a DoS or DDoS attack can be very
debilitating for blockchain systems.
Market risk lies in the unpredictable ﬂuctuations in the
price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As an agent for
the storage of value and price goods, the sharp movement of
exchange rate of Bitcoin will also cause liquidity issues.

Figure 8: The Impulse Response Function of the largest three
cryptocurrencies during 2016-2017 [67].
Contagion risk arises when the co-movement of price of
a bundle of cryptocurrencies becomes inevitable. This will
cause potential issues for portfolio diversiﬁcation, despite their
innovations and efﬁciencies. For instance, the Litecoin con-
ﬁrms transactions four time faster than Bitcoin, which is more
useful for the retail use and other time-sensitive transactions.
NXT [81] reduces the electronic and computational burden of
Bitcoin mining by replacing the proof-of-work mining with
proof-of-stake, assigning blockchain duties in proportion to
coin holdings. Zerocash [82], which is not yet operational, will
seek to improve privacy protections by concealing identiﬁers in
the public transaction history. Peercoin [83] allows a perpetual
1% annual increase in the money supply.
In looking at the empirical results, we can see that there is
a bi-directional potential contagion effect between each of the
cryptocurrencies, which will vary depending on economic con-
ditions. This demonstrates an increased risk of cross contagion
between different cryptocurrencies. This contagion appears to
be increasing over recent years, which would suggest the
contagion risks are increasing. These calculations will help
any potential user to consider the impact of these risks in the

In the next section, we analyse some of the largest success-
ful cyber breaches of cryptocurrencies in order to determine
whether there might be any weakness in the fundamental
blockchain component.
VIII.
AN ANALYSIS OF SOME OF THE LARGEST
SUCCESSFUL CRYPTOCURRENCY ATTACKS
In this section, we take a look at some of the largest
cryptocurrency breaches in recent years, in order to understand
how the breaches arose.
The earliest large scale breach to a cryptocurrency ex-
change was in 2010 due to the value overﬂow incident —
where an early ﬂaw in the bitcoin system allowed the intruder
to create 184 billion units of bitcoin. The value then was
$21.2bn, although at recent prices the value would have been
$1.8 quadrillion. It was notable for the speed at which it
was discovered and dealt with, resulting in no actual loss of
value. The perpetrator has never revealed themselves and their

original 0.5 BTC used in the exploit remains unspent to this
day, despite being valued at more than $3,000.
Jan 2018 - Tokyo based Coincheck suffered a $530 million
loss of crypto currency due to being hacked. Investigations
showed that this breach arose due to the Coincheck exchange
not using secure networks. Customer funds were stored in
“hot” wallets which were live to the internet, instead of using
“cold” wallets should have been ofﬂine and not visible to the
internet.
The 2014 Tokyo based Mt Gox lost $460 million following
a hack which was successful due to a combination of poor
management, neglect and sheer inexperience. This was the
second, and fatal, hack for the business, having already lost
$8.75 in June of 2011. This second hack resulted in bankruptcy
for the company and arrest for the CEO of the company.
The February 2018 hack on BitGrail was worth $195
million. While there was speculation that the BitGrail founder
Francesco Firano siphoned off the funds, he in turn insists it
was a hack.

In 2016, Bitﬁnex, another of the world’s largest bitcoin
exchanges was hacked and lost $72 million. The company
had used a different authorisation mechanism in an attempt to
make the system more robust, but did not realise their approach
had an exploitable weakness, which hackers duly discovered
and exploited. Rather than ceasing operations, Bitﬁnex reduced
the balance on all accounts by 36%, ragardless of whether
their account had been compromised to cover all the losses,
and were given an alternative cryptocurrency, BFX tokens, in
exchange which Bitﬁnex promised to buy back over time. As of
April 2017, Bitﬁnex had fully reimbursed all of its customers.
Also in 2016, the Decentralized Autonomous Organization
(DAO) which was created to operate like a venture capital
fund for decentralized cryptocurrency projects, built on a smart
contract on the Ethereum blockchain, were hacked. A hacker
drained $70 million within a few hours by exploiting a ﬂaw
that allowed the DAO smart contract to return Ether multiple
times before it updated its internal balance. The company
coders failed to realise the possibility that anyone would use
a recursive function to take advantage of this weakness. The
hack resulted in the hard fork of the Ethereum protocol that
resulted the creation of Ethereum Classic (ETC).
In December 2017, hackers attacked the NiceHash mining
service, and with the assistance of a compromised company
computer, made off with 4,400 bitcoins from customer ac-
counts worth $64 million. While the funds were not recovered,
NiceHash promised to compensate their customers in full.
Within a few weeks the lost bitcoins were back in customer
accounts.
In June 2018, Coinrail, a South Korean exchange, was the
target of an attack, losing around $37 million of cryptocur-
rencies Pundi X and Aston. Again, they were storing bitcoin
online. The remaining 70% of currency was rapidly switched to
ofﬂine storage. The attack was traced to an Ethereum address,
which has subsequently had its assets frozen.
In July 2017, the parity multisig wallet exploit was used
against three large Ethereum accounts, netting $32 million. The
owners of these accounts were believed to be the Ethereum-
powered casino Edgeless, decentralised commerce platform
Swarm City amd the smart contracts platform aeternity. All
three accounts had recently held initial coin offerings , thus
their wallets contained large amounts of money. Swarm City
recently conﬁrmed that it was one of the targets.
In June 2018, Bithumb, a South Korean exchange were hit
by hackers, reporting $31.5 million stolen.
In 2012, Bitcoinica, another large bitcoin trading platform
was hacked, losing 46,703 bitcoins. It subsequently transpired
that Bitcoinica stored large amounts of digital currency online,
as opposed to ofﬂine in secure servers. Just a few months later,
a second hack resulted in a further loss of another 18,547
bitcoin.
In every case of the above successful attacks, the inherent
strength of the blockchain algorithm behind these companies
was never in question. Rather, the success of the attacks came
down to successful exploitation of mostly human weaknesses,
poor decisions, poor management, neglect and sheer inexperi-
ence.
IX.
THE ROBUSTNESS OF THIS APPROACH FOR
SECURITY ISSUES
In previous sections, we have seen that there are a number
of key risks pertaining to cryptocurrencies, namely operational
risk, market risk, and contagion risks with other cryptocur-
rencies. In looking at the largest successful cryptocurrency
breaches, we can see that while the breaches were successful,
the underlying blockchain was never breached. The original
part-bitcoin leveraged to perpetrate the Mt Gox attack in
2014 has never been sold as this would provide proof to the
authorities who perpetrated the attack, which is testament to
the inherent strength of the blockchain.
In looking at a number of real world instances, we can
see that there are potential issues that must be considered.
Attacks, such as DoS and DDoS attacks, can prove lethal to
both functionality and performance, although Tripathi et al.
[84] have suggested a workaround to mitigate this particular
issue. One obvious approach is to discuss the matter with the
CSP to ensure they have the capacity to be able to handle such
an attack should it arise.
The majority of successful attacks are perpetrated against
the storage and containment technology in use, often utilising
social engineering or in a recent case, holding of BitCoin
owners to ransom until their BitCoins are transferred to the
criminal perpetrators.
There are clear core strengths contained in blockchain
technology, due to the high redundancy provided, but there
are practical concerns to be considered. The lack of a clear
economic methodology to pay for the use of the technology
presents a major concern, as does the volatility of the cryp-
tocurrencies inextricably linked to it. While the high value
of the cryptocurrency element provides a strong incentive
to attackers, if we remove this element by simply removing
the cryptocurrency, we can see that at one fell swoop, we
also lose operational risk, market risk, and contagion risks
with other cryptocurrencies. We also lose a huge volume of
transactional data involved in the trading of cryptocurrencies,
meaning we are left with blockchain only, the distributed
ledger element. With vastly reduced transactional volumes,
latency of operation will be much less of an issue.
There needs to be a sufﬁcient incentive for distributed
ledger providers to provide a highly secure, robust and low
latency mechanism to deliver the means to record irrefutable
transactional data rapidly enough to provide a high performing
system. It is certainly the case that the use of some blockchain
based mechanism to protect cloud instances could prove a very
useful means of doing so. However, it is also obvious that if
the blockchain ledgers are run within the same cloud instance
as the system they are trying to protect, then we would be
asking for trouble.
The obvious solution to this issue would be to truly
distribute the blockchain instances to a sufﬁciently diverse
number of locations, such as to make it difﬁcult for an
attacker to compromise all, or a sufﬁciently large number of
the ledgers to be able to force a permanent illicit change to
their own advantage. On the other hand, while the increased
number of distributed ledgers can signiﬁcantly increase the
security, it will also increase the cost and the latency of
processing transactions. An economic balance will need to be
determined. Carlsten et al. [85] warn of the potential instability

of bitcoin without the block reward, so clearly paying service
providers to run the blockchain would be required to provide
a sufﬁciently robust service. We would also have the option
of using the same approach with the Ethereum cryptocurrency,
which would offer the option of being able to deal with smart
contracts. However, for most purposes, the basic blockchain
will be more than adequate for our needs.
We have seen how Azaria et al. [86] have suggested a
similar approach to improve privacy with medical records.
Christidis and Devetsikiotis [87] have suggested the use of
both blockchain and smart contracts to improve security and
privacy for the Internet of Things. Dinh et al. [88] offer
a blockchain benchmarking system to compare the relative
efﬁciencies of differing blockchain and smart contract options.
Gaetani et al. [89] have proposed a blockchain based database
to ensure data integrity for cloud. Kiayias and Panagiotakos
[90] suggest the GHOST protocol at the core of Ethereum
could offer signiﬁcant increases in speed for transactional
recording. Yermack [91] suggests that the use of blockchain
can improve help to Corporate Governance. There is no doubt
that there is a great deal of interest in trying to apply this new
approach to make improvements for cloud users.
X.
DISCUSSION
Thanks to the major weakness posed by the cloud forensic
problem, the potential to lose both the audit trail and the
forensic trail means that recording the data we require to
remain compliant with the GDPR becomes a vitally important
task for us. The use of a distributed ledger holds great promise.
The blockchain approach affords us with increased redundancy,
meaning that an attacker will have to compromise a great many
of the distributed ledgers before they can have any impact
on the ledger contents. Some would see this as too much
redundancy. We would view this as just enough to provide
the required assurance. This can therefore provide us with a
very strong assurance that the consensus across the ledgers
will deliver a high level of comfort as to the veracity of the
contents. So, while this represents a big drawback for some,
for us, it represents a major advantage!
Some point to the huge volumes of processing generated
by the blockchain process as used in Bitcoin, suggesting that it
would be too computationally expensive for our purposes. We
take a different view. Because it is a cryptocurrency and highly
volatile, Bitcoin is subject to transactional volumes measuring
in multi-trillions per year. By stripping out the cryptocurrency
aspect from the equation, we also remove the need for such
extreme volumes of transactional data, rendering the approach
very manageable for any size of company.
Some express concerns at the impact of selﬁsh miners. We
take the view that by removing the need for mining from
the equation, and instead having the processing carried out
by credible parties for economic cost, this will remove any
incentive to try to mess with the system in this way. All
processors would be paid at the same rate for the job they
perform, so there would be no means available to them, nor
any incentive, to try to improve on that.
Yet others point to the dangers of DoS and DDoS attacks.
Given that there will be no direct ﬁnancial advantage to be
gained by attacking these blockchain ledgers, the volume of
attacks will likely reduce to a signiﬁcantly lower level. For a
large attack to be ﬁnancially viable, there has to be a huge
ﬁnancial incentive before it becomes worthwhile to spend the
kind of money it takes to perpetrate such an attack.
XI.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
It is clear that for any company using cloud, it will prove
virtually impossible to achieve compliance with the GDPR in
the event of a security breach due to the, as yet unresolved,
Cloud Forensic Problem. Discovering this fact after a cyber
breach will not be grounds for mitigation from the regulator
after the fact. It will be far too late by then. Therefore, cloud
users who require to be compliant with the GDPR will have
to take steps now to be thoroughly prepared ahead of time.
We have looked at the Operational Risk and the Mar-
ket Risk of cryptocurrencies as well as considering the co-
movement of cryptocurrencies in the light of portfolio theory.
Many of these risks arise through the perceived mass value
attributable to these cryptocurrencies and the mass transac-
tional processing volumes implicit in their operation. Clearly,
by removing the currency aspect from the equation, we can
eliminate a huge portion of the risk. We accept that all risk
will not be removed, but there will be a signiﬁcant reduction
in risk levels involved.
Our proposal will be to use the underlying concept of a
distributed ledger to ensure we are in a position to retain
some element of both audit trail and forensic trail data to
allow us to meet the compliance requirements of the GDPR,
which would otherwise be impossible in the event of a breach.
There will be a need to carry out some serious testing in order
to ﬁnd a satisfactory equilibrium between security, privacy,
performance, reliability, accessibility and the accountability we
require for GDPR compliance.
To that end, we plan to conduct a pilot case study on how
the technical aspects might be implemented in order to meet all
the required goals to ensure compliance can be achieved. This
will run around a miniature cloud in a box system, offering
both cloud-based and non-cloud based ledgers to assess what
the optimum conﬁguration might be.
