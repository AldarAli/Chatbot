Abstract—In 
this 
study, 
we 
present 
an 
experimental 
investigation 
of 
electrically 
actuated 
clamped-clamped 
microbeam resonators. The objective is to excite the higher 
order modes of the microbeams using partial electrodes with 
shapes that induce strong excitation of the mode of interest. 
The devices are fabricated using polyimide as a structural 
layer coated with Nickel from top and Chrome and Gold layers 
from bottom. Using a high frequency laser Doppler 
vibrometer, the first three resonance frequencies are revealed 
via white noise signals. Then, we studied the nonlinear 
dynamics of the microbeams near these resonance frequencies 
by applying forward frequency sweep with different electro 
dynamical loading conditions. The reported results prove the 
ability to excite higher order modes effectively using partial 
electrodes. Using a half electrode, the second mode is excited 
with high amplitude compared with almost zero response using 
the full electrode. Also, we present an experimental study of an 
electrically actuated clamped-clamped microbeam under a 
two-source harmonic excitation. The first frequency is swept 
around the first and second mode of vibration where the 
second one is fixed. The excitation of additive and subtractive 
type resonances is highlighted. In addition, we show that by 
properly tuning the frequency and the amplitude of the 
excitation force, the frequency bandwidth of the resonator is 
increased. Such micro-resonator is shown to be promising in 
gas and mass detection applications. 
Keywords-Electrostatic; multifrequency; resonator; higher 
order modes.

 INTRODUCTION 
Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) are devices 
and technologies that have been evolved from the 
microelectronics industry. Researchers have investigated 
different 
ways 
to 
create 
MEMS 
devices 
using 
microelectronic fabrication method. MEMS devices have 
attractive features, such as the smaller size, the ability to 
work in harsh environment, and power efficiency [1][2]. In 
particular, 
MEMS 
resonators 
composed 
mainly 
of 
microbeams are the main building block of many MEMS 
sensors and actuators that are used in variety of 
applications,such as toxic gas sensors [3], mass and 
biological sensors [4-7], temperature sensors [8], force and 
acceleration sensors [9], and earthquake detectors [10]. 
MEMS resonators are excited using different types of forces, 
such as piezoelectric [11][12], thermal [13], and electrostatic 
[10][14]. 
Electrostatic and electrodynamic excitations are the most 
commonly used method because of simplicity and 
availability 
[14][15]. 
The 
nonlinear 
dynamics 
of 
electrostatically actuated resonator is studied intensively and 
thoroughly in [14- 20]. 
MEMS resonators excited near their higher order modes 
have been proposed for mass and gas detection. Exciting the 
resonators near their higher order modes improve the 
sensitivity and the quality factor of the mass sensor. In [12], 
the sensitivity

where m is the cantilever mass,

n

frequency of the cantilever,
 'n
is the final resonance 
frequency after detecting a mass, b is the beam width, h  is 
the thickness and  is the air viscosity. As noticed from (1) 
and (2) the sensitivity and the quality factor are directly 
proportional to the excited mode number. High quality factor 
implies a sharper and stable resonance peak. This can be 
achieved through increasing 
n
 and decreasing
meff
; both 
are achieved through high-order mode excitations. 
 There is an increasing demand to develop resonant 
sensors with large frequency band and low power 
consumptions [3][4][21]. An efficient approach to improve 
the vibration of resonator and increase the frequency band is 
to use parametric excitation [16], secondary resonance [21], 
slightly buckled resonators [22] and multi frequency 
excitation [23]. A device with tunable resonant frequency for 
energy harvesting application is designed and tested in [24]. 
They increased the resonant frequency band up to 20%

 of 
the original resonant frequency using a permanent magnet. 
The effect of the double potential well systems on the 
resonant frequency band and their application in energy 
harvesting application is reviewed in [25]. Also, Cho et al. 
[26] they designed and characterized a carbon nanotube 
based nano-resonator for mass detection application, they 
proved that the resonator bandwidth is directly proportional 
to the forcing amplitude.

Recent research highlighted the interesting dynamics of 
mixed frequency excitation and their applications as sensors 
and actuators. Mixed frequency excitation of a micro mirror 
is studied intensively by Ilyas et al. [23].  They proposed 
mixed frequency excitation as way to improve bandwidth in 
resonators. Parametrically and harmonically excited a micro-
ring gyroscope at two different frequencies is investigated in 
[27]. Using this method, they increased the signal to noise 
ratio and improved the performance of the gyroscope.  In 
[28], they fabricated and characterized a device that harvests 
electromagnetic energy at the three different resonance 
frequencies of vibration. Moreover, the method of multi 
frequency excitation is implemented in [29] to perform 
mechanical logic operation where each frequency carries a 
different bit of information. In [30], the frequency mixing is 
exploited on the atomic force microscope (AFM) resonator 
to generate a high resolution imaging and extract the surface 
properties. 
Our goal is to excite the higher modes by changing the 
lower electrode configuration such that it, to some extent, 
resembles the excited mode shape of the clamped-clamped 
micro-beam.  As we can see in Figure 1, we use full 
electrode to excite first mode, half electrode to excite the 
second mode, and two-third electrodes spaced out along the 
beam length to excite the third mode. 
Motivated by the interesting dynamic behavior of 
clamped-clamped microstructures excited by a multi-
frequency electrical source and their wide range of 
applications, this paper also investigates the dynamics of the 
resonator shown in Figure 1 experimentally. 
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we 
present the fabrication process of the microbeams. The 
characterization setup and methodology used in extracting 
the data is presented in Section 3. In Section 4, we discuss 
and report the results to single frequency excitation near the 
first and second mode of vibration. The response to a multi 
frequency source is presented in Section 5. Summary of the 
results and the potential applications is discussed in Section 
6.  
II. 
FABRICATION 
The clamped-clamped microstructure resonators are 
fabricated using the in-house process developed in [31][32]. 
The process consists of six physical layers shown in Figure 2 
and set of rules that defines the allowed configuration and 
minimum feature size. The microstructure consists of 
a 6 m

polyimide structural layer coated with 500nm nickel 
layer 
from 
top 
and 
50nm
chrome
250nm
gold 
and50nm chrome from bottom. The chrome layer enhances 
the adhesion properties between gold and another materials 
The Nickel layer protects the microbeam during the 
polyimide etch. The lower electrode is placed directly 
underneath the microstructure and composed of gold and 
chrome layers. It spans half of the microstructure length and 
provides the actuation force to the resonator. The two 
electrodes are separated with a 2 m

air gap. When the two 
electrodes are connected to an external excitation voltage, 
the resonator vibrates in the out-of-plane direction. Figure 3 
shows a picture illustrating the various layers of the 
fabricated resonator. A 500
m
2
SiO is thermally grown to 
provide insulation and enhance the adhesion properties 
between the lower electrode and the wafer.

III. 
CHARECTRIZATION 
In this section, we describe the experimental set up used 
for testing the device and measuring the initial profile, gap 
thickness and the out-of-plane vibration. The experimental 
setup consists of a micro system analyzer (MSA) under 
which the microstructure is placed to measure the vibration, 
data acquisition cards and amplifier to provide actuation 
signals of wide range of frequencies and amplitudes, a 
vacuum chamber equipped with ports to pass the actuation 
signal and measure the pressure. Also, the chamber is 
connected to a vacuum pump that reduces the pressure as 
low as 4
.
mTorr  The microbeam movement is measured 
using the laser-Doppler vibrometer. The laser beam was 
focused onto the microstructure using the microscope and 
the x-y positioning stage. The measurement is based on 
interferometry, where the laser beam is split into two beams:  
one focused on the moving structure and the other one 
focused on a reference target. The difference between the 
two beams in phase and distance traveled will be translated 
into displacement or velocity of the microstructure as a 
function of the frequency and time. The setup is shown in 
Figure 4. 
A. Topography Characterization 
The initial profile of the microstructure is revealed using 
an optical profilometer. After defining the vertical scanning 
range and exposure time, a 3-D map of the microbeam is 
generated, as depicted in Figure 5. The combined thickness 
of the microstructure and air gap is around 9 m

, which is 
slightly smaller from the design nominal value of 
9.35
m.
Also, the microbeam total length is 400 m

and the 
profile is fully straight without any curvature or curling. 
B. Static Characterization 
To characterize the device we initially biased the 
microbeam by a slow DC ramp voltage - generated using the 
data acquisition card - and measured the static deflection. 
The experimental result is reported in Figure 6. The 
deflection increases until it exhibits pull in at 168V for a 
clamped beam with half electrode actuation. 
C. Natural frequencies 
We experimentally measured the first three natural 
frequencies by connecting the wire-bonded chip to the MSA 
function generator and applying a white noise signal. The 
MSA measures the microstructure vibration at the laser point 
position. Also, it has the capability to reveal the mode shape 
of the vibration.

Figure 8(c)), there are two nodal points. These results match 
the clamped-clamped structure first, second and third 
vibration mode shapes. 
IV. 
HIGHER ORDER MODES RESULTS 
We experimentally investigate the nonlinear response of 
the microbeams near the first two resonance frequencies via 
frequency sweep tests. The micro-beams are excited using 
the data acquisition card and the vibration is detected using 
the MSA. The excitation signal is composed of an AC signal 
VAC
superimposed to a DC signal
VDC .
 The frequency 
response curve is generated by taking the steady state 
amplitude of the motion and focusing the laser at the mid-
point of the microbeam for the first measurement and at

measurement. In the following subsection, the frequency  
 
response curves are reported for the different microbeams 
with full and half electrode actuation at different 
electrodynamical loadings and at 4mTorr  chamber pressure. 
A. First Mode 
Figures 9 and 10 show the variation of the frequency 
response curve as the AC voltage is increased for different 
lower electrode configuration near the first resonance. As 
expected, using the full electrode configuration we achieved 
higher amplitude near the first mode compared with the half 
electrode configurations under the same conditions of electro 
dynamical loading and vacuum chamber pressure. Also, a 
hardening effect is reported due to the cubic nonlinearities 
from mid-plane stretching. 
B. Second Mode 
Figure 11 shows the variation of the frequency response 
curve as the AC voltage is increased near the second mode 
resonance for the half electrode configuration. Using a half 
electrode, the second mode is excited with high amplitude 
compared with no response using the full electrode 
configuration. In addition, a hardening effect is reported due 
to the cubic nonlinearities. 
V. 
MULTIFREQUENCY EXCITATION RESULTS 
We experimentally investigated the nonlinear response of 
the microbeams to a multi-frequency excitation near the first 
and second resonance frequencies. The microbeams are 
excited using the data acquisition card and the vibration is

These resonances arise due to the cubic nonlinearity coming 
from the midplane stretching effect and the electrostatic 
force. Also, as

increases the response curves tilt towards 
the lower frequency values (softening). Figure 14 and 15 
show the result for different values of

electrodynimacal loading condition near the first and second

CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we investigated the dynamics of clamped-
clamped microbeam with full and half lower electrode 
configuration. These microbeams are electrically actuated by 
an AC source with variable frequency superimposed to a DC 
voltage. We proved the ability to excite the second mode 
resonance by using a half electrode configuration. Also, a 
hardening behavior is reported due to the cubic nonlinearities 
among all the excited modes due to the dominating effect of 
mid-plane stretching. In addition, we investigated the 
dynamics of clamped-clamped microbeams electrically 
actuated by two harmonic AC sources with different 
frequencies superimposed to a DC voltage. Moreover, the 
ability to excite the combination resonance of additive and 
subtractive type is proved. 
This capability of exciting the higher order modes can 
have a promising application in MEMS-based mass, gas and 
humidity sensors. In addition, the ability to broaden the 
bandwidth of the resonator is shown by reducing the 
frequency of the fixed source. These capabilities of 
generating multiple peaks and a high response band with 
ability to control its amplitude and location can have a 
promising application in increasing the resonator band width, 
mechanical logic circuits, energy harvesting and mass 
sensing.
