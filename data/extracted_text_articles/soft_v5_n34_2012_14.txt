Abstract—Although software process improvement (SPI) 
may bring immediate positive results, this does not imply 
that the results will sustain in the long run. In order to 
succeed with continuous process improvement and sustain its 
results, organizations need to be aware of what makes their 
SPI efforts successful or unsuccessful. This paper presents 
thirty three factors that primarily contribute to the success 
and sustainability of SPI efforts. The factors are organized 
into three categories: (1) organizational factors related to the 
organizational 
structure, 
politics 
and 
culture, 
(2) 
implementation factors related to the planning, preparation, 
execution and management of the SPI projects and (3) social 
factors dealing with human behavior and reactions in the 
SPI context.  
 
Keywords- SPI; success factors; sustainability factors; 
attributes; SPI  status; lasting results  
I. INTRODUCTION 
Many software companies today invest time and 
resources in Software Process Improvements (SPI) in hope 
of increasing the effectiveness of their software processes. 
Despite this, not much evidence has been provided on the 
sustainability of the SPI results and gains [1]. Most of the 
reports published so far mainly give an account of the 
short-term gains instead. Furthermore, few authors have 
stated that the money and effort invested in SPI do not 
always lead to successful and long-lasting SPI results [2].  
Even if SPI efforts show immediate gains, it is not a 
guarantee that the gains will be long lasting and 
sustainable [3]. Processes undergoing improvement may 
demonstrate temporary gains as a result of initial 
organizational enthusiasm, eagerness and/or desire to do 
SPI. These gains, however, may not survive in the long 
run. The organizations may quickly reverse to the previous 
software process (pre-SPI), and thereby, make the SPI 
efforts a waste of time and resources. The reasons for 
failing with SPI might be many, such as, for instance, lack 
of long-term management support, weakening provision of 
SPI resources, ill-alignment of SPI with the business goal.  
To succeed with long-term SPI, organizations should 
continuously plan, monitor and control their SPI efforts 
and progress. They should continuously identify the 
reasons contributing to the decay or success of SPI and 
take appropriate measures. In this way, they will become 
more conscious of their SPI efforts and their opportunities 
and limitations which, in turn, will make them more aware 
of the factors contributing to the long-term success or 
failure of SPI.  
Even though research on SPI is not new and a large 
number of studies have been dedicated to process 
improvement, there is no combined expertise on what 
factors contribute to the long-term SPI success. A large 
number of empirical and theoretical studies list factors 
contributing to SPI success [2], [4-17]. None of them, 
however, focus on the long-term sustainability of the SPI 
efforts. In addition, some factors contributing to success 
and sustainability of SPI effort can be extracted from the 
case studies on SPI implementation [3], [18-30]. The 
studies either suggest different ways of improving 
processes, or they report on their experiences and lessons 
learnt or they discuss the incorporation of the process 
improvement 
activities 
into 
software 
development 
processes. To the authors' best knowledge, there is no 
study providing an exhaustive list of factors aiding 
software organizations in sustaining their SPI results.  
In this paper, we elicit thirty three factors that primarily 
contribute to the success and sustainability of SPI efforts. 
Our goal is to create a basis for identifying factors that 
contribute to successful and sustainable SPI which, in turn, 
will aid software companies in defining, planning, 
monitoring and improving their SPI efforts, and in 
sustaining their results. This paper is an enhanced version 
of the previous study of the SPI sustainability success 
factors that have been published in [1].  
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section II presents background of the field. Section III 
describes the method used during this study. Section IV 
lists and provides descriptions of thirty three SPI 
sustainability success factors. Finally, Section V discusses 
the results of this study, presents final remarks and 
suggests future work. 
II. BACKGROUND  
In this section, we provide background about current 
software process improvement models. Section II.A 
describes general and common stages of software process 
improvement process. Section II.B presents process 
capability and maturity assessment models to be used in 
SPI. Section II.C presents software process improvement 
approaches existing today. Finally, Section II.D lists 
software development methods that incorporate the 
practices of process improvement.   
A. Software Process Improvement  
Software process improvement is a set of SPI activities 
leading to an improved software process quality, and 
thereby, to an improved software product quality [31]. 
Each SPI effort is unique in its design. It strongly differs 
with respect to the individual and cultural characteristics 
and needs of an organization and the status of the 
processes undergoing improvement [32], [33]. For this 
reason, it may be difficult to suggest a process model that 
is suitable for all kinds of SPI contexts.

Many researchers have proposed high level SPI 
models, such as [31], [34-36]. These models differ in their 
designs. Nevertheless, they have defined common cyclic 
stages that are believed to bring maximum benefit to the 
improving process and business. The most accepted 
representation of the continuous SPI is illustrated in 
Figure 1. Its cyclic phases are:   
 Plan (SPI planning): aiming at defining process 
improvement goals and vision, as well as identifying 
process improvement activities and creating a process 
change plan.   
 Do (Process change): aiming at changing the process 
according to the planned improvement.  
 Check (Process 
review): aiming at assessing/ 
reassessing/measuring the process according to the 
goals of the process improvement, analyzing the 
process and its measurements and comparing them to 
the expected results.  
 Act/Adjust (Process adjustment): aiming at requesting 
the corrective actions in order to reach planned results 
and determining the weaknesses and potential 
improvements of the SPI process.  
B. Process Capability and Maturity Assessment Models 
There is a large amount of process maturity models that 
have been designed to help software organizations to 
assess the status of their software processes and identify 
the areas of future improvement. The best known ones are 
CMM 
(Capability 
Maturity 
Model) 
[37], 
CMMI 
(Capability Maturity Model Integration) [38] and SPICE 
(Software 
Process 
Improvement 
and 
Capability 
dEtermination) [39]. 
Both CMM and its improved version CMM Integration 
(CMMI) is a standardized framework for process 
assessment and improvement [37] [38]. Both models 
provide software organizations with a roadmap for process 
standardization and improvement. Their frameworks are 
based on the implementation of the key practices within 
certain 
key 
process 
areas 
according 
to 
the 
set 
improvements goals and the desired maturity level. CMM 
and CMMI define five maturity levels for process 
assessment.   The  maturity  levels  of  CMMI  are:   Initial, 
Managed, Defined, Qualitatively Managed and Optimizing 
[38]. CMM has a staged representation implying that the 
improvements are targeted to increase the company’s 
overall  capability/maturity  level.   CMMI,  on  the   other 
hand, in addition to the staged representation also  includes 
 
Figure 1. Continuous Software Process Improvement Cycle 
the continuous representation implying that improvements 
are focused on companies’ specific target process areas. 
With this structure, CMMI aims to help software 
organizations to assess their organizational maturity or 
process 
area 
capability, 
establish 
priorities 
for 
improvement, and implement these improvements [38]. 
SPICE, also known as ISO 15504, is an international 
reference model for process assessment and improvement. 
The model can be used for process assessment and its 
capability determination. In the similar way as CMMI, 
SPICE is organized into six capability levels that 
characterize the process as: Incomplete, Performed, 
Managed, Established, Predictable and Optimizing. The 
capability levels, in turn, consist of process attributes, 
which further consist of generic practices. SPICE model 
provides tools for standardized process assessment and 
suggestions for defining process maturity. [39] 
C. Software Process Improvement Approaches 
Other process improvement approaches or methods can 
be used as an addition to or as an alternative for capability 
maturity models. The most commonly used SPI 
approaches are SixSigma [40] and IDEAL [41].  
SixSigma is business management approach for 
improving engineering and development processes. It is a 
disciplined data driven approach aiming at improving a 
development process by identifying and removing the 
causes of product defects. Using a measurement-based 
strategy, SixSigma defines how the process is performing 
and how it should be improved. The improvement of the 
existing process is done by following five iterative steps: 
1) define the defects and project goals, 2) measure the 
process attributes with respect to its quality and efficiency, 
3) analyze the process and determine the root causes of 
defects, 4) improve the process by eliminating the defined 
defects, and 5) implement control mechanisms for 
sustaining the achieved improvements. [40] [42]  
IDEAL is a process improvement implementation 
model that has been primarily designed for supporting the 
implementation of CMM and CMMI maturity models [43]. 
It encompasses five stages of a process improvement 
cycle. Those are the following: 1) Initialize: start the 
improvement program, 2) Diagnose: assess the current 
state of the process, 3) Establish: set the implementation 
strategy and improvement program, 4) Act: implement 
process 
improvements, 
5) 
Leverage: 
analyze 
the 
improvement effort and revise the approach.  [34] [41] 
D. Software Development Methods that Contain SPI 
Practices 
Many 
of 
the 
software 
development 
methods 
incorporate process improvement activities into their 
development activities. The best known ones are Lean and 
Scrum. 
Lean software development guides organizations on 
how to deliver increments of real business value in short 
time boxes, by means of optimizing/improving their 
software processes [44]. In the core of Lean software 
development, there are seven principles aiming at 
continuous improvement of the process based on the 
identification and elimination of the inefficiencies (waste) 
in the process [45]. The core principles are the following: 
1) eliminate waste, 2) amplify learning, 3) decide as late as 

325

possible, 4) deliver as fast as possible, 5) empower team, 
6) build in product quality, and 7) see the whole [45]. 
Scrum is a well-known iterative, incremental, light-
weight and agile method for software project management. 
It is most often used in small or medium-sized 
development organizations. The method is focused on 
managing software development projects by means of 
strictly defined: 1) roles, such as scrum master, product 
owner and the team, 2) meetings, such as daily standups, 
release and sprint planning meetings, retrospectives and 
demos, and 3) process artifacts, such as product and sprint 
backlog [46]. Scrum incorporates in itself continuous 
process reviews that are done at the end of each 
development iteration, called sprint. This contributes to the 
light weighted continuous process improvement [32].  
III. METHOD  
In this section, we present our research method. We 
first present the research steps in Section III.A. We then 
describe the questionnaire used in one of the research steps 
in Section III.B. Finally, in Section III.C, we describe the 
validity of our results. 
A. Research Steps 
The overall research consisted of the three following 
steps: (1) Literature Study, (2) Empirical Study, and (3) 
Data Analysis.  
During the first two steps, we elicited SPI sustainability 
success factors, first by reviewing literature and then by 
interviewing software practitioners. These two steps were 
conducted independently. This implies that the results of 
the first step did not constitute input to the second step, and 
vice versa. In the third step, we combined and analyzed the 
results as achieved in the first two independently done 
steps. Below, we briefly describe the three steps.  
1) 
Literature Study 
During the literature study, we reviewed more than 45 
publications dealing with SPI projects. These were mainly 
experience reports and case studies that had been retrieved 
from IEEE, ACM, Springer, John Wiley and Sons, and 
other publishers. Out of them, we chose 27 empirical 
reports describing conditions contributing to or subtracting 
from the success of SPI projects [2-27], [30]. Our goal was 
to draw out factors that contributed to the sustainability of 
SPI efforts.  
The majority of the publications studied mainly 
reported on the empirical process improvement projects. 
They did not focus on outlining the conditions contributing 
to the success of SPI efforts. However, some of the 
conditions could be indirectly recognized out of their 
contexts and results. Only three publications provided 
direct and explicit feedback on critical SPI success factors. 
These were [4-6]. 
Based on the literature studied, we drew out factors that 
were critical for a successful initiation and implementation 
of SPI, and successful preservation of its results. This step 
resulted in a preliminary list of SPI sustainability success 
factors. Having this list as a basis, we reviewed the 
publications anew, now with the purpose of studying their 
explicit and implicit descriptions of the success factors, 
their contexts, and impact on the sustainability of the SPI 
efforts. This step resulted in twenty seven SPI success 
factors.

2) 
Empirical Study 
During the empirical study, we interviewed 45 
software engineers who had been involved in or who had 
been affected by SPI projects. Among the interviewees, 
there were twenty seven software developers, ten testers, 
seven development managers and one SPI manager. They 
came from twelve different medium-sized software 
organizations, located in Sweden (23 participants), 
Vietnam (18 participants), Bangladesh (2 participants), 
China (1 participant) and Island (1 participant). 
Each interviewee was interviewed only once, in a tête à 
tête manner. Twenty seven interviews were recorded and 
then transcribed. The other eighteen interviews were not 
recorded due to the fact that the interviewees felt ill at ease 
to be recorded. However, the interviews with them were 
thoroughly documented during and after each interview. 
On average, the individual interviews lasted for forty 
minutes. 
All 
the 
interviews 
were 
analyzed 
using 
the 
hermeneutics approach [47]. The SPI success factors listed 
by the interviewees were analyzed and grouped together 
when concerning the same or similar issues. The factors 
that were mentioned by more than one interviewee were 
joined together and given a common name. The factors 
that were mentioned by only one interviewee were not 
included in this paper at all.  
3) 
Data Analysis  
During the Data Analysis step, we analyzed the results 
of the literature study and the empirical data using the 
hermeneutics approach [47]. Here, we identified and 
analyzed the sustainability factors as drawn out in the 
former study steps (the literature and empirical study 
steps). In total, we identified thirty three SPI sustainability 
success factors, out of which twenty four factors were 
commonly identified in both literature and empirical 
studies. Out of twenty seven success factors identified in 
the literature, three were not confirmed during the 
empirical study. In addition, six out of the thirty factors 
identified during the empirical study had not been 
identified in the literature studied.  
Finally, we combined all the elicited factors, organized 
them into categories and put them into a list of SPI 
sustainability success factors. It is this list that constitutes

the body of this paper and a foundation for the creation of 
the SPI health attributes in [48].  
B. Questionnaire 
When educing knowledge about the SPI success 
factors, 
we 
used 
open-ended 
and 
semi-structured 
interviews [47]. This helped us encourage our interviewees 
to provide additional information that might be found 
useful for understanding the factors.  
The interview structure was based on the questionnaire 
presented in Table I. Its questions were aimed at 
identifying both success and failure factors. Therefore, the 
questionnaire was structured into the following five groups 
of questions: (1) reasons for why SPI efforts have been 
lasting, (2) reasons for why SPI efforts have not been 
lasting, (3) factors contributing to the SPI sustainability, 
(4) factors preventing the SPI sustainability, and finally, 
(5) suggestions for how to keep the SPI efforts sustainable.  
C. Validity   
All the qualitative research methods encounter validity 
threats [47]. Those threats concern construct validity, 
internal validity and external validity. 
Construct validity refers to the degree to which 
inference can be made from the operational definition of a 
variable to the theoretical constructs [49]. The main threat 
to construct validity is to guarantee that the right measures 
have been chosen for the study. Here, the risk was that we 
might use wrong measures, and as a result, we might 
misinterpret the SPI sustainability success factors. To 
minimize this threat, we conducted both theoretical and 
empirical studies. Moreover, we employed the multiple 
sources of data during the empirical study by interviewing 
different roles in twelve different organizations. 
Internal validity refers to the degree of inferences of 
the cause-effect or causal relationships in the study [49]. 
The main threat to internal validity for the literature study 
was the fact that we might misinterpret the conclusions 
presented in the literature or use too few literature sources. 
Therefore, in this study, we first made a comprehensive 
search in various scientific sources out of which we 
extracted 27 experience reports. The main internal validity 
threat for the empirical study was that the interviewees 
might have misunderstood the impacts on the SPI 
sustainability. To minimize this threat, we used various 
roles involved in SPI in different software organizations. 
External validity refers to the degree of whether the 
sample findings can be generalized [49]. The main 
external validity threat to our empirical study was the fact 
that the SPI sustainability factors that had been identified 
during the interviews were based on the experiences of 
only 45 individuals who belonged to medium-sized 
software companies. Therefore, we believe that the 
empirical findings of this study should be found more 
useful 
for 
medium-sized 
software 
companies. 
Nevertheless, by incorporating them with the results of the 
literature study, we are confident that our findings and 
conclusions are useful for all sizes of software companies 
whether large, medium-sized or small.  
IV. SPI SUSTAINABILITY SUCCESS FACTORS   
In this section, we present the identified factors that 
lead to the success and sustainability of the SPI efforts. 
Some of them have direct influence over the SPI success 
and sustainability whereas some other factors have an 
indirect influence. Therefore, when describing them, we 
state their influence wherever it is relevant. 
Based on both literature and empirical studies, we have 
identified thirty three SPI sustainability success factors. 
During the literature study, we have identified twenty 
seven SPI success factors, out of which twenty four factors 
overlapped with the factors that have been identified 
during the empirical study. The interviews have 
additionally resulted in six new SPI factors.  
Just 
because 
these 
two 
studies 
were 
done 
independently, they had led to two groups of SPI success 
factors: (1) the ones that are common to the two studies, 
and (2) the ones that have been elicited within one type of 
a study but not within the other. When describing them in 
this section, we clearly identify their sources. Additionally, 
we list them and their sources in Tables II, III and IV. 
To facilitate our presentation, we group the elicited SPI 
sustainability success factors into three categories as 
defined in [18]. These are organizational factors, 
implementation factors and social factors. The factors are 
described in Sections IV.B, IV.C and IV.D that follow 
Section IV.A, which briefly presents the core SPI roles that 
may vary in different academic and industrial contexts.   
A. Roles 
Many different roles are involved in process 
improvement. Their naming and responsibilities vary in 
different academic and industrial contexts. For this reason, 
we identify and define the following roles involved in SPI:  
 Stakeholder: a person or a group that is involved in or 
affected by SPI. Stakeholders include all the internal 
and external roles that are influenced by SPI.  
 Technical staff: a group consisting of developers, 
testers, development managers, support personnel and 
other roles involved in executing the process 
undergoing the improvement. They are the “doers” 
within the process undergoing improvement, and 
therefore, they get affected by the process change the 
most. 
 External SPI leader: a person or a group that is in 
charge of the overall SPI process. He/she initiates the 
improvement projects, requests resources, encourages 
local 
improvement 
efforts 
and 
establishes 
communication channels between different groups. 
External SPI leader is not the doer in the process to be 
improved. For this reason, he/she is seen as an external 
and independent role. 
 Internal SPI leader: a person or a group within the 
technical staff who is responsible for supporting and 
following the SPI strategy on a local process level. 
B. Organizational Factors    
Organizational factors are critical success factors that 
are related to the organizational structure, politics and 
culture [18]. They have a substantial impact on the SPI 
effort and its sustainability. 
Table II shows nine organizational factors. We have 
grouped them into three clusters: 1) Support of SPI 
focusing on the management support and sponsorship of 
the SPI project, 2) Resources targeting people resources 
required for conducting the SPI project, and 3) Alignment 

327
International Journal on Advances in Software, vol 5 no 3 & 4, year 2012, http://www.iariajournals.org/software/
2012, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
aiming at aligning SPI with the organization-related 
factors. The organizational SPI success factors are 
following:  
1) 
Management continuously supports and committs 
to the SPI process 
To provide long-term sustainable results, software 
improvement requires continuous investment in time, 
resources and effort. This, in turn, requires that 
management is strongly committed to and continuously 
supports the SPI efforts [6], [7], [18], [20], [28]. Strong 
management commitment helps retain high priority of the 
SPI projects and the continuous management support helps 
assure continuous supply of the required resources. It is 
especially important in the initial SPI phases during which 
the cost of the SPI activities is higher than the initially 
expected and planned cost [4].  
Even our interviewees have stated that SPI projects 
need investment in time and resources in order to achieve 
sustainable results. According to them, this cannot be 
achieved without commitment and support of top 
management. Without management support, the SPI effort 
and results are doomed to decay. Our interviewees have 
also pointed out that management should prioritize the SPI 
activities and assign resources to them. This will prevent 
the SPI activities from getting neglected.  
2) 
Resources are dedicated to SPI  
Resources that are fully or partly dedicated to the SPI 
activities are the most important organizational SPI 
success factor. As many as 72% of SPI improvement 
projects have suffered from lack of resources and constant 
time pressure [4], [8], [19], [26].  
According to the literature studied, SPI projects need to 
have dedicated time and resources. SPI projects cannot run 
on their own. Investment in resources has been recognized 
not only for starting and implementing the SPI projects but 
also for sustaining the achieved results [4], [5], [8], [9], 
[11], [18], [21], [26].  
Our interviewees were of the same opinion. According 
to them, without dedicated resources, SPI can only rely on 
the engagement of individuals. The engagement however 
tends to decrease with time. Therefore, to guarantee the 
sustainability of the SPI efforts, it is important to dedicate 
resources to both the SPI and to the process undergoing the 
SPI. 
3) 
SPI responsibilities are clearly specified and 
compensated 
Clarity in the definition of the SPI roles and their 
responsibility assignments are very important. According 
to the literature studied, people involved in SPI should 
have clear responsibilities and compensation for their 
effort [4], [5]. If they are assigned to the SPI related tasks, 
they should be relieved from other tasks. Time dedicated to 
the SPI activities should be compensated in the same 
manner as other work. Otherwise, the SPI activities may be 
done in a rush, they may be neglected, they may be 
delayed or they may even be forgotten.   
Our interviewees were of the same opinion. According 
to them, process related problems often start when no one 
is responsible for the process. 
4) 
Competent external SPI leaders are designated   
According to the literature studied, the level of 
competency, experience, commitment and engagement of 
the external SPI leaders can greatly determine the success 
of the SPI projects [4-6], [18]. However, as [4], [5] claim, 
this may not always be enough. Authority and respect paid 
to the external SPI leaders is just as important. Even if the 
SPI leaders are in a privileged position, it still does not 
imply that they have high enough authority, trust and 
respect among the technical staff members. If so, then their 
ideas may not be supported and successfully transmitted to 
the process change [4-6], [18]. Trust and respect may only 
be gained via personal qualities such as honesty, 
credibility, reliability, experience, reputation and good 
leadership.

The importance of the external SPI leaders was also 
raised 
during 
the 
interviews. 
According 
to 
our 
interviewees, to make the SPI results last, there should be 
an external SPI leader, a person or a group of people who 
have knowledge of SPI and who take on the responsibility 
of driving it. The external SPI leader should lead the 
people and guide the process towards a continuous and 
sustainable improvement. 
5) 
Internal SPI leaders are designated 
Since external SPI leaders and managers are not 
directly involved in the development process, it is 
important to have internal leaders as well. According to the 
literature studied, the internal SPI leaders are recognized as 
important SPI actors since they take on the immediate 
responsibility for leading and supporting continuous 
process improvement [6], [7], [20], [21]. By possessing 
knowledge of the process, they are able to adapt the 
improvement suggestions to the different needs of the 
development teams, projects and cultures. They help SPI 
activities get started and their engagement aids in winning 
support of their team members towards SPI [20].  
The importance of designating internal SPI leaders was 
also recognized during the interviews. According to our 
interviewees, the involvement of the internal SPI leaders 
helps spread commitment to the process and create strong 
process ownership. Internal leadership creates continuous 
control that the development process is followed in a 
correct way and that the technical staff is engaged in SPI. 
6) 
The level of technical staff turnover is low  
According to our interviewees, high people turnover 
can become a significant barrier to the sustainability of the 
SPI efforts. When the key employees leave the company, 
so does the knowledge of the process and SPI. With a high 
technical staff turnover, more effort needs to be spent on 
the education and training of the new hires.  
7) 
SPI is aligned with business goals 
The goals of SPI projects should not only go in line 
with the standardization of the process and quality 
standards, but also with the business goals of the company. 
According to the literature studied, alignment of SPI goals 
with the organizational business goals contributes to the 
better management of, commitment to and support of the 
SPI projects [12], [13], [18], [21], [22].  
8) 
SPI is aligned with organizational policies and 
strategies  
Improvement projects often conflict with the existing 
organizational policies by requiring changes to the routines 
and processes that are common to the whole organization. 
Therefore, as stated in the literature studied, organizational 
policies have to be aligned with the SPI goals and vice 
versa.  
In cases when organizations do not have any policies, 
they have to establish ones and make the process 
standardization and improvement coherent with them. 
Lack of organizational policies to support process changes 
can potentially become a big barrier for a successful 
process improvement [4], [19], [21], [26].  
9) 
SPI methods are tailored to specific organizational 
contexts and needs 
Each organization is different with respect to its 
structure, culture and policies. For this reason, as stated in 
the literature studied, SPI initiatives should consider the 
contextual specifics of the organizational culture, product 
characteristics, customer availability and people influenced 
by the process. The adaptation of process improvement 
methods to the specific organizational contexts and needs 
helps address individual problems and contributes to 
sustainable SPI efforts [6], [18].   
The interviews have led to the same conclusion. 
According to our interviewees, if the SPI is not aligned 
with the organizational needs, or if it does not fit the 
established organizational and national culture, then it is 
more difficult to win people’s support and commitment. 
Moreover, the people will resist process changes and the 
results achieved by SPI will be easily lost. 
C. Implementation Factors 
We have elicited fourteen implementation factors. 
They are all related to the planning, preparation, execution 
and management of the SPI projects. As shown in Table 
III, they are grouped into four clusters: 1) Education and 
knowledge focusing on training and expertise of 
stakeholders, 2) SPI strategy targeting preparation and 
vision of the SPI project, 3) SPI management and 
execution dedicated to issues related to management and 
execution of the SPI project, and 4) Continuity of SPI 
effort focusing on the mechanisms for enabling the 
continuity of the SPI effort. The factors are the following:  
1) 
Stakeholders are trained in software process  
Process improvement often implies changes to the 
process in form of introduction, removal or modification of 
new techniques and practices. Hence, as pointed out in the 
literature studied, the technical staff needs to be trained in 
the process and its techniques and practices in order to 
fully understand their role in the process change. They 
need to be prepared for the process improvement and 
understand the reasons behind each suggested change. 
Moreover, other stakeholders that are affected by SPI 
should also receive necessary training. Otherwise, they 
will less likely follow the new process [19]. For this 
reason, it is needed to train the stakeholders in the new 
process, new techniques and practices not only for 
supporting the implementation of process changes but also 
for sustaining improvement results. In organizations or 
cultures where knowledge of the process is low, the 
training in the process is even more important [26]. The 
levels of training may differ from stakeholder to 
stakeholder with respect to the stakeholders’ training needs 
and their level of involvement in SPI.   
The need for adequate process training was also raised 
during the interviews. According to our interviewees, all 
the company employees need to have necessary training in 
the new method in order to understand it and to be able to 
follow it properly and dedicatedly. The process training 
increases employee motivation in the SPI and decreases 
resistance to process change.   
2) 
Stakeholders are continuously mentored and 
coached  
Training in the new process contributes to its 
understanding and allows stakeholders to follow it 
dedicatedly. Still however, according to the literature 
studied, training in the software process may not be 
enough. Some stakeholders may misunderstand the process 
or continue following old techniques and practices. 
Therefore, the stakeholders should be mentored and 
coached in SPI and the process changes. [7], [23].

According to our interviewees, the internal SPI leaders 
and other stakeholders responsible for the improvement 
activities have to be coached by the experienced external 
SPI leaders on how to implement improvements and how 
to follow the new process. Continuous mentoring and 
coaching increases the credibility of the strategic SPI 
decisions and contributes to building trust both in those 
decisions and in the new process.  
3) 
SPI leaders possess experience and expertise in 
SPI  
Process improvement implies changes to the deeply 
ingrained organizational culture, habits, working patterns 
and manners that have been developed throughout a long 
time. To change them is very difficult. According to the 
literature studied, however, it is easier to change them if 
the SPI team possesses enough knowledge and experience 
in implementing software process improvement changes. If 
there is lack of such knowledge and experience, then there 
is a risk of using unsuitable SPI strategy and of having 
poor SPI execution, which could potentially fail the SPI 
projects [7-9], [19], [25], [29].  
Our interviews have also led to the same conclusion. 
The interviewees have mentioned the importance of the 
experience and expertise to be possessed by the SPI 
leaders.   
4) 
SPI goals and objectives are clear and realistic 
SPI projects should have clearly specified goals and 
objectives. Our literature study shows that clear, realistic 
and well communicated SPI goals contribute to good 
understanding of the SPI process and assurance that they 
are well understood across all the organizational levels [5]. 
Realistic SPI goals lead to realistic expectations and 
aid in maintaining high motivation for and support of the 
SPI activities. Unrealistic, too ambitious or unreachable 
objectives, on the other hand, may jeopardize the SPI 
projects, by decreasing employees’ engagement and 
motivation even in projects with positive results [4], [21]. 
Our interviews have led to a similar conclusion. 
5) 
SPI method is well defined 
Software process improvement is a complex and time 
consuming process. Following a well defined and 
structured SPI implementation method strongly contributes 
to its success [7], [9], [25]. According to the literature 
studied, the SPI method should be suitable to the 
organization, its size and goals.  
6) 
SPI project is effectively managed 
Management of the SPI project involves a wide range 
of activities such as planning for change, identifying actors 
involved, ensuring the level of understanding the process 
changes, monitoring the status of SPI, evaluating the 
progress, and the like. It needs to be performed in an 
effective and professional manner [26]. According to the 
literature studied, without project management, the SPI 
project is doomed to fail or it may lead to chaos [6]. 
Our interviews have pointed out that effective 
management and execution of SPI are key elements of the 
successful SPI effort and its sustainable results. 
7) 
Process improvements are focused on specific 
areas  
At the beginning of the SPI projects, companies can be 
overwhelmed with the amount of suggestions for the 
improvements. Such being a case, as stated in the literature 

330
International Journal on Advances in Software, vol 5 no 3 & 4, year 2012, http://www.iariajournals.org/software/
2012, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
studied, it is important not to do too many changes at once. 
Instead, companies should focus on a few specific process 
areas and a few process improvement goals. They should 
also prioritize the SPI suggestions and implement only one 
or few improvements at a time [20], [21]. This leads to 
easier and more efficient implementation, control, 
measurement, and thereby, to more sustainable results of 
SPI efforts.  
Our interviews have led to the same conclusion. The 
interviewees added that process changes should be 
introduced in a slow manner and supported by training 
sessions. This can contribute to the understanding of the 
process undergoing change and of the impact of the 
process changes.  
8) 
Process improvement effort is flexible  
Software process should continuously change and 
adapt to the organizational needs and situation. SPI 
activities can be risky and may not always lead to the 
expected results. Therefore, according to our interviewees, 
process improvements should be flexible and allow for 
experimenting with the process. In cases when the process 
change is proven to be unsuccessful or unsuitable, the 
organization should be able to quickly rollback the process 
to the pre-change status.  
9) 
Information about SPI activities and its results is 
disseminated 
SPI projects bring many changes to the process and 
daily routines. These changes have to be communicated to 
all the stakeholders that can be directly or indirectly 
impacted by the changes. According to the literature 
studied, insufficient communication of the SPI changes 
may lead to lack of transparency of the SPI projects, 
confused personnel and poor quality process. Team 
collaboration and communication, on the other hand, may 
help the staff members to exchange knowledge and 
experience during the improvement projects and contribute 
to a more coherent organizational culture [6].  
The need for communicating on the SPI activities and 
their results has also been raised by our interviewees. 
According to them, sufficient communication positively 
impacts motivation in SPI and acceptance of the new 
process changes.   
10) Process standards are defined and enforced 
In some companies, the newly introduced process can 
just run by itself. Its main fuel is primarily high 
commitment and engagement of the technical staff. 
However, in companies that have low commitment 
towards or poor understanding of the development process, 
people are tempted to disregard the process standards, 
unless there is a strong control mechanism in place [34]. 
Even when properly trained, the staff may not follow the 
newly introduced process. Therefore, as stated in the 
literature studied, in order to guarantee that the process is 
dedicatedly followed by all the stakeholders, it should be 
enforced and controlled by the SPI managers [34]. 
Our interviews have led to a similar conclusion. The 
interviewees have also suggested that the employees that 
are not following the software process procedures correctly 
should be informed and consequently corrected. The 
interviewees also highlighted the importance of accessible 
and updated software process documentation. 
11) SPI effort brings positive results  
As mentioned before, the results of the SPI activities 
should be disseminated to all the stakeholders. However, 
as discovered during the interviews, just the dissemination 
of the SPI results is not enough. The results achieved by 
the early SPI effort should be positive and should speak for 
themselves.  
Early gains of SPI effort can encourage and motivate 
stakeholders to continue with the SPI activities and can 
change the opinions of those who did not support SPI from 
the very beginning.  
12) Software process is monitored and measured  
Continuous process monitoring and measurement 
indicates whether the SPI activities are effective or not, 
and allows to provide early feedback on the sustainability 
of the SPI efforts. Hence, as stated in the literature studied, 
it is important to evaluate and measure the process on a 
continuous basis in order to reinsure its purpose and to 
increase the engagement of the SPI supporters. Measured 
and acknowledged process improvement will positively 
affect team morale and motivation [7], [12], [13], [20].  
Our interviewees have also stated that measurement 
and evaluation of the SPI results can positively impact the 
engagement in and motivation for future SPI.  
13) Software 
process 
and 
its 
efficiency 
are 
continuously reviewed 
To achieve continuous process improvement, the SPI 
process and its efficiency should be reflected on and 
evaluated on a continuous basis. As stated in the literature 
studied, process reviews, such as retrospectives, allow 
learning from previous experience and from experimenting 
with the process, which, in turn, contributes to a self-
driven continuous process improvement, and thereby, to 
long lasting SPI results [12], [13].  
Our interviews have led to the same conclusion. 
According to our interviewees, process reviews help to 
identify problems in the current process and to 
acknowledge benefits achieved by SPI. This, in turn, 
significantly contributes to the sustainability of the 
achieved results. Without frequent reviews and changes to 
the process, gains of SPI will soon outdate. 
14) SPI effort is continuous  
Software organizations have dynamic and continuously 
changing structures. Organizational culture, availability of 
the customer and background of the employees are always 
changing. Hence, a static process that is not improving or 
adapting to the changing organizational needs is failed to 
decay [34]. Moreover, the results of the SPI efforts will be 
lost if the organization will stop improving its process.  
To sustain the gains of the process improvement 
efforts, the company should view the SPI as a continuous 
activity. According to the literature studied, continuous 
SPI effort cannot be achieved without mechanisms for 
continuous process review and tuning 
[34], and 
comprehensive support of those responsible for the process 
[6]. In addition, all the roles responsible for the SPI project 
should continuously reaffirm commitment to change, 
communicate progress of improvement, and provide 
continuous feedback and motivation [6].  
Our interviews have also confirmed that time and 
money should be continuously invested into the SPI effort 
in order to maintain its results.

D. Social Factors   
We 
have 
identified 
ten 
different 
social 
SPI 
sustainability success factors. Social factors deal with 
human behavior and reactions in the SPI context. As 
shown in Table IV, they are grouped into three clusters: 1) 
Understanding and awareness of SPI focusing on common 
understanding and awareness of the SPI, 2) Attitude to SPI 
targeting stakeholders’ attitude towards SPI, and 3) 
Facilitation of SPI listing factors that may increase 
stakeholders’ motivation in SPI. The social SPI success 
factors are the following:  
1) 
Stakeholders have a common understanding of the 
process undergoing change 
The process cannot be efficiently improved unless it is 
properly understood. According to the literature studied, 
the technical staff and management have to reach 
consensus on the status of the current process, its problems 
and possible solutions, as well as the organization’s vision 
and improvement goals [6]. Common understanding of the 
current and new process, suggested changes and its 
potential benefits are important to increase support for 
process improvement among all the stakeholders involved. 
Our empirical study has led to the same conclusion. 
According to our interviewees, all the stakeholders should 
understand the reasons behind process changes. An 
important stakeholder here is the technical staff who has to 
change the previous habits and adapt to a new way of 
working. Our interviewees have also pointed out that 
common understanding of the new process, of the SPI 
activities and their potential benefits strongly contribute to 
the increase of commitment and motivation towards SPI.  
2) 
Stakeholders are aware of complexity, challenges 
and benefits of SPI 
Since SPI requires continuous effort and often brings 
mainly long-term results, it is important that everybody 
involved in it is aware of its complexity, challenges and 
future benefits. Hence, according to the literature studied, 
organizations must make sure that all the stakeholders 
involved are aware of complexity and potential benefits of 
SPI. This can be realized via education, training and 
effective communication. Raising awareness of SPI and 
effective communication of its complexity, challenges and 
benefits strongly affects the success of the SPI projects [8-
10], [23-26].  
Our interviews have also shown that the stakeholders 
need to understand the reasons behind SPI and its potential 
benefits in order to accept and commit to the process 
change.  
3) 
Stakeholders have realistic expectations     
Our interviews have indicated that in order to be 
satisfied with SPI and its results, the employees affected by 
SPI should have realistic expectations. Otherwise, the 
stakeholders will get disappointed with SPI and will not 
continue with it, even though SPI brings positive results.   
4) 
Technical staff accepts SPI activities 
Changes to the process may affect daily work of many 
employees. Therefore, according to the literature studied, it 
is important that all the members of the technical staff 
agree and accept future process changes [18], [27]. This 
can substantially decrease inertia to change. Acceptance of 
process changes can be encouraged by high involvement 
of the technical staff in the SPI activities.  
Our interviews have also led to the same success 
factor. According to our interviewees, if all the personnel 
accept the newly changed process, then there is a greater 
opportunity that the changed process will be sustained. 
Mutual acceptance of the changed process and SPI 
activities is a key to sustain the results achieved by the SPI. 
5) 
Technical staff is committed to the SPI process  
Acceptance of SPI activities is a critical success factor 
when starting SPI projects. According to the literature 
studied,  however,  it  needs  to  be  complemented with the

commitment of the technical staff. Commitment to the SPI 
projects is inevitably another significant success factor to 
sustain the results of the SPI projects.  
Management commitment to SPI projects has already 
been listed as a significant SPI success factor. However, 
commitment of technical staff is just as important [21-24], 
[28]. Together with the increased motivation and 
engagement, the commitment of the technical staff can 
become a driving wheel of process improvement [3]. 
Committed staff takes on the responsibility and ownership 
of the process and keeps process in a healthy state [3].  
Commitment of the technical staff has also been 
educed during our interviews. Our interviewees have stated 
that if the company personnel does not commit to the 
process changes, it will most likely go back to the pre-SPI 
process state. 
6) 
Stakeholders are being encouraged to support SPI  
Commitment to and support of SPI by all the 
stakeholders is a great asset to help successful SPI 
implementation and to decrease inertia towards change. 
However, it is not easy to reach everybody’s support of 
SPI. Therefore, our interviewees suggested that during the 
early stages of the SPI project, the management should 
start encouraging the stakeholders towards supporting SPI. 
Encouraging the technical staff in SPI from the very 
beginning would increase support, motivation and 
engagement in future SPI activities.   
7) 
Technical staff is rewarded for contribution to SPI 
success  
Moral 
appreciation 
and 
financial 
rewarding 
acknowledge individual contributions to SPI. Recognized 
contribution engages and motivates people to continue 
with the SPI effort [7], [34]. The technical staff should also 
be rewarded for showing interest in and for contributing to 
the process improvement activities.  
According to our interviews, the organization should 
celebrate each SPI success and reward personnel for their 
contributions. This will increase overall motivation and 
commitment to SPI.  
8) 
SPI leaders encourage initiative and openness of 
stakeholders  
To be able to suggest future process improvements, the 
weaknesses and problems of the current process need to be 
continuously identified. Some of those weaknesses and 
problems can relate to specific individuals and fulfillment 
of their responsibilities. Therefore, it is important to focus 
on identifying the process weaknesses and not on playing 
blame games [19], which can only lead to frustration and 
inertia towards process change [11], [19]. 
According to the literature studied, SPI leaders should 
focus on process weaknesses and problems and should 
encourage initiative, innovation, creativity and openness in 
stakeholders involved. Without it, employees cannot share 
valuable ideas, and thereby, contribute to process 
improvement [11]. Few of our interviewees were of the 
same opinion.  
9) 
Technical staff participates in SPI  
Technical staff constitutes an important process 
knowledge and experience asset [6]. By knowing all the 
nooks and crannies of the process, the staff may provide 
useful feedback on the suggested SPI changes [27]. For 
this reason, it is important that they are involved in 
identifying process pains and in suggesting solutions for 
them [6], [8], [9], [12], [13], [18], [25].  
The literature findings show that the involvement and 
participation of the technical staff reduce resistance to 
change, and thereby, strongly impact the SPI success [6], 
[18], [21]. By being involved in the SPI activities, the 
technical staff members feel more motivated to adhere to 
the process changes, and therefore, they are more likely to 
accept them [6], [18]. If, on the other hand, they are not 
convinced, then the process improvement projects will 
have 
small 
chances 
to 
succeed. 
Technical 
staff 
involvement was found especially important in immature 
organizations [25].  
Many of our interviewers have also mentioned that the 
involvement of the technical staff contributes to the 
alignment of SPI methods to the organizational needs. It 
also decreases inertia towards change and increases 
motivation, and thereby, it significantly affects the 
sustainability of the SPI efforts. 
10) Technical staff owns the software process  
Disregarding the reasons behind the SPI projects, the 
new process has to be accepted and followed by the team. 
According to the literature studied, it is important that not 
only external and internal SPI leaders but also all the 
technical staff members take on the ownership of the 
process to be improved. The members should take the 
responsibility for tailoring the process and for continuously 
improving it. It is only in this way they will feel more 
affiliated with the process and more responsible for future 
process improvement. This, in turn, will lead to a built-in, 
self-driven continuous process improvement process, 
which, in turn, will strongly contribute to the sustainability 
of the SPI results [7].  
Our interviewees have also stated that the success of 
the SPI projects is strongly related to software process 
ownership. According to them, not only management and 
SPI leaders should own the process, but also all the 
technical staff members. They should be responsible for 
the software process and its changes. 
V. FINAL REMARKS  
In this paper, we have presented thirty three success 
factors influencing the sustainability of SPI efforts. The 
factors are grouped into three categories: organizational 
factors, implementation factors and social factors. They 
were elicited in two independently conducted studies, the 
literature study and empirical study. The early results of 
this study were previously published in [1].  
More than 70% of the identified SPI sustainability 
factors (24 out of 33) were commonly identified both via 
literature and empirical studies, even though they were 
conducted independently. Out of twenty seven success 
factors identified in the literature, only four were not 
mentioned by our interviewees. This represents a general 
approval of the SPI success factors identified in the 
literature, since the interviewees were not influenced by 
the results of the literature study. The factors that were not 
confirmed 
by 
the 
interviewees 
concerned 
two 
organizational factors dealing with the alignment of SPI 
with business goals and organizational policies and 
strategies (see Section IV.B.7 SPI is aligned with business 
goals, 
and Section IV.B.8 SPI is aligned with 
organizational 
policies 
and 
strategies) 
and 
one

implementation factor dealing with the definition of the 
SPI method (see Section IV.C.5 SPI method is well 
defined). The reason to why those factors were not 
mentioned by our interviewees could be that they 
concerned management and business level of the SPI 
project that was more common to larger organizations and 
less applicable for medium-sized organizations to which 
all our interviewees belonged to.   
During the interviews, we have identified thirty SPI 
success factors, from which only six were not previously 
reported in the literature. Those factors concerned one 
organizational factor dealing with technical staff turnover 
(see Section IV.B.6 The level of technical staff turnover is 
low), three implementation factors dealing with process 
improvement and process standards (see Sections IV.C.8 
Process improvement effort is flexible, Section IV.C.10 
Process standards are defined and enforced, and Section 
IV.C.11 SPI effort brings positive results, and finally, two 
social factors dealing with the stakeholders’ expectations 
from and encouragement towards SPI (see Section IV.D.3 
Stakeholders have realistic expectations, and Section 
IV.D.6 Stakeholders are being encouraged to support SPI. 
Those factors represent lessons learned from SPI 
adaptation in the interviewed companies. Therefore, they 
may be context dependent and not necessarily applicable to 
other software organizations. Nevertheless, they clearly 
contribute to the SPI success and sustainability as stated in 
Section IV. 
Despite the high overlap of the identified factors, the 
focus on the factors differed greatly among the sources 
used in this study. The literature sources mainly focused on 
conditions enabling the SPI efforts. The SPI factors that 
were recognized by the majority of the literature sources 
dealt with continuous management commitment and 
support, provision of resources and involvement of the 
technical staff in SPI (see Section IV.B.1 Management 
continuously supports and commits to SPI process, Section 
IV.B.2  Resources are dedicated to SPI, and Section 
IV.D.9 Technical staff participates in SPI). Those factors 
have the most devastating impact on the SPI project. 
Without them, the SPI project should not even be initiated. 
Their importance and influence were also confirmed 
during the interviews.  
The factors that were mentioned by most of the 
interviewees focused on the social factors and the effects 
of SPI on the daily routines. Their concern mainly dealt 
with down to earth issues such as training in software 
process undergoing improvement, availability of the 
information on the SPI activities and results, and 
acceptance of the SPI activities by the technical staff (see 
Section IV.C.1 Stakeholders are trained in software 
process, Section IV.C.9 Information about the SPI 
activities and its results is disseminated, and Section 
IV.D.4 Technical staff accepts SPI activities). This may be 
explained with the fact that the majority of our 
interviewees have taken part in the SPI projects but they 
did not lead them. Therefore, our interviewees represented 
the developers’ view from the perspective of how SPI 
affects their way of working and their daily routines. 
The SPI sustainability success factors presented in this 
paper constitute the body of knowledge of the software 
engineering community as educed in the current software 
engineering literature and in the industry. Even if they 
have only been listed and described, they may already 
constitute a basis for providing insight into SPI efforts, for 
diagnosing the reasons of SPI decay or for confirming the 
prerequisites that are necessary for carrying out SPI.  
We strongly believe that it is not enough to just define 
SPI process frameworks and/or models. The process 
frameworks/models should be supported by tools for 
evaluating the status of the SPI projects and identifying its 
faults. For this reason, we plan to continue working with 
the SPI sustainability success factors presented in this 
paper. Our goal is to create a basis for supplementing 
currently defined SPI frameworks and/or models with a 
checklist for SPI effort evaluation.
