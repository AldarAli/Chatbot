Abstract—Thin film hydrogen peroxide vapours sensors made 
from ZnO<La> and SnO2<Co> were manufactured by the 
high-frequency magnetron sputtering method. Response of the 
prepared sensors was investigated at different concentrations 
of hydrogen peroxide vapours and temperatures of the sensor 
work body. It was found that the La-doped ZnO sensors 
exhibit a sufficient response at 10 ppm of hydrogen peroxide 
vapours at the operating temperature of 220 °C. Good 
response to 100 ppm of hydrogen peroxide vapours at the work 
body temperature of 150 °C was shown for Co-doped SnO2 
sensors.

INTRODUCTION  
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is used in such fields as 
medicine, pharmacology, food and textile industry due to a 
wide spectrum of its antibacterial properties, low toxicity, 
ecological purity (the residue of H2O2 decompose on neutral 
water and oxygen). However, insufficiently pure H2O2 in 
large concentrations under certain conditions (for example, 
in the presence of transition metals) can decompose fast and 
can be explosive. H2O2 is subsumed under the category of 
matters dangerous for man with certain maximum 
permissible concentration. Therefore, the correct selection 
of the H2O2 concentration during the sterilization of 
equipment technological surfaces and also control of the 
H2O2 content in the air after completion of disinfection cycle 
are very important. From this point of view, development 
and manufacturing of systems sensitive to H2O2, able to 
determine its concentration in the environment is a very 
actual problem and attracts interest of chemists, physicians, 
industrial engineers, etc. 
Now the electrochemical sensors are wide used [1]-[3]. 
However, note that the process of chemical decontamination 
can be carried out in two different ways: the first is the wet 
approach using water or any other H2O2 solution and the 
second one is the dry method using H2O2 in vapour phase. 
Therefore, the development and manufacturing of stable and 
reproducible sensors sensitive to H2O2 vapours are required. 
An H2O2 vapours phase checking is also crucially 
significant in connection with counterterrorism efforts. An 
amperometric sensor for detection of H2O2 vapours made of 
an agarose-coated Prussian-blue was investigated [4]. A 
single-wire 
optical 
sensor 
for 
H2O2 
vapours 
was 
manufactured [5]. The chemiresistive films made of organic 
p-type semiconductors metalized phthalocyanines (MPcs, 
where M = p-, d-, and f-block elements) are also sensitive to 
H2O2 vapours [6]. 
The aim of the present paper is a development of the 
technology, manufacturing and investigation of solid-state 
H2O2 
vapours 
sensors 
made 
from 
nanostructured 
semiconductor metal oxide films. 
In Section I, the necessities in the development of the 
H2O2 sensors and, in particular, sensors sensitive to H2O2 
vapours are briefly described. In Section II, the manufacture 
technology of sensors made from semiconductor doped with 
metal oxide ZnO<La> and SnO2<Co> nanostructures is 
described. The results of investigations of its sensitivity to 
H2O2 vapours are presented. In Section III, the conclusions 
are made and the directions of the future work are described.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
Ceramic targets made from ZnO doped with 1at.% La 
and SnO2 doped with 2at.% Co were synthesized by the 
method of solid-phase reaction in air. The annealing was 
carried out at 1300 °C and 500 °C-1100 °C for the 
compacted 
samples 
of 
ZnO<La> 
and 
SnO2<Co>, 
respectively. 
Prepared semiconductor ZnO<La> and SnO2<Co> 
targets with a diameter ~ 40 mm and thickness ~ 2 mm were 
used for deposition of nanosize films using the high-
frequency magnetron sputtering method. Multi-Sensor-
Platforms (purchased from TESLA BLATNÁ, Czech 
Republic) are used as substrates. The power of the 
magnetron generator unit was 60 W. Duration of the 
sputtering process was equal to 15 and 20 minutes for 
ZnO<La> and SnO2<Co>, respectively. The sensing device 
was completed through the ion-beam sputtering deposition 
of palladium catalytic particles (the deposition time ~ 3 
seconds). Further annealing of the manufactured structures

in air was carried out at temperature 250 °C to obtain film 
homogeneity and eliminate mechanical stress. 
The sensors manufactured by us are resistive, i.e., its 
operation is grounded on changes of resistance of gas 
sensitive semiconductor layer under the influence of H2O2 
vapours caused by an exchange of charges between 
molecules of the semiconductor film and absorbed H2O2 
vapours. 
Response of prepared sensors made from doped metal 
oxide films under the influence of H2O2 vapours was 
measured using a home-made system [4]. Samples were 
placed in a hermetic chamber. A corresponding quantity of 
the H2O2 water solution with certain concentration was 
placed in the chamber to reach a required concentration of 
H2O2 vapours. Measurements of the manufactured sensors 
response were carried out at different concentrations of 
H2O2 vapours (from 10 ppm up to 4000 ppm). A platinum 
heater on a front side of the sensor ensures a necessary 
temperature of the work body. The sensor work body 
temperature was being varied from room temperature up to 
350 °C. 
The sensor resistance variance under the H2O2 vapours 
influence was measured using a special home-made 
computer program. A typical curve demonstrating changing 
of the sensor resistance under the influence of H2O2 vapours 
at invariable temperature of the work body is presented in 
Figure 1. 
Figure 1. Resistance variation of the ZnO<La> sensor under the influence 
1800 ppm of H2O2 vapours, work body temperature of 350 °C. 
As a result of such measurements, the sensor response 
was determined as the ratio Rvapors/Rair, where Rvapors is the 
sensor resistance in the presence of H2O2 vapours in air and 
Rair is the sensor resistance in air without H2O2 vapours. The 
SnO2<Co> sensor response to 100 ppm of H2O2 vapours at 
the work body temperature of 150 °C and 200 °C is 
presented in Figure 2. The temperature of the sensor work 
body remains constant during of the each measurement. 
Investigations of the ZnO<La> sensors sensitivity to 10 
ppm of H2O2 vapours were carried out at University of 
Chemistry and Technology (Prague). Firstly, an atmosphere 
containing 10 ppm of H2O2 vapours was prepared in a 
laboratory model of an isolator. This H2O2 vapours 
concentration decreased by spontaneous decomposition of 
H2O2. When a reference device (DrägerSensor® H2O2 HC) 
could not detect any H2O2 vapours, the sensor was inserted 
into the model isolator. Then, the sensor responded 
immediately. When the maximum response was reached, the 
sensor was taken out into an atmosphere without any traces 
of H2O2 vapours. This process was repeated three times. 
Results of these measurements are presented in Figure 3. 
Figure 2. The SnO2<Co> sensor response to 100 ppm of H2O2 vapours at 
different work body temperatures. 
Figure 3. ZnO<La> sensors response to 10 ppm of H2O2 vapours. 
Note that the DrägerSensor® H2O2 HC reference device 
is not sensitive to 10 ppm of H2O2 vapours. The ZnO<La> 
sensors were sufficiently sensitive to 10 ppm of H2O2 
vapours at the work body temperature of 220°C, i.e. the 
sensors manufactured by us allow detection of H2O2 vapours 
concentrations which are not exceeding the maximum 
permissible value. 
III. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  
The technology for semiconductor nanostructure sensors 
made from ZnO doped with 1at.% La and SnO2 doped with 
2at.% Co was developed. Specimen detecting H2O2 vapours 
were manufactured and investigated. Sensors made from 
ZnO<La> were sensitive to 10 ppm of H2O2 vapours. 
Sensors made from SnO2<Co> exhibited good response to 
100 ppm of H2O2 vapours at the operating temperature 
starting at 100°C. Our future work will be directed on the 
long-time stabilization of sensors parameters and the
