Abstract—There are tasks that the multiple agent system
approach is very appropriate for improving performance.
Among them are: environment exploration, mineral mining,
mine sweeping, surveillance, and rescue operations. The ex-
pected advantage is not a mere consequence of putting together
many agents. An efﬁcient coordination strategy is decisive
to reach performance improvements. In the present paper, a
new strategy is proposed for coordination of multiple robot
systems applied to exploration and surveillance tasks. The
coordination strategy is distributed and on-line. It is inspired
in biological mechanisms that deﬁne the social organization of
swarm systems; speciﬁcally, it is based on a modiﬁed version
of usual artiﬁcial ant systems. Two versions of the proposal
are evaluated. The experiments consider two performance
criteria: the average of the numbers of surveillance epochs
and average of the surveillance time intervals. Simulation
results conﬁrm that exploration and surveillance emerge from
a synergy of individual robot behaviors. Data analyses show
the coordination strategy is effective and suitable to execute
exploration and surveillance tasks.
Keywords-multiple robot system; surveillance task; coordina-
tion strategy; ant colony system; swarm systems.
I. INTRODUCTION
A multiple agent system is well characterized if its
dynamics reﬂect some synergy, that is, global behaviors
emerge from the individual ones improving capabilities and
performance to reach a speciﬁc goal. If only one agent
of a group achieves equally the same goal with the same
performance the entire group does, then at ﬁrst,the group
of agents are not a multiple agent system. Regarding as
multiple robots system, this present paper is an extension
of approach proposed in [1], where a robots team is able
to monitor an environment independently of adopted con-
ﬁguration. In the other words, the way by which walls (or
obstacles) are placed in an environment does not limit the
accomplishment of exploration and surveillance tasks.
There are many applications to which multiple agent
systems are the suitable approach to be adopted, such as:
rescue operations in catastrophic events; ﬁre extinction; and
exploration in hostile environment [2][3][4]. Some of the
main reasons that justify this choice, among others, are: great
dimension of the task and reduced resources (e.g., velocity,
strength, energy) provided for a single agent; necessity
to adaptation to spatial or temporal variation of service
demands and robustness. For some tasks this approach is
mandatory; for others it is a matter of convenience to
increase the quality, to improve the performance or to save
monetary funds.
Nowadays, the technology reaches more sophisticated lev-
els providing environment support and embedded supplies.
These improvements bring closer the possibility of multiple
agent systems to become usual. The strong expectation
associated to this possibility captivates the attention of
the scientiﬁc community. Different aspects are investigated
in multiple agent systems, such as: agent communication
and information merging [5][6][7][8]. Another important
aspect is the agent coordination that allows the system
accomplishes efﬁciently general tasks such as: exploration,
coverage, surveillance, among others.
On the one hand, coordination strategies are designed to
provide multiple agent systems with a set of characteristics,
e.g., decentralized coordination, small redundancy of agent
efforts and strong cooperative behavior. On the other hand,
designers devote effort to propose coordination strategies
that are dependent on the least number of parameters as pos-
sible. A tricky parameter is the number of agents. Another
requirement that may depreciate the strategy is the need to
have total knowledge of the environment.
According to a technique described in [9] robots construct
a common map cooperatively. It is introduced the notion of
a frontier, which is a boundary between the explored and
unexplored areas. As robots move, new boundaries are de-
tected and frontiers are grouped in regions. Then, the robots
navigate toward the centroid of the closest region, while
sharing maps. The strategy is a centralized type since A∗
algorithm considers all information that the robots provide
and the algorithm output deﬁnes the next steering direction
of each robot. The strategy does not avoid unnecessary
redundancy of robot efforts.
The problem of surveillance using multiple agents is
investigated as a problem of a cooperative patrolling in [10].
A mathematical formulation is proposed as a minimization

problem. The objective to minimize the refresh time, that
is, the time necessary for the agents patrol completely the
environment. The solution they ﬁnd is an approximation
algorithm of polynomial computational cost based on a
topological graph representation and a path-covering pro-
cedure. The strategy depends totally on the knowledge of
the environment.
Methods based on stimergy ﬁelds for cooperation have
been recently employed in the context of robotic explo-
ration [11][12][13]. They rely on a mechanism of indirect
communication among the agents which allows their actions
to be inﬂuenced by a trace left previously in the environment
by the robot. In this way, a task can be accomplished
in an efﬁcient manner. A different coordination scheme
in [14] is proposed based on potential ﬁelds in which
repulsive forces repel robots from each other and obstacles.
Starting navigation from the same region, the robots keep
moving until repulsive forces cancel each other. At this
moment the sensor network is settled and robots stop. This
approach ensures the coverage task if the number of robots
is sufﬁciently great. Unfortunately, the authors do not show
how to ﬁnd the minimum number of robots. Therefore there
always exists a possibility that the strategy fails.
Coverage tasks are the focus of the investigation in [15].
The distributed coordination strategy, based on the Voronoi
diagram and Delaunay triangulation, is proposed to maxi-
mize the connected coverage area. The strategy is robust to
robot failures. Voronoi diagram is also adopted to solve the
connected coverage problem in [16]. Despite these strategies
solve a connected coverage problem, both do not sense
completely the environment, that is, not all parts of the
environment are visited by any robot.
The problem of coordination of multiple agents is consid-
ered complex [17][6]. Coordination strategies based solely
on mathematical formulation and on agent and environment
models are very parameter dependent and suffer critical
degradation due to agent failure [18][15][16]. Furthermore,
the problem of coordination of multiple robots that execute a
surveillance task is proved to be NP-hard [10]. Bio-inspired
theories provide fundamentals to design alternative strategies
that overcome the main difﬁculties that become traditional
strategies vain [19][20].
Particularly, the artiﬁcial analog versions of biological
mechanisms that deﬁne the social organization dynamics,
observed in some swarm systems, are very appropriate in ap-
plications involving multiple agents, for example, decentral-
ized control, communication and coordination [21][22][23].
In our previous works, some initial ideas about con-
struction of a new bioinspired based model for a control
strategy of multiple robots were proposed in [24]. It is
named Inverse Ant System-Based Surveillance System (IAS-
SS). In a preliminary model of IAS-SS, it was considered
distinct steering direction mechanisms and the feature of
robustness in regarding the number of robots adopted. As an
extension, in [1] was shown that the system does not depend
on knowledge of the environment, where the agents act in
environments with different conﬁgurations (arrangement of
obstacles). In order to prove the efﬁciency of communication
way among the agents rather than that adopted by biological
agents, a parametric analysis was performed in [25], using
various stigmergy mechanisms.
In the present work, an enhancement of IAS-SS strategy is
proposed through a more complete description. It is designed
according to a modiﬁed version of the ant system algorithm
presented in [26]. In this strategy, the agents were able to
indirect communication as the biological agents are, but their
reaction to the pheromone is distinct, steering directions
are deﬁned to guide preferably the robot to where there is
low quantity of pheromone. IAS-SS strategy is primarily for
the coordination of multiple robots applied to surveillance
and exploration tasks. Some characteristics of IAS-SS are:
decentralized, on-line, and parameter independent from both
the number of robots and the environment structure. Two
versions of the strategy IAS-SS are compared with a total
random strategy. Different experiments are considered, each
of which varying a speciﬁc parameter: number of robots, the
environment scale, and initial position. Results show that ex-
ploration and surveillance tasks are effectively executed and
the respective general behaviors emerge from the individual
robot behavior (move to where there is less pheromone).
Since the task of modeling all possible events, accurately,
in real world through mathematical models is not trivial,
the main contribution of this paper is a simple coordination
strategy based on a modiﬁed version of the traditional ant
system, that is, the robots are attracted to the region of the
environment with low amount of pheromone. The behavior
of explorationt and surveillance are generated only by the
information supplied by the deposited pheromone with few
parameters to be adjusted. It is necessary neither robot’s
position nor their local map environment. It is worth to be
emphasized the way in which the robots deposit pheromone.
This substance is left in the frontal area of robots, instead of
the positions occupied that generate a pheromone trail. These
characteristics are not found in other approaches existing in
the literature.
This paper is organized such as it follows. In Section II
is presented the basic concepts of the artiﬁcial ant system
theory. In Section III, the mathematical formulation of
the surveillance problem is presented. The multiple robot
system and the coordination strategy IAS-SS are focused
in Section IV. The pheromone evaporation dynamics, the
mechanisms of pheromone releasing, and the procedure
to determine the robot steering direction are also deﬁned.
In Section V simulation results are reported. The main
contributions and relevant aspects of this paper as well as
expectations for future works are highlighted in Section VI.

II. ANT SYSTEM
Surprisingly, the complex tasks that ant colonies perform,
such as object transportation and build edges, demand rela-
tively more capabilities that a single ant is endowed [27][28].
Biological ants have two known mechanisms to estab-
lish communication, namely, direct and indirect. Biological
ants not only exchange stimuli when they meet; but also
exchange stimuli indirectly (a communication mechanism
called stimergy). Ants deposit a speciﬁc type of substance
(pheromone) on the ground while they move. There are
different types of pheromone, each of which associated with
a particular meaning. If a pheromone trail is found and this
pheromone type indicates food, then more and more ants
follow this trail, depositing more pheromone and reinforcing
the stimuli. An opposite behavior happens if the pheromone
is of the aversive type, indicating risk and danger. Stimergy
mechanism is considered as one of the factors that decisively
contribute to amplify the capabilities of a single ant. Ant
colonies use the stimergy mechanism to coordinate their
activities in a distributed way [29].
Artiﬁcial ant systems are the artiﬁcial counterparts of the
biological ant colonies, designed to solve complex problems,
among others: optimization combinatorial problems [26].
Analogously artiﬁcial ants (e.g., robots) are able to use the
stimergic communication. Pheromone trail provides a type of
distributed information that artiﬁcial agents may use to take
decisions or modify to express previous experiences [30].
A distributed coordination behavior emerges from this ca-
pability, providing solutions to problems associated with
exploration in hyper-spaces.
III. DEFINITIONS AND PRELIMINARY CONCEPTS
There are different mathematical formulation in the lit-
erature. For example, in [10] the concept of viewpoint is
deﬁned. Viewpoints are speciﬁc points in the environment
such that from those points it is possible to sense the whole
environment. Then the robots have to go to them repeatedly
in order to keep the environment sensed completely. The
optimal surveillance task is deﬁned as the minimization of
the largest interval between two consecutive instants that
any robot reaches a particular viewpoint, considering all
viewpoints and during all time the task lasts.
Informally, the surveillance task means the task of keeping
endlessly a target under closed observation. In this paper, the
target is an environment. It is not necessary to keep all points
of the environment under observation at the same time, but
every point has to be observed repeatedly while the task
lasts. If a set of agents are considered to carry out the task,
the agents have to follow trajectories that allow them to sense
all parts of the environment again and again. Clearly, it is
not necessary that each agent goes to every point, but every
point has to be observed by at least one agent (anyone)
repeatedly. Then, the execution of the surveillance task is
considered effective if the environment is completely and
continually sensed. Moreover, the smaller is the maximum
interval between two consecutive sensing, considering any
particular point of the environment, the more efﬁcient is the
execution of the surveillance task.
Two terms used in this work help the readers to under-
stand how the surveillance task is evaluated in this work:
Surveillance Epoch (SE) and Surveillance Interval (SI). A
surveillance interval is any interval of time in which all
points of the environment are sensed at least once; and
at least one point is sensed exactly once. This interval
corresponds to a portion of the surveillance task and this
portion is called surveillance epoch. If the surveillance
intervals are considered from the start of the task, the SI’s
are uniquely determined. Starting from T ∗
0 , the agents start
to move through the environment, sensing the environment.
After a time, precisely at time T ∗
1 , all points are sensed at
least once; and at least one point is sensed exactly once. The
interval between T ∗
0 and T ∗
1 is the ﬁrst SI. The second SI
begins at T ∗
1 . It is important to notice that at T ∗
1 no point is
considered sensed anymore, that is, a new reckoning starts
at T ∗
1 to indicate the sensed points. The agents keep moving
continuously. At T ∗
2 all points are sensed at least once; and
at least one point is sensed exactly once (considering a new
reckoning starts for the second SI). The interval between
T ∗
1 and T ∗
2 is the second SI. All other SI’s are deﬁned
analogously. The surveillance task is evaluated measuring
the maximum length of the intervals SI.
In order to put the meaning of the surveillance task more
rigorous the respective mathematical model is built next.
Consider that robots rk, k = 1, . . . , N move in a planar
space Q ⊂ R2 and that an arbitrary point in Q is denoted by
q. Assume that the time t is discrete. Let Lk
t , Lk
t ⊂ Q, be
the area that the rk-th robot senses at instant t. Hence, the
rk-th robot senses a point q at instant t, if q ∈ Lk
t . Deﬁne
a function Ik(., .) to associate a point q with the respective
state considering the rk-th robot, that is, q ∈ Lk
t if and only
if Ik(q, t) = 1. Deﬁne also a function Ωi(., .) to associate a
point q with the number of times it is sensed from T ∗
i−1 up
to t, considering all robots rk, that is:
Ωi(q, t) =

where: T ∗
i and T ∗
i−1 are the limits of the i − th surveillance
interval; C ≥ 0 is number of completed SE and T F denotes
the time when the surveillance task ends.
It is important for the reader to notice that the problem
deﬁned earlier in equation 2 is not solved here exactly, but
only in an approximated way. This is almost a rule since this
problem is known to be very complex, when the number of
robot is big. This is the case in this paper. Multiple identical
mobile robots are considered to carry out the surveillance
task. Every robot is equipped with a set of sensor devices
that allow the robots observe the environment. According
to [10] the surveillance task problem such as described there
is a NP-hard problem.
One among the aspects of the surveillance task problem
considered in this paper is that the environment is unknown.
By focusing on this aspect, it is important to notice that the
exploration task may be regard as part of the surveillance
task, since the environment is completely explored at the
end of the ﬁrst surveillance epoch. At this time all points
of the environment are sensed, that is, there is no point
remains to be found. Then, in what follows the focus is
on the surveillance task and the exploration task is a mere
consequence.
IV. INVERSE ANT SYSTEM-BASED SURVEILLANCE
SYSTEM (IAS-SS)
The multiple agent system approach is adopted to solve
the surveillance task problem such as described in the former
section. The agents are multiple identical mobile robots each
of which equipped with a sensor for detecting a particular
characteristic of the environment.
At ﬁrst glance, this approach seems attractive, that is,
a plausible conclusion is: multiple robots execute more
efﬁciently the surveillance task than a single one. However
this conclusion is true if, at least, there is a capable strategy
to coordinate suitably the robots. It means that the strategy
has to generate trajectories for every robot, leading them
repeatedly to all parts of the environment, satisfying some
performance criteria, e.g., minimization of the interval be-
tween two consecutive instants a point in the environment
is sensed, considering all points.
Putting together: performance requirements, solution re-
strictions, and strategy characteristics; makes the design
work a hard task (such as asserted in [10], see comments in
the previous section).
The system proposed, called Inverse Ant System-Based
Surveillance System (IAS-SS), is designed according to the
main ideas of the artiﬁcial ant system. In short, the IAS-SS
system is a multiple robot system. The robot’s cybernetic
system consists of two components: the navigation controller
and the pheromone disperser. The pheromone disperser is
one of the components of the robot’s cybernetic system,
since it is related to the robot’s indirect communication
system. The Figure 1 represents the components of the
cybernetic system and the respective connections with other
elements of the system, including the environment.
Figure 1.
Cybernetic system architectural diagram for a single robot.
The strategy, called IAS-SS strategy , is for coordination
of the IAS-SS system’s robots applied to surveillance tasks.
The coordination strategy is a distributed one, that is, every
robot moves independently and takes decisions based on
the stimuli it receives from the environment. The IAS-SS
coordination strategy is a reactive (real-time) strategy, does
not generate decision dead-locks, and is computational low-
cost.
The IAS-SS coordination strategy is based on the indirect
communication mechanism (stigmergy) the biological ant
colonies exhibit. The IAS-SS coordination strategy generates
the following general system dynamics. While the robots
navigate they deposit a speciﬁc substance into the envi-
ronment. This substance is called pheromone, since it is
the analogue of the pheromone in biological ant colonies.
At each time the robot sensor detects the stimuli from
the environment corresponding to the total amount of the
pheromone deposited on the area deﬁned by the sensor
range. The amount of pheromone detected is the accu-
mulated pheromone deposited on that area considering all
robots. After that the robot adjusts its navigation direction,
deposits the pheromone and moves.
The IAS-SS strategy is completely described in the next
subsections. Among other elements described, are: the navi-
gation system and the steering direction mechanisms; and
pheromone disperser. All other elements of the IAS-SS
system will be considered as well. In the end, all of them
will be described in detail.
A. Navigation System
According to the IAS-SS coordination strategy, the robot
navigation system consists of two subsystems: surveillance

150

system and obstacle avoidance system. Only one is active
at each time. Most part of the time the surveillance system
is active and the steering direction is determined according
to it. The trajectories the surveillance navigation system
generates cause the robots execute the surveillance task.
The trajectories do not lead robots to collision situations as
well, with rare exceptions. In order to avoid completely any
possible collision situation, the obstacle avoidance system is
active only if the robot is very close to a wall or an other
robot.
Although the obstacle avoidance system is not the main
concern in this paper, it is brieﬂy described. As long as
robots are close to an obstacle, the amount of pheromone in
its boundary region is increased. Then, the robots generate
the obstacle avoidance behavior due to the high amount of
pheromone. Therefore, obstacle avoidance is an emergent
behavior of the IAS-SS strategy. The trajectories generated
by the strategy does not guide the robots to a collision
situation. Besides the exploration and surveillance tasks, the
robots are able to avoid obstacles, keeping a reasonable
distance from them.
However, there are some exceptions when a robot col-
lides against another robot or against an obstacle according
to its physical characteristics. In this sense, it is used a
mechanism for obstacle avoidance based on fuzzy logic [31]
that adjusts the steering direction of the robot using the
information about its distance to an obstacle. The details of
the mechanism based on fuzzy logic can be found in [32].
It is enough to say that this mechanism is active only when
the distance between the robot and an obstacle is smaller
than a predeﬁned constant η.
The general description of steering direction mechanism
the surveillance navigation system implements is such as
follows. At each time a set of stimuli is detected, correspond-
ing to the amount of the pheromone deposited at different
angles and same speciﬁc distance (at the range border) in
front of the robot. The lesser is the detected amount of the
pheromone detected the greater is the probability that the
robot takes the navigation direction equal to the angle where
this amount of pheromone is.
According to this strategy robots tend to move to the
directions where there is low amount of pheromone. The
general robot behavior observed is that the robot moves to
unexplored areas or areas robots seldom visit.
Considering the IAS-SS coordination, the logic associated
with the decision that chooses the steering direction angle is
opposite of that adopted in the traditional ant system theory.
The logic adopted there generates a positive feedback, that
is, the greater is the amount of the pheromone the greater is
the probability of the agent to follow the respective direction.
Two versions of the steering angle mechanism are de-
scribed. The ﬁrst one, called Stochastic Sampling, considers
all possible pheromone stimuli that the sensor detects at
the border of its range. The second, called Best Ranked
Stochastic Sampling, determines the adjusting of steering
angle based on a select set of stimuli detected at the border
of the sensor range.
The mathematical models for these two versions of the
steering angle mechanism are described as it follows. Before
that, consider two assumptions. First, there are N identical
mobile robots rk, k = 1, . . . , N. Second, the model of the
sensor adopted is such that it detects pheromone stimuli
at the border of its range (Figure 2). The border is a
circumference of a circle of radius R, ahead of the robot,
from 90 degrees to the left to 90 degrees to the right of
the steering direction. The total range of 180 degrees is
divided in identical angle intervals each of which measuring
α degrees. The middles of the intervals are settled on angles
As, such that: (2S + 1)α = 180 and As = sα, where
s ∈ [−S, S] and s ∈ N.
Figure 2.
Robot and sensor models
1) Stochastic Sampling Mechanism: A pheromone stim-
ulus corresponds to the amount of pheromone deposited
in an angle interval. A probability value assigned to each
discrete angle As is inversely proportional to the amount
of pheromone deposited in the angle interval that is settled
on the angle As. The lower is the amount of pheromone
detected in the angle interval, the higher is the probability
associated with the respective angle As. Speciﬁcally, the
probability P(s) assigned to the angle As is:
P(s) =
1 − τs
SP
i=−S
(1 − τi)
(3)
where τs is the amount of pheromone corresponding to the
angle interval As.
The adjustment of the steering direction is determined
according to a discrete random variable a deﬁned through
the probability P(s), assuming values in the set {As | s =
−S, . . . , −1, 0, 1, . . . , S}.
At each time t, the adjustment of steering direction is
given by:
Θk(t) = Θk(t − 1) + γA∗
s
(4)

where: Θk(t) is the steering angle of the robot k at instant
t, γ ∈ [0, 1] is the constant coefﬁcient for smoothing the
steering direction adjustment; and A(s∗) is value of the
random variable a at instant t for some s = s∗.
However, Stochastic Sampling mechanism is not efﬁcient
for large areas where the amount of the pheromone deposited
is similar on every point. In this case, the amount of
pheromone differs a bit and the A∗
s chosen may deﬁne
bad steering directions due to the stochastic nature of the
mechanism. For reducing the possibility of this shortcoming,
a second different mechanism is described and investigated
below.
2) Best Ranked Stochastic Sampling Mechanism: Dif-
ferently from the Stochastic Sampling Mechanism, not all
angle As are considered to deﬁne the steering direction,
but only two subsets, U and V , such that the respective
cardinalities are ϕ and ω; and ϕ+ω ≤ (2S +1). The subset
U consists of angles As associated with the least detected
amount of pheromone. The subset V consists of elements
chosen randomly, according to an uniform distribution, from
the angles As that are not in the subset U.
The rules for building the subsets U and V are such as
follows:
• Subset U
if As ∈ U and Az /∈ U, then τs ≤ τz
• Subset V
if As
∈ V , then As
/∈ U; and As are chosen
randomly
where: τs is deﬁned according to equation 3 and s, z =
−S, . . . , −1, 0, 1, . . . , S.
A probability value is assigned to each discrete angle in
both of the subsets U and V . The probability assigned to
the angle As is inversely proportional to the amount of the
pheromone deposited in the respective angle interval and it
is deﬁned such as:
P(s) =
1 − τs
P
i∈{s|As∈(U∪V )}
(1 − τi)
(5)
Consider As = A∗, As chosen according to a discrete
random variable a deﬁned through the probability P(s),
assuming values in the set {As | As ∈ (U ∨ V )}. At
each time t, the adjustment of steering direction is given
by equation 4:
The basic steps of Best Ranked Stochastic Sampling are
described in the Algorithm 1 for a single robot.

article, the artiﬁcial agents in IAS-SS spread out pheromone
on a wide area in front of their respective positions, corre-
sponding to the sensor range area.
After the agent determines the steering direction (see
equation 4), but before it moves to, it spreads pheromone.
The amount of the pheromone deposited on the ground
decreases as the distance from the robot increases. Consider
that Lk
t is the sensor range area of the kth robot at the iter-
ation t and Q is the entire environment space, respectively,
such that Lk
t ⊂ Q ⊂ R2. Then, the amount of the pheromone

is given by:

0, otherwise
(7)
where: qk is the position of the kth robot; τmax is the
maximum amount of pheromone; σ is the dispersion; and
δ ∈ (0, 1).
Multiple robots deposit pheromone in the environment at
same time, then the total amount of pheromone deposited
on the position q at iteration t depends on the contribution
of every robot.
Furthermore, pheromone is not a stable substance, that is,
it evaporates according to a speciﬁc rate. The total amount
of the pheromone that evaporates Φq(t) at position q and
time t is modeled according to:
Φq(t) = ρτq(t)
(8)
where: ρ is the evaporation rate; and τq(t) is the total amount
of the pheromone on the position q at iteration t.
Therefore, the total amount of the pheromone τq(t) at q
and at time t is given by:

V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Experiment simulations are developed to evaluate prelimi-
narily the bioinspired coordination strategy IAS-SS based on
ant colony algorithm, whereas pheromone causes repulsive
behavior of ants instead of attractive for surveillance task.
The expectation for surveillance task consists of keeping
robots moving among regions of the environment in order
to patrol wholly it constantly. The strategy is considered to
generate the dynamics of the multiple robot system applied
to exploration and surveillance tasks.
The Player/Stage platform (http://robotics.usc.edu/player)
is used to perform the experiments. The Player/Stage is a
robot server designed by the University of Southern Califor-
nia for distributed control (www.usc.edu). Player operates in
a client/server environment and the communication between
them occurs through TCP/IP protocol. Stage is a simulator
for robots and sensors for two-dimensional environments.
Player/Stage models various robots and sensors simulating
simultaneously their exact dynamics, including odometric
error models. For the purpose of the experiments, the robot
Pioneer 2DX is chosen to be modeled in the Player/Stage
platform. This robot is equipped with a laser range-ﬁnder
able to scan the environment (general obstacles, e.g., walls
and objects).
The experiments are arranged in four groups. The ﬁrst
consists of experiments focusing on the steering direction
mechanisms described in Section IV-A. The mechanisms
are compared with a completely uniform one. The second
group of experiments is designed to investigate the inﬂuence
of the conﬁguration of robot initial positions in the task
performances. The experiments in the third group concerns
speciﬁcally the robustness of the coordination strategy re-
garding to the environment structure. Finally, an analysis the
impact of the number of robots on the system performance
is presented in of fourth group.
Since the surveillance task requires the robots are in
constant moving, the IAS-SS system have to experiment
distinct challenges in face of different situations to develop
navigation strategies. In order to maximize the watched
area at the same instant, the goal of IAS-SS system is
to keep robots in different regions avoiding the waste of
sensor resource and reducing the time which an area is non-
monitored. System efﬁciency is measured by how short is
the time in which a region is non-monitored without sharing
regions among robots.
The experimental data are selected and compiled assum-
ing the following meaning. First, the exploration task is
executed if the environment is completely covered, that is,
the system is capable to provide information to map the
environment completely. Moreover, the faster the system
completes the task, the better is its performance. Second,
the system carries out the surveillance task if there is no
instant T* such that after this instant exists a region that is
not sensed anymore. Despite this deﬁnition for surveillance
task is accurate, it is not suitable since may be impossible to
ﬁnd T*. Therefore, for practical purposes, it is important that
the system concludes the task continually, that is, the system
has to be able to sense the entire environment considering
that a new sensing task is started when the system concludes
the previous one. Furthermore, the lesser is the maximum
time between two consecutive sensing tasks, the better is its
performance.
The approach proposed to multi-robot coordination as-
sumes that the environment is represented by occupancy-
grid [33]. It uses a reticulated and probabilistic representa-
tion of information for modeling the unknown environment
according to its laser range-ﬁnder readings. It is deﬁned as a
multidimensional random ﬁeld that contains stochastic esti-
mate of the cell states (occupied, not occupied or unknown)
in the reticulated space. Each robot builds its own map as
it moves and local maps are centralized resulting in a map
of explored environment during surveillance task. Mapping
module is independent of IAS-SS system. However, it is
integrated to verify the explored area while the monitoring
occurs. For releasing pheromone, IAS-SS strategy uses the
same map generated and allocates in each cell reached
by distance sensor a value that corresponds to amount of
pheromone in this local.
The environments where IAS-SS system carries out tasks
are divided in connected small regions called here rooms.
In the context of this following experiments, a room is said
to be visited if its central point is reached by any robot.
In this case, the group of all central points corresponds to
the set Q ∈ R2. Hence, the scenario considered here is
an instance of the problem formulated in Section III. The
system parameters adopted in the experiments are:
• Pheromone releasing and evaporation dynamics:
– σ = 0.43R (radius of the semicircle where the
pheromone is deposited, see Figure 2);
– ρ = 0.01 (evaporation rate); and
– τq(0) = 0.5 (the amount of pheromone at iteration
t = 0).
• Robots and sensors:
– R = 8.00 meters (radius of the semicircle where
the pheromone is deposited, see Figure 2);
– γ = 0.5 (constant coefﬁcient for smoothing of
steering direction adjusting); and
– Robot speed: 0.5 meter per second.
• Steering direction mechanisms:
– S = 360 (number of angle intervals).
• Simulation parameter:
– η = 0.3 meter (maximum distance between the
robot and an obstacle to trigger the obstacle avoid-
ance system);
– Time is discretized by simulation iterations: ts ∈
N;

– Maximum number of iterations = 1000.
These parameter values correspond to those that the mul-
tiple robot system reaches the best performance, considering
all previous experiments executed. Due to aleatory character-
istic of mechanisms for adjustment of steering direction, all
experiments are executed 10 times (trials). Thus, average of
performances are computed to evaluate them. The discrete
time is adopted in simulation and it is equivalent to the
number of iterations.
In the case of implementation of coordination strategy, all
robots are in the same coordinates system. There is a global
map of environment, modeled as occupancy grid, where each
cell hosts a value that represents its state and the amount
of pheromone in this respective local, indicating the time
this cell was not monitored. Initially, all cells are setup as
unknown with amount of pheromone as 0.5 (τq(0)). Since
cells provides similar amount of pheromone, the decision
make of robots tends to random characteristic. There, it takes
some time to robots spread out. As long a robot moves, it
builds its own local map in order to transfer it to the global
map. Thus, a robot is able to detect pheromone left by other
one, because all information about pheromone is avaliable
in global map. The position of robot is not relevant in this
coordination strategy. The substance deposited by robots is
enough to keep them far from each other.
During navigation, robots detect pheromone only in the
cells that coincide to border of pheromone sensor. One of
cells is elected through probability of equation 3 or 5 for SS
and BRSS mechanisms, respectively. Then, the adjustment
of steering direction towards the elected cell occurs by 4.
Before moving, robots release pheromone (i.e., assign values
to cells of occupancy grid) on all cells covered by range of
distance sensor, according to equation 9.
A. Uniform versus Stochastic versus Best Ranked Stochastic
Sampling
Both steering direction strategies, Stochastic Sampling
(SS) and Best Ranked Stochastic Sampling (BRSS), have
profound random characteristics, since the steering direction
adjustment is determined according to a discrete random
variable. In order to show that the respective performances
are not a mere consequence of a random behavior, the
strategies are compared with a uniform strategy (US). This
strategy is able to execute neither the exploration nor the
surveillance tasks. Different compiled data sets are consid-
ered to assess the strategies, namely: time to conclude the
exploration task; and time interval between two consecutive
sensing of any speciﬁc region. According to US strategy, a
discrete random variable, deﬁned by a uniform distribution
in the space of the angles As, determines the steering
direction adjustments. Observe that there is no connection
between the pheromone and the uniform strategy; different
from the SS and BRSS strategies.
The environment designed for evaluation is such as in
Figure 3. It is possible to identify six rooms. Three robots
k, k ∈ {1, 2, 3}, start the navigation at the room 1.

The performance of IAS-SS system according to mecha-
nisms for adjustment of steering direction. Two aspects are
considered for analysis: the time necessary to conclude the
exploration task (SE); and maximum time interval between
two consecutive sensing of any speciﬁc region (SI). The
data are in Table I with the respective standard deviation
for the average of number or SE and the average of SI
considering 10 trials for each experiment. The performance
of IAS-SS system is improved gradually as shown in graphic
of Figure 4. It shows the boxplots of average of surveillance
intervals of three mechanisms. The numbers 1, 2 and 3 refer
to US, SS and BRSS mechanisms, respectively.

Additional information about the behavior of the system
can be gathered observing the Figure 5. It exhibits three sets
of graphics that summarize the simulation conducted, each
of which corresponding to a different strategy. Data used to
plot the graphics are from the trial with the median number
of SI. For each strategy, three graphics are presented, each
of which registering the behavior of one of the robots. The
y-axis represents the rooms and the x-axis represents the
iterations. Each vertical line indicates the SE, that is, the
iteration when IAS-SS senses the whole environment (the
robots visit cooperatively all the 6 rooms), considering that
a new sense task is started after the system concludes the
earlier one.
Considering the exploration task, the graphics show that
the IAS-SS system with the Uniform Strategy is able to
conclude the exploration task, but after a long time, precisely
at the iteration 624. Observe that with strategies SS and
BRSS the IAS-SS system executes more efﬁciently the task,
that is, the system concludes the task very earlier, at the it-
erations 126 and 120, respectively. The IAS-SS system with
US strategy concludes the surveillance task only once (there

Boxplots of distibution of the average of surveillance intervals
for differents mechanisms for adjustment of steering direction
is only one SE), considering all the simulation. There is a
strong contrast if this performance is compared with those
obtained with the strategies SS and BRSS. Vertical lines
indicate that the system with these strategies continually
concludes the surveillance tasks (all the robots cooperatively
visit the 6 rooms).
Pheromone distribution in an environment is an evidence
of efﬁciency of strategy. The IAS-SS strategy is more
efﬁcient if the distribution of amount of pheromone is more
egalitarian in entire environment. In this case, the average of
amount of pheromone in all environment composes the map
of pheromone distribution. It indicates the frequency when
a speciﬁc region was visited (or monitored) in relative to
others. To comprehension of map, regions with low amount
of pheromone are represented by blue color, whereas red
color denotes regions with high amount of pheromone (or
visitation frequency higher). Hence, to comprove the best
performance of strategy when BRSS mechanism is adopted,
Figure 6 shows the average of amount of pheromone for
mechanisms of adjustment of steering direction. According
to the same data used to plot the graphics of Figure 5, the
pheromone distribution is more uniform for BRSS strategy
(Fig 6(c). In constrast, it can be noted that more amount of
pheromone in rooms 1 and 5 for execution of US strategy
(Figure 6(a)).
These data are summarized in the Tables II and III. The
system with SS strategy concludes the surveillance task
4 times and BRSS 7 times, and the maximum intervals
between two consecutive conclusions are 304 and 189 itera-
tions, respectively. The IAS-SS system with BRSS is clearly
superior. The strategies SS and BRSS induce a stronger
collaborative robot behavior than in the case of US strategy.
Observe that robots in the pheromone dependent strategies
vary more the rooms that they visit than robots do in the
case of US strategy.
B. Initial position of robots
This group of experiments evaluates the efﬁciency of
IAS-SS for distinct conﬁguration of robots regards as their
positions. Two cases of conﬁguration of robots are designed
in order to analyze the performance system: 1) together
conﬁguration robots start navigation at same region (or
room) and 2) separated conﬁguration at distinct rooms. For
exploration and surveillance tasks, it is obvious the greater
efﬁciency is guaranteed when the robots are not closer.
However, experiments intend to demonstrate that, after a
while, scenarios of joint conﬁguration can achieve the same
efﬁciency of separated conﬁguration. Experiments to verify

the performance according to initial position of robots is
accomplished in environment of Figure 7. For both of cases
of conﬁguration, three robots are launched. In particular for
separated and together conﬁgurations, they start navigation
at rooms 2, 6 and 7; and room 1, respectively.
Figure 7.
Environment structure
For the next experiments, six environment conﬁgurations
are generated from combination of cases of conﬁgurations
(separated and together) and steering direction mechanisms
of experiments of Section V-A. Analogously to the previous
experiments, two aspects are considered for analysis of the
performance of IAS-SS system. As can be seen in the
Table IV, the separated conﬁguration with SS mechanism
yields the best performance, regarding both number of SE
(nb. of SE) and average of SI (av. of SI). In the case of
together conﬁguration, the best results are obtained with the
BRSS mechanism, which is, in fact, the best overall strategy.
The Figure 8 shows the boxplots of the surveillance intervals
of the six environment conﬁgurations. The numbers 1,. . ., 6
refer to environment separated conﬁguration with US, SS
and BRSS mechanism; and environment together conﬁgura-
tion with US, SS and BRSS mechanisms, respectively.
The key of surveillance task is minimizing the time
(iterations) which a region is non-monitored. Hence, here,
a manner to measure the system performance is to analyze
the maximum period (maximum number of iterations) which
each room is non-visited. Maximum periods that rooms are
non-visited are presented in Figure 9 for the six environment
conﬁgurations. Data used to plot the graphics are from the
trial with the median of average of number of SE and
average of SI. Although separated conﬁguration presents
slightly advantage over together conﬁguration, since at it-
eration t = 0, three robots monitor three different rooms,
the performances of both conﬁgurations are similar. One
of main characteristics of IAS-SS system is the skill of

robots to keep distance from each other according to aversive
pheromone. Then, even with together conﬁguration, as long
the robots move, they are spread in environment. Thus, the
performance of together conﬁguration becomes similar to
separated conﬁguration. That is, the advantage of separated
conﬁguration is diluted during navigation. To illustrate this
scenery, graphics of Figure 10 show the behavior of robots
and surveillance intervals for separated and together conﬁgu-
rations using BRSS mechanism. They show that the IAS-SS
system with the separated conﬁguration concludes the SE
task 6 times while the together conﬁguration takes 7 times.
The next set of experiments investigates how the envi-
ronment scale parameter inﬂuences the performance of the
IAS-SS strategy. Two environments are considered, Both
present the same layout of the environment of Figure 7,
but with different sizes. The ﬁrst is 2 times larger than that

environment, while the second is 3 times. The environment
used in previous experiments and the two newly deﬁned
are called here environments x1, x2 and x3, respectively.
The motivation to enlarge the scale of the environment is to
asses the suitability of the strategy in sensing all parts of the
rooms.Differently from experiments of environment x1, the
number of iterations for experiments with environments x2
and x3 are 2000 and 3000, respectively.
The self-adapt trait of the system is visualized through
the trajectories of robots of Figure 11. Only the obtained
trajectories from simulation of experiments that consider
BRSS mechanism and together conﬁguration the are showed
in order to contrast the slight difference of performed paths.
It can observed that the trajectories are concentrated in a trail
when the rooms are small (Figure 11(a)). An explanation
for this outcome is the small size of rooms. In this case, the
sensor range covers the whole room as the robot enters in the
room. While for large regions resultant from environments
with duplicated and triplicated scale, the robots move away
from the trail to cover the entire environment efﬁciently
(Figures 11(b) and 11(c)). The data presented are from the
trial with the median number of SI for each environment
conﬁguration.
Analogously to the experiments regarding environment
x1, the performances of separated and together conﬁgura-
tions for environments x2 and x3 are similar. This is justiﬁed
by repulsive characteristic of pheromone, which keeps the
robots far from each other after while independently of the
adopted conﬁguration (separated or together). The Tables V
and VI corroborate that there is no strong contrast among

Regarding the adjustment of steering mechanisms, those
conﬁgurations with BRSS mechanism yield the best per-
formance when the average of number of SE and average
of SI are compared to other mechanisms. The performance
of IAS-SS system for the six environment conﬁguration is
shown in graphics of Figure 12. The numbers 1,. . ., 6 refer to
environment separated conﬁguration with US, SS and BRSS
mechanisms; and environment together conﬁguration with

Maximum periods that rooms are non-visited in exper-
iments of environments x2 and x3 are presented in Fig-
ures 13(a) and 13(b), respectively, for the six environment
conﬁgurations. Data used to plot the graphics are from the
trial with the median of average of number of SE and
average of SI. It can be noted that regardless which con-
ﬁguration is employed, the system performance improves as
long as the mechanism for adjustment of steering direction
changes from US to BRSS. The behavior of robots and
surveillance intervals for separated and together conﬁgu-
rations using BRSS mechanism is clariﬁed in graphics of
Figures 14 (environment x2) and 15 (environment x3). For

C. Environment Structure
One of characteristic if IAS-SS strategy is the self-adapt.
It is emphasized in this section. Following experiments aim
at analyzing the performance of exploration and surveillance
tasks independently of environment structure. To investi-
gate this characteristic, distinct environment structures are
designed from a rectangular space divided virtually in 10
rooms as illustrated in Figure 16(a). The connectivity among
adjacent rooms is represented by a graph (Figure 16(b)).
Accesses that connect rooms are partially or totally blocked
by obstacles, generating different environments. According
to this process, ten models of environment are considered,
such that, each environment is associated to a complexity
level.
Complexity level is measured according to number of
options to travel the environment (among rooms), that is,
through graph structure resultant from connection among
rooms. The more path options to reach a speciﬁc region are
available, the complexity level of environment is higher. For
environments of Figures 16(c) and 16(d), the graph structure
is the same of the graph of Figure 16(b), hence, the com-

plexity is low. As obstacles are inserted into environments
blocking the passage amoung rooms, the respective edges of
graph are removed and, thus, the complexity is higher.
Since there are ten rooms, four robots are considered for
experiments to assign at least two rooms to each robot.
This forces the robots travels long distances increasing the
likelihood ﬁnd challenging situations as obstacles. All robots
start at room 1.
Although it is clear that the exploration time decreases as
complexity level increases, the surveillance task is accom-
plished even with a restricted number of path options. This
emphasizes that environment structure is not a factor that
impedes the tasks to execute. Even robots in environments
with higher complexity level can carry out the tasks. The
environment sensing (SE) is completed independently of the
environment structure. As general behavior of the system,
the length of SI period is increased while the complexity
level of environment increases. Also, as consequence of the
higher complexity, the number of completed SE is smaller.
This can be observed in Table VII. The average of number
of SE increases and the average of SI presents a strong
decreasing tendency, which is not monotonic due to the
random nature of experiments. Therefore, it is observed
that the system self-adapt according to changes in the
environment model. A more detailed view of results of table,
regarding the average of SI, is presented in the Figure 17. It
shows the boxplots of the distribution of the performance.
The self-adapt trait of the system is visualized through
the trajectories of robots and maps of average of amount
of pheromone of Figure 18 for some environment models
in order to contrast the high difference of complexity level
among them. It can observed that the trajectories are concen-

trated in a trail when the rooms are small. An explanation
for this outcome is the small size of rooms. In this case,
the sensor range covers whole the room. While for large
regions resultant from junction rooms in environments #1
and #3, the robots move away from the trail to cover the
entire environment efﬁciently. The data presented are from
the trial with the median number of SI for each environment.
D. Number of robots
This section discusses about the relation between the size
of environment and number of robots. Indeed, higher number
of robots is, more regions are explored and monitored
simultaneously, so that, few or no regions are empty for
long period. Since robots behavior is based on inverse of
ant algorithm, the probability of one robot explorer and
monitor large environments is higher. However, it may
take a long time. In order to evaluate the performance of
motion coordination and the efﬁciency of surveillance task,
experiments are carried out with an increasing number of

presented better performance than US and RS mechanisms in
previous experiments, this mechanism is adopted to analyze
the efﬁciency of the exploration and surveillance tasks while
the number the robots increases. All added robots are placed
at room 1.

Environment structure
Although it is clear that the time to explore decreases as
number of robots increases, the surveillance task is accom-
plished even with a restricted number. This emphasizes that
number of robots is not a factor to limit the size of the
explored environment. Even few robots are able to monitor
large areas. The environment sensing (SE) is completed
independently of the number of robots. However, as general
behavior of system, the length of SI period is reduced while
the number of robots increases. Also, as consequence of
the addition of robots, there are more completed SE. This
can be observed in Table VIII. As the number of robots
increases, the average of number of SE increases together.
Conversely, the average of SI presents a strong decreasing
tendency, which is not monotonic due to the aleatory nature
of experiments. Therefore, it is observed that the system self-
adapt according to the number of robots. A more detailed
view of results of table, regarding the average of SI, is
presented in the Figure 20. It shows the boxplots of the
distribution of the performance for the 10 trials.

E. For Real Robots
For the validation of IAS-SS strategy in a real robots
plataform, two approaches are suggested. The ﬁrst one is
to equip physical robots with devices for releasing some
chemical and odour sensors. As long as the robots navigate,
they left this substance in the frontal regions to mark them as
explored regions. Through odour sensors, the robots are able
to detect the regions more attractive, i.e., the regions with
low amount of the substance. The second one only considers
distance sensors, disgarding the presence of the odour sen-
sors. Then, applying the mapping method, occupancy-grid,
as mentioned in Section V, the generated cells could be used
for hosting a value that indicates the amount of deposited
pheromone. Hence, the amount of pheromone would exist in
a virtual way. The virtual pheromone releasing and detecting
areas correspond to the range area of the distance sensors.
However, in the last approach, a localization method [34]
would be need in order to each robot to built its own
local map and, accordingly, to join it with the local maps
of another robots. Thus, using less sensors, the strategy is
able to explore the entire environment and to perform the
surveillance task. The implementation in real robots makes
part of future works.
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS
In this work, it was proposed a new bio-inspired dis-
tributed coordination strategy, named IAS-SS, for multiple
robot systems applied for exploration and surveillance tasks.
The strategy is based on swarm theory, speciﬁcally the ant
system theory. The repulsive character as a function of the
deposited pheromone quantity determines the dynamic of
behavior of the agents (robots) and stimulates them to be
spread out by the environment. As a consequence, the agents
get to monitor the entire environment continuously, visiting
regions not recently visited. Furthermore, other contributions
can be highlighted, such as, the development of a decentral-
ized strategy, where the robots are independent agents that
deﬁne their steering direction without an extern inﬂuence;
a reactive strategy, in which the only information necessary
for the robots is extracted from amount of pheromone and,
ﬁnally, a pheromone trail is not generated, since the deposit
of pheromone occurs only in areas covered by distance
sensors (i.e., frontal areas to the robot).
Although the strategy is very simple compared to other
environment exploration strategies, both exploration and
surveillance tasks were efﬁciently performed. A set of
experiments were done for analising the performance of
the proposed system. Experiments considered two perfor-
mance criteria: the average of the numbers of surveillance
epochs and average of the surveillance time intervals. Four
parameters, namely: start position, number of robots, envi-
ronment scale and environment structure; stress the strategy
capabilities. Two versions of the IAS-SS strategy were
considered and compared with a totally random strategy.
The IAS-SS strategies presented signiﬁcantly a superior
performance. Some characteristics of these strategies were
noted, such as, they are not dependent on the knowledge
of the environment structure and they are robust in regard
to the number of robots. These strategies kept robots well
separated guiding them toward regions not recently visited.
The advantage of the bioinspired strategy proposed resides
in, among other aspects: simple conceptual ideas, reduced
computation complexity, real time operation and efﬁciency.
It is important to say that calculate the complexity of
proposed algorithm is a tedious task. Since the performance
criterium is the number of SE and average of SI, the
obtained results present distinct perfomance due to changes
of structure of environments, number of robots and initial
position conﬁguration. Therefore, there are many combina-
tions to establish the coordination strategy. In addition, the
approaches about monitoring found in literature emphasize
graphs to deﬁne the routes of robots. Therefore, there is
no approach similar to the present proposal in order to
summarize a suitable comparison of complexity.
As future works experiments will be designed to investi-
gate two aspects: how different pheromone releasing mecha-
nisms inﬂuence the performance of the IAS-SS system; and
to investigate the adaptation capability when some robots
fail. Moreover, a method to join maps will be conceived
and integrated to IAS-SS system in order to apply it in
real robots. Thus, it is need to develop a communication
device to support change information about mapping. This
device, coupled to robots, will able to identify other robots
and transfer data through wireless network. In addition, more
complex surveillance tasks, e.g., those that a strange agent
invades the environment, will be investigated. In this case,
a vision system with tracking ability is essential.
