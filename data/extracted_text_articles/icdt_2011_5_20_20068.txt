Abstract- This work presents the synchronizer based on pulse 
comparation, 
between 
variable 
and 
fixed 
pulses. 
This 
synchronizer has two variants, one operating by both transitions 
at the bit rate and other operating by both transitions at quarter 
rate. Each variant has two versions which are the manual and 
the automatic. The objective is to study the four synchronizers 
and evaluate their output jitter UIRMS (Unit Interval Root 
Mean Square) versus input SNR (Signal Noise Ratio). 
Keywords - Prefilter; Synchronizers; Communication systems. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
This work studies the sequential symbol synchronizer, with 
a phase comparator based on a pulse comparation, between a 
variable pulse Pv and a fixed reference pulse Pf. 
The synchronizer has four types supported in two variants, 
one operating by both transitions at rate and other operating 
by both transitions at quarter rate. The variant at the rate has 
two versions namely the manual (b-m) and the automatic (b-
a). The variant at quarter rate has also two versions, namely 
the manual (b-m/4) and the automatic (b-a/4) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. 
The difference between them is only in the phase 
comparator since the other blocks are equal [6, 7, 8]. 
The error pulse Pe (Pv - Pf) controls the VCO (Voltage 
Controlled Oscillator) to synchronize with the input data. 
The variable pulse Pv is common to manual and automatic 
versions but the fixed pulse Pf is different [9, 10]. 
The VCO output is the clock, with good quality, that 
samples the input data at the maximum opening eye diagram 
and retimes its bit duration [11, 12]. 
Fig. 1 shows the blocks diagram of the synchronizer.

Kf is the phase comparator gain, F(s) is the loop filter, Ko is 
the VCO gain and Ka is the loop amplification factor that 
controls the root locus and then the loop characteristics. 
Following, we present the variant at bit rate with their 
manual and automatic versions. Next, we present the variant 
at the half bit rate with their manual and automatic versions. 
After, we present the design and tests. Then, we present the 
results. Finally, we present the conclusions. 
 
II. STATE OF THE ART, PROBLEM AND SOLUTION 
In priori and actual-art state, were developed various 
synchronizers operating, initially, at the bit rate. After, we 
developed synchronizers operating at half rate. Now, we 
present synchronizers operating at a quarter rate. This 
contribution increases the know-how about synchronizers. 
Our motivation is to create new synchronizers and evaluate 
their performance. The problem is that the synchronizers have 
speed limitations. One solution proposes internal low 
frequency operation, but external high speed rate [1, 2, 3, 4]. 
 
III. SYNCHRONIZERS OPERATING AT THE RATE 
The synchronizer with its VCO operates, here, at the data 
transmission rate. 
This variant has the manual and the automatic versions, the 
difference in only in the phase comparator. The variable pulse 
Pv consists of first flip flop with exor and is equal in the two 
versions, but the fixed pulse Pf is different [1, 2]. 
 
A. Operation at the rate and manual version 
 
The manual version has a phase comparator, where the 
fixed pulse Pf is produced by an exor with a delay ∆t=T/2, 
that needs a previous manual adjustment (Fig. 2)

B. Operation at the rate and automatic version 
 
The automatic version has a phase comparator where the 
fixed pulse Pf is produced automatically by the second flip 
flop with exor, without previous adjustment (Fig. 4).

IV. SYNCHRONIZERS OPERATING AT QUARTER RATE 
The synchronizer with its phase comparator operates, here, 
by both transitions at quarter data transmission rate.  
This variant has the manual (b-m/4) and the automatic (b-
a/4) versions, the difference is only in the phase comparator. 
The variable pulse Pv, based in the four first flip flops with 
multiplexer and exor, is equal in the two versions, but the 
fixed pulse Pf is produced from a different way [3, 4]. 
 
A. Operation at quarter rate and manual version 
 
The manual version has a phase comparator, where the 
fixed pulse Pf is produced by an exor with a delay ∆t=T/2, 
that needs a previous manual adjustment  (Fig. 6).

fixed pulse Pf is produced automatically by the seconds flip 
flops and multiplexer with exor, without previous adjustment 
(Fig. 8).

V. DESIGN, TESTS AND RESULTS 
We will present the design, the tests and the results of the 
referred  synchronizers [5]. 
 
A. Design 
 
To get guaranteed results, it is necessary to dimension all 
the synchronizers with equal conditions. Then it is necessary 
to design all the loops with identical linearized transfer 
functions. 
The general loop gain is Kl=Kd.Ko=Ka.Kf.Ko where Kf is 
the phase comparator gain, Ko is the VCO gain and Ka is the 
control amplification factor that permits the desired 
characteristics. 
For analysis facilities, we use a normalized transmission 
rate tx=1baud, what implies also normalized values for the 
others dependent parameters. So, the normalized clock 
frequency is fCK=1Hz. 
We choose a normalized external noise bandwidth Bn = 
5Hz and a normalized loop noise bandwidth Bl = 0.02Hz. 
Later, we can disnormalize these values to the appropriated 
transmission rate tx. 
Now, we will apply a signal with noise ratio SNR given by 
the signal amplitude Aef, noise spectral density No and 
external noise bandwidth Bn, so the SNR = A2
ef/(No.Bn). 
But, No can be related with the noise variance σn and inverse 
sampling 
∆τ=1/Samp, 
then 
No=2σn2.∆τ, 
so 
SNR=A2
ef/(2σn2.∆τ.Bn) = 0.52/(2σn2*10-3*5)= 25/σn2. 
After, we observe the output jitter UI as function of the 
input signal with noise SNR. The dimension of the loops is 
 
- 1st order loop: 
The loop filter F(s)=1 with cutoff frequency 0.5Hz (Bp=0.5 
Hz is 25 times bigger than Bl=0.02Hz) eliminates only the 
high frequency, but maintain the loop characteristics. 
The transfer function is

=
 = 0.02Hz                                (2) 
 
Then, for the analog synchronizers, the loop bandwidth is 
Bl=0.02=(Ka.Kf.Ko)/4 with (Km=1, A=1/2, B=1/2; Ko=2π) 
(Ka.Km.A.B.Ko)/4 = 0.02 -> Ka=0.08*2/π                       (3) 
For the hybrid synchronizers, the loop bandwidth is                                      
Bl=0.02=(Ka.Kf.Ko)/4 with (Km=1, A=1/2, B=0.45; Ko=2π) 
(Ka.Km.A.B.Ko)/4 = 0.02 -> Ka=0.08*2.2/π                     (4) 
For the combinational synchronizers, the loop bandwidth is 
Bl=0.02=(Ka.Kf.Ko)/4     with     (Kf=1/π; Ko=2π) 
(Ka*1/π*2π)/4 = 0.02 -> Ka=0.04                                 (5) 
For the sequential synchronizers, the loop bandwidth is                                
Bl=0.02=(Ka.Kf.Ko)/4     with     (Kf=1/2π; Ko=2π) 
(Ka*1/2π*2π)/4 =0.02 -> Ka=0.08                                (6) 
 
The jitter depends on the RMS signal Aef, on the power 
spectral density No and on the loop noise bandwidth Bl. 
For analog PLL the jitter is 
σφ2=Bl.No/Aef2=Bl.2.σn2.∆τ=0.02*10-3*2σn2/0.52=16*10-5.σn2 
For the others PLLs the jitter formula is more complicated. 
 
- 2nd order loop: 
The second order loop is not shown here, but the results are 
identical to the ones obtained above for the first order loop. 
 
B. Tests 
 
The following figure (Fig. 10) shows the setup that was 
used to test the various  synchronizers. 
 
 
 Fig. 10 Block diagram of the test setup 
 
The receiver recovered clock with jitter is compared with 
the emitter original clock without jitter, the difference is the 
jitter of the received clock. 
 
C. Jitter measurer (Meter) 
 
The jitter measurer (Meter) consists of a RS flip flop, which 
detects the random variable phase of the recovered clock 
(CKR), relatively to the fixed phase of the emitter clock 
(CKE). This relative random phase variation is the recovered 
clock jitter (Fig. 11).

The other blocks convert this random phase variation into a 
random amplitude variation, which is the jitter histogram. 
Then, the jitter histogram is sampled and processed by an 
appropriate program, providing the RMS jitter and the peak 
to peak jitter. 
 
D. Results 
 
We will present the four synchronizer results in terms of 
output jitter UIRMS versus input SNR. 
Fig. 12 shows the jitter-SNR curves of the four 
synchronizers with both transitions, at rate manual version (b-
m), at rate automatic version (b-a), at quarter rate manual 
version (b-m/4) and at quarter rate automatic version (b-a/4). 
 
Fig. 12 Jitter-SNR curves of  the 4 synchronizers(b-m,b-a,b-m/2,b-a/2) 
 
We see that, in general, the output jitter UIRMS decreases 
gradually with the input SNR increasing. However, the both 
quarter rate automatic (b-a/4) has some irregularities. 
For high SNR, the four synchronizer jitter curves tend to be 
similar. However, for low SNR, the manual versions (b-m, b-
m/4) are significantly better than the automatic versions (b-a, 
b-a/4), the both transition at rate manual (b-m) is slightly the 
best. Also, for an intermediate SNR (SNR≅10), the both 
transitions quarter rate automatic (b-a/4) has a significant 
jitter perturbation, due to some losses of synchronism. 
 
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
We studied four synchronizers using both transitions, with 
two variants, one operating at the rate that has two versions 
namely the manual (b-m) and the automatic (b-a) and other 
variant operating at quarter rate that has also two versions 
namely the manual (b-m/4) and the automatic (b-a/4). Then, 
we tested their jitter - noise curves. 
We observed that, in general, the output jitter curves 
decreases gradually with the input SNR increasing. However, 
the quarter rate automatic (b-a/4) has some irregularities. 
We verified that, for high SNR, the four synchronizers jitter 
curves tend to be similar, this is comprehensible since the 
synchronizers are digital and have similar noise margin. 
However, for low SNR, the manual versions (b-m, b-m/4) 
are significantly better than the automatic versions (b-a, b-
a/4), this is comprehensible since the automatic versions have 
more digital states than the manual versions, then the error 
state propagation effects is aggravated. 
The version at rate manual (b-m) is slightly the best because 
has less digital states. On the other hand, the version at 
quarter rate automatic (b-a/4) has a significant jitter 
perturbation (SNR≅10) due to some losses of synchronism. 
In the future, we are planning to extend the present study to 
other types of synchronizers.
