Abstract - In Japan, the maintenance and management of aging 
bridges, highways, and other civil infrastructure and buildings 
is an important social issue. Proper maintenance and 
management require regular and highly accurate inspections, 
but these inspections rely on visual examinations by humans, 
which are expensive. Hence, to make this process more efficient, 
there is a need to automate inspections using sensing systems. 
Moreover, after a disaster, such as a major earthquake or a 
tsunami, it is necessary to expedite evacuation operations and 
rescue people, and for this purpose, the viability of or damage 
to each structure must be accurately evaluated using a sensing 
system. To meet these challenges, research and development is 
being carried out on an autonomous time-synchronized sensing 
system. The system adds high-precision time information to 
measurement data, acquires and analyzes digital sensor data 
that are time-synchronized, and uses it to automate inspections. 
As a first step in this research, a sensor device was developed 
that performs autonomous time-synchronized sensing using a 
digital high-precision accelerometer. As a second step, a 
heterogeneous digital sensing platform was developed that can 
be connected to a camera sensor in addition to a digital 
accelerometer. The data from the digital accelerometer and 
images from the camera sensor are given a unified time stamp 
synchronized with the absolute time at the moment of data 
acquisition, thereby enabling synchronized measurement of 
vibration and images. A mechanism was implemented to add 
time stamps to the outputs of the digital accelerometer and 
camera sensor using the timekeeping accuracy of a chip-scale 
atomic clock (CSAC) mounted on the sensor device. As a 
prototype, the heterogeneous digital sensing platform achieved 
the desired performance. In this paper, an autonomous time-
synchronized sensing system, which was newly designed and 
built to be applied to actual bridges, highways and buildings to 
stably acquire data from a digital accelerometer with accurate 
time information, image data from a camera sensor and data 
from any type of analog sensor, based on knowledge obtained in 
previous development, is reported.

 INTRODUCTION 
As civil infrastructure, such as bridges and highways as 
well as high-rise buildings, deteriorate over time, automation 
of inspections for their maintenance and management is an 
important social issue. In addition, Japan is prone to 
earthquakes and other disasters, so there is a need to detect 
damage to structures immediately after a disaster and to assess 
the damage status. Data collection by sensing systems is 
necessary to automate these inspections and damage detection, 
but time synchronization across sensors must be ensured in 
order to analyze the data measured by multiple sensors and 
evaluate structural viability. Without time-synchronized data, 
time-series analysis using phase information cannot be 
performed. Time synchronization methods have been realized 
using dedicated wiring, wired or wireless networks, etc. 
However, when wiring is required, it places significant 
restrictions on the locations where sensors can be installed, 
and when wireless communication is used, it can be applied 
only where wireless communication is possible between 
sensors. In either case, it is impossible to deploy sensors over 
a wide area. On the other hand, if sensors installed at arbitrary 
locations can autonomously maintain accurate 
time 
information, this problem can be overcome. The method of 
using Global Positioning System (GPS) signals is effective 
outdoors, but cannot be used inside buildings, underground, 
under bridges or in tunnels. Therefore, a sensor device was 
developed that autonomously maintains accurate time 
information using a chip-scale atomic clock (CSAC) [2][3][7], 
which is an ultra-high precision clock [4][8][9]. In order to 
apply the sensor device to earthquake observation, logic was 
implemented to detect the occurrence of earthquakes and store 
data of earthquake events, and its functionality was confirmed 
in a shaking table experiment. The developed sensor device 
was also installed in actual buildings and bridges, and applied 
to earthquake observation and structural viability assessment 
[4]. However, the sensor device had a MEMS accelerometer, 
which made it difficult to accurately measure minute 
vibrations, and there was still a risk of noise contamination in 
the analog signal. The accelerometer mounted in the sensor 
device is therefore now a digital type, eliminating the risk of 
noise [5]. A camera sensor can also be connected to the sensor 
device, and a heterogeneous digital sensor platform was 
developed as a prototype [6]. In this paper, details of the 
autonomous time-synchronized sensing system, newly 
designed and built based on knowledge obtained from 
previous research and development, and a mechanism for 
adding ultra-high-precision time information to sensor data by 
a CSAC are described.

In this paper, Section II shows the existing time 
synchronization methods and describes their problems and 
achievement of the development of digital sensing platform 
proposed in this research. Section III describes the 
configuration of autonomous time-synchronized sensing 
system and the development of the actual sensor device. 
Further, Sections IV and V describe the performance 
verification experiments on the time synchronization and the 
time stamp of developed camera sensor device, respectively. 
It is confirmed that time synchronization among the 
developed digital sensor devices with camera is achieved.  
II. 
STATE OF THE ART 
Many studies have been done on time synchronization in 
sensing, including the use of Global Navigation Satellite 
System (GNSS) signals via satellites, and the Network Time 
Protocol (NTP) [10] for time synchronization on the Internet. 
There are also studies that have achieved time synchronization 
by taking advantage of the characteristics of wireless sensor 
networks, such as low propagation delay. For example, 
protocols, such as Reference Broadcast Synchronization, 
Timing-sync Protocol for Sensor Networks, Flooding Time 
Synchronization Protocol, etc., have been studied [11]-[15]. 
However, although time synchronization methods that use 
wireless technology are convenient, there is no guarantee that 
wireless communication will always be available. Particularly, 
if wireless communication is disrupted during a disaster, such 
as an earthquake, it will be impossible to perform time-
synchronized sensing, and data analysis cannot be carried out. 
Another technology that achieves highly accurate time 
synchronization indoors is the IEEE 1588 Precision Time 
Protocol (PTP), which employs Ethernet cables used in 
general Local Area Networks (LANs) as the transmission path, 
and time packets to achieve a synchronization accuracy within 
1 microsecond. However, it is difficult to ensure stable 
synchronization accuracy due to fluctuations in packet delay 
and packet loss due to congestion within the LAN. In addition, 
because the delay is compensated by packet switching, the 
number of PTP devices that can be connected to the master 
device is limited, and it is not possible to deploy them in a 
Wide Area Network environment, where the delay changes 
dramatically. 
When GPS signals are not available, wireless transmission 
and reception are unstable, and wired network connections are 
unavailable, it is nevertheless desirable for sensors to 
autonomously maintain accurate absolute time information in 
order to acquire data that ensure long-term, stable time 
synchronization. If each sensor can provide accurate absolute 
time information (a time stamp) to the data it measures, sensor 
data with autonomous time synchronization can be obtained. 
It was therefore decided to develop a sensor device that 
autonomously maintains accurate absolute time information 
by applying a CSAC [2][3][7], which is a clock with high 
timekeeping accuracy, The CSAC is a clock that can achieve 
ultra-high accuracy time measurement of the order of tens of 
picoseconds (5×10-11 seconds), while being sufficiently 
ultra-compact to be mounted on a board. Development began 
in 2001 with support from Defense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency (DARPA), and a consumer version was 
released in 2011. The CSAC is expected to be further 
miniaturized and lower-priced as it becomes more widely 
used for applications, such as countermeasures against 
interference with GPS due to jamming signals, high-precision 
positioning in environments without access to GPS signals, 
installation in smartphones and advanced disaster monitoring. 
CSACs have a smaller error by 4 to 8 digits than that of 
timekeeping using a crystal oscillator, NTP or GPS signals, 
which are commonly used in sensor devices. If this CSAC is 
installed in each sensor device and a mechanism implemented 
to add a high-precision time stamp to the sampling of 
measured data, time-synchronized sensor data can be 
collected even when GPS signals are unavailable, wireless 
transmission/reception is unstable, and wired network 
connections are not available. In previous development, the 
sensor device had an analog MEMS accelerometer, and the 
system configuration was such that any analog sensor could 
be connected via an external input interface. However, since 
the accuracy of an analog MEMS accelerometer was not high 
and the risk of noise contamination of the analog signal 
remained, it was decided to develop a fully digital sensing 
platform. Specifically, a digital accelerometer was installed in 
the sensor device to enable highly sensitive acceleration 
measurement without the risk of noise contamination, while a 
camera sensor could also be connected, and a technology was 
developed to accurately time-stamp both digital outputs using 
the CSAC. The data acquired by the sensor device described 
in this paper, which ensure time synchronization, can be used 
for the purpose of civil infrastructure inspection and structural 
viability assessment of buildings. 
III. 
AUTONOMOUS TIME-SYNCHRONIZED SENSING 
SYSTEM AND CIRCUIT CONFIGURATION 
If an ordinary sensor device is provided with a CSAC to 
correct the time information of the CPU and perform 
measurement, the CSAC's timekeeping accuracy is too high, 
which results in a delay. Therefore, to add the time 
information of the CSAC directly to the sensor's measurement 
data by hardware, a mechanism was implemented using a 
Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), which is a 
dedicated integrated circuit. In this way, measurement data 
with absolute time information added by the FPGA are stored 
in a storage device and collected over a network, without 
putting an excessive load on the CPU of the sensor device. 
Moreover, since the FPGA is programmable, it can not only 
handle CSAC time information but can also incorporate logic 
for detecting the occurrence of earthquakes and fires using the 
measurement data. In this paper, a mechanism whereby 
accurate CSAC time stamps are added to the outputs of a 
digital-type accelerometer, a camera sensor and an external 
analog input, is described. 
 
A. System Configuration 
As shown in Figure 1, the sensor device developed in this 
research consists of an oscillator and FPGA that synchronize 
GPS time (GPST) with a CSAC, provide a stable reference 
signal, and maintain absolute time information; a sensor 
section with a digital accelerometer and an external analog 
sensor input interface; a signal processing board with a CPU;

and a camera for capturing images. The oscillator and FPGA 
supply a high-precision 10 MHz reference clock and 1 Pulse 
Per Second (PPS) signal, and the FPGA generates time stamps 
and trigger signals for acquiring data. The sensor section 
comprises a digital accelerometer and an external analog 
sensor input interface. Any analog sensor can be connected to 
the external analog sensor input interface. The digital 
accelerometer outputs data in response to a trigger signal via 
a Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART). 
Data from the sensor connected to the external analog sensor 
input interface are converted by A/D converters in response to 
trigger signals, and output as 16-bit serial values. The camera 
sensor can release the shutter in response to a trigger signal, 
and output RGB values. The acquired data are stored in a 
connected Solid-State Drive (SSD). Camera data and sensor 
data are stored on separate SSDs in consideration of access 
speed. This data can be viewed, retrieved or deleted via the 
network by taking out each SSD, or by using the system's file 
server function. Operations, such as measurement setup, time 
setting and operation mode change are performed via the 
network. As for the network, the system has an internal wired 
LAN and Wi-Fi, so users can choose either one. 
 
B. Oscillator and FPGA 
Figures 2 and 3 show the configuration and appearance of 
the oscillator and FPGA sections. The oscillator and FPGA 
sections have the function of synchronizing the CSAC with 1 
PPS output from the GPS module or 1 PPS input from outside, 
and generate triggers to be input to the sensors and camera in 
the FPGA from the 10 MHz clock of the CSAC. The trigger 
signals thus generated are synchronized with the 1 PPS of the 
CSAC, which is synchronized with the GPS. 
When performing time synchronization across multiple 
sensor devices, all sensor devices can be set as "master", or 
one sensor device can be set as "master" and the other sensor 
devices can be set as "slaves." When a sensor device is a 
"master," it receives the GPS signal, and inputs the 1 PPS from 
the GPS module to the CSAC to synchronize the GPS with the 
CSAC. If the sensor device is a "slave," the master and slave 
are synchronized by inputting the 1 PPS output from the 
"master." In addition, commands to set the CSAC 
synchronization period or reset the CSAC 1 PPS phase value, 
and a command to select either the GPS or an external input, 
are executed from the signal processing board on the CSAC 
and FPGA via a connector. The 10 MHz and 1 PPS output 
from this board is the clock source for this system. Due to a 
combination of the frequency stability of the GPS and CSAC, 
the synchronization period is set to 1000 seconds so that the 
time can be maintained for a long period even if the GPS is 
interrupted. 
 
C. Sensor board 
Figures 4 and 5 show the configuration and appearance of 
the sensor section. The sensor section comprises a digital 
accelerometer and an external analog sensor input interface. 
The data from the digital accelerometer can be sampled at 1 
kHz at the time of the trigger. The external analog sensor input 
interface has three channels for connecting an analog 
accelerometer for comparison with the digital accelerometer. 
Depending on the purpose of measurement, any analog sensor 
can be connected in addition to the analog acceleration sensor.

The signal input from the external analog sensor interface 
is converted by an A/D converter and output as a 16-bit serial 
value, but by splitting the signal into two channels and 
amplifying one of them 64 times, an A/D converter with 16-
bit resolution can obtain a resolution equivalent to 22-bits. 
Data from the digital accelerometer are output to the FPGA 
via the UART, and data from the sensor connected to the 
external analog sensor input interface are output via a Serial 
Peripheral Interface (SPI).

D. Signal processor 
Figures 6 and 7 show the configuration and appearance of 
the signal processor. For the signal processor, the Raspberry 
Pi 4 shown in Table 1 is used. As shown in Table 1, Ubuntu 
is installed as the CPU OS, an SSD can be used via USB 3.0, 
camera communication is possible via Gigabit Ethernet, and 
an internal Wi-Fi antenna can be connected. Internal data can 
be retrieved and viewed via the LAN (Wi-Fi) using Samba 
functions, and Secure Shell (SSH) can be used to configure 
settings and start measurements. In addition to the above 
functions, the CPU mainly performs time setting, sorting of 
acquired data, format conversion, filing, and processing of 
image data from the camera. 
 
E. Digital accelerometer 
Figure 8 and Table 2 respectively show the appearance and 
specifications of the digital accelerometer mounted on the 
sensor board. The digital MEMS accelerometer mounted on 
the sensor board has a 3-axis crystal acceleration sensor with 
high accuracy and excellent stability, which is micro-
fabricated from a highly accurate and stable crystal material. 
As shown in Table 2, it has low noise and low power 
consumption and is capable of high-resolution vibration 
measurement.

Rolling shutter is a capture method that scans the entire 
frame vertically or horizontally. From the point of view of 
time-synchronized sensing, the biggest drawback of the 
rolling shutter is that it does not capture the same moment. 
Scanning itself is performed at high speed, but there is a time 
difference in the photographed object due to the sequential 
scanning. To overcome this shortcoming, a global shutter 
camera was adopted, which shoots a frame at a time. This 
allows for accurate timestamping of each captured image. 
IV. 
TIME SYNCHRONIZATION PERFORMANCE 
EXPERIMENT OF THE CAMERA SENSOR 
An experiment was conducted to verify the camera 
sensor's time synchronization performance. Figure 10 shows 
the experimental system configuration. A trigger signal 
generated by the oscillator and FPGA section is 
simultaneously sent to the camera sensor and LED control 
FPGA. Since the shutter of the camera sensor is synchronized 
with the lighting state of the LEDs, if images are acquired in 
accordance with the transition in the lighting state, it is 
considered that trigger-synchronized images are being 
acquired. The source of this signal is the CSAC, which is 
synchronized with the trigger signal passed to the sensor 
section, so the sensor and the camera sensor are synchronized.

The FPGA for LED control is configured to control the 
lighting of the LEDs at the time of the trigger signal clock (50 
Hz). With a 5 x 5 LED matrix, the LEDs light from upper left 
to lower right, one by one, in accordance with the rising edge 
of the trigger signal. The camera sensor is fixed to photograph 
the LED matrix. Figure 11 shows the pictures taken by the 
camera sensor. Time elapses in 20 ms increments from upper 
left to lower right. Since the LEDs in the photos light one by 
one, images are acquired according to the signals input to the 
FPGA for LED control. In this figure, the period of 1 
horizontal line of LEDs is 100 ms as the number of LEDs in 
each line is five. Each vertical line in the images is every 100 
ms, and since all the LEDs are lit in the same way, none are 
left out. From these results, it was confirmed that images can 
be continuously acquired in synchronization with the trigger 
from the sensor device. 
 
 
 
Figure 11.  Continuous images from the experimental result. 
 
The performance verification experiment on the time 
synchronization of developed camera sensor device was 
carried out as shown above. It is confirmed that time 
synchronization among the developed digital sensor devices 
with camera is achieved. The development of this digital 
sensing 
platform 
has 
enabled 
time-synchronized 
measurements between digital accelerometers, camera 
sensors, and many types of external input analog sensors, as 
well as multimodal analysis between measurement data. 
V. 
TIME STAMP VERIFICATION EXPERIMENT 
The time stamps added to the images acquired by the 
camera sensor were experimentally verified. Figures 12 and 
13 show the experimental system configuration and GPS 
module, respectively. The camera sensor was used to capture 
images of the LEDs on the GPS module to see whether the 
increase in the number of seconds coincided with the seconds 
of the time stamp. When the power is turned on, the LED of 
TP1 turns off at a timing of 1 PPS of the GPS. The time to turn 
off the LED can be determined with a pulse width of 1 PPS,

which in this case is 100 ms. In other words, the LED is OFF 
for 100 ms and ON for 900 ms every second. Figure 14 shows 
the results obtained every 20 ms. Since the time when the LED 
is OFF is set to 100 ms, the five images from 000 ms to 080 
ms capture the state of the LED when it is OFF, and it can be 
seen that after 100 ms, the LED is ON, indicating that the 
seconds of the time stamp coincide with the OFF state of the 
LED. Figure 15 shows photos after 980 ms. After 980 ms, the 
LED is lit, but after the next 000 ms, it turns off, and after 100 
ms, it is lit again.

From the above results, it was confirmed that 1 PPS of the 
GPS coincides with the seconds of the time stamp. Since the 
camera takes photos every 20 ms, it was thus possible to verify 
that actual phenomena coincided with the images, at least to 
within 20 ms. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, the development of an autonomous sensing 
system that maintains highly precise absolute time 
information by applying a CSAC was reported. First, an 
autonomous time-synchronized sensing system and its circuit 
configuration were described, and a mechanism for adding 
ultra-high-precision absolute time information to sensor data 
by the CSAC, and the development of a sensor device, were 
described in detail. A function to add the same time stamp to 
the output from a camera sensor, the output from an internal 
digital accelerometer and the input from an external analog 
input interface, was implemented. The results of experiments 
to verify the time synchronization performance of the camera 
sensor were also reported. It is planned to verify the time 
synchronization performance of this new sensing system with 
regard to measurement data obtained by the camera sensor, 
the internal digital accelerometer and the external analog input 
sensor.
