Abstract—Competitive enterprise has lots of secret files in 
digital form, which is vulnerable to illegal online activity. Our 
target network accepts authorized users on registered 
machines. In general it is known that the traditional public-key 
scheme is suitable to strong authentication and encryption, but 
it is inferior to the IBE (Identity Based Encryption) scheme in 
terms of performance and certificate management. Thus we 
improve the WP (Weil Pairing) IBE scheme so as to be suitable 
to our SFS (secure file sharing) system with certificate-less key 
revocation as normalizing public identity. In addition, the 
man-in-the-middle attack is negligible because the security is 
based on hard ECDLP (elliptic curve discrete logarithm 
problem). However, in the perspective of performance, our WP 
IBE is bound to the complexity of modular-ADD. In the 
perspective of security, our SFS network is close with single 
authorized server and multiple registered clients. In addition, 
the SFS architecture is fortunately useful in DRM network and 
P2P file sharing network.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In general, corporate secrets are accessible inside a 
restrictive area proofed against exposure in the building. In 
real, secrets such as manufacturing blueprints are confined so 
as to be accessible to only CEO or authorized technicians 
through registered machines in a restrictive area. Such 
network is composed of a single server and multiple clients, 
where confidential files are stored in the server and 
disseminated to the registered clients. Its cryptographical 
scheme must satisfy stronger security constraints than 
traditional schemes. Communication between the server and 
the clients is asymmetric with respect to the cryptographical 
functions and the exchanged messages [12]. Our target 
network called SFS (Secure File Sharing) satisfies these 
properties. 
There are a couple of commercial networks similar to our 
SFS architecture. The first is P2P (Peer-to-Peer) network, 
which is formed with asymmetric connections, where its file 
server knows the client keeping a registered file, and 
redirects a file request to the corresponding client [19]. The 
second is DRM (Digital Right Management) network, which 
consists of single DRM server with copyrighted digital 
materials and multiple purchasers (clients). The DRM server 
must verify both a purchaser and its digital player with so-
called two-factor signature, then package the purchased 
materials using encryption algorithm [22]. In this network, 
the important security issue is authenticity [15]. 
It is desirable to use the public-key scheme for such 
security issue. Nevertheless, we note that the traditional 
public-key scheme is inappropriate in the perspectives of 
performance and certificate management. In 1984, Shamir 
suggested Identity Based Encryption (IBE) scheme to lessen 
a burden of certificate management [1]. The IBE needs no 
more public-key certificate since any string {0,1}* can be a 
public key. In the early stage, it was proposed to use an e-
mail address as a public key. The early IBE, however, might 
expose key material to adversary since the public ID and 
crypto-functions are open without authentication. In order to 
avoid such exposure risk, we combine a public identity and a 
period as normalizing to temporal public key [2]. As the 
result, the normalized public key will be ineffective after its 
valid period, which means the key revocation [15], called as 
certificate-less key revocation. 
We modify the WP (Weil Pairing) IBE scheme for better 
performance and stronger security so as to be appropriate to 
our SFS network, which is characterized as follows: 
① One-to-many: Data transmission between single file 
server and multiple file consumers 
② CS model: Asymmetric communication between the 
file server and consumers (clients). 
③ Closedness: All links of the network formed by 
secure channels. 
④ Strong 
authenticity: 
Adoption of 
multi-factor 
authentication (signature). 
 
In Section II, we review the related work on the IBE 
scheme, the crypto-functions of PKG (Private Key Generator) 
and the complexity of crypto-functions for performance 
analysis. Section III addresses the SFS system architecture 
and its core protocols. Specifically we mention the system 
setup and the client registration. Section IV is concerned 
with how to improve our SFS WP IBE. Section V concludes 
the performance issue, unsolved problems of our works and 
its future.

RELATED WORK 
A. IBE (Identity Based Encryption) scheme 
In the IBE [7], the public key is generated from the 
public identity combined with an unique ID and a time

period which may have an effect on key revocation [1]. 
Boneh and Franklin proposed the WP ECC (elliptic curve 
cryptography) scheme among efficient pairing-based ECC 
[8]. The WP IBE scheme is much more efficient because its 
key size is much shorter and is based on the bilinearity over 
the Field 
Fp
, which is the Group law to replace 
multiplicative Group with additive Group [8]. In spite of the 
shorter key size, the ECC 256-bit public-key provides the 
same level of security as the 3024-bit RSA-based public key 
[2]. 
Nevertheless, security flaw of the WP IBE is relevant to 
the public identity which is literally open to the public 
including adversaries. In addition, it is difficult to hide the 
crypto-functions like encryption, decryption and key 
generation from adversaries. Thus, the WP IBE must be 
based on the random oracle model, which prevents the 
adversary from successful guessing key-related things using 
queries to the oracle with a public identity. In order to have 
the scheme secured against chosen ciphertext attacks (CCA), 
the oracle’s responses to the quesries must satisfy 
onewayness and randomness to hide details of the crypto-
functions [17][20]. 
B. Weil Pairing (WP) ECC 
The WP is one of the implemented ECC schemes, being 
formed with the Group of points over an elliptic curve. Let 
p  be a prime and E  be the elliptic curve of Weiser Strass 
equation

1
G  of which the 
generator is  . Let 
2
G  be the sub-Group of 
Fp2
 of order 
2
q  [6]. 
The WP is based on the bilinear map

between two cyclic Groups

respectively with following properties [6]:

③ Non-degenerate:

The WP satisfies Diffie-Hellman problem (DHP) 
assumption [21]: even if an eavesdropper observed 
x ,
y
g
g  
in the key exchange protocol, the eavesdropper cannot 
compute the secret key 
gxy
 with easy means, while 
legitimate parties can do. Simultaneously, the decisional 
DHP(DDHP) to decide whether 
gxy
comes from 
x
g and 
y
g , 
given 
x ,
y
g
g  and 
gxy
, is hard. But, in the WP, DDHP 
becomes easy with the bilinear map as follows:

It is proved that DHP is equivalent to the hard discrete 
logarithm problem (DLP) to compute a
Log P

 with

 and   [21]. Here, we insist that the WP 
is enough secure to protect secret values because its security 
is based on ECDLP (elliptic curve discrete logarithm 
problem) [21]. 
C. WP IBE crypto-functions 
The IBE scheme is characterized by four randomized 
algorithms: setup(), extract(), encrypt(), decrypt() [2][9], 
defined as follows: 
① 
( )
( ,
)
setup k
 s parm
 
② 
_
(

key extract parm s ID)
 d
 
③ 
(
,
,
encrypt parm ID M)
C
 
④ 
(
, , )
decrypt parm C d
 M
 
Here, 
,
,
k parm s  are the seed value, the security 
parameter like a prime order, and the system wide master 
key 
q
s
 respectively. In addition, 
, ,
ID d M and C  are: 
ID{0,1}*
 acting as a public identity, d  as the 
corresponding private key, 
M {0,1}n
 as a plain message 
and C  as its ciphertext respectively. 
Specifically, the WP IBE scheme produces the security 
parameter parm  summarized as follows:

S
 s
,   is the generator of 
the cyclic Group 
1
G , where s  is the system wide master 
key kept in secret on PKG (Private Key Generator). In 
addition, 
H1
 and 
H2
 are the hash functions with 
onewayness and randomness which scramble the hash 
algorithm so as to behave like a random oracle, defined as 
follows:

D. WP Signature 
The WP authentication process is quite different from 
the traditional public-key scheme. It is much faster since the 
signature is based on the pairing-based additive Group and 
its verification belongs to DDHP, as follows [6][10]:

It was known that the ECC took less time to generate the 
key pair and digital signature than RSA, however, the only 
ECC signature verification is much costly (Table 2) [13][14]. 
In addition, setup() need much time to generate E  points 
over 
Fp
. Supposed that participants already had the

SFS ARCHITECTURE AND PROTOCOL 
A. Architecture 
Our SFS system architecture is shown in Figure 1. 
 
 
Figure 1.  Architecture for Secure File Server with PKG. 
As seen in Figure 1, the SFS architecture is composed of 
the single file server playing the role in PKG and the secret 
file manager, and the multiple clients of which a client 
means a pair of a legal user and a registered machine. A 
secret file can be exchanged only between the file server 
and a client. After completing manipulation of the secret file, 
the machine must eliminate the secret file from the machine, 
and only the file server can store the secret file. 
P2P file sharing system using Gnutella protocol [19] is 
similar to this architecture except that the files stay at the 
clients registered in the network and the server keeps only 
file location information [19]. The architecture for DRM 
system is also similar to Figure 1, except that the clients are 
purchasers and the server is a distributor of copyrighted 
material. 
In our SFS system, the file server is the supplier of a 
secret file and the clients are consumers identified by 
authorized user-ID 
j
U  on registered machine-ID 
i
D . The 
public identity ID  is formed by the ID pair (
,
)
i
D U j
.  
B. Protocol 
The SFS system takes three stages for the lifetime; the 
setup stage is first along with initial registration of all the 
machines and users, the next is the file dissemination stage, 
where transfers an encrypted file with digital signature from 
61

the server to the client against the man-in-the-middle attack.  
The last is the evolution stage for joining and releasing users 
and machines in time. For the lifetime, there is the setup 
stage once initially, and the file dissemination stage and the 
evolution stage are repetitive. 
A secret file is created, and then is registered at the file 
server. The file can be distributed on the SFS network and 
modified  by the owner. This is the lifecycle of a secret file, 
depicted in Figure 2.

Distribution 
In the file distribution, two messages are exchanged 
between the server and the client. One is the request-
message requesting a secret file from the server, and another 
is the file-message conveying the encrypted file to the client. 
Always the sender must authenticate the signature on the 
messages. 
IDclient
 is signed with a temporal private key. 
The sender attaches the signature on the request-message; 
refer to Figure 3.

IMPROVEMENT OF WP IBE 
The reason that our WP scheme is much better than RSA 
or the early ECC is that the WP is based on the Bilinearity. 
The IBE security is relevant to the public identity open to 
the public. We assume the selective-ID security [5] is 
satisfied in SFS, in which the target ID is specified in 
advance before the master public-key is published [11]. 
Improvement of our scheme is threefold: the selective ID 
normalization, the two-factor signature, and the certificate-
less key revocation. 
A. Public ID Normalization 
 
Figure 4. Session Period 
 
In the IBE, public ID is identical for the lifetime and the 
adversary can obtain key pairs to guess the target key 
adaptively. For IBE security, we modify constant IBE 
public ID into temporal ID for certificate-less key 
revocation. The SFS system generates the public key after 
normalizing public identity ID as follows: 
① Client: generating 
  
client
i
j
ID
D
U

 
② PKG: normalizing the public identity ID  as 
time
client
ID
=
client ||
dur
ID

. 
③ PKG: hashing ID  into 
q
a
, as 
(
)
a
 H ID
 
The 
format 
of 
timedur
 is 
denoted 
as 
year:mon:day:hour:min. Wild * in 
timedur
 means an entire 
period of public identity ID .  For instance if 
timedur
is 
year:mon:day:hour:**,  the public identity ID  is invalid at 
the next hour. This ID  is called a temporal client identity, 
denoted as 
time
IDclient
.  
B. Key Generation 
We mentioned that the private key generation is 
triggered by the request-message of a client (Figure 3). The 
key pair is similar to the session key valid for the session 
from the request-message through its file-message (Figure 
4). 
The key generation algorithm of WP ECC is generated 
from the well-known function MapToPoint, as follows 
[3][6][20]:

We modify the MapToPoint algorithm [6] for the key 
generation of the SFS system. In the SFS, the public key is 
denoted as 
QID
 relevant to the client’s public identity ID . 
The private key 
dID
 is generated as 
ID
ID
d
 sQ
. It is 
common that the private key 
dID
 is distributed to the client 
using secure channels like TLS or VPN. Therefore, note that 
there is no difficulty in SFS network since all connections in 
SFS are protected by the IBE based VPN. 
In the performance perspective, the mean number of 
loops is:

 since the probability satisfying the 
Euler Criteria in MapToPoint algorithm is 1/2. Thus the

C. Encryption and Decryption including Authentication 
If the CCA-proof encryption scheme of Canneti, Halevi 
and Katz [11] is considered, the SFS suggests the hybrid 
WP IBE combining the following schemes. The SFS system 
uses two sets of key pairs:

and

. The reason is that 
Encrypt() satisfies both integrity and authenticity as well. 
Let M  and C  be the plain-message and the cipher-
message.

The encryption and decryption satisfy confidentiality, 
integrity, and authenticity as well. However, adversary 
cannot obtain a hint on any relation between C and M  in 
CCA [16] since randomized hash is applied to C  and M .

V. 
PERFORMANCE 
The early ECC is known to be better than RSA in terms 
of key size, signature and encryption. Of course the 
verification is worse than RSA (Table 2) [13][14].

Among ECCs, the WP is known to be more efficient with 
respect to security and performance. Comparing with RSA, 
the ECC key length 163-bit is the same level of security as 
RSA’s 1024-bit [6][13][14]. In Table 2, we know that the 
early ECC is better than RSA, except the verification. The 
early ECC is compared with our SFS WP scheme in Table 3. 
Our improved WP scheme is much better. 
In the security level, therefore, the WP IBE turned out to 
be the better public-key cryptography than the early ECC 
[2].

We note that the signature scheme of our SFS WP is 
similar to the verification one in term of the number of 
operations (Table 3).  In the ECC, it is known that the 
signature takes more time than the encryption in term of the 
running time.  Therefore, we expect that our SFS WP is 
improved in the perspective of performance. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In the future, we will make a real time test-bed to assess 
their performance. We think that the WP is difficult to 
substitute for the conventional public-key scheme in the 
crypto-process structure. The IBE hash function is assumed 
to satisfy both onewayness and randomness, however, it is 
not straightforward to implement such hash function. The 
IBE random oracle model is not practical and the model is 
speculative for security proof. 
As the pairing-based ECC limits keys over the field, it 
surprisingly reduces key computation time. Nevertheless, 
adaptive attacks like IND-ID-CCA [16] are feasible, 
however, the WP neglects such attacks. In future work, we 
will improve the signature and the encryption collaboratively 
in a simple fashion.
