Abstract — Three different electrode structures are compared 
in this work: conventional interdigitated electrodes (IDE), 
serpentine electrodes (SRE) and ring-shaped electrodes (RSE). 
Simulation results and experimental characterization of these 
electrodes showed that ring-shaped electrodes have a slight 
capacitance increase per unit of area, thus being more sensitive 
when used as a capacitive sensor. Furthermore, the ring-
shaped electrodes are more suitable in process that requires 
dripping, for better use of the drop distribution. This is the 
case of liquid substances or sensors with sensitive elements 
such as zeolite. 
Keywords - interdigitated electrodes; ring-shaped electrodes; 
serpentine electrodes; capacitive sensors; electrode structure;

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
IDE as capacitive microstructures have been widely used 
in electronics applications such as surface acoustic wave 
devices [1], thin-ﬁlm acoustic electronic transducers [2], 
tunable devices [3], dielectric spectroscopy [4], dielectric 
studies on thin ﬁlms [5][6], humidity and chemical sensors 
[7][8], etc. They possess interesting features, such as signal 
strength control by changing its dimensions, multiple 
physical effects in the same structure, simplified modeling in 
two dimensions when the aspect ratio of the electrode length 
to the space wavelength IDE is large, and can be used in a 
wide range of frequencies [7]. Moreover, it can be 
manufactured using inert substrates with multiple materials 
with different fabrication processes, or even microfluidic 
compatible. Capacitive microstructures used as chemical 
sensor, typically have one sensitive layer deposited over the 
electrodes. Polymers have been used for organic vapor 
sensing because they exhibit rapid reversible vapor sorption 
and are easy to apply as thin or thick ﬁlms by a variety of 
techniques [9]. The polymer layer can be chosen according 
to its afﬁnity to a particular molecule or set of molecules one 
wishes to detect. If several sensors with different polymer 
layers are used to make a sensor array it is then possible to 
evaluate complex organic vapor samples. These sensor 
arrays can be part of a so-called electronic nose. Another 
possibility is the use of flexible substrates such as sensing 
element. As an example the use of polyimide [10] and plastic 
foil [11]. 
Interdigitated electrodes analytical characterization have 
been received many efforts in order to improve their 
capacitance by exploring their geometrical parameters. Igreja 
et al developed a theoretical model of capacitance for this 
structure [12]. These capacitors have also been simulated 
using different tools. They have typically been adopted as a 
sensor because of the low-power consumption of capacitive 
transduction mechanism and being compact with a large 
contact area and relative ease of manufacture. Some authors 
have analyzed other morphologies such as serpentine, spiral 
and concentric rings electrodes, in order to improve design 
performance. 
Moreover, 
aside 
from 
the 
different 
morfologies, several strategies have been employed to 
increase and improve its ability as a sensor, for example the 
deposition of a more sensitive layer on the electrodes. The 
sensor can also have its selectivity improved by the 
deposition of compounds such as zeolite for detection of air 
humidity or gases [13].  
In this work, we study different geometries of electrodes 
instead of the materials used to maximize capacitance per 
area. We can thus improve the sensitivity of capacitive 
sensors by increasing the total capacitance of capacitive 
microstructures. Here, we compare the conventional IDE, the 
serpentine electrodes (SRE) and ring-shaped electrodes 
(RSE). These electrodes are compared in detail as generic 
capacitive transducers by numerical simulations. In these 
simulations, the geometric parameters that most influence on 
the total capacitance are shown. We measure the capacitance 
of these thin-film electrodes made of titanium and gold on a 
glass substrate. Finally, we compare the experimental results 
with the theoretical analysis, including simulations. 
In Section II, the different electrodes designs and their 
geometrical parameters are shown. They are the main data to 
the numerical simulation, which is explained in the Section 
III. The fabrication process is described in section IV. 
Subsequently, the values of electrical and geometrical 
characterization are shown in section V. The results are 
compared and discussed in section VI. Finally, the 
conclusion is presented in section VII. 
II. 
METHODS AND MATERIALS 
The layouts of some interdigitated electrode pairs are 
shown in Figure 1. Although they were designed with the 
same area, each structure has a particular capacitance. 
Therefore, they have different sensitivities as capacitive 
transducer only because of their different geometric 
structure.

We simulate the capacitive structures of IDE, SRE and 
RSE with the same area, same substrate and the same top 
layer, calculating and comparing the capacitance of each 
structure using the multiphysics numerical simulator: 
COMSOL Multiphysics (Comsol Inc., Stockholm, Sweden). 
This software, based on partial differential equations with the 
finite element method has been used in the literature to 
calculate distribution of potential field in similar structures. 
Figure 2 depicts the simulated structure showing the 3D 
multislice view of the electrical potential distribution around 
RSE with 20 fingers. 
Multiple simulations were performed to compare 
dimensions that are relevant to increase the difference 
between the capacitances. The main geometrical parameters 
analyzed are the electrode length, the gap between the 
electrodes, the electrode width (always kept as same value as 
gap), the thickness of electrodes and the number of fingers. 
The electrical properties of the substrate and the top layer are 
also included in the simulator. Because of the differences 
between the vertical and horizontal dimensions (millimeters 
to micrometers) critical to reduce the time simulation, we 
have applied the extrapolation method, presented in the 
Rivadeneyra work [14]. The thickness has been set to 20% of 
electrode width. 
III. 
NUMERICAL SIMULATION 
We have performed different numerical simulations 
comparing the calculated DC capacitance of IDE, SRE and 
RSE structures always with the same distance between 
digits, surface area and same materials and manufacturing 
process. There are multiple geometrical factors that can be 
varied in the simulations, but for the sake of clarity, we focus 
on some of them, keeping fixed the rest. Since the goal is 
maintaining reduced the surface area of electrodes, we define 
different widths and distances between digits of the 
structures given that the lowest safe distance to our 
manufacturing process is 10µm. Therefore, we have used the 
number, length and width of fingers and the thickness of the 
deposited metal film as simulation parameters. Table 1 is a 
summary of these geometric parameters used for simulation. 
Remember that fabricated structures for each type of 
electrode, SRE, IDE and RSE, was made with three 
distances between digits (10µm, 20µm and 50µm) but the 
number of electrodes and the thickness of the metal thin film 
was kept constant.

The first important result was that the capacitance to RSE 
was the highest in all comparisons. For example, simulating 
the capacitor with w = 10µm, t = 2µm and 20 electrodes we 
obtain 2.47pF for RSE while the capacitance for the SRE 
was 2.45pF and the capacitance for IDE was 2.44pF. This 
means an increase of capacitance of 30fF between the RSE 
and the IDE. Whereas electrodes are used as capacitive 
transducers, the fact of the geometrical factor RSE be higher 
than in other structures means that the sensitivity of the 
sensor will always be larger using the same area. 
Furthermore, the capacitance and the increase in sensitivity 
will increase proportionally. After that, we calculate the 
numerical capacitances in order to improve the performance 
of RSE. 
Influence of the width of the electrodes (10 to 50μm) 
with aspect ratio of the electrode/thickness of the thin film of 
5/1 was evaluated for the RSE, SRE and IDE with 20 digits. 
The results showed a slope of 161.1fF for each micrometer 
added to the width of the electrodes to the RSE, a slope of 
160.7fF/µm for the SRE and 159.3fF/µm for the IDE. 
Remembering that the surface area of each structure was 
kept the same for each electrode width. 
Electrode length contribution (400 to 800µm) was been 
evaluated for IDE and SRE electrode with 20 fingers and 
10µm of finger width. Results showed the slope of 
4.99fF/µm for the SRE and 4.74fF for the IDE. 
We also have performed the contribution of finger 
numbers (n) in each structure. The results are presented in 
Figure 4, as this contribution is nonlinear. 
IV. 
FABRICATION PROCESS 
The electrodes fabrication started with the production of 
the electrode masks where the IDE, SRE and RSE were 
designed 
using 
high-resolution 
direct 
writing 
photolithography with a laser beam. In the next step, a 
photoresist layer was deposited onto a square optical glass 
plate (60mm side Kodak 1A High Resolution Glass) and 
patterned 
by 
conventional 
ultraviolet 
light 
(UV) 
photolithographic method following the electrodes masks. 
The UV exposures were carried out in a MJB-3 UV300 
contact mask aligner (Karl-Suss, Garching, Germany). 
Titanium-gold (TiAu) thin ﬁlms, deposited with a Leybold 
Univex 300 ebeam evaporator (Cologne, Germany), were 
used as electrode materials. After thin-ﬁlm depositions, by 
the lift-off technic, the devices were immersed in acetone to 
remove the photoresist layer and excess of metal, leaving the 
patterned electrodes on the glass surface [6]. 
V. 
CHARACTERIZATION 
For the experimental characterization the nominal 
capacitance target was 2pF, taking into account the minimum 
distance between electrodes of 10µm. Structures with 
electrode width of 50µm have a total area of 28.26mm², and 
their dimensions are g = 50µm, l = 5.95mm, d = 4.75mm and 
r = 3.02mm. The area is 4.52mm² for structures with w = 
20µm, g = 20µm, l = 2.38mm, d = 1.90mm and r = 1.21mm. 
Structures with w = 10µm, minimum secure dimension to 
our fabrication process, the area is 1.13mm² (g = 10µm, l = 
1.19mm, d = 0. 95mm and r = 0.60mm). 
The geometric inspection of the fabricated structures was 
performed using the Olympus BX60 microscope as shown in 
Figure 3. Electrical characterization has been carried out by 
measuring their capacitance and parallel resistance using the 
four-wire measurement with a HP 4284A impedance 
analyzer (Agilent Tech., Santa Clara, CA, USA). The applied 
excitation voltage was VAC = 1V and VDC = 0V. The 
frequency sweep of analysis was from 100Hz to 1MHz. The 
four-point method was used to minimize the contribution of 
stray capacitances.

VI. 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
Measured and the simulated values of the capacitances 
are in agreement, as shown in Table 2. The measurements 
were carried out in room conditions (50% RH and 25ºC) at 
100 kHz. 
TABLE II.  
NUMERICAL VS. EXPERIMENTAL CAPACITANCE. 
  
Capacitance measured values have a maximum of 12% 
discrepancy compared to the simulated results. This 
difference is due to the capacitance of contacts pads that 
were not included in the simulation and the variability of the 
fabrication process. 
VII. CONCLUSION 
A comparison between the capacitances under different 
geometric parameters of RSE, SRE and the conventional 
IDE was shown on this work. Numerical simulations of the 
capacitance have been carried out to calculate the differences 
between them due exclusively to their geometrical 
characteristics at constant area. In these conditions, we have 
shown a slight capacitance increase for the ring-shaped 
electrodes against the serpentine electrodes and the 
conventional interdigitated electrodes. 
We have validated the numerical results by experimental 
characterization of ring-shaped, serpentine and interdigitated 
structures capacitance. Experimental results verified the 
capacitive differences between the three structures with same 
area, for 10µm, 20µm and 50µm of finger width. Moreover, 
ring-shape electrode presents a geometrical morphology that 
allows the better usage of its area. It is a promising base 
electrode mainly when used as sensor in application that 
involves dripping of substances under analysis or dripping of 
selective/sensitive substances like zeolite.
