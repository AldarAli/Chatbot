Abstract—Single-Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access 
(SC-FDMA)  is a well suited waveform for satellite link thanks 
to its low Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) level, compared 
to Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA). 
Moreover, it allows a frequency access which is very attractive 
given the growing interest in integrated satellite-terrestrial 
system and dynamic use of the spectrum. The purpose of this 
article is to prove that doing frequency holes to enable the 
dynamic use of the spectrum don’t degrade so much waveform 
envelope fluctuations while enabling efficient transmission.  
 
Keywords— shared spectrum; integrated satellite terrestrial 
system; OFDM; SC-FDMA; (EW)-SC-FDMA; satellite payload 
impairments; carrier to intermodulation ratio.

INTRODUCTION 
For spectral resource optimization in a dynamic spectral 
resource sharing context, a waveform which seems to be 
promising for the satellite is the Single-Carrier Frequency 
Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA). Its interest has 
already been demonstrated in the Digital Video Broadcasting 
(DVB) - Next Generation broadcasting system to Handheld 
(NGH) [1] standardization process in an S-band mobile 
system. This waveform is also recommended in an 
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) working group 
[5] for satellite International Mobile Telecommunications-
Advanced (IMT-advanced) systems. More recently, interest of 
this waveform raised in European Telecommunications 
Standards Institute - Satellite Communication and Navigation 
(ETSI-SCN) and DVB - Second Generation Satellite 
Extensions (S2x) standardization process applicable to higher 
frequency bands (Ku, Ka).  
Besides, the 5G Infrastructure Public-Private Partnership 
(5G PPP) consortium [6] targets for new systems a dynamic 
sharing of existing frequency bands (Cognitive Radio) and the 
emergence 
of 
integrated 
satellite 
terrestrial 
systems. 
Integration of satellite will allow delivering 5G services in 
areas of low population density and to ensure communications 
everywhere  in case of a disaster. 
Multi-carrier waveform is not the historical waveform 
used on satellites. But, as European Union is promoting 
through incoming 5G the integration of satellite and terrestrial 
components [6], paradigm is currently being modified. 
Indeed, to make easier spectrum scalability, satellite should be 
able to choose sub-bands it uses depending on existing 
terrestrial systems. Moreover, in the case of integrated 
systems specifically, to encourage mass market terminal 
deployment, terminal should be able to receive the satellite 
signal or terrestrial one with the same chipset. This 
emphasizes the need for satellite to use a multi-carrier 
granular access, as it is already the case in terrestrial systems. 
If Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) 
first appears as obvious solution, it should be mentioned that 
this waveform has a high crest factor, which does not allow 
optimizing the efficiency of satellite amplifiers. An 
intermediate solution is the use of SC-FDMA, keeping the 
granular access in frequency, but severely limiting the 
envelope fluctuations, it becomes even more attractive to the 
satellite. This is why this waveform has been chosen here to 
address this problem.  
One example of such integrated system (the spectrum of 
the terrestrial and satellite components is managed by the 
same company) is given hereafter. It provides a service to 
nomadic or mobile devices. To optimize the spectrum use 
according to the traffic, the scheduler decides if a part of the 
band is allocated to either satellite component or terrestrial 
one, as it is depicted in Figure 1. 
 
In section II, description of the waveform enabling 
frequency holes is done. In section III, satellite payload 
impairments are discussed and then in section IV, 
methodology used to analyze results obtained is introduced.  
Finally, in section V, simulations results are presented, 
comparing OFDMA, SC-FDMA and Extended-and-Weighted 
SC-FDMA (EW-SC-FDMA) performances over non-linear 
channel, and considering frequency holes.

SC-FDMA WAVEFORM MODELIZATION WITH 
FREQUENCY HOLES 
A. Basic SC-FDMA modeling 
Because there have been several studies on SC-FDMA 
waveform [3][4], modeling will not be strictly detailed. 
However, differences with OFDMA transceiver architecture 
will be emphasized. General SC-FDMA transceiver is 
summarized in Figure 3, and is described hereafter. 
 
Firstly, interleaved and coded bits bn are mapped into 
symbols ci, i ∈ [0… 𝑀 − 1]. Spreading operation, specific to 
SC-FDMA transmission, is then done by applying an M–
Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to the ci symbols to get Ck 
symbols, k ∈ [−

Figure 1.  Example of integrated system managing efficiently its spectrum. 
In case of Extended-and-Weighted SC-FDMA (EW-SC-
FDMA), as it can be seen in Figure 2, some of the edge Ck 
symbols are duplicated and put at the opposite side edge in the 
guard band. Main sizing parameter here is α, called the roll off 
factor. Extension process outputs M’, equals to (1+α)M, 
complex symbols Ck’. Weighting process is finally applied 
over these subcarriers in order to have a square root raised 
cosine shaping [3]. It multiplies term by term HSRC(k’) with 
Ck’ to get Sk’. Note that HSRC(k’), 𝑘′ ∈ [−

frequency response of the square root raised cosine filter, 
given by:

Figure 3.  SC-FDMA transceiver architecture 
It can be pointed out that when α equals to 0, process is 
strictly equivalent to SC-FDMA process. Next, unused 
subcarriers in the guard band are filled by zero, exactly N - 
(1+α)M, to get a vector owning N complex symbols, Sk’’. 
Note that to be compliant with OFDMA process, N should be 
a power of 2, that is not the case for M. Lastly, OFDMA 
modulation process can be done by applying a N-Inverse Fast 
Fourier Transform (IFFT) and inserting guard interval, 
getting baseband signal sn.  
For receiver considerations, the equalization should use a 
Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) frequency domain 
algorithm 
[3][4], 
working 
subcarrier 
by 
subcarrier. 
Furthermore, a slightly difference which can be observed 
with SC-FDMA receiver compared to OFDMA one, is the 
way to compute the Log Likelihood Ratio (LLR) metrics at 
the demapping symbols step. Classic LLR formulation is 
reminded here:

SC-FDMA receiver, because of the despreading process, i.e., 
there is a M points Inverse-DFT between equalization and

B. Frequency holes insertion 
Frequency holes are inserted inside useful signal at the 
spreading process level. In fact, spreading applies a L<M 
DFT over the incoming ci symbols before filling M-L other 
symbols with zero, as it is drawn in Figure 4.  
Some vocabulary is necessary to define where frequency 
hole is located. β is defined as the relative bandwidth 
occupied by frequency holes over maximum achievable 
useful bandwidth: 
 
                                   β = 
𝑀−𝐿
𝑀 .                                      (5) 
 
Δ is the relative shift of the frequency hole center relatively to 
the bandwidth center. To clarify these notations, an example 
is given in Figure 5. 
C. Interference model 
The interferer location is defined as it is done for the 
frequency holes, with β and Δ parameters. Generative model 
is quite simple: complex symbols are generated according to a 
normal law   𝒩(0; 𝛽), supposing power of the useful signal as 
unitary power when occupying all possible subcarriers. 
Interference symbols are applied to subcarriers as if it was an 
OFDMA signal. When frequency holes are defined, 
interference is added exactly at the hole location.

SATELLITE PAYLOAD IMPAIRMENTS 
In the literature, satellite payload impairments models 
usually include three main origins: nonlinear amplifier, 
selective input filters and phase noise [2]. For the current 
work, it is assumed that only non-linearity effects are 
considered. Phase noise is not considered because it is well 
known that effect is very weak over a Quadrature Phase Shift 
Keying (QPSK) modulation combined with current stability 
specifications over satellite local oscillators. Input filters 
distortion may have an effect over the performances, but as 
the three studied waveforms (OFDMA, SC-FDMA, EW-SC-
FDMA) have a subcarrier equalization process, it can be 
predicted that the effect would be quite closed to each other, 
while not negligible. This is the reason why it was decided to 
focus on non-linearity effects only, knowing there are 
envelope fluctuations differences between waveforms. A 
typical un-linearized model is chosen, giving Output Back Off 
(OBO)  [dB] as a function of Input Back Off (IBO)  [dB], and 
giving phase slope Kp [degrees/dB] as a function of IBO: 
                        OBO = √𝑈 − √𝑈 + 𝑉. 𝐼𝐵𝑂²,                    (6)

Note that the output of the satellite non-linear block 
delivers unitary power. 
IV. 
COMPARATIVE METHOD ANALYSIS 
We are about to compare different waveforms enabling 
creation of a frequency hole inside their spectrum. Here is 
proposed a method to compare waveforms, considering power 
loss, signal quality loss, and Carrier over Intermodulation 
ratio. Power loss is corresponding to OBO value, and signal 
quality loss equals to the performance gap considering non-
linearity sub-block or not. Total loss metric is then defined as: 
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 = 𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑎𝑙  𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 + 𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 
{
𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 = |𝑂𝐵𝑂|
𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑎𝑙  𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 =
𝐶′+𝐼𝑚
𝑁
𝐵𝐸𝑅=10−5 − 
𝐶
𝑁𝐵𝐸𝑅=10−5 ,     (10) 
Where 
C
NBER=10−5  is the required signal to noise ratio in dB 
with ideal amplifier response at bit error rate (BER) 10-5, and 
C′+Im
N
BER=10−5 is the required amplified signal power (pure 
signal plus intermodulated part) to noise ratio in dB at bit 
error rate 10-5. Both metrics are given at the receiver input 
location. Assuming that Im has a Gaussian behavior, pure 
Signal over Intermodulation power ratio (C′
Im ) can be derived 
(linear form): 
(𝐶′
𝐼𝑚 ) =
1+(𝐶′+𝐼𝑚
𝑁
)
𝐵𝐸𝑅=10−5
(𝐶
𝑁)
𝐵𝐸𝑅=10−5
−1
∗(𝐶′+𝐼𝑚
𝑁
)
𝐵𝐸𝑅=10−5
−1
−1
.                (11) 
 
Signal over Intermodulation power ratio is also an 
important criterion according to satellite operators, because it 
demonstrates the ability of the payload to work with any 
spectral efficiency. As a result, performances of the 
waveforms will be compared at equal (C′
Im) ratio. It shall be 
pointed out that for a same spectral efficiency,  (C′
Im )  is 
directly linked to signal quality loss considering (10) and (11). 
Thus, judicious representation may be, for each waveform, 
required |OBO| to get BER = 10-5 vs  (C′
Im) representation. 
V. 
SIMULATIONS 
A. Parameters and simulation chain 
Simulations are performed by using a DVB-NGH like 
transceiver chain [1]. DVB-NGH specifications enable SC-
FDMA 
utilization 
without 
extension 
and 
weighting 
functionality. Besides, frequency hole, interferences and on-
board nonlinear amplifier had to be considered as it is 
depicted in Figure 8. A significant importance should be given 
to the way signal over noise ratios are computed when dealing 
with frequency holes. As power at output of the amplifier is 
unitary in simulations, it was chosen to get noise power 
considering the maximum achievable band for useful signal, 
independently from the frequency hole width. This choice 
may appear unsuitable for conventional multi-carrier receiver, 
which may be able to ignore the subcarriers carrying only 
noise. However, for results comparison, it enables to avoid 
any surboosting effect because of both frequency holes and 
unitary power: waveforms are compared at same ES/N0.  
Lastly, simulation parameters are summarized in Tab. I. 
B. Enveloppe fluctuations 
Because dealing with non-linearity effects, the study of 
envelope fluctuations for each waveform may help to 
understand further results. This is why complementary 
cumulated distribution function for instantaneous power is 
given for each studied waveform in Figure 9.

Figure 9.   Comparison of waveforms power fluctuation 
As it can be found in literature, SC-FDMA waveform 
performs better than OFDMA one. Using extension can help 
to better decrease fluctuations, but in this paper 5% roll off 
factor was chosen, that explains the small difference with 
SC-FDMA. However, one shall note that this comparison is 
considering waveforms without frequency holes insertion. 
C. Results without frequency holes 
As a reference, BER simulations have been performed 
according to the method described in chapter IV. For a wide 
range of C/Im, it appears in Figure 10 that SC-FDMA like 
waveforms outperform OFDMA, gap increasing when C/Im is 
growing. These results emphasize the fact that when no 
interferer is present, SC-FDMA is a good choice to be 
compatible from terrestrial multi-carrier legacy and to enjoy 
efficient use of the satellite payloads.

and without interference 
D. Results with frequency holes 
Here, frequency hole was inserted with Δ=0 and β=33% 
parameters. Especially for single carrier waveforms, inserting 
a such wide hole inside useful bandwidth may modify its 
fluctuations behavior. But, as it is depicted in Figure 11, 
single carrier waveforms performances are not so much 
degraded by the hole insertion, and remain quite competitive 
compared to OFDMA, despite the large width of the hole. 
 
E. Results with interferences 
Interferences are inserted with Δ=0 and β=33% 
parameter. I0, the power spectrum density of interferer is the 
same as C0, the power spectrum density of the signal. That 
leads to relatively weak level of interferers but with quite 
large bandwidth (1/3 of achievable useful bandwidth). With 
no real surprise, it is first checked that inserting hole in any 
of the three waveforms results in a negligible degradation 
(see it in Figures 12, 13, and 14), because only secondary 
lobes of active useful subcarriers capture interferences when 
frequency hole is inserted.

and without interference

Besides, no creating hole when interferer is present is 
showing quite degraded results, even if the interferer has a 
weak level. Reader shall point out that weak interferer was 
chosen to visualize the degradation on the same curve. But, 
from a system point of view, power spectrum density of a 
terrestrial interferer would be greater than satellite useful 
signal one, and would emphasize the need for such frequency 
hole in the waveform. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
At a time where, on one hand, historical satellite chipset 
manufacturers are working to enlarge their modulated 
carriers bandwidths to maximize the payload efficiency, and 
on the other hand there is a need to make easier spectrum 
scalability, a SC-FDMA based solution was introduced to 
address this issue. In this paper, it has been shown that SC-
FDMA waveform fluctuations enable using payload in an 
efficient way, and that creating frequency hole do not 
degrade 
so 
much 
envelope 
fluctuations; 
SC-FDMA 
waveform remains in all cases relevant compared to 
OFDMA. Thus, using this waveform would take advantage 
of both frequency scalability and payload efficiency, while 
offering a solution at physical layer level for dynamic 
spectral resource sharing systems.  
For further work, a study case with several powers and 
bandwidths for the interferer should be done to better 
demonstrate the need for inserting frequency hole. Moreover, 
total achievable bit rate should be considered: by using the 
spectrum compression effect when creating frequency hole, 
spectral efficiency could be improved and may balance the 
lack of spectrum.
