Abstract—Cloud Computing did come up with so many 
attractive 
advantages 
such 
as 
scalability, 
flexibility, 
accessibility, rapid application deployment, user self-service 
and mainly cost effectiveness. However, security issues and 
lack of governance let users hesitating before deciding. In the 
other side, with the advent of many means of payment, other 
than coins and banknotes, the security is also the big issue. 
Many tools has been developed to help Card Industry 
stakeholder to develop their products with minimal concern, 
like Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. In fact, 
the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard is a 
standard that aims to harmonize and strengthen the protection 
of Card Data in the whole lifecycle. Since its introduction, it 
has always been an efficient tool for controlling Card data on a 
platform deployed internally. In addition, it has been proved 
that this standard is among the best one for gauging data 
security, because it dictates a series of scrupulous controls and 
how they could be implemented. However, with the coming of 
the Cloud, the strategies have changed and the issues in 
protecting Card data become more complex. In this paper, we 
work on developing a checklist that will be a reference for the 
Cloud tenant to control the security of Card data and 
information on the Cloud Computing. Also, we will evaluate 
our result by applying our checklist on a real Cloud 
environment. In next steps, we will focus on evaluating Risk 
Management of deployed Card Transaction Platform on a 
Public Cloud and all the strategies to reduce impacts of all 
potential risks.

 INTRODUCTION 
As the competition puts pressure on companies to 
increase productivity and decrease capital investments, 
solutions like distributed computing, that offer scalable 
systems with low fees, are attractive options for management 
to take in consideration. However, when you are responsible 
for the security of the access and the network, the idea of 
migrating everything to an environment that is not controlled 
and even owned, probably makes the decision more difficult. 
Therefore, many banks and card transactions companies, 
which are attracted to outsourcing card solution outside their 
premises, encounter several obstacles, mainly related to 
security and data governance. The client has the 
responsibility to know where its data are and where it is 
going. This concept is the basis to data security, developed in 
[1], and plays a significant role in achieving and maintaining 
compliance with security norms, mainly the PCI-DSS [2].  
Unfortunately, most of the requirements focus on the 
merchant’s ability to implement network access controls, 
data control, and insuring that the applications installed 
respect the security norms by periodically test their 
effectiveness. In addition, it may be difficult to do it and 
insufficient in a Cloud platform, where the infrastructure is 
outsourced [3]. 
In this paper, we will expose our complete work by  
developing our methodology to get an exhaustive tool for 
auditing that will be an efficient tool for banks and Card 
companies to control if the Cloud platform is ready to 
receive Card solutions or not. Also, we illustrate our work by 
a real use case. We based our contribution on two mains 
frameworks: Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) [4] developed by 
Cloud Computing Alliance (CSA) and PCI-DSS. 
In the next section, we illustrate some basic aspects of the 
Cloud Computing and the Card Payment Industry. In Section 
III, we explain the main advantages of the CCM [4] and its 
domains. Section IV explains the choices of domains on 
what we focus on. Section V details the matrix developed 
and the correspondent checklist for client that allow them to 
verify the effectiveness of the platform outsourced (we give 
an extract of the checklist in Table IV). Section V brings a 
critical view to PCI-DSS standard insufficiency in Cloud 
computing. A use case is illustrated in Section VII. And 
finally, we draw a conclusion in Section VIII. 
II. 
BACKGROUND 
As mentioned before, in this section we explain the 
basics aspects; Cloud Computing, The Payment Industry, the 
CSA and the PCI-DSS.  
A. Cloud Computing: the new opportunity 
Cloud Computing means outsourcing your data and its 
processing on remote servers, which eliminates the need to 
store these on premises. The interest is to access that data 
from any Internet-connected computer and synchronization 
across multiple devices.  
36

The benefits are many; including a gain of space, 
resources, time and money. The user can freely access 
documents without worrying about the machine he uses. 
Cloud computing is, essentially, an economic commercial 
offer subscription to external services. 
However, to adopt the Cloud, the customer should 
manage security issues, including legal and contractual 
aspects. Indeed, the advent of cloud computing brings new 
solutions to significant improvement in security. The data are 
stored in the cloud and should be always accessible no matter 
what happens to all access devices (laptop, Tablet, 
Smartphone, etc.). 
B. Payment Card Industry: The evolution 
Electronic payment means all electronic flows of 
information and treatment needed to manage credit cards and 
associated transactions. Electronic money transfers have 
been conducted by banks since the 1960's and bank 
customers have been able to draw cash from ATM's since the 
1970's (NCR, Diebold, Wincor, etc.). 
Historically, the first credit Cards, were existed before 
1970, and were equipped with only "Embossing" (i.e., 
customer data printed in relief on the physical media). 
Information is the number of the card (backed by a bank 
account), the name and surname of the owner, date of expiry, 
etc. 
In the mid-90s, electronic banking has evolved to include 
a new fully electronic channel and e-Commerce, which is 
buying and selling of products or services via the web, 
Internet or other computer networks while M-commerce (or 
mobile commerce) is the buying of products or services via a 
device like Smartphone, PDA, etc. 
1) The stakeholders involved with payment card 
transactions: 
 
Card holder: a person holding a payment card (the 
consumer in B2C). 
 
Merchant: the business organization selling the 
goods and services (The merchant sets up a contract 
known as a merchant account with an acquirer). 
 
Service provider: this could be the merchant itself 
(Merchant 
service 
provider 
(MSP)) 
or 
an 
independent sales organization providing some or all 
of the payment services for the merchant. 
 
Acquirer or acquiring bank: this connects to a card 
brand network for payment processing and also has a 
contract for payment services with a merchant. 
 
Issuing bank: this entity issues the payment cards to 
the payment card holders. 
 
Card brand: this is a payment system (called 
association network) with its own processors and 
acquirers (such as Visa, MasterCard or CMI card in 
Morocco). 
In Figure 1, we illustrate the relation between the 
stakeholders in Card Payment. 
 
Figure 1.  Payment card stakeholders 
2) Payment cards flowchart: 
Basically payment cards work using two components 
(Figure 2). The first one, the 'transaction authorization', is 
where a message containing the transaction details is sent to 
the card issuer requesting authorization for the payment. The 
card issuer then authorizes the payment. This guarantees 
payment to the merchant. 
The second component known as 'clearing' is where the 
merchant submits the authorized transaction for payment 
(automatically or manually; daily or periodically) to Service 
Provider. The transaction then appears in the card holder's 
statement.

However, in e-commerce/m-commerce, the payment 
methods are slightly different.  
3) The e-commerce/m-commerce system model 
Generally, most e-commerce/m-commerce systems can 
be designed as a three tier model. The three component parts 
are the client side, the service system and the back end 
37

system. These two last components are commonly known as 
‘Server Side’. 
The client side connects users to the Server Side, which 
deals the users’ requests. From a business perspective the 
client side provides the customer interface, the service 
system provides the business logic and the back-end 
provides the required data to complete a transaction to its 
fate. 
E-commerce/m-commerce system vulnerabilities 
The transaction process highlights the requirement for 
communication between the users, merchant, card issuer and 
may be the service provider. These communications must be 
protected to ensure confidentiality and integrity of the 
transaction details. This will prevent spying and data 
manipulation of the transaction details. 
By understanding the e-commerce/m-commerce system 
architecture it becomes apparent that the payment card data 
will be vulnerable if someone having obtained the payment 
card information details or can access the component parts of 
the server side system. Additionally, the communications 
between the component parts of the server side must be 
protected to ensure confidentiality and integrity of the 
transaction details. 
C. The CSA: Cloud Security Alliance 
The Cloud Security Alliance is a not-for-profit 
organization with a mission to promote the use of best 
practices for providing security assurance within Cloud 
Computing, and to provide education on the uses of Cloud 
Computing to help secure all other forms of computing. It is 
led by a broad coalition of industry practitioners, 
corporations, associations and other key stakeholders. 
The Cloud Security Alliance has designed many tools to 
manage control and governance on Cloud. Its main tool is 
Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM), which aims to provide 
fundamental security principles to guide cloud vendors and 
to assist prospective cloud customers in assessing the overall 
security risk of a cloud provider. 
Cloud Control Matrix: a reliable tool to assess security 
risk of Cloud environment 
The Cloud Security Alliance’s Cloud Controls Matrix is 
a rich source of cloud security best practices designed as a 
framework to provide fundamental security principles to 
cloud vendors and cloud customers. It provides a controls 
framework that gives detailed understanding of security 
concepts and principles that are aligned to the Cloud Security 
Alliance guidance in 16 domains (latest version 3.0.1): 
1. Application & Interface Security 
2. Audit Assurance & Compliance 
3. Business Continuity Management & Operational 
Resilience 
4. Change Control & Configuration Management 
5. Data Security & Information Lifecycle Management 
6. Datacenter Security 
7. Encryption & Key Management 
8. Governance and Risk Management 
9. Human Resources 
10. Identity & Access Management 
11. Infrastructure & Virtualization Security 
12. Interoperability & Portability 
13. Mobile Security 
14. Security Incident Management, E-Discovery & Cloud 
Forensics 
15. Supply 
Chain 
Management, 
Transparency 
and 
Accountability 
16. Threat and Vulnerability Management 
 
The CCM serves as the basis for new industry standards 
and certifications. It is the first ever baseline control 
framework specifically designed for managing risk in the 
Cloud Supply Chain: 
 
Addressing the inter- and intra-organizational 
challenges of persistent information security by 
clearly delineating control ownership. 
 
Providing an anchor point and common language for 
balanced measurement of security and compliance 
postures. 
 
Providing the holistic adherence to the vast and ever 
evolving 
landscape 
of 
global 
data 
privacy 
regulations and security standards. 
The foundations of the Cloud Security Alliance Controls 
Matrix rest on its customized relationship to other industry-
accepted security standards, regulations, and controls 
frameworks such as the ISO 27001/27002, ISACA COBIT, 
PCI, NIST, Jericho Forum and NERC CIP and will provide 
internal control direction for service organization control 
reports attestations provided by cloud providers. As a 
framework, the CSA CCM provides organizations with the 
needed structure, detail and clarity relating to information 
security tailored to the cloud industry. The CSA CCM 
strengthens 
existing 
information 
security 
control 
environments by emphasizing business information security 
control requirements, reduces and identifies consistent 
security threats and vulnerabilities in the cloud, provides 
standardized security and operational risk management, and 
seeks to normalize security expectations, cloud taxonomy 
and terminology, and security measures implemented in the 
cloud. 
PCI DSS [6]: is an industry wide set of requirements that 
affects any company or organization that accepts, processes, 
transmits or stores card details or any sensitive data linked to 
the payment card. It aims to encourage merchants and 
service providers to protect payment card data. This 
ultimately leads to the reduction of fraud losses for banks, 
merchants and card brands. 
ISO 
27001/27002 
[7]: 
are 
the 
best 
practice 
recommendations on information security management, risks 
and controls within the context of an overall information 
security management system (ISMS), published jointly by 
the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and 
the International Electro-technical Commission (IEC). While 
ISO27017 and ISO27018 are respectively for Information 
security management for cloud systems and Data protection 
for cloud systems are as draft now, the main framework still 
now ISO 27001/27002. 
ISO 27001 is an internationally accepted standard 
framework for an information security management system 
that includes control requirements in 11 domains. Those that 
38

do implement ISO 27001 may further choose to have their 
compliance independently audited to obtain ISO 27001 
certification. 
ISACA COBIT [8]: is a framework created by ISACA 
for information technology (IT) management and IT 
governance. It is a supporting toolset that allows managers to 
bridge the gap between control requirements, technical issues 
and business risks. It aims to research, develop, publish and 
promote an authoritative, up-to-date, international set of 
generally accepted information technology control objectives 
for day-to-day use by business managers, IT professionals 
and assurance professionals. The benefits that frameworks 
such as COBIT offer is that they produce a summary 
assessment of the business risks and achieved business value 
of an application, and they can help practitioners evaluate 
(often to a highly granular degree) many security or value 
issues. 
NIST [9]: The National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) has been designated by the Federal 
Chief Information Officer (CIO) to accelerate the federal 
government’s secure adoption of cloud computing by leading 
efforts to identify existing standards and guidelines. 
BITS [10]: stands for “Banking Industry Technology 
Secretariat, however a BITS Shared Assessment provides an 
assessment of an organization’s implementation of its 
controls using a standardized questionnaire, which is based 
on the ISO 27002 standard, with additional input from 
Shared Assessments Program members. The approach is 
more rigidly defined (e.g., answers are Yes, No, or N/A, 
making the completed SIG easy to read by machine. The 
original idea was that service providers could complete the 
SIG just once, and then provide the completed SIG to 
multiple clients. 
In short, the BITS Shared Assessment cost is a little more 
and is a little less flexible – but it provides a higher level of 
interim attestation in return. 
GAPP (Generally Accepted Privacy Principles) [11]: 
are privacy principles and criteria developed and updated by 
the AICPA and Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants 
to assist organizations in the design and implementation of 
sound privacy practices and policies. 
HIPAA/HITECH (Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act) [12]: The HIPAA Privacy Rule 
provides federal protections for individually identifiable 
health information held by covered entities and their business 
associates and gives patients an array of rights with respect 
to that information. At the same time, the Privacy Rule is 
balanced so that it permits the disclosure of health 
information needed for patient care and other important 
purposes.  
The Security Rule specifies a series of administrative, 
physical, and technical safeguards for covered entities and 
their business associates to use to assure the confidentiality, 
integrity, and availability of electronic protected health 
information. The Health Information Technology for 
Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, enacted as 
part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 
2009, was signed into law on February 17, 2009, to promote 
the adoption and meaningful use of health information 
technology.  Subtitle D of the HITECH Act addresses the 
privacy and security concerns associated with the electronic 
transmission of health information, in part, through several 
provisions that strengthen the civil and criminal enforcement 
of the HIPAA rules.   
Jericho Forum [13]: is an international group of 
organizations working together to define and promote the 
solutions surrounding the issue of de-perimeterisation. It was 
officially founded at the offices of the Open Group in 
Reading, UK, on Friday 16 January 2004. It had existed as a 
loose affiliation of interested corporate CISOs (Chief 
Information Security Officers) discussing the topic since the 
summer of 2003. 
NERC CIP (North American Electric Reliability 
Corporation- Critical infrastructure protection) [14]: is a 
concept that relates to the preparedness and response to 
serious incidents that involve the critical infrastructure of a 
region or nation. 
In our work, we focus firstly on PCI DSS framework to 
provide a questionnaire to control card data on the cloud and 
give a critical review to improve the framework and add 
more requirements for Cloud Computing. Afterward, we 
extend the work to the other frameworks in order to have a 
complete checklist a standard for Cloud Computing adopters 
D. The PCI DSS 
The PCI DSS was created jointly in 2004 by four major 
credit-card companies: Visa, MasterCard, Discover and 
American Express. 
The PCI Security Standards Council is an open global 
forum, launched in 2006, that is responsible for the 
development, management, education, and awareness of the 
PCI Security Standards, including the Data Security 
Standard (PCI DSS), Payment Application Data Security 
Standard (PA-DSS), and PIN Transaction Security (PTS) 
requirements. 
The Council's five founding global payment brands - 
American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB 
International, MasterCard Worldwide, and Visa Inc - have 
agreed to incorporate the PCI DSS as the technical 
requirements of each of their data security compliance 
programs. Each founding member also recognizes the QSAs 
(Qualified 
Security 
Assessors) 
PA-QSAs 
(Payment 
application Qualified Security Assessors) and ASVs 
(Approved Scanning Vendor) certified by the PCI Security 
Standards Council. 
1) What are the PCI DSS requirements? 
PCI DSS is a set of requirements for protecting 
cardholder data and may be enhanced by additional controls 
and practices to further mitigate risks. 
The PCI DSS specifies and elaborates on six major 
objectives and twelve requirements (Table I). 
These requirements are intended to reduce the risk of 
transactions and promote a holistic approach to the security 
of the Card Data Environment (CDE). It is important for 
companies to understand the scope of PCI DSS and how to 
implement the controls to meet the requirements.

2) PCI DSS compliance in Cloud environments: 
PCI DSS, as stated earlier in this section, applies to any 
company or organization that accepts, processes, transmits or 
stores payment card details or any sensitive data associated 
with a payment card. Merchants and service providers must 
comply with the all the requirements regardless of their size 
and how many transactions they process. 
On February 2013 PCI DSS Cloud Computing 
Guidelines state, The responsibilities delineated between the 
client and the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) for managing 
PCI DSS controls are influenced by a number of variables, 
including but not limited to: 
• 
The purpose for which the client is using the cloud 
service 
• 
The scope of PCI DSS requirements that the client is 
outsourcing to the CSP 
• 
The services and system components that the CSP has 
validated within its own operations 
• 
The service option that the client has selected to engage 
the CSP (IaaS, PaaS or SaaS) 
• 
The scope of any additional services the CSP is 
providing 
to 
proactively 
manage 
the 
client’s 
compliance (for example, additional managed security 
services) 
Hereafter, we show, in Table II, an example of how the 
responsibilities are sharing following the Cloud Layers.

3) Considerations in managing PCI DSS on the Cloud 
computing: 
a) Segmentation of the Cloud: 
a. 
Segmentation on a cloud-computing infrastructure must 
provide an equivalent level of isolation as that 
achievable through physical network separation 
b. Other client environments running on the same 
infrastructure are to be considered untrusted networks 
c. 
The CSP needs to take ownership of the segmentation 
between clients 
d. The client is responsible for the proper configuration of 
any segmentation controls implemented within their 
own environment 
b) Recommendations for Reducing Scope: 
a. 
Do not store, process or transmit payment card data in 
the cloud 
b. Implement a dedicated physical infrastructure that is 
used only for the in-scope cloud environment 
c. 
Minimize reliance on third-party CSPs for protecting 
payment card data 
d. It can be challenging to verify who has access to 
cardholder data processed, transmitted, or stored in the 
cloud environment 
e. 
It can be challenging to collect, correlate, and/or 
archive all of the logs necessary to meet applicable PCI 
DSS requirements 
f. 
Organizations using data-discovery tools to identify 
cardholder data in their environments, and to ensure 
that such data is not stored in unexpected places, may 
find that running such tools in a cloud environment can 
be difficult and result in incomplete results. 
Many large providers might not support right-to-audit for 
their clients. Clients should discuss their needs with the 
provider to determine how the CSP can provide assurance 
that required controls are in place 
III. 
THE CCM AND THE PCI-DSS: THE STATE OF THE ART 
The Cloud Security Alliance’s CCM is a rich source of 
cloud security best practices designed as a framework to 
provide fundamental security principles to cloud vendors and 
cloud customers. It provides a controls framework that gives 
detailed understanding of security concepts and principles 
that are aligned to the Cloud Security Alliance guidance in 
16 domains (latest version 3.0.1) [6]. This tool provides the 
holistic adherence to the vast and ever evolving landscape of 
global data privacy regulations and security standards. 
The CCM serves as the basis for new industry standards 
and certifications. It is the first ever baseline control 
framework specifically designed for managing risk in the 
Cloud Supply Chain: 
 
Addressing the inter- and intra-organizational 
challenges of persistent information security by 
clearly delineating control ownership. 
 
Providing an anchor point and common language for 
balanced measurement of security and compliance 
postures. 
The PCI-DSS is a broadly accepted set of policies and 
procedures intended to optimize the security of credit, debit 
and cash card transactions and protect cardholders against 
misuse of their personal information. Therefore, it is not 
possible for a client to leverage the benefits of cloud systems 
without jeopardizing security, and mainly Card Data.  
In our work, we focus on creating for each topic on CCM 
list a matching PCI-DSS requirement in order to get a series 
of checklists on what the client could depend on to verify the 
trustworthiness of the Cloud before deciding to outsource. 
IV. 
THE DOMAINS OF APPLICATION 
In our work, we focused on 4 main areas (domains) 
because they represent a basis for any tenant to check and 
control Cloud before deciding to outsource or not. Figure 3 
shows the four domains, which are Network and Transport 
security, Data Security, Application and interface security, 
and Business Continuity management. 
 
Figure 3.  The domains developed in the checklist 
 
 
Network and Transport security: These controls 
allow verifying the security of the Card Data on 
network while it is transmitted. It is essential for the 
tenant to check this aspect scrupulously before 
deploying on the Cloud. 
41
International Journal on Advances in Security, vol 9 no 1 & 2, year 2016, http://www.iariajournals.org/security/
2016, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org

 
Data Security: These controls allow verifying the 
security of the Card data and preventing it from any 
leakage.  
 
Application and interface security: These controls 
aim to ensure that any Application and Programming 
Interface (APIs) is designed, developed, deployed 
and tested respecting the PCI-DSS norms in order to 
avoid any leakage. 
 
Business Continuity management: These controls 
aim at insuring the business continuity of the 
activities in any issue or disaster. The client should 
be sure that the activity could continue without any 
deterioration. 
In the next section, we describe the checklist developed 
with an exhaustive questionnaire as a tool for any Cloud 
specialist to verify the compliance of a cloud and its 
readiness to outsource or not. 
V.

VI. 
CRITICAL VIEW TO THE STANDARD PCI-DSS ON THE 
CLOUD 
Many controls specifications in the 4 domains treated 
above are not specified in any requirement in the recent 
version 3.0 of the PCI-DSS norm. These control 
specifications are: 
 
Network and Infrastructure Services: this control 
specification aims verifying that the Business-critical 
or customer (tenant) impacting (physical and virtual) 
application and system-system interface (API) 
designs and configurations, and infrastructure 
network and systems components, is designed, 
developed, and deployed in accordance with 
mutually agreed-upon service and capacity-level 
expectations, as well as IT governance and service 
management policies and procedures. 
 
Equipment Power Failure: this control specification 
aims verifying Information security measures and 
redundancies are implemented to protect equipment 
from utility service outages (e.g., power failures and 
network disruptions). 
 
Impact Analysis: this control specification aims 
verifying that there is a defined and documented 
method for determining the impact of any disruption 
to the organization that must incorporate the 
following: 
o 
Identify critical products and services 
o 
Identify 
all 
dependencies, 
including 
processes, applications, business partners, 
and third party service providers 
o 
Understand threats to critical products and 
services 
o 
Determine impacts resulting from planned 
or unplanned disruptions and how these 
vary over time 
o 
Establish the maximum tolerable period 
for disruption 
o 
Establish priorities for recovery 
o 
Establish recovery time objectives for 
resumption 
of 
critical 
products 
and 
services within their maximum tolerable 
period of disruption 
o 
Estimate 
the 
resources 
required 
for 
resumption.

 In the next step, we will evaluate, as a use case, this new 
framework by applying it on a real Card platform outsourced 
on the Cloud and we check its vulnerability and resilience. 
Afterward, we continue our work by focusing on developing 
recommended requirement for PCI-DSS for these control 
specification that could be added in the next update version 
of the norm. 
VII. USE CASE 
In this section, we describe how we applied the 
framework on a Card Transaction Platform developed as part 
of this project. Firstly, we will describe the solution HibaPay, 
its functionalities and its architecture. Afterward, we will 
apply the framework checklist and we will describe the result 
on the platform. 
However, the solution HibaPay is deployed in a public 
Cloud and it is ready for processing. 
A. Card Data Processins Solution on Cloud 
HibaPay is an electronic Card Transaction Platform that 
allows banks to convert the opportunities offered by the 
development of smartphones and increase in revenue by

C. Analysis 
In our audit of the platform, we stated that many 
requirements are not in place or there are reserves. So, many 
actions must be in place to remove these differences. 
For example, in the "Network Security", we noted a 
reserve on "Cloud Provider" (see Table VI).

Indeed, after auditing, we found that the cloud provider 
does not update the network diagram after a change on 
environment. For this, we asked to add a firewall to improve 
access security. However, we found that the chart was not 
updated in time. 
Another example, Table VII, we found during the audit 
that security policies and operational procedures for 
monitoring all access to network resources and cardholder 
data documented are not known by the provider staff Cloud. 
For this, training must be established to prepare the 
personnel of Cloud Provider for the types of data they will 
handle.

VIII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The goal of the PCI-DSS is to protect cardholder data 
that is processed, stored or transmitted by providers, issuers 
or merchants. The security controls and processes required 
by PCI-DSS are vital for protecting cardholder account data. 
With all the advantages that give Cloud, Issuers, and 
Merchants and any other service providers involved with 
payment card processing must insure that the platform 
virtually and physically is sufficiently protected. 
In this paper, we have developed an exhaustive checklist 
as a tool for any card stakeholder who wants to outsource a 
part or the whole card processing in a Cloud. In the next 
steps of the work, we will focus evaluating Risk 
Management of deployed Card Transaction Platform on a 
Public Cloud and all the strategies to reduce impacts of all 
potential risks.
