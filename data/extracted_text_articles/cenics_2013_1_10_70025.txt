Abstract—Ultra low-voltage (ULV) CMOS logic for high-
performance applications is presented. By applying ﬂoating
capacitors we can increase the current level of MOS transistors
for supply voltages below 500mV . The current level of the
transistors may be increased by a factor 40 for supply voltages
below 0.3V. Simple NAND gates are presented using different
topologies. The NAND gates are exploited to provide a high-
speed and ultra low-voltage serial carry chain. Compared to
conventional serial CMOS carry gates the delay is reduced by
a factor 10 or more. Simulated data are based on SpectreS
simulator provided by Cadence and are valid for 90nm TSMC
CMOS process.

I. INTRODUCTION
The demand for high-speed digital circuits is ever increas-
ing. At the same time the supply voltages in modern CMOS
processes are reduced in order to prevent transistor failure
due to short channel effects. The low supply voltage is a
challenge for high-speed circuit design. With the emergence
of sensor and biomedical applications that require ultra
low energy [1], [2], we have to adequately address design
optimization near the minimum-energy point. It has long
been established that for most logic families the minimum-
energy point occurs in the subthreshold operational region
of the MOS transistors and that the value of the minimum
energy is set by leakage current.
Energy-efﬁciency is one of the most required features for
modern electronic systems designed for high-performance
and/or portable applications. In one hand, the ever increasing
market segment of portable electronic devices demands the
availability of low-power building blocks that enable the im-
plementation of long-lasting battery-operated systems. The
general trend of increasing operating frequencies and circuit
complexity, in order to cope with the throughput needed in
modern high-performance processing applications, requires
the design of high-speed circuits. The supply voltage region
addressed in this paper is between 200mV and 400mV .
In this region traditional CMOS logic design is hampered
with subtreshold current which both reduces the circuit speed
and robustness. In the approach presented in this paper the
main transistors are operating above the threshold voltage
for ultra low supply voltages. For a supply voltage equal
to 300mV the delay of the proposed carry gates is reduced
to less than 10% of a conventional CMOS carry gate while
the noise margin is increased due to an enhanced current
level. The delay variation is reduced accordingly due to large
driving currents. The energy required to drive the gates are
comparable to conventional CMOS [3].
Addition is a fundamental arithmetic operation that is
broadly used in many VLSI systems, such as application-
speciﬁc digital signal processing (DSP) architectures and
microprocessors. This module is the core of many arith-
metic operations such as addition/subtraction, multiplication,
division and address generation. Thus, taking this fact into
consideration, the design of a full-adder having low-power
consumption and low propagation delay is of great interest
for the implementation of modern digital systems. Arith-
metic circuits, like adders and multipliers, are also one of the
basic components in the design of communication circuits.
The ultra low-voltage circuits presented in this paper are
derived from digital ﬂoating-gate circuits [4]. In Section
II, we introduce ultra low-voltage semi-ﬂoating-gate logic
and compare the performance to conventional, i.e., comple-
mentary CMOS. ULV NP domino inverters are described
and the potential delay reduction and increased performance
in terms of minimum-energy-point (MEP) is presented. In
Section III, we present novel ULV NAND and AND gates
using enhanced pass transistors. Different ultra low-voltage
carry gates are presented in Section IV. The high-speed ULV
carry gates can be used in simple serial adders to reduce the
complexity of parallel conventional CMOS adders for supply
voltages below 500mV .
II. ULTRA-LOW-VOLTAGE SEMI-FLOATING-GATE LOGIC
The ULV logic styles presented in this paper are related
to the ULV domino logic style presented in [5]. The main
purpose of the ULV logic style is to increase the current level
for low supply voltages without increasing the transistor
widths. We may increase the current level compared to
complementary CMOS using different initialization voltages
to the gates and applying capacitive inputs. The extra loads
represented by the ﬂoating capacitors are less than extra load
given by increased transistor widths. The capacitive inputs

lower the delay through increased transconductance while
increased transistor widths only reduce parasitic delay. Fur-
thermore, the accuracy of the capacitor values are not critical
and the process variations and temperature will only have a
signiﬁcant impact on the transistor currents through the high
relative transconductance in the subthreshold region. The
ULV logic styles may be used in critical sub circuits where
high speed and low supply voltage is required. The ULV
logic styles may be used together with more conventional
CMOS logic and will require a specialized CMOS process.
The ﬂoating capacitors can be either poly-poly, metal-metal
or MOS parasitics.
The simple dynamic edge and level ULV inverters [5]
are shown in Figure 1. Apply a clock signal to power the
inverter, i.e., either φ to En to and VDD to Ep, or φ to
Ep and GND to En and precharge to 1 or 0 respectively.
The gate resembles NP domino logic. In order to hold the
precharged value until an input transition arrives the E
transistor connected to a supply voltage is made stronger
than the other E transistor. The function of the inverter can
be described as O = AD
The different ULV logic styles are deﬁned by the applied
terminal inputs as shown in Table I. ∆V is the output voltage
swing. The simple model for the noise margin NM
′ is
given by the ratio of the ON current and the OFF current.
The capacitive division factor,
Cin
CT where CT is the total
capacitance seen by a ﬂoating gate is assumed to be 0.5.
The delay is relative to a standard complementary CMOS
inverter. The ON and OFF currents of a complementary
CMOS inverter is given by the effective gate source voltages
VDD and 0V respectively. Assuming Cin
CT = 0.5 where CT is
the total capacitance seen by a ﬂoating gate, we may estimate
the delay, dynamic and static power and noise margins of
the different ULV logic styles relative to a complementary
CMOS inverter.

by the ULV logic the optimum energy-delay curve is moved
to the left in Figure 3, which yields a signiﬁcant reduction
in delay for low supply voltages or a speciﬁc energy level.
The improvement of the current boost can be exploited in
different ways. Firstly, we can for a speciﬁc ultra-low supply
voltage obtain signiﬁcant speed improvement. For example,
assuming a supply voltage equal to 330mV the delay can be
reduced to approximately 5% compared to standard CMOS
at the same energy level. Secondly, if a system is required
to operate at a certain speed, we can for meet the speed
requirement for a lower supply voltage for the ULV logic
than for standard CMOS. Assuming a gate delay equal to
40ps, the required supply voltage for standard CMOS is
500mV whereas the required supply voltage for the ULV
logic is 250mV. The energy consumed by the ULV logic
will be approximately 25% compared to standard CMOS.
Hence, the ULV transistors can be exploited for ultra low-
voltage and high-speed design and ultra low-voltage low-
energy design.
III. ULV AND AND NAND GATES
Different applications of the ULV domino inverter is
shown Figure 4. The inverters can be used to implement
AND2 and NAND2 functions by using one of the inputs
to set the precharge level. The gates in Figure 4 can be
described as a pass transistor with an increased current level.
The delay of the gates are dependent on the input delay. If we
consider the gate in a) we observe that the evaluate transistor
En acts as a pass transistor for the input B when B switches
from 1 to 0 and the other input A switches from 0 to 1. The
delay of the AND2 and NAND2 gates are less than 8% of
a standard complementary NAND gate for supply voltages
below 500mV . For a supply voltage equal to 300mV the
delay of a NAND2 gate is 310ps whereas the delay for a
complementary NAND2 gate is more than 6ns.
The different conﬁgurations of the AND/NAND ULV
gates are given in Table II. Consider the NAND gate in
Figure 5 a). The response of the gate is depending on the
closk signals and inputs:
• Figure 5 b) φ = 1, precharge. The output is precharged
to 1 and the gate of the evaluate transistor En and Ep
are recharged to 0 and 1 respectively. The input A is
precharged to 0 and the input B is precharged to 1.
• Figure 5 c) φ = 1 and A = 0 (no change) and B = 1
(no change). The gate of the evalluate transistors are
not changed and the output remains high.

in Figure 6 c) to f). For input A = 1 (no change) shown in
c) and d) the output will remain high. Details of operation
are:
• Figure 6 c) B = 0 (no change) and A = 1 (no
change). The output remains high unless some other
circuitry pull the output down to 0 by an enhanced
nMOS transistor. If so the gate of the evaluate transistor
will be pulled to 0 and turn off the evaluate transistor
E in order to prevent the output to affect the input A.
• Figure 6 d) B = 1 (transition) and A = 1 (no change).
The evaluate transistor E is enhanced and the output
will remain high unless some other circuitry pull the
output down to 0 by an enhanced nMOS transistor. If
so the gate of the enhanced evaluate transistor will be
pulled to 0 and turn off the evaluate transistor E in
order to prevent the output to affect the input A.
• Figure 6 e) B = 0 (no change) and A = 0 (transition).
The evaluate transistor E is not enhanced and the output
may be pulled to 0 or remain high depending on other
circuitry. If there are no other transistor driving the
output, the output will be pulled slowly towards 0. The
time constant for the pull-down is however much higher
than the time constant for an active pull-down by an
enhanced evaluate transistor.
• Figure 6 f) B = 1 (transition) and A = 0 (transi-
tion).The output is pulled to 0 by the enhanced evaluate
transistor E.

ing three NAND2 gates we obtain the carry deﬁned by
Cout = AB + ACon + BCin. Furthermore, we may assume
that the inputs A and B will arrive prior to the carry input
signal in a serial carry propagation chain. By applying the
A and B inputs to the source of the evaluate transistors we
minimize the worst case propagation delay. If A ̸= B the
carry output is only dependent on the carry input, which is
the worst case scenario for a serial adder.

An alternative carry gate exploiting the NAND gates in
Figure 6 is shown in Figure 10. This gate has less transistors
and less capacitive input load than the carry gate in Figure
7. The carry input signal is used to initiate the precharge the
output, hence the output will be precharged to 1 until the
input carry signal arrives unless the carry output is pulled to
0 by A = B = 1. Note that the carry signals is only applied
to recharge transistors and input capacitors and not as pass
inputs. The carry input is precharged to 0, which turns on
the recharge transistors. In the same phase, the output is
precharged to 1 while the inputs A and B are precharged to
1.
V. CONCLUSION
The potential of ultra low-voltage domino and pass tran-
sistor CMOS has been presented. Different NAND and
AND gates have been presented and are applied in ULV
carry chains. Preliminary simulation results shows potential
speed improvement of the proposed carry gates compared to
complementary CMOS by a factor of 10 or more. Simulated
data are based on SpectreS simulator provided by Cadence
and are valid for 90nm TSMC CMOS process.
