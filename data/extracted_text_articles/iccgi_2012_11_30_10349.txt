Abstract—To solve the problems of uncertainty and
variability in the current automated commerce negotiation, the
intelligence of agent is applied to the process of the commerce
negotiation. We propose the adaptive negotiation strategies
based
on
multi-agent
negotiation
by
historical
learning
algorithm. During negotiation, the main agent, for example
buyer agent, obtains historical information of the opponent, as
seller, from the third party agent who stores the information of
agents participated in and trade information, and then
calculates the negotiation attitude values of the opponents by
historical learning algorithm. Considering the information of
the dynamic market environment, the main agent presents an
appropriate strategy by employing the adaptive concession
strategy function and the effectiveness evaluation mechanism.
The research achievement of this paper is a foundation for
developing a real-life Multi-agent-based commerce negotiation
system in the future.

I.
INTRODUCTION
E-commerce negotiation based on multi-agent is the
general term of the activities performed by agents aiming to
reach an agreement on concerned issues [1-2]. At present,
negotiation strategy is one of main topics in the field of
automatic negotiation, and it is also a method of maximizing
the interests of main agent under the constraint of certain
negotiation
protocol
[3].
Due
to
the
asymmetry
of
information and dynamic change of environment during
negotiation, the choice of negotiating strategy becomes the
key factor of a successful negotiation. In recent years, the
single negotiation strategy has been used more frequently in
the agent-based electronic trading system; however, the
negotiating
strategy
combining
both
the
attitude
of
negotiating agent and the change of dynamic market
environment is rarely studied relatively.
Nowadays, the E-commerce negotiation environment is
faced with the problems of information incompleteness and
finite rationality of E-commerce. For the main agent, there
is a problem to be solved urgently, which is how to
synchronously improve the existing negotiation strategy,
learn and generate adaptive strategy automatically [4]. In
related research, the concept of adaptive strategy based on
argumentation is proposed by Rahwan et al. [5] [6]. The
concession strategies, response strategies, the proposal
strategies and relevant utility function are established for
realizing adaptive negotiations [7]. Ren et al presented the
dynamic adaptability is necessary for agent to negotiate in
open and dynamic environment [4]. Adaptive strategy can
be used to describe and define decision-making behavior of
agent
during
the
process.
And
agents
perform
the
appropriate adaptive operation for different roles in different
environments. This paper focuses on the discussion of the
problem that chooses adaptive strategies based on attitude of
main
agent
by
historical
learning
algorithm.
The
background of negotiation is shown in Section II, the factors
affected the adaptive strategy of main agent are shown in
Section III, the generation of adaptive strategy of main
agent is presented in Section IV, and then the conclusion is
given in Section V.

III.
FACTORS OF ATTITUDE ADAPTIVE
STRATEGY OF NEGOTIATING AGENT
A.
Time factor
Utility theory is a fundamental theory of Western
economics， which can provide support for decision makers
in a decision-making process by obtaining utility values of
an act [8]. During the negotiation, time is one of the most
important
factors
affecting
the
agents’
behaviors.
Considering this fact, this paper employs a time-utility
function to assess the effectiveness of negotiation time [9].
Some notations are defined as follows:
 
U t
: denotes time utility;
t : duration of negotiations;
b
T / Ts
: limited negotiation time of agent b/s;

With the growth of the time, the utility value is getting
smaller and smaller, the chance of negotiation success is
getting smaller and smaller.
B.
Factor of Supply-Demand Relationship
In the real E-commerce trade environment, the number
of sellers and buyers has a direct impact on supply-demand
relationship. It would be beneficial to the sellers in the
negotiation when the number of sellers is less than the
number of buyers, and vice versa. Thus, a ration function of
the number of buyers and sellers is employed to reflect the
supply-demand relationship. The ration function is defined
as:
t
B / St
denotes the number of buyers/sellers agent at
time t; agent s/b denotes the seller/buyer agent;
 
C t is the
value of supply-demand relationship at time t, which always
reflects the market competition; the larger the value is, the
more competitive the market will be. The function
 

C.
Historical Learning of Negotiation
In the negotiating process, the negotiation agent knows
neither the effectiveness to each other brought by their
offers, nor the reasoning principles and constraints of
opponent (seller agent), or whether an agreement could be
achieved, etc.Thus, learning negotiation history of the
opponents
continuously
is
critical
for
a
successful
negotiation. The negotiation history can be derived from a
third party agent. And the historical prices in the negotiation
are taken as the standard in this paper, and then the
negotiation attitude of the opponents (seller agents) can be
learned from the variable-ration of their two most recent bids
[10]. The method of calculating the attitude values of the
opponents is discussed respectively, according to three
different historical records (historical offers) (assuming that
purchase records are stored in the array SP [ ]):
1)
Two historical records of negotiation
SP[K] : The K-th offer of Agent s, and it is a recent
negotiation within the current time. The value of opponent’s
attitude can be defined as:

agent is considered as the main agent, and wants to learn the
seller agent’s attitude of negotiation. It would be the same
research if the seller agent is considered as the main agent.
D.
The Attitude Functions of the Main Agent
The factors which affect the main agent’s negotiation
attitude include: time factor, supply-demand relationship
factor, and the opponent's negotiation attitude. In the
attitude function of the main agent, ψ is defined as the
attitude value of the main agent; history means the history
of the negotiating opponent obtained from a third party
agent;
ψ
denotes the initial attitude value of the main
agent. The attitude function is defined as follows:

Different negotiation attitude value of main agent
corresponds to different attitude [11]:
1)

(Patient): The negotiation agent keeps its initial
proposal, and it slowly increase or decrease the proposal to
its retention until the negotiation time is up;
2)


(Calm): The negotiation agent changes its
proposed value relatively stable in the whole process of
negotiation;
3)


(Eager): The negotiation agent rapidly
increases or decreases to its retention in the early negotiation
process, and it will keep the value until negotiation ends.
IV.
THE GENERATION OF THE ATTITUDE
ADAPTIVE STRATEGY BASED ON HISTORICAL
LEARNING
In this paper, the whole negotiation process involves
three entities: buyer agent, seller agent, third-party agent.
Third-party agent stores the historical information of
negotiation and agents’ credibility, and processes requests
from both agents. Before the negotiation, the buyer/seller
agent requests a third party agent to provide opponent’s
trade information, which could be helpful in the output of
their negotiation attitude values finally.
A.
The Generation of Attitude Adaptive Strategy of Main
Agent
With aforementioned historical learning and the attitude
function of the main agent, an adaptive concession strategy
function based on time-bound can be easily established [12].
Let:
P(t) : denotes the offer of the main agent at time t;
bmin

P

: is the buyer's/seller’s minimum offer;
bmax
smax
P

buyer/seller at time t, and it equals to Ψ ;


Based on the aforementioned function of offer, an
effectiveness evaluation mechanism is established. Let p
denotes the time at which negotiation issues reached; k
denotes the time discount factor of issues. The utility of the
issues can be defined as [13]:

Given the above, a proposal selection mechanism can be
established, of which
s
P b
 (t)
: means the proposal of Agent s to Agent b at time
t;
bP (t) : the intention offer of Agent b at time t;
b
ρ (t) : the utility value of Agent b’s intention bidding;
s

: the utility value of Agent s’s bid for Agent b at

tp : Agent b’s anti-bid at time t.
Evaluation function of the proposal, which Agent b
sends to Agent s at time t as follows:


The buyer agent could get the value of attitude from

or terminates.
B.
Learning Algorithm for Attitude Adaptive Negotiation
Strategy of Main Agent
Based on the theories mentioned above, negotiation
learning algorithm process of buyer Agent b is shown in
Figure. 1:
1)
Initialization. The negotiating participants set could be
denoted as A= {Agent b, Agent s}, of which Agent b is the
negotiation initiator; Agent s is the negotiation respondent.
Negotiation issues set G includes n issues, t=0 means that the
negotiating parties are ready;
2)
Before the first round of negotiation, Agent b sends
request to the third party agent for the information queries of
Agent s. After confirmation, Agent b could obtain the history
information of Agent s;
3)
Agent b gets the value of attitude of Agent s by
learning the opponent’s historical negotiating information;
4)
Agent b could get its value of negotiating attitude by
the attitude function of
main agent;
5)
Agent b could obtain the intention offer P(t) through
adaptive concession strategy function;
6)
Agent b sends negotiating request proposal(Agent
b,t,G) to Agent s;
7)
If Agent s refuses to accept the proposal or the
waiting time exceeds T, then the algorithm turns to step 15）
negotiation termination. Otherwise, execute the next step;
8)
When Agent s receives the negotiating request of
Agent b, it gives out its proposal(Agent s, t’, G) for each
issue;
9)
Agent b evaluates the proposal of Agent s by
employing
the

history study, or else turn to the step 13）confirms quote;
13) If Agent b confirms the offer of Agent s, and then
Agent b chooses the Agent s, turn to 14）negotiation

CONCLUSIONS
The adaptive strategies play a very important role in
the process of E-commerce automated negotiation for
enhancing efficiency and arriving trade. Based on historical
learning algorithm, an adaptive selection strategy based on
attitude of main agent was proposed for solving the
problems of uncertainty and variability in the current
E-commerce negotiations. In this paper, the factors that can
influence the adaptive strategy based on attitude of main
agent were analyzed, the third-party agent was introduced,
and a learning algorithm of the negotiator agent was also
proposed.
The main agent could infer the opponent’s attitude
value by opponent historical information provided by the
third party agent. It could also get its adaptive strategies by
negotiation learning algorithm for considering the different
attitudes of agents during negotiation process. The main
agent could obtain its intention offer by the concession
strategies, and then select a proposal by employing the
evaluation mechanism of effectiveness to maximize its
profit. By the theoretical analysis, it can be seen that the
proposed algorithm could be efficiently applied to the
“one-to-one
“negotiation,
as
well
as
“one-to-many”
negotiation. The proposed algorithm could help reduce the
blindness of proposal and negotiation time, especially when
the preferences or behaviors of the opponents are totally
unknown during negotiation. Therefore, it has great help for
increasing the successful rate of negotiation.
