Abstract— In this paper, Non-Binary Rate-Compatible 
Punctured Low Density Parity Check (NB RCP LDPC) code is 
designed over the extended Galois Field. The designed NB 
RCP LDPC code is applied to the type II Hybrid Automatic 
Repeat reQuest (HARQ) with Decode and Forward (DF) relay 
on Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) Orthogonal 
Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) channel and MIMO

(SC-FDMA) channel. The designed code enables us to decrease 
the coding rate with incremental redundancy for each 
retransmission in HARQ. The retransmission is done from the 
DF relay after the successful decoding in the relay. We have 
verified through computer simulations that the proposed type 
II HARQ scheme with DF relay greatly improves the 
throughput 
and 
average 
retransmission 
characteristics 
compared with the scheme without DF relay. Multiple relay 
cases are also considered.

I. INTRODUCTION 
An LDPC code that suits the flexible coding rate design 
and has the high error correcting capability through iterative 
decoding can be constructed on arbitrary extended Galois 
Field (GF). The Non-Binary (NB) LDPC code constructed 
on extended GF [1],[2] generally exhibits the better Bit 
Error Rate (BER) performance than the binary LDPC codes 
[3],[4]. There also exist RCP LDPC codes with variable 
coding rate obtained by properly puncturing the mother 
LDPC code [5]. The RCP LDPC codes enable us to use the 
same decoder as the mother code and suit the ARQ error 
correcting schemes [6],[7] with the incremental redundancy. 
By combining the NB LDPC codes with the RCP codes, the 
NB RCP LDPC codes were designed and the designed NB 
RCP LDPC codes were applied to the type II HARQ [8],[9]. 
When comparing the HARQ using NB RCP LDPC codes 
with the existing RCPT (Rate Compatible Punctured Turbo) 
HARQ using binary Turbo codes [10], the HARQ with NB 
RCP LDPC codes can cope with flexible coding rates, code 
word lengths and NB symbol LLR [11] additions without 
using inter-leavers for burst errors on the channel. On the 
other hand, the Decode and Forward (DF) relay schemes 
[12],[13] are useful for HARQ schemes. By using the DF 
relay, the source node can be replaced by the relay, once the 
relay correctly decodes the packet from the source. This 
replacement from the source to the relay effectively reduces 
the number of retransmissions and improves the throughput. 
In [9], NB LDPC coding with NB repletion codes is applied 
to multiple relay case for flat fading channel. The NB RCP 
LDPC coded type II HARQ with DF relay is applied to the 
MIMO-OFDM modulation in [2]. The incremental 
redundancy in HARQ with DF relay is also suited to the 
up-link transmission like in Long Term Evolution (LTE) or 
4G. Due to the necessities of low PAPR and the high power 
efficiency in the amplification, MIMO SC-FDMA [14] is 
usually adopted to the up-links in cellular networks. Among 
SC-FDMA, interleaved SC-FDMA is especially useful 
because of its very low PAPR nature and excellent 
frequency diversity effect [14]. The application of NB RCP 
LDPC codes to MIMO interleaved SC-FDMA with 
multiple DF relays was reported in [1]. 
In this paper, we have examined in detail the 
performance of NB RCP LDPC coded type II HARQ with 
DF relays on MIMO OFDM channel and MIMO 
interleaved SC-FDMA channel with completely new 
simulations. Although some parts in this paper are identical 
to [1] and [2], the contents of [1] and [2] are verified and 
some new simulations and results are added. We have 
confirmed that the proposed HARQ scheme with DF relay 
greatly improves the throughput and the average number of 
retransmission characteristics compared with the case of no 
DF relay. Moreover, we have investigated the multiple relay 
cases. 
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, RCP 
LDPC code is introduced. In Section III, NB LDPC coded 
Type II HARQ scheme is described. In Section IV, we 
introduce the DF relaying scheme. In Section V, we briefly 
illustrate the MIMO OFDM and MIMO interleaved 
SC-FDMA modulation. In Section VI, computer simulation 
results are shown. The paper concludes with Section VII. 
II. RCP LDPC CODE 
The encoding and decoding procedure of RCP LDPC 
code is as follows. We call the code before puncture and the 
code after puncture as the mother code and the efficient 
code, respectively. In RCP LDPC code, the encoder and 
decoder of mother code can also be applied to the efficient 
code. When the parity check matrix of mother code is given

symbol LLR (Log Likelihood Ratio) [11] from the receive 
signal and it is fed to the mother code decoder as the initial 
value for the sum-product algorithm. The symbol LLR for 
the position P  is initially set to 0, because there is no 
available symbol LLR corresponding to the position P . 
III. NB RCP LDPC CODED TYPE II HARQ SCHEME 
In Figure 1, we show the transmitter and receiver block 
diagram of NB RCP LDPC coded Type II HARQ. At the 
transmitter, the data bits are firstly encoded by the Cyclic 
Redundancy Check (CRC)-16 error detecting code and 
secondly encoded by the NB LDPC code on GF(4) or 
GF(16). The encoded LDPC code word is divided into the 
transmission packets and they are modulated by Quaternary 
Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) or 16 Quadrature Amplitude 
Modulation (16QAM) depending on GF(4) or GF(16), 
respectively. Matching GF( )
Q  to the modulation level Q  
is preferable in calculating the symbol LLR and reduces the 
complexity compared with the use of bit LLR calculation. 
After the interpolation filtering and the up-conversion to 
carrier frequency, the Radio Frequency (RF) signal is 
transmitted from the antenna. 
At the receiver side, the received signal is demodulated 
and the symbol LLR is calculated. The symbol LLR is then 
fed to the NB LDPC decoder. Using Sum-Product 
Algorithm (SPA), the LDPC code word is decoded and the 
hard decision is made to obtain the data bits. The data bits

are then CRC-checked and Negative ACKnowledgement 
(NACK) or ACKnowledgement (ACK) is returned to the 
transmitter corresponding to the error or no error detection. 
The BER characteristics of RCP LDPC code on Additive 
White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel are examined 
when the rate 1/2 mother code on GF(4) or GF(16) is 
punctured to change the coding rate. The simulation 
condition is listed in Table I and the simulation results are 
shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3. C++ language is utilized 
for programming. From the simulation results, we know 
that the efficient codes on GF(4) or GF(16) with different 
coding rates are obtained from a mother code and the error 
correction capability corresponding to each coding rate is 
achieved. 
In type II HARQ, like in Figure 4, at the first 
transmission, only uncoded information symbols are 
transmitted, and at the second transmission and after, the 
parity check symbols are retransmitted at the incremental 
redundancy policy. Accordingly, when the channel 
condition is good, the first uncoded transmission is 
successful and it achieves high throughput. On the other 
hand, when the channel condition is bad, by decreasing the 
coding rate at each retransmission, the error correction 
capability increases gradually. The generation of NB RCP 
LDPC code is done only once at the transmitter and there is 
no need of regeneration of code word when the coding rate

2 spatial multiplex streams are employed 
 
 
is decreased. Therefore, there is no increase of complexity 
of NB RCP LDPC code compared with the fixed rate NB 
LDPC code. Also at the receiver side, the complexity of NB 
RCP LDPC decoder does not increase compared with the 
fixed rate NB LDPC decoder, because the same and only 
one NB LDPC decoder can be used for various coding rates 
of NB RCP LDPC code. 
IV. DECODE AND FORWARD RELAYING SCHEME 
The Decode and Forward relay model is shown in 
Figure 5. We consider the relay arrangement where the 
relay locates at the middle point between the source 
(transmitter) and the destination (receiver). 
 
 
Figure 5. DF (Decode and Forward) relaying model 
  
At the first transmission, the source broadcasts the 
uncoded information packet to the relay and destination 
simultaneously. The relay and destination independently 
detect the transmission errors using CRC-16 code. The 
relay and destination independently return (broadcast) ACK 
or NACK to the source. This ACK or NACK is shared 
among source, relay and destination. If the destination 
returns ACK, the transmission finishes at the first 
transmission and this condition is equivalent to no relay. 
Otherwise, retransmission is made. The source sends parity 
check packets with incremental redundancy. The relay and 
destination receive the parity check packet and combine it 
with already received packet. The LDPC decoding and 
CRC error detection is done both at relay and destination. 
ACK or NACK is returned and shared among source, relay 
and destination. At this point, if destination returns NACK 
but relay does ACK, then the relay sends the parity check 
packet hereafter instead of the source, i.e., the source is 
replaced by the relay which locates closer to destination. 
The transmission from relay to destination is more 
successful than source to destination due to the near 
distance between relay and destination. Also, as the source 
and relay do not simultaneously retransmit the parity check 
packet, the total transmission power is the same between 
with and without relay. This saves the total transmit energy 
in the case when the same transmit power as source is 
allocated to the relay. 
Next, we consider the two relay cases where two relays 
are allocated in parallel or serial manner as shown in Figure 
6(b) or (c), respectively. Figure 6 (a) is the arrangement of 
single relay already discussed. In Figure 6 (b), two relays 
are allocated in the middle point between source and 
destination in parallel. In Figure 6(c), relay 1 and relay 2 are 
allocated serially with equal distance interval between 
source and destination. When the power attenuation 
exponent is given by   and the distance between source 
and destination is normalized as 1, the relay at the middle 
point between source and destination in Figure 6 (a) and (b) 
receives 2  times more power than the direct link between 
source and destination. Similarly, the relay 1 and relay 2 in 
Figure 6 (c) receives 3  times more power than the direct 
link.

V. MIMO OFDM AND MIMO SC-FDMA MODULATION 
SHEME 
In Figure 7, we show the block diagram of NB RCP 
LDPC coded Type II HARQ scheme using MIMO-OFDM 
modulation. At the transmitter, the data bits are firstly 
encoded by the CRC-16 error detecting code and secondly 
encoded by the NB LDPC code on GF(4) or GF(16). The 
encoded NB alphabets are mapped to QPSK signal points 
for GF(4) or 16QAM for GF(16). These signal points are 
then modulated by OFDM with guard interval insertion for 
making a packet for each transmission. The OFDM signal is 
then transmitted to the frequency selective channel from 
each transmit antenna. At the receiver, for each antenna, the 
guard interval is first removed and then OFDM 
demodulation is made using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).

The symbol LLR values are then fed to the LDPC 
decoder and the iterative decoding using sum-product 
algorithm is done. The decoded information bits are 
error-detected by the CRC-16 code. If error is not detected, 
the data bits are fed to the data sink and the ACK is returned 
to the transmitter to finish the transmission. But if errors are 
detected, the NACK is returned and the retransmission is 
requested. As the type II HARQ scheme is employed, at the 
first transmission, only the data symbols without encoding 
are sent to the receiver. After the 2nd transmission, as 
shown in Figure 4, the parity symbols are sent several times 
with the incremental redundancy depending on the error 
detection status at the receiver. When the channel quality is 
good, the uncoded data packet for the first transmission 
succeeds with high probability leading to the high 
throughput performance. On the other hand, when the 
channel quality is bad, the parity packets are retransmitted 
several times till the LDPC code rate reaches the lowest one

In Figure 8, we show the transmitter and receiver block 
diagram of NB RCP LDPC coded Type II HARQ using 
MIMO SC-FDMA. At the transmitter, the data bits are 
firstly encoded by the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)-16 
error detecting code and secondly encoded by the NB 
LDPC code on GF(4) or GF(16). The encoded LDPC code  
word is divided into the transmission packets and they are 
modulated by QPSK or 16QAM depending on GF(4) or 
GF(16), respectively. The modulated QAM symbols are 
then N-point FFT transformed at each antenna stream and 
the subcarrier mapping is done to make the interleaved 
SC-FDMA spectrum as shown in Figure 9. The interleaved 
spectrum is then M-point Inverse FFT (IFFT) transformed,

 and U  is the number of users (

in Figure 9). Cyclic Prefix (CP) is added to the time domain 
complex samples of an IFFT block. After the interpolation 
filtering and the up-conversion to carrier frequency, the RF 
signal is transmitted from each antenna. At the base station, 
after the down-conversion to baseband and the sampling, 
CP is removed and the M-point FFT is done to obtain the 
frequency domain signal. The frequency domain signal is 
then subcarrier-de-mapped to aggregate the interleaved 
spectrum of each user back to the N sample spectrum again. 
The Frequency Domain Equalization (FDE) is made to 
compensate the channel frequency response and separate

N-point IFFT is made to obtain the time domain signal of

VI. COMPUTER SIMULATION RESULTS 
The throughput performance and the average number of 
retransmission characteristic for 2
 2
 MIMO-OFDM NB 
RCP LDPC coded Type II Hybrid-ARQ with GF(4) and 
QPSK or with GF(16) and 16QAM are investigated. We 
compared the performance between with and without relay. 
The simulation condition is listed in Table II. The 
simulation results for throughput characteristic are shown in 
Figure 10 – Figure 13. The simulation results for average 
number of retransmission are shown in Figure 14 - Figure 
17. We have also shown the simulation results for the 
parallel two relay case of Figure 6 (b) and the serial two 
relay case of Figure 6 (c) in Figures 18 and 19, respectively. 
For QPSK, an LDPC code word on GF(4) is divided 
into 16 OFDM symbols. As the coding rate of mother 
LDPC code is 1/2, the former 8 OFDM symbols are the 
information data symbols and the latter 8 OFDM symbols 
are the parity check symbols. For the 1st transmission, 8 
OFDM symbols made from information data are 
transmitted from 2 transmit antennas simultaneously using 
4 OFDM symbol durations. For the 2nd transmission and 
thereafter, i.e., retransmission, 4 OFDM symbols made 
from the parity check symbols are transmitted from 2 
transmit antennas simultaneously. In each retransmission, 1 
parity check OFDM symbol is transmitted from each 
antenna using 1 OFDM duration. The coding rate is 
decreased gradually from 4/5, 4/6, 4/7 to 4/8 for each 
retransmission. For 16QAM, the coding rate is decreased 
from 2/2, 2/3 to 2/4. After all the parity check OFDM 
symbols are transmitted and the coding rate reaches 4/8=1/2, 
if the errors are still detected at the destination, the whole 
transmission of the same RCP LDPC code word in the same 
manner is repeated up to 15 times, which is enough large 
number to measure the throughput and the average number 
of retransmission. We call this procedure of decreasing the 
coding rate from 1 to 1/2 as the one set as shown in Table II. 
The symbol LLR addition is used at the destination for the 
repeated reception of the same RCP LDPC code word. 
For the comparative scheme, we considered the type I 
HARQ with the fixed coding rate LDPC code and set the 
maximum number of retransmissions also to be 15 times. 
We compare the throughput performance of type II 
HARQ with type I HARQ in Figures 10, 11, 12, and 13. As 
the coding rate of type I HARQ increases, the throughput 
also increases in the high average 
0
Eb /
N  region. On the 
other hand, the throughput of type II HARQ approaches to 
4 (bps/Hz) and 8 (bps/Hz) in case of QPSK and 16QAM, 
respectively, in the high 
0
Eb /
N  region. This is because 
type II HARQ can change the coding rate adaptively and it 
can use the coding rate of 1 for high Signal to Noise Ratio

(SNR) region. The slight decrease of throughput in type II 
HARQ from 4 (bps/Hz) and 8 (bps/Hz) is due to the use of 
CRC-16 error detection code. In type II HARQ, however, 
the parity check packet is sequentially retransmitted in 
responding to the NACK, so the number of retransmission 
becomes large compared with the type I HARQ. Also in 
type II HARQ, the iterative decoding of LDPC code is done 
for each retransmission of parity check packet, thus the 
decoding time tends to increase. 
Next, we compare the cases with and without relay. 
When the average receive 
0
Eb /
N  is high, the throughputs 
with and without relay are almost equal, but when the 
average receive 
0
Eb /
N  is low, the throughput with relay is 
higher than without relay. This is because for the high 
average receive 
0
Eb /
N  region, the destination can receive 
the packet correctly without retransmission. Accordingly, 
the relay is not used for this high 
0
Eb /
N  region, so there 
is no difference between with and without relay. On the 
other hand, for the region where the average receive 
0
Eb /
N  is low, the transmission from source to destination 
often fails, but the transmission from relay to destination 
succeeds with high probability, thus the retransmission is 
switched from the source to the relay for this low 
0
Eb /
N  
region. For the type I HARQ schemes with a relay in Figure 
11, Figure 13, Figure 15, and Figure 17, we know that the 
throughput with a relay is largely improved compared with 
the one without relay for the region where the average 
number of retransmission is 1. For this region the 
throughput of type I HARQ is almost one half of the 
throughput for high 
0
Eb /
N  region. This means that for 
this region the transmission is switched from the source to 
relay and the retransmission from the relay to destination is 
almost successful. This observation proves that the use of

Figure 19. Comparison of average number of retransmissions of NB GF(4)

relay is quite effective in HARQ. 
As for the proposed type II HARQ, the throughput is 
larger than all the type I HARQ schemes and is optimum 
for all average receive 
0
Eb /
N  values. However, the 
average number of retransmission becomes larger than the 
type I ARQ schemes because of the incremental redundancy 
retransmissions. 
As for the relay arrangements in Figure 6, from Figure 
18 and Figure 19, we see that the throughput and the 
average number of retransmission characteristics for the 
serial arrangement in Figure 6 (c) show the best. The 
parallel arrangement in Figure 6 (b) exhibits almost the 
same performance as the one relay case in Figure 6 (a). This 
observation comes from the fact that the receive power at 
relay or destination in the serial arrangement becomes 
larger than the parallel arrangement. 
Next, from Figure 20 - Figure 29, we show the 
throughput and the average number of retransmission 
characteristics of NB RCP LDPC coded type II HARQ on 
2×2 MIMO interleaved SC-FDMA. The simulation 
conditions are listed in Table III. The simulation results for 
throughput characteristic are shown in Figure 20, Figure 21, 
Figure 22, and Figure 23. The simulation results for average 
number of retransmission are shown Figure 24, Figure 25, 
Figure 26, and Figure 27. We have shown the simulation 
results for the parallel two relay case and the serial two 
relay case in Figures 28 and 29. 
When QPSK modulation is employed, one GF(4) 
LDPC mother code word is divided into 8 packets. As the 
coding rate of mother LDPC code is 1/2, the former 4 
packets contain only information symbols and the latter 4 
packets consist of parity check symbols. For the 1st 
transmission, 4 information packets are transmitted from 
two antennas. For the 2nd retransmission and after, 1 parity 
check packets are retransmitted at each retransmission 
resulting in lowering the coding rate at receiver from 4/5 to 
4/6, 4/7, 4/8. After all the parity check packets are 
retransmitted and the coding rate at destination reaches 1/2, 
if error is still detected at destination, the same RCP LDPC 
code transmission is repeated 15 times and each time the 
symbol LLR’s are summed up at destination by symbol 
LLR addition. We call this procedure of decreasing the 
coding rate from 1 to 1/2 as the one set. Thus, the total 15 
sets of RCP LDPC code word transmission are done before 
the final discard of RCP LDPC code in case of failure of 
error correction at destination. As a comparative scheme, 
we also considered the LDPC coded type I HARQ scheme 
where the coding rate is fixed for each retransmission. The 
maximum number of retransmissions is limited to 15 and 
the symbol LLR addition is employed at the destination. 
When 16QAM modulation is employed, one GF(16) 
LDPC mother code word is divided into 4 packets. The 
former 2 packets contain only information symbols and the 
latter 2 packets consist of parity check symbols. The coding 
rate decreases from 2/3 to 2/4 at each retransmission. After 
all the packets are retransmitted and the coding rate at 
destination reaches 1/2, if error is still detected at 
destination, the same RCP LDPC transmission is repeated 
15 times in total, which is the same as the case of QPSK

modulation as mentioned in the above. As for the number of 
users U , we employed 
U  4
, but any number of users 
U  is available depending on how much subcarriers 
assigned to each user, i.e., 
/
N
 M U
. Less number of 
subcarriers will lead to less frequency diversity effect. 
For the two parallel relays or two serial relays, we also 
show the throughput and the average number of 
retransmission characteristics in Figure 28, and Figure 29, 
respectively. 
Regarding the simulation results, we first compare the 
type I HARQ with the type II HARQ in case of no relay. 
The throughput characteristic of type I HARQ saturates in 
the high average 
0
Eb /
N  region, because the coding rate is 
fixed. As the coding rate of type I HARQ increases, the 
throughput also increases in the high average 
0
Eb /
N  
region. On the other hand, the throughput of type II HARQ 
approaches to 4 (bps/Hz) and 8 (bps/Hz) in case of QPSK 
and 16QAM, respectively, in the high 
0
Eb /
N  region. This 
is because type II HARQ can change the coding rate 
adaptively and it can use the coding rate of 1 for high SNR 
region. The slight decrease of throughput in type II HARQ 
is due to the use of CRC-16 error detection code. We also 
observe that for entire 
0
Eb /
N  region, the throughput of 
type II HARQ is optimized and is superior to type I HARQ. 
However, the average number of retransmission of type II 
HARQ is worse than type I HARQ. This is because parity 
check packets are sent sequentially with several time slots 
in type II HARQ, while the parity check packet is sent at a

time in type I HARQ. 
Next, we compare the case with a relay and without 
relay. When the average 
0
Eb /
N  is high, the throughput 
with a relay is the same as without relay. This is because, 
both in the case with a relay and without relay, the average 
number of retransmission is almost 0 for the high average  
0
Eb /
N  region, and there makes no difference between the 
two. On the other hand, when the average 
0
Eb /
N  is low, 
we see that the throughput and the average number of 
retransmission characteristics with a relay are much better 
than the ones without relay. This is because for low average 
0
Eb /
N  region, although the destination frequently fails to 
decode the code word correctly, the relay succeeds in 
decoding with high probability. Accordingly, as the 
retransmission is executed from the relay to the destination 
instead of the source to the destination, the probability of 
successful decoding at destination is increased. We also 
observe that when the number of average retransmission is 
greater than 0, i.e., the retransmission is done and the total 
number of transmission is more than 2, the throughput with 
a relay is largely improved compared with the one without 
relay.

On the relay arrangements in Figure 6, from Figure 28, 
and Figure 29, we observe that the throughput and the 
average number of retransmission characteristics for the 
serial arrangement in Figure 6 (c) show the best 
performance. The parallel arrangement in Figure 6 (b) 
exhibits almost the same performance as the one relay case 
in Figure 6 (a). This observation can be understood from the 
fact that the receive power at relay or destination in the 
serial arrangement becomes larger than the parallel 
arrangement as previously stated in MIMO OFDM.

difference between the two modulations, we observe in

retransmission of MIMO interleaved SC-FDMA are better 
than the MIMO OFDM above 
0
Eb /
N  20 (dB). This 
seems to be caused from the difference of BER 
performance between the two modulations. We show the 
BER characteristics of uncoded MIMO OFDM and 
uncoded MIMO interleaved SC-FDMA in Figure 30 
simulated under the same simulation conditions of Table II 
and Table III. From Figure 30, we know the BER of MIMO 
interleaved SC-FDMA is better than the MIMO OFDM 
above 
0
Eb /
N  20 (dB). Accordingly, the throughput and 
the average number of retransmission of MIMO interleaved 
SC-FDMA are superior to the MIMO OFDM. 
In all the simulations in the above figures, a 
quasi-static Rayleigh fading channel with 16 delay paths 
having equal average power is considered and it is basically 
a static channel and time-invariant. If the mobile 
time-variant channel is considered and employed for the 
proposed schemes, further degradation of throughput and 
average number of retransmission is expected due to the 
channel estimation error caused by rapid time-varying 
channel. For future studies, the throughput and the average 
number of retransmission should be measured in real 
mobile environment using real test beds. 
VII. CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we have investigated the throughput and 
the average number of retransmission characteristics of the 
proposed NB RCP LDPC coded type II HARQ with DF 
relays using MIMO-OFDM and MIMO interleaved 
SC-FDMA. We have verified the effectiveness of the 
proposed scheme through computer simulation. In the 
proposed scheme, for the first transmission, only uncoded 
information packet is transmitted to both for relay and 
destination. If error is detected at destination, parity check 
packets are retransmitted for the 2nd and the subsequent 
retransmissions. The error correction decoding is done both 
at relay and destination. When the destination fails in 
decoding, but the relay succeeds, the relay replaces the 
source hereafter. The relay retransmits the remaining parity 
check packets with incremental redundancy instead of 
source. The destination receives the parity check packets till 
the coding rate reaches 1/2. We made clear that by using DF 
relays the throughput and the average number of 
retransmission characteristics are improved especially for 
low receive SNR region.
