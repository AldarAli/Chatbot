Abstract— This paper provides a new way of handling results 
related to safety algorithms used in urban area, in an 
intersection network. It denounces the waste of computing 
resources granted to run those algorithms while most mobile 
entities targeted may be detected several times during their 
journey 
through 
multiple 
interconnected 
intelligent 
intersections. A new approach is proposed, mixing detection 
algorithms and communications between intersection in order 
to reinforce consecutive detections of the same vehicles at 
different places. Experimentation in simulated environment 
leveraging a vehicular simulator called SCANeR Studio give 
some payoff on its performances: some improvements relative 
to the precision of vehicle detections but also a slight shift in 
detected position that may be corrected with an optimized data 
fusion algorithm.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Road safety have been considered primarily as a 
responsibility of each driver for a long time. Yet evolution 
of new vehicle technologies brought a renewal in this vision 
and allowed the development of new systems to assist 
drivers in their task: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems 
(ADAS) [1]. This possibility was granted thanks to the use 
of multiple on-board sensors and higher computational 
capabilities.  
A similar trend was followed for road infrastructures 
and contributed to the development of new prevention 
techniques [2]. It is shown in [3] that these techniques 
correspond mainly to the analysis of vehicle and driver 
behavior and are based on detection, classification and 
tracking of different objects. These objects are evolving on a 
monitored location to prevent potentially dangerous 
situations and subsequently collisions and accidents. These 
new approaches oriented the choice of the different sensing 
systems to deploy on infrastructures, depending on the 
capabilities of the sensors and on the configuration on the  
chosen infrastructure itself. With more and more sensors 
involved to ensure better knowledge on the monitored area, 
data fusion has become a necessity. In [4], models, 
architecture, opportunities, and applications of data fusion 
among Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) are described 
and show promising results. 
Monitoring an intersection allows flexibility and the 
choice of sensors may be done by considering both the 
environmental factors and the particularities of the 
intersection. The concept introduced in this work offers a 
solution customizable to fit any road network and aims to 
perform with any type of sensors. In this regard, scenarios 
build in the chosen simulator are simple enough to 
accommodate all kind of sensors. Results presented in the 
review [5] outlined the good performances and relatively 
low-cost of camera-based solutions thanks to the progress of 
computer vision techniques. Although, their implementation 
requires most of the time the application of deep learning 
techniques. However, in order to keep the problem to a 
simpler state, other technologies are considered, such as: 
Radio Detection And Ranging (RADAR) or Light Detection 
And Ranging (LiDAR). Shirazi et al. in [3] give additional 
information on the trending sensors used for entity detection 
around intersections. While showing once again the potential 
of cameras, it also reveals comparable performances for 
LiDARs and rises only one main drawback: its high cost. 
However, this represents no obstacle for this project as 
simulations 
allow 
easy 
implementation 
without 
consideration of the cost. LiDAR will then be the chosen 
type of sensor at this stage. 
Some more work has been exposed in [6], focused on 
the use of Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) 
and especially Vehicle-To-All (V2X) communications. It 
shows the potential of DSRC in intersection safety, as well 
as the implication of countries in its development. V2X 
demonstrates strong results while associated with the 
sensing equipment’s that can be deployed in the 
infrastructure. Connected vehicles are considered as a highly 
potential step of the evolution of cars which may appear 
progressively, sooner than any automated driving vehicles 
from 
medium 
to 
high 
autonom 
level. 
Including 
communication technologies in any upcoming road safety 
solution should be a must.

Advances in infrastructure technologies have also led 
to improvements in traffic management through intersection 
cooperation [7], enabled by vehicular communications. Once 
again, some very promising solutions have been presented, 
leading to new thoughts on the future of signalization. 
However, while independently showing very good results, 
intersection cooperation and vehicular safety analysis have 
not gathered as much interest and very few works have been 
done in the preservation of analysis results. While powerful 
algorithms run on a single intersection to ensure its safety, 
once any mobile entity leaves this intersection, all gathered 
data is lost and next intersections will have to execute 
similar processes to infer to the same information for its self-
use. While taking advantage simultaneously of infrastructure 
equipped with multiple sensors, DSRC and data fusion 
techniques, this paper introduces the idea of shared data 
through an example of intersection network. For this 
purpose, a testing environment has been simulated on the 
vehicular simulator SCANeR Studio from AVSimulation 
where different scenarios were run to gather data from 
dedicated sensors, then processed in external models 
synchronized with the simulator. 
Section 2 explains the new concept presented in this 
document. Then, Section 3 gives more details about the 
mathematical models used. Section 4 introduces the system 
implemented and the corresponding scenarios put together to 
test the performances of the system. And eventually, a fifth 
section gives hints for improvements before the conclusion. 
II. 
SYSTEM AND DATA SOURCES 
This section presents the overall idea of the described 
system along with the different data sources handled. 
A. General Idea 
The concept presented here is about data exchange 
between road infrastructures. While equipped with a set of 
sensors, each intersection can produce some knowledge 
about the vehicular situation at its surroundings. These data 
are valuable and require important resources to be generated 
but are also generally thrown away as soon as the detection 
is lost. Thus, the idea is to keep this awareness and to share 
it with other intersections in order to simulate sensor inputs 
for connected intersections. Based on this, a detection and 
prediction process are put together to anticipate the arrival of 
the travelling announced vehicle. In this paper, the 
performance of such a system are questioned and results are 
showed. The intention is to create an anonymous track of 
vehicles on the road, while alleviating the computed 
detection task of each intersection. 
B. Data sources 
Sensors chosen to gather data at intersection are 
DSRC and LiDARs. Both represent popular sensors adapted 
to the automotive industry. They can get data about all kind 
of vehicles with a stronger confidence for connected 
vehicles. 
1) DSRC 
DSRC is a vehicular communication protocol based 
on broadcasting messages, called Basic Safety Messages 
(BSM), 
to 
inform 
connected 
entities 
within 
the 
communication range about vehicles intentions [8]. It 
participates in the creation of an ad hoc network of vehicles, 
exchanging data in order to evolve in a secure environment. 
Among the information contained in every BSM, the 
position of the emitting vehicles, its current speed and 
acceleration are the ones that are the most interesting for this 
work. By gathering those data, it will be possible to keep an 
awareness of all connected vehicles present at the 
intersection. 
An important note to make here is that this paper is 
not focused on disputing communication scheme. This point 
may be addressed in future works. That’s why, at this point, 
all communications are assumed perfect. 
2) LiDAR 
LiDAR is an active light-sensitive sensor that allows 
detection of obstacles in a specific field of view. Its strength 
rests on its ability to give accurate information of obstacle 
detected up to hundreds of meters [9]. It has the advantage 
of providing distance data and performing by day or night. 
But it may be affected by extreme weather (heavy rains, 
fogs) and some reflective surfaces. 
3) Intersection data 
Intersection data corresponds to the addition we are 
putting forward in this paper. It corresponds to the shared 
information that each intersection will send to other adjacent 
intersections. These data are based on the prior output of any 
detection and classification algorithm achieved by other 
sensors: the LiDAR and DSRC in this case. 
From its knowledge, any intersection will be able to 
determine leaving vehicles with their status: exit used, last 
speed and acceleration measured. It will then inform 
connected intersections of the arrival of a new vehicle. Upon 
reception 
of 
the 
intersection 
message, 
the 
target 
infrastructure is expected to build a continuous prediction 
model corresponding to the evolution of the anticipated 
vehicle until it appears in the field of detection of its own 
sensors (if it appears). 
A big interest of this new element relies on the fact 
that it can convey any type of data for any detected object 
that the intersection is capable of detecting. With LiDARs 
and DSRC chosen, each intersection should be able to detect 
any vehicle passing by the intersection, with a stronger 
belief in detection of connected vehicles. Although, 
intersections can only send data about vehicles monitored: it 
will not be able to predict the apparition of a newcomer.

III. 
MATHEMATICAL MODELS 
This section focuses on a description of the equations 
used in the processing of the data from each described 
sensor. 
A. Cluster and single detection 
1) LiDAR 
Simulated LiDARs in SCANeR Studio 1.7 return a 
matrix of all distances measured by each programmed beam 
including: obstacles: vehicles as well as roads and 
signalization sign. For the environment set in this simulation 
and to minimize the data processing task, a 375-beam 
configuration has been chosen. It corresponds to a matrix of 
15 rows and 75 columns, each beam separated by 3 degrees. 
This configuration ensures best processing performance but 
shows less accurate detections at long distance where beams 
are widely separate, increasing the detected position error. 
Two lidars, face to face, are monitoring each intersection as 
represented in Fig. 1. All measures returned are perfect. 
In the context of a static LiDAR placed at a known 
position, detecting new object 
L
C  in the environment can be 
made by taking a capture of the empty intersection 
CRef
 and 
comparing each new capture 
Cc
 with this reference 
(capture). 
L
Ref

C

C

(1) 
This method works well in a simulated environment 
with a few possibilities of noise due to uncontrolled 
elements appearing in the scenario. Thus, to reduce these 
possibilities, a filter is required. In this case, where this 
problem is not specifically approached, a simple two-bound 
threshold is applied to guarantee that all detected objects 
may correspond to vehicles. From the resulting matrix 
L
C , 
we can retrieve clusters of active beams corresponding to 
detected obstacles. The isolation of each of these clusters, in 
each column of a new matrix 
L
SC , allows the inference of 
listing spatial points forming each cluster. Hence, each 
cluster can be assimilated to a single center of gravity and its 
possible dimensions in final LiDAR detection matrix

2) DSRC 
Data returned by the DSRC correspond to position, 
speed and acceleration of connected vehicles. From this, a 
simple noise µ corresponding to GPS error (set to five 
meters) is applied to the perfect position returned by the 
system [10].

For synchronization purpose, BSMs are supposed to 
be all send at the same time and queued by the nearest 
intersections in communication range. Target intersection 
will then be able to build the current vehicle situation 
according to this input. 
3) Intersection data 
Intersection data depend on the result of the data 
fusion of all providing sources. Once this data fusion gives 
the current result, obstacles are located within the 
intersection and if some of them are flagged as leaving at a 
specific exit, then last fused data 
lF  are sent to the 
corresponding intersection.

(7) 
Where 
l
Pos  correspond to the fused coordinate of 
leaving object l , 
lv  to its last registered speed and 
la  to its 
last registered acceleration. 
The broadcasted data corresponds to the set of objects 
leaving the intersection at the specific exit. It mainly 
contains the moment of exit and, if available, the speed and 
acceleration of the object. This last data may not be 
accessible in the case of a non-connected vehicle, as no 
tracking is implemented for objects detected by LiDARs. 
Upon reception of any intersection data, the target 
intersection is expected to resort to a prediction model of the 
listed vehicles possibly incoming. At this stage, each 
intersection knows the position of each connected 
intersection, the configuration of the road section in between 
(topology and speed limit) and the last position and possible 
speed and acceleration of the departing object are known by 
the target intersection. 
For this simple scenario, the prediction part of a 
simple Kalman Filter is applied. In order to do so, the 
linearization of the vehicle dynamic is done by projecting 
the three Cartesian position coordinates to a single straight 
road between both involved intersections. In the case of this 
particular scenario topology, reducing the location to a one-
dimensional problem (represented by variable 
kd ) is made 
by a compelling projection corresponding to the Manhattan 
distance (8) between the two involved intersections (with 
target intersection as origin).

(8) 
This projection gives a rather good estimate of the 
position of the vehicle during time but rests on the need of a 
mapping table. Then, the prediction part of the Kalman filter 
is applied with all known data.

B. Data fusion 
Data fusion is applied on three nodes, as in Fig. 2: 
- 
Between data from both LiDARs  
- 
Between data from LiDAR and intersection data 
(IT Data) 
- 
Between previous fused data and DSRC 
All three of these data fusion correspond to a data 
association processed with a method inspired from the 
covariance intersection method [11]. The principle is to get 
both the set of position and covariance matrix measured or 
predicted in detection methods above and trying to find the 
best match between each sensor to fuse. Covariance

It is to be noted that each captured data frame is 
considered independent of the others. For this purpose, no 
tracking was implemented during active detection of mobile 
entities, except when the detected vehicle was considered as 
leaving the intersection. Region-based comparisons grant 
this distinction and trigger a tracking process where a 
Kalman Filter is used to follow leaving vehicles. 
IV. 
EXPERIMENT AND RESULTS 
This section depicts the configuration of the scenarios 
built to tests this system, the experiments conducted, and the 
results obtained. 
A. System presentation 
For the purpose of this article, a simulated 
environment has been built using the vehicular simulator 
SCANeR Studio from AVSimulation. This environment 
consists of a succession of three intelligent intersections 
highlighted in Fig. 3. While all these intelligent intersections 
are equipped with sensors, we focus the study on the 
intersection in the middle. The other intelligent intersections 
are assumed to host perfect sensors and only their detection 
outputs are sent to the monitored intersection.

Figure 4. DSRC Entries and exits of each intersection. 
This simulated topography is based on the modern 
representation of urban road network with a Manhattan grid 
network. It also allows easier distance calculation when 
needed. However, the vehicle flow is limited to few vehicles 
compared to real urban scenarios where hundreds of vehicles 
may be present. This scenario will be used as an early stage 
of the concept introduced. 
All three of these intersections are identical and 
composed of four pairs of entries/exists following two axes, 
as shown in Fig. 4: north-south and east-west. Each of these 
entries is marked by a stop sign and contains two lanes: left 
lane allows only left turn while right lane allows all 
remaining other directions. 
The scenario also contains four vehicles of different 
dimensions driving within the intersections and following a 
specific pre-defined path assigned to each of them. 
For the processing part of each intersection, control 
models have been implemented externally to compute all 
exchanged data. Simulated environment and control models 
communicate through UDP and are synchronized so that 
reaction models depend on the vehicular simulator outputs. 
In this regard, these models are configured to ran at a faster 
rate than the simulator to efficiently process all data in due 
time. 
The physical platform is currently only composed of a 
Windows 10 computer running SCANeR Studio version 1.7. 
But this system has been thought so that it can be 
implemented on a real-time platform to perform Software-
In-The-Loop (SIL) based validation. Indeed, data exchange 
through UDP allows the communication with any external 
devices such as, for example, a real-time platform from 
Opal-RT Technologies. This would allow easy handling of 
any synchronization matter within the platform and ensures 
the access to greater computing resources for more complex 
systems. 
B. Experiments details 
Two main experiments will be realized to attest the 
performances of this system. First, the contributions of the 
new system will be observed through the comparison of the 
result of the data fusion with IT Data and with the initial 
output of the lidars data fusion. 
Second, as the main sensors are LiDARs and DSRC, 
the number of connected vehicles may have some effect on 
the performance of the system. For that reason, four 
scenarios are considered in Table 1. 
These scenarios can relate to the evolution of the 
vehicle population with time (DSRC penetration ratio), 
following the progress of the automotive industry. And, as a 
matter of fact, may show the relevance of the proposed 
system. 
Performance factors will correspond to the influence 
of the intersection data on the detection of vehicles entering 
the new intersection. For this analysis, comparison factors 
correspond to: 
- 
Position error of the detected vehicle compared to 
its true position; 
- 
Data covariance ratio between results of data fusion 
with and without Intersection Data.

Three minutes long scenarios corresponding to the 
ones described in Table 1, are monitored. Each of these 
scenarios presents eleven intersection crosses by vehicles 
from the simulation, nine of them announced by other 
intersections. Details about detections made in main 
intersection are registered at each time and saved for 
processing, for a total of 12 GB of data. Next section 
presents a condensed study of this data, depending on the 
comparison factors chosen. 
C. Results and discussions 
From the first experiment, two graphics are generated. 
Fig. 5 presents the distance error between the real position of 
the vehicle and the detected position. Values from the result 
of IT-LiDARs data fusion are compared with LiDARs 
fusion. This measure is limited to each time that a fusion is 
operated with an IT Data and then occurred only when a 
vehicle from another intersection is coming in range of the 
target intersection.  
Fig. 5 shows that the fusion with IT Data tends to 
move detections away from their true position with some 
extreme cases as for the third successful fusion attempt 
where the resulting fusion comes from two separated 
vehicles detected by each sensors with a covariance large 
enough for the data fusion algorithm to consider it possible. 
However, the average distance error of the IT-LiDARs 
fusion results (counting the wrong fusion) remains around 
ten meters, still corresponding to a standard GPS error.  
On the other hand, Fig. 6 shows the ratio of 
covariance for the same detections as before, comparing 
results from the LiDARs fusion and results from IT-LiDARs 
fusion. It shows that in second case, the covariance is 
reduced in average by approximatively thirty percent. This 
implies a better precision of the detection even with a bigger 
distance error to the real position. The fusion error specified 
earlier can also be observed in this new graphic where the 
covariance ratio exceed one in value. Furthermore, another 
exceeding value can be observed which also corresponds to 
a fusion error. This gives hint of improvement for the 
algorithm. 
The second experiment focuses more on the study of 
the impact on the system of communicating vehicles. From 
it, we obtain both boxplots diagram in Fig. 7 and 8. In this 
case, all detections are considered, and pertinent data are 
summarized in presented graphs. 
Fig. 7 presents the distance errors between detected 
and real position of vehicles for each scenario described in 
Table 1. And Fig. 8 details the covariance ratio between the 
scenarios with IT Data and the ones without it. Results 
obtained allow to confirm the ones obtained in the previous 
experiment: slight distance shift of the detection position and 
better covariance ratio. Also, what is more interesting to 
notice here is the relative absence of changes between the

different scenarios. From this observation, we can conclude 
that the system is quite robust against the variation of 
communicating vehicles and allow to perform a relatively 
more precise detection of all vehicles in the vicinity of the 
intersection. 
The scenario presented for this system is simple and 
does not take into consideration all variations that may 
happen in most real-life scenario: vehicles driving through 
the road network may leave at any moment without any 
warnings, stop in a place between two intersections or even 
face any sort of possible obstacles that may slow down its 
progression. All those possible outcomes will have an 
impact on the system, resulting in the loss of the data 
gathered about this vehicle or its mix with other data from 
another vehicle circulating on the same road sections. The 
first case does not represent much trouble as following 
detection of the vehicle will only be considered as new. 
However, the second case might lead to some data mismatch 
which may affect the detected behavior of vehicles on some 
road sections between intersections. The comparison of the 
results obtained in these simulations with the data from real-
life scenarios is of great interest and will be the topic of a 
future work. It is to be noted that some adjustments may be 
needed to guarantee that the vehicular simulator can handle 
further vehicle loads in order to match more realistic urban 
scenarios. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  
Among all the assumptions made in this work, 
communications are considered perfect which surely affect 
positively the results presented. A more realistic simulation 
should involve more realistic communication models. That’s 
why it would be necessary to switch to a later version of the 
vehicular simulator used or even add an intermediary 
software specialized in communications and include DSRC 
to enhance the current model. 
Detection algorithms used in this work lacks 
optimization. 
The 
covariance 
intersection 
method 
implemented searches only for a possible fusion result and 
elect the best choice based on the largest common 
covariance area between two detections. Better adjustments 
could be made to enhance the potential of this data fusion 
and reduce the covariance factors of detections. 
On a similar thought, the Kalman prediction 
performed to follow vehicles between intersections is also 
open to better performances. Some pre-study of typical 
vehicle dynamic evolution could be used to set a speed 
profile for better anticipation. This could contribute to real 
improvement of the results gathered in this work and lead to 
an acceleration of the detection. 
Also, other type of sensors and data fusion methods 
will be applied to guarantee good results of the introduced 
concept. This analysis will be introduced as soon as 
scenarios with heavier vehicle load will be implemented for 
closer fidelity to urban scenario. 
To conclude, the work presented in this article 
introduces a different handling of the data gathered by 
intelligent road infrastructures in urban area. The recycling 
of old detection data towards the whole intersection network 
was presented as a mean of preparation for smart cities to 
welcome intelligent and automated driving vehicles among 
other vehicles. Results presented have demonstrated that the 
system is effective with no regards to the number of 
communicating vehicles present. It still needs to be 
improved but already has some interesting outputs when 
applied to the discussed scenarios.
