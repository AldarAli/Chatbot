Abstract—This Cognitive radio has proved to be a promising 
solution to improve the utilization of the radio spectrum. This 
new concept allows different wireless networks to operate on 
the same spectrum bandwidth. An efficient power control is 
thus crucial to make this coexistence possible and beneficial. In 
fact, unlicensed users (or secondary users, SUs) should 
communicate without harming the Primary users’ (PUs) 
transmissions. In this paper, we propose a new power control 
mechanism for the SUs based on a powerful mathematical tool, 
the Game Theory. Our algorithm is based on a non-
cooperative supermodular power control game in which we 
define a new utility function under total transmit power 
constraint, but also under interference constraint. We prove 
the existence of the Nash Equilibrium analytically and by 
means of simulations. 
Keywords- cognitive radio networks; game theory; power 
allocation; supermodular game. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
The wireless networking technologies are evolving 
rapidly in a very diverse manner (e.g., 3G+ [2] and 4G [3] 
cellular networks). This dramatic increase of the demand for 
spectral bandwidth and quality service is limited by the 
scarcity of spectrum resources. The CR (Cognitive radio) [4] 
is viewed as an effective approach for improving the 
utilization of the radio spectrum. The main idea of CR is to 
make secondary users (SUs), equipped with smart radios, 
able to sense the environment, detect the unused spectrum 
resources (spectrum holes) and decide when and how to 
access these holes. The CR also permits to the SUs to have 
underlay access to spectrums at the same time with the 
primary user, without causing harmful interference to the 
latter. Therefore, new challenges related to spectrum sharing 
appear especially how to design efficient power allocation 
and channel assignment schemes.  
 Many researches were conducted to resolve the topic of 
power control for Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) with 
the powerful mathematical tool the Game Theory [1]. In fact, 
Game Theory, having proved its efficiency in economics, 
was introduced lately to solve problems related to radio 
resource allocation in telecommunications [1]. This 
instrument helps study the complex interactions among 
independent players in order to optimize the setting of 
various elements of the network. More precisely, the players 
can be the SUs in a CRN, and the various elements are the 
SUs’ transmit power. Game Theory will thus help us to 
design and to resolve the topic of power control for underlay 
SUs’ transmission in presence of PUs under interference 
level constraint. It will also allow us to investigate the 
existence and convergence to a steady state operating point 
called Nash Equilibrium (NE), when the SUs perform 
independent distributed adaptations in terms of transmit 
power. 
Some power control games are non-cooperative games, 
such [5] and [6]. In these games, selfish users choose their 
transmit power and attempt to maximize their individual 
utilities without being careful about the impact of their 
strategies on other users. A typical solution to a non-
cooperative game is the Nash Equilibrium Point (NEP) [1], 
which is an equilibrium point where each player has no 
chance to increase its utility by unilaterally deviating from 
this equilibrium.  Saraydar et al. [5] propose a non-
cooperative power control game model in CDMA networks 
and proves the existence and uniqueness of Nash 
equilibrium. Zhou et al. [6] considered the problem of joint 
power and rate control for SUs in cognitive radio network by 
using non-cooperative game theory given a certain QoS 
requirement of SUs. Rasti et al. [7] proposed a non-
cooperative power game with pricing that is linearly 
proportional to the signal-to-interference ratio. Del Re et al. 
[8] present a power resource allocation technique based on 
game theory, considering mainly Potential Games. Such 
power allocation is aimed to the up-link communication in a 
centralized CRN. Jing and Zheng [9] presented a game 
theoretic solution for uplink resource allocation in multi-cell 
OFDMA systems. Steady state and convergence are 
analyzed with potential game. The game can be modeled as a 
potential game to guarantee the convergence of NE. Del Re 
et al. [10] provided an S-Modular game in order to solve the 
resource sharing between the PU and the SU in a distributed 
and fair way. Elias et al. [11] use the Game Theory to 
address the spectrum access for the SUs taking into account 
the congestion level observed on the available spectrum 
bands. The same authors also proposed [12] a joint pricing 
and network selection scheme in CRNs based on a 
Stackelberg (leaderfollower) game. 
In this paper, we are interested in developing a new 
algorithm based on Game Theory for a distributed power

control in CRNs. This algorithm should allow the SUs to 
transmit without harming the PUs communications and while 
guaranteeing SU’s Quality of Service requirements. We use 
a supermodular game because the latter guarantees the 
existence of at least one NE to reach, according to the 
different best SUs' responses. 
This paper is organized as follows: Section II introduces 
the game model including the system model and formulates 
the optimization problem. In Section III, we describe our 
distributed power allocation algorithm based on our 
proposed supermodular game theoretic. Simulation results 
are given and discussed in Section IV. Finally, Section V 
concludes this paper. 
 
II. 
GAME MODEL 
Game theory analyzes the strategic interactions among 
rational decision makers. Three important components in a 
game model are the set of players, the strategy space of each 
player, and the payoff/utility function, which measures the 
outcome of the game for each player.  
As the cognitive radios are smart terminals that can 
learn from their environment and dynamically modifying 
their transmission parameters in order to optimize their 
performance. Therefore, their interactions can be modeled 
using a non cooperative power control game. In this game 
model,

are their 
strategies, which represents the sets of power allocation that 
inﬂuence their own performance. Pmax is the SU maximum 
power. And, Ui is the desired performance, designed as the 
payoff or utility function. 
A. System Model 
We consider a cognitive radio system in which a 
primary network is consisting of one PU base station and M 
active PUs coexists on one hand, and a secondary cognitive 
network made by N SUs equipped with CRs in a spectrum 
underlay manner on the other hand. SUs can simultaneously 
transmit with PUs but have to strictly control their transmit 
power to avoid harmful interference with PUs.  We denote 
each transmitter and its intended receiver pair by a single 
index i (i = 1,…., M), referred to as a user. For simplicity, 
we neglect the interference from other adjacent cells. Thus, 
for each pair of SUs (vi, vj) located within mutual 
communication range, the signal-to-interference-and-noise 
ratio (SINR) received at user i can be written as:

where hii and pi  are respectively the channel gain, and the 
power level for the ith player SU, in watts and is a parameter 
that we used in this paper for power control between [0, 
pmax].  hji is the cross channel gain from transmitter j to 
receiver i. The channel gain is determined by the log-normal 
shadowing path loss model. Pj is the transmission power of 
other SU different from SU i. and pm is the transmission 
power of PUs and 
2
σ is the additive white Gaussian Noise 
power (watts).  Then, the transmission rate of the SU i at 
time t is:

                                  (2) 
where η is the SNR gap and it is related to the BER, bit 
error rate. It is given by  η = – 1.5 / ln(5*BER)[12]. 
B. Utility Function Design 
In this section, we seek to design a proper utility 
function that not only reflects the benefit of the player but 
also facilitates the implementation of power control 
algorithms in terms of convexity and global convergence. 
The key is to find utility expressions that are not only 
physically meaningful for a CRN but mathematically 
attractive for ensuring global convergence to the NEP [13] as 
well. In this paper, we adopt the R(t) in eq.(2) as the QoS 
metric for SU players and accordingly construct the novel 
utility function Ui as an SINR-related form. The utility 
function represents the future benefit that a player will 
achieve when adopting a certain strategy, i.e., power 
allocation. However, the overall network optimum is usually 
not achieved at the NEP, since selﬁsh users are only 
interested in the individual benefit. To improve the 
efficiency of the NE of non-cooperative games in CRNs, 
pricing can be introduced when designing the non-
cooperative game, in order to guide the selﬁsh users to a 
more efficient NE [14]. 
Each SU maximizes its own data rate at the cost of high 
power consumption, which causes interference to other SUs 
and brings down their data rate. In order to keep a SU from 
selﬁshly transmitting the highest transmit power, the system 
should first impose certain throughput fairness among the 
SUs, but also a pricing function. In our paper, we propose 
that this pricing function reflects constraints on the SU 
transmit power as well as constraints on the interference 
level caused on a PU. The utility function is therefore 
expressed by:

where Ri is the achieved SU throughput, β is a positive

pi. The second part of (3), α him pi, considers the interference 
caused on the PU m by the user SU i. The constraint (a) 
reflects the minimum required quality of service for each

interference caused at the PU should be below a predefined 
threshold Ith.

C. Existence of Nash Equilibrium 
The NE gives the best strategy given that all the other 
players stick to their equilibrium strategy too. However, the 
question is how to ﬁnd the Nash equilibrium, especially 
when the system is implemented in a distributed manner. 
One approach is to let players adjust their strategies 
iteratively based on accumulated observations as the game 
unfolds, and hopefully the process could converge to some 
equilibrium point. 
The NE is the steady state in the game, in which no 
player can increase its utility function from unilaterally 
deviating its action. However, it does not follow that there is 
a NE in every game. Therefore, it becomes necessary to 
prove the existence of NE. For example, when the game can 
be modeled as a super modular game, convergence to the NE 
is guaranteed. 
Theorem: 
Our proposed game model can be shown as a 
supermodular game.  
Proof: 1) Since [0, Pmax] is a compact subset of R, 2) 
Also, for the range of 0≤ Pi ≤Pmax, the utility function is 
continuous. 3) In addition, the utility function chosen has an 
attractive property: it is twice differentiable. The remaining 
condition that we should check is whether ∂2U(Pi)/∂Pi∂Pj> 
0 or not.

  . According to the definition and 
property of game modes, this game is a supermodular game 
and therefore must be at least one NE in this supermodular 
game.  
D. 
Solution of the game 
Since the existence of NE was proved, we consider the 
problem of how to identify it. The optimal transmit power or 
NE can be obtained in such a way that each SU maximizes 
its own utility function iteratively. The problem can be 
expressed s follow:

It should be noted that there is no sufficient guarantee in 
this game with regard to constraint (a), (b) and (c) of the 
problem (P1). First, the protection of PU should be assured 
by keeping the interference below a threshold, and the rigid 
SINR requirement of each SU must be respected especially if 
the SU experiences strong interference. In the next section, 
we will give details to solve this problem. 
III. 
DISTRIBUTED POWER ALLOCATION GAME 
In this section, an algorithm based on Lagrange 
techniques is developed to solve (4). This algorithm will 
have provable convergence and is suitable for distributed 
implementation. Because the model relates the optimum 
solution with 3 constraint conditions, let λi and μi denote

IV. 
PERFORMANCES EVALUATION 
To evaluate the performances of the proposed algorithm, 
the simulations have been performed with a reduced number 
of users. Just one PU receiver has been placed in the 
scenario, while at most five SUs have been considered for 
the secondary system. The cell radius is R = 500m. The 
propagation model takes into consideration of path loss and 
frequency selective fading. The background noise δ2 is 5 × 
10−15 Watts. The transmit power of PU is 10Watts .In such a 
scenario, the game converges quickly to the Nash 
equilibrium after 2-3 iterations. 
First, we examine the convergence performance of the 
proposed game model in terms of SU transmit power. Fig. 1 
illustrates the evolution of the SU transmit power for the five 
secondary users. It shows that the transmit power for each 
SU converges to the steady state. From this figure, we 
observe that there all the five SUs are transmitting with 
reasonable at the maximum power. This can not only 
enhance the power consumption for these SUs but also 
reduced the level of the interference to the PU. The 
limitation of the overall interference in the system is thus 
achieved.  
Fig. 2 illustrates the achieved throughput by the different 
SUs versus their quality of service requirement in terms of 
BER. In fact, these SUs have not only satisfied the quality of 
service requirements but also realized a total throughput in 
the system of almost 14 Mbps.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
 
In this paper, a non cooperative power control game is 
investigated for CR networks under quality of service and 
interference constraints. More precisely, we have introduced 
a new utility function in which the constraint on the 
interference caused by the SU to the PU is considered as well 
as the SU transmit power limitation. We have proved the NE 
for our game, and gave a distributed power control algorithm 
that converges to the NE. 
The proposed algorithm used a pricing-based game to 
achieve the efficient power control which resulted in the 
maximum throughput for the cognitive network and 
respected the interference limitation as well. In the future, we 
intend to efficiently modify the price function so that we 
could maximize the throughput without altering the transmit 
power. Also, we intend to maximize the overall system 
throughput using cooperation between SUs.
