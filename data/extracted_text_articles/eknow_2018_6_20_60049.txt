Abstract—The digitization of manga (Japanese comics) is cur-
rently progressing. In the past, expressions of manga have evolved
in a way that is suitable for printing on paper. With the spread of
smartphones, the expression of e-manga is developing at present.
In this research, we focus on reader comments on e-mangas in
Comico. Comico is a popular e-manga service. Similar to other
online contents services, such as YouTube, Comico implements
a user comments system. Readers can post comments easily,
and the comments quickly reach others, including the manga
creator. Comico recognizes that reader comments may inﬂuence
the creator and the story of e-manga. In this research, we try
to mine the empathy factor of readers for the story and the
characters of e-manga. We collect reader comments and apply
feature selection of SVM (Support Vector Machine) to mine
empathy factors among readers.

INTRODUCTION
The digitization of manga (Japanese comics) is currently
progressing. In the past, expressions of manga have evolved
in a way that is suitable for printing on paper. With the spread
of smartphones, the expression of e-manga is developing at
present. In the past, most e-manga were digitized by image
scanning from paper manga. At present, some smartphone-
oriented expressions of e-manga are developing. Many e-
manga applications for smartphones are being released.
The authors of the present paper are interested in on-
line contents services. We analyzed a video recommendation
method using comments for videos on nicovideo.jp [1], and
proposed statistical analysis of video page views [2]. In
addition, we have been studying the number of bookmarks
and recommendation of novels using the link structure of
bookmarks for the online novel site syosetu.com. Recently,
we also analyzed the diversity trend of online novels [3].
In this paper, we focus on reader comments on e-mangas
in Comico [4]. Comico is a popular e-manga service in Japan,
and e-mangas in Comico are specialized for smartphone.
Among the e-manga smartphone applications, the Comico app
is the second most popular in Japan as of February 2017.
Similar to other online contents services, such as YouTube,
Comico implements a user comments system. Readers can
post comments easily, and comments quickly reach to others
including the manga creator. Comico recognizes that reader
comments may inﬂuence the creator and the story of e-manga.
If a system can mechanically extract the factors readers
empathizes with, it may become a good support tool for
creation of e-manga. Toward realization of empathy factor
extraction, we apply the SVM (Support Vector Machine)
feature selection method [5] to reader comments, and extract
important words.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
shows related work. In Section III, we describe the service and
contents of Comico brieﬂy, and show some statistics. Section
IV shows comment crawler and preprocessing. In Section VI,
we illustrate our feature selection method and some results of
analysis. Section V presents in detail of “ReLIFE”, which is
an e-manga on Comico. We use comments for this e-manga
as the ﬁrst analysis. We describe the empathy factor extraction
using feature selection of SVM in Section VI. Finally, Section
VIII presents a brief summary and future work.

RELATED WORK
Sentiment analysis of a story and of readers response
is a hot topic of text mining. Murakami et al. proposed a
method to associate characters in the story with frequently
appeared words which represent character’s personality [6].
They manually input character names and many co-occurred
sentences in manga. Then they apply co-occurrence analysis.
The readers response is out of their target of the analysis.
Emotional analysis of manga and manga readers is another
new genre gaining much attention. Writers and readers can
use a new style of visual communication different from textual
words. In [7], Cohn and Ehly analyze the visual vocabulary
appearing in the Japanese manga. They extracted 73 visual
expressions that have been used in Japanese manga. It shows
that these are also used in 20 volumes selected from boys
and girls manga. In our case, many emojes (pictograms) are
included in comments, but we are not addressing emotional
expressions in this paper. When analyzing emotions, Cohn’s
study can be used.
Instead of using words in comments, stamps are gaining
much attention in casual communication such as WathsApp
[8] and LINE [9]. For example, Dharma et al. are studying
how to use manga (cartoon) for communication in SNS (Social
Network System) [10]. SNS is the world’s largest community.
It realizes various kinds of two-way communication and vari-
ous news distribution. Dharma et al. proposed manga picture in
SNS to improve their satisfaction in hobby ﬁelds. The Comico
reader comment covered by this paper unilaterally describes
the thought of the reader, so it is not used for interaction
between readers or between authors and readers.

A. Features of Comico
Comico [4] was established by “NHN comico” company
in October 2013. According to a survey in February 2017 by
Nielsen [11], Comico is the second largest user in Japan, and
about 2.6 million people use it. (The ﬁrst is LINE manga, 2.99
million users).
The most unique feature of Comico different from other e-
manga services is that Comic only serves smartphone oriented
original e-mangas. Almost all e-mangas on Comico are full-
colored, and all e-mangas on Comico are able to browse just by
swiping it from the top to the bottom. Comico does not serve
e-manga which digitized past paper manga. For this reason, it
does not need to move e-manga in the left-right direction, like
a paper book.
Another feature is the use of reader comments. According
to a news release from Comico, some e-manga creator used
comments to measure reader’s impression and used comments
as a tool of interaction between readers and the creator.
Comico e-mangas are divided into three ranks: ofﬁcial,
best challenge and challenge. Newcomers’ manga is serial-
ized as a challenge work. When popularity comes out, then
it is elected as best challenge rank. When an e-manga in
best challenge rank is given quality and popularity, it arises to
the ofﬁcial rank. Table I shows restrictions of comico e-manga
in each rank, and Table II shows the number of e-mangas for
each type.

B. Genre and tags
To improve searching and grouping, every e-manga on
Comico is given tags by the manga creator. A tag represents
genre, rank in Comico (ofﬁcial or challenge), and keywords.
A tag is used like a hashtag in Twitter (a tag forms # and a
word). Table III shows 12 genre tags used in Comico. Table

than the total number of works shown in Table II because most
e-mangas are given multiple genre tags to hit a search query.

COMMENTS ANALYSIS
A. Comment crawler
To collect comments mechanically, we made a comment
crawler program using Python. This crawler accesses the
comments page of Comico by specifying title ID and episode
ID of the e-manga series, and gets HTML of the web page. It
extracts comment text using XPath from the obtained HTML
page.
The collected comments are reformed and put into a search
engine for later analysis. We extract the comment author name,
the date and time of comment post, and words in a com-
ment using the morphological analysis tool MeCab [12]. We
also implemented e-manga character name extraction function.
Characters are often described by nicknames or abbreviations,
so we assigned candidates of nicknames or abbreviations for
each character.
B. Limitation of comments
As shown in Figure 1, any user can post a comment for an
episode, if the episode is open. So, the older the episode is, the
more comments are posted. We limited comments to 7 days
posted comment for fair analysis. Let Ci =< c1, c2, ..., cn >
be the set of comments posted to i-th episode (ep.i). Posting
date of cn is 7 days later than the date of c1.
C. Attention to characters
We believe that the reader’s empathy for e-mangas in-
ﬂuences manga. We focus on reader’s response towards the
characteristic of hero and heroines of the manga. Kazuo Koike,
who is a famous story creator, said at the beginning of his
108
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2018.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-620-0
eKNOW 2018 : The Tenth International Conference on Information, Process, and Knowledge Management

book [13]. “Manga is character. If the character is catchy, the
manga will be popular. If you create a catchy character, the
character will be loved by many readers. And readers want
to meet the character, then the manga will be sold and series
of the manga will continue.” We agree with his opinion and
investigate whether the readers empathize with the characters
of manga.
In this research, we consider that if a character name
appears in a reader comment, then the commenter may have
empathy with the character. In real world events such as sports,
entertainments, and politics, people may show support for a
person, team or party by using written placards which display
their name. When a person empathizes with a person, a team,
or a party, then they write their names on placard to show it.
In other words, describing the name of an entity indicates that
the descriptor may be interested in the entity.
D. Character frequency
We take df(K) as the metrics of readers empathy to
character K, where df(K) is the document frequency of
character K. In other words, df(K) is the number of comments
which include K’s name at least one time in the comment.
Most comments are short, and there are few comments which
describes a character name multiple times. Also, there are few
commenter who posts multiple comments to one episode.
We also count frequency of co-occurrence of character
K and K′, and we represent it as df(K, K′). In the story
of manga (also novel or movie), the relation between two
characters is important. There are cases where two characters
become lovers, friends, or sports opponents. In manga dealing
with love, the relationship between the two is important
because readers are very interested and empathize with the
progress of their relationship.
V.
RELIFE COMMENTS ANALYSIS
This section describes the analysis of ReLIFE comments.
ReLIFE is an e-manga series on Comico, created by Yayoiso
[14], and it is ongoing Japanese science fantasy high school
drama [15]. ReLIFE is the most popular e-manga in Comico.
Many users read it, and therefore many comments are posted.
So, this is the best example for the ﬁrst comments analysis.
A. Trend of the number of comments
Figure 2 shows the trend of |Ci| for each episode. |Ci|
is the number of posted comments to ep.i (i = 1..215) of
ReLIFE series.
Figure 2 is marked A – E for remarkable spikes. Until
ep.24, the number of comments is small. ReLIFE was not
popular in the early stage of the series, then a few readers
posted comments. In period A (ep.25–27), 　 an event to
present gifts to commenters was held. So, a lot of comments
are posted. In period B (ep.39–40), the author notiﬁed that the
paper book of ReLIFE will release. At D (ep.118), the number
of comments is the highest. The story reached its ﬁrst climax.
At E (ep.144), the author notiﬁed that ReLIFE will be made
a TV animation drama. At F (ep.187), the author notiﬁed that
ReLIFE will be made into a movie. So, we found that ReLIFE
readers reacted to the climax of the story, announcements of
TV animation dorama and movie, or to the event which the
creator / the company prepared.
B. Trend of characters
Table V shows the main 6 characters of ReLIFE. They are
high school students in the same grade and in the same class.
They look like 17 years old, but characters 1 and 3 are adults
(27 years old), because they are rejuvenated with a special
medicine ’relife’.

Figure 5 shows df(K) of character K for each ReLIFE
episode (ep.1–127). To quantitatively measure readers’ em-
pathy for characters, we consider frequency (the number of
appearances) of character name in comments. Character 1
“Kaizaki” is the main character, then he is generally frequent.
In ep.27, sub-character Oga (character 5) is rapidly increasing.
The reason will be clariﬁed in Section VII-A.
Figure 6 shows df(K, K′) for each episode (ep.1–127).
df(K, K′) is document frequency of co-occurrence of charac-
ter K and K′ in comments. There are 15 combination pairs for
the characters 1 to 6 in Table V, and investigated co-occurrence
frequency of all 15 pairs. Figure 6 shows the highest co-
occurring eight pairs.
VI.
FEATURE SELECTION
In previous section, we understood what the reader em-
pathized with, because we knew ReLIFE and checked the
comments in detail. However, it is not efﬁcient to apply manual
analysis to all e-mangas. If a system can mechanically extract
the factors of why reader empathizes, it may become a good
support tool for creation of e-manga.
It is well known that SVM (Support Vector Machine) is a
machine learning method that achieves good prediction perfor-
mance compared with other methods. Moreover, SVM shows
superior results when we combine it with feature selection.
For example, Wariish et al. analyzed sales report using SVM,
decision tree, and random forests [16]. The best result was
obtained with SVM and feature selection.
Toward realization of the empathy factor extraction, we ap-
ply the SVM feature selection method [5] to reader comments
and extract important words. We used SVM-light [17] with
liner kernel, and with default parameters. We applied SVM
assuming that all the comments containing a character K as
positive data, and other comments are negative data.
A. Bag-of-words vectorization
To apply SVM, each comment must be vectorized. We
vectorize comments using bag-of-words [18]. Figure 3 shows
the outline of vectorization of documents (comments).
B. Extraction of feature words
We extracted feature words from the learning result of
SVM [18]. SVM is a common method of machine learning for
binary classiﬁcation. Let input data be x = (x1, x2, · · · , xm),

Figure 3. BoW vectorization of documents
and two classes be +1 (positive) and -1 (negative). Then
boundary function f(x) of SVM is described as follows:
f(x) = wT x + b,
(1)
where w = (w1, w2, · · · , wm) is weight vector and b is
threshold. w and b are obtained by SVM machine learning.
Binary classiﬁcation works as follows. Given a vector x,
and calculate f(x) using obtained weight vector and threshold.
If f(x) ≥ 0, then x is classiﬁed as positive, else classiﬁed as
negative.
Next, we explain the method of feature words selection.
At ﬁrst, vectorize documents, and train SVM using training
vectors. Next, give positive examples and negative example to
the SVM. After that, calculate the importance of a word by
using the weight for the word. The importance of word xi is
weight wi in the weight vector generated by SVM training.
In [16], an experiment of feature selection is also per-
formed. Let S = (x1, x2, · · · , xm) be a set of words rearranged
in descending order of the importance of words. m is the
number of unique words which appear in documents. Then,
the speciﬁc procedure is as follows:
I.
Let W ′ = ϕ and i = 1.
II.
While i ≤ N, do the following steps.
◦
If i is even: W ′ = W ′ ∪ xm+1−i/2,
If i is odd : W ′ = W ′ ∪ x(i+1)/2.
◦
Vectorize documets only using the words in
W ′.
◦
Train SVM and evaluate classiﬁcation perfor-
mance of SVM by using 5-fold cross valida-
tion.
◦
i = i + 1 and go back to II.
It is able to specify important words by comparing the
classiﬁcation performance in case of SVM of all words or a
part of words.

EXTRACTED EMPATHY FACTOR OF CHARACTERS
First, we vectorized all comments as shown in Figure 3.
The number of all reader comments are 559,685, and the
number of dimensions of a vector was 104,302. This means
that there are 104,302 unique words in the set of comments.
SVM feature selection method needs to divide a document
set into positive examples and negative examples. To extract
the empathy factor of a character K, we set that positive
examples are comments which include character K at least
once, and other comments are negative examples. Extracting
positive feature words are co-occurred with character K in
reader’s comments.
In [5], the score of a word is determined from the SVM
model that separates the positive data the negative data. The
score of a word represents the distance from the hyperplane.
The characteristic words of positive data have positive scores,
and those of negative data have negative scores. For feature
selection, we choose top N positive words and bottom N
negative words, as shown in Figure 4.
We applied feature selection method for reader comments
of ReLIFE and extracted feature words from reader comments
as the empathy factors for the character K.
A. Empathy factor by feature words selection
Table VI shows extracted top 20 positive words for each
ReLIFE characters. Words in Table VI may illustrate what
image or impression readers have for the character K. In Table
VI, words starting with lower case letters are translated into
English, but words beginning with capital letters remain in
Japanese. Original results are Japanese single words because
comments are written in Japanese.

Words for characters 2, 3 and 5 (Hishiro, Yoake and Oga)
are easy to understand. These words express character’s per-
sonality, appearance, and the role in the story of. In the row of
character 5 (Oga), the word “Ogre” frequently appears because
readers enjoy giving a nickname of “Ogre” to character 5
(Oga). On the other hand, characters 1, 4 and 6 (Kaizaki,
Kariu and Onoya) are not easy. Character 1 (Kaizaki) is the
main character, then he plays various roles in order to entered
various situations. The role of character 6 (Onoya) is not yet
decided in the story.
B. Performance of feature words selection
Table VII shows the results of classiﬁcation performance
of SVM. The 4th column in Table VII shows the number of
words when F-measure becomes the highest. SVM classiﬁca-
tion accuracy may become highest when using all attributes.
However, classiﬁcation accuracy is higher when using limited
effective attributes. So, we proposed a method to determine
the optimum number of attributes in the SVM classiﬁcation.
In Table VII, the number of words for max F-measure for
characters 2 and 3 (Hishiro and Yoake) are both 8, and F-
measure are 0.7900 and 0.8399. This means that characters
2 and 3 are able to present only 8 words. In other words,
readers represent them using only 8 words. Actuary, the role
of character 3 (Yoake) is facilitator of the story. Therefore,
there are a few complicated topics for him. On the other hand,
character 2 (Hishiro) is the main heroine. She is drawn as a
cool beauty girl, and she does not act dynamically in the early
part of the story. So, readers refer to her in simple expressions.
In case of character 4 (Kariu) in Table VII, the number of
words for max F-measure is 20, and the value of F-measure
is 0.8981. She is the highest F-measure in this analysis. Mr.
Oga (character 5), his nick name is “Ogre” the number of
words for max F-measure is 30, and the value of F-measure is
0.7924. In the ﬁrst half of the story, their personality is clearly
described, and the two will start dating as a lover. Readers
were empathized in their life story and represented them in
some words.
On the other hand, characters 1 and 6 (Kaizaki and Onoya)
are not clear. Their F-measures are not high, and the number
of words for max F-measure is 70.
VIII.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we focus on reader comments on e-mangas in
Comico. We made a comment crawler program using Python,
and collected a lot of comments from Comico. We showed
statistical trend of comments and document frequency of
characters. Human relations are important in stories, therefore
we counted co-occurrence frequency of the two characters.
We found that there are some spikes for the number of
comments, and we estimated the reason for the rapid increase
of comments.
Toward realization of the mechanical empathy factor ex-
traction for support of e-manga creation of e-manga, we apply
the SVM feature selection method to reader comments and
extract important words. As the result of feature selection, we
extracted words which represent each character. In other words,
what the readers think about each character.
In the future, we want to expand empathy analysis to other
e-mangas. More than 450 e-mangas exist on Comico. We hope
to ﬁnd a difference in empathy factors by genre. We also want
to extract the transition of human relations.
