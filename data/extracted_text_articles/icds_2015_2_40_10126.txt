Abstract— The rigid nature of wavelength division 
multiplexing (WDM) routed networks leads to inefficient 
capacity utilization. Thus, flexible networks are a possible 
breakthrough for Internet technology, as long as they provide 
higher 
spectrum 
efficiency 
use. 
Several 
discrete-time 
simulations were carried out in Matlab in order to analyze 
different spectrum allocation policies (First-Fit, Exact-Fit and 
Random-Fit) in some routing algorithms: The Fragmentation 
Aware Assignment (FA), the Shortest Path with Maximum 
Spectrum Reuse (SPSR) and the Balanced Load Score 
Spectrum Assignment (BLSA). Two network topologies were 
used: a small 6-node subset of Cost239 and a 7-node random 
topology. As physical layer effects were not included as 
constraints, 
Fragmentation 
Aware 
and 
Balanced 
Load 
Spectrum Assignment strongly outperformed Shortest Path 
with Maximum Spectrum reuse, with much better results for 
BLSA. The separation between First-Fit and Exact-Fit curves 
was smaller in SPSR than in FA and BLSA. In general, Exact-
Fit spectrum allocation policy presented slightly better 
performance than First-Fit.

 INTRODUCTION  
The rigid nature of wavelength division multiplexing 
(WDM) routed networks leads to inefficient spectrum 
utilization, a problem that is expected to become much more 
critical with the deployment of higher capacity WDM 
networks. Thus, flexible networks are required to provide 
high spectrum efficiency use in order to achieve scalability, 
reduce network power consumption and decrease per unit 
bandwidth cost.   
Optical Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (O-
OFDM) is one of the promising modulation techniques for 
optical networks. Optical OFDM distributes the data on 
several low data rate subcarriers. The spectrum of adjacent 
subcarriers can overlap, since they are orthogonally 
modulated [1], providing good spectral efficiency, flexibility 
and tolerance to impairments. 
OFDM-based elastic optical networks achieve multiple 
data rate sub-wavelength or super-wavelength paths through 
flexible granular grooming and switching in the spectrum 
domain, using data-rate/bandwidth-variable transponders and 
bandwidth-variable optical cross-connects [2]. 
 
The data-rate/bandwidth-variable transponder provides 
no more than the enough subcarriers to treat sub-wavelength 
traffic. It is also possible to create super-wavelength paths to 
transport multiple-rate data traffic, by merging several 
OFDM channels.  
Transmitted signals are routed over the optical path 
through bandwidth variable optical cross-connects, designed 
to allocate a cross-connection with the suitable spectrum to 
create an appropriate-sized end-to-end optical path.  
The approach of the following sections is directed to 
routing and spectrum allocation algorithms, as long as 
traditional routing and wavelength assignment algorithms 
can no longer be directly applied to establish an elastic 
optical path that uses flexible spectrum width to 
accommodate multi-data rate services. 
Section II defines the routing and spectrum allocation 
problem in flexible optical networks. In Section III, First-Fit, 
Exact-Fit and Random-Fit spectrum allocation policies are 
described in details. Section IV presents the results of the 
deployed simulations. Finally, Section V presents the 
conclusion and the perspectives of this work. 
II. 
ROUTING AND SPECTRUM ALLOCATION 
There is an increasing number of works searching for 
solutions to the elastic optical network Routing and 
Spectrum Allocation (RSA) problem. The RSA treats routing 
and spectrum allocation in order to save spectral resources, 
in an optimized optical network operation. 
The capacity requirement of each connection request is 
characterized by a number of subcarrier slots, based on the 
capacity of the subcarriers. 
Integer Linear Programming formulations are not 
scalable to large networks and many heuristic algorithms 
have 
been 
developed 
to 
treat 
connection 
requests 
sequentially. 
The RSA problem may have an one-step approach or a 
two step-approach. In one-step approach, as in Modified 
Dijkstra's Shortest Path (MSP) and in Spectrum-Constraint 
Path Vector Searching (SCPVS), the algorithms define the 
route and the available contiguous spectrum simultaneously. 
On the other hand, in a two-step approach, routing and 
spectrum assignment are sub-problems that are solved 
sequentially. In the following subtopics, the Fragmentation 
Aware Assignment, the Shortest Path with Maximum 
Spectrum Reuse and the Balanced Load Score Assignment

algorithms are described. After routing, spectrum allocation 
is performed using one of the possible existing policies. 
A. Constraints  
There are several restrictions to be observed in RSA 
problems: The traffic demands for a node-pair should be 
exactly added in the source node and dropped at the 
destination point; one sub-carrier in a fiber can only be used 
to serve one spectrum path; each optical path should use the 
same subcarriers along its entire way; overlapping spectrum 
paths must be separated by a number of subcarriers called 
guard-carriers and, finally, the employed subcarriers in a 
spectrum path must be consecutive in the frequency domain. 
B. Shortest Path with Maximum Spectrum Reuse 
For a given set of spectrum path request pairs, the sub-
carrier reuse can be increased by reducing the maximum sub-
carrier number. Shortest path with maximum spectrum reuse 
(SPSR) algorithm, proposed in [3], combines the shortest 
path routing with the maximum reuse spectrum allocation 
(MRSA) algorithm, where simultaneous spectrum path 
requests are first sorted according to the size of the traffic 
demand and larger traffic demands have higher allocation 
priority.  
C. Balanced Load Score Spectrum Allocation (BLSA) 
Proposed in [3], BLSA determines the routing through a 
load balancing, in order to decrease the maximum subcarrier 
number on a fiber. In the beginning, a k-shortest path 
algorithm is used to generate k paths for each source-
destination pair. Then, a path is selected by estimating the 
load of the fibers. The maximum fiber load (MFL) of each 
path is taken and the better path is the one that presents the 
smaller MFL. Finally, after the path selection, the spectrum 
allocation is made through one of the possible allocation 
strategies (First-Fit, Exact-Fit or Random-Fit, for example). 
In the situation of simultaneous requests, larger traffic 
demands have higher allocation priority over smaller ones.  
 The load of a fiber (FL) can be estimated using the sum 
of the size of all requests, i.e., the total amount of occupied 
slots (SUM) in the considered link, the quantity of guard 
carriers (GC) and the number of optical paths (I) at that fiber, 
according to (1). 
 
                       FL = SUM + GC X (I-1)                          (1)      
D. Fragmentation Aware Routing (FA) 
Fragmentation is not directly related to the spectrum 
utilization but it can be used as a decisive parameter for 
routing. The process of adding and ending connections in a 
non-uniform bandwidth assignment generates an interleaved 
spectrum. Obviously, spectrum fragmentation becomes a 
problem when free resources are broken into portions that 
are smaller than incoming bandwidth requests. Hence, these 
small non-contiguous free frequency bands reduce the 
spectrum efficiency gained by flexibility in the bandwidth 
allocation.  
 
In 
the 
developed 
FA 
algorithm, 
the 
external 
fragmentation formulation, presented in [4], is used to select 
one of the k paths generated by the k-shortest path algorithm 
for each incoming source-destination connection request. 
Thus, a path is selected by the fragmentation estimation of 
each fiber along the way. The maximum fiber fragmentation 
(MFF) of each path must be taken and the chosen path is the 
one that presents the smaller MFF. After the path selection, 
the spectrum allocation is made through one of the possible 
allocation strategies. In the situation of simultaneous 
requests, larger traffic demands have higher allocation 
priority over smaller ones. 
The external fragmentation of a fiber can be calculated 
by (2), where the largest free block (LFB) is the number of 
slots of the largest contiguous free space, and total free (TF) 
is the total amount of free slots.   
                                    
Fext
 = 1 - (LFB/TF)                        (2) 
III. 
SPECTRUM ASSIGNMENT POLICIES 
In elastic optical networks, the assignment of spectrum 
slots is in different granularities to the arriving connection 
requests. 
A first-fit assignment policy serves the request in the first 
available frequency band fitting the spectrum demand, a 
random allocation policy places incoming requests in any 
available block large enough to satisfy the necessary 
bandwidth and an exact-fit assignment, proposed in [4], 
searches for the exact available block in terms of the number 
of slots requested for the connection. If there is no block that 
matches perfectly, the spectrum is allocated in the first 
largest free block available. 
IV. 
RESULTS 
Some simulations were carried out in Matlab to compare 
different 
existing 
routing 
and 
spectrum 
assignment 
algorithms for elastic optical networks. The dynamic events 
were simulated in a 6-node subset of Cost239 and in a 7-
node fiber based structure, as shown in Figures 1 and 2, 
respectively.  
As long as the main purpose of the simulations is to 
compare 
different 
spectrum 
assignment 
policies 
in 
Fragmentation Aware Routing and in Balanced Load 
Spectrum Assignment,  a distance-adaptive modulation level 
selection has not been configured for use. Actually, for each 
source-destination request, the algorithms simply select a 
route and try to allocate the incoming connection in one of 
the available sets of  contiguous frequency slots, according to 
the chosen technique and observing all the constraints. For 
each source-destination pair, routes are chosen from a list 
created by Yen's k-shortest path algorithm.  
Contiguous spectral paths were set to be separated by one 
guard carrier. Each type of connection is represented by one 
of the values in the set C = {4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16}. The 
elements of C are the number of contiguous slots needed to 
satisfy bandwidth requirements. For each one of these 
incoming request types, it has been considered an arrival rate 
following a Poisson distribution.

At each time unit of the simulations, all the incoming 
request types were randomly associated to source-destination 
pairs. 400 spectral slots were defined for each fiber link. The 
service time of each connection follows exponential 
probabilities of Poisson.

CONCLUSIONS 
As non-linear physical layer effects were not included in 
the deployed network simulations, Balanced Load Score 
Spectrum Assignment and Fragmentation Aware Routing 
Techniques strongly outperformed Shortest Path Routing, 
with much better results for BLSA. However, it is essential 
the continuous searching for better formulations and 
strategies over the problem of fragmentation to optimize the 
performance of algorithms that work with it as a decisive 
parameter for routing. In the developed algorithms, only the 
concept of external fragmentation was explored. 
The separation between First-Fit and Exact-Fit curves 
was smaller in SPSR than in BLSA and FA. In general, 
Exact-Fit spectrum allocation policy presented slightly better 
performance than First-Fit. However, as it did not happen in 
all the cases, a much larger number of simulations in other 
topologies is necessary to reach a strong conclusion on this 
matter.  
Thus, future works might include studies on correlation 
between fragmentation and blocking probability, as long as  
other routing and spectrum allocation algorithms.
