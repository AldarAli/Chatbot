Abstract—The present paper discusses an experimental proce-
dure for designing a suitable coating for Microelectromechanical
systems (MEMs) based 3-axis force sensors. Several coating
shapes, sizes and materials were tested. The coated sensors
were calibrated and tested in order to characterize the effect
of the coating on the sensor characteristics such as measurement
dynamic range and resolution, the linearity of the response, as
well as the impulse response of the system. Finally guidelines for
optimal coating of the sensor are proposed.

INTRODUCTION
The
development
of
Microelectromechanical
systems
(MEMs) sensors was a revolution that produced small and
cheap sensors. This technology allowed massive production
of inexpensive and small sensors.
In tactile sensing ﬁeld, force/torque MEMs based sensors
such as presented in [1], [2] and [3] have allowed low cost and
highly integrated touch sensing. This type of sensors has shown
good characteristics such as linear behavior, low hysteresis, and
good accuracy. However, because of their size and fragility,
these systems suffer from two major problems:
•
The sensitive area of these sensors is small
•
The maximal forces and torques that this kind of
system could support is low.
For example, the sensor presented in [1] has a maximum force
of 1 N and the sensor presented in [3] has a maximum force of
2 N. For most tactile applications, such as object manipulation,
in robotics manipulation tasks the range of forces that the
sensor should support must be at least 10 N [4].
To solve the problem of measurement range, one solution
consists in making bigger silicon based sensors, with bigger
supports. However, due to technology considerations, the size
of the sensor can not be big enough to cover a large surface
which doesn’t solve the small sensitive area problem. In
addition, using more silicon would signiﬁcantly increase the
sensor cost. Another possible solution consists in protecting
the sensor with an elastic coating layer, as shown in [5] or [6].
This solution distributes the forces between the sensitive part
of the sensor and the area around which increases the sensor
dynamic range. This solution provides protection to the sensor,
increases the sensitive surface area and enables the sensor to be
interfaced with an external frame for intrinsic tactile sensing
such as presented in a previous work [7].
Coating the sensor can have many drawbacks such as the
introduction of non linearity and hysteresis. Depending on the
used elastic material, a relaxation phenomenon may appear
and signiﬁcantly change the sensor response to external force.
The coating increases the dynamic measurement range by dis-
tributing the force between the sensor and the surface around
which reduces the sensor resolution. Finally, the analysis of the
forces applied on any point of the surface is complex. In [6],
the authors use a spherical coating geometry to create a soft
ﬁngertip. The system could estimate the forces applied during
the contact with an external object as well as detect the early
slippage. In [5], the authors made a speciﬁc geometry to ensure
that the contact is established on the top ﬂat surface of the
coating. Both papers use polyurethane as protection material.
In all review work about the protection of MEMs force
sensors as [5], [6], [8], [9] or [10] they do not analysed
more than one coating, and do not discuss why the speciﬁc
coating shape, size and material has been selected. The goal
of this paper is to provide guidelines for the design and
construction of the coating for MEMs force sensors supported
with experimental results and comparison between various
predeﬁned coatings. The objective is to identify the coating
shape, size and material that provides the lowest alteration to
the sensor characteristics while increasing its dynamic range
and providing protection against high forces.
This paper is organized as follow: Section 2 presents the
3-axis MEMs force sensor used in our experiments as well as
its initial characteristics. Section 3 presents different coatings
used to protect the sensor and as well as their design and
construction process. In Section 4, the characterization of each
protected sensor is presented. In Section 5, the resistance to
high applied forces has been tested for two of the coated
sensors. Finally, optimal coating guidelines are deduced.
II.
3-AXIS FORCE MEMS SENSOR
The force sensor operates on the principle presented in
[5]. This consists of eight strain sensitive elements that are
attached to a stem. All these elements are made of the same
silicon crystal and have a geometry shown in Figure 1.
In this case, the sensor is made of a monocrystalline silicon
element, where the sensitive elements are eight piezoresistors,
i.e., the resistance value varies according to their deformation.
They are made by doping the underside of the silicon mem-
brane. The piezoresistors are divided according to the x and y

resistance value Ri at rest, and are placed so that they are
constrained symmetrically upon application of a force along
an axis x, y or z. Figure 2 shows schematically the deformation
of the membrane during the application of a normal force Fz
or tangential forces Fx, Fy in the plane of the membrane.

Once a force is applied to the stem, the membrane is
warped. This causes the compression or the stretching of the
piezoresistors along x and y axis, leading to a change in their
resistance values. The resistance variation affects the potentials
VA,B,C,D. The three voltages ux, uy and uz proportional to
the applied forces can be calculated as follows:

where a1, a2 and a3 are identiﬁed measurements gains. As

when no forces are applied.
A. Characteristics of the sensor

and tangential forces because of the mono-crystalline nature
of the sensor and the elasticity of silicon. The used sensor has
the following characteristics:

CONSIDERED SENSOR COATING
In order to protect the sensor and increase its sensitivity
range, the sensor was protected as shown in [5]. The protection
is made by deposing an elastic material over the sensor so that
the forces exerted on the material will be distributed between
the sensor and the support.
The chosen elastic material is polyurethane. This choice
is entirely based on previous work results in determining the
proper type of protection, [5] or [6]. The MEMs sensor is
integrated and connected to a round PCB as shown in Figure
4 and several protections were implemented and tested.
Figure 4. MEMs force sensor connected and mounted in PCB
In this document, 5 protections are dealt with as shown in
Figure 5.
These sensors were chosen to be tested in order to deter-
mine the following points:

Figure 5. Coated MEMs force sensors
The optimal construction material: The sensors are pro-
tected with two different polyurethane resins. The difference
between the two tested materials is essentially in the hardness:
•
the black polyurethane has a hardness of Shore 80
•
the beige polyurethane has a hardness of Shore 40
The sensors rC, rD and F02 are protected with black
polyurethane, rA with beige polyurethane, and the sensor rB
is composed of half of each.
The inﬂuence of height: Sensors rC and rD have the
same shape, the same material but different height in order
to establish a relationship between the coating height and the
response of the sensor.
The inﬂuence of shape: Differences in behavior between
the forms of protection.
The coating procedure: Sensors rA, rB, rC and rD are
made from a mold, and the protection F02 by pouring the
material above the sensor.

COATED SENSOR CHARACTERIZATION
In this section, a relatively low force range is used in order
to determine the sensor characteristics without pushing it to its
maximum supported force.
A. Experimental test bench
In order to calibrate and qualify the different coatings, a
testing system (Figure 6) was created. This system uses a
reference force sensor developed in [5] mounted on two linear
actuators (Lx80F40 Linax Jenny Science) placed along the
x and y axes. A precision screw and a pneumatic actuator
are used to move a rigid plate parallel to the reference force
system. The data acquisition system is a national instruments
acquisition board (DAQ) PXI-6225 at a frequency of 1 kHz.
B. Characterization methodology
The following measurement methodology is performed:
•
Fix the sensor to measure, in its support, in the end
effector.
•
Without applying any force, begin to acquire the
voltages ⃗u in order to calculate the offset ⃗b

•
The sensor and the rigid surface are brought into
contact by the precision screw, until a force of
(1.3 ± 0.2) N is exerted, and is varied manually with-
out exceeding 1.6 N force.
•
The two linear motors move along a predeﬁned path,
to exert tangential forces on the sensor
•
When the motion terminates, the contact is automati-
cally removed by a pneumatic actuator
•
The acquisition system is stopped
The deﬁned trajectory is designed so that the force exerted
on the sensor sweeps through all of the measurable force range,
i.e., explore both the positive and negative forces in the x
and y axes without breaking the sensor. Unfortunately, the
contact between the 3-axis force sensor and the rigid surface
has a small friction coefﬁcient, that does not allow exertion of
tangential forces through all of the measurable force range. The
trajectory is shown in Figure 7. The used trajectory is square
in order to minimize the effects of cross-talking between the
axes.

Figure 7. Trajectory for the sensor characterization
The ﬁrst portion of the acquired signal is used to remove
the sensor offset. At the beginning, the exerted force is null,
thus the measured voltages vector ⃗u is equal to the bias vector
⃗b.
⃗f = 0 ⇒ ⃗u = ⃗b

where
⃗refj is the reference measurement of forces at
sampling time j, and ⃗fj is the forces calculated by equation 2
at sampling time j. n is the number of samples.
C. Characterization results
At least two measures of each of the ﬁve mentioned sensors
were made. Half of the taken measures is used to calculate
the sensitivity matrix and the other is used to validate the
calibration.
The results of the experiments are shown in the Figure
8. The ﬁrst row of the Figure 8 presents the results for the
measurement set used to calibrate the sensor. The second row
of Figure 8 presents the results for the measurement set used
to validate the calibration. Figure 8 shows the acquired data
at the point where the contact was removed. In fact, when the
contact is released using the pneumatic actuator, the reference
sensor begins to vibrate because the deformation due to the
introduced forces creates a mass-sting system, consequently
the last part of the acquired data of the measures is not used
to calibrate the sensor since the reference is not accurate.
Table I presents the error statistics between the reference
system and each of the 3 axis force sensors.

The graphics of the relation between the reference forces
against the calculated forces are shown in the third row of
Figure 8.
To characterize the dynamic behavior of the sensor in the
z axis, the reference data at the instant when the contact is
released is replaced by a step function in the system input (in
order to avoid the reference sensor vibration problem). Using
these signals, the transfer function for each coated sensor is
calculated. Taking as reference the following two characteristic
transfer functions:
•

(1 + Tp1s)(1 + Tp2s)

•
System with two poles and one zero

The constant values Kp, Tp1, Tp2, or a1,2,3,4 are found
for each sensor. These values can be calculated in different
ways. For example by the method of Harriot for over-damped

MATLAB was used in order to easily determine these values.
As it can be deduced from the fourth row in Figure 8, sensors
rA and rB have a transfer function that ﬁts with a second
order transfer function 5. The other three sensors have a well
pronounced relaxation phenomenon. As a consequence, their
transfer function ﬁts better with the one of a system with
two poles and one zero presented in equation 6. The transfer
functions calculated for sensors are shown in the Figure.
Bode plot and phase, calculated from systems presented in
Figure 8, are shown in Figure 9.
The modelled cutoff-frequency of the sensors varies be-
tween ≈ 30 Hz for the F02 and ≈ 50 Hz for the rB. The
theoretical performance of the sensors to a step signal is shown
in Figure 10.
The characteristics of sensitivity and cut-off frequency of
each sensor are presented in Table II.
The results were obtained using a linear model of the
behavior of the sensor.

D. Results Analysis
From Figure 8 and Table I, it is clear that sensors rA, rB and
rD have similar behaviors and good matching of the estimated
forces with respect to the reference ones. However, sensors rC
and F02 have errors that are almost double compared to the
others.
Figure 8 shows that sensors rA, rB and rD preserve the
linear behavior between measurements. Additionally, the ﬁgure
shows that the sensors rC, rD and F02 have a a more signiﬁcant
relaxation phenomenon.
Regarding the set-points evoked in section III. The follow-
ing analyses are made:
Material to be used: For the beige polyurethane with hard-
ness of Shore 40, the relaxation phenomenon isn’t considerable
as is shown in Figure 8. Sensors coated directly with this
material have a better dynamic behavior (rA and rB). When
two materials are combined as for the sensor rB, the problem
is that the forces are not distributed evenly in all directions (as
shown in the linearity analysis ﬁgures).
Inﬂuence of height: Sensors rC and rD have the same
shape and the same material. However they have very different

Figure 11. Results of the selected coated sensors
behaviours. The bigger coating height in sensor rC reduces its
sensitivity to tangential forces.
Inﬂuence of the shape: Three different basic shapes were
tested. The coating used in rA and rD has the same best
linearity. Those shapes gave the best results. The shapes of
sensors F02 and rC have a wide base. This signiﬁcantly
decreases their sensitivity in the shear axes. One of the biggest
problems of the coating shape used for the F02 is that the point
where the forces are applied is not centered with the sensor.
Manufacturing type of protection: The point of application
of forces in the sensor must be well deﬁned, the F02 sensor
does not have this characteristic. In fact during the hardening
process of the polyurethane, any disturbance in the angle
affects the central point position.

RESISTANCE TO HIGH FORCES TEST
The coated sensors that present the best characteristics (rA
and rD) are selected for the high force test. The test consists
of repeating the same experiment presented in the previous
section by applying a higher force range. The test bench system
does not allow more than 9 N. In this test, at least 8 N was
applied to the sensor. The goal of this test is to verify if the
coating preserves its characteristics for the range needed for
object manipulation (about 10 N). The results are shown in
Figure 11.
As shown in the ﬁgure, the sensors preserve their char-
acteristics such as the linearity for the whole range of tested
forces. The two systems resisted about 9 N without breaking.
Clearly, they could go beyond this range without any problems.
After the experiment, no hysteresis was noticed nor was there
a change in their sensitivity. A more robust test bench tool
could be used to determine the maximum supported force.

CONCLUSION
This paper presents an experimental procedure for de-
signing a suitable coating for MEMS based 3-axis force
sensors. Five different coatings with different shapes, sizes and
materials were calibrated, tested and characterized in order to
show the effect of the coating. The analysed characteristics
were the statistics of error in time, the linearity of the response
as well as the impulse response of the system and the ﬁnal
sensitivity of the sensor.
The two sensors with the best characteristics are tested in
a larger range showing that this type of coating is desirable to
use in protecting MEMs force sensors.
The guidelines proposed in section III for the design and
construction of the coating for MEMs force sensors supported
with experimental results of section IV were analyzed and the
conclusions are:
Coating material: The relaxation of the material should
be the fastest possible one. Polyurethane Shore 40 meets this
criterion and is advised to be used as a coating material.
Inﬂuence of height: A higher coating leads to lower sensor
sensitivity to tangent forces. Thus, reducing the coating height
is advised.
Inﬂuence of the shape: The point where the forces are
exerted must be centered, so the tip of the protection must be
pointy, and the base should not be too wide.
Manufacturing type of protection: The sensors must be
made by molding.
The proposed guidelines can be used to create new coat-
ings, with different range of forces and sensitivities. Conse-
quently the force MEMs sensors can be applied in a larger set
of applications.
Further work will focus on the creation of a new coating for
a 3-axis force sensor matrix. This matrix can be used for the
development of a tactile sensing system for robotics dexterous
manipulation.
