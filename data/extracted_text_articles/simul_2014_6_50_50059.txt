Abstract—Senior living facilities consume more energy than 
other types of residential buildings due to seniors’ different 
lifestyles and comfort levels. In order to reduce the high energy 
consumption of senior living facilities, designers should 
consider sustainable design strategies. One important strategy 
is daylighting because of its potential to save energy and to 
benefit seniors’ health. This paper presents a case study based 
on a senior apartment in Changsha, China. Simulation models 
are developed to analyze the building’s energy consumption 
and daylighting conditions. Simulation input parameters are 
adopted through a literature survey to accommodate the real 
lifestyles and thermal comfort conditions of seniors. Daylight 
levels are tested, analyzed and considered in relation to energy 
performance. This paper shows that daylighting is a more 
efficient energy saving measure for senior living facilities than 
it is for regular residential buildings.

 INTRODUCTION 
The 
elderly 
population 
is 
growing 
dramatically 
worldwide, hence the increasing demand for senior housing 
and senior-care facilities. The population of the elderly—
people aged 60 years or over—is predicted to more than 
double between 2013 and 2050. Also, the proportion of aged 
people will increase from 12 percent in 2013 to 21 percent in 
2050. The population is aging more quickly in developing 
countries than in developed countries, and China has one of 
the fastest-aging populations in the world [1].  
As people age, their physical fitness and physiological 
functions degrade. In order to maintain seniors’ comfort 
levels, special built environments need to be developed, 
specifically 
thermal [2], lighting [3], and acoustic 
environments [4]. However, most building standards and 
codes that currently govern the physical built environment 
are based on the needs of younger adults and do not 
specifically address seniors’ requirements.  
Senior-care facilities have nearly two times the Energy 
Use Intensity (EUI) of normal residential buildings [5]. The 
reason for the enormous EUI should be investigated in order 
to achieve the energy saving goals in senior housing. 
This research studies aspects of a specially built 
environment, such as room temperature and lighting level, 
which affect the ability of seniors to maintain their health 
and comfort. The energy consumption features of senior 
housing are examined to find how they are different from 
those of housing for younger adults. The importance of 
daylighting for seniors and senior housing are proposed. The 
energy savings though daylighting are assessed through a 
modified simulation process using the OpenStudio [6], 
Radiance [7], and EnergyPlus [8] simulation programs.  
The second section of the paper reviews the literature 
about the input values for simulation, which are the 
temperature and illumination for seniors’ comfort. The third 
section describes the methodology of the research, including 
the simulation model, simulation tools, and simulation 
process. The fourth section presents the simulation of four 
energy models, the fifth section analyzes the simulation 
results, and the sixth section shows the conclusion of the 
research.

LITERATURE REVIEW 
A. Temperature and Thermal Comfort 
Thermal comfort is one of the most important criteria to 
consider when evaluating a built environment. The 
temperature setpoint has a huge impact on the building’s 
energy consumption. According to current standards, the 
comfort temperature requirements are the same for people of 
all ages. However, researchers have found that the elderly 
have different thermal environment preferences from 
younger adults.  
In a climate chamber research, it was found that older 
adults prefer a higher ambient temperature, 23.1 °C (73.5 
°F), than do younger adults, 21.9 °C (71.4 °F), for a 
difference of about 1.2 °C (2.0 °F) [2]. It has also been found 
that the elderly prefer a higher temperature than do younger 
adults [9]. A field study about seniors’ thermal comfort 
requirements in residential environments showed that 
seniors’ temperature of thermal neutrality was 25.2 °C (77.4 
°F) for the summer and 23.2 °C  (73.8 °F) for the winter 
[10]. However, other studies found different results that older 
adults preferred the same environmental temperature as the 
younger adults and that the optimal temperature for thermal 
comfort was 21.1 °C (70.0 °F) for both age groups [11].  
This study is based on the assumption that seniors prefer 
relatively 
high 
temperatures. 
People’s 
temperature 
preferences tend to vary according to climate and culture, so 
data on the specific thermal condition preference of the

seniors in China would be beneficial to future studies. In this 
study, the ASHRAE 90.1-2004 standard is used for the 
baseline simulations. In ASHRAE 90.1-2004, the heating 
and cooling temperature settings for mid-rise apartment are 
21.1 °C (70.0 °F) and 23.9 °C (75.0 °F), respectively. In this 
study, higher temperature settings are used for the simulation 
models of senior housing; the heating and cooling 
temperatures are changed to 22.2 °C (72.0 °F) and 25.0 °C 
(77.0 °F), respectively. 
B. Illumination and Visual Comfort 
Lighting energy accounts for an important proportion of 
building energy consumption. ASHRAE standards normally 
set the lighting energy based on the Illuminating Engineering 
Society’s 
(IES) 
lighting 
level 
recommendations 
for 
normally-sighted people.  
However, because of changes in the human eye lens and 
the visual nervous system over time, the amount of effective 
light reaching the retina declines as a person ages. Seniors 
require about two to three times the light of younger adults to 
have proper visual acuity and to see comfortably [3]. 
Therefore, the lighting power density requirements of 
ASHRAE standards are not adequate for providing sufficient 
lighting for seniors. Insufficient lighting can cause falling, 
collision, vision loss, and other problems.  
Recently, the IES has developed special lighting 
requirements for seniors. Table I shows the comparison of 
the illuminance requirements for senior housing versus the 
requirements for offices and normal residence environments. 
Senior housing needs about the same lighting level as 
offices, and the general lighting requirement is 4 times the 
illuminance of normal residences.  
In this study, a simple approach is used for determining 
the lighting power density of senior housing. In ASHRAE 
90.1-2004, the lighting power density is 3.88 W/m2 (0.36 
W/ft2) for mid-rise apartments and 10.76 W/m2 (1 W/ft2) for 
offices. Because the illuminance requirement of senior 
housing is similar to that of an office, the lighting power 
density for senior housing is set to 10.76 W/m2 (1 W/ft2). 
Only general lighting is considered in this study; task 
lighting such as dining and reading lighting are not 
considered. 
C. Daylighting and Health 
Seniors tend to stay in their homes for more of the day 
than younger adults, and they need more light to see clearly, 
so daylighting is a more suitable energy-saving measure for 
senior housing than it is for other residential buildings. 
Daylighting also offers great health benefits to seniors.  
Daylight exposure can stimulate the production of 
vitamin D under the skin, improve the health of bones and 
muscles, and prevent seniors from falling and suffering 
fractures [3]. As people age, the ability of their skin to 
produce vitamin D decreases, and they tend to spend less 
time outdoors [3]. Another possible effect of insufficient or 
improper lighting is circadian dysfunction, which can lead to 
Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) and Sick Building 
Syndrome (SBS) [13]. Therefore, sufficient natural light in 
the rooms is especially important for senior housing. 
Daylighting design should be an important consideration in 
senior housing. 
III. 
METHODOLOGY 
A. Research Framework 
The study includes the simulation of four energy models 
with the same building geometry. Figure 1 shows the 
framework of the research. The first energy model is the 
baseline model for a regular mid-rise apartment. The second 
energy model is the baseline model for a senior apartment. 
The comparison of the first and second models shows how a 
regular apartment and a senior apartment have different 
energy performance. The third energy model is the regular 
apartment with daylighting strategies, and the fourth energy 
model is the senior apartment with the same daylighting 
strategies. The daylighting conditions of the models are 
evaluated, and the energy saving through daylighting is 
found by comparing the four models. The difference in the 
energy saving shows how daylighting performs differently in 
regular housing as compared to senior housing. 
B. Simulation Tools and Process 
The OpenStudio program, developed by the National 
Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), is used as the 
primary simulation platform. OpenStudio runs as a plug-in 
for the SketchUp program that develops three-dimensional 
geometries. As a graphic user interface, OpenStudio uses the 
EnergyPlus program, developed by the US Department of 
Energy, to run thermal simulations, and the Radiance 
program, developed by the Lawrence Berkeley National 
Laboratory, to run daylight performance simulations.  
Typically, the daylighting simulation workflow in 
OpenStudio is to first export the building geometry and 
model data into a rad file for simulation in Radiance. A 
lighting schedule is generated automatically after the 
daylighting simulation and is embedded into the OpenStudio

file for final whole-building energy simulation [6]. However, 
this typical process is not appropriate for the present study. 
No input adjustments of the Radiance simulation process are 
currently allowed in OpenStudio. The different illuminance 
targets for senior housing and regular housing cannot be 
demonstrated, and corresponding lighting schedules cannot 
be generated, so the simulation results would not be accurate. 
Thus, for this study, a modified process is developed to 
address this issue.  
Figure 2 shows the tools and the process for this 
simulation methodology. After the regular building energy 
simulation in OpenStudio, the annual daylight illuminance 
data from the ill file simulated by Radiance are located, and 
analyzed in Excel. The average hourly monthly illuminance 
tables for each space are generated for daylighting condition 
evaluation and lighting schedule calculation. Figure 3 shows 
one example of the illuminance table, for a room with the 
illuminance target of 300 Lux. Each cell shows the average 
illuminance of a room at one hour in a month. Figure 4 
shows the lighting schedule generated for the same room. 
The lighting schedule of each hour is determined by how 
much more illuminance is needed to reach the illuminance 
target and what percentage of the target it accounts for. The 
hours considered for daylighting are 7:00 to 17:00. If the 
average illuminance of an hour exceeds the illuminance 
target, the light will be set to 10% on for a conservative 
consideration. Then, the new schedules need to be 
synthesized with the existing lighting schedules and 
manually input into OpenStudio for the final simulation. The 
third and fourth models are simulated using this method. The 
cooling, heating, equipment, lighting, and total energy 
consumption of the four models are the final results needed.

SIMULATION 
A. Simulation Model Introducation 
The simulation model is a senior apartment located in 
Changsha, south-central China. Changsha is at the longitude 
112 °E and the latitude 28 °N. It has a humid, subtropical 
climate [14]. According to the Köppen-Geiger classification, 
this climate is the same as that of the southeastern US; thus, 
the ASHRAE standard for climate zone 4 is used.  
This apartment, which has seven floors, is one of the 
most common types of housing in China. Figure 5 shows 
the model of the building. This building is an independent 
living apartment. The first floor is the public area, and the 
second through seventh floors are the living area. Figure 6 
shows the floor plan. There are 28 rooms on each floor, and 
there are five major types of rooms: west-facing rooms, 
recessed south-facing rooms, south-facing rooms with 
balconies, south-facing rooms, and east-facing rooms. In 
this study, one room of each type is selected for simulation. 
Table II shows the characteristics of the five rooms. Ideal 
loads air system is used for simulation. 
B. First Energy Model 
The first energy model is the baseline model for a regular 
apartment. It uses the ASHERAE 90.1-2004, midrise 
apartment, climate zone 4, as the template. To simplify the

simulation, only the five rooms are modeled in detail, and 
each of the five rooms is assigned to an individual thermal 
zone.  
C. Second Energy Model 
The second energy model is the adjusted baseline model 
used to demonstrate the energy consumption of senior 
housing. To meet the special lighting and thermal levels for 
seniors’ comfort and health, the lighting power density and 
temperature setpoint are adjusted. To represent a more 
accurate living pattern and the occupation status of seniors, 
the schedules are changed accordingly.  
1) Lighting power density:  
As stated earlier in the literature review, the lighting 
power density is changed from 3.88 W/m2 (0.36 W/ft2) to 
10.76 W/m2 (1 W/ft2) to meet the lighting level for seniors’ 
visual comfort. 
2) Temperature setpoint: 
The heating temperature setpoint is changed from 21.1 
°C (70.0 °F) to 22.2 °C (72.0 °F). The cooling temperature 
setpoint is changed from 23.9 °C (75.0 °F) to 25.0 (77.0 °F). 
3) Schedule: 
As distinct from regular residential buildings, senior 
living buildings are occupied more hours of the day, 
sometimes even 24 hours a day. In this study, data from the 
American Time Use Survey (ATUS) [15] are used to 
determine the daily activity of the elderly, and the average 
lighting, equipment, and occupancy schedules are generated. 
In future studies, more accurate schedules for the seniors in 
China need to be developed. In normal mid-rise apartments 
during the day, the lighting and occupancy schedule can be 
as low as 10% to 30% occupied, and the equipment schedule 
can be about 60% to 70% on. For this study, the lighting and 
equipment schedules for senior housing are changed to 100% 
on during the day. The occupancy schedule is changed to 
80% to 90% occupied during the day.  
D. Daylighting Simulation 
For the daylighting simulation, using the OpenStudio 
plug-in in SketchUp, 5×5 illumination maps of 25 sensor 
points are placed into the five rooms, and the daylighting 
controls are placed in the center of the rooms. They are all at 
the height of 762 mm (2.5 ft). Simple glazing system 
windows is used in the model. The U-factor of the window is 
2.95 W/m2K (0.52 Btu/ft2hR). The Solar Heat Gain 
Coefficient is 0.39. The visible transmittance is 0.27. The 
annual daylight illuminance data are simulated so that they 
could be used for the lighting schedule and daylighting 
condition analysis. Because the building geometry and 
material data are the same for the third and fourth model, the 
daylighting simulation results are applied to both of them. 
E. Third Energy Model 
The third model is the regular apartment with 
daylighting. The building geometry and all the building 
data, except the lighting schedule, are the same as for the 
first model. 75 Lux (7.5 FC) is used as the target 
illuminance, and lighting schedules are generated using the 
data from daylighting simulation.  
F. Fourth Energy Model 
The fourth model is the senior apartment with 
daylighting. Lighting schedules are generated based on the 
target of 300 Lux (30 FC). All the other model data are the 
same as for the second energy model. 
V. 
RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 
A. Daylighting Simulation Results 
Figure 7 shows the annual average illuminance and 
average peak illuminance of the five rooms. The red line is 
the average illuminance target for senior housing, which is 
300 Lux (30 FC), as required by IES. The yellow line is the 
average illuminance target for regular housing. An optimal 
design should have the average illuminance above the goal 
without high peak illuminance. 
The glazing material has a visible transmittance of only 
0.27, which is low for daylighting purpose. Therefore, the 
average illuminance for all the rooms is acceptable for 
normal housing, but insufficient for senior housing. The 
south room without balcony has the highest average 
illuminance, and the west room has the highest peak 
illuminance.  
In Figure 8, the blue line shows the percentage of time 
that a room’s illuminance reaches the target of 300 Lux. The 
red line shows the percentage of time the room illuminance 
exceeds double the target, in which case the light might 
cause too much heat gain or a glare, and the occupants might 
close the window blind. The green line shows the percentage 
of time that the room illuminance is between 300 and 600 
Lux, which is the appropriate level of light for seniors. The 
lighting conditions for all the rooms need improvement 
because more than half of the time the illuminance cannot 
reach the target. The daylighting performance of the recessed

south room is far from ideal, and this type of room should be 
avoided in senior housing design. The other four room types 
all have the potential for improvement. 
Daylighting conditions of this apartment could be 
improved through design decisions such as adjusting the size 
and position of windows, increasing the transmittance of 
glazing material, changing the reflectance of interior material, 
and adding proper shading devices.  
B. Energy Simulation Results 
Figure 9 shows the energy simulation results of the four 
models. The blue dots are the total EUI, and the clustered 
columns show the EUI breakdown. Figure 9 (a) shows the 
EUI of the baseline model for regular housing. Of the five 
selected rooms, the recessed south room has the lowest total 
EUI, and the south room with balcony has the highest EUI. 
These results are explained by the fact that these two rooms 
have the least and greatest exterior wall area. Cooling energy 
is the largest component of energy consumption. Equipment 
energy is the second largest, and lighting and heating energy 
only account for a small proportion of total energy. 
Figure 9 (b) shows the EUI of baseline model for senior 
housing. Compared to the first energy model, the average 
EUI increases 2.33 times, which matches the previous 
findings [5]. The south room has the highest EUI, but the 
total EUI difference among the five rooms is not obvious. 
The lighting energy increases 5.40 times, and the cooling 
energy increases 2.57 times. Even though the temperature 
setpoint for senior housing is higher, the cooling energy is 
even larger, and the heating energy is even smaller. The main 
reasons for this result are the extra heat gain from the 
increased lighting and the greater number of occupied hours.  
Figure 9 (c) shows the EUI of the regular housing with 
daylighting. The average energy saving is 1.07%. The 
average lighting energy saving is 6.57%, and the average 
cooling energy saving is 0.98%. Because the rooms are not 
occupied for most of the daylighting hours, the lighting 
energy saving is not obvious. There is a slight decrease in 
cooling energy and increase in heating energy because of the 
lower amount of heat generated by the lower level of 
electrical lighting.  
Figure 9 (d) shows the EUI of the senior housing with 
daylighting. The average energy saving is 16.75%. The 
average lighting energy saving is 32.39%, and the average 
cooling energy saving is 14.16%. Even without any design 
improvements, there is significant decrease in lighting and 
cooling energy compared to the energy savings in regular 
apartment. Therefore, daylighting is a more efficient energy 
savings method for senior housing. Design optimizations 
will be experimented in future studies to further improve the 
energy performance. Temperature settings can also influence 
the energy consumption greatly. Due to the high cooling 
energy and low heating energy in senior housing, higher 
temperature setpoints could be considered so long as a 
comfortable thermal environment is maintained. The EUI of 
the recessed south room is much higher than the other four 
rooms, due to its limited access to daylight. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
This paper presented an approach for modeling the 
energy performance of senior housing and the energy 
savings through daylighting.  
The energy consumption of senior housing is more than 
two times higher than that of normal housing, and the energy 
increase is mostly from cooling and lighting energy. 
Daylighting is a suitable energy savings strategy for senior 
housing. The natural light in the case study building is 
inadequate and the daylighting condition needs to be 
optimized, but the energy saving is obvious even in current 
condition. Daylighting can reduce the building’s lighting and 
cooling energy, and it works more effectively for senior 
housing than for regular residential buildings.  
The energy performance of the five rooms in this 
building varied greatly when simulated as regular housing or 
senior housing. These results indicate that senior housing 
should be specially designed to achieve the optimal energy 
and daylighting performance.
