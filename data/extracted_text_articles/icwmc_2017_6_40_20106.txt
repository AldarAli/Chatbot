Abstract—A quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) is one of 
the circuit design technology in next generation. It has ad-
vantages of nano-sized devices and low power consumption. A 
multiplier is used in various fields and one of the most im-
portant circuits in processor. Multiplier is consisted of AND 
gates and full adders. In this paper, we design a small-sized 1-
bit full adder for an efficient QCA multiplier. The proposed 
circuit is simulated using QCADesigner tool.

 INTRODUCTION 
Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) refers to quantum 
computational models that have been devised in the same 
way as existing models of cellular automata introduced by 
Von Neumann. QCA is as a candidate to replace comple-
mentary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology 
and it attracts much attention with very small even number 
molecules or atomic scale and low power consumption [1]. 
Many circuits have been proposed and simulated [2-5]. 
One of these circuits, the multiplier receives binary data as 
input and outputs it. A multiplier is necessary for most pro-
cessors, and since the circuit configuration is more complex 
than other operations in the processor, depending on the per-
formance of multiplier circuit, the speed of the system can be 
affected. A multiplier consists of AND gates and full adders. 
In QCA, an AND gate can be designed by using a majority 
gate, but full adders have various circuit design methods. 
Since the design of an efficient full adder can improve the 
performance of the multiplier, many full adders have been 
proposed in the QCA. In this paper, we propose an efficient 
1-bit full adder by using a majority gate and a 3-input exclu-
sive-OR (XOR) gate.

RELATED WORK 
 
Fig. 1 shows a QCA cell and wire. A QCA circuit con-
sists of quantum cells with four quantum dots. The quantum 
cell of Fig. 1 (a) has two electrons that can tunnel between 
the quantum dots, and the electrons are located diagonally 
from each other by the Coulomb repulsion. The quantum cell 
has a value of 1 (1) or -1 (0) depending on the position of the 
electrons. A quantum cell affects adjacent cells by coulomb

and (b) majority gate (output is 0) 
repulsion. Therefore, the same value propagates along the 
straight line as shown in Fig. 1 (b). A QCA wire and a ma-
jority gate can be designed using the coulomb repulsion be-
tween the cells [6]. The majority gate in Fig. 2 is a circuit 
that determines the output value by majority vote from three 
inputs. By using this circuit, it is possible to design an AND 
gate and an OR gate which are the basis of the logic circuit. 
If one input value is fixed to 1, then the majority gate per-
forms as an OR gate, and if one input value is fixed to 0, then 
it performs as an AND gate [7]. An AND gate is needed to 
compose a full adder, and the AND gate computes and out-
puts with fixed value of 0 and two inputs.

PROPOSED QCA FULL ADDER 
 
In this section, we describe a proposed 1-bit full adder. 
The proposed circuit is 1-bit full adder and is designed using 
a majority gate and 3-input XOR gate. The majority gate is 
used as an AND gate and outputs Carry among the outputs of 
full adders. The 3-input XOR gate is a modified form of the 
previous 5-input majority gate [8] and outputs Sum. 
Figure 3 shows a 1-bit full adder block diagram. Inputs A, 
B, and C output Carry through the majority gate and Sum 
through the 3-input XOR gate. Fig. 3 shows a 1-bit full adder

Figure 5.  Simulation result of proposed circuit 
block diagram. Inputs A, B, and C output Carry through the 
majority gate and Sum through the 3-input XOR gate. Table 
1 is a truth table of 1-bit full adder. The input values are bi-
nary bits 000 to 111 and are the same as the simulation result 
of the proposed QCA full adder.  
Fig. 4 shows the circuit layout of the proposed QCA 1-bit 
full adder. In order to efficiently connect the wiring of the 
input values on the QCA, the wiring is designed so that one 
input propagates the signal in both directions respectively. 
The 3-input XOR gate connected to the output Carry and the 
3-input XOR gate connected to Sum are similar in shape, but 
are modified with the existing 5-input majority gate by add-
ing two cells to the intersection cell diagonal [8]. Fig. 5 
shows simulation result of our proposed full adder circuit 
using QCADesigner tool version 2.0.3. It shows a clear 
strong signal and the result is consistent with the truth table 
in Table 1. Three inputs are shown as a blue line on white 
background and two outputs are as a yellow line on black 
background in Fig. 5.

CONCLUSIONS  
In this paper, we design a new 1-bit full adder with ma-
jority gate and 3-input XOR gate in QCA. In the proposed 
circuit, the wires connected to the input value are designed to 
propagate in both directions. The proposed circuit is a planar 
circuit and proposed for the purpose of designing a planar 
multiplier.
