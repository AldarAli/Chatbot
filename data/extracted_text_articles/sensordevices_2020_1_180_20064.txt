Abstract—The paper describes the design and realization of
a device for non-invasive sensing of hemodynamic parameters in
veterinary medicine of small animals (dogs and cats). Two main
hemodynamic parameters were selected for the measurement
blood pressure and heart rate. An oscillometric method was
chosen to measure blood pressure. The heart rate is determined
from the electrocardiography (ECG) signal, i.e., by sensing the
electrical activity of the heart from the body surface. The realized
device saves the measured data on the SD card after measuring
the signals. To evaluate them, a MATLAB script, which deter-
mines the values was implemented. The control of the measuring
device and communication with the user is provided by the
ESP32 microcontroller. The advantage of the realized device
is the possibility of displaying oscillometric pulsations, which
is not usually available in commercial devices. Thanks to the
simultaneous measurement of the mentioned biological signals,
the possibilities of the signal evaluation can be further extended,
e.g., by measuring the pulse wave velocity measurement.

I. INTRODUCTION
Hemodynamic parameters are one of the basic clinical
parameters, which should inform about an overall health state
and indicate potential risks both in human and veterinary
medicine. The hemodynamic parameters reﬂect blood ﬂow in
the vascular bed. The primary hemodynamic parameters are
heart rate and blood pressure [1].
The ﬁrst measurements of blood pressure were (invasively)
realized at the beginning of 18. century by Stephen Hales
[2]. The non-invasive blood pressure was ﬁrstly determined in
1896 by Italian physician Scipione Riva Rocci [3]. The blood
pressure is a pulsatile pressure in arteries, which is charac-
terized by systolic (maximal), diastolic (minimal), and mean
values. In 2007, the recommendation for blood pressure mea-
surement was created by the American College of Veterinary
Interna Medicine (AVCIM) [4]. The updated recommendation
was published in 2018 [5]. The method, which is frequently
used for non-invasive blood pressure measurement currently, is
oscillometry measurement [6], [7]. The typical values of blood
pressure in veterinary medicine of small animals are roughly
140 mmHg systolic pressure, 77 mmHg diastolic pressure,
and 99 mmHg mean arterial pressure for healthy cats [8], and
119 mmHg systolic pressure, 67 mmHg diastolic pressure and
94 mmHg mean arterial pressure for dogs [9].
The heart rate is deﬁned as the number of ventricular
contractions per unit time and is usually given in beats per
minute (bpm) [10]. There are several methods for heart rate
determination, such as photoplethysmography (PPG) [11] or
electrocardiography (ECG) [12]. The ECG method offers
a straightforward approach to heart rate, which is not inﬂu-
enced by the health state of peripheral vessels; thus, it is the
reason this approach was selected for the study. The typical
signal, which is frequently used for heart rate determination
from ECG, is lead II (electrodes placed on the right arm and
the left leg). The amplitude of the QRS complex in lead II is
typically about 2 mV for dogs (about 2.5 mV for bigger races)
and about 0.9 mV for cats [13].
The study aims to design and realize a device for non-
invasive sensing of basic hemodynamic parameters (heart rate
and blood pressure) in veterinary medicine of small animals
(typically cats and dogs) and to design and implement signal
processing methods for the determination of derived hemo-
dynamic parameters, such as pulse transition time and pulse
wave velocity.
In Section II, the design of the device is described. The
features of blood pressure measurement and ECG measure-
ment parts are speciﬁed, and the related signal processing is
described. In Section III, proof of the proposed concept is
presented. The device was evaluated on a human volunteer. In
Section IV, the results and future steps are brieﬂy discussed.
II. METHODS
The device is designed as a stand-alone measurement de-
vice, which consists of several principal blocks (see Figure
1). The whole device is controlled by a microcontroller
ESP32 (240 MHz dual-core microcontroller) with an inte-
grated 802.11 b/g/n (WiFi) transceiver/receiver and dual-mode
Bluetooth. The data are stored on an SD card for off-line
processing and could also be transferred via WiFi network
for processing immediately during data acquisition. The main
parts of the device are blood pressure measurement and heart
rate measurement blocks. The user interface is realized using
buttons and LCD. The device could also communicate by the
web interface. The power supply unit is designed both for
supply from DC voltage sources, such as DC adaptors or from
build-in LiON accumulator.

A. Blood Pressure Measurement
The blood pressure measurement is based on the oscillom-
etry method. The hardware realization of the blood pressure
measurement part could be divided into a pneumatic circuit
and an electronic part. The pneumatic circuit consists of an
air pump for inﬂating the cuff and a deﬂation valve. The
electronic part includes the pressure sensor MP3V5050 (NXP
Semiconductor) [14] and the analog ﬁlter (1st order low-pass
ﬁlter with cut-off frequency 650 Hz) [15]. The signal from
the pressure sensor is digitalized by the ADC integrated into
the microcontroller. A two-tube newborn size cuff is used for
blood pressure measurement.
B. Heart Rate Measurement
The ECG part is based on the single-lead heart rate monitor
front-end AD8232 (Analog Devices) [16]. The gain is set to
100 [-], common-mode rejection ratio is at least 80 dB (DC
to 60 Hz). Two analog ﬁlters are used for a better detection of
heart rate by emphasizing the QRS complex in ECG signal.
The ﬁrst one is a 2nd order high-pass ﬁlter with cut-off
frequency 7 Hz, and the second one is a 2nd order Sallen-Key
low-pass ﬁlter with cut-off frequency 24 Hz. The additional
gain of the ﬁlter is 11 [-].
C. Signal Processing
The acquired signals are processed off-line in PC. Firstly,
the oscillometry pulsations are extracted from the cuff pressure
by band-pass ﬁlter with cut-off frequencies 0.5 Hz and 3.5 Hz.
Consequently, the envelope of the signal is computed. After-
wards, the mean arterial pressure is determined as a pressure
in the cuff at the moment of maximal oscillation (maximum
amplitude algorithm) [17]. The systolic and diastolic pressures
are determined using the ratio method [18].
Simultaneously, the recorded ECG signal is processed to
determine the heart rate. The PanTompkins algorithm is used
for ECG signal processing [19].
III. RESULTS
As a proof of concept, the device was evaluated on a human
volunteer. The proband was a young healthy woman (25 years,
174 cm, 67 kg). The ECG electrodes were placed on the right
arm (RA electrode) and the left leg (LL), the acquired signal
corresponding to lead II. The cuff was placed on the left hand.
The working range of blood pressure (from 60 mm Hg up to
160 mm Hg) and ECG signal (the amplitude of QRS complex
about ones of mV) in human medicine is the same of working
range of blood pressure and ECG signal in veterinary medicine
of cats and dogs [8], [9], [13].
The acquired ECG signal is shown in Figure 2a in detail,
the one-minute record is shown in Figure 2b. All R peaks
were detected correctly (highlighted using red triangles). The
instantaneous value of the heart rate determined from the ECG
signal is shown in Figure 2c.
The signals relating to the blood pressure measurement
are shown in Fig 3. The cuff pressure acquired during the
deﬂation of the cuff is shown in Figure 3a. The record of
oscillometry pulsations extracted from the cuff pressure is

oscillometric waveform envelope is shown in Figure 3c. The
mean arterial, systolic and diastolic pressures determined from
the signal envelope are highlighted by a black circle and black

IV. CONCLUSION
The paper presents the partial results of the research in
progress. The design and realization of a device for non-
invasive measurement of ECG and blood pressure in veterinary
medicine of small animals have been done.
The concept of the device allows not only the measuring
of ECG signal and blood pressure but also the possibility to
determine additional hemodynamic parameters, such as pulse
transition time (a time difference between the R-peak in ECG
and a related maximum of the pulse wave in oscillometric
pulsations) or pulse wave velocity.
The future steps will contain the evaluation of the device
on small animals in clinical practice and the design and
implementation of additional signal processing algorithms for
enlarging the set of determined hemodynamic parameters.
