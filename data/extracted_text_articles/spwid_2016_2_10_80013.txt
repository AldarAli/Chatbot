Electromyography
(sEMG)
has
applications
in
prosthetics,
diagnostics
and
neuromuscular
rehabilitation, and has been an increasing area of study. This
study attempts to use a fully integrated smart textile band with
electrical connecting tracks knitted with intarsia techniques to
evaluate the quality of sEMG acquired by knitted textile
electrodes. Myoelectric pattern recognition for motor volition
and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were used to compare its sensing
performance
versus
the
conventional
Ag-AgCl
electrodes.
Overall no significant differences were found between the textile
and the Ag-AgCl electrodes in SNR and prediction accuracy
obtained from pattern recognition classifiers. On average the
textile electrodes produced a high prediction accuracy, >97%
across all movements, which is equivalent to the accuracy
obtained
with
conventional
gel
electrodes
(Ag-AgCl).
Furthermore the SNR for the Maximum Voluntary Contraction
did not differ considerably between the textile and the Ag-AgCl
electrodes.

I. INTRODUCTION
Surface
Electromyography
(sEMG)
has
applications in prosthetics, clinical diagnostics, and
neuromuscular rehabilitation devices. sEMG has
been used for rehabilitation robotics, treatment for
stroke and spinal cord injury patients [1], phantom
limb pain treatment [2], and as a tool for non-
invasive EMG monitoring [3].
Traditionally Ag-AgCl electrodes are used to
acquire sEMG signals because the electrodes limit
motion artifacts due to its conductive layer and,
most often, ensure high quality signal acquisition.
However, these electrodes when used for extended
periods of time cause skin irritation [4]. Additionally
when
used
in
upper
limb
applications
for
prosthetics, and therapies for amputees, they are
difficult to apply and remove with limited dexterity.
The use of smart textile technology to address
these problems in sEMG signal acquisition has been
an increasing area of study as well as the study of
textile applications in biosignal monitoring such as
Electrocardiography
(ECG)
and
Electroencephalogram
(EEG)
[5][6].
Textile
electrodes, also known as textrodes, have been
studied extensively in multiple forms including
screen printed, knitted, woven and embroidered
sensors [6-8]. In the case of the study by Zhang
screen printed electrodes for sEMG monitoring
showed promise in movement identification for
transradial amputees using both offline classification
techniques as well as live recordings [7].
This study proposes a fully integrated textile
solution for sEMG monitoring in the form of an
arm-band fabricated using intarsia knitting, for
electrical connection of the recording device with
the textrodes. The textrodes were done with a
knitted silver fabrics similarly to those used in [9].
Intarsia is a well-known and spread knitting
technique in textile manufacturing that enables
textile electronic integration at the level of fabric
production by using conductive yarns which form
knitted courses through the fabric. This technique
has been previously introduced for e-textiles for
ECG recordings [10], electro-stimulation [11] and
even for thoracic bioimpedance recordings [8][ 9].
Using this sensorized armband and textrodes, this
study aims to assess:

2nd The feasibility of using a fully textile
sensorized
arm-strap
for
the
application
of
classification of hand-movements from sEMG
recordings
For that, the functionality of both textrodes and
Ag-AgCl electrodes was studied using the intarsia-
sensorized band, performing a study based on their
offline
pattern
recognition
accuracy,
i.e.
the
performance of classifiers using signals for the two
types of electrodes was analyzed. The SNR was then
used to compare the signal quality and floor noise
for the two electrodes during Maximum Voluntary
Contraction (MVC).
Section II describes the methods for textile
fabrication of both the band and the textrodes as
well as the protocol for the electrode signal
comparisons and analysis. Section III describes the
results of the signal comparison in the raw signal,
percent accuracy and signal to noise ratio (SNR),
Section IV discusses the significance of the singal
equivalencies and Section V describes the future
work to be done.
II. METHODS
A. Textile Fabrication
The textile band was used as an interface with the
EMG amplifier and the electrodes. The band was
fabricated using an intarsia flat knitting machine
SHIMA SEIKI SRY 12 gauge with multiple feeders
of cotton and silver yarn 110 f 34 dtex HC+B. The
electrical pathways were knitted together with
cotton and sewn to an elastic fabric made with
elastan. Snap buttons were used for interconnecting
the textile conductive pads and the electrodes
through the fabrics. A zipper was added at each end
of the strap as the closing mechanism.
The design of the band allows for a total of eight
sEMG channels to be simultaneously recorded,
however for the purpose of this study only four
channels were used. For both gel and textile
electrodes, 1 cm of space was allotted between the
electrode pair used to form a differential input and 3
cm between each channel of the band. The band
with textile electrodes is shown in Figure 1:
The textrode was fabricated with a conductive
knitted Shieldex Technik-tex fabric sewn around a
foam pad. A snap connector was attached to connect
to the textrode to the band. The dimensions are 1x3
cm as shown in Figure 2.
B. Protocol for Ag-AgCl and Textrode Comparison
The
upper
arm
movements
of
six
healthy
volunteers between 23-30 years old were recorded
(3_male and 3 females). The band was placed on
the dominant arm with the channels assigned as seen
in the Figure 3 with channel 2 placed on the
Extensor carpi ulnaris muscle. An AgCl electrode
was used for reference in all measurments.
Two experimental measurement setups were
used for the test, one with only AgCl Electrodes in
the band then and another with only textrodes. The
EMG activity was recorded with the subjects

performing a ramp exercise for each type of
contraction. The ramp exercise involves one MVC
and then increasing contractions up to MVC guided
by a computer program, namely BioPatRec [12].
The executed contractions included the following in
order; open, close, flex, extend, pronate, and
supinate. Three repetitions of each contraction were
performed and the EMG superficial biopotential
was acquired with a sampling frequency of 2000 Hz
for a measurement time of 10 seconds and a duty
cycle of 50%. i.e., 5 second contraction time with a
5 second rest between contractions.
The textrodes were wet with 2 ml of undistilled
water to improve skin electrode interface [6].
Between tests the subject had a bandage placed on
top of the band ensure the placement of the
electrodes
remain
consistent
while
the
AgCl
electrodes were replaced with the textrodes.
C. Signal Analysis:
Signals were acquired and analyzed for offline
accuracy in Pattern Recognition using BioPatRec
software [12]. Four signal features for the pattern
recognition were used including mean absolute
value, wave length, zero crossing and slope change
with
a
linear
discriminant
pattern
recognition
algorithm in a one-vs-one topology [12][13]. The
sEMG recordings from the six hand movements
were then processed. In order to calculate the
percent classification accuracy a total of 206 time
windows of 0.2 seconds were extracted per subject:
84 for training, 41 for validation and 83 for testing.

The SNR for the movements was then calculated
using Equation 1 above where SRMS represents the
RMS of the signal amplitude during movement and
NRMS represents the RMS of the floor noise during
rest.The strongest SNR signal of each of the four
channels was used for each movement. Therefore to
perform the SNR calculation equal levels of ground
noise was found to be similar for all channels within
the same test. The distribution and mean of the SNR
for MVC was then found across all subjects.
Signal comparison was done from the sEMG
recording obtained from the extension of the
extensor carpi ulnaris on channel 2 for wrist
extension of each subject, the strongest contraction
signal, for both recordings performed with Ag-AgCl
electrodes and textrode. For visual comparison the
difference in SNR, the RMS and the power
frequency spectrum were calculated and evaluated.
Finally a Two One Sided T-test (TOST) [14][15],
was performed to show that both electrodes had
equivalent performance in accurately identifying the
signal features for pattern recognition. The TOST
was used to show that the mean difference between
the two groups is less than the accepted error of
4.1%,
which
is
the
variation
observed
in
classification accuracy with long term use of sEMG
[16].

B. Pattern Recognition Accuracy
In Figure 6, the accuracy obtained with both type
of electrodes for each of the six movements shows,
in either case, values superior to 95%. The average
across movements is 98.89% and 98.96% for the
Ag-AgCl and the Textrodes respectively.
Table I indicates the values obtained for the t-
statistic tests performed in the TOST procedure,
indicating statistical equivalence.
C. Maximum Voluntary Contraction Signal to
Noise Ratio
Figure 7 shows the SNR obtained during the
Maximum
Voluntary
contraction.
The
average
difference in SNR across all the movements and all
the subjects is 0.084%. The maximum difference in
SNR between means across all six movements is
1.67%.
Figure 8 shows the average percent equivalence
across six movements for which, the SNR obtained
can
be
considered
equivalent
for
increasing
confidence levels. The percent equivalence ranges
from 82.0% to 93.0% can be found for confidence
levels ranging from 99.5% to 90% respectively. In
the following section the significance of these
equivalencies is discussed.

IV. DISCUSSION
As seen in Figure 4, the two signals are visually
similar in both in the amount of floor noise and the
signal
intensity
during
the
contractions.
This
similarity is further supported by the power spectral
density plots
showing
that
the
two
electrode
readings
have
similar
frequency
content.
Additionally,
the
pattern
recognition
accuracy
obtained
with
the
classifiers
in
the
offline
simulation testing is above 95 in all cases as shown
in Figure 6. Moreover, the average accuracy across
all movements is very high and almost identical
98.89% and 98.96% for the textrodes and Ag-AgCl
electrodes respectively. Regarding the observed
accuracy, it can be seen that the recordings produce
an statistical significant equivalent classification
performance below 4.1% error, which is the average
drop expected during the day in this kind of upper
limb prosthesis [16]. Although it can be observed in
Figure 7 that the movements show a range of
performance in which the electrodes performance
differs over two percent in accuracy such as in FH
and SU the overall performance on average remains
in the same range.
From
the
signal
quality
perspective,
it
is
observed
that
the
recordings
produce
a
high
equivalence at high confidence level with 93.0%
equivalence at 90% confidence level.
The observed good performance and similarity
between the signals of both the Ag-AgCl electrodes
and the textrodes on the sensorized armband
fabricated using intarsia-knitting techniques suggest
that the use of intarsia as a method of forming
electrical connections is valid. There is no evidence
of cross talk between the signals on the band or
noise added by the knitted pathways. The intarsia
electrical pathways therefore seem to provide a
reliable interface for sEMG recordings.
Due to the high level of accuracy of the textile
electrode found in the offline pattern recognition
system, their use in this sensing application would
be able to provide a fully integrated textile solution
to reduce the application time and skin irritation due
to the long-term use of conventional gel Ag-AgCl
electrodes. The lack of chemical agents from the
adhesive and hydrogel layer and avoidance of
irritation of the skin upon removal of the electrode
are a certain advantage to increase patient comfort
by avoiding skin irritation [3].The textrodes would
be useful for muscular therapies for amputees such
as
treatment
for
phantom
limb
pain
and
strengthening of the residual muscle as well as
myoelectric prosthetics,
which require wearing
electrodes for extended periods of time.
V. CONCLUSIONS
The preliminary results from this study suggest
both that the intarsia technique for knitting in
electrical pathways and the knitted textile electrodes
could
provide
a
quality
interface
for
sEMG
monitoring of upper arm movements.
Further research must be done in finding the
effect of washing and wearing of the textrodes and
the
sensorized
intarsia
knitted
band
on
the
classification performance and signal quality of the
recordings.
Furthermore
live
recordings
of
transradial amputees for movement prediction must
be performed in the next steps.
The viability of using textile electrodes and the
intarsia knitted electrical pathways on healthy
subjects with offline pattern recognition using a
fully integrated intarsia-based textile system has
been successfully evaluated. Given the current
penetration
of
intarsia
knitting
in
the
textile
industry, we might have found the way towards true
volume
manufacturing
of
seamless
integrated
textile-electronic sensorized garments.
