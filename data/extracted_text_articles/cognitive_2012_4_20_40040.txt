Abstract— We investigate the impact of configuration of multi-
stimuli presented in computer monitor to steady-state visual 
evoked potential response. The configuration of stimuli is 
defined by three parameters-the size of stimuli, the separation 
distance between the stimuli and the layout. Two 4 by 4 
checkerboards in twelve configurations were presented to the 
subjects.  9 subjects participated in this study. Subjects’ 
electroencephalography (EEG) data was off-line analyzed by 
using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The mean classification 
rates of configuration with bigger size and larger separation 
distance is higher than those configurations with smaller size 
and shorter separation distance. These results suggest that the 
stimulus size is the most important parameter of three, 
followed by the separation distance and layout.

 INTRODUCTION  
Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) give their users 
communication and control channels that do not depend on 
the brain’s normal output channels of peripheral nerves and 
muscles [1].  BCIs allow people with severe motor 
disabilities to communicate with the environment or control 
device through an alternative channel, which does not 
depend on normal motor output of the nervous system [2][3].  
BCI requires an input brain signal from the user in order 
to interpret his or her intent and translate it into a command. 
BCIs can use invasive or non-invasive methods to access the 
brain signal. Non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) 
based methods are most commonly used due to their 
properties: ease of use, flexibility, high time resolution, low 
cost and low risk [4][5]. Several EEG-based BCI paradigms 
have been successful in conveying EEG signals to control 
devices [6]. 
Many brain signals can be recorded with EEG and used 
as the input of BCIs. One of these is Steady-state-visual-
evoked-potential (SSVEP), which some recent studies have 
shown its advantages of higher accuracy rate, speed, 
scalability and no/less training required compared to other 
BCI paradigms [3][7][8]. 
A practical SSVEP based BCI should enable more than 
one command, which in turn necessitates the presentation of 
more than one visual stimulus concurrently. In this study, we 
focused on the use of the computer monitor as the visual 
stimulator, which provides greater flexibility and user 
friendly features in graphic interface than LED.  
Current SSVEP BCI studies focus on the comparison of 
different stimulators [9][10] and signal classification 
methods [8][11][12][13][14]. The impact of the unattended 
target to the response of attended target is rarely discussed.  
The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of the 
properties of multi-stimuli in terms of their size, separation 
distance and their layout on SSVEP response. The results of 
this study will help the practical SSVEP based BCI design. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II 
presents the setup and protocol of the experiment and a 
description of the data acquisition method. The results are 
discussed in Section III. The conclusion is presented in 
Section IV.

METHODS 
This section explains the setup and protocol of the 
experiment. 
A. Stimulus configurations and parameters 
The visual stimuli used in this study were generated by 
Matlab® and Psychophysics Toolbox Version 3 (PTB-3) 
[17]. The functions of PTB can create accurately controlled 
visual stimuli for the experiment. To evaluate the impact of 
stimuli configurations experiment, two black and white 4x4 
checkerboards were presented to the subject on a CRT or 
LCD computer monitor.  Twelve configurations were tested 
in the experiment.  
A configuration is defined by three parameters,  
(1) Size of stimulus,  
(2) Separation distance between two stimuli and  
(3) Layout of the stimuli.  
The details of 12 configurations (C1 to C12) and the 
parameters are listed in Table I. 
In this experiment, three criteria were used to select the 
stimulation frequencies.  
(1) The selected frequencies can elicit strong SSVEP, 
(2) The selected frequencies cannot be harmonics to 
each other or have common harmonics under 50Hz  and 
(3) The frequency pair should have stable frequency 
output in the stimulation.  
We pair all sub-frequencies of the monitor refresh rate to 
simulate the experiment and get the frequency output.

Following these criteria, the simulation results and 75Hz 
of the refresh rate of the monitor (CRT and LCD), 15Hz and 
12.5Hz were used in the experiment. 
B. Data Acquisition 
A 128 channels EEG cap was placed at each subject’s 
scalp. The middle line of the cap is lined up with nasion and 
inion. To eliminate the dead skin, EEG abrasive skin 
prepping gel (Nuprep Gel) was applied to the electrode sites 
first. To reduce the impedance between scalp and electrode, 
EEG conductive gel (Electro-Gel) was applied to the same 
sites. The impedance was kept under 5kΩ. The EEG 
acquisition hardware and software were SynAmps2 
(amplifier) and NeuroScan 4.5 (recording software). 
The most significant SSVEP can be recorded at the 
channels over the visual cortex. 11 channels over visual 
cortex were selected as signal channels while Cz was chosen 
as the ground and Fz was chosen as the reference channel. 
The channel selection is shown in Figure 1. The electrode is 
AgCl type. The EEG sampling frequency was 2,000 Hz. 
C. Protocol  
Two 4x4 checkerboards were presented to each subject 
on a CRT or a LCD screen. Both CRT and LCD monitors 
can elicit SSVEP responses [9]. There was no significant 
difference 
in 
SSVEP 
response between 
these 
two 
stimulators. CRT is widely used in BCI studies. However, 
due to the popularity of LCD, an LCD monitor was also used 
in this study. 
 Each configuration had 30-45 trials. Each trial had three 
phases, fixation phase, stimulation phase and resting phase. 
During the fixation phase, there is a white cross appearing in 
the centre of the monitor. During the stimulation phase, two 
4x4 checkerboards flickering in different frequencies were 
presented to the subject.  In the resting phase, the screen is 
blank. The information of last stimulation phase (e.g., the 
time of the stimulation, mean frequency output of the 
stimuli, etc.) is displayed on the left upper corner. Three 
phases are illustrated in Figure 2. 
One of the challenges to use monitor as visual stimulator 
is that the frequencies of the stimuli are restricted to the 
monitor refresh rate. The stimulating frequencies have to be 
the sub-frequencies of the monitor refresh rate. This limits 
the selections of the frequencies. 
To avoid visual adaptation, fixation phase takes 2 or 3 
seconds randomly. Resting phase takes 7 or 8 seconds 
randomly. The stimulation phase takes 7 seconds. The 
sequence of the configuration shown to subject was in fixed 
order (C1 to C12) for the first 3 subjects but become random 
in the rest configuration evaluation experiment. 
Subjects were asked to attend the left stimulus in 
horizontal layout, upper stimulus in vertical layout and left 
upper stimulus in diagonal layout. Each configuration took 
up to 9 minutes (for 30 trials). There is a break between each 
configuration.

SSVEP based BCI interprets users’ intents by analyzing 
SSVEP response. In order to achieve high accuracy, time 
length is an important factor. A SSVEP study [15] showed 
that it requires 2.8 seconds to achieve an average 95% 
accuracy. Some of the signal classification methods, e.g., 
FFT requires a longer time window to prevent turbulence 
caused by spontaneous EEG [16]. The stimulation phase of 
this study took 7 seconds as we also investigated the impact 
of time length.   
The values of configuration of stimuli are illustrated in 
Figure 3. The unit of the parameters (e.g., cell width (cw), 
cell height (ch), horizontal distance (h) and vertical distance 
(v) ) is pixel. 
The resolutions of CRT and LCD used in the experiment 
are 1600x1200 and 1440x900 respectively. Figure 3 shows 
the setup of CRT. The setup of LCD was slightly different, 
but the physical visual of size and layout on the screen were 
similar. 
III. 
DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULT 
FFT was applied to the time domain EEG signal. FFT 
was performed on a single trial/epoch of EEG with different 
epoch time varying from 1 second to 5 seconds. After FFT 
was performed, the power of the frequency spectrum at all 
SSVEP response frequencies will be extracted. The 
harmonics of SSVEP response frequency, which range from 
5Hz to 50Hz were also considered. 
Four types of signal combinations used in the analysis: 
(1) Fundamental: Using the fundamental frequency response 
only. (2) Fundamental + Sub: Using a combination of the 
fundamental frequency and the sub-harmonics, which is no 
lower than 5 Hz. (3) Fundamental + High: Using a 
combination of the fundamental frequency and the higher 
harmonics, which is no higher than 50Hz. (4) Fundamental + 
all: Using a combination of the fundamental frequency and 
all harmonics between 5 to 50 Hz. 
Figure 4 is the average classification rates of all subjects 
in different configurations. Figure 4 is based on 3 seconds 
epoch time. Figure 4 shows that, in general, the 
configurations of big size of stimuli have the higher 
classification rates than those configurations of smaller size 
stimuli. The configurations of large separation distance also 
have higher classification rates than close separation distance 
if the other two parameters are the same, except C3 and C4. 
Horizontal layout has higher average classification rates than 
vertical and diagonal layouts. The results of 4 and 5 second 
epoch are similar. 
A one-way ANOVA analysis was performed to evaluate 
the effect of configurations to classification rates based on an 
epoch time of 3 seconds. The classification rates were further 
divided into four groups. The first three groups are the 
classification rates of C6, C2 and C1, the configurations, 
which resulted in the top three highest classification rates, 
the fourth group is the average classification rates of the 
remaining 9 configurations, CR. (C2, CR), (C6, CR) and 
(C1, CR) are compared. The values of F(1, 6)  are 27.78, 
23.98 and 22.38 respectively with p values 0.0019, 0.0027 
and 0.0032. The differences of classification rates between 
C2, C6, C1 and the rest configurations are significant. 
Figure 5 illustrates the classification rates of one subject 
in 
different 
configurations 
using 
different 
signal 
combinations. Figure 5 is the result of a 4-second epoch.

Figure 4.  Average classification rates of all subjects of different signal combinations in different configurations. This figure is based on 3 
seconds epoch. 
 
Figure 5.  Classification rates of one subject of different signal combinations in different configurations.
Generally speaking, the configurations of a big size 
stimulus can yield a higher classification rate than the small 
size regardless of the layouts and separation distances. Large 
separation distance has higher rates if the size of stimulus is 
the same and layout is the same. The results from other 
subjects show a similar trend. 
In order to understand the configuration better, four 
possible outcomes are further defined as following. 
(1) True positive. This is when the response of the 
selection is the highest of the responses, which exceed the 
threshold. The number of true positives is referred to as a11. 
(2) Aliasing. This is when both responses at the 
stimulating frequencies exceed the threshold but the response 
at un-attended target is stronger than the one selected. The 
Aliasing is referred to as a12. 
(3) False positive. Only the response at the un-attended 
exceeds the threshold. The number of false positive is 
referred to as a21. 
(4) No response. None of the responses exceed the 
threshold. No response is referred to as a22. 
These four parameters provide another perspective view 
on the impact of the configurations on elicited SSVEP. The 
same elements of the matrix of each subject using the same 
signal combinations were added. a11 is used to examine the 
number of proper SSVEP responses; we use a12 to examine 
the number of aliasing responses caused by un-attended 
frequency; use a21 to examine the number of false positive 
and use a22 to examine the number of no SSVEP responses. 
Table II shows the grand total of true positive, aliasing, 
false positive and no response of all subjects of all different 
epoch time (1 to 5 seconds). 
It is clearly seen from Table II that C2 and C6 have the 
overall best performance in all configurations with more true 
positive and less aliasing, false positive and no response. 
Table III is one subject’s analysis result in all 
configurations with different signal combinations. This table 
is based on an epoch time of 4 seconds.

This table indicates that the configurations of big size 
stimulus and large separation distance can produce more true 
positive while reduces the number of aliasing, false positive 
and no response, e.g., C2. While the configurations of small 
size stimulus, has less true positive and produce more 
aliasing and/or false positive and/or no response, e.g., C7, 
C11. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
From the analyzed in last session, it is clear that the size 
of stimulus plays the most important role in the configuration 
parameters, followed by separation distance and followed by 
the layout. We conclude that the configurations with big 
stimulus size, like C1, C2 and C6 can result in better SSVEP 
response with less aliasing.
