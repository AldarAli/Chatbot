Abstract—Many people feel a lack of efficiency while working
in an Open-Plan Work-Space because of ambient noise and
low privacy. Although recent research has analyzed the
application of virtual reality technology for the improvement
of work efficiency, as far as we know, there are no studies
focused
on
analyzing
how
to
design
a
virtual
reality
environment that can maintain or improve work efficiency.
This article proposes a Virtual Reality Work-Space solution to
focus on work efficiency. The preliminary experiment of this
research compared the proposed Virtual Reality Work-Space
with the Open-Plan Work-Space and showed that the proposed
workspace helped participants gain better work efficiency.
Keywords - virtual reality; workspace; work efficiency.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Open-Plan Work-Space (OPWS) is an office style that
allows many employees to work simultaneously in a wall-
less, partition-less environment. OPWS is characterized by a
high sense of openness, low cost, encouraging cooperation,
and improving the collective wisdom of the team. More and
more companies have chosen this kind of office since its
birth in the last century. Although OPWS has already proven
its value, there still exist many shortcomings. For example,
studies have shown that OPWS often produces adverse
effects, such as noise, stress, conflict, high blood pressure,
and high turnover rate, etc., among others [1][2]. The noise
has the most apparent impact on work efficiency. Compared
to quiet rooms, noise interference in OPWS reduces work
efficiency by one third [3]. Not only is the OPWS full of
auditory and visual interference, but also the low level of
privacy protection causes psychological stress to employees
and reduces work efficiency. Although many researchers
have been working to solve these problems, they still cannot
declare that these problems are entirely solved. The obvious
point is that most of the proposals suggest creating an
additional workspace that needs extra cost. For example, the
proposal of providing employees with various additional
spaces to alleviate the problem [4] will be very difficult in
some
countries
with
demanding
space
utilization
requirements, such as Japan, and some companies are often
unable to find enough space.
On the other hand, in response to the work efficiency
reduction problem caused by auditory and visual interference
in the environment, Microsoft has proposed a Virtual Reality
Work-Space (VRWS) that supports typing. People can use
this VRWS in the original OPWS without adding additional
space costs [5]. Meanwhile, VRWS is a virtual personal
space independent of OPWS, so it can also solve the
psychological pressure caused by the lack of privacy
protection of employees in the public environment. So, this
research assumes that this technology has great potential to
solve the problems in OPWS. However, no studies are
showing how VRWS can be designed to maintain or
improve work efficiency. On the other hand, there are some
opinions that virtual reality technology cannot benefit the
work itself [6].
Some VRWSs have already been used to support people's
office work. Among them, the VRchat [7] and Oculus
Virtual Desktop [8] are the leading examples of VRWS.
VRchat is a virtual reality-based social platform with more
than 2 million users. It allows users to interact with others as
3D character models. Oculus Virtual Desktop also has a
huge user group, which is offering excellent image quality
and some useful extra features to help users with their work.
In this VRWS, only a virtual desktop is shown to them, as
shown on the right side of Figure 1.
Figure 1.
The scene of VRchat office and Oculus Virtual Desktop.
VRchat allows for custom VR environments, but there
are no studies to show how VRWS can be designed to
maintain or improve work efficiency. Thus, the design of the
VR environment relies entirely on personal customization.
Oculus Virtual Desktop even ignores VR environment
design and shows the dim universe to the user. It is hard to
believe that work efficiency would benefit from these kinds
of VR environments. We believe that the VR environment
can be a solution to improve or maintain work efficiency. It
is different from existing ones, and the VRWS which we
have suggested has a good environment that can improve
work efficiency.
This research focuses on proving that VRWS can deal
with work efficiency, and, at the same time, identifying the

factors which, in virtual reality, affect work efficiency. In
this article, the research consists of the following questions:

What kind of VRWS may handle work efficiency?

How to find the factors that affect work efficiency in
VRWS?
The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section
II describes the related work. Section III introduces the
experimental design, result, and analysis in detail. The
conclusion and future work are presented in Section IV.

RELATED WORK
In order to clarify the position of this research, this
section introduces related work on previous OPWS and
VRWS
for
targeted
working
spaces,
and
Semantic
Differential as an evaluation method.
A.
OPWS and VRWS
The environment of OPWS not only directly affects
people's health and enthusiasm for work, but also affects
work efficiency [1]-[3]. A pleasant office environment
should be a cozy space that has no visual and auditory
interference, good lighting, a controlled sound environment,
and plenty of natural light [9]-[12].
According to our investigation, there is currently no
research to confirm what VRWS design standards can
maintain or improve work efficiency. Although there have
been a couple of research works proposing solutions to
improve the shortcomings of OPWS, it is not sure whether
the solutions for OPWS can be applied to VRWS. The
research tends to create a VRWS with excellent OPWS
characteristics to maintain or improve work efficiency.
B.
Semantic Differential
Semantic Differential (SD) was proposed by Osgood in
1957 as a method of psychological measurement [13]. The
analytical method of the SD is to use "language" in
semantics as the scale for experiments, and quantitatively
describe the concept and structure of the research object
through the analysis of various established scales.
The SD method for workspace can be summarized as
follows: study the psychological response of participants in
the space to various environmental characteristics of the
target
space,
develop
a
"semantic"
scale
for
these
psychological responses, and then, evaluated and analyze all
the description parameters of the scale to quantitatively
describe the concept and structure of the space target.
Therefore, we adopt SD analysis to compare the
quantification of different emotions obtained from the
participants in both OPWS and VRWS. We obtain the
difference
between
the
two
office
environments
on
participants and we find the factors that impact work
efficiency that exist only in VRWS.
III.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND DISCUSSION
The purpose of this experiment is to compare the
respective effects of OPWS with VRWS and explore
whether VRWS can deal with users’ work efficiency.
A.
Experimental Design of OPWS
OPWS is very popular all over the world, and different
types of work content will also produce OPWS with
different characteristics. For example, the call center is a
typical noisy OPWS because answering a call is an essential
task in the call center. In this environment, working noise is
unavoidable. There are also different types of OPWS. For
example, librarians rarely worry about noise.
It was difficult to find a typical noisy OPWS in the area
where the authors live. In order to control the experimental
settings, we decided to use the Cave Automatic Virtual
Environment (CAVE) system to simulate a typical noisy
OPWS. The CAVE system is a projection-based virtual
reality system, which consists of several projection screens
surrounding the participants and it can produce a completely
immersive virtual environment. At the same time, mini-
speakers were arranged around the CAVE system to restore
the simulated OPWS sound environment as much as
possible.
Therefore,
the
CAVE
system
used
in
this
experiment can make the participants feel the real situation
of a noisy OPWS very well.
The experimental arrangement of this study based on the
CAVE system is shown in Figure 2. Five participants in the
group performed experiments together in the CAVE system.
There were five seats in the CAVE system, and a laptop and
a mouse were placed in each seat to allow the participants to
take the CAB test.

For the content played in the CAVE system, the
simulated OPWS chosen for this experiment was the
mission
center
of
National
Aeronautics
and
Space
Administration (NASA) [18]. One of the frequent activities
in
this
content
was
to
exchange
information
among
employees. Figure 3 shows the scene in the OPWS
condition.

Experimental Design of VRWS
We
assumed
a
VRWS
with
excellent
OPWS
characteristics, which was an environment without visual
and auditory interference, good lighting, sufficient natural
light, and privacy protection, with the expectation to
maintain or improve work efficiency. In order to make
VRWS met the above requirements, we did the following
steps.
In order to avoid the visual and auditory interference from
the environment, we decided to use a combination of Head
Mounted Display (HMD) and noise-canceling earphones.
The HMD could completely isolate the visual interference in
the
environment,
and
the
muffler
headphones
could
eliminate most of the auditory interference. Figure 4 shows
the combination of HMD and noise-canceling earphones.
Figure 4.
HMD and noise-canceling earphones.
In order to create a present lighting environment, in the
initial design stage of the virtual model, we increased the
brightness of the model and used natural light sources
instead of ordinary light sources to make the light fill the
entire virtual space.
For the requirement of enough natural light, we designed
some large floor-to-ceiling windows to replace the walls on
either side of the VRWS. For privacy protection, we
designed VRWS as a personal workspace that could not be
shared with others. In the VRWS experiment, an HMD with
a computer and mouse was provided to the participants to
complete the experiment. The HMD used in this experiment
is Acer Windows Mixed Reality headset AH101. Each
participant experimented alone in this setting. Through the
above steps, we developed the VRWS, as shown in Figure 5.
Figure 5.

C.
Comparative Experiments
A total of 20 people participated in the experiment,
consisting of 9 females and 11 males, from 24 to 30 years
old. The participants were fluent in English, but had no
previous experience with VR systems and were recruited by
an open call as a small part-time job for the experiment. The
experiment
invited
the
participants
to
share
their
opinions/feelings while working in specific environments
rather than doing complicated problems. The complexity of
the experiment might not affect the participants’ motivation
to join the experiment. In addition, the experiment was about
50 minutes for each participant, which was considered as a
short experiment. The reward was 'thanks for their time', and
that did not change their motivation much.
Before
starting
the
experiment,
we
informed
the
participants about the experiment process, gathered data and
got approval from them. Next, we assigned all participants
randomly to groups A, B, C, and D. Each group consisted of
five participants. Among them, groups A and C performed
OPWS experiments before VRWS experiments. Groups B
and D performed the experiments in the reverse order. The
duration of each experiment was about 25 minutes and after
the experiment, each participant was asked to fill a
questionnaire. After the experiments, all the data and
questionnaires were collected to compare OPWS and VRWS.
D.
Cognitive Assessment Battery Test
In this experiment, each participant was required to
complete his/her "work" in OPWS and VRWS. Therefore,
we adopted the Cognitive Assessment Battery (CAB) test
consisting
of
no
language-based
questions
with
only
numbers and pictures. This test avoids deviation, such as
caused by different understanding speeds and understanding
difficulty in different languages.
The purpose of the CAB test was to measure people's
logical thinking ability. Thus, in this "work" process, the
participants were expected to concentrate on solving the test
as an essential requirement. We assumed that there is a
306

relationship
between
the
CAB
test
results
and
work
efficiency.
Every participant received an electronic test containing
45 questions for each experiment. The participants were
requested to complete as many CAB tests as possible within
25 minutes. Participants could only answer the questions one
by one. Each test question had four options. In order to rule
out errors due to condition differences, the participants were
requested not to use all tools except a mouse during the
answering process in both settings. The questions were
designed with reference to some related works [14][15].
Some examples of the CAB test questions are shown in
Figure 6.
Figure 6.
Examples of CAB test.
At the same time, these three kinds of test questions
appeared in the same proportion in each set of test papers
for each participant. The ratio of the test types is shown in
Figure 7.

E.
Questionnaire
In order to use the SD method for evaluation, the
expression phrases in the questionnaire were designed with
reference to Research on Emotional Engineering [16] and
Versatility of Building Language Description [17]. The set
adjective pairs are shown in Table I. The reason for
choosing these phrases is because they can express people’s
feelings where they are at the workspace.
The evaluation scale in this experiment was divided into
seven levels. A small value was given for a negative
evaluation, and a large value was given for a positive
evaluation.

Results
The more correct answers and the less time it took means
the more efficiently the subjects worked. Similarly, the more
correct answers per unit time one got, the more efficiently
one worked. Thus, we calculated the difference between the
number of correct results of the CAB test in each subject's
OPWS and VRWS and the difference between the times
taken in the two experiments.
For the questionnaire, the adjective pairs were compared
with the average of the two groups’ results. As shown in
Figure 8, lower points are negative evaluations and higher
points are positive evaluations.

In order to ensure the validity of this study, a student's t-
test (t-test) was used to analyze the data further. In this study,
SPSSAU [19] was used for data analysis.
Before performing the t-test, we needed to confirm the
normality of the sample. Because the number of sample data
from the CAB test and the questionnaire were all less than 50,
the Shapiro-Wilk test was chosen. Through the Shapiro-Wilk
test, although some sample data were considered to have no
normality traits because their P-values were under 0.05, their
absolute values of Kurtosis were all less than 10, and the
absolute values of Skewness were all less than 3. So, even
though some sample data were not the standard normal
distribution, the data could basically be accepted as a normal
distribution. Therefore, all the sample data can be considered
to follow the normal distribution. So, we adopted the t-test to
analyze the sample data. T-test results on the CAB test are
shown in Table II, and t-test results on the questionnaire are
shown in Table III.

G.
Findings
In this research, each experiment was conducted for
about 25 minutes, so we guessed that the time was not long
enough to make a significant differences in the number of
Correct Answers and Difference in Time between the two
experiments.
A small number of participants could not bear the noisy
environment in OPWS. In order to leave as soon as possible,
they completed the CAB test at the fastest speed possible
while giving the correct answer as much as possible.
Therefore, these participants believed that although they
could not bear the unbearable interference in OPWS, from
the perspective of the results, the work efficiency was
improved.
From OPWS to VRWS, although it was more beneficial
for participants to answer CAB tests, it was impossible to
make difficult questions easier just because the environment
become better, so the Correct Answers had no significant
difference.
The results of Q14 shows an effect of sufficient
separation of auditory interference by noise-canceling
earphones. At the same time, we believe that the no
auditory interference environment also has a positive effect
on the results of many significant and marginally significant
items.
The results of Q1, Q7, Q9, and Q13 indicate the floor-
to-ceiling windows greatly improve the subject's vision.
The virtual nature environment surrounding the VRWS
gave the subjects a more natural feeling. Because of the
floor-to-ceiling windows, it was easier for natural light to
enter the room through the windows.
As shown in the results of Q2, Q3, and Q9, compared
with the noisy environment of OPWS, the elegant and
comfortable virtual environment design and private use
features can play a role in preventing psychological
pressure.
HMD must be worn when using VRWS. There might be
a negative effect in the physical sense, but the impact was
not significant from the results of Q4, Q10, Q15, and Q16.
The CAVE system used in this experiment had good
lighting effects, so the participants did not strongly feel the
difference in lighting effects between the two experiments
from the result of Q5.
308

ACHI 2020 : The Thirteenth International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interactions

There was no difference between Q15 and Q16 because
wearing
HMD could be an
obstacle to
face-to-face
communication.
When
considering
other
network
communication methods such as e-mail, HMD only caused
communication failure in certain situations.
Most of the participants rejected the use of HMD for a
long time. The main reasons were: the weight and volume
of the HMD put an extra burden on long-term work, and
virtual reality might cause vertigo. VRWS did not have
sufficient input support and HMD cooling problems. These
reasons have led to the results of Q6, Q8, and Q11.
The participants did not notice the visual interference
problem in OPWS from the result of Q12. HMD is a
display device wrapped around the eyes of the user, and the
user could no longer feel the external visual interference,
theoretically. Considering that the CAVE system was used
to simulate OPWS in the comparative experiment, the busy
scene in the noisy OPWS is displayed in 2D by several
projection surfaces around the participants in the CAVE
system, which might affect the psychological reality of
visual interference. Thereby, they reduced the intensity of
interference. Furthermore, the contrast effect between
OPWS and VRWS in Q12 in the movement was not
significant.
In previous VRWS work, it was not considered that VR
environments
could
be
a solution
to
improve
work
efficiency. However, this research and experiments showed
that there is indeed a significant difference in some factors
in the VR environment. The previous VRWS could not find
these factors because of the simple VR environment. So,
participants’ work efficiency could not benefit from their
VR environment. The research has also demonstrated those
factors in the discussion section.
IV.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
From the experiments, it is hard to confirm that VRWS
could maintain or improve work efficiency. Aiming at work
efficiency, the conclusions of OPWS related research maybe
can be used as a design standard for VRWS. Through this
research, we can know that VRWS has generally received
higher
evaluations
and
has
more
significant
positive
evaluations on Relaxing, Enjoyable, and Not noisy in sound.
Using VRWS based on OPWS related research conclusions
as design standard, compared to OPWS, people can get a
wider
virtual
vision
environment,
can
reduce
the
psychological pressure, feel a freer atmosphere, enjoy the
office process more, and have a quieter office. Also, VRWS
may be more comfortable, may have better lighting effects,
help generate positive emotions, increase work enthusiasm,
and increase work efficiency.
For future work, we first plan to improve the defects of
the VRWS input. Because a person wearing the HMD cannot
see the surrounding environment, it makes the use of the
keyboard, paper, pen, and other tasks more difficult. Through
the camera connected to the HMD, the keyboard, paper, and
pen can be recognized and displayed in VRWS, which is
convenient for users. This also means turning VRWS into
Augmented Reality Work-Space (ARWS). In addition, for
the virtual environment part of VRWS, we will consider the
ability to customize it, which will further improve the
practicality of VRWS and improve work efficiency.
