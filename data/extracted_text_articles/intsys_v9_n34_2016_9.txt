Abstract—A fundamental problem in engineering consists of
designing adaptive output feedback controllers for stabilizing
plants affected by parameters. This paper addresses this prob-
lem by proposing a novel approach for designing ﬁxed-order
ﬁxed-degree adaptive parameter-dependent output feedback con-
trollers. The proposed approach requires the solution of convex
optimization problems with linear matrix inequalities, and pro-
vides a sufﬁcient condition based on the construction of a function
that quantiﬁes a stability margin of the closed-loop system
depending on the controller. This condition is nonconservative
under some mild assumptions by increasing the size of the linear
matrix inequalities.

I. INTRODUCTION
A fundamental problem in engineering consists of stabi-
lizing a plant. This is generally achieved by designing a
stabilizing output feedback controller, i.e., a controller that
elaborates the output of the plant in order to provide an input
for the plant that makes the closed-loop system is stable. The
design of such a controller is based on the model of the plant,
and several techniques can be used.
Real plants are often affected by parameters. These can
happen due to various reasons. One reason is that such
parameters can represent quantities that the user can modify,
such as the gain of an ampliﬁer, in order to achieve a different
performance. Another reason is that such parameters can
represent quantities that are unknown or subject to changes,
such as the mass, resistance, temperature, etc.
Whenever the plant is affected by parameters, the output
feedback controller should be able to ensure stability for all
admissible values of the parameters. For this, the controller
should be dependent on the parameters in general, i.e., should
be able to adapt to different plants corresponding to different
values of the parameters. Such a controller would be, hence,
adaptive, in particular parameter-dependent.
This paper addresses this problem, speciﬁcally, the design
of adaptive output feedback controllers for stabilizing plants
affected by time-invariant parameters. A preliminary confer-
ence version of this paper appeared as reported in [1].
It turns out that this is a difﬁcult problem. Indeed, several
conditions do exist in the literature for establishing stability
of systems affected by parameters, in particular conditions
based on convex optimization constrained by Linear Matrix
Inequalities (LMIs); see for instance [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]
[9]. However, such conditions lead to nonconvex optimization
whenever a controller is searched for, due to the product of the
Lyapunov function and the controller that generates Bilinear
Matrix Inequalities (BMIs). See also [10] [11] for related
studies. Also, several non-LMI strategies are available for the
design of stabilizing feedback controllers for plants that are
not affected by parameters, however, for plants affected by
parameters, such strategies cannot be easily used in general.
In order to deal with this problem, a novel approach is
proposed in this paper, which allows one to design a ﬁxed-
order ﬁxed-degree adaptive parameter-dependent output feed-
back controller by solving convex optimization problems with
LMIs. The proposed approach requires the solution of convex
optimization problems with LMIs, and provides a sufﬁcient
condition based on the construction of a function that quan-
tiﬁes a stability margin of the closed-loop system depending
on the controller. This function is searched for by exploiting
polynomials that can be written as Sums Of Squares (SOS) of
polynomials. The sufﬁcient condition provided in this paper is
nonconservative under some mild assumptions by increasing
the size of the LMIs. Some numerical examples illustrate the
proposed approach. This paper extends the technique for the
design of robust static output feedback controllers proposed in
our previous work [12].
The paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces
the preliminaries. Section III discusses the motivation. Section
IV describes the proposed approach. Section V present some
illustrative examples. Lastly, Section VI concludes the paper
with some ﬁnal remarks.

A. Problem Formulation
The notation adopted in this paper is as follows:
• N: set of nonnegative integer numbers;
• R: set of real numbers;
• C: set of complex numbers;
• I: n×n identity matrix (of size speciﬁed by the context);
• A′: transpose of matrix A;
• adj(A): adjoint of matrix A;
• det(A): determinant of matrix A;
• spec(A): set of eigenvalues of matrix A;
• A > 0: symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix A;
• A ≥ 0: symmetric positive semideﬁnite matrix A;
• deg(a(x)): degree of polynomial a(x);
• s.t.: subject to.
Let us consider the plant
 ˙x(t)
=
Apla(p)xpla(t) + Bpla(p)u(t)
y(t)
=
Cpla(p)xpla(t) + Dpla(p)u(t)
(1)
where t ∈ R is the time, xpla(t) ∈ Rnpla is the state,
u(t) ∈ Rnu is the input, y(t) ∈ Rny is the output, p ∈ Rq
is the vector of time-invariant parameters, and the matrices
Apla(p), Bpla(p), Cpla(p) and Dpla(p) are given matrix
polynomials.
It is supposed that the vector of parameters is constrained
into a semi-algebraic set, in particular
p ∈ P
(2)
where
P = {p ∈ Rq : ai(p) ≥ 0, i = 1 . . . , na}
(3)
and ai(p), i = 1, . . . , na, are polynomials.
The plant (1) is controlled by the parameter-dependent
output feedback controller
(
˙
xcon(t)
=
Acon(p)xcon(t) + Bcon(p)y(t)
u(t)
=
Ccon(p)xcon(t) + Dcon(p)y(t)
(4)
where xcon(t) ∈ Rncon is the state of chosen order ncon ∈
N, and the matrices Acon(p), Bcon(p), Ccon(p) and Dcon(p)
are matrix polynomials to determine of chosen degree. For
computation purpose, these matrix polynomials are expressed
as









Acon(p)
=
ΦA(p, v)
Bcon(p)
=
ΦB(p, v)
Ccon(p)
=
ΦC(p, v)
Dcon(p)
=
ΦD(p, v)
(5)
where v ∈ Rw is a vector of design variables, and ΦA(p, v),
ΦB(p, v), ΦC(p, v) and ΦD(p, v) are matrix polynomials in
p and v. The vector of design variables is searched for in the
semi-algebraic set
V = {v ∈ Rw : bi(v) ≥ 0, i = 1 . . . , nb}
(6)
where bi(v), i = 1, . . . , nb, are polynomials. We denote the
set of controllers (4) obtainable for v ∈ V as C, i.e.,
C = {⟨ΦA(p, v), ΦB(p, v), ΦC(p, v), ΦD(p, v)⟩ : v ∈ V} .
(7)
The problem addressed in this paper is as follows.
Problem 1: Find a ﬁxed-order ﬁxed-degree output feedback
controller (4) in the set C such that the closed-loop system (1)–
(4) is well-posed and asymptotically stable for all parameters
p ∈ P.
□
Let us observe that Problem 1 contains several speciﬁc
problems of interest, in particular the design of:
1) ﬁxed-order (such as static) output feedback controllers
for parameter-free systems, i.e., with no dependence on
p;
2) common ﬁxed-order (such as static) output feedback
controllers for systems affected by parameters;
3) parameter-dependent (such as linearly) ﬁxed-order (such
as static) output feedback controllers for systems af-
fected by parameters.
B. SOS Polynomials
Here we brieﬂy review SOS polynomials; see for instance
[13] and references therein for details. Let us start by
introducing the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 1: A polynomial h(v) is said to be SOS if there
exist polynomials ˜hi(v), i = 1, . . . , k, such that
h(v) =
k
X
i=1
hi(v)2.
(8)
□
A necessary and sufﬁcient condition for establishing
whether a polynomial is SOS can be given in terms of
feasibility of an LMI. Speciﬁcally, let d ∈ N be such that
deg(h(v)) ≤ 2d.
(9)
Let v{d}
∈
Rσ(w,d) be a vector whose entries are the
monomials of degree not greater than d in x, e.g., according
to
v{d} =

where σ(w, d) is the total number of such monomials given
by
σ(w, d) = (w + d)!
w!d!
.
(11)
Then, h(v) can be expressed as
h(v) = v{d}′ (H + L(α)) v{d}
(12)
where H ∈ Rσ(w,d)×σ(w,d) is a symmetric matrix such that
h(v) = v{d}′Hv{d},
(13)
L : Rω(w,d) → Rσ(w,d)×σ(w,d) is a linear parametrization of
the linear subspace
L(w, d) = {L = L′ : w{d}′Lw{d} = 0},
(14)
and α ∈ Rω(w,d) is a free vector, where ω(w, d) is the
dimension of L(w, d) given by
ω(w, d) = 1
2σ(w, d)(σ(w, d) + 1) − σ(w, 2d).
(15)
The representation (12) is known as Gram matrix method
and square matricial representation (SMR). This representation
allows one to establish whether a polynomial is SOS via
an LMI feasibility test, which amounts to solving a convex
optimization problem. Indeed, h(v) is SOS if and only if there
exists α satisfying the LMI
H + L(α) ≥ 0.
(16)
III. MOTIVATION
This section explains the motivation for the proposed study.
Speciﬁcally, Section III-A presents an example where the set
of controllers that solve Problem 1 is nonconvex, and Section
III-B presents an example where Problem 1 can be solved
with a parameter-dependent controller but cannot be solved
with a common controller.
A. Example 1
Hereafter, we present an example that highlights the
difﬁculty of solving Problem 1, in particular showing that
the set of controllers that solve this problem can be nonconvex.
Indeed, let us consider the plant (1) with

where the parameter p is constrained into the set
P = [−2, 2].
This plant is controlled in closed-loop by the feedback con-
troller (4) chosen of the form

u(t)

i.e., a parameter-dependent static output feedback controller
of degree not greater than 1 in the parameter. This controller
is expressed as in (5) with
ΦD(p, v) = v1 + v2p
where v ∈ R2 is the vector of design variables constrained
into the set
V = [−2, 2]2.
Figure 2 shows the set of controllers v that solve Problem
1 found by brute force. As it can be seen, there exist
parameter-dependent controllers
but

IV. PROPOSED APPROACH
This section provides the proposed approach. Speciﬁcally,
Section IV-A derives the equation of the closed-loop system,
Section IV-B investigates the well-posedness, Section IV-C
tackles the asymptotical stability, Section IV-D derives the
optimization problem used to determine a sought solution,
Section IV-E explains how to determine such a solution,
Section
IV-F
investigates
the
non-conservatism
of
the
proposed approach, and Section IV-G reports some remarks.
A. Closed-Loop System
The ﬁrst step of the proposed approach is to express the
closed-loop system (1)–(4) as
˙x(t) = A(p, v)x(t)
(17)
where x ∈ Rn is the state
x(t) =

xpla(t)
xcon(t)

(18)
of dimension
n = npla + ncon,
(19)
and A(p, v) is a matrix rational function in p and v. In
particular, the expression of A(p, v) is given by
A(p, v) =
 A1(p, v)
A2(p, v)
A3(p, v)
A4(p, v)


Let us observe that the matrix A(p, v) in (17) does exist for
all parameters p ∈ P for some controller v whenever
E(p, v) is non-singular ∀p ∈ P.
(25)
In this paper we impose well-posedness of the closed-loop
system (1)–(4) by requiring that
|Aden(p, v)| > ρwep ∀p ∈ P
(26)
where ρwep ≥ 0 is an arbitrary chosen threshold.
C. Asymptotical Stability
The third step of the proposed approach consists of
ensuring asymptotical stability of the closed-loop system
(1)–(4). Let us start by formally deﬁning this concept as
follows.
Deﬁnition 3: The closed-loop system (1)–(4) is said to be
asymptotically stable for all parameters p ∈ P for some
controller v if
ℜ(λ) < 0 ∀λ ∈ spec (A(p, v)) ∀p ∈ P.
(27)
□
In this paper we impose asymptotical stability of the closed-
loop system (1)–(4) by requiring that
ℜ(λ) < −ρsta ∀λ ∈ spec (A(p, v)) ∀p ∈ P
(28)
where ρsta ≥ 0 is an arbitrary chosen threshold.
In order to impose this constraint, let θ ∈ Θ be an auxiliary
variable, where
Θ = {−1, 1},
(29)
and let us deﬁne the characteristic polynomial of θAnum(p, v)
as
c(λ, p, v) = det (λI − θ (Anum(p, v) + ρstaAden(p, v)I))
(30)
where λ ∈ R is an auxiliary variable. Let us express this
characteristic polynomial as
c(λ, p, v) =
n
X
i=0
˜ci(p, v)λi
(31)
where ˜ci(p, v), i = 1, . . . , n, are polynomials in p and v. Let
us build the table
r1,1(p, v)
r1,2(p, v)
. . .
r2,1(p, v)
r2,2(p, v)
. . .
...
...
...
(32)
where the generic entry in position (i, j), i = 3, . . . , n+1 and
j = 1, 2, . . ., is given by
ri,j(p, v)
=
ri−1,j(p, v)ri−2,j+1(p, v)
−ri−2,j(p, v)ri−1,j+1(p, v)
(33)
by using the initialization
(
r1,j(p, v)
=
˜cn+1−2j(p, v)
r2,j(p, v)
=
˜cn−2j(p, v).
(34)
Let us observe that the entries of the built table are
polynomials in p and v.
The closed-loop system (1)–(4) is asymptotically stable for
all parameters p ∈ P for some controller v if and only if
(
ri,1(p, v)
>
0 ∀i = 2, . . . , n + 1 ∀p ∈ P
θAden(p, v)
>
0.
(35)
D. Optimization Problem
The fourth step of the proposed approach consists of
introducing an optimization problem that will be used to
determine a controller that solves Problem 1, if any.
Let us start by deﬁning the polynomials fi(p, v), i =
1, . . . , n + 1, in p and v as
(
f1(p, v)
=
θAden(p, v) − ρwep
fi(p, v)
=
ri,1(p, v) ∀i = 2, . . . , n + 1.
(36)
Let ξ(v), βi,j(p, v), γi,k(p, v) and δk(v) be auxiliary poly-
nomial variables, i = 1, . . . , n + 1, j = 1, . . . , na and
k = 1, . . . , nb, and let us deﬁne

(37)
where ρpos > 0 is a chosen threshold whose role will be
clariﬁed in the sequel. Let us deﬁne the integral of ξ(v) over
V as
Ξ =
Z
V
ξ(v)dv.
(38)
Let us observe that Ξ is a linear function of the coefﬁcients
of ξ(v).
Let us deﬁne the optimization problem

∀k = 1, . . . , nb.

The optimization problem (39) is convex. Indeed, the cost
function is linear in the decision variables, which are the
coefﬁcients of the polynomials ξ(v), βi,j(p, v), γi,k(p, v)
and δk(v). Moreover, the constraints impose that some
polynomials, which depend afﬁne linearly on the decision
variables, are SOS. From Section II-B it follows that these
constraints are equivalent to LMIs in the decision variables
and auxiliary variables. Therefore, the optimization problem
(39) is convex since the cost function is convex and since the
feasible set is convex.
Let us observe that the polynomial ξ(v) quantiﬁes a
stability margin of the closed-loop system depending on the
controller. This polynomial generalizes the concept of robust
stabilizability function introduced in [12] for the design of
robust static output feedback controllers.
E. Determining The Controller
The ﬁfth step of the proposed approach consists of
determining a controller that solves Problem 1, if any, from
the solution of the optimization problem (39).
Speciﬁcally, let h∗(v) and ξ∗(v) be the optimal values of
the polynomials h(v) and ξ(v) in the optimization problem
(39). Let us deﬁne the set
H = {v ∈ Rw : h∗(v) = 0, ξ∗(v) = ρpos, v ∈ V} .
(40)
The following theorem explains how Problem 1 can be
solved with the proposed approached.
Theorem 1: All vectors v in the set H, if any, deﬁne a
controller (4) with matrices given by (5) that solves Problem
1.
Proof. See Appendix 1.
□
Theorem 1 provides a sufﬁcient condition for the solution
of Problem 1. As it will be explained in the next section, this
condition is nonconservative provided that some assumptions
hold. The condition of Theorem 1 is based on the set H,
which is determined once that the optimization problem (39)
has been solved.
How to determine the set H? This can be done according
to the following two steps:
1) search for the zeros of h∗(v);
2) keep the zeros of h∗(v) that satisfy ξ∗(v) = ρpos and
v ∈ V.
The ﬁrst step can be addressed via linear algebra operations
once that the optimization problem (39) has been solved. A
possibility consists of using the method proposed in [14]
for solving systems of polynomial equations as explained
hereafter:
1) once that the optimization problem (39) has been solved,
one obtains from the LMI solver a positive semideﬁnite
Gram matrix of h∗(v), i.e., a matrix H∗ ≥ 0 such that
h∗(v) = v{d}′H∗v{d}
(41)
where v{d} is a vector of monomials in v;
2) since H∗ ≥ 0, one has that h∗(v) = 0 if and only if
v{d} ∈ ker(H∗).
(42)
Hence, the problem of ﬁnding the zeros of h∗(v) is
equivalent to the problem of ﬁnding vectors of mono-
mials in ker(H∗);
3) the problem of ﬁnding vectors of monomials in ker(H∗)
can be addressed by pivoting operations that reduce the
problem to ﬁnding the roots of a polynomial in a single
variable whenever the dimension of ker(H∗) is smaller
than a certain value as shown in [14].
The second step is trivial since the number of zeros of h∗(v)
is ﬁnite for non-degenerate cases (one just keep the zeros that
satisfy ξ∗(v) = ρpos and v ∈ V through individual tests).
F. Non-Conservatism
The previous section has provided a sufﬁcient condition
for the solution of Problem 1 through Theorem 1. As it
will be explained in the next section, this condition may be
nonconservative. Let us start by introducing the following
assumption.
Assumption 1: The sets P and V are compact. Moreover,
the polynomials ai(p), i = 1, . . . , na, in (3) and bi(v), i =
1, . . . , nb, in (6) have even degree, and their highest degree
forms have no common root except zero.
□
The
following
theorem
explains
that
the
sufﬁcient
condition
provided
by
Theorem
1
is
nonconservative
whenever Assumption 1 holds.
Theorem 2: Suppose that there exists a controller (4) with
matrices given by (5) for some v ∈ V that solves Problem 1.
Also, suppose that Assumption 1 holds. Then, the set H is
nonempty for some θ ∈ Θ for any sufﬁciently small threshold
ρpos > 0.
Proof. See Appendix 2.
□
It is worth observing that Assumption 1 introduces mild
assumptions on Problem 1. Indeed, it is reasonable to assume
that the sets P and V are compact, since the allowed values
for parameters and controllers are bounded in practice, and
since having P and V closed rather than open does not make
differences in general. Also, one can assume without loss of
generality that the polynomials ai(p), i = 1, . . . , na, in (3)

335
International Journal on Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 9 no 3 & 4, year 2016, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/
2016, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
and bi(v), i = 1, . . . , nb, in (6) have even degree, because,
if not, one could multiply the polynomials with odd degree
times linear functions that are positive over P and V in order
to ﬁll this requirement without modifying P and V. Lastly, the
assumption that the highest degree forms of these polynomials
have no common root except zero is automatically satisﬁed
in many cases of interests. For instance, ellipsoids can be
described by polynomials such as
a1(p) = p′M2p + M ′
1p + M0
(43)
where M0 ∈ R, M1 ∈ Rq and M2 ∈ Rq×q, with M2 > 0,
and the highest degree form is p′M2p whose only possible
root is the origin. Moreover, interval sets can be described by
polynomials such as
ai(p) = (mi,− − pi)(pi − mi,+) ∀i = 1, . . . , q
(44)
where mi,−, mi,+ ∈ R, with mi,− ≤ mi,+, and the highest
degree forms are −p2
i whose only possible common root is
the origin.
G. Remarks
The ﬁrst remarks concerns the well-posedness of the closed-
loop system (1)–(4). Let us observe that, whenever the plant
(1) is strictly proper (i.e., Dpla(p) = 0) or the controller
(4) is strictly proper (i.e., Dcon(p) = 0), well-posedness is
automatically satisﬁed, and (26) holds for any ρwep ∈ [0, 1).
This means that the polynomial f1(p, v) in (36) does not need
to be introduced, and one can simply redeﬁne (36) as
fi−1(p, v) = ri,1(p, v) ∀i = 2, . . . , n + 1.

The second remark concerns the polynomials fi(p, v) in
(36). The polynomials fi(p, v) that are known to be positive
over P × V (such as positive constants) do not need to be
introduced, since the proposed approach aims to collect in
the set H vectors v such that the polynomials fi(p, v) are
positive for all parameters p ∈ P. This also implies that,
if there exists a polynomial fi(p, v) that is known to be
non-positive for all parameters p ∈ P (such as non-positive
constants), then Problem 1 has no solution.
The third remark concerns the threshold ρpos introduced in
the polynomial h(v) in (37). This threshold has to be chosen
as a positive number, and it is introduced in order to ensure
that the vectors v in the set H satisfy ξ∗(v) > 0 (since
ξ∗(v) = ρpos). As said in the statement of Theorem 2, non-
conservatism is ensured whenever ρpos is a sufﬁciently small
positive number. Hence, one can simply choose ρpos as the
smallest positive number allowed by the used computer.
V. EXAMPLES
In this section we present some illustrative examples of
the proposed results. The computations are done in Matlab
using the toolbox SeDuMi [15]. The threshold ρwep is not
introduced since the considered plants are strict, and the
other thresholds are chosen as ρsta = 0 and ρpos = 0.1. The
degrees of the polynomials βi,j(p, v), γi,k(p, v) and δk(v) are
chosen as the largest degrees ensuring that the polynomials
gi,j(p, v) and h(v) have their minimum degrees.
A. Example 1 (continued)
Let us continue Example 1. Let us start by observing that
the plant (1) is unstable for some values of the parameter, for

This fact is also shown by Figure 3, which shows the
eigenvalues of the plant for some values of the parameters in

VI. CONCLUSIONS
This paper has addressed the design of adaptive output
feedback controllers for stabilizing plants affected by time-
invariant parameters in the time-invariant case, which is a
fundamental problem in engineering. A novel approach has
been proposed for designing ﬁxed-order ﬁxed-degree adaptive
parameter-dependent output feedback controllers. The pro-
posed approach requires the solution of convex optimization
problems with LMIs, and provides a sufﬁcient condition based
on the construction of a function that quantiﬁes a stability
margin of the closed-loop system depending on the controller.
This condition is nonconservative under some mild assump-
tions by increasing the size of the LMIs. Future work can
consider various directions. For instance, one could extend the
proposed approach to the case of discrete-time systems. Also,
the proposed approach could be generalized in order to deal
with time-varying parameters.
APPENDIX 1
Proof of Theorem 1. Let g∗
i (p, v) be the optimal value of
gi(p, v) in the optimization problem (39). One has that g∗
i (p, v)
is a SOS polynomial. It follows that, for all i = 1, . . . , n + 1,
0

where ξ∗(v), β∗
i,j(p, v) and γ∗
i,k(p, v) are the optimal values of
ξ(v), βi,j(p, v) and γi,k(p, v) in the optimization problem (39).
One has that β∗
i,j(p, v) and γ∗
i,k(p, v) are SOS polynomials.
Suppose v∗ ∈ H. Then, h∗(v∗) = 0, ρpos = ξ∗(v∗) and
v∗ ∈ V. Let p∗ ∈ P. One has aj(p∗) ≥ 0 and bk(v∗) ≥ 0. It
follows that, for all i = 1, . . . , n + 1,
0

fi(p∗, v∗) − ξ∗(v∗) −

fi(p∗, v∗) − ρpos.
Since ρpos > 0 one has
fi(p∗, v∗) > 0 ∀i = 1, . . . , n + 1.
From Sections IV-B–IV-C this implies that the controller v∗
ensures that the closed-loop system (1)–(4) is well-posed and
asymptotically stable for all parameters p ∈ P. Therefore, v∗
solves Problem 1.
APPENDIX 2
Proof of Theorem 2. Suppose that there exists a controller
¯v ∈ V that solves Problem 1. From Sections IV-B–IV-C this
implies that
fi(p, ¯v) > 0 ∀i = 1, . . . , n + 1 ∀p ∈ P
for some θ ∈ Θ. Let us deﬁne the function
¯f(v) =
inf
p∈P
i=1,...,n+1
fi(p, v).
It follows that
¯f(¯v) > 0.
Suppose that Assumption 1 holds. It follows that V is compact.
Hence, there exists a polynomial ξ(v) that approximates
arbitrary well ¯f(v) over V, in particular such that





¯f(v)
≥
ξ(v) ∀v ∈ V
ρpos
≥
ξ(v) ∀v ∈ V
ξ(¯v)

0.
Since P is compact, and since the polynomials ai(p), i =
1, . . . , na, in (3) and bi(v), i = 1, . . . , nb, in (6) have even
degree, and their highest degree forms have no common root
except zero, it follows from [16] that there exist polynomials
βi,j(p, v), γi,k(p, v) and δk(v) such that the constraints of the
optimization problem (39) hold. Since the objective of this
optimization problem is to maximize the integral of ξ(v) over
V, it follows that there exists ρpos > 0 such that
ξ∗(v∗) = ρpos
for some v∗ ∈ V, where ξ∗(v) is the optimal value of ξ(v) in
this optimization problem. Since h∗(v) is a SOS polynomial,
one has
0
≤
h∗(v∗)
=
ρpos − ξ∗(v∗) −
nb
X
k=1
bk(v∗)δ∗
k(v∗)
=
−
nb
X
k=1
bk(v∗)δ∗
k(v∗)
where δ∗
k(v) is the optimal value of δk(v) in the optimization
problem (39). Since δ∗
k(v) is a SOS polynomial, one concludes
that
0 ≤ h∗(v∗) ≤ 0,
which implies that h∗(v∗) = 0. Therefore, v∗ ∈ H, and the
set H is nonempty for the considered value of θ ∈ Θ.
