Abstract—In order to improve the disadvantages of current 
smartphone-based fall detection systems, this paper analyzes the 
characteristics of triaxial accelerometer values to identify 
thresholds of the non-falls and falls, and proposes an improved 
threshold-based fall detection method, which is not only able to 
quickly filter out most of daily activities (including walking 
running, sitting down, and so on) but also to detect the direction of 
four types of falling events. Moreover, as soon as a falling accident 
is detected, the user’s position could be immediately sent to the 
rescue center so as to get medical help. 
Keywords—fall detection; smartphones; triaxial accelerometers. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
In order to solve the fall crisis that the elderly will be faced 
with in daily life, there are many research scholars devoted to 
the research field of fall detection [1]. The fall detection methods 
could be mainly divided into environmental detection type and 
wearable detection type. Environmental detection type is mainly 
to place sensors in the detective areas of daily life. Shieh and 
Huang [2] collected the monitored images from different areas 
by placing numerous surveillance cameras and proposed using a 
pattern recognition approach to detect the elder’s falling event. 
However, the disadvantage of this approach is that fall detection 
is limited to the monitored environment. Also, the privacy issue 
of users is a problem. In order to overcome the disadvantages of 
this type, many research scholars come up with a wearable 
detection method, in which the user wears sensors so as to 
provide human activity data for fall detection. Cheng and Jhan 
[3] used tri-axis acceleration sensor with the proposed cascade-
AdaBoost-support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The 
algorithm could automatically determine whether to replace the 
AdaBoost classiﬁer by SVM. The results are compared to those 
of the neural network, SVM, and the cascade-AdaBoost 
classiﬁer. The experimental results show that the triaxial 
accelerometers around the chest and waist produce optimal 
results, and our proposed method has the highest accuracy rate 
and detection rate as well as the lowest false alarm rate. 
 Tong et al. [4] proposed a hidden Markov model (HMM)-
based method to detect and predict falls using triaxial 
accelerations of a human body. The acceleration time series 
extracted from human motion processes are used to describe 
human motion features and train HMM so as to build a random 
process mathematical model. Thus, the outputs of HMM could 
be used to evaluate the risks to fall. The experiment results 
showed that fall events can be predicted 200-400 ms ahead of 
the occurrence of collisions, and distinguished from other daily 
life activities with an accuracy of 100%. 
With the popularization of smartphones, the mobile phone 
has become an indispensable product in our daily life. Therefore, 
in recent years, many researchers integrate the smartphone into 
fall detection study. In [5], the authors demonstrated techniques 
to detect a fall and also automatically classify the type. Four 
different types of falls, left and right lateral, forward and 
backward falls are discussed and five machine learning 
classifiers are applied to a large time-series feature set to detect 
falls. The results showed that SVM and regularized logistic 
regression were able to identify a fall with 98% accuracy and 
classify the type of fall with 99% accuracy. In [6], the angles 
acquired by the electronic compass and the waveform sequence 
of the triaxial accelerometer on the smartphone are used to 
generate an ordered feature sequence and then examined in a 
sequential manner by their proposed cascade classifier for fall 
detection. The experimental results show that a fall accident 
detection accuracy up to 92% on the sensitivity and 99.75% on 
the specificity could be obtained. 
 
Figure 1. Proposed threshold-based fall detection scheme. 
In this paper, through experimentally analyzing the 
characteristics of triaxial accelerometer values, a threshold-
based fall detection approach has been proposed. As shown in 
Figure 1, the human activities are first classified into motion or 
motionless category by the Threshold-1. Then, in the motion 
class, including the actions of running, walking, tread, going 
up/down stairs, as well as falling, the Threshold-2 is employed 
to recognize the fall events. After detecting a falling accident, a 
rescue service will be carried out by automatic calling and 
sending messages to the emergency center so as to immediately 
get medical help.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
briefly introduces the proposed scheme. Next, preliminary 
experiments are described in Section III. Finally, Section IV 
concludes this paper. 
II. 
PROPOSED METHODS 
As shown in Figure 2, this paper adopts an Android-based 
smartphone, which is assumed to be carried in a front pants 
pocket, as the development platform for fall detection. Moreover, 
a sampling rate of 50 Hz is used to collect sensing data from the 
build-in triaxial accelerometer in a smartphone.

smartphone.  
A. Motion Activities Recognition 
Through observing triaxial accelerometer’s values, it could 
be found that the acceleration changes signiﬁcantly when a fall 
occurs. Therefore, the change of acceleration intensity value can 
be used to determine whether a fall occurs. In this paper, the 
signal magnitude area (SMA) value, defined as (1), is used to 
determine the motion and motionless activities.

where 𝑥[𝑛], 𝑦[𝑛], and 𝑧[𝑛] are the acceleration values of the 
three axes, respectively, at the sampling time 𝑛. 
Through several practical experiments, we found as the user 
is engaged in a motion activity, the SMA value is much higher 
than that in motionless ones, such as sitting and squatting down. 
Figure 3 shows the SMA values for human activities, including 
falling down, sitting down, and squatting down. Table I shows 
the nine types of human activities and its corresponding SMA 
values (the signs + means more and – means less, respectively). 
Hence, the Threshold-1 is determined as 27 m/s2  via 
experimental observations. It is noted that even though this 
parameter is not theoretically proved, the feasibility would be 
later verified via experimental results.

B. Falling Accidents Detection 
In the proposed scheme, four types of falls are considered, 
including the forward, backward, left lateral, and right lateral 
falls, as shown in Figure 4. 
In order to detect falling accidents, the mean values of 
acceleration of single axis would be employed. Since the 
smartphone is assumed to be placed in the front pants pocket, 
the mean values of x-axis acceleration could be used to detect 
lateral falls towards the right and left direction. On the other 
hand, the mean values of z-axis acceleration would be used to 
forward and backward fall detection. As an example, the mean 
values x-axis acceleration is defined as (2).

Figure 5 shows the mean values of x-axis acceleration values 
for human activities, including the lateral fall, run, walk, go 
upstairs, and go downstairs. Hence, the Threshold-2 is 
determined as 10.05 m/s2 via experimental observations. It is 
noted that even though this parameter is not theoretically proved, 
the feasibility would be later verified via experimental results.

as an APP with the user interface as shown in Figure 6. In 
addition, the message flows among the user, fall detection APP, 
and emergency center are shown in Figure 7. Moreover, an 
Android-based smartphone with the speciﬁcation shown in 
Table II [7] is applied to conduct the experiments.

B. Experimental Results 
To conduct the evaluation process, nine different kinds of 
activities including a fall down event, running, walking, sitting 
down, going upstairs, going downstairs, tread, standing up, and 
squatting have been evaluated, each with 50 tests. In order to 
assess the testing effect, accuracy rate (AR), detection rate (DR), 
and false alarm rate (FAR) are expressed as (3), (4), and (5),

wherein 𝑝 and 𝑞 mean the number of collections of the positive 
examples (falls) and negative examples (non-falls), respectively. 
The true positive (TP) represents the number of falls 
successfully detected, true negative (TN) indicates the number 
of non-fall examples successfully detected, and false positive 
(FP) shows the number of non-fall examples detected as a fall. 
The experiments conducted in this paper are based on the 
most frequent human daily activities, which include running, 
walking, sitting down, going upstairs, going downstairs, tread,  
standing up, and squatting, as well as the four types of falls. The 
experimental results of detecting four fall directions are shown 
in Table III. The AR, DR, and FAR are 99%, 96%, and 0.25%, 
respectively. Moreover, the computation time is 17.8 ms. Figure 
8 compares the results of the proposed approach with [6]. It is 
clear that the proposed method is better in terms of AR DR, and 
computation time.  
 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper has proposed a fall detection system for the 
elderly by using smartphones placed in their pants pockets. By 
analyzing acceleration characteristics of three axes x, y, z values, 
effective threshold values to distinguish daily activities and 
falling accident have been determined. The results show the 
proposed method not only has the accuracy rate about 99% but 
also consumes less computation time, which greatly reduces the 
burden of the mobile phone operation. In the current scheme, the 
two thresholds are fixed. Future work will attempt to develop 
adjustable thresholds considering different users.
