Abstract— This paper was to study  the implementation of the 
eGovernment initiatives among the local authorities in 
Malaysia which are under the jurisdiction of the local 
governments by using the Web Presence Measurement Model. 
The findings showed that the City council came out top in 
terms of  achievement for the five Stages of  Web  Presence 
while the District council came out last  which means a good 
number of indicators are absent from the District council 
websites/portals The findings also showed that the local 
authorities operating in the State of Selangor were  much more 
advanced in term of representation for  their websites/portals 
compared to those found in the State of Sabah which is located 
at the bottom of the list.  Lessons from this study indicate that 
local authorities operating in constituencies with high income 
per capita such as Selangor are able to integrate more facilities 
in their websites.  However, social network facilities such as 
Facebook and Twitter are being provided by all the local 
authorities websites.   It is expected that the evaluation of the 
local authorities websites will provide a clear indication as to 
the extent of e-government implementation among local 
authorities in Malaysia.

INTRODUCTION  
 
The implementation of eGovernment in Malaysia witnesses 
the new beginning of reinventing the government by 
transforming the way it operates, modernises and improves 
its service delivery.  This initiative by the government is in 
reality a product of the efforts under the Multimedia Super 
Corridor (MSC). It is designed to improve information flow 
and processes within the government, improve the speed 
and 
quality 
of 
policy 
development, 
and 
improve 
coordination and enforcement. This would enable the 
government to be more responsive to the needs of its 
citizens [1] 
.   
 The MSC is a project created by the eGovernment to hasten 
the process of the nation to become first world status by the 
year 2020.  For this purpose the government has embarked 
in various initiatives and investments related to information 
and communication technology (ICT).  The MSC now 
known as MSC Malaysia was responsible for establishing 
the e-government flagship under its flagship applications 
programme. Under the e-Government flagship, seven main 
projects were identified to be the core of the e-government 
applications. The eGovernment projects are Project 
Monitoring System (PMS), Electronic Procurement (eP), 
Generic Office Environment (GOE), E-Syariah, Human 
Resource Management Information System (HRMIS 
Electronic Services Delivery (eServices)), and Electronic 
Labour Exchange (ELX).   
 
The commitment of the government towards investments in 
the ICT sector has been enhanced recently. During the 
tabling of the 10th Malaysia Plan (10MP)  2011-2015 in 
parliament in June 2010, the prime minister outlined several 
investments in ICT sector.   
 
The move by the Malaysian Government to enhance  the 
ICT sector has resulted in the improvement of Malaysia’s  
ranking in the eGovernment development index as reported 
in the United Nations E-Government  Survey 2012 “It is 
somewhat noteworthy that the emerging leaders group 
includes some developing countries that have begun to catch 
up with higher-income countries, such as Kazakhstan with 
eGovernment development  index at 0.6844 , Chile  with 
eGovernment  development index at 0.6769, and Malaysia 
with eGovernment development index at  0.6703.” [2]  
Therefore, it is important to find out  whether the 
improvement of Malaysia’s ranking on the eGoverment 
development index is effecting changes at the local 
government level. 
 
Several states announced ICT plans to complement the 
development of the MSC. For example, Selangor state 
government has set up the Selangor Networking and the Web 
homepage for its various agencies which would link the state

administration and all government departments and agencies 
with every business organisation, office, factory, school and 
home in the state. Johor state government announced the 
establishment of Johor Information Infrastructure (JII) 
costing RM30 million, the first state to set up such a system 
in order to provide the public with a more efficient 
information service.  The rate of development of the ICT 
sector at the state government level would directly or 
indirectly 
influence 
the 
state 
of 
 
eGovernment 
implementation at the local government level.  This is due to 
the fact that the local government authorities are under the 
jurisdiction of  the state governments. This situation arises 
from the Malaysian government structure of having a three-
tiered government administrative systems namely federal, 
state government and local authorities. 
 
 
Generally, the local authorities are under the jurisdiction of 
the state governments.  Three types of administrative 
councils are in existence. These are the City, Municipal, and 
District councils. A city council refers to a local authority in 
which the population of the jurisdiction area exceeds 
500,000 people and the collection of the annual revenue is 
more than RM100 million. City councils are led by mayors. 
A local authority is known as the municipal council if the 
population of the jurisdiction area  is not less than 150,000 
and the annual revenue collection is more than RM20m. A 
municipal council is led by a president. On the other hand, a 
local authority is known as a district council if the 
population of the jurisdiction area  is less than 150,000 and 
the collection of annual revenue is less than RM20m [3]. All 
these councils perform the same functions namely the 
provision of basic services which covers the maintenance of 
local community, including businesses as well as regulating 
land use and business activity within the administrative area.  
 
A mayor or president will be appointed to  head the local 
authorities. Currently the  total number of local authorities 
in Malaysia is 145. The  Malaysian local authorities ( MLA 
) consists of 12 City Councils, 38 Municipal Councils and 
95 District Councils. The executive powers lie with the 
mayors in city councils, and presidents in municipal and 
district councils. The state governments, elected every five 
years, appoint mayors, presidents and all councillors. These 
appointments are for a three-year renewable terms. The 
council decision-making process is through a committee 
structure determined by the local authority.  
 
The eGovernment applications would not have succeeded 
had it not been for the strong  support  of the government  in 
the information and communication technology (ICT) 
sectors. Governments of both developed and developing 
countries have embraced ICT to improve the quality of 
public  service, increase public access to information  and to 
energise more participation in civic affairs [4],[5]. The 
citizens also are accustomed to the developments of ICT 
through the high rate of utilization of Internet. In the case of 
Malaysia Internet usage has increased at a remarkable rate. 
In 2000 the number of subscribers was only about 2 million 
[6].  In 2007  the number of Internet subscribers have 
reached 13.52 million [7].  At the end of 2010 it is estimated 
that the Internet penetration rate will be at 16.9 million [8]. 
The Internet is an important element in eGovernment as the 
term itself is defined as” exclusively an Internet-driven 
activity that improves citizen access to government 
information services and expertise to ensure citizen 
participation in, and satisfaction with the government 
process”[9].  
 
One conduit of offering in the Internet services to the public 
and business clients is the creation of eGovernment websites 
or portals. The presence of  eGovernment websites, 
however, might not change the status quo as they could just 
be displaying information in an attractive manner and 
nothing more to the public. [10] opined that “ No longer can 
a website justify itself merely by being a website – the 
bottom line is apparently clear : web pages must reach 
concrete goals and prove their investment”. In order to 
understand whether the creation of the eGovernment 
websites has benefited the public or not then the question of 
how usable these websites are to the public has to be 
evaluated. The evaluation of eGovernment websites and 
portals can be done at several levels of the government 
machinery. Some scholars have accessed for features such 
as information availability, service delivery, and public 
access at global level at national level and at municipality 
level  [11]. 
 
The paper will cover the following components: purpose of 
study, methodology, data analysis and conclusion. 
 
                 II.    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY 
 
The aim of the study is to determine the maturity level of 
implementation of eGovernment applications at the Local 
Government levels based on the evaluation of the 
eGovernment websites or portals at local authorities level. 
This approach is taken in order to understand more clearly 
the actual situation on the ground. 
    
                          III.       METHODOLOGY 
 
A Model called Web Presence Measurement Model 
WPMM) was employed to evaluate the current status of 
those local authorithy websites or portals in Malaysia 
selected for the study. The Web Presence Measurement 
Model (WPMM) was introduced in the UN eGovernment 
Survey 2003 as an assessment towards United Nations 
member countries specifically for their capability in 
providing services electronically via the Internet. The 
WPMM shows 5 progressively ascending stages of presence 
that consists of Emerging Presence, Enhanced Presence, 
Interactive Presence, Transactional Presence and Networked 
8

Presence. WPMM quantification considers the development 
of maturity of E-Government presence on-line. Indicators 
are used to measure the presence or absence of specific 
electronic facilities or services available in the government 
agency websites or portals. The WPMM model is shown in 
Table 1 and some refinements or adjustments have been 
made to some indicators to ease the evaluation process.

computed on the basis of 1 unit score is given to the 
presence of a particular indicator. Based on this procedure 
the scoring weight for the five stages of presence is shown 
in Table 2.

IV.       DATA ANALYSIS 
 
The data for this study were obtained from an assessment of 
the Malaysian local authorities websites or portals in 2012. 
The assessment was based on the official local government 
websites or portals covering all the 14  states in Malaysia .  
The scoring process was based on whether the indicators as 
stipulated in the WPMM are present or absent. In the case 
where indicators are present they will be provided with an 
appropriate weighting as stipulated above.   
 
Table 3 shows the scores obtained from an assessment  of  
the City councils websites/portals in  Malaysia.  Not all 
states in Malaysia have their own City councils. Only 9 
states are represented with City councils. In cases where the 
City  council  operates  it  can be seen that all have passed  
Stage I : Emerging Presence,  while in Stage II : Enhanced 
Presence two City councils operating in the states of Sabah 
and  Sarawak  have 70% and 80 %  achievement  
respectively which means that  there are certain indicators in 
the Stage II that are absent. All the  City councils have 
passed Stage III : Interactive  Presence  while in Stage IV : 
Transactional  Presence  the City council of  Selangor has 
the highest achievement  of  100%.  However for the Stage 
V : Networked  Presence  all the City  councils achieved  a 
high score of 100%.  They have incorporated in their 
websites social network facilities such as Facebook, Twitter 
and blogs. Table 3 shows the data for the top three and 
bottom three of the City Councils. 
 
It is important to note that in a  study conducted  by [13] on 
the implementation of eGovernment  at  the  Federal, State 
and Local Government  levels in 2010 the performance of  
agencies under the local government in respect of  Stage V :

Networked Presence was very  poor and low  in percentages 
as they have not integrated  in their websites the social 
network facilities. As such we find nowadays the trend 
among the local authorities websites is to include Facebook  
and/or Twitter in their websites.

Table  4  shows the scores  obtained from an assessment  of  
the  Municipal council websites/portals  in  Malaysia  All 
states in Malaysia except for the Federal Territory have their 
own  Municipal councils.  These Municipal  councils 
usually operate in the main towns of the States.  As 
expected  their scope of operations  are much smaller  than 
the City councils and as such their achievements would be 
likely less than that of the  City councils.  As shown in 
Table

there 
are 
several 
Municipal 
councils  
websites/portals that  have not passed  Stage II  especially in 
the States of  Sabah and  Sarawak where they manage to 
achieve 60% and 80%  respectively. Table 4 shows the data 
for the top three  and bottom three of the Municipal  
Councils

In the case of  Stage IV, Table  4 shows that  not a single  
Municipal Councils websites/portals obtained  achievements 
of 100 %  which  means that  there are several indicators 
that are absent from their websites.      
 
For stage V, the Municipal  councils  websites/portals 
achievement are almost similar to that  of the City councils 
achievements at 100 %. They also used social network 
facilities to improve their standing. 
 
Table 5 shows that even at Stage I the District Councils 
websites/portals have not obtained  100 % achievement. The 
State  of Sarawak  has obtained  an achievement of only  80 
% while all the  Malaysian states that have City  Councils 
and Municipal Councils have an achievement of 100% 
which means that all the indicators  in Stage I are present in 
their websites. 
 
 
Table 5 also shows for Stage III the District councils 
websites/portals of the State of  Sabah and  Sarawak, 
obtained the lowest achievement of  80%.  In the case of  
Stage  IV  the achievement of the  District councils 
websites/portals  are relatively  lower than the City councils 
and Municipal  councils websites/portals and in the case of  
the  District  council  of Sarawak  websites they obtained  
merely  20 %  achievement  which means four  out of  the  
five  indicators are absent from the  websites.  In respect of 
Stage V  the number of indicators  present in the  District  
council websites/portals  are almost similar  to those 
exhibited by the City councils and Municipal councils  
.websites/portals except for the case of District Councils of 
Sabah and  Terengganu.

Based on the findings we can infer that the success story  in 
the case  of  Malaysia’s eGovernment implementation  for 
local authorities  is up to the level of  City  councils 
10

websites/portals.  It is also shown that  States with a high 
income capita such as Selangor are high achievers while 
poor States such as Sabah are low achievers. This sort of 
indicate that  local authorities  with money to spend can 
develop their websites/portals  to a  sophisticated  level of 
maturity while other less  fortunate States could only provide 
the barest  minimum for their websites/portals  as in the case 
of Sabah.  The Web Presence Measurement Model is a 
useful tool in identifying the presence or absence of certain 
indicators which are related to the measures of sophistication 
or maturity of the websites as exemplified in this study. 
Having identified the shortcomings the relevant authorities 
especially MAMPU, the agency responsible for enforcing 
eGovernment initiatives, should take steps to improve the 
situation of the public sector websites especially related to 
local authorities operating at State level.
