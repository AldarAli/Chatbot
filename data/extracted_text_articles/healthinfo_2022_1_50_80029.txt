Abstract—The increased number of daily Covid-19 infections 
in several countries around the world has proven to be a public 
health 
concern. 
To 
verify 
the 
association 
between 
comorbidities, hospitalizations, deaths, recoveries, symptoms, 
age and gender, this article investigates related studies in the 
databases "Medrxiv", "Google Scholar" and "Science 
Direct", with the following search terms "Covid-19 ", 
"Models", "Comorbidities", "Infection", "Hospitalization" 
and "Recovered". Thus, it was possible to verify that the most 
verified comorbidity is cardiovascular disease and that 
comorbidities together with Covid-19 infection are the main 
cause of hospitalization worldwide, prolonging the infection 
status that can lead to death. The analysis of the results 
allowed showing the indicators and trends, as well as the 
relationship between the variables that can assist in future 
decision making.

INTRODUCTION 
Covid-19, also known coronavirus, emerged in 
December 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan. According to  
[1], everything indicates that the epicentre of the virus 
happened in a Wild Animal Market where there are birds, 
snakes, bats, and other animals. Coronavirus is a virus that 
causes respiratory infections in humans and animals whose 
name Covid-19 was reported by the "World Health 
Organization" (WHO) [2] and is the result of the fusion of 
the words "corona" and "virus", with the year it emerged, 
2019 [3]. After exposure to the virus, infected humans begin 
to have the first symptoms in the first 2 to 14 days. The 
symptoms include dry and persistent cough, fever above 
38ºC, excessive tiredness, generalized muscle pain, 
headache, sore throat, runny nose, or stuffy nose, diarrhea, 
loss of taste and smell [4]. There were also infected 
individuals who did not reveal symptoms, being 
asymptomatic. So far, the only way to know the presence of 
Covid-19 is by testing. Currently, there are 4 types of tests: 
molecular Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (TAAN), also 
called Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Rapid Antigen 
Tests (TRAg), Self-Testing and Serological Tests [5]. The 
most reliable and required by the authorities to travel are 
mainly PCR tests. 
The first 14 days in which the human being was exposed 
to the virus are the days when contagion is greatest, isolation 
being therefore mandatory, since it is at this stage that the 
chains of contagion are created. After 14 days, the virus 
ceases to be transmitted and the human in question can end 
the isolation [6]. 
To prevent the spread of the virus, the National Health 
System (SNS) recommends specific prevention measures 
such as social distancing, the use of masks, frequent hand 
washing, disinfection, cleaning, and disinfection of spaces 
and recommends citizens to be aware of symptoms [7]. As 
there is still no direct treatment for Covid-19, the infected 
are medicated according to the symptoms presented with 
existing medications to reduce the fever and difficulty 
breathing. However, comorbidities may influence the 
severity of symptoms and infection [8]. Over months, it has 
also been verified that people with comorbidities are more 
prone to contracting the virus. This fact is reflected in regular 
hospitalizations and in intensive care units, where the 
number of deaths in these circumstances has increased. 
Thus, a systematic study was carried out to identify 
associations between people infected with Covid-19 in ages, 
gender, symptoms, hospitalization, recoveries, and deaths, 
focusing on the associated comorbidities. This study 
corresponds to the first part of a more wide-ranging project 
to identify, in future work, the respective correlations and 
specific values for the measures/tests. 
This article is divided into four sections. In Section I, we 
explain the methodology used and the article selection 
process. Section II contains the analysis of results and 
Section III the discussion of the results. Finally, in Section 
IV, the conclusions and further work are presented.

METHODOLOGY 
Based on the PRISMA systematic review methodology 
[9] this article investigates related studies in the “Medrxiv”, 
“Google Scholar” and “Science Direct” databases with the 
following 
search 
terms 
"Covid-19", 
"Models", 
"Comorbidities ", "Infection", "Inpatient" and "Recovered".  
Three reviewers independently assessed each study. The 
compliance was determined unanimously by all parties 
involved. The aim of this study was to verify the different 
methods of data analysis and models applied to the study and 
evolution of the mentioned terms. The search for articles was 
carried out between February and May 2021. 
A. Research questions 
The main research questions about this review were:  
 
(Q1) 
Association 
between 
comorbidities 
and 
hospitalizations/deaths.  
(Q2)      Association between comorbidities and recoveries. 
(Q3)        Association between symptoms and hospitalization. 
(Q4)      Association between age, death, and gender.

• Studies that aim to analyze pandemic data in various 
vacancies and in multiple countries of the world.  
• Studies using machine learning and data processing to 
make predictions of the evolution of the pandemic.  
• Studies that relate the numbers of Covid-19 infected 
people with hospitalizations and deaths.  
• Studies that relate the numbers of Covid-19 infected 
people with comorbidities and recovered. 
• Studies published between 2019 and 2021.  
 
After the search using the referred terms, 263 articles 
were found, of which 42 were considered by application of 
the inclusion criteria. Figure 1 illustrates the resulting 
flowchart of feature extraction. During the study selection 
process, 11 repeated articles and 2 studies that were not in 
article format were initially removed. Then, 10 articles were 
removed because they did not fit the Covid-19 theme and 
finally 199 articles because they did not fit the research 
objective, although they addressed the Covid-19 theme. Of 
these 199 articles, 6 addressed climatic conditions and 
Covid-19, 2 the presence of Covid-19 in migrants, 141 study 
of the behaviour of other specific diseases in the presence of 
covid-19, 12 transmissibility factors, 23 socioeconomic 
factors and 15 hospital logistics. The remaining 42 studies 
were presented in the qualitative and quantitative synthesis. 
Data were extracted from all identified studies using a 
predefined format. Data extracted included: Study;

DISCUSSION / RESULTS ANALYSIS 
This work shows how the collection of daily data of 
people infected by Covid-19 is important, because it allows 
contributing to the knowledge and evolution of the pandemic 
and to understand how the new virus acts and propagates. 
The research of the articles was conducted between 
February and May of 2021 in the databases "Medrxiv", 
"Google Scholar" and "Science Direct" and of which 
resulted 42 articles, 27 addressed data analysis, 7 article 
research, 5 " Machine Learning", 2 CFR Method and 1 
Mathematical Model "Data-Driven MFTG", as illustrated in 
the graph in Figure 2. 
Throughout the study, several data collection dates were 
verified, but still the data from the first wave were the ones 
that prevailed in most articles, even though some did not 
read this same information, as illustrated in the graph in 
Figure 3. In the articles studied, some methods of data 
analysis and tools were used, such as “Machine Learning” 
methods or a simple spreadsheet for statistical analysis. With 
these methods and tools, it is possible to draw several 
conclusions. 
 
(Q1) 
Association 
between 
Comorbidities 
and 
Hospitalizations/Deaths: Comorbidities in conjunction with 
Covid-19 infection have been shown to be the leading cause 
of hospitalization, both in wards and in ICU’s [10][40].  
These hospitalizations by Covid-19, where comorbidities 
are present were not only in Portugal [11], but in several 
countries of the world as referenced in [20]. As for the most 
frequently verified comorbidities, cardiovascular diseases 
[34][37][49] diabetes, hypertension, respiratory diseases, 
among others. Figure 4 shows comorbidities most frequently 
reported in the studies analyzed. It is [14] also evidenced that 
pre-existing diseases prolong the state of Covid-19 infection 
and that it can lead to death mainly in the older population. 
Age together with comorbidities showed an increase in the 
number of hospitalizations and the risk of death as reported 
in [25] where the most affected ages were between 80 and 
89 years of age [12]. Similarly, in [29], it is reported that age 
was the main risk factor and that the virus mainly affected 
the elderly population, reinforced by [33], however [23] 
reported that the median of the ages of the infected varied 
between 28 and 70 years. 
 
(Q2) Association between Comorbidities and Recoveries: 
Recovery time was also shown to be influenced by 
comorbidities, because the more severe the comorbidity, the 
longer the recovery time [22]. Also, the data analysis [48] 
showed that the mean follow-up time of a patient infected by 
Covid-19 was 27 days and that the median age was 50 years, 
with the male gender being the most affected. However, 
many studies have not been found, which at this stage, 
addressed those recovered and their post-infection health 
status. 
 
(Q3) 
Association 
between 
symptoms 
and 
hospitalization: Many Covid-19 infected patients were 
considered asymptomatic due to the absence of symptoms, 
however, many of the symptomatic patients had to be 
hospitalized due to their severity. In [15], it was found that 
the diagnosis rate of Covid-19 was directly linked to the 
presence of symptoms and consequent hospitalization in the 
most severe cases, thus increasing the risk of mortality. 
Applications of data analysis and creation of illustrative 
graphs were also developed to assist in the treatment of 
Covid-19. The 'Covid-19 trajectory viewer' [22] generates 
graphs with data of recovered and dead as well as of the 
spread of the epidemic in the population through 
hospitalized versus not hospitalized, symptomatic versus 
asymptomatic, highly exposed versus less exposed 
professions.

(Q4) Association between age, death, and gender: As 
mentioned in Q1, the age and gender of the infected may 
vary considerably, but in [19], the authors found that men 
were more susceptible to death than women. Also in [26] 
[31] and [36], it is shown that patients over 60 and 70 years 
of age had a higher risk of contracting Covid-19, which was 
even higher  than any comorbidity. The genus masculine was 
the one with the highest rate of infection referred to in [35] 
[39] [43]. In [41], it was found that individuals aged 80 years 
or older were responsible for most deaths in Europe. As for 
patients between 30 and 39 years of age, they had some 
immunity or resistance to the disease. In [34] and [51], it was 
found that patients with cardiac complications associated 
with SARS-CoV-2 were, on average, 10 years older than 
those who did not. The graph in Figure 5 was presented in 
[10] and is similar to the conclusions presented  in [13], 
clearly showing that death from Covid-19 occurs in the older 
age groups and that in the younger age groups the number of 
deaths is practically nil.

IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
In December 2019, little was known about the virus 
called Covid-19 by the WHO, nor how to combat it. To 
avoid the rapid contagion seen in China, many countries 
have chosen to implement mandatory containment 
measures, mandatory use of masks on public roads and 
social distancing measures that later proved to have a major 
impact on transmission chains [16]. The way the virus 
operated by different infected patients was also a major 
object of study [18] [21], where not all infected had 
symptoms and others were so severely attacked that they had 
to be admitted to intensive care units and breath with the help 
of ventilators. As for symptoms, they varied from patient to 
patient depending on both the presence and the type of 
comorbidities. However, the comorbidity that stood out was 
cardiovascular disease followed by diabetes, hypertension, 
respiratory diseases, cancer, kidney diseases, asthma, 
obesity, immunosuppressive diseases, liver diseases, HIV, 
neuromuscular and cerebrovascular diseases, advanced age 
and 
other 
unspecified 
or 
unreported 
[34][37][49]. 
Comorbidities in conjunction with Covid-19 infection have 
also been found to be the leading cause of hospitalization 
worldwide [11] [20], prolonging the state of the infection 
that can lead to death. Recovery time was also shown to be 
influenced by comorbidities, where the more severe the 
comorbidity, the longer the recovery time [22], compared to 
the mean time of infection and recovery of 27 days 
[15][22][48]. Age, together with comorbidities, increased 
the number of hospitalizations and the risk of death, where 
the most affected ages were between 70 and 89 years [12] 
[25]. Still, in addition to comorbidities, the age group 
between 60 and 70 years of age also has a very high risk of 
contracting covid-19 infection [26] [31]. The number of 
deaths is strongly observed in males [19] and occurs in the 
older age groups [13]. In the younger age groups, the mean 
age of the infected varied between 28 and 70 years [41] and 
the number of associated deaths is very close to zero. Covid-
19 has been shown to be present in virtually all age groups, 
but it is in the population over 60 years of age that infections 
are more severe. This population over 60 years of age 
revealed a higher presence of comorbidities, mainly cardiac 
and respiratory, which hinders recovery and, consequently, 
can lead to death.  
In future work, in the next phase of this study, the 
available data sets will be combined with the statistical 
measures to quantify the respective values/metrics of 
correlations between the identified associations.
