Abstract—Person re-identification in crowded scenes is very 
important. Most images come from different surveillance video 
and cameras, and one person may look different in a variety of 
scenes, viewpoints, lighting and so on. The existing methods 
have limited effects in practical applications. In this paper, we 
propose a convolutional neural network for person re-
identification in crowded scenes. The model structure of this 
network combines pedestrian detection and re-identification. 
In addition, we propose a loss function to better match the 
target person by calculating Pearson correlation evaluation. 
The experimental results show that our method is effective.

 INTRODUCTION 
Person re-identification means to match the target person 
in different images. These images come from different 
cameras, so the challenges lie in the different backgrounds, 
the changes of human postures, camera viewpoints, lighting, 
occlusions and so on. Person re-identification can be applied 
to surveillance video, such as cross-camera searching and 
tracking of criminals [1], which is very helpful for public 
safety. Therefore, person re-identification draws the attention 
of scholars and a lot of researches have been done in recent 
years [3][7-10][12]. 
Person re-identification consists of two steps: pedestrian 
detection and re-identification. Many researches have been 
done in the field of pedestrian detection. Dalal et al. [4] 
proposed Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) feature for 
human detection. It can describe the edge features of human 
body. Zhu et al. [5] extracted Multi-scale Intrinsic Motion 
Structure features for pedestrian detection. These methods 
use hand-crafted features and linear classifiers to detect 
persons. Hand-crafted features may lose some important 
information of the original images, and the classification 
results are not good enough. In recent years, Deep Learning 
has attracted much attention in the fields of image, audio, 
natural language processing and so on. Yang et al. [6] 
proposed Convolutional Channel Features which achieved 
good performances in pedestrian detection. Zhang et al. [2] 
used Region Proposal Network (RPN) followed by boosted 
forests on high-resolution convolutional feature maps. As for 
person re-identification, the common method is part 
matching. Zhao et al. [7] adopted patch matching and 
estimated patch salience. Zheng et al. [10] proposed a 
PoseBox structure, which pose is estimated by affine 
transformations. However, these methods may introduce 
errors in part detection. Yi et al. [8] and Varior et al. [9] used 
the siamese convolutional neural network for person re-
identification. Most of the existing person re-identification 
methods assume perfect pedestrian detections. In fact, these 
hand-cropped bounding boxes are unavailable in the 
applications of realistic scenes. Xiao et al. [3] proposed an 
end-to-end framework for person re-identification. Also, 
Yamaguchi et al. [13] used a natural language query to 
handle this task. But these methods are still difficult to 
satisfy complex realistic scenes. In these methods, the scenes 
are simple and contain only 1 to 5 people. The effect is not 
good in the scenes with many people. 
In order to deal with person re-identification in crowded 
scenes, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) 
which combines pedestrian detection and re-identification. It 
can learn more effective deep features due to CNN with 
deeper network layers. In addition, we propose a loss 
function to better match the target person. The similarity of 
the target person and persons in crowded scene images is 
calculated by Pearson correlation evaluation. Finally, with 
fine-tuning on the weights initialization, experimental results 
on Large Scale Person Search dataset (PSDB) [3] show that 
the proposed method gains new state-of-the-art performances. 
II. 
PERSON RE-IDENTIFICATION IN CROWDED SCENES 
Our work consists of two parts: deep learning network 
model and matching loss function for person re-identification. 
In the detection phase, we construct residual network units 
(ResNet) [11] and RPN [14]. In order to converge better and 
faster, we fine-tune the network via Xavier [16] filler instead 
of Gaussian filler. And in the re-identification phase, we 
construct aggregated residual network units (ResNeXt) [15] 
to extract the deep features of detected persons. After that, 
we propose a loss function to match the target person by 
calculating the similarity between the target person features 
and detected person features.  
A. Model Structure for Person Re-identification 
The model structure for person re-identification in 
crowded scenes is shown in Fig. 1. We construct ResNet-50 
[11] as our base CNN model to extract image features. The 
kernel size is 7 in the first convolutional layer with 64 
channels. We perform Batch Normalization (BN) layer after 
convolutional layers and Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) 
layer is performed after each BN layer. After the layer, there 
are three blocks. In the first block, there are three residual

units which include three convolutional layers with 1, 3, and 
1 of kernel size respectively. In the second block, there are 
four residual units. In the third block, there are three residual 
units. These convolutional layers are different in channels. 
The residual units can produce convolutional feature maps 
with 1024 channels. 
Next, we need to get the person bounding boxes. An 
RPN [17] with a Softmax classifier is added to get 9 anchors 
and predict whether each bounding box is a person or not. It 
selects the top 128 bounding boxes as final proposals of 
persons in the image. 
The weights initialization method of the RPN is Gaussian 
filler. Weights are randomly drawn from Gaussian 
distributions with fixed mean (e.g., 0) and fixed standard 
deviation (e.g., 0.01). This is the most common initialization 
method in deep learning. To make the information in the 
network flow better, the variance of each layer's output 
should be equal. Xavier [16] filler makes weights a uniform 
distribution with the mean of 0 and the variance of Var, as 
follows 
𝑉𝑎𝑟 =
𝑁
𝑛𝑖+𝑛𝑖+1 ,  
(1) 
where ni is the i-th input number, and ni+1 is the i+1-th input 
number, as well as the i-th output number. By default, the 
variance takes into account only the number of inputs (ni+1 = 
0, N = 1). But the number of inputs and outputs is often 
unequal, and the variance takes into account only the number 
of outputs (ni = 0, N = 1). For balanced consideration, N = 2. 
In our network, Xavier filler is adopted to make the effect 
better. 
Then, the task is to match the target person in these 
proposals. An RoI-Pooling layer is added for each proposal. 
And this layer links two blocks of ResNeXt-50(32×4d) [15]. 
In the first block, there are three aggregated residual units, 
which 
the 
second 
convolutional 
layer 
is 
grouped 
convolutions with 32 groups. In the second block, there are 
three aggregated residual units which are different from units 
of the first block in kernel output channels. Finally, we add 
the matching layer to calculate the similarity of these 
features with the target person by our proposed loss function. 
B. Matching Loss Function for Person Re-identification 
To match the target person in an image, we store the 
features of all people in this image, and calculate the 
similarity of these features with the target person. If one 
similarity is the largest, then the corresponding person is 
likely to be the target. In the labeled boxes, the features of 
the target person box is denoted as x, where x∈RD and D is 
the feature dimension, that is, x is a feature vector of D 
dimensions. The feature of one person box in the image is 
denoted as yl, where yl∈RD and D is the feature dimension. 
During the forward propagation, we compute the Pearson 
correlation coefficient Cl
j between the target features and the 
box features with the j-th class (j∈ [1, L] and L is the 
number of the boxes), as follows

where x and yl are the mean values of x and yl. During the 
backward propagation, we update yl
j by  
𝑦𝑗
𝑙 ← 𝛾𝑦𝑗
𝑙 + (1 − 𝛾)𝑥 ,  
(3) 
where  ∈ [0, 1]. Similarly, in the unlabeled boxes, the 
feature of one person box in the image is denoted as yu, 
where yu ∈ RD and D is the feature dimension. The Pearson 
correlation coefficient Cu
j between the target features and the 
box features with the j-th class (j∈ [1, U] and U is the 
number of the boxes), as follows

So, the probability of the feature vector x as the i-th class 
labeled person is

where τ makes softer probability distribution. In the same 
way, the probability of the feature vector x as the i-th class 
unlabeled person is 
𝑝𝑖
𝑢 =
𝑒(𝐶𝑖
𝑢 𝜏

∑
𝑒

In summary, the Pearson correlation matching loss 
function is defined as follows: 
L = E(log𝑝𝑡
𝑙) ,  
(8) 
where t ∈ [1, L]. The Pearson correlation coefficient is the 
cosine similarity with subtracting average. It is more 
applicable to data using different evaluation criteria. Then, 
the loss effectively compares the features of the target person 
with all the features of the boxes and finds the person whose 
feature vector is the most similar with the target one from the 
crowded scene images.  
III. 
EXPERIMENTS 
A. Dataset 
 We use PSDB [3], a large-scale dataset for person re-
identification which covering hundreds of scenes. There are 
18,184 images, 8,432 identities, and 96,143 pedestrian 
bounding boxes in this dataset. The training set contains 
11,206 images and 5,532 query persons. The test set contains 
6,978 images and 2,900 query persons.  
B. Experimental Results 
For comparisons, we use some feature representations 
and the state-of-art method (Online Instance Matching, OIM) 
[3] for person re-identification on PSDB. The results are 
summarized in Table 1. Dense scale-invariant feature 
transform (DSIFT) [17] method is based on unsupervised 
salience learning. Euclidean distance metric and KISSME 
(keep it simple and straightforward metric) [19] distance 
metric are used for DSIFT. And Cross-view Quadratic 
Discriminant Analysis (XQDA) distance metric is used for 
Local Maximal Occurrence (LOMO) [18]. We use two kinds 
of evaluation metrics: cumulative matching characteristics 
(CMC top-K) and mean averaged precision (mAP). CMC 
top-K is the probability that the result hits within K times. 
And mAP is obtained by the average for precision results of 
each class of people.  
The results are summarized in Table 1. Our method 
outperforms the others. On the one hand, the detector is also 
important for person re-identification. Most existing methods 
focus only on cropped images, so they may not be suitable 
for re-identification in the crowded scene images. On the 
other hand, different distance metric methods also have an 
impact on the experimental results.  
In 
addition, 
we 
compare 
the different 
weights 
initialization methods with OIM [3]. As shown in Table 2, 
Xavier filler is superior to Gaussian filler in most cases. 
These results are relevant to specific network models and 
tasks.  
The samples of our method in the experiment are shown 
in Fig. 2. The inputs are an image of the target person and 
some images with people. The outputs are the result images 
of bounding boxes with re-identification similarities. The 
person with maximum similarity is the target. Both in non-

the target person with the largest similarity. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework for 
end-to-end person re-identification. We adopt one CNN to 
link the two tasks of pedestrian detection and person re-
identification. And ResNeXt residual units are constructed in 
the model to extract features more effectively. We also 
propose a Pearson Correlation Matching loss function to 
match the target person. Compared with existing methods, 
the performance of our method is improved with fine-tuning 
through experiments on PSDB dataset.  
In the future, we plan to study person re-identification for 
surveillance video. The application of video is necessary for 
industry and society. On the one hand, many images make 
up video frame sequences. That is, the methods of images 
can be extended to video. On the other hand, there are new 
and available features due to the continuity of video frames. 
We will also combine person re-identification with Natural 
Language Processing to achieve a wider range of 
applications in the future.
