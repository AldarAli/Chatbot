Abstract— An efficient wireless design and development is 
essential to ensure a good performance of the WLANs. It 
supposes a good estimation of the number of APs, their 
locations according to the structure of the building, a good 
channel distribution and an adequate level of transmission 
power in order to avoid overlapping but providing the largest 
coverage. Otherwise, a WLAN may be composed by more 
access points, so it may be more expensive, but with a worse 
function due to the radio overlapping among APs in the same 
channel. In this paper, we show how a WLAN can be 
redesigned in order to improve its wireless coverage and 
function. It is based on studying the distribution and features 
of a public building in a Spanish University in order to 
determine the optimum access point location and to assign the 
appropriated channel. In this case, this WLAN allows users to 
connect to one of the available SSIDs in the target building. 
Results obtained from the proposed redesign have been very 
successful from the point of view of performance and coverage.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
One of the most important aspects in the development 
and implementation of wireless networks is to ensure the 
optimal access to all network resources. Nowadays, 
ubiquitous connection to the network services is essential to 
let the workers and students perform their tasks. Wireless 
networks are widespread in both the enterprise and academia 
environments, providing support for wired networks and 
mobility to users. Wireless networks allow them to access all 
the services offered by the institution even when they are 
moving. Users can access to all resources in the 
infrastructure. 
It is very important to know the behavior of signals 
within a building. An analytical analysis of the signals 
generated by the access points (APs) can help us to improve 
network coverage within the building [1]. In this new paper, 
we enhance our analytical study in order to propose a 
redesign of the wireless network of the Centre of resources 
for the research and learning (CRAI) of the Higher 
Polytechnic School of Gandia, a campus of the ”Universitat 
Politecnica de Valencia” (UPV) in Spain. We propose a new 
distribution of the locations of APs with a new channel 
scheme. Moreover, we have included a study of wireless 
coverage in order to compare both values. In this 
comparison, we show that wireless signals in indoor 
environments have a different behavior, which could be used 
for other purposes. 
One of the most important things which must be 
considered when a wireless network is being designed is the 
wireless signal losses. They depends on the number of walls 
and obstacles crossed in its propagation path, the materials 
used in the building construction, the type of obstacles, the 
multipath effect, and others electromagnetic  waves from 
others systems which interference with the wireless signal.  
But, generally, only the fixed obstacles and walls are taken 
into account in the design process. There are several 
materials such as metal or wood very used in buildings or 
simply through normal walls and floors, which affect to 
wireless signals reducing significantly their signal level [1, 
2]. In contrast, interferences caused by electromagnetic 
waves from other systems can be reduced selecting the most 
appropriate frequency band for the wireless network and a 
good channel assignment 
When a wireless network is designed in a specific 
environment, it is necessary to study the distribution of the 
place in order to determine the better location for each AP 
and the channel distribution. The goal is to provide the 
greatest possible coverage but avoiding overlapping among 
channels according to the building distribution. Obviously, it 
is impossible to define only one model for all places and, 
sometimes, it is very difficult and tedious to analyze each 
place in detail before installing, because each one has a 
different distribution and with different sources of 
interferences. So, although it is quite easy to estimate the 
area of the radio coverage in a free space, it is very difficult 
to calculate it in indoors since the building distributions are 
not uniform [3]. Moreover, the irregular disposal of the 
objects makes the ray tracing, which mainly affects to the 
multipath loses, very difficult to be controlled. However, 
there are several features of the indoor environments which 
should be taken into account in order to reach a well-
designed WLAN.  
Moreover, an accurate design means a good sized 
network, that is, only APs/routers needed to cover the service 
area and to obtain high efficiency must be bought.  
Moreover, performing a correct and optimal design of an 
indoor wireless networks would subsequently let the network 
administrators include multiple services such as positioning 
and tracking of people and objects [4]. So, the coverage 
study showed in this paper is applicable to other research 
fields such as wireless sensor networks [5] where the 
designing process presents similar inconvenient. 
In addition to all the design parameters discussed above, 
it is essential to analyze and study which type of traffic and 
users the target WLAN goes to support, and how much and 
how many respectively. Depending on that, it will require 
more or less resources, bandwidth and performance. Finally, 
the physical distribution must be considered in order to select 
the APs locations since each AP needs a power supply and a 
point of connection to the wired network.

In short, the key issues to design and install a WLAN are 
to study the physical aspects of the area where the WLAN 
goes to be installed, to select the type of APs which fulfill 
the necessary requirements according to the users and traffic 
estimated, to perform a coverage study to assign the most 
appropriated location for each AP taking into account the 
physical features of the building (where obstacles, power 
supplies and points of connection to the wired network are 
located), and to do a good channel distribution to minimize 
interferences among APs. 
In this paper, we use the analytical study of the building 
in order to know the wireless signal behavior in the CRAI 
building. These measures will allow us to develop new 
techniques for indoor network designs. In order to validate 
our measures, we will perform a new analysis within another 
scenario and compare the results between them. We will 
show the wireless network redesigned and how the new APs 
placement provides better wireless coverage. 
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 
shows some related works with radio coverage and redesign 
of wireless networks. Section 3 presents the scenario and the 
tools used to perform our measurements. Section 4 explains 
the results of our study drawn in coverage maps. Section 5 
makes a comparative study of the three analyzed radio 
signals in each floor. The analytical study is included in 
Section 6. Section 7 shows the redesign of the CRAI wireless 
network from the obtained measurements. This consists on 
relocating the wireless devices and reassigning channels 
according to the new distribution of devices. In order to 
check our proposal, we perform another analytical study in 
another building and show the comparison between the 
results in Section 8. Finally, Section 9 summarizes the 
conclusion and future works. 
II. 
RELATED WORKS 
Different aspects of the WLANs’ coverage have been 
studied in several papers. There are both empirical [7] and 
analytical [8] studies. On the one hand, A.R. Sandeep et al. 
[7] suggest an indoor empirical propagation model (IEPM) 
in order to predict the signal strength of an indoor Wi-Fi 
network. It is a predictive model based on the Wall Effect 
Factor (Wef) and the Wall Attenuation Factor (Waf). From 
this model, authors can calculate the RF coverage area before 
installing a WLAN and so that calculating the number of 
access points needed. Therefore, this model means low cost 
and development time. On the other hand, Eisenbl et al. [8] 
perform an analytical study about the best location for APs 
and channel assignment in order to improve the performance 
of a WLAN. Up to now, these features have been analyzed 
independently, but according to this paper the greatest 
optimization is achieved from studying these two features 
simultaneously by mathematical programming. Authors 
propose an integrated model in order to reach a balance 
between both features and to optimize the indoor design of 
WLANs. 
Expanding analyzing studies, M. Kamenetskyt et al. [9] 
analyze different methods for obtaining the most optimum 
location for the WLAN’s access points. In order to evaluate 
the performance of these methods, they use an objective 
function which maximizes the coverage area and signal 
quality. Then different approaches to coverage planning for 
WLAN systems are reviewed and the most suitable for 
numerical evaluation are selected. From this evaluation, 
authors propose a new optimization scheme based on the 
combination of two approaches: using pruning in order to set 
initial locations for access points and refining these by using 
either neighborhood search or simulated annealing.  
Then, E. Amaldi et al. [10] present a new modeling 
approach taking into account the effect of the IEEE802.11 
access mechanism. It influences on radio coverage due to the 
coverage overlap between APs and its impact on the system 
capacity. So, they explain and discuss novel mathematical 
programming models based on quadratic and hyperbolic 
objective functions considering this. Finally, some initial 
results on synthetic instances are shown.  
Some abovementioned authors improve its initial 
approach (published in [10]) because it is difficult to tackle 
even for small instances. So, they propose and analyze 
effective heuristics in [11] to tackle hyperbolic and quadratic 
formulations in order to maximize the overall network 
capacity. It is based on a combined greedy and local search 
algorithms turn out to provide near-optimal solutions in a 
reasonable amount of time.  
Following with empirical papers, Kaemarungsi and 
Krishnamurthy [4] study the performance of the received 
signal strength (RSS) from IEEE 802.11b wireless network 
interface cards in order to improve the indoor location 
systems based on location fingerprints. Moreover, they point 
out the influence of the users’ presence on the RSS, both the 
proximity of the human body to antenna and its orientation. 
These features affect the mean value and the spread of the 
average RSS values. So, if the position system is deployed in 
an environment with people, it is essential to take it into 
consideration while collecting RSS values for the fingerprint. 
In contrast, for applications that make use of sensors without 
human presence, this influence shouldn’t be considered.  
J. Lloret et al. [12, 13] show studies about an empirical 
coverage radio model for indoor wireless LAN design. This 
model has been tested on a vast number of buildings of a 
great extension area with over 400 wireless APs in order to 
get quick successful results. The objective of the model is to 
facilitate the design of a wireless local area network WLAN 
using simple calculations, because the use of statistical 
methods takes too much time and it is difficult to implement 
in most situations. The proposed analytical model is based 
on a derivation of the field equation of free propagation, and 
takes into account the structure of the building and its 
materials. 
Sendra et al. [14] present a comparison of the IEEE 
802.11a/b/g/n variants in indoor environments in order to 
know which the best technology is. This comparison is made 
in terms of the RSS indicator, the coverage area and the 
measurements of interferences between channels. This study 
only provides data from a building. So, it is difficult to 
extract a generalization in the wireless signals behavior. 
In [15], authors propose a new WLAN design strategy 
called capacity based WLAN design. The method guarantee 
radio coverage to the target service area and provide a

specified data rate capacity to carry the traffic demand from 
each user in the service area. The methodology proposed 
determines the number of APs, frequency channels, power 
level and the placement of the APs that ensure the constraints 
as data rate density requirements, radio propagation 
conditions and physical limitations, related with receiver 
sensitivity. Authors performed several design experiments, 
which show the benefits of their method over the traditional 
coverage – based design. 
Moreover, I. Broustis et al [16], suggest that when we 
perform large wireless sensor network deployments, it is 
possible to detect large amount of interference, because their 
small capacities. They tell us that to improve the overall 
capacity of the network; we can base our proposals in the 
intelligent frequency allocation across APs, in the load 
balancing of user affiliations across APs and in an adaptive 
power control for each AP. In their work, they search 
interdependencies between the three functions in order to 
understand when and how to apply them to the network 
design. The authors performed the measures following a 
study based on the quantification of the effects of three 
optimization schemes proposed in many different scenarios. 
From the results, we can see that applying simultaneously 
the three optimization schemes is not always preferable, 
because it can sometimes degrade the performance by up to 
24% compared to using only two of the schemes.  
III. 
SCENARIO DESCRIPTION AND USED TOOLS  
The CRAI building was built in 2007. It belongs to the 
Higher Polytechnic School of Gandia. It is composed of 3 
floors where different services for the students are offered. It 
contains the library, computer labs and open access 
classrooms. Figure 1 shows the map of this space. It is the H 
building of this university campus. 
Now we are going to describe the scenario where the 
measurements have been taken from the wireless networks 
and the type of hardware and software used to perform our 
research. 
A. The building  
The ground floor (see Fig. 2) contains an information 
desk, several staff offices, a library and a large study room 
with a consultation area and several group study rooms. 
Finally, there is a multipurpose room where events and 
exhibitions are sometimes held. 
On the first floor (see Fig. 3) we can find several 
computer labs, some classrooms to perform Final Degree 
Projects, and others group and individual study rooms. 
On second floor (see Fig. 4), there are a large library with 
magazines, journals, books and audiovisual resources, and 
some computer labs and professor offices. 
B. Description of UPV Wireless Network 
Higher Polytechnic School of Gandia is a campus of the 
UPV and shares four wireless networks with the main 
campus, their SSIDs are EDUROAM, UPVNET2G, 
UPVNET and UPV-INFO. Each one of these allows 
university users to access to the Internet and the university 
resources. Their main features are: 
 
UPVNET: a wireless network with direct connection to 
all the resources of the UPV. It requires a wireless card 
with configured with WPA/WPA2 security. 
 
UPVNET2G: a direct network connection to all 
resources of the UPV and the Internet. It requires a 
wireless card configured with WPA/WPA2 security. 
 
EDUROAM: this wireless network is widely deployed 
in universities and research centers in Europe. It 
provides Internet access for all their members. Users 
only need a username and a password from their home 
institution. It requires a wireless card configured with 
WPA/WPA2 security. This network only provides 
Internet access. 
 
UPV-INFO: this wireless network works as a 
consultation area. It only provides all information about 
how the wireless network cards must be configured in 
the users’ devices in order to connect them to some of 
the abovementioned networks. It uses private IP 
addressing and it does not allow users to access to the 
Internet. A second connection is needed to access to the 
Internet and the UPV resources. This second connection 
can be a Virtual Private Networking (VPN). It should 
only be used by very old computers that do not support 
WPA encryption. 
In this paper we are going to analyze three of these 
networks (UPVNET, UPVNET2G, EDUROAM), because 
these are the only ones that allow users to access to the 
Internet.

C. Software and hardware used 
In order to carry out this work, several measurements 
have been done along the three floors of the CRAI. We have 
used 
different 
network 
devices 
to 
perform 
these 
measurements: 
 
Linksys WUSB600N [17]: it is a USB wireless device 
used to gather measurements. It can capture signals from 
the IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n 
standards. Its power 
transmission is 16 dBm for all standards and the receiver 
sensitivity is about -91dBm in both internal antennas. 
Transmission power consumption is less than 480mA 
and it consumes 300mA in the reception mode.  
 
Laptop: it was used to take coverage measurements. It 
has a dual core processor with 2 GHz per core and 2 
Gbyte of RAM Memory. Its operating system is 
Windows Vista. 
 
Cisco Aironet 1130AG (AIR-AP1131AG-E-K9) [18]: 
this AP is the model used in all floors of the building. Its 
data rate can reach up to 54 Mbps. It can work at 2.4 
GHz or 5 GHz, with a maximum distance from 100m to 
122m in indoors (as a function of the IEEE 802.11a or 
IEEE 802.11g variant). The maximum distance for 
outdoor environments is about 198 m and 274 m. It can 
be powered by PoE (Power over Ethernet). 
In order to capture the received signal from each selected 
point of the building, we used the following program: 
 
InSSIDer [19]: it is a free software tool which detects 
and controls the wireless networks and the signal 
strength by a graphical way. This program lists all 
detected wireless networks and provides several details 
about them such as their SSIDs, MAC addresses, 
channels, the radio signal strength indicator (RSSI), 
network type, security, speed and signal intensities 
which allow to control  the signal qualities. 
IV. 
COVERAGE RESULTS 
We only have considered the walking area from which 
users typically connect to the wireless network. So, 
bathrooms, exterior stairways, storage rooms, etc. have been 
excluded. In order to perform this coverage analysis, a grid 
of 4 meters x 4 meters has been drawn in each floor. This 
allows us to take measurements for the different networks 
from the same places. The laptop in charge of taking 
measurements was located at a height of 100 cm above the 
ground. 
A. Ground floor 
This subsection shows the coverage study on the ground 
floor.  
There are 5 APs to cover the entire plant. There are four 
places with the highest coverage level (the values are higher 
than -50 dBm). We highlight 2 rooms, Room A, the 
multipurpose room, and Room B, the computer room (see 
fig. 5, 6 and 7). The AP located outside the wall of the 
computer room provides coverage levels below -70 dBm 
inside the classroom for all three cases. 
Fig. 5 shows the coverage area and levels of UPVNET 
wireless network on the ground floor. Room A presents 
signal strength of -90 dBm due to the signal attenuation 
suffered by the wireless signals when they cross some walls.  
Fig. 6 shows the coverage area for the UPVNET2G 
wireless network on the ground floor. We find three places 
where signal strengths are higher than -50 dBm. These 
places are just those ones where the APs are located 
currently. The multipurpose room has a very low coverage 
on the left side because the signal is greatly attenuated by 
several walls. 
Fig. 7 shows the value of signal strength for EDUROAM 
wireless network on the ground floor. Again, there are three 
places with signal strengths higher than -50 dBm, which 
correspond to the current location of the APs. In this case, 
more than half of the room B has signal strength levels 
below -70dBm. 
B. First floor 
This subsection shows the signal strengths measured on 
the first floor. In this case there are 4 APs to cover the entire 
plant. There are 4 places with the highest signal strengths 
(higher than -50dBm).  
Fig. 8 shows the signal strength for UPVNET wireless 
network on the first floor. The rooms at the left side have 
low radio coverage because the AP is not located in the 
correct place. The offices at the right side have also very 
poor signal strength because they are very close to the stairs 
and they suffer important signal attenuation.

Figure 8.  Radio coverage map of the first floor for UPVNET.  
Fig. 9 shows the UPVNET2G wireless network signal 
strengths on the first floor. We can see that the classroom on 
the left side is not well covered because of the position of the 
AP. It is located on the right side of the wall. The offices 
from the bottom right also have very poor coverage, because 
they are very close to the stairs, which generate significant 
signal attenuation. 
Fig. 10 shows the EDUROAM signal strengths on the 
first floor. In this case, we can see the same effect as in the 
other cases, but moreover there are tables in the study area 
(center of the picture) with low signal strength (lower than -
90 dBm). 
C. Second floor. 
This subsection shows the signal strengths measured on 
the second floor. The floor is covered by 4 APs.  
Fig. 11 shows the signal strengths for UPVNET wireless 
network on the second floor.  The highest signal level is 
provided by the AP located at the professors offices zone 
(central zone of the image),which provides signal levels 
lower than -60 dBm. Moreover, the AP located in the hall of 
the two computer rooms (top right of the Fig. 11), covers 
virtually the entire rooms, registering levels of -70dBm in the 
teacher's desk. The APs located at the central-left and the 
bottom-left areas of the library, have signal levels around -
60dBm, except at the areas near to the outer walls where 
values of-70dBm have been registered. 
Fig. 12 shows the signal strengths from the UPVNET2G 
network on the second floor. In this case, the signal is 
propagated with levels above -60dBm, practically in both 
computer rooms (top right of the image). In contrast, the 
professor offices (central zone of the image) register levels 
close to -50dBm. Finally, the area of journals and 
audiovisual resources of the library (bottom - left of the 
image) presents levels around -60dBm, showing levels 
around to -50dBm in the area near to the AP. 
Fig. 13 shows the signal strengths from EDUROAM 
wireless network on the second floor. The signal strength 
offered by the EDUROAM network is slightly lower than 
those ones shown for UPVNET and UPVNET2G networks. 
We can see that there are more areas with signal levels close 
to -70dBm. This happens in the computer rooms (top right of 
the image) and in the library (bottom - left of the image). 
Most of these areas are zones near to walls or walkways, 
which are not usually used as workplaces. 
We can conclude that the signal is correctly broadcasted 
through the entire floor and their signal strength levels are 
enough acceptable to cover the working places. 
After analyzing all the radio coverage images, it is easy 
to see that the behavior of the wireless signal in each floor is 
quite similar, only small variations have been registered. In 
addition to this, we have checked that the received signal 
strength is very low from bathrooms and toilets. This is 
because the amount of water pipes and copper tubes in the 
walls affects to the propagation path of the wireless signals 
attenuating them. We have also found low signal strength 
levels in the stairwells. The stairs usually are made of metal 
framework and a foundation which avoids a correct 
propagation of the signal.

COMPARATIVE STUDY 
In this section we compare the three received wireless 
signals from each available wireless network on the same 
plant. Fig. 14 shows the three signals at the ground floor. 
UPVNET2G provides better signal strength levels than 
UPVNET and EDUROAM. Signal strengths from the first 
floor are shown in Fig. 15. UPVNET2G is the network 
which reaches the highest signal strength. UPVNET and 
EDUROAM show similar behaviors although there are 
some locations where the received signal from EDUROAM 
network is better. 
Fig. 16 shows the behavior of signal strength on the 
second floor. UPVNET2G and EDUROAM show the same 
behavior from 3 meters to around 10 meters, but from 0 to 3 
meters and from 10 meters to 12 meters, the signal strength 
from EDUROAM network is better. The lowest signal 
strength is always performed by UPVNET network. Keeping 
in mind all graphs, it is easy to conclude that according to 
signal strength, the best wireless network is UPVNET2G. 
Furthermore, we observe that the ground floor presents 
generally better signal strengths than in the other two floors. 
VI. 
ANALYTICAL STUDY 
After analyzing the above figures, we can estimate the 
behavior of the wireless signals in indoor environments.  
Therefore, this section shows how the signal strength 
varies depending on the distance from the AP. In the 
previous section, we have shown the signal strength per floor 
and per SSID (Figs. 14, 15 and 16). In this section, we are 
going to work with the average value of all APs (per floor) 
and the mean value recorded for the three signals in order to 
analyze and generalize the overall network behavior since all 
APs used in the network are equal and the three signals are 
provided by the same AP. The mathematical equation is 
calculated from the tendency line of each graph.

The analytical study is performed for three networks 
(UPVNET, UPVNET2G and EDUROAM) again. In order to 
draw each one of these graphs, we have estimated the 
average value of the three signals provided by each wireless 
network. 
Fig. 17 shows the average value of the signal strength 
depending on the distance from the AP on the ground floor. 
Expression 1 shows the equation for the trend line (black line 
in Fig. 17) from our measurements. As we can see, it is a 
fifth-order 
polynomial 
equation, 
with 
a 
correlation 
coefficient (R2) equal to 1. However, we can appreciate a 
slight difference between them in positions close to 3-4 
meters, and further away than 17 meters from the APs.

Where Y represents the average value of the received 
signal strength in dBm and X is the distance in meters from 
the AP. 
Fig. 18 shows the average signal strength provided by the 
APs located on the first floor as a function of the distance 
from the APs. In positions further than 8 meters from the 
APs, both graphs vary very few between them, although the 
rest of the graph is identical. Equation 2 shows the 
expression for the trend line (black line in fig. 18) from our 
measurements.

VII. 
WLAN REDESIGN 
Designing WLANs which main focus is to provide the 
best service using the available resources efficiently requires 
careful planning. WLANs can be as small as a home 
network or as large as a network of a company with 
complex distributions and several buildings. Before 
installing a WLAN, it is essential to have the technical 
information about network devices and a well-defined plan 
for the development process. The usual sequence of steps in 
the APs location process is as follows: 
1) Firstly, an AP is placed in each corner of each floor 
of the building, and it is measured the maximum coverage 
area for each one of them.  
2) From these measurements, it is easy to determine the 
most suitable place for the APs taking into account that it is 
only needed 15% of overlapping area. 
This is the most reliable process in order to find out the 
best location for the APs. However, it is very tedious, 
impractical and it implies too much time for the networks 
designers. Moreover, sometimes it is unfeasible for example 
in big buildings due to the number of measurements needed 
to make an accurate decision about the best potential 
locations or in buildings where it is not possible to gain 
access to take measurements [20]. 
We are going to relocate APs and redesign a WLAN 
already installed, because as we have seen in Section 4, 
there are some areas where wireless coverage is very poor 
with wireless signal strength lower than -70dbm. So, in this 
section we propose several changes to improve the network 
infrastructure and to guarantee the greatest coverage in such 
areas. Moreover, wireless channels used by APs are also 
redefined in order to reduce the interference between them. 
A. WLAN Planification 
In order to relocate the APs, we have taken into account 
the structure and distribution of the building. This is so, 
because there are some manufacturing materials which 
attenuate wireless signals significantly, for instance metal or 
wood. So, there are environments such as bathrooms or 
large fitted wardrobes where APs must not be close to. 
According to the results and coverage maps shown in 
section 4, we decided to resign our network in order to 
improve its performance. The new APs placement is shown 
in fig. 20. Thus, several APs have been relocated on the 
ground floor. Firstly, the AP placed in the study room (point 
1) is moved to the window and a new AP is added just in the 
opposite wall (point 2). This relocation has involved a better 
service for students who connect to the Internet in the study 
room because wireless coverage has been increased. 
Secondly, the AP located at the hall of the free access 
computer room is moved to beside wall in the same room. 
Its current position provided very low signal strength to this 
room. The estimated signal strengths in the ground floor are 
shown in fig. 21. 
Moreover, on the first floor an AP (point 1) has been 
also relocated and two new APs have been added. The AP 
located in the hall on the left side (point 1) is moved to the 
door of the bookable study rooms. In this way, wireless 
signals pass through fewer walls and consequently they 
suffer less attenuation. The AP in point 2 is added in the 
center of the study room. This is a room where many 
students often go to work with their computers. As we have 
seen in the coverage maps on the first floor (section 4), 
some areas of the computer rooms do not have enough 
signal level, so we decided to add another AP in point 3 in 
order to improve the coverage. Fig. 22 shows the new APs 
location. The estimated signal strengths in the first floor are 
shown in Fig. 23. In both cases where APs have been 
relocated, we can observe that the signal strengths have 
been improved. 
In contrast, we have not changed anything on the second 
place since we have checked that the signal strengths are 
good enough. Fig. 24 shows the position of the APs on the 
second floor.

B. Channel assignment 
IEEE 802.11b and IEEE 802.11g standards define up to 
14 channels available for wireless devices. But each country 
or geographic area applies their own restrictions regarding to 
the number of available channels. The channels are not 
completely independent because each channel overlaps and 
causes interference to the nearest four channels. Signal 
bandwidth (22MHz) is greater than the distance between 
consecutive channels (5MHz). For this reason, a gap of at 
least 5 channels is needed to avoid interference between 
adjacent cells. Using a gap of 5 channels means reaching a 
difference of 25MHz. Channels 1, 6 and 11 are usually the 
most used but the use of channels 1, 5, 9 and 13 in European 
domains is not bad for the performance of networks [2]. 
Fig. 25 shows the channel distribution from 2.412 to 
2.484 GHz for the 5 main regulatory domains. In our case we 
use the regulatory domain of Europe, Middle East and Africa 
(EMEA) [13].

When new APs have been added to the network, we 
should define a new channel assignment for the network in 
order to avoid interference between the already installed APs 
and the new ones. 
Thus, our proposal of channel assignment according to 
our relocation and considering one more AP for the ground 
floor is shown in table 1. Moreover, it can be compared with 
the current distribution channel in which the APs 1 and 3 
share the same channel (channel 11) and the same happens 
with APs 4 and 5 in channel 1. This can make that these 
devices are interfering to each other. In our proposed channel 
assignment, these interferences will not occur. 
In the same way, table 2 shows the channel assignment 
for the first floor before and after relocating the APs and 
adding two more. We can see that the APs 1, 4 and 6, was 
initially working on channel 5, while in our proposed

channel assignment the interferences between devices are 
insignificant.  
Finally, table 3 shows the channel assignment for the 
second floor where no change was needed. In this case, we 
change the channel allocation, only to not interfere with the 
devices of the lower floor. 
As three tables show, the current channel assignment is 
made so that the devices do not interfere with the devices of 
the same floor. However, with the proposed channel scheme 
in this paper, interferences between floors are also avoided. 
VIII. 
CURRENT PERFORMANCE OF THE WIRELESS 
NETWORK. 
In order to measure the performance of the redesigned 
wireless networks in this study, we monitor the performance 
of them during the month of November 2012, both the 2.4 
GHz band and the 5GHz band. As we can see in the graphs 
shown in Figures 26-35, the amount of traffic carried on 
each band is vastly different, nearly all traffic is managed in 
the 2.4 GHz band, although the traffic in the 5GHz band is 
significant too. Moreover, we can also see how the traffic is 
greatly reduced during weekends.  
In figure 26, we can see the evolution of the amount of 
input bytes in both bands and the output bytes in figure 27. 
Figure 28 shows the total amount of transmitted fragments 
by the wireless networks. Then, the figures 29 and 30 show 
the evolution of the amount of frames CTS (clear to send) 
which are received and which are not received respectively 
in response to an RTS (Request to Send). It should be 
pointed that this evolution in the 5 GHz band is nearly null. 
Moreover, figure 31 shows the amount of transmission’s 
retries and figure 32 presents the amount of transmission’s 
multiple retries. Then, figure 33 show the evolution of the 
number of frames with some error in the FCS (frame check 
sequence) and figure 34 the evolution of failed frames in 
general. Finally, the last one (fig. 35) show the evolution of 
the number of ACK which are not received when expected. 
We represent the evolution of these frames to show the 
performance of the wireless networks for each available 
frequency band.

COMPARISON WITH OTHER INDOOR COVERAGE 
STUDY  
In order to check our study, the same process was 
performed in another building. In this case, only one AP 
was located within the building and signal strengths were 
measured from it. In this section, we see a comparison 
between both studies. 
For these tests, we have considered a wide indoor 
environment of 91 m2, with a length of 12.5 m., a width of 
6.68 m. and a height of 2.30 m. This building is made of 
walls with different thickness and materials, as we can find 
in common houses. The plant has a rectangular base 
divided into two parts by a wall of 9 cm: the garage on the 
left side and the kitchen on the right side. The enclosure of 
the staircase is made of bricks with high consistency. All 
walls have a layer of plaster and paint on both sides. The 
bathroom is made of hollow bricks of 9 cm. These walls 
are covered by ceramic tiles. All external walls are double 
with a thermic and acoustic insulation of polystyrene of 
5cm. 
Fig. 36 shows the level of coverage obtained in IEEE 
802.11g. In this case, we can see that the stairwell acts as a 
waveguide and signals are propagated easier in this 
direction than through the walls of the sides [21]. In this 
study, we conducted a study similar to that presented 
above. From that initial study, several conclusions were 
drawn regarding the signal behavior. However, we did not 
have other studies and it was difficult to generalize this 
behavior.

Figure 36.  Coverage for the IEEE 802.11g 
 
For our comparison, we should observe the signal 
propagation through the walls, as it can be found in any 
building. 
In this case, we can approximate the behavior of the 
signal by a sixth-order polynomial equation (see Eq. 4) 
with a correlation coefficient R2 higher than 0.9999. 
                                                
                          
(4) 
where Y represents the average of received signal strength 
in dBm and X is the distance in meters from the AP. 
The coverage maps shown in section 4 allowed us to 
analyze and characterize the behavior of the signals within 
this building. We performed an estimation of the average 
signal strength provided by the access points depending on 
the distance (considering the three floors). Equation 5 
shows the behavior of signals when they pass through 
walls:  
                                              
                             (5) 
where Y represents the signal strength in dBm and X, the 
distance from the AP in meters. 
Fig. 37 shows the behavior of the wireless signal 
working in IEEE 802.11g as a function of the distance. 
The red line shows the average of the signal strength in the 
new scenario and the blue line shows the average of the 
signal strength in the CRAI building. The most important 
conclusion is that the behavior of the signal is similar in 
both cases. However the signal strength values are 
different in both cases. This fact might suggest that the 
building area can influence in the coverage that an AP 
might offer. It is also shown that there are two flat zones 
that maintain the signal level in both signals and they 
could be used for future applications. We think that this 
difference is given by the multipath effect. In the CRAI 
building the signal levels (through walls) are acceptable in 
ranges up to 18 meters (having around -70dBm). If we 
extend the graph of the results obtained for the new 
scenario presented in this section, we estimate that we can 
achieve signal strengths higher than -70dBm up to 13-14 
m.

CONCLUSION 
The process to design a WLAN indoors could be a 
complicated and long process. It could happen that once 
the entire process has been performed, the result is not as 
successful as expected. Most probably some areas of low 
signal level may be created, where users do not have 
access to the network and to its resources.  
In this work, we have performed an analytical analysis 
based on the signal strengths in order to enhance the 
performance of the WLAN of the CRAI building. We have 
analyzed the 3 floors inside the building and, as we have 
seen in section 4, some areas had low signal strength. So, 
from the coverage maps and using an analytical study, we 
redesigned the wireless network, establishing new 
locations for the APs and a reassignment of channels. 
Thus, we have improved considerably the wireless 
coverage for accessing to the network. 
Therefore, this study can help to redesign wireless 
networks in similar buildings avoiding long and laborious 
processes. Moreover, the most suitable location for APs 
reduces the number of devices required to cover the whole 
building. 
Nowadays, we are working with these measurements 
to propose a new indoor positioning system for wireless 
sensors which will allow us to monitor an environment 
more efficiently. Moreover we will add algorithms that 
mix the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and the 
link quality indicator (LQI) in order to estimate the 
position inside the buildings [22]. We also want to expand 
this study for the IEEE 802.11n standard in order to reach 
higher data rates and greater distances.
