Abstract—We investigate the feasibility to extract system 
performance information based upon limited maintenance 
record of the Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation (TRTC).  The 
maintenance record consists of malfunction incident rate per 
month of the Taipei metro system.  It is desired to estimate the 
system lifetime from the maintenance record.  However, 
whether such information is contained in the maintenance 
record, and furthermore, if the information can be extracted is 
to be determined.  Moreover, the problem is further 
complicated by the regular maintenance, which further tampers 
the embedded information.  The research goal is to assess the 
feasibility to acquire the desired information from the available 
dataset.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
It is desirable to obtain system information from the 
maintenance data.  In this research, we investigate the Mass 
Rapid Transit (MRT) system of Taipei Rapid Transit 
Corporation (TRTC), which began operation in 1996 for 23 
years [1].  By analyzing the Taipei MRT maintenance records, 
we further explore the possibility to acquire information 
indicative of the system performance.  The research objective 
is to determine whether it is possible to acquire reliable 
information of the system performance from the limited time-
span maintenance records.  If such information can be 
extracted, it may be helpful to diagnose the condition of the 
Taipei MRT system.   
The performance and degradation of metropolitan metro 
systems play a crucial part in the civilians daily life and have  
attracted much attention of general public.  The performance, 
malfunction, or maintenance all have huge impacts on the 
daily life of the passengers and civilians.  Assessment and 
quantification of the system current status is essential to 
enhance performance.  The performance of such complex 
system is commonly analyzed using the degradation curve 
model; analysis of the reliability is based on failure rate and 
maintenance records [2].  By assessing the condition of the 
system, improvement of the maintenance and performance 
can be recommended.   
The performance record of various metropolitan metro 
systems in the world are studied.  For example, the subway 
system in New York City, USA, has a long history.  As 
reported in [3], train R36 serviced from 1964 to 2003, a total 
of 39 years.  R160s were used to replace 45-year-old trains.  
In another news report about the old trains [4], the oldest trains 
for New York City Subway were planned to serve for 58 
years, and now this type of trains are actually found too old 
with very high failure rated.  From the limited reference that 
we can access, an estimate of the subway train lifetime is 
estimated to be around 40 to 50 years.  For example, some 
lines of Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT) have been 
operating since 1987, 30 years from today.  On the other hand, 
TRTC operated from 1996, which is only 21 years ago.  There 
is a difference of 9 years.  The assets’ actual wear-out period 
may lie somewhere between 20 years (the oldest TRTC asset), 
and 40 years (New York City Subway).  All these 
metropolitan metro systems are different in various aspects, 
thus, the performance of such MRT systems are not the same.  
Research attempts to establish a degradation curve model 
from the maintenance data has not been satisfactory.  
The metro system is a complex system consisting of 
various components.  For example, the rail track condition 
monitoring is an important technical concern of the MRT 
system [5].  However, it is infeasible to constantly inspect 
track conditions; an inspection once a month or less is the 
common maintenance.  Severe track condition degradation is 
a potential threat to the railway system.  Hence, more attention 
has been devoted to monitoring track condition via in-service 
vehicles [6]-[8].  The general goal of the research and 
technical modifications is to improve the performance and 
reliability of a mass rapid transit system.   
Various approaches to analyze system performance have 
been reported [9]-[18], including the popular bathtub curve 
analysis [19]-[24].  The Bathtub curve model is widely used 
to assess system performance analysis [25].  Analysis based 
upon the bathtub curve has been extensively applied to various 
problems [11], [26]-[29].  Our research goal is to investigate 
the feasibility and validity to assess the performance of the 
Taipei MRT system based upon limited maintenance record.    
We investigate and analyze the Taipei MRT data.  We 
have data from Taipei MRT consisting of 11 systems: Electric 
Multiple Unit (EMU) propulsion, EMU Air Conditioner, 
EMU Communication, Switcher, Platform door, 22kV 
switchboard, Automated Fare Collection (AFC) door, Wenhu 
Line traffic control computer, Transmission system, elevator, 
and escalator.  Specifically, we search for characteristics and

compare with the bathtub degradation curve; the research 
objective is to acquire status information of the equipment and 
identify possible tendencies or features that may be indicative 
of the system performance.

METHOD 
System condition analysis using the bathtub-shaped curve 
model [25] is commonly employed.  It consists of a break-in 
trend as the system condition improves, followed by a plateau 
regime where the system condition is stable.  After this stable 
regime, the system condition withers with increased 
malfunction rate, followed by a steep increase of malfunction 
rate where the malfunction rate increases with time rapidly 
whereas the system breaks down.  Together, the bathtub-
shaped curve represents the various stages of an ideal system.   
However, not all system status can easily be compared to 
the bathtub-shaped degradation curve; it is an idealized 
theoretical model used in many problems.  It is an idealized 
trend that depends on various factors.  The feasibility of 
applying such bathtub-shaped curve may depend on the 
specific application and the various factors involved.  
Specifically, the system condition may not follow the same 
degradation curve, also, each equipment system may exhibit 
different characteristics depending on the specific application. 
It is proposed that the maintenance data would yield a 
simple bathtub-shaped degradation curve for an equipment 
that is operated under normal condition.  For systems that are 
affected by other factors, this theoretical degradation curve 
may be affected.  Most cases do not follow the same 
degradation curve.  For a complex system involving various 
brands, various models, and systems of various ages, the 
exhibited characteristics shall be different.  In addition, as 
maintenance decisions involve human decision factors, such 
uncertainty further complicates the degradation curve, causing 
the exhibited characteristics further derailing from the 
possible universal bathtub-shaped curve. 
Furthermore, each equipment in the Taipei metro system 
consists of various brands and various models that may 
possess different intrinsic characteristics.  Since each 
equipment is maintained by human, the degradation curve is 
tampered with human factors and may exhibit characteristics 
differ from the original degradation curve without human 
influence.  The research objective is to decipher whether such 
complex information can be extracted from the maintenance 
data of a limited time span. 
III. 
DATA ANALYSIS 
Maintenance data provided by TRTC is analyzed.  We 
employ linear regression and various regression models to 
identify the trend.  Through each method, our goal is to 
ascertain the general behavior of the dataset.  The limited 
dataset showed diverse characteristics which is inconclusive.  
The recorded number of malfunction incidents of the MRT 
transmission system per month as a function of age is shown 
in Figure 1.  The data is sporadic and gradually decrease with 
time.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As shown in Figure 1, the decreases with time is apparent.  
This could be due to the regular maintenance.  in this mostly 
likely is due to the improvement of MRT maintenance.  On 
the other hand, since the age of each equipment and the 
number of samples for each equipment are not consistent, the 
degradation curve exhibits mixed information of various 
complex factors.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The average malfunction rate of the Wenhu Line central 
computers as a function of age is shown in Figure 2.  Due to 
incomplete record, there are some maintenance data is 
missing.  Thus, the degradation trend may not be conclusive.

As shown in Figure 3, the average malfunction rate of the 
Muzha Line screen door as a function of age exhibits a gradual 
increase with age.  The data span only covers short period of 
time, but it clearly increases with age. A more complete 
dataset may be required for conclusive results.    
 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The goal of this paper is to assess the feasibility to extract 
status information of various Taipei MRT systems based 
upon the maintenance data.  The maintenance data is limited 
and only consists of a single parameter: count of the number 
of malfunction incidents per month.  By means of data 
analysis, our goal is to identify characteristics indicative of 
the current status of the metro system, remaining lifetime, and 
estimate its future trend.  Yet, the system information may 
not be fully contained in the provided maintenance record.  
The validity of the estimation based upon incomplete data, 
may be limited.   
The bathtub degradation curve could be affected by 
human factors; for example, if the asset retired in its early 
stage, the curve may not rise up during the wear-out period 
and may even descend.  If properly maintained, the curve 
may not rise in the wear-out period, similar to the situation in 
airline industry.  However, few MRT systems in reality 
exhibit degradation behavior similar to the bathtub curve 
model [30]. 
The degradation curve acquired from data analysis of the 
provided Taipei metro maintenance record has be assessed.  
however, the trend of each degradation curve exhibits various 
characteristics.  By comparing with the bathtub curve model, 
we tried to assess the status of each system.  However, the 
assessment is inconclusive. Possible factors include:  
 
1) Each system has not reached the steady state.   
2) Human factor such as maintenance tampers the 
natural trend. 
3) More data, longer temporal span of maintenance 
record is required to reveal a degradation trend.   
 
Based on the available maintenance records provided by 
TRTC, statistical analysis findings indicate that the Taipei 
metro is stable with no significant indication of degradation.  
Degradation curve acquired via statistical analysis is not 
conclusive.  More data may be required to establish the 
general trend.   
If the maintenance data contains severity information of 
each malfunction incident, data analysis may potentially 
yield more information to assess the status of the system.  On 
the other hand, it is not ascertained that the desired status 
information is embedded in the malfunction incident record, 
which is further tampered by the regular maintenance.  On a 
broader perspective, a fundamental question to be asked: Is 
the required information contained in the dataset?  If it isn’t, 
or perhaps only partial information is contained in the dataset, 
then even the most elaborate analysis approach cannot 
legitimately extract information that is not contained within 
the dataset.   
For future work, we recommend the maintenance record 
consists of more than a single-parameter, such as the severity 
of the malfunction, the cost of the malfunction, maybe 
mileage of operation between each malfunction incidents.  
The maintenance record will be a resourceful dataset for 
assessing the status of a complex system.  Such information 
may provide more direct information regarding the system 
status.  We believe such approach may be more sensitive and 
indicative, and potentially be indicative of the system status 
and system lifetime.
