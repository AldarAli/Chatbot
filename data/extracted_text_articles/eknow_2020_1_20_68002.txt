Abstract – Many organisations are now confronted with the new 
phenomenon of digitalization and are faced with the challenge 
of formulating and implementing a company-wide digital 
transformation strategy. Digitalization is associated with 
significant and extremely rapid change, and, in some cases, even 
the 
replacement 
of 
established 
business 
models. 
In 
manufacturing companies, this transformation is part of what is 
often termed Industry 4.0 and, in large companies, where the 
provision of information technology (IT) has hitherto been 
outsourced (in whole or in part), the introduction of these new 
technologies may be the catalyst for IT backsourcing. This 
entails bringing previously outsourced activities back in-house 
to regain ownership and control, in order to be more flexible 
and respond more effectively to rapidly changing demands. This 
study reviews the extant literature to assess existing thinking on 
the motivation for backsourcing, and then examines the 
potential role of digitalization in driving IT backsourcing in the 
German automotive industry. A provisional conceptual 
framework for subsequent research is put forward, using a 
knowledge-based view of the firm. The study is in its initial 
stages, but the model is being developed through more in-depth 
interviews to provide operational guidance for practitioners and 
subsequent research studies. 
Keywords – Backsourcing; digitalization; digital transformation; 
German automotive industry; conceptual model.   
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
A company's IT management must constantly review how 
it can deliver its services most effectively and efficiently [1]. 
This includes an on-going assessment of whether IT services 
are provided by the company's own resources or whether 
external resources are used.  In the latter case, an outsourcing 
decision is made and a company delegates all or part of its IT 
services through contractual outsourcing agreements to one or 
more external vendor [2]. Many different forms of IT 
outsourcing have emerged, all associated with expectations 
that the company can better concentrate on its core business, 
focus on innovation, reduce costs and increase the 
effectiveness of IT services [3].  
As and when such outsourcing agreements expire or the 
activity is reviewed, the decision has to be made as to whether 
to continue the agreement, to switch to another vendor, or to 
backsource the activities. Backsourcing is generally defined 
as bringing previously outsourced activities back in-house [4].  
This definition also implies that the decision on backsourcing 
was taken after considering the possibility of renewing or 
renegotiating the existing contract or switching the vendor [5].  
Significant change in the external technology environment 
-  such as digitalization and new automation technologies - can 
be the catalyst for IT backsourcing. The German automotive 
industry is the most affected of all industries by digitalization 
in the German economy [6], and has been chosen as the 
business environment within which to undertake this research. 
The aim of the study is to assess current understanding of IT 
backsourcing and determine what impact digitalization may 
have in the German automotive industry regarding IT 
backsourcing.  The study explores a relatively unknown field 
and will contribute to both research and practice, providing 
new knowledge for researchers and operational guidance for 
practitioners. 
This article has five sections. Following this Introduction, 
Section 2 looks at the main concepts under study, briefly 
discusses relevant background issues and sets out three main 
research questions. Section 3 then outlines the research 
methodology, which to date has comprised a systematic 
literature review. Section 4 addresses the three research 
questions and makes an initial attempt to establish a 
conceptual framework for the continuation of the research 
project. Finally, Section 5 provides a summary of the ground 
covered in the paper to date.  
II. 
BACKGROUND & CONCEPT DEFINITIONS 
It is useful to first establish an understanding of the 
terminology and definitions associated with this study, as 
certain terms are not used in a consistent way. This applies 
above all to the terms “IT Backsourcing” and “Digitalization”. 
Backsourcing is one part of the IT-sourcing cycle which can 
be summarized as “insourcing + outsourcing – outsourcing = 
backsourcing” [7]. Backsourcing has been defined by Lacity 
and Willcocks [4] as bringing previously outsourced activities 
back in-house. “Insourcing” is sometimes used as a general 
term for performing activities in-house and the literature does 
not distinguish between insourcing and backsourcing [8].  
Many different forms of IT outsourcing have emerged, which 
can be combined in many ways and lead to a high degree of 
complexity, there being many possible dimensions to the 
outsourcing process. The same variety and complexity also 
applies to backsourcing.

Terms, such as backshoring, reshoring, onshoring or 
relocating, 
are 
sometimes 
used 
synonymously 
with 
backsourcing. However, Nujen et al. [9] underlined that these 
terms imply a change in location and, therefore, backsourcing 
is the only term that determines a change in ownership. A 
distinction can also be made between total and selective 
outsourcing/backsourcing. Lacity and Hirschheim [10] 
defined total outsourcing as being when more than 80% of IT 
budgets are outsourced to an external provider. Similarly, total 
insourcing occurs when more than 80% of the IT budget 
remains within the company. Finally, selective sourcing 
describes a degree of outsourcing of between 20% and 80% 
of the IT budget. Selective outsourcing has been the most 
popular and the most successful outsourcing strategy [11]. 
This study applies the same definitions to backsourcing, 
which can be both the backsourcing of a single IT service, 
such as a datacenter, or a bundle of applications, and the 
partial or complete backsourcing, where a company rebuilds 
the previously outsourced IT organization. 
There is some overlap in the literature of the terms 
“digitization”, “digitalization” and “digital transformation”.  
Digitization is a more technical interpretation and refers to the 
conversion of information from an analog to a digital storage 
medium [12]. It also equates to the transfer of tasks to the 
computer that were previously performed by humans. Thus, 
digitization also refers to a special form of automation. The 
focus is on digital technologies, for which the term 
“SMACIT” (social, mobile, analytics, cloud, and Internet of 
Things) has been coined [13].  This has been widened by some 
authors to also encompass Big Data, artificial intelligence, 
digital twin, 3-D-Printing, augmented and virtual reality, and 
robotics. Many of the technologies mentioned are not new or 
revolutionary on their own. Rather, their innovative potential 
stems from their significantly enhanced efficiencies, their 
intensive networking possibilities and their increasingly 
widespread use [14].  
The term digitalization is more broadly defined and is 
intended to express the fact that digitalization now affects all 
economic and social areas [12]. Riedl et al. [15] define 
digitalization as “the process of introducing digital 
technologies, which essentially deal with changes caused by 
information technologies”. Koch, Ahlemann and Urbach [16] 
define four conditions for this. First, the technologies used do 
not have to be new, rather the newness is created in the context 
of business and value creation models; second, digitalization 
is data-driven and is based on an increased generation, 
processing and analysis of often new types of data; third, 
digitalization means that the character of the value added or 
the business model changes significantly as a result; and 
fourth, that there is an association with a clear strategic 
dimension, as companies expect competitive advantages from 
it.  
Digital transformation is a result of digitalization and 
describes the development steps towards new, disruptive 
business and value creation models [17]. For Singh and Hess 
[18], this requires a company-wide digital transformation 
strategy to guide a company through the transformation 
process. However, there is no uniform definition of this term 
to date. Vial [19] reviewed 282 digital transformation related 
academic publications and found 23 different definitions. 
Based on the existing definitions, he developed a conceptual 
definition of digital transformation as "a process that aims to 
improve an entity by triggering significant changes to its 
properties through combinations of information, computing, 
communication, and connectivity technologies” [19].  
Industry 4.0 can be viewed as part of digitalization, 
encompassing the entry of complex digital technologies and 
architectures into manufacturing processes. A generally 
accepted definition has not yet been established in the 
literature, but the definition of Roth [20] is used in the context 
of this research. “Industry 4.0 comprises the networking of all 
human and machine actors along the entire value chain as well 
as the digitalization and real-time evaluation of all relevant 
information with the aim of making processes and value 
creation more transparent and efficient in order to optimize 
customer benefits with intelligent processes and services.” 
Industry 4.0 is also sometimes called the “fourth industrial 
revolution” or Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), where the 
focus is on the strong integration of Internet-based 
information and communication technology (cyber-physical 
systems) into industrial processes [20].  
      Industry 4.0 has its roots in the concept of the Smart 
Factory and this is viewed as the starting point and main 
purpose of Industry 4.0 [21]. People, machines and products 
to be manufactured are connected in a network. The aim of 
this network is to achieve the overall optimization of quality, 
lead time and utilization of resources. It is considered a 
decisive innovation that all data are available in real time, 
providing a permanently up-to-date, virtual image of reality 
which allows complex manufacturing processes to be better 
controlled [21]. The Smart Factory represents an adaptable 
system in which flexible production lines automatically 
adjust their processes to different types of products and 
changing conditions [22].   
In recent years, digitalization has become one of the most 
important topics in social, scientific and economic life [12].  
Digital technologies are regarded as major technical changes 
or breakthroughs and the associated digital transformation is 
seen as a driver for significant and extremely rapid change, in 
some cases even leading to the replacement of established 
business models [23]. The term “transformation” reflects the 
variety and complexity of the measures that may need to be 
taken when companies are confronted with these new and 
disruptive technologies [18]. Some companies may see this as 
requiring a company-wide digital transformation strategy, 
which can encompass all business areas as well as products, 
processes and organizational structures.   
If pre-existing IT strategy is aligned with the business, IT 
can be seen as an enabler for digital transformation [24].  
Companies may review their IT sourcing strategies and 
governance models and consider alternatives for existing 
outsourcing arrangements [25]. This in turn may lead to a 
move towards IT backsourcing. Many companies have 
already established innovation labs, digital factories or 
technology accelerators in recent years in order to keep up 
with the increased demands of digitalization [26]. 
Volkswagen, for example, strengthened its IT department

with 1,000 new IT employees from various disciplines [27]. 
At Daimler, too, there are signs of a part move away from the 
IT sourcing strategy that has been pursued for years, aimed at 
increasing its own contribution to IT from 25% to 35% [28].  
The significance of digitalization as a factor in the 
backsourcing of IT provisions has received little attention in 
the scientific literature so far. In contrast to insourcing and 
outsourcing, IT backsourcing generally lacks scientific studies 
[29]. The literature that does exist deals mainly with the 
reasons and decision-making processes for IT backsourcing in 
relation to contract problems that have led to failure [30]. 
Internal or external organizational changes are only explained 
using individual examples of high profile / large-scale events, 
which have received press attention but cannot support 
generalization [31].   
The German automotive industry consists of the Original 
Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and a three-tier supplier 
network. 
The 
industry 
is 
facing 
serious 
external 
organizational changes, which are leading to four megatrends 
in the automotive industry: Connectivity, Autonomous 
Driving, Shared & Services, Electric [32], for which the 
acronym C.A.S.E. is often used. 
Each of the C.A.S.E. elements has the power to radically 
change the industry and undermine existing business models. 
The challenge will be to combine them in a way that delivers 
a comprehensive and seamless package to the customer. 
Digitalization and Industry 4.0 and the associated connection 
of the physical with the digital world, as well as the 
networking of the entire value chain, are the drivers of this 
change [33]. 
Digitalization and digital transformation affect all areas of 
a company. The aim of the study is to analyze to what extent 
digitalization has influenced the German automotive 
industry's strategy regarding IT backsourcing and provide 
new insights concerning the decision making and values 
created by IT backsourcing.  The current study addresses three 
Research Questions (RQs): 
RQ 1:  
What does the extant literature reveal 
regarding current thinking on the rationale for IT 
backsourcing? 
RQ 2:  
To what extent has digitalization influenced 
the German automotive industry's strategy  regarding 
IT 
backsourcing and what are its potential benefits? 
RQ 3:  
How can an operational framework be 
developed and applied to aid practitioners in  backsourcing 
IT in the German automotive industry? 
This article presents initial findings from the study that are 
now being pursued through in-depth interviews with industry 
practitioners. 
In 
general, 
current 
evidence 
for 
IT 
backsourcing, as presented in the existing literature, brings 
only partial answers the research questions of this study.

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
To date, a systematic literature review has been 
undertaken. The search for existing and relevant literature was 
carried out in three stages. As the selection of search terms 
(keywords) has a significant impact on the search results [34], 
an initial exploratory search was undertaken in April 2019 in 
order to ascertain key terminologies and concepts used in the 
literature. A combination of keywords was used in the search 
string when identifying relevant literature.  
A second systematic search was carried out in May 2019 
using complex combinations of keywords, and a third search 
was undertaken in July/August 2019, after reformulating the 
research questions. Keyword searches were conducted in the 
Science Direct, IEEExplore, Business Source Complete 
(EBSCO), AIS Electronic Library and Google Scholar 
databases, restricting the publication dates to be within the 
year 2008 and after, because the topic of digitalization was not 
a current issue before 2008. 
A practical screening was performed [35], and after 
deleting duplications and separating all non-relevant ones, 22 
publications were selected. Backward and forward searches 
based on references and authors were performed to uncover 
seminal publications on the subject of IT backsourcing [36].  
The backward search showed no further results. The forward 
search resulted in 5 more articles from Sage journals, 
SpringerLink, Emerald insight and Researchgate. Of the 27 
articles in total, 13 are peer reviewed. Practice-oriented 
publications such as the frequently published magazines MIT-
Technology report, CIO magazine or reports from the 
Association of German Automobile Manufacturers (VDA) as 
well as from international IT consulting and supplier 
organizations were also reviewed. 
IV.  PRELIMINARY FINDINGS 
RQ1: What does the current literature reveal regarding 
current thinking on the rational for IT backsourcing? 
The reasons for individual backsourcing decisions are a 
focus in both the academic and practitioner literature. The 
practitioner literature highlights cost savings, quality 
improvements, and increase in control and flexibility as the 
three most important reasons [37]. The academic literature 
looks at a broader picture and distinguishes between the three 
important 
categories: 
contract 
problems, 
internal 
organizational changes and external environmental changes, 
to which individual reasons are assigned [2]. Contract 
problems emerges as the main reason for backsourcing until 
now (Table I).  
As regards contract problems, one of the main motivators 
for backsourcing is dissatisfaction with the quality of services 
provided by the vendor. Moe et al. [38] state a lack of 
communication between client and vendor, the inability to 
provide the necessary knowledge and skilled resources, a high 
turnover of employees on the vendor side and cultural 
problems such as different understandings of responsiveness 
and punctuality. Gorla and Lau [39] have analyzed how 
negative experiences in outsourcing affect future outsourcing 
decisions. They conclude that competence and coordination 
problems with the vendor have a stronger influence on 
backsourcing and future outsourcing decisions than 
unexpected costs. According to Kotlarsky and Bognar [40] 
low service quality is typically linked to poor responsiveness 
or a lack of professionalism on the vendor's side. The 
relationship between client and vendor, as well as trust, also 
plays a significant role in either changing vendors or taking 
backsourcing into account [41]. The gap between expected 
and actual cost reductions through outsourcing is another 
9

important driver for backsourcing. As Kotlarsky and Bognar 
[40] point out, cost savings through outsourcing tend to be 
overestimated and hidden costs such as transition costs, rising 
wages in the outsourcing destination country or staff turnover 
are not sufficiently taken into account. Another critical factor 
is losing control over the vendor’s activities or over certain 
functions [8]. This can be risky if security or intellectual 
capital is involved, or if it turns out that outsourced systems 
have a strategic value. 
 Kotlarsky and Bognar [40] stated that a knowledge 
mismatch is one reason for loss of control if the vendor knows 
more about the systems than the client does or the vendor only 
barely understands the client's business. One more factor for 
backsourcing is when the vendor does not respond to the latest 
technologies which deliver the best value to the customer [42].  
Losing control also leads to limited flexibility for the client 
compared to in-house operations [43]. Benaroch et al. [44] 
contend that in times of increased demand uncertainty, there 
is a tendency among clients towards backsourcing or 
insourcing decisions, as opposed to vendors' view that these 
situations would be motivators for outsourcing. They also 
claim that companies would prefer the flexibility of contracts 
in increased demand uncertainty, e.g. the possibility to pay a 
lump sum as a penalty to ease backsourcing. However, 
without the flexibility built into the original outsourcing 
contract, the probability of backsourcing is limited.  
The most recent studies show, however, that contract 
problems and the resulting operational difficulties are no 
longer major drivers of backsourcing. Könning, Westner and 
Strahringer [31] analyzed over 1,000 sourcing deals in 
Austria, Switzerland and Germany between 2006 and 2017 
and show that the companies are able to manage a large 
number of IT vendors. They also mention that companies use 
international sourcing consultancies (e.g. ISG, Accenture, 
BCG, Deloitte, KPMH, PwC) to design tenders and contracts, 
support the transition process, the provision of global delivery 
models and advise on the processes for the constant 
monitoring of the various vendors and services.  A review of 
the German automotive industry shows that, on the one hand, 
the depth of service in the in-house provision of IT services is 
generally between 20% and 30% of the overall IT budget [28], 
while at the same time companies have employed thousands 
of IT employees worldwide [45]. These IT organizations have 
also developed and implemented comprehensive process 
models to minimize contractual and operational risks in 
outsourcing [46]. However, Solli-Saether and Gottschalk [47] 
refer to the Sourcing Circle and the stages-of-growth model to 
determine whether a formerly in-house function has a higher 
degree of maturity when it comes back after years of 
outsourcing. They argue that the outsourcing phase is not a 
waste of time, “it is not a return to the beginning, but 
something that has been altered” [47].  
The literature on internal organizational factors for IT 
backsourcing focuses on the discussion of strategic 
reorientation in the company, the intensive debate about the 
value of IT and internal power-political behaviour, which are 
more subjective and therefore more difficult to assess [48]. In 
this context, the role of IT and the sourcing strategy of IT are 
repeatedly reassessed. According to Butler [48], the proper 
alignment between business and IT strategy is the link to re-
position IT from commodity to IT as strategic and leads to 
appropriate backsourcing decisions. He also points out that 
not all IT functions are core business or non-core business, but 
the challenge is to categorize IT functions as either 
commodity or strategic in order to adjust the IT sourcing 
strategy. Qu, Oh and Pinsonneault [49] also emphasize that 
companies should make more efforts to assess the strategic 
value of IT, rather than considering IT as a non-core activity. 
Benaroch et al. [50] add that strategic considerations play an 
important role in transaction- and information-intensive 
processes with volatile demand and that backsourcing 
increases the capabilities for innovation and competitive 
advantages. 
Thakur-Wernz [51] combined the two theoretical lenses -
Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) and Resource Based 
View (RBV) - and concluded that companies decide 
backsourcing for two reasons: short-run total costs and 
internal capabilities. She contradicts earlier research, which 
assumes that costs and capabilities play a complementary role 
and are intertwined, especially in the long run. Based on a 
backsourcing topology, however, Thakur Wernz [51] claims 
that costs and capabilities are independent of each other, 
especially in the short-term. The reason for this assumption is 
that companies would not be in a position to change or expand 
their capabilities at short notice. She concludes that companies 
are less likely to undertake backsourcing when the total short-
term costs of backsourcing are higher, and more likely to go 
for backsourcing when internal reintegration capabilities are 
higher. 
Oshri et al. [52] stated that dissatisfaction with an 
outsourcing agreement is an even stronger driver for 
backsourcing decisions than cost considerations. They used 
the behavioral theory as a lens, which is based on realistic 
assumptions about human cognition and relationships. The 
theory suggests that decision making in companies is 
characterized by the limited rationality and organizational 
politics of decision makers. The assumption is that problem-
driven managers tend to make irrational decisions rather than 
based on a systematic assessment of long-term opportunities 
and risks. The transition from outsourcing and especially from 
offshoring to backsourcing means a radical change of strategy 
with significant economic consequences. Those responsible 
would do well to first consider a detailed feasibility study. 
Qu et al. [49] postulate, from the knowledge-based view, 
that IT backsourcing would create value and competitive 
advantage. Best practice processes require the integration of 
IT and business knowledge and this interaction increases the 
alignment between IT and business objectives. Shared 
knowledge and smooth coordination between IT and business 
is not a commodity, which can be bought on the market. This 
in-house knowledge only evolves over many years and is part 
of the corporate culture. 
External environmental changes such as economic cycles 
with volatile demand, financial crises, changes in the structure 
of the industry that redefine the overall business strategy of 
the company are identified by some authors as the catalyst for 
backsourcing [52]-[54]. Regarding mergers and acquisitions, 
several authors cited the example of how JP Morgan Chase 
10

terminated its large-scale outsourcing contracts after the 
merger with Bank One or Bank of Scotland merged with or 
Halifax Building Society because the mergers gave rise to new 
internal capabilities to provide in-house IT services more 
effectively. In addition, changes on the vendor side are 
triggers for backsourcing, when the vendor redefines its 
business strategies or its organizational structure, which is 
often the result of mergers and acquisitions between vendors.  
German companies have been affected by the wave of 
concentration on the vendor side, which can also be assumed 
as a reason for backsourcing.  
Thakur-Wernz [51] refers to the bandwagon effect 
mentioned by Lacity and Hirschheim [10]. Outsourcing was 
widespread, many companies did it and therefore more 
companies followed suit. There was significant increased risk 
that the outsourcing decision was not adequately researched 
and assessed, and backsourcing is the correction of 
outsourcing failures. Ironically, the bandwagon effect could 
now also happen with backsourcing. Finally, and most 
significantly for this study, Wong [43] and Von Bary [55] 
state that new and disruptive technologies, lead to a 
repositioning of the value of IT and trigger backsourcing 
decisions.

RQ2: To what extent has digitalization influenced the 
German automotive industry's strategy regarding IT 
backsourcing and what are its potential benefits?   
 
Germany is the second largest outsourcing market in the 
western world [56] but is under-represented in the academic 
literature, although online sources provide evidence of a 
number of failures in large outsourcing deals in German 
industry. In addition, digital technologies are regarded as 
major technological changes, and the associated digital 
transformation is seen as potentially leading in some cases to 
the replacement of established business models. The German 
automotive industry as a manufacturing industry and the most 
important German industrial sector is particularly affected by 
these changes. New digital business models are becoming the 
starting point for the future competitiveness of the German 
automotive industry on the world market [57]. According to 
Veltri et al. [2] and others, external environmental changes are 
seen as motivators for IT backsourcing because the core 
competencies of a company need to be redefined. These 
dependencies and effects have not yet been specifically 
investigated by researchers using the example of an entire 
industry in Germany. 
Researchers have applied various theories, such as TCE, 
RBV or Knowledge-Based View (KBV), to explain and 
demonstrate the benefits of IT backsourcing. However, there 
is some debate concerning the extent to which these theories 
are useful in evaluating IT backsourcing decisions and 
providing practical guidance. According to Wernerfelt [58] 
and Barney [59], the RBV considers an organization from the 
inside and the central thesis of the RBV is that companies 
generate sustainable competitive advantage by introducing 
strategies that exploit their internal strengths. The RBV was 
later enhanced by contributions from various authors to the 
KBV and it has been argued that competitive advantages are 
achieved not only on the basis of physical or financial 
resources, but also through knowledge-based capabilities 
[60]. Teece, Pisano and Shuen [61] published the theory of 
Dynamic Capabilities (DC) in 1997, which extends the 
internal view to the market and defined the DC as "the firm’s 
ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and 
external 
competences 
to 
address 
rapidly 
changing 
environments” (p. 516). 
According to Teece, Pisano and Shuen [61] markets can 
be divided into moderate and highly dynamic markets. 
Moderate dynamic markets are characterized by continuous 
changes. These are relatively easy to predict. Moderate 
markets are transparent and stable. Resources, organizations 
and processes are generally based on existing skills, 
knowledge and abilities. Highly dynamic markets, on the 
other hand, are characterized by rapid changes, have unstable 
structures and the resources of a company are based less on 
existing skills than on situation-specific knowledge, skills and 
abilities that can be quickly developed and newly created. The 
static approach of the RBV is not suitable for this field of 
operation [62]. The RBV would only apply to firms in 
predictable environments.  
Since the German automotive industry is in a highly 
dynamic market because of the digital transformation, the 
theories applied to answer the question of whether IT

backsourcing contributes to a sustainable competitive 
advantage or not should be extended to include the DC 
approach. A review of the existing literature shows that there 
is no analysis and evaluation with the DC theory on IT 
backsourcing. 
Previous research on IT backsourcing deals with IT 
technology and IT systems in general. In the context of the 
strategic alignment between business and IT, there is a need 
to examine which outsourced IT functions, technologies or 
applications are brought back in-house, particularly against 
the background of digital transformation, in order to achieve 
sustainable competitive advantages.  There is clearly a link to 
the core production process as many manufacturing 
companies have outsourced parts of their production, 
especially to offshore locations such as China. It is to be 
expected that digitalization and Industry 4.0 will lead to 
backsourcing of production to some extent [63]. The new 
technologies provide opportunities for production to be more 
flexibly and cost-effectively re-located in the home country 
again because the cost advantages that originally resulted in 
offshoring can be neutralized and, secondly, the application of 
Industry 4.0 technologies then increase flexibility in the 
production process. This would also have implications on 
outsourced IT services for manufacturing processes. 
Backsourcing does not necessarily mean that the affected 
functions and capacities are locally returned to the 
headquarters of the mother organization. The German 
automotive industry has worldwide access to resources and 
know-how and has the opportunity to network resources and 
knowledge with modern forms of agile cooperation [27]. 
RQ3: How can an operational framework be developed 
and applied to aid practitioners in backsourcing IT in the 
German automotive industry? 
The existing literature partly shows in individual case 
studies the challenges of knowledge transfer during 
outsourcing and provides overviews of the requirements for 
knowledge re-integration during backsourcing or switching 
vendors. An overall framework that offers guidance to 
practitioners involved in backsourcing in the German 
automotive industry is missing. 
The proposed conceptual framework (Figure 1) represents 
the theoretical basis for answering the research questions in 
this study. It uses the theory of dynamic capabilities to 
investigate the value of IT backsourcing. The concept of 
dynamic capabilities can be divided into the ability to identify 
and shape opportunities and threats, the ability to seize 
opportunities and the ability to maintain competitiveness by 
improving, combining, protecting and reconfiguring the assets 
of 
the 
business 
[64]. 
Therefore, 
sensing, 
seizing, 
reconfiguring and transforming are the main components of 
dynamic capabilities. This theory is combined with the 
knowledge-based view of the firm, since it is assumed that 
digital transformation requires significant change in the 
knowledge-base of the company to increase its innovative 
capacity [65]. However, in combining these theoretical 
perspectives, three main dimensions of change relating to the 
new digital technologies, the change in processes relating to 
IT backsourcing and the necessary enhancement of people 
skills and capabilities will be used as an operational model to 
identify critical success factors and a staged action plan to 
achieve competitive advantage from the backsourcing 
process. This aligns with other studies of change and 
innovation relating to the introduction of new technologies 
into organizations [66]. IT backsourcing may thus be viewed 
as a strategic decision of a company to respond to the rapidly 
changing external environment and provide a source of 
sustainable competitive advantage. This is especially the case 
when this enables important innovation, increases flexibility 
to respond very effectively to new business requirements, 
introduces emerging technologies to achieve new capabilities 
and facilitates the rapid placement of new digital business 
models, products or services in the marketplace. 
The knowledge-based view has received a great deal of 
interest in the literature because it recognizes the fundamental 
economic changes that have resulted from the accumulation 
and availability of knowledge over the last two decades [67]. 
The economy has undergone a structural change in the 
productive paradigm. The transition from production to 
service in most developed economies is based on the 
manipulation of information and not on the use of physical 
products [68]. Knowledge has become one of the most 
important assets for creating a sustainable competitive 
advantage [69]. 
This trend becomes even more pronounced with 
digitalization. The digital future means everything is 
expressed in terms of data. A central element of digitalization 
and of Industry 4.0 is the generation of huge amounts of data 
with cyber-physical systems and the storage and linking with 
technologies such as Big Data. However, data itself are of 
little value. The data from many different sources are only 
transformed 
into 
valuable 
information 
through 
comprehensive analyzes and correlations to become a 
strategic value. Therefore, what matters is the management of 
information and the intelligent usage of this information for 
new business models and processes, interlinking the company 
with its ecosystems, for cognitive solutions, virtual reality, 
predictions and robotics. New core competencies and unique 
knowledge becomes the critical success factor. 
The conceptual framework and underlying philosophy of 
the study is therefore based on the author's belief that the 
digital transformation of a company is an eminently 
knowledge-based issue. The theory of the knowledge-based 
view of the firm assumes that a company exists because it has 
advantages in the market through the generation of knowledge 
and innovations [70]. In addition to the dynamic capabilities, 
in responding to changes in the external environment, 
knowledge is also a key resource for achieving sustainable 
competitive advantage.

Figure 1. Provisional Conceptual Framework 
      As outlined above, the provisional conceptual framework 
(Figure 1) constitutes an initial model for addressing the 
research questions and provides the basis for discussion in 
expert interviews. Interview findings will help determine if 
digitization is encouraging IT backsourcing, and to what 
extent this can be seen as a source of competitive advantage. 
Any such correlations and conclusions will need to take 
account of other influencing entrepreneurial factors. The 
underlying logic is that digitalization leads to extremely rapid 
change, in some cases even the replacement of established 
business models. The German automotive industry must 
demonstrate appropriate capabilities in two directions. They 
must have dynamic capabilities to react flexibly to the 
accelerating changes in the external environment. At the 
same time, they must have the internal capabilities in terms 
of resources and knowledge in order to drive and support the 
necessary innovation. This can provide the basis for a 
company-wide digital transformation strategy, encompassing 
possible repositioning in the marketplace, reworking of 
sourcing agreements, and implementation of necessary 
change in terms of technologies, processes and people 
competencies.  
V. 
CONCLUSION 
   The literature review indicated that there are three main 
motivations for IT backsourcing: unsolvable contractual 
problems, internal organizational changes and external 
environmental changes, with the advent of digitalization 
being a potentially significant driver in future in the last 
named category. Digitalization has the potential for new, 
disruptive business and value models and requires companies 
to shape the digital transformation process.  
      In particular, the German automotive industry is affected 
by four megatrends due to serious external changes, for 
which digitalization is one of the main triggers. Given these 
developments, and drawing on a combination of existing 
theories, a provisional conceptual framework was devised to 
determine the context in which IT backsourcing should be 
seen, and which will now be applied to identify critical 
success factors and key actions for the successful adoption of 
a backsourcing strategy.  
IT backsourcing arguably creates better conditions for the 
interaction between IT and business and for sharing and 
integrating IT and business knowledge, which can underpin 
the adoption of best practice [49]. Through IT backsourcing, 
mission critical knowledge can be brought back in-house; the 
protection of intellectual property and security issues are 
taking on a new significance in the context of digitalization 
and may be seen as driving IT backsourcing.  
      The contribution of this research to theory has several 
aspects.  First, it will provide an informed view on whether 
digitalization is encouraging IT backsourcing – currently a 
gap in the extant literature. Second, it will explore and 
explain how companies in the German automotive industry 
justify decisions for IT backsourcing within the framework

of a company-wide digital transformation strategy. This will 
allow key issues regarding IT backsourcing to surface - for 
example, the need to develop dynamic capabilities and 
redefine core competencies in order to achieve sustainable 
competitive advantages in the so-called digital age. Research 
results will also establish the methods used by companies to 
forge a strategic link between digitalization and IT 
backsourcing and to determine the resulting value.  
     In terms of contribution to practice, the project aims to 
provide decision makers with operational guidance to assess 
the scenarios of IT backsourcing as part of a digital 
transformation strategy. This will improve knowledge for 
practitioners about the various factors to be considered for 
identifying 
the 
strategic 
value 
contribution 
of 
IT 
backsourcing. The study will provide illustrative examples of 
the practices, procedures and organizational change needed 
for re-establishing IT services in-house. Finally, an 
operational framework and associated strategy checklist will 
provide practitioners with the tools to assess the impact of IT 
backsourcing decisions on the overall performance of a 
company, and guide priority-settings for IT backsourcing 
projects as an enabler for digitalization.
