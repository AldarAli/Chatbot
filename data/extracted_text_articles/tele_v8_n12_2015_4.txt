Abstract— This paper presents an overall design path towards 
our fully monolithic envelope-tracking (ET) power amplifier 
(PA) in a 0.35 µm SiGe BiCMOS technology. First, a discrete 
hybrid switching supply modulator (SM) is designed to study 
the effects of its switching frequency and bandwidth limitation 
to the linearity and efficiency of an overall ET-PA. Next, the 
same circuit configuration is used for our CMOS SM which 
modulates our self-biased cascode SiGe PA with the proposed 
envelope shaping function. By analyzing the power losses of the 
CMSO SM under our special ET operation, we show the SM 
can still achieve high efficiency with a relatively low switching 
frequency, which helps to improve the system linearity. At 1.9 
GHz, our BiCMOS cascode ET-PA delivers the maximum 
linear output power (Pout) of 24/23.4 dBm with the overall 
power-added-efficiency (PAE) of 41%/38% for the long-term 
evolution (LTE) 16QAM 5/10 MHz signals, respectively. 
Meanwhile, good linearity and low spurious emission are 
achieved without the need of digital predistortion (DPD).

 INTRODUCTION 
Broadband 3G/4G/WLAN wireless standards utilize 
highly spectral-efficient modulation schemes with inherent 
non-constant envelope signals having high peak-to-average 
power ratios (PARs). In a typical mobile transmitter (TX), 
the radio frequency (RF) power amplifier (PA) tends to be 
the most power-hungry block. Although high efficiency can 
be achieved by the PA at the saturated output power (Psat) for 
GSM handset systems, its high distortion at Psat violates the 
linearity specs for non-constant envelope signals (e.g., in the 
case of long-term evolution (LTE)). Therefore, the PA is 
usually required to be backed off from its Psat for non-
constant envelope signals, resulting in poor efficiency.  
The envelope tracking (ET) technique is a promising 
solution to improve the PA efficiency for broadband 
applications [1]-[12]. In ET-PA systems, the envelope signal 
from a supply modulator (SM) dynamically modulates the 
PA collector or drain voltage in response to the instantaneous 
output power (Pout). In practical implementation, a hybrid 
switching SM (also called as a linear-assisted switching SM) 
is often used to achieve a good balance between the 
efficiency and the wideband envelope tracking [1]-[16]. 
Although many articles have reported excellent efficiency by 
using this hybrid switching SM, its design details still need 
to be studied and optimized with a specific PA to achieve the 
best trade-off between the efficiency and linearity for the 
overall ET-PA. In ET systems, both the PA and SM are the 
distortion sources, thus if the SM can be tuned for better 
linearity without suffering a great efficiency reduction, the 
PA can be pushed into deeper compression, leading to higher 
overall efficiency. Moreover, a hybrid switching SM is 
typically designed with a high average switching frequency 
(e.g., ≥ 2 MHz in [9]-[11]), creating out-of-band spurs which 
may violate the spectral mask of interest and spurious 
emission specs. To sufficiently suppress the high frequency 
switching ripples, the linear stage of the hybrid switching 
SM must have an ultra-wide bandwidth, inevitably 
increasing the design complexity [17]. Therefore, it becomes 
necessary to understand how much the average switching 
frequency can be lowered without hurting much on the SM 
efficiency. To address the concerns mentioned above, in this 
paper, we will present our complete design path towards a 
fully monolithic ET-PA in a silicon based technology.  
In Section II, a discrete hybrid switching SM is designed 
to study the effects of the bandwidth limitation and switching 
frequency to the linearity and efficiency of the overall ET-
PA system. The discrete SM is paired with a SiGe PA in 
Section III to compare the performances between the stand-
alone PA (i.e., the fixed supply PA) and the ET-PA. The 
measurement data verifies that our design approach of the 
SM is suitable for high PAR wideband applications.  
As the expansion to the work [1], we will present our 
fully monolithic BiCMOS ET-PA in Section IV. A CMOS 
SM will be integrated with the cascode SiGe PA in a 0.35 
µm SiGe BiCMOS technology to form a fully monolithic 
ET-PA system. In contrast to the discrete solution described 
in Section II, the single-chip ET-PA integration solution has 
several benefits: (1) it reduces cost; (2) it has an integrated 
signal path providing better signal integrity [11], and (3) 
from the design perspective, the PA and the SM can be 
optimized together to achieve better linearity and overall 
efficiency. Unlike common emitter PAs, our cascode PA 
structure relieves the voltage stress on the power transistor, 
while also requires some special envelope shaping function 
to improve its linearity at the ET operation. In Section IV, 
we will first highlight the self-biasing structure of our 
cascode PA design and our proposed envelope shaping 
method based on [3]. Moreover, we will analyze the power

considerably, which often defeats the purpose of using 
switching regulators for any supply-modulated PAs.  
Many recent reports on the wideband SM design for ET-
PA have combined the advantages of a wideband linear 
regulator and a high efficiency switching converter in 
various ways [1]-[17]. Fig. 3 shows the simulated envelope 
spectra of WiMAX 8.75 MHz and 20 MHz signals (PAR of 
~10.2 dB). An important characteristic of the envelope 
spectrum is that ~80% of envelope power resides from DC 
to several kHz, while over 99% of the envelope power 
resides within DC to 8MHz for the 8.75 MHz signal, and 
within DC to 20 MHz for the 20 MHz signal, respectively. 
Such a characteristic of the envelope spectrum implies that a 
hybrid switching structure can achieve a good balance 
between efficiency and bandwidth tracking for an ET-PA 
system. The hybrid switching SM consists of a wideband 
but low efficiency linear stage and a high efficiency 
narrowband switching stage. The hybrid structure lessens 
the requirements of the switching stage, since the fast 
transients of the envelope signal are taken care of by the 
wideband linear stage, while the switching stage handles the 
DC and slow moving signals with high efficiency. The 
overall efficiency of the entire SM (ηSM) is a combination of 
the switching stage efficiency (ηSW) and the linear stage 
efficiency (ηlin), as expressed by:

where α is the ratio of the output power from the switching 
stage to the total output power of the SM [7], [16]. 
2) Discrete Supply Modulator Design 
The hybrid switching SM is implemented by using 
commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) components to investigate 
the overall efficiency and linearity trade-off for an ET-PA 
system. Fig. 4 shows the circuit implementation of the 
discrete SM using an operational amplifier (Op-Amp) as the 
linear stage, and a buck converter as the switching stage. 
The buck converter supplies the slow slew-rate load current 
(ISW) that contributes to the majority of the load current 
(Iload) to ensure high efficiency, while the wideband linear 
Op-Amp stage operates in a feedback mode to track the high 
slew-rate current (Ilin). Additionally, the ripples caused by 
the buck converter will be attenuated and/or filtered by the 
linear Op-Amp. The smooth transition between the linear 
stage and the switching stage is realized by a hysteretic 
current feedback control. The hysteretic current feedback 
control consists of a current sensing resistor Rsense that 
senses the output current of the linear stage and a hysteresis 
comparator to control the buck converter. The value of the 
sensing resistor Rsense is chosen to be 1 Ω in this case, as it 
needs to be much smaller than Rload (i.e., the load impedance 
presented by the PA) to achieve high efficiency. 
C. Efficient and Linearity of the Hybrid Switching SM 
Although there are many reports on the efficiency of the 
SM in the literature [7]-[13], the effects of its bandwidth and 
switching frequency have not been studied as rigorously. 
Since the switching ripples (generated by high switching 
frequencies) and the bandwidth limitation are two major 
factors that cause distortions at the SM output, understanding 
their effects helps to optimize both efficiency and linearity of 
an overall ET-PA system. In this section, the nonlinearities 
of a discrete hybrid switching SM will be discussed.  
1) Bandwidth of the Hybrid Switching SM 
The linear stage (i.e., the Op-Amp) should have sufficient 
bandwidth not only to track the high frequency contents of 
the envelope signal with high fidelity as suggested by 
previous works [7]-[13], but also to suppress the switching 
ripples/noise generated from the switch converter. The 
switching ripples beyond the bandwidth of the linear stage 
can distort the envelope signal, and also be mixed with the 
modulated carrier in the PA to cause large spurious noise at 
the PA output, potentially degrading the system linearity.  
To investigate the effect of the bandwidth, an Op-Amp 
behavior model provided by Agilent’s ADS is used to 
replace the realistic Op-Amp model in the simulation, so that 
its bandwidth can be changed manually. The realistic SPICE 
models are still used for other blocks of the SM. Fig. 5 shows

the simulated current and voltage waveforms of the SM 
using different 1-dB bandwidths of the Op-Amp at an input 
wave of 1.25+sin(2π·200kHz·t) V. Note we found the 1-dB 
bandwidth of the Op-Amp is more sensitive and correlates 
considerably better to the output signal fidelity of the ET-PA 
than the more conventional 3-dB bandwidth. As shown in 
Fig. 5(A), (C) and (E), the output current of the switching 
stage (ISW) has large ripples on the waveforms, which need 
to be suppressed or cancelled by the output current of the 
linear stage (Ilin) to reproduce an accurate load current 
waveform (Iload). When the 1-dB bandwidth of the Op-Amp 
is set as 0.2 MHz, the output voltage (Vout) of the SM 
exhibits not only the switching ripples but also with some 
attenuation (Fig. 5(B)). When the 1-dB bandwidth is 
increased to 2 MHz, the Vout follows the input voltage (Vin) 
without attenuation, but the switching ripples still cannot be 
effectively suppressed (Fig. 5(D)). Furthermore, once the 1-
dB bandwidth is increased to 8 MHz, the Vout follows the Vin 
with high fidelity and negligible ripples (Fig. 5(F)). 
To further demonstrate the importance of having a 
wideband linear stage in the SM to meet the stringent 
linearity specs, the entire ET-PA using the monolithic SiGe 
PA is simulated with the RF/analog/digital co-simulation 
bench in ADS. The behavior model is used for the Op-Amp, 
while the realistic SPICE models are used for the PA and the 
other blocks of the SM. The inductor (L) of the buck 
converter is chosen around 40 µH here. The effect of the 
value of L on the SM design will be discussed in the next 
section. The simulated output error-vector-magnitude (EVM) 
of the ET-PA against different 1-dB bandwidths of the Op-
Amp are plotted in Fig. 6 for the WiMAX 64QAM 8.75 
MHz. As shown in Fig. 6, the EVM values of the ET-PA 
decrease as the 1-dB bandwidth of the Op-Amp increases, 
and become saturated to ~1.8% after the 1-dB bandwidth of 
the Op-Amp becomes larger than 18 MHz. Fig. 7 shows the 
simulated output spectra of the ET-PA with different 
bandwidths of the Op-Amp. There is a large improvement on 
the adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) when the 1-dB 
bandwidth of the Op-Amp increases from 8 MHz to 18 
MHz, enabling the output spectrum passing the stringent 
WiMAX spectral mask specs. As indicated by Figs. 6-7, the 
required bandwidth of the SM needs to be at least 2x of the 
original signal bandwidth, while sufficiently suppressing the 
switching ripples.  
2) Switching Frequency of the Supply Modulator 
The average switching frequency of the SM shown in 
Fig. 4 is well analyzed in [7] and can be expressed as [6]:

where Vdc and Vrms are the average and root-mean-square 
voltages of the output envelope signal, respectively; h is the 
hysteresis voltage of the comparator. In this design, the 
comparator LMV7219 has a pre-determined internal 
hysteresis h of 7-10 mV according to the data sheet and the 
SPICE simulations. Therefore, according to (3) the average 
switching frequency can now be mainly controlled by the 
value of L. The drawback of using a rather small L is that it 
usually generates more switching ripples at high frequencies, 
making the design of the linear stage more challenging [17]. 
Fig. 8 shows the SPICE simulated waveforms and 
spectra of the SM designed using two different values of L 
with an input waveform of 1.25+ sin(2π·500kHz·t) V. This 
time, the realistic SPICE models are used for all blocks of 
the SM simulations. The switching current Isw supplies both 
DC and AC components of the load current (Iload) by using 
an L of 4.7 µH; a higher switching frequency and large 
switching ripples on the waveform of Isw can be observed 
from Fig. 8(A). Such large switching ripples need to be 
largely suppressed or cancelled by the output current of the 
linear Op-Amp (Ilin), which can be clearly shown by the 
spectra of Isw and Iload in Figs. 8(E) and (G). On the other 
hand, for the case of L= 68 µH, Isw supplies only the DC 
component of Iload, while the AC component is taken care of 
by the linear Op-Amp, as shown in Fig. 8(B). Also, the 
spectra of Isw and Iload for the case of L= 68 µH have smaller 
harmonics than those using L= 4.7 µH. These simulation 
results indicate that the optimal L should be selected for not 
purely the highest efficiency, but also for the sufficient ripple 
suppression based on the limited bandwidth of the Op-Amp. 
Fig. 9 shows the SPICE simulated efficiency of the SM 
and the EVM of the ET-PA using the SiGe PA (see Fig. 1). 
The realistic SPICE models are used for the SiGe PA and all 
blocks of the SM. From the pure view point of efficiency, the 
optimal L is 8.2 μH for the best efficiency. Smaller L results

in higher switching frequency and significant switching loss. 
In addition, the EVM degrades with smaller L due to higher 
switching ripples. On the other hand, larger L makes the 
buck converter only able to supply the DC component of the 
load current, and in such a case the lower efficiency Op-Amp 
has to deliver the remaining AC contents (as illustrated in 
Fig. 8 (B)), leading to lower SM efficiency and thus lower 
overall efficiency of the ET-PA. A rather large L also causes 
high parasitic resistance to decrease its efficiency. Fig. 10 
shows the SPICE simulated output spectra of the ET-PA 
using L of 8.2 µH and L of 27 µH, respectively. When the 
larger L (27 µH) is chosen, the ACPR is 4-6 dB better at the 
offset of 5-8 MHz from the center frequency with only ~2% 
lower efficiency (see Fig. 9). 
Figs. 9-10 indicate that a small efficiency improvement 
may not be worthwhile if the linearity of the overall ET-PA 
has to be sacrificed. Therefore, the L of 27 μH is chosen in 
the design for our SM to achieve the best trade-off between 
efficiency and linearity. Fig. 11 shows the measured SM 
efficiency for different bandwidths of the WiMAX 64QAM 
signals. The SM efficiency only reduces by 2.5% when the 
signal bandwidth is increased from 1.5 MHz to 20 MHz. 
When the output current is low, the inductor may be 
completely discharged at the “OFF” state of the buck 
converter before the switcher is turned on again, which is 
often called as the “discontinuous mode” for DC-DC 
converter design [25]. Therefore, another concern in the 
selection of the inductor value is to ensure the buck converter 
does not go into the discontinuous mode operation [25]. The 
boundary of the discontinuous mode occurs at where the 
output DC current (Io) equals to one half of the peak-to-peak 
inductor ramp current ΔI (i.e., 0.5ΔI = Io). For the stand-
alone buck converter controlled by the conventional pulse-
width modulation (PWM) scheme, the minimal L should be 
determined to avoid the discontinuous mode at the minimum 
DC output current (Io,min) as [25].

where Vout,DC is the output DC voltage, D is the duty cycle, 
and fSW is the switching frequency determined by the PWM 
control scheme. For example, if the SM were to be 
implemented using the conventional PWM control scheme 
for this ET-PA, one could obtain the Vout,DC = 2.3 V, Io,min = 
33 mA (i.e., at Rload = 70 Ω presented by the SiGe PA as 
shown in Fig. 2). Therefore, the minimal inductor value 
calculated based on (4) would be ~16 µH for a PWM-
controlled buck-converter, assuming fSW =1 MHz. 
For the hybrid switching SM in this work, the peak-to-
peak inductor ramp current ΔI is limited under 2h/Rsense, 
which is not related with the inductor value [7]. This is 
because once the switching current ISW is h/Rsense lower than 
the load current Iload, the hysteresis comparator will 
immediately sense the current difference and turn on the 
switcher again, assuming the switcher can response fast 
enough [7]. In the practical SM design, however, the 
switcher is not ideal due to its intrinsic gate capacitance and 
resistance, therefore it may not respond fast enough with a 
high switching frequency, and this frequency is directly 
determined by the inductor value. In addition, the hysteresis 
window h increases with higher input slew rate [26]. The 
SPICE simulations show that h is ~ 7 mV with the input 
voltage ramp below 0.2 V/µs, but increases to ~ 43 mV with

simulation, the minimal L is 1.2 µH to avoid the

III. 
COMPARISON OF ET-PA AND STAND-ALONE PA 
A. Efficiency and Linearity of the Stand-Alone PA 
First, the stand-alone SiGe PA with fixed-supply voltage 
is tested to serve as a reference for the comparison with the 
ET-PA. Fig. 13 shows the measured gain, PAE and EVM vs. 
Pout for the WiMAX 64QAM 8.75 MHz signal (PAR = 10.5 
dB) at 2.3 GHz. The PAE of the SiGe PA reached 39% at the 
Pout of 17.8 dBm, but with a rather high output EVM of 
11.7% (the EVM spec of WiMAX 64QAM is 5.0% or -26 
dB). At Pout of 16 dBm, the stand-alone PA already violates 
the lenient EVM spec. Increasing VCC could reduce the EVM 
as shown in Fig. 14, but at the cost of lower efficiency.  
B. Efficiency and Linearity of the ET-PA 
The discrete SM discussed earlier is used to modulate the 
supply voltage (VCC) of the PA to form an ET-PA. No DPD 
is used in the measurement. The ET-PA operates at VDD of 
4.2 V. Fig. 15 shows the measured EVM, gain and overall 
PAE of the ET-PA. The overall PAE (or the composite PAE) 
of the ET-PA includes the power consumption of the SM. 
The overall PAE of the ET-PA is 30.5% at Pout of 17 dBm 
with an EVM of 4.4%. Fig. 16 shows the output spectra of 
the ET-PA and the stand-alone PA with a fixed supply. At 
Pout of 17 dBm, the ET-PA passes the stringent WiMAX 
64QAM mask, while the fixed-supply PA fails the spectral

AM-AM and AM-PM distortions can be diminished by using 
the proposed self-biased PA with the envelope shifting. 
Following the same procedure as Section II, Fig. 21 
shows the measured PAE against Pout of the self-biased 
cascode PA at various VCC in the CW mode. As the VCC is 
modulated from 1.8 V to 4.2 V, the PAE of the ET-PA varies 
between 53% and 61%. The Rload presented by the self-
biased cascode PA stays constantly at ~20 Ω, when VCC is 
swept from 1.8 V to 4.2 V. The value of Rload is important for 
the analysis of the power losses for the SM. 
B. Integrated CMOS Supply Modulator 
Fig. 22 shows the simplified block diagram of the CMOS 
SM integrated with the cascode SiGe PA. The SM was 
designed in the TSMC 0.35 μm BiCMOS process, but no 
bipolar devices were used. The SM utilizes the same hybrid 
switching structure as described in Section II. Although the 
same SM was presented in [3], [4], its power dissipation has 
not been discussed in details. In this paper, with our special 
envelope shaping function and cascode self-biasing PA, we 
will discuss how our SM can achieve high efficiency with a 
relatively low average switching frequency.  
1) Linear Stage of the Supply Modulator 
The linear stage uses a folded cascode amplifier with 
gain-boosting to meet the slew-rate requirement of the LTE 
and WiMAX envelope signals [3]. The output stage of the 
Op-Amp has a common source structure biased at the class-
AB mode for a good compromise between distortion and 
quiescent power dissipation [3]. The efficiency of the class-
AB output stage is the key for achieving high efficiency of 
the linear stage. Since all the DC current is supplied by the 
switching stage, the loss of the class-AB stage is almost zero 
at the DC level of the output signal. When the output 
transistors (M1 and M2) begin to source or sink current, the 
voltage across them will cause power loss, expressed as: 
ܲ௣ெைௌ ൌ ሺܫ௟௢௔ௗ െܫௌௐሻ ∙ ሺܸ஽஽ െ ܸ௢௨௧ሻ 
(5) 
ܲ௡ெைௌ ൌ ሺܫௌௐ െܫ௟௢௔ௗሻ ∙ ܸ௢௨௧ 
 
(6) 
Fig. 23 (A-D) shows the current and voltage waveforms 
of the supply modulator with and without the envelope 
shifting for the LTE 16QAM 5 MHz signal. When the load 
current (Iload) is higher than ISW, the pMOS device (M1) of 
the class-AB stage sources the current; and when Iload is 
lower than ISW, the nMOS device (M2) of the class-AB stage 
sinks the current. The instantaneous power losses from M1 
and M2 against the output voltage (Vout) can be clearly seen 
from Fig. 23 (E) and (F). The average power loss from M1 is 
reduced from 38 mW to 17 mW by using the envelope 
shifting technique, while the average power losses from M2 
are very close in both cases. According to (5), the envelope 
shifting mainly reduces the power loss from M1 for the 
class-AB stage, because it pushes Vout closer to VDD (i.e., 
VDD–Vout becomes smaller as shown in Fig. 23 (B)). On the 
other hand, even though Vout becomes higher with the 
envelope shifting method, the linear stage sinks less current 
than the case without envelope shifting (see the comparison 
between Fig. 23 (C) and (D)). This helps to maintain the 
power loss from M2 roughly the same as the case without 
using envelope shifting. 
2) Switching Stage of the Supply modulator 
In this cascode ET-PA system, the envelope shifting 
method reduces the AC magnitude of the envelope signal, 
while raising its DC content (see Fig. 19). Therefore, the 
switching stage supplies more current to the load than the 
case without envelope shifting, and its efficiency becomes 
more dominant to the overall efficiency of the supply 
modulator. It is well-known that there are at least two main 
mechanisms of power loss in the switching stage: (1) 
conduction loss; and (2) switching loss. The MOSFET 
switchers need to be sized for the minimal total power loss 
(i.e., the conduction loss plus the switching loss). The 
conduction loss is caused by the on-resistance of the 
switching FETs when they are conducting, expressed as [11]

where D is the average duty cycle of the switching pulses, 
ISW is the average output current of the buck converter, Ron,p 
is the on-resistance of the pMOS switcher, and Ron,n is the 
on-resistance of the nMOS switcher. The conduction loss is 
not dependent on the switching frequency and is inversely 
proportional to the device width. In the design of this 
integrated CMOS supply modulator, the sizes of pMOS and 
nMOS of the buck converter are chosen as 20 mm × 0.4 μm 
and 7 mm × 0.4 μm, respectively. According to the SPICE 
simulation, Ron,p and Ron,n are ~0.26 Ω and ~0.27 Ω, 
respectively. The ISW is 140 mA when driving the Rload of 20 
Ω presented by the PA. Therefore, the conduction loss of the 
buck converter is ~10.5 mW according to (7).  
The switching loss is caused from the simultaneous 
current and voltage overlap during the device on/off time 
(i.e., called crossover loss in [11]), as well as the loss due to 
its input and output capacitances during switching [7], [9], 
[11]. The crossover loss can be minimized by adding a delay 
at the gate of the nMOS as the work in [9] (see Fig. 22). 
Once the crossover loss is minimized, the switching loss can 
be expressed as [11]:

where Cd is the total drain capacitance, Cg is the total gate 
capacitance, fSW is the average switching frequency, Vdmax is 
the high level voltage at the drain (i.e., 4.2 V), and Vg is the 
turn-on voltage of the MOSFET switchers (i.e., 4.2 V). The 
switching loss is related to both the device width and the 
switching frequency. A smaller device width can have 
smaller gate and drain capacitances, but causing higher 
conduction loss due to its higher on-resistance. For the 
selected MOSFET switchers, the total drain capacitance and

maximum linear Pout is 24 dBm with an overall PAE of 41% 
for the LTE 5 MHz signal. In order to achieve the same 
EVM for the LTE 10 MHz signal, the maximum linear Pout 
needs to be 0.6 dB lower than the case of LTE 5 MHz, 
resulting in an overall PAE of 38% at Pout of 23.4 dBm. 
When the ET-PA is backed off 0.5 dB from the maximum 
linear Pout levels, better EVMs of 3.6% and 3.7% can be 
achieved with overall PAEs of 39% and 37% for the LTE 
16QAM 5 MHz and 10 MHz signals, respectively.  
The output spectra of the ET-PA and the stand-alone 
fixed supply PA (VCC = 4.2 V) are plotted in Fig. 26. The 
ET-PA successfully passes the LTE spectral mask at Pout of 
24 dBm. However, at the same Pout of 24 dBm, the stand-
alone fixed-supply PA fails the LTE spectral mask, forcing it 
to be backed off by at least 4 dB. The maximum linear Pout of 
the stand-alone PA is, therefore, only 20 dBm with a PAE of 
29%. The linear Pout and PAE are thus 4 dB and 12% lower 
than those achieved by the ET-PA, respectively. Fig. 27 plots 
the far-out output spectra of the ET-PA and the stand-alone 
PA measured without any external filtering. Compared with 
the stand-alone PA, the ET-PA has little spectral regrowth at 
the offset of 20-30 MHz from the center frequency, but no 
strong spur appears at the offset frequency above 50 MHz. 
Such a spurious emission performance was achieved due to 
the low average switching frequency of the SM. To further 
demonstrate the advantages of the ET-PA, Fig. 28 compares 
the measured EVM of the ET-PA and the stand-alone PA 
against the PAE values. The ET-PA has a better EVM with 
the same PAE. Table I provides the performance summary of 
our fully monolithic ET-PA together with the state-of-the-art 
results.  
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
The complete design path towards our fully monolithic 
BiCMOS ET-PA has been presented. A discrete hybrid 
switching SM was first implemented to study the effects of 
its switching frequency and bandwidth limitation to the 
overall ET performance. The same circuit configuration was 
used to design our CMOS SM integrated with the self-
biased cascode SiGe PA under our proposed envelope 
shaping function. By analyzing the power losses of the 
CMOS SM for our special ET operation, we showed that 
high efficiency can still be achieved with a relatively low 
average switching frequency, which helped to improve the 
overall ET linearity. At 1.9 GHz, our BiCMOS ET-PA 
achieved 24/23.4 dBm with the overall PAE of 41%/38% 
for the LTE 16QAM 5/10 MHz signals, respectively. The 
EVM below 5% and the LTE spectral mask were both 
satisfied without any need of DPD techniques. The literature 
survey indicates that our design achieved one of the highest 
efficiency for Si-based ET PAs, approaching those III-V 
semiconductor PAs for broadband mobile applications.
