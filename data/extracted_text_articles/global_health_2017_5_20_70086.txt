Abstract— The Middle East is a place where breastfeeding is
both culturally recommended and socioeconomically needed.
The objective of this article was to quantify the research
activity about breastfeeding (BF) in the Middle East over the
last 10 years. A PubMed search was conducted using medical
subject headings and author affiliation to retrieve research
articles published from the Middle East between 2007 and
2017 (inclusive). Middle Eastern countries produced only 5%
of the total number of BF research articles in the world, with
Turkey and Iran ranking at the top of the list. Among the 15
Arab countries probed, Qatar ranked first in the number of
BF publications per million people (PMP) averaging 6.61 PMP,
while Yemen ranked 15th with the least number of 0.10 PMP.
On
the
other
hand,
Iran
ranked
first
with
39.93
BF
publications per USD$1000 Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
per capita, Turkey ranked second with 24.19 publications per
USD$1000 GDP per capita, while Bahrain ranked 15th with
only 0.44 publications per USD$1000 per GDP per capita.
Although the topic poses as both a religious – cultural –
recommendation and a socioeconomic necessity, research
activity about BF in the Middle East still lags behind developed
countries. Greater productivity levels are expected to emerge
to accompany the recent significant investment in research in
the Arab world in general, and the Gulf countries in
particular.

I.
INTRODUCTION
Natural mother’s milk has been shown to be a basic and
important primary nutritional source for a baby [1, 2]. All
while
meeting
the
physiological
needs
of
the
baby,
breastfeeding is thought to support the psychological
development of the neonate through the mother-infant tie
[3]. Breastfeeding is a phenomenon that has cultural, social,
and spiritual dimensions, very much related to religious
doctrines [4].
The recommendations put forth by the World Health
Organization (WHO) state that babies should be fed with
breast milk for at least two years, with breast milk being the
only nutritional supply for the first six months of neonatal
age, then additional supplements thereafter [5].
Although
the aforementioned recommendations resonate well with the
cultural and religious paradigms, only 49% of babies born in
2011 were found to have been breastfed to the age of 6
months, and a fractional 27% to the age of one year [6]. It
has also been noticed that the average span of breastfeeding
is shorter in richer countries, compared to longer durations in
societies with lower incomes [7]. In a study on breastfeeding in
United Arab Emirates, a total of 98% of 593 Emirati mothers
included in the study initiated breastfeeding and the mean
duration of breastfeeding was 8.6 months [8] while it was 52.3%
in Hafr Al Batin city in Saudi Arabia [9].
Globally, a lot of research has been done on breastfeeding,
from protein interactions and biomedical effects [10]-[12], to
maintenance
and
weaning
strategies
[13]-[16],
to
the
psychological underpinning of pre- and post-natal phases [17], to
the behavioral development of the neonate [18]. This is
particularly
related
to
the
variety
of
interests
different
researchers have on the topic.
Bibliometric studies have been used to analyze and interpret
pertinent trends in medical practice, as well as the evolution of
research behavior [19]. The purpose of this report is to probe the
trends in published breastfeeding research in the Middle Eastern
Arab (MEA) countries. In particular, the purpose of this report is
to: (1) Describe trends in number of breastfeeding publications
produced by the MEA countries, and (2) inspect the abundance
of publications produced by different universities within the
MEA countries.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2
describes the methodology used in the research. Section 3
displays the results obtained. Section 4 discusses the results, and
finally, Section 5 gives some conclusions.
II. METHODOLOGY
Papers on “breastfeeding” published between 2007 and 2017
in the Middle East were collected from the data-base website
PubMed (available from the National Institutes of Health) during
September 2017.
In the following bibliometric analysis, PubMed filters were
customized to include the following types of articles: case
reports; clinical conference; clinical trial; clinical trial, phase I;
clinical trial, phase II; clinical trial, phase III; Clinical study;
comparative
study;
Consensus
Development
Conference;
controlled clinical trial; journal article; letter; meta-analysis;
multicenter study; randomized controlled trial; review; Scientific
integrity review; systematic reviews; validation studies.
As this research is constricted to the Middle East region, the
following 15 countries were investigated: Bahrain; Egypt; Iraq;
Jordan; Kuwait; Lebanon; Oman; Palestine; Qatar; Saudi Arabia;
Syria; United Arab Emirates; and Yemen. Iran and Turkey were

included
for
comparison
as
the
closest
non-Arab
neighboring countries.
To search for the specific publications by topic and
country, we applied Medical subject headings (MeSH): the
National Library of Medicine (NLM) controlled vocabulary
thesaurus used for indexing articles for PubMed. The results
were collected by applying the Boolean searching technique
(a type of search allowing users to combine keywords with
operators (or modifiers) such as AND, NOT and OR to
further
produce
more
relevant
results.
For
example,
searching for publications on breastfeeding in Lebanon
would look like this: “Breastfeeding” AND “Lebanon.”
III. RESULTS
A.
Data Filtering
Thirteen thousand nine hundred seventy-five “13975”
breastfeeding papers were retrieved from PubMed between
2007 and 2017. Seven hundred twenty-seven “727” (5.2 %)
were published from the Middle-Eastern countries. Turkey
with 261 publications (35.9 %) ranked first in the Middle
East, and along with Iran 198 publications (27.2 %), which
ranked
second,
contributed
around
two-thirds
of
publications (Table I).
B.
Data Processing
For
technical
purposes
and
a
more
advanced
comparison, the number of publications was corrected by
means of population size (Table II) and Growth Domestic
Product (GDP) (see Table III). This was made possible by
dividing the number of publications retrieved by the population
size of each country (population size according to the data of the
World
Bank)
and
by
the
USD$1000
GDP
per
capita,
respectively.
IV. DISCUSSION
Although breastfeeding is considered a social and religious
mandate [4], as well as – at times – an economic need [7], in
most
of
the
developing
countries,
scientific
research
to
corroborate the benefits of such a natural phenomenon seems to
be still lacking in most of these countries.
The results obtained (Figure 1) are hardly considered eligible
for fair comparison; this is due to the vast differences in the
population size and economic backgrounds of the countries in
question.
For the statistical imperfections listed above, and to get rid of
the errors associated with population size, we corrected our
results by dividing the number of breastfeeding publications by
the population size in millions (Figure 2) [20]. For example:
United Arab Emirates have 23 breastfeeding publications within
the last 10 years, the population size of this country is 9.27
million, dividing 23 by 9.27 will give us (2.48) publications per
million. Applying this formula to the 15 Middle Eastern
countries yielded the results shown in Table II and Figure 2.
Qatar ranked first with 6.61 publications per million, Lebanon
ranked second with 4.66 publications per million, while Yemen
ranked 15th with the least number of publications 0.10 per
million.

To eliminate the economical factor, another correction
was introduced; this was made possible by correcting the
results with the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita
[20]. Dividing the number of breastfeeding publications by the
USD$1000 GDP per capita for each Middle Eastern country
yielded the results shown in Figure 3. Iran ranked first with
39.93 breastfeeding Publications per USD$1000 GDP per capita,
Turkey ranked second with 24.19 publications per USD$1000
GDP per capita, while Bahrain ranked 15th with only 0.44
publications per USD$1000 per GDP per capita. Moreover, the
number of universities in the country was taken as another factor
that may affect the number of publications, so we calculated the
ration of publications to numbers of universities. The results
showed that Qatar ranked first followed by Turkey then Jordan
while Bahrain was at the end of the list with only 0.067
publications per university (Figure 4). Here, it is worth noting
that the various rates obtained are the accumulated averages over
the last ten years, and are not presented as per individual years.
V. CONCLUSIONS
At the present time, most of the Middle Eastern Arab
countries are lagging behind in terms of research outcomes, in
general, and breastfeeding research, in particular. While Jordan
and Lebanon show some promises in terms of the publication
size with respect to the population size, other high GDP
countries – the Gulf States for example – are not investing in this
type of research as much as some much poorer countries, like
Palestine and Yemen. It also appeared that more effort is needed
to encourage universities to be involved in such types of
research especially for their significant role in leading research
activities in their countries. More probes into the growth rate of
this research over the last decade will give insights into the
trends taken by researchers in this part of the world.
