Abstract – The maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) algo-
rithm has recently been implemented in Boolean logic circuits 
(MAP in LC) and presented as an additional method for soft-
decision decoding of maximum-transition-run (MTR) codes. 
Substantial benefits were noticed when the MAP in LC method 
was used for decoding in an MTR encoded one-track one-head 
E2PR4 magnetic recording channel. Those benefits reveal the 
great potential of possible employment of MTR codes in itera-
tive decoding schemes. Having in mind that MTR codes are 
able to reduce the overall complexity of trellis channel detec-
tion, their utilization in magnetic recording systems with mul-
tiple-tracks multiple-heads could be valuable. In this paper, 
the performance of the MAP in LC decoding was considered in 
the in-track MTR encoded two-track two-head E2PR4 channel. 
The subversion named as max-log MAP in LC is presented and 
compared with min-max in LC and max-log MAP approach for 
MTR decoding. In case of the low-level inter-track interference 
over the recording channel, the max-log MAP in LC subver-
sion shows nearly 1 dB of decoding gain, for BER = 10-5, when 
rate 4/5 (2, 8) MTR was used.

 INTRODUCTION  
Utilization of maximum transition run (MTR) codes [1] 
as a constrained code for magnetic recording channels, espe-
cially in the case of the extended class four partial response 
channel (E2PR4) [2], has shown to be quite beneficial [3]. 
The MTR codes increases the minimum squared Euclidean 
distance by preventing the ±[+1 –1 +1] error-event, which is 
dominant at some densities [4]. Consequently, in the case of 
the two-track two-head E2PR4 channel model, the MTR em-
ployment resulted in 23% of reduction in the number of de-
tection trellis states, and nearly 42% of reduction in the over-
all channel detection complexity [3]. 
Even though MTR codes appear to be valuable as con-
strained codes, it should be emphasized that they possess just 
a modest error correcting ability. Thus, they have to be used 
in combination with some proven and powerful error correct-
ing codes, such as the low-density parity-check (LDPC) [5]. 
Several different approaches had been presented, ranging 
from the enforcement of MTR constraint into LDPC encod-
ing [6], to the straightforward serial concatenation of LDPC 
and MTR codes [7], [8]. In all of these instances, the MTR 
decoding has to be based on a soft-decision approach, so that 
the corresponding decoder is able to handle soft-values [9], 
and to produce decision confidence.  
In order for them to be implemented in a modern frame-
work of iterative decoding, MTR codes require soft-decision 
decoding techniques. As a result, this fact encouraged devel-
opment of several different techniques, such as min-max in 
LC method [7], [8], and the MAP approach [10], [11].  
Recently, an additional approach was presented, entitled 
MAP in LC method, which implements the MAP algorithm 
into Boolean logic circuits [12], [13]. Utilization of the MAP 
in LC method offers considerable decoding gain and overall 
decoding complexity reduction, in case of the MTR encoding 
over a one-track E2PR4 magnetic recording channel [7], [8].  
In this paper, an extension was made with MAP in LC 
utilization in magnetic recording systems that use the multi-
ple-track multiple-head approach for data storage [3], [14].  
This paper is organized in such a manner that Section II 
presents an overview of min-max in LC and max-log MAP 
algorithm for soft-decision decoding of MTR codes. Section 
III demonstrates complexity analyses of the MAP decoder, 
while Section IV explains the MTR encoding over the E2PR4 
two-track channel. Section V offers results of the simulations 
and performance comparisons, while Section VI gives the 
conclusion to this paper.

MTR SOFT-DECISION DECODING METHODS 
This section presents a brief and simple overview of two 
previously presented methods, the min-max in LC [7], [8], 
and max-log MAP approach [10], [11]. In addition, this sec-
tion is intended to reintroduce notation that will be used in 
further analyses and explanation of the MAP in LC. 
A. Soft-values and Soft-decision Concept 
The soft-value of binary variable x is defined as 
 

0),
(
/)1
(
log
( )



P x
P x
L x
 
(1) 
where log() function is a natural logarithm. The sign of L(x) 
is the binary decision, the so called hard-decision, while the 
magnitude of represents the confidence of this decision [9]. 
The MTR decoder should be able to handle input soft-
values and to produce subsequent soft-values on its outputs. 
B. min-max in LC Approach 
MTR codes can be easily realized using integrated circuit 
technology and Boolean logic circuits, as it was originally 
presented by Moon and Brickner [1].

Straightforward and low-cost implementation of the sim-
ple and well know rate 4/5 (2, 8) MTR code can be realized, 
as shown in Fig. 1 [1], [7], [8].

where min() and max() functions return minimal and maxi-
mal soft-values, of the input variables. 
By implementing such an approach, simple propagation 
of input soft-values can be realized through the newly cre-
ated circuits, enabling the min-max in LC soft-decision MTR 
decoding [7], [8]. 
The min-max in LC approach demonstrated excellent per-
formance, when it was used for soft-decision decoding of the 
MTR code that is combined with LDPC code, over a one-
track one-head [7], [8], as well as a multiple-track multiple-
head E2PR4 magnetic recording channel [3]. 
The min-max in LC decoding approach is primarily in-
tended for hardware realization of the MTR decoder, using 
integrated circuits technology.  
C. The MAP Approach 
MTR codes are simple block codes that basically perform 
mapping between two sets of sequences. With the defining

These subsets are shown in Table I, for 4/5 (2, 8) MTR 
code, and for output bit at position k = 2 [10], [11], [15],[16].

The Nbk subsetst subsets are pre-requested for the MAP al-
gorithm and they can be prepared in advance, so that the 
decoding process can be accelerated. 
 
a) The max-log MAP Subversion 
The main subversion of the MAP algorithm operates with 
probabilities qin 0(i) and qin 1(i) of input bit, at sequence posi-
tion i, which are obtained from (1) as

It can be observed that expression F(i) depends solely on 
input soft-values, and does not depend on codewords in sub-
sets Nbk subset. Thus, it can be extracted from the sum, when 
expression (7) is substituted in (8) [10], [11], [15], [16]. 
Moreover, the probabilities qout 0(k) and qout 1(k) will ap-
pear in output soft-value (1), the same as the difference of 
two log() functions, and, thus, it is possible to work with

Furthermore, decoder probabilities from (9), can be ex-
pressed in logarithmic form as

D. The MAP in LC Approach 
The conventional MAP approach considers MTR decod-
ing as simple sequence mapping, computing Lout(k), of par-
ticular bit k, using corresponding Nbk subsets. 
The Boolean logic circuits can be seen, also, as sequence 
translators and thus implementation of the MAP approach 
imposed in logical circuits seems rational. The idea is to try 
to embed the max-log MAP approach into decision logic of 
new circuits, and later to design a new MTR decoder with 
such redesigned logic circuits.  
 
a) The max-log MAP in LC for new AND circuit 
In case of the AND circuit, the mapping and the corre-
sponding MAP subsets are shown in Table II [12], [13].

It can be observed that the length of the input codeword 
is N = 2, while of the output word M = 1. In that sense, the 
max-log MAP in LC works with just a few elements in the 
corresponding subsets, and, most importantly, with short-
length codewords. 
According to (10), the max-log MAP in LC subversion

while the output soft-value is obtained similarly to (14). 
Via utilization of such redesigned circuits into hardware 
realization, as depicted in Fig. 1, the new soft-decision de-
coder for MTR decoding can be realized and, what is more, 
implemented in iterative decoding schemes.  
III. 
COMPLEXITY OF THE MAP DECODER 
The main problem with the MAP algorithm implementa-
tion lies in the potentially high number of codewords in the 
corresponding Nbk subsets [10], [11], [15], [16].  
The MAP decoding approach primarily leans towards 
implementation at the software level. Unfortunately, depend-
ing on the code rate of the used MTR code, the Nbk subsets can 
contain a considerable number of codewords that can unnec-
essarily slow down the decoder and the decoding process. 
A. Complexity of the max-log MAP Approach 
Considering general MTR code, with code rate R = M/N, 
it can be easily shown that max-log MAP subversion requires

assumed that addition has the same complexity as multiplica-
tion.  
Given that the both Nbk subsets contain the same number of 
codewords, each output of the max-log MAP decoder re-
quires the same number of operations. In case of the rate R = 
4/5 MTR code this number is

B. Complexity of the max-log MAP in LC Approach

AND and OR logic circuit, it can be seen that the required 
number of operations, in order to produce probabilities R0 
and R1, according to (13) and (15), is

This is the number of operations for the output of one re-
designed circuit (AND or OR circuit). Although, it should be 
kept in mind that if an MTR decoder is realized, as presented 
in Fig. 1, then the actual number of required operations for 
the decoder outputs, in case of the max-log MAP in LC, is

Such a result is quite valuable in the case of extensive 
decoder utilization and demanding signal processing. How-
ever, as the realization of the MTR decoder using logic cir-
cuits implies that some optimization techniques will be used 
to decrease the overall number of logic circuits, then the real 
percent of reduction in a number of operations can differ 
between realizations.  
However, an important result of analyses is that merging 
the MAP algorithm into Boolean logic circuits and working 
with the max-log MAP in LC will overcome the complexity 
of the original max-log MAP method. 
IV. 
MTR ENCODING OVER A TWO-TRACK CHANNEL 
Multiple-head arrays had been proposed to enable read-
ing and writing data at the same time on multiple tracks [14]. 
Such heads provide both high density and high speed [17], 
but they suffer from inter-track interference (ITI) [18]. The 
ITI is a result of a signal induced in reading heads as a su-
perposition of magnetic transitions in neighboring tracks. 
A. Channel Model 
This paper considers a simple two-track two-head E2PR4 
recording channel, where two independent tracks exist and 
the reading heads simultaneously detect signals from both 
tracks [18]. It is assumed that linear and symmetrical ITI is 
present and modeled with the following matrix 
 
,





 

(21) 
where ε  [0,1] represents the ITI level between tracks [18]. 
A coding scheme employs rate 4/5 (2, 8) MTR code [1], 
as an in-track constrained code, so that each track is inde-
pendently encoded, as shown in Fig. 3. 
 
Figure 3.  In-track MTR encoding over two-track channel. 
where i1, i2, y1 and y2 are in-track input and output sequences. 
Furthermore, it is assumed that read-back signals are dis-
torted with additive, white and zero-mean, Gaussian noise g 
and that signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is defined as

Channel detection was performed with the optimum two-

ITI estimation and the twenty symbols detection window [3], 
as shown in Fig. 4.

The ITI presence in the two-track channel model can be 
used to partially improve channel detector performance [18].  
It can be shown that knowing and incorporating ITI level 
into 2H-SOVA branch metric (23) considerably enhances the 
square Euclidian distance of two-track detector, regarding to 
independent in-track detection approach, as shown in Fig. 5 
[4], [18], [19], [20]. 
Utilization of the two-head detector that simultaneously 
reads data from both tracks can mitigate detector perform-
ance degradation encountered by ITI presence.  
The depicted square Euclidian distance demonstrates the 
advantage of two-head detector employment over an interfer-
ing channel. Over the range of ITI values

Euclidian distance gradually increases and a growth of about 
7.18% can be noticed, even though track interference is pre-
sent [18], [19], [20].  
This feature will help the two-head detector to success-
fully combat the low-level ITI in the interfering channel.

Figure 5.  Two-track two-head m.s.d. versus ITI. 
Regrettably, independent in-track detection is hindered 
by the ITI presence, degrading the performance of the one-
head detector [19], [20]. In such a detection approach, the 
one-head detector is unable to combat against ITI. This fact 
additionally suggests that a two-head detector is highly de-
sirable within interfering magnetic recording systems.

SIMULATION RESULTS  
This paper is intended to analyze only the performance of 
the proposed algorithms. Thus, the simulation scheme im-
plements only the MTR code, even though they possess a 
modest error correcting ability [1]. The paper focus is soft-
value propagation through the MTR decoder and the com-
plexity of the proposed algorithms. 
A. MTR Decoding Using min-max in LC Approach 
The min-max in LC was the first presented method for 
the MTR soft-decision decoding [7], [8]. In order to maintain 
consistency and to easily evaluate the MAP in LC method, 
the performances of soft-decision decoding using the min 
and max functions in logic circuits, are repeated in Fig. 6 [7], 
[8].

Figure 6.  MTR decoding using min-max in LC. 
The MTR is a single code implemented in an analyzed 
simulation scheme. Therefore, when the appropriate calcula-
tions are finished, the final decision is made in a binary way, 
even the MTR decoder internally operates with soft-values.  
It can be observed that utilizing the min-max in LC, the 
decoding gain is about 0.5 dB for BER = 10-5 and ITI level ε 
= 0.0. Moreover, an additional gain is present for ITI level of 
ε = 0.2, because of the enhancement of the squared Euclidian 
distance [19], [20].  
The min-max in LC method application outcome is iden-
tical to the performance achieved with the classical hard-
decision approach, but the reason behind this is the solitary 
role of the MTR decoder, and its inability to fully exploit the 
soft-values and the corresponding confidences. 
However, its advantage is that the MTR decoder is now 
able to handle soft-values, having performances not weaker 
than those obtained with conventional hard-decision [1].  
The capability of the MTR decoder to manage the soft-
values will become overt in an encoding scheme that uses 
combination of MTR and error-correcting codes [15], [16], 
e.g. in some of the iterative decoding schemes. 
B. MTR Decoding Using the Conventional MAP Approach 
The performance of the max-log MAP soft-decision de-
coding of MTR codes is presented in Fig. 7. 
BER
 
Figure 7.  MTR soft-decision decoding using max-log MAP. 
The max-log MAP approach shows a slightly inferior 
performance to that of hard-decision, but this slight differ-
ence is overshadowed by the fact that the hard-decision ap-
proach cannot produce output soft-values.  
The decoding gain is again around 0.5 dB for BER = 10-5 
and ε = 0.0, but for ITI level of ε = 0.2, the gain of nearly 1 
dB is obtained, for the same BER level.  
Such a result indicates that the approximation applied for 
output probabilities Rb(k) (10), does not hinder the perform-
ance of the max-log MAP method [10], [11], [15], [16]. 
C. Comparison of the MTR Decoding Approaches 
Finally, a comparison was made between the approaches 
for MTR soft-decision decoding over the E2PR4 two-track 
system. The performances are summarized in Fig. 8.

BER
 
Figure 8.  Approaches for MTR soft-decision decoding. 
It can be observed that logic circuits utilization, both with 
min-max functions or log-max MAP in LC, resulted in a de-
coding gain of around 0.5 dB for BER = 10-5 and ε = 0.0 and 
nearly 1 dB for of ε = 0.2 and the same BER level.  
Considering all presented simulation results, it can be ob-
served that the soft-decision approach has performances that 
are similar to or somewhat worse than the classical MTR 
hard-decision [1]. Unfortunately, the solitary position of the 
MTR decoder, in this simulation scheme, fails to offer ex-
ploitation of both decision confidence, and, consequently, the 
full benefits of soft-decision decoding. Therefore, it is to be 
expected that the real power of the analyzed approaches will 
be in some iterative simulation scheme and in combination 
with some of the error-correcting codes [15], [16]. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
This paper considers the concept of the max-log MAP in 
LC, as an additional method for MTR soft-decision decod-
ing, over the two-track E2PR4 magnetic recording channel. 
This method was compared to already presented MTR 
soft-decision approaches, suggesting that min-max in LC and 
max-log MAP in LC are simpler and more effective than 
regular max-log MAP, which works on the set of MTR code-
words. 
The low complexity of max-log MAP in LC decoder, as 
well as the fact that MTR codes can reduce the overall two-
track channel detection, suggests that their utilization and its 
soft-decision approaches would be quite valuable, especially 
in the case of interfering channels.  
In addition, simulation results suggest that the max-log 
MAP in LC method will additionally enable MTR code utili-
zation in the iterative decoding framework, and that will re-
sult in considerable gain when MTR is to be used in combi-
nation with some powerful error-correcting codes over chan-
nels for high magnetic recording densities.
