Abstract—Numerous studies have been conducted to analyze 
social media data in real time and to extract events occurring 
in the real world. A benefit of analysis using data with position 
information is that it can accurately extract an event from a 
target area to be analyzed. However, because data with 
position information are scarce among all social media data, 
the amount to analyze is insufficient for almost all areas: we 
cannot fully extract most events. Therefore, efficient analytical 
methods must be devised for accurate extraction of events 
with position information, even in areas with few data. For this 
study, we estimate the time of biological season observation in 
areas and sightseeing spots with interlinkage of tweet location 
information. Herein, we explain the analysis results obtained 
using information from interpolation and analysis of cherry 
blossoms in Japan in 2016.

 INTRODUCTION 
This paper is an extended version of earlier published 
work [1]. After improvement of our algorithm, this report 
describes more accurately estimated best times for viewing 
organisms at tourist spots using interlinking. 
In recent years, because of the wide dissemination and 
rapid performance improvement of various devices such as 
smart phones and tablets, diverse and vast data are generated 
on the web. Particularly, social networking services (SNSs) 
have become popular because users can post data and 
various messages easily. Twitter [2], an SNS that provides a 
micro-blogging 
service, 
is 
used 
as 
a 
real-time 
communication tool. Numerous tweets have been posted 
daily by vast numbers of users. Twitter is therefore a useful 
medium to obtain, from a large amount of information 
posted by many users, real-time information corresponding 
to the real world. 
Sightseeing has come to be regarded as an extremely 
important growth field in Japan for revival of its powerful 
economy [3]. Tourism, with its strong economic ripple 
effects, is expected to produce benefits from regional 
revitalization 
and 
employment 
opportunities 
by 
accommodating world tourism demand, including that from 
rapidly growing Asia. In addition, people around the world 
can discover and disseminate the charm of Japan and can 
promote mutual understanding with other countries. 
In addition to the promotion of tourism to Japan, the 
progress of domestic travel is important. A nation with 
modern tourism must build a community society that serves 
regional 
economies 
well, 
attracting 
tourists 
widely. 
Moreover, it is necessary to cultivate tourist areas full of 
individuality and to promote their charm positively. 
According to a survey reported in the Inbound Landing-
type Tourism Guide [4] by the Ministry of Economy, Trade 
and Industry (METI), tourists want real-time information and 
local unique seasonal information posted on websites. 
Current websites provide similar information in the form of 
guidebooks. Nevertheless, the information update frequency 
of that medium is low. Because each local government, 
tourism association, and travel company independently 
provides information about travel destination locales, it is 
difficult for tourists to collect information for “now” tourist 
spots. Therefore, providing current, useful, real-world 
information 
for 
travelers 
by 
capturing 
changes 
of 
information in accordance with the season and relevant time 
period of the tourism region is important for the travel 
industry. As described herein, we define "now" information 
as information that travelers require for tourism and disaster 
prevention such as best flower-viewing times, festivals, and 
local heavy rains. As one might expect, the period estimated 
for disaster prevention information would be an estimate of 
the “worst” time instead of the best time. 
We consider a method for estimating the best time for 
tourists to make phenological observations, such as the best 
time for viewing cherry blossoms and autumn leaves in 
various regions by particularly addressing phenological 
observations assumed for “now” in the real world. We define 
"now" as information for tourism and disaster prevention 
required by travelers during travel, such as the best flower-
viewing times, interesting festivals, and the likelihood of 
locally heavy rains. 
Tourist information for best times requires a peak period, 
which means that the best time is neither a period after or 
before falling flowers, but a period to view blooming flowers. 
Furthermore, the best times differ among regions and 
locations. Therefore, for each region and location, it is 
necessary to estimate the best time for phenological 
163

observations. Estimating best-time viewing periods requires 
the collection of large amounts of information having real-
time properties. For this study, we use Twitter data obtained 
from many users throughout Japan. We use Twitter, a typical 
microblogging service, and also use geotagged tweets that 
include position information sent in Japan to ascertain the 
best time (peak period) for biological season observation by 
region. We proposed a low-cost estimation method [5]. 
Using this method, prefectures and municipalities showing a 
certain number of tweets with geotags can be estimated with 
a relevance rate of about 80% compared to the flowering day 
/ full bloom day of cherry blossoms observed by the Japan 
Meteorological Agency. The geotagged tweets that are used 
with this method are useful as social indicators that reflect 
real-world circumstances. They are a useful resource 
supporting a real-time regional tourist information system in 
the tourism field. Therefore, our proposed method might be 
an effective means of estimating the best time to view events 
other than biological seasonal observations. 
However, to analyze the information of each region from 
Twitter data, it is necessary to specify the location from 
tweet information. Because geotagged tweets can identify 
places, they are effective for analysis. However, because 
geotagged tweets account for a very small proportion of the 
total information content of tweets, it is not possible to 
analyze all regions. For this research, we propose a method 
of estimating the best time by tourist spot by performing 
interlinkage using geo-tagged tweets. We conducted 
experiments to estimate the position around areas not 
identified by locations based on the amounts of regional 
information. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. 
Section II presents earlier research related to this topic. 
Section III describes our proposed method for estimating the 
best-time of phenological observation through interlinkage 
using regional amounts. Section IV describes experimentally 
obtained results obtained using our proposed method, along 
with a discussion of the results. Section V presents a 
summary of the contributions and future work. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
The amounts of digital data are expected to increase 
greatly in the future because of the spread of SNSs. 
Numerous reports describe studies of the effective use of 
these large amounts of digital data. Some studies use 
microblogs to conduct real-world understanding and 
prediction by analyzing information transmitted from 
microblogs. Kleinberg [6] describes detection of a "burst" of 
keywords signaling a rapid increase in time-series data. 
Sakaki et al. [7] explain their proposal of a method to detect 
events such as earthquakes and typhoons based on a study 
estimating real-time events from Twitter. Kaneko et al. [8] 
propose a method of detecting an event using geotagged non-
photo tweets and non-geotagged photo tweets, as well as 
geotagged photo tweets. Yamagata et al. [9] propose a real-
time urban climate monitoring method using geographically 
tagged tweets, demonstrating the effectiveness of tweets for 
urban risk management. Consequently, various methods for 
extracting event and location information have been 
discussed. Nevertheless, although event detection has been 
done in earlier studies, no discussion of the event validity 
period has been reported. As described herein, after 
proposing a method for extracting such information, we 
estimate “now” in relation to tourism information, such as 
the full bloom period of phonological observations. 
Additionally, we address an important difficulty related to 
geotagged content analysis: what amount of data is effective 
for an analyzed area? 
Next, along with rising SNS popularity, real-time 
information has increased. Analysis using real time data has 
become possible. Many studies have examined efficient 
methods for analyzing large amounts of digital data. Some 
studies have been conducted to predict real world 
phenomena using large amounts of social big data. 
Phithakkitnukoon et al. [10] analyze details of traveler 
behavior using data from mobile phone GPS location records 
such as departure place, destination, and traveling means on 
a personal level. Mislove et al. [11] develop a system that 
infers a Twitter user’s feelings from the tweet text and 
visualizes changes of emotion in space–time. After research 
to detect events such as earthquakes and typhoons, Sakaki et 
al. [7] propose a method to estimate real-time events from 
Twitter tweets. Cheng et al. [12] estimate Twitter users’ 
geographical positions at the time of their contributions, 
without the use of geotags, by devoting attention to the 
geographical locality of words from text information in 
Twitter posted articles. Although various studies have 
analyzed spatiotemporal data, research to estimate the 
viewing period using interlinkage is a new field.

OUR PROPOSED METHOD 
This section presents a description of an analytical 
method for target data collection. It presents best-time 
estimation to obtain a guide for phenological change from 
Twitter data in Japan. Our proposal is portrayed in Figure 1. 
 
 
Figure 1.  Our proposal. 
We describe the best-time estimation method of 
organisms by analysis using a moving average method for 
geotagged tweets that include organism names. The best-
time estimation in this paper is to estimate the period of time 
during which the creatures at the tourist spots are useful for 
sightseeing. Such information can be useful reference 
information when visiting tourist spots. The information 
supports estimation of the period during which a tourist can

enjoy the four seasons by viewing cherry blossoms and 
autumn 
leaves. 
Hereinafter, 
Section 
III.A 
describes 
collection of geotagged tweets to be analyzed. Section III.B 
describes preprocessing for conducting analysis. Section 
III.C explains the best-time estimation method. In our 
proposed method up to now, the numbers of geotagged 
tweets have been small. It is possible to estimate the best 
time in a prefecture unit or municipality, but finely honed 
analyses have not been possible. Estimating the best time to 
visit sightseeing spots with finer granularity is possible using 
the method with interlinkage proposed in this paper. We 
propose two improvements of the best estimation method 
using interlinkage based on the best-time estimation method 
without interlinkage using the moving average method we 
have proposed. Section III.C.1 presents interlinkage using 
Kriging. Section III.C.2 presents interlinking using the 
average of regional amounts. Section III.D describes the 
output of the estimation result. 
A. Data collection 
This section presents a description of the Method of (1) 
data collection presented in Figure 1. Geotagged tweets sent 
from Twitter are a collection target. The range of geotagged 
tweets includes the Japanese archipelago (120.0°E – 154.0°E, 
and 20.0°N – 47.0°N) as the collection target. The collection 
of these data was done using a streaming API [13] provided 
by Twitter Inc. 
Next, we describe the number of collected data. 
According to a report presented by Hashimoto et al. [14], 
among all tweets originating in Japan, about 0.18% are 
geotagged tweets: they are rare among all data. However, the 
geotagged tweets we collected are an average of 500 
thousand tweets per day. We use about 250 million 
geotagged tweets from 2015/2/17 through 2017/5/13. We 
calculated the best time for flower viewing, as estimated 
using the processing described in the following sections 
using these data. 
B. Preprocessing 
This section presents a description of the method of (2) 
preprocessing shown in Figure 1. Preprocessing includes 
reverse geocoding and morphological analysis, as well as 
database storage for data collected through the processing 
described in Section III.A. 
From latitude and longitude information in the 
individually collected tweets, reverse geocoding is useful to 
identify prefectures and municipalities by town name. We 
use a simple reverse geocoding service [15] available from 
the National Agriculture and Food Research Organization in 
this process: e.g., (latitude, longitude) = (35.7384446°N, 
139.460910°E) by reverse geocoding becomes (Tokyo, 
Kodaira City, Ogawanishi-cho 2-chome). 
Morphological analysis divides the collected geo-tagged 
tweet morphemes. We use the “Mecab” morphological 
analyzer [16]. By way of example, "桜は美しいです” ( in 
English “Cherry blossoms are beautiful.”)" is divided into 
"(桜 / noun), (は / particle), (美しい / adjective), (です / 
auxiliary verb), (。 / symbol)". 
Preprocessing accomplishes the necessary data storage 
for best-time viewing, as estimated based on results of the 
processing of the data collection, reverse geocoding, and 
morphological analysis. Data used for this study were the 
tweet ID, tweet post time, tweet text, morphological analysis 
result, latitude, and longitude. 
C. Estimating best-time viewing 
This section presents a description of the method of (3) 
best-time estimation presented in Figure 1. Our method for 
the best-time viewing processes the target number of 
extracted data and calculates a simple moving average, 
yielding an inference of the best time to view the flowers. 
The method defines a word related to the best-time viewing: 
the target word. Table I shows that the target word is a word 
including Chinese characters, hiragana, and katakana, which 
represents an organism name and a seasonal change. 
TABLE I.  
TARGET WORD EXAMPLES 
 
 
A 7-day moving average is based on one week because a 
tendency exists for tweets to be more numerous on weekends 
than on weekdays. In addition, the phenological observations 
which are the current experiment subjects are targeting 
“events” that happen once a year (e.g., appreciation of cherry 
blossoms, viewing of autumn leaves, moon viewing). Such 
events are therefore based on a one-year moving average. 
Next, we describe the simple moving average calculation, 
which uses a moving average of the standard of the best-time 
viewing judgment. A simple moving average is calculated on 
a daily basis using aggregate data by the target number of 
data extraction described above. Figure 2 presents an 
overview of the simple moving average of the number of 
days. 
We calculate the simple moving average in formula (1) 
using the number of data going back to the past from the day 
before the estimated date of the best-time viewing. 
 
                                 𝑋(𝑌) = 𝑃1 + 𝑃2 + ⋯ + 𝑃𝑌

                     (1) 
 
𝑋(𝑌) : Y day moving average 
𝑃𝑛 : Number of data of n days ago 
𝑌 : Calculation target period 
 
The standard lengths of time we used for the simple 
moving average are 7 days and one year. A 7-day moving 
average is based on one week as the criterion of the 
estimated period of full bloom because, as shown in Table II,  
geotagged tweets of the increases tend to be more numerous 
on weekends than on weekdays. In addition, the 
phenological observations which are on the basis of the 
165

moving average of best-time the current experiment subjects 
are targeting "events" that happen once a year (e.g., 
appreciation of cherry blossoms, viewing estimated in prior 
years because many such “viewing” events occur every year: 
cherry blossom viewing, of autumn leaf viewing, and even 
leaves, moon viewing). Such events are therefore based on a 
one-year moving average. 
 
 
Figure 2.  Number of days simple moving average. 
TABLE II.  
TRANSITION OF GEOTAGGED TWEETS (2015/5/9 – 6/3) 
 
 
Next, we describe a simple moving average of the 
number of days specified for each organism to compare the 
7-day moving average and the one-year moving average. In 
this study, the best time to view the period varies depending 
on the specified organism, the individual organism, and the 
number of days from the biological period. 
As an example, we describe cherry blossoms. The Japan 
Meteorological Agency [17] carries out phenological 
observations of "Sakura," which yields two output items of 
the flowering date and the full bloom date observation target. 
The "Sakura flowering date" [18] is the first day on which 
blooming of 5–6 or more wheels of flowers occurs on a 
specimen tree. The "Sakura in full bloom date" is the first 
day on which about 80% or more of the buds are open in the 
specimen tree. In addition, "Sakura" is the number of days 
from general flowering until full bloom: about five days. 
Therefore, "Sakura" in this study uses a 5-day moving 
average, which is standard. 
Next, we describe an estimated judgment of the best-
time for viewing, as calculated using the simple moving 
average (7-day moving average, one-year moving average, 
and another biological moving average). It specifies the two 
conditions as a condition of an estimated decision for the 
best-time for viewing. Condition 1 is the number of data one 
day before expression. Formula (2) is a simple moving 
average, which is greater than that of the estimated best-
time to view date. Condition 2 is a case that follows 
formulas (3) ((A) / (2)) or more. The short number of days 
by comparison of the 7-day moving average and another 
biological moving average is A. A long number of days is B. 
 
                                       𝑃1 ≧ 𝑋(365)                                        (2) 
                                  𝑋(𝐴) ≧ 𝑋(𝐵)                                            (3) 
 
Finally, an estimate is produced from conditions 1 and 2. 
Using the proposed method, a day satisfying both condition 
1 and condition 2 is estimated for best-time viewing. 
The method presented above is the conventional method 
we have proposed. However, when interlinkage is not used, 
it is difficult to estimate the optimum position with fine 
granularity. Therefore, we propose a method using the 
following information 1) and 2). Then, interlinkage using 1) 
or 2) is used to estimate the best viewing time. 
1) Interlinkage using Kriging 
This section presents the first method of interlinkage, for 
which we used Kriging [19], an estimation method used for 
estimating values for points where information was not 
acquired. We ascertain the distribution of information in the 
whole space in geostatistics. 
Next, the granularity for estimation is shown. For an 
estimate for Japan as a whole, prefecture units are assumed 
and acquired by reverse geocoding. However, when 
conducting more detailed analyses, a difficulty arises: it is 
impossible to estimate the number of geotagged tweets for 
each city or town or village or tourist spot. Therefore, based 
on latitude and longitude information of collected tweets, 
data are accumulated for each division of land using tertiary 
mesh data provided by the Land Numerical Information 
download service of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, 
and Transport [20]. The tertiary mesh is a section of about 1 
km square. We attempted estimation through interlinkage 
using data aggregated for each section of tertiary mesh data. 
The estimated value of the target data at a certain point S0 is 
represented in formula (4) as a weighted average of the 
measured values Z(Si) (i = 1, 2..., N) at N points Si existing 
around point S0. As described in this paper, we 
experimentally assigned a +1 weight for 'full bloom' and 
'beautiful', and assigned -1 on 'still' or 'falling'. Then we 
assigned value Z to tweets including the target word and Z. 
Here, N represents the 30 nearby targeted tweets. λ

2) Interlinkage using regional quantity 
 
In this section, we explain the interlinkage method using 
regional quantities of tweets of city, town, and village units. 
Conventionally, the best optimum time was estimated using 
the moving average value without interlinkage using 
estimation judgment, as described later. As a result, for the 
analysis of a wide area such as prefecture unit, the R_value 
can be estimated as about 80%. However, with an estimate 
of granularity such as by a sightseeing spot, the inability to 
estimate the viewing period from scarce data is difficult. 
Therefore, we propose a method of using regional quantities 
that newly use interlinkage to compensate for the lack of 
data volume. The proposed method uses the result of reverse 
geocoding obtained during preprocessing in the previous 
section. Tweets that were judged as originating from the 
same municipality by reverse geocoding are summed for 
each day by city, town, or village. Then, considering the 
characteristic that the tweets move on a weekly basis, we 
obtain a 7-day moving average and set the 7-day moving 
average of the municipalities as the regional quantity of 
each region. To estimate the best time for viewing, use the 
value obtained by adding the regional quantity of the 
municipality where the sightseeing spot is located to the 
tweet amount of the sightseeing spot to be estimated. 
D. Output 
This section presents a description of the method of (4) 
output presented in Figure 1. Output can be visualized using 
a best-time viewing result, as estimated from processing 
explained in the previous section. A time-series graph 
presents the inferred results for best-time viewing. The 
graph presents the number of data and the date, respectively, 
on the vertical axis and the horizontal axis. We are striving 
to develop useful visualization techniques for travelers. 
IV. 
EXPERIMENTS 
This section presents a description of an experiment to 
estimate the best-time viewing for cherry blossoms using the 
method described in Section III. An experiment is conducted 
to infer the best time to view flowers for the proposed 
method described in Section III. Section IV.A describes the 
dataset used for optimal time reasoning to see flowers in full 
bloom. As an estimation result by sightseeing spot, Section 
IV.B presents the estimation result without using interlinkage, 
and the best estimation result obtained using interlinkage in 
Section IV.C. Section IV.D presents a comparison of the 
experiment results from Section IV.B and Section IV.C. 
 
A. Dataset 
Datasets used for this experiment were collected using 
streaming API, as described for data collection in Section 
III.1. The data, which include about 250 million items, are 
geotagged tweets from Japan during 2015/2/17 – 2017/5/13. 
The estimation experiment conducted to ascertain the 
best-time viewing of cherry blossoms uses the target word 
“cherry blossom,” which is “桜” and “さくら” and “サクラ” 
in Japanese. We analyzed tweet texts that included the target 
word. About 100,000 tweets during in the experiment period 
included the subject word. 
The subject of the experiment was set as tourist spots in 
Tokyo. In this report, we describe “Takao Mountain,” 
“Showa Memorial Park,” “Shinjuku gyoen,” and “Rikugien.” 
Figure 3 presents the target area locations. A, B, C, and D in 
the figure respectively denote “Takao Mountain,” “Showa 
Memorial Park,” “Rikugien,” and “Shinjuku Gyoen.” A and 
B are separated by about 16 km straight-line distance. B and 
C are about 32 km apart. C and D are about 6 km apart. In 
this experiment, about 30,000 tweets including the target 
word in Tokyo were found. In this experiment, all tweets 
made by the same user are also used as analysis targets if 
they are tweets including the target word. 
 
 
Figure 3.  Position of the target area. 
 We use these datasets to estimate the optimum time for 
the sightseeing spots in Tokyo using experiments without 
interlinkage. We conducted experiments of the following 
two kinds. The first is an experiment using the number of 
tweets including the target word and the sightseeing spot 
name without interlinkage. This experiment uses the 
conventional method we proposed. This experiment was 
compared as Baseline to confirm the usefulness of 
interlinkage proposed in this paper. The second is an 
experiment using interlinkage. In this experiment, we used 
two methods: interlinkage using Kriging of Section III.C.1) 
and interlinkage using regional quantity described in Section 
III.C.2).

B. Estimation experiment for best-time viewing without 
interlinkage 
This section presents experimentally obtained results for 
estimating the best time without using interlinkage from 
tweets containing a target word and sightseeing spot name. 
Figure 4 presents results for the estimated best-time viewing 
in 2016 using the target word ‘cherry blossoms’ in the target 
tourist spots. The dark gray bar in the figure represents the 
number of tweets. The light gray part represents best-time 
viewing as determined using the proposed method. 
Additionally, the solid line shows the 5-day moving average. 
The dashed line shows the 7-day moving average. The 
dotted line shows the one-year moving average. 
At tourist spots targeted for the experiment in 2016, as 
portrayed in Figure 4, many data were obtained for C and D. 
The maximum number of tweets per day was about 30. 
These results confirmed that some estimation can be 
accomplished using near-site estimation method without 
interpolation. However, best-time viewing cannot be done in 
A and B because of the very small number of tweets. 
This difficulty applies to many sightseeing spots in 
Japan. In fact, a difficulty exists by which it is impossible to 
estimate the best-time to see the sightseeing spots and other 
fine-grain sight by simply using the number of geotagged 
tweets. This experimentally obtained result clarified that the 
method we proposed previously cannot be predictive for 
detailed areas such as sightseeing spots. This result is 
attributable to the lack of information volume. 
C. Estimation experiment for best-time viewing with 
interlinkage 
In this section, the results of interlinkage using Kriging 
of Section III.C.1, which is the method proposed in this 
paper, and interlinkage using the region quantities of 
Section III.C.2 are shown in Section IV.C.1 and Section 
IV.C.2. 
1) Estimation experiment for best-time viewing by 
interlinkage using Kriging 
Figure 5 portrays an experimentally obtained result from 
interlinking results for a tertiary mesh including the tourist 
spots we examined. The notation is the same as that 
presented in Figure 4. 
Apparently, A and B were able to produce an estimate 
using the proposed method by increasing the number of 
tweets using interlinkage with surrounding tweets. For C 
and D, there are days when it can be determined more 
accurately by interpolating the number of tweets. However, 
because tweets of negative judgments exist such as "still" or 
"scattered" among surrounding tweets, in some cases, 
interpolation excluded the day determined as the best time 
in Experiment 1. Therefore, the judgment condition of the 
tweet is subject to further study. These results confirmed the 
possibility of estimating the peak period, even for an area 
without tweets, using data interpolation and overall tweet 
number interpolation.

2) Estimation experiment for best-time viewing by 
interlinkage  using regional quantities 
 In this section, we explain experimentally obtained 
estimation results obtained using interlinkage of regional 
quantities. Figure 6 presents results obtained using 
interlinking. The notation is the same as the notation used 
for Figure 3 in the previous section. 
Apparently, A and B can produce an estimate using the 
proposed method by increasing the number of tweets using 
interlinkage with surrounding tweets. For C and D, there are 
days that can be determined more accurately by 
 
Figure 5.  Experimental results obtained using interlinking.

interpolating the 
number of tweets. These results 
demonstrate the possibility of first resolving the difficulty of 
insufficient information when using sightseeing spot tweet 
data of the tourist spot area along with interpolation, and 
then estimating the peak period for each tourist spot. 
Furthermore, even given the same area of Tokyo, the 
times estimated for A and B are later than those of C and D. 
These later results is attributable to the fact that A and B are 
at higher altitudes than either C or D. Flowers can be 
expected to bloom later in the year there. 
Therefore, 
using 
interlinkage, 
one 
can 
confirm 
differences in surroundings even within one prefecture. 
More detailed analysis becomes possible with interlinkage 
using the proposed method. 
D. Comparing estimations and observed data for best times 
for viewing 
This 
section 
presents 
a 
comparison 
between 
experimentally obtained results and observation data. An 
estimation result obtained without using interlinkage was 
taken as the Baseline. Then, the experiment using 
interlinkage with Kriging of Section IV.C.1 was taken as 
experiment 1. Experiment 2 was based on interlinkage using 
the regional quantity of Section IV.C.2. 
1) Comparison of observation data with best time of 
viewing estimation using  interlinkage with Kriging 
Table III presents results of the optimal time for viewing 
in 2016, as estimated using Kriging. The baseline 
examination used co-occurring words in tweets including 
the sightseeing spot name coexisting with the target word 
"Sakura." Experiment 1 used interlinkage on a tertiary mesh 
including sightseeing spots. The numerical values in the 
table are the numbers of tweets including the target word 
and co-occurrence word in the Baseline. Experiment 1 uses 
the sum of the number of tweets in the Baseline plus the 
numerical values by obtained using interpolation. The light 
gray area shows the date when the fullness prediction was 
made using the proposed method. 
Confirming the flowering day and full bloom period of 
each sightseeing spot using JMA data is difficult, but this 
experiment evaluating SNS data for flowering is valid also 
for use by weather forecasting companies [21] and public 
service organizations [22] to ascertain the optimum times 
for viewing based on services and blogs that are used. 
Arrows indicating the flowering time can be checked 
manually at tourist sites. Recall and precision using the 
observed data and the best time to view estimated results are 
calculated respectively for target areas for 2016 for 3/1 – 
4/30 using formula (5) and formula (6). We used the 
R_value as the recall rate using the proposed method, and 
the P_value and R_value, respectively, as the relevance rate 
and recall rate when using the proposed method.

Experimental results confirmed the tendency by which 
the relevance ratio and the R_value become higher for 
tourist spots with fewer tweets. Therefore, we can present 
the possibility of estimating sightseeing sites with few 
tweets 
using 
interlinkage. 
However, 
because 
the 
interpolation information amount is insufficient in the 
current method, it is necessary to improve the interlinking 
method further. Furthermore, because sightseeing spots with 
many tweets are affected by tweets of negative judgments in 
the surroundings, the accuracy is lower than in the Baseline. 
However, one might be able to estimate more details, such 
as the start time, using interpolation. 
2) Comparison of observation data with best time of 
viewing estimation using interlinking with regional 
quantities 
Table IV presents results of the optimal time for viewing 
in 
2016, 
as 
estimated 
using 
regional 
quantities. 
Experimentally obtained results confirmed the tendency by 
which the relevance ratio and the R_value became higher in 
Experiment 2 than in the Baseline. In addition, A and B, 
which are at higher altitudes than either C or D, 
demonstrated regional features: the best viewing time occurs 
later. These results confirmed the usefulness of the proposed 
method for best-time estimation for sightseeing spots using 
interlinkage along with regional data. Using this proposed 
method, information can be interpolated according to the 
sightseeing spot. One can obtain better estimation with finer 
granularity than that available with the conventional method. 
Additionally, comparison with Experiment 1 of Section 
IV.D.1 is good because, in Experiment 1, the tweet contents 
are analyzed and interpolation is performed using tweets 
including specific information. Therefore, the tweet number 
used for interlinkage is less than that in Experiment 2. By 
contrast, in Experiment 2, the moving average value using 
all tweets included in the same area judged as the same 
municipality by reverse geocoding is used without analyzing 
the tweet contents. Experiment 2 is useful at the present 
stage, but it seems that the possibility exists that improving 
Experiment 1 to analyze tweet contents might improve the 
estimation accuracy. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
As described herein, to improve best-time estimation 
accuracy and thereby enhance tourist information related to 
phenological observation, we proposed an interlinking 
method. 
For the first proposed method, information was 
interpolated using neighbor-weighted tweets on a tertiary 
mesh including sightseeing spots, thereby indicating the 
optimum time to view flowers at sightseeing spots. The 
results of cherry blossom experiments conducted at 
sightseeing spots in Tokyo in 2016 confirm the tendency for 
improvement of the estimation accuracy using interlinking. 
The proposed method using interlinkage for tweets related 
to organism names might improve the accuracy of 
estimating the best time in the real world. We confirmed the

possibility of applying this proposed method to estimation 
of the viewpoint and line of sight in areas and sightseeing 
spots with few tweets and little location information. 
However, analysis of the contents of tweets is an 
experimentally obtained result obtained using few words. 
Effective interlinking cannot be established. Therefore, 
future research with manual experimental weighting and 
geotagged 
tweets 
is 
expected 
to 
facilitate 
further 
improvements to overcome insufficiencies in the measured 
values used for interpolation. Additionally, we expect to 
reconsider the viewing angle estimation conditions. 
The second proposed method showed optimal times to 
see flowers at sightseeing spots by interpolating information 
using the 7-day moving average of the number of tweets of 
municipalities, including those of sightseeing spots. This 
method can estimate the best time for sightseeing spots with 
fine granularity, yielding predictions in units required for 
sightseeing. 
The results of cherry blossom experiments conducted for 
tourist spots in Tokyo in 2016 using the proposed method 
confirmed improvement of the estimation accuracy when 
using interlinking. The proposed method using interlinkage 
for tweets related to named organisms (sakura trees) might 
improve the real-world accuracy of estimating the best times. 
We confirmed the possibility of applying this proposed 
method to estimation of viewpoints and lines of sight in 
areas and sightseeing spots with few tweets and little 
location information. The proposed method interpolated 
information and yielded highly accurate estimation, perhaps 
because of the fact that cherry blossoms bloom with short-
term changes and because public interest is high. Therefore, 
future studies can be conducted to verify whether similar 
results are obtainable using other biological season 
observations. 
Future studies must also assess the automatic extraction 
of target words and methods to make future predictions in 
real time. Eventually, this system might be extended to a 
system for travelers to obtain travel-destination-related 
event information and disaster information in real time.
