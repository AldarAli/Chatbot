Abstract—Recent research in opportunistic networks address 
the diffusion policy and the practicality considerations in 
utilizing device-specific applications. Intermittent connectivity 
between mobile nodes and the random behavioral patterns of 
the users, make modeling and measuring the performance of 
opportunistic networks very challenging particularly in the case 
of file/object sharing among these devices. As the cache-and-
forward replication policy plays a major role targeting the 
availability of requested resources, there should be a 
mechanism for controlling the minimization of the redundant 
replicas and the uncontrolled diffusion effects onto the 
communicating nodes. In this work the diffusion policy of 
requested replicated objects is examined with regards to the 
probabilistic 
synchronized 
movement 
of 
the 
devices, 
quantifying the parameters that affect the reliable transmission 
and the availability of requested resources by any node. The 
assigned scheme takes into consideration the movement 
synchronization of the moving devices and applies a recursive 
adaptive caching cooperation scheme in community-oriented 
relay regions. The scheme also uses the Message Ferry (MF) 
mobile Peer in a bi-directional mode, in order to enable higher 
degree of reliability in the availability of the requested 
resources. Conducted simulation experiments using real-time 
traffic traces show that the proposed scheme offers high 
throughput and reliability response for sharing resources on-
the-move while it minimizes the redundancy of replications.  
Keywords- bi-directional recursive data-replication; partially 
synchronized mobility scheme; object sharing scheme; reliability 
and availability of resources; resource exchange efficiency; 
evaluation through simulation. 
 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
On-the-move reliable resource exchange has been a fertile 
ground for enabling researches to explore further techniques 
for successful resource diffusion according to users’ 
demands. In this direction a catalytic factor has been the 
Wireless technologies growth which represents another 
orthogonal area of growth, in both wide-area applications like 
2.5G/3G and local area applications like 802.11b/g and 
Bluetooth. Many constraints exist in such networks like 
resource availability whereas the topological scheme 
followed in these infrastructures should be combined with the 
availability of the requested resources and the time-access for 
sharing resources with the synchronized motion within a 
specified time duration t. A Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network 
(VANET) is a technology that uses moving cars as 
devices/nodes in a dynamically changing network to establish 
a mobile network connectivity. In this paper a reliable file 
sharing scheme for vehicular Mobile Peer-to-Peer (MP2P) 
devices is proposed taking the advantages of moving devices 
within a specified roadmap with different pathways like in 
real time vehicular networks. This work exploits the 
movements of the devices and the passive device 
synchronization to increase end-to-end file sharing efficiency 
through vehicular users [1] and Mobile Infostations [1][3]. 
Through geographical roadmaps landscapes where mobile 
Infostations 
are 
set 
and 
initialized, 
the 
passive 
synchronization enables through the replication policy to 
create a replicated object in order to establish reliable file 
sharing. Role-based Mobile Infostations (MIs) are selected 
based on their velocity, residual energy, remaining capacity 
etc and are assigned according to the passive Message Ferry 
peer. This scheme proved its robustness in node’s density 
since it does not require the knowledge and the global figure 
of the number of users. Additionally it does not require 
spatial distributions to efficiently spread information while 
enables reliability in supported mobility without the 
scheduled ‘rendezvous’, whereas it effectively passes the 
requested replicas to designated users. 
The organization of the paper is as follows: Section II 
discusses the related work that has been done on similar 
schemes which use similar approaches for establishing and 
maintaining end-to-end file sharing efficiency. Section III 
then introduces the proposed model based on [1] where 
instead of using a uni-directional replication mechanism as in 
[1], this work utilizes a bi-directional recursive data-
replication mechanism for opportunistically connected 
vehicular P2P Systems. The proposed mechanism optimizes 
significantly the work done in [1] by using the movement 
exploitation in a synchronized form, to increase end-to-end 
file sharing reliability and hosts a stochastic measure to 
estimate the end-to-end capacity within the path where the 
requested replicas were created. Section IV shows the

experimental simulation-based performance evaluation of the 
proposed scheme and the comparisons done under different 
convergent parameterized conditions. Particular focus was 
given to the impact of certain probabilistic movements made 
by Vehicular-Peer-to-Peer (VP2P) devices where multi-client 
applications, dynamically demand resources directly from 
certain nodal vehicles on-the-move. The stochastic model 
introduced in [1] is being used measuring the end-to-end 
capacity and the dynamic caching activity of the requested 
objects onto opportunistic neighboring devices. In addition 
the proposed model takes into consideration a number of 
parameters, in order to limit the potential inadequacies of 
resource sharing process due to intermittent connectivity, 
whereas through these parameters it enables further accuracy 
in the resource sharing process. A resource assignment 
cooperation engine is hosted under the proposed framework 
considering the proposed Go-back-N caching cooperation 
scheme taking place in a bi-directional mode using cluster-
based approach with ranked requests.  
II. 
RECENT SCHEMES AND WORK DONE 
Mobile resource sharing policy needs to be supported by a 
reliable mechanism which will guarantee the resource 
exchange in an end-to-end available manner. A great amount 
of research effort has been invested to facilitate mobile 
applications in the last few years hosting approaches that can 
be categorized into three types: network layer–based 
approaches, transport layer–based approaches, and proxy-
based approaches. A significant and common goal of these 
approaches is to maintain the connectivity for mobile users 
even when they perform vertical handoffs between different 
networks [2]. As mobility in opportunistic and autonomic 
communication is an essential parameter and along with the 
user’s demands they pose the vision of what self-behaving 
flexibility should encompass in next-generation self-tuning 
behavior [1], the resource exchange apparatus should 
guarantee the consistency and reliability by using assisted 
mechanisms using resilience metrics [2] for enabling delay 
sensitive resource sharing. The capacity of the nodes which 
are traversed in the requested path, can be reduced 
significantly particularly if we are dealing with delay 
sensitive traffic or bursty traffic [1] whereas the underlying 
end-to-end supporting mechanism should be aware of the 
dynamic movements in a Peer-to-Peer manner. Obviously, if 
the transmission-range of a node increases, then the 
interference it causes will increase and probably the number 
of nodes which will have copy/copies of the packets that 
should be forwarded, will increase. Toumpis and Goldsmith 
[4] define and study capacity regions for wireless Ad-hoc 
networks with an arbitrary number of nodes and topology. 
These regions describe the set of achievable rate 
combinations between all source-destination pairs in the 
network under various transmission strategies for EC content 
sharing and power control. In this work we consider the 
capacity but in an end-to-end path-request manner, and take 
into consideration the variations caused by the dynamic 
movements 
of 
the 
devices/vehicles. 
Most 
existing 
architectures (including Grace [5], Widens [6], MobileMan 
[7]) rely on local information and local devices’ views, 
without considering the global networking context or views 
which may be very useful for wireless networks in optimizing 
load balancing, routing, energy management, and even some 
self-behaving properties like self-organization. 
Further to the research work done in [1] where, author 
associates the synchronized movements and the related 
connectivity aspects among vehicles, this work proposes and 
utilizes a scheme where the end-to-end file sharing 
efficiency, increases in vehicular MP2P devices. The scheme 
in [1] extends the advantages offered by the Hybrid Mobile 
Infostation System (HyMIS) architecture proposed by 
Mavromoustakis and Karatza, in [8], where the Primary 
Infostation (PI) is not static but can move according to the 
pathway(s) of the roadmaps. HyMIS adopts the basic concept 
of pure Infostation system in terms of capacity service node 
but it avoids flooding the network with unnecessary flow of 
information (redundant diffusion of unnecessary resources). 
This node plays a role of control storage node (backup 
capacity node) as Haas and Small mention in [9]. Taking the 
advantages of the proxy caching [10] and the cache-and-
forward apparatus work done [2] this work proposes an 
exploitation of the mobility characteristics of each user by 
utilizing the MI peer to be dynamically selected according to 
characteristics such as the residual capacity of the device 
based on the push-based activities by other nodes. 
Additionally with the work done in [1] the innovating 
research aspect is that the proposed resource assignment 
cooperation scheme enables the caching mechanism to affect 
the degree of reliability using the variable window size into 
the requested replicas by N-hop peers. The proposed Go-
back-N caching cooperation scheme takes place in a bi-
directional mode in order to enable availability of requested 
resources (ranked requests) by certain peers in the community 
cluster. Heavy emphasis of this work has been put on push-
based dissemination explored in [9] by Little and Agarwal, 
and in [12] by Lochert et al, and analytical dissemination 
through vehicle-to-vehicle propagation proposed by Wu, 
Fujimoto and Riley [13] as well as on some recent findings 
on practical systems as in [14] [18] by Lee et al, and Mahajan 
et al respectively, for pull-based diffusion activities. The 
proposed cache-and-forward replication scheme targets the 
availability of requested resources by using an index-based 
mechanism which will enable the selection of the MI in a 
formed cluster L (as in [1]). The following section explores 
the passive synchronized mobility model in the end-to-end 
path and presents an analytical model for the end-to-end 
capacity estimations.

The interactions with roadside equipment for exchanging 
resources can be characterized accurate, whereas most 
vehicles have restrictions in their range of motion. As an 
example vehicles cannot follow other vehicles and they are 
subject to constraints for following a certain ‘caravan’ of 
vehicles in a highway. Therefore resource sharing can be 
performed using any web technology -pure Infostations

approach [1], [2]- available in the car. According to recent 
literature [15] [16] for a better delivery ratio and in order to 
reduce broadcast storms, a message has to be relayed by a 
minimum of intermediate nodes to the destination. In order to 
have this achieved, nodes are organized on a basis of a set of 
clusters, in which one node or more (Cluster Head) gathers 
data in his cluster and send them after to the next cluster. By 
using cluster-based solutions for disseminating the requested 
information into a “locally” limited number of nodes (that 
potentially will maintain their connectivity for time t 
(according to the path followed in the roadside)), these 
solutions provide less propagation delay and high delivery 
ratio with also bandwidth equity. In [14] the authors use a 
distributed clustering algorithm to create a virtual backbone 
that allows only some nodes to broadcast messages and thus, 
to reduce significantly broadcast storms. As recent studies 
have reported that intermittent network connection is 
inevitable for mobile users on a daily basis [15] [16] [17] 
have also shown that network capacity can be increased 
dramatically by exploiting node mobility as a type of 
multiuser diversity. As a result the opportunistic nature of the 
ad-hoc connections can be useful for “virtually” extending 
the coverage of wireless communications by using the 
notation of the cache-and-forward replication policy. There 
are two distinct approaches that allow mobile users to request 
and transfer data on the go: namely, the cache-based 
approach or the static Infostation-based approach. Cache-
based approaches facilitate mobile file transfer by prefetching 
popularly requested files (e.g., commercial ads, movie 
trailers, and song previews) to a local storage. In this work 
the cluster’s local storage is provided with a role that is being 
utilized and processed by any node within the virtual cluster. 
The Infostation-based approaches, on the other hand, support 
on-demand FTP requests by deploying dedicated servers as 
bridges between the Internet and mobile networks. However, 
the capability of these approaches for mobile file transfer is 
limited because they are basically centralized and have non-
autonomic control over the resource sharing process, and as a 
result they fail to exploit and reflect the diversity and 
properties of network mobility.  
This work uses the cache-oriented apparatus to facilitate 
mobile resource sharing/file transfer by prefetching popular 
requested files for a certain time duration onto any other 
nearby node within a specified number of hops. A significant 
aspect of the reliability and the availability of the requested 
resources in wireless systems, is the sudden partitioning of 
the 
connectivity, 
namely 
intermittent-connectivity 
experienced by nodes. This work differs from [1] in the sense 
that it combines the strengths of cache-based approach (i.e., 
prefetching the most likely requested files to a local storage, 
Figure 1) in an adaptive way by considering a window size 
model for estimating scheduled retransmissions of the 
requested file chunks. In addition the model considers the 
relay epoch and the mobility considerations for each node in 
the k-hop path for efficient end-to-end dissemination, and to 
further utilize the opportunistic communication in a reliable 
manner.  
In order to avoid any sudden -unpredictable- network 
partitioning problems and prevent the exchange of any 
requested information a cache-based approach replication 
policy is used. Requested object replication [12] [27] and 
replicas redundancy [9] face the requests’ failures whereas 
they create severe duplications. However these approaches 
aggravate the capacity of the end-to-end path whereas, as the 
path remains relatively small in terms of hops, these 
approaches can face the resource sharing problems 
adequately. On the other hand if the path is ‘long’ hosting 
many hops then the redundancy of duplications of the 
requested packets, aggravates the system’s performance 
geometrically with the number of hops [24]. Considering all 
the extracted factors above this work enables the resource 
sharing process to be performed via the the Passive 
Opportunistic Synchronized Approach (POSA) [1] using a 
certain likelihood for this resource synchronization. Figure 2 
shows the vehicular P2P resource sharing process using the 
push and pull procedure in a certain path. The scheme uses 
the Passive Opportunistic Synchronized Approach in order to 
share resources and enable duplications to nearby requesting 
nodes(nodes that are requesting certain resources/i.e.,file).

requested file chunks for a certain time duration onto any other nearby node

moving in probabilistic paths. 
Any vehicle/device can communicate directly with any 
other vehicle within the transmission range of each device. 
Therefore on a hop-by-hop basis each vehicle can push and 
pull information using the transmission channel of each node 
that it communicates. The system environment is assumed to 
be a dynamically changing MP2P network where mobile 
hosts access data items held as originals by other mobile 
hosts. Data items are periodically updated and ranked 
according to the ranking criteria of the intercluster and 
intracluster requests [8] [21] [28]. Each mobile host creates 
replicas of the data items which were highly ranked, and 
keeps the replicas in its memory space. When a mobile host 
issues an access request for a data item, the request is 
considered as successful in either case: (a) the request issue 
host itself holds the original/replica of the data item or (b) at 
least one mobile host (which is not directly necessarily 
connected) has the file (packets) of a replica of it. Figure 2 
also shows the proposed vehicular MP2P push and pull 
procedure where the i-th vehicle is assigned as MI and can 
pull requested resources to i-1, i-2, i-3, i-k, whereas the 
vehicle which the MI follows can then push any of these

resources to the i+1, i+2, i+MIk vehicle (dash lines denote 
the push procedure which takes place and solid lines denote 
the pull procedure). Both procedures take place until the next 
and preceding MI is reached while i-th node is sharing 
resources, respectively. These notations can also be seen in a 
more clear form in the Figure’s 5 pseudocode, which shows a 
single step for the vehicle’s MI transition. 
 
Figure 2.  
The push and pull configuration for Vehicular MP2P devices 
while moving in predetermined paths. 
In order to reduce significantly the rendandancy of 
replicated packets, the HyMIS [3] [8] scheme is used where 
the primary Infostation is non-static (PI) but can move as the 
pathway allows according to certain likelihood. The PI is 
called Mobile Infostation (MI), and enables recoverability for 
any requested object in the end-to-end path while it maintains 
the sharing reliability. As vehicles are moving from one 
direction to the other the i-th vehicle (MI) can pull requested 
resources to i-1, i-2, i-3, i-k, where k is the number of peer 
vehicle in the end-to-end path requesting resource Ri. As 
Figure 4 shows, a cluster of replicated objects upon creation, 
considering the trajectory of the synchronized devices 
through their mobility and the likelihood in accessing the 
certain path using cluster interactions, the update rate of the 
requests, the cost of the n-hop replications.  
Let k-hop path be the path that follows a certain 
d

direction. Then 
'd
 notation consists of the converse 
direction of d

, and the path namely j-hop path. As the 
problem of saturation was faced in work done in [1], this 
work in order to avoid any saturation issues of the non-ending 
replications, certain criteria were set for all the requested high 
ranked file chunks as in [30]. In addition, it considers the 
opposite lane j-hop combination-comparisons of file chunks’ 
requests with the requests of all the nodes in the j-path (of the 
converse pathway/Cluster Cj). Considering that the above 
scenario is used in real-time like in a vehicular raw-lane 
network, where requests of the j-hop may have a different 
direction, then it stands that for

where (1) is minimized for the node that the resource was 
downloaded at least once or when the distance d (Figure 5 
pseudocode) is over a certain threshold Dthress from the k-hop 
peer- which means that the requested resource(s) set on this 
node have been redirected to any other path. Equation 1 sets 
the rank of the node containing the requested resource to 
minimum, for the nodes that are not members of the cluster 
where the resource was requested iff d is over a certain 
threshold Dthress. If the Dthress increases then the resource is 
isolated and it no longer belongs to the Ci. This enables the 
prevention of huge duplicated information delivery, whereas 
it considers the nodes which are located far from source 
node and to maintain only the j-hops duplications-after the 
performed comparisons- avoiding redundant transmissions.  
Considering the k-hop scenario of Figure 2, the evaluated 
duration of the requested file chunks is evaluated as follows:

where C is the caching duration that is allowed for node i 
and 
iE is the relay epoch according to the number of hops 
permitted [3]. Therefore, it stands that the greater the number 
of hops, then the greater the time duration that is allowed to 
be achieved. The delay epoch duration is modelled according 
to the derivation of the Definition 1.1, taking into account 
the hop-count path, ping delays and the total delays from the 
end-to-end perspective.

B. Multi-hop probabilistic mobility model and user’s 
capacity in the end-to-end path 
Resources availability problems can be also faced using a 
local summary of the global system-or clustered information 
for the subsystem- by using the property of aggregation in 
distributed systems concept introduced by Renesse et al in 
[14]. MP2P systems require to guarantee the availability any 
requested resources as well as to enforce appropriate access 
control policies. In our application scenario, we assume that a 
common look-up application is being used in order to enable 
nodes to interexchange locally the requested information 
objects. As a starting measure we estimate the synchronized 
cooperative movements of each vehicle by measuring the 
motion performed while measuring at the same time the 
reserved capacity by each vehicle. Since vehicles are moving 
in an organized and in a predictable way, the pull and push 
model aggravates the capacity of each device, as in a MP2P 
environment. Through the proposed resource exchange 
scheme for Vehicle-to-Vehicle communications as well as 
through the additional parameters that are being considered 
(like the evaluated end-to-end relay epoch/latency, the 
mobility pattern and the time frame for the allowed 
promiscuous caching introduced in [21] by Mavromoustakis), 
the proposed model enables efficient capacity manipulation 
in the end-to-end relay region and efficient data manipulation 
in the intercluster communication. 
By adopting the modified scheme of Mavromoustakis and 
Karatza [8] and by assigning the role of MI to be adjusted 
into the vehicular devices, the PI and MI are being 
implemented by a certain frontal vehicle, where only 
unidirectional sharing and connectivity occurs.  
When mobility is considered, the design of efficient 
rendezvous data dissemination protocols is complex for 
enabling efficient manipulation and availability of resources, 
whereas the existing solutions do not consider the random 
probabilistic movements of devices while disseminating data. 
In order to measure the direction movement we enable a 
probabilistic model for the direction of the movement of each 
device. Each device is associated with a random variable 
which represents the direction movement. For the motion, 
this work considers a probabilistic Random Walk in a 
predefined pathway represented as a Graph (G) where this G 
enables as a random variable the weights of these random 
movement. A device can perform random movements 
according to the topological graph G = (V,E) where it 
comprises of a pair of sets V (or V(G)) and E (or E(G)) called 
vertices (or nodes) and edges (or arcs), respectively, where 
the edges join different pairs of vertices. This work considers 
a connected graph with n nodes labeled {1, 2, . . . , n} in a 
cluster 
nL with weight wij ≥ 0 on the edge (i, j). If edge (i, j) 
does not exist, we set wij = 0. Each node moves from its 
current 
location 
to

location

(probabilistically) choosing an arbitrary direction and speed 
from a given range. Such a move is performed either for a 
constant time for a constant distance traveled. Then new 
speed and direction are chosen. According to the probabilistic 
Mobility model, the mobility is described as a memoryless 
mobility pattern. This occurs because it retains no knowledge 
concerning its past locations and speed values. In this work a 
Probabilistic optimized approach of the Random Walk 
Mobility Model is used, as in [27] by Ibe. In this model the 
last step made by the random walk influences the next one 
based on the stationarity and the correlations between the 
movements. Under the condition that a node has moved to the 
right, the probability that it continues to move in this 
direction is then higher than to stop the movement. This leads 
to a walk that leaves the starting point much faster than the 
original random walk model. Given that the device/vehicle is 
currently at node i, the next node j is chosen from among the 
neighbors of i with probability:

where in (2) above the pij is proportional to the weight of the 
edge (i, j).  
Node mobility impacts the effectiveness of opportunistic 
resource sharing process. Previous studies have shown that  
the overhead carried by epidemic- and/or flooding-based 
routing schemes can be reduced by considering node 
mobility in a probabilistic manner as Section B presents. For 
instance, The proposed scheme takes the mobility pattern 
into account—that is, a message is forwarded to a neighbor 
node if and only if that node has a mobility pattern similar to 
that of the destination node. This is performed according to 
the probabilities explored in (2), following the probabilistic 
model for the direction of the movement of each device. 
Thus, if a device follows another device with a certain 
probability (Figure 6) where the device followed, follows it 
turn another device, this obeys to the following equation:

Therefore, if the threshold is satisfied then the replication 
takes place according to the replication policy explored by 
the HyMIS [3] and follows the limitations set by the 
adaptive replication scheme using the Go-back-N caching 
cooperation presented in the next Section.  
 
C. Cooperation and storage model using passive message 
ferries and bi-directional resource’s replications 
In order to define which requested objects should be 
outsourced onto preceding m-peers a ranking model has 
been applied as follows: To find the rank of an object a1 a2 . 
. . am, one should find the number of objects preceding it. It 
can be found by the following function: 
function rank(a1, a2, . . . , am ) 
rank← 1 ; 
for i ← 1 to m do 
for each k<ai 
rank ← rank + N(a1, a2, . . . , ai−1│ k) 
Then the new ranked sequence of shared objects will cache 
onto other nodes in the path the first i-requested objects in 
regards, to the given for each node, k parameter, where k is 
defined as a function of the remaining capacity onto each 
device as:

bounded area) is 
divided into multiple sub-squares, called cells as in [1], and 
time is divided into slots of equal duration. At each time slot 
a node is in and can be only in one cell. The initial position 
of a node is uniformly chosen from all cells. At the 
beginning of each time slot, the node jumps from its current 
cell to one of its adjacent cells with equal probability. Two 
mobile nodes can communicate with each other whenever 
they are within a distance of d, the transmission range of the 
mobile node. In order not to have an optimistic assumption a

low density population network is assumed with regards to 
the number of traversing nodes per 
i
 . We assume that no 
conspiracy policy exists where, nodes somehow conspire 
together not to meet each other forever and move at d>D 
and in parallel.  
 
 
Figure 7.  
Passive message ferries where any other device can play the 
role of the messanger regarding the information index.  
The index of each node is being transferred using the 
message ferries that are passively passing from any other 
pathway within the distance of communication range of each 
device. Figure 7 shows this approach where the message 
ferries are passing from an opposite pathway whereas at the 
same time they are in the transmission distance range with 
each device they communicate. As a result the MFs are 
forwarding information from one node to another by using 
an opposite lane and pathway. This configuration enables the 
bi-directional resource replication of high ranked requested 
resources.  
Taking into account the delay characteristics, let N be the 
number of source peers in the network (N different end-to-
end paths) and Ci(t) be the service capacity of source peer i 
at time slot t. An end-to-end download can be then depicted 
as a function of time as derived from  Chiu and Young Eun

1) Adaptive replication scheme using the recursive Go-
back-N caching cooperation 
One important aspect in P2P vehicular communication is the 
limitation of the redundant replications that are performed 
while requests are taking place in the peer-to-peer 
connectivity. When resource sharing process occurs in a 
region, the packets that are sent are considered to have a 
bounded time delay   to reach any specified destination. 
This work proposes the utilization of a methodology that 
enables the replication of the requested file chunks using a 
specified window size. The proposed method uses the 
adaptive precision Go-back-N caching cooperation where 
the number of files N that were requested can be re-selected 
to be securely replicated onto node according to the contact 
criteria using the random walk framework and the

PERFORMANCE  EVALUATION, EXPERIMENTAL 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) 
 To emulate the scenario described earlier, a possible 
realistic environment must be achieved. Dedicated Short 
Range Communications (DSRC) was used for the evaluation 
of the proposed scenario which is two-way short- to medium-
range wireless communication channels specifically designed 
for automotive use and utilizes a corresponding set of 
protocols and standards [19]. Considered to be short to 
medium range communication technology it operates in the 
5.9 GHz range. The Standards Committee E17.51 endorses a 
variation of the IEEE 802.11a MAC for the DSRC link. 
DSRC supports vehicle speed up to 120 mph, nominal 
transmission rage of 300m (up to 1000 m), and default data 
rate of 6 Mbps (up to 27 Mbps). This will enable operations 
related to the improvement of traffic flow, highway safety,

and other Intelligent Transport System (ITS) applications in a 
variety of application environments called DSRC/WAVE 
(Wireless Access in a Vehicular Environment). In the 
evaluation of the proposed scheme we evaluated the Peer-to-
Peer/Ad hoc mode (vehicle–vehicle) scenario and took into 
account the signal strength parameters and the minimized 
ping delays between the nodes in the end-to-end path 
according to the
i

p
D
Min
d



, where D is the delay 
from a node i to node j, and 
p
d is the minimized evaluated 
delay in the end-to-end available path. Moreover, considering 
the need of bandwidth for the wireless devices, it is necessary 
to apply efficient routing algorithms to create, maintain and 
repair paths, with least possible overhead production. The 
proposed scenario uses the trajectory based routing (i.e., 
SIFT) [26]. The number of nodes varies depending on the 
mobility degree and the distance variations of each user 
within a connectivity scope. The user’s transition probability 
arises from a specified location where certain information is 
pending to be received by this user. In this way the likelihood 
varies based on the demanded by users, requested resources.  
B. Simulation results of the proposed scenario and 
discussion 
In this section, we present the results extracted after 
conducting the discrete time performance evaluation through 
simulation of the proposed scenario. The simulation used a 
two-dimensional 
network, 
consisting 
of 
250 
nodes 
dynamically changing the topology on a non-periodic basis 
(asynchronously as real time mobile users do). It stands that 
after random time each node moves at a random walk to one 
of the possible destinations (north, east, west, south) in an 
organized vehicular way. Each link (frequency channel) has 
max speed reaching of 4Mb per sec, according to the regional 
EU standards of the DSRC. The propagation path loss is the 
two-ray model without fading. The network traffic is 
modeled according to the traffic sources modeled modules of 
the ns-2 simulator [29]. Initially there is a transient and 
initialization stage that is responsible to extract the resources 
(i.e., certain files) requests among users. All mobile nodes 
collaborate via a shared application that uses a distributed 
look-up service, for the shared resources. Radio coverage is 
small, and is assigned according to the DSRC specifications, 
whereas, nodes cannot contact each other directly when 
sharing resources. Each source node transmits one 512-bytes 
(~4Kbits) packet. Packets during initialization period are 
generated at every time step, destined for a random 
destination uniformly selected. Nodes have at any time 
incoming file-sharing requests by other peers whereas, during 
the time of the requests, the details of the requested resources 
are being transferred to any potential destination node. In 
addition, the modeled simulation environment considers the 
probabilistic mobility [1] taking also into account the traffic 
lights’ patterns and the randomized vehicular events that may 
occur. The results show that the proposed bi-directional 
scheme significantly outperforms previous approaches in all 
test cases, while its traffic overhead remains moderate and the 
nodes have generated adequately enough replications for the 
peer-devices, avoiding in this way the redundancy.  
Figure 9 shows the network dimensions with the data and 
capacity exchanged through the created clusters. Figure 9 
shows that even when the files that are being exchanged are 
greater than the network dimensions, the system can handle 
more than one resource per user. This result outperforms the 
previous findings where the dimension of the network 
bottlenecks the number of resources that are interexchanged 
in the moving cluster. The proposed scheme effectively 
handles the end-to-end transmissions and enables the 
complete download whereas, for this evaluation, two 
measures were taken into consideration: the data exchanged 
within the cluster i and the data exchanged with other clusters 
both versus the capacity limitations (with limited capacity 
and unlimited capacity onto users devices).

 Indication of Network dimensions with the data and capacity 
exchanged through the clusters formed. 
 
Figure 10.  The delay of the diffusion outsourcing process with the 
simulation time compared with Epidemic and collaborative schedules 
schemes.  
Figure 10 shows the delay of the diffusion outsourcing 
process with the simulation time compared with two different 
in implementation schemes: the epidemic and collaborative 
schedules schemes. It is easily spotted that Figure 10 shows 
the better performance of the proposed scheme for this 
specific scenario in vehicular P2P systems. It presents also 
the effectiveness with the significant robustness in the delay 
diffusion process-which is further minimized. Figure 11, 
presents the number of successfully received transmissions 
over of total of 25 transmissions in the path/clustered end-to-
end transmission, with the mean number of sessions created 
in the system. Figure 12 shows the number of transmitted 
packets with the number of lost packets for three different 
traffic classifications: heavy, moderate and light traffic. The 
proposed scheme shows that it can successfully treat the 
traffic with limitations and transmission deadlines accurately 
by minimizing the losses in regards to the number of 
transmitted packets. The number of participating nodes with

the number of high ranked resources over the timeline’s 
limitation of the transmission is shown in Figure 13, whereas 
Figure 14 shows the performance of the bi-directional scheme 
in contrast to other existing schemes like the Most Recently 
Claimed and the passive/generic caching. The latency for the 
proposed scheme outperforms of the other compared 
schemes, in regards to the requested file chunks and the 
number of created replicas onto N-hop nodes. In Figure 15 
the VBR requests per cluster with the successfully shared 
capacity is presented, whereas Figure 16 presents the average 
available capacity per user with the successfully shared MBs, 
depicting the efficiency of the proposed scheme in handling 
250 users concurrently. It should be noted that the exchanged 
resources cannot be unranked and this is due to the 
availability of requested resources which should be kept 
consistent, unless a low ranked resource will be highly 
outsourced and becomes highly demanded. Figure 17 shows 
the number of users sharing resources with the capacity that 
is shared in for different users’ capacity measurements. 
Figure 17 depicts the response of the system in contrast to the 
shared requested capacity and the storage capability of each 
user.

The likelihood of the movements with the direction of 
each device according to the modeled estimations is shown in 
Figure 18. In Figure 18 the likelihood corresponding to 0.31 
is considered after consecutive simulations as the ideal to set 
it as a threshold for the movement of each node. Any value 
for the likelihood below this value indicates that the device 
will soon change a direction and will not follow a 
synchronized motion with other devices. Figure 19 presents 
the number of trials with the session retransmission delay in 
msec, where the trial’s measure corresponds to the intra-
cluster retransmissions with the associated delay measures. In 
Figure 20 the performance of the Cluster with Bidirectional 
outsourced traffic requests compared with passive caching 
scheme 
is 
shown. 
Finally, 
Figure 
21 
shows 
the 
Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF or 
simply the tail distribution) with the replication degree of Go 
back-N for the successfully transmitted packets and 
completed downloads. The distribution of successfully shared 
resources can be adequate even if the replication of resources 
using the Go back-N is kept low. During the simulation 
process we have extracted different confidence intervals for 
the three compared schemes where, these are shown in Figure 
21. The proposed replication policy exposed significant 
improvement for the reliability degree, in contrast to the 
Epidemic replication proposed in [2] and the work done in 
[1]. It is undoubtetly true that Figure 21 shows that by using 
the Go Back-N in a bi-directional way, the CCDF for 
resource sharing can be significantly improved along with the 
reliability degree. In addition, it also presents the reliability 
increment, by using the CCDF tail distribution of the 
successfully completed exchanged resources, when compared 
with similar schemes for Vehicular-based resource exchange.  
 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FURTHER RESEARCH 
This work extends and re-considers, under a different 
approach in the resource sharing policy, the work done in [1] 
in a recursive bi-directional replication manner in order to 
promote resource availability among moving devices. The 
resource assignment policy takes into consideration the 
88

number of synchronized peers in the resource sharing cluster, 
and assigns resources according to the modeled Go back-N 
scheme, for replicating the requested resources onto N nodes. 
The scheme takes into consideration the probabilistic 
synchronized motion of the nodes that are requesting 
resources. According to the likelihood of the motion 
expressed by the node, the requested resources can be 
outsourced and replicated onto other nodes in the range of 
communication. As the process of exchanging resources is 
characterized by bounded end-to-end delay, the scheme 
considers also the time frame that these ranked requested 
resources should be potentially completed; otherwise they are 
outsourced to nearby nodes in order to be available for future 
requests 
by 
other 
nodes. 
Finally 
the 
methodology 
encompasses the assignment of the resources and the cache-
and-forward scheme by using and assigning the role of a 
Mobile Infostation (MI) peer to a certain vehicle whereas, 
this is done in a bi-directional way with the introduced 
Message Ferry (MF) mobile Peer. Passive message ferries are 
utilized as a resource index for the end-to-end path in order to 
efficiently enable delay sensitive streaming. Extensive 
simulation experiments that were conducted have shown that 
the proposed scheme improves the existing scheme, whereas 
in comparison with the Epidemic and the passive replication 
schemes it outperforms them in major performance 
estimations. Moreover, results have shown that the scheme 
offers high throughput and significant end-to-end reliable 
exchange of resources whereas it offers high SDR for 
completed files.  
Current and future research directions include the 
modeling of the mobility pattern of the peers by using 
different stochastic approaches like the fractional Brownian 
motion taking into account the global requests and different 
network partitioning parameters. 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
We would like to thank the University of Nicosia 
Computer Installation Center, for helping us with the 
terminals’ simulation software installation in order to perform 
exhaustive evaluations of the proposed scheme and extract 
results from different machines. These machines’ runs 
significantly helped us to derive the confidence interval 
among extracted results.
