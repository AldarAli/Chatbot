Abstract—We
examined
data
related
to
Adherence
to
telemonitoring in our Cystic Fibrosis patients followed at home
for a period of 3 years. We tested the possible presence of a
saving for Italian National Health Service. We kept electronic
records of transmissions, in spreadsheet format. For each
transmission, the main parameters and any action taken were
collected. A summary of the activities was carried out
automatically. A monthly average percentage of Adherence to
prescribed frequency of
transmissions is calculated. We
performed an economic analysis of the costs for patients
followed at home by telemonitoring, recalled under suspicion
of acute pulmonary recurrence. We received, from February,
15 2010 to May, 31 2013, 2097 data transmissions overall. The
average compliance in the reporting period was 28,86%, with
increasing
trend.
We
calculated
a
saving
compared
to
traditional home care of € 5.320,33 /year/patient. We conclude
that the improvement of outcome in FC necessarily passes
through an improvement of the Adherence to treatment. The
presence of an economic advantage is once again, although not
significant. More controlled psychological and behavioral
studies are needed to establish the real long-term effectiveness
of the use of Telehomecare in CF.

INTRODUCTION
In
Cystic
Fibrosis
(CF),
the
natural
history
is
characterized by recurrent episodes of respiratory infection
that causes a progressive pulmonary damage, with decay of
long-term lung function leading to death [1].
Spirometry shows over time in these subjects a reduction
in forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), and
then also a reduction in Current Volume (FVC), which is
around 2% of the expected value every year [2].
In case of pulmonary exacerbation, an early initiation of
antibiotic treatment helps to prevent the development of
more serious complications limiting consequently also the
pulmonary damage in the long term. Early interventions also
allow us to use advantageously less invasive antibiotic
therapies, even using the oral route of administration [3].
Since 2001, in the CF Centre of the Pediatric Hospital
Bambino Gesù in Rome, we started to use Telehomecare
(THC) in the follow-up of our patients at home. The first
results of this work have been encouraging. We found a
statistically significant reduction in hospital admissions and a
tendency over time towards a better stability of the
respiratory function [4].
It is known that, from a psychological point of view,
telemedicine can help to improve the outcome through the
acquisition of a better awareness of the disease and of the
therapeutic program by the patient [5]. In our experience, the
outcome improvement in the follow-up in CF necessarily
passes through improving adherence to treatment [6].
Regarding the economic aspect, definitive studies on a
possible positive role of telemedicine in the rationalization of
hospitalization related to long-term follow-up in CF are
lacking to date.
We have attempted to quantify the costs of telemedicine
in the follow-up of our patients. In an initial feasibility study
[7], we calculated a possible annual saving of € 5241 for
each CF patient.
In a subsequent study, conducted "in the field" [8], we
performed an economic analysis of the costs for 19 CF
patients followed at home with remote monitoring for a
period of 2 years. We analyzed the actual costs incurred by
Italian National Health Service (INHS) every time they have
been called to the hospital for suspicion of a respiratory
exacerbation. We calculated a total saving, compared to the
traditional method without telehomecare, of € 132,144.91 in
24 months, corresponding to € 3,303.62 / year / patient. The
presence of an economic advantage for INHS is then also
confirmed, although the amount of the saving is not large,
relatively to the total costs. Data from the study encourage a
possible role of telemedicine in the organization of home
care of patients with CF. In the present study, we examined
the clinical and economic data related to the activities of
telemonitoring on behalf of our CF patients followed at
home for a period of 3 years, in order to better understand
the evolution of clinical trends and the evolution of the
economic in time.
The paper is structured as follows. Section II discusses
the methods used for our approach. Section III presents the
results, followed by a discussion, in Section IV. We end with
a conclusion and ideas for future work.

II.
METHODS
This is a case feasibility study on using telehomecare for
cystic fibrosis follow-up.
24 patients are currently included in the THC program.
A clinical diagnosis of CF was given in all subjects,
confirmed by study of the CFTR gene and the sweat test.
Patients included in THC program are still followed and
treated with the usual protocols of follow-up, similar to those
who do not practice [9].
We used Spirotel ™ instrumentation, which provides and
transmits remotely data from Spirometry and overnight pulse
oximetry. The working method was described and discussed
in a previous study [10].
Since February 2010, we started keeping an electronic
register, in spreadsheet format. For each transmission, the
main parameters and the measures are recorded. A monthly
statement of assets and the calculation of the average
percentage of Adherence to the recommended frequency of
transmissions (defined as the ratio transmissions / total
patient days) is automatically done.
We also quantified the actual costs associated with the
use of telehomecare in the follow-up of patients. We have
considered as costs all the hospital admissions (Day and
Ordinary), the cycles of therapy at home and the rent for the
telemedicine equipments. We have considered as revenues
the incomings from the use of the available beds and the
working days retrieved.
We
formulated
the
hypothesis
that,
without
telehomecare,
each
recall
would
have
resulted
in
hospitalization for the necessary clinical test and any
treatment. To evaluate the possibility of an economic benefit
from the use of THC, in order to rationalize hospital
admissions, we compared the actual costs incurred by INHS
with the costs that would be sustained if each recall had
resulted in hospitalization.
III.
RESULTS
The data are related to the activity carried out in the
period from February, 15 2010 to May, 31 2013.
We enrolled in THC a total of 39 patients. 15 dropped
out (38,46%), 9 for poor adherence (60%), 4 because they
died (26,67%), 2 for other causes (13,33%) (Table I).

following the transmissions, 94 recalls in hospital which
affected 24 patients (11 calls in 2010, 15 in 2011, 54 in 2012
and 14 in the first five months of 2013). Regarding the
proceedings run, in 51% of cases the recall was followed by
a Day Hospital and 33% by a hospitalization. In 6% of cases
only a visit was performed (Fig.1).

COST ANALYSIS

DISCUSSION
We observed an annual growth in the number of
transmissions despite the decrease of the number of patients
followed. This fact shows an increasing use of the system.
The progressive increase of Adherence to treatment
means a better overall use of the method. Regarding the
frequency of the transmissions, we have recommended to our
patients a variable interval depending on the clinical
condition, generally 2 times a week at least. In this sense, we
expect the optimal adherence to treatment to be 100% for 2
transmissions per week / 5 working days. We got in clinical
practice a constant and progressive increase of treatment's
adherence to achieve in practice a doubling of the values
during the period under review (Table 2). It is also to
consider that CF patients are already burdened with a
continuous load and considerable therapies, both medical
and physiotherapy, and that this result has yet been obtained
without requiring a precise timetable for recording. The
method we have used in daily practice, described and
discussed in a previous study, has remained unchanged. We
report the objective fact that from 2011 we have started to
call via cell phone always patients after a transmission, even
under conditions of clinical stability. It is not possible to
evaluate how much this has contributed to the increase in the
values of adherence to treatment, at the current stage. The
fact remains that this is the only change made in the protocol
of follow-up. The possibility of a link between these data is
interesting and certainly requires further studies to be
defined.
The mobile phone was the medium we used to establish
the contact. The percentage of successful calls appears to
have improved over time, but the mobile phone, in our
opinion, continues to be valuable but not always completely
reliable.
From the economic point of view, the presence of an
economic advantage for the INHS is confirmed, even if not
important. The increase in the calculated savings compared
to our previous study indicates in our opinion a better
efficiency of follow-up.
Some of our patients in telemedicine have never been
recalled. For them it is impossible to carry out an assessment
of the cost-effectiveness of telemonitoring that, in this case,
has resulted only in costs.
There are currently no universally accepted criteria for
inclusion of patients with CF in a telemonitoring program
[11]. In Italy, in particular, telemonitoring is not within the
Essential Levels of Assistance (LEA) provided by our
National Health Service. The viability of telemonitoring still
depends, in individual cases, on voluntarily resources made
available by the local health authorities.
From the perspective of economic and organizational
constraints, it seems necessary to arrive to uniquely define as
soon as possible the criteria for inclusion, both in relation to
the individual clinical situation both at the lowest adherence
to the method that is compatible with a clinical benefit, as
well as economic. In our opinion, the advantage in terms of
quality of life for these patients remains in any case,
resulting from the fact of having at home a tool that allows
them to remain in contact with the CF centre more easily,
which is certainly important, however, and could also be
measured in terms of economy.
V.
CONCLUSIONS
The trend of both quantitative and qualitative parameters
of our work is positive. The data are encouraging with regard
to the possible role of telemedicine in the organization of
homecare of chronic diseases. In the current state, however,
reliable data on the long-term effectiveness of the use of
Telehomecare in CF are lacking.
VI.
FUTURE WORKS
Data on the real long-term effectiveness of the use of
Telehomecare in CF can only be obtained through a study of
controlled type, for which appear the time to be ripe to
format.
