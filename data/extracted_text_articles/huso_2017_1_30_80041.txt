Abstract—The pervasiveness of social media has resulted in
increased public involvement in key discussions about social
issues, as well as creating greater affordances for individual
expression and collective mobilisation. In December 2012, the
rape and murder of a 23-year-old Indian student in New Delhi,
India, was followed by widespread condemnation and public
action organised and coordinated through social media (Barn
2013). In March 2015, a controversial BBC documentary, “India’s
Daughter”, about the incident was broadcast despite restrictions
imposed by the Indian Government. This paper explores the
interplay between mainstream media (the so-called Fourth Estate)
and Twitter through a case study analysis using computational
techniques to analyse 250000 tweets collated following the broad-
cast of the documentary. In particular, we apply the theory of
postcolonialism to understand the dynamics of this interaction.
Issues around implications for conducting inter-disciplinary social
media research are also discussed.

INTRODUCTION
As the most populous democracy in the modern world,
India has witnessed an increasing growth in the use of the
internet in general, and social media in particular. Although
accurate statistics are difﬁcult to obtain, estimates of the micro-
blogging site of 140 characters, Twitter, range from 23 million
to 35 million [1]. This ﬁgure has more than doubled in the
last 3 years. According to a collective called ‘India on the
Internet 2014’, Twitter users in India total 35 million while
125 million people are on the social networking site (SNS),
Facebook. Further, it is estimated that almost 9 out of 10 web
users in India visit a social networking site. In a climate of
smart phones and their applications, and SNSs such a ﬁgure
is not so surprising. A core features of such social media sites
is their reliance on individual users for content creation and
active user involvement.
Twitter is notable in that it has rapidly become important
and popular as key tool for organising and generating commu-
nication for protestors around the world [2].
In addition to the organising and communicating aspects
of Twitter, researchers have also commented on how Twitter
and social media in general is also being used to reconstruct
and extend journalism and notions of what constitutes a
Habermasian public sphere [3], [4]. That is, the realm of social
life in which something approaching public opinion can be
formed and where access is guaranteed to all citizens. The
outcome is that networked individuals have the capacity to
use social media to enhance their role in news production
and dissemination to achieve a growing independence from
the Fourth Estate (mainstream media) [5].
In South Delhi, India, the 16 December 2012, rape and
murder of a 23 year old physiotherapy student by six men,
marked a watershed moment where some commentators asked
whether this heralded an ‘Indian Spring’ [6]. The street protests
across the nation in which social media was said to have played
a part were described by some as the new ‘unifying force’ [7]
through the formulation of a shared public opinion on social
media.
Several years after the Delhi rape, a BBC documentary
titled “India’s Daughter” was broadcast on 4 March 2015 in
the UK and on 8th March 2015 in New York. The broadcast of
the documentary directed by Leslee Udwin was controversial,
in that, the Indian Government sought to have it banned
and the BBC chose to bring forward the broadcast to an
earlier programme slot. Early indicators of the controversial
aspects of the documentary were immediately brought to the
foreground. These included: the extent to which mainstream
media occupied the so-called egalitarian and democratising
space of social media; the postcolonial texture of the debate
and the overall sense of how western media handled the
case under question. Twitter naturally formed predominant
backdrop to this broadcast given its initial role in mobilisation
of public opinion in the original 2012 event [6], [7], [8].
Within a context where the mainstream media and social
activists now largely occupy this micro-blogging space [7],
research that examines the interplay between mainstream me-
dia (Fourth Estate) and social media (so called Fifth Estate)
through speciﬁc case study instances can have public policy
implications. Hence, the research reported in this paper makes
a key analytical contribution of public reaction, through tweets,
to the broadcast of the documentary on the BBC in the UK
and on Youtube, Vimeo and other sources in India.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: In
Section 2, we outline key concepts and debate around post-
colonial theory given that postcolonialism was an important
emergent theme. Crucially, the historical relationship between
the two countries where the incident occurred and the ﬁlm
was shown provided a particular salience and backdrop to the
analysis of this paper. In Section 3, we present the aims and
details of the research methodology we have used. Section

4 presents overview results arising from the blog analysis
and computational analysis of the collected tweets. Section
5 entails a discussion of some tweets followed by commen-
tary on the validity of the results. Finally in Section 6, we
present concluding remarks and outline some further research
considerations.
II.
RELATED WORK AND UNDERPINNING THEORY
As noted earlier, Twitter is both important and popular
as key tool for organising and generating communication for
protestors around the world [2]. Examples of where Twitter
has played a signiﬁcant role include: the Iranian protests
of 2009-2010 [9], the so-called Egyptian revolution of 2011
[10] and also the various Occupy protests that took place
around the world [11]. It is also clear that that the messaging
technology is viewed differently depending upon temporality
and context. Hence, it is seen as subversive by autocratic
regimes, as well as a suitable technology for surveillance [12].
In an analysis of 104,059 tweets related to the Delhi rape
incident and social protests that took place across urban India,
in line with previous scholarship, Ahmed and Jaidka (2013)
conclude that traditional media still plays a pivotal role in
disseminating information [7]. For instance, the authors report
that less than 10% of the tweets were actually from ordinary
citizens / individuals. Such a ﬁnding certainly lends credence
to previous observations that have questioned the egalitarian,
and democratising promises of such space [13]. Questions also
arise as to whether a new public sphere is being reconstructed
where ordinary citizens really do have an opportunity to form
public opinion. Hence, it makes sense to also provide an
understanding of western media’s handling of the case under
question. This is particularly important to help ground the
response of the postcolonial society and to also more properly
explore the role of the impact of social media on public policy.
Over the last several decades, postcolonial theory has
emerged as a major intellectual critical approach. The theory is
generally regarded as having been founded on the contributions
of key writers including Frantz Fanon, Edward Said, Gaya-
tri Spivak, and Homi Bhabha. Primarily, postcolonial theory
seeks to problematise key historical and contemporary notions,
structures and processes including colonialism, race, ethnicity,
culture, racism, gender, identity, inequality, and globalisation.
In short, the theory seeks to ‘critique and aims to transcend the
structures supportive of Western colonialism and its legacie’
[14]. The watershed moment for the polemics of postcolo-
nialism was the publication of Edward Said’s Orientalism
in 1978 [15]. In Orientalism, Said meticulously brought out,
through close textual studies, the prejudices about and biases
against the non-West that informed the colonial discourse and
its meaning productions. He showed how the non-West or
the orient came to occupy the space of an exotic ‘Other’ in
the canon of Western knowledge and how this ‘orientalism’
as a discourse was responsible in justifying the colonial and
imperial projects of the Western powers. Postcolonialism,
therefore, became the rallying point to challenge the pre-
sumptions of Western knowledge systems, to comprehend the
epistemologies of the non-West, to create a space where, as
Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak puts it “the marginal can speak
and be spoken, even spoken for” [16]. Such an epistemo-
logical framework is indeed one of the key components of
postcolonial theory. Others include its critique of power in
the forms of economic/cultural/economic/political/ideological
domination (both historically and in the present time), its
stance on the processes of otherisation, and essentialism. In the
context of postcolonial theory, otherisation refers to a process
by which one group uses social and psychological means to
exclude or marginalise another group by focussing on differ-
ences. Whereas essentialism is understood to be the essence
or "whatness" of something. In postcolonialism, essentialism
implies the action of how a colonising power decides what is
and isn’t a particular identity. More often than not, differences
and/or commonalities between groups may be overlooked to
maintain a power relation.
Given this backdrop, in an examination of verbal and visual
texts in United States mainstream news media reporting of the
Delhi rape case, Durham argues that India / Third World is
‘represented as a primitive and undisciplined space populated
by savage males and subordinate women’ [17]. She further
asserts that in the geopolitics of sexual assault, the USA news
media reinscribed social geographies of power and sex in terms
of gender. Such an ethnocentric framework portrays the Third
World woman as oppressed and lacking in agency, and the
nation-state as incompetent and complicit in her subordination.
The mediated deployment of space and place and Delhi in
particular as the ‘rape capital’ of India serve as a key signiﬁer
of the political economy of gender and sexuality, and hence
the process of ranking one society over the other.
In her analysis of over 1500 USA mainstream news ar-
ticles published over a period of two months, following the
December 2012 rape incident, Roychowdhury (2013) argues
that through its coverage, the news reporting not only created
a polarity between the new and old India within a new-liberal
consumer world; but also stressed the ‘notions of Western
gender progressivism’ as evidenced through its language in-
cluding words such as ‘traditional societies’, ‘medieval’, ’rape
as a weapon of power against modernity’. Here, in spite of the
evidence on crimes of rape against women in the west, western
space with its so-called modern cosmopolitanism is presented
as safer for women. The December 2012 case is used as a
platform to present a dichotomy of the modern Indian woman
victim, and the backward / savage /misogynist brown man.
Roychowdhury cites Spivak‘s 1988 writings, and argues for its
ongoing appeal as witnessed in western media, that is, "white
men saving brown women from brown men." [18].
We use this texturised context of postcolonialism to exam-
ine the extent to which Spivak‘s theoretical framework can be
employed to explore the interaction between the Fourth Estate
and Twitter in the context of the BBC documentary, India’s
Daughter. Indeed, the broadcast of this Fourth Estate ﬁlm, and
its discussion on Twitter provides a useful anchor to extend
the postcolonial lens referred to by scholars, such as Durham
and Roychowdhury.

AIMS AND METHODS
In this study, our primary aim was focused on the interac-
tion between the Fourth Estate and Twitter. In doing this, we
sought to apply the theory of postcolonialism to understand
the dynamics of this interaction. Additional areas of interest
included an identiﬁcation and exploration of the debates and
discussion generated as a consequence of this controversial
BBC documentary. To this end, we employed a mixed-methods
approach to help understand the situation namely: a series of
12

HUSO 2017 : The Third International Conference on Human and Social Analytics

blogs written at the time of the broadcasting of the ﬁlm in
the UK, and USA in March 2015; and then the collection and
analysis of tweets over a period of 4 weeks (3 March 2015 - 3
April 2015). Notably, the ﬁlm was broadcast during this period
to coincide with International Women’s Week. The topicality
and contemporaneous nature of the study required drawing
upon those social media blogs, written within a week or so of
the broadcasting of the ﬁlm. The blogs were read and analysed
manually by two of the authors and led to the identiﬁcation of
the dominant themes used in the subsequent analysis. These
blogs constituted not only as part of our data collection, but
they were also useful in contextualising and in making sense
of our Twitter data. Sixteen blogs from prominent bloggers
were analysed. Most of the bloggers were female (11), and
only three were male. Two of the bloggers were unknown.
A key challenge in conducting social media based research
is the lack of standard approaches in appropriate methods
for data collection and analysis. This concern tends to be
further compounded by a limited range of integrated tools to
support research methods that can enable the full range of types
of analyses required. The Collaborative Online Social Media
Observatory (COSMOS) is an example of a distributed digital
social research platform that addresses these requirements [19].
However, at the time of this research, the tool was not readily
available and furthermore did not integrate with our efforts at
developing a learning set through manual analysis. Other tools
such as Prometheus is a peer-to-peer service that collects social
data from a number of sources and applies social inferencing
techniques, but it is mostly concerned with privacy-aware
social data management [20].
Given these concerns, we chose to access the Twitter data
stream using the published Twitter Application Programming
Interface (API) via our own bespoke software. Twitter offers
a streaming API that can be ﬁltered on keywords; in our case
we employed the following list: “IndiasDaughter”, “Leslee Ud-
win”, “Udwin” and “banbbc”. The script was kept running to
collect tweets that included the keywords from 3rd March 2015
to 3rd April 2015 following the broadcast of the documentary.
Over 254,000 tweets were collected amounting to around
1GB of data. Such a volume of data requires computational
approaches to analysis. Figure 1 provides an illustration of the
general steps in our method.
Figure 1. Method Overview.
Small scale analysis of tweets of say less than 10000 is rel-
atively straightforwardly done by human processing. Compu-
tational approaches provide additional insights that would not
necessarily be possible by manual analysis. Given the volume
of the tweet set, we were interested in several types of analysis.
These analytical tools included: Automatic categorisation: the
use of machine learning to categorise text or other data;
Sentiment analysis: the use of natural language processing and
text analysis to identify attitudes of a respondent with respect
to a topic; Geo-tagging: plotting the location information of
tweets on a map; and Social network analysis: the use of
network and graph theory to investigate social structures. We
discuss the use of the analytical tools below using the diagram
in Figure 1 to provide an overall context.

RESULTS
As indicated earlier, our research questions have centred
around several exploratory areas. The blogs, existing literature
and our own research questions prompted and inﬂuenced these
exploratory areas which would become coding categories in
our thematic analysis of the tweets.
A. Analysis of the Blogs: Emergent themes/categories
In the analysis of blogs from March 2015, several di-
vergences were identiﬁed. Firstly, some bloggers set out to
support the ban and to justify it [21]. Others proposed taking
a legal stand on the matter and argued that as the case is
still subjudice, the telecast should be postponed until such
time as the judgement is pronounced by the court, but in no
way supporting the ban [22]. Bloggers also chose to challenge
the ban, ask for it to be lifted immediately, and the telecast
to take place as per the schedule [23], [24]. Others took an
informed and critical stand, and commentated from various
perspectives such as feminism, postcolonialism or even with
India’s general use of "bans". Arguments for condemning
and supporting the ban in the same breadth were presented
[25], [23]. An analysis of the blogs helped generate a useful
framework that could be applied to our Twitter dataset. A total
of 7 prominent themes were identiﬁed. These included notions
of legality of broadcasting the documentary (Legality/Ban), the
postcolonial mindset of the ﬁlm and the response from others
(Postcolonialism), representations and discussions about the
lawyers involved (Lawyers), contemporary feminist thinking in
India (Feminism), the role of traditional media in discussions,
in this case BBC and NDTV (mainstream media), representa-
tions and discussions about the role of Government of India
(Government), and ﬁnally the role and value of punishment
(Punishment).
B. Categorisation of tweets
Thematic analysis or categorisation is a powerful qualita-
tive data analysis tool. The challenge is to deploy it for 1 GB of
data. We elected to use machine learning techniques and the
use of training sets. A random sample of 2000 tweets were
extracted from the tweet population and classiﬁed manually
against the categories listed above by two of the researchers.
Where there was discrepancy, discussion was used to agree
a ﬁnal classiﬁcation. This tweet set of 2000 tweets was used
as a "Training Set" to reﬁne / parameterise machine learning
algorithms which were then used on the entire tweet population
to categorise the 254K tweets. We partitioned the 2000 training
13

set using 3 folds. We used NTLK, a Python based toolkit for
natural language processing [26]. This software comes with an
open source library and toolkit for natural language processing
to do stemming and tokenisation, using all the words as
features. We have employed a Naive Bayesian classiﬁer to
build our model. The table in Figure 2 overleaf summarises
the categorisation results. This training set had around 72%
accuracy (manual versus automatic categorisation). This is
consistent with other research [27]. We ﬁnally applied the
model to the whole dataset of 254K tweets. Tweets related to
postcolonialism amounted to 26,816, representing 10.5% of the
overall total and the second largest of the analytical categories.
The largest category centred around tweets about legality and
banning of the broadcast. More importantly, the postcolonial-
ism tweets amounted to 23% of the tweets that were classiﬁed
against the desired classiﬁcations by the machine learning
algorithm. We used the ’Other’ category to denote discussion
that did not fall into the categories of interest.
C. Sentiment Analysis
The use of natural language processing and text analysis to
identify attitudes of a respondent with respect to a topic is a
popular analytical tool used in tweet analysis. Both the original
incident (through the brutality of the crime) and the subsequent
controversial aspects of the televised documentary generated
a wide range of emotions and efforts to assess the overall
sentiment was deemed appropriate. We used the open source
vaderSentiment0.5 tool [28] to conduct a sentiment analysis
of the tweet data set. VaderSentiment represents sentiments on
a scale from -1 to 1 representing negative sentiment at one
end (-1) and positive sentiment at the other end (1). When the
full set of tweets were subjected to a sentiment analysis using
VaderSentiment, we found that tweets related to postcolonial-
ism were ranked 3rd in association with negative sentiment.
The overall compound sentiments for all categorisations is
shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2. Automatic categorisation and overall sentiments.
D. Social Network Analysis
In this paper we are predominantly concerned with the
postcolonial texture of the debate surrounding the broadcasting
of the ﬁlm. Hence, social network analysis on the tweet
set associated with postcolonialism was conducted using two
open source social network analysis tools: NodeXL [29] and
Gephi [30]. The Postcolonialism tweet set (JSON ﬁle) was
transformed using bespoke scripts into a form readable by
NodeXL. In this data set, nodes are Twitter users and the edges
represent tweets that can either be retweets or mentions. This
data set was further cleaned by merging duplicate edges and
the addition of weights to reduce the edge count. NodeXL was
used primarily as a means for creating the GraphML format
for use in the visualisation within the Gephi toolset. Gephi is
better supported on MacOS and we were able to compute and
visualise various social network analysis descriptive statistics.
Within Gephi, the data set comprised 2000 nodes and 13243
undirected edges. Modularity computations were performed
on the network. These measured the strength of division of a
network into communities. We used the modularity algorithm
included in Gephi [31] and produced seven communities of
interest. Each of the top four communities (in size) were
centred around key Fourth Estate actors such as @BBC,
@NDTV @BDUTT, @BBCIndia and @TimesOf India. Also
apparent, was how these same 4th estate actors (i.e. traditional
media) were also ranked highly in a range of network centrality
measures such as Betweenness Centrality and Eigenvalue
centrality.
Degree Centrality is a measure of a node with respect
to its in-bound connections and its outbound connections. If
a node/actor receives many ties they are often regarded as
prominent or important. Nodes that have a high out-degree
are actors that are inﬂuential.
Betweenness Centrality is a measure of node that is based
on the extent to which a node falls on the geodesic paths
between other pairs of nodes in the network. In social network
analysis, nodes with a high value for betweenness centrality
are an indication of inﬂuence on information ﬂow in a network.
Hence a node with a high value is an important conduit for
information ﬂowing between nodes in the network.
Eigenvalue Centrality considers in-bound and out-bound
connections and also the node’s connection to other important
nodes. Hence, the measure is seen as an indicator of the power
of the node.
Tiryakian et al. note that "Individuals with high between-
ness centrality tend to be inﬂuential because they are well
informed and can affect the ﬂow of information in a network.
As a result, they are often information gatekeepers." [32].
For example, @BBC was top-ranked for both Eigenvector
(0.00929400), and Betweenness centrality (13556362.612). We
also observe that the use of Eigenvalue centrality to denote
power is open to debate and recent results have indicated that
in Twitter, users with high eigenvector centrality need not be
inﬂuential users [33]
The ﬁlm was shown in both USA and the UK of which the
latter has a postcolonial relationship. Analysis of geo-tagged
tweets was not considered meaningful given the low numbers
of geo-tagging. Other techniques such as automated analysis of
Twitter handle biographies would have been a potential route
for analysing how sentiments and other issues vary between
the countries where the ﬁlms where shown. Our future work
will incorporate such approaches.
Our results for the centrality statistics are shown in table 1.
These data are the non-normalised results. The top 25 results
are shown. From the table it is clear that there is considerable
overlap between the centrality measures of various nodes.
@BBC for example is the most powerful node in the network
and one with the highest betweenness measure. Several BBC
based Twitter accounts feature as important conduits for in-
formation ﬂow. Several of the nodes were Hindu nationalists,

DISCUSSION
Our results indicate that mainstream media appear to be
effective in utilising the communication spaces created by
social media. Thus, for example, the BBC and NDTV Twitter
accounts features in both measures in Table 1. However,
we can observe some impact of Fifth Estate through the
centrality measures observed for some inﬂuential bloggers
(@Sootradhar and @thekinshu) but noticeably not from those
bloggers who were perceived to have set the agenda through
their articles. The positioning of social media as a force for
dissemination and a viable growing independent "Fifth Estate"
as an alternative to mainstream media based journalism [34]
should be questioned.
The BBC ﬁnds mention in around 50% of the tweets
that were posted on the issue of the ban (categorised as
Postcolonialism), but there were very few tweets from the
various BBC ofﬁcial handles in that data set (<10). The BBC
World News, with the handle @BBCWorld, on the other hand
retweeted some of the tweets coming from @BBCIndia. These
include the following: @BBCIndia: Letter from Director of
BBC Television to Indian broadcast ministry on #IndiasDaugh-
ter. The letter that was attached to this tweet, was the one
written by Danny Cohen, the Director of Television at the
BBC, to the Joint secretary at the Ministry of Information and
Broadcasting, Government of India. The following quote from
the letter helps disambiguate the BBC’s position:
...We appreciate your concern but we feel India’s Daughter
has a strong public interest in raising awareness of a global
problem and the BBC is satisﬁed with the editorial standards
of the ﬁlm... The purpose of including the interview with the
perpetrator was to gain an insight into the mind-set of a rapist
with a view to understanding the wider problem of rape and
not just in India. [35]
Further, the letter goes on to make clear whilst there is a
notional respect for Indian legal jurisdiction, the BBC would
bring forward the broadcast of the documentary to an earlier
slot. Reasons are not given, and one possible inference is
potential legal action preventing the broadcast.
...It should be noted, although the BBC is happy to take
your views into consideration, we are not planning to transmit
the ﬁlm in any territory which lies under Indian legal jurisdic-
tion...after lengthy and careful consideration we have decided
to show India’s Daughter on BBC Four in the UK at 22:00
tonight. [35]
What is attempted in this letter has a direct bearing on
our postcolonial understanding, for it redraws the battle-lines
for this debate and depicts ‘rape’, the central issue of the
ﬁlm, as a global and not an India speciﬁc malaise. And in
so doing, it attempts to steer away from any alleged bias in
the representational politics despite the obvious conﬂation in
the title of the documentary which asserts a national identity
to the malaise of rape. The letter’s reference to jurisdiction
appears to underplay the ubiquity and reach of social media,
and seems to embolden the role of mainstream media. The
Twitter discussions amplify some of the positions identiﬁed
by the bloggers. Thus, Mehra notes:
There are many questions regarding why some sections of
the widely-read Western media are so obsessed with reporting
and analysing rapes in India while often conveniently ignoring

similarly grievous nature of the problem in their own back-
yards. and asks: Can you imagine if an Indian ﬁlm-maker
were to make a documentary on the thousands of cases of
sexual abuse and ‘grooming’ of young girls in Rotterham (sic)
between 1997-2013, and title it "Britain’s Daughter"? [36].
The blogs and tweets from other central nodes (including
bloggers and Hindu nationalists) not only accused BBC of
being prejudiced in their framing of the narrative, but also
came down upon the broadcaster for doing so at the expense
of not giving adequate attention to gruesome incidents and
issues at ‘home’. For example:
@YesIamSaffron How Many Documentaries ve u Seen
@BBC Reporting US Rapes or Biggest Child Exploitation
Scandals in UK? #BanBBC #UHF http://t.co/hglD7lfHOP (297
RTs)
@thekinshu Dear @lesleeudwin can you pl tell me why
you afraid to make a Documentary on your own Rape Case in
London.? #BanBBC
The above tweets demonstrate a strong dynamic of na-
tionalism, and the ‘other’ that portrays the BBC and the
documentary ﬁlm maker as an oppressive force. There is a
challenge to the claim made by the ‘other’ to be the holder
of morality, and superiority. Moreover, the ‘other’s’ stance on
human rights and gender is also questioned in highlighting its
own social problems. Crucially, the BBC and Leslee Udwin
serve to represent the Western ‘other’. In doing so, they
become emblematic of the UK, the ex-colonial power and its
representation of postcolonial India.
A remarkable anomaly was the hijacking of the debate
by the UK anti-muslim, right-wing party leader, Tony Robin-
son and how Hindu nationalist Twitter users used a tweet
(retweeted over 2000 times) from Tony Robinson for their own
ideological stance (see @YesIamSaffron above) bringing to the
foreground a curious postcolonial paradox.
@TRobinsonNewEra We are in the middle of the biggest
rape and child exploitation scandal in our countries history,
and the @BBC are focusing on india’s rapes (2078 RTs)
It would seem that networks and how power is transferred
through such networks appear to be structured by colonial and
national tensions and complicated by religion, and other social
divisions.
A. Threats to Validity
Internal validity issues centre around whether the micro
posts (tweets) are appropriately categorised by the machine
learning algorithms. Here, care was taken to use a manual
process of categorisation of 2000 randomly selected tweets
to help develop the training set for the machine learning
software. While there is conﬁdence that the categorisation has
operated at the reference 72% accuracy [27] it is noted that
a signiﬁcant percentage of tweets could not be automatically
categorised. Note, however, no claims on external validity
(wider generalisations to different domains) are being made.
Methodological notions of validity, reliability and repeata-
bility present a concern for much of social media research as
it is challenging to be deﬁnitive that data collected from social
media is actually representative of the phenomena of interest.
Twitter users commenting on a particular phenomena are self-
selecting. Such concerns can be partially mitigated by the use
of large scale analysis (using large data sets) but nonetheless
risks such as social media being generative of the behaviours
it aims to document are paramount [37]. A further concern
is related to decisions around treating journalists as individual
citizens or as part of the overall machinery of the Fourth Estate.
We view the latter as a more representative deﬁnition.
Social media research requires inter-disciplinary thinking,
but arriving at a common ground whereby a sociological theory
can be adequately expressed for computational purposes is an
ongoing research challenge [38].
Social network analysis, and in particular the centrality
measures can offer some insight about power diffusion in net-
works, but as noted earlier, are open to debate. Eigenvalue cen-
trality for example, unless correlated with inbound/outbound
data may not be a good indicator of power.
Furthermore, there are limited open source seamless soft-
ware tool chains that addressed the types of analyses that we
utilised. There are risks in moving data between software tools.
Importantly, we restrict our claims to the data that we have
collected and make no generalisations for other contexts.
The ethics of using data published in social media is also of
concern. The approach taken in this paper considers two key
dimensions, risks of identiﬁcation / disclosure to users and
ethical risks around the content of the micro-blogs. The data
collection (both the blogs and the tweets) are from users who
would be classiﬁed as low risk users as either the user is not
identiﬁable from a Twitter proﬁle or is from a public, ofﬁcial
or bot account. Ethical risks related to the content of the tweets
are also limited. While the content is at times provocative and
antagonistic, the classiﬁcation of the users as low risk does not
warrant opt in permissions before publication. Possibilities of
masking identities can address conﬁdentiality concerns, but it
is important to note that Twitter Terms and Conditions state
that tweets must be given in their original form and attributed
to the individual who posted the tweet. Furthermore, informed
consent becomes near impossible when dealing with data at
large scale. The dominant use of hashtags by Twitter users
also supports the notion that such users were broadcasting their
thoughts speciﬁcally on a subject in a public discussion [39].
VI.
CONCLUSION
Social media is becoming an important communication
channel in the modern world, however its role as a democratic
tool, its reach and therefore direct impact remain questionable
in terms of policy formation. The recent presidential election in
USA has certainly brought to the foreground, the role of social
media and the need for policy discussions [40]. Our study
shows that the traditional media and their components such as
individual journalists continue to play a central role in these
new spaces. The inﬂuence and reach of the ordinary citizen is
less well pronounced so it is uncertain that the so-called Fifth
Estate is really coming to the fore. Methodological concerns
remain challenging. For example, common grounds whereby
a sociological theory, for example, postcoloniality (as in this
paper) can be adequately expressed for computational purposes
remains an open question. Software tools that can support
both sociological reasoning and computational analysis in a
linked and coherent way has the potential to have a signiﬁcant
impact on addressing the issues of validity raised. Some of our
future research effort is directed at developing a software tool
