Abstract—Recently, the synchronized ﬂow trafﬁc pattern has
been found in empirical data of oversaturated city trafﬁc.
Trafﬁc simulation models based on classical theories cannot
reproduce synchronized ﬂow. We present simulation results based
on Kerner’s three-phase trafﬁc theory. By using a version of
the Kerner-Klenov stochastic microscopic trafﬁc ﬂow simulation
model, we are able to reproduce all trafﬁc patterns found
in city trafﬁc, including synchronized ﬂow. The key role in
understanding the emergence of synchronized ﬂow within the
model plays the driver’s speed adaptation effect.

INTRODUCTION
On an urban road with a trafﬁc signal various congested
trafﬁc patterns can be observed. The understanding of these
city trafﬁc phenomena is important for the development of
effective tools for trafﬁc management and intelligent trans-
portation systems.
There are two main types of city trafﬁc on multilane
roads at trafﬁc signals: under- and over-saturated trafﬁc. In
accordance with the classical theories [1][2][3][4][5][6], when
the ﬂow rate increases above some signal capacity value,
a transition from under- to over-saturated trafﬁc occurs. In
undersaturated trafﬁc, all vehicles, which are waiting within
a queue during the red phase, can pass the signal during
the green phase. An opposite case occurs in oversaturated
trafﬁc: some of the vehicles in the queue cannot pass the
signal location during the green phase resulting in the queue
growth (see Figure 1 (a, b)). In accordance with the classical
theories [1][2][3][4][5][6], well-developed oversaturated trafﬁc
consists of a sequence of moving queues with stopped vehicles
separated by regions in which vehicles move from one moving
queue to the adjacent downstream moving queue; the mean
duration of the vehicle stop within a moving queue does not
usually change while the moving queue propagates upstream
of the signal (see Figure 1 (c)).
Based on simulations in the framework of the three-phase
theory [7][8], Kerner et al. have recently predicted that in addi-
tion to classical sequences of moving queues (see Figure 1), in
oversaturated trafﬁc synchronized ﬂow pattern(s) (SP) should
also occur [9]. In comparison with [9], in this article we
make the following new developments: i) we simulate and
discuss single vehicle (microscopic) acceleration related to
synchronized ﬂow in oversaturated city trafﬁc and ii) we
make a briew comparison of simulated synchronized ﬂow with
empirical synchronized ﬂow revealed recently in measured
ﬁeld data in oversaturated city trafﬁc. For simulations of
spatiotemporal features of SPs in oversaturated trafﬁc we use
the Kerner-Klenov stochastic microscopic trafﬁc ﬂow model
[10][11][12] in the framework of Kerner’s three-phase theory.

II.
KERNER-KLENOV SIMULATION MODEL
Urban trafﬁc on a multilane road with a trafﬁc signal
at its end can either be oversaturad or undersaturated. In
undersaturated city trafﬁc all vehicles waiting in a queue in
front of a trafﬁc signal can pass the signal in the next green
light phase. In oversaturated city trafﬁc on the other hand,
not all vehicles can pass and therefore the queue of waiting
vehicles grows with each cycle of the signal. In classical
theories the oversaturated city trafﬁc consists of a series of
moving queues, sequences of stopped vehicles interrupted by
sequences of vehicles that move from one moving queue to
the next queue downstream. In general the duration of the
vehicle stop within a moving queue does not change in average
while the moving queue propagates upstream of the signal (see
Figure 1).
It is usually assumed [1][2][3][4][5][6] that the transition
from under- to over-saturated trafﬁc, i.e., trafﬁc breakdown
at the signal, occurs at a classical capacity of trafﬁc signal
Ccl = qsatT (eﬀ)
G
/ϑ, where qsat is the saturation ﬂow rate, i.e.,
the mean ﬂow rate from a queue at the signal during the green
phase when vehicles discharge from the moving queue to their
maximum free speed vfree. ϑ = TG + TY + TR is the cycle
time of the signal and assumed to be constant, TG, TY, and
TR are the durations of the green, yellow, and red phases of
the signal, respectively. T (eﬀ)
G
is the effective green phase time
that is the portion of the cycle time during which vehicles are
assumed to pass the signal at constant rate qsat.
Within anonymized vehicle probe data from oversaturated
city trafﬁc provided by TomTom, rather than this stop-and-
go pattern built by the moving queues, synchronized ﬂow
according to the three-phase trafﬁc theory by Kerner has been
found [13].

In contrast with two-phase trafﬁc ﬂow models with a
fundamental diagram (e.g., [14][15][16][17]), in the stochastic
model [10][11][12] used for all simulations, there is a 2D-
region of synchronized ﬂow associated with the fundamental
hypothesis of three-phase theory (see Figure 2) [7]. When
a driver approaches a slower moving preceding vehicle and
she/he cannot overtake it, then the driver begins to decelerate
and adapts its speed to the speed of the preceding vehicle,
when the gap g to the preceding vehicle becomes smaller than
a synchronization gap G (see Figure 2 (b)). This driver’s speed
adaptation occurs under condition gsafe ≤ g ≤ G, where gsafe
is a safe gap.
We use a discrete version of a stochastic three-phase
microscopic model of Kerner and Klenov [10][11][12]. The
physics of the model variables are explained in [7][8]. The
parameteres of the model have been adapted for city trafﬁc
in [18][19], the vehicle speed vn+1, the coordinate xn+1, and
the acceleration An+1 at time step n + 1 are found from the
following equations:

In the model, if a vehicle reaches the upstream front of
a moving queue at a signal it decelerates as it does at the
upstream front of a wide moving jam propagating on a road
without trafﬁc signals [7][8]. During the green light phase,
vehicles accelerate at the downstream front of the moving
queue (queue discharge) with a random time delay as they
do at the downstream jam front. During the yellow phase a
vehicle passes the signal location, if the vehicle can do it until
the end of the yellow phase; otherwise, the vehicle comes to
a stop at the signal.
A key role in the simulation of synchronized ﬂow plays
the driver’s speed adaptation for which we use a stochastic
description through the probabilities p1 and p2 in (12). We
write these probabilities as follows:
p1 = min(1, (1 + ε)p(0)
1 ),
p2 = min(1, (1 + ε)p(0)
2 (vn)),
(21)
where p(0)
1
= 0.3, p(0)
2 (vn) = 0.48 + 0.32Θ(vn − v21), ε is
the coefﬁcient of speed adaptation. The larger ε, the stronger
the speed adaptation and, therefore, the larger the mean space
gap (the longer the mean time headway) between vehicles in
synchronized ﬂow. This can be explained as follows.
If on a multilane road a driver approaches a slower moving
vehicle in front and if he cannot change lane, e.g., because
of trafﬁc on the other lane not permitting a sufﬁcient safety
gap for a lane change, than the driver has to decelerate. In
the model he can start to decelerate as soon as he enters the
synchronization gap to his leader. The driver will decelerate
if his distance to the leader becomes smaller than the safety
gap, and he will accelerate if the distance becomes greater than
the synchronization gap (see Figure 2 (b)). But in contrast to
models based on classical theories, in three-phase trafﬁc ﬂow
models a vehicle doesn’t try to abide to a speciﬁc distance to
the preceeding car, usually the safety gap. Instead, the vehicle
tends to adapt its speed to the speed of the preceeding car, but
it will do this while taking an arbitrary distance to it as long
as it stays within the synchronization gap.
Therefore, the driver could decelerate gradually to the
speed of the leader as soon as he enters the synchronization
gap, which would lead to a short headway to the preceeding
vehicle (see Figure 3 (a)). This situation, described with ε = 0,
is called usual or weak speed adaptation and leads to the
classical behaviour of stop-and-go trafﬁc: the mean duration
of the stops of the vehicles remain almost constant along
the moving queues that build upstream of the signal [9].
Alternatively, the driver can decelerate more sharply when
reaching the synchronization gap distance, which would lead to
a large headway to the preceeding vehicle (see Figure 3 (b)).

Figure 3. Explanation of speed adaptation effect: Weak speed adaptation (a)
and strong speed adaptation (b).
This situation, described with ε > 0, is called strong speed
adaptation and leads to the behaviour that cannot be described
by classical theories: the mean duration of the stops of the
vehicles decreases the further upstream of the trafﬁc signal the
moving queue is located [9]. The growth of the space gap leads
to the dissolution of the jam upstream of the trafﬁc signal. So
in oversaturated city trafﬁc adjacent to the trafﬁc signal there
is still the classical stop-and-go behaviour of the vehicles, but
further away from the signal synchronized ﬂow emerges due
the dissolution of the jam.
III.
SYNCHRONIZED FLOW IN CITY TRAFFIC
For the simulation of synchronized ﬂow in urban trafﬁc we
use a multilane road with a trafﬁc signal at the end. We chose
a road section of V¨olklinger Straße in the city of D¨usseldorf
(see Figure 4) as congested trafﬁc is observed here regularly
in the data of a stationary video detector [13]. The length of
the section is 630 m, the speed limit is 60 km/h, and there are
no junctions in between.
A. Empirical ﬁndings
Figure 5 shows typical examples of anonymized empirical
vehicle probe data provided by TomTom, the dotted (red) line
denotes the point in time at which the vehicles pass the position
of the trafﬁc signal. Figure 5 (a) shows the velocity proﬁle of
a vehicle driving on V¨olklinger Straße in the morning rush
hour, exhibiting the classical moving queue pattern in front of
a trafﬁc signal in oversaturated city trafﬁc.
Figure 5 (b) shows an example of a velocity proﬁle in
the synchronized ﬂow phase in the late morning rush hour:
the vehicle at ﬁrst drives with a speed between 20 km/h and
30 km/h without coming to a stop. Then as it moves further
down the road it has to decelerate to a full stop about 100 m

in front of the trafﬁc signal as it reaches the upstream front
of the queue. In accordance with the microscopic criteria
for trafﬁc phases in congested trafﬁc [7][8], this is a typical
empirical example of synchronized ﬂow in oversaturated city
trafﬁc. Following classical theories one would expect either a
stop-and-go pattern along the road, or a higher speed at the
beginning of the section followed by one or more stops in front
of the trafﬁc signal.
Finally, Figure 5 (c) shows an example of a vehicle driving
through heavy congested trafﬁc: the travel time for the 630
meters of V¨olklinger Straße is about 12 minutes.
B. Simulation of synchronized ﬂow
For our simulations we used infrastructure information
from OpenStreetMap [20] that was improved by the use of
infrastructure plans from the city of D¨usseldorf that also
provided the trafﬁc signal cycle plans. The amount of vehicles
emitted per minute into the simulation was matched to the
data of the video detector at the beginning of the road. In all
simulations we use the following parameters of model ((1)–
(21)): τsafe = τ = 1, d = 7.5 m, vfree = 18.0558ms−1
(65 km/h), b = 1 ms−2, a = 0.5 ms−2, k = 3, φ0 = 1,
∆va = 2 ms−1, ka = 4, γ = 1, pb = 0.1, pa = 0.03,

0.005, p0(vn)
=
0.667 + 0.083 min (1, vn/v01),
v01 = 6 ms−1, v21 = 7 ms−1, a(a) = a, a(0) = 0.2a,
a(b)(vn) = 0.2a + 0.8a max(0, min(1, (v22 − vn)/∆v22),
v22 = 7 ms−1, ∆v22 = 2 ms−1, ε = 0. Open boundary
conditions have been used in all simulations.
Figure 6 (a) shows the speed proﬁle of a vehicle driving in
free ﬂow, and Figure 6 (b) shows the according acceleration
proﬁle: after entering the road section, the vehicle drives
(nearly) at maximum speed at ﬁrst. Then it decelerates and
comes to a stop in front of the trafﬁc signal. In the next
green light phase it passes the trafﬁc signal position and again
accelerates to maximum speed. This is a typical simulation
example for the situation of undersaturated city trafﬁc. Since
we describe free ﬂow, the speed adaptation effect doesn’t come
into it.
Figures 7 (a) and (b) show the speed and acceleration
proﬁle of a vehicle driving in synchronized ﬂow. The pattern
is very similar to the one found in the empirical data (see
Figure 5 (b)): the vehicle ﬁrst drives with a speed between
10 km/h and 20 km/h. As it moves further down the road it
ﬁrst decelerates to a full stop at the end of the queue in front
of the trafﬁc signal and then a second time about 20 seconds

later within the queue. This is an example of synchronized
ﬂow pattern reproduced in the simulation.
Finally, Figures 8 (a) and (b) show the speed and acceler-
ation proﬁle of a vehicle driving in heavily congested trafﬁc.
The vehicle is following a typical stop-and-go pattern along
the entire strech of the road up to the position of the trafﬁc
signal.
All simulation results shown above are representatives of
trafﬁc patterns that were found in the empirical data. This
demonstrates that we can reconstruct in our simulations the
urban trafﬁc patterns known from classical theories like stop-
and-go trafﬁc, as well as synchronized trafﬁc that is unknown
to classical theories but found in real data. By alternating the
strength of the speed adaptation effect we can reproduce all
trafﬁc patterns found in the empirical data for synchronized
ﬂow.
As described in Section II, the stronger the speed adapta-
tion effect, the larger the space gap (time headway) that a driver
chooses on average to the preceeding vehicle. Since the drivers
in this case have enough space in front and can decelerate
gradually, they come to a stop less often and therefore the

mean stop duration of the vehicle within the moving queue
decreases. As a result, the absolute value of the upstream front
velocity of a moving queue becomes smaller than that of the
downstream front of the moving queue, resulting in moving
queue dissolution. The moving queues dissolve into the syn-
chronized ﬂow phase. The strength of the speed adaptation
effect inﬂuences the distance from the trafﬁc signal, at which
the moving queues dissolve. The greater ε, the shorter the
distance from the trafﬁc signals at which the moving queues
dissolve [9].

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Empirical probe vehicle data measured by TomTom nav-
igation devices show synchronized ﬂow in oversaturated city
trafﬁc [13]. We have simulated oversaturated city trafﬁc with
the discrete stochastic microscopic Kerner-Klenov three-phase
trafﬁc ﬂow model. The simulations show that under strong
speed adaptation synchronized ﬂow patterns which are very
close to empirical data can be reproduced with this model.
Strong speed adaptation is associated with an average increase
of space gaps (time headways) which drivers choose moving in
very dense city trafﬁc. The stronger the speed adaptation effect,
the shorter the distance at which moving queues dissolve into
synchronized ﬂow. Further work will include the evaluation
of the strength of the speed adaptation effect as well as
comparisons to more empirical examples.
