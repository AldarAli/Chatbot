 INTRODUCTION 
Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) are specialized devices 
designed to implement digital signal processing algorithms 
on a stream of digitized signals.  The highly competitive 
nature of the wireless communications market and constantly 
evolving communication standards have resulted in short 
design cycles and product lifetimes. This environment has 
led to the emergence of a new class of configurable DSPs, 
which can leverage hardware flexibility, programmability, 
and reusability, to provide highly customizable DSP 
solutions [1]. In the recent past, telecommunications 
techniques have achieved a wide popularity, mainly due to 
the huge diffusion of cellular phones and wireless devices. 
The request for more complex and complete services, such 
as high speed data transmission and multimedia content 
streaming, has moved many research groups in the electronic 
field towards the study of new and efficient algorithms, 
codes and modulations. In Software Defined Radios, most 
radio receiver processing functions are to be run on a general 
purpose 
programmable 
processor 
rather 
than 
being 
implemented strictly on non-programmable hardware. The 
functionality of SDR receiver processor can be changed via 
“software reprogramming.” The concept of SDR is now an 
IEEE Standard, i.e., IEEE P1900 [2]. These radios are 
reconfigurable through software updates. For high end digital 
signal processing where the highest possible performance is 
needed at low power consumption, Application Specific 
Integrated Circuits (ASICs) are still the processors of choice. 
However, ASICs require very long design and development 
times and are very expensive to design and manufacture. 
Moreover, ASICs are inherently rigid and are not very well 
suited to applications that are constantly evolving. For these 
reasons, 
Programmable 
Logic 
Device 
like 
Field 
Programmable Gate Arrays have emerged as an alternative 
to ASICs in wireless communication systems. 
 
FPGAs are mainly used for the flexibility they provide. 
Like programmable DSPs, FPGAs are programmed and 
configured in software. This makes it very easy to upgrade or 
add functionality to an FPGA, even if it is already deployed 
in the field. Like ASICs, FPGAs achieve high levels of 
performance by implementing complex algorithms in 
hardware. FPGAs are particularly well suited for accelerating 
algorithms that exhibit a high degree of data flow 
parallelism. The FPGAs suffer from the drawbacks of 
inefficient resource utilization, high cost and power 
consumption [3]. The cost factor can be improved by using 
less expensive FPGAs for system design and by efficient 
utilization of FPGA resources. The power factor can be 
improved by optimal usage of SRAM based programming 
interconnections. With increasing demand of battery 
dependent devices, methods for reduction of the power 
consumption of the memory blocks have received significant 
interest. Six transistor SRAM cells are preferred for many 
applications because of its high speed and robustness. The 
rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section II presents 
the design specifications of Wideband Code Division 
Multiple Access (WCDMA) DDC and related state of the art 
design approaches. Section III shows design simulations and 
structures. Hardware implementation with area and speed 
comparison is in Section IV and we conclude in Section V.

DIGITAL DOWN CONVERTER 
The SDR system can change its radio functions by 
swapping software instead of replacing hardware, which 
seems to be the best solution given that mobile standards are 
springing up like mushrooms [5]. SDR thereby makes it 
possible to reprogram cell phones to operate on different 
radio interface standards. But that’s not all. Putting much of 
a radio’s functionality in software opens up other benefits. A 
mobile SDR device can cope with the unpredictable dynamic

characteristics of highly variable wireless links [6]. SDRs 
use a single hardware front end but can change their 
frequency of operation, occupied bandwidth, and adherence 
to various wireless standards by calling various software 
algorithms. Such a solution allows inexpensive, efficient 
interoperability between the available standards and 
frequency bands [7]. Fig. 1 illustrates SDR Base Station (BS) 
receiver that consists of two sections – a front-end high-data 
rate processing section and a back-end symbol rate or chip-
rate processing section. 
 
 
  
Figure 1. Reconfigurable SDR BS Receiver 
 
Reconfigurable 
architectures 
provide 
flexible 
and 
integrated system-on-chip solutions that accommodate 
smooth migration from archaic to innovative designs, 
allowing recycling of hardware resources across multiple 
generations of the standards [8]. SDR technology enables 
such functionality in wireless devices by using a 
reconfigurable hardware platform across multiple standards. 
Sampling rate converters play important role in SDR systems 
[9]. Digital up-converters (DUCs) and digital down-
converters (DDCs) are important components of every 
modern wireless base station design. DUCs are typically 
used in digital transmitters to filter up-sample and modulate 
signals from baseband to the carrier frequency [10]-[12]. 
DDCs, on the other hand, reside in the digital receivers to 
demodulate, filter, and down-sample the signal to baseband 
so that further processing on the received signal can be done 
at lower sampling frequencies. They are more popular than 
their analogue counterparts because of small size, low power 
consumption and accurate performance [13]-[17]. 
DDC performs decimation and matched filtering to 
remove adjacent channels and maximize the received signal-
to-noise ratio (SNR) [18]. For the reference WCDMA DDC 
design, the carrier bandwidth is equal to 5.0 MHz, the 
number of carriers is 1, intermediate frequency (IF) sample 
rate is equal to 61.44 MSPS, the DDC output rate is 7.68 
MSPS, the input precision equals 14 bits, the output 
precision equals 16 bits and the mixer resolution is 0.25 Hz 
approximately and SFDR up to 115 dB is required.  
The DDC input is assumed to be real, directly coming 
from the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC). The mixer 
translates the real band pass input signal from intermediate 
frequency to a complex baseband signal centered at 0 Hz. 
Mathematically, the real input signal is multiplied by a 
complex exponential to produce a complex output signal 
with real and imaginary components. The sinusoidal 
waveforms required to perform the mixing process are 
obtained by using the Direct Digital Synthesizer (DDS). The 
decimators in the DDC need to down sample the IF data 
from 61.44 MHz back to 2x chip rate. The factor of 
61.44/7.68 = 8 can be partitioned using different possible 
configurations. The down sampling by eight at once will 
result in an extremely long filter length and result in an 
inefficient hardware implementation. The use of shaping 
filter with decimation factor of 2 allows the remaining stages 
to be implemented as either one half band filter with 
decimation factor of 4 or two half band filters with 
decimation factor of 2 each. The second configuration is 
more suitable for hardware implementation because of less 
hardware consumption [19]-[21]. The existing designs suffer 
from the limitations that their implementation is based on 
Xilinx FIR compiler blocks and DDS compiler blocks which 
are based on DSP 48E/A slices. The DSP 48 E/A slice based 
FPGAs are costly as compared to multiplier based FPGAs 
and results in costly design implementation. So there is great 
necessity to implement DDC design on multiplier based low 
cost FPGA to provide an economically optimized solution in 
terms of area and speed, which is presented in following 
sections. 
III. 
PROPOSED DDC 
An efficient DDC is designed for WCDMA applications. 
The proposed DDC design is using three decimator stages. 
The input sample rate of first decimator is 61.44 MSPS, and 
the output sample rate is 30.72 MSPS. The pass band 
frequency is 2.34 MHz and the pass band ripple is 0.002 dB. 
It results in a digital filter of order 10 whose response is 
shown in Fig. 2.

multipliers in partially serial style using MAC algorithm to 
optimize both speed and area factor simultaneously. The 
input pipeline registers are used to store the new coefficient 
values required for processing in the next cycle to further 
enhance the speed. The Cascade Enable (CE) delays are 
used to synchronize between stage 1 and stage 2. The pass

ripple is 0.0001 dB. It results in a digital filter of order 18,

store the new coefficient values required for processing in

the next cycle to enhance the speed further. The CE delays 
are used to make synchronization between stage 2 and stage 
3. The next stage RRC filter is used for sampling rate 
conversion from 15.36 MSPS to 7.68 MSPS. This 2x over-
sampling rate is needed in the timing recovery process to 
avoid the signal loss due to the sampling point 
misalignment. Root Raised Cosine (RRC) filter is designed 
with 1.92 MHz cut off frequency, 0.22 MHz roll-off factor 
and 50 dB side lobe attenuation using Chebyshev window 
[20] whose filter response is shown in Fig. 6. The third 
stage RRC decimator has also been designed using partially 
serial architecture as shown in Fig. 7.

The 61 coefficients required to design this RRC filter 
have been processed using 38 multipliers to improve both 
area and speed. The delay pipelining and output registers are 
used for synchronization. Finally, DDC is designed by 
cascading these three stages as shown in Figure 8 with 16 
bit coefficients. The cascade of all optimized stages is 
shown in Fig. 9. 
IV. 
H/W SYNTHESIS & SIMULATION 
In the proposed DDC designs CORDIC algorithm based 
optimized DDS design is used in place of DDS compiler 
block to generate sinusoidal waveform needed for frequency 
translation [22]. The FIR Compiler blocks of existing 
designs are replaced by Equiripple techniques based 
decimators for optimal filter length to reduce the hardware 
requirement. It is further supported by the half band filter 
concept to improve the computational complexity for 
enhanced speed. Finally, the poly-phase decomposition 
technique is utilized in the hardware implementation of the 
proposed design to optimize both speed and area together by 
introducing the partially serial pipelined MAC architecture. 
The third stage of decimation has been developed using 
efficient RRC filter [23] design. All the decimators are 
implemented using MAC Algorithm with optimal number 
of embedded multipliers of target FPGA along with 
pipelined registers to enhance the speed performance and 
resource utilization. The Virtex-II Pro FPGA device is used 
for implementation that contains 136 embedded multipliers 
[24].  
Two designs have been developed using different input 
output precisions. DDC is implemented using input 
precision of 14 bits and output precision of 16 bit and DDC 
2 is implemented using input and output precision of 12 
bits. The developed DDCs are simulated using Modelsim 
Simulator. The output response of DDC1 is shown in Fig. 
10 and output response of DDC 2 is shown in Fig. 11. It can 
be observed from the simulated waveforms that the output 
response of both the designs is similar but speed 
performance of DDC2 is better as compared to DDC1.

    The optimized DDC designs are finally mapped for 
hardware implementation and synthesised on Virtex-II Pro 
based 
xc2vp30-7ff896 
target 
device. 
The 
resource

     The proposed optimized DDC 2 can operate at a 
maximum frequency of 146.36 MHz and DDC 1 can 
operate at 119 MHz as compared to 122.88 MHz in case of 
[20]. So the proposed DDC 2 provides an improvement of 
19% in speed and DDC 1 provides almost the same speed as 
that of the existing DDC design. The developed DDC 
designs have shown better resource utilization as compared 
to DDC design of [21] which is shown in Table II.

CONCLUSION 
This paper presents an efficient and cost effective DDC 
design for software defined radios. The existing DDC 
designs suffer from the drawback of cost effectiveness 
because their implementation includes DSP 48E slice based 
Virtex 4 and Virtex 5 FPGAs. The proposed DDC designs 
are developed and implemented on multiplier based Virtex II 
Pro target FPGA using optimized MAC algorithm. Three 
decimator stages are optimized separately and then cascaded 
together. The optimized DDC has been developed using 
partially serial pipelined MAC algorithm for area and speed 
optimization. The DDC designs are efficiently floor planned 
and routed to achieve the desired timing constraints. The 
developed DUCs have shown improved speed performance 
and resource utilization to provide cost effective solution for 
software radios.
