Abstract–Interference coordination methods for Evolved-
Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (E-MBMS) in Long-
Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) are presented. In this 
paper, OFDM/OFDMA signals based on LTE parameters are 
combined with Multipoint MIMO, Turbo codes and signal 
space diversity methods. Different interference coordination 
techniques, such as, Multipoint MIMO coordination, Fixed 
Relay stations, adaptive frequency reuse and schedulers are 
considered to evaluate the E-MBMS spectral efficiency at the 
cell borders.  
The system level coverage and throughput gains of 
Multipoint MIMO system with hierarchical constellations and 
Turbo-codes are simulated associated to the presence or not of 
fixed relays and measuring the maximum spectral efficiencies 
at cell borders of single cell point-to-multipoint or single 
frequency network topologies. The influence of the relay 
transmission power and cell radius in the performance of the 
previous cellular topologies is also evaluated.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) considers a 
series of new transmission technologies, such as, 
coordinated multipoint transmission and reception or relay 
and carrier aggregation, in order to meet the high technical 
and service requirements of IMT-Advanced standards. 
Those requirements include amongst others, peak data rate 
up to 100Mbps in high speed mobility environment and 1 
Gbps in a pedestrian environment, using increased spectral 
flexibility that allows bandwidth allocation between 20MHz 
and 100MHz. The LTE standard is the basic standard that 
paves the way for the future 4th Generation (4G) wireless 
networks, as stated in [1]. 
The Evolved - Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service 
(E-MBMS) framework [2] is envisaged to play an essential 
role for the LTE-A proliferation in mobile environments. E-
MBMS constitutes the evolutionary successor of MBMS, 
which was introduced in the Release 6 of Universal Mobile 
Telecommunication System (UMTS). With E-MBMS the 
mass provision of multimedia applications to mobile users 
will be a reality. 
Point-to-Multipoint (PTM) transmission does not 
employ feedback and therefore need to be statically 
configured to provide desired coverage in the cell since, 
transmitted signal is lowest at the cell border. However, 
when close to cell borders, the PTM bearer can greatly 
benefit from exploiting also the signals from adjacent cells 
transmitting the same service, i.e., from soft-combining. 
Two types of Evolved-MBMS transmission scenarios 
exist:  
1) Multi-cell transmission (MBSFN: Multi-Media 
Broadcast over a Single Frequency Network) on a dedicated 
frequency layer or on a shared frequency layer  
2) Single-cell transmission (SCPTM: Single Cell Point 
to Multipoint) on a shared frequency layer.  
Inter-cell interference co-ordination is one method here 
considered which is expected to improve coverage and 
increase cell-edge bitrate [3]. Inter-cell interference co-
ordination techniques, such as reuse schemes and channel 
allocation, has been studied thoroughly for circuit switched 
services in second generation accesses [4]. 
Cooperative multiple input multiple output (MIMO) and 
Fixed Relays are other emerging techniques to combat 
inter-cell interference and improve cell edge performance 
[5].  
Sharing data and channel state information among 
neighboring base stations (BSs) allows them to coordinate 
their transmissions in the downlink and jointly process the 
received signals in the uplink. Cooperative MIMO 
techniques can effectively turn inter-cell interference into 
useful signals, allowing significant power and diversity 
gains to be exploited. The architecture of the high-speed 
backbone enables the exchange of information (data and 
control information) between the BSs. Cooperative MIMO 
systems are only concerned with the BS to mobile station 
(MS) channel which are PTM channels. 
We 
consider 
Orthogonal 
Frequency 
 
Division 
Multiplexing / Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple 
Access (OFDM/OFDMA) where the use of Turbo codes in 
combination with Multipoint MIMO and Complex Rotation 
Matrices (CRM) [6][7] are applied to OFDM/OFDMA and 
exploited to achieve spatial and frequency diversity gains in 
LTE-A networks.  
The work of this paper is based on previous work 
carried out by the authors. In chapter 6 of [8] the authors 
have considered multi-resolution techniques for MBMS 
considering both WCDMA and OFDMA. In chapter 16 of 
[9] the authors have considered the capacity and inter-site 
gains of LTE E-MBMS. In this paper we have extended

that work including MIMO, CRM and Relays in the LTE E-
MBMS network and have evaluated by system simulations 
the coverage and throughput performance. To the best of 
the authors’ knowledge, up to now there are no work in the 
literature that investigated the performance and benefits of 
such cellular OFDMA system that incorporates multi-point 
coordinated MIMO, turbo codes, CRM, hierarchical 
constellations and low power fixed relay stations. 
Section II introduces the coordinated MIMO and 
coordinated interference schemes. In Section III, the 
performance curves of system level simulations are 
presented. Conclusions are drawn in Section IV.

II. COORDINATED MIMO AND INTERFERENCE SCHEMES 
With MIMO cooperative systems [10][11] there is an 
important reduction of inter-cell interference in the area 
where the SISO/MIMO cooperative system exists. In LTE 
the BS is denoted as evolved-NodeB (eNB) and 
concentrates in it functionalities like radio resource 
managing, radio link control, interference coordination, 
mobility control, etc. The communication between eNBs is 
made through the X2 interface, and each adjacent eNB is 
interconnected to each other (mesh network). This feature 
eases the implementation of MIMO cooperative systems by 
reducing the interference as the same content can be 
transmitted to mobiles from different antennas (eNBs) at 
the same physical resource block. 
Figure 1 illustrates the Fixed Relays stations (RSs). RSs 
are low cost fixed radio infrastructures without wired 
backhaul connections. They store data received from BS 
and forward to the MSs, and vice-versa. Fixed relay stations 
(RSs) typically have smaller transmission powers and 
coverage areas than BSs. They enhance the capacity at 
specific regions, namely, cell borders, improving signal 
reception. By combining the signals from RSs and BSs, the 
MS is able to exploit the inherent diversity of the relay 
channel (see Figure 1). The disadvantages of RSs are the 
additional delays introduced in the relaying process and the 
potentially increased levels of interference due to frequency 
reuse. 
Without any inter-cell interference co-ordination each 
sector of the cell has unlimited access to the whole 
bandwidth; this is reuse 1. Any inter-cell interference co-
ordination scheme will restrict the resources available for 
scheduling. By limiting the (maximum) output power as a 
function of frequency and/or time, Pmax(f,t). We will limit 
the power Pmax both in time (sub-frame duration) and on 
frequencies f in a planned scheme on sectors of cells. A 
pure fractional frequency reuse 1/3 is achieved by dividing 
the frequencies into three subsets f1, f2 and f3 and limiting 
the power by setting

for each sector of the cell. With reuse partitioning [12] the 
spectrum is first divided into partitions and then each 
partition into the desired number of reuse subsets. The 
scheduler can then utilize the partitions depending on 
mobile radio position, based on path loss measurements. A 
reuse partition with a mixture of reuse 1 and 1/3 is achieved 
by dividing the frequencies into two partitions, fA and fB, 
where fB further is divided into three resulting in four 
subsets, fA, fB1, fB2 and fB3. The power limitation for the 
fractional reuse subsets fBn is set as above described. 
Soft reuse [13] (hybrid reuse partitioning) is a variant of 
reuse partitioning where a tighter reuse is achieved by using 
the same frequencies in more than one partition (fA=fB) but 
with different power levels. If we apply to the fractional 1/3 
reuse example, then we limit the power by setting

Figure 2 illustrates the cellular layout (tri-sectored 
antenna pattern) indicating the fractional frequency reuse of 
1/3 considered in the system level simulations. 1/3 of the 
available bandwidth was used in each sector to reduce the 
multi-cell interference. As indicated in Figure 2, the 
identification of the sources of multi-cell interference, i.e., 
the use of the same adjacent sub-carriers (named physical 
resource blocks) is given by the sectors with the same 
colour, green, yellow and pink. The small blue hexagons 
refer to the area where reuse 1 co-exists with the fractional 
reuse of 1/3 as an example of soft reuse.  
In the analysis of the scenario Single-Cell Point-to-
Multipoint (SC-PTM) there is one radio link between the 
mobile and the closest base station. It does not assume any 
time synchronism between the transmissions from different 
base stations with the same colour resulting in interference 
from all cells without the same colour. However, an 
adaptation of this scenario can include macro-diversity to 
help reduce interference levels. This can be accomplished 
by combining the two best radio links from surrounding 
BSs. In this case, time synchronization between the two 
closest base station sites with the same colour (i.e. 
transmitting in the same frequency) is assumed in order to 
combine them at the receiver using soft-combining 
techniques. Multi-cell interference is reduced because only 
the other base station sites with the same colour remain un-
synchronous and capable to interfere. 
In the MBSFN scenario there are at least three radio 
links, one for each of the three closest base stations to the 
mobile. Time synchronism is assumed between the 
transmissions from the closest base stations with the same 
colour resulting in much less interference from the cellular 
environment. This results in macro-diversity combining of 
the three best radio links.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS 
To study the behavior of the proposed scheme, several 
Monte Carlo simulations were performed in the link level 
simulation. This study is valid for any OFDM system and it 
was performed using the LTE parameters mentioned 3GPP 
documents [14] for a 10MHz bandwidth, which are shown 
in Table I. The reference link level parameter for all 
simulation results (SISO and MIMO) presented in this 
paper is BLER=0.01. This reference applies to near real 
time services where retransmissions are not allowed. Two 
different coding rates 1/2 and 3/4 where chosen to check 
which one would offer the highest average spectral 
efficiency for the analyzed SC-PTM and MBSFN 
topologies. The path loss uses 3GPP distance attenuation 
formula in Table I, and the distance d, is the distance 
between the actual geographic location of the user and the 
BS to which it has a radio link established with the best 
signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) as the 
selection criteria. Small and large scale fading are also 
included in the system level simulator, according to the 
parameters of Table I.

Coverage Results 
In the system level simulations mobile users receive 
blocks of bits transmitted from base stations and each block 
undergoes small and large scale fading and multi-cell 
interference. In terms of coverage or throughput the SINR 
of each block is computed taking into account all the above 
impairments and based on the comparison between the 
reference SINR at a BLER of 1%, and the evaluated SINR 
it is decided whether the block is or not correctly received. 
Figure 3 presents the coverage vs. the fraction of the 
total transmitted power (denoted as Ec/Ior), for hierarchical 
64QAM (64-HQAM), coding rate 1/2 and SC-PTM 
scenario where different frequency reuse, namely, 1/3, 1 
and hybrid 1+1/3 consisting of reuse 1 for users inside DR 
and reuse 1/3 for users outside DR (see Figure 2) is 
evaluated. All interfering sites transmit with the maximum 
power of 90% according to the parameters indicated in 
Table I. The cell radius R is 2250m, and strong blocks (H1) 
are separated from medium blocks (H2) and weak blocks 
(H3) without macro-diversity combining, denoted as 1RL. 
In addition, fixed relay with two different transmission 
powers, 10W and 2.5W are also illustrated (TD in the 
legend). 
 
 
Figure 3. Coverage vs Ec/Ior SC-PTM (1RL) scenario, 
64-HQAM, coding rate ½, R=2250m 
With reuse 1/3, the base stations of the topology 
including fixed relays (FR) with TD=2.5W, provide the 
highest coverage (considering the coverage provided by 
BSs and RSs) followed by the topology with FR of 
TD=10W, the smallest coverage belongs to reuse 1. 
However, only reuse 1/3 with TD=2.5W is close to the 
reference value of 95% coverage. This is explained because 
the use of RSs allows the system to extend the coverage of 
BSs (especially at cell borders, see figure 7) without 
significant increase in intercell interference since RSs 
transmit with only 2.5W compared to 40W used by BSs. 
Depending on the value of transmitted power a cell area 
with different radius was considered. For TD=10W, the 
radius 
is 
R_relay=1500m 
and 
if 
TD=2.5W, 
R_relay=1000m. The results of Figures include the two R-
relay values and show about the same normalized coverage 
independently of the transmitted power (TD). In this sense,

smaller TD is preferable to get higher power saving 
reduction and coverage gain. 
Reuse 1 schemes have the worst overall performance as 
expected, since intercell interference in these is very high.  
Figure 4 presents results for the same scenario in Figure 
3, but using coding rate 3/4. In these case the performance 
of all schemes is greatly reduced due to higher coding rate 
used combined with 64QAM modulation and cell radius of 
2250m. The same analysis done to Figure 3 can be applied, 
as we can see that reuse 1/3 with FRs provide the best 
coverage results and the smallest coverage belonging to 
reuse 1 scheme.  
Figure 5 and Figure 6, present the results for the same 
scenarios but using hierarchical 16QAM (16-HQAM) 
instead. We can observe that with 16-HQAM there is a 
generalized gain in terms of coverage when compared to 
64-HQAM. This is due to 16-HQAM being a lower level 
modulation, thus being more robust to fading and multi-cell 
interference. There is not a single 64-HQAM based scheme 
that is capable of achieving 95% coverage, therefore the use 
of lower coding rate (Figure 3), MIMO/SISO coordination 
with macro-diversity combining 2 radio links and 
hierarchical 16QAM is advised, to achieve the reference 
value.

The best results for 16-HQAM are achieved with reuse 
1/3 with TD = 2.5W and reuse 1/3 with TD =10W.  
In Figure 8, the coverage performance curves for 
MBSFN scenario, versus Ec/Ior, are presented for cell 
radius of 2250m and should be compared to the 
corresponding results of Figure 3 for the SCPTM scenario. 
As expected there is a difference in the coverage between 
the two scenarios where MBSFN takes advantage of its 
lower inter-cell interference. The coverage values for reuse 
1/3 H1 and H2 blocks is above 95% followed by reuse 1/3 
with FR with TD=2.5W. The coverage of reuse 1 is the 
lowest. Reuse 1/3 can also introduce some energy saving 
advantage over other schemes since with just only 15% of 
Ec/Ior it can achieve coverage for H1 blocks over 95%, and 
furthermore, with just 50% of Ec/Ior the coverage for H1 
and H2 blocks surpasses 95%.

There is no significant advantage in terms of coverage 
from using relay stations (RSs), since reuse 1/3 is better. 
This is due to the small amount of inter-cell interference in 
MBFSN scenario. However, as (RSs) have smaller 
transmission powers the comparison should take into 
account the reduction of the transmitted power in all the 
area. There are 12 RSs and 7 BSs in all area resulting in 
power saving advantage with RSs, especially with 
TD=2.5W. 
Hybrid reuse with DR=1350m also achieves coverage 
values around 95%, and because it can use reuse 1 (for 
higher throughputs) and reuse 1/3 (for higher coverage) 
simultaneously it can be a good compromise between 
throughput vs. coverage. The coverage of reuse 1 is the 
lowest. 
Figure 9 corresponds to Figure 8, but considering 
coding rate 3/4. In this case there is a reduction in coverage 
achieved for all schemes, and only reuse 1/3 and hybrid 
reuse can achieve 95% coverage. Reuse 1 has the worst 
coverage. 
When we move to 16-HQAM (Figure 10 and Figure 
11), we see that the coverage values improve slightly for all 
schemes, especially for reuse 1 based schemes. We also 
observe that with the same Ec/Ior, 16-HQAM modulation 
achieves higher coverage values than those of 64-HQAM, 
showing that using lower modulation schemes can improve 
coverage values and achieve power transmission savings. 
 
Another important technique is the use of spatial 
multiplexing (MIMO) associated to signal space diversity 
(SSD) provided by CRM to enhance the capacity. The 
spectral efficiency of QPSK, 2x2MIMO is equivalent to 
H16QAM with SISO. Figure 12 and Figure 13 present the 
coverage vs. the fraction of the total transmitted power, for 
different coding rates considering the SC-PTM and 
MBSFN scenarios, respectively. Instead of H1 and H2 
blocks now we have Antenna 1 (A1) and Antenna 2 (A2) 
blocks, where the coverage of each antenna is about the 
same. In the MBSFN scenario, we consider the existence of 
coordinated MIMO transmission, i.e., with macro-diversity 
combining the three best radio links. In addition to reuse 
1/3, reuse 1 is also evaluated. As expected the coverage of 
reuse 1/3 is higher than the reuse 1 due to less inter-cell 
interference. With reuse 1/3 both coding rates assure the 
95% coverage. The MBSFN scenario is preferable than SC-
PTM because MBSFN takes advantage of its lower inter-
cell interference. 
Figure 16 and Figure 17 present the coverage vs. the 
fraction of the total transmitted power, for coding rate 1/2 
and 3/4 respectively, considering the SC-PTM scenario and 
4x4MIMO. Figures 11 and 12 correspond to the Figure 14 
and Figure 15 but considering the MBSFN scenario.  
The results are similar to the ones obtained to 2x2 
MIMO. The coverage of reuse 1/3 is higher than the reuse 1 
due to less inter-cell interference and the MBSFN scenario 
is better than SC-PTM because MBSFN takes advantage of 
its lower inter-cell interference. As expected, the code rate 
½ presents better coverage than ¾.

results for schemes using BSs and RSs represent the joint 
throughput  of those. We observe that the maximum 
throughput is achieved in the reuse 1/3 topology and RSs 
with TD=2.5W, as expected from the corresponding

coverage values presented in Figure 3. HR is the second 
best, since it combines the coverage values achieved by 
using reuse 1/3 with the higher throughput achieved in the 
zones where users can use reuse 1. 
With reuse 1/3 and RSs it was possible to increase the 
throughput compared to the single reuse 1/3, confirming the 
importance of having RSs in the cell area. Due to the 
smaller coverage, reuse 1 achieves the smallest throughput 
in spite of its higher inherent throughput. Users located 
closer to the base station have smaller inter-cell interference 
and higher throughput when reuse 1 is employed. 
Figure 19 shows the respective throughput achieved 
only by RSs in Figure 18. As we can see, RSs have lower 
throughputs when compared to BSs, due to having 
transmission gaps where no information is transmitted and 
reduced power output. However, as we saw in Figure 18, 
the overall throughput when using a combination of BSs 
and RSs for SC-PTM is higher than those achieved by reuse 
1 or 1/3, because BSs achieve significant higher 
throughputs when exists interfering RSs instead of BSs. 
Figure 20 corresponds to previous Figure 18 but 
considering coding rate 3/4. We observe that the maximum 
throughput is achieved for reuse 1/3 and RS with 
TD=2.5W, followed by reuse 1/3 and RS with TD=10W. 
This was already expected due to higher coverage 
associated to less inter-cell interference provided when 
reuse 1/3 schemes are used. We also denote that increasing 
the RS power output, from TD=2.5W to TD=10W slightly 
decreases maximum throughput, since RS transmitting with 
higher power will increase inter-cell interference, and 
reduce overall coverage as illustrated in Figure4. The 
results for RSs are presented in Figure 21. Again, RSs have 
lower throughput than BSs, but their reduced power output 
and transmission gaps greatly reduce intercell interference 
in neighbor cells, improving signal conditions and 
throughput in those.

Hybrid 
reuse 
1+1/3 
achieves 
maximum 
throughput, followed by reuse 1 and reuse 1/3. This was 
already expected due to its higher coverage associated to 
less 
inter-cell interference provided by the 
SISO 
coordination of the MBSFN network. For this scenario, 
using RS is not essential due to the SISO coordination that 
increases both coverage and throughput, in particular, users 
located at the cell borders. Figure 24 and Figure 25 present 
the results considering coding rate 3/4. For this scenario the 
best results are achieved for hybrid reuse 1+1/3 and reuse 
1/3. Reuse 1 and RS throughput results are almost three 
times lower than reuse 1/3, denoting the lack of robustness 
of the signal when higher coding rates are used. Reuse 1/3 
and hybrid reuse are a better choice since they employ 
interference coordination.

For 16-HQAM and SC-PTM (Figure 26 to Figure 29) 
the maximum throughput achieved for all transmission 
schemes is slightly lower than 64-HQAM (due to lower 
modulation). Reuse schemes where BSs and RSs, namely 
reuse 1/3 with TD=2.5W, hybrid reuse 1+1/3 and reuse 1/3 
achieve the best results like 64-HQAM. Also increasing 
coding rate (from 1/2 to 3/4) reduces the maximum 
throughput of all schemes, reducing signal robustness to 
transmission errors and interference and reducing overall 
coverage of cell area.

Figure 30 to Figure 33 present the results for 16-HQAM 
and MBSFN network. When comparing the results for 16-
HQAM (Figure 30) to 64-HQAM (Figure 22) when see that 
reuse 1 is now the reuse scheme that achieves higher 
spectral efficiency with around 10Mbps of throughput using 
all the transmission power available. This is happens 
because 16-HQAM is a modulation more robust and 
together with macro-diversity combining existing in 
MBSFN network allowing, this allows reuse one to take full 
advantage of using the total transmission bandwidth 
available.

To increase the spectral efficiency at the cell borders we 
will check the use of 2x2 and 4x4 MIMO associated with 
QPSK modulation and SSD provided by CRM. Figures 34 
and Figure 35 presents the average throughput vs Ec/Ior for 
both coding rates 1/2 and 3/4, for the SC-PTM and MBSFN 
scenarios using MIMO 2x2. Figures 36 and 37 correspond 
to the Figures 21 and 22 but considering 4x4 MIMO. Table 
II shows a comparison between the system spectral 
efficiency. We observe that the maximum throughput is 
achieved for coding rate 1/2, reuse 1 and reaches more than 
1.7bps/Hz/cell, or 1.4bps/. The existence of coordinated 
MIMO transmission in a scenario as MBSFN, with macro-
diversity combining the three best radio link, provides 
higher values of throughput.

 Please note that E-MBMS services use dedicated 
carriers, and because of this, all the available transmission 
power can be used to achieve the results we present. This 
confirms the higher spectral efficiency of MIMO compared 
to 64-HQAM (presented in Figure 24) independently of the 
chosen reuse scheme. There is no advantage in using coding 
rate ¾ due to its lower coverage, in spite of higher 
maximum throughput. 
 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
In 
this 
work, 
we 
have 
analyzed 
interference 
coordination 
methods 
for 
Evolved-Multimedia 
Broadcast/Multicast Service (E-MBMS) in Long-Term 
Evolution Advanced (LTE-A). 
Based on the average coverage and throughput 
simulation results, for the SCPTM scenario it is 
recommended the use of reuse 1/3 and Relay Stations to 
increase the coverage and throughput of users located at 
cell borders. 
For the MBSFN scenario we also recommend the use of 
reuse 1/3 or the hybrid reuse 1+1/3 due to their best 
compromise between coverage and maximum achieved 
throughput. Relay Stations are not necessary due to the 
availability of SISO coordination in the MBSFN scenario.  
The introduction of signal space diversity, converted to 
frequency diversity in multi-path Rayleigh channels with 
OFDMA transmission and spatial multiplexing 4x4 and 2x2 
MIMO enables enhancing the spectral efficiency at the cell 
borders of MBSFN. The coding rate 1/2, reuse 1 provides 
the highest spectral efficiency. It is not recommended to 
increase the coding rate within the MBSFN network to not 
decrease the throughput at the cell borders.
