Abstract— In this paper, we propose a resource allocation 
scheme in the frequency and time domain, to reduce 
interference in the Heterogeneous Network (HetNet) scenario. 
In the frequency domain, the macrocell allocates frequency 
band by using Soft Frequency Reuse (SFR), and the picocell 
chooses sub-bands that are not used in the macrocell sector, to 
avoid interference. In addition, to allocate the limited 
frequency resource is difficult. Therefore, we can manage the 
cross-tier interference using Almost Blank Subframe (ABS) in 
the time domain. Simulation results show that the proposed 
scheme can improve Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio 
(SINR), and the spectrum efficiency of macrocell and picocell 
users. Eventually, the proposed scheme can improve overall 
cell performance.

 INTRODUCTION 
Recently, small cells have been developed to gain cell 
subdivision, according to trends of the increase of data rate 
and bandwidth. Also, cells of hot zone form, such as the 
picocell, developed in specific areas, are becoming common 
for offloading explosion data traffic.  
Picocells are low-power operator-installed cell towers, 
with the same backhaul and access features as macrocells. 
They are usually deployed in a centralized way, serving few 
users within a radio range of 300m or less, with a typical 
transmit power range of 23 to 30 dBm. Picocells are mainly 
utilized for capacity, and also for outdoor/indoor coverage 
infill with insufficient macro penetration (e.g. office 
buildings).  
A network consisting of small cells, such as the low-cost, 
low-power picocell over the marcocell, is called a HetNet. 
 Interference between neighboring picocells and between 
picocell and macrocell occurs under the HetNet scenario. In 
general, the two types of interference are as follows [1]:  
(a) Co-tier interference: This type of interference occurs 
among network elements that belong to the same tier in the 
network. In the case of a picocell network, co-tier 
interference occurs between neighboring picocells.  
(b) Cross-tier interference: This type of interference 
occurs among network elements that belong to different tiers 
of the network, i.e. interference between picocells and 
macrocells as depicted in Figure 1. For example, when a 
terminal accessed picocell is located in an edge area of a 
picocell, access from the picocell can be disconnected, due to 
interference from the macrocell. This means that the picocell 
coverage is less than the expectation of the operators [2].  
 
Figure 1.  Cross-tier interference in HetNet. 
Conventional radio resource management techniques are 
not suitable for HetNet. Thus, it is essential to adopt an 
effective and robust interference management scheme that 
could mitigate the co-tier interference, and reduce the cross-
tier interference considerably, in order to enhance the 
throughput of the overall network.  
In this paper, we propose not only co-tier interference 
management, but also cross-tier interference management for 
the HetNet scenario. Resource allocation is done by SFR and 
ABS, to manage the interference in the frequency and time 
domain, respectively. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: 
conventional related work is explained in Section II, Section 
III shows the proposed scheme, and Section IV shows a 
performance analysis of the proposed scheme through 
simulation. Finally, we conclude the results in Section V.

CONVENTIONAL RELATED WORK

base station. However, there are many problems, such as the

transmission rate, and transmission quality degradation due 
to interference between macrocell and picocell using the 
same frequency, in a HetNet scenario deploying picocells 
over the macrocell.  
The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has 
discussed Interference control technology in an LTE-
Advanced system. 3GPP with its REL-8/9 supports 
Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) and Relative Narrowband 
Transmission Power (RNTP) for interference control. Both 
of these methods are to reduce the interference level, by 
adjusting the level of signal that is transmitted through a 
certain frequency resource. However, picocells are deployed 
over the existing macrocell network, and share the same 
frequency spectrum. Due to spectrum scarcity, to eliminate 
interference is limited in the frequency domain. Therefore, 
REL-10/11 has introduced the Cooperative Silencing scheme, 
using ABS in the time domain for interference control [3]. 
Interference management has been actively discussed in the 
time domain. Time-Domain Resource Partitioning was 
proposed [4]. This determines users protected by ABS, and 
then finds the optimal amount of ABS, by evaluating the 
overall system utility.  
Also, Enhanced Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (EDSS) was 
proposed for interference management in the picocell. This 
combines the DSS with FFR for the HetNet scenario. 
According to the principle of DSS, and the fact that the 
coverage area of the macro center area (which can be 
efficiently controlled, by adjusting the transmitting power of 
the macro system) has no overlap with the coverage area of 
cell-edge Pico cells. The cell-edge Pico cells can use not 
only the whole spectrum in the macro cell uplink 
environment, but also the spectrum in the macro center area 
downlink environment, while central Pico cells can just use 
the spectrum in the macro cell uplink environment in TDD 
mode [5]. 
FFR allocates resource in the frequency domain for 
interference management. In addition, SFR is one of the 
solutions to reduce inter-cell interference in the Orthogonal 
Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) based macro 
system. In FFR, each cell turns off the transmission power of 
the subband using a Frequency Reuse Factor of 3, but in the 
case of SFR, this factor can increase the overall system 
efficiency, by transmitting with a reduced transmission 
power. Under this condition, cross-tier interference that 
occurs due to the development of the picocell can be 
minimized. Additionally, ABS can be applied, for 
interference management in the time domain. Therefore, we 
focus on the interference management between the macrocell 
and the picocell, by allocating resource in the frequency and 
time domains. 
 
 
III. 
THE PROPOSED SCHEME 
In this section, we propose a new scheme that allocates 
resource in the frequency and time domain. In the frequency 
domain, resource is allocated based on SFR. Additionally, 
resource is allocated based on ABS in the time domain. 
A. Frequency Domain 
We allocate the frequency band into macrocell and 
picocell, based on SFR for intercell interference management, 
as depicted in Figure 2 (a). The macrocell coverage is 
divided into a center zone and edge region, each of which  
include three sectors, denoted by C1, C2, and C3, and E1, E2, 
and E3. The whole frequency band is partitioned into three 
parts, denoted by A, B, and C.  
For the macrocell, a different frequency sub-band is 
allocated to each macrocell sub-area, according to the SFR. 
A reuse factor of one is applied in the center zone, while the 
edge region adopts a factor of three. The entire frequency 
bands are used in the center zone (C1, C2 and C3), and sub-
bands A, B and C are applied in the E1, E2 and E3 regions, 
respectively. Also, the overall system efficiency is increased, 
by reducing the transmission power in the center zone of the 
macrocell, as illustrated in Figure 2 (b). 
 
 
Figure 2.  The proposed interference management scheme using SFR in 
the frequency domain: (a) frequency planning , and (b) power allocation. 
Under this circumstance, the picocell chooses sub-bands 
that are not used in the macrocell sub-area. For example, 
when a picocell is located in the region E1, it uses sub-bands 
B and C, while the macrocell uses sub-band A. However, 
when a picocell is located in the center zone, it uses the 
entire frequency band, because when a macrocell is located 
in the center zone, it uses the entire frequency band. 
 
B. Time Domain 
When a picocell is located in the center zone of a 
macrocell, it uses the entire frequency band. The interference  
problem between the macrocell and picocell still exists. 
Therefore, we solve the cross-tier interference, by applying 
the ABS in the time domain.

The aggressor macrocell uses ABS, which doesn’t 
transmit a signal during some subframe for the victim pico 
user, as depicted in Figure 3. Therefore, the picocell can 
avoid interference, by transmitting a signal during the ABS 
of the macrocell.

SIMULATION RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS 
A. Simulation Model and Simulation Parameters 
The simulation results are based on 3GPP LTE-
Advanced system level simulation parameters [6]. The 
overall network is composed of 7 macrocells, and picocells 
are randomly deployed over the macrocells. The number of 
picocells is 3 in one macrocell coverage. The main 
simulation parameters are listed in Table I.

B. Problem Fomulations 
To demonstrate the improvement of Quality of Service 
(QoS) for users, it is necessary to obtain the Signal to 
Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) of these users.  In our 
simulation, the received SINR of a macro user m on sub-
carrier k can be expressed by the following definition: 
        
          
   ∑
                 
∑             
 
      (1) 
 
 
where, PM,k and PM΄,k are the transmit powers of serving 
macrocell M and neighbor macrocell M’ on sub-carrier k, 
respectively. Gm,M,k is the channel gain between macro user 
m and serving macrocell M on sub-carrier k. Channel gains 
from neighboring macrocells are denoted by Gm,M΄,k. 
Similarly, PP,k is the transmit power of the neighboring 
picocell P on sub-carrier k. Gm,P,k is the channel gain 
between macro user m and the neighboring picocell P on 
sub-carrier k. N0 is the white noise power spectral density. 
In the case of a picocell user, it is interfered from 
macrocells and the adjacent picocell. The received SINR of 
a pico user p on sub-carrier k can be similarly given by 

       
          
   ∑
             
  ∑               
 
          
where, PP,k and PP΄,k are the transmit powers of the serving 
picocell P and neighboring picocell P’ on sub-carrier k, 
respectively. Gp,P,k is the channel gain between pico user m 
and serving picocell P on sub-carrier k. The channel gains 
from neighboring picocells are denoted by Gp,P΄,k. Similarly, 
PM,k is the transmit power of neighboring macrocell M on 
sub-carrier k. Gp,M,k is the channel gain between pico user p 
and neighboring macrocell M on sub-carrier k. N0 is the 
white noise power spectral density. 
Also, capacity of the MUE m in macrocell M and the 
PUE p in picocell P can be expressed by equation (3) and 
(4), respectively.

                           (4) 
 
where, BW is the system bandwidth, and     is the number 
of the resource block that assigned the user. 
  
C. Performance Analysis of Proposed Scheme 
The proposed scheme is compared with several 
comparison schemes, as follows. In the No ICIC(Inter-cell 
Interference Coordination) scheme, both macro and pico 
users are randomly assigned the resource in time and 
frequency domain. Also, SFR is the proposed scheme that 
assigns the resource using only SFR in the frequency domain, 
and ABS with SFR is the proposed scheme that assigns the 
resource using SFR and ABS in the frequency and time 
domain, respectively. 
 
1) Performance Analysis of SINR 
Figure 4 shows the Cumulative Distribution Function 
(CDF) of macro user SINR. In the case of the proposed 
scheme applying only SFR, co-tier interference between the 
macrocells is reduced. Also, cross-tier interference between 
the macrocell and picocell is reduced, because users of 
picocell located in the macrocell edge use a sub-carrier that 
is not used by a macrocell in that area. Therefore, the 
reduction of interference of the cell edge brings improved 
SINR performance.  
The picocell transmits signal with low power. So, a 
macrocell is less affected by interference. If the center of the 
macrocell is applied with ABS as well as SFR, the proposed 
ABS with SFR scheme brings only a slight performance 
improvement over the scheme applied with only SFR, 
because the user of the picocell located in the center uses 
ABS time, which  is not used by a macrocell in that area. 
Otherwise, the sub-carriers are randomly assigned to the 
macro and pico users. If the same sub-carrier can be used by 
an edge user in a different cell, co-tier interference occurs. 
Also, cross-tier interference between the macro user and pico 
users occurs, when the same sub-carrier can be used by the 
macro user and pico users who are very close to each other.

Therefore, the No ICIC scheme does not bring SINR 
performance improvement, because not only co-tier 
interference, but also cross-tier interference is higher than the 
proposed scheme. 
 
Figure 4.  CDF of the Macro User SINR. 
 
Figure 5 shows the CDF of the pico user SINR. It can be 
seen that the SINR performance of the pico user is similar to 
the SINR performance of the macro user, and is improved in 
the following order: No ICIC, SFR, and ABS with SFR.   
But, the proposed ABS with SFR scheme brings 
significant performance improvement, compared with the 
macro user. The reason can be found from Section III.  For 
SFR, performance of the cell edge is improved.  Also, with 
the reduction of cross-tier interference from the macrocell 
using ABS, SINR performance is improved correspondingly  
in the center area.

macro user and pico user. Simulation results show that the 
proposed scheme improves the total user SINR.

2) Performance Analysis of the Spectrum Efficiency 
We also evaluated the proposed scheme in terms of 
spectrum efficiency. Figure 7 and Figure 8 show the CDF of 
the macro user and pico user spectrum efficiency,  
respectively, and Figure 9 shows the total user spectrum 
efficiency.

CONCLUSIONS 
We propose an interference management scheme for the 
HetNet scenario with coexisting macrocell and picocell, by 
allocating resource in the frequency and time domains. In the 
frequency domain, under the macrocell allocating frequency 
band by the SFR, the picocell chooses sub-bands that are not 
used in the macrocell sector, to avoid interference. In 
addition, to allocate the limited frequency resource is 
difficult. Therefore, we can manage the cross-tier 
interference, using ABS in the time domain. Simulation 
results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can improve 
the performance, in terms of SINR and spectrum efficiency.  
We expect that the proposed scheme configures a more 
efficient cellular environment based on LTE-Advanced, due 
to the improvement of performance. Also, this improve the 
overall cell performance in the HetNet scenario, for the next 
generation wireless communication environment.
