Abstract—Emergency communications can beneﬁt from the inte-
grated aerial-satellite systems due to the frequent Line Of Sight
(LOS) access for User Equipments (UEs) and the robust satellite
backhaul. This paper addresses an energy efﬁciency power
allocation problem for a OFDM-based aerial system with limited
satellite backhaul. Due to the non-convex backhaul capacity
limit, the optimization problem is solved in two steps. Firstly,
a non-negative parameter is introduced to convert the objective
function to an equivalent convex form according to the fractional
programming. Then, the optimal parameter for maximum Energy
Efﬁciency (EE) without total power and backhaul capacity
constraints is obtained. Secondly, by proving that the derivative
of R(Ptot) is equal to the above introduced parameter, which
is decreasing in total power limit, Ptot, these two constraints
can be transformed into a lower bound on the parameter
through geometric interpretation. Thus, an energy efﬁciency
power allocation algorithm is proposed. Finally, numerical results
show that the circuit power, total power limit and backhaul
capacity limit have effect on the system EE.
Keywords–energy efﬁciency; backhaul limit; power allocation.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Large-scale disaster or unexpected emergency may over-
load or totally paralyze the existing terrestrial network in
severe cases. Therefore, an effective Public Protection and Dis-
aster Relief (PPDR) system is crucial to meet the requirements
of victims and ﬁrst responders, which is characterized by rapid
deployment, large capacity-coverage, ﬂexibility and scalability
[1].
In this regard, ABSOLUTE project is working at estab-
lishing an integrated satellite-aerial-terrestrial architecture to
guarantee reliable communication in the aftermath of natural
disaster [2]. An important element of the integrated architec-
ture is aerial station which is an air balloon or aircraft based
Low Attitude Platform (LAP). The LAP goes from 100 meters
to 1000 meters height, lifting with a low-complexity Long
Term Evolution (LTE) eNB, named Aerial eNodeB (AeNB),
and ﬁlling the gaps of destroyed LTE base stations. The lower
altitude of aerial station compared to that of satellite makes
it easier for LAP to support frequent Line Of Sight (LOS)
with User Equipments (UEs), which explains the advantage of
LAPs for the public safety network.
Emergency communications can greatly beneﬁt from the
integrated aerial-satellite systems which could provide UEs
with high capacity-coverage thanks to low delay aerial links,
while reliable backhauling links to remote networks (head-
quarters) can be supplied by the satellite segment [3]. On the
other hand, due to the limited overload, LAPs are unable to
carry enough battery and AeNB thus may face stiff constraints
regarding its total energy consumption. Therefore, the Energy
Efﬁciency (EE) is demonstrated as a signiﬁcant metric to
evaluate the power allocation performance of AeNB.
In this paper, we consider a subset of aerial-satellite
systems. As illustrated in Figure 1, the system consists of
a single air balloon based LAP, keeping a quasi-stationary
position over a predeﬁned area and serving a set of UEs. The
AeNB is connected to its Evolved Packet Core (EPC) through
optical link. The satellite serves as a backhaul to connect aerial
system with Headquarter. We assume that aerial system is
OFDM-based and design a downlink energy efﬁciency power
allocation algorithm for a OFDM-based aerial system.
Different from previous work on downlink EE maxi-
mization for OFDM-based systems under only convex con-
straints, such as total power limit [4], minimal overall system
throughput limit [5] and interference limit [6], we maximize
the system EE with the total power constraint, peak power
limit, QoS requirement of each UE, as well as non-convex
backhaul capacity constraint. The problem is solved in two
steps owing to this non-convex constraint. Firstly, according
to the properties of fractional programming, a non-negative
parameter is introduced to convert the objective function to
an equivalent convex form. Then, the optimal parameter for
maximum EE without total power and backhaul capacity
constraints is obtained. Secondly, by proving that the deriva-
tive of R(Ptot) is the above introduced parameter, which is
decreasing in total power limit, Ptot, this paper transform
these two constraints into a lower bound on the parameter
through geometric interpretation. Finally, theoretical analysis
is corroborated by numerical experiments.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, system description and channel model are intro-
duced. In Section III, we present the energy efﬁciency power
allocation algorithm. The simulation results are presented and
discussed in Section IV. Finally, Section V concludes the paper.

SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND CHANNEL MODEL
In this section, we present our system model in detail. Also,
a practical channel model is given here.
A. System Description
As illustrated in Figure 1, information is transmitted from
the headquarter ground station to the AeNB through the
satellite link L1, L2, Internet and optical link. In this paper,
we omit the detailed signal transmission of these links and see
them as a whole backhaul, the capacity of which is denoted as
Cbackhaul. We focus on the downlink transmission of the aerial
system. We consider a single OFDM-based aerial network with
K active UEs. The total bandwidth, B, is divided into B
subcarriers, each with W = B
K .

Figure 1. System Model in Integrated Aerial-Satellite Network
Assume that the kth subcarrier is assigned to the kth UE to
avoid interference among different UEs. Then, the maximum
achievable data rate at the kth UE is accordingly
rk = Wlog2(1 + |hk|2pk
σ2
) = Wlog2(1 + gkpk),
(1)
where hk and pk denote the channel fading factor and transmit
power from AeNB to the kth UE, respectively. σ2 is the
received noise power and gk = |hk|2
σ2
is the Carrier-to-Noise
Ratio (CNR) of the kth subcarrier. Then, the overall throughput
of the OFDM-based aerial system is given by R = ∑
k∈K
rk,
where K = {1, 2, ..., K} denotes the set of all UEs.
The total power consumption at AeNB is modeled as [6]
Ptot = ζP + Pc,
(2)
where ζ is the reciprocal of drain efﬁciency of power ampliﬁer.
P = ∑
k∈K
pk and Pc represent the transmit power consumption
and the circuit power consumption incurred active circuit
block, respectively.
We use the throughput for unit-energy consumption to
measure the system EE, i.e.,
ηEE =
∑
k∈K
Wlog2(1 + gkpk)
ζ ∑
k∈K
pk + Pc
.
(3)
The energy efﬁcient power allocation problem considering
each UE’s QoS, total power limit as well as backhaul capacity
constraint can be written as P1:
P1 :
max
pk,k∈K
∑
k∈K
Wlog2(1 + gkpk)

(4c)
∑
k∈K
Wlog2(1 + gkpk) ⩽ Cbackhaul,
(4d)

(4e)
where rk,min is the trafﬁc-related minimum rate requirement
of the kth UE; PT ot and Cbackhaul denote the maximal
total power consumption and backhaul capacity, respectively.
The allowed peak power at each subcarrier, ppeak, is also
considered in this paper.
For simplicity, we assume that rk,min, ∀k ∈ K is achievable
under the constraint (4c) and (4d), i.e.,
ζ
∑
k∈K
pk,min + Pc ⩽ PT ot
(5)
and
∑

should be satisﬁed simultaneously, where pk,min = 2

is the minimum required transmit power to meet the kth UE’s
QoS. If not, optimization problem P1 is unfeasible.
B. Channel Model
An existing empirical propagation channel model [7] be-
tween the AeNB and UEs is adopted in this paper. The large-
scale fading taking path loss and shadow fading into account
is given as
L =
{ LF SL + ξLOS,
LOS
LF SL + Ls + ξNLOS,
NLOS,
(7)
where LF SL is the free space loss in dB as follows:
LF SL = 20 log(dkm) + 20 log(fGHz) + 92.4,
(8)
where dkm is the propagation distance between transmitter and
receiver. fGHz denotes the carrier frequency in GHz. An ele-
vation angel dependent shadowing Ls is a normal distributed
random variable. The location variability components ξLOS
and ξNLOS both follow Log-normal distribution with zero
mean.
With respect to the small-scale fading, Rayleigh distribu-
tion is added to NLOS link and Rician distribution LOS link.
III.
ENERGY EFFICIENCY POWER ALLOCATION
P1 is obviously a non-convex problem since the objective
function (4a) and the backhaul capacity constraint (4d) is non-
convex [8]. The objective of a fractional programming, as we
observed in P1, takes the form of a ratio of two functions
which is very challenging to solve directly. According to
Isheden et al. [9], a non-negative parametric can be introduced
to formulate a parametric optimization P2 which is closely
related with P1.

(9b)
where S = {pk, ∀k ∈ K | pk,min ≤ pk ≤ ppeak} is the
set of individual powers and each has a box constraint. Note
that (9a) is convex for a given λ since its formulated as the
difference between a convex function and a concave function
(linear function for more strictly). But, P2 is still a non-convex
optimization problem due to the constraint (4d).
In order to solve problem P2 effectively, we ﬁrst leave out
the constraint (4c) and (4d) and consider the optimal system
EE only under the individual power set, which is formulated
as
P3 : max
pk∈S
∑
k∈K
Wlog2(1 + gkpk) − λ
(
ζ
∑
k∈K

)
.
(10)
For convenience, we deﬁne the optimal value of P3 as a
function of λ, denoting as F(λ).
The optimal power allocation is achieved at the stationary
point for a given λ since (10) is convex, i.e.,
d ∑
k∈K

allocation is given as

(12)
It is obvious that the maximum system energy efﬁciency
without constraints (4c) and (4d) can be achieved by ﬁnding
the optimal λ∗ of P3. According to Isheden et al. [9],
the optimal power allocation to obtain the maximum energy
efﬁciency only under the individual power set S is the same
as that of P3 for λ = λ∗, where λ∗ satisﬁes F(λ∗) =
max
pk∈S
∑
k∈K
Wlog2(1 + gkpk) − λ∗
(
ζ ∑

= 0. In
addition, λ∗ is the optimal bit-per-joule, i.e.,
λ∗ =
∑
k∈K
Wlog2(1 + gkp∗
k)
ζ ∑
k∈K
p∗
k + Pc
.
(13)
Since the power allocation has been expressed in (12)
for a given λ, we need to determine λ∗ with F(λ∗) = 0.
The Dinkelbachs method [9], as described in Algorithm 1, is
adopted in this paper to ﬁnd it.
Until now, the problem P3 without constraints (4c) and
(4d) has been solved. In order to solve problem P2, we explore
some properties of R(Ptot), which are described in following
Lemma 1. Deﬁne R(Ptot) as the maximum overall system


individual power constraint, which is given as
R(Ptot) ≜
max
pk∈S,Pc+ζ ∑
k∈K
pk⩽Ptot
∑
k∈K
Wlog2(1+gkpk). (14)
Due to the individual power constraint in S, Ptot
∈
[PT ot,min, PT ot,max], in which PT ot,min = ζ ∑
k∈K
pk,min+Pc
and PT ot,max = ζKppeak + Pc. Since the right hand side of
(14) is a convex optimization problem with ﬁxed Ptot, R(Ptot)
has a unique value for all allowed Ptot. According to the
constraint Pc + ζ ∑
k∈K
pk ⩽ Ptot, it is obvious that R(Ptot) is
an increasing function in Ptot. The curve of R(Ptot) is plotted
in Figure 2.
Lemma 1: R(Ptot) is continuously differentiable in Ptot
and R′(Ptot) = λ(Ptot) is decreasing in Ptot, where Ptot ∈
(PT ot,min, PT ot,max).
Proof: please refer to Appendix for a proof of Lemma 1.
As illustrated in Figure 2, the slope of the origin-to-
(Ptot, R(Ptot)) is η(Ptot) =
R(Ptot)
Ptot , which represents the
maximum system EE at Ptot. By Lemma 1, we have that
the tangent at (Ptot, R(Ptot)) is λ(Ptot). It is obvious to
see that the slope η(Ptot) ﬁrst increases and then decreases
with growing of Ptot as well as the optimal EE is achieved
when η(P ∗
tot) = λ(P ∗
tot). When taking the constraints (4c)
and (4d) into consideration, it is straightforward that (4c) and
(4d) correspond to an upper lower bound on λ, say λPT,min and
λCb,min, respectively. This is because that λ(Ptot) is decreasing
in Ptot which is described in Lemma 1. Obviously, the system
lower bound λmin = max(λPT ,min, λCb,min) and λmax is
determined by PT ot,min. Therefore, if the optimal λ∗ of P3
falls into the interval [λmin, λmax], it is also the optimal λ∗ of
P2. If not, λ∗ < λmin must be satisﬁed and optimal λ∗ of P2
is replaced by λmin. λ∗ > λmax would not occur due to the
lower bound of total power consumption.
According to the above analysis, we design an energy efﬁ-
ciency power allocation algorithm in the following Algorithm
1, which is based on Dinkelbachs method.

efﬁciency power allocation algorithm. We use Matlab for the
simulation. In our simulation, the total bandwidth, 0.5MHz,
is equally divided into 20 orthogonal subcarriers and assigned
to 20 users, as well as the carrier frequency is selected to
2GHz. The requirement of each user is 100kbit and the peak
power at each subcarrier is set to 10W. For simplicity, we set
the drain efﬁciency of power ampliﬁer as 1. The AeNB is
assumed to 500m high, all users are uniformly distributed in
a circle around the AeNB and the radius of which is 3km.
The practical channel factor has been described in (7)(8).
According to Holis et al. [7], we choose the Dense Urban
environment for our simulation and the probability of LOS is
then determined. The power spectrum of the noise equals to
-110dBm/Hz.
Figure 4 depicts the impact of static circuit power on
the energy efﬁciency for the problem of P3 and P2, i.e.,
without and with the consideration of total power and backhaul
capacity constraints. The maximum total power and the back-
haul capacity are set to 40W and 5Mbit, respectively. Note
that the energy efﬁciency is decreasing with the increase of
static circuit power. λmin here is co-determined by the total
power and backhaul capacity. When the circuit power is small,

these two constraints has no effect on the energy efﬁciency
and this case corresponds to the optimal λ∗ of P3 falls into
[λmin, λmax]. However, when circuit power goes large, the
energy efﬁciency is limited by these two constraints since the
optimal λ∗ of P3 is less than λmin.
Figure 5 illustrates the energy efﬁciency versus the total
power consumption for different backhaul capacity. The static
power is ﬁxed to 35W, so the increase of total power is caused
by transmit power only. The backhaul capacity C1 and C2
are set to 2.7Mbit and 3.5Mbit, respectively. In Figure 5, EE
maximization is our proposed algorithm and SE maximization
is achieved by maximizing the system throughput under the
same constraints. It can be observed that when the total
power is large enough, the energy efﬁciency of each algorithm
approaches a constant value. However, for EE maximization
and Cbackaul = C2 case, this is because that the maximum
energy efﬁciency is obtained and thus resource allocator is not
willing to consume more power. For other three cases, the
constant value is caused by limited backhaul capacity.
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we consider the downlink energy efﬁciency
power allocation for a single OFDM-based aerial system with
limited satellite backhaul. Due to the non-convex backhaul
capacity limit, the problem is solved in two steps by exploring
the properties of fractional programming and the derivative
of R(Ptot). Then, an energy efﬁciency power allocation algo-
rithm is proposed. Finally, theoretical analysis is corroborated
by numerical experiments. The cooperation between multiple
aerial systems can be considered in our future work.

paper, we further prove that R(Ptot) is differentiable and
the derivative of R(Ptot) is continuous and decreasing. We
consider the limit under the constraint ∑
k∈K
∆pk = ∆Ptot and
let ˆpk denote the optimal power allocation at the kth subcarrier
under the total power consumption Ptot.
According to the deﬁnition of derivative, we derive that
(15) is satisﬁed, in which K′ = {k|∆pk = 0, k ∈ K}. We have
∆pk = 0 if either of the following two cases occurs, i.e., (a)
ˆpk = pmin and ∃k′ ∈ K, ˆpk′ > pk′,min and the water level at
the k′th subcarrier is lower than that of kth subcarrier; (b) ˆpk =

λ+(Ptot)ζ , where
W log2e
λ+(Ptot)ζ is the water level under Ptot.
Hence, we have R′

occurs, K′ ̸= ϕ. In this case,
min

λ+(Ptot)ζ is
also satisﬁed. However,
W log2e
λ+(Ptot)ζ here denotes the water level
without regard to the kth (k ∈ K′) subcarrier. As a whole,
W log2e
λ+(Ptot)ζ denotes the water level at the kth (k ∈ K − K′)
subcarrier which would increase if the value of Ptot grows
∆Ptot.
Similarly, (16) is derived. In this case, we have ∆pk =
0 if either of the following two cases occurs, i.e., (c) ˆpk =
ppeak and ∃k′ ∈ K, ˆpk′ < ppeak and the water level at the
k′th subcarrier is higher than that of kth subcarrier; (d) ˆpk =
pk,min. Analogously, R′
−(Ptot) = λ−(Ptot) is satisﬁed and
W log2e
λ−(Ptot)ζ here represents the water level at the kth (k ∈ K′)
subcarrier which would decrease if the value of Ptot reduces
∆Ptot.
Obviously, water level
W log2e
λ+(Ptot)ζ =
W log2e
λ−(Ptot)ζ holds for any
given Ptot ∈ (PT ot,min, PT ot,max). Then, we have R′
+(Ptot) =
R′
−(Ptot) = λ(Ptot). The existence of the limit indicates that
R(Ptot) is differentiable in Ptot. Clearly, the growing of water
level is continuous as the value of Ptot gets larger. Therefore,
λ(Ptot) is continuously decreasing since its inversely propor-
tional with water level. This completes the proof of lemma
1.
