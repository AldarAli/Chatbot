Abstract— This paper reviews the fast deployment of Wireless 
Local Area Networks (WLANs) and the ability of WLAN to 
support real time services. Stringent quality of service (QoS) 
and high throughput requirements has come into force. We 
compare the QoS support in the IEEE 802.11e to 802.11n 
standard. The 802.11n frame aggregation mechanism provides 
a better video traffic transmission performance such as 
throughput, delay and packet lost. The 802.11e mechanism 
allows prioritized medium access for applications with high 
QoS requirements by assigning different priorities to its four 
access categories. The 802.11n implemented frame aggregation 
to get high throughput and low delay transmission. We 
evaluate the performance of both 802.11 standards by 
implementing real time audio and video traffic using Network 
Simulator-2 (NS 2) simulation. Parameters such as throughput 
mean delay and packet lost have been calculated and graphs 
have been plotted. Simulation results show that 802.11e 
mechanism provides satisfactory service differentiation among 
its four access categories. With frame aggregation mechanism 
in 802.11n, network delay has been effectively decreased to 
better support real-time audio and video transmissions

INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, IEEE 802.11 standard has emerged as 
the dominating technology and is vastly used in Wireless 
Local Area Networks (WLANs) [1]. Low cost, ease of 
deployment and mobility support has resulted in the vast 
popularity of IEEE 802.11 WLANs. WLAN can be easily 
deployed in hot-spot zones of airports, hotels, office, and 
residence homes. With ever increasing popularity of 
multimedia applications, people want voice, audio and video 
services through WLAN connections. Unlike the traditional 
best effort data applications, multimedia applications require 
quality of service (QoS) support such as guaranteed 
bandwidth, delay and packet lost. The legacy 802.11, 
802.11b, 802.11a/g can provide up to 2 Mbps, 11 Mbps and 
54 Mbps data rates. However, the achievable throughput of 
a WLAN is less than half of the physical layer (PHY) raw 
data rate because of the protocol overheads, (UDP, TCP, IP, 
medium access control (MAC), physical (PHY) preamble, 
interframe spaces (IFSs), acknowledgment (ACK) and 
backoff time, etc. As both the MAC layer and the PHY layer 
of 802.11 [2] are designed for best effort data transmissions, 
the original 802.11 standard does not take QoS into account. 
Hence to provide QoS support IEEE 802.11 standard group 
has specified a new IEEE 802.11e standard. IEEE 802.11e 
supports QoS by providing differentiated classes of service 
in MAC layer; it also enhances the physical layer so that it 
can deliver time sensitive multimedia traffic, in addition to 
traditional data packets [3].  
The IEEE 802.11e standard introduces the Hybrid 
Coordination Function (HCF) as the MAC scheme. While 
backward compatible with Distributed Coordination Fuction 
(DCF) and PCF, HCF provides stations with prioritized and 
parameterized QoS access to the wireless medium. HCF 
combines aspects of both the contention-based and the 
contention free access methods, where the contention-based 
channel access mechanism in HCF is known as the 
Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) and its 
contention free counterpart is known as the HCF Controlled 
Channel Access (HCCA).The EDCA is an extension of the 
conventional distributed coordination function (DCF) [3]. It 
provides prioritized QoS services which classify all the 
traffics destined MAC layer to multiple Access Categories 
(ACs). Also differentiate the chance to get a transmission 
opportunity 
(TXOP) 
using 
unequal 
channel 
access 
parameters.  
In response to the demand for higher performance 
WLANs to support multimedia applications such as voice 
and video, the standard group has specified a new IEEE 
802.11n standard to provide over 100 Mbps throughput at 
the MAC data Service Access Point (SAP) via PHY and 
MAC enhancement [5]. An IEEE 802.11n WLAN can 
operate with physical layer raw data rate up to 200-600 
Mbps by using Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) 
technology, modified encoding and optional channel 
binding 
scheme. 
To 
efficiently 
improve 
the 
SAP 
throughput, two main MAC enhancement mechanisms have 
been proposed to reduce the protocol overhead (1) frame 
aggregation and (2) bidirectional transmission [6]. These 
mechanisms eliminate the need to initiate a transmission for 
every MAC frame in the legacy 802.11 and thus reduce the 
transmission overheads and improve the throughput 
efficiency. In our work, we compare the performance of 
802.11e to 802.11n on accommodate video traffic.

This paper is organized as follows; Section II describes 
basic theory of WLAN IEEE 802.11e and WLAN IEEE 
802.11n. In Section III, we evaluate video transmission 
performance over 802.11e and 802.11n using ns-2 
simulation and perform the performance comparison 
evaluation of the simulation results. Finally, Section IV 
concludes the paper.  
II. BASIC THEORY 
A.  IEEE 802.11e  
IEEE 802.11e EDCA is designed to enhance the 802.11 
DCF (Distributed Coordination Function) mechanism by 
providing a distributed access method that can support 
service differentiation among different classes of traffic. 
EDCA classifies traffic into four different AC as illustrated 
in Figure 1 [7]. The four access categories include AC _VO 
(for voice traffic), AC_VI (for video traffic), AC_BE (for 
best effort traffic), and AC _BK (for background traffic). To 
simplify the notations, AC_VO assign as AC3, AC_VI as 
AC2, AC_BE as AC1, and AC_BK as AC0. Each AC has 
its own buffered queue and behaves as an independent 
backoff entity. The priority among ACs is then determined 
by AC-specific parameters, called the EDCA parameter 
set. The EDCA parameter set includes minimum Contention 
Window size (CWmin), maximum Contention Window size 
(CWmax), Arbitration Inter Frame Space (AIFS), and 
Transmission Opportunity limit (TXOPlimit). The preferred 
values of each mechanism parameters that the standard 
recommends are shown in Table 1 [7]. 
Figure 2 demonstrates the operations in 802.11e EDCA. 
To achieve differentiation, instead of using fixed DIFS 
(Distributed Interframe Space) as in 802.11 DCF, EDCA 
assigns higher priority ACs with smaller CWmin, CWmax, 
and AIFS to influence the successful transmission 
probability (statistically) in favor of high-priority ACs. The 
AC with the smallest AIFS has the highest priority, and a 
station needs to defer for its corresponding AIFS interval. 
The smaller the parameter values (such as AIFS, CWmin 
and CWmax) the greater the probability of gaining access to 
the medium. Each AC within a station behaves like an 
individual virtual station: it contends for access to the 
medium and independently starts its backoff procedure after 
detecting the channel being idle for at least an AIFS period. 
The backoff procedure of each AC is the same as that of 
DCF. When a collision occurs among different ACs within 
the same station, the higher priority AC is granted the 
opportunity to transmit, while the lower priority AC suffers 
from a virtual collision, similar to a real collision outside the 
station. 
IEEE 802.11e EDCA defines a TXOPlimit as the time 
interval during which a particular station can initiate 
transmissions. During this period, defined by a starting time 
and a maximum duration, stations are allowed to transmit 
multiple data frames from the same AC continuously within 
the time limit defined by TXOPlimit [7]. In 802.11e EDCA 
the higher priority ACs have a longer TXOPlimit, while 
lower priority ACs have a shorter TXOPlimit. Priority 
differentiation used by EDCA ensures better service to high 
priority class while offering a minimum service for low 
priority traffic [8]. Although this mechanism improves the 
quality of service of real-time traffic, the performance 
obtained is not optimal since EDCA parameters cannot be 
adapted according to the network conditions.

B. IEEE 802.11n 
Although 802.11e adds the support of QoS, TXOP and 
block ACK, the inefficiency of channel utilization in legacy 
802.11 MAC is not fully solved. To satisfy the need of the

high-speed wireless network access today, the major target 
of IEEE 802.11n is to provide high throughput mechanism 
while allowing the coexistence of legacy 802.11 devices. To 
meet the requirements of high throughput, two possible 
methods can be applied. One is increasing the data rate in 
the physical layer (PHY layer), and the other is increasing 
the efficiency in the medium access layer (MAC layer) [9]. 
Based on the foundation of 802.11a/b/g/e, numerous new 
features in PHY and MAC layers are introduced to enhance 
the throughput of IEEE 802.11n WLAN [10]. 
To achieve high throughput in 802.11 wireless networks, 
the most commonly used method is to increase the raw data 
rate in the PHY layer. Legacy 802.11 PHY layer uses 
Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) system in 20 MHz 
bandwidth channel with one antenna. IEEE 802.11n 
expands the channel bandwidth to 40MHz to increase the 
channel capacity, and operates in OFDM scheme with the 
Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) technique [9]. 
Aggregation mechanism is the key feature to improve 
the 802.11 MAC transmission efficiency. Aggregation can 
enhance efficiency and channel utilization. The aggregation 
mechanism combines multiple data packets from the upper 
layer into one larger aggregated data frame for transmission 
[11]. Overhead in multiple frame transmissions is reduced 
since the header overhead and interframe time is saved. 
Aggregation scheme achieves higher system gain for 
application scenarios with small packets, for example, VoIP. 
Some frame aggregation mechanisms are illustrated in 
Figure 3 [6]. In Figure 3(a), a train of N PHY frames are 
sent one by one with no IFS. These frames can be 
transmitted to one or multiple destinations, and each 
destination station acknowledges the received frame in the 
same order after a short IFS (SIFS). In Figure 3(b), each 
destination station sends an ACK immediately after a SIFS 
when it successfully receives a frame. 
 
 
 
Figure 3. IEEE 802.11n Frame aggregation mechanisms [6]. 
 
Maximizing throughput may require a large aggregation 
frame with length longer than that specified in standard 
(4095 bytes). On the other hand, it is suggested that the total 
length of the aggregation frame should be smaller than a 
threshold since some huge frames may cause unfairness 
among stations. In addition, long data frames will result in 
large collision time and thus reduce the transmission 
efficiency when collision probability is high. In legacy 
802.11, the optional Request To Send/Clear To Send 
(RTS/CTS) is proposed to improve the transmission 
efficiency when the frame size is larger than a threshold (0–
2347 bytes). However, RTS/CTS in legacy 802.11 is 
employed by a pair of sender and receiver for unicast 
transmission and is not suitable for the downlink 
aggregation mechanism which may involve multiple 
destination stations. Therefore, modified RTS/CTS function 
can be used with downlink aggregation to reduce collisions 
resulting from large data frames, as shown in Figure 3(c).  
The 
above 
three 
mechanisms 
are 
PHY 
level 
aggregations. The PHY overhead can be reduced through 
MAC level aggregations, which are shown in Figure 3(d) 
and 3(e) for basic access mode and RTS/CTS mode, 
respectively. With these two mechanisms, N MAC frames 
for different destinations can be aggregated into one PHY 
frame [6]. After the (shared) PHY preamble and header, 
destination stations receive the scheduling information, 
based on which they can determine the time to receive the 
MFs if there is any. Using downlink multi-destination 
aggregation, the AP only needs to contend once to transmit 
an aggregated frame to multiple MNs, in contrast to 
multiple contentions and transmissions without frame 
aggregation. 
III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  
The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the comparison 
of the traffic video over IEEE 802.11e and over IEEE 
802.11n. All simulation is conducted with ns-2 [12], where 
to simulate 802.11e we use modules from NKCU Taiwan 
based on ns-2.28 [13] and to simulate 802.11n we use AFR 
modules [14] from Hamilton Institute Ireland based on ns-
2.30 [15]. Figure 4 shows the topology configuration used 
in our simulation. The topology consists of a multimedia 
server that connects to a WLAN Access Point (AP); an AP 
connects to a mobile node using 802.11e or 802.11n.

A. Simulation Setup  
In this section, we use ns-2 simulator to evaluate the 
performance of IEEE 802.11e and IEEE 802.11n. We 
choose 802.11 as the PHY layer, and the PHY data rate is 
set to 1 Mbps, 11 Mbps and 54 Mbps. The simulation 
parameters are shown in the Table 2.  
In our simulation we have considered three scenarios, 
namely scenario 1, scenario 2 and scenario 3. In each 
scenario all the stations are transmitting to the same 
destination. Scenario 1 and 2 consist of one VoIP 
connection, one video connection and two connections each 
of background traffic and best effort data. We use scenario 1 
to evaluate the performance of IEEE 802.11e and scenario 2 
to evaluate the performance of IEEE 802.11n. In scenario 3 
we increased the video transmission rate to be known 
maximum throughput of 802.11e and 802.11n. The best-
effort and background traffics have been created using CBR 
traffic with the sending rate of 256 Kbps. Consistent with 
802.11e specifications, VoIP traffic is carried under AC1, 
video under AC2, background traffic under AC3 and best 
effort data under AC4. In every scenario, the video traffic 
starts at 5 secs,VoIP traffic starts at 0.1 sec, video at 10 secs, 
BK traffic starts at 20 secs and BE traffic starts at 15 secs. 
B. 802.11e and 802.11n performance  
We compare the performance of 802.11e and 802.11n 
mechanism by simulating the scenario 1 and scenario 2, 
having one VoIP connections, one video connection and two 
BK/BE connections each.  
By comparing the Figure 5 and Figure 6, which plot the 
throughput of each traffic type, we observe that the 
throughputs of video and BE/BK data are significantly 
different from 802.11e and 802.11n, whereas the VoIP 
traffic is able to maintain its throughput in both cases. In 
Figure 5, we can observe that the throughput of video traffic 
drops from around 512 kbps to 400 kbps but still can get the 
throughput upto 500 kbps. This confirms that the video 
traffic is well served with the implemented QoS in 802.11e, 
while many video frames are dropped at the 802.11n where 
the throughput drops from 512Kbps to around 400kbps 
because 802.11n does not implement QoS. It can also be 
seen that the throughput of BE/BK traffic is low in 802.11e 
as compared to 802.11n because BE/BK have low traffic 
priority parameters.

Figure 7. IEEE 802.11e delay. 
 
Figure 9. IEEE 802.11e Packet lost. 
In Figure 7 and Figure 8, we observe that VoIP and 
video delay performance is improved via 802.11n. We can 
see that when the BE/BK traffic starts at 20 secs and 30 
secs, the voice frame delay and video frame delay have not 
increased in 802.11n as compared with 802.11e. Note that 
with 802.11n, the voice frame delay and video frame delay 
have better performance compared with 802.11e. It can also 
be seen that the delay for video traffic has improved in 
802.11n as compared to 802.11e when all the traffic flows 
exist in the network. The delay for BE/BK traffic is also 
better in the 802.11n compared with 802.11e. In Figure 9 we 
observe that VoIP packet lost via 802.11e is the average 
zero percent compared to Figure 10 where VoIP packet lost 
drop to ten percent via 802.11n. Video packet lost is 
increased via 802.11n and compared to 802.11e.  
These simulation results show that there is no service 
differentiation between the different types of traffic flows in 
802.11n, which causes the QoS problem for multimedia 
applications when traffic load is high. The 802.11e 
mechanism provides differentiated channel access for 
different traffic types and can be expected that the 802.11e 
can support real-time applications with voice and video 
traffic with a reasonable quality of service.

C. Comparison Analysis  
First we consider the scenario 1 and scenario 2, 
consisting of one VoIP connections, one video connection 
and two connections of each background traffic and best 
effort data. As mentioned above, the applications were start 
at different times so as to illustrate the impact of additional 
traffic streams on existing load. Figure 7 and Figure 8 show 
the delay performance of these traffic streams. The delay for 
VoIP frames is small (less than 1ms) from 0s to 0.1 ms, as it 
is the only traffic in the network so that it does not have to 
contend the channel with other sources. With the 
introduction of video traffic at 10ms, the delay for video 
frames increase to 0.2 ms whereas the delay for VoIP traffic 
is about 0.1 ms. It can be observed that when the BK/BE 
traffic is started at 20 secs and 30 secs, the delay for video 
and VoIP does not increased.  
Next we simulate the scenario 3, in which we decrease 
the data rate from 1 Mbps to 0.5 Mbps. In Figure 11 the 
impact of decreasing the highest priority video connections 
can be seen on the delay performance of low priority traffic, 
when all the traffic streams present. The delay for video 
321

frames increases to 0.25s via 802.11e as compared to 0.15s 
via 802.11n, also the delay for video traffic via 802.11e at 
data rate 1 Mbps relatively same as via 802.11n. Thus, the 
impact of decreasing data rate can be seen on the delay 
performance of video traffic over 802.11e. 
In scenario 3, we decrease the data rate of 802.11e and 
802.11n to 0.5 Mbps. In figure 11 we observe that the 
decrease in low priority traffic does not have any negative 
impact on the delay of higher priority traffic. It can be seen 
that the delay for VoIP and video traffic is nearly same for 
both low BK/BE traffic and high BK/BE traffic. Comparing 
to data rate load change, decreases data rate in 802.11n load 
does not affect video delay in Figure 11 compare to 
decreases data rate in 802.11e, video delay relatively 
increase.

IV. CONCLUSION  
In this paper, we have evaluated the 802.11e and 
802.11n mechanisms to transmit video traffic over WLAN. 
Through our simulations, we compared the 802.11e with the 
802.11n in order to show that 802.11e provides 
differentiated channel access for different traffic types and 
is better equipped than 802.11n to handle real time 
applications with stringent QoS requirements likes VoIP 
and video. We conclude that with heavily loaded traffic 
connections under non-negligible background traffic, the 
802.11n mechanism is not able to provide QoS guarantee. 
However, it can give better delay performance compared to 
802.11e. 
Our simulation result shows that 802.11n have better 
total throughput of 15 Mbps compared with 802.11e which 
only has 6 Mbps. We found out that 802.11n must 
implement QoS mechanism to support video to get a stable 
throughput during transmission.
