Abstract—The adoption of a new Electronic Health Record 
(EHR) is a disruptive event for hospitals influencing the 
satisfaction and performance of clinicians. In Norway, the four 
health regions (South-East, West, Central, and North) have used 
several EHR systems for decades. This study analyses the 
satisfaction of clinical users and determines which features of 
the EHR that should be prioritized to improve clinicians’ 
satisfaction. In addition, findings show a relatively high 
frequency of interruptions that could affect secure and easy 
access for the health care professionals to information about the 
patients. Finally, differences are found within the same EHR 
regarding clinical user satisfaction, meaning that the context 
significantly impacts the satisfaction.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Digitalization programs in the EU and US have spread the 
adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHR) [1][2]. EHRs 
have evolved from electronic journals for note keeping into 
integrated health information systems that provide a holistic 
view of most patient clinical information and actively support 
clinical users in decision making through Computerized 
Clinical Decision Support Systems. Examples include 
infobuttons, medication alerts, and computerized medication 
order entry [3]. While the functionalities of EHRs have been 
significantly expanded, there are concerns about their actual 
usefulness and perceived benefit [4]. Some studies point out 
that the amount of work required by EHR interaction 
contributes to clinical burnout due to a focus on long-term 
outcome measures and reimbursement rather than the actual 
value of daily practice [5]. International research is often 
focusing on usability, safety, quality, functionality, and 
satisfaction [6][7][8]. Developing e-health indicators is a 
relatively new focus in the field. Nordic eHealth Research 
Network (NeRN) works on standard Nordic e-health 
indicators [9].  
In the last decade, Norway has increased the investments 
on eHealth initiatives to meet the future need of the 
healthcare sector. This wave of digitalization is in line with 
the national white paper 9, ´One citizen – one Health Record´ 
[10]. This white paper states that: a) secure and easy access 
for the health care professionals to information about the 
patients is required; b) citizens should have access to safe and 
accessible digital services; and, c) clinical data should be 
available for monitoring, management, and research. 
One of the actions towards addressing these requirements 
has been the deployment of a newer EHR system in three 
(North, South-East, and West) out of four health regions. A 
fact that directly impacts clinicians' daily work.  
This change has raised the need to evaluate clinicians' 
user experience to understand if the investments in new EHRs 
have improved clinical users' experience. A previous study in 
2019 published an initial evaluation with three hospitals from 
two health regions and a total of 208 wholly answered 
questionaries [11]. This study targeted the use of the currently 
implemented EHR systems, focusing on clinical task support 
and the overall satisfaction with the EHR. Each of these three 
hospitals had implemented DIPS (Distributed information 
and patient data system in hospitals) Classic (DIPS, DIPS 
ASA, Bodø) over the previous years, 2010-2014. However, 
these three hospitals covered only two main cities in Norway, 
corresponding to two neighbouring regional health 
administrations (South-East Norway and West Norway, 
respectively). This paper expands the former study by 
including data from University Hospital North Norway 
(North Norway health region) and St. Olav Hospital (Central 
Norway health region), which allows us to cover all the four 
health regions in Norway. 
 Nurses and doctors were asked to specify functionalities 
that worked well in their EHRs and functionalities that 
required further improvement. This extension of the 2019 
study attempts to determine if the results from the previous 
survey also hold for all Health Regions in Norway and 
elucidate the effect of the latest eHealth developments on 
clinical users. 
This paper is organized as follows: Section II explains the 
methods used, where questionnaires and statistical methods 
are explained. Section III presents the survey results, 
focusing on the three types of satisfaction. Tables and figures 
illustrate the results. Section IV describes ethical 
considerations. In section V, general findings of the three 
types of satisfaction are discussed, and a comparison between 
national data and data from the study including only two

health regions. Section VI concludes in relation to significant 
findings from this national survey. In addition, it summarises 
how the findings can be understood and how suppliers and 
regional health authorities can make use of the findings.  
II. METHODS 
In this section we focus on the questionnaire, statistical 
methods in use, as well as the data collection.  
A. 
Setting 
 We approached clinical users from the newly 
implemented EHRs at Haukeland University Hospital (HUH), 
University Hospital of North Norway (UNN), Trondheim 
University Hospital (St. Olav), and Oslo University Hospital 
(OUH). These hospitals belong to the four Regional Health 
Authorities in Norway, which allows us to cover the whole 
country. Except for St. Olav, all hospitals had been involved 
in the transition from their previous system, DocuLive 
(DocuLive EPR, Siemens Medical Systems Norway, Oslo)., 
into the new system, DIPS Classic. Specifically, OUH, HUH, 
and UNN have been implementing the new her since 2010, 
and St. Olavs has been implementing theirs since 1999.  
Before 2006, DocuLive was a system of journal 
documents mainly used by clinicians for reading and signing 
clinical documents and laboratory results. The system lacked 
integration with the patient administrative system. DocuLive 
added functionality to scan documents into the system, e.g., 
forms and response reports. At the same time, DIPS Classic 
was regarded as a complete system with a patient 
administrative system, patient journal, laboratory system, and 
an integrated system for psychiatry [12]. 
The fundamental reasons for changing the system were a 
lack of necessary functionality and a lack of integration 
between the journal system and the patient administrative 
system. In addition, the government took over the ownership 
of the public hospitals in Norway in 2002 [13]. The regional 
health trusts promoted the standardisation of health 
information systems. For example, in the Northern Health 
Region, where UNN was the only hospital in the health region 
using DocuLive, switching to DIPS was seen as a common-
sense decision. 
B. 
Data collection 
A total of 506 clinicians (nurses and physicians) were 
contacted in 2018. Response rates were 35.0%, 22.0%, and 
29.0% for physicians, nurses, and all clinicians, respectively. 
Surveys from UNN, St. Olav, and HUH were gathered with 
the following responses: n=87 physicians, n=60 nurses, n=147 
in total. We issued ten reminders to the respondents in the 
period from September to December 2018 and four reminders 
to their superiors. Some superiors also reminded the 
respondents in person at a joint meeting. The availability of 
clinical functionality varied between units and wards in the 
same units. 
Email lists for the employees in the units were collected 
from the institutions themselves. Respondents were selected 
using a random number generator [14]. 
For OUH, surveys were gathered from 2015/2016 (n=152 
physicians), and details about data collection, methods, and 
results are published elsewhere [11]. 
Regarding inclusion criteria, participants were physicians 
and nurses who worked full time at any participant hospitals 
in 2018, and only physicians who worked full time in 2015/16. 
Respondents who stated that they did not actively work with 
patients were excluded. A total of 299 individuals, of which 
239 (79.9%) were physicians and 60 (20.1%) were nurses, 
completed the questionnaire (see Table 1). Forty-six worked 
at Haukeland University Hospital (HUH), 39 worked at 
University Hospital of North Norway (UNN), and 62 worked 
at St. Olavs hospital – Trondheim University Hospital (St. 
Olav), and 152 worked at OUH. Data from OUH was only 
available for one year (2015/16), but no new questionnaires 
were filled out for the following years in this hospital. Still, 
we kept the results from OUH to cover the regional health 
area. Data were stratified by both time and organization to 
deal with this limitation. Table I shows the amounts of 
respondents to questionnaires gathered by hospital and 
clinical role. 
C. 
Questionnaire 
The web-based survey tool Questback (Questback, Oslo, 
Norway) was used for the online questionnaire. Questback 
allows users to record their responses anonymously and 
preserve their privacy remotely. The questionnaire was 
piloted among nine representatives of the target group. Some 
content was revised based on feedback from the pilot group. 
Questions were dynamically designed to ensure that the 
respondents were only asked about relevant things for their 
stated place of work and role (physician or nurse). Some 
questions were sent to both nurses and physicians, while parts 
of the survey specifically targeted one of the professions. The 
survey also included several broad questions, which the 
respondents were allowed to answer freely.   
The survey was developed based on past research using a 
previously validated questionnaire [15][16]. Changes were 
made as the old questionnaire was too extensive and tailored 
for physicians only. This new questionnaire is an early effort 
toward developing clinical user satisfaction and interruptions 
indicators. The new questionnaire used a 5-point Likert scale 
(‘Completely disagree’, ‘Partially disagree’, ‘Neutral’, 
‘Partially agree, ‘Completely agree’). Some questions were 
only rated as agree/disagree. The overview of the questions in 
the questionnaire can be accessed online [17].  
The questionnaire was structured in 3 main sections, all 
related to various dimensions of satisfaction. The first 
dimension was satisfaction with the EHR functionalities, 
which contained 11 items. The second dimension was related 
to generic aspects of the EHR system, which contained four 
items. The third dimension was related to overall satisfaction 
with the EHR system, which contained only one item.   
D. 
Analysis/statistical methods 
The main statistical methods used for analysis were 
frequency (percentage) for discrete variables and mean for 
continuous variables. The Pearson chi-square test was used for 
comparison. The level of significance was considered as 0.05.

The statistical software SPSS 25 version was used for the 
analysis. In the process of cleaning data, we had to address 
missing values. For EHR functionality satisfaction, there were 
no missing values. For EHR generic satisfaction and EHR 
overall satisfaction, missing values were n=48 (15.7%) and 
n=47 (14.6%), respectively. The easiest way is to remove the 
incomplete records. In the case of lacking enough sample size, 
this procedure is not proper to deal with missing values. 
Several imputation techniques have been suggested in 
situations where the missingness is completely random 
(MCAR). MCAR implies no systematic reasons for 
missingness [18]. Little [19] provided the chi-square test for 
the MCAR assumption to check that the missingness is 
completely random. While providing the comparison between 
health regions/satisfaction profession/satisfaction, we applied 
the MCAR assumption by Little (Chi-Square=502.988, 
df=512, p=.604). The results confirmed that the missingness 
is MCAR. Then, we imputed our missing records with the 
neither-nor value. 
E. 
Ethics 
The Regional Committee for Medical and Health 
Research Ethics South-East Norway has been consulted. 
According to national regulations ethics, approval was not 
required because the study did not involve biomedical 
research, and all data were anonymized.  
III. EASE OF USE 
This section will present the baseline data and 
questionnaire results. Further there will be a presentation of 
the three types of satisfaction. 
A. 
Baseline data 
Table I contains the baseline data by year, location, and 
participants clinical role. The medical field with the highest 
number of participants was the aggregation of those treating 
surgical, woman-related, and cancer conditions, with n=138 
(46.0%). The following fields with the highest number of 
participants were related to neurological, orthopaedics, and 
rehabilitation conditions n=98 (33.0%), followed by medical, 
heart/lung, and other conditions with n=35 (12.0%), 21 
(7.0%), and 7 (2.0%), respectively. 
B. 
Questionnaire results 
There were two questions related to interruptions of the 
clinical workflow while using the EHR. The first one regarded 
interruption caused by login requests; results range from 4 to 
50 interruptions per day (outliers removed). The mean number 
of interruptions per day is 17.21. The corresponding number 
from the 2019 study was 17.15. The second one regarded the 
number of interruptions due to the EHR hanging or crashing. 
The mean number of interruptions is 3.08, corresponding to 
one interruption per week in the scale used. The corresponding 
numbers from the 2019 study was 2.95, slightly less than once 
a week. Almost 70% of respondents reported interruptions 
that ranged between once a year and once a week, 30%

C. 
EHR functionality satisfaction 
Table II presents the responses about satisfaction with 
specific EHR functionalities. 
Regarding aggregated EHR function satisfaction for all 11 
questions, 47.0% of respondents reported to be satisfied, 
35.0% were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, and 18.0% were 
not satisfied (see Fig. 1). The corresponding numbers from the 
2019 study was 59.0%, 26.0%, and 15.0%, respectively. 
If we observe the functionalities in Table II, the one rated 
with the highest satisfaction was question 1, where 72.0% of 
respondents were satisfied with the function allowing them to 
read sample responses from medical biochemistry. The lowest 
satisfaction was related to question 11, which refers to the 
overall overview of the patient´s drug treatment, where only 
29.0% of the respondents were satisfied. The corresponding 
numbers from the 2019 study was 84.0% and 33.0%, 
respectively. 
Questions 2 to 5 have the second-highest satisfaction rate, 
between 55.5% to 69.0%. For these questions, the range of 
respondents who answered that they were neither satisfied nor 
dissatisfied was 11.0% to 17.5%. The corresponding numbers 
from the 2019 study was between 58.0% to 70.0% and 19.0% 
to 31.0%, for satisfaction and neither-nor, respectively.

Figure 1.  EHR functionality satisfaction. 
Questions 11, 10, 6, and 8 have the highest dissatisfaction 
rates, with more than a 20.0% of respondents answering that 
they were not satisfied. This is the same as for the 2019 study. 
Questions 6, 7, and 8 have the highest indifferent rate 
(nighter satisfied nor dissatisfied). From the 2019 study, 
questions 11, 9, 6 ans 7 have the highest indifferent rate.  
For the aggregated dataset containing all health regions, 
the differences by clinical role differences were not significant 
(p<0.603). Nurses (20.4% satisfaction) are less satisfied than 
physicians (79.6%), which is not significant (p>0.05). 
There were no significant differences among health 
regions (p>0.05). Likewise, the difference between the central 
region (St. Olav), which used the DocuLive system, and the 
other three regions, which used DIPS Classic, was not 
significant (p>0.05). 
 
D. 
EHR generic satisfaction 
Generic EHR satisfaction refers to effectiveness, high 
quality, worth time and effort, and user-friendliness.  
A total of 39.3% of respondents were satisfied, 24.8% of 
respondents reported that they were neither satisfied nor 
dissatisfied, and the remaining 35.9% reported being 
dissatisfied (see Fig. 2). The corresponding numbers from the 
2019 study was 40.1%, 23.2%, and 36.7%, respectively. 
By clinical role, the difference was significant (p<0.001). 
Nurses (33.6% satisfaction) are less satisfied than physicians 
(66.4% satisfaction). 
The generic satisfaction between regions West (18.0% 
satisfaction), Central (25% satisfaction), North (18.8% 
satisfaction), and South-East (38.3% satisfaction) was 
significant (p<0.001). However, when comparing the region 
with DocuLive (Central) with the other three regions using 
DIPS Classic, no significant differences were found for EHR 
generic satisfaction (p>0.05). 
 
E. 
EHR Overall satisfaction 
Overall satisfaction was addressed through a single item. 
A total of 34.7% of respondents were satisfied, 24.4% of 
respondents reported that they were neither satisfied nor  
 
Figure 2.  EHR overall satisfaction. 
dissatisfied, and the remaining 40.8% reported being 
dissatisfied (see Fig. 3). The corresponding numbers from the 
2019 study for overall satisfaction was 37.5%, 21.5%, and 
41.0%, respectively. 
The overall satisfaction by clinical role was significant 
(p<0.001). Nurses (36.3% satisfied) are less satisfied than 
physicians (63.7% satisfied). 
The overall satisfaction by regions West (17.6%), Central 
(22.0%), North (20.9%), South-East (39.6%) was found to be 
significant (p<0.05). However, the overall satisfaction for the 
region with DocuLive (Central) was not significant when 
compared with the group of the other three regions using DIPS 
Classic (p> 0.05).  
IV. DISCUSSION 
The discussion will focus on different types of 
satisfaction and the more generic findings. 
A. 
EHR functionality satisfaction 
Four questions had the lowest score about EHR 
functionality satisfaction. These were related to the overall 
overview of patients' drug treatment, the assessment of the 
proper priority of care, the concrete plan for patient 
assessment, communication with the patient about health 
information, and prescriptions of drug treatments. These are 
the main functionalities that vendors should prioritize when 
developing new versions of their products.  
B. 
EHR generic satisfaction 
Most of the respondents were satisfied with the generic 
functionality of the EHR. The proportion of respondents being 
indifferent or dissatisfied adds up to almost 61%. Although 
this does not indicate a clear need for product replacement, it

Figure 3.  EHR generic satisfaction. 
points out a significant room for improvement in current 
EHRs' generic satisfaction. Vendors should prioritize 
understanding why almost 36% of users are dissatisfied. Also, 
they should understand more about the requirements from 
users in general to improve satisfaction, so more users are 
fully satisfied.   
C. 
EHR overall satisfaction 
With regards to overall satisfaction, there is a significant 
portion of respondents that reported to be overall dissatisfied 
(40.8%). Interestingly, this level of dissatisfaction is higher 
than the score found when measuring specific functionality 
dissatisfaction. This may indicate that, even though users 
were not dissatisfied with specific functionalities, the 
integration of functionalities in the system workflow 
increases overall dissatisfaction. Vendors should consider 
better integration of their functionality in clinicians’ 
workflow.   
D. 
Generic findings 
Differences in overall satisfaction were significant 
depending on the clinical role and could be interpreted as 
differences in the satisfaction of role-specific functionality. 
Physicians were overall more satisfied than nurses for the 
three dimensions of satisfaction and could be interpreted as a 
requirement for improving nurse-specific functionality.  
No significant differences were found in the EHR used 
(DocuLive vs. DIPS classic). However, there were significant 
differences among regions regarding generic satisfaction and 
overall satisfaction. We interpret this finding as a difference 
arising from differences in the deployment context, but there 
is no evidence of this difference coming from the system 
itself (DIPS Classic vs. DocuLive). 
The high number of interruptions (number of logins a day 
and EHR hanging or crashing) could directly affect security 
and easy access for healthcare personnel. The high frequency 
of interruptions indicates that the first goal from the 
government stated in the whitepaper “one citizen - one Health 
Record” (secure and easy access for the health care 
professionals to information about the patients is required) is 
still not covered good enough. Missing on this goal will have 
consequences for both citizens and healthcare professionals. 
It should provide patients and residents with safer and better 
treatment and health professionals a more uncomplicated 
working day. 
E. 
Comparison with study including two health regions 
The previous study from 2019 [11] included only 
physicians from two health regions. For this reason, there will 
be no comparison of regions or professions.  
There are no significant differences in the number of 
interruptions of the clinical workflow while using the EHR.  
Aggregated EHR function satisfaction for all 11 questions 
shows almost the same response for dissatisfaction. More 
respondents were satisfied in the 2019 study. Both studies 
report the same function with the highest satisfaction and the 
same for the function with the lowest satisfaction for the EHR 
functionalities. The response pattern for the other 
functionalities is almost similar between the two studies. Our 
interpretation is that the decrease in satisfaction could be a 
regional effect as OUH got the new DIPS Classic with new 
functionality one year before the survey. The new regions had 
several years of experience with the system when the 
responded to the survey. The inclusion of nurses could cause 
one other explanation as they reported less satisfaction in this 
new study.   
Generic EHR satisfaction is almost identical for the two 
studies. It seems like the inclusion of more hospitals/regions, 
and other professions do not change this effect. Even though, 
the EHR functional satisfaction is lower in the new study, the 
satisfaction regarding effectiveness, perceived quality, and 
user-friendliness is persistent.  
The EHR overall satisfaction was addressed through a 
single item and persistent on a national level.   
V. CONCLUSION 
This study has analysed hospitals from the four health 
regions in Norway. No differences in generic or overall 
satisfaction were found when including data for all four health 
regions in Norway. Data from the study using only two health 
regions was higher than for the one with all four health 
regions. No differences in satisfaction were found between the 
two types of EHRs. Significant differences are found within 
the same EHR, meaning that the context significantly impacts 
the satisfaction attributed to the EHR. A substantial portion of 
users reported not being fully satisfied with their EHR. Nurses 
were the group less satisfied, and functionalities related to 
showing the broad overview of patients are where vendors 
should concentrate their efforts to respond to user 
requirements and improve their satisfaction. 
The EHR vendors and regional health authorities should 
also be focusing on bridging the gap between the goal for 
secure and easy access to patient data and the relatively high 
number of interruptions experienced by the clinical users.
