INTRODUCTION
Recently, the demand for the solution of road traffic
problems such as accidents, congestion and the associated
environmental pollution, has significantly increased. By
enabling
wireless
communication
among
vehicles
and
between vehicles and infrastructure, the safety and the
efficiency of road traffic can be substantially improved.
Current solutions, such as intelligent traffic control systems,
provide communication infrastructures
along
the road;
vehicular communication and likewise, are research trends
under the area of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)
[1], [2] and [3].
Several modes of vehicular communications, such as
infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V), vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and
vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) are becoming increasingly
popular, boosted by navigation safety requirements [4].
Recently, LED-based optical wireless communication
has been also proposed for car to car message delivery. This
option turned out to be particularly effective in short range
direct communications to explore Line-of-Sight (LoS) and
overcome the issues related to the isotropic nature of radio
waves. One additional benefit of LEDs is that they can
switch to different light intensities at a very fast rate. This
functionality has given rise to a novel communication
technology (Visible Light Communication - VLC) where
LED luminaires can be used for high speed data transfer [5],
[6]. In the recent past, we have developed a WDM device
that
enhances
the
transmission
capacity
of
optical
communications in the visible range. When different visible
signals are encoded in the same optical transmission path [7],
[8] the device multiplexes the different optical channels,
performs
different
filtering
processes
(amplification,
switching, and wavelength conversion) and finally decodes
the encoded signals recovering the transmitted information.
This device is used as a receiver. Therefore, by utilizing
VLC
between
vehicles,
drivers
are
given
a
clearer
knowledge of the preceding and nearby vehicles status.
In this paper, a traffic scenario is established. The
transmitters and the receivers are characterized. To achieve
vehicular communication (V2V) 4 bit string color messages
in the visible range and their three parity bits for error
control are used to transmit a codeword that is received and
decoded by the SiC pinpin devices. Code and parity
multiplex/demultiplex
(MUX/DEMUX)
signals
are
designed, transmitted and analyzed. The dependence of
distance between the transmitter and receiver on the shape
and magnitude of the encoded signal is presented. Driving
range distance is discussed and tested using the VLC system.
The proposed smart vehicle lighting system considers
wireless communication, computer based algorithms and
smart sensor and optical sources network, which builds a
transdisciplinary approach framed in cyber-physical systems.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section I, the
introduction is present and in Section II, the system design is
explained. Section III reports the encoder/decoder method

and in Section IV, the driving distance is analyzed. Finally,
in Section V, conclusions are drawn.

SYSTEM DESIGN
A.
The traffic scenario
White RGB-LEDs using WDM can achieve higher data
transfer rates and can also be used for lighting purposes [9].
For data transmission, we propose the use of two headlights
based on commercially available modulated white RGB-
LEDs. For data receiving and decoding, three a-SiC:H
double pin/pin optical processors symmetrically distributed
at the vehicle tail are used (see Figure 1).
This VLC system enables the data transmission between
vehicles, which is crucial to stack the information concerning
the status of the vehicle (e.g., brake, speed, acceleration,
engine failure, traffic congestion). To build a one-way VLC
system that allows a feedback channel between the leader
vehicle and the follower vehicle. The follower vehicle is
assumed to be equipped with two headlamps transmitters.
They send a codeword message [RGBV: PR, PG, PB]
composed of red, green, blue and violet 4-binary bits (four
input data bits [R G B V]) and generate three additional
parity bits [PR, PG, PB] for easy decoding and error control
[10]. The parity bits are SUM bits of the three-bit additions
of violet pulsed signal, with two additional bits of RGB. The
leader vehicle is assumed to be equipped with three a-SiC
pinpin receivers to detect optical messages, as in Figure 1.
The spacing of the two transmitters is fixed while their
distance to the receivers varies and depends on the speed (v1,
v2). Both transmitters are oriented towards the receivers.

Figure 1. Illustration of the V2V. Use Case: the follower vehicle
sends the message that is received by the leader and can be
retransmitted for the next car.
In Figure 2, the geometrical relation between the two
vehicles (leader vehicle and follower vehicle) and the
separating distances (A, B and C) are displayed. Here, the
follower vehicle sends the information using the modulated
light from the headlamps forming a lighting coverage. The
leader vehicle receives and decodes the message in three
separated receivers at the tail and compares them. It was
assumed that each LED chip sends light only perpendicular
to the semiconductor's surface, and a few degrees to the side,
which results in a light cone pattern (Figure 2). Three
situations are possible: A, the vehicles are at a safety
distance and the three sensors receive the same message with
the same intensity; B, the vehicles are in a warning distance,
they are approaching and the left and the right sensor receive
the same message but at the middle sensor the message
arrives with double intensity; C the vehicles are too close, in
the automatic braking distance, and the same message arrives
to the left and to the right sensor and no message is read out
by the middle one. Based on that, the driving range distance
is calculated and a warning is sent to the driver or eventually
activates the automatic braking system.

The usage of trichromatic RGB-LEDs as transmitters
offers the possibility of WDM which can greatly increase the
transmission data rate. For data transmission, we use
commercially available violet and white RGB-LEDs whose
spectra is displayed in Figure 3.
The output spectra of the white LED contains three peaks
assigned to the colors red, green and blue that mixed together
provide the white perception to the eye. They are used for
lighting purposes and when modulated, to transmit data.

violet modulated LED [V] was added to increase data
transmission and to generate parity bits [11] that allow error
control [12].
For data transmission an on-off keying (OOK) code was
used. In Figure 4, an example of the digital signals
(codeword) used to drive the LEDs is displayed. All the
sixteen (24) on/off possible combinations of the 4 input
channels (RGBV) are reported as well the corresponding
parity bits. The arrow sets the seven bit [1111:111]

Here, the Hamming (7,4) code [11] encodes the 4 bits

and generates three additional parity bits, i.e., the parity bits
are SUM bits of the three-bit additions of violet pulsed signal
with two additional bits of RGB [12] and are given by:

Receiver
The optoelectronic sensor is a double pin heterostructure
produced by Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition
(PECVD) sandwiched between two transparent conductive
contacts (TCO). The device configuration is shown in Figure
5. In the stacked structure, p-i'(a-SiC:H)-n/p-i(a-Si:H)-n, the
intrinsic layer of the front p-i-n photodiode in made of a-
SiC:H while the back intrinsic layer is based on a-Si:H. The
deposition conditions and optoelectronic characterization of
the single layers and device as well as their optimization
were described in [8] and [13]. Both front and back diodes
act as optical filters confining, respectively, the optical
carriers produced by the blue and red photons, while the
optical carriers generated by the green photons are absorbed
across both.

decreases the violet, while back irradiation has the opposite
effect (see arrows in the figure).
The gathered data confirms that the optical gain, under
irradiation, depends on the irradiated side and on the
incoming wavelength acting as an active filter for the input
channels [14]. Under front irradiation, the long wavelength
channels are enhanced and the short wavelength channels
quenched while the opposite occurs under back irradiation.

ENCODER /DECODER
The algorithm to decode the information is relatively
straightforward and the knowledge of the background acting
as selector that chooses one or more of the 2n sublevels (with
n being the number of transmitted channels) and their n-bit
binary code makes the communication reliable [15].

Code and parity MUX/DEMUX signals under 390 nm

In Figure 7, the received data, i.e., the MUX code signal,
due to the combination of four (400 nm, 470 nm, 530 nm,
626 nm) input channels and the correspondent parity bits are
displayed under front irradiation. The solid lines show the
MUX signal that arises from the transmission of the four (R,
G, B, V) wavelength channels. The dashed line marks the
synchronized parity MUX signal transmitted with the data
code. Due to the different optical gains, the colors red, green
and blue were assigned respectively to the transmission of
PR, PG and PB. The sixteen ordered levels (d0-d15) of the data
MUX signal are pointed out at the correspondent levels, and
the ordered eight levels (p0-p7) ascribed to the parity bits are
displayed as horizontal dotted lines. On the right hand side of
Figure 7, the correspondence between the parity levels and
the parity bits is shown. In the top, the decoded seven bit
word [R,G,B,V, PR, PG, PB] of the transmitted inputs is
displayed. Results show that each of the 2n possible on/off
states corresponds to a well-defined level. In Figure 7, all the
on/off states are possible hence, 24 ordered levels are
detected
(d0-d15)
and
correspond
to
all
the
possible
combinations of the on/off states. Under front irradiation,
each of those n channels is enhanced or quenched differently,
resulting in an increase of red/green magnitude and a
decrease on the blue/violet magnitude. In the sequence, by
assigning each output level to a n digit binary code (weighted
by the optical gain of the each channel), the signal can be
decoded. A maximum transmission rate capability of 30 kbps
was achieved in a four channel transmission.
The proximity of the magnitude of consecutive levels
(Figure
7)
causes
occasional
errors
in
the
decoded
information that is corrected using the parity bits. For
instance, levels d1, d2, and d3 have similar magnitude and can
be confused when reading a word message, however their
parity levels, respectively, p7, p5 and p2, are quite different.
The parity of the word is checked after reading the word. The
word is accepted if the parity of the bits read out is correct. If
the parity of the bits is incorrect, an error is detected and
should be corrected [12].

To automate the process of recovering the original

transmitted information is decoded by comparing both the
signal from the code and parity MUX levels under front
irradiation, as shown in Figure 7. The decoding algorithm is
based on a proximity search [16]. The vector components are
determined by the signal currents I1 and I2, where I1 (d

measured
simultaneously, under front optical bias, for the 4-bit
codeword (RGBV) and for the 3-bit parity [PR, PG PB]. The
result is then compared with all vectors obtained from a
calibration sequence (see Figure 7) where each code level,
d(0-31), is assigned the correspondent parity level, p(0-15).
The color bits of the nearest calibration point are assigned to
the time slot. An Euclidean metric is applied to measure the
distances. We have tested the algorithm with different
random sequences of the channels and we have recovered the
original color bits, as shown in the top of Figure 8.

DRIVING DISTANCE
Lumens of light emitted by an LED depend on the
current passing through the LED. For the luminous path loss
(LL), the conversion of the current flowing through the LED
to lumens is given by [17].

where D is the distance between the LED and the receiver.
The light generated by an LED is directly proportional to the
forward current flowing through the device. In order to
analyze the influence of white LED brightness (headlight-
like) on the sensor response, the drive current applied to each
chip was changed, keeping all the same level for equal white
perception. The intensity of the violet LED was kept constant
at 30 mA. Each chip was modulated as shown on the top of
Figure 7. In Figure 9a, the MUX signal is displayed for
different applied drive currents. In Figure 9b, the [1111] code
level magnitudes, d15, (arrow in Figure 9a) as a function of
the drive current is displayed. The dotted curve shows the
trend of the photocurrent with the relative distance from the
receiver to the transmitter. Experimental results show that as
the drive current increases, the intensity of the MUX signal
also increases, but its shape remains the same. The sixteen
levels, each one ascribed to an on/off possible state, are all
detected
allowing
at
the
receiver
the
demultiplexing
operation and the recovery of the transmitted information.
Figure 9b, also shows that the code levels magnitude
increases in a fast rate up to driving currents around 10 mA
and then the photocurrent keeps increasing with the driving
current but at a slow rate. Here, if we plot the photocurrent as
a function of the one over the square of the driving current
(dot plot) we can map the relative distances between the
receiver and the transmitter. If the irradiance is calibrated for
a known separation between the transmitter and the receiver,
the irradiance at a given distance can be calculated using the
inverse square law, hence, as the photocurrent increases the
relative distance decreases exponentially. Three regions are
detected: region A where the photocurrent decreases slowly
with the distance; region B where its decrease is gradual; and
region C, where a fast decrease occurs. These three regions
can be directly correlated with the inter-vehicle driving
distance from Figure 2, after a calibration. So, by measuring
the photocurrent at fixed code level it enables the prediction
of the distance between vehicles and provides information to
warn the driver about the safety distance (Figure 2). This
warning can be transmitted through one of the four available
channels.
The VLC system compares the three received messages
and infers the driving distance between the leader and the
follower vehicles by reading the magnitude of the higher
level (dash dot arrow in the figure) in the middle sensor. A
warning message should be sent if the distance is lower than
the safety distance.

We have simulated the scenario B (Figure 2). The drive

same and adjusted in order to have the same lighting
conditions of this region. Here, the right and the left sensor
receive the same message and the one in the middle receives
the overlap of both. We have applied to the RGB LED a
current of the order of 4 mA and 30 mA to the violet one. In
Figure 10, the received MUX signals on the right and left
sensors or in the middle one are displayed. The solid lines
are ascribed to the MUX data word and the dotted lines to
the correspondent parity MUX. The same 4:3 binary
information

sent
simultaneously by both LEDs.
As expected, the shape of both code and parity MUX
signals are the same but the intensity in the middle sensor
(≅1 µA) is almost twice of the one received in the two others
(≅0.5 µA).

CONCLUSION
In
this paper, a
VLC
system,
for vehicle
safety
applications, was presented. The system is composed of a
VLC transmitter that modulates the light produced by white
RGB-LEDs, and by VLC receivers based on photosensitive
elements (a-SiC:H pinpin photodiodes) that code and decode
the modulated signals. A scenario for the VLC system was
tested and analyzed and a traffic scenario was simulated. By
reading out in the receivers the magnitude of the multiplexed
signal, it was possible, concurrently, to decode a transmitted
message and to infer the driving distance between the
transmitter and the receiver.
