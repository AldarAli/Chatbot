Abstract—In wireless relay networks based on IEEE 802.16j,
each relay node has its own service area that provides wireless
Internet access service to the client terminal. The performance
of such networks is heavily affected by how each relay node
determines its service area size. In order to determine the
service area size for each relay node, it is important to use
the location information of other neighboring nodes and their
service area sizes. However, in general, such information is
completely unknown or only partially known. In the present
paper, we introduce three methods to determine the service
area size, each of which assumes a different level of the
knowledge regarding neighboring nodes. We conduct extensive
simulation experiments to evaluate the performance of these
three methods in terms of coverage ratio, service area overlap
characteristics, energy consumption, and utilization efﬁciency
of wireless network resources. We conﬁrm the trade-off re-
lationships between the knowledge level and performance for
these three methods.

I. INTRODUCTION
IEEE 802.16j relay networks [2] (hereinafter referred to
as relay networks), which are often referred to as wireless
mesh networks, have received signiﬁcant attention as exten-
sible, cost-effective means to provide a wide-area wireless
broadband access environment. In relay networks, each relay
node connects to other relay nodes through wireless links
so that the overall topology becomes a tree-like structure,
as shown in Figure 1. Each relay node is connected to the
Internet through a gateway node that has a wired connection
to the Internet. The relay node provides wireless Internet
access service to client terminals within its service area.
Generally, the wireless channel used for communication
between relay nodes and client terminals is different from
that used among relay nodes. Communication quality for
client terminals is heavily affected by the service area
construction. In an area where multiple service areas overlap,
the communication quality for the client terminals degrades

due to radio interference. IEEE 802.16 uses the TDMA-
based transmission mechanism, which assigns time slots to
each communication link between relay nodes and client
terminals. This means that the links in the overlap area
would be assigned different time slots in order to avoid
transmission collapse. Therefore, when the overlap area size
becomes large or the number of overlapping areas increases,
the total number of time slots required for all communication
links increases, which decreases the network throughput.
Furthermore, since IEEE 802.16 uses the contention-based
mechanism for client terminals to join the network [3, 4],
service area overlaps would increase access collisions.
On the other hand, we should increase the total coverage
ratio to provide wide-area and uniform service to client
terminals. One possible way to do this is to increase the
service area size for each relay node, but this increases the
service area overlaps. Furthermore, this also increases the
energy consumption of the relay nodes. In other words, there
are complex trade-off relationships among network perfor-
mance, energy consumption, coverage ratio, and service area
overlaps.
In order to determine the service area size for each relay
node, the information on the location of other neighboring
nodes is quite important. However, such information is un-

known, especially when considering the random installation
of relay nodes. In other cases, such information is partially
known through the topology construction procedure. In the
extreme case, we can obtain precise location information of
relay nodes when we install the nodes in a well-organized
manner. Therefore, various methods are needed to determine
the service area size according to the knowledge level of the
location information of neighboring relay nodes.
In [1], we proposed two methods, and compared their
communication performance in terms of the size of the
total service area, the size of the single-covered area, and
the maximum number of overlapped service areas through
preliminary simulation experiments. We assume that the
service area is a circle. These methods determine the radius
of this circle (hereinafter referred to as the service radius).
The ﬁrst method, referred to as the identical radius method,
is for the situations, in which there is no information about
other relay nodes. Therefore, all of the relay nodes use an
identical service radius. The second method, referred to as
the NND (Nearest Neighbor Distance) method, is used in
situations, in which some degree of topology information
can be obtained from the topology construction procedure.
Using this information, each node estimates the distance to
the nearest neighboring node and sets the service radius.
In this paper, we propose the third method. The third
method, referred to as the Voronoi method, is used in situ-
ations, in which we can obtain precise location information
of other neighboring relay nodes. In this method, each relay
node sets its service radius to the distance from the relay
node to the furthest point in its Voronoi area [5].
These three methods assume a different level of knowl-
edge. The goal for the future is to develop a method whose
performance is highly competitive with Voronoi method,
using limited information such as topology construction
information. For this purpose, in this paper, we conduct ex-
tensive simulation experiments to evaluate the performance
of three methods in terms of coverage ratio, service area
overlap characteristics, energy consumption, and the utiliza-
tion efﬁciency of wireless network resources. We conﬁrm
the trade-off relationships between the knowledge level and
the performance of the three methods. The simulation results
reveal that the method that uses more information performs
better in terms of all of the above metrics. In particular, the
Voronoi method has the best performance among the three
methods, whereas the location information cannot be easily
obtained. We also conﬁrm that the performance of the NND
method is signiﬁcantly improved by the inclusion of a small
amount of additional information, which is readily available.
The remainder of the present paper is organized as
follows. In Section II, we discuss research related to the
coverage problem. In Section III, we describe the model of
the relay networks and the topology construction method.
In Section IV, we introduce three methods to determine
the service area size. We present the simulation results in
Section V. Finally, in Section VI, we conclude the paper
and describe areas for future research.
II. RELATED WORK
As mentioned in Section I, a relay node must determine
its service radius so that overlapping areas becomes small
and the total service area becomes large. This problem can
be classiﬁed as a disc coverage problem, which has been
researched extensively with respect to sensor networks [6, 7],
relay networks [8], and image processing [9]. However, these
studies cannot be applied to the problem in the present paper
because the assumptions are quite different. For example,
in [6, 7], individual sensors cannot change their coverage
ranges. In [9], the authors discussed a method to choose a
set of discs from various size discs so that the total area is
covered by the smallest possible number of discs and the size
of discs is ﬁxed. In [8], the authors focused on the coverage
problem in relay networks and investigated the adequate
number of relay nodes for client terminals to establish a path
to the gateway nodes. They also investigated the process of
changing the coverage ratio, which is the ratio of the number
of client terminals with an active link to the total number
of client terminals. However, the previous authors assumed
that they could install additional relay nodes so that the client
terminals could establish a path to the gateway node.
III. IEEE 802.16J RELAY NETWORK
In this section, we describe the network model and the
radio interference model used in the present paper. We also
introduce the topology construction method.
A. Network model
Figure 2 shows the network model used in the present
paper. In the network model G, we assume that a set of
relay nodes V
= {v(0), v(1), ..., v(N−1)} and a set of
client terminals W = {w(0), w(1), ..., w(Q−1)} are randomly
located in the ﬁeld and that the relay node at the center of
the ﬁeld is the gateway node (v(0)).
The relay nodes and client terminals construct a tree
topology based on the topology construction procedure
described in Subsection III-C. In topology construction,
each relay node v(i) sets its transmission power in a non-
stepwise manner. Let d(i) denote the transmission distance
of each relay node. Here, M (i) represents the number of
physical links of node v(i) that connect to neighboring relay
nodes. Note that a physical link is deﬁned as a link that
is established between two relay nodes located within each
other’s transmission distance, and an active link is deﬁned
as a physical link that constructs a tree topology and is used
to transmit data to the gateway node.
We consider two types of wireless communications: wire-
less communications among relay nodes and wireless com-
munications between relay nodes and client terminals. These
two types of communications do not interfere with each

other because they use different wireless channels [10]. We
assume that the service area of relay node v(i) is a circle
S(i), the radius of which is r(i), and the service radius can
be chosen in a non-stepwise manner. We also assume that
client terminals always set a constant transmission distance
regardless of the distance to the connecting relay node. After
the topology construction introduced in Subsection III-C,
each relay node determines its service area size in order to
provide wireless Internet access service for client terminals.
Each client terminal connects to the nearest relay node
having a service radius area that covers the client terminal.
B. Directed interference model
We next introduce the radio interference model [11]
used in the present paper, as is depicted in Figure 3. We
deﬁne a directed communication graph I = (X, E), where
X = V ∪ W and E is the set of directed communication
links lv(i),w(p) that deﬁnes an edge directed from relay node
v(i) to client terminal w(p). Note that the communication
links between relay nodes are not included in E. The
model deﬁnes the interference relationship between two
directed transmission links lv(i),w(p) and lv(j),w(q) based
on the distance among four vertices v(i), v(j), w(p), and
w(q). In the communication between relay nodes and client
terminals, we assume that v(i) and w(p) have interference
ranges given by circles of radii are u(i)
v
and u(p)
w , re-
spectively. In IEEE 802.16j, upward links and downward
links become active in different sub-frames. Therefore, we
have to consider the following two types of interferences.
For upward interference, lv(j),w(q) interferes with lv(i),w(p)

w . For downward
interference, lv(i),w(p) interferes with lv(j),w(q) when and
only when ||v(i) − w(q)|| < u(i)
v . Here, ||v(i) − w(q)|| is
the distance between v(i) and w(q). Typically, u(i) > d(i),
and the ratio of the interference range to the communication
range for node v(i), denoted as γ(i) =
u(i)
d(i) , takes ranges
from 2 to 4 in practice [11]. When the two links interfere,
they are not used at the same time slot in the IEEE 802.16
frame.
C. Topology construction procedure
IEEE 802.16j does not deﬁne the details of the method
used to construct the network topology [12]. The topology
construction procedure we introduce here is targeted at
situations, in which relay nodes are deployed randomly. The
typical situation includes network construction at a disaster
site, where it is difﬁcult to deploy relay nodes in a well-
organized manner. We also assume that relay nodes are
deployed to the network incrementally. In the following, we
explain in detail the algorithm for a newly joining relay node
to connect to an existing network topology.
A newly joining relay node, denoted as v(i), waits for
replies from other existing relay nodes while increasing its
radio transmission power [3]. When a found relay node
does not have a path to a gateway node, v(i) establishes a
physical link to the relay node and continues increasing its
transmission power. When the found relay node has a path to
the gateway node, v(i) establishes an active link to the relay
node and stops increasing its transmission power. When v(i)
cannot ﬁnd any relay nodes even when the transmission
power reaches the maximum, v(i) maintains the maximum
transmission power to detect the joining relay nodes which
is successfully linked to the gateway node. If the relay node
ﬁnds multiple relay nodes that have a path to the gateway
node at the same time, the relay node sets an active link
to the relay node that has the smallest hop count to the
gateway node. When multiple relay nodes have an identical

hop count to the gateway node, v(i) chooses the relay node
that is nearest v(i). When a relay node v(j) that does not
have an active link ﬁnds a path to the gateway node as a
result of the entry of v(i), v(i) and v(j) set active links as
the shortest path to the gateway node.
Note that this topology construction procedure may gen-
erate isolated relay nodes, which do not connect any other
relay nodes and which cannot provide a service area, de-
pending on its transmission distance, deployment order of
relay nodes, and location. The simulation experiments shown
in Section V include such a case.
IV. METHODS TO DETERMINE THE SERVICE AREA SIZE
A. Identical radius method
As the simplest method, we ﬁrst discuss the identical
radius method. This method is used in situations, in which
there is no information about other relay nodes. In this
method, all relay nodes use an identical service radius. This
method determines the service radius as the minimum value
so that the coverage ratio becomes 100%.
Each relay node determines its service radius r(i) accord-
ing to the following equation, where ridt is obtained by
algorithm 1:
r(i) = ridt.
(1)
Figure 4 shows an example of coverage with the identical
radius method.
B. Nearest neighbor distance method
Nearest neighbor distance (NND) method is used in
situations, in which some degree of topology information
can be obtained by the topology construction. The NND
method estimates the nearest neighbor distance, which is the
distance to the nearest neighboring relay node, based on the
node density, using this information. This estimation result
is used to determine the service radius.

1) Estimation of the nearest neighbor distance: Figure 5
shows the situation, in which relay node v has M (= ﬁve)
neighboring nodes in its transmission distance, which means
that relay node v has M physical links. Since we assume
the random location of all relay nodes, M neighboring relay
nodes are randomly located in the circle for which the center
is located at node v and the radius is d. We then derive the
nearest neighbor distance using parameters M and d.
First, we consider a lemma for the estimation.
Lemma IV-B.1. When the node density is constant and

there are M relay nodes in a circle Cα of radius α, the
average distance R between these nodes and the center node
becomes:
R = 2α
3 .
Proof: Let P(t|0≤t≤α) be the node density function on
the circumference of a circle of radius t in Cα. Since nodes
are randomly located, P(t) is proportional to t. Therefore,
with invariable c, P(t) becomes as follows:
P(t) = c · t.
(2)
Here, since the number of relay nodes in Cα is M, we have
∫ α
0
P(t)dt = M.
(3)
Using Eq. (2) and (3), c satisﬁes
c = 2M
α2 .
(4)
Substituting Eq. (4) into Eq. (2), we obtain the following:
P(t) = 2M
α2 t.
(5)
Therefore, R becomes as follows:
R

(6)
Using lemma IV-B.1, we have the following theorem.
Theorem IV-B.1. If the number of PHY links M and the
transmission distance d of a relay node are known, the
average distance to the nearest neighbor node R1 becomes
as follows:
R1 =

Proof: Considering that the fraction between 1 and the
number of relay nodes in the circle Cd is equal to the fraction
between the area of CR1 and Cd, we have

π(R1)2 .
(7)
Thus, R1 satisﬁes
R1 = d

Using lemma IV-B.1, the average distance to the nearest
neighbor node R1 becomes as follows:

1 × 1 ﬁeld according to the joining process described in
Subsection III-C. We then obtain the estimated and actual
values of the nearest neighbor distance for all relay nodes.
The simulation was conducted 100 times for different node
locations. Figure 6 show the relation between the actual and
estimated values of the nearest neighbor distance. The two
straight lines represent the least-squares approximation and
the y = x relationship between the actual and estimated
values. When the relay node estimates its nearest neighbor
distance precisely, the dots in the graph should be plotted
on the y
= x line. However, as shown in Figure 6,
this algorithm has a large estimation error. Moreover, this
algorithm overestimates the nearest neighbor distance when
it is less than 0.05 and underestimates the nearest neighbor
distance when it is larger than 0.05 on average. This error
stems from the topology construction procedure. As men-
tioned in Subsection III-C, a relay node stops increasing its
transmission power when the node ﬁnds a neighboring node
that has a path to the gateway node. This means that, in most
cases, some neighboring nodes exist on the circumference
of a circle. On the other hand, this algorithm assumes that
the neighboring nodes exist randomly in the circle.
3) Algorithm for complete coverage of the ﬁeld using the
NND method: In the NND method, each relay node sets its
service radius based on the estimation result of the nearest
neighbor distance (Eq. 9), where d and M can be obtained
through the topology construction procedure. Speciﬁcally,
each relay node determines its service radius r(i) according
to the following equation:
r(i) = R(i)
1 × knnd,
(10)
where R(i)
1
is the nearest neighbor distance of node v(i)
deﬁned in Eq. 9 and knnd is the parameter for determining
the overall degree of the service radius (referred to in

C. Voronoi method
As mentioned in Subsection III-C, we assume that each
client terminal connects to the nearest neighboring node.
This means that each relay node accepts connections from
the client terminals in its Voronoi area [5]. Based on this

observation, in the Voronoi method, each relay node set its
service radius to cover its Voronoi area. Figure 8 shows
an image of the coverage obtained by using the Voronoi
method. We assume in this method that we can obtain
precise location information of all neighboring relay nodes
and calculate the Voronoi area. The Voronoi method sets
the service distance to the farthest point in the Voronoi area
(referred to in Figure 8 as the maximum Voronoi distance).
Note that this method can provide 100% of the coverage
ratio because the coverage ratio is based on the Voronoi
area. Figure 9 shows an example of coverage obtained by
using the Voronoi method.
V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
We show the evaluation results for the three methods pro-
posed in Section IV by conducting simulation experiments.
A. Simulation settings and performance metric
In the simulation, a gateway node is located at the center
of a 1 × 1 ﬁeld, and 99 or 49 relay nodes and 500 client
terminals are randomly located. As described in Subsection
III-C, the relay nodes construct the network topology based
on their location and transmission distance and determine
the service area size using each method. Each client ter-
minal connects to the nearest neighboring relay node. The
maximum transmission distance of relay nodes and client
terminals to construct network topology for communication
between relay nodes is set to 0.3, and γ is set to 2. Each plot
in the following graphs is the average of 1, 000 simulation
experiments.

Gateway node
Active link
Relay node
Service area
Figure 9: Example of coverage by the Voronoi method
We evaluate the performances of the three methods from
following three viewpoints:
• Overlapping service area: We deﬁne the overlap num-
ber of a certain point in the ﬁeld as the number of relay
nodes having a service area that includes the point.
We then look at the size distribution of the area in the
ﬁeld summarized by the overlap number. We also use
the maximum overlap number, which is deﬁned as the
maximum value of the overlap number in the ﬁeld.
• Energy consumption: We deﬁne the energy consump-
tion E(i) of the relay node v(i) as follows [13, 14]:
E(i) = r(i)2.
(11)
Then, we calculate the energy consumption of the entire
relay network as the sum of the energy consumptions
of the relay nodes in the network.
• Wireless resource efﬁciency: In TDMA-based wireless
multi-hop relay networks, in order to prevent radio
interference, different time slots are assigned to the
links that interfere with each other. The frame length
is deﬁned as the sum of the number of time slots
that are assigned to all of the network links. When
the frame length becomes smaller, we can say that we
achieve better efﬁciency of wireless network resources.
Therefore, we adopt the frame length as the metric
for wireless resource efﬁciency. Note that we evaluate
the frame length for downlink transmissions since the
methods in Section IV affects the performance of
downlink communication between gateway nodes and
relay nodes. By sharing time slots among multiple
wireless links that do not interfere with each other,
the frame length can be reduced. Note that the method
to determine the frame length is beyond the scope
of the present paper. However, in the following, we
brieﬂy explain the algorithm presented in [11] used to
determine the frame length.
The problem of ﬁnding the time slot assignment to
the minimize frame length is known as the NP-hard
problem [15]. A heuristic algorithm to obtain the
interference-free time slot assignment with a small
frame length, based on the greedy algorithm is pre-
sented in [11], where this resource allocation problem
was considered as a point coloring problem and the
number of colors was considered as the frame length.
This algorithm is divided into the following two major
steps.
Step 1Determine the order of links for the coloring
based on a conﬂict graph
Step 2Color each link using the greedy algorithm by
the order determined in Step 1
See [11] for the detailed algorithm. In general, the
frame length becomes smaller when the degree of radio
interference in the relay network is small. Therefore,
the frame length is one possible metric for evaluating
service area deployment algorithms.
Note that we do not evaluate the coverage ratio because
we set the service radius to the minimum value so that the
coverage ratio reaches 100%.
B. Overlapping service area
Figures 10(a) and 10(b) show the area size distributions
for each overlap number when we use 50 and 100 relay
nodes, respectively. In this ﬁgure, the area size with an
overlap number of 1 represents the single-covered area size,
and k of the overlap number indicates that the area is covered
by the service areas from k relay nodes. We summarize
the area size where the overlap number is larger than 15
at the rightmost bins in the graph. Based on these ﬁgures,
we observe that when we compare the NND method and
identical radius method, the NND method slightly outper-
forms the identical radius method because the NND method
has smaller values of the overlap number than the identical
radius method. On the other hand, the results obtained by
using the Voronoi method are much better, where roughly
80% of the ﬁeld has an overlap number of less than ﬁve. This
indicates the effectiveness of the Voronoi method. Figure

that, as the number of deployed relay nodes increases, the
maximum overlap number also increases when we apply the

hand, when we apply the Voronoi method, the maximum
overlap number is not affected by the number of relay nodes.
C. Energy consumption
Figure 12 shows the CDFs of the energy consumption of
1,000 simulation experiments for networks with 50 and 100
relay nodes, respectively. Figure 12 resembles Figure 11,
which means that the service area coverage efﬁciency largely
affects the energy consumption efﬁciency. In addition, for
the Voronoi method, there is a little difference between the
results obtained for 50 relay nodes and the results obtained
for 100 relay nodes. This indicates the effectiveness of the
Voronoi method, which requires precise location information
of all of the relay nodes in the network.

D. Wireless resource efﬁciency
Figure 13 shows the CDF of the frame length of 1, 000
simulation experiments. We can observe that the frame
length of the Voronoi method becomes 54% in the case of
50 relay nodes and 59% in the case of 100 relay nodes,
as compared to the identical radius method. For the NND
method, the frame length in the case of 50 relay nodes
is 82% and that in the case of 100 relay nodes is 119%,
respectively, as compared to the identical radius method.
This means that, in the NND method, the frame length is
affected by the node density. However, as shown in Figure
13, the variance of the identical radius method is larger
than that of the other methods. This is because the identical
radius method cannot accommodate the biased node density.

Therefore, it is necessary to set a large service radius in
order to obtain a coverage ratio of 100%, which causes a
large degree of radio interference and a large frame length.
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In the present paper, we introduced three methods to
determine the service area size for IEEE 802.16j relay
nodes, referred to as the identical radius method, the NND
method, and the Voronoi method, each of which assumes a
different level of knowledge regarding neighboring nodes.
The identical radius method is the simplest method, in
which all relay nodes use an identical service radius. The
NND method is used for situations, in which some degree
of topology information of the relay network can be ob-
tained. In this method, each relay node estimates the nearest

estimation results. The Voronoi method is used in situations,
in which we can obtain precise location information of other
neighboring relay nodes. In this method, each relay node
sets its service radius to cover its Voronoi area. Through
performance evaluation in terms of service area overlap char-
acteristics, energy consumption, and utilization efﬁciency
of wireless network resources, we conﬁrmed the trade-off
relationships between the knowledge level and performances
of the three methods considered herein. Speciﬁcally, the
Voronoi method performs signiﬁcantly better than the other
methods.
In future studies, we intend to develop a method in
which each relay node can obtain the shape of its Voronoi
area using less information, whose performance is highly

to evaluate the effect of the service area size on connec-
tion establishment procedure based on the contention-based
request mechanism.
