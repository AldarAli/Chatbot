Abstract—During the recent years, demand for healthcare 
services has dramatically increased. As the demand for 
healthcare services increases, so does the necessity of 
constructing new healthcare buildings and redesigning and 
renovating existing ones. Increasing demands necessitate the 
use of optimization techniques to improve the overall service 
efficiency in healthcare settings. However, high complexity of 
care processes remains the major challenge to accomplish this 
goal. This study proposes a method based on process mining 
results to address the high complexity of care processes and to 
find the optimal layout of the various medical centers in an 
emergency department. ProM framework is used to discover 
clinical pathway patterns and relationship between activities. 
Sequence clustering plug-in is used to remove infrequent 
events and to derive the process model in the form of Markov 
chain. The process mining results served as an input for the 
next phase which consists of the development of the 
optimization model. Comparison of the current ED design with 
the one obtained from the proposed method indicated that a 
carefully designed layout can significantly decrease the 
distances that patients must travel.

 INTRODUCTION 
Efficiency improvement is increasingly recognized as a 
serious concern for health organizations all around the world. 
Particularly, in developed countries, there has been a 
remarkable improvement in life quality factors during the 
last decades. This fact, in addition to development of new 
treatments, increased average longevity and hence dramatic 
demands for healthcare services have been observed.  
As the demand for healthcare services increases, so do 
the need for new healthcare buildings as well as the need for 
redesign and renovating existing ones. Several studies have 
reported an unprecedented healthcare building boom and 
proven the importance of creating optimal physical 
environments to achieve the best possible outcomes for 
patients, families, and staff [1][2]. Over the last decades, 
many healthcare managers have referred to the industrial 
sector and applied techniques and principles that have been 
developed 
in 
industrial 
processes 
to 
improve 
the 
performance of healthcare processes. However, high 
complexity of healthcare processes makes it challenging to 
apply these techniques in healthcare environments. Over the 
years, attention has gradually expanded from resource 
allocation and strategic planning to include operational 
issues such as resource scheduling and treatment planning 
[3]. In particular, Discrete Event Simulation (DES) based 
approach has been extensively used by researchers to address 
problems generally faced by hospital`s managers. In 
addition, analytical approaches like queuing based models 
played a vital role in this area. Facility layout design, in 
particular, has received considerable critical attention. 
Studies showed that an efficient layout design can result in a 
remarkable reduction in the total costs of manufacturing and 
service industries. Difficulties arise, however, when an 
attempt is made to apply these approaches to real-world 
healthcare systems. This is mainly a consequence of high 
complexity of healthcare systems. As argued by Rebuge et 
al. [4], healthcare domain is considered to have complex 
models due to four characteristics: i) health care processes 
are highly dynamic, ii) health care processes are highly 
complex, iii) health care processes are increasingly multi-
disciplinary, and iv) health care processes are ad hoc. 
Process mining techniques provide an opportunity to 
discover what is actually happening in the system. It aims at 
extracting process knowledge from event logs which may 
originate from all kind of systems like hospital information 
systems [5]. Taking benefits of wide range of available event 
logs in hospitals, these data can be used for improving the 
efficiency of care processes. In recent years, there has been 
an increasing growth on the number of papers addressing the 
applications of process mining in different disciplines and 
particularly, in healthcare domain. In a study by Mans et al. 
[5], the gynecological oncology healthcare process within a 
university hospital has been analyzed. They analyzed the 
healthcare process from three different perspectives: (1) the 
control flow perspective, (2) the organizational perspective 
and (3) the performance perspective. Relevant event logs 
extracted from the hospital's information system and 
analyzed using the ProM framework. Rebuge et al. [4] 
proposed a methodology for the application of process 
mining techniques that leads to the identification of regular 
behavior, process variants, and exceptional medical cases. 
The approach is demonstrated in a case study conducted at a 
hospital emergency service. Based on process mining 
outcomes, Zhou et al. [6] proposed a discrete event 
simulation model to analyze the clinical center. Sensitivity 
analyses have also been carried out to investigate the care 
activities with limited resources such as doctors and nurses. 
Analyzing and evaluating seven different process mining 
algorithms was done in [7]. Poelmans et al. [8] argued that 
neither process nor data discovery techniques alone are

sufficient for discovering knowledge gaps in particular 
domains such as healthcare. They showed that the 
combination of both gives significant synergistic results. 
In light of high complexity of healthcare systems, we 
believe success requires a complete understanding of actual 
processes. Indeed, practical experiences showed a significant 
gap between what is prescribed to happen, and what actually 
happens. The only requirement for applying process mining 
techniques is availability of event log. Nowadays, clinical 
data are stored as a hospital information system. A hospital 
cannot operate without an information system and hence, a 
very detailed information about the executed activities is 
readily available. In addition, user-friendly environments of 
process mining software tools, such as ProM (open-source 
tool for process mining algorithms) and DISCO (Fluxicon 
process mining software), enable analysts and designers to 
provide new insights that facilitate the improvement of 
existing care processes without a complete understanding of 
the algorithms and techniques involved. 
The aim of this study is to propose a method to help 
healthcare organizations to analyze complex hospital 
processes and find the optimal patient-centered layout based 
on real characteristics of the system in order to increase the 
efficiency of the care services. In order to do so, process 
mining techniques were applied to extract process related 
information, namely process model and pathway patterns, 
from event log of an ED in Seoul, South Korea. Based on the 
results obtained from process mining, number, age and 
acuity level of patients traveling between each two medical 
functions have been obtained. An architectural layout 
optimization model is then proposed in order to minimize 
patients traveling distance and length of stay by sensing 
sequence of activities. Up to now, far too little attention has 
been paid to facility layout optimization of hospitals. 
Moreover, existing studies have been mostly based on 
subjective judgments of patients` movement and relationship 
of medical functions. It is worth pointing out that the main 
advantage of a process mining-based method, however, is 
that the outcomes are based on real executions of processes 
rather than relying on subjective observations or opinions. 
Given the enormous cost of designing and constructing 
hospital buildings in addition to the significant impact of 
their layout on productivity and efficiency of hospitals, we 
believe the design process of hospital buildings is a 
challenging managerial problem which requires integration 
of architectural and operational management views. 
The remaining part of the paper proceeds as follows: 
Section 2 describes the process mining-based method to 
discover the clinical patterns form the clinical records. As the 
main objective of this study, outcomes from process mining 
were used in a layout optimization problem in Section 3. 
Finally, Section 4 concludes the paper. 
II. 
PATIENT MOVEMENT ANALYSIS 
The study uses a process log that consists of the care 
processes of 11357 patients of the ED of S Hospital in 
Seoul, South Korea. Treatment activities were collected 
during a period of 61 days. There are totally 9 activities that 
a patient might go through during his/her visit to the ED. 
Table 1 shows the details about the activities. Since patients 
correspond to cases in the log, 11357 cases, and 52250 
events have been observed. We used the ProM framework 
to perform the study [9]. ProM has been developed to 
support various process mining algorithms. Sequence 
clustering plug-in has been implemented to support the 
clustering goal. It allows to cluster patients in dataset and 
further apply other desire process mining techniques to each 
cluster [10]. However, in this study, sequence clustering 
plug-in is used for two reasons. First, it allows the user to 
apply preprocessing steps to clean the data set and to 
remove infrequent events. Second, the process model can be 
obtained in the form of Markov chain, which allows the user 
to understand the relations between activities.

 During our investigations, we realized that those patient 
pattern behaviors, which occurred less than ten times, can be 
considered as infrequent sequences and can be eliminated 
from the dataset. After setting the minimum occurrence of a 
sequence to 10, information about 424 patients (less than 4 
percent) deleted from the dataset (from 11357 instances, 
10933 were kept). The resulting data set, consist of 10933 
patients with 57 different activity patterns. Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 
illustrate sequences and events present in the filtered event 
log receptively.

In order to obtain the Markov chain for complete log 
without dividing it into clusters, the number of desired 
clusters must be selected equal to one. Fig. 3 represents the 
discovered process model in the form of Markov chain 
(darker elements are more recurrent than lighter ones). 
III. 
LAYOUT OPTIMIZATION MODEL 
In this section, a mathematical optimization problem has 
been proposed to find the best layout of ED. Using the 
activity relations between medical centers inside the ED 
obtained by process mining techniques, the model attempts 
to maximize goodness of the functional interactions of the 
center with other centers. 
A. Mathematical model and notations 
Let l be the numbers of available locations, and n denotes 
the number of required medical centers. The problem is to 
locate n distinct centers N={1,2,3,… ,n} in l distinct 
available locations L={1,2,3,…l}. Where l is at least equal 
to the number of required centers n. It must be mentioned 
that the two cases “l=n” and “l>n” essentially are equivalent 
since l-n dummy centers can be added.  For clarity, we shall 
use indices q and r for available locations, and i and j for 
required centers. We denote by δqr` the inversed normalized 
distance between positions q and r (closer locations have 
higher weight). For center i, the feasible (potential) set of 
locations is denoted by Pi. The position of center i is 
described by the binary variables xiq's such that the value of 
xiq is 1 if center i is moved to position q and 0 otherwise. 
Finally, rij represents the movement relation between centers 
i and j. The movement relationship between different 
centers of ED plays a vital role in the optimization process. 
The outcomes of the process mining are used in this model 
as inputs of optimization model. Basically, to medical 
functions with high logical relationship (i.e., large rij) must 
be located close to each other in order to decrease the 
patients’ moving distances. Having obtained the Markov 
chain for process model, it is also possible to provide a 
matrix representation which makes it more tractable for 
further analysis (Fig. 4).

The objective of the model is to maximize goodness of 
the functional interactions of the center with other centers.

Constraint (1) claims that centers must be assigned to one 
of its potential positions. Constraint (2) claims that available 
position can hold at most one center.   
B. Results and discussion  
Fig. 5 represents the current arrangement of medical 
centers inside the ED. The problem is to relocate required 
medical centers to available locations in order to decrease 
the total distance traveled by patients and hence decrease the 
length of stay. Our model was implemented in OPL and 
solved by CPLEX 12. The optimum layout obtained by 
proposed model (Fig. 6) showed 37.95 percentage of 
improvement in comparison with current layout regarding 
total walking distance of patients (changed from 256203 to 
158999). The needed CPU time is about 1 min. However, 
designing hospital units do not happen very often in 
practice. Therefore, it is acceptable to spend some hours of 
computational effort. 
Having obtained the optimal layout using the proposed 
method, simulation modeling can be used to assist decision 
makers to adjust the obtained layout with respect to various 
considerations. The reasons may include adjusting the 
layout for qualitative objectives such safety and security. 
Other reasons may include some quantitative goals which 
are difficult to express using mathematical formulation. It

must be pointed out that the layout obtained from the 
proposed model is the best layout possible considering 
distances traveled by patients and should be applied in the 
early design stage to determine the most efficient layout. 
The obtained layout may be tuned further according to any 
aspects that are not included in the formulation presented 
here.

CONCLUSIONS 
In this study, a process mining-based method proposed to 
discover process model and clinical pathway patterns of an 
ED. Process mining can be used as a reliable tool to enhance 
care process analysis and to discover the pathway patterns 
from the clinical records. The process model is then used to 
find the best layout of medical functions in ED. The 
objective was to decide upon the location of the various 
clinical centers so as to reduce the effort spent by the 
patients while moving from one unit to another. It was 
found that a carefully designed layout could significantly 
decrease the distances that patients must travel, as well as 
related complications. The most important limitation of this 
study lies in the fact that there are many factors, such as 
patient and personnel’s safety and security that must be 
taken into account when designing a hospital building. 
Future studies need to be carried out in order to determine 
the best layout of hospital buildings by considering multiple 
layout planning objectives simultaneously.
