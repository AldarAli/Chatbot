Abstract — Recently, the application of lean thinking in 
healthcare has grown significantly in response to rising 
demand, caused by population growth, ageing and high 
expectations 
of 
service 
quality. 
However, 
insufficient 
justifications and lack of quantifiable evidence are the main 
obstacles to convince healthcare executives to adopt lean 
philosophies. This paper presents a real application of the 
successful implementation of a methodology that integrates 
Value Stream Mapping (VSM) and simulation modelling to 
improve an emergency department (ED) of a University 
hospital in Dublin. Appling lean approach in operations will 
minimize the patient waiting time and improve service time. 
VSM points out to the value-added and non-value-added 
activities in a clear schematic way. Simulation Model is also 
developed for the department in order to account for the 
variability and complexity resulted in healthcare processes due 
to dynamism and sharing resources. A comparative analysis of 
current and future state of the ED is provided and presented to 
managers to illustrate the potential benefits of adopting lean 
practices.  
Keywords: Lean; Modeling and Simulation; Healthcare; 
Capacity Planning.

INTRODUCTION 
Health systems are complex [1]. Although a significant 
fraction of many governments’ budgets is allocated to health, 
results have hardly matched expectations as many health 
system 
performance 
indicators 
have 
shown 
limited 
improvement. Long waiting lists, overcrowding, and 
patient’s dissatisfaction are the main symptoms of the 
healthcare system in Ireland with over 46,400 adults and 
children waiting for hospital treatment, according to the 
latest figures from the Health Service Executive (HSE) in 
Ireland [2]. Healthcare managers are challenged by intrinsic 
uncertainty of the demands and outcomes of healthcare 
systems [3]; high public demand for increased quality [4]; 
high level of human involvement at both patients level and 
resource level (doctor, nurses, etc.); limited budget and 
resources; and large number of variables (e.g., staff 
scheduling, number of beds, etc.). As a result, service 
providers and healthcare managers are continuously studying 
the efficiency of existing healthcare systems and exploring 
improvement opportunities. 
Traditionally, critical decisions are made based on the 
vast arrays of data contained in clinical and administrative 
records. This approach cannot succeed in representing the 
dynamic interaction between the interconnected components 
of the healthcare system. Consequently, this approach has 
limited use when it comes to predicting the outcomes of 
changes or proposed actions to the system.  Analytical tools 
are needed to support managers’ decisions at different levels 
within the healthcare system. If analytical models are 
impractical in the healthcare settings, it is usually due to the 
imposed simplifications on the model. Accordingly, 
important details and features of the underlined systems 
cannot be captured. Lean thinking and simulation modeling 
offer 
two 
distinct 
frameworks 
which 
healthcare 
organizations can adapt to address their challenges.  
In the rest of the paper, Section 2 reviews related work. 
Section 3 introduces the case study and the application of 
lean and simulation, followed by experimentation and 
analysis in Section 4, while Section 5 concludes the paper.

LITERATURE REVIEW  
With the healthcare organizations aim to improve the 
patient experience and system’s effectiveness and efficiency, 
they were confronted with increasing costs, demand on 
services and expectations in service quality. Corresponding 
to these challenges, decision makers were forced to think of 
new flexible ways to reduce waste, improve process control 
and improve utilization of resources. Lean is one of the most 
valuable techniques that can be used to achieve these 
ambitions [5]. Lean is a concept related to philosophies 
derived from Toyota production system to create more value 
with less. The lean process evaluates operations step by step 
to identify waste and inefficiency and then creates solutions 
to improve operations and reduce cost [6]. The lean process 
represent an unending cycle toward perfection, in which the 
services in continually refined and improved [7]. The 
existing number of publications proves the importance of 
lean in healthcare [8]. Lean has been utilized effectively in 
healthcare to reduce waiting times and improve system 
performance by eliminating the wasteful activities from the 
existing processes [9], [10] in many departments across the 
hospital setting including the emergency [11], [12] and 
surgery departments [13]. Despite the efficiency of 
implementing lean philosophy, reports reflected on few 
drawbacks especially related to the interpretations of 
changes.   
Reviewing the portfolio of techniques and tools that 
assist in implementing lean, three groups can be 
distinguished. While some of these tools such as process 
mapping are used to review the performance of the 
organization in terms of waste and process, improvement

tools are focusing on redesigning and developing the existing 
processes. Finally, monitoring tools, such as visual 
management, are used to examine the existing and the 
developing processes [14]. Furthermore, while some of these 
tools are focusing on the entire organization as the unit of 
analysis, others such as Value Stream Mapping (VSM) are 
more focused on a product value stream. A value stream is a 
mapping tool that is used to identify Value-Added activities 
(VA) from Non-Value added (NVA) activities, the NVA 
activities increase throughput time and develop an undue 
service time [15]. In recent years, VSM has emerged as the 
preferred assist to implement lean [16] and in particularly 
with complex dynamic systems such as emergency 
department [17]. VSM is considered a valuable tool in 
helping health care managers to recognize waste and its 
sources. The content of VSM does not only include 
information about the materials flow but also about the flow 
time based performance [18]. VSM can be formulated in 
three steps; the first step is to formulate the current state 
value map to give a snapshot of the current processes. To 
achieve this, managers illustrate every step in service and 
document facts such as cycle time, buffer sizes, and personal 
requirements [19]. The second step consists in the 
identification and analysis of the waste encountered along 
the value stream. Finally, a parallel map is developed to 
describe the ideal future state without the removed waste 
[20] Critique to VSM approach is due to the fact that it is a 
static tool and sometimes unable to illustrate the dynamic 
behavior between system components. For managers, this 
might affect their judgments to recognize whether the best 
future state as regards to the desired level of system 
performance is achieved or not [21]. At the moment, there is 
a need to wait for few months to monitor the impact of the 
changes on the system key performance indicators. 
Consequently, a complementary tool with VSM is required 
to handle uncertainty and model the dynamics between 
system components for different future state maps [22]. 
Using simulation modeling in the assessment process of lean 
implementation would explore the various opportunities of 
process improvement and the impact of the proposed 
changes before implementation [23]. The future state has to 
be validated before implementation in order to minimize 
risks and reduce trial and error adjustments. Simulation can 
also be used to systemically identify the best alternatives of 
the future state. By using simulation, operation process data 
can be analyzed fully to examine the parameter’s variability 
and uncertainty in operation [24] and [25]. Simulation has 
been widely proven to be a flexible tool to model the 
uncertainty and complexity [26]. By testing design 
alternatives, simulation analysis will provide an effective 
way of examining solutions prior to their actual 
implementation and reducing the risk associated with lean 
process.  
III. 
SIMULATION-BASED VALUE STREAM MAPPING  
A. Hospital and ED Background  
In Ireland, with more than 1.2 millions attending the ED 
every year, the ED overcrowding has been declared a 
national emergency. The shortage of beds coupled with the 
high patient demand and shortage of staff has affected the 
ED capability to provide efficient and safe care to patients. 
Prolonged waiting times has been reported with more than 
40% of the patients waiting between 10-24 hours (HSE 
Performance Monitoring Report, 2010). Consequently, the 
hospitals are not compliant with the Health Service 
Executive (HSE) waiting time targets (6 hour patient 
experience time target). It was also reported by the task 
force in 2007 that the overall ED physical space and 
infrastructure is insufficient. Accordingly, analysing the 
patient flow in emergency departments to optimise the ED 
capacity in order to minimize the length of stay has become 
a crucial requirement. The hospital studied is a public, adult 
teaching hospital that holds 463 beds and handles almost 
220,000 patients annually. Its ED logs over 45000 patients a 
year. The ED has 4 resuscitation beds, 4 minor injury beds, 
9 major beds, 1 triage room, and 2 X-ray rooms. It has also 
a Clinical Decision Unit (CDU), which is designated for 
patients who are still under ED physicians and need further 
investigations. The uncertainty and complexity of the ED 
processes require a technique that can handle system 
variation and validate improvements steps before it can be 
implemented [27]. The proposed framework is used to 
identify VA and NVA activities and model the complexity 
of the ED to explore potential solutions to meet the national 
metrics. 
 
B. Data Collection and Analysis  
In order to acquire knowledge about the ED processes 
and build a VSM, extensive information was gathered. 
Direct observation to the service delivery operation was 
conducted to represent the interaction between the different 
service delivery processes and to deliver average processes 
times. Extensive interviews with ED doctors, nurses, 
administrators, nursing staff, and unit porters were conducted 
to gain precious insights into the ED operation processes in 
theory and practice. The vast amount of data collected was 
very valuable in determining the current ED service delivery 
processes and developing the VSM. ED service delivery 
process have the following sets of activities, some occur in 
sequential; some are omitted for different patient conditions.  
These activities are: patient arrival; triage process; initial ED 
doctor assessment; diagnostic tests; doctor follow up or 
treatment planning; admission or discharge. 
There are two main ways for patient’s arrival to EDs, 
ambulance or walk-in. Patients arriving via ambulance are 
always giving priority as they are considered as urgent and 
need to be triaged immediately. By using the Manchester 
triage system, patients are categorized into 5 groups and each 
group is given a color: Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, and 
Red. The red category signals a very sick patient that needs 
to be seen immediately and blue signals the non-urgent 
patient. For the purpose of this paper, the patient flow was 
given number from 1-15. The Patient arrives and is 
registered by a receptionist.  In the next step, the patient will 
be triaged by a senior nurse to determine the severity of their 
257

condition and the patient will be labeled by a triage category. 
If the patient is given the red or orange category, the patient 
will be moved to resuscitation or to major immediately. The 
triaged patients (yellow, green, and blue category) will wait 
in the designated area (waiting room) for an available bed. 
The patients will be seen according to their triage category. 
If the ED cubicles are full or the doctors are busy with life 
threatening case, the patients have to wait longer to be seen, 
resulting in overcrowding. Hence, the arrival of critically ill 
patients will be given priority to be seen ahead of other 
patients. The patients will be called by a nurse and allocated 
a cubicle waiting to be assessed by ED doctor. Depending on 
the initial ED doctor assessment, one or more diagnostic tests 
are recommended. Following the diagnostic tests, the patient 
will be reviewed by ED doctor to recommend admitting 
them to the hospital or discharged from ED or further 
investigation required. If the patient requires a medical or 
surgical assessment, the bleep system will be used to contact 
the designated team and a verbal handover will be given by 
ED doctor.   
If the surgical team is carrying out an operation in 
Theatre, the patient has to wait for few hours before an 
assessment will be carried out. If the patient needs further 
investigation under ED doctor care, the patient will be 
admitted to CDU. During the patient stay in CDU, the 
medical care is provided by ED health care staff. If the 
diagnostic test comeback as abnormal, the patient will be 
referred to the appropriate medical/surgical team and will be 
admitted to the hospital, otherwise the patient will be 
discharged. If a decision is taken to admit the patient, the 
hospital bed manager has to be notified to allocate a bed. 
During the wait time for ward bed, the ED nurses are 
responsible for the patient’s care.  
 
C. Development of the VSM 
Data for the current stat map was collected as 
recommended by Rother and Shock [28]. The data collection 
for the ED process started at patient leaving ED (admission 
or discharge), and worked backward all the way to the 
patient arrivals, gathering snapshots of data such as process 
cycle time, waiting time before each process, number of 
employees for each process and their qualification.  The 
VSM for ED is presented in Figure 1.

The large boxes in the map represent the process and 
steps needed to achieve it. Also, each process has a data box 
below, which contains the health care staff in each process, 
and the facility required. The timeline at the bottom has two 
elements. The first element of the timeline is the processing 
time (VA time). VA time is obtained by summing all the 
processing times in the value stream. The second component 
of timeline is the process waiting time (NVA). This time is 
calculated by adding the waiting time before each process.  
As represented in the VSM, the average waiting time to 
see a doctor is between 10 to 420 minutes depending on the 
patient’s condition and the availability of a bed in ED. 
Despite the process of doing blood investigation average 
time is between 10-15 minutes, waiting for the results to be 
ready for review is between 60-120 minutes. There are three 
possible paths for patients in ED after the ED doctor review 
the diagnostic test results and commence follow up or begin 
treatment of the patient. These paths are: 
 
1. 
The patient need further diagnostic tests but still 
under ED physician care. The average process time 
from patient arrival to ED to be ready to be 
discharged or admitted to the ward is between 103-
157 minutes compared to 182-2154 minutes average 
waiting time. 
 
2. 
Patient treatment is finished and is to be discharged. 
The average process time from arrival to ED to be 
discharged is 48-77 minutes while the waiting 
average time is between 102-654 minutes.  
 
3. 
Finally, if the patient required a medical/surgical 
consultation, the average process time is between 
58-97 minutes while the average waiting time is 
between157-934 minutes.  
 
To find the causes behind the long NVA time in the ED 
process, conducting a root cause analysis is essential. 
D. Root Cause Analysis 
Root cause analysis is an applied tool developed by 
Professor Ishikaua in 1943 [29] to analyze possible causes 
or problems while organizing the causal relationships.  A 
root cause analysis was conducted to explore the causes 
behind the long waiting time (NVA) in ED process. Figure 
2 represents a root cause analysis diagram. According to the 
diagram, six categories were found to be the main 
contributors in extending waiting time for patients in the ED 
journey. These categories were: 
 
1. 
Resources:  
a. The shortage of beds in ED and hospital resulting 
from the high patients demand has impacted 
negatively on ED performance. Admitted patients 
have to wait a long time in ED before transferring 
them to their wards is not  only blocking ED beds, 
but is also over utilized ED resources.  
b. 
Because of the lack of ED doctor’s access to 
outpatient clinic, chronic patients were found to 
occupy acute beds in ED.  
 
2. Information Technology (IT): 
There was no IT system found in order to inform ED 
staff members that blood results or X-ray are ready for 
collection. The waiting time for diagnostic results when 
they are ready to be reviewed is NVA time.  
 
3. Manpower: 
a. 
There was no dedicated nurse in minor injury. The 
nurse in minor injury was distracted to help in 
resuscitation if needed. This causes longer waiting 
time to patients attending minor injury area. 
b. 
When the nurses on duty were not skilled to take 
bloods, the ED doctors have to do it themselves.  
c. 
If the senior doctor was busy in resuscitation, there 
will be no decision maker available to discharge or 
admit patients. Junior doctors have to wait to 
discuss patient case with senior doctor to direct the 
patient treatment plan.  
 
4. Investigations: 
The limited access to diagnostic tests, such as CT scan at 
night and weekends, increases the patient’s length of 
stay in ED dramatically.    
 
5. Communication 
a. 
If a patient triaged and labeled with red or orange, 
triage nurse have to search for the nurse manager to 
allocate a bed immediately.  No communication 
system in place available between triage nurse and 
nurse manager.  
b. 
Medical/surgical teams were not available all the 
time to respond to consultation referral from ED.  
c. 
Laboratory technicians were not informed about 
sending blood samples to the lab.  
  
6. Process: 
a. 
Over processing in triage process. Because of the 
long waiting times to see a doctor, the tri-age nurse 
has to carry out a comprehensive over processing 
triage.  
b. 
Delay in transporting blood samples to the lab.

E. Simulation Model Development 
Based on the discussed patient flow, VSM, and root case 
analysis, a comprehensive simulation model was developed. 
As the work involves processes at the patient level, Discrete-
Event Simulation (DES) is suitable. The simulation model 
has been designed to reflect the interaction between entities 
in the ED real world. Starting from the early stage of the 
development process, it took into consideration the whole 
model into the hierarchy scheme to enable the modularity 
and extendibility. Mainly, the simulation model is divided 
into three basic stages; patient generation and arrival, patient 
treatment and patient discharge. Generation of the patient 
arrival pattern in the first stage depended on the distributions 
extracted from the real data of the ED. Patients arrival has 
two sources; patients come with the ambulance and patients 
come as walk in. There are two entry points to the ED zones 
one for the ambulance patients who has higher priority and 
the other one for the walk in patients. The treatment stage of 
the model contains the main zones and labs of the ED. This 
stage starts with the triage block, which decides the priority 
level of treating patient on scale from 1 to 5 with 1 
determining the highest priority. Patients move from triage to 
the zones or the waiting room according to the severity level. 
There are three zones for patient treatment, the first one 
zone1 is dedicated to the most severe cases such as 
unconscious or non-breathing patients, the second one is 
zone2 which receives patients with major injuries and the 
third one is zone3, which is dedicated to the minor injuries 
patients. Each zone provides a sequence of treatment and 
examining processes according to the severity level of the 
patient. 
The routers blocks in the simulation model control the 
pathway of the patient treatment process according to the 
statistics extracted from the ED real data. Different resources 
batches to the patient by joining the process. When the 
patient enters the zone, a trolley and cubicle resource is 
assigned to the patient. In the treatment process, a doctor or 
nurse assigned to the patient. It depends on the capacity and 
availability these resources. 
      The journey in each zones ends with the discharging 
stage, which distribute the patient to one of the discharge 
outcomes; Home, GP, Die, Transfer and Others. During the 
whole journey of the patient and at certain points, the 
average waiting time and patient experience time (PET) - 
length of stay - are accumulated for each patient to calculate 
the final average PET and waiting time for all patients. These 
measurements or KPIs are used later to examine the impact 
of the change of the simulation variables on the performance 
of the ED. 
     For the simulation model to be considered as 
representative of the processes within ED and to be able to 
use it for testing scenarios, validation and verification are 
needed. Using visual tracking, the simulation model was 
verified by examining every group of blocks to ensure that 
patients follow the correct care path. Also, the conceptual 
model was validated by the ED senior managers and senior 
staff. A face validation approach was performed with the ED 
senior managers to validate the generic simulation model.

Finally, the output of the simulation model was compared 
with actual ED processes time and the deviation average was 
not more than 5% from the actual values.  
IV. 
EXPERIMENTATION AND ANALYSIS 
Simulation model scenarios are in relation to the ED 
capacity in terms of number of major and minor cubicles 
required to better manage current and future demand for care. 
Besides ED capacity concerns, three other bottlenecks have 
been identified; time to admit patients from ED to hospital 
wards, ED staffing level, and time for specialty team to see a 
patient. A summary of the simulation variables and their 
agreed range of values is given in Table I.

The main Key Performance Indicator used in the 
simulation model is the percentage of patients with patient 
experience time (i.e., length of stay) less than 6 hours. Due to 
the large number of combinations of variables, a total of 45 
scenarios have been selected 
Regarding the staffing level, the value ‘c’ refers to the 
current staffing level where the value ‘i’ represents an infinite 
supply of staff. Although not realistic, the objective of the 
assumption of infinite supply of staff is to switch on and off 
the staffing bottleneck and to focus on the determining the 
ED size regardless of the actual staff needed as requested by 
the ED stakeholders. Each scenario was tested by the 
simulation model for 12 months for 15 runs.  
As shown in Table II, percentage of patients staying the 
ED less than 6 hours does not improve with only increasing 
the ED size.  
 
TABLE II SIMULATION RESULTS OF INCREASING CAPACITY 
 
Along with current staffing level, decreasing the waiting 
time for patients who need to be admitted to hospital wards is 
crucial for improving PET. Additionally, decreasing the time 
for specialty teams to check patients in the ED is important 
for decreasing overall PET (Table III).  
With resolving these two bottlenecks, namely ED toward 
time and specialty team time, the effect of increasing the ED 
size on PET is constrained by the current staffing level. 
Assuming an infinite supply of staff, it was found that the ED 
needs to increase its major cubicles by at least 122% of its 
current capacity (from 9 to 20) and minor cubicles by 33% 
with no need to increase Resus cubicles.

help not only to improve the quality of service but it also 
eliminates non-value added activities. This approach can be 
applied to support healthcare managers to reduce costs and 
improve healthcare organization performance. To exploit the 
improvement opportunities, VSM was used to identify the 
non-value added activities in a structured diagram that 
presents system parameters (i.e. materials flow and the cycle 
time). This enables the management team to discover system 
bottlenecks and impact of changes on performance.  
Application of Simulation modelling was also utilised in the 
case study to demonstrate the dynamism of the key system 
resources. Results show that the integration between VSM 
and Simulation Modelling was effective in modelling 
capacity 
planning 
activities 
within 
the 
Emergency 
Department of one of the leading hospitals in Dublin. The 
framework has a potential to be used as a template of 
planning emergency departments in Ireland.
