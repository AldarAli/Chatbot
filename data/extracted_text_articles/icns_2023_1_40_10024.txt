Abstract—The 
advanced 
fifth 
generation 
mobile 
communication system (5G system) around 2025 is expected to 
introduce new technologies, such as virtualized Radio Access 
Network (vRAN) that can place base station functions on 
general servers, and base station function placement based on 
vRAN to fit the quality requirements of communication services. 
In order to evaluate the quality of end-to-end communication in 
mobile communication system, a System Level Simulator (SLS) 
is widely used. However, more simulation time for SLS with the 
advanced 5G system is required than with the 5G system. 
Because new technologies are added in SLS and it executed long-
term and large-scale simulations are required. A reduction of 
simulation time for SLS is required for an effective evaluation. 
In this paper, we propose a software design of SLS for the 
advanced 5G system with RU-basis parallel processing by 
multiple computation nodes. Through the SLS executed on the 
supercomputer Fugaku, we confirmed that our proposed 
method can reduce SLS processing time.

INTRODUCTION 
The fifth generation mobile communication system (5G 
system) has already become widespread in many countries. 
Around 2025, the 5G system will further advanced as the 
“advanced 5G system” accompanied by the introduction of 
new technologies. In order to introduce new technologies, it is 
necessary to evaluate the end-to-end communication quality 
of the entire advanced 5G system with the technologies due to 
clear how affect use-level packet. For example, the new 
technologies are wireless communication systems, such as 
massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) [1], grant-
free non-orthogonal multiple access for Internet of Things 
(IoT) [2], and virtualized Radio Access Network (vRAN). To 
evaluate the end-to-end communication quality with these 
technologies in a mobile communication system, a System 
Level Simulator (SLS) on computers is widely used.  
The existing SLSs for the 5G system [3][4][5] can 
simulate the User Equipment (UE) layout and movement, 
Radio Unit (RU) layout, generation of application traffic, and 
the wireless communication technologies of the 5G system. 
For evaluations of the advanced 5G system, additional 
technologies will be simulated, such as a new wireless 
communication system and vRAN. In addition, the 
management methods for vRAN to maintain communication 
quality are also evaluated by SLS, such as base station 
function placement based on computation resources and 
transport resources [6], and radio resource assignment for 
each virtualized base station function [7]. The vRAN controls 
by the management methods are judged by the frequently 
changed status such as the status of the radio links between 
each of the RUs and UEs, and UE traffic generation. In 
addition, for example, base station function placement in 
vRAN is controlled by aggregating RAN-wide information, 
such as time-varying radio quality information and the 
generated traffic in each UE. Therefore, when base station 
function placement changes, the communication quality of 
user-level packets is affected by the placed base station 
function. Because of this interaction, the RAN portion and the 
radio portion must be simulated simultaneously. Although 
abstracted simulations are proposed [5], since it is not yet clear 
how the new technologies in the advanced 5G system will 
affect user-level packets, detailed simulations of individual 
technologies should be performed for the initial stage 
evaluation. 
Figure 1 shows the simulation configuration of the 
advanced 5G system. There are approximately 1,000 RUs and 
50,000 UEs inside approximately one square kilometer. The 
RUs create many areas of cells with various frequency bands. 
UEs (e.g., cars, IoT terminals, and smartphones) move in the 
areas. In addition, to judge the usefulness of the management 
methods, it is required an SLS simulation time of around 10 
minutes to 1 hour period. The simulation will become large-
scale about the number of RUs and UEs, and long-term about 
simulation time.

affects effective evaluations by the SLS because many 
simulations will be executed to evaluate new wireless 
communication technologies and management methods. 
Therefore, we need to reduce the simulation time for the SLS. 
One method of reducing the simulation time of the SLS is a 
parallel processing method by one computation node with 
multi-cores [8]. However, since total computation power is 
limited, one computation node cannot effectively improve the 
simulation time. To obtain more computation power, there is 
a parallel processing method using multiple computation 
nodes with multi-cores [9]. To apply the SLS to this 
environment, the simulation result of each radio frame 
transmission (e.g., 1 msec) needs to be shared between the 
computation nodes because the next radio frame transmission 
is simulated based on previous radio frame transmissions. 
Since such data sharing and collecting between computation 
nodes is over a network, a “memory access time” is required. 
As shown in Figure 2, applying multiple computation nodes 
has pros and cons in that it can reduce SLS processing time in 
each computation node, but the memory access time between 
the computation nodes is increased. In order to reduce the total 
simulation time of the SLS, it is important to have balanced 
software design between the memory access time and the 
reduction of the SLS processing time. 
 
 
Figure 2.  Pros and cons of data sharing in multiple computation nodes. 
In this paper, in order to reduce the simulation time, we 
propose a software design of SLS for the advanced 5G system 
(A5G-SLS) with multiple computation nodes. The A5G-SLS 
introduces the RU-basis for parallel processing to reduce 
processing time. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed 
method, we use different types of parallel processing models, 
such as ALL MPIs and hybrid models, on the supercomputer 
Fugaku [10]. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section II presents the simulation targets and the problem of 
processing time reduction in the A5G-SLS. Section III 
proposes a software design for the A5G-SLS with parallel 
processing by multiple computation nodes. We present the 
evaluation of the proposed method in Section IV. Finally, we 
provide our conclusion in Section V.

SYSTEM LEVEL SIMULATOR FOR ADVANCED 5G 
SYSTEM AND PARALLEL PROCESSING PROBLEM 
A. Overview of advanced 5G RAN 
In the advanced 5G system, the functions of the base 
stations are divided into a Central Unit (CU), a Distributed 
Unit (DU) and an RU. In the vRAN environment, the CU and 
DU are virtualized as the vCU and vDU, and they work on 
commodity servers. The servers are placed at various 
locations in the RAN, i.e., an antenna site, a local office, and 
a central office. An optical fiber connects the local office and 
the antenna site as a physical link in the physical configuration 
as shown in Figure 3 (a). The application server is located in 
the central office (or local office), and various types of service 
traffic are generated, such as high-definition video streaming, 
connected vehicles, drone control, and the IoT. 
The logical networks are constructed by the vCUs and 
vDUs, they are works on the commodity servers and the RUs 
in an area shown in Figure 3 (b). In order to maintain 
communication quality, a RAN slice is created for each 
service [6]. For example, one RAN slice is created for high-
capacity traffic, and another RAN slice is created for low-
latency, and massive connections in the area. The vRAN 
management method controls base station function placement 
based on computer resources and transport resources, and 
radio resource assignment based on the radio link quality 
between each of the RUs and UEs, and UEs traffic generation. 
For example, in Figure 3 (b), one RAN slice is reallocated 
from high-capacity traffic to massive connections, and the 
assignment of radio resource is controlled. To obtain user 
packet level results for throughput, delays, and errors in end-
to-end communications, both the RAN and radio links are 
simulated at the same time. In addition, radio resource 
assignment is performed in relatively short-term control (100 
msec to 1 sec), and base station function placement is 
performed in long-term control (10 minutes to 1 hour). On the 
other hand, the radio resource scheduling in the vDU for the 
radio link is performed in ultra-short control (approximately 1 
msec).

B. A5G-SLS Implementation and Points for Simulation 
Targets 
The A5G-SLS consists of three parts; initialization, 
preprocessing, and main simulation.  As the initialization part, 
the physical and logical configurations, such as base stations 
(vCUs, vDUs, RUs), UEs, slices, and traffic servers, are set in 
the initial files as parameters. In addition, the services and 
simulation time are set in the same files. The traffic of each

service for each UE and the propagation are created using the 
initial files in the preprocessing part. The main simulation 
conducts the simulation process, such as propagation at a 
transport link, the radio packet process includes radio resource 
scheduling at the vDU, and the radio link process includes 
error and retransmission in the radio links and the UE. The 
main simulation part conducts the processing for each time 
step until the simulation time is finished. We created the A5G-
SLS for advanced 5G systems based on the SLS for 5G 
systems used in the evaluation of previous research [11]. 
From the above configuration, the A5G-SLS can simulate 
the following. A large number of RUs and UEs are placed, the 
RUs with various frequency bands, and UEs, which move in 
the area, are simulated. The propagations are simulated using 
a radio propagation model in 1 msec order, and the radio 
frames are sent/received using propagation data that include 
error and retransmission. In addition, the networks and 
transport links in a RAN are simulated, and the data packets 
are transferred through them. The data packets are transferred 
as radio signals or user data depending on changes in the base 
station functions. Furthermore, the UE can generate various 
services data, such as high-definition video streaming and 
connected vehicles. From these simulations, it is possible to 
clear how the generated traffic is affected by radio frames and 
transmission paths as communication, and the end-to-end 
communication quality can be simulated. 
The simulation targets of the A5G-SLS are to evaluate the 
quality of end-to-end communication for each user in the 
large-scale environment of the advanced 5G system. There are 
two points for simulating the targets; 
Point 1 is new technologies. One of the new technologies 
is the new wireless communication systems, such as MIMO. 
The other is vRAN and its management method, such as base 
station function placement and radio resource assignment. As 
described in section II A, the vRAN controls are judged by 
frequently changed statuses (e.g., radio links and UE traffic 
generation). In addition, the communication quality of user-
level packets is affected by the changing placement of the base 
stations. Because of this interaction, the RAN portion and the 
radio portion must be simulated simultaneously. 
Point 2 is large-scale simulation. One large-scale 
simulation is the environment. As described in Section I, there 
are approximately 1,000 RUs and 50,000 UEs in 
approximately one square kilometer. The RUs create many 
areas with various frequency bands, such as small-cell, nano-
cell, and macro-cell. UEs are assumed to be the cars, IoT 
terminals, and smartphones, and they move in the areas. The 
other large-scale simulation is long-term simulation. To judge 
the usefulness of management methods, it is required a 
simulation time of SLS around 10 minutes to 1 hour period. 
The above two points require that the simulations with 
both new technologies and long-term/large-scale simulation 
take a long time (e.g., a few days to a week) to execute on the 
SLS for the advanced 5G system. In addition, considering the 
new technologies, since the quantitative effects on user-level 
packets and end-to-end communication quality in the 
advanced 5G system are not yet clear, detailed simulations of 
how to work the radio frame transmission and user-level 
packets should be performed in 1 msec order. One reason is 
that a detailed simulation of the radio environment, such as 
each radio link between RUs and UE, is needed to evaluate 
new wireless communication systems. Since the effectiveness 
of new wireless communication system for user-level 
communication, such as communication quality, is unknown, 
the wireless communication system needs to evaluate the 
radio environment in detail on the order of milliseconds. The 
other reason is the evaluation of vRAN management methods 
and user-level communication quality based on the status of 
user traffic, usage of radio/transport/computation resources in 
RAN, and the status of radio links between the RUs and UEs. 
To evaluate the management methods and the communication 
quality, all items such as vRAN, user traffic generation, and 
radio links are required to simulate at the same time. In 
addition, long-term simulation is required because the 
management method controls vRAN per 1 or 10 minutes. 
 
C. Related SLS (Existing System Level Simulators) 
As the SLS for the 5G system, some simulation tools and 
open platforms are proposed in [3][4][12][13], and [14]. 
OMNet++ [3], NS-3 [4], and Veins [12] exist as popular 
event-based network simulators. In these simulators, most of 
the protocol stacks are modeled. However, in order to address 
computational complexity, it is difficult to simulate large-
scale networks. 5G K-SimSys [13] has been developed to 
provide an open platform for evaluating SLS performance of 
the 5G standard. It is designed to be flexible, open, and has a 
modular form to make it easy to customize. To evaluate 
performance, a more complex testbed is required. 
OpenAirInterface [14] is implemented in part of the 3GPP 
LTE and provides an interface between the hardware platform 
and works as an emulator. When the complexity increases, it 
is difficult to conduct a large-scale simulation due to the 
number of nodes, which is limited. 
The approaches of reducing the simulation time for the 
SLS have been conducted [15][16][8], and [5]. 5G-Lena [15], 
which is NS-3 based, introduces a method of reducing 
simulation time by abstracting the physical layer. D. S. Buse 
et al. [16] introduced an approach in which some part of the 
SLS process of the wireless signal attenuation model 
computation is asynchronously pushed to the background and 
offloaded. This approach is implemented in the Veins of 
VANET simulator. However, when the simulation scale 
becomes large and complex, the simulation takes a long time 
to compute due to the single-thread simulation run. Therefore, 
it has the limitation of reducing the simulation time for the 
SLS. As other approaches, Vienna5G [8] has been proposed. 
This simulator is based on MATLAB, and it can perform in a 
large-scale, multi-tier network with numerous types of 
network nodes. This approach uses multiple threads on a 
computation node. However, it is insufficient to reduce 
simulation time by only multi-threads processing in one 
computation node to increasing amount of calculation. 
Simu5G [5] is provided as an open-source simulator with an 
emulator function based on OMNeT++. In order to provide 
real-time emulation, it is introduced lightweight models of 
UEs and gNBs with abstracted limited functionalities for 
creating resource contention and interference.

Comparing the existing 5G SLS and the A5G-SLS, the 
existing 5G SLS in [16] presents the simulation result using a 
scenario, such as 30 RUs, 7,000 UEs, and 100 msec of 
simulation time. On the other hand, in the A5G-SLS, the 
simulation is performed using a scenario, such as 
approximately 1,000 RUs, 50,000 UEs, and one hour of 
simulation time. Hence, large-scale and long-term simulations 
are required. Moreover, in terms of the implementation of 
functions, the existing 5G SLS consists of the following 
functions: 1) services and the transmission paths process, 2) 
DU process, 3) RU process, and 5) other processes as shown 
in Table I. On the other hand, the A5G-SLS includes the 
function 4) the vRAN process in addition to the functions of 
the 5G SLS. These processes from 1) to 5) are performed 
repeatedly in the order of each time step (e.g., every 1 msec) 
until the end of the simulation. Namely, the A5G-SLS 
increases the simulation functions. Hence, to be adaptive of 
increasing calculation, it requires the parallel processing 
method using multiple computation nodes.

D. Problem with Parallel Processing 
To realize parallel processing using multiple computation 
nodes, there are the following problems. 
Problem-a) Transmission time of memory data: To use 
multiple computation nodes, in order to share the data between 
all processes, memory data are collected and shared between 
multiple computation nodes. In general, as shown in Figure 4, 
in existing scientific simulations, such as fluid dynamics [17] 
and weather forecasting [18], each process is an independent 
event, only the data used in each process is transferred, and 
the calculated result data is collected to approximately 320 
Kbytes [18]. On the other hand, in the A5G-SLS, the radio 
allocation data of all UEs and RUs are required for calculating 
SINR. Therefore, the A5G-SLS transfers all simulated data in 
memory to all processes (shared data), and transfers all RUs 
and UEs information where changes, such as SINR, have 
occurred (collected data) (e.g., when the number of RUs is 598 
and the number of UEs is 35 per RU, transmission data size, 
which includes shared data and collected data, is 
approximately 5 MBytes). Hence, the data transfer time 
becomes longer. 
 
Figure 4.  Transmission data size for conventional parallel processing and 
A5G-SLS. 
Problem-b) Process waiting time: Conventionally, the 
parallel processing method has the problem that it cannot 
proceed to the next process until all processes are finished 
because of the synchronization of all processes and the sharing 
of all simulation results between the computation nodes. In 
other words, the processes should wait until all processes 
reach this barrier of synchronization as shown in Figure 5. In 
the A5G-SLS, the simulation result of each radio frame 
transmission needs to be shared between computation nodes. 
However, increasing the waiting time increases the processing 
time for the simulation. In order to solve this problem, the 
A5G-SLS is required to reduce the waiting time. For this 
reason, it is necessary to design all parallel processes to have 
similar processing times as much as possible. 
 
 
Figure 5.  Process waiting time. 
Problem-c) Dividing basis for parallel processing: As 
the dividing basis, two types exist: RU unit (hereinafter “RU-
basis”) and the UE unit (hereinafter “UE-basis”) as shown in 
Figure 6. The UE-basis processing needs to transfer the radio 
resource assignment with the channel status information (CSI) 
data of other UEs from the RU to all UEs for every time step. 
Therefore, the transference data size and times are increased. 
On the other hand, the RU-basis does not need to transfer the 
radio resource assignment with CSI data from the RU to all 
UEs because the RU already has them. Hence, if the dividing 
unit is inadequate, it takes a long processing time due to 
Problem-a) and Problem-b).

III. 
PROPOSAL FOR A5G-SLS DESIGN METHOD 
In this section, we explain the parallel processing method 
for reducing simulation time by using multiple computation 
nodes to resolve Problem-a), Problem-b) and Problem-c) as 
described in the previous section. 
For the design of the parallel processing target, the 
processing with a high computation load in the A5G-SLS is 
selected due to the effect of the processing time reduction. We 
analyzed the program execution time in the A5G-SLS from 
the following two viewpoints; the availability of parallel 
processing, and the process of the high computation load 
within A5G-SLS. As a result, the computation load imposed 
by the radio communication quality measurement (calculation 
of the Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR)) in RU 
processing is high (approximately 30% of the total) so this 
part is parallelized in multiple processing. 
In addition, as a selection basis method for parallel 
processing, the UE-basis and RU-basis exist as shown in 
Figure 6. In order to calculate the SINR, the radio resource 
assignment data with the CSI of all UEs are required. In the 
case of the UE-basis, the RU transfers the radio resource 
assignment data with the CSI to all UEs at every time step in 
order to calculate the SINR at each UE. On the other hand, in 
the case of the RU-basis, it is not necessary to transfer the 
radio resource assignment data with the channel status 
information from each UE because the RU already has the 
data. By using these selection methods, the transmission 
volume is reduced, and the transmission time is reduced 
(Problem-a can be resolved). In addition, since there are no 
major differences in the process load of each RU, the 
processing waiting time may be reduced. Hence, we propose 
a method of reducing simulation time using the RU-basis 
(Problem-b and Problem-c can be resolved).  
 
 
(a) Non-parallel processing     (b) Parallel processing of RU-basis 
Figure 7.  Sequence of parallel processing for A5G-SLS. 
Figure 7 shows the specific processing sequence for the 
A5G-SLS. Non-parallel processing is shown in Figure 7 (a), 
and the parallel sequence of the RU-basis is shown in Figure 
7 (b). We explain the sequence using the simulation scenario 
when the number of RUs is denoted as R. In the case of non-
parallel processing, the SINR is calculated sequentially from 
RU#1 to RU#R in the measurement process of the radio 
communication quality in RU processing. On the other hand, 
in the proposed parallel processing method for the RU-basis, 
SINR calculation processing is divided into the R of each RU, 
then the R processes are conducted in parallel. Since 
introducing parallel processing, data transfer between the 
main process and each RU process is necessary due to sharing 
and collecting the data; when each process starts, the Physical 
Resource Blocks (PRBs) of data M1 [Byte], which are 
allocated to all UEs by all RUs, are transferred from the main 
process to each RU process, and when each RU process ends, 
the SINR data of each UE M2 [Byte] are transferred from each 
RU process to the main process. Hence, the total transmission 
memory data sizes from and to the main process of PRB and 
SINR are 𝑀1 × 𝑅 [Byte], 𝑀2 × 𝑅  [Byte], respectively. 
 
IV. 
EVALUATION 
In this section, we verify our proposed method for the 
A5G-SLS to reduce the processing time on the RU-basis using 
parallel processing by multiple computation nodes. 
A. Evaluation Viewpoints 
We evaluate our proposed method from two viewpoints. 
Viewpoint 1 is the reduction in processing time. The 
processing time is compared with some parallel models and a 
non-parallel model (the details are provided in Section IV.B.) 
varying the number of RUs and UEs.  
Viewpoint 2 is the effect of Problem-a) and Problem-b). 
For Problem-a), it shows the balance between the memory 
access time and processing time. For Problem-b), it shows the 
relationship between the process waiting time and the increase 
in the number of RUs. From this relationship, we explain that 
the waiting time is reduced, and the calculation time is 
improved as a result. 
 
B. Evaluation Method 
As mentioned in subsection A, in order to evaluate the 
proposed method, four types of evaluation models, including 
three types of parallel model (Model-2, Model-3 and Model-
4) and one non-parallel model (Model-1), which is used for 
comparing with the parallel processing models, are defined 
(shown in Figure 8). In the parallel models, considering the 
different configurations of execution types, such as process 
and/or thread, and interface types of transference memory data, 
such as Message Processing Interface (MPI) [19] and/or Open 
Multi-Processing (OpenMP) [20], we set the following 
models:

one computation node, as “non-parallel processing 
model”.

• Model-2) ALL-MPI : All processes in the multiple 
computation nodes are connected to the management 
process in node #1 by MPI. Data M2 are transferred 
separately to the main process when the SINR

Figure 9.  Example of RUs and UEs allocation in the scenario. 
The evaluation scenario is that multiple RUs exist and a 
huge number of UEs are moving in many directions in a nano-
area in the scenario (see Figure 9). We measure the processing 
time and waiting time when the number of RUs R varies from 
46 to 1,012, and the number of UEs U varies from 690 to 
55,660. We set the simulation time to 60 [min]. The other 
simulation parameters are shown in Table II. To obtain 
evaluation values, the A5G-SLS executes five times on 
Fugaku as shown in Table III.

computation node (Model-2), and i = 3 is between the 
management process and the sub-management process among 
two computation nodes (Model-2, Model-3 and Model-4), 
respectively. Wi is the number of transfer times per time step 
of i. Vi is the communication speed of point i [bps], each 
communication speed is V1 and uses 8,192 [Gbps] referred 
from[17], V2 and V3 use the measurement values 159.6 [Gbps], 
and 50.1 [Gbps], respectively. Furthermore, T is the number 
of time steps, M is the transmission memory data size per RU 
[Byte] calculated by M = M1 + M2. From our simulation, M, 
M1, and M2 are the following values in Figure 10. M1 is the 
fixed size for every simulation step because it is calculated by 
the number of RUs and UEs. M2 is a different size for each 
simulation step, however, M2 size is in proportion to the 
number of RUs and EUs. The maximum transmission 
memory data size of M is approximately 13.9 [MBytes] per 
RU, when R is 1,012 and U is 55.

C. Simulation Results 
1) 
Improvement of Processing Time 
First, we verify that our proposed method improves the 
processing time compared to ALL Threads (Model-1). Figure 
11 shows the processing time varying R with a comparison 
between the parallel processing using multiple computation 
nodes and the non-parallel model using one computation node. 
The graph is normalized to the maximum processing time. 
From Figure 11, the parallel processing model can reduce the 
processing time more than the non-parallel processing model. 
Although the parallel processing model and the non-parallel 
processing model are almost same when R is small, the 
difference in the processing time is larger when R increases.  
Specifically, in the case of R=1021 and U=35 and 15, the 
processing time of Model-2 can be reduced by 1.8% and 
12.5% compared to Model-1, respectively. The greatest 
reduction at U=35 is 11.3% when R=522. In addition, the 
processing time of Model-3 and Model-4 is reduced compared 
to Model-1. When U=15, it is obtained the greatest reduction, 
Model-3 and Model-4 reduce the processing time by 16.16% 
and 17.51%, respectively. Furthermore, Model-4 achieves 
more reduction compared to Model-3. 
However, in cases where U=55 per RU (total 45,540 UEs), 
when R exceeded 828, Model-2 has a longer processing time 
than Model-1. This reason is estimated that the data size is 
larger (over 10MBytes per RU process), and transmission 
time is increased. 
From this result, we confirm that the proposed method can 
reduce the processing time, unless in the case of Model-2 and 
the transmission data size becomes extremely large (e.g., over 
10 MB per RU). 
  
 
Figure 11.  Improvement of SLS processing time. 
 
2) 
Effectiveness of Parallel Processing 
a) Memory Data Sharing 
Next, the effect of processing time reduction and the 
balance between the memory access time and the processing 
time is confirmed. The upper graph in Figure 12 shows the 
reduction ratio of the processing time compared to Model-1, 
and Figure 12 below shows the memory access time. Both 
graphs vary R in which U=15 and 55, respectively. The 
reduction ratio is defined as the ratio of the difference between 
Model-1 and each model at each R. In the case of U=15, the 
reductions of processing time are obtained from Model-1. The 
maximum reduction ratio of the processing time is for Model-
2, Model-3, and Model-4 when R=1,012, and they are 0.13, 
0.16 and 0.18, respectively. On the other hand, in the case of 
U=55, the reduction ratio is improved compared to Model-1, 
and the ratio is less than when U=15. The maximum reduction 
ratio of the processing time is for Model-2, Model-3, and 
Model-4 when R=598, and they are 0.05, 0.09 and 0.10, 
respectively. However, these ratios are reduced after R=598, 
R exceeds 874 in Model-2, and the reduction ratio is less then 
Model-1.  
The memory access time when U=15 and 55 is increased 
as R is increased, especially when U=55, and it is increased 
rapidly. When R=1,012 and U=55, the memory access time 
takes 3.3 times longer than when U=15. Hence, the reduction 
ratio is decreased due to the memory access time being 
increased. From this result, it can be seen that it is important 
to balance the processing time and memory access time.  
 
b) Process Waiting Time 
We evaluate the process waiting time of each model. 
Figure 13 shows the variance in waiting time varying R in the 
four models. The variance of waiting time for Model-2, 
Model-3, and Model-4 is smaller than that for Model-1. 
However, the variances of these models are almost constant 
despite the increase in the number of RUs when RU is less 
than or equal to 460. This result indicates that because the RU-
basis divided method keeps the waiting time constant, the 
processing time can be improved. From another viewpoint,

Model-2 of R exceeds 460, and the variance of the waiting 
time is increased. We assume the reason for this is that the 
transmission data size when R is over 460 is large, such as 
6MBytes, and the communication speed of Model-2 is slower 
than the other models. 
From Figure 12 and Figure 13, it confirms that when the 
waiting time is long, the reduction of the processing time 
cannot be increased.  
These results indicate that the hybrid Model-4 (transfer 
immediately) is the best method due to the balance among the 
reduction in processing time, memory access time and 
waiting time.  
 
D. Discussion 
In the above evaluation, we have verified the reduction of 
the processing time of A5G-SLS using three parallel 
processing models, Model-2, Model-3 and Model-4. Next, we 
evaluate quantitatively the best parallel model to execute 
A5G-SLS. 
In order to conduct a quantitative evaluation, an 
evaluation score is introduced. The evaluation score E is 
calculated by (2) using three indications of processing time, 
memory access time and waiting time.  
 
𝐸 = 𝛼 + 𝛽 + 𝛾 
() 
where,  is the processing time,  is the memory access time 
and  is the waiting time, and all indications are normalized 
by the maximum value of each indication. Therefore, E is 
from 0.00 to 3.00 due to using the three indications. The 
smallest E indicates the best model. The evaluation score E is 
calculated for each model and each RU. 
Figure 14 shows the evaluation score E of each model 
varying the number of RUs R. From this graph, when R is 
small, all models obtain almost the same score for E, which is 
less than 1. However, when R is large, the score for E is 
increased. Specifically, when R=1,012 and U=55, the 
evaluation scores E of Model-2, Model-3 and Model-4 are 
3.00, 1.72 and 1.68, respectively. In comparing two hybrid 
models, E of Model-4 is 0.04 smaller than that of Model-3.  
From the above results, in order to reduce the processing 
time, especially for large-scale simulation, it is desirable to 
conduct the simulation using hybrid Model-4 (transfer 
immediately).

V. 
CONCLUSION 
Considering the advanced 5G system of approximately 
2025, in this paper to reduce the simulation time, we propose 
a software design of SLS for the A5G-SLS with multiple 
computation nodes. Specifically, in the A5G-SLS, since the 
computation load of the radio communication quality 
measurement is high, in which the SINR calculation in the 
RU processing, the processing is divided into the RU-basis, 
and parallel processing is performed by multiple computation 
nodes. From our simulation results, we confirm that our 
proposed parallel processing method can improve the 
processing time compared to non-parallel processing models. 
However, when the number of RUs is large, the reduction 
ratio of the ALL_MPI model is less than that of the non-
parallel processing model. In addition, as a result of the 
quantitative evaluation of four processing models, we verified 
that the hybrid Model-4 (Transfer immediately) is the best for 
large-scale simulations. 
As a future work, in order to further reduction of the 
processing time, we study the reduction method of the

Furthermore, as another approach, a method is needed to 
reduce the processing time by abstracting the process while 
not affecting evaluations of the new technologies. The A5G-
SLS is a closed software due to introducing our invention. 
Initially, it will be used for the evaluation of the advanced 5G 
technologies, and then we will publish our obtained research 
results.
