Abstract—Modeling and Simulation are well-established 
techniques used in science and technology for prediction, 
analysis, and evaluation of properties of various complex 
dynamic systems. The actual trend in the simulation 
technology is the integration of models into the production 
automation and control systems, which aims to ensure a higher 
level of control and a better quality of the decisions made. The 
model-aided support is of a substantial importance for 
security-critical systems, such as underground mine ventilation 
networks, in which the risk of a spontaneous explosion of 
hazardous gases (like methane) is very high and might cause an 
enormous damage to human and technical resources. We 
discuss a possible approach to perform simulation closely to 
the controlled objects by leveraging low-power, embedded 
hardware.

 INTRODUCTION 
The high complexity of dynamic processes and their 
analysis methods require high-performance hardware. In 
case of big systems, such as the targeted ventilation 
networks, the use of supercomputers is necessary. However, 
there are cases in which the simulation should be performed 
close to the controlled object (an element of the ventilation 
system). For example, this is required when an emergency 
situation has happened and the air distribution is being 
manually controlled by an underground rescue team, e.g. 
according to a special emergency response plan. In that 
case, the availability of a simulation platform that would be 
capable of predicting the development of the air- and gas-
dynamic situation based on the current conditions will be of 
a great advantage and will contribute to the quickest solving 
of the encountered problem. The goal of this research is to 
elaborate new concepts for the development of a portable 
simulation platform to be used in a productional 
technological environment. The platform should provide 
support to automated control systems for the case of 
unexpected events that cannot be handled by the native 
control systems due to their limited functionality, see Fig. 1. 
The modelling environment should be designed in a service-
oriented way in order to ensure interoperation with the high-
performance computing infrastructures whenever a better 
quality of results is needed.

ENVISIONED APPROACH 
The use of conventional hardware (Fig. 2a) in conditions 
of security-critical technological objects is often impossible 
due to factors like excessive dustiness, humidity, vibration, 
etc. The energy-efficiency requirements put another strict 
limitation on the hardware that is allowed to be used. The 
embedded hardware (Fig. 2b), on the contrary to 
conventional one, might meet those requirements of the use 
in the technological environment much better. However, the 
performance of the embedded systems is lower than of the 
conventional ones, which requires a trade-off between the 
required quality and performance of the simulation 
algorithms on one hand and the capabilities of the hardware 
platform on the other hand.

of the embedded hardware platforms (from high-bandwidth 
microprocessors to SoCs) that is capable of use in industrial 
conditions as well as their adherence to the RISC (Reduced 
Instruction Set Computing) CPU architectures prevents the 
portability of the simulation software to the “light-
weighted” hardware. 
Cloud computing – the IT organization strategy that was 
widely established in 2000’s – pushed the modeling and 
simulation 
community 
to 
reconsider 
their 
software 
development approaches towards their brighter service-
orientation. 
The 
technological 
foundation 
for 
the 
development of simulation software in a decentralised way 
has been established, which allows the software components 
to become interoperable on heterogeneous hardware 
platforms. Service-oriented development in the form of 
“microservices” (small interoperable components that 
implement a specific part of the modeling algorithm, see an 
example in Fig. 3) seems extremely promising for the next-
generation simulation platforms. This, however, requires 
new approaches to the organization of middleware 
frameworks for the development and execution of the 
service-oriented modeling software.

MAIN ACTIONS FOR FUTURE WORK 
The microservice-based approach allows a transition of 
the already known component-based simulation techniques 
(e.g. as proposed by Matlab and Simulink [4]) into a modern 
technological platform, leveraging the advances of the 
service-oriented Cloud technologies. The challenge of the 
low-power hardware support is to be tackled by the software 
compilation and execution technologies developed within 
PHANTOM [3] – an EU-funded project started in 
December 2015. 
Our goal is to elaborate a methodology for the 
development 
of 
portable, 
efficient, 
and 
scalable 
component-based simulation software based on a 
microservice architecture. The methodology will be 
implemented in a software platform for model-aided support 
of the security-critical technological processes.  
 
We are going to reimplement the available modeling 
algorithms with the framework we are proposing and 
evaluate the effects of porting to low-power embedded 
hardware in terms of performance and power consumption.
