Abstract—This paper reports on a study of a support system 
for Japanese extensive reading. The purpose of this system is to 
provide Japanese graded readers and an environment where 
learners can learn by themselves. The system contains video 
clips that replace teachers, boards that display other learners’ 
comments, and personal pages that display progress of the 
learners. From the results of a post-questionnaire and the logs 
of the system left by participants, the usefulness of the system 
is analyzed. 
Keywords-online library; Japanese graded readers; reading 
habits; digital books. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Considering that most learners of foreign languages are 
studying outside the countries where the target language is 
used, an online library of graded readers is useful for 
providing learning materials. Such an online library is 
beneficial for learners who learn abroad from the standpoints 
of time and cost. Especially, those learners without teachers 
will find it beneficial. However, currently, there is no system 
of Japanese extensive reading that is available to independent 
learners outside the classroom. Therefore, this study has 
designed and developed a support system for Japanese 
extensive reading, in which an online library is installed. In 
the eLmL2017, we reported the extensive reading support 
system for independent learners of Japanese [1].  
Extensive reading is part of an approach for teaching 
English to speakers of other languages to build vocabulary 
and develop reading comprehension [2] [3] [4] [5]. Extensive 
reading has not been a common approach in education 
programs because it is time consuming and qualitatively 
different compared with existing reading courses that are 
typically offered; however, through the development of a 
module that can hold students accountable for their reading 
[5], extensive reading outside the classroom has been made 
possible. The module is used for managing learners’ records. 
As a solution to the problem of teachers who cannot take 
time to have students read during the class, this study has 
developed a support system for them in order to be able to 
make enough time for their students to read study materials 
on the systems outside of the classroom. In addition to that, 
we have implemented blended type lessons of extensive 
reading [7] [8] [9]. Using the system, teachers can have 
learners read books on the system as homework and can use 
classroom time for post reading activities. Learners can read 
books on their devices at any time. 
However, considering that learners can choose when and 
how to learn, extensive reading can be thought of as 
autonomous learning [10]. Therefore, this study aims to 
include all learners not only those studying with teachers and 
has developed a support system for Japanese extensive 
reading based on the system that supported blended type 
lessons. On the system, video clips and a comment board 
were used, and in addition, the progress of all users was 
displayed anonymously to let the learners who studied 
independently feel the presence of other learners. The results 
of a post-questionnaire and the amount of reading done 
confirmed the usefulness of those facilities.  
Moreover, a reading community on Facebook was tested 
as a post-reading activity. However, it was suggested that 
membership in the ER FB group was an important indicator 
of participation in FB discussions. The effect of ER FB 
group membership on FB commenting and the effect of the 
comment board of the self-ER support system were almost 
the same in that they encouraged learners to read by making 
them aware of the presence of other learners. These results 
indicate that an ER FB group is not necessary, but that a 
comment board is useful in the self-ER support system. 
Therefore, the study concluded that the post-reading 
activities on Facebook were not essential [1]. Based on 
feedback from the questionnaire on the eLmL2017, we 
improved the system and it was released to the public in 
August 2017. In this current system, a “Personal Page” that 
shows users’ reading histories was added to motivate 
learners to continue reading, and the way of displaying the 
results of the “Questions and Questionnaire” was improved.  
As an evaluation of the current system, from the results 
of the post-questionnaire and the logs on the system left by 
users surveyed by the author, this paper discusses the 
following questions: 
(1) whether the personal page and the improvements 
were useful in encouraging learners to read, 
(2) whether the digital reading materials were useful 
for learners to read extensively, 
(3) whether the extensive reading support system is 
useful for independent learners on learning Japanese. 
In Section II, the design of this system and how it has 
evolved will be discussed. Then, in Section III, the 
methodology of this study will be explained. In Section IV,

the usefulness of this system based on the results of a post-
questionnaire and the logs on the system left by participants 
will be examined. In Section V, the study will be concluded. 
II. 
A SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR EXTENSIVE READING 
First, we will introduce the previous study. Then, we will 
explain the scheme of the current system indicating the 
points that were improved. Lastly, we will show the 
information that can be collected from the logs left by users. 
A. Outline of Previously Used System 
Fig. 1 shows a schematic of the support system for 
Japanese extensive reading, which has two purposes and 
functions. First, the system supports blended extensive 
reading lessons (blended-ER support system), which are 
designed for teachers who provide such lessons [7] [8] [9]. 
Second, it is a support system for learners who study by 
themselves (self-ER support system) [1]. This system was 
designed to facilitate learning outside the classroom, and 
provides an online library of Japanese graded readers 
(hereafter referred to as JGR) so that learners can learn 
autonomously. The function that the two systems have in 
common is called “ER Lab,” which is mainly composed of 
“Libraries” and “Questions and Questionnaire”. When users 
submit their replies to the “Questions and Questionnaire”, 
the system recognizes that the users have read the books and 
displays their scores of the “Questions” and their replies to 
the “Questionnaire” on the “Progress” page under their IDs. 
Moreover, the system calculates the amount read by the 
users and displays the top three users on the top of the 
“Progress” page. Also, their replies to the “Questionnaire” 
are aggregated and the average scores are calculated. Then, 
on the “Evaluation” page, these scores are displayed in the 
form of the choices available on the questionnaire on each 
title (for example, a score of 3.8/5 may be “This book is 
interesting”).

Figure 2.  Schematic of a Current Self-ER Support System. 
In the blended-ER support system, the teacher explains 
extensive reading, how to read graded readers, and how to 
use the ER Lab. The teacher can also provide post-reading 
activities, such as initiating discussions about the readings. A 
blended ER lesson using the blended-ER support system was 
implemented, and the availability of the system was 
confirmed [7]. 
In contrast, the self-ER support system was designed for 
learners to learn independently through the system, without 
teachers. In this system, video clips are used in place of the 
teacher’s explanation so that learners can receive the same 
information as students in the blended-ER support system. It 
is recognized that, despite limitations, Video-Based Learning 
represents an effective learning method that can replace 
teacher-led learning approaches [11]. Additionally, a 
comment board that allowed users to write their impressions 
of the books that they had read was added to the ER Lab to 
ensure that learners were aware of the presence of other 
learners. It was expected that knowing how much other 
learners had read would promote reading among learners 
visiting the comment board [12]. 
B. Current System 
     Fig. 2 shows a schematic of the current self-ER support 
system. Before login, users watch three video clips on the 
“Top” page of the system (see Fig. 3). Video clips are used 
to teach “what extensive reading is,” “how to read graded 
readers” and “how to use ER Lab”. The time required to 
watch each video clip is around 2 minutes.  
     The ER Lab is composed of the “Library” and a new page 
called the “Personal Page” for each user. The “Library” 
contains SAKURA, which is a small collection of JGRs 
divided into eight levels from A to H (beginner to upper 
intermediate levels) [13]. A vocabulary level test that judges 
the appropriate level of SAKURA for learners to start reading 
from is under development [14] [15].

     In the library, the cover of each title is lined up with the 
number of letters (Chinese characters and Japanese phonetic 
alphabet) starting from the easiest level (see Fig. 4). By 
clicking the cover of the book, an information page on each 
title will appear (see Fig. 5). On the right side of the cover, 
the author, the original book, and the number of letters are 
displayed. Below this information, the page provides 
recommendation stars (1-5), which represent how interesting 
other users felt the book to be. Also, a brief introduction 
written by the rewriter of the book that was displayed 
separately in the former system is included here. 
     Below this information, the download button is displayed. 
Users can choose from three types of digital book; “ePub”, 
“mobi”, or “html”. If users choose “html”, they can read the 
book on the page. After downloading the digital file, a 
“Questions and Questionnaire” button will appear so that 
users cannot see the questions before they read the story. 
 
 
Figure 7.  Comment Board 
 
     The “Questions and Questionnaire” page consists of 
“Questions” about the stories and a “Questionnaire” about 
their reading experience (see Fig. 6). In the “Questions” part, 
participants are required to answer five questions about the 
book they had read. Each question has four answer choices 
to 
gauge 
their 
reading 
comprehension. 
In 
the 
“Questionnaire” part, participants are required to complete a 
questionnaire. Therein, they evaluate the length, difficulty, 
contents of the story and illustrations, and are asked to report 
the frequency of dictionary usage using a five-point Likert 
scale. Besides these questions, users are asked how long they 
had spent reading and which device they had used to read. In 
the final part of the “Questionnaire”, there is a space where 
users can write their impressions about a given story if they 
choose to.  
Users may leave comments on each story. At the bottom 
of the information page on each title, these comments are 
displayed under their ID, not their name, together with the 
users’ responses to the questionnaire on length, difficulty, 
and interest (Fig. 7). To prevent users knowing the end of a 
story before reading it, they can only see other users’ 
comments after they have submitted their replies to the 
“Questions and Questionnaire”. 
     Fig. 8 shows the “Personal Page”. On the Personal page, 
users’ registration data (nickname, place of residence, first 
language, date of registration) is displayed at the top. Below

the registration data, both their rank among all users 
regarding the number of letters they had read, and also their 
average reading speed are displayed. It is because “to read 
quickly” is one of the important points of extensive reading 
[16]. Reading speed is calculated from their answers to the 
questionnaire and the number of letters in the book they had 
read. A list of the books they had read is displayed at the 
bottom. When users click the books displayed in their list of 
books read, their answers to the questions and the correct 
answers to the questions on each book will appear. Also, the 
replies to the “Questionnaire” are displayed on the “Personal 
Page”. 
As mentioned in chapter 1, in this study, the way of 
displaying the answers to the “Questions and Questionnaire” 
has been improved. The “Progress” page that shows the 
ranking of the amount that users have read has been 
eliminated. Instead, on the “Personal Page”, each user can 
see where he or she is ranked according to how much they 
have read. In the previous study [1], some participants were 
motivated to read more by seeing how much progress others 
had made.  However, some participants did not want to see 
how much other participants had read or how well they had 
answered the questions about the books. Therefore, in the 
current system, this data remains private. Moreover, their 
average reading speed, that is calculated from their answers 
to the questionnaire, is displayed simultaneously. It was 
considered that showing a user’s progress would motivate 
them to continue reading. 
C. Logs Left by Users 
The administrator can collect the records or logs left by 
users when they registered, which contain the following data: 
1) Registration data: Users’ nickname, first language, 
place of residence, and self-assessment of their Japanese 
level (beginner, intermediate, advanced) 
2) Date and time the file was downloaded and kind of 
the file (ePub, mobi, html) 
3) Date and time the answers were submitted 
4) Moreover, the administrator can collect the data 
below from users’ questions and questionnaires: 
a) Five questions about the books that they had read. 
Each question has four answer choices to gauge their 
reading comprehension 
b) Users’ evaluation, using five-point Likert scale, of 
the length (short 1 – long 5), difficulty (easy 1- difficult 5),

METHOD 
In this section, first, we will introduce the participants 
and then, explain the methodology of the study. Lastly, we 
will show the post-questionnaire. 
A. Participants 
Nineteen international students (8 male and 11 female) at 
a Japanese university participated in this study. Their ages 
ranged from 20 to 31 (average 22.7). Their home countries 
included China (8), Vietnam (5), Malaysia (2), Korea (2), 
Hong Kong (1), and Nepal (1). As for the first language of 
the participants, 11 participants spoke languages that use 
Chinese characters, while 8 spoke languages that do not. To 
ascertain participants’ Japanese abilities, the Simple 
Performance-Oriented Test (SPOT) and a vocabulary 
assessment were administered. SPOT was used to assess 
grammar [17]. A vocabulary part of a Japanese language 
proficiency test was used to assess vocabulary. The results of 
these tests are shown in Table I. In both columns, the upper 
group represents nine participants, the lower group, ten 
participants. The participants on the lower group had widely 
different scores. Although participants who do not use 
Chinese characters tend to get lower scores in vocabulary, 
six participants in the upper group of both in vocabulary and 
grammar (SPOT) were the same individuals. Therefore, in 
chapter 4, participants are divided into upper group (nine 
persons) and lower group (ten persons) by total scores of 
vocabulary and grammar. 
B. Procedure 
The procedures were as follows: 
1) After watching the video clips on the “Top” page and 
registering as users of the system, participants could log 
into the ER Lab using their user IDs and passwords. 
2) Participants read books from the library on their 
devices. They were recommended to start reading from the 
lower level of SAKURA. ER Lab was used for a week. 
3) Participants answered questions about the story that 
they had read, and completed a questionnaire to evaluate 
the book. They were then invited to write their comments 
about the story. 
4) Participants answered the post-questionnaire on the 
last day of reading.

IV. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
From the results of the post-questionnaire and the logs 
left by participants, here we will discuss the research 
questions. First, we will discuss the functions of the current 
self-ER support system. Next, we will discuss the usefulness 
of digital books. Lastly, we will discuss the usefulness of this 
system on learning Japanese. 
A. Usefulness of the Current Self-ER Support System 
From the results of questions (1) to (6) of the post-
questionnaire, we will discuss the usefulness of the functions 
of the current self-ER support system. 
1) Video Clips 
  All the responses to question (1) “Did you feel the video 
clips were useful?” were positive. Fourteen participants 
chose “I could understand the explanation without reading” 
and five participants chose “the video clips motivated me to 
read books because they were amusing”. To understand the 
explanation without reading is important for beginners. 
Since all users must watch video clips before they log into 
the ER Lab, reading on the ER Lab that the video clips are 
amusing will encourage them to read. 
2) Library 
  All the responses to question (2) “Did you feel the five 
questions about the books in the “Library” were useful?” 
were positive. Seventeen participants chose “I could check 
my understanding about books” and two participants chose 
“It became the motivation while reading”. 
  In the current system, the comment board was moved 
inside the library. To question (3) “Did you feel it was 
useful to display “Other users’ comments in the “Library”?”, 
seventeen 
participants 
responded 
positively. 
Ten 
participants chose “Knowing other users’ opinion motivated 
me to read more” and nine participants chose “Knowing 
other users’ opinion is interesting”. However, one 
participant commented “Although it is useful to look, it 
might bother someone who wants to read casually”. This 
participant did not notice that writing comments is optional. 
The reasons for the response “No” were “There was no 
comment” and “I did not notice it”. Making it easier to see 
the comments might be beneficial. 
3) Personal Page 
  To question (4) “Did you feel it was useful to display the 
“Ranking” on the “Personal Page”?”, seventeen participants 
responded positively. Twelve participants chose “Knowing 
my rank was enjoyable” and four participants chose 
“Knowing my rank motivated me to read more”. Two 
participants wrote “I could confirm the book I had read”. 
The reason for the response “No” was “I do not care,” 
which is not negative. 
  All the responses to question (5) “Did you feel it was 
useful to display your “Reading speed” on the “Personal 
Page”?” were positive. Fifteen participants chose “Knowing 
my speed of reading was fun” and five participants chose 
“Knowing my speed motivated me to read more”. 
  All the responses to question (6) “Did you feel “A List 
of the Books you had read” was useful?” were positive. 
Nine participants chose “I will not forget the books I had 
read”, eight participants chose “The list motivated me to 
read more”. Other reasons were “I could confirm the book I 
read”, “It would be convenient to find the book when I read 
the book again” and “It would be enjoyable”. 
  On the “Video Clips” and the “Library”, the above-
mentioned positive responses were given by participants the 
same as in the previous study [1]. On the “Personal page” 
that was newly added to the current system, there were also 
no negative responses. Knowing their progress motivated 
most of the participants to read more. It is considered that 
displaying the amount the user read and reading speed is 
useful to make learners be aware of the important points of 
extensive reading, that is, “read more” and “read quickly”. 
B. Usefulness of Digital Books for Extensive Reading 
From the results of questions (7) to (11) of the post-
questionnaire, we will discuss the usability of the digital 
books. 
Table II shows the device and the file format when 
participants read digital books. “Device” is the answer to

question (7). “File” is the results of the logs left by 
participants. “Preference” is the answer to question (8). 
Although all the participants had smartphones, fifteen 
participants used smartphones and four participants used PCs 
when they read digital books. For the files to read digital 
books, 
fifteen 
participants 
downloaded 
“html”, 
six 
participants downloaded “ePub” and no participants 
downloaded “mobi”. The reason is perhaps that in the video 
clip instruction, using “html” for reading digital books is 
recommended if the user had never used “ePub” or “mobi”. 
     To the question (8) “Do you prefer paper books or digital 
books and why?”, eight participants chose “digital”, seven 
participants chose “paper”, and four participants chose “I do 
not mind”. The reason for choosing digital was “it is 
convenient”. Other reasons were “Digital book is good for 
heavy books” and “Paper books do not have functions to 
display other users’ comments or reading speed”. 
The reason for choosing “I do not mind” was “both have 
good points”. As the participants who downloaded “ePub” 
prefer digital books, it is considered that the participants who 
prefer paper had not been accustomed to using digital books. 
For the reason of preferring paper, “paper is good to 
memorize contents because I can leave a note on it”, “paper 
is not bad for one’s eyes”, “paper is good to concentrate on 
reading” were given. However, most participants gave the 
same reason they preferred paper. 
     Next, we will compare paper books and digital books 
regarding the time or place used. Table III shows reading 
habits and preference for paper books and/or digital books. 
The two left hand columns show participant’s information. 
“Japanese” means Japanese language proficiency and shows 
total scores of vocabulary and grammar. The three center 
columns show preference and habits of reading books. In the 
column “Preference”, “D” means digital book, “P” means 
paper book, and “DP” means that the participant chose “I do 
not mind”. 
     The results of question (9) “Were there any differences in 
your reading habits regarding the time or place you read 
digital books compared to when you read paper books in the 
past?” is shown in the column, “habits”. The results of 
question (10) “How it affected your reading habits regarding 
time and place? Which is the most frequent when you read 
on paper books?” is shown in the column, “paper”. “H” 
means home. “U” means university that includes university 
library. The four right hand columns show the rate of the 
place and time when participants read digital books in this 
experiment. “Outside” means participants were outside of 
their homes. The numeral value shows the percentage of the 
total time spent for reading based on the logs left by 
participants at each place answered in the results of question 
(11). Preference shown in Table II is reprinted. The table is 
displayed in ascending order of Japanese language 
proficiency. 
To question (9), ten participants answered “There were 
differences between paper and digital in their reading habits 
regarding time and place”. For the place where the ten 
participants read books most frequently, six of the ten 
participants answered “home” and four of the ten participants 
answered “university”. The participant with ID-2 answered 
that he usually read at the university library, although he had 
read at home in this experiment. The participants with ID-4, 
ID-5 and ID-10 had read in the train or other places outside. 
From these results, it appears that the most different point in 
reading habits between paper and digital was place when 
reading. The time of day for reading tended to differ 
depending on the place. The participants read in the morning 
or in the evening at home, and they read outside their home 
in the day time. On the other hand, the nine participants who 
answered “There was no difference between paper and 
digital in their reading habits regarding time and place” 
usually read digital books. In this experiment, The 
participants with ID-3, ID-8, ID-12, ID-14, ID-15 and ID-16 
read mostly at home, the participant with ID-7 and ID-17 
read mostly on the train, and the participant with ID-13 read 
mostly read at her university. 
From this result, it could be said that the learners who 
usually read paper books at home or university (classroom or 
library) would have more chances to read digital books with 
their smartphones anywhere and anytime. Therefore, the 
participants with ID-4 and ID-5 who usually read at the 
university library answered that there was an advantage to 
digital books. A digital library would be more convenient 
because they could borrow books anywhere.

These results support the usefulness of the current system. 
Although we need more research on their reading habits, it 
was interesting that the participants who got higher scores 
tend to prefer paper over digital in Table III. We suppose that 
the participants who prefer paper were accustomed to 
reading paper books. We also suppose that the participants 
who did not have the habit of reading might read more if 
they could use digital books. 
C. Japanese Extensive Reading on ER Lab 
In the previous study [1], the group that scored lower on 
vocabulary and grammar read more books than the upper 
group. We suppose that one of the reasons was because the 
experimenter recommended the participants to start reading 
from the lower levels. The participants who belonged to the 
upper group gave some comments like “If I was given 
something that was appropriate to my level, I would have 
read more”. Therefore, in this study, the experimenter did not 
recommend participants to start reading from the lower 
levels, although the video clips recommended users to start 
reading from the lower level. 
Table IV shows the levels of the book that was read by 
participants based on the logs left by participants. In this 
study, the higher scoring group (upper group) both on 
vocabulary and grammar read more books than the lower

group. All the participants except ID-16 in the lower group 
started reading from the lowest level. However, four 
participants in the upper group did not read the lowest level. 
Three in the four participants started reading from the fourth 
lowest level, D. Moreover, the participants in the upper 
group read the books in F level, which was not read by the 
lower group. This result supports the method of extensive 
reading “students select what they want to read” proposed by 
Day and Bamford [4]. 
     Next, the results of question (12) “What do you think the 
strong points of the graded readers is?” is shown in Table V 
with the participants’ information. “Speed” shows the 
number of letters read per minute. It was calculated by the 
number of the letters in the book they read and the time they 
spent for reading the books from the logs left by them. The 
data in Table V is shown in ascending order of reading speed. 
In the five right hand columns, “Quick” represents “I can 
read quickly”, “Kanji” represents “Kana is written on the 
right side of the kanji”, “Literature” represents “Japanese 
literature is rewritten in easy Japanese”, “Dictionary” 
represents “I can read books without a dictionary”, and 
“Ability” represents “I think that it helps to improve my 
reading ability”. In the five left hand columns, “Kanji-user” 
represents whether they use Kanji in their first language.

The participants with lower reading speed tended to be 
those who do not use Kanji in their first language. The 
participants with higher reading speed tended to choose “I 
can read quickly”. The participants who chose “Kana is 
written on the right side of the kanji” included both 
participants who use Kanji and who do not use Kanji in their 
first language. This result found that JGRs are also useful for 
the participants who use Kanji in their first language because 
the pronunciation of Kanji in Japanese is different from that 
in Chinese. Moreover, from the result that the number of the 
participants who chose “Japanese literature is rewritten in 
easy Japanese” was ranked third, we could find the beneficial 
point of graded readers that are rewrites of literature whose 
copyright has expired. Three of the four participants who 
chose “I think that it helps to improve my reading ability” 
were those who do not use Kanji in their first language and 
belonged to the lower group. 
For the results of question (13) “What do you think the 
weak points of the graded readers are?”, nine participants 
chose “Vocabulary is too repetitious”, six participants chose 
“It was too simple”. These are the character of graded 
readers. One participant answered “there is no weak point”. 
On the other hand, three participants answered “it was not 
user-friendly on a smartphone” and “it would be convenient 
if I could read it on some application instead of “html””. To 
trace these problems, some improvement might be needed in 
the explanations in the video clips that recommended “html” 
if the user had never used “ePub” or “mobi”. 
  To question (14) “If there is something that you prefer to 
have or to improve, please write”, the following responses 
were given: 
“It is wonderful that Japanese literature was 
rewritten in easy Japanese for learners.” (ID-8) 
“I would like to read some interesting stories that 
are written in more advanced vocabulary and 
grammar.” (ID-3) 
“I would like to improve my reading ability using 
this system.” (ID-15) 
“It would be better if there are a few more 
questions in “Questions” about the stories.” (ID-
14) 
“It would be better if the story had been written 
horizontally (especially on smartphones).” (ID-8, 
ID-15) 
     Although most of the books are written horizontally, 
novels in Japanese are written vertically. Going forward, we 
need to consider whether writing JGR horizontally would be 
more learner friendly. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
  In this study, the current self-ER support system was 
evaluated from the results of the post-questionnaire and the 
logs on the system left by users surveyed by the author. 
Knowing one’s progress on their personal pages helped 
participants to enjoy reading and motivated them to read 
more. The advantage of the self-ER support system is that it 
can provide digital books for learners outside the classroom 
at minimal cost and no waiting time. The online library of 
JGRs has the potential to provide the opportunity to make 
time to read for learners who cannot find the time to read.  
Moreover, the results confirmed that independent learners 
without teachers could start Japanese extensive reading by 
using the system. Further work is needed to increase the 
number of JGRs and to add a vocabulary level test that can 
judge the appropriate level of JGR for learners to start 
reading from.
