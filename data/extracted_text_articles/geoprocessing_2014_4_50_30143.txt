Abstract—The Cellular Automata based method for Minimizing
Flow (CAMF) aims at selecting, from a rasterized database
representing a river catchment, a predeﬁned number of cells
that should be afforested in order to minimize the sediment
yield of the catchment. To this end, CAMF iteratively ranks
cells according to sediment yield reduction, taking into account
spatial interaction among cells. It was found during tests that
the execution time of CAMF is directly proportional to the
database size and the number of cells to be selected. This
behavior can become a limiting factor for the applicability of
CAMF to high resolution databases that cover large geographical
areas. This issue motivated the necessity of exploring simpliﬁed
CAMF variants that reduce its execution time and preserve the
accuracy of its results. For this purpose, a simpliﬁed variant
called on-site CAMF was devised, implemented and tested. On-
site CAMF ranks cells based only on local cell information, i.e.,
the local sediment reduction that afforestation would produce in
a cell, and the cell slope. During tests, on-site CAMF produced
virtually the same results as the original version of CAMF in
only a small fraction of the execution time. This means that, for
these particular tests, spatial interaction did not inﬂuence CAMF
output, possibly due to the number of cells that were selected,
which was small with respect to the full geodatabase size. It is
expected that spatial interaction becomes a relevant factor when
larger sets of cells are selected.

INTRODUCTION
Soil erosion is a common problem in tropical moun-
tainous regions. In such regions, rainfall typically produces
high levels of runoff, which in turn causes the soil to be
eroded and, as a consequence, large amounts of sediment are
produced, transported and deposited [1]. This often leads to
the undesirable result of degraded soil, i.e., soil with severely
limited performance in terms of fertility and productivity. A
second negative consequence caused by soil erosion occurs
when the sediment produced is delivered to the river system
of a catchment. This sediment will be partially transported
so that it will eventually reach the outlet of the catchment.
This process is a critical factor when there exists a dammed
reservoir downstream the river, since the sediment input to such
infrastructures might produce high costs for sediment removal
and a shortening of the reservoir lifespan given the resulting
loss of capacity [2]. These factors make the study of sediment
ﬂow in mountainous regions crucially important.
One measure that has proven useful to control sediment
production is afforestation ([3], [4], [5]), especially when it is
technically planned and based on sufﬁcient scientiﬁcally sound
information. Typically, when planning an afforestation project,
several criteria are to be considered simultaneously. Some of
these criteria may pertain to the local performance of areas
within the study region. This type of criteria are referred to
as on-site. An example of on-site criteria is the amount of
carbon sequestered both in soil and in biomass. On the other
hand, some criteria can be related to the effect that changes in
the state of a given area produce in the state of neighboring
or even distant areas within the study region. These criteria
are classiﬁed as off-site. Sediment delivery to the river and
sediment yield of a river catchment are examples of this
type of criteria. Both on-site as well as off-site criteria allow
forest planners to discriminate between suitable and unsuitable
alternatives, e.g., selecting sites for afforestation, choosing the
species to be planted, or deciding when to harvest the forest.
The term site location for afforestation used throughout this
paper refers to determining the exact locations in which trees
should be planted. In this speciﬁc case, decision alternatives
correspond to candidate sites within a river catchment that
are available to be afforested. Only areas under agriculture
and pasture are considered as candidates for afforestation. A
single off-site factor, the amount of sediment at the outlet of
the catchment, or sediment yield, was chosen as the decision
criterion. Since the study regions are represented by raster
datasets, the problem amounts to selecting a subset of cells
(pixels) that should be afforested in order to minimize the

sediment yield of a river catchment.
A computational iterative method to tackle this problem
was proposed in [6]. This method aimed to select, at each itera-
tion, the cell(s) that, in case of being afforested, would produce
the maximum reduction in sediment yield. The name Cellular
Automata-based method for Minimizing Flow (CAMF) was
used to refer to this method. To select a cell or cells at each
iteration, CAMF computes the sediment yield reduction that
would be produced considering that every candidate cell is
afforested separately. This sediment yield reduction values is
then used to build a ranking from which the optimal cell(s) is
(are) selected.
Some limitations were identiﬁed in CAMF. One of these
limitations is the fact that scoring cells and building the ranking
are relatively expensive procedures in terms of execution time.
A second limitation is that there is a high probability that only
one cell is selected at each iteration, so that many iterations
of CAMF are necessary in order to select the required number
of cells. This undesirable combination of repeating many
times a computationally expensive procedure might restrict
the applicability of CAMF when dealing with high resolution
datasets that cover extensive study areas.
This work aimed at providing insights about several aspects
of CAMF. First, the performance of CAMF was examined as
a function of the size of the database to which it is applied and
of the number of cells to be selected. This analysis produced
indicators about the applicability of CAMF to large databases,
which are frequently found in natural resources management
projects. This goal was meant to complement the work reported
in [6], where only very small, sample databases were used
during tests. The second general aim was to propose a variant
of CAMF that addresses its limitations to drastically reduce
its execution time while preserving the quality of the results
it produces.
Section II introduces the study regions and the correspond-
ing geodatabases that were used during tests. This section also
explains CAMF and its on-site variant in detail as well as the
performance indicators that were collected during tests. Section
III presents and discusses the results produced by CAMF and
its on-site variant. Finally, Section IV draws some conclusions
and proposes a few points that require further work.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Study regions
Three raster geodatabases were used for testing CAMF.
These geodatabases, stored using the ArcInfo ASCII grid
format, represent nested river catchments located in the south-
ern Andes of Ecuador using a cell resolution of 30x30 m.
The study regions and their corresponding geodatabases are
introduced below.
1) The Paute river catchment: The Paute river catchment is
located in the southern Andes of Ecuador. Its area is 5055 km2.
Altitudes in this catchment vary between 1591 and 4651 m asl.
High sediment production rates have been measured in this
catchment in the past [1] and several dammed reservoirs that
are part of one of the most important Ecuadorian hydroelectric
complexes are located within this catchment. The location in
Ecuador and the sediment production of the Paute catchment

Location and sediment production of the Tabacay catchment. Cell
size is 30x30 m
are shown in Figure 1. The areas under agriculture and pasture
in this catchment correspond to a total of 1483 km2 (around
30% of the full area of the catchment).
2) The Tabacay river catchment: Tabacay is a subcatch-
ment of the Paute catchment. Its total area amounts to 66.3
km2. The altitudes are in the range between 2481 and 3732
m asl. The importance of studying sediment production and
transport in this catchment is given by the fact that the Tabacay
river, besides being a tributary of the Paute river, is used as the
source for provision of drinking water to the city of Azogues.
Agriculture and pasture cover a region of 24 km2 in the
Tabacay catchment (39% of the total catchment area). Figure 2
depicts the location of Tabacay within the Paute catchment and
its sediment production.
3) The Tabacay500 database: The third database used in
tests corresponds to a part of the Tabacay catchment, which
represents an area of 1.7 km2 around its outlet. The codename
Tabacay500 was chosen for this database because it comprises
500 cells (26% of the full area) that are considered as the
initial candidates for afforestation. The location of the region
represented by this database within Tabacay and its sediment
production are displayed in Figure 3.

B. Cellular Automata based method for Minimizing Flow
(CAMF)
[6] introduced a computational iterative method aimed
to locate sites that, after afforestation, would result in the
minimization of the sediment yield of a river catchment. In
[6], the acronym CAMF is used to refer to this method, which
is described in the following subsections.
1) Required input data: To execute CAMF the following
input data are required:
Sediment production:
This is a raster dataset containing values about the
sediment produced locally in each cell, expressed
in ton cell yr−1;
Retention capacity:
If the amount of sediment in a cell is smaller than
its retention capacity, expressed in ton cell yr−1,
it is assumed that no sediment leaves that cell;
Saturation threshold:
The amount of sediment in a cell that exceeds
the saturation point, expressed in ton cell yr−1,
is assumed to be fully delivered to its steepest
downslope neighbor;
Flow factor:
Raster dataset that indicates the fraction of the
amount of sediment in a cell that is delivered
to one of its neighbors. This fraction is applied
only when the amount of sediment in a cell is in
the range between the retention capacity and the
saturation threshold;
Flow direction:
CAMF uses a Single Flow Direction (SFD)
dataset based on the Deterministic 8 (D8, [7])
method to determine the ﬂow path that sediment
follows within a catchment. The D8 method as-
sumes that ﬂow leaving a cell is delivered only to
its steepest downslope neighbor;
Solution size:
Parameter set by the user of CAMF to indicate
how many cells should be selected to be af-
forested.
Two different versions of each of the ﬁrst four datasets
listed above are required: 1) a dataset representing the initial
situation, that is, the catchment under its original land cover;
and 2) a dataset that represents the catchment in case every
cell was under forest. These two versions of each of the
four datasets are used by CAMF to compute the amount of
sediment that leaves each cell. The ﬂow direction dataset is
used to simulate the transport of the sediment within the
catchment. In other words, the ﬂow direction dataset allows
to incorporate spatial interaction into CAMF, which in turn
permits the involvement of off site criteria, like sediment yield.
2) Workﬂow: CAMF is an iterative method that comprises
the following steps:
1)
The sediment accumulation in each cell is computed.
Sediment accumulation refers to the sediment locally
produced in a cell plus the amount of sediment that
it receives from its neighbors;
2)
For each candidate cell, the sediment yield reduction
that would occur in case that cell is afforested is
computed;
3)
A ranking of all candidate cells is built based on
the sediment yield reduction values computed in the
previous step;
4)
The cell or cells at the top of the ranking that
correspond to the maximum score are selected as part
of the solution;
5)
The sediment accumulation values are updated for the
selected cells and for all the cells that are between
each selected cell and the outlet;
6)
If the total number of selected cells is less than the
solution size, repeat from step 2.
As a ﬁrst step, an implementation of CAMF as described in
[6] and outlined above was produced. This implementation is
referred to as ‘original CAMF’. The purpose of implementing
and testing original CAMF was threefold. First, to explore
the applicability of CAMF to databases that are larger than
the ones used in [6]. The second objective was to produce
reference values for comparison to the variant of CAMF
introduced below. The third objective was to approximate the
average number of cells that are selected by CAMF at each
iteration.
After studying original CAMF, two issues were pinpointed
that can compromise the computational efﬁciency or even the
applicability of this method, namely:
1)
At each iteration, CAMF computes the sediment yield
reduction that would be produced in case every single
candidate cell in the catchment was afforested. De-
pending on the extent covered and on the resolution
of the database, the number of candidate cells can
reach several millions. Note that the computation of
the sediment yield reduction for a single cell requires
simulating the sediment transport from that cell to the
outlet. After this has been done for every candidate
cell, a sorted list of cells (ranking) is built. It was
expected then that the computational time required
to build this ranking is relatively high.
2)
Once the ranking is built, only the cell or cells at
the top of the ranking that correspond exactly to
the maximum sediment yield reduction are selected.
It is unlikely that many cells correspond exactly
to the same sediment yield reduction value. As a
consequence, it was expected that only one cell is
96

selected at each iteration, which would result in a
limited use of the computationally expensive ranking
mentioned above.
As mentioned above, sediment yield minimization is an
example of an off-site criteria. This means that the sediment
yield reduction that is produced when a given cell is afforested
not only depends on local information, but also on information
pertaining to other cells, i.e., the outlet and all cells in the
steepest descent path between it and the considered cell. As
already explained, computing sediment yield reduction values
in CAMF involves the notion of spatial interaction, which
is intuitively appropriate, especially for the case of sediment
transport in mountainous regions. On the other hand, taking
spatial interaction into account is a decision that contributes
to a large extent of the computational cost of original CAMF
in terms of execution time. This issue is dealt with by the
CAMF variant proposed in the following section.
C. On-site CAMF
On-site CAMF aims at avoiding the extra computational
cost that considering spatial interaction introduces into CAMF
operation. In on-site CAMF, the notion of spatial interaction is
simply disregarded and only local (on-site) information is used
to rank cells. The motivation of on-site CAMF is based on the
claim made by [6], which states that, in general, cells with
steep slopes and high local sediment production are selected
by CAMF. Based on this conclusion and considering that these
two factors correspond to on-site information that was readily
available for the study regions, they were chosen as the basis
to compute scores that allow to produce a cell ranking in this
variant of CAMF. The score assigned by on-site CAMF to a
cell was computed using (1).
si = wffi + weei
(1)
where
•
si is the score assigned to cell i.
•
wf and we are user deﬁned parameters that can
take values in the range [0, 1] and indicate the
relative importance (weight) assigned to each factor,
either slope or sediment production, respectively, with
wf + we = 1.
•
fi is the normalized (scaled to the range [0, 1]) slope
of cell i.
•
ei is the normalized change that would be produced in
local sediment production when cell i was afforested,
that is the difference in sediment production between
the initial situation and the afforested situation.
Note that cells with higher values for si will be preferred
to be selected. Note as well that both slope and local sediment
production values do not change during the execution of this
method, which means that on-site CAMF is not an iterative
method and, therefore, all required cells are selected in a single
step.
D. Methodology
1) Performance measures: The experimental phase con-
sisted in several executions of both original and on-site CAMF
for the three databases described in Section II-A for solution
sizes corresponding to 1, 10, 100 and 1000 cells. During each
test, several performance factors were recorded, namely:
Sediment yield reduction:
Decrease in the sediment yield of a catchment
(with respect to the initial situation) when the
required number of cells are afforested;
Execution time:
CPU time necessary to produce the required out-
put;
Number of iterations:
Number
of
iterations
performed
by
original
CAMF to produce the required output;
Spatial coincidence:
This is a comparative performance measure ap-
plicable only to on-site CAMF. It uses the out-
put (cells selected for afforestation) produced by
original CAMF as a reference. Spatial coincidence
was computed as nc
n , where nc is the number of
common cells selected by both original and on-
site CAMF, and n is the solution size. Therefore,
a spatial coincidence of 1 indicates that both
methods selected exactly the same set of cells.
2) Parameter values: The different input datasets and pa-
rameter values used when executing all versions of CAMF
are listed in TABLE I. The values corresponding to retention
capacity and saturation threshold were arbitrarily set in such
a way that around half of the available sediment under the
original land cover leaves the river catchment in a time unit
(year).
III.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Original CAMF
The output and performance measures obtained after exe-
cuting original CAMF are shown in TABLE II. The sediment
yield reduction in case the corresponding number of cells are
afforested is shown as an absolute value in the second column
and as a percentage with respect to the initial sediment yield in
the third column. The last column shows the average number
of cells that are selected at each iteration.
It is clear from TABLE II that sediment yield reduction
values for Tabacay500 and Paute increase almost proportion-
ally with respect to the solution size, which is an indication
that at least 100 cells in Tabacay500 and 1000 cells in Paute
perform almost equally well when afforested. This is not the
case for Tabacay, where such proportionality is evident only
when comparing the sediment yield reduction corresponding to
solutions sizes of 1 and 10. This proportionality is not present
when solutions sizes of 100 and 1000 cells are considered.
Except for Tabacay500, execution times seem to increase also
in a direct proportion with respect to solution sizes. This
is given by the fact that in almost all cases the number of
iterations performed by original CAMF is equal to or slightly
smaller than the corresponding solution size. This effect is less
noticeable for Tabacay500, for which only very short times are

required. In this case, internal details of the implementation
and even technical aspects related to the way in which the
algorithm is executed by the operating system take a higher
relative importance with respect to factors pertaining to the
method itself, like simulating sediment ﬂow and building the
ranking of cells.
Unexpectedly, in all tests involving solution sizes of 100
and 1000, the number of cells selected per iteration by original
CAMF is greater than one. This ﬁnding indicates that the
probability of more than one cell corresponding to exactly the
same maximum sediment yield reduction at a given iteration
plays a role in practice. This may be an indication that the
function applied to compute the amount of sediment leaving
a cell and the way in which sediment ﬂow is simulated, play
a homogenizing role for the computation of sediment yield
reduction values. On the other hand, in all those tests, the
average number of cells selected per iteration is still close
to one. This characteristic may make CAMF execution times
unnecessarily long.
Database size, in terms of number of candidate cells, has a
clear impact on execution times. This is explained by the fact
that larger database sizes will require more cells to be pro-
cessed at each iteration. When comparing the execution times
obtained for Paute to the corresponding values for Tabacay,
a clear proportionality is found. This is not the case when
execution times for Tabacay and Tabacay500 are contrasted.
This may be the result of (very short) execution times for
Tabacay500 being largely inﬂuenced by internal, technical
aspects of algorithm execution. When considering execution
times separately, it can be argued that they start to play a
restrictive role for large databases like Paute. Speciﬁcally,
original CAMF requires more than 3 hours to select 100 cells
in Paute, and almost 26 hours for a solution size of 1000
Figure 4.

cells. Additionally, it is important to note that the solutions
sizes tested are rather limited, considering the full size of the
database, especially for the case of Paute.
Figure 4 shows the 1000 cells that were selected by original
CAMF in Tabacay.
B. On-site CAMF
The ﬁrst step conducted when applying on-site CAMF
was to determine sensible values for the relative importance
98

parameters corresponding to slope and sediment (wf and we
in (1)). In this case, a naive trial-and-error approach was
used, based on testing different combinations of values for
wf and we to score, rank and select cells and assessing the
corresponding values of sediment yield reduction produced
when the selected cells were afforested. The tested parameter
values and the resulting sediment yield reduction values are
listed in TABLE III.
The values in columns 2 to 6 of TABLE III show the
ratio between the sediment yield reduction produced by on-site
CAMF when the relative importance parameters were set to the
values indicated in the headers and the sediment yield reduc-
tion value produced by original CAMF for the corresponding
database and solution size. From this we can conclude that
setting wf = 0.01 and we = 0.99 produces the best results
from among the tested combinations. This means that slope
plays a very limited role in cell selection in CAMF, whereas
local sediment reduction appears as the most relevant factor in
this regard. These values were used in all tests performed with
on-site CAMF to produce the performance indicators listed in
TABLE IV. Column ‘SYR fraction’ shows the ratio between
the absolute sediment yield reduction resulting from on-site
CAMF and original CAMF. Similarly, ‘CPU time fraction’
lists the ratio between the execution time of on-site CAMF
with respect to original CAMF.
It can be seen from TABLE IV that on-site CAMF produces
practically the same results as original CAMF. A ﬁrst interpre-
tation of these results is that spatial interaction does not play
a role for the combination of databases and parameter values
used during the tests. Considering the values set for the relative
importance parameters (wf and we), it can be argued that the
local sediment reduction information, that is, the amount in
which sediment production would decrease in every cell when
afforested, is virtually the only factor that is determining which
cells are selected.
Stating that spatial interaction does not play a role when
sediment transport simulation in particular, and off-site criteria
in general, are involved may seem counter intuitive. However,
this ﬁnding can be supported by the fact that relatively limited
solution sizes were used during the tests, especially for the
cases of Tabacay and Paute. When a limited number of cells
are to be selected from a large number of candidate cells, it
can occur that most selected cells in fact does not interact with
each other, which means that they do not share a meaningful
segment of their path to the outlet and therefore, changes in the
state of one cell do not affect the state of other selected cells.
It can be claimed that the river may act as an element that
produces interaction among cells, since sediment leaving most
cells will eventually reach and be transported by the river to the
outlet. However, the river plays the role of a transport channel,
that is, it does not really inﬂuence the sediment yield attributed
to a given cell, or the sediment yield reduction produced
when that cell is afforested. This means that all sediment that
leaves a cell and reaches the river will be fully transported
to the outlet of the catchment, at least for the parameter
values used during the tests, especially regarding retention
capacity and saturation threshold. It is expected that using
larger solution sizes would lead to an increased probability
of spatial interaction occurrence among selected cells. In that
case, it can be foreseen that on-site CAMF would produce
signiﬁcantly different results with respect to original CAMF,
also this claim is not backed up by the output of on-site CAMF
for Tabacay500.
Regarding execution times of on-site CAMF, it is clear that
they are not inﬂuenced by solution size, since once the ranking
is built it takes about the same time to select any number of
cells from it. On the other hand, execution times are indeed
inﬂuenced by the database size, since the time spent building
the ranking of cells will depend on the number of candidate
cells. CPU time fractions show the dramatic reduction on
execution time that is observed when spatial interaction is left
out of consideration and when all cells are selected in a single
step, instead of using iterative selection.
IV.
CONCLUSIONS
[6] proposed a technique called CAMF with the aim
of selecting from a rasterized database representing a river
catchment a set of cells to be afforested in order to minimize
the sediment yield of the whole catchment. In this paper an im-
plementation of CAMF was produced and its performance was
tested on three databases representing nested river catchments
in the southern Andes of Ecuador, with the aim of analyzing
the behavior of CAMF when applied to databases that differ
greatly in size. In addition, the inﬂuence of the number of cells
to be selected on the performance of CAMF was assessed.
In contradiction to what was initially expected, the number
of cells selected at each iteration by original CAMF was not
exactly 1 in all tests. This indicates that the possibility of
two or more cells having exactly the same sediment yield
reduction value at a given iteration, although limited, does
exist. However, since the observed deviation from 1 is small
or, in other cases, the number of selected cells per iteration is
exactly 1, execution times increase almost in direct proportion
with respect to solution sizes. Besides solution size, the number
of cells comprised in the database has also a clear impact
on execution times. This fact allows to conclude that execu-
tion time can become a limiting factor for original CAMF,
speciﬁcally in cases in which it is applied to high resolution
databases covering large extents and using large solution sizes.
This restriction would be even more apparent in such contexts
when several runs of original CAMF are necessary, as it could
be the case when performing scenario analysis, or when using
original CAMF as a component of an integral model or method
that requires to execute it repeatedly in a systematic way.
A variant of CAMF called on-site CAMF was also pro-
posed, implemented and tested on the same databases as the
original CAMF. On-site CAMF uses only local cell informa-
tion, i.e., sediment reduction and slope, to score and rank cells.
Tests using on-site CAMF produced very similar results with
respect to original CAMF outputs, in an almost negligible,
constant execution time. One interpretation of this ﬁnding may
be that for these speciﬁc combinations of databases, solution
sizes, and parameter values, spatial interaction does not play a
role. This observation can be attributed to the fact that solution
sizes used in tests are limited when compared to the full
database sizes. It is assumed then that, when larger solution
sizes are used, the relevance of the spatial interaction role will
signiﬁcantly increase. It is expected that, in such cases, on-site
CAMF would produce different results with respect to original
CAMF.

It is clear that CAMF behavior depends heavily on the
values set for its parameters. This is especially true for the
retention capacities and saturation thresholds for every cell.
Values for these and other parameters must be carefully deter-
mined, in order for CAMF to reproduce real world phenomena
in a valid way. A systematic and scientiﬁc sound calibration
procedure becomes a requirement in this regard. However,
such a procedure most likely would involve a more detailed
consideration of sediment production and transport, which lies
beyond the scope of this paper.
