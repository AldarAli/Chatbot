Abstract—Today, consumers tend to buy products online 
because of several advantages compared to shop in brick and 
mortar stores. One advantage of online shopping is to browse, 
search, and buy products from online shops all over the world. 
However, the attitude of online shoppers towards using foreign 
websites for buying products online might be influenced by 
factors that result from high uncertainties when using foreign 
websites. This paper analyses factors that might influence the 
attitude of web users toward foreign websites to buy products 
online. In this study, a survey with 60 German web users was 
conducted. The results were presented in a regression model 
and suggest that future research should focus on developing, 
testing and validating concepts that are influencing the attitude 
toward foreign websites before conducting large-scale studies. 
Keywords-online shopping; foreign websites. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Advantages of online shopping versus shopping in brick 
and mortar stores are convenience and reducing cost for 
information. Web users can easily screen information of a 
large variety of products and compare products and their 
prices [1]. Online shops are available anytime from 
anywhere. Buying products online is time efficiently because 
of avoiding crowds in brick and mortar stores and the 
traveling to get there [2]. Also, discrete shopping, avoidance 
of pressure from salesmen [3], and personalized shopping 
through recommender systems are additional reasons for 
shopping online for some users [4]. Furthermore, the 
geographical limitation of brick and mortar stores is 
overcome by online shopping. Users can browse, search, and 
buy products from online shops all over the world. Literature 
has shown that there are several factors that influence web 
users’ choice when selecting an online shop to buy products 
from. However, there are only few studies available that 
explicitly examine factors that might have an influence on 
the attitude of online shoppers toward using foreign websites 
for buying products online [5][6]. 
While several studies analyzed customer’s attitudes and 
factors influencing online shopping behavior in general 
[7][8][9], factors like risk, trust, privacy and security issues 
might have a negative influence on customer’s attitude 
toward using online shops of foreign countries, because of 
high uncertainties (e.g., country’s laws or reliability of 
shipping) [10]. On the other hand, there might be factors 
influencing the customer’s attitude positively toward foreign 
online shops, e.g., originality of the product or lower prices. 
In addition, there might be some disadvantages of shopping 
online in general that can become even more relevant when 
shopping on foreign websites. For example, higher costs for 
shipping and handling charges, or the time it may take until 
the product arrives at the consumer may exceed the 
advantages of shopping online for consumers [11]. 
This study aims to analyze factors that influence the 
attitude of web users toward foreign websites for buying 
products online. It is important to understand customers’ 
characteristics, 
online 
shopping 
behavior, 
consumer’ 
expectations, and their attitude toward online shopping in 
general to get an insight on their attitude toward foreign 
online shops. In this study, a conceptual model and 
hypotheses were developed and tested by conducting a web-
based questionnaire on German web users and their attitude 
toward foreign websites for buying products online. This 
research will contribute to the understanding of the adoption 
of online shopping and will support the development of 
international online shopping in general. In addition, this 
study can encourage more researchers to examine factors that 
improve the attitude of web users of different countries 
toward foreign websites for buying products online. 
After this introduction, a review of the literature about 
influences on the attitude towards online shopping and the 
hypotheses for this study will be described in section 2. In 
section 3, the methods for the survey that was conducted will 
be explained. Section 4 will present the results of this survey. 
Section 5 will summarize the main findings of this study and 
will give an outlook on further research.

LITERATURE REVIEW 
A. Attitude Toward Websites for Buying Products Online 
The high popularity of online shopping is still unbroken. 
According 
to 
estimates 
by 
private 
consultancies 
[12][13][14], worldwide retail e-commerce sales is forecast 
to double from 1.9 trillion US-Dollars in 2016 to 4.1 trillion 
US-Dollars in 2020 [13]. Although, the forecast is that e-
commerce growth will slow over time, a 22% growth rate in 
2018 still indicates the importance of e-commerce channel 
for consumers and retailers. The number of web users buying 
products online is also still growing and had been expected 
to be over 1.6 billion people by the end of 2017 [13].

Several research had been conducted about what might 
influence consumers in their choice of browsing and buying 
products online. Studies in the context of Theory of Planned 
Behavior (TPB) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) 
have shown that there is a strong positive impact of 
customers’ attitude toward online shopping on the 
customers’ intention to use online shopping (e.g., [15][16]). 
The attitude toward online shopping can be defined as the 
“the extent to which a consumer likes on-line shopping and 
considers it to be a good idea” [9]. 
Because of the large quantity of research about online 
shopping acceptance in general, some researchers already 
tried to summarize the existing findings in comprehensive 
models. Chang, Cheung, and Lai [17] analyzed empirical 
studies where factors for adoption of online shopping were 
analyzed. They used and adapted the scheme by Jarvenpaa 
and Todd [18] to categorize these factors into three 
categories. These categories are perceived characteristics of 
the web as a sale channel, characteristics of the consumer, 
and characteristics of the website or products.  
Perceived characteristics of the web as a sales channel 
describe uncertainty and concerns regarding trust, risk, 
privacy and security. These risks can relate to the product 
(quality, expectation) or the transaction process (payment, 
delivery). In addition, the perceived relative advantage 
(convenience, time saving) of online shopping compared to 
brick and mortar stores, the online shopping experience of 
the web user and the service quality can play an important 
role when evaluating the web as a sales channel.  
The second category is the characteristics of the 
consumer. These are the consumer’s shopping orientation 
(i.e., 
price, 
recreational, 
brand, 
and 
impulsiveness), 
demographics, knowledge of and experience with the 
Internet, as well as the consumer’s innovativeness in general.  
The third characteristics relate to the website or product, 
which can reduce (providing additional service, e.g., money 
back guarantee) or raise the perceived risk (e.g., high cost 
product, infrequently purchased).  
Similar work had been done by Li and Zhang [19] before, 
who found less but similar factors and categories. Zhou, Dai, 
and Zhang [20] also combined research about consumer 
characteristics that might influence the attitude toward online 
shopping to develop an Online Shopping Acceptance Model. 
Their model incorporated factors about demographics, 
Internet experience, shopping motivation, innovativeness, 
perceived outcome, shopping orientation, normative beliefs 
attitude, online shopping experience, online shopping 
intention and satisfaction.  
Because of the potential of online shopping in 
international markets, several researchers have also analyzed 
the influence of culture on the adaption of online shopping 
[21][22][24][25]. Most studies applied Hofstede’s cultural 
dimensions to explain differences in national culture and 
online shopping. Research has shown that success of a 
company’s online shop in one country does not have to 
imply success in other countries or cultures [26][27] because 
customers’ characteristics and customers’ expectations of 
online shopping and product information may be different 
from one country to another [28].  
B. Attitude Toward Using Foreign Online Shops 
Although there has been several research on cultural 
dimensions and the adaption of online shopping to national 
culture or countries, there are only few studies available that 
examine consumers’ attitude toward using foreign websites 
in general. Hence, research demands for more empirical 
studies on “factors affecting global online consumers’ 
willingness to transact on international web sites” [29]. 
Beside culture, factors regarding economy, infrastructure, 
politics and laws of other countries can have an influence on 
a global consumers’ attitude toward online shopping on 
foreign websites [30]. Furthermore, consumers’ intention to 
buy products from foreign websites can be influenced by 
consumers’ characteristics (online shopping confidence and 
expertise) and motivations (importance of price, product 
availability in domestic market, time of delivery, and 
shipping costs), as well as the consumers’ knowledge about 
other countries [5]. In addition, the frequency of using 
foreign websites for online shopping can be different from 
country to country. For example, Australians tend to order 
many of their online purchases from foreign websites [5]. 
Many Americans have bought products from foreign 
websites once, but might be detained by high costs for 
transaction and shipping to buy more frequently overseas. In 
contrast, only 2% of Swedish consumers have bought online 
from foreign websites [31].  
Attitude toward using foreign online shops can be 
defined as the extent to which a consumer likes online 
shopping on foreign websites and considers it to be a good 
idea (modified by Vijayasarathy [9]). In this study, a foreign 
online shopping website is defined as an online shopping 
website where it is obvious to the customer that the product 
is shipped from abroad, that seller has a foreign address, or 
that the website’s address has an obviously foreign ending. 
This study analyzes consumer characteristics that have 
had an influence on attitude in other studies and that are 
hypothesized to be especially relevant in the context of 
foreign websites for buying products online. These factors 
are financial risk, product risk, convenience risk, non-
delivery risk, return policy risk, personal innovativeness, and 
relative advantage of online shopping in general. 
1) Risks 
Risk is consumers’ uncertainty that they face when they 
cannot foresee the consequences of a particular transaction 
[39]. Thus, risk in online shopping can be defined as “the 
potential for loss in pursuing a desired outcome while 
engaged in online shopping” [33]. Risk and trust have been 
an object of investigation in several studies because of the 
impersonal characteristics of online shopping compared to 
shopping in brick and mortar stores [34]. Research had 
shown that the influence of perceived risk on customer’s 
intentions to buy online was strongly negative [16][35][36]. 
Most research has also analyzed different types of risks in 
online shopping. For example, product uncertainty and 
transaction risk have proven to be a problem in B2C e-
commerce [37]. Risk had proven to have a negative 
influence on online shopping intention across several 
countries and cultures [22][28][38]. In this study, the types 
37

of risks in online shopping (financial, product, convenience, 
non-delivery, and return-policy) adapted from [39] will be 
analyzed and adapted to German web users and the influence 
of risk on web user’s attitude toward foreign websites for 
buying products online. Financial risk describes risks 
regarding payment, product risk describes risks regarding 
product viewed on screen, convenience risk describes risks 
regarding comfort of online shopping, non-delivery risk 
describes risk regarding shipping, and return-policy risk 
describes risk regarding sending products back to the retailer. 
Also, in other studies financial risk, product risk, concern for 
privacy and security have shown to have significant 
influence on attitude [40]. Thus, hypotheses regarding risks 
are:  
H1a: Perceived financial risk in general has a negative 
influence on attitude toward foreign websites for buying 
products online.  
H1b: Perceived product risk in general has a negative 
influence on attitude toward foreign websites for buying 
products online.  
H1c: Perceived convenience risk in general has a 
negative influence on attitude toward foreign websites for 
buying products online.  
H1d: Perceived delivery risk in general has a negative 
influence on attitude toward foreign websites for buying 
products online.  
H1e: Perceived return policy risk in general has a 
negative influence on attitude toward foreign websites for 
buying products online. 
2) Personal Innovativeness 
Personal innovativeness can be defined as the extend and 
speed an individual adopts new innovations [41]. In 
comparison to shopping in brick and mortar shops, shopping 
online can be characterized as innovative. Several studies 
analyzed personal innovativeness or domain specific 
innovativeness and the influence on attitude or intention to 
use online shopping, also for shopping across national 
borders [6] and cultures [42]. Most studies have shown that 
personal innovativeness has a positive influence on attitude 
and intentions to shop online [15][43][44]. Nevertheless, it 
has also shown that domain specific innovativeness (product 
specific innovativeness in online shopping context) can lead 
to more significant findings for this relationship [45]. 
However, this study does not explore attitude toward online 
shopping regarding a specific product or product type. 
Hence, this study uses personal innovativeness as the 
concept that influences attitude toward online shopping on 
foreign websites.  
H2: Personal innovativeness regarding information 
technology has a positive influence on attitude toward 
foreign websites for buying products online. 
3) Relative Advantage 
Relative advantage is defined as the extent to which a 
consumer perceives an innovation to be better than the idea it 
supersedes [41]. The advantages of online shopping in 
comparison to shopping in traditional physical stores can be 
lower prices, saving time, large variety of products, ease of 
comparing products, 24 hours availability of online shops 
and convenience (e.g., buying from anywhere, avoiding 
queues) [2]. Research has shown that relative advantage has 
a positive influence on attitude toward online shopping in 
general [8], also in international studies [23].  
H3: Perceived relative advantage in general has a 
positive influence on attitude toward foreign websites for 
buying products online.

* Marked items were not used in correlation and regression analysis of this work. 
The scale was also adapted in several studies to measure 
the attitude toward technology in TAM [47]. The items were 
measured using Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly 
disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). 
Demographic factors and factors related to Internet and 
online shopping experience were included in the model as 
control variables. These factors are age, gender, education. 
Age was measured in years, gender was measured as a 
dummy variable (male was coded 1, female was coded 0), 
education, 
Internet 
experience 
and 
online

experience were measured ordinally. 
C. Data Analysis 
Data analysis was performed using Multiple Ordinary 
Least Squares (OLS) regression. Multiple OLS regression is 
a statistical technique that provides information about the 
relationship between several independent variables and a 
dependent or criterion variable. The analysis was performed 
using IBM SPSS Statistics version 22. 
IV. 
RESULTS 
Before performing the regression analysis, a few steps 
need to be conducted. First, construct reliability of the main 
concepts that are measured using multiple item scale were 
evaluated by using Cronbach alphas coefficient. Three items 
from the questionnaire were removed (CON2, DEL2, 
ADV3) to improve Cronbach alpha coefficients. Three of the 
concepts exceed the widely suggested value of 0.7 [51], 
which means that Cronbach alpha coefficient of convenience 
is acceptable (>0.7) and Cronbach alpha coefficient of 
personal innovativeness and attitude toward foreign websites 
for buying products online are good (>0.8). For these 
constructs, the reliability is satisfactory. The Cronbach alpha 
coefficient for financial risk only exceeds the value of 0.5. 
This indicates that the reliability of this construct is poor. 
The Cronbach alpha coefficient for delivery risk and return 
policy risk only exceeds the value of 0.6. This indicates that 
the reliability of this construct is questionable. The Cronbach 
alpha coefficient for product risk does not exceed the value 
of 0.5. This indicates that the reliability of this construct is 
not acceptable. The results are shown in Tab. 3. Then, the 
summated scale for each concept was created by averaging 
the multiple-item scales that belong to the same concept to 
perform regression analysis.

Finally, Pearson correlation coefficients were used to 
analyze bivariate correlations among variables. Thus, one-
on-one relationships between key variables were examined 
by using correlation analysis. Results from correlation 
analysis are presented in Tab. 5.  
The results show that online shopping experience in years is 
higher for male (r= 0.330; p<0.01) and for older respondents 
(r= 0.335; p<0.01), but lower for respondents with a high 
return policy risk (r= -0.444; p<0.01) and respondents with 
low personal innovativeness (r= 0.364; p<0.01). Online 
shopping frequency is higher for respondents that have 
higher personal innovativeness (r= 0.367; p<0.01) and 
respondents that have higher relative advantage (r= 0.439; 
p<0.01). Respondents that have a higher convenience risk 
tend to have a lower personal innovativeness (r= 0.521; 
p<0.01) and lower relative advantage (r= -0.307; p<0.05). 
The hypotheses in this study were tested by multiple OLS 
regression analysis. The results reveal that the influence of 
product risk (β=-0.108; p=0.444), convenience risk (β=-
0.310; p=0.063), and return policy risk (β=-0.136; p=0.358) 
on attitude toward foreign websites for buying products 
online is negative, but not statistically significant (p-values 
>0.05). Financial risk has a positive influence on attitude 
toward foreign websites for buying products online 
(β=0.207; p=0.162) but is also not significant (p>0.05). 
Therefore, hypotheses 1a, 1b, and 1d are not statistically 
supported. Delivery risk has a positive influence on attitude 
toward foreign websites for buying products online 
(β=0.321; p=0.028) and is significant (p<0.05). Hence, 
hypothesis 1c is not supported, too. Hypotheses 2 and 3 
predict a positive influence of personal innovativeness and 
relative advantage on attitude toward foreign websites for 
buying products online. The results are reported in Tab. 4.

The relationships between control variables and attitude 
toward foreign websites for buying products online are found 
as the following. Age negatively influences attitude toward 
foreign websites for buying products online (β=0-.306; 
p<0.05).

of 
gender 
(β=0.127), 
education 
(β=0.049), online shopping experience in years (β=-.092), 
and online shopping frequency (β=0.034) on attitude toward 
foreign websites for buying products online are not 
significant in this study. The values of R square (R^2=0.323) 
and adjusted R square (adj. R^2=0.150) in the regression 
model suggest that there might be more factors that can 
explain variance in the attitude toward foreign website for 
buying products online.  
Finally, to check for the possible problem of 
multicollinearity among all variables in each equation, the 
Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) statistics was evaluated.  The 
VIF values range from 1.281 to 2.018, which were 
significantly below the critical value of 10 as suggested by 
Moon, Chadee, and Tikoo [52]. This implies no 
multicollinearity issue in the analysis. 
V. 
DISCUSSION 
The present study aims to investigate the attitude of 
German web user toward foreign websites for buying 
products online. No supporting evidence that perceived 
financial risk, product risk, convenience risk, and return 
policy risk associate with attitude toward foreign websites 
for buying products online can be found from regression 
analysis with the data collected in this study. Also, the data is 
not sufficient to support the hypotheses that personal 
innovativeness and relative advantage influence the attitude 
toward foreign websites for buying products online. Results 
for the relationship between non-delivery risk and attitude 
toward foreign websites for buying products online showed a 
positive influence which is contrary to the hypothesis 
(positive influence). However, data shows that customers 
who are of younger age tend to report higher attitude toward 
foreign websites for buying products online.  
Despite this finding, there are several weaknesses that 
need to be discussed. First, the samples selected for this 
study were collected by using convenience sampling. Thus,

questionnaire was only distributed to web users the author 
already had contact to before. Small-scale data collection and 
the use of OLS regression with 7 parameters may limit the 
potential 
for 
statistically 
significant 
results 
and 
generalizibility. Future studies may need to expand the 
sample size in order to get results that are more reliable. 
Second, there are some doubts that the concepts and items 
that were adapted from [39] can lead to good reliability of 
concepts, which is a major weakness of this study. 
Furthermore, there might be several other concepts that are 
more suitable to explain the attitude toward foreign websites 
for buying products online [17][20]. Also, factors that 
describe consumers’ knowledge about other countries could 
have been incorporated in such studies. However, a study 
that tried to analyze global consumers’ characteristics [5] did 
not mention the items or sources they used for measuring in 
their work. Thus, future research should develop, test and 
validate concepts to fill this gap. In addition, respective items 
for questionnaires are needed to avoid collecting data that 
may cause bias or inaccuracy in the measurement. Also, this 
study analyzed German web users only. More countries can 
be analyzed to determine their attitude toward foreign 
websites. Thus, similarities and differences can be examined. 
Furthermore, perceived risk and attitude toward online 
shopping might be influenced by other factors [17][20][26]. 
Research has shown that trust, especially in international 
context, plays an important role on the perceived risk [22]. 
Moreover, risk is not only influenced by cultural 
characteristics of consumers, but also by perceived security 
of transaction systems or policies on payment system and 
privacy protection [42]. These might also differ from country 
to country. Hence, customers’ attitude toward foreign 
websites might also depend on the foreign country, which 
they think of when they evaluate their attitude toward foreign 
websites. In addition, attitude toward buying a product online 
seems to be dependent on the type of product [43][53]. 
Altogether, it seems to be almost impossible to analyze all 
factors in one model. Still, because the geographical and 
cultural distance between customers and online retailers 
might be even higher foreign websites than domestic 
websites it can be expected that also perceived risk is higher 
for customers using foreign websites. Hence, future studies 
should explore this hypothesis by comparing attitude toward 
domestic with attitude toward foreign websites for online 
shopping. 
In conclusion, the author argues that attitude toward 
foreign websites for buying products online might be 
influenced by perceived risks. However, this research cannot 
show any statistical evidence for these inferences because of 
the small sample size and the limitations of the questionnaire 
items used in this study. Scales to measure the concepts have 
to be well approved before conducting large-scale studies.
