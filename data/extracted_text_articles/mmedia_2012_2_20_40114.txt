Abstract – Ontologies have been used for the purpose of 
bringing system and consistency to subject and knowledge 
areas. We present a criticism of the present mathematical 
structure of ontologies and indicate that they are not 
sufficient in their present form to represent the many 
different valid expressions of a subject knowledge domain. 
We propose an alternative structure for ontologies based on 
a richer multi connected complex network which contains 
the present ontology structure as a projection. We 
demonstrate how this new multi connected ontology should 
be represented as an asymmetric probability matrix.

I. INTRODUCTION 
A. The present state of ontologies 
There has been exceptional growth in the annotation of 
information prompted by the increasing need to share data 
and study objects based on their structure and semantics. 
[1] We now find annotated information in a wide range of 
areas such as language, biology, computing, medicine, 
web content, etc. Annotated information is created from 
structured vocabularies known as ontologies. Many 
disciplines have now developed their own standardized 
ontologies to enable the sharing of  information in their 
fields. SNOMED, for instance has been produced in the 
field of medicine, [2] as well as many others which are 
now being referenced. [3] 
 
Ontology 
defines 
a 
common 
vocabulary 
for 
researchers who need to share information in a domain. 
Many subject areas are now developing ontologies so that 
specialists can share information in their fields not only 
with other specialists but even with machines. [4] 
Machine-interpretable definitions of basic concepts in the 
domain and relations among them enable the widespread 
use of information on the internet and the construction of 
expert systems. 
 
An ontology uses relationships to organize concepts 
into hierarchies or subject domains. [3] This paper 
investigates the present structure of ontologies and 
whether they are applicable to describing subject domains 
in their present form. The basic problem we consider is 
whether the present structure of ontologies is rich enough 
to represent subject domains fully. We contend that the 
concept of ontologies needs to be extended in order to 
fully realise a complete subject domain and we indicate 
ways in which this extension might be approached 
B. Critique of Ontologies 
Our approach to ontology structure originates with the 
ideas of the German philosopher Martin Heidegger (1889 
– 1976). Heidegger was critical of a one-dimensional 
division of the world into simplistic categories. According 
to 
Heidegger, 
“The 
philosophical 
tradition 
has 
misunderstood human experience by imposing a subject-
object schema upon it.” [5] 
 
Heidegger gives the example of a hammer which 
cannot be represented just by its physical features and 
functions. To understand the hammer you cannot detach it 
from its relationship to the nails, to the anvil, to the wood, 
to the experience and skill of the carpenter or to a hundred 
other things. Just putting it in a category of tools, in an 
ontology cannot fully capture the human idea of the object 
and its role in the world. A more complex structure is 
needed to capture the representation of reality. [5] 
 
Robert Pirsig [6] has also made the point that there 
always appears more than one workable hypothesis to 
explain a given phenomenon, and that the number of 
possible hypotheses appears unlimited. He has developed 
the idea that there are two types of thinking, the classical 
and the romantic. The classical way of thinking is 
characterised by analysing things into their component 
parts, whereas the romantic sees things as a whole. 
Classical thought would analyse an object like a 
motorbike into its physical components; nuts bolts etc. but 
you can also analyse the motor bike into its functional 
parts: heat exchanger, generator, exhaust system etc. 
Pirsig points out that each analysis is equally valid but 
produces different results. It depends on how you wield 
the knife of analysis to separate part from part. For 
example if you take a cylindrical chunk of clay you can 
cut it straight down and the product is circles, but if you 
decide to cut at an angle the result is ellipses, if you cut 
horizontally you obtain rectangles. The result of any 
analysis is also the product of what you decide to do and 
how you decide to cut, as much as it is a product of the 
artefact you are looking at. No analysis is unique. 
 
This directly affects the construction of ontologies as 
these are the results of detailed analysis of a subject area.  
Since different analyses lead to different ontologies and 
each may be equally valid, it has become necessary to 
agree on a convention as to what the structure of any 
given ontology may be and this agreement by subject 
experts is the method chosen to determine an agreed 
ontology. But, we contend here that agreement by 
convention on the structure of a subject ontology is not 
29

sufficient, as there are intrinsic differences between 
representations which cannot be reconciled because the 
subject domain is richer than any single ontology can 
capture. Different ontologies  result from the way the 
knife of analysis has been wielded as much as from the 
subject area itself.  
 
David Bohm in his book Wholeness and the Implicate 
Order [7] presents a critique of the fragmentation that 
classical thought has introduced into our description of the 
world. He says that it has always been necessary and 
appropriate to divide things up and separate them in order 
to reduce problems to manageable proportions but in so 
doing we lose sight of the whole. In dividing things up we 
make the mistake of thinking that the fragments we 
produce are a proper description of the world as it is. The 
problem is that there are many different ways of thinking 
about something and of categorising concepts and ideas. 
And no one way is better than another. He uses the field 
of quantum mechanics to illustrate this with its wave 
picture and particle picture of reality which are at the 
same time incompatible and indivisible. “All our different 
ways of thinking are to be considered as different ways of 
looking at the one reality” says Bohm. [7] Each view 
gives only one appearance of the object in some respect. 
“The whole object is not perceived in any one view but 
rather it is grasped only implicitly as that single reality 
which is shown in all these views.” [7] 
 
This has direct application to the way we use 
ontologies. These are constructed on the premise that in 
order to communicate about a particular subject domain 
unambiguously we need to have an agreed reference 
point, 
the 
ontology, 
which 
fixes 
precisely 
and 
unambiguously the component of the subject domain and 
its fixed relationships to other points. What Heidegger, 
Pirsig and Bohm are telling us is that this approach may 
be wrong from the outset and ultimately unachievable in 
the long term. A single ontology to describe the whole of 
reality is not something that exists. Rather many 
incompatible ontologies will exist that are equally valid 
descriptions of reality. And merely agreeing on one of 
them for the sake of convention will not enable a full 
picture of the reality to be represented. What is needed is 
a larger concept which contains all possible ontologies in 
a single undivided structure implicitly and from which 
they can be explicated. We can liken the new structure to 
a three dimensional object that casts different shadows 
depending on which way the light falls and each shadow 
represents the ontology while the object is the reality.   
II. A NEW APPROACH TO CONSTRUCTING ONTOLOGIES 
We propose to adopt a new approach to describing 
knowledge systems based on the idea that there is no one 
correct method of organising a subject domain in an 
ontology but rather there are many different ontology 
structures that adequately and correctly represent a body 
of knowledge. Each ontology gives only one appearance 
of the subject in some particular respect.  
 
C. Taxonomy, Ontology or Anthology? 
We will use a particular example throughout this paper 
in order to illustrate the extension to ontologies. However, 
it should be clear that the approach we employ is 
applicable to both ontologies and taxonomies. There is 
debate as to the precise relationship between ontologies 
and taxonomies while the the distinction between an 
ontology and a taxonomy is often blurred. [8]. We use 
here the distinction that a taxonomy is a hierarchical 
structure to classify information in a subject domain while 
an ontology is a hierarchical structure which in addition 
assigns and defines properties and relationships between 
concepts. An ontology is a richer structure than a 
taxonomy describing all aspects of the world and its parts 
[9]. Very simple ontologies would reduce down to a 
taxonomy in practice. Consequently whatever is true of a 
taxonomy is also true of an ontology, since an ontology is 
a taxonomy plus extra information, however the reverse is 
not the case.  
 
In addition to taxonomies and ontologies we include 
also anthologies [10] which are collections of information 
arranged in a hierarchical order. The following example 
may help to illustrate the difference. 
 
TAXONOMY: Cats 
Broader term: Pets  
Narrower term: tabby cat, black cat, kitten  
Related term: Dogs  
    
ONTOLOGY: Cats  
LivesIn: House  
Chases: Mice  
Eats: Fish, Rats 
Colours: Black, White, Ginger, Tabby 
 
ANTHOLOGY: Cats 
History of Cats 
 
Egyptian Cats [including information] 
 
Persian Cats [including information] 
How to Breed Cats 
 
Types of Breed [including information] 
Looking after Cats  
 
The anthology should be understood as also containing 
the information for each section along with the headings. 
The data in each section can take the form of text, as may 
be found in a textbook, or a media file, video presentation 
etc., where the content that is stored is useful for teaching 
or other purposes.  
 
Thus we see taxonomies as a subset of ontologies and 
ontologies as a subset of anthologies; see Fig. 1.

Our discussion of ontologies will apply also to 
taxonomies and anthologies as the extension is based on 
the network structure that is common to all. We will for 
the sake of this paper take as an example an anthology 
which is a collection of information such as may be seen 
in the contents page of a textbook which is organized in 
taxonomic form and contains subject knowledge of a 
richness which brings it into the definition of an ontology. 
The addition of information of the subject domain will 
further extend this to an anthology which contains content 
that is suitable for teaching. For the sake of convenience 
and familiarity we will refer to ontologies throughout the 
remainder of this paper but the reader should understand 
that our example and procedures are applicable to 
taxonomies, ontologies and anthologies equally.  
 
We will consequently seek to develop an approach to 
multi-ontologies and suggest a way in which they can be 
connected together in to a larger multi connected 
ontology. We will consider four stages in the 
systematization of any knowledge system.  
 
Stage 1  Introducing Order 
Stage 2  Introducing Coherence  
Stage 3  Introducing Proximity 
Stage 4  Introducing Co-Requisites and Pre-
Requisites 
 
These four stages will lead to a larger concept for 
ontologies that encompass the present understanding of 
ontologies as a subset. 
III. STAGE 1 INTRODUCING ORDER 
Ontologies specify the structure and relationships 
within a body of knowledge. Usually ontologies are 
represented as knowledge hierarchies with the most 
general concepts at the top and more detailed and specific 
concepts at lower levels. [11] Thus, a body of knowledge 
is divided into sections, sub-sections, sub-sub-sections etc.   
 
The structure of these knowledge hierarchies is 
naturally representable as networks, where each node on 
the network represents a unit of knowledge and where the 
relationship of each part to every other is determined and 
specified within the ontology. An ontology can be 
represented as a tree network where there is a maximum 
of one path between any two nodes. [12] [13] 
 
We 
may adopt an addressing system 
which 
corresponds to this knowledge hierarchy where each 
address is correspondingly specified by sections, sub-
sections, sub-sub-sections, etc.;  see Fig. 2 
 
The advantage of the simple tree model is that the 
number of hops from the root provides the level of the 
node. The disadvantage is that the structure does not 
contain the ordering of the concepts. 
 
However, because of the hierarchical nature of 
sections, subsection etc, the ontology has an implicit 
ordering. The structure of an ontology is built up from 
fragments of knowledge which have an order determined 
by their pre-requisites. Consequently, the simple tree 
depicted in Fig. 2 is not sufficient to model this structure 
as it lacks the necessary order. We use an ordered tree for 
this description where the branches from each node are 
ordered so that the sub-nodes have an order of preference. 
[14] 
 
Principle 1:  
Simple ontologies are to be represented 
mathematically as an ordered tree 
 
 
Figure 2: Knowledge hierarchy corresponding to an unordered tree 
 
The ordered tree network is distinguished by  
1. there is a maximum of one route from any node 
to any other node 
2. Branches from any given node have an implicit 
order. 
These two properties ensure that the ordered tree 
network has the necessary properties to represent simple 
knowledge categorisation and sub-categorisation within 
an ontology. This structure will also enable a wide variety 
of knowledge maps to be represented. [15] 
IV. STAGE 2 INTRODUCING COHERENCE  
We start with the recognition that no one ontology is 
the correct or the ultimate expression of a subject domain 
and accept that there are many different ontologies which 
all adequately represent the knowledge area from different 
points of view.  This is a significant departure from the 
present understanding of ontologies and we therefore 
present it as our next principle. 
 
Principle 2:  
The same structure can be analysed in 
different ways if it is complex enough

Figure 3: Knowledge hierarchy corresponding to an ordered tree 
 
We next recognise that all these different ontologies 
are ordered trees which mathematically can be combined 
into a more complex network containing each of them as a 
sub network. We therefore introduce a multi connected 
ontology represented by a mesh network containing multi-
connected pathways between nodes. This extends the 
model for the ontology from that of a tree to a mesh 
network.  
 
Using Bohm’s terminology we would say that the 
multi connected ontology is the implicate order while a 
particular decomposition ontology is the explicate order. 
[7] That means that starting from a larger mesh network 
we can generate an ordered tree by breaking certain 
connections 
in 
the 
complex 
structure 
effectively 
decomposing it into a simpler ordered tree. In this way the 
implicate order of the multi connected ontology becomes 
the explicate order of the simple ontology or the ordered 
tree. The breaking of different links in the multi connected 
ontology will produce a different ontology. [16] 
 
Principle 3:  
A multi connected ontology can be 
decomposed into at least one simple 
ordered tree  
 
Principle 4:  
Different 
decompositions 
produce 
different but equally valid ontologies 
 
In this way you can unloose or break certain 
connections in a full multi-connected network which will 
lead to one decomposition that produces a certain 
ontology, while another method of breaking connections 
will lead to another decomposition and a different 
ontology of the same reality.  
 
Links can be variable because different items of 
knowledge can be linked together in different ways. What 
doesn’t vary is the items of knowledge themselves. The 
content of the knowledge must remain invariant but one 
item can precede another or follow another depending on 
presentation and other factors. 
At a lower level each knowledge item or ontology 
node may be explained in many different ways. For 
instance binary arithmetic can be introduced in a variety 
of ways, but whichever way is chosen it is still teaching 
the same thing. That is because the content has not varied 
and the content is determined by the nodes. What is 
determined by the links is the presentation. Links within 
ontologies represent the way of explaining the knowledge 
or packaging the knowledge for student consumption or 
opening up the subject. All this information is contained 
in the links. One tutor may adopt a different approach to 
another by which we mean he will present the nodes in a 
different order. So each node has a different number of 
presentations but the content is the same. This is the basic 
difference between knowledge and education. Knowledge 
of a subject is the acquisition of a node but the node can 
be delivered in many different ways and the delivery is 
concerned with education. 
 
The same relation exists between teaching and 
learning. Learning is fixed on the acquisition of 
knowledge nodes, while teaching is involved in the 
arrangement of the knowledge nodes in a form the tutor 
presents them. Each tutor may be different and present the 
knowledge in a different way – yet they are all teaching 
the same knowledge. 
 
Each presentation may be different and based on 
different learning styles or learning needs. There may be 
different degrees of information required where the weak 
student needs a lot of information and the strong student 
needs very little. This will define the difference between 
weak and strong in the student model. 
 
Decompositions 
We can formally express decompositions using the 
adjacency matrix. Let Mij be the adjacency matrix of the 
multi-connected ontology and let Oij be the particular 
decomposition tree ontology. Then 
 
Xij Mij  =  Oij 
 
where Xij is the decomposition operator. In effect Xij 
takes the multi-connected Mij into a specific tree Oij which 
represents the structure and organisation of the knowledge 
as presented by a particular tutor for a particular student at 
a particular time with a particular level of subject 
knowledge. Xij is thus a function of all these parameters.  
 
Xij exists only if  Mij
-1 exists since: 
 
Xij Mij  Mij
-1  =  Oij Mij
-1  
 
             Xij  =  Oij Mij
-1   
 
Maximally connected networks (where all nodes are 
connected to all other nodes) have a simple adjacency 
matrix Kij in which every component is equal to 1 except 
for the diagonal components which are equal to 0.

Kij = 1 (for i ≠ j) and 
Kij  = 0 (for i = j)  
 
All Kij of dimension n have an inverse Kij
-1 which is 
given by  
 
Kij
-1 = 1/(n-1)            (for i ≠ j) and 
Kij
-1 = -(n-2)/(n-1)   (for i = j)  
 
The existence of the inverse means that every 
decomposable ontology can be generated from the 
maximally connected network. The inverse of Xij will be 
Xij
-1 which will restore the global multi-connected 
network from the specific tree 
 
Xij
-1  Xij Mij  =  Xij
-1  Oij 
             Mij  =  Xij
-1  Oij 
 
The existence of the inverse is important because it 
means that given a particular knowledge decomposition 
we can always get to any other knowledge decomposition 
via the multi-connected ontology. 
This may be clearer if we take a particular 
decomposition as an example. Consider the ten node 
network shown in Fig. 4. The multi connected ontology 
can be decomposed in a number of ways, three of which 
are illustrated. For clarification, we have numbered the ten 
nodes consecutively from 1 to 10 and the Adjacency 
matrix Mij is shown in Fig. 5

Figure 9: The adjacency matrix of decomposition 3 Oij(3) 
 
It follows from the preceding that not only can multi 
connected ontologies be decomposed into ‘instance 
ontologies’ as we may call a standard ontology but 
conversely a multi connected ontology can be constructed 
from instance ontologies and they can be combined into a 
mesh network. The converse of Principle 3 follows. 
 
Principle 5:   A multi connected ontology can be 
constructed 
from 
simple 
instance 
ontologies 
 
Thus the three ontologies in Fig. 4 can be constructed 
from the larger mesh network by the selection of the 
correct links. However, there must be the same nodes for 
this to work. 
 
Principle 6  
for two ontologies to be identical they 
must have identical nodes, though not 
necessary identical links 
 
It is quite easy to prove that any two trees of equal 
number of nodes but different links could be combined 
into a single multi-connected ontology. Consider the 
adjacency matrix of the two complementary trees, call 
them A and B, then it is always possible to form a new 
adjacency matrix C such that  
 
C   =   A       B 
 
where we have defined  as the operator which adds 
two matrix elements together according to the rule: 
 
Mij  Nij  =  1 (if Mij and/or Nij = 1) 
Mij  Nij  =  0 (if Mij and Nij = 0) 
 
This C will be representable as a new network, which 
is not a tree. 
 
Indeed we can go further and state that a full maximal 
multi-connected system of n nodes Kn where every node 
is connected to every other node can be decomposed into 
any tree structure of n nodes Tn and that all Tn are subsets 
of Kn 
 
Tn      Kn 
 
In general, every ontology could be decomposed from 
the maximal multi connected network. 
 
However, we need to be aware that some systems do 
not yield to this simple analysis as they are not based on 
different links but on different nodes. 
 
Principle 6 is the fundamental principle that puts a 
difference between what we are doing and what is being 
done elsewhere as the structure of an ontology is usually 
rigidly defined not only by its nodes but also by the fixed 
links that relate those nodes, so that if the links change 
then the ontology changes. In Principle 6, we are saying 
that this is not necessarily so, or that the two ontologies 
are equivalent, even though they may have different 
structures. However, the number of nodes must be the 
same in all cases as they represent knowledge elements 
and ontologies with different knowledge elements contain 
different knowledge areas. This is worth restating again. 
 
Two ontologies are the same if they have the same 
nodes but not necessarily the same links 
 
V. STAGE 3 INTRODUCING PROXIMITY 
There are many ways to arrange the nodes of a subject 
ontology. For instance, if we take the example of 
computing as a subject area, the knowledge nodes can be 
arranged in thematic order, logical order, functional order, 
historical order, geographical order etc. There is no end to 
the number of ways that knowledge nodes can be linked 
and presented, other than the mathematical limit of the 
total number of ways of arranging a finite number of 
nodes which is n!/2 since the number of ways of arranging 
n distinguishable objects is n! and we are treating reverse 
orders as the same arrangement for tree networks. 
 
One way of doing this is to make each of these 
decompositions dependent on a set of decomposition 
parameters which determines the ordering. To do this each 
subject node would need to be tagged with these meta-
subject parameters so that each node carries with it the 
information about its order in history or geography or 
function etc. However this is not needed if we use the 
decomposition operator Xij as all the information as to the 
structure 
will reside here. Thus, there 
will be 
decomposition operators which will represent the different 
structures. We could speak of a Historical decomposition 
Xij(H) or a geographical decomposition Xij(G) etc. We can 
generalise this to Xij(k) In reality there will be a maximum 
of n!/2 such possible decompositions for a subject area 
with n nodes.  
 
These decompositions are individually constructed (as 
are ontologies themselves) by individual subject experts 
who 
may 
be 
expected 
to 
provide 
their 
own 
decompositions very much as different experts would 
produce different books with different contents structures 
even though they were writing on the same subject as 
another  expert. Each expert arranges his material in his 
own way and in a way that suits him and his way of 
thinking and presenting information. [17] We may speak 
therefore of individual tutor or expert decompositions

Xij(Ek) corresponding to their understanding of how the 
subject information should be arranged and presented. 
Hence 
 
Xij(Ek) Mij  =  Oij(Ek) 
 
where Oij(Ek) is the ontology produced by Expert Ek 
 
A full determination of  Ek will require a tutor model 
with a full set of identified parameters. Similarly there 
will be a preferred decomposition for a particular student 
S who will have his own level of pre-existing knowledge, 
speed of acquisition of new knowledge etc. The full 
determination of this will require a student model with a 
full set of defined parameters. The full details of the tutor 
model, student model and other models will be dealt with 
in a separate paper. 
 
The consequence of moving from a tree to a mesh 
network is that we now have more than one route between 
any two nodes. Hence within the multi connected 
ontology Mij  there are multiple routes between nodes and 
not all paths will be equal. Some paths will be very 
common and chosen by a majority of experts. Some paths 
may be much rarer and chose by perhaps only one expert. 
The accumulated frequency of choice may be interpreted 
as a probability value which indicates the likelihood of 
one node being linked to another by the creators of the 
separate ontologies for each decomposable ontology 
created by an individual expert or tutor.  
 
Consequently, some subject nodes will have a higher 
probably of transition within the domain than other 
subject nodes and can be thought of as being ‘closer’ to 
each other for that reason. If there is more than one route 
away from a subject node then each pathway will be 
weighted according to the probability that an expert may 
move from one to another. We will model this by 
introducing probabilities into the adjacency matrix by 
replacing the 1s with probability values between 0 and 1 
where 0 indicates no probability of a transition between 
two nodes and 1 indicates a 100% probability which 
means that one node must lead to another.  
 
In this way, the adjacency matrix from Fig. 5 would be 
transformed, by way of illustration, to Fig. 10.

salesman type problem. 
VI. STAGE 4 INTRODUCING CO-REQUISITES AND PRE-
REQUISITES  
 
Pre-requisite knowledge domains indicate that one 
area of subject knowledge must be taught prior to another. 
This is a consequence of knowledge building on previous 
knowledge [18]. Therefore, within our model a 
mechanism is required to show which subject knowledge 
nodes are prior to other nodes. [19] [20] Pre-requisites 
mean that one subject node must come before another.

Figure 11: Directed Probability Adjacency Matrix 
 
The concept of pre-requisites introduces the notion of 
direction into the ontology network. Directed networks 
only allow one route between two knowledge nodes and 
are usually represented by arrows. To represent this in our 
adjacency matrix we will introduce asymmetry into the 
adjacency matrix to show that connections are just one 
way. In this way, the adjacency matrix from Fig. 5 would 
be transformed, by way of illustration to Fig. 11 and the 
consequent directed network is shown in Fig. 12.

VII. CONCLUSION 
 
We have extended the concept of ontology to include 
multiple representations of a knowledge domain. The full 
representation requires an ordered multi-connected

network 
described 
by 
an 
asymmetric 
probability 
adjacency matrix 
 
The ideas presented here provide the underpinning 
structure for combining all possible ontologies into a 
single multi-connected ontology of directed probabilistic 
networks. This solves the problem of  how to choose 
between competing ontologies which have been proposed 
in any given subject domain. There is now no need to 
choose between competing candidate ontologies but 
instead all can be embraced in a single structure. 
 
We liken this to the analogy of many textbooks written 
on a single subject. Different authors have different 
approaches to a subject and consequently structure the 
knowledge and its presentation in different ways which 
seem suitable to them. Consequently a look at half a 
dozen different textbooks on any subject will show half a 
dozen different structures to the knowledge as illustrated 
by the different contents pages. No two will be alike and 
yet they will be covering the same subject area.  
 
Does this mean that one is right and all the others are 
wrong? Not at all. We recognized that there are different 
and equally valid ways of organizing and presenting 
knowledge. And consequently there are different ways of 
organizing and presenting an ontology for a given subject. 
The problem has always been which ontology should be 
adopted. The standard approach is to agree on one or 
decide by international committee. However this does not 
stop arguments raging as to which should gain universal 
acceptance. These arguments will never be settled 
satisfactory as settling them is merely a matter of 
convention. However by adopting the multi-connected 
ontology approach we may combine all structures into a 
single complex network of which the individual 
ontologies are mere projections.  
 
We contend that this multi-connected ontology has 
greater claim to being a true representation of the 
knowledge domain than any individual ontology as it 
captures all these structures without giving undue 
prominence to any individual part or favour to any one 
view. As Goethe says, “Only everybody knows the Truth.”
