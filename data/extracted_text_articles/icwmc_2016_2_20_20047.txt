Abstract— In this work, we focus our attention on 
dispersion characteristics of Transverse Electric (TE) and 
Transverse Magnetic (TM) surface modes, leaky modes and 
volume modes of double-positive grounded slab. We have 
analyzed the dispersion using the Transverse Resonance 
Method (TRM). The simple method represents the boundary 
conditions of the grounded slab by an equivalent circuit. It 
reveals that this structure, though it contains several types, 
just the ordinary type exists for surface modes and just the 
improper type exists for leaky modes. Numerical results 
illustrate the properties and the existence conditions for these 
modes. 
Keywords— Grounded SLAB; surface modes; volume 
modes; leaky modes; Transverse Resonance Method.

 INTRODUCTION  
A few years ago, the miniaturization of antennas leads to 
the appearance of new modes which are the surface modes. 
These modes have received considerable attention in the 
scientific community. Surface modes are used in different 
fields for many applications,  such as  the surface Radar [1], 
the surface wave filters [2], the surface plasmons for 
biodetection[3] as well as the seismic imaging with surface 
wave [2]. In electromagnetic, these modes can approach the 
antenna elements and this rapprochement generates the 
coupling phenomenon. Therefore, they provide a new way 
to miniaturization [4]. Surface modes exist at a 
discontinuity interface between two different mediums. At 
this interface, leaky modes can also exist. Usually, leaky 
modes are excited when perturbing a surface mode or a 
guided mode propagating in an open waveguide with proper 
periodic corrugations or modifications [5]. These Leaky 
modes propagate faster than the speed of the light and, at 
the same time, they leak  energy along the interface. Leaky 
modes are used for applications in the millimeter-wave 
ranges.  
Based on the modal analysis for double-positive 
grounded slab, the present authors have revealed that only 
surface and leaky modes can exist for TE and TM 
polarization [6][7],but they did not demonstrated the 
existence of volume mode which is identified as the 
magnetostatic wave. Volume mode is characterized by the 
limited field to structure and  no energy is lost from it.  
In this work, we investigate the propagation of real 
modes (i.e., surface, volume) [8][9] and complex modes 
(i.e., leaky) [5][10] supported by a slab placed on a 
perfectly conducting ground plane (grounded slab). In 
Section 2, we will present the other existing works and we 
will compare them with our work. In Section 3, we will 
analyse the dispersion characteristics of TE and TM modes 
based on a general method called the Tranverse Resonance 
Method (TRM) [11][12]. In Section 4, we will discuss the 
results obtained from the MATLAB simulations. In Section 
5, we will conclude this paper. 
II. 
STATE OF THE ART 
In 2003, Paolo Baccarelli has worked on the propagation 
of surface waves in a particular structure double-negative 
metamaterial grounded slab [8]. In 2004, the same author 
has presented the dispersion and radiation properties of 
leaky waves on the same structure [7]. He has demonstrated 
that leaky waves of only the proper type exist in double-
negative grounded slab, while proper or improper leaky 
waves exist in single negative grounded slab. Paolo 
Baccarelli has investigated in his work only the dispersion 
of surface and leaky modes on single- and double-negative 
grounded slabs.  
Our work focuses on the dispersion of surface, volume 
and leaky modes in double-positive grounded slab. In 
literature, there are many techniques through which we can 
realize this analysis such as the analytical technique dyadic 
Green’s function [13][14] which can be estimated to 
complex forms depending on how the material is described 
macroscopically. Another technique is postulating fields on 
one side of the discontinuity and using Snel’s law of 
reflection and refraction [15]. In our study, we use The 
TRM. This approach allows deriving the dispersion 
properties of real and complex modes for open structure in a 
simple way. It is also useful to describe the open structure 
with an equivalent circuit parameters as admittance or 
reflection coefficient. This circuit model permits to find in a 
simple way the dispersion equation for the two polarizations 
TE and TM. The resolution of these two equations permits

conditions.

ANALYSIS  
Let us consider a grounded slab characterized by a 
lossless dielectric medium of height d and relative 
constitutive parameters 
r and
r
0
   . It is infinite along 
the two directions x and z, as shown in Fig.1. 
 
Figure 1. Schematic illustration of infinity grounded slab. The dielectric 
slab is characterized by a relative permittivity 
r  and permeability 
r
 . 
Taking into consideration the assumption that no 
variation along the x direction and that the electromagnetic 
field depends on time and the longitudinal coordinate 
as
z
ej( t k z)

, the real and complex modes can be separated 
into two polarizations TE modes with

TM modes with

. The field related to such 
structure can be travel in an equivalent transmission line 
model illustrated in Fig. 2. This model describes the 
transverse discontinuity with equivalent network parameters 
to simplify the resolution of the Maxwell equations using 
the TRM.   
 
Figure 2. Equivalent circuit used to illustrate the transverse Resonance 
Method. 
The symbolic representation of the two homogeneous 
media (air, dielectric) separated by the discontinuity plan 
(xoz)  is given by two equivalent admittances 
1
Y and
2
Y . 
The equivalent admittance 
2
z
0
Y (k ,k ) of the dielectric slab 
is a function of the transverse propagation constant 
z
k  and 
the free space propagation constant
0
k . Consequently, it is 
then possible to find the dispersion equation by using the 
univalent circuit. The variable j , which is a virtual current 
source, is zero at the discontinuity plan. It is equivalent to 
an open circuit. E is a dual grader [14]. 
According to Kirchhoff’s current and Ohm’s law, we 
deduce :

In a conventional dielectric (
r  0
), the leaky mode is 
improper modes. But in a dielectric of a negative 
permittivity, the leaky mode is proper mode [4]. As a 
conclusion, in the studied structure only complex improper 
modes may exist, while complex proper modes are 
forbidden. 
 
In case TE polarization, the dispersion equation can be 
written as:

When we increase the height d and the dielectric 
permittivity

this structure increases for both polarizations. This number 
is equal to n+1 with n as a natural number satisfying the

In TE polarization, surface modes cannot exist below

One of the dispersion characteristics of grounded slab is 
that the cutoff of the principal mode TM 0 of surface mode 
does exist, as shown in Fig. 5. But, in case  
1
r
 
, the  
TM 0surface modes cutoff is suppressed. 
The cutoff frequency of each guided modes of higher-order 
is also shown in Fig. 5 for TM and TE polarizations. The 
cutoff frequency  is the lowest frequency of guided 
propagation at which 
0
z 
K

 [18]. For higher-order 
modes, when the frequency is increased, the propagation 
constant approaches to 
0
r
K
 but it cannot exceed this 
value (
0
r
K
 ). This limit is the upper limit of ordinary 
surface modes, whereas, the lower limit is k0. This means 
that the ordinary surface modes are slow. When the relative 
permittivity of slab is increased, the propagation constant 
decreases and the lost power is confined near the slab 
region. 
 
In Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, the graphic location of the second 
kind of real modes, i.e., volume mode are represented in 
TM and TE. Volume mode is represented by a red cross 
which is the intersection of two curves. The first curve 
represents the tangent function for TM polarization and 
cotangent for TE polarization while the second curve 
represents the hyperbola function.

We can see that when we increase the height d of the 
structure, the number of the volume mode decreases for the 
two polarizations, and the principal mode TM0 can be 
suppressed. This number equal to m-1, when m is a natural 
number satisfying the relation

space (i.e., 
z
  K0
). Thus, the volume mode for both 
polarizations exists in the grounded slab structure. The 
representation of Fig. 8 shows that the dispersion curve of 
first mode of higher-order TM1 tends, on the one hand, 
towards the fundamental mode TM0 in low frequencies, and 
disappears, on the other hand, when the frequency 
2.1
f
GHz

. The dispersion curve of the third mode of 
higher-order TM3 tends toward that of the principal mode 
TM0 of volume mode in high frequencies. In polarization 
TE, there is no fundamental mode. The mode of higher-
order TE2 appears at the same frequency of TE3 where f= 
4.89GHz and disappears at the same frequency of TE1 
where f=5.18GHz. 
  
In grounded slab with positive permittivity and 
permeability, just one type of the complex mode exists, 
which is the improper mode [7]. The dispersion 
characteristics of these modes are represented in Fig. 9. The 
dielectric slab is characterized by height d=1.5cm,

We can see that leaky modes exist in the grounded slab 
when
z
  K0
. When the frequency is lower than the first 
cutoff frequency of the surface mode

, all 
complex modes exist with very high normalized 
z
  and 
z
 . 
When the frequency increases, the normalized real constants 
(0,0) decrease rapidly within a very narrow frequency 
range and remain constant at
r
.  However, the 
normalized attenuation constants 
z k0
increase rapidly 
and remain constant at zero. Leaky mode is characterized by 
an order mode n. The minimum of n for  leaky mode must be 
equal to the  maximum of this order mode  for surface mode 
[4].

CONCLUSIONS 
In 
this 
paper, 
we 
investigate 
the 
dispersion 
characteristics and existence conditions of real and complex  
TE and TM modes. These modes are separated by the 
nature of the propagation constant. Surface mode is 
characterized by

and leaky mode is 
characterized by

. We observe that only the 
improper type of the leaky mode and only ordinary type of 
the surface mode occur in the double-positive grounded 
slab. The analysis are achieved by a simple method which is 
the TRM.
