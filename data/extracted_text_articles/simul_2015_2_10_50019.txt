Abstract—The author’s original model for travel time of metro 
trains is presented in this paper. The presented model is 
assumed to be an instrument for estimation of reliable travel 
times of metro trains in macro simulation models of whole 
transport networks. These kinds of models are used to evaluate 
the effects of the possible implementation of major transport 
investments in cities. The quality of the network model can 
significantly affect the results of analyses, and even the 
selection of optimal solutions. Travel time is the basis for every 
transport network model, not only for the current state, but 
also for the future. This is particularly important in the case of 
planned sections, where one cannot use measurement results. 
Partial models of metro average running times and random 
components of running time, depending on the length of 
sections, were created on the basis of the results of 
measurements carried out for the first metro line in Warsaw. 
Also, the dwell time at stations is included into the model based 
on the results of measurements made for three separate station 
types, diversified on the basis of average stopping times and 
location of the station in relation to the inner city centre. The 
paper includes examples of practical model application: 
evaluation of the influence of increasing the allowable speed, 
and densification of the stations on travel time and also the 
impact of the accuracy of the travel time model on simulation 
results of passenger flows.

 INTRODUCTION 
The metro is commonly perceived as one of the best 
urban transport systems, as it enables fast transportation of 
passengers. Its utility increases appropriately to the distance 
of a trip. This is the effect of consequent separation of the 
entire track, and long distances between stations, which 
allows high speed train, up to 60 [km/h] or more. This results 
in high transportation speeds (compared and summarised by 
Feng at al. [6]), of around 35-40 [km/h]. The metro is also 
associated with a large transport capacity [13] [17], as well 
as high operational reliability [3]. However, high speed does 
not go hand in hand with accessibility. Long distances 
between stations lead to long walking distances to find a 
station. These issues have been discussed by García-
Palomares at al. [7]. For this reason, a metro does not  
perform well in high density areas. Significant investment 
and operating costs are another downside of the metro.  
The aforementioned pros and cons create the necessity to 
perform a thorough analysis of costs and benefits before the 
potential introduction or expansion of a metro system. 
Discussions as to, whether it is legitimate to build (or extend) 
a metro line are usually a consequence of the insufficient 
utility of existing systems of urban public transport. Very 
often, this is a common effect of a lack of determination and 
a consequence of giving priority to over-ground means of 
public transport. Arguments used in these discussions are 
very different, but always one of them is high travel speed of 
metro trains.  
Discrepancies between expected and possible travel 
times, appear as early as during the planning stage. 
Meanwhile, travel time has a crucial influence on modal 
split, especially considering rail and tramway systems that 
are able to transport the greatest passenger volumes. Even 
slight differences in travel time may have a considerable 
influence on increased or decreased passenger volumes, not 
only on the metro line itself, but also on other lines of public 
transport. These differences also result in changes in car 
volumes.  
Therefore, travel time is an obligatory element of a four-
stages procedure (described, among others, by Hensher [9]), 
commonly used in the planning of transportation systems. 
Reliable estimation of transportation speed for individual 
variants of metro line routes is obligatory for a determination 
of potential effects of differentiated variants of transport 
investments. Only such an approach allows a reliable 
determination of outcomes of serious transport investments. 
To provide a fully reliable basis for the potential 
construction of a metro line, it is necessary to describe 
processes of train movement in greater detail. It is thus 
essential to possess precise knowledge of both current and 
achievable realistic running times and times spent by trains 
at the stations. 
This paper presents a general travel time model for a 
metro line that may be used for planning such investments in 
various cities. The main purpose of the analysis was to 
recognise the mechanism of changes in travel time of metro 
trains and to build a model that would serve to estimate the 
length and variability of travel time. Section 2 presents a 
general model of travel time for a metro line, whilst in 
Section 3 there is a description of measurement’ results from 
the first metro line in Warsaw. Sections 4 and 5 explain the 
results of estimations of running time and dwell time at the

stations. In Section 7, examples of possible simulation results 
are shown. Finally, Section 8 presents the conclusion of the 
paper. 
II. 
GENERAL MODEL OF TRAVEL TIME FOR A METRO LINE 
A. Structure of the model of travel time for a metro line 
The graph theory [8] allows the assumption that 
consecutive stations are vertices of a directed graph and the 
sections between the stations are directed edges. From the 
point of view of a general structure, the model of travel time 
for a metro line will not differ from travel time models for 
other means of transport, e.g., trams or buses, described for 
instance by Vuchic [12] and Bauer [2].  
However, there are certain differences at the stage of 
modelling events specific to a metro line. In models of bus or 
tram lines, the registered events are: arrivals and departures 
at stops, moments of starting and ending the process of 
passenger alighting and boarding, as well as the moments of 
standstill at any given point within the network, such as 
crossroads or pedestrian crossings. In a model of a metro 
line, the number of occurrences may be significantly limited 
[4]. The fully separated route of a metro line and the full (or 
at least very advanced) automation of train rides decrease the 
need to consider any events between stations. Of course, 
such events may happen (mostly for security and safety 
reasons), but they are relatively rare. In turn, automated 
processes of simultaneous opening or closing of train doors 
question the division of the dwell time into separated 
processes (alighting and boarding, time of waiting for 
possibility to departure). As a result, only two types of events 
on the line have been accounted for in the presented model: 
 
the moment when a train is brought to a halt upon 
arrival in a station (defined as the moment of starting 
of opening the door); 
 
the moment when the train leaves the station (the 
same as moment of starting of closing the door). 
Thus, it may be acknowledged that the structure of the 
travel time model for a metro line will comprise a group of 
modules: section between stations - station at the end of 
section. Only two processes of movement will be considered: 
 
running time – counted from the moment of 
departure from a station until arrival at the next 
station; 
 
dwell time – time spent at a station, counted from the 
moment of arrival to the moment of departure. 
The analysis omitted time spent at the first and last 
station, as these do not have any direct influence on train 
travel time and the duration of passengers’ trips. 
B. Mathematic structure of the model of travel time for a 
metro line 
The mathematical structure of the proposed model 
strictly corresponds to its approved general structure. In 
general, travel time for trains within a metro line is the sum 
of travel times for sections between stations and the time 
spent at the stations [1]:

where:  
T – travel time for the whole metro line (one direction) [s]; 
tr,m – running time for an individual section between stations 
(vm-1, vm) [s]; 
ts,m – dwell time - time spent during a halt in a station m [s]. 
According to the deterministic approach currently used to 
solve most practical problems, average travel time for a line 
may be presented as the sum of average values of travel time 
and dwell time:

However, in more detailed analyses it is desirable not 
only to decrease average travel time, but also to decrease 
dispersion of travel times for a line. This justifies the 
consideration of additional random components of running 
time and dwell time. It is thus reasonable to expand the 
formula (1) by random components, as presented:

The ability to estimate travel time dispersion increases 
the quality of the model and spreads the scope of its uses 
such a model can also be used in dynamic modelling. Taking 
well-adjusted random components of the model, one can 
calculate the influence of travel time variability on passenger 
volumes. 
III. 
FIRST LINE OF THE WARSAW METRO 
A. Description of the metro line 
Estimation of travel times for sections between stations 
and dwell time at the stations were based on results of 
automatic traffic measurements on the first metro line in 
Warsaw. The line is 21.648 [km] long (one direction) with 
21 train stations. Distances between stations [18] vary from 
0.577 to 1.534 [km], with an average distance of 1.082 [km]. 
The line constitutes a vital element of the track-based urban 
transportation system of Warsaw. For this reason, it has been 
decided to build a second metro line in the East – West 
direction [16]. 
According to [15], an estimated 147.2 million passengers 
used the Warsaw metro in 2013. Metro trains covered a total 
of 23.8 thousand [train-km] during this period. 
B. Transportation speed 
The calculations used measurement results made 
available by the Public Transport Authority for Warsaw. The 
results are from two average working days (19.11.2013 and 
16.01.2014, when no serious traffic disturbances were 
observed). The analysis encompassed 581 train journeys (in 
25

the direction “Kabaty” – “Młociny”) and 591 train journeys 
(in the direction: “Młociny” – “Kabaty”) that occurred 
between 4 AM and 12 PM. Even though the results used 
concerned 2 days only, they have been acknowledged as 
being representative for an average working day on the 
Warsaw metro. Transportation speeds on the first metro line 
are considerably high, with a daily average of 35.9 [km/h] 
(direction: “Kabaty” – “Młociny”) and 35.4 [km/h] 
(direction: “Młociny” – “Kabaty”). This does not mean that 
the transportation speeds are fixed. On the contrary, 
differences between speeds in the following hours of the 
analysis may be significant, as illustrated in Figure 1. 
 
Figure 1.  Variability of transportation speeds on the first metro line 
(direction: Młociny - Kabaty) within the hours of the line operation. 
This figure shows the scale of standard errors connected 
with estimation of average transport speeds. In travel time 
modelling, it is vital to reproduce traffic conditions within a 
given time of day. Dispersion of transportation speeds occurs 
even on metro lines. Thus, it has been suggested to divide a 
working day into six time periods, differing mostly in term 
of current train frequency in the first metro line in Warsaw: 
 
early morning – train departures within the hours: 
04:00 AM - 5:59 AM, estimated scheduled interval 
on the line: 4-7 [min]; 
 
morning – departures: 6:00 AM - 8:59 AM, interval: 
3 [min]; 
 
late morning and early afternoon – departures: 
9:00 AM - 02:59 AM, interval: 4 [min]; 
 
afternoon – departures: 03:00 PM - 06:59 PM, 
interval: 3 [min]; 
 
early evening – departures: 07:00 PM - 08:59 PM, 
interval: 4-7 [min]; 
 
evening – departures: 09:00 PM - 11:59 PM, 
interval: 9-10 [min]. 
Usually, models of transport networks are built for the 
morning or afternoon peak hours, when most journeys 
happen. On the first metro line, average travel time during 
the afternoon peak is 37.5 [min] (difference between average 
travel times in both directions is only 3 [s]). This means that 
during this period, transportation speed equals 34.7 [km/h]. 
Models for other time periods can also be created. It is 
most important to adjust the model of travel time on the 
metro line to the models of travel time of other means of 
transport, so as to ensure realistic effects in terms of 
passenger flow between the various means of transport. That 
is why the aforementioned division of the working day into 
time periods has been proposed. Relatively speaking, the 
highest values of average transportation speed were reached 
within the hours between peaks, in early evening and 
evening hours - above 36 [km/h]. Lowest average 
transportation speeds were reached during single hours of the 
morning peak, between 08:00 AM and 09:00 AM and from 
09:00 AM to 10:00 AM (direction: “Młociny” – “Kabaty”) 
and the afternoon peak, from 05:00 PM to 06:00 PM (second 
direction). Within the aforementioned hours, average 
transport speeds fluctuated around 33 [km/h].  
Variability of transportation speeds within a single hour 
was highest in the morning and evening periods. This may be 
caused by the lower number of train courses and greater size 
diversification of passenger flow. The results confirm the 
fact that, despite the total separation of the metro system 
from other means of transport within the traffic system, 
variability in transportation speeds occurs and it is 
worthwhile considering the reasons for this. 
C. Travel time structure of the first metro line 
The search for the reasons for dispersed travel times of 
metro trains began with a division into running times 
between stations and dwell times. This allowed the 
determination of which element of the metro line was more 
susceptible to disturbances. The ratio of the total sum of 
running times to whole travel time is 67.5 [%] (direction: 
“Kabaty” – “Młociny”) and 68.3 [%] (“Młociny” – 
“Kabaty”). This means that an average of 1/3 total travel 
time for the entire line is spent at stations. This ratio changes 
from 67.5 [%] in the afternoon (direction: “Kabaty – 
Młociny”) up to as much as 72.8 [%] in the evening 
(“Młociny – Kabaty”).  
D. Comparison of changes in time of ride between stations 
and time spent during halts in the stations 
The longest travel times for the metro line have been 
observed in the morning and afternoon periods. In general, 
slightly greater differences have been observed in the 
direction “Młociny” – “Kabaty”, as average travel time in the 
early evening is 3.0 [min] shorter than the corresponding 
time in the morning (Figure 2).  
 
Figure 2.  Variability of totall travel time divided into running time 
between stations and dwell time (direction: “Młociny” – “Kabaty”).

In the other direction, the difference is 2.7 [min] – 
between the early evening period, when travel time is 
shortest, and the afternoon period of the day. It may also be 
observed, that differences in running times are significantly 
smaller than differences between dwell times. This fact will 
be taken into account during model component estimation. 
IV. 
ESTIMATION OF TRAVEL TIME FOR A SECTION 
BETWEEN STATIONS 
A. Average running time 
Running time between stations - in the case of a metro 
system - is affected by considerably fewer factors than in the 
case of over-ground systems of urban public transport. Stop-
to-stop sections on the metro line are fully separated, the 
most crucial factor affecting the travel time is section length. 
Far less important are geometrical factors such as horizontal 
curves or longitudinal grades. Possible travel time 
disturbances usually result from the necessity to counteract 
atypical situations. For example, longer dwell time of 
preceding train leads to slowing down or even stopping the 
upcoming trains between the stations. Differences in running 
time can also be caused by dispatching tactics, especially in 
the case of a high frequency of trains. These influences were 
described by Yang at al.  [14] and also by O. Yalçınkaya and 
G.M. Bayhan [13]. Important is also the condition of a track 
system and the kind of power system. 
First, the estimation of the average running time for a 
section between stations was carried out. The aim was to 
check how the length of a section influences the running time 
and, if a satisfactory model was not obtained, other factors 
were taken into consideration. The metro has an automatic 
system control, so a physical model, based on calculations of 
acceleration and deceleration times and running time with 
constant speed, can be used:

where:

L – length of a section between stations [km]; 
vmax – maximum speed on the section [m/s]; 
a – average acceleration rate[m/s2]; 
b – average deceleration rate[m/s2]. 
 
After preliminary application of the model, it transpired 
that the differences between the measurement results and the 
calculated results were relatively large - a total of nearly one 
minute in one direction. Therefore, a statistical, regression 
model was sought, which would give a better fit to the 
measurement results and, additionally, be more versatile and 
able to take into account random influences. For this reason, 
the linear and non-linear regression methods were used.  
In the case of four out of the six periods of a working 
day, the best adjustment of the model of average running 
time to the results of measurements carried out for the first 
metro line in Warsaw was obtained through the use of the 
double-squared model:

where:

L – length of a section between stations [km]; 
β0, β1 – simple regression parameters [-]. 
 
In the two remaining cases, other models offered a 
slightly better fit (1-2 [%] higher values of determination 
coefficients). Eventually, it was decided to use the double-
squared model for all the periods of a day. Figure 3 shows 
the effects of fitting the model to the measurement results. 
 
Figure 3.  Models of average running time dependent on section length, 
for acknowledged periods of a working day. 
Comparing models for particular periods of a working 
day, it may be noticed that there are only slight differences in 
the obtained average travel times. For example, for a section 
of 0.7 [km] the maximum difference equals just 3 [s] – 
running time in the morning equals 49 [s], while around 
noon, in the afternoon and in the early evening it amounts to 
52 [s]. For a section of 1.5 [km], average running times differ 
by 6 [s] – from 101 [s] in the evening to 107 [s], early in the 
morning. Such a small variability of average running times 
encouraged the search for a single universal formula for the 
whole working day. This has the following form:



This dependence is characterised by a high value for the 
determination coefficient, amounting to 98 [%]. This means 
that the length of a section between stations can be 
considered as the only crucial factor influencing the average 
travel time on this section, regardless of the period of the 
working day. It also means that the frequency of train runs 
even as high as 20 trains per hour does not influence the 
average travel time on the section.  
This model of average running time can be easily used 
during the construction or actualisation of the Warsaw 
simulation transportation model. With a couple of additional 
27

assumptions, it can also be useful in the transportation 
models of other Polish cities, where maximum running speed 
of trains will be 60 [km/h]. 
Conversion factors that may be applicable in the case of 
modelling higher maximum running speeds were also 
calculated. It was established that only the section length on 
the metro line has a crucial meaning for running speed. In 
this calculation (because of a lack of data), physical 
dependences were used. Maximum running speeds of 70, 80 
and 90 [km/h] were taken into consideration. In all three 
cases, one can use the regression formula:

B. Random component of running time 
In the case of micro-simulation models, there is a 
possibility of considering the randomness of travel time. 
Then, it becomes necessary to generate random travel time 
coefficients for particular sections. These can be simulated 
by a random number generator from normal distribution with 
mean zero and standard deviation specified on the basis of 
measurement results (in [s]):

Values for standard deviations of the running time can be 
determined as a function of a section’s length. The best fit of

Initially, partial models were constructed for all of the six 
periods of a working day (Figure 4).  
 
 
Figure 4.  Models of standard deviation of running time dependent on 
section length, for acknowledged periods of a working day. 
However, standard deviations of running time, obtained 
thanks to the models, differ very little from one another. For 
sections of lengths up to 1.2 [km], the difference amounts to 
a maximum of 1 [s], while in the case of a section of 1.6 
[km] – only 4 [s]. This is why only one formula was chosen, 
and this describes the relation between the standard deviation 
of a running time and the section’s length. The formula is 
representative for a whole working day:

The model above is not characterised by a high value for 
the determination coefficient, as it is in the case of the model 
for the average value – R2 amounts to only 48 [%]. However, 
taking into consideration the fact that in the case of the first 
Warsaw metro line the standard deviations are an order of 
magnitude smaller than average values – the model can be 
considered satisfactory, thus it can be recommended to be 
used in micro-simulation analyses. 
V. 
ESTIMATION OF DWELL TIME OF A METRO TRAIN 
A. Average dwell time 
The dwell time has a more individualised character. It 
depends mainly on the size of flow of alighting and boarding 
passengers, and on the number of passengers already 
travelling on a train arriving at a station. In the case of new 
investments, the flows are determined at the stage of network 
planning. It is necessary to determine preliminary dwell 
times, which may be later verified by an iterative procedure. 
Since at the stage of carrying out the analyses, reliable sizes 
of passenger flows for the first line of Warsaw metro were 
not available, it was decided to differentiate the stations on 
the basis of the average dwell time. Interestingly, the 
dependence between the length of dwell time and the 
location of the station relative to the inner centre of the city 
was observed. On this basis, 3 types of stations were defined: 
 
Type A – stations located in the inner city centre (in 
the case of the first line of the Warsaw metro – four 
28

stations in both directions: “Ratusz Arsenał”, 
“Świętokrzyska”, “Centrum” and “Politechnika”); 
 
Type B – stations located within the urban area 
(“Plac 
Wilsona”, 
“Dworzec 
Gdański”, 
“Pole 
Mokotowskie”, “Racławicka”, “Wierzbno” and 
Wilanowska); 
 
Type C – stations located in the remaining areas of 
the city (remaining stations on the first metro line). 
Table II shows the breakdown of average values of dwell 
times at station types A, B and C.

It can be seen that the values of average dwell time vary 
significantly during the day. This variability should be taken 
into account in macro-simulation models performed for peak 
periods. In a more specific approach, average dwell time can 
also be estimated more precisely as a function of numbers of 
alighting and boarding passengers – if this kind of data is 
available. 
B. Random component of dwell time 
Dwell time generally has a Normal distribution, which is 
confirmed by the Chi-square statistical test. Therefore, the 
random components of dwell times (in seconds) can be 
determined from the Normal distribution of zero mean value:

A much greater diversity of standard deviations for dwell 
time can be seen than in the case of running time. This is due 
to the fact that the number of alighting and boarding 
passengers is very random. 
VI. 
EXAMPLES OF THE MODEL IMPLEMENTATION 
A. Considered scenarios 
Implementation of the metro line travel time model has 
been shown on the basis of the analysis of possibility of 
densification of Warsaw’s first metro line stations and led to 
the announcement of raising the maximum speed to 80 
[km/h]. The first one is associated with a lengthening of 
running time, the second with its shortening. The following 
scenarios are considered: 
 
Scenario S0: existing state of first metro line; 
 
Scenario S1: two additional metro stations (both 
directions): station “Plac Konstytucji” (Type A, 
between existing stations: “Politechnika” and 
“Centrum”) and station “Muranów” (Type B, 
between stations: “Ratusz Arsenał” and “Dworzec 
Gdański”) and changing the type of the station 
“Ratusz Arsenał” from A to B; 
 
Scenario S2: increasing the maximum speed of 
trains from 60 to 80 [km/h]; 
 
Scenario S3: two additional metro stations: “Plac 
Konstytucji” (Type A) and “Muranów” (Type B), 
changing the type of the station “Ratusz Arsenał” 
from A to B, and additionally increasing the 
maximum speed of trains from 60 to 80 [km/h]. 
In this calculation, only average metro trains travel times 
in afternoon period were calculated. Additionally, it was 
stated that passengers streams were constant, and dwell times 
would be the same. An extended analysis should take into 
account the influence of growth of passenger streams 
because of station densification in the city centre and growth 
of running speeds on the sections. 
B. Comparison of travel times 
The model was positively verified. In both directions, 
there are only 12 [s] differences between total travel time 
from the model and from the measurements. This means that 
the model can be used to calculate the effect of increasing 
the running speed and implementation of new stations. 
The final results of the calculations of travel times are 
presented in Table IV. Introduction of two additional stations 
will result in lengthening of the average travel time by 1.4 
[min], which will lead to a decrease in the average 
transportation speed from 34.9 to 33.5 [km/h]. However, 
increasing the running speed from 60 to 80 [km/h] can 
compensate for this inconvenience. After scenario S3 
implementation, total travel time decreases to 35.2 [min] in 
comparison to the current state, which is a very satisfying 
value. More precise effects can be specified thanks to the 
iteration procedure (macro-simulation analysis), where the 
above values should be used as initial values. Only a multi-
criteria analysis will allow full assessment of the options, 
e.g., via the method described by Nosal and Solecka [10].

C. The effects of travel time model in the simulation of the 
entire transport network of Warsaw 
Comparisons were made for passenger flows for the 
scenario S3 using the simulation model of the Warsaw 
transport network. To estimate the travel time of metro 
trains, a common approach of constant running speed was 
used, together with a proposed approach: a model of travel 
time, which takes into account the variability of travel time. 
The calculations were performed for the years 2016 and 
2036. The results are shown in Table V.

A more detailed approach resulted in a more accurate 
estimate of the number of users of the entire system of public 
transport. As a result, the process of calibration of the 
Warsaw simulation model was much easier. 
VII. CONCLUSIONS 
Even a highly automated urban transport system such as 
a metro is characterised by a certain variability of travel 
time. What can be observed is a decrease in transportation 
speeds during peak hours and speed increase in the evenings. 
Average running times and random components of running 
times on the sections between stations can be very precisely 
estimated on the basis of their length, regardless of the 
period of the day. The frequency runs up to as high as 20 
trains per hour does not significantly influence the average 
running time. However, stations stops definitely have a 
greater influence on the variability of travel time. Average 
values for dwell times and their random components were 
determined for 3 basic station types, dependent on the 
location of the station relative to the inner centre.  
The presented model for the travel time of the metro line, 
can be used as an input to the macro-simulation models of 
cities with metro systems. The results of parameter 
estimation of the model are of local character and depict 
current and future operational conditions of the first metro 
line in Warsaw. However, they can be adjusted to local 
conditions in other cities. 
Further work on the halt times will aim at including the 
size of passenger flows.
