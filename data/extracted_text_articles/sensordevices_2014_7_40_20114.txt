Abstract—The visual evaluation of fuel cells by 
conventional means is impossible. To improve the power 
generation efficiency of fuels cells, the evaluation of 
catalytic reactions on the electrodes and ion propagation 
in the electrolyte are important. We developed a 
terahertz chemical microscope (TCM) to visualize the 
electric potential shift in the catalytic electrodes of fuel 
cells. The potential energy shift of the fuel cells due to the 
dissociation of gases was visualized using TCM during 
fuel cell operation.

 INTRODUCTION 
Energy and environmental issues have recently become 
crucial and require energy solutions of high efficiency and 
low environmental load. Thus, the use of hydrogen gas has 
attracted attention. Fuel cells are high-efficiency devices that 
transform chemical energy to electric energy. However, the 
power generation efficiency of fuel cells has to improve. 
Hence, evaluation methods and investigation of the catalytic 
reactions on the catalytic electrodes and ion propagation in 
the electrolyte are required. 
Recently, we have developed a terahertz chemical 
microscope (TCM) to evaluate the distribution of the electric 
potential on a semiconductor-based device referred to as 
THz sensing plate. Terahertz (THz) waves radiating from the 
THz sensing plate can be related to the electric potential at 
the surface of the THz sensing plate [1]–[4]. 
Conventional evaluation methods of surfaces are atomic 
force microscopy [5], scanning electron microscopy [6], and

transmission electron microscopy. Kelvin probe microscopy 
(KPM) can measure the electric potential distribution on the 
electrode surface [7]. However, KPM probe needs to closely 
touch the electrode surface; thus, in general, it is difficult for 
KPM to measure the electric potential while the fuel cell is in 
operation. On the other hand, the TCM can measure the 
electric potential of catalytic metals without coming to 
contact with the surface of metals. 
In a previous study, the time variation of the THz signal 
during the fuel cell operation was measured [8], and the 
signal was observed to drift due to the diffusion of protons in 
the proton membrane. In this study, the two-dimensional 
imaging of the THz signal during the long operation of fuel 
cells is demonstrated, and the potential distribution on the 
electrodes is discussed.

EXPERIMENTS  
Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of the fuel cell on 
the THz sensing plate. The sensing plate consists of SiO2 
(275 nm) and Si (150 nm) layers on a sapphire substrate (600 
m). Because of its excellent mechanical and thermal 
stability, Nafion® (10%) membrane was applied on the 
surface of the SiO2 layer by spin coating and baked for 90 s 
at 90 °C. Platinum (Pt) was deposited on the Nafion 
membrane to serve as catalytic metal electrodes by 
conventional sputtering techniques. Before the experiments, 
we confirmed that the fuel cell fabricated on the THz sensing 
plate generated voltage as well as the actual fuel cells. 
Figure 2 shows the energy band diagram of the sensing 
plates, on which the Nafion membrane and the Pt thin film 
were fabricated. When femtosecond laser pulses were

irradiated from the sapphire side of the THz sensing plate, 
photoexcited carriers were generated in the Si layer. The 
photoexcited carriers were accelerated by the electric field 
generated by the depletion layer, and THz waves were 
radiated to free space. 
The relation between the radiated THz waves and the 
electric potential on the THz sensing plate is described with 
following equation: 
 
𝐸THz ∝
∂𝐽(𝑡)
∂𝑡 ∝ 𝑒
∂𝑛ሺ𝑡 
∂𝑡 𝑣(𝑡) + 𝑒𝑛(𝑡)
∂𝑣(𝑡)
∂𝑡 ,      (1)  
 
where J(t) is the current density, e is the elementary charge, 
n(t) is the excitation carrier density, and v(t) is the carrier 
velocity. Hydrogen molecules are dissociated when 
hydrogen gas is exposed to the Pt electrodes. The hydrogen 
ions (H+) diffuse into the Pt electrodes and then the Nafion 
membrane. The H+ ions are adsorbed on the SiO2 surface of 
the THz sensing plate. The carrier acceleration in the second 
term of (1) is equal to the local electric field Elocal in the 
sensing plate; therefore, the amplitude of the THz wave 
emitted from the THz sensing plate is proportional to the 
local electric field. 
The amplitude of the radiated THz wave is 
 
𝐸THz ∝ 𝐸local = ඥ𝑒𝑁D/2𝜀 × ඥ𝜙,        (2) 
 
 
where Elocal is the local electric field, ND is the carrier density 
of the Si surface,  is the dielectric constant of Si, and  is 
the electric potential. The shift in the electric potential of Pt 
due to the reaction of hydrogen gas is expressed by using the

Nernst equation: 
𝜙 = 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡 − （𝑅𝑇/𝑧𝐹） ln 𝑃H2,        (3) 
 
where F is the Faraday constant, z is the number of electrons 
transferred in the cell reaction, R is the gas constant, T is the 
absolute temperature, and PH2 is the partial pressure of 
hydrogen. Equation (3) shows that the electric potential of 
the THz sensing plate shifts because of the adsorption of 
hydrogen gas to the Pt electrodes in the fuel cell. The 
visualization of the chemical reactions can be achieved by 
scanning the irradiation point of the femtosecond laser 
because the radiated THz wave depends on the local electric 
field of the depletion layer where the laser is irradiated. In 
the fuel cell, the chemical reaction at the anode and the 
cathode of the operating fuel cell can be expressed as 
follows: 
 
Anode: H2→2H++2e− 
 
   (4) 
Cathode: 2H+ + 1/2O2 + 2e−→H2O.    
      (5) 
 
The electric potential shift because of the adsorption of 
hydrogen gas in the anode is obtained as the amplitude of the 
radiated THz wave by (3). At the anode, the hydrogen 
molecules, which reach Pt, dissociate to H+ and electrons. H+ 
reaches the cathode through the Nafion membrane. The 
electrons move to the cathode along the conducting wire. 
The THz amplitude from the anode increases with increasing 
electric potential because of the reduction of hydrogen. On 
the other hand, the amplitude of the radiated THz wave 
decreases due to the oxidation reaction of H+ in the cathode. 
Figure 3 shows the optical setup of TCM. The fuel cell 
fabricated on the THz sensing plate is fixed on the X–Y 
stage to scan the femtosecond laser. Before irradiating the 
THz sensing plate, the femtosecond laser pulses pass through 
the condensing lens to increase the spatial resolution. The 
Ti:sapphire laser is a femtosecond laser with a central 
wavelength of 780 nm, a pulse width of 100 fs, and a 
repetition frequency of 82 MHz. A conventional 
photoconductive antenna was used to detect the radiated THz 
waves whose amplitudes are related to the electric potential 
of the THz sensing plate. Figure 4 shows a photograph of

areas surrounded by the blue line show the catalytic 
electrodes. Hydrogen gas (1%) and oxygen gas (20%) in the 
nitrogen gas were, respectively, introduced to the anode and 
cathode to operate the fuel cell. Figures 5 (a), (b), and (c) 
show the change in the THz amplitude distribution obtained 
(a) before and after power generation for 1 h, (b) between 1–
2 h, and (c) between 2–3 h. Initially, the THz amplitude at 
the cathode decreases, whereas the THz amplitude at the 
anode increases. The change in the THz signals was larger in 
magnitude at the upper parts of the electrodes. Subsequently, 
the THz amplitude was saturated across the electrodes. 
The average values of the radiated THz amplitude from 
the anode and the cathode during the fuel cell operation are 
plotted in Figure 6. The electric potential in the anode 
increases, whereas that in the cathode decreases and, 
subsequently, both become saturated. This shows that TCM 
can measure the reaction amount in the catalytic electrodes.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
We mapped the radiated THz waves from a THz sensing 
plate, on which a fuel cell was fabricated, during fuel cell 
operation. The THz amplitude at the anode increased, 
whereas that at the cathode decreased. The nonuniformity of 
the THz amplitude can be seen at the anode and cathode. 
The results agree with past experiments. We also confirmed 
the reaction distribution in the catalytic electrodes with time, 
which shows that TCM can measure the reaction 
distribution in the catalytic electrodes. The radiated THz 
amplitude from the anode and cathode reach saturation with 
time. Evidently, TCM can measure the reaction amount in 
the catalytic metal electrodes. In conclusion, we showed that 
TCM can be used to evaluate fuel cells. When TCM is 
commercialized, we will be able to visually evaluate the 
uniformity of the electrolyte and electrodes. We conducted 
the experiments using only Nafion 10%; thus, we plan to 
measure the performance of fuel cells using Nafion with 
different concentrations or other electrolytes. The relation 
between TCM images and fuel cell efficiency is presently 
under investigation.
