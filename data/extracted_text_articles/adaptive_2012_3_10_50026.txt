Abstract— Taking into account   the amount and variety of 
measurements involved in scientific, industrial and legal 
activities that need traceability to the national mass standards 
of each country, it can be considered  that  mass standards  
calibration  is  one of the most  important  activities of the  
National  Metrology  Institutes  (NMIs). For the determination 
of the conventional mass, in the calibration of weights of the 
highest accuracy classes, the subdivision method and its 
variants are widely used. For the NMIs, it is very important to 
demonstrate and maintain their capability of applying with 
good results such methods. In this respect, a calibration 
procedure for the determination of conventional mass, called 
“adaptive subdivision method” was developed in the Mass 
Laboratory of the Romanian National Institute of Metrology, 
which can lead to an improvement of CMCs (Calibration and 
Measurement Capabilities, approved and published in the 
BIPM 
database). 
According 
to 
the 
International 
Recommendation OIML R 111, the weights of nominal values 
greater than 1 g may have a cylindrical shape with a lifting 
knob. Considering this kind of shape and the use of an 
automatic comparator, with the maximum capacity of 1 kg, the 
diameter of the weighing pan is too small for placing a group of 
weights in the range of (500…100) g; therefore, the usual 
subdivision method can not be applied for the calibration of 
weights. The “adaptive subdivision method”, presented in this 
paper, allows the cylindrical weights with a lifting knob, 
having nominal values of (500…100) g, to be calibrated using 
an automatic comparator (which is not equipped with weight 
support plates).  The method can be used for class E1 weights, 
where the highest accuracy is required. In this case, the 
resulting calibration uncertainty for the unknown weights is 
better than that usually obtained for E1 masses, being at the 
level of reference standards. 
Keywords - Subdivision method; automatic comparator; 
efficiency of design.  
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
In 1889, at the First Conference of Weights and Measures 
(CGPM), the kilograms prototypes were shared - by chance - 
for each country. Romania has received the "National 
kilogram Prototype No. 2" (NPK).  
NPK is a solid cylinder of Platinum-Iridium alloy (90%, 
10%), having a height equal to its diameter (39 mm). Now, it 
is maintained by the National Institute of Metrology and  
 
 
serves as a reference for the entire dissemination of the mass 
unit in Romania 
The realization and dissemination of the unit of mass by 
the Mass Laboratory of the Romanian National Institute of 
Metrology starts from the reference stainless steel standards 
(a set of three 1 kg mass standards and two sets of disc 
weights from 500 g to 50 g), which are traceable to the 
International Prototype Kilogram through the mass of the 
Romanian Prototype Kilogram No 2. 
 Starting from these reference stainless steel standards, 
submultiples and multiples of the unit are realized to permit 
the masses of additional bodies to be determined with 
traceability to the international standard. This takes place 
with the aid of several weights sets E1 of suitable grading (in 
most cases 1, 2, 2, 5) which are determined “in themselves” 
according to proper weighing designs and by using a least 
squares analysis (with subdivision or multiplication 
methods). 
In the calibration of class E1 weights, when the highest 
accuracy is required, the subdivision method is mainly used.  
The subdivision weighing design has both advantages 
and disadvantages: 
- advantages [2]: 
a) minimizes handling (and hence wear) of standards; 
b) produces a set of data providing important statistical 
information about the measurements and the daily 
performance of the individual balances; 
c) offers a redundancy of data. 
- disadvantages [2]: 
a) requires a relatively complex algorithm to analyze the 
data (as compared with other methods, for example Borda 
[3]); 
b) necessitates placing groups of weights on the balance 
pans (this can cause problems for instruments with poor 
eccentricity 
characteristics, 
or 
automatic 
comparators 
designed to compare single weights).  
To apply the calibration by subdivision method on the 
automatic comparator, a set of disc weights (reference 
standards) has been used. These weights constitute both 
support plates and check standards. 
The main objective in the search for better designs was to 
find a calibration scheme which can be performed 
considering the following factors: the automatic comparator, 
the diameter of the disc weights (so that a group of OIML 
weights can be placed over) and the efficiency of design 
matrix.

II. 
EQUIPMENTS AND STANDARDS USED IN CALIBRATION 
The weighing system includes a proper balance (mass 
comparator) with weights transporter, a monitoring system of 
environmental conditions and a MC Link software  
The mass comparator used was an automatic one, with 
the following specifications: 
 
- maximum capacity: 1011 g; 
 
- readability: 0.001 mg; 
 
- pooled standard deviation: (0.4 to 2) µg (for nominal  
masses 100 g  to 1 kg, respectively). 
For accurate determination of the air density an 
environmental conditions monitoring system was used, 
consisting in a precise “climate station”, model Klimet A30.  
Technical parameters for Klimet A30 are: 
 
 
- temperature:      readability      :   0.001°C; 
 
 
      
      U (k=2)          :   0.03°C; 
 
- dew point:       resolution       :   0.01°C; 
 
 
     
      U (k=2)          :   0.05°C; 
 
- barometric pressure:   resolution   :   0.01 hPa; 
 
 
                  U (k=2)               :   0.03 hPa; 
The mass standard used for the comparisons was an 1 kg 
reference standard, Ni 81, Fig 1, whose mass value was 
determined at BIPM.

Ni 81 had been purchased by the National Institute of 
Metrology in 1981. This mass standard is the second in 
importance after the NPK. The data included in its 
calibration certificate are as follows: 
mNi81 = 1 kg + 0.130 mg, U = 0.028 mg ,   (k=2);  
The weights involved in calibration are: 
- unknown E1 weights (from 500g to 100g, marked with 
A12…A9 ) having OIML shape, Fig 2.

STATISTICAL TOOLS FOR EVALUATION OF THE 
MEASUREMENT PROCESS  AND MASS DETERMINATION  
A. Method used to evaluate the efficiency of the weighing 
design  
The dissemination of the mass scale to E1 weights, using 
a single reference standard, requires mass comparisons 
between weights and groups of weights. 
A mass calibration design (or design matrix) describes 
the general setup of these comparisons. 
For a given number of mass comparisons, a criterion for 
the choice of a design matrix is that, the variances of the 
estimates be as small as practicable [4]. 
For this reason, the idea of efficiency was introduced, to 
enable designs to be analyzed using this criterion, taking into 
account the variances of the weighing results. 
The efficiency  is  very  useful when comparing  designs  
involving the same masses and balances,  even  if  the  
number  of  mass  comparisons differs. It is desirable that the 
efficiency of a design   be   large,   as this   would   indicate   
that   the variances are small [4]. 
Table II  lists  the  mass  comparisons  possible  for the 1 
kg to 100g decade, taking into account the following 
elements: the automatic comparator and the diameter of the 
disc weights (so that a group of OIML weights can be placed 
over).

TABLE II.  
POSSIBLE  MASS COMPARISONS FOR THE  1 kg TO 100g  
DECADE  
 
 
To establish the design matrix „X” of the comparisons, 
several versions were performed, then calculating the 
efficiency of the design for each of them. 
For example, using the notation of [4], for the design (2, 
1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1) an efficiency of 0.38 was 
obtained, while for the design (1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1) 
the efficiency obtained was 0.61. 
Finally, the design (2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1) was 
chosen, having 13 equations of condition, since the value for 
the efficiency was greater, namely 1.04.  
The efficiency was calculated in the following manner. 
Once all weighing are completed, the first step is to form the 
design matrix, “X”, which contains the information on the 
equations used (the weighing design).  
Entries of the design matrix are +1, –1, and 0, according 
to the role played by each of the parameters (from the vector 
β) in each comparison. Symbols used: 
    X the format for matrix: X = (xij); i=1… n;  
  j =   1,…, k;  xij = 1, –1 or 0;  
 
      β     vector of unknown departures (β j);  
     s    vector containing the standard deviation   of     
each comparison; 
  
     Y     the vector of measured values “yi”, including 
buoyancy corrections according to  (6) .

where: 
“Ni81” represents the reference kilogram standard; 
“NA”   the disc weights; 
“A12, A11, A10, A9” OIML weights of E1 class. 
In the “Fig. 4” it can be seen a detail of the weights

determination “y4”

where ur
2, is the square of the uncertainty of reference 
standard, named Ni81, and sj
2 (j= 1, . . . n- 1) is the variance  
of the j-th comparison. 
If G’ is the same as G without the first row and column, 
the matrix G ’-1/2 can be calculated. 
By denoting with J a (n-1) x (k-1) a sub-design matrix 
that would be used if the same mass comparisons are carried 
out, without the use of a reference mass, the matrix K can be 
defined: 
                      K = G ’-1/2 J 
    
Calculating KT, which is transpose of K, one can 
determine the inverse (KT • K) -1:

If vi are the diagonal elements of (KT·K)-1 corresponding 
to the i-th mass, σm  is the largest of the σi,  then the efficiency 
of the design, represented by the matrix X is defined as [4]:

 n           is the number of comparisons; 
 hi    the ratio between the nominal values of the  
unknown   weights  and  the reference. 
In Table III and Table IV, the calculation of the 
efficiency for different designs containing 13 equations of 
condition is presented.

It can be seen that, in the first case (Table III), a higher 
efficiency was obtained,  which indicates  that the standard 
deviations are smaller. Therefore, this weighing design was 
finally chosen to calculate the mass of the unknown and 
uncertainty of calibration. 
B. Mass results obtained in the calibration of weights  
If it is denoted by (A) the weighing of the reference 
weight and (B) the weighing of the test weight, an ABBA 
weighing cycle represent the sequence in which the two 
weights are measured to determine the mass difference of a 
comparison in a design matrix. 
The calibration data used are obtained from the weighing 
cycles ABBA for each yi (which is the weighing comparison 
according to design matrix “X”). 
The general mathematical model for “y”, corrected for air 
buoyancy is: 
y = Δm + (ρa - ρo)(V1 – V2)                 
with:  
 
        Δm     is the difference of balance readings;  
 
  o  
 1.2 kg m-3 the reference air density;  
 
  a    
 air density at the time of the weighing;  
        V1,V2   volumes of the weights (or the total volume 
of each group of weights) involved in measurement.   
To estimate the unknown masses of the weights, the least 
square method was used [4, 5, 6]. 
 The design matrix “X” and the vector of observations “Y 
“ are transformed (to render them of equal variance) in U and 
W respectively, as follows [4]: 
U = G -1/2X   and  W= G -1/2 Y    

The estimates βj and their variance-covariance matrix Vβj 
are calculated as follows:

The diagonals elements Vjj , of the Vβj represent the







V. 
QUALITY ASSESSMENT OF THE CALIBRATION 
As shown, for calibration of the E1 weights disc weights 
of 500 g and 100 g were used, having both the role of check 
standards and weight support plates for the whole 
determination.  
To see if the mass values obtained for disc weights are 
consistent with previous values, it is necessary to perform a 
statistical control. The purpose of the check standard is to 
assure the validity of individual calibrations. A history of 
values on the check standard is required for this purpose [1]. 
Considering that for the disc weights there are no sufficient 
calibration data to perform a statistical control according to 
[1], the method of normalized error En was chosen, which 
takes into account the result and its uncertainty from the last 
calibration.

CONCLUSIONS 
An evaluation procedure has been presented, used for the 
calibration of a set of weights by subdivision (similar 
considerations had been published by the author in [9]). This 
calibration procedure for the determination of conventional 
mass of the weights  was developed in the Mass Laboratory 
of the National Institute of Metrology, and can lead to an 
improvement of CMCs (Calibration and Measurement 
Capabilities), approved and published in the BIPM database. 
The main feature of this kilogram subdivision method is 
represented by the fact that the calibration of the weights 
(whose shape is in accordance with OIML R111) is 
performed 
using 
an 
automatic 
mass 
comparator.  
Uncertainties obtained using this method for the unknown 
weights are better than those usually occur for E1 (when only 
manual measurements are possible): 0.060 mg for the 500 g 
weight, 0.03 mg for the 200 g and 0.017 mg for the 100 g, 
being at the level obtained for reference standards (marked 
with NA). 
The comparison of results obtained for the disc weights 
by the subdivision method with those from the calibration 
certificate using the normalized errors En, confirms the 
consistency of the results. 
The method described in this paper for calibration of E1 
weights can be used when the highest accuracy is required.
