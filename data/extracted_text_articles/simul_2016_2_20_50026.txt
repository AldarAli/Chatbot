Abstract—Micro-scale agent-based modeling can be used for 
the simulation of pedestrian movement for low and high 
density scenarios and of the effect of changes in an 
environment. Such models can also be used for pedestrian 
dynamics in city centers to show the design effects in the 
shopping environment. This paper focuses on the generation of 
the movement network and the underlying behavioral rules 
that conducts the activation of pedestrians on the network 
representing a shopping environment. The store visits will be 
realized by Monte Carlo simulation.

 INTRODUCTION 
Agent-based modeling is a computational methodology 
that allows us to create, analyze, and experiment with 
artificial virtual worlds populated by agents. A specific 
research area is micro-scale agent-based modeling that can 
be used for the simulation of pedestrian movement for low 
and high density scenarios and for the effect of changes in 
the environment. Such kind of models can also be used for 
pedestrian dynamics in city centers to show the design 
effects in the shopping environment. In this context, Ali and 
Moulin [1] describe their multi-agent simulation prototype of 
customers' shopping behavior in a mall. The basis of this 
paper is an agent based model to simulate pedestrian 
dynamic destination, route and scheduling behavior. This 
agent based model is under development, where the 
simulation of movement patterns is embedded in a more 
comprehensive model of activity behavior.  
Representation is a substantial issue in simulating 
pedestrian dynamics. One can distinguish the representation 
of the pedestrian environment and the representation of 
pedestrians. In the domain of a city center, representation of 
a pedestrian environment includes the geometry of the 
shopping environment such as stores and streets, the network 
as a cellular grid, and pedestrian objects. Pedestrian 
representation includes socioeconomic characteristics, speed, 
goals, familiarity with the environment, and an agenda of 
activities. This activity agenda includes planned activities 
and can be rescheduled by unplanned activities. It is assumed 
that pedestrians perceive their environment and that they are 
supposed to carry out a set of activities. For completing an 
activity, pedestrians spend time in stores. As a consequence, 
time duration influences their movement behavior over the 
network.  
In this way, we want to achieve the full potential of an 
agent based model. Also, that it involves explicitly the 
modeling of the dynamics of the individual pedestrians. Such 
models are called agent-based simulation models [2]. In our 
case, the pedestrians are the agents in the agent-based 
simulation model.  
Although a 3D presentation of pedestrian movement is 
the ultimate goal, it is nevertheless meaningful to test the 
underlying principles in an appropriate 2D representation of 
pedestrians and their environment. Repast Simphony [3] and 
NetLogo [4] can be used as modeling and simulation toolkit 
because they provide a suitable simulation framework that 
supports skeletons of agents and their environment, and their 
interoperability (e.g., Geographic Information System, also 
called GIS). In our approach, we use Repast as guideline for 
the theoretical framework of the simulation process. On the 
other hand, we will use NetLogo for the actual simulation 
because it easily allows the empirical testing of the principles 
of the simulation approach. Also, we will use shape-file 
information of the environment and a network structure for 
visualizing the 2D environment. 
The realization of pedestrian movement uses a choice 
network approach. Herein, the network is an irregular lattice 
of cells and the choice of movement direction is determined 
by activation of pedestrians’ activities. The domain of the 
agent-based modeling approach is pedestrian behavior in a 
shopping environment and the choice mechanism that are 
involved. It shows some similarity with other models that 
investigate 
pedestrian 
movement 
with 
fine-scale 
considerations and pedestrians’ shop-around behavior 
(e.g., [5]), or principles of bounded rationality [6]. In 
tackling 
the 
combined 
‘Multi Agent System (MAS) – 
Cellular Automata (CA)’ approach, the inspiring ‘situated 
cellular agents’ approach [7] is worth mentioning. Rooted on 
basic principles of CA, this approach takes into account the 
heterogeneity of agents and provides interaction between 
agents locally and at-a-distance interaction; also, the notion 
of perception and action is included in affective agents [8]. 
Our model distinguishes itself from other similar models 
because store visit is included in the pedestrian movement 
behavior in the shopping environments. To our knowledge, 
this has not been done in this way.

This paper shows some similarities with previously 
published works (e.g., [9][10]) , but this paper makes it 
consistent with each other. Moreover, improvements have 
been made, in particular the mathematical underpinnings of 
the irregular network approach. 
This paper discusses successively pedestrian agent and its 
environment in Section II, the engineering basis of the 
simulation process in Section III, the simulation of store 
visits in Section IV, and the simulation of pedestrian activity 
and pedestrian movement in Section V, called simulation 
pedestrian dynamics. A discussion about the conclusions and 
future directions will conclude this paper in Section VI. 
II. 
PEDESTRIAN AGENT AND ENVIRONMENT 
The basis for a pedestrian agent structure includes 
methods like perceive, interpret and updEnv, where the 
pedestrian agent has its own control. The behavior 
represents the set of possible attitudes.  
The environment consists of streets, a set of stores, and 
pedestrians represented by agents. Streets are presented as an 
irregular lattice of cells (cellular network), which is used to 
simulate agent movement. A pedestrian agent moves with his 
own behavior and personal characteristics. At each time, 
there is an update of pedestrian agents’ positions (updEnv). 
In fact, each cell in the cellular network can be considered as 
an information container object; it contains information 
about the area size, street or store characteristics, and agents’ 
positions. We regard a restricted environment of a pedestrian 
agent in the cellular network. The cellular network provides 
percepts (perceive) and the pedestrian agent perform actions 
in them (interpret).  
The pedestrian behavioral aspects are shown in Fig. 1. 
Perceptual fields, which guide which stores an pedestrian 
agent will perceive, may vary according to the agent’s 
awareness threshold, which in turn may depend on his 
motivational state, age, etc., and the signaling intensity of the 
store or establishment, which is assumed a function of 
distance and appealing architecture.

Figure 1.  Pedestrian behavioral aspects. 
When stores are signaled and become included in agent’s 
perceptual field, the agent has to decide whether or not to 
act and visit the store. This is called the activation of the 
agent. We assume that activation is defined and depends 
among 
others 
on 
agent’s 
personal 
characteristics, 
motivation, familiarity with a store, suitability to conduct a 
visit, and the agent’s consideration set. 
Estimation results of these behavioral principles are not 
part of this paper and are described in [11]. 
III. 
ENGINEERING BASIS OF THE SIMULATION PROCESS 
This section provides some understanding in the 
engineering basis of the simulation of pedestrian movement. 
The principles are rooted in agent-based modeling and 
simulation, which is currently a fundamental tool for 
predicting the behavior of complex systems.  As mentioned 
before, we use the principles of Repast Simphony creating 
the model [12].  
The model structure in Repast Simphony is based on 
contexts and projections. The core data structure is called a 
context that represents from a modeling perspective, an 
abstract population: the objects in these populations are 
referred as agents. 
The context provides the main infrastructure to define a 
population and the interactions of that population. An 
abstract environment is created in which agents exist at a 
given point in the simulation. The context also holds its own 
internal state for maintaining the collection of agents; this 
state can consist of multiple types of data. That provides 
agents with information about the world in which they 
interact. In addition, data fields can be maintained by the 
context; herein a data field is a n-dimensional field of values 
with which the agents in a context interact. These data fields 
can be directly associated with a physical space wherein the 
field is generic, whereby each value is derived from a set of 
coordinates. 
Projections take the population as defined in a context. 
They impose a new structure on it, and the structure defines 
and imposes relationships on the population; therefore an 
agent population is realized once a projection is applied to it.  
A feature of Repast Simphony is the ability to integrate 
GIS data directly to the simulation; it provides a set of 
classes that allow shapefiles to be displayed. A shapefile is a 
storage format for storing geometric and associated attribute 
information. For example, shapefiles can be provided by 
QuantumGIS [13]. A GIS contains multiple layers of data; 
each layer is made up of a number of elements. Each feature 
in the layer has aspects to it; its geographical coordinates 
(but it could be also a polygon, a polyline or polypoint) and 
the data associated with it [14]. GIS store data about layers in 
database files, with each record in the file referring to a 
feature in GIS. Actually, integration with GIS means 
shapefile integration. Agents are created using these data, 
and the simulation process provides the population by the 
context creator.  
Agents, can be created, recreated and destroyed at each 
simulation step. They will be created by “Introduce Agents”, 
and the update of all agents ion the environment occurs in 
the “Agent Loop”. Fig. 2 shows the Agent Loop of the 
context creator. 
The interaction with the environment is provided by the 
shapefile containing GIS data and the other one for the 
generated network from this GIS data. The context needs this 
GIS data for the data fields which provides the information 
from the environment. 
In our approach, the environment consists of polygons 
representing the network of shops and streets. In 
QuantumGIS, feature data will be connected to cells of the 
network and layers will be created.

IV. 
SIMULATION OF STORE VISITS 
Borgers and Timmermans [15] used Monte Carlo 
simulation for the incorporation of the numbers of stops and 
the sequence of planned stops/purposes, because in their 
opinion the concept of multi-stop, multi-purpose behavior is 
relevant for understanding pedestrian behavior. According to 
this line of thought, we assume an activity agenda includes a 
number of planned and unplanned store visits that can also 
be considered as a number of non-impulse and impulse store 
visits. 
Every pedestrian agent receives at its introduction in the 
simulation a pedestrian scenario. This pedestrian scenario 
includes besides general characteristics like gender, age, 
companionship, also, familiarity with the city center, 
motivation, time budget, and activity agenda. After a store 
visit, the activity agenda will be rescheduled. The number of 
planned and unplanned store visits is determined by a Monte 
Carlo simulation.  
For this purpose, data from visitors to the city center of 
Eindhoven are gathered by interviewing them about their 
motivation and the stores they visited. For this survey about 
pedestrian behavioral principles, data were collected from 
405 respondents. Visitors are also asked about successful 
visits and which of them were planned and unplanned. Data 
about their activity agendas were collected from 770 
respondents. 
These routes provide the collected data. The findings 
from this collected data of the number of planned and 
unplanned visit stops show a skewed distribution. The 
skewed distributions are different depending of gender, age 
category and motivation.  We often need a skewed 
distribution where probability densities below and above the 
mean are distributed differently. In this case, we assume, by 
analogy with multiple stops, a Gamma distribution.  
The probability density function of the Gamma 
distribution is given by: 
 
; ,  = 
 /

 
             (1) 
 
where, k is the shape parameter (k>0) and θ is the scale 
parameter (θ>0).  
Both k and θ will be positive; they are derived from the 
skewed normal distribution of the number of (planned) stops 
from their data collection depending on gender, age category 
and motivation. The shape parameter k is derived from the 
skewness of the skewed normal distribution and the scale 
parameter θ is derived from the mean and k. The discussion 
about the values of the parameters and the related data 
collection has been described elsewhere [16].   
The Gamma inverse function G(p), which is the inverse 
cumulative distribution function, is given by (2). Given a 
random number p from a uniform distribution in the interval 
(0, 1), the value of G(p) has a Gamma distribution with 
parameters k and θ. That means, given a number p on the x-
axis provides the number of stops on the y-axis; where real 
values are rounded to integer values.

For example, Fig. 3 shows the G(p) distribution for the 
goal oriented orientation with respect to the number of  
(planned) stops. Also, there is a distinction for gender (male, 
female) and age (<55, ≥55 years). 
The number of unplanned stops can be derived from the 
calculation of the number of stops minus the number of 
planned stops. 
Time duration is the time spent by a pedestrian in a store. 
For the simulation run, the time duration is also determined 
by a Monte Carlo simulation. 
The findings from the collected data of the duration of a 
visit to a store indicate that this duration meets the Weibull 
distribution, and that this duration is dependent of the store 
category as well as the priority of the store. Fig. 4 shows the 
activity diagram of completing an activity in which time 
duration will be determined.

SIMULATION PEDESTRIAN DYNAMICS 
As mentioned in Section III, the environment consists of 
polygons representing the network of shops (stores) and 
streets. Polygons are used to indicate borders, functional 
areas like walkways. Adjacent cells means that connections 
are possible, for instance pedestrian agents can move from 
one cell to an adjacent cell. If cells are not strictly adjacent, 
no movement from each other is possible. 
Each cell in the network has a node. Therefore, the 
network consists of N nodes and L links. A subset of these N 
nodes are linked to J shops, and a subset E of these N nodes 
represents the entry/departure points of the simulation 
system. The link between a street-cell and a shop-cell will be 
established by the adjacent part of the polygon representing 
the shop and the street-cell.  Effectively, pedestrian agents 
are situated in the cells of the network, namely a street-cell 
or a shop-cell and bounded to a node on the underlying 
representation, and pedestrian agents can move on the 
implicit generated network to other nodes if they are linked 
together. The network is irregular because a clear border 
between a shop-cell and adjacent cell is desired. 
The test ground is the inner-city center of Eindhoven. We 
will perform the simulation on a segment of a section of this 
city center.  Fig. 6 shows a segment of the city center and the 
associated full network with their links. 
As mentioned before, we use a network of irregular cells. 
Fig. 6 (right) shows such a network that consists of street- 
cells, which includes the inner lane and two outer lanes, and 
shop-cells with one cell for each shop.  
In research areas like geo-computation, land-use change, 
and urban planning, one can find extensions on the 
traditional formalization of CA to include an irregular spatial 
structure [18][19][20]. These models are based on uniform 
CA transition rules.   
Tomassini [21] pointed out that standard lattice cellular 
automata and random Boolean networks can be extended to a 
 
 
Figure 6.  Main street of the city center (left) and the full layers (right). 
wider class of generalized automata networks that can be 
built on any connected graph. In this approach, there is no 
uniform transition function; the change is in the local 
transition function. 
We have no uniform lattice of cells and no uniform 
transition rules, because in our approach, a street-cell i in the 
network is bounded to the stay of a maximum number of 
pedestrian agents related to node i.  
Pedestrian behavior and pedestrian profile characteristics 
result in pedestrian activity and choice moments. That results 
in position change from a current position in cell i linked to 
node i to a next position in cell j linked to node j. Strictly 
speaking, our approach is not CA-based; nevertheless at each 
time step there is an update of the network according to 
‘network rules’. 
A pedestrian agent will be introduced in the simulation 
by setting an entry position, which will be done by Monte 
Carlo method. Also, a pedestrian agent receives a pedestrian 
profile including pedestrian characteristics, desired speed, 
activity agenda, etc. At a certain point of time, the network 
of shop-cells and street-cells is populated with pedestrian 
agents. At this point of time, all pedestrian agents have their 
current-node and according cell position. For each pedestrian 
agent, the to-node will be derived from the execution of 
pedestrian’s activity. The following ’network characteristics’ 
applies:   
Let L consists of a lattice of cells, representing the 
irregular network of shop-cells and street-cells, with size N 
which is the number of cells. 
The state of cell i is determined by its utilization, which 
depends of the number of pedestrian agents in cell i and the 
maximum possible number of pedestrian agents in cell i. 
Therefore,  
the utilization of cell i is defined by )*,
+
,+  with i=1,…N, 
-* = maximum of pedestrian agents in cell i,  -* ∈  ℕ, and 
*  = number of pedestrian agents in cell i, * ∈ [0, -*]. 
 
A configuration of L at time t is defined as

The progression of L in time is then given by the network 
update function, also called the evolution operator, Θ  
 
Θ: 4 → 4 + 1, t = 0,1, … 
(5) 
The network update function contains the walk-to-node 
operation for each pedestrian agent in the network and 
includes the following rule: 
If  pedestrian-agent pauses or  
 cell linked to to-node is full-occupied  
Then wait {to-node ← current-node} 
Else walk-to to-node

previous mentioned segment of the city center at a certain 
moment (different colors means opposite direction). 
 
 
Figure 7.  Main street of the city center populated with pedestrian agents. 
Striking is the apparent agents overflow at one of the 
shops. That has to do with the high priority of the shop, and 
that this shop has a lower floor. This is in contrast to the 
other shops in this street segment which only have a ground 
floor.  
VI. 
DISCUSSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS 
In this paper, we presented a simulation platform for 
performing pedestrian movement simulation in a shopping 
environment. Pedestrian movement depends on pedestrian 
behavior, which depends of behavioral principles like 
perception, activation and completing an activity. The 
outcome of pedestrian activation is pedestrian movement on 
the network of shops and streets. In our approach, 
pedestrians are represented by agents and the network of 
shops and streets are represented by a lattice of irregular 
cells; each represented by their node. Pedestrian agents move 
from node to node and are situated into the cells related to 
those nodes. They are situated randomly in those cells, but if 
the area is occupied they cannot move to that cell. This 
reduces the complexity of the simulation by ignoring 
collisions and with that collision detection. This approach 
makes the simulation feasible because computer power is 
less binding. 
Also, activity agenda’s for pedestrian agents could be 
incorporated, including planned and unplanned shop stops 
resulting in store visits with time duration of the store visit. 
In the next phase, the simulation in a 2D environment 
must be validated. In first instance we look at face validity, 
because it appears to be a reasonable imitation of a  real-
world shopping environment to people who are familiar with 
the real shopping environment. The validation test will 
consist of comparing outputs from the system under 
consideration to model outputs for the same set of input 
conditions. 
Future developments should make the pedestrian agent 
model suitable for a 3D environment with lifelike virtual 
persons. In that case, the pedestrian agent movement will be 
realized from cell point to cell point considering collision 
detection. Finally, this will result in a virtual environment of 
a real situation, populated with virtual visitors and a real 
visitor (user) moving amongst these virtual visitors. In that 
case, a user can assess an environment that has high reality 
content. For city managers or designer, it is possible to gain 
deeper insight into pedestrian activity behavior in city 
centers, even for those that do not exist yet.
