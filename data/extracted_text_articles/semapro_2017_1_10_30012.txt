Abstract—Human behaviour modelling is a prominent example
of an area in which information processing and understanding
remains a challenge. Among crucial problems of this domain
are heterogeneity, multiplicity and uncertainty of information.
Behaviour modelling beneﬁts from methods that enhance under-
standing of dependencies between phenomena and form a com-
prehensive model over a collection of elementary information
granules. If we consider analytical application, quantitative
predictive modelling becomes obsolete, because it is unable to
represent wealth of information and its structuring. Hence, there
is a need for semantic knowledge modelling. In light of the above,
we present a Cognitive Map-based modelling framework capable
to represent decision making processes. The model assumes that
motivational stimuli determine decision making outcome. In case
of human decision making, needs play the role of motivational
stimuli. A decision is an outcome of processing of human needs.
In order to reﬂect this using a Cognitive Map-based model,
we assume that concepts making a map correspond to various
needs. In the paper, we present a processing scenario that applies
a Cognitive Map of needs and a current state of personal stimuli
to produce a decision. We also apply the model to real-world
data in an experiment of mobile phone activity monitoring.
Index Terms—Cognitive Maps; Fuzzy Cognitive Maps; con-
sumer behaviour modelling; decision making.
I. INTRODUCTION
Human decision making elicits from an entangled collection
of needs, and depends on the current state of mind and external
conditions. Human decision making modelling is challenging
both on the knowledge representation level and on processing
level. First, human needs are not homogeneous, there are
many of them, they are dependent one on another, and there
is no objective and precise way to express their intensity
and character. This is the case when applying a non-standard
knowledge representation model that operates on abstract
concepts. Particular implementation of a concept should be
easy to interpret by a human being and it should relate to
a corresponding need.
Even though needs are an internal collection of stimuli, they
appear in some external context. In order to deﬁne a model
reﬂecting the described assumptions, we require some variant
of a semantic knowledge model with appropriate formalism
for data processing.
We propose to apply Cognitive Maps to consumer decision
making modelling. Cognitive Map is an example of a semantic
knowledge model. It is a soft computing method composed
of a collection of concepts and relationships between them.
Processing with a Cognitive Map could be envisioned as fol-
lows: as the input, we provide data corresponding to a current
state of phenomena. Map processes the input using concepts
and dependencies between concepts and produces output data
corresponding to the updated state of phenomena.
The key novelty introduced in this paper is the application
of Cognitive Maps to consumer preferences and decision
making modelling. So far, Cognitive Maps have been applied
to: time series prediction on a linguistic level [1], pattern
recognition [2] and system modelling and control [3].
The paper is structured as follows. Section II is a brief
presentation of background knowledge on consumer decision
making modelling. Section III introduces the new approach.
Section IV addresses the method with the help of case studies.
Section V concludes the paper.
II. LITERATURE REVIEW
In this section, we present a general overview of the most
relevant streams of studies on consumer decision making
modelling.
First, we need to mention the existence of a vast num-
ber of works on multi-criteria decision making. In this line
of research, we come across methods for weighting and
aggregating criteria relevant for a given decision. For in-
stance, [4] addresses a multi-criteria decision making model
utilising linguistic operators, while [5] addresses a method
based on prioritised weighted aggregation with OWA (ordered
weighted averaging) operator and t-norms. There is a wide
range of papers in this domain employing various operators
for aggregation and various models for knowledge represen-
tation. Among studies similar ours, we ﬁnd methods that,
apart from the task of criteria aggregation, take into account
interactions between criteria. This, typically, is realised by
assigning weights not only for individual criteria, but also to
all combinations of criteria. Aggregation is performed for such
extended formalism. An example of this approach based on
Choquet integral playing the role of an aggregation function
is presented in [6].
Another relevant group of studies revolves around prefer-
ence modelling. Preference modelling is focused on comparing
available alternatives. Let us assume we have objects x and
1

y from set X. We denote that x is at least as good as y as:
x ≿ y ⇔ f(x) ⩾ f(y), where f : X → R is a valuation
function that measures how good a given alternative is. In
addition, in many applications a strict preference relation,
denoted as ≻, is used. Apart from predominantly theoretical
studies on preference relations, like [7], the literature offers
impressive machine learning methods for preference learning.
Their aim is to use training data to form a model that
automatically performs alternatives’ ranking. Here, we ﬁnd
SVMrank which solves an optimisation problem aiming at
alternatives ranking [8], the ListNet [9] which is an algorithm
based on neural network and gradient descent.
A Cognitive Map is a soft computing method forming
a semantic knowledge model over a set of concepts. A map
is a weighted digraph: it consists of concepts (vertices) and
directed weighted edges linking the concepts. The philosophy
of modelling with Cognitive Maps is very simple: concepts
correspond to phenomena, linkages to relationships between
phenomena. Weights inform about character and strength
of connection. Weights are collected in a weight matrix.
Such minimal formalisation encouraged extensive research
on Cognitive Maps and led to the development of related
sub-families, i.e., Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, Granular Cognitive
Maps, etc. Versatility of the original formalism of Cognitive
Maps proved to be so desirable and successful, that it has
remained unchanged in all named sub-kinds of Cognitive
Maps. What differentiates them is the assumed information
representation model: crisp in Cognitive Maps, fuzzy in Fuzzy
Cognitive Maps, granular in Granular Cognitive Maps, etc.
Intensive research on Cognitive Maps in application to
knowledge processing started with a ground-breaking paper
by B. Kosko [10]. The referenced paper presents a general-
isation of Cognitive Maps to Fuzzy Cognitive Maps. More
importantly, it presents a simple method for weight matrix
learning. Nowadays, major studies on Cognitive Maps revolve
around Fuzzy Cognitive Maps trained using a bio-inspired
metaheuristic optimisation algorithm of choice. As mentioned,
experimental ﬁelds, where Fuzzy Cognitive Maps have been
successfully utilised include systems modelling and control,
time series analysis, and pattern recognition.
In this paper, we present an application of Cognitive Maps
to human decision making modelling, which is a novel and
original contribution.
III. PRELIMINARIES
A. Consumer Representation
The primary task is to deﬁne a model for consumer rep-
resentation that will be the backbone of decision making
modelling framework. Inspired by the research of K. Lewin on
psychophysical ﬁeld [11], we assume that a vector of all needs
represents each consumer. Such inﬁnite vector is a subject for
further modelling. The vector in its most general form is given
as:
x = [x1, x2, . . .]T
(1)
x represents a given consumer, xi, i = 1, 2, . . . , +∞ stands
for his i-th need. It is worth to explain that a vector of needs
x is of ﬁnite length in any practical application. Inﬁnity in its
description underlines that, despite its ﬁniteness, we do not
put restriction on its length, see below for details.
Each need in the vector is evaluated using a selected infor-
mation representation scheme. In order to choose a particular
model, one shall consider properties that are the most desired
in a given application area. In our experiments, we considered
crisp information and fuzzy sets [12], but there are other
options available, for instance intuitionistic fuzzy sets.
In theory, the needs vector is inﬁnite, because the set
of needs is inﬁnite. One aspect of human development is
that it is accompanied by recognition of new needs. This
phenomenon is explained by Maslow, [13], who states that
after satisfying needs of a prime urgency, humans naturally
start recognising more reﬁned desires. Moreover, identiﬁcation
of new needs could be triggered by external stimuli, especially
skilful marketing communication. The framework presented in
this paper operates on a ﬁnite set of needs. This limitation is
necessary, not only for computational reasons, but also because
it is the only sensible convention to focus on needs relevant
to a problem of interest. In practice, relevant needs must be
identiﬁed before empirical data is collected. Let us give a few
examples of sets of needs relevant in different decision making
problems:
• needs relevant when we consider a particular car pur-
chase: number of seats, capacity for carrying goods, ease
of access to repair shops, level of extravagance associated
with the car, etc.
• needs relevant when shopping for cleaning supplies:
wood cleaner, glass cleaner, disinfectant, etc.
• needs related to an evening outing: concert, restaurant,
theatre, visiting friends, etc.
Most importantly, the model allows describing causality.
A particular needs vector describes preferences at a given at
a given moment in time. Building consecutive vectors, with
different needs evaluations will allow to represent time ﬂow
and illustrate change of needs.
The strength of motivational stimuli is expressed through
needs evaluation. The method of evaluation depends on se-
lected information representation model. If we employ clas-
sical set theory, a need either exists or it does not. Hence,
evaluation of a need relies on selecting a number from the set
{0, 1}. In contrast, with fuzzy set theory, needs are evaluated
as real numbers from the interval [0, 1]. We can also perform
needs evaluation based on linguistic variables or some other
method we ﬁnd suitable.
The model is capable to describe and discover dependencies
at various levels of generality. This derives from the fact that
we can easily group speciﬁc needs into more general clusters
or the other way around: based on a general group of needs,
we can transition into a ﬁne-grained analysis, depending on
the availability of data. For example, a general type of need

for existence includes all needs for food. The need for food
contains a need for carbohydrates. The need for carbohydrates
may be satisﬁed by consuming rice, bread, pasta, cookies, and
so on. The structure is recursively nested.
Additionally, this relatively simple form of consumer rep-
resentation allows sophisticated analysis, if we consider an
abstract space of consumers described by their needs. In such
a space, we may deﬁne classes of consumers and detect
similarity between classes of consumers.
B. Processing with Cognitive Maps and Fuzzy Cognitive Maps
A Cognitive Map is a graph-based knowledge represen-
tation model. Let us denote the vertices in the map as
A1, A2, . . . , Ac, where c represents the number of vertices.
Vertices correspond to abstract concepts. The strength of
relationships between the vertices is denoted using weights:
w11, w12, . . . wcc, where wij is a weight going from the
concept Ai to the concept Aj. Weights are gathered in a c×c
weight matrix denoted as W. Particular values assumed by
wij depend on an assumed information representation system
(fuzzy, crisp, etc.).
In (regular) Cognitive Maps, weights assume values from
the set {−1, 0, 1}. −1 indicates that an increase in a source
node is correlated with a decrease in a destination node.
0 denotes lack of relationship. 1 informs that an increase in
a source node causes increase in a destination node.
The constricted set of values allowed in regular Cogni-
tive Maps limits their ﬂexibility. The formulation of Fuzzy
Cognitive Maps appeared as a remedy for this issue. In
Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, relationships are expressed using real
numbers from the [−1, 1] interval [10].
Processing with any Cognitive Map is realised in the fol-
lowing way: as the input to the map we pass c activations
gartered in a c-dimensional vector, where one activation is for
one node in the map. Let us denote the vector of activations
as x = [x1, . . . , xc]T . Activations are the input data and they
correspond to the state of nodes (the state of excitement of
needs) at the current moment in time tm. The map processes
the input using weights W and, as a result, we obtain the
output. Let us denote the output as y = [y1, . . . , yc]T . The
output is interpreted as the state of nodes in the next moment
in time (tm + 1). In other words, the Cognitive Map models
changes of a system of concepts in time. The idea behind
processing with a Cognitive Map composed of three nodes is
illustrated in Figure 1. Computations are formally represented
as follows:
y = W ⋆ x
(2)
where ⋆ is an operation on a matrix and a vector.
Typically, but not always, in Cognitive Maps, input and
output vectors are evaluated using values from the set {0, 1},
while Fuzzy Cognitive Maps use real numbers from the
interval [0, 1]. Particular examples of implementations of ⋆ op-
eration are given in Section IV.
Fig. 1. Processing with a Cognitive Map (CM) with three nodes.
Map outputs represent state of nodes in the next moment in
time. We wish that the predicted states are as close as possible
to the actual states observable in future. In other words,
maps allow predicting. The prediction quality is expressed by
calculating similarity between map output y and desired target
values, denoted as t. This could be expressed as:
y ∼ t
(3)
t = [t1, t2, . . . , tc]T is the desired, ideal target.
The modelling outcome depends on the weight matrix.
There are three strategies that could be executed in order to
obtain a weight matrix:
• involve human experts to manually propose a weight
matrix,
• run supervised learning procedure to extract a weight
matrix automatically from data,
• hybrid learning: use expert knowledge to deﬁne ﬁne-
grained conditions to facilitate a better performance of
a learning algorithm.
The ﬁrst approach is the most inconvenient, because in order
to build a map, we need human involvement and the procedure
is manual. The substantial advantage of this approach is that
when a Cognitive Map is constructed by experts, its formalism
is well understood. Humans provide a structured representation
of phenomena in a way that is easy to interpret and conveys
a meaningful description.
Automated weight matrix learning has the big advantage
that it does not require the considerable effort needed when
we involve human experts. In this case, we use historical
data to obtain a weight matrix. In practice, there are a few
obstacles in this approach. First, not all applications have
enough historical data. Second, trends in development of
algorithms have brought forward nature-inspired optimisation
heuristics, like Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimisa-
tion, and so on. They are applied in areas when optimisation
is difﬁcult, as this one, and their motto is (so to speak) “close
enough is good enough”. More formally speaking, they do
not guarantee convergence to the optimum. In many domains
3

of applied Cognitive Maps, for instance in classiﬁcation, this
property does not affect the modelling outcome as weights of
connections between map nodes do not matter as much as the
outcome, which is, an assigned class label. In contrast, if we
want to obtain a meaningful knowledge about relationships
between the nodes, the “close enough is good enough” motto
is not what we shall be content with. It might happen that
two, substantially different maps (meaning: maps with dras-
tically different evaluations of weights) could provide similar
numerical modelling accuracy.
C. Cognitive Map-based Consumer Needs Representation
In our approach to human decision making modelling,
we assume that needs determine actions. We apply the ﬁeld
theory of K. Lewin, who is recognised as the founder of
social psychology, [14]. The ﬁeld theory can be transparently
transformed into a mathematical model. This is a rare and
valuable property, because many psychological theories are
rather descriptive than quantitative. The ﬁeld theory says that
at a given moment in time we exist within or, to put it
in another words, we own a certain abstract psychophysical
ﬁeld comprising of all needs there are. The strengths of
needs in a psychophysical ﬁeld change over time. The reason
for change could be internal or external. There is also an
assumption that any part of a psychophysical ﬁeld depends
on its every other part. Human behaviour can be explained by
analysing forces acting in the ﬁeld.
Our model captures the moment when needs get re-
evaluated in response to new input conditions. Hence, we
assume that:
• a Cognitive Map represents relationships between human
needs,
• input data (activations) of the Cognitive Map correspond
to the current strength of motivational stimuli,
• the Cognitive Map’s output represents strength of needs
in response to the input, analysing the output allows to
make a decision.
The premise behind introducing Cognitive Maps to repre-
sent consumer needs was dictated by review of the literature
on needs taxonomies. We see an insufﬁcient focus on methods
that take into account relationships between the needs.
In future, we plan to impose certain conditions on the needs
model. In this case, the most advanced, and at the same time
interpretable, form of an arbitrarily deﬁned set of conditions
is an ontology of needs.
IV. CASE STUDY
In this section, let us introduce a few examples of appli-
cation of Cognitive Maps to consumer decision making and
preference modelling.
Two case studies are arbitrarily deﬁned. They concern
decision making modelling using a regular Cognitive Map and
a Fuzzy Cognitive Map. The discussion is limited to relatively
small maps representing ﬁve needs:
• listening to a radio,
• watching a TV,
• reading a book,
• playing with a dog,
• taking a walk.
The third case study presents another application of the
model - to consumer space modelling. We apply a Fuzzy
Cognitive Map to process a dataset describing mobile network
activity.
A. Cognitive Map for Decision-Making Modelling
The ﬁrst example covers the most basic version of the
model. Is is based on a (regular) Cognitive Map, in which
relationships between the nodes are expressed as values from
the set {−1, 0, 1}. Input activations assume values from the
set {0, 1}. We analyse a Cognitive Map for one consumer.
Relationships between needs were deﬁned arbitrarily and are
displayed in Figure 2.
Activations describe current excitement levels of the needs
under consideration. Let us assume, that the consumer reports
the following activations: x = [0; 0; 1; 1; 0]T . The activations
order corresponds to the list mentioned above. We interpret
it as follows: lack of need for listening to a radio, watching
a TV and taking a walk; existing need for reading a book and
playing with a dog.
Fig. 2. Arbitrarily deﬁned Cognitive Map for the case study consumer.
We propose to apply the following, very simple, scheme
to implement the ⋆ operation, cf. (2). A single output yi is
calculated as follows:
yi =
c
X
j=1
wij · xj
(4)
c denotes the number of nodes in the map. In this case, c = 5.
For simplicity, we do not introduce any scaling to the outcome
of the sum of products. Therefore, yi assumes a value from the
set {−c, −(c − 1), . . . , 0, . . . , c − 1, c}. The Maximum value
in the output vector indicates a decision. It is very easy to
imagine more sophisticated aggregation schemes.
Let us present the decision making modelling based on the
stated assumptions:

In response to the presented activations, the need to go for
a walk will be perceived as the strongest.
B. Fuzzy Cognitive Map for Decision Making Modelling
In the second case study, we present a Fuzzy Cognitive
Map constructed for one consumer concerning the same set of
ﬁve needs as in the previous example. The map was deﬁned
arbitrarily and is displayed in Figure 3.
Let us recall that in Fuzzy Cognitive Maps weights are
evaluated as numbers from the [−1, 1] interval, while acti-
vations and outputs are numbers from the [0, 1] interval. The
implementation of the ⋆ operator from (2) on the level of
a single node is realised as follows:
yi = f

two alternative methods of how to use a sliding window Fuzzy
Cognitive Map model. The ﬁrst is that we average the model
responses and produce a time series prediction in the form of
a sequence of numbers. In this case a particular prediction is
one point. The second method, more suitable for this study,
is when we obtain a prediction in the form of a sequence of
intervals. In this case a particular prediction is in the form of
a lower and an upper interval limit, between which we assume
that the state of phenomena is acceptable.
We run Particle Swarm Optimization to determine the best
weights by minimization of Mean Squared Error between the
Fuzzy Cognitive Map responses and target values:
MSE =
1
N · c
N
X
i=1
c
X
j=1
(yji − tji)2
(7)
N is the number of samples, c is the number of nodes, y are
map responses, t are targets. We used 160 pairs of activation
and target for map training and the remaining 80 pairs were
left for model testing. We can technically perceive the data
used for map training as a time series of four variables.
In addition, in the application of trafﬁc monitoring, it
is worth to consider softening decision rules. In particular,
we can extend the interval of acceptable values by some
reasonable value. An example of a measure that can be used
to evaluate the degree to which we expand margins is standard
deviation.
In order to verify if we trained a correct model we plot
predicted interval limits and actual values of time series for
the four studied zones. This is presented in Figure 4 for train
and test sets. We soften the decision margin by adding half of
standard deviation for each variable. The four variables have
the following standard deviations: 0.1742, 0.2526, 0.1111,
0.0523. The predicted lower (green) and upper (red) limits for
the four zones are illustrated in Figure 4. Black lines present
true levels of trafﬁc. The MSE for the four studied zones is
present in each plot. We can conclude that the model was
properly trained.
After the Fuzzy Cognitive Map was trained and we veriﬁed
that it correctly describes the given data, we use it as a decision
making aid. The application of the Fuzzy Cognitive Map can
be informally described as follows. A person is planning to
travel through the four zones. He collected information about
the trafﬁc in the last three hours in these zones and passes
it as the input to the map. The map calculates a pessimistic
and an optimistic prediction for the next moment in time. The
person can decide whether to go or not to go.
Since the above application is trivial, we additionally tested
the model in two less standard scenarios:
• How does the Map react if the input is consistently
distorted? Consistently distorted input corresponds to
a continuous sequence of recorded and known anomalous
states of phenomena.

• Is the Map sensitive to singular anomalies? Singular
anomalies appear as single events, they are not preceded
by anomalous events.
In Table I we present average coverage of train and test set
observations by predicted intervals. The notion of coverage is
quite straightforward, namely it is the number of true observa-
tions falling into predicted intervals. Intervals are spanned by
the factor of a fraction of standard deviation. Without surprise,
the more we expand the interval, the greater the coverage gets.
An analogous experiment was conducted for test data dis-
torted with systematic noise. For this experiment, we added or
subtracted a constant value to or from all activation vectors.
We run activations with the Fuzzy Cognitive Map and we
computed the average coverage of map outputs. The ﬁrst test

was performed for the original model, with the lower and
the upper interval limits produced by the map. The next two
tests were performed for intervals expanded by constant value
equal to 0.2 of standard deviation and by 0.5 of standard
deviation. The results are displayed in Table II. Without
surprise, coverage is smaller, in comparison with results in
Table I. Consistently, as we expand intervals, coverage grows.
Further experiments were for data that simulated unexpected
anomalies. Anomalies were added randomly to target data. We
can visually verify susceptibility of the trained Map to random
distortions. The results (for a couple of zones) are illustrated
in Figure 5. Random anomalies were generated by adding
positive numbers drawn randomly from normal distribution
with mean equal to 0 and standard deviation equal to 0.3. We
added anomalies to 30 randomly selected values from the test
set. Figure 5 concerns predictions expanded by 0.5 of standard
deviation.

V. CONCLUSION
In the paper, we have introduced a consumer decision
making modelling approach based on Cognitive Maps and
a vector-based representation of consumer needs. The method
is ﬂexible. Not only does it allow to model decision making
processes, but also structures in consumer and needs spaces.
The approach is on one hand easy to interpret, as a map pro-
vides a semantic knowledge representation, and, on the other
hand, powerful, as the weight matrix can be automatically
trained from historical data.
The intention of this paper was to introduce the idea of
a versatile model for consumer preferences representation
and modelling. The model requires further development and
experimenting. We would like to emphasise that our study
on homogeneous preferences analysis and the mobile activity
dataset are in a very early stage. In future, we plan to analyse
this dataset to a greater extent.
