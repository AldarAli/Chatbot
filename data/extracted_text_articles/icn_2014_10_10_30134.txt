Abstract — Modern Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) are 
based on specific services that are hosted at network edges. These 
services are created using in-vehicle computing appliances, 
private cloud infrastructure and global information resources. 
According to the proposed approach all vehicles are considered 
as a mobile part of a low level operation network that provides 
low latency and requested quality of service (QoS) characteristics 
for the intelligent transport communication and information 
systems. Moreover, some of the discussed decisions support 
multiprotocol interactions and provide predictable real time 
performance so they can be used for different kinds of industrial, 
transport and robotics applications. ITS supplemented by low 
level operation network expands opportunities for a practical 
implementation of the emerging technologies for the Internet of 
Things (IoT). Due to the wide functional abilities the proposed 
approach is suitable for Big Data and on-demand high 
performance applications. Some aspects of these services develop 
the ideas of IBM “Smarter Planet” initiative and CISCO’ Fog 
Computing. Researched model of multiprotocol node may be 
seamlessly integrated into an existing ITS cloud infrastructure 
using virtual firewall appliances to provide bilateral access 
control between vehicles that belong to MESH network and IaaS 
segments’ resources, which support high performance computing 
and even supercomputers services.

INTRODUCTION 
There are few approaches with potential to improve 
reliability and security of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) 
using possibilities to merge local resources of vehicle and 
different kinds of global cloud oriented services. Some aspects 
of these services develop the ideas of IBM “Smarter Planet” [1] 
initiative and CISCO’ Fog Computing [2]. Emergence is 
achieved by the integration of three key technologies into 
reconfigurable and scalable service infrastructure: information, 
computer and communications. Such combination process is 
not a trivial task, especially in the case of transport systems, 
which support interaction of moving objects. The advantage of 
this technological approach is to expand online services to the 
drivers and passengers, to increase logistics efficiency and 
security of transport operations, as well as to prevent some road 
accidents. In this context, main challenge concerning research 
and design for the new generation of ITS is associated with a 
collaborative decision of the fundamental problem – 
organization of a real time access to big data from a moving car 
[3]. All aspects of this problem have a common background 
that are closely associated with communication technology 
tasks, namely [4]: 
Connecting a user to local and global data. The volume of 
data, to which the vehicle has an access, is a critical parameter 
of ITS. This requirement depends on a hierarchical structure of 
the territorially distributed communication system, the local 
part of which receives time-critical operational data and 
processes it by the end-users’ computers, and the second one 
belongs to a global cloud-oriented distributed information 
service housing at the data center far from the edge of ITS 
infrastructure. 
Distributing processing tasks between a vehicle and cloud 
backbone 
resources. 
A 
computing 
platform 
extends 
capabilities of ITS services by sharing a processing operation 
with data between mobile real time vehicles’ appliances and 
high performance massive scale resources of global 
information network or private cloud backbone. 
Support bilateral mobile vehicle interaction. Variability 
due to the mobility is the key feature of ITS, that should be 
taken into account to improve performance, security and 
privacy issues by controlling data flows at the networks’ edge 
points and by integrating multiprotocol vehicles’ gateway with 
distributed communication infrastructure. 
Seamless integration with security services. Information 
security 
requires 
seamless 
integration 
of 
data 
and 
communication services. This can be reached by using specific 
solution based on the stealth firewall technology for vehicle 
telematics hardware appliances and IaaS components of cloud 
environment. 
Taking into account all aspects mentioned above we 
consider new services for Vehicle Controls Systems (VCS) that 
are hosted at any edge of ITS network infrastructure. These 
services expand the range of automotive protocols supported 
by vehicle embedded computing appliances, as well as 
available via MESH network private cloud resources and 
global public information systems. From the system point of 
view new services can be divided into three main categories: 
1) communication 
services, 
which 
support 
real-time 
requirements; 2) access control between vehicle and high 
performance data processing resources; 3) high capacity 
storage systems that are available to VCS and belong to ITS 
cloud environment. Discussed approach can be implemented 
not only within ITS but also for various applications including 
emergency departments, regional data centers and Internet of 
Things (IoT). 
The paper is organized as follows: in Section II, we 
introduce basic requirements for a new generation of ITS, 
describe characteristics, architecture and data structure of new 
proposed services; then, in Section III, we propose a model of 
ITS network edge that is the key component of mobile 
transport MESH network; we move on with information

security and access control services based on stealth firewalls 
in Section IV and conclude with Section V, in which we briefly 
present the main results of our work. 
II. 
ITS AND CLOUD TECHNOLOGY 
One 
of 
the 
promising 
technologies 
for 
vehicles’ 
infrastructure management is cloud computing [5]. This 
technology allows us to take into account the territorial 
distribution and dynamic nature of the transport systems while 
improving their sustainability and scalability. The synergistic 
effect of the cloud technology implementation include a 
number of advantages, namely: 
• 
Improvement of the dynamic characteristic of the 
MESH network at physical and data links layers; 
• 
Expansion of available information and computing 
services; 
• 
Spreading end-user’s requests between several access 
points and applications to reduce response time and to 
increase semantic significance of the responses. 
The main technological challenge concerns the way of how 
to allocate widely spread services and provides their 
availability to the end-user. One of the perspective ways to 
solve the problems mentioned above is to use cloud-oriented 
approach, which can be extended for mobility application due 
to the delay tolerance and secure infrastructure services (see 
Fig. 1).

Figure 1.  ITS system structure. 
Each vehicle appears as a source of information in the 
cloud environment and for other vehicles simultaneously. The 
vehicle control system itself has a non-zero probability of crash 
or failure. However, data flows from vehicle via wireless 
media are susceptible to interferences that can disrupt 
connection and interaction of network notes and service 
components. In this case, the reasonable effectiveness criterion 
of the tasks listed above is the probability of the message 
delivery within a given time interval from the source to the 
destination in the cloud environment [6]. Delivery probability 
is a controlled parameter, which is a function of the cloud 
resources needed to process service requests. For example, 
fault tolerant implementation of supervisory tasks, such as 
route planning or vehicle speed control can be realized with the 
requested level of delivery probability by using the distributed 
cloud computing system. Furthermore, service agents, which 
interact with a vehicle applications and run on a remote Virtual 
Machine (VM) can improve or even optimize vehicle 
performance by analyzing historical driving patterns along the 
same route. 
The concept of a virtual machine in the cloud architecture 
and MESH network architecture, that we propose, provides the 
implementation of the fault-tolerant, powerful and flexible tool 
for managing traffic services, roads infrastructure, and vehicle 
data. The implementation of our concept, which is based on the 
access control between vehicles’ appliances and cloud services 
can be realized using existing wireless and wired connections 
of various technologies.  
We consider a set of objects, a model of which is an 
extended network socket abstraction: 
 
Mo = {name, IP, port}, 
(1) 
where name is a name of the service provided, IP is an address 
of the facility, and port is an applications’ port, which is used 
for the transport layer interconnections. 
On the set of objects 𝑀𝑜 we introduce a number of 
services: 
 
Ms = ൛name, {〈pi, type〉}ൟ, 
(2) 
where “name” is the name of the service, {𝑝𝑖} is a set of the 
typed parameters with the attributes type. 
Consider the map 𝑇 = 𝑀0°𝑀𝑆, formed by the ratio 𝛬(𝑡) 
for different moments of time 𝑡 = 𝑡0, … , 𝑡𝑛, which determines 
the availability of the service for the subjects of the information 
exchange. 
Then, oriented dynamic multigraph 𝐺 = (𝑉, 𝐸), where V is 
a set of vertices, consisting of the named services from 𝑀𝑠, and 
E is a set of edges determining the sequence of services, 
characterizes the availability of the chosen sequence of services 
{𝑚1
𝑠, … , 𝑚𝑛
𝑠} ∈ 𝑉. 
In turn, each vertex of the multigraph is a directed dynamic 
graph 
 
g = (v, e), 
(3) 
where v is a set of service parameters of {𝑝𝑖}, and e is a set of 
edges, that determine the acceptability of the given sequence of 
operations for the selected parameter {𝑝𝑖}.  
Within proposed hierarchy of models an admissibility of 
operations is characterized by quantifying estimation of 
relationships 𝜆𝑖(𝑡), chosen from the set of all estimators of 
operations {𝜆}. 
In this case, the task of choosing 𝑚𝑜 from the set {𝑀𝑜} to 
obtain a sequence of services {𝑚1
𝑠, … , 𝑚𝑛
𝑠} with parameters 
{{𝑝1}, … , {𝑝𝑛}} from {𝑀𝑠} can be formulated as the problem of 
finding a path of the dynamic multigraph G: 
 
∃ (E1 … En) ∈ E, ∃ {e1, … , e1n} ∈ e |(E1 … En) = 
(4) 
= {m1
s … mn
s} ∨ ∀ei = pi . 
Equation (4) can be solved by the modified Dijkstra’s 
routing algorithm [3], in which for each moment is given the 
237

vector of parameters, that takes into account both the 
information and the geographical connections of cyber-objects. 
There are three ways to implement secure communications 
between vehicle and cloud services: vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), 
vehicle-to-communication infrastructure (V2I), vehicle-to-
cloud (V2C). For the first one, we need to use MESH topology 
[4], in the second case – multiprotocol telematics appliances, 
and the last way could be realized using reconfigurable 
wireless networks. Merger of all these technologies provide 
solid background for a bilateral information interaction 
between all parts of ITS. That leads to simultaneous use of 
various technologies for communication channels to improve 
accessibility of cloud services, which require integration of 
data communications to the shared wireless multiprotocol 
network. 
Classical algorithms of MESH networks allow searching of 
the single route to the unique pre-known user. In the case of the 
cloud-oriented services and vehicles’ appliances, while routing 
each time, a network node has to make a choice of the most 
perspective next hop from several alternatives. It is necessary 
to find available destination nodes with access to a cloud and to 
evaluate perspective of communication through them.  
Fig. 2 shows the formation of functional virtual networks 
based on the multiprotocol MESH network of emergency 
services vehicles. Red background shows a virtual network of 
ambulance cars that provide an emergency aid service; blue 
one presents a virtual network of police cars. 
 
Figure 2.  Functional virtual networks of emergency services vehicles. 
Local vehicles appliances communicate via MESH network 
with single vehicles (V2V component) and cloud services (V2I 
and V2C components) as they need. Communication with the 
cloud environment can be implemented in two ways: by the 
vehicle with communication equipment and by the stationary 
point. The vehicle located out of stationary communication 
area can access the cloud resources through a vehicle relay 
network. The network provides a bidirectional message transfer 
between the vehicle and the cloud environment. 
The most important task for such network construction is 
the choice of communication protocols to increase message 
transfer adequacy. An estimation of message delivery time to 
the cloud services and back to MESH network users depends 
on a vehicle’s traffic intensity, a level of communication 
network load, an interface availability and its composition in 
each vehicles. 
A set of interfaces that allows being a user of Long Term 
Evolution (LTE) and MESH networks concurrently or MESH 
only (communication between vehicles only) should be 
installed in vehicles (network node). This new double-interface 
node (LTE, 802.11s) serves as a gateway providing 
communication between the MESH network and the cloud 
environment through LTE. 
Data transfer protocol and an intensity of transfer determine 
message transfer adequacy, design and actual communication 
speed, mean latency of message delivery between vehicles’ 
appliances and cloud environment. 
The main features of the virtual communication network 
shown in the Fig. 2 are the following: 
• 
Short lifetime of the static vehicles’ MESH; 
• 
A necessity of message transfer via MESH to the node 
that has an access to the cloud-oriented environment; 
• 
Seamless integration with security services using 
cloud-oriented firewalls. 
III. 
IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW MULTIPROTOCOL 
TECHNOLOGY IN FUTURE ITS 
We need to realize multiprotocol support for message and 
data delivery within restricted time interval using different 
kinds of telecommunication protocols for fully use of cloud-
based infrastructure to provide different vehicle’s services, 
especially critical tasks. These aspects are the key requirements 
for future ITS that should operate with mobile objects and 
stationary components of infrastructure. 
The implementation of such future ITS can be realized 
using network access mobile devices with reconfigurable 
multi-frequency radio connections that are simultaneously 
compatible with wireless interfaces (Fig. 3). 
 
Figure 3.  Multiprotocol node supporting ITS services. 
The support of information interactions mentioned above 
requires designing a new generation of multi-protocol routers 
for Dedicated short-range communications (DSRC), LTE, 
MESH, and Wi-Fi networks. Such routers should generate 
optimal paths taking into account the nominal and available 
bandwidth as well as current delays while delivering data 
packets or control information. These routers should have a 
well-defined relationship between: 1) data rate and the 
available throughput of virtual channel, 2) routing policy and 
current network topology, and 3) routing algorithms and 
characteristics of transport, network, and data link layer 
protocols. 
Creating a mathematical model of such future ITS is 
complicated by the large number of interdependent variables. 
In our work, we have used simulation methods and Network 
238

Simulator 3 (NS-3) [7] for verification of the proposed 
approaches. The NS-3 simulator version 3.16 does not have a 
premade solution for creation of a multiprotocol node that 
serves as a gateway between different wireless technologies. 
Building of simulation model for mobile communication 
network requires realization of a multiprotocol node model that 
functions as message router between MESH communication 
networks and stationary infrastructure [4]. Realization of the 
multiprotocol node was made on the base of a “spot-to-spot” 
virtual point that enables intermediate interaction between 
interfaces. The following modules of NS-3 were used to 
implement the model with the multiprotocol node: 
• 
802.11s interface model. Implementation allows us to 
use the Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol (HWMP) route 
protocol in proactive and reactive modes, in addition 
we use Optimized Link-State Routing (OLSR), Ad hoc 
On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV), Destination-
Sequenced Distance Vector routing (DSDV) protocols 
for wireless MESH networks; 
• 
Implementation of routing protocol models in wireless 
networks HWMP, OLSR, AODV, DSDV; 
• 
FlowMonitor is a module of network traffic statistics 
collecting and processing; 
• 
WireShark is an analyzer of computer network traffic; 
• 
NS-3-highway-mobility is a model of vehicular traffic. 
The simulation model allows to combine different routing 
protocols, network interfaces, and vehicles’ traffic models. 
Simulation result is the set of xml-files generated by 
FlowMonitor module. 
For experimental researches there was developed a 
specialized packet technology to initialize model’s parameters 
and to realize the change of parameters during the experiment. 
These parameters are: vehicle’s speed or trajectory change, 
routing 
protocol, 
transport 
layer 
protocol, 
connection 
throughput, number of nodes in the network, number of nodes 
transmitting data simultaneously, size of packets, packet loss 
rate in the communication channel [4]. While modeling for 
each node in the network the following characteristics are 
registered: packet’s send and receive timestamp, packet loss 
rate, packet size, source and destination IP addresses. Output 
stores as the xml-files for future analysis. A simulation process 
with prescribed parameters allows researching the most 
dynamic periods of the MESH network existence (short time of 
the network static life, wide range of network traffic intensities, 
high intensity of route relocation). 
Various sets of initialize parameters allow us to analyze 
different kinds of MESH and cloud-oriented states. For 
example, an estimation of security level for data transfer, actual 
speed of data transfer supported by the network, and average 
time of connection between the network mobile node and 
cloud-oriented environment. 
In our researches, we have done two types of experiments: 
1. Influence of the routing protocols on data transmission 
rate. We have considered OLSR [8], DSDV [9], AODV [10], 
and HWMP [11] routing protocols. As a source we’ve used 
UDP traffic with 8, 32, 64, 128, 512, 1024, 2048 Kb/s 
throughput. There was only one node with LTE interface. 
The best results with high intensity flows are shown by 
AODV, DSDV protocols. To transfer short messengers with 
low intensity it is better to use HWMP. 
2. Influence of vehicle traffic characteristics on the packet 
loss rate 
2.1. HWMP, OLSR, AODV, and DSDV routing protocols 
were used. Network bandwidth was 8 – 2048 Kb/s. There was 
one node with LTE interface. Packet size was 1024 bytes. A 
number of vehicles was 8 or 16 for 800 meters of the road. 
Traffic speed was from 10 to 100 miles per hour (MPH). An 
actual packet loss rate was determined by Wireshark. 
The reliability of message delivery was evaluated in a high 
dynamics of the network structure. Changes occurred at least 
once per second. Under these conditions, the intensity of the 
routing protocols was high and the packet loss rate was 
significant. 
Fig. 4 shows the packet loss rate transmitted from the 
network 802.11s node to the cloud from the protocols used by 
the wireless routing and data transfer speed. Packet loss rate 
ranges from 7 to 46 percent. Packet losses increase with 
increasing transmission speed. By increasing the transmission 
speed twice, packet loss increases three times due to the 
broadcast routing requests. The greatest losses occur while 
using OLSR protocol. 
 
Figure 4.  Packet loss rate from data transmission rate. 
 
Figure 5.  Packet loss rate from vehicle speed 
2.2 Fig. 5 shows that for one or two vehicles that car moves 
at a speed of 100 MPH packet loss rate is 78-92%. The reason 
is that vehicles are in radio visibility zone for very short time, 
which is not enough to establish connection with the cloud 
environment. By increasing the number of cars on the road, we 
would decrease the packet loss rate.

Figure 6.  Packet loss rate while transmitting emergency message. 
Fig. 6 shows the packet loss rate while transmitting 
emergency message from the vehicle on the strait road 800 
meters long. Packet size is 1024 bytes. Number of cars is 16. 
Vehicle speed ranges from 10 to 100 MPH. The number of 
nodes with LTE interface is 1, 2, 3, and 4 (which corresponds 
to 6%, 12%, 19%, and 25% of all cars). 
According to the received results (Fig. 6) packet loss rate is 
greater than 40%, while there are less than 25% of cars have 
LTE and speed is greater than 50 MPH. In this case, it is better 
to use alternative communication channels between vehicle and 
cloud environment. 
IV. 
SECURITY SERVICES FOR CLOUD-ORIENTED ITS 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Now, we will discuss the organization of bilateral access 
control provided for the mobile and fixed components of the 
ITS. Due to the dynamic nature of cloud environment, we 
propose to realize the services’ integration by using the 
expanding to cloud applications an existing version of the 
patented (US 7281129, RF 2214623) firewall decision. This 
approach allows dynamic changing access rules and operates in 
so called addressless or stealth modes using security policy 
semantic as an invariant for any interconnection between 
vehicles and ITS resources. An operational form of the 
proposed service can be represented as a set of traffic filters 
applied to each virtual connection. 
The development of cloud computing environment requires 
new approaches to provide information security [12]. These 
requirements come from the need to consider the dynamic 
nature of the processes allocation of computing and network 
resources in the configuration of a virtual machines, which are 
the basic components of modern service infrastructure. In this 
section, we discuss an approach to the firewalls’ configuration, 
by which are implemented control access policies to the cloud 
resources. Semantics of filtering rules and semantics of access 
policy must match or be close in a sense of chosen criteria to 
fulfill the requirements of information security for all possible 
configurations of cloud environment. Since the parameters of 
virtual machines that implement the application services are 
allocated dynamically the active filtering rules should also be 
changed during operation. In these circumstances, the 
traditional manual control settings of firewall rules in 
according to the access policy become impossible. 
In such a dynamic environment as IaaS, the most stable part 
of the information relations is specifications of access policy. 
These specifications are special type of metadata that reflect 
the semantics of access strategy. Clearly, this strategy is not 
changing depending on the dynamic reconfiguration of 
available resources, so it can be regarded as a functional 
invariant of cloud services. Therefore, it is especially important 
to develop methods of automatic configuration of filtering rules 
and adaptation their parameters to the current state of cloud 
infrastructure, which can be viewed as carrier of the mentioned 
above invariant [6]. The formal model of cloud environment 
includes several parameters, namely: 
 
θ = 〈U, R, P, C〉, 
(5) 
where 𝑈 = {𝑢𝑖}, 𝑖 = 1 … 𝑛 is a set of cloud system’s users. R is 
a set of roles 𝑅 = ൛𝑟𝑗ൟ, 𝑗 = 1 … 𝑚. And each role is a set of 
privileges: 𝑟𝑗 = {𝑝𝑘}, 𝑘 = 1 … 𝑙, 𝑟𝑗 ⊂ 𝑃, C – is a set of user 
sessions, which are presented by virtual connections between 
data source and destination in a cloud, P – set of privileges in 
the following form: 𝑝𝑘 = {𝑢, 𝑟𝑢𝑙}, where 𝑢 ∈ 𝑈 is a user of a 
cloud system, who is running information service (e.g., web 
application); 𝑟𝑢𝑙 = ൛𝑟𝑔ൟ, 𝑔 = 1 … ℎ – is a set of rules, which 
identify network application. The rule consist of the following 
parameters: 
 𝑟 = 〈𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡, 𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡, 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑜𝑙, 𝑒𝑥𝑡〉, 
where 
transport is a transport layer protocol (e.g., tcp or udp), port – 
is a number of tcp or udp port, protocol – is an application 
layer protocol, ext – are additional parameters for application 
protocol. 
 
Figure 7.  Security platform for cloud oriented ITS. 
The example P is formed by the following parameters: 
{user:“Ivan”, [{transport:”TCP”, port:”80”, protocol:”HTTP”, 
ext:[{method:”GET”}]}]}. This privilege allows access to web 
servers, which are running on port number 80 using HTTP 
protocol and HTTP method GET to virtual machines that 
below to the user named Ivan. In order to continue our 
formalization, the state of cloud system is presented in the 
following form: 
 
State = {vmi}, i = 1. . n, State ⊂ VM × U, 
(6) 
240
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2014.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-318-6

where U is a set of cloud users, VM – is a set of IP addresses of 
running virtual machines in a cloud. State is a set of addresses 
of running virtual machines with labels of users who started 
virtual instance. 
It is necessary to reconfigure security system each time 
when the State of a cloud system changes. Proposed security 
system consists of a group of firewalls and the security service, 
which is integrated with the cloud controller (see Fig. 7). This 
approach allows translating RBAC model of security policy to 
the set of filtering rules according to the state of cloud 
environment. As explained above when the State changes all 
firewalls on a mobile and fixed parts of ITS receive a message 
“new virtual machine with privileges P started” or “virtual 
machine with privileges P stopped” from cloud controller and 
then generate new filtering rules while keeping semantics of 
security policy. 
To provide a consistent set of rules we consider operation 
𝑔𝑒𝑛(𝑎𝑠, 𝑎𝑜, 𝑝), which translates privilege delegated to virtual 
machine with ip address as into the object (vehicle service), 
which is running in virtual machine with ip address ao: 
 
(p = 〈us, {ruli}〉)
gen
ሱሮ {〈as, ao, ruli〉}, i = 1. . n, 
(7) 
All services are related with specific virtual machines and 
when a user requests new service ITS launches a new virtual 
machine and its security subsystem, inspects user’s privileges, 
and generates filtering rules, which are running in another 
virtual machine. A stealth mode allows implementing the 
information protection system in a form of dedicated security 
domain. This domain can be quickly adapted to the current 
state of the network infrastructure and scaled if necessary to 
achieve seamless integration without reconfiguration of current 
ITS routing policy. 
The proposed IaaS computing platform with integrated 
security is implemented in telematics department of the Saint-
Petersburg State Polytechnical University and operates for ITS 
and other services. This platform is built using OpenStack 
services with custom proprietary software components. The 
platform installation is fully automated by Chef scripts and it is 
possible to install all services in a few hours on standard 
hardware. Our secure cloud computing test bench is available 
at the following address: http://cloudlet.stu.neva.ru. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
The results of this research can be summarized as a 
perspective way to expand opportunity for practical 
implementation of future ITS within concepts “Internet of 
Things” and “Smarter Planet”. 
We have proposed a formalization of the routing problem 
that provides the opportunity to develop a constructive multi-
functional hierarchical model of ITS, which could implement 
different classes of vehicle’s services, including transfer of the 
special class of emergency messages. 
As the part of our work, we have developed a simulation 
method allowing to combine the hierarchical network model 
with a specific structure of the urban transport network to 
select the optimal parameters of telematics services in the 
virtual network nodes for the delivery of emergency messages. 
The paper presents the results of the routing protocols’ choice 
using simulation modeling in NS-3. 
The proposed decisions can be used to reduce traffic 
congestion and emergency incidents, to support multi-protocol 
interactions, and to provide predictable real-time performance 
for different kinds of end-user applications, that needs to: 
• 
Sharing data between mobile objects and fixed 
infrastructure nodes; 
• 
Routing messages in multiprotocol mode; 
• 
Delivering urgent and delay tolerance information; 
• 
Integrating security services between ITS applications. 
Information exchange technologies developed in this work 
are implemented in the international space experiment 
"Kontur-2" on board the ISS [13]. 
Our future research will be focused on applying a cloud 
computing paradigm to develop adequate to the times 
communication services and safer requirements for the future 
generation of ITS.
