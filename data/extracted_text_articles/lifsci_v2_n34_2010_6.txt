Abstract - In this paper a novel spectral technique based on K-
Law Fourier nonlinear methodology is developed to classify 
White Spot Syndrome Virus inclusion bodies found in images 
from infected shrimp tissue samples. Shrimp culture is 
expanding in the world due to their high demand and price. 
This rapid increase in cultured shrimp production was 
achieved by geographical expansion and technological 
advances in reproduction in captivity of the white shrimp 
Penaeus vannamei, 
larval 
rearing, 
artificial 
diet 
and 
intensification in growth out systems. However, diseases are 
one of the major constraints for the sustainable increase of 
shrimp production. The white spot syndrome virus is a 
pandemic disease where frequently 100% mortality may occur 
within 2-3 days. However, several techniques have been 
implemented and developed for viral and bacterial analysis 
and diagnostic's tasks; histology is still considered the common 
tool in medical and veterinary fields. The slide images were 
acquired by a computational image capture system and a new 
spectral technique by the development of a spectral index is 
done to obtain a quantitative measurement of the complexity 
pattern found in White Spot Syndrome Virus inclusion bodies. 
After analysis the results show that inclusion bodies are well 
defined in a clear numerical fringe, obtained by the calculation 
of this spectral signature index.

 INTRODUCTION 
Several techniques and methods including microscopic 
observation under light, dark field, phase contrast 
microscope, bioassay, transmission electron microscopy, 
immunological, molecular and histopathological methods 
have been developed for viral and bacterial penaeid shrimps 
diagnostics [1][2]; these can be divided in traditional 
morphological pathology, bioassay, microbiology and 
serology and molecular methods such as PCR, however 
histology is still considered the common tool in medical and 
veterinary for research and diagnostics tasks [3][4][5]. The 
contribution of aquaculture to world supply of fish, 
crustaceans, mollusks and other aquatic animals has 
continued to grow, and has gone from a 3.9% of total 
production in weight in 1970 to 36.0% in 2006. The world's 
supply of crustaceans by aquaculture has grown rapidly in 
the last decade, and has reached 42% of the world 
production in 2006 and, in that same year, provided the 70% 
of shrimps and prawns (peneidos) produced worldwide [6]. 
Penaeus vannamei is the most important shrimp species in 
terms of aquaculture production and is naturally present 
along the Pacific coast of Central and South America [7].  
This species was originally cultured in North, Central 
and South American countries but at the end of the 1970s, 
this species was introduced in Asia [8]. In spite of this 
important increase of shrimp production, the shrimp culture 
industry has been affected since the 80´s with different 
important diseases [4], being the viruses the most significant 
pathogens 
in 
shrimp. 
Viral 
diseases 
have 
caused 
considerable losses of production and jobs, reduced earning, 
export restrictions, failure and closing of business and 
decreased confidence of consumers [9]. 
The white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is considered as 
a serious pathogen and is actually a pandemic disease 
causing important effects in production in many countries 
with the consequent social impact of many Asian and 
American countries. México traditionally is considered a 
privilege country where extensive commercial shrimp 
aquaculture can be exploited, due its weather and location 
close to the biggest consumer of the world, United States of 
America.  
Since 2000, in México, shrimp producers from the 
Northwest of the country have been affected by WSSV. 
Sinaloa and Nayarit states for example, were reflected their

losses by the reduction of exportations from 30.1 million 
USD in 2000 compared to the 44.8 million USD in 1999, 
the losses amount were approximately 14.7 million USD 
just in one production year, thus producers after this year 
have been taking actions to control the WSSV disease to 
reduce their impact [10]. 
Today the virus continues affecting the production 
causing the closure of many businesses and affecting the 
capital of many investors. It is reported by example that in 
the first half of 2009, the virus has caused mortalities of 70-
80 per cent in affected farms in Sinaloa and in Sonora the 
virus was dispersed in 2008 to areas of the state that had 
remained free of the pathogen (Personal communication 
with the Aquatic Health Committees of Sinaloa and 
Sonora). 
WSSV infections have been detected in various tissues 
and organs, hemolymph, gills, stomach and body cuticular 
epithelium, hematopoietic tissues, lymphoid organ, antennal 
glands, connective tissues, muscle tissues, hepatopancreas, 
heart, midgut, hindgut, nervous tissues, compound eyes, eye, 
testes and ovaries of naturally and experimentally infected 
shrimp [11]. WSSV can spread and infect shrimps of any 
stage of grow-out, asymptomatically affecting all life cycle 
stages, from eggs to broodstock. Once the clinical signs are 
developed, mortality can reach 100% in 3 days. The 
causative agent of the disease is an ovoid or ellipsoid to 
bacilliform in shape double-stranded DNA virus (120-150 
nm in diameter and 270-290 nm in length), which genus is 
Whispovirus, within the family Nimaviridae [12][13] . 
There is no efficient approach to control this disease, 
thus, the need for rapid, sensitive diagnostic methods led to 
develop new alternative techniques in different fields of 
knowledge. The selection of a method is dependent on the 
purpose, e.g., histopathology is used to determine the 
affected organs, the levels of affectation, the pathological 
changes in cells, tissues and organs and computing optic 
disciplines can be of support to these conventional methods. 
Histology makes possible to analyze pathological changes in 
several tissue cells and allow the pathogen identification, 
which are sometimes difficult to recognize with other 
alternative techniques.  
For this kind of analysis the method involves several 
steps to obtain the final sample, which contains a shrimp 
tissue slice where the inspection is conduced; this tissue slice 
has a thickness of 1-5 µm, stained with hematoxilin - eosin 
necessarily to make the examination under microscope. 
WSSV infection is commonly seen in cuticular epithelial 
cells and connective tissue cells of the stomach, carapace and 
gills. However it is also seen in antennal gland, lymphoid 
organ, hematopoietic tissue and phagocytes of the heart, 
some WSSV samples are shown in Figure 1. 
Infected cells typically have hypertrophied (enlarged) 
nuclei containing a single intranuclear inclusion. Inclusions 
at the beginning are eosinophilic and sometimes are 
separated by a clear halo beneath the nuclear membrane; 
these are known as Cowdry type A inclusions. Later 
inclusions become lightly to deeply basophilic and fill the 
entire nucleus [14], as shown in Figure 2. 
 
Figure 1.  Arrows show samples of connective tissue cells presenting the 
WSSV infection. 
There is no efficient approach to control this disease, 
however the WSSV early detection can prevent the shrimp’s 
mortality by application of different strategies, one of them 
may be the RNA genetic technique and it can be constituted 
as a new therapeutic strategy to control the WSSV infection 
[15]. Thus, the need for rapid, sensitive diagnostic methods 
led to develop new alternative techniques in different fields 
of knowledge like computing optic disciplines that can be of 
support to conventional methods. 
Several optic and computational techniques were 
developed to recognize these kinds of biological patterns, the 
analysis of inclusion bodies is determinant of the virus 
presence, e.g., the color correlation approach used to analyze 
and recognize the presence of IHHNV inclusion bodies by 
histological samples from 35 mm transparencies digitalized 
with a flatbed scanner [16]. 
The aim of this paper is to extent the development of a 
new technique to classify the WSSV basophilic and Cowdry 
type A inclusion bodies, acquired from histological 
digitalized images from infected shrimps samples by the 
analysis applied over WSSV sample’s slides, based in the 
application of Fourier spectral filtering techniques, such as 
K-Law nonlinear filter technique [1].

These Fourier spectral and color correlation techniques 
have been demonstrated the capability of analyze important 
characteristics from viruses and pathogens [16][17][18], 
including applications in several fields [19][20][21][22]. 
Therefore, section II describes the core basis of the 
methodology and the equipment used to obtain the images 
from infected shrimp tissues; section III presents the results 
obtained with the spectral signature index developed; 
additionally the statistical analytic values obtained from this 
index and the experiments carried out from the digitalized 
images previously acquired are included; finally in section 
IV the possible future work that needs to be done to enrich 
this research is discussed. 
II. 
MATHERIALS AND METHODS 
Development of a new technique to analyze and classify 
WSSV inclusion bodies is divided in five subsections; 
subsection A describes how the shrimp samples were 
prepared; subsection B describes the equipment used for 
image capturing; subsection C describes how had been 
determined the best spatial color channel function from the 
multispectral images where the WSSV texture measurement 
and tissue analysis are carry out by this technique; subsection 
D explains the mathematical basis used for this technique; 
finally subsection E describes the steps involved in the 
obtaining of the classification by the signature index 
proposed. 
A. Virus sample preparation 
Experimental shrimps were obtained from a farm located 
in the state of Sinaloa, México; transported live to the 
laboratory to be fixed in Davidson’s solution; after 24 h, the 
fixative was discarded and shrimps were preserved in 50% 
alcohol solution until they were ready to be processed by 
conventional histology techniques [2][3][5][13] to obtain the 
final shrimp tissue histological sample slides, as shown in 
Figure 3, afterwards they were ready to be examined under 
microscope.  
 
Figure 3.  Shrimp tissue histological sample slides ready to be analyzed 
under microscope. 
Several types of WSSV inclusion bodies were selected 
from cuticular epithelium, connective tissue and abdomen 
tissue and were digitalized to obtain a filter bank.

3.2 mega pixel digital camera (Leica model DC300) attached to a 2.5 GHz 
PC Pentium IV. 
B. Digitalized images capture 
The WSSV sample slide images were acquired by a 
novel computational image capture prototype system to 
enhance the digitalized images with novel autofocus and 
fusion techniques developed [23][24], running inside a 2.5 
GHz PC Pentium 4 with 1 GByte RAM and 80 GBytes HD 
attached to Leica microscope (model DMRXA2) equipped 
with a RGB color digital camera (Leica model DC300), as 
shown in Figure 4. 
A set of 168 microscope images were acquired from the 
shrimp’s tissues by 60x objetive with a 2088 x 1550 pixels 
color resolution digital camera; each representative field can 
contains about an average of 30 to 60 approximately 
inclusion bodies depending of the level of WSSV infection. 
Afterwards, a set of 870 WSSV inclusion body images were 
selected to build a filter bank with 100 most representative 
WSSV images obtaining the intensity spatial domain matrix 
data of each WSSV image to be analyzed; thus multispectral 
function

RESULTS 
In order to see if this technique is working with a good 
performance with the groups of representative inclusion 
bodies of WSSV with different morphological images, 
were analyzed with spectral signature index; their images 
and an additional group of non-infected tissue particles are 
shown in Figure 9; hence in Table 1 the statistical behavior 
values of the spectral signature index are shown, including 
the mean value 
 2SE
 (two standard errors).  
A set of 168 microscope image field samples were 
acquired without any additional preprocessing like 
illumination or contrast correction just the fusion 
technique developed by [24]; then from this set 870 
WSSV inclusion body images were cut, selecting 100 
most representative WSSV inclusion bodies to build a 
filter bank, afterwards every WSSV inclusion body pattern 
were analyzed to get their frequency measurement and 
addition to build the biogenic particle cluster by this 
spectral index.  
The great difference in the statistical values of the 
infected particles with the non infected particles is due to 
the behavior of WSSV inclusion bodies frequencies in the 
green channel complex plane, while the non-infected cells 
do not show similar frequency properties, the infected 
particles show a well determined frequency signature; in 
Figure 10 are presented some examples of these 
frequencies behavior. All the WSSV inclusion bodies were 
analyzed together; the results shows that the complete 
inclusion bodies group can be located in well defined 
fringe 1.3853

IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper presents a new technique to classify WSSV 
inclusion bodies from infected shrimp tissue image, based 
on the analysis of frequencies found in the green channel 
with K-Law non-lineal filter. 
Representative groups of WSSV inclusion bodies from 
infected shrimp tissues and organs were analyzed. The 
results show that inclusion bodies are well defined in a 
clear numerical fringe; thus it can be inferred that 
whatever analyzed particle with a spectral signature index 
kiss
 value outside of 1.3853
2.1143
 ssi

 range can be 
considered as non-infected particle. 
Future work can be done in the development of 
automatic WSSV identification system applying this 
spectral index classifier; however this kind of classifier 
can be extended by combining complementary frequency 
analysis techniques by Fourier related filters on the 
calculation of the spectral signature index to obtain better 
discriminating results. 
Experiments with new tissue samples can be done from 
others shrimps organs where the virus has a different 
pattern and its identification is more complex. 
Finally, the potential of this signature index can be 
used to classify other kind of shrimp’s viruses and/or other 
animal, human viruses or biogenic particles.
