Abstract— Due to the rapid growth of information systems that
manage temporal data, efficient and automated classification
techniques are of great importance. For instance, timely and
accessible temporal data enhances critical financial operations
such as predicting future stock prices. Similarly, in medical
domain, classifying temporal data, which is relevant to patients
or critical operations, leads to efficient control and recovery
from
severe
problems.
Therefore,
time
is
an
essential
dimension to many domain-specific problems. This research
introduces Temporal-ROLEX; a framework to categorize
temporal data that effectively induces semantic temporal
patterns.
This
paper
presents
an
efficient
rule-based
classification approach for categorizing temporal data. The
contributions of this research are 1) formulating Semantic
Temporal patterns as a basic classification features, and 2)
introducing an induction technique to discriminate semantic
temporal patterns. The proposed framework extends ROLEX-
SP approach to handle the classification of temporal data in
different domains. To illustrate the design, the article provides
a detailed mathematical description that relies on set-theory to
model the framework of Temporal-ROLEX. Furthermore, this
paper provides a detailed description of proposed algorithms
to facilitate implementing and reproducing the results. To
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
the
Temporal-ROLEX,
we
performed extensive experiments on a weather temporal
dataset. Also, the F-measure and support values on weather
dataset are reported as well as a scalability and sensitivity
analysis to assess the capability of Temporal-ROLEX to work
with
temporal
datasets.
Findings
indicate
a
significant
improvement
of
Temporal-ROLEX
over
some
existing
techniques.
Specifically,
Temporal-ROLEX
achieves
significant enhancement using sequential temporal pattern
over existing state-of-the-art techniques. On the other hand,
Temporal-ROLEX achieves average performance using hybrid
temporal patterns. Finally, the results have been analyzed and
justified the factors that affect the performance in both cases.

INTRODUCTION
Due to the rapid growth of information systems that
manage temporal data, efficient and automated classification
techniques of temporal data are of great importance. Time is
an essential dimension to many domain-specific problems
such as financial and medical domains. This paper presents
an
efficient
rule-based
classification
approach
for
categorizing temporal data. The contributions of this research
are 1) formulating Semantic Temporal patterns as a basic
classification features, and 2) introducing an induction
technique to discriminate semantic temporal patterns.
ROLEX-SP has been introduced by M. ALZamil and A.
Can [1] to categorize domain specific knowledge using
specialized rule-based induction and learning methods to
produce
efficient
classification
of
domain
specific
knowledge. ROLEX-SP automates the induction and the
learning
processes
by
extracting
lexical
patterns
and
constructing specialized form of association rules. Such
technique handles the problems of multiclass classification
and feature imbalance problems. This research introduces
Temporal-ROLEX; a framework to categorize temporal data
that effectively induces semantic temporal patterns
Temporal-ROLEX
is
intended
to
find
temporal
relationships such as: during, after, overlap, start, finish and
equal. However, it defines a form of association rules that
generate not only efficient patterns to classify events, but
also minimize the margin error to enhance the overall
performance of the classification task. Figure 1 shows during
temporal event, in which event e1 starts and finishes during
the execution of event e2. The work in this paper is restricted
to during relationship, since it is able to represent hybrid
relations among temporal events. In other words, a hybrid
relationship is able to describe before and after relationships.

RELATED WORK
Attempts have been made to construct temporal features
in order to construct association rules such as those discussed
in Bruno and Garza [2], Miao et al. [3], and Chiang et al. [4].
In Bruno and Garza [2], association rules have been
developed to cope with outlier detection using functional
quasi dependency. The technique does not model time-delay
as a part of association rules. The delta function that
associate two temporal attributes X and Y assumes no delay.
The technique in Bruno and Garza [2] handled time-delay
explicitly, which affect the overall performance as well as
efficiency of the classification process; which is not crucial
in outlier detection task.
Chiang et al. [4] have proposed a mathematical model to
extract temporal patterns to track customer buying habits.
The model is developed to capture temporal characteristics
of business data in single-point-of-time events. Our proposed
methodology focuses on time intervals as well as single point
of time events. Similarly, our proposed technique benefits
from the formal definition in [4], in that we formulate the
temporal patterns using similar mathematical aspects.
Zhang et al. [5] have proposed a method to extract during
temporal patterns. A during temporal pattern (DTP) is a
special case of interval temporal patterns. These patterns
provide
valuable
information
in
broadcasting
future
information such as weather and stock broadcasting. Kong et
al. [6] have presented the notion of multi temporal patterns
using predicates: before, during, equal and overlap.
Winarko and Roddick [7] have Introduced ARMADA, an
algorithm
to
discover
interval
time
temporal
rules.
ARMADA research asserts that time-stamps relationships
such as during could be more useful than solid time interval.
Classifying
time-interval
events
into
temporal
clusters
provide meaningful information in different application areas
such as financial analysis and weather broadcasting. Unlike
ARMADA association rules, our work relies on discovering
hybrid temporal rules that could be represented using during
relation.
Although
performance
plays
a
significant
role
in
assessing classification techniques, pre-processing tasks
might be crucial in many applications in terms of scalability
and efficiency. However, temporal datasets dimensions are
characterized as huge ones. Techniques to reduce such
dimensionality are important to produce scalable temporal
mining
systems.
We
applied
methods
in
Stacey
and
McGregor [8] and Wang and Megalooikonomou [9] to
reduce the dimensionality of time series.
In the literature, there are many data mining and
knowledge discovery techniques on medical domain and
biomedical data [10, 11, 12, 13]. The contribution of this
article over existing ones is the ability of Temporal ROLEX
to handle timely information regardless of its domain.
Further, the method proposed in this article deals with time
as a classification feature. The later might negatively affect
the classification performance, but it adds the advantage of
enhancing timely information classification

and the assigned label of a class do not affect
the labeling of other classes. For instance, an
event might be classified under during class and
overlap class at the same time if this event
belongs to different set of events.

EXPERIMENT AND ANALYSIS
In this section, the results have been collected from
applying Temporal-ROLEX on a weather dataset. The data
set has been obtained from a weather station in Jordan in
2009. The dataset consists of 14 attributes: wind direction,
average wind speed, maximum wind gust, average hourly
temperature, percentage relative humidity, global hourly
radiation, hourly sunshine duration, hourly precipitation
duration, hourly precipitation amount, horizontal visibility,
fog, snow, etc. Most of the collected values were continuous.
To proceed, the pre-processing techniques to discriminate
and convert the records into temporal ones have been
applied, which are consisting of event name, start time, end
time, and state.
A.
F-Measure
First, we compute the recall and precision values relevant
to every category according to the following formulas:

The results indicate that Temporal-ROLEX achieves

Temporal-ROLEX achieves significant enhancement using
sequential temporal pattern over existing state-of-the-art
techniques on the same dataset such as DTP [16] that
achieve 66.2%. On the other hand, Temporal-ROLEX
achieves
average
performance
using
hybrid
temporal
patterns; i.e., 63.7 while DTP achieve 65.1%. The results
have been analyzed and justified the factors that affect the
performance in both cases
B.
Sensitivity Analysis
In order to evaluate the results, the analysis task
considers four sensitivity attributes, which measure the
quality of empirical results. These attributes include the
number of valid patterns, the effect of rules on average F-
measure, the execution time versus number of rules, and the
execution time versus the number of events.

rules, the higher the f-measure. This property demonstrates
that in order to achieve high performance, the induction
algorithm has to be fed with large training set to produce
rules that cover all, or at least, most patterns.

CONCLUSION
This
paper
presented
a
rule-based
method
for
categorizing temporal records. The contributions of this
research are 1) formulating Semantic Temporal patterns as a
basic classification features, and 2) introducing an induction
technique
to
discriminate
semantic
temporal
patterns.
Experiments have been performed on a weather dataset in
order to evaluate the proposed method and compare our
work with well known algorithms in the literature. Findings
indicate a significant improvement of Temporal-ROLEX
over a well known technique; DTP. Specifically, Temporal-
ROLEX achieve significant enhancement using sequential
temporal pattern. On the other hand, Temporal-ROLEX
achieves
average
performance
using
hybrid
temporal
patterns.
Furthermore, Temporal-ROLEX achieved statistically
significant improvement. Applying syntactic patterns, both
positive and negative, enhances the accuracy of Temporal-
ROLEX over the other method.
The article also provided a sensitivity analysis to the
performance of Temporal-ROLEX as a function to the
number of association rules and the number of data elements
in the training set. The results indicated that Temporal-
ROLEX was affected by the number of rules positively. On
the
other
hand,
the
observations
during
experiments
indicated that the number of records in the training set does
not affect the overall performance of the learning process.
