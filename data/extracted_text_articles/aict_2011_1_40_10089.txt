Abstract—The Carrier Super-Positioning Satellite System is
a promising telecommunication system because the efﬁciency
of frequency usage is twice as much of that in existing satellite
systems. Interference canceller used in the carrier super-
positioning system is greatly effected by the nonlinear distortion
of satellite TWTA. A scheme of the nonlinearity compensation
for P-MP VSAT network has been proposed by us before. In
this paper we propose and verify a new method to compensate
the nonlinearity of satellite TWTA for P-P system to improve
the interference canceller for the Carrier Super-Positioning
System.
Keywords-satellite; frequency reuse; nolinear compensation;
interference canceller.
I. INTRODUCTION
As the trafﬁc demand for high speed data and images
increases, effective utilization of frequency resources of
satellite communications is more important than ever. Carrier
super-positioning is a promising telecommunication system
for frequency reuse since the frequency efﬁciency becomes
double that of existing satellite systems. In this system
outbound signal (outgoing from the station) and the inbound
signal (incoming to the station) can use common frequency
band which are conventionally used in separate bands. In
this system, the signal sent from the station becomes the
interference to the station itself, and the interference shall
be removed by the interference canceller which is discussed
in this paper.
The interference canceller is realized by generating its
replica and subtracting it from the received signal [1]-[5].
In this process, some parts of the interference remaine
not cancelled unless the waveform of generated replica
is exactly the same as that of interference. One of the
major reasons of the difference comes from the nonlinear
distortion which the received signals suffer from the satellite
transponder TWTA (Traveling Wave Tube). The effects of
the nonlinear TWTA on to the conventional communications
systems have ever been reported[6][7]. On the other hand,
the effects of the nonlinearity on the canceller performance
have been reported by us in the previous papers [8]. And a
method has been proposed to compensate the nonlinearity by

intentionally giving same nonlinearity to the replica as that
of satellite TWTA. This method is , however, applicable only
to the P-MP VSAT system in which the power of outbound
signal in much large than that of inbound[9][12].
In this paper, we will show the nonlinear compensation
method in the P-P system in which the power of both
inbound and outbound signal in the same.
One network is composed of two large Hub stations. And
a wide band outbound(OB) carrier is sent from the Hub to
another wider band inbound(IB) carriers are from another,
to the Hub. This is called a point-to-point network. Figure
1 shows the point-to-point network.

II. EFFECTS OF NONLINEARITY
In the satellite communications, the transponder TWTA
is preferably operated in the region of saturation in order
to use power effectively. Then, the signals ampliﬁed there
suffer from the effects of inter-modulation and distortion
due to the AM/AM and AM/PM conversion. Figure 2
shows a typical nonlinear characteristics of the TWTA used
in the conventional communications satellite. In the case
of a carrier superposed system, two or more carriers are
commonly ampliﬁed. Figure 3 shows a vector diagram of
input and output signals through the TWTA. Composite
signal (a) of outbound(OB) and inbound(IB) is provided to
TWTA and converted to the TWTA output signal (b). If the
power of OB is large enough in comparison with IB, the
conversion which the composite signal(a) is received by the
nonlinearity is the same as that by which OB is received.
On the other hand, it is not true in such system that the
power of IB is not smaller enough than OB like point-to-
point network.
As mentioned, the difference between received OB and
its replica becomes interference. And if the received OB
is distorted by the nonlinearity of TWTA, it causes the
difference between received OB and its replica.
III. NONLINEARITY COMPENSATION
As described above, interference power is generated due
to the nonlinear distortion of unwanted signal (OB). Our
purpose in this study is to compensate the distortion. We take
different approaches for two types of networks. First, it is for
the VSAT system in which the power level of OB is much
higher than those of IBs. In this system, the distortion which
the composite signal suffers from the nonlinearity is almost
the same as the distortion which OB signal suffers from.
In this case, therefore, major part of the difference between
received unwanted signal and its replica is removed by inten-
tionally giving the same nonlinearity to the replica[9][12].
Secondly, the approach took for point-to-point network is,
Figure 4.
Interference canceller-introduced nonlinear compensations
as shown in Figure4, to put the compensator which has
inverse nonlinear characteristics of the TWTA in front of
the canceller since we can not apply same approach to P-P
system as in the VSAT system where we give nonlinearity
to the replica. Here we call replica compensation for the P-
MP system and post compensation for the P-P system. The
detailed conﬁgurations and the effects of both approaches
are then discussed.
A. Replica compensation
Here, we refer the method and the effect of replica
compensation shown in the reference [9] and [12]. This
approach is to compensate the distortion by intentionally
giving the same distortion to the replica. Figure 4 shows
the conceptual block diagram of replica compensation. The
upper side of this block diagram is the path where the
received signals (OB+IB) are provided to the canceller. The
lower path is to generate the replica of OB by demodulating
received signal. The output of the demodulator is then
fed to the nonlinearity. This function is achieved not by
adding actual non-linear devices such as a Sohottky diode
but by a numerical approach of signal processing in a
degital ﬁlter and does therefore not impact signiﬁcantly on
the hardware size. Here the issue is how to estimate the
nonlinear characteristics of satellite TWTA in the replica
generator of the canceller unit. It is not difﬁcult to know
the satellite TWTA nonlinearity itself by getting the data of
the transponder from the satellite operator. Also, there are
not so many variations in the nonlinear characteristics in the
same class of TWTA. However, even though it is possible
to know nonlinear characteristics, we still have to know the
operating point (back off) of the satellite TWTA in order to
give the same nonlinearity to the replica because the effects
of nonlinearity on to the signals depends greatly on the
operating level (back off) of the ampliﬁer. Furthermore, the
uplink power to the satellite frequently deviates due to the
rain attenuation or other reasons. It is therefore mandatory
for the nonlinearity compensation to have a function which
automatically tracks the operating level of the transponder.

Namely adaptive back off function is mandatory. Figure
5 and 6 show the effects of replica compensation. The
extrated carrier to interference ratio is improved by about 10
dB(Figure 5) and half of the BER degradation is improved
in dB as shown in Figure 6.

In this method, it is assumed that the nonlinear char-
acteristics given to the replica is the same as that of
satellite TWTA for both amplitude and phase. However,
it is important to investigate the effects of the difference
between two nonlinearities. We think it is not difﬁcult to
adopt same amplitude nonlinearity of the replica as that of
the satellite TWTA since it is not difﬁcult to get precise
data of the amplitude nonlinearity of the TWTA Then, we
have investigated the effects in case some difference exists
between two phase nonlinearities. As shown in these ﬁgures,

(refer to [12])
it can be said that the change of phase nonlinearity up to
+20 and -15 % does not give signiﬁcant degradation to the
performance of nonlinearity compensator.
B. Post compensation
As mentioned, the replica compensation is useful only
when the unwanted OB signal level is much higher than
wanted IB signals. We propose here another method to
compensate distortion which the received signals (composite
of both OB and IBs) suffer from the satellite nonlinearity.
By this approach, the distortion should be basically removed
from the received signal regardless the relation between OB
and IB levels.

nonlinearity. Phase and amplitude of a vector is converted

(twisted) according to the AM/PM and AM/AM conversion
characteristics of TWTA respectively. Our method is to put
the inverse characteristics of the nonlinearity at the canceller
input. It is theoretically expected that large part of the
distortion can be removed from the received signal before it
is provided to the canceller. By this operation, the twisted
vector should be stretched as shown in Figure 8. But it shall
be notiﬁed, in this case, that the inverse operation for the
amplitude conversion (AM/AM) increases the noise since
this operation is to expand larger portion of amplitude of
the received signals which contain thermal noise.
1) Theory of post compensation: Lets assume the non-
linear characteristics of the TWTA as , where r is the input
signal of TWTA, then the output of TWTA can be expressed
by,

Inverse Nonlinear Characteristics of TWTA
In the carrier superposed network, the satellite input signal
is the summation of outbound signal (A) and inbound signal
(B). Therefore the satellite output signal is obtained by,
y = g(A + B)

Our proposal is to put inverse nonlinear characteristics
g−1(y) at the receiver input, then the original signal A+B
can be principally attained by
A + B = g−1(y)

The input-output characteristics of the path is shown in

shown in Figure 9.
2) Simulation results: Figure 11 and 12 show the results
of computer simulation. The post compensation improves
BER by about 1 ～ 1.5 dB as shown these ﬁgures. Figure
13 shows the effects of post compensation for two case
of TWTA operation points. As shown in Figure 13, large
improved can be expected for small input back off.
IV. CONCLUSION
This paper proposes a new nonlinearity compensation
method for the interference canceller used in carrier super-
positioning point to point(P-P) satellite system. In this
system, both inbound and outbound signals are transmitted
in the same frequency band and therefore the interference
canceller that subtracts the unwanted signal from received
signal is required. However, the ampliﬁer used at satellite,

high input level. To compensate this nonlinear distortion,
received signal is deformed with reverse characteristics of
TWTA to achieve nondistorted signal. Also, the method
which is applicable to P-MP VSAT can not be applied
to this case. Therefore we proposed here post compensa-
tion method. In this paper, this method is evaluated with
computer-based simulation and the result shows that it is
able to decrease the effect of nonlinearity which is distorted
at satellite’s TWTA. For future work, we must check if this

The BER data shown here are now under the further study
since these are the case in the simpliﬁed transmission path
which does not include ﬁlters in the down link. (satellite
