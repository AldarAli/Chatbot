Abstract—Personal Health Records (PHRs) have the potential
to dramatically contribute to healthcare as they enable patient
to become more involved and engaged in their care. However,
PHRs are rather limited in that they assume all its content to
be restricted on health-oriented personal data. Yet there are a
lot of related data that are stored in other systems, and which
use together with PHRs’ data would produce outcomes that
could not be achieved by functioning independently. Using
these data sources together with PHRs’ data we can achieve
new outcomes. How it can be carried out by using modern
Semantic Web technologies, such as Resource Description
Framework (RDF), Web Ontology Language (OWL) and
SPARQL,  and  our  designated  ontologies  is  the  topic  of  this
paper.  We  also  introduce  the  notion  of  SPARQL-affinity
domain, which allows the sharing of PHRs and other relevant
data in a controlled way over the Internet.

INTRODUCTION
Issues with combining heterogeneous data sources, under
a single query interface have existed from the early 1980s,
when computer scientists began designing systems for
interoperability of heterogeneous databases. Nowadays, at
the advent of the Semantic Web the issues with combining
data sources is still equally relevant as the Semantic Web
paradigm involves a broad set of modern technologies such
as Resource Description Framework (RDF) [1], Web
Ontology Language (OWL) [2] and SPARQL [3] that tackle
these issues.
A relevant issue is how these technologies can be used in
combining relevant external data sources with Personal
Health  Records  (PHRs)  [4].  A  PHR  is  a  record  of  a
consumer that includes data gathered from different sources
such as from health care providers, pharmacies, insures, the
consumer, and third parties [5]. It includes information about
medications, allergies, vaccinations, illnesses, laboratory and
other test results, and surgeries and other procedures [6]. It is
accessible to the patient and to those authorized by the
patient.
A problem of current PHRs is that they assume all its
content to be restricted on health-oriented personal data.
However, there are a lot of related data, which use together
with PHR data would produce outcomes that could not be
achieved by functioning independently.
Examples of such PHR-related personal data sources
include gyms, smart homes and personal note books. Gyms
store data that is gathered by sensor and training equipment.
Smart  homes  store  a  lot  of  data  related  to  heating,  air
conditioning, and personal well fare such as weight
measurements.  Personal note books may include a variety of
useful information concerning working hours, meals and
location data.
Using  these  data  sources  together  with  PHRs’  data  we
can achieve new outcomes: For example, a person may be
interested to know his or her blood pressures when his or her
weight had maximal and minimum values. Also, a person
might be interested to know his or her cholesterol values
grouped by his or her daily training hours.
There are also a lot of public data sources, which use
together with personal data would produce outcomes that
would not be achieved by using only personal data. For
example, personal data may indicate the vaccinations of a
person, while public data source can augment this
information 
by more informal descriptions of the
vaccinations. Further, as public data sources are increasingly
linked among themselves according to the notion of the
Linked Data [7], the data sources that can be reached from
PHRs is increasing all the time.  For example, the open data
sources dealing with medicines or clinical guidelines [8] are
particularly useful when used with PHR-data.
Especially, clinical guidelines will have a key role in self-
care. They are documents with the aim of guiding decisions
and criteria regarding diagnosis, management, and treatment
in specific areas of healthcare [9]. They are based on an
examination of current evidence within the paradigm of
evidence-based medicine, which is one of the most important
developments in the clinical use of information over the last
decades [10]. Thus, the ability to reach clinical guidelines
from PHRs enable patient to become more involved and
engaged in their self-care.
However, a problem in combining external data sources
with PHRs is data heterogeneity: there is a variety data
models on which these data sources can be based on. For
example, a data source may be a relational database or an
XML-file. Further, the schemas of PHRs’ XML-files may be
ad hoc (e.g., the CCR standard of the American Society for
Testing and Materials (ASTM) [11]) or based on the
Reference Information Model (RIM) (e.g., the CCD standard
of the HL7 [12]).
Our solution for this heterogeneity problem is the use of
smart data. Smart data refers to data that is application-

independent, and part of a larger information ecosystem.
Furthermore RDF [1] is the key for representing smart data.
RDF is a directed, labeled graph data format for
representing information in the Web. It is not a data format,
but a data model with a choice of syntaxes for storing data
files [13]. In RDF, we can express facts with tree-part
statements known as triples. The subject identifies the thing
being described, predicate is a property name, and object is
property value. So, each triple is like a little sentence that
states a fact [14].
However, RDF in itself does not bring smartness. It
depends on the expression power of the used vocabulary. By
a vocabulary we refer to a set of ontologies, which formally
specifies the used terms and their semantics. The key point
here is that shared ontologies provide the ability of two or
more systems to exchange information and to use the
information that has been exchanged [15].
We will present ontologies that enable PHR system to
interoperate with other relevant data sources. We illustrate
these ontologies in a graphical way as well as in OWL. Data
sources (RDF-files) are queried by SPARQL and these
queries are processed by SPARQL processors [16].
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: First, in
Section II, we introduce the notion of the SPARQL-affinity
domain, which is the key concept in our designed system.
The ontologies of the SPARQL-affinity domain are
introduced in Section III. Then, in Section IV we present our
used method for designing ontologies from XML-schemas.
Especially we present how we have developed the Personal
Health Ontology from the XML-schema of the Continuity of
Care (CCD) documents. We present the Personal Health
Ontology in a graphical way as well as in OWL. How we can
query PHR-data and other external RDF-formatted data in
one SPARQL query is considered in Section V. An example
of presenting an ontology instance in RDF is given in
Section VI. Finally, Section VII concludes the paper.
II.
SPARQL-AFFINITY DOMAIN
SPARQL is an RDF query language to retrieve and
manipulate data stored in RDF format. The name SPARQL
is a recursive acronym for SPARQL Protocol and RDF
Query Language, which is described by a set of
specifications from the W3C [3].  SPARQL Protocol refers
to the rules for how a client program and a SPARQL
processor exchange SPARQL queries and results. There is a
variety of SPARQL processors available for running queries
against data both locally and remotely [16].
In our architecture, RDF formatted data stores that agree
to work together for data sharing are called a SPARQL-
affinity domains (Figure  1).  Its  data  stores  agree  on  a
common set of policies such as how the data stores are
accessed by web services, how users are identified, and how
the access is controlled. However, the used policy is data
store specific.  For example, in the case of personal data,
(such  as  with  PHR-data,  welfare  data,  and  personal  note
book) a strict access policy is followed while in the case of
public data sources (such as with public medicine data) no
access control is needed. The access policy of smart home
data can be defined case-by-case.

Each  server  provides  a  SPARQL  endpoint  [3].  A
SPARQL endpoint is a web service that accepts SPARQL
queries, runs the queries, and then returns the results. The
way how multiple endpoints can be remotely processed in a
SPARQL query is more detailed considered in Section V.
III.
ONTOLOGIES IN SPARQL-AFFINITY DOMAIN
Each data source in the SPARQL-affinity domain is
comprised of RDF-triples. These data sources are based on
an ontology, i.e., these ontologies provide a vocabulary for
these triples.
In computer science, an ontology is a general vocabulary
of a certain domain, and it can be defined as “an explicit
specification of a conceptualization” 17]. Essentially the
used ontology must be shared and consensual terminology as
it is used for information sharing and exchange.
Essentially ontology tries to capture the meaning of a
particular subject domain that corresponds to what a human
being knows about that domain [18]. It tries to characterize
that meaning in terms of concepts and their relationships. It
is typically represented as classes, properties, attributes and
values. 
Depending 
on 
the 
generality 
level 
of
conceptualization, different types of ontologies are needed
[19]. Each type of ontology has a specific role in information
sharing and exchange.
As an example consider a simplified Welfare Ontology,
which is graphically presented in Figure 2.  It comprises a
vocabulary that a person can use in describing his or her
personal welfare information. Hence, we do not assume that
a person uses all the terms of the vocabulary (ontology). For
example, datatype properties Father and Mother are included
in the vocabulary, but the person does not have to give
values for these properties. Neither the person needs class

TRANSFORMING THE CCD-SCHEMA INTO PHR-
ONTOLOGY
If an original data source of a SARQL-affinity domain is
not in RDF, then we have to developed an appropriate
ontology, and then transform the original data in the form,
which is consistent with the developed ontology. For
example, the data of most PHRs are based on the Continuity
of Care Record (CCR) -standard [11] or CCD-standard [12],
and therefore, we have developed an appropriate ontology,
called the PHR-Ontology for these standards (XML-
schemas).
Both CCR and CCD standards represent two different
XML schemas designed to store patient clinical summaries.
Both schemas are identical in their scope in the sense that
they contain the same data elements such as demographics,
medications laboratory results [20]. However, the structures
the two XML schemas are quite different. Anyway the use of
XML assures that the data contained in CCR or CCD
documents can be expressed in multiple media formats that
are friendly to both consumers and providers.
The CCD specification is a constraint on the HL7 CDA
standard. The CCD standard has been endorsed by HIMMS
(Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society
Though) 
[21] 
and 
HITSP 
(Healthcare 
Information
Technology Standards Panel) [22] as the recommend
standard for exchange of electronic exchange of components
of health information.
Although the original purpose of the CCD documents
was to deliver clinical summaries between healthcare
organizations, nowadays it increasingly used for other types
of messages: it is increasingly considered as set of templates
because all its parts are optional, and it is practical to mix
and match the sections that are needed [23].
In  transforming  the  XML  schema  of  the  CCD  file  to
OWL-ontology we have used the following rules:
1.
The complex elements of the XML-schema are
transformed into OWL classes.
2.
The simple elements of the XML-schema are
transformed into OWL data properties such that the
complex element is the domain of the da-ta
properties.
3.
The attribute of the XML-schema are transformed
into OWL data properties.
4.
The relationships between complex elements must
be named and transformed to OWL object
properties.
To illustrate this transformation consider the following
example of a CCD document.
<SimplifiedCCDfile>
    <DocumentID>DOC_123</DocumentID>

        <PatientID>AB-12345></PatientID>

Figure 6.
A simple PHR -Ontology in OWL.
Note that Figure 5 and Figure 6 represent only the
portion 
of the PHR-Ontology that correspond the
Medications section of the CDD. The whole PHR-Ontology
is comprised of the integration of the ontologies derived
from all sections of the CDD. In such integration we do not
have to take care of semantic heterogeneity (i.e., one term is
used in different meanings, or two terms are used in same
meaning) as the all the elements in CDD documents are
based on the HL7 RIM [24].
Note that querying PHR-data together with Medication
data instead of querying only PHR-data we can achieve more
expressive queries on patient’s medication. For example, we
can query the links of the web pages that provide information
about the medications that are included in patient’s
medication. The ways multiple data sources can be queried
in a SPARQL-affinity domain is the topic of the next section.
V.
QUERYING DATA SOURCES BY SPARQL
A typical SPARQL query specifies the pieces of
information that meets the stated conditions. The conditions
are described with triple patterns, which are similar to RDF
triples but may include variables to add flexibility in how
they match against the data.
SPARQL provides two ways for querying remotely:
using FROM keyword or using SERVICE keyword [3]. In
the former way the FROM keyword names a dataset to query
that may be local or remote file. In the latter way, instead of
pointing at an RDF file somewhere, a SPARQL endpoint is
pointed. A SPARQL endpoint is a web service that accepts
SPARQL queries, runs the queries, and then returns the
result.
Federated Queries in SPARQL allow searching multiple
datasets with one query [16]. For each dataset it is created a
subquery  which  access  datasets  by  using  SERVICE
keywords.  That is, federated SPARQL queries make use of
subqueries and SERVICE keywords. To illustrate this
consider the federated SPARQL query presented in Figure 7,
which accesses two data sets  The query is based on the
PHR-Ontology presented in Figure 5, and on the Medicine
Ontology presents in Figure 3. Prefix med in the query refers
to the PHR-Ontology while prefix phr refers to the Medicine
Ontology.

The use case behind the query is the following: Nancy
Smith is interested to know whether her medicines are
substitutable with cheaper ones. Processing this query
requires first to retrieve Nancy’s used medicines from her
PHR, and then querying the Medicine data set (a public
RDF-formatted data source based on the Medicine
Ontology).
As illustrated in Figure 7, the first subquery returns the
medication 
identifications 
(medicineIds) 
of 
Nancy’s
medication, which in turn is the input parameter for the
second subquery. This subquery first finds the active
substance of Nancy’s medicines, and then checks which
other medicines include the same active substance (i.e., are
substitutable). Finally, the main query outputs the medication
identifications and the prices of these medicines.
This kind of cross-referencing feature is very useful in
the SPARQL affinity domain as there is a variety of needs to
cross-reference data from multiple data sources.
VI.
REPRESENTING SMART DATA BY RDF
In order that RDF data can be represented and
transmitted it needs a concrete syntax, which is given in
XML, i.e., RDF statements are usually coded in XML.
Hence, RDF inherits the benefits associated with XML.
However, other syntactic representations (e.g., Turtle [25])
are also possible, meaning that XML-based syntax is not a
necessary component of the RDF model.
One  RDF  description  may  contain  one  or  more  RDF
statements about an object. For example, in Figure 8, the
description concerning Mary Taylor’s weight measurement
(identified by “weightmeasurement100820151028”) contains
five RDF statements: the first states that its type in the
Welfare Ontology is WeightMeasurement, and the second
states that it measures Mary Taylor.
<rdf:RDF
 xmlns : rdf=”http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#”
  xmlns : po=http://www.helsinki.fi/Welfare_Ontology#>
<rdf:Description rdf:about=”weightmeasurement100820151028”>
              <rdf:type rdf:resource=“&po;WeightMeasurement”/>
     <po : Measures>Mary Taylor</po : Measures>

      <po : Time >10:28</po:Time>
                  <po : Value >68.7</po:Value>

CONCLUSION
Internet has changed the way people work, bank and
shop, but a similar change in health care has been small-
scale. However, the use of Internet-based e-health tools is
rapidly increasing. These tools cover many fields including
electronic 
health 
records, 
personal 
health 
records,
telemedicine, evidence based medicine, information therapy
and disease management.
Still a problem is that the each e-health tool has its own
interfaces and data sources. By integrating the e-health tools
we can achieve two gains: simplify user interaction and
provide new more advanced services. In particular there are a
lot of related data that are stored in other systems, and which
use together with PHRs’ data would produce outcomes that
could not be achieved by functioning independently. Using
these data sources together with PHRs’ data we can achieve
new outcomes. Further, the Semantic Web paradigm
involves a broad set of modern technologies such as RDF,
OWL and SPARQL that can tackle the issues with
combining heterogeneous data sources.
In this paper, we have restricted on considering the
SPARQL affinity domain as a technical infrastructure.
However, to succeed the SPARQL affinity domain should
not be considered just as a technical infrastructure but rather
as ecosystems having many interconnected parts. Other key
components of the whole ecosystem include governance
regulations, financing and stakeholders. In our future work,
we will restrict ourselves on analyzing the dependencies of
these components.
