Abstract — Diseases promoted by biotic or abiotic agents, 
characterized by a fast spreading rate and absence of 
symptomatology, are affecting plant species and crops of huge 
economic and/or forestall impact worldwide. The standard 
technique to diagnose diseases is the symptoms visualization by 
skilled personal, which is only accessible in the last stages of 
these diseases. As a restriction action, the plant, which is 
considered affected by a disease, is cut and burn along with 
neighbouring trees, even if these do not show evidence of the 
disease. Equipment and techniques able of assessing and 
characterizing the physiological state of plants in vivo and in 
situ, both in the diagnosis of diseases and also as a mean for 
supporting physiological studies, is clearly lacking. Herein is 
proposed the usage of impedance techniques to assess the 
physiological state of plants. Emphasis is given to the 
assessment of the hydric stress level of plants and its relation 
with the disease condition. To accomplish the study, a portable 
electrical impedance spectroscopy system was designed 
attending the biological application purpose.  The procedure 
and the results obtained for three different species (Pinus 
pinaster Aiton, Castanea sativa Mill, and Jatropha Curcas L) of 
relevant economical and/or forestall interest is also presented 
in order to show the potential of this technique and system.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Living trees, bushes, or other types of plants, are 
affected by several diseases, which are caused by biological 
agents (for example: fungus, virus, bacteria, nematodes, 
insects) and/or adverse environmental conditions (promoted, 
for 
example, 
by: 
droughts, 
fires, 
extreme 
heat, 
contamination of soil, and air) [1], [2]. It may be important 
to assess the health state (or, in other words, the 
physiological state) of plants, especially when plant crops 
affected by such diseases and/or environmental conditions 
have economical and/or forestall impact [1]. Currently, there 
are several known diseases affecting specific crops of 
economic importance in certain regions of the planet [1]. 
For the scope of this paper and the corresponding study, it 
may be referred, for instance: 1) the pinewood nematode 
disease  (PWD), affecting mostly the Pinus pinaster Aiton 
specie, which has spread worldwide with special relevance 
in Portugal, Japan and USA; 2) the ink disease in the 
chestnuts, caused by a fungus, which is affecting crops in 
Europe; and 3) the esca disease in the grapevines, caused by 
an association of fungus, which also has spread throughout 
the planet [1]. The major problem inherent to the referred 
diseases, whether they are caused by fungus, nematodes or 
other biotic agent (or, even not being the case, eventually by 
abiotic agents), is their asymptomatic behavior and fast 
spread [1], [2], [3].  Additionally, these diseases have no 
cure properly developed and commercialized to date [1], 
[2], [3]. The main reason is the arising of new problems due 
to the application of the studied solutions, mainly based on 
phytopharmaceutical 
technology, 
such 
as: 
soil 
contamination, animal and vegetal species new and 
unpredictable problems (such as toxicity, diseases, and 
extinction), among others [2], [3].    
Although some instrumental prototypes were studied 
and patented, there is no defined methodology and accepted 
techniques to help to assist crops management in what 
concerns to the assessment of the physiological (or health) 
states of plants in situ [2], [3]. Actually, the golden standard 
method is the symptomatology visualization by skilled 
personnel [1], [2], [3]. The problem with this method is its

reduced effectiveness, since the external symptoms are only 
able of being visually accessible during the terminal stages 
of the referred diseases [1], [2]. At this point, it is no longer 
possible to control the disease and, usually, it has already 
spread all over the crop, even if the symptoms are not 
visible in all the specimens [2]. In order to avoid the fast 
spreading, the plant that is considered affected, is cut and 
destroyed along with the neighbouring plants [2]. This 
preventive act poses another problem: the deforestation and 
the resulting economic losses arising due to the massif 
felling.  
The characterization of physiological states of plants is 
also 
important 
in 
the 
perspective 
of 
marketing, 
consumption, and in researches for new plants’ applications 
such as the emergent production of biodiesels [1], [4], [5]. 
In every case it is lacking detailed, fast enough, and robust 
techniques [1], [5], since the available require expensive 
laboratory equipment and materials, are time consuming, 
and hard to implement [1], [2], [6]. 
Hereupon, it can be said that, in general, there is a lack 
of equipment and systems able of evaluate and characterize 
the physiological state of plants, as well as a reliable and 
expeditious technology to allow an assessment in situ [1].  
This overall described panorama was the main 
motivation for the present work [1]. Herein, the authors 
propose an Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) 
system, developed by the team, and the usage of impedance 
techniques to assess the physiological states of plants in situ 
[1].  
EIS has been proving efficacy and utility in a wide range 
of areas, from the characterization of biological tissues to 
living organisms [1], [7]. This passive electrical property, 
known as electrical impedance, is a measure of the 
opposition to the flow of an alternating current, which 
occurs when an external electric field is applied [1]. A 
current I crossing a section of material of impedance Z, 
drops the voltage V established between two given points of 
that section [1]. This yields the well-known generalized 
Ohm’s law: V=IZ, where V and I are, respectively, the 
voltage and current complex scalars and Z the complex 
impedance 
[1]. Therefore, 
the 
result 
of 
the 
EIS 
measurements is a set of complex values (magnitude and 
phase), of impedance versus frequency [1]. 
 Any biological material has its own electrical signature, 
whereby the physiological changes, due to diseases and 
nutritional or hydration levels, have direct influence in the 
impedance spectrum [1].  
The major contributors for the biological tissues 
impedance are the cell membranes and the intra- and 
extracellular fluids [1], [7]. To electrically represent a 
biological tissue it is generally used a circuit that consists of 
a parallel arrangement between a resistor, representing the 
extracellular fluid, and a second arrangement connecting a 
resistor, simulating the intracellular fluid, and a capacitor as 
the membrane [1], [8], [9]. The determination of the ohmic 
values of the intra- and extracellular fluids, and also the 
capacitive value of the membrane, can be achieved by 
means of the theoretical Cole model [1], [10]. In this model, 
the achieved impedance spectrum (resistance versus 
reactance) is named by Cole-Cole plot [10]. 
The phase angle and other interrelated indexes, such as 
the ratio between impedance at the lowest and at the highest 
frequencies the system can output, Z0/Z∞, [7], and the ratio 
between impedance at the lowest frequency the system can 
output and 50 kHz, Z0/Z50 [11], have been used to extract 
information about the physiological condition of biological 
materials. Work such the one being presented, where a deep 
study was carried out, the amount of data to be analyzed may 
hamper the use of the Cole model. The usage of the referred 
impedance indexes, and also the study of new ones, may be a 
lighter and equally valid approach. 
Currently, there are instruments commercially available 
with high precision and resolution that can operate within a 
frequency range from some Hz to tens of MHz [1], [7]. 
However, the degradation of the excitation signal, occurring 
at low and high frequencies (already above 100 kHz), 
affects the accuracy of the measurements [1], [7]. Besides, 
the existing equipment is unfeasible for in vivo [1], [7] and 
in field applications, since it consists in desktop instruments, 
such as impedance analyzers and LCR meters [1]. 
It is possible to excite the sample with a current and 
measure a voltage or do the exact opposite [1]. The choice 
of the most suitable source, current or voltage, is a topic that 
still remains in discussion [1]. Current sources (CS) provide 
more controlled means of signal injection [12] and present 
reduced noise due to spatial variation when compared with 
voltage sources (VS) [1], [13]. However, due to their output 
impedance degradation [13], CS accuracy decreases for high 
frequencies [1], [14]. For this reason and since the 
impedance measurements are only possible when current is 
linear with respect to the voltage applied [9], or vice-versa, 
CS need expensive high-precision components [15] and a 
limited bandwidth operation range [1], [14], [15]. On the 
other hand, although EIS systems based on VS are less 
accurate [15], they can be built with less expensive 
components [15] and operate over a larger frequency range 
[1], [14], [15]. 
The developed EIS system, presented also in this paper, 
is able to perform AC scans within a selectable frequency 
range [1] and it can drive either a current or a voltage signal 
to excite a biological sample in situ or in vivo. It also 
implements the phase sensitive detection (PSD) method, 
although the one used has a novel implication, which is 
presented in further section. The instrumentation was 
designed to be cost-effective and usable in several 
applications 
[1]. 
The

the 
main 
characteristics of the developed EIS system. 
This paper will present the most relevant studies obtained 
for three different plant species: pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton), 
cheastnut (Castanea sativa Mill) and Jatropha Curcas L. 
The choice of the plant species under study was substantiated 
by the economic and/or forestalls relevance they have. 
Chestnuts and pines have a crucial economic impact in our

country and are currently affected by uncontrolled diseases: 
the nematode disease, in the case of pine trees, and the ink 
disease, in the case of chestnut trees. Jatropha curcas, by 
other hand, is a tropical species, which seeds are being 
studied and used for biodiesel production. The available 
equipment to assess seeds quality is mainly constituted by 
heavy and expensive laboratorial instruments, which 
required methodology is time consuming and usually 
implies 
the 
usage 
of 
expensive 
materials/reagents. 
Accordingly, a true physiological assessment, based on a 
reliable technique, may help to assist the ongoing studies 
and contribute for the advance of its state of the art.  
The assessment of the hydric stress (HS) level and its 
relation with the disease condition was the main 
physiological state being focused on this work [1]. 
The HS refers the internal hydration condition of a plant 
and it is one of the most relevant parameters to assess 
physiological states [5]. This parameter takes special 
significance in the assessment of diseases, since water 
absorption by the plant is one of the physiological processes 
firstly and strongly affected during a biotic or abiotic 
disease condition [5]. 
The following sections of this paper are: 1) System 
Design, where the developed EIS system is presented in 
detail; 2) Assessment of the HS Level, which presents the 
method and the results obtained for the HS assessment for 
the three studied species; 3) Study of Disease Condition, 
which presents the method and the results obtained for the 
study of the nematode disease in Pinus pinaster specie; 4) 
Discussion, where results are explained with more detail; 
and 5) Conclusions, where the main obtained results is 
resumed.

SUMMARY OF SPECIﬁCATIONS OF THE EIS SYSTEM 
 
 
II. 
SYSTEM DESIGN 
In order to study the plants’ bioimpedance behaviour and 
extract conclusions from their physiological states, an EIS 
system was designed and built attending the requirements of 
portability, reliability, fast data assessment, and accessible 
methodology. 
A. General Description 
The developed EIS system employs three main modules: 
signal conditioning unit, acquisition system (PicoScope® 
3205A) and a laptop for data processing (Matlab® based 
software) [1] (see Figure 1).  
The digital oscilloscope PicoScope® 3205A synthesizes 
and provides the excitation AC signal to the conditioning 
unit (ADC function) [1]. It also digitizes both excitation and 
induction signals at high sampling rates (12.5 MSps) and 
transfers data to the computer via USB where it is stored [1].  
The signal conditioning unit receives the excitation AC 
signal, coming from the PicoScope®, and amplifies it to be 
applied, through an electrode, to the sample under study [1]. 
The induced AC signal is collected by a second electrode, 
which redirects it to the conditioning unit, where it is 
amplified. Both excitation and induced signals are conduced 
to the PicoScope® to be digitized [1].

sample; 2) electrodes; 3) short coaxial cables; 4) EIS system conditioning 
unit and acquisition system, with the Picoscope®3205A incorporated; 5) 
laptop/PC. 
The EIS system is able to generate both voltage and 
current signals. An external switch allows the user to select 
one of these two sources of excitation leads to optimal data. 
The specifications of both excitation modes are described 
below. 
B. Design Specifications 
Already studied by Seoane, Bragós and Lindecrantz, 
2006 [16], the current mode circuit employs the current-
feedback amplifier AD844 in a non-inverting ac-coupled CS 
configuration (see Figure 2) [1]. 
During the impedance measurements, the dc-blocking 
capacitor, between the source and the electrode, tends to 
charge due to residual DC currents [1], [15]. For this reason, 
the transimpedance output of the AD844 easily reaches the 
saturation [1]. To overcome this problem, it was 
implemented a DC feedback configuration, which maintains

the dc voltage at the output close to 0V, without 
compromising the output impedance of the source [1]. 
Therefore, the output current is maintained almost constant 
over a wide range of frequencies [1]. 
The high speed voltage-feedback amplifier LM7171 is 
employed in the voltage mode circuit (see Figure 2) [1]. 
Although it behaves like a current-feedback amplifier due to 
its high slew rate, wide unit-gain bandwidth and low current 
consumption, it can be applied in all traditional voltage-
feedback amplifier configurations, as the one used [1]. These 
characteristics allow maintaining an almost constant voltage 
output over a wide range of frequencies [1]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
Figure 2.  Schematic of the EIS system conditioning unit - 1) AC current 
source; 2) AC voltage source; 3) current/voltage sense. 
The high speed operational amplifier, LT1220 (see 
Figure 2), senses the current or voltage signals from voltage 
or current excitation modes, respectively [1]. It performs 
input with reduced offset voltage and it is able of driving 
large capacitive loads [1].  
The value of the gain, for both current and voltage 
excitation sources, can be changed in order to extend the 
range of impedance magnitude [1]. The transductance gain 
of the LT1220 is currently set to 5.1 kΩ [1]. This value 
actually defines the gain of the system, which is taken into 
account for the impedance data algorithmic calculation. This 
means that, since the gain values are known and also the 
amplitude of the AC excitation signal, V1, from the 
PicoScope® (see Figure 2), the EIS system is calibrated 
automatically by software [1]. 
C. PSD Method 
To assess the impedance phase shift it is implemented a 
digital Phase Sensitive Detection (PSD) method with a novel 
implication. As stated in the literature, the PSD method is a 
quadrature demodulation technique that implements a 
coherent phase demodulation of two reference (matched in 
phase and quadrature) signals [17]. It is also known that this 
method is preferable over others especially when signals are 
affected by noise [17].  
The signal from the Picoscope® that corresponds to the 
current, VI=Bsin(ωt+φ2),  is set as the reference signal. 
Since the phase of the signal VI is not controlled, it is easily 
understandable that it does not necessarily contain a null 
phase.  This statement remains valid whether VI is used to 
excite the sample, in the current mode, or whether it 
corresponds to the current passing through the sample, in the 
voltage mode. The signal from the Picoscope® that 
corresponds to the voltage, VV=A sin(ωt+φ1), also contains 
a non-null phase. Both amplitudes, A and B, are also 
different from each other and none equals to 1.  
The following block diagram, shown in Figure 3, 
supports the mathematics implicit in this novel PSD method.  
Along with the mathematical demonstration (not 
presented in this paper due to its extension), the developed 
PSD algorithm was tested with Matlab® for several phases 
and amplitudes, without the theoretical requirements (i.e., 
ensure that the reference signal has null phase at the origin 
and that its amplitude equals to 1 [17]). For all the tests it 
was showed an always corrected phase shift assessment, 
when compared to the results obtained for a reference signal 
with the theoretical characteristics (see Figure 4).

D. Electrodes and Cables 
The developed EIS system employs two beryllium 
cooper gold platted needles as electrodes, each with around 
1.02 mm in diameter [1]. In order to reduce the dispersion of 
the surface current density flow [1], [10] and also to reduce 
damage on the biologic sample [1], the electrodes are 
inserted so lightly as possible (1 to 5 mm deep depending on 
the thickness of the cork). 
The electrodes are connected to the acquisition unit 
through coaxial cables. The employment of this type of 
cables is justified by the necessity to obtain an optimized 
signal-to-noise ratio [1]. However, coaxial cables introduce 
high equivalent parasitic capacitances, which promote phase 
shift errors, especially at high frequencies, during the 
bioimpedance measurements [1]. For this reason, the 
employed RG174 RF coaxial cables (capacitance of 100 
pF.m-1) are as short as possible (around 15 cm). It was also 
implemented the driven shield technique to the coaxial 
cables, which permits to partially cancel the capacitive 
effect, that otherwise is generated between the internal and 
the external conductors, by putting both at the same voltage 
[18]. Reductions in the capacitive effect of 20.4%, in the 
current mode, and around 35.8%, in the voltage mode, at the 
highest frequencies are verified. Figure 5 depicts the 
capacitive effect reduction by the usage of the driven shield 
technique.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5.  Bode and Cole-Cole diagram showing the reduction of cables 
capacitive effect by the application of the driven shield technique. The 
voltage mode excitation was used to analyze the circuit at the right top. The 
reduction is more noticeable at high frequencies where the capacitive 
effects have more influence. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 6.  Equivalent electric circuit of all parasitic elements affecting 
impedance measurements of a load, ZLOAD. The effect of the stray 
capacitances from cables, CCABLE, is minimized by the driven shield. Other 
stray capacitance effect, CSTRAY, due primarily to the phase shift of 
amplifiers, can be minimized by software. 
The phase shift occurred due to capacitive effects is not 
only promoted by cables, but also by the amplifiers [1]. The 
cumulative effect of the phase shift errors outcomes in an 
inflexion point in the impedance spectra that occurs at high 
frequencies (see Figure 5) [1].  
This type of error affects not only the phase at high 
frequencies, but also the impedance magnitude, which 
presents a typical decline shown at the Bode diagrams (see 
Figure 5) [1]. In the developed EIS system, the slight decline 
of the impedance magnitude is due to the loss of the product 
gain-bandwidth of the LT1220 for high frequencies [1].  
The equivalent electric circuit of such a system foresees 
this capacitive effect behavior, which is represented through 
an extra capacitor, called stray capacitance, placed in parallel 
with the load in analysis [1]. It is considered that stray 
capacitances induce systematic errors since their effect is 
present in all measurements.  Although the results are not 
greatly affected by the influence of stray capacitances, it is 
opportune to be aware of the real equivalent circuit (see 
Figure 6). By this way, it is possible to consider and/or 
discount the effect of all parasitic elements where justified. 
 
III. 
ASSESSMENT OF HYDRIC STRESS LEVEL  
The HS level was one of the studied impedance 
parameters due to its significance, as explained in Section I. 
Below are presented the used materials and methods, along 
with the main results. 
A. Materials and Methods 
For assessing EIS profiles and studying the HS level the 
following specimens were used: 1) eight young healthy pine 
trees (Pinus pinaster Aiton), with about 0.8 meters tall and 1 
to 2 centimeters in diameter; 2) eight young healthy 
chestnuts trees (Castanea sativa Mill), with about 0.5 meters 
tall and 1 to 2 centimeters in diameter; and 3) eight young 
healthy Jatropha Curcas L. trees, with about 0.2 meters tall 
and 3 to 4 centimeters in diameter [1]. 
The populations of different plant species were kept under 
controlled environment conditions – temperature (27 – 30 
ºC), luminosity, soil content and watering – in order to 
reduce the quantity of variables that may change the EIS 
profiles [1]. 
A portable EIS system version was employed to perform 
the EIS measurements. The electrodes were placed in the

above the soil, in the case of the pine and chestnut trees, and 
about 10 cm above de soil, in the case of Jatropha curcas 
(since these specimens were shorter in height) [1]. It was 
used the voltage mode of excitation [1], since the achieved 
impedance signals were cleaner for this mode (i.e., optimal

ratio

to 
better

was selected to accomplish the EIS analysis [1], since this 
frequency range has been shown to be sufficiently wide for 
studying these species. 
 Routine acquisitions took place between 11 a.m. and 1 
p.m. since it was already verified in previous studies that at 
this time period the trees’ impedance is lower and presents 
less variation (see Figure 7, for example) [1].  
To study the HS level variation, EIS monitoring was 
performed over 8 months, for one individual at a time, and 
for each plant species [1]. After understanding the variation 
of the EIS profile of regularly watered plants, the specimen 
being monitored was kept without watering during a period 
of a time (usually 3 to 4 weeks). When the HS effects were 
visible through external plant morphology symptoms, the 
specimen was regularly watered again to avoid the dead of 
the biologic material. In the case of the studied pines, the 
visualization of external symptoms was only possible near 
the time the specimen was about to die (which precluded the 
recovery of some individuals). For this reason, the variation 
of the water abstinence time period (WAP) and the plant 
response to it, measured by the EIS system, was one of the 
main focuses of this study. 
B. Results 
Several impedance parameters were determined for each 
impedance spectrum, however only the main indexes, such 
as the index Z1/Z50, will be presented as results, due to paper 
space limitations and also because this is a parameter already 
studied in the literature [1]. The index 1 is used instead of the 
index 0, as stated in the Introduction section, which 
corresponds to the lowest frequency analyzed by the system 
(1 kHz) [1].  
The time continuous measurements allowed revealing a 
daily oscillation of the EIS profiles [1]. To verify this 
behaviour it was assessed the R1/R50 (R representing the 
magnitude module) for a period of 6 days [1]. A Fast Fourier 
Transform was determined for this ratio just to confirm that 
the rhythmic signal had a period of exactly 24 h [1]. A clear 
frequency value of 11.57 µHz, which corresponds to a 
frequency of 24 h, was founded [1]. This rhythmic signal 
was also perceptible for other studied indexes, although they 
are not presented in the paper.  
The higher values of the ratio R1/R50 correspond to the 
night period, where the luminance and temperature are 
lower in relation to the day period [1]. Furthermore, these 
studies and previous ones revealed that the variation of the 
impedance values is lower during the period where the 
illumination was higher (between 11 a.m. and 1p.m.).

Figure 8.  Variation of the R1/R50 ratio during the monitoring of a healthy 
chestnut without watering. The impedance values show a daily oscillation 
that is characteristic of the studied trees. The successive higher values of 
each cycle are due to the incrinsing level of HS. 
Data obtained for the EIS monitoring and the study of the 
HS level, revealed a consistent behavior for all the studied 
species: the R1/R50 ratio tends to increase with higher values 
of HS [1]. After introducing regular watering, the same 
parameter progressively tended to the typical values of 
hydrated trees [1]. This effect is much more visible in the 
chestnuts, i.e., the variation of impedance parameters due to 
HS is higher and faster for the chestnuts, when compared 
with pines [1].

after the normal impedance values restoration.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 10.  Variation of the R1/R50 index during the monitoring of a healthy 
Jatropha curcas (12 days). The initial WAP was 6 months, period after 
which the EIS measurements started. The plant was watered at the 4th and 
9th days of monitoring, points A) and B) respectively. It is visible the 
immediate response to watering and also an immediate rise of resistance 
after the normal impedance values restoration.  
In relation to Jatropha curcas it was observed a totally 
different behaviour. To achieve measurable and significant 
levels of HS it was necessary to leave the plant without 
watering during months (5 months at least).  After watering, 
the response of the plant was instantaneous, even faster than 
the chestnut response. However, depending on the HS level, 
the establishment of the normal hydration values may take 1 
to 2 days or, otherwise, it may be practically immediate (see 
Figure 9). Once the HS levels were established, impedance 
values start to rise also immediately.  
 
The rate of impedance augmentation is faster for the first 
weeks (2 to 3 weeks) when the plant is without watering and 
then tends to stabilize towards a value, which is maintained 
during months. The achieved different results, in relation to 
pine and chestnut trees, could be explained due the 
existence of latex vessels in the Jatropha curcas specie [1]. 
Figure 9 shows the particular behaviour of Jatropha curcas 
for the index R500 (resistance at a frequency of 500 kHz).   
In relation to the R1/R50 index – just to compare with the 
previous two cases – it tends to decrease for higher values of 
HS level and, after introducing regular watering, the ratio 
abruptly assumes the typical values (see Figure 10) [1].

In order to consider the variation of the total impedance, 
and not only the variation of its real part (resistance), there 
were studied other impedance indexes, such as the Z1/Z50 
index, presented in this paper.  
Besides the monitoring of one plant of each group/specie, 
there were also performed single acquisitions to the seven 
remaining plants, which were kept under regular conditions 
(including watering).  
The calculation of the mean HS values of these healthy 
and watered trees, allowed the determination of trees with 
higher HS levels and also tress with diseases (see Section 
IV). This information together with the graphical 
representation of this specific index, Z1/Z50, allows the easy 
identification of regions that corresponds to different plant 
physiological conditions.

The previous figures do not include the region that 
corresponds to the disease physiological condition, since 
this was not the purpose of the Jatropha curcas study. As it 
will be shown in the following section, the impedance 
values for this condition are much higher (at least for the 
imaginary part of the impedance) whereby they are out of 
the range of the presented plots. 
 
IV. 
STUDY OF DISEASE CONDITION 
In order to understand the EIS behaviour and the 
physiological states variations for a plant affected with a 
disease, it was performed a study with pines where some 
individuals were inoculated with nematodes. Below, the 
study undergone is explained, along with the main obtained 
results. 
A. Materials and Methods 
To perform this study, there were used twenty four pine 
trees (Pinus pinaster Aiton), with about 2.5 meters tall and 2 
to 3 centimetres in diameter [1]. Pine trees were placed at a 
greenhouse, 
in 
vases, 
and 
under 
controlled 
water 
environment [1]. Temperature, humidity and luminosity 
were also controlled. In order to keep a difference of the 
hydric stress level, half of the tree population was less 
watered (2 minutes per day, ~ 66.67 mL/day) when 
compared with the other half (5 minutes per day, ~133.37 
mL/day) [1].

Schematic of the distribution of the sub-population 
groups of pines at the greenhouse. Each group of three pines has different 
conditions. 
The main purpose of this study was to assess the disease 
physiological state condition of the pines for the specific 
case of the PWD. As stated in the Introduction section, this 
disease 
is 
caused 
by 
the 
pinewood 
nematode 
(Bursaphelenchus xylophilus Nickle), PWN, which is 
housed in the tracheas of the T. destruens Wollaston, a bark 
beetle. Before the PWN arrival, the bark beetles coexisted 
with pines without causing tree damage. To prove the 
harmlessness of this pest, in terms of HS, and also to have a 
control population group, both PWN and the bark beetles 
were inoculated in separated groups of pines. Six pines were 
inoculated with PWN, other 6 pines were inoculated with

bark beetles, other 6 pines were inoculated both with PWN 
and bark beetles, while the remaining 6 were kept healthy 
[1]. The pines of each sub-group were positioned at the 
greenhouse in such a way that half of them, i.e. three pines 
for each sub-group, were regularly watered (5 min/day) 
while the other half was less watered (2 min/day) [1] (see 
Figure 15 for a better understanding).  
The pines inoculated with bark beetles were covered with 
a Lusatril tissue to avoid beetles escape [1]. In each tree there 
were placed 15 insects, which were collected immediately 
after the emergence phase [1]. 
The method used to inoculate the PWN was somehow 
innovative [1]. Three 2 x 2 cm rectangle of cork were 
removed at different locations of the trunks and, the exposed 
phloem, was erased with a scalpel in order to improve the 
adhesion of the nematodes [1]. In each incision it was placed 
a 0.05 mL of a PWN suspension, in a total of 6000 
nematodes per tree [1]. After the inoculation, each removed 
rectangle of cork was fixed in the respective place and 
wrapped with plastic tape [1]. 
The EIS measurements started seventy days after the 
inoculations [1]. At this period, pines inoculated with PWN 
presented a decay rounding the 40% and certain symptoms 
of the disease were already visually accessible [1]. Two of 
the healthy pines died (decay of 100%) due to hydric stress, 
and all the remaining trees appeared healthy [1]. 
There were taken two EIS measurements per tree 
between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. The portable version of the EIS 
system was used with a frequency range from 1 kHz to 1 
MHz was applied in the voltage mode [1]. The electrodes 
were placed in the trunk of each tree in a diametric position, 
about 30 cm above the soil [1]. 
The trunk of each pine tree, inoculated with the PWN, 
was cut in three different regions in order to relate the EIS 
data with the stage of the disease and the number of 
nematodes per section [1]. The cuts were performed: a) 
immediately below the inoculation incision (180 cm above 
the soil); b) 30 cm above the soil (where EIS measurements 
took place); and c) in the middle of the previous two cuts 
(approximately 80 cm above the soil) [1]. 
After these measurements, two healthy pines were 
monitored independently by two EIS portable systems [1]. 
After a week of monitoring, both pines were inoculated with 
PWN and the measurement continued during 7 more weeks 
[1]. The purpose of this last experiment was to study the 
variation of the EIS profiles during the pine decay due to the 
PWD [1]. 
B. Results 
 Several impedance parameters were assessed in order to 
study the physiological states of the trees [1]. Z1/Z50 was the 
impedance parameter that showed the best results [1]. 
Similar values of Z1/Z50 were obtained for both healthy 
pines and pines inoculated with bark beetles, suggesting that 
the beetles’ action does not affect the physiological states of 
pines [1], at least in terms of the HS levels variation. In fact, 
it was expected a similarity between both EIS profiles since 
it is known that these insects does not damage the inner 
structure of the trees. 
The pines inoculated with nematodes and those 
inoculated both with nematodes and bark beetles presented 
also similar values for the Z1/Z50 index, but different from 
those obtained for the previous sub-groups [1]. In relation to 
the previous sub-populations, the values are characterized by 
a higher dispersion in terms of reactance (see Figure 16) [1]. 
Besides, it is observed a clear relation between the number of 
nematodes and the reactance dispersion for the Z1/Z50 
parameter: the higher the number of nematodes is, the higher 
the reactance value of Z1/Z50 becomes (see Figure 17) [1].

states.

In fact, the counting of nematodes in the several cut 
sections revealed that the concentration of nematodes was 
higher in the cut sections b) and c) for the pines less watered 
(pines 1, 2 and 3) – see Table II [1]. The concentration of 
nematodes in the lower parts of the trunks was much higher 
for the pines with less watering than for those with regular 
watering (pines 4, 5 and 6), since nematodes tend to move 
toward watered regions along the trunk [1]. For this reason, 
the referred relation was more perceptible for the pines with 
lower watering, than for those receiving more watering (see 
Figure 18), since the accumulation of nematodes in section c 
(see Table II) was higher for the first group [1]. 
The dispersion in terms of resistance is not significant 
when compared with values from pines in other 
physiological conditions (see Figure 16).

Figure 18.  Values of the impedance parameter Z1/Z50 for the pines 
inoculated with nematodes and with regular watering (pines 4, 5 and 6 from 
the Table II). Since the number of nematodes is low in these pines, the 
linear relation between them and the Z1/Z50 values is not perceptible. Note 
that there are represented two values for each pine. 
The pines that died due to HS (decay of 100%) were also 
studied and the Z1/Z50 parameter presented the highest 
resistance values, in relation to all the other pines [1]. 
The monitored healthy pines were watered at different 
rates: one with low watering (2 min/day) and another with 
regular watering (5 min/day) [1]. After one week of 
monitoring both were inoculated with PWN [1]. As Figure 
19 a) shows, it was again observed dispersion in reactance 
for the Z1/Z50 index [1]. The reactance values, and 
consequently this dispersion, were successively higher as 
time was passing and the disease was evolving [1]. The 
higher values of reactance were achieved for the pine with 
less watering [1].

These results corroborate the previous ones: it was 
expected that the number of nematodes increase in the below 
part of the trunk for the pines with less watering and, 
consequently, to observe a higher rising of the reactance for 
the Z1/Z50 parameter [1]. After the 6th week, pines start to 
decay strongly and it was observed a relevant decrease of the 
reactance and a significant increase of the resistance for the 
same parameter – see Figure 19 a). The higher values of 
resistance were achieved for the pine with less watering, and 
also in a shorter period of time [1]. At the end of the 
monitoring, the decay of the pines, evaluated by an expertise, 
was about 80 % for the pine with regular watering and 100 
% for the pine with less watering [1]. 
From the Figure 19 b), which shows a closer view of the 
Z1/Z50 index evolution during the monitoring, it is observed 
that the path that corresponds to the rising of the population 
of nematodes is different from the path followed during the 
period of decay [1]. For this reason, it is possible to affirm 
that PWD evolution has a hysteresis-like behavior [1]. 
It is worth noting that some impedance parameters may be 
preferable than others, depending on the physiological 
condition that is being studied. To evaluate the disease 
condition, the Z1/Z50 index, allowed showing the great 
reactance increase that is characteristic of these diseases 
(since the cellular membranes are affected, which promotes a 
decrease of membranes capacitor effect) – see Figure 19. 
 Other parameters, such as R1/R50, which shown to be 
useful in the previous study, may not be the most adequate to 
study this specific case of disease condition (see Figure 20).

V. 
DISCUSSION 
 
Assessing physiological states of plants, using impedance 
techniques, implies the knowledge of the typical EIS profiles 
of the species under study, i.e., the EIS profiles for healthy 
individuals under controlled environment conditions [1]. For 
this reason, the studies presented herein required an 
exhaustive EIS assessment and monitoring, performed over 
months, and extensive data analysis [1].  
The greatest difficulty inherent in this type of studies is 
the purchase and maintenance of the plant specimens, which 
in addition to being time consuming, is extremely expensive. 
Besides, some of the performed tests required the death of 
the specimen under study, which worsens the referred 
problem. For this reason, a true statistical analysis, which 
may be required to achieve reliable results, was not possible 
to accomplish. However, the results presented herein 
constitute an innovative approach to assess physiological 
conditions of plants, giving plausible and interesting clues to 
solve the problem of the lack of techniques, and also 
methods, in this specific area. 
The biological application study aimed at discriminating 
between different physiological states of three plant species, 
which have economical/forestall relevance: pine (Pinus 
pinaster Aiton), cheastnut (Castanea sativa Mill) and 
Jatropha Curcas L. [1] Attention was given to the 
assessment of the HS level and the disease condition. 
To accomplish this task, an EIS system able to perform 
AC sweeps over a sufficient large frequency range, was 
developed. The design of the EIS system took into account 
the robustness, efficiency and celerity of the bioimpedance 
analysis [1]. The portability, adaptability to different 
biological applications and the implementation of easily 
accessible and affordable components were also considered 
aspects [1]. The system versatility is another advantage [1]. 
It allows the user to choose the settings of the analysis that 
best fit a specific application, such as: frequency limits, 
number of intervals of the scan and type of signal excitation 
(voltage or current) [1]. Besides, a driven shield technique is 
applied in order to overcome problems inherent to stray 
capacitive effects from cables [1]. The maximum phase shift 
reduction estimated was about 20.4 % for the current 
excitation mode and about 35.8% for the voltage mode [1]. 
The system also implements a PSD method with a novel 
implication to determine the impedance values, which 
shown to be effective. 
The great amount of data, typical in these types of 
studies, imposes a problem to the use of theoretical models; 
such is the case of the Cole model. For this reason, the 
approach followed in this work was the research of 
bioimpedance indexes that better expressed specific 
physiological conditions. Although, a specific bioimpidance 
index does not require a true impedance analysis, i.e., a 
frequency scan, the method used has proven the necessity of 
a spectroscopy analysis, since the indexes relations and their

correlation to the physiological conditions may be better 
expressed for some frequencies than others. 
The obtained results suggest that the implemented 
method may constitute a first innovative approach for the 
assessment of physiological states of plants and to the early 
diagnosis of plant diseases [1]. The consistency of the results 
obtained for the three studied species reveals the 
transversality of the method [1].  
Two of the most interesting bioimpedance indexes are 
the ratio Z1/Z50 and also the ratio R1/R50, which were studied 
and presented in this paper. 
EIS profiles showed a consistent behaviour whit the HS 
level of the three studied species [1]. The Z1/Z50 impedance 
parameter presents increased values of both reactance and 
resistance when the hydric stress is high, for the pines and 
chestnuts [1]. In the case of the Jatropha curcas, this 
parameter presented decreased values of both reactance and 
resistance when the HS was high [1]. This inverse behaviour 
may be explained due to the presence of latex vessels in this 
species, which may function as water reservoirs [1]. 
The evolution of the Z1/Z50 impedance parameter may be 
used to predict risky HS levels of a plant. 
However, as it was shown, the HS level of a plant exerts 
much more influence over the real part of the impedance 
than over its imaginary part. Actually, the phase shift 
alterations due to progressively higher levels of HS are 
almost inexistent. For this reason, the R1/R50 or other 
interrelated resistance (real part of the impedance) indexes 
may constitute preferable approaches to study the HS level 
and its use as a risk predictor.  
In addition to the study of the HS level and its influence 
in the plant physiological condition, it was studied the 
disease physiological condition for the pines, were 
inoculations with PWN and bark beetles were performed.  
The pines inoculated with PWN presented Z1/Z50 ratio 
with high values of reactance, what suggests that current 
flows preferably trough the cytosol [1]. In fact, the action of 
the nematodes inside the tree may destroy cell membranes, 
which means that membranes capacitor effect becomes less 
significant in the impedance measurement [1]. 
It was also shown a relation between the number of 
nematodes and the Z1/Z50 index: the increasing of nematodes 
number is proportional to the reactance ratio augmentation 
[1].  
On the other hand, the action of bark beetles seems not to 
interfere, at least in measurable terms, in the level of HS of 
pines, since the values obtained were similar to those 
obtained for healthy pines [1]. 
The index Z1/Z50 for healthy trees with high levels of HS 
(decays above 80) presented high values of resistance, due to 
water loss [1]. High resistance values were also obtained for 
the trees in advanced stages of the disease [1]. This means, 
that for this specific case, the method is not able to 
distinguish between healthy trees and trees with the PWD 
[1]. However, it is known that the advanced stages of  the 
PWD induce high levels of hydric stress, which allows to 
infer that, in practical terms, the situation is exactly the same, 
i.e., the tree presents high probability to die [1]. On the other 
hand, in the stages where the method is able to distinguish 
between trees with the PWD and healthy trees, and since the 
decay was determined to round the 40%, the diagnosis could 
help to assist pine management [1]. If a cure is available, at 
these stages, a treatment could be administrated and reverse 
the disease evolution [1]. 
The implemented method has allowed identifying three 
clear regions on the Z1/Z50 graph that corresponds to: healthy 
and watered trees (HW), tress with high level of HS (HLHS) 
and trees with disease (D). Although, the high levels of HS, 
obtained by the R1/R50 analysis, may drive the tree to dead 
or, in other words, the levels of HS may be used as a risk 
indicator, the use of several indicators and biompedance 
indexes is necessary to perform a reliable study (at least 
these two: R1/R50 and Z1/Z50). In fact, the studied disease 
indicated a clear region characterized by higher levels of 
Z1/Z50 reactance and normal levels of Z1/Z0 resistance, where 
the levels of HS based on the R1/R50 ratio seemed normal. 
Besides, as stated, the final stages of the disease presented 
impedance similar values to those obtained for trees with HS 
levels. What is worth adding is that it may be possible to 
interfere, with a cure for example, during the evolution of the 
disease when the Z1/Z50 graph shows a D physiological 
condition. If the graph shows a HLHS condition the tree is 
probably about to die either it has a disease promoted by 
biologic agents, such the PWN, or not.  
In order to summarize the discussion, the method studied 
and presented herein, based on bioimpedance indexes, may 
constitute a first innovative approach to the assessment of the 
main physiological conditions (healthy state, HS level and 
disease), since the referred indexes may be used as risk 
predictors. 
 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
The developed EIS system showed to be a robust, 
reliable and easy to implement equipment in the assessment 
of the physiological states of living plants. Its main 
advantages are: portability, since it allows in vivo and in situ 
measurements; adaptability to different biological samples; 
and versatility, since it is possible to adjust the parameters of 
the acquisition according to the sample under study. 
The method studied and presented herein, based on 
bioimpedance indexes, such as Z1/Z50 and R1/R50, allowed to 
determine three distinct physiological states: healthy and 
watered plants, plants with high level of HS and plants with 
disease. 
Although a real statistical analysis is missing, the method 
presented in this paper may constitute an interesting solution 
for the assessment of physiological states of plants, since the 
bioimpedance indexes may easily be implemented as risk 
predictors, which may help to assist forest and crops 
management and also physiological plant studies.
