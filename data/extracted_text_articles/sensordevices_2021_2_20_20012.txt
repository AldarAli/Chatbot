Abstract— Wearables are mainly used for commercial 
purposes to enhance smartphone functionality by enabling 
payment for commercial items or monitoring physical activity. 
As emerged from a recent systematic review, many research 
studies focused on using wearable devices for environmental 
monitoring of the built environment. Those studies showed 
that, among the thermal, visual, acoustic, and air quality 
environmental factors, the last one is the most considered when 
using wearables, even though in combination with some others. 
Another relevant finding is that of the acquired studies, in only 
one, the authors shared their wearables as an open-source 
device, and it will probably be necessary to encourage 
researchers to consider opensource to promote scalability and 
proliferation of new wearables customized to cover different 
domains. In this case, with a bibliometric review, it was 
possible to complete the analysis by answering some of most 
statistical aspects: what are the most important authors 
involved in this domain of research? What are the most 
relevant sources? What is the geographical coverage and the 
collaboration among different Countries? What is the 
conceptual structure of the considered topic? The methodology 
used to answer the above questions is based on a bibliometric 
review using a specific package developed for R environment: 
bibliometrix. 
Keywords-environmental monitoring; wearable devices; 
wearables; bibliometric review. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
The term “wearable” was first used in the scientific 
literature in 1996 when, in [1], the author presented a 
personal imaging system and, in [2], where the author gave 
an overview of energy generation during the user's daily 
activities, removing the technological limitation of batteries 
to power wearables. A year later, in 1997, the researchers of 
MIT media laboratory, Picard and Healey, used the term 
“affective wearables” [3] to refer to a system equipped with 
sensors that allowed the detection of affective patterns (e.g., 
heart rate variability, electrodermal activity). To date, the 
class of wearable electronics or technologies, called 
“wearables” for short, has attracted increasing public interest 
and is generally identified as a category of devices that can 
be worn or tattooed on the human skin or even implanted in 
the human body to continuously and accurately monitor 
some variables (biometric in most of the cases, but also 
environmental in some other cases) without interrupting or 
restricting the user’s movements [4]. 
Environmental Quality (EQ) can be subdivided by 
analysing it in terms of Indoor EQ (IEQ) or Outdoor EQ 
(OEQ). Both IEQ and OEQ are important to ensure the 
health and well-being of people. 
It is well known that users spend a large part of their time 
indoors, so the quality of environments within buildings and 
the satisfaction and well-being of occupants is a hot topic 
today [5]. Especially in low-cost housing, where the limited 
indoor space may lead occupants to spend more time doing 
various outdoor activities, the quality of the outdoor 
environment is crucial [6]. 
Both IEQ and OEQ refer to a holistic concept that 
includes various environmental factors: visual, acoustic, 
thermal and air quality.  
In all cases, monitoring all four environmental factors 
could be helpful to understand the complex area of 
interaction (cross-modal or combined) among the different 
environmental aspects and user perception of IEQ or OEQ. 
In order to link the term wearables with the 
environmental aspect, some new acronyms have been 
introduced: Personal Environmental Monitoring System 
(PEMS) and Wearable Environmental Monitoring System 
(WEMS), to emphasise the class of wearable devices for 
monitoring some environmental factors [7]. This manuscript 
is intended to be complementary to [8], where the attention 
was focused primarily on the systematic analysis, defining 
the 
relevant 
scientific 
literature 
finding 
regarding 
environmental monitoring with wearables. The attention 
focused here on the bibliometric analysis, allowing to 
quantify the scientific production and measure its quality and 
impact. It is also useful to identify and analyze research's 
intellectual, conceptual and social structures and their 
evolution and dynamics.

METHODOLOGY 
Among the different available databases (e.g., PubMed, 
Web of Science, Google Scholar), the Scopus search engine, 
41

SENSORDEVICES 2021 : The Twelfth International Conference on Sensor Device Technologies and Applications

developed by Elsevier, was used due to the high quality of 
the available resources, including the Institute for Scientific 
Information (ISI) and Scopus-indexed papers. It is a 
multidisciplinary database that allows defining Information 
Systems (IS) to think of the advanced search functionality 
available on the web platform by providing about 20% more 
coverage than Web of Science. Scopus focused primarily on 
physical sciences, health sciences, life sciences and social 
sciences [9], which is consistent with the aim of this 
research. The covered period is from 1966 to the present [9]. 
This aspect is consistent with our bibliometric review 
since, the oldest paper presenting a “wearable” device with 
computational capabilities was published in the 1990s.  A 
detailed description of the reproducible methodology used to 
acquire the data can be found in [8]. 
III. 
DISCUSSION 
The main results of the bibliometric review are presented 
in the following subsections. By applying a proven 
methodology, results can be provided in the form of 
descriptive analysis, main authors involved in the topic, 
geographic coverage and thematic map to complement the 
information provided to the scientific community by the 
systematic review described in [8].  
A. Descriptive analysis 
A descriptive summary of the main bibliometric statistics 
is reported in Table I.

In Table I, the Co-Authors per Articles index is 
calculated as the average number of co-authors per Article. 
In this case, the index considers the author appearances 
while the Authors per Article index is the ratio between the 
total number of articles and the total number of authors. 
Consequently, even if an author has published more than 
one Article, it is counted only once. This is why the authors 
per Article index is smaller than the Co-authors per Article 
index [12]. Only five authors wrote each Article on average 
with a Collaboration Index equal to 4.91. 
As the analysis period of Table 1 covers the last 20 years, 
only with Figure 1 it is possible to point out that the most 
significant increase in production was recorded only since 
2012 with an Annual Growth Rate of 9.89%.

Among the 68 analysed peer-reviewed scientific articles, 
no preferred journal where articles on this topic were 
concentrated was found. However, the authors’ interest in 
journals that deals with the all-encompassing theme of 
sensors is increasing in the last years, as highlighted by the 
distribution frequency of articles published on the "Sensors" 
and "IEEE Sensors Journal" as displayed in Figure 1.

A brief description of related studies identified by the 
Top 15 authors is reported below. While a detailed 
description of 
all 
the 
studies, 
subdivided by 
the 
environmental factor (i.e., visual, acoustic, thermal and air 
quality), can be found in [8]. 
The author Figueiro M.G. was actively involved in using 
wearable devices to assess circadian-effective light and its 
impact on alertness in different categories of users. In 
particular, in [13], office workers wear a pendant-mounted 
Daysimeter device, developed and calibrated at the Lighting 
Research Center (LRC) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute 
and used in combination with a specific questionnaire to 
measure participant-specific Circadian Stimulus (CS), thus 
allowing to identify how they effectively felt significantly 
more vital, energetic and alert on the days with CS ≥ 0.3 
compared to the baseline day. In [14], a field study was 
conducted with eighth-grade students to determine, using the 
Daysimeter, the impact of morning light on circadian timing, 
sleep duration and performance. In [15], he documented the 
spectral and spatial performance characteristics of two new 
versions of the Daysimeter. He found that wearing the 
Daysimeter or Actiwatch Spectrum [16] on the wrist 
provides accurate light measurements relative to locating a 
calibrated photosensor at the cornea plane. In [16], he 
described a case study where light exposure and rest-activity 
patterns in an older adult with dementia and his caregiver 
spouse were monitored with a wrist-worn actigraph. This 
device captures and records high-resolution human activity 
information to collect baseline data and an eye-level 
wavelength-sensitive light meter (Daysimeter). The same 
topic was considered in [17] and [18], co-authored by Rea 
and Plitnick, to identify the effect of light on the person with 
dementia and caregivers through the use of questionnaires to 
acquire subjective feedback and the same instruments, the 
Daysimeters and the actigraphs [19].  These researches 
allowed verifying how ambient lighting interventions 
designed to increase daytime circadian stimulation can be 
effectively used to increase sleep efficiency in persons with 
Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementia (ADRD) and their 
caregivers. It may also be effective for other populations 
such as healthy older adults with sleep problems, 
adolescents, and veterans with traumatic brain injury. In 
[20], he demonstrated the feasibility of using light through 
closed eyelids during sleep for promoting circadian 
alignment and sleep health. In [21], he measured both 
light/dark exposures with Daysimeter and salivary Dim Light 
Melatonin Onset (DLMO) to study the effects of chronotype, 
sleep schedule and light/dark pattern exposures on the 
circadian phase. In [22], the daysimeter was used to verify 
how a lighting intervention tailored to increase daytime 
circadian stimulation can increase sleep quality and improve 
behaviour in patients with ADRD. While promising for 
application, the present field study should be replicated using 
a larger sample size and longer treatment duration. Rea co-
authored 
most 
of 
Figueiro 
studies 
[13]-
[15][17][18][21][23][24]. In [25], authors emphasize how 
technologies are needed to provide information about the 
state of our circadian system to our conscious awareness so 
that we can take appropriate action to avoid and correct light-
induced circadian disruption. Bierman co-authored three of 
the articles discussed above [15][23][24]. Plitnick co-
authored also three paper previously discussed [14][17][21]. 
Bhogadi co-authored [26] and [27]. In [27], he described 
the results of a European Research Council funded project 
(CHAI) aimed at investigating the relationship between 
particulate air pollution from outdoor and household sources 
with information from GPS, wearable cameras, and 
continuous measurements of personal exposure to particles. 
In [26], he used data from multiple sources (continuous 
personal and ambient PM2.5 concentrations; questionnaire, 
GPS, and wearable camera data; and modelled long-term 
exposure at residence) to identify the relative contribution of 
the time of the day (when?), location (where?), and 
individuals' activities (what?) to PM2.5 personal exposure in 
periurban South India. 
Cho H. in [28] described how the use of a highly 
sensitive Multi-Stimuli Responsive (MSR) unit applied to a 
wearable motion/environmental monitoring chromic device 
could be used to evaluate some environmental stimuli (UV 
radiation, temperature) with thermal mapping capability. In 
[7], he presented a PEMS and WEMS that were developed 
by considering consumers' needs to detect and avoid 
exposure to air pollution. 
Wu et al. in [29]-[31] demonstrated the practical 
application in different contexts of a wearable multi-sensor 
IoT network system for environmental monitoring. 
Haghi and Thurow co-autored two papers [32] [33] 
where they 
emphasized the role of wearables in 
multiparameter 
monitoring, 
miniaturization, 
sensor 
integration and data fusion. Together with Stoll in [34]-[37] 
demonstrated the practical applicability of a multi-layer 
wearable devices. 
Tsow, Tao et al. [38], and then also Chen with them 
[39][40] used practical examples to emphasize the role of a 
wearable sensing system for assessment of exposures to 
environmental volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The 
same aspect was covered by the studies of Davis and Fabia et 
al. [41][42], where they used different wearable to quantify 
the same aspect: the personal exposures to VOCs.

established the most active collaborations.   
D. Thematic Map 
The thematic mapping [43] allows delineating the 
conceptual structure of the topic. This latter consists of a 
word co-occurrence network analysis performed considering 
the Authors’ keywords to define what science talks about in 
a field, main themes, and trends (see Figure 5). In Figure 5, 
each bubble represents a network cluster and the name 
attributed to each bubble is the word belonging to the cluster 
with the higher occurrence value. The size of each bubble is 
proportional to the cluster word occurrences, while the 
position is defined according to the cluster Callon centrality 
and density: the former is a measure of the importance of the 
selected theme in the development of the entire research 
domain; the latter is a measure of the theme’s development 
[44]. 
 
 
Figure 5.  Thematic Map considering authors’ keywords for the full period 
under investigation 
Four different themes are shown in Figure 5. The upper-
right quadrant shows the motor themes. They are 
characterized by both high centrality and density. Among the 
“motor themes” that are the more developed in the literature, 
the main concern is air pollution, followed by exposure 
assessment, which refers to studies in which exposure to air 
pollutants (Particulate Matter specifically) can be considered 
in combination with the evaluation of noise exposure.  
The upper-left quadrant shows high density and low 
centrality themes, which are of limited importance with high 
development. 
In 
this 
case, 
“ambient 
physiological 
monitoring” refers to the study [32] where environmental, 
behavioural, and physiological domains of influencing 
factors in healthcare were measured simultaneously.  
In the lower-left quadrant, there are the emerging or 
declining themes.  Using the thematic evolution and different 
time slices it is possible to differentiate emerging and 
declining themes considering the direction toward the top 
right or the lower left, respectively [45]. Within this 
particular case, light measurement with wearables was an 
emerging theme in particular over the period 2010-2015 
considering all the studies performed by Figueiro et al.  
Finally, the lower-right quadrant shows the transversal 
themes to the different research areas of the field: wearable 
and environmental monitor showing the high connection 
between these aspects in the selected papers. 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The theme of environmental monitoring considering 
wearables is increasing in terms of published papers. While 
in [8] it was possible to emphasize the main fields covered 
by the scientific production, the original value of this 
research is the rigorous process conducted to perform the 
first bibliometric mapping in the field of wearables used for 
environmental monitoring. 
For this purpose, a total of 68 different manuscripts were 
considered. A possible limitation in the selection of the 
papers could be the bias due to the authors' decision. This 
aspect was limited by the fact that two authors performed 
44

SENSORDEVICES 2021 : The Twelfth International Conference on Sensor Device Technologies and Applications

time-consuming screening and, in case of disagreement, 
reached consensus through discussion and in consultation 
with the third author. The analysis of selected papers could 
support scientific community in identifying the main 
domains of investigation or the main authors involved in this 
research. It was possible to discover how, among the 
different authors, Figueiro and Rea gave a great contribution 
in light-induced circadian disruption assessment using a 
wearable device.  
It was also possible to discover the geographical 
coverage and the collaboration among different Countries. 
Additionally, the thematic map, defined considering the 
meaning 
of 
Callon 
centrality 
and 
density, 
allows 
emphasizing the most occurred topic, differentiated 
considering motor themes, nice themes, emerging or 
declined themes and basic themes. In particular, considering 
the motor theme/s, exposure assessment was considered as 
the most considered and developed theme. By merging this 
result with that provided by [8], it was possible to emphasize 
how for the exposure assessment it was primary considered 
the aspect related to air quality assessment and visual aspects 
on human well-being.  
The acoustic factor was minimally treated. This is 
probably due to the fact that some wearable instruments that 
measure workers' exposure at shoulder level (e.g., dosimeters 
SV 104A [46]), or detect environmental noise at ear level 
(e.g., HEAD acoustics binaural headset BHS II [47]) are 
already commercially available and therefore, their design, 
development and use for research purpose does not constitute 
a novelty, except in the integration with multi-parameter or 
'low cost' and open-source  acquisition instruments. 
The same circumstance can be highlighted for thermal 
aspects where temperature sensors were mainly used in 
combination with other instruments to acquire information 
about the environment without properly considering a 
human-centric perspective. It would be useful to identify 
low-cost, open-source solutions that most people can use to 
assess, not so much the variability of environmental 
parameters in the indoor environment, which, when 
considering workers sitting at their desks, can lose its 
significance. But considering the variability of the 
environmental conditions to which the subjects may be 
exposed during the day, e.g., passing from the outdoors 
torrid or humid climates of the summer of tropical and sub-
tropical areas to indoor situations that are typically more 
bearable or too cold due to ineffective regulation of the 
HVAC plants.  
By linking all this information with user feedback, 
algorithms not based on a physical model but, instead, based 
on data could be effectively applied to identify the variables 
that most affect the individual's perception of comfort, 
including aspects that are difficult to take into account (e.g., 
transient exposure) [48].  
Probably much more work can be done, in developing 
new hardware devices that could monitor the environment in 
a holistic perspective, also considering the other 3 
environmental factors (visual, acoustic and thermal) in line 
with the studies of Haghi and Thurow (Figure 2) which 
emphasized the role of wearables in multiparameter 
monitoring, thus making it possible to take into account any 
combined or cross-modal aspects resulting from the potential 
interaction between different environmental variables.  
Furthermore, 
by 
combining 
the 
results 
of 
the 
bibliographic review with those of the [8], even if the growth 
of publications has increased considerably since 2012, with a 
noticeable halt in the last two years (see Figure 1), it was 
possible, at least theoretically, to hypothesize how the 
sharing of open-source solutions can encourage the 
proliferation of application of these devices in different 
contexts, promoting the design and assessment of the built 
environment on the basis of a human-centred approach, even 
in those areas not yet affected by the scientific debate on this 
topic (figure 4).
