Abstract- Contextual Focal Structure Analysis (CFSA) model 
aims to improve the discovery and interpretability of focal 
structure spreaders on social networks. This method can 
present influential sets of commenters and contexts in terms of 
specific interaction patterns or narrative structures on 
YouTube. The CFSA model utilizes multiplex networks, where 
the data is structured into multiple layers to consider the 
different activities of the users on social networks. The first 
layer is the co-commenter network based on two commenters 
commenting on the same video; then, the second layer is the 
network between videos and channels that shows to which 
channel 
the 
video 
belongs. 
The 
two 
layers 
have 
interconnections based on the commenters’ activities and the 
participation relations on different YouTube channels. The 
model's performance was evaluated through the Cheng Ho 
disinformation narrative within the Indo-Pacific region on 
YouTube. The dataset includes more than 36,495 commenters 
and 145,923 videos on YouTube. The model results showed 
commenters activities with supplementary contexts in the form 
of co-commenter-Channels activities. Likewise, this study 
provides the best answer to “How to explain the dynamic 
interplay between commenters, videos, and YouTube channels 
in the Indo-Pacific region?” The research model discovered 
the most impactful contextual focal structure sets for the 
YouTube co-commenters network. The results involve popular 
channels 
such 
as 
"Asumsi," 
"Erwan 
Tuinesia," 
"KOMPASTV," and "metrotvnews," which primarily serve 
the Indonesian community in the Indo-Pacific region. 
Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that several of these channels are 
known for spreading misinformation.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
The Indo-Pacific region is the world’s speediest rising 
economic region, and its importance to the world’s power 
countries like the United States of America, the Union 
Europe, and China will continue to expand over time [1]. The 
Indo-Pacific region is a vast area that encompasses numerous 
countries with diverse cultural, economic, and geopolitical 
backgrounds. Some of the countries that fall under the ambit 
of the Indo-Pacific region include Australia, Bangladesh, 
China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, 
Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. The 
Indo-Pacific region makes up more than one-third of all 
global economic activity and will account for more than half 
of the global economy by 2040 [1], 65% of the world’s 
oceans, and 25% of its land [2]. In addition, the Indo-Pacific 
region’s population growth in the next 20 years is driving 
massive demands for health education, health services, food 
agriculture and fisheries, natural resources, energy, and 
advanced manufacturing and green infrastructure [1]. 
Furthermore, like all great power countries, the European 
Union, the United States of America, China, Canada, and 
Japan seek to influence the region to set ways for their own 
interests [3]. Likewise, the United States is considered an 
Indo-Pacific power, “the future of each of our nations- and 
indeed the world- depends on a free and open Indo-Pacific 
enduring and flourishing in the decades ahead” President Joe 
Biden underlined this point on September 24, 2021[2]. 
However, China, the largest trading and economy in the 
world [3], has chosen the path of challenge and 
confrontation, where China is taking over and rising power 
that is viewed with suspicion and challenges for nations in 
the Indo-Pacific region and beyond [4].  
Moreover, Indo-Pacific nations like China, India, Japan, 
Philippines, and Indonesia are leading the way in terms of 
active users and growth in the social media consumption [5]. 
For example, YouTube is a video-sharing site and is 
considered an integral part of the social media platforms [6] 
and is one of the famous platforms for sharing news and 
social activities that cover over 95% of the internet 
population in 80 different languages [7]. For instance, users 
within the Indo-Pacific region were split between India (467 
million), Indonesia (139 million), and Japan (102 million), 
respectively [8]. Furthermore, YouTube’s channels show a 
strong presence for the Indo-Pacific people to share content 
and recommendations on the posted videos, where the top 
four channels’ distribution categorized to people and blogs 
(24.89%), entertainment (18.63%), gaming (12.66%), and 
music (11.13%) [9]. In fact, The recommendation system on 
YouTube is a critical driver and plays a significant role in 
driving video views on the platform. Its primary function is 
to provide users with video recommendations based on their 
viewing history and the content they are currently engaged 
with [10]. In this research paper, we analyzed the 
recommendations made by commenters on YouTube 
regarding a disinformation narrative known as "Cheng Ho" 
or "Zheng He" within the Indo-Pacific region.  
Cheng Ho is a disinformation narrative created to 
increase regional support for China and its geopolitical 
interest in the South China Sea, the Belt Road Initiative, and 
as a response to the accusations of China’s oppression of 
Muslims [11]. The goal of pushing this narrative is to tackle 
the accusations of China’s oppression of the Uyghur 
Muslims and increase support for China and its strategic 
pursuits including the aggression in the South China Sea. 
Oftentimes, misinformation and disinformation are 
spread by commenters in a coordinated manner on social 
networks [12]. Highlighting focal groups of commenters on 
YouTube is the main contribution of this research, where 
these commenters could develop unique structures and act to 
influence individuals/communities to maximize information

between 
Indo-Pacific 
region 
nations. 
Conventional community detection methods focus on larger 
communities and are oblivious to these influential groups. 
Şen et al. [13] proposed the Focal Structure Analysis (FSA) 
model to identify the smallest possible influential groups of 
users that can maximize information diffusion in social 
networks. Likewise, Alassad et al. [14] introduced the FSA 
2.0 model to enhance the quality of the focal structure sets 
discovery and to overcome the limits in the activities of the 
influential users. The authors developed a bi-level 
decomposition optimization model to identify groups that 
could maximize the individual’s influence in the first level 
and measure the network’s stability in the second level. Both 
FSA and FSA 2.0 exclusively exhibit the activities of users 
in relation to other users. For instance, node i is linked to 
other nodes like j in the network, where neither model 
reveals any data on other activities taking place within the 
network. To improve the analysis of the state-of-the-art FSA 
model and FSA 2.0 model, this paper introduces the CFSA 
model to enhance the discovery and interpretability, reveals 
the context and highlights the interests of commenters in the 
form of contextual focal structure sets on YouTube.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II 
describes the research problem statement. Section III 
describes the YouTube dataset implemented to evaluate the 
model's performance and the overall structure of the 
methodology. The results in Section IV concluded that the 
CFSA results are interpretable and informative. Likewise, 
Section IV states the findings and presents the benefits of the 
proposed CFSA model enhanced the quality and the 
interpretability of the focal structure sets of commenters on 
YouTube. Finally, the conclusion, limitations, and future 
research path are given in Section V. 
II. 
RESEARCH PROBLEM STATEMENT  
The proposed research aims to highlight the CFSA model 
in YouTube’s recommendation system. Given the raw 
datasets from the YouTube environment, the research 
problem statement is to implement a systematic model that 
utilizes the FSA 2.0 model [15] and the multiplex network 
approach to reveal the co-commenters’ activities, interests 
and behavior in the form of context that may act in different 
cultural circumstances [12]. This approach involves different 
layers, including co-commenters, commenter-video, and 
video-channel in the form of participation layers.  
Moreover, this research presents essential ideas and 
analysis to study questions like, can traditional community 
detection methods identify influential commenters and 
reveal the context on different YouTube channels? How the 
CFSA model utilizes the multiplex network to fill the gap in 
the information limitations? Finally, could the CFSA model 
structure the information to identify activities and explain the 
actions or interests of influential commenters? The next 
section discusses the methodology and the overall structure 
of the CFSA model. 
III. 
METHODOLOGY  
This section describes the technical intuition in our 
model; it consists of three main components. The data 
collection level is to collect all related context from Twitter 
including different trending hashtags related to events on 
Twitter network. The multiplex information matrix structure 
and CFS sets discovery level, where the layers of the 
multiplex network include co-commenters, commenter-
video, and video-channel in the form of co-commenters’ 
adjacency matrix layer and the participation layer network. 
Finally, the third level to validate and analyze the CFS set. 
For this level, we measure three Truth (GT) measures to 
calculate the amount of influence that any CFS set may 
generate in the entire structure of the network.  
A. Multiplex Matrix Structure  
In general, the adjacency matrix of an unweighted and 
undirected graph G with N nodes in an N × N symmetric 
matrix is 𝐀 = &a!"(, with a!" = 1, only if there is an edge 
between i and j in G, and a!" = 0 otherwise. The adjacency 
matrix of layer graph G# is n# × n# symmetric matrix 𝐀# =
a!"
#, with a!"
# = 1 only if there is an edge between (i, α), and 
(j, α) in G#. 
Likewise, the adjacency matrix of G$ is an n × m matrix 
ρ = p!#, with p!# = 1 only if there is an edge between the 
node i and the layer α in the participation graph, i.e., only if 
node i participates in layer α. We call it the participation 
matrix. The adjacency matrix of the coupling graph G% is an 
N × N matrix ℒ = &c!"(, with c!" = 1 only if there is an edge 
between node-layer pair i and j in G%, i.e., if they are 
representatives of the same node in different layers. We can 
arrange rows and columns of ℒ such that node-layer pairs of 
the same layer are contiguous, and layers are ordered as 
shown in the next section. It results that ℒ is a block matrix 
with zero diagonal blocks. Thus, c!" = 1, with i, j = 1, … , N 
represents an edge between a node-layer pair in layer 1(co-
commenter layer) and node layer pair in layer 2 (video-
channel layer) if i < n& and n& < j < n' as shown in Figure 
1. The supra-adjacency matrix is the adjacency matrix of the 
supra-graph Gℳ. Just as Gℳ, A: is a synthetic representation 
of the whole multiplex ℳ. It can be obtained from the intra-
layer adjacency matrices and the coupling matrix in the 
following way:  
 
           A: = 𝐀# ⊕#  ℒ 
    (1) 
Where the same consideration as in ℒ applies for the 
indices we also define. 𝐀= ⊕ 𝐀#, which we call the intra-
layer adjacency matrix.  
Additionally, Figure 1 shows the Multiplex network, it is 
the union of the co-commenter layer and the video-channel 
layer. The participation layer is the interconnections between 
commenters, videos, and YouTube channels.  
The CFSA model was built on a bi-level decomposition 
optimization problem to maximize the centrality values at 
the commenter level and maximize the network modularity 
values at the network level. Equation (2) shows the objective 
function used at the commenter level to maximize the 
centrality values in the multiplex network.

model considers the commenters to have edges to the 
participation network A:.  
 
 
Figure 1. Multiplex network overall structure. 
In the network level, the model measures every set of 
commenters’ spheres of influence in the entire A: network. 
This level is designed to measure the commenters’ impact 
when they join A: network. To measure the influence the 
commenters’ identified from the commenter level, we utilize 
the 
spectral 
modularity 
method 
proposed 
in 
[6]. 
Furthermore, we utilized a vector parameter 𝑐⃗𝛿2
OOOO3×5
563 to 
transfer the commenters’ information between the 
commenter level and the network level. The network level is 
designed based on the following set of equations.

∀𝑗, 𝑥 
(8) 
The objective in the network-level is to identify sets of 
commenters that maximize the spectral modularity value 𝜚-7 
in each 𝑥 iteration as shown in (5). Likewise, the model 
would search for the active set of commenters that will 
maximize the network’s sparsity as indicated in (6). A: is the 
modularity matrix. In constraint (6), 𝜉-7 ∈ 𝑅3×5 is the union 
between the commenters sets of users from the commenter 
level, 𝑐⃗𝛿2
OOOO3×5
563 , and the candidate sets of commenters 𝛿-7 that 
presumably will maximize the network’s sparsity. Constraint 
(7) is used to calculate the spectral modularity values 𝜇97

OOOO. In 
constraint (8), 𝐶𝜚-7utilized to transfer back the results to the 
commenter level, where 𝛿-7(𝜇97

OOOO) is the non-dominated 
solution that maximized the network’s modularity. 𝐶𝜚-7
;  is 
the set of commenters that maximized the modularity values 
when they joined the network and a vector parameter to 
interact with the commenter level and transfer the optimal 
solution from the network level to the commenter level. 𝐶𝜚-7
;  
selects the contextual focal structure sets that gather all the 
criteria from both levels at each iteration 𝑥.  
B. Data Collection 
YouTube’s data API was used to collect an initial set of 
videos on key phrases relating to the Cheng Ho narrative at 
COSMOS research center, UA Little Rock, USA. The data 
collected was written to a MySQL database, where special 
queries were implemented against the database with a full-
text search. To prevent personalized recommendations based 
on the user’s history, we didn’t log into the account used for 
collection and the browser instances and all cookies were 
cleared before a new crawl job. This data API run time was 
repeated in multiple iterations to get the most recent 
commenters’ recommendations on videos, channels, and 
posted videos as shown in Table I.

C. CFS Sets Validation and Analysis  
In this part of the solution procedure, we implemented 
various steps to validate the outputs of the CFSA model. 
These steps should quantitatively measure the impacts of the 
commenters’ influence and illustrate their interest on 
YouTube networks. For this purpose, we implemented three 
measures to calculate the changes in the network; first, the 
modularity values [16], [17] we call it (Ground Truth 
Modularity (GTMOD)); second, the clustering coefficient 
method [18] (Ground Truth Clustering Coefficient (GTCC)); 
and lastly, the change in the number of communities (Ground 
Truth Network Stability (GTNS)).  
Moreover, the solution procedure selects the top ten CFS 
sets from each Ground Truth (GT) measure (GTMOD, 
GTCC, and GTNS). In other words, the rate of changes in 
GTMOD, GTCC, and GTNS after suspending all CFS sets 
from the YouTube co-commenter-channel network is the 
identifier of the top ten CFS sets. The findings and 
theoretical and practical implications are presented in the 
next section.  
IV. 
RESULTS 
This research aims to present the benefits of the proposed 
CFSA model that could enhance the quality and the 
discovery of the focal structure sets of commenters on 
YouTube.  
The case study shown in Figure 2, implemented in the 
research was related to the Cheng Ho dataset. The CFSA 
model identified 30 CFS sets in the multiplex network (co-
commenters-channels layer). These sets are different in size, 
number of commenters, channels, and network structures on 
YouTube.  
Furthermore, Table  shows the manual analysis and the 
activities of the co-commenter - channels identified in one of 
the CFS sets, witnessing “what is going on between online 
commenters on YouTube?” in the most straightforward and 
smallest possible sets. For example, CFS3 set, shown in 
Figure 3, includes 70 commenters who were active and 
shared comments on five YouTube channels. The CFS 
model identified this set as one of the most influential sets 
hosting live streams on YouTube in the Indo-Pacific reign 
and spreading information to the maximum number of 
YouTube accounts. Besides, to describe the structure of the 
CFS3 set in-depth, Figure 3 shows the spread of commenters 
(red dots) and the channels (gray dots) in the structure of the 
co-commenter-channel network. Equally, this set is 
considered one of the top influential sets, including 
commenters from different parts of the co-commenter 
network.

Likewise, CFS3 includes commenters linked to different 
channels like “@Asumsi”; 1.27M subscribers; this 
YoutTube channel is a media-tech institution focusing on 
various affairs and pop culture that targets the younger 
Indonesian demographic as shown in Figure 3. This channel 
is interested in critical angle and telling stories from the 
unheard point of views, as we study the structure of CFS3 
links other influential commenters active on different set of 
channels [19]. Likewise, CFS3 set shows “@KOMPASTV”, 
14.3M subscribers, it is another YouTube channel in the 
Indo-Pacific region, where this channel is the rapid 
advancement of information technology, has an impact on 
the behavior of the Indonesian people, especially for 
television and KompasTV lovers. This channel focuses on 
free streaming to be at the forefront of various social media 
[20]. Other channels like “@metrotvnews” [21], 6.31M 
subscribers, and “@TRANS7 OFFICIAL” [22], 24.3M 
subscribers. 
The advantages of implementing the CFSA model would 
reveal different desires between commenters in the identified 
CFS sets. In other words, the results present that commenters 
have entirely different interests on different YouTube 
channels. These findings lead to commenters being active 
and interested increase engagement of the shared videos on 
different channels.

Figure 3. CFS sets in social networks. These three CFS sets changed the 
structure of the network as we can observe the changes before and after 
suspending these three sets from the network.  
Moreover, to evaluate the influence of CFS sets, the 
ground truth measures were utilized to measure the impact 
of each CFS set of commenters on the entire co-commenter-
channel network. For this purpose, the model suspended 
each CFS set from the network and then recalculated the GT 
measures to record the rate of the changes in the structure of

the network. For example, when the model suspends CFS3 
set shown in Figure 3 (top network), this set changed the 
structure of the network (𝐆-CFS3) to a complete sparse co-
commenter-channel network as shown in Figure 3 (bottom 
network). Furthermore, this set maximized the network’s 
modularity values (GTMOD) from 0.7 to 0.957, and 
minimized the stability (GTNS) of the network (maximized 
number of communities) from 72 stable communities to 115 
fragmented communities. Similarly, suspending CFS3 set 
from the network (G-CFS3) minimized the average 
clustering coefficient values (GTCC) from 0.029 to 0.0223. 
  
 
 
 
Figure 4. Changes in the network after suspending CFS sets. 
Furthermore, to evaluate the quality of the other 
identified CFS sets, the employed method designed to 
suspend each CFS set, recalculates the changes in the 
modularity values, the changes in the number of 
communities, and the average clustering coefficient values. 
The model procedure have to recalculate these changes after 
suspending all CFS set from the co-commenter-channel 
network. Likewise, the changes in the co-commenter-
channels YouTube networks where considered as Figure 4 
shows the changes after suspending each CFS sets. Due to 
the space limit, we will skip presenting other changes in the 
co-commenter-channels values. 
Additionally, from the GT analysis, we identified the top 
ten influential sets based on each GT values. The top ten sets 
had a greater impact on the co-commenter network 
compared to other sets, as shown in the following results.

Top ten CFS set based on GTMOD: (CFS3, CFS23, CFS24, 
CFS27, CFS28, CFS2, CFS26, CFS5, CFS19, CFS30).  
• 
Top ten CFS sets based on GTCC: (CFS3, CFS24, CFS7, 
CFS27, CFS28, CFS23, CFS9, CFS26, CFS5, CFS10). 
• 
Top ten CFS sets based on GTNS: (CFS3, CFS7, CFS4, 
CFS29, CFS24, CFS28, CFS2, CFS8, CFS15, CFS18). 
In summary, the model identified the top ten influential 
CFS sets based on three different criteria for further research 
and investigation. For example, CFS3, CFS24, and CFS28 
were in the top ten CFS sets based on three sets of measures. 
In addition, CFS3 showed an interesting structure as this set 
impacted the co-commenter-channels network the most.  
Moreover, this effort explored the utilization of multiplex 
networks and the focal structure analysis characteristics to 
detect the contextual focal structure sets on YouTube co-
commenter networks. In a methodological practice, this 
study extended the structure of the information matrix to 
relax the complexity of the added information and help to 
interpret the contextual actions of the co-commenters on 
YouTube channels.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The CFSA model presented to reveal influential sets of 
YouTube commenters; where the co-commenter-channel 
multiplex network utilized to present their online contextual 
activities. Similarly, a participation layer representation is 
employed to capture the communication network among the 
commenters, posted videos, and the interconnection between 
the two layers (through co-commenter and YouTube 
channels). To measure the performance of the model, we 
utilized YouTube datasets related to the Indo-Pacific region, 
including Cheng Ho narrative videos. Additionally, we 
implemented a systematic procedure to measure each CFS 
set’s impact on the co-commenter-channel network’s 
stability. To accomplish this goal, the model temporarily 
removed each CFS set from the network and evaluated the 
alterations in modularity values, average clustering 
coefficient values, and network stability in the co-
commenter-channels 
network. 
Finally, 
the 
model 
determined the top ten most influential CFS sets of co-
commenters and their associated YouTube channels. 
Furthermore, the model revealed that the most influential set, 
CFS3, encompasses well-subscribed channels such as 
"Asumsi"  [19],  "Erwan Tuinesia"[23], "KOMPASTV" 
[20], and "metrotvnews" [21], primarily serving the 
Indonesian community in the Indo-Pacific region. Many of 
the channels are known to espouse misinformation.  
Moreover, the characteristics of the CFSA model have 
practical implications and could be leveraged by social 
media platforms to develop and implement screening tools 
for users and communities’ contextual activities on social 
networks. The CFSA model helps to distinguish contextual 
activities beyond the focal structures on social media. In

addition, this study highlights the value of utilizing the 
multiplex network method and focal structure analysis 
models in revealing coordinating groups’ contextual 
activities and information spread on social networks.  
For future work, to improve the outcomes of the CFS 
model, we consider applying the model to small dynamic 
social networks. Next, implementing the CFSA model to 
analyze cross-platform scenarios, where this model could 
study contextual focal structure sets that simultaneously span 
across multiple social media platforms like Facebook, 
Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube.
