Abstract—The structure of the 17% N-terminal domain of 
apolipoprotein B-100, apo B-17 (or simply B17), was 
homology-modeled after the structure of the N-terminus of 
lipovitellin (LV), a protein that shares not only a sequence 
homology with B17, but also a functional aspect of lipid 
binding and transport.  The model structure was first forced to 
accommodate the six disulfide bonds found in that region, and 
then dynamically relaxed to minimize the free energy of the 
molecule.  The content of secondary structural elements in this 
model structure correlates excellently with the reported data 
from other biophysical probes.  The C-terminus of B17 shows a 
considerable homology with a conserved region in the constant 
domain of the T-cell receptor containing several residues that 
are essential in the interfacial connectivity with the variable 
domain.  This structural insight may be the first potential link 
between atherogenic LDL and inflammation.

INTRODUCTION 
Atherosclerosis is a complex disease that has been linked 
to many risk factors, including hyperlipidemia, dyslipidemia, 
high blood pressure, and endothelial dysfunction [1]. 
Oxidative modification to the small Low-density Lipoprotein 
(LDL) has been dubbed the central event that initiates and 
propagates coronary artery diseases [2][3], and therefore, 
LDL is considered a major risk factor for atherosclerosis [4]. 
It has been also shown that systemic inflammatory 
mechanisms 
may 
underlie 
the 
pathogenesis 
of 
atherosclerosis 
[5][6][7]. 
This 
is 
probably 
why 
atherosclerosis is called an inflammatory disease [8]. The 
atherosclerotic process begins when cholesterol-rich LDL 
particles accumulate in the intima, and then activate the 
endothelium [8]. Leukocyte adhesion molecules and 
chemokines help in the recruitment of monocytes and T 
cells, and thus the inflammatory pathways [8].   However, 
the specific structural interactions implicated in these 
mechanisms have not yet been elucidated.  
This report introduces a work-in-progress about the 
relation between inflammation and atherosclerosis, by 
probing the structural aspects of the apo-B. The next section 
gives some background information about the topic. It is 
followed by the experimental design.  Subsequently, the 
results are discussed. Finally, some conclusions are 
summarized at the end.  
 
II. 
BACKGROUND 
Apolipoprotein B-100 (apo B) is the sole protein 
component of LDL [9], but its large size (4536 a.a.) and the 
limitation of current experimental techniques require that it 
be studied in pieces corresponding to its structurally 
organized domains [10]-13].  Biochemical [13][14], 
calorimetric [15][16], computational [11][17]-[20], and 
spectroscopic [21][22] approaches were used to probe the 
domain arrangement and characterization of the protein, but 
no molecular structure has ever been assigned to any of the 
different domains.  These techniques, however, helped in the 
understanding of the overall arrangement of apo B on the 
LDL particle and the interactions that the various secondary 
structures have with both the lipid and aqueous phases, and 
in the ability to genetically engineer protein truncations that 
correspond to these various domains [14][23]-[25]. 
In this project, we will use the model structure of the 
17% N-terminus of apo B [10]  – the first 782 a.a. of apo B 
(17% of the full-length sequence), a region that is rich in 
disulfide bonds [26][27], essential for the secretion of the 
protein from hepatic cells [23] and behaves like an 
independent globular protein [21] – to further understand 
Figure 1.  The structure of B17 modeled after lipovitallin, with the TCR 
homology region (yellow stretch) shown magnified [11].

the C-terminus of the protein.  This part of B17 shows a 
considerable homology with a conserved region (25 aa) in 
the constant domain of the T-cell receptor (TCR) – a protein 
that is necessarily present during inflammation (Figure 1).  
It also contains several residues that are essential in the 
interfacial connectivity with the variable domain, which 
binds to the different antigens specific to each inflammatory 
pathway. We will try to establish a potential link between 
LDL 
and 
the 
inflammatory 
state 
correlated 
with 
atherosclerosis. 
III. 
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN 
The structure of B17 was modeled using Insight II 
(Accelrys Inc., Insight Modeling Environment, Release 
2000.1, San Diego: Accelrys Inc., 2002), based on the crystal 
structure of lipovitellin (LV) [11].  The secondary structure 
of the unstructured region was predicted using the Chou-
Fasman Algorithm [28], the PROF methods [29][30] and the 
Deep View modality [31] (Figure 2). The calculation will be 
performed using the CHARMm molecular dynamics 
application [32].  
 
The project will continue to have the following outputs 
and activities: 
• 
Output 1: Explore the structural characteristics of 
the potential TCR homology region; 
- 
Activity 101: Further assessment of the model 
in various solvated states; 
- 
Activity 102: In-silico exploration of the ability 
of the TCR homology region to interact with 
ligands, by probing the propensities of the 
different exposed residues; 
• 
Output 2: Study the ability of the region to adopt 
several conformations based on the lipidation state 
of the protein or the environmental conditions in the 
plasma; 
- 
Activity 201: Simulation of the various 
conditions 
to 
explore 
the 
corresponding 
conformations, by working out the energy 
minimization of the proposed structure; 
- 
Activity 202: further refinement of the model 
based on the environmental interactions and 
conditions, 
by 
introducing 
parameters 
pertaining to these conditions into the energy 
function; 
• 
Output 3: Probe the interactions that might exist 
between this particular region and inflammation 
markers, i.e., interleukins and interferon. 
- 
Activity 301: Possibility of in-vitro 
interaction between a synthesized peptide 
corresponding to the TCR homology 
region with inflammation markers; 
 
IV. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Inflammatory mechanisms have been reported to underlie 
the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis [5][6][7]. The C-
terminus of B17 shows a considerable homology to a 
conserved region in the constant domain of the T-cell 
receptor – a protein that is necessarily present during 
inflammation. It also contains several residues that are 
essential in the interfacial connectivity with the variable 
domain, which binds the different antigens specific to each 
inflammatory pathway. The current model clearly shows 
that this region is fairly exposed and flexible, which – along 
with the normal protrusion of B17 from the small dLDL 
particle – may suggest that some kind of interactions may 
take place between apo B and other cell surface proteins, 
thus mimicking or competing with the T-cells during 
atherogeneity. This model, therefore, establishes a potential 
structural link between LDL and the inflammatory state 
correlated with atherosclerosis. 
 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
In this report, a solid link between atherosclerosis and 
inflammation 
is 
established. 
During 
atherogenesis, 
Monocytes recruited upon the activation of the endothelium 
differentiate into macrophages and upregulate pattern 
recognition receptors, including scavenger receptors and 
toll-like receptors. Scavenger receptors are responsible for 
lipoprotein internalization, and hence, foam-cell formation, 
one of the major steps in the plaque formation, characteristic 
of atherosclerosis. On the other hand, toll-like receptors 
transmit effector signals that lead to the release of cytokines, 
proteases, and vasoactive molecules.  The T cells in these 
lesions recognize local antigens, and therefore, mount T 
helper-1 responses characterized by the secretion of pro-
inflammatory 
cytokines, 
which 
contribute 
to 
local 
inflammation and the growth of the plaque [8].  
While the cascade of events in the above inflammatory 
response is well organized, the structural link between the 
various players, in general, and between the oxidized LDL 
and the inflammation markers, namely the T-cells, has not 
been observed, let alone elucidated.  In the current project / 
report, an exposed amino acid stretch in the C-terminus of

the first 17% amino-terminal end of apo B-100 was found to 
adopt the structure of that of the T-cell receptor binding 
domain.  This constitutes the first evidence of a structural 
link 
between 
atherosclerosis-causing 
LDL 
and 
inflammation. 
After establishing such a link “in silico,” we anticipate 
that in vitro experimentations take place, probing the 
cytokines – and possibly interleukins – involved, then 
followed by in vivo tests to determine the real physiological 
effects correlated with such a link vis-à-vis the roles of the 
different involved factors.
