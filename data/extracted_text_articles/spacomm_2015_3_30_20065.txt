Abstract— This paper will discuss a proposed CubeSat size
(3U) telemetry system concept being developed at Marshall
Space Flight Center (MSFC) in cooperation with the U.S.
Department of the Army and Dynetics Corporation.
This
telemetry
system
incorporates
efficient,
high-bandwidth
communications by developing flight-ready, low-cost, Proto-

software
defined
radio
(SDR)
and
Electronically
Steerable Patch Array (ESPA) antenna subsystems for use on
platforms as small as CubeSats and unmanned aircraft
systems (UASs).
The current telemetry system is slightly
larger in dimension of footprint than required to fit within a
0.5U
CubeSat
volume.
Extensible
and
modular
communications
for
CubeSat
technologies
will
partially
mitigate current capability gaps between traditional strategic
space platforms and lower-cost small satellite solutions. Higher
bandwidth capacity will enable high-volume, low error-rate
data transfer to and from tactical forces or sensors operating
in austere locations (e.g., direct imagery download, unattended
ground sensor data exfiltration, interlink communications),
while
also
providing
additional
bandwidth
and
error

INTRODUCTION
This paper provides information on the Marshall Space
Flight Center (MSFC) SDR Low-Cost Transponder as well
as the Army/Dynetics Electronically Steerable Phased Array
- X-Band (ESPA-X) that contributes to advancing the state-
of-the-art in telemetry system design – directly applicable to
the SmallSat and CubeSat communities.
The SDR, called
PULSAR
–
Programmable
Ultra
Lightweight
System
Adaptable Radio – as well as the ESPA-X can be
incorporated into orbital and suborbital platforms. In doing
so, Tactically Extensible and Modular Communications - X-
Band (TEMCOM-X) will allow project/programs to perform
remote commanding capabilities, as well as real-time
payload(s) and science instruments telemetry, all of which
are self-supporting infrastructures requiring both component
and system level work to complete.
Current CubeSats do not have sufficient bandwidth for
transmit and receive to support innovative payload designs
and complex encryption schemes being developed by the
CubeSat community (academic, military, civil, industry) to
support increasing bandwidth with low error-rate demands
on the tactical edge[1].
The leap ahead technology is the
low-cost space / high-altitude qualified reconfigurable SDR
transponder for simultaneous X-band transmit and receive
communications at a minimum of 110 Mbps.
In addition,
the SDR has a highly efficient SWaP (less than 50% of
traditional Size, Weight and supply Power), which achieves
higher bits per input supply watt (at ~10 Mbits per input

watt) than traditional communication SDR systems (at
~300Kbits per input watt). [2]
Figure 1. Tactically Extensible and Modular Communications - X-Band
(TEMCOM-X)
Due to the SDR technology flexibility, TEMCOM-X can
be used on any type of aircraft, UAV, orbital, or sub-orbital
platforms and tailored to each mission’s requirements.
TEMCOM-X low cost and size, weight, and power (SWaP)
makes it attractive for CubeSat and micro satellite missions.
The matched low profile form factor electronically
steerable array antenna provides mission adaptive beam
forming
for
optimizing
signal
to
noise
ratios
with
extensibility in the design approach for future multiple
independently steerable beams from the same antenna
array.[3]
This paper will discuss the technical approach being
proposed showing the extensibility of the system.
Further
the performance of the overall system will be discussed.
TEMCOM-X will be shown to align with current NASA
Strategic Space Technology Investment Plan.[4]
The
discussion will then migrate to the Electronically Steerable
Patch Array – X-Band (ESPA-X).
The final area of
discussion will show one possible operational scenario.
II.
TECHNICAL APPROACH
The proposed TEMCOM-X Project leverages the lessons
learned
during
the
PULSAR
telemetry
system
(First
Generation) development, which used NASA funds from
FY2012-13.
The project objective is to advance the
TEMCOM-X design to a proto-flight unit, which will be
accomplished by reducing the overall size of PULSAR to fit
within a 1U form factor.
PULSAR currently uses non-
radiation tolerant hardware to keep costs low, with a clearly
defined path to radiation tolerance.
The TEMCOM-X base design will have up to four
selectable decks – power deck, processor deck, X-Band
receiver deck, and X-Band telemetry transmitter deck. The
application determines the configuration, thus the number of
decks used.
The current PULSAR power deck will be reduced in
overall footprint to meet the 1U CubeSat dimensions. The
operating voltage of TEMCOM-X is proposed to be from
16VDC to 50VDC (the same as PULSAR).
The current PULSAR Processor deck has been proposed
to provide beam-forming control for the ESPA-X antenna.
Having a processor deck dedicated to a transponder
communication system was a first in industry.
The proposed X-Band Receiver deck will leverage the IP
and lessons learned from the PULSAR S-Band Receiver.
Command and Data (uplink) capabilities will be on the order
of 150Mbps.
The transmitter deck will produce up to 2 W of radio
frequency (RF) output. The RF output power can be tailored
to any particular mission. The telemetry transmitter deck
streams data with OQPSK modulation at a maximum data
rate of 110 Mega-bits per second (Mbps).
Exemplifying flexibility, PULSAR currently transmits
using Reed-Solomon (223/255) Forward Error Correction
(FEC).
Future enhancements will include Low Density
Parity Check (LDPC, rate 7/8), or convolutional (Rate ½)
based
on
mission
requirements.
Currently
the
LDPC
encoding algorithm has been verified in simulation at MSFC
as well as in independent external testing. TEMOCOM-X
can
incorporate
other
error
correction
algorithms,
as
necessary.
The antenna array (front-end) will incorporate a planar
design consisting of multiple board layers with integrated
array circuitry to reduce the array depth.

PERFORMANCE
Table shows a market analysis of industry transponders
and differentiates their features compared to PULSAR.[5]
In comparison, the NASA-MSFC SDR incorporates the
latest in Forward Error Correcting (FEC) codes and utilizes
State-of-the-Art
electronic
components
which
give
PULSAR the capability to achieve much higher Bits-per-
Watt (the industry standard benchmark showing data rate
versus power).

PULSAR exceeds most of the other units in term of the
industry benchmark.
The L-3 TW CTX-886 exceeds
PULSAR in data rate, but PULSAR has less mass (2.1
versus 3.85 kg) and uses less power (15 versus 75 watts –
not shown in table).
The system contains sufficient RF link capacity to
achieve the desired performance while maintaining the goal
Bit Error Probability (BEP) assuming that the design goal
gain (19.76dBi) can be met.

ALIGNMENT
NASA is called, at the direction of the President and
Congress, to maintain an enterprise of technology that aligns
with missions and contributes to the Nation’s innovative
economy. NASA has been and should be at the forefront of
scientific and technological innovation. In response to these
calls, NASA generated a plan (NASA Strategic Space
Technology Investment Plan) to advance technologies and
nurture new innovation that will feed into future missions.
PULSAR aligns primarily with the Technology Area (TA) 5
– Communication & Navigation – but has connections to
other TAs in which lightweight structures, power efficiency,
and communication reliability and throughput are the
focus.[6]
V.
ESPA-X
The current proposed design of the ESPA-X includes a
radiating element that is a circularly polarized patch antenna
with +8dBi gain with a maximum 11 dB return loss (1.78
VSWR) in the band of interest. The T/R module will
transmit in horizontal polarization and receive in vertical.
This design decision prevents the need for a second
circulator adjacent to the antenna element, and it should
provide sufficient isolation between the two paths.
In order to achieve the desired 100 W (+50dBm) Effective
Radiative Power (ERP) on transmit, each of the 15 patch
antenna elements’ input power must be approximately 18.5
dBm. The transmit gain profile assumes that the +36 dBm
from the diplexer will arrive at each element after a series of
four two-way power dividers, with each divider incurring an
approximate loss of 4 dB (hence the +20 dBm input power to
the TR module transmit chain.) The transmit chain is quite
simple, with a phase shifter (nominal 7 dB loss), an
amplifier, and a harmonic reject filter (nominal 1.5 dB loss).
The receive chain gain distribution assumes a 0.4 dB loss
through the patch antenna and a 1.2 dB loss through the
front-end bandpass filter. The LNA’s noise figure of 0.6 dB
is sufficient to insure that the overall transmit chain’s noise
figure will remain below the required 2.5 dB.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIO
The operational scenario in the graphic shown in the
Introduction depicts U.S. and Partner nation (PN) small-unit
forces operating beyond line-of-sight communications with
their command center, and in close proximity to hostile
forces. The U.S. and PN units have deployed unattended
ground
sensors
(UGS)
in
key
location
for
remote
reconnaissance, and are supported by low-earth-orbit (LEO)
assets that incorporate both PULSAR and ESPA-X. The
communications requirements of the U.S. and PN forces
include:
– Encrypted voice between the small units and the
command center;
– Imagery and other map-based data between the small
units and the command center;

– Frequent, periodic polling of UGS with forwarding of
trigger information from the UGS to the small units and the
command center; and
– Relay of imagery, full-motion video (FMV), and other
near-real-time
data
from
airborne
and
orbital
sensor
platforms to the small units and the command center.
These communications requirements are individually
serviceable
through
existing
systems,
and
collectively
serviceable through combinations of existing systems, but
TEMCOM-X provides unique advantages, to include:
– Increased bandwidth to service larger data demands
with fewer assets;
– Multiple beam-forming to provide simultaneous access
to frequency bands with reduced error rates;
– Provides high rate bandwidth for satellite interlink
communications;
– Full duplex transmit and receive for maximizing
communication opportunities;
– Tailored spot beams for prioritized service to critical
assets; and
–
Dynamically
adaptable
waveforms
to
support
multiple disparate systems simultaneously.
VII.
CONCLUSION
The TEMCOM-X concept is currently in the late
formulation
stages
and
has
been
proposed
for
full
implementation to develop and test a protoflight unit of the
integrated PULSAR-X and ESPA-X technologies to support
X band communication systems for cubesat and small
aircraft platform compatibility.
TEMCOM-X leverages existing Marshall Space Flight
Center
SDR
designs
and
commercially
enhanced
capabilities. Innovations will
(1)
Reduce the cost of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and
Deep Space transponders,
(2)
Increase data through-put,
(3)
Decrease power requirements, and
(4)
Reduce volume.
Also, TEMCOM-X concept increases
flexibility to
implement multiple transponder types by utilizing the same
hardware with altered logic – no hardware change required –
all of which will eventually be accomplished in orbit. The
flexibility permits CubeSat and SmallSat programs to select
only what they need for their mission.
TEMCOM-X
offers
high
capability,
low
cost,
transponders to programs of all sizes.
The final project
outcome will be the introduction of a low-cost CubeSat to
SmallSat telemetry system.
The potential future TEMCOM-X Roadmap includes
adaptation into options such as C-Band and Ka-Band. These
technologies are proposed for continued development.
