Abstract—This paper presents evaluation data following the 
revision of the delivery method for an anatomy and physiology 
module for pre-registration healthcare practitioners, into a 
blended (hybrid) model. This subject is recognized as 
problematic when delivered by traditional methods, therefore 
change was instigated to introduce stimulating, interactive 
material; this was presented though use of e-learning tools to 
supplement the face-to-face sessions. The evaluation data 
consists of student outcomes from the hybrid mode of delivery 
compared with previous cohorts using the traditional methods, 
plus student satisfaction surveys from the students undertaking 
the module by blended learning. Results of the evaluation have 
identified that student outcomes for the new delivery method 
are demonstrating a trend for improvement for a multiple-
choice exam, with no significant difference noted for a seen 
exam. The survey determined that the majority of students 
indicated satisfaction with the overall quality of the module, 
with the teaching methods, with the content and with the 
support provided to them. Therefore, this study suggests that a 
well designed blended learning system, with good academic 
content and interactive exercises are motivating for learning 
and yields as good, if not better, outcomes as a lecture. The 
module delivery will continue to be enhanced through the 
addition of synchronous chat facilities and online social 
network tools.

BACKGROUND 
This paper focuses on a significant change to the delivery 
method of an anatomy and physiology module in the first 
year of an undergraduate pre-registration course for 
Operating Department Practitioners (ODPs), a healthcare 
discipline regulated by the Health Professions Council, in 
the United Kingdom (UK).  
Literature indicates that anatomy and physiology are 
amongst the subjects that many healthcare students find 
hardest [1,2], but this knowledge is vital as it underpins 
clinical practice.  
Delivery of the material had traditionally been by lecture, 
with drawings and anatomical models, and more recently 
digital images and video, being used in support. Cadaver 
prosection and dissection have also been employed within 
medic (doctor) education [3], but this is not usual practice in 
the courses of other healthcare disciplines.  
Evidence suggests that the traditional lecture-based 
model of delivery may be a contributory factor in the 
problems encountered by students [4-8]. Also, Government 
policies related to higher education in the UK have indicated 
that effective use of technology-assisted student-focused 
learning is essential for the future [9-12].  
In consideration of both of these factors, the module 
delivery was reviewed and a blended (hybrid) model was 
adopted, which utilizes both face-to-face and e-learning 
delivery of content. The theoretical foundation upon which 
this revision is based is constructivism and cognitive 
learning theory, with the 5E enquiry model [13] being 
applied in development of the online tools. 
This change aimed to provide fresh stimuli to the 
delivery, in order to promote students’ learning of anatomy 
and 
physiology 
through 
questioning, 
investigating, 
challenging, seeking feedback, and learning to consider 
interactions with other team members [14]. 
This paper begins by presenting evidence that supports 
the need for change, and offers an overview of the potential 
benefits and issues that may be encountered when using e-
learning; this aims to explain why the hybrid system was 
adopted.  The revised delivery structure is described, and the 
paper then progresses to discuss data collection and analysis 
of an evaluation that was undertaken on the students’ 
outcomes and their views on the delivery. The data is 
analysed and then discussed in relation to current literature, 
and finally future developmental plans are presented. 
II. 
RATIONALE FOR CHANGE 
This study is based on a module where the students are 
taught normal and altered anatomy and physiology of eleven 
human body systems such as the Cardiovascular, Muscular, 
Respiratory, and Skeletal Systems, underpinned by the 
concept of homeostasis. The anatomy element of the content 
requires students to identify component parts and structure 
of the body systems, whereas the physiology requires them 
to understand the function. Homeostasis is the process of 
maintaining a balance across the body systems, supporting 
both physical and psychological function. Safe and 
competent clinical practice is founded upon an accurate 
knowledge and understanding of this material, and the 
variations that do occur [15].  
In healthcare education literature the subjects of anatomy 
and physiology have been clearly identified as problematic 
[16, 17], as there is a strong indication that students find the

subject very difficult [1,18,19], which is almost certainly a 
contributory factor to the reports that students fear the subject 
[19-21], are dissatisfied with the teaching [4-8], have high 
fail rates in assessments [2], and have difficulty in applying 
the theory to clinical practice [4,5,22]. There is general 
agreement that these subjects require educators to explore, 
and where possible implement, innovative approaches to 
ensure quality learning of these important topics [2,8,23]. 
III. 
DELIVERY METHODS 
Lectures have traditionally been viewed as a very 
inexpensive way of presenting new ideas and concepts to a 
large group of students. However, lecturing has been 
described as an ineffective tool for promoting theoretical 
understanding of concepts [24], and lectures rarely stimulate 
student thinking and get information beyond the students’ 
short-term memory [25,26]. In lectures students usually 
assume passive roles as listeners while the tutor imparts the 
information. Educating in this way is too focused on what is 
being delivered, rather than the learners and their needs [27]. 
But, teaching the same content can be made more 
interesting, and students can become active, independent 
learners, if different delivery methods are used [28].  
However, just as an effective educator should consider 
individual differences among students and adjust teaching 
strategies accordingly [29], the selection of appropriate 
technological tools needs the same consideration [30], and 
their use should be integral to the process of learning, not 
obviously an addition [31]. 
An evaluation of technology-enhanced learning (also 
commonly referred to as e-learning) used in healthcare 
education identified that the different tools that are available 
span from instructivist to constructivist approaches, as set 
out in the e-Learning Ladder [32, adapted by 33] (Figure 1). 
Instructivist learning theory is teacher-focused where  
 
Figure 1.  E-learning ladder [33] 
knowledge is transferred from the ‘instructor’ to the passive 
recipient (the student). Whereas in Constructivist theory it is 
the student, rather than teacher, who is the focus and 
‘constructs’ new knowledge through analysis, experience 
and understanding. The latter describes the approach that is 
needed in order to move away from the traditional delivery 
of anatomy and physiology, and the Ladder identifies that 
opportunities for learners to be active in creating their own 
knowledge and understanding can be offered through Web 
2.0 technologies, such as discussion boards. These Web 2.0 
applications allow students to not only retrieve information 
but also provide a platform to create and own the data within 
them [34]. These tools can be used as an alternative or in 
addition to traditional lectures; either way results in more 
learner-centred teaching [35]. 
When used appropriately in education, interactive 
technological strategies have been identified as enriching 
student 
learning 
[36,37], 
and 
this 
occurs 
through 
decentralizing the teaching process, and in doing so 
facilitating learner independence [38] and through active 
engagement in the learning process [39]. The potential of e-
learning to deliver innovative approaches specifically in 
healthcare education is recognized [40,41], and interactive 
multimedia e-learning systems have been highlighted as 
working particularly well when used in biological science 
courses [33,42,43].  
One determination of effectiveness can be student 
satisfaction, and the last decade has produced clear empirical 
evidence of positive attitudes by healthcare students toward 
e-learning [44-50].  
Another, equally as important consideration, is the effect 
that this mode of delivery has on student outcomes, and 
evidence supports the supposition that technology-enhanced 
teaching used in the fields of health and science positively 
influences students' learning outcomes [51-55]. Indeed, in a 
study of a blended learning course [56], students had higher 
final grades compared to students studying the same course 
in a traditional manner. Also, another group of students 
studying a Cardiovascular element of a course demonstrated 
significant improvement in their performance after using the 
technological tools that were made available to them via a 
website [37]. Similar improvements in performance by both 
on-campus and distance-learning students undertaking e-
learning anatomy courses suggests that this method can be 
used successfully to teach this subject [57, 58].  
There are also indirect benefits in using technology-
enhanced learning, such as the development of students’ 
computer skills [59]. However, this is directly relevant to 
one problem commonly associated with e-learning, because 
just as with any genre of course, learners need to have the 
appropriate resources in order to be successful. These 
resources in an e-learning context can be classified as 
‘External’ to the learner, such as slow Internet connections 
or older computers, and ‘Internal’ to the learner, which may 
be a lack of the necessary computer skills. Without these 
resources, accessing the course materials can be difficult and

the learners’ performance can be hindered [60], and it can 
also cause anxiety [61], which can lead to lack of motivation 
[44,62,63], which may ultimately result in students 
becoming frustrated and giving up [64-66], or could even 
cause them to avoid enrolling on e-learning courses [67,68]. 
So although, as indicated previously, the students’ 
information technology (IT) skills may unintentionally be 
enhanced through this mode of learning, the very fact that 
improvement in these skills may be needed, could in itself 
adversely affect students’ uptake and progress on an e-
learning course. However, it has also been identified that an 
initial lack of confidence can be replaced by positive 
excitement once the initial experience of e-learning has 
taken place [69-74]. 
A lack of computer skills may also result in students on 
an e-learning course feeling isolated from the tutor, due to 
them struggling to use the online communication methods; 
this has resulted in them indicating a preference for face-to-
face teacher-centred learning  [75,76]. Also, younger 
students who had just recently finished years of compulsory 
education, with its requirement for attendance in class, felt 
that they too were more comfortable face-to-face with a 
tutor [77]. So, for the tutor using any form of technology-
enhanced learning, there is a clear requirement that human-
to-human interactions must take place, for teaching, support, 
and to build a sense of community amongst those 
undertaking the course [62]. 
IV. 
PROGRAMME STRUCTURE 
The theoretical foundation of the module delivery is 
constructivism, however cognitive learning theory is also 
considered [78], which suggests that if students are active in 
their learning, they will achieve more, through assimilation 
of the knowledge, leading to better comprehension. 
Alongside this, the online elements were developed using 
the ‘5E enquiry cycle’ [13], as indicated in Table I. The 5E 
inquiry process is recommended as an effective means to 
help students to understand science-related subjects, and to

apply theory to authentic situations needed for the real world 
[79].  
The delivery pattern for the module includes both face-
to-face and e-learning sessions, the latter through use of the 
University’s virtual learning environment (VLE). VLEs 
provide a repository function and allow space for online 
interactions between students and staff; they are reported as 
being widely used in subjects such as nursing and social 
sciences [80-82]. The rationale for using this blended 
(hybrid) delivery was to utilize a variety of systems that 
would potentially appeal to a range of students’ preferred 
styles of learning, to promote interactions, both face-to-face 
and online, and to foster a sense of community. 
The module is timetabled for delivery over a three-week 
period, and the division of the delivery methods is split 
30:70 in favour of e-learning. The first day of the module 
takes place on campus, where the required logistical and 
administrative activities are initially carried out, followed by 
team building exercises, which are designed to introduce the 
students to each other and to facilitate the creation of social 
networks. The students are then placed into groups, which 
relate to how they will be distributed within the VLE, and a 
further team-based activity takes place, this time online, 
using the computers in the lab. This introduces the students 
to the virtual learning environment and aims to provide a 
guided tour through the system. During this activity the tutor 
demonstrates what is required via projection of their own 
computer onto a large screen in the lab, which gives real-
time assistance and support; whilst reviewing progress 
during the activity, the tutor also takes this opportunity to 
identify any students who appear to lack basic computing 
skills, and discreet guidance is provided on the appropriate 
student support mechanisms that are available within the 
institution.   
The remainder of the first day, and each of the face-to-
face sessions that follow, consist of ‘traditional’ lectures and 
some active-learning methods that encourage student 
learning [83-85]. All of the material that is delivered during 
the on-campus sessions is also provided within the VLE, 
alongside the resources for the e-learning activities.  
The second day of the module is an e-learning day, with 
the third being on-campus again; the latter provides the tutor 
with an early opportunity to address any computing issues 
that the students may have encountered during the second 
day’s activities. The remainder of the programme is 
allocated across the days that are left, ensuring that the 
virtual learning is interspersed by face-to-face sessions on 
regular intervals. 
On days designated for e-learning, the students are not 
required to attend campus, providing they have access to 
appropriate computing equipment. If they do not, or if they 
just choose to come onto the campus, then the resources are 
available within the computing labs. The activities for each 
day are in the VLE, within folders labeled by date, providing 
a structured plan for the students, setting the pace of learning 
within the framework of the time available; this strategy

aims to encourage the students to develop basic time 
management techniques [86-87]. 
Within each activity folder, the students are presented 
with various resources, including podcasts, videos, and links 
to online resources outside of the institution. Having 
reviewed the materials, the students then access their group 
discussion board, where they aim to address questions 
relative to their virtual patient.  
This virtual patient is first introduced to the groups 
during the VLE activity on day one, where they are given an 
image of the patient (created by the tutor using an avatar 
building tool), and a brief pen picture giving information 
such as age, height, and weight; each group has a slightly 
different character. As the programme progresses, the tutor 
adds information to the patient profile, relevant to the body 
systems the students have studied that day, either on-campus 
or via e-learning. At the same time as building the profile, 
the tutor challenges the students’ understanding by setting 
questions relevant to their particular patient and the body 
systems being discussed. For example, on the day where the 
endocrine system is studied, the virtual patients’ blood sugar 
levels might be made available, and the students then need 
to determine if they are within normal parameters, and if not, 
what might be the cause, how it might be managed and the 
long-term effect on the patient. This patient-based approach 
allows students to look for solutions by engaging in 
independent study, reviewing data, and reflecting on their 
own learning experience. Learning anatomy through a 
clinical perspective is said to result in better recall and 
understanding amongst students [88]. 
All of this takes place within asynchronous discussion 
forums, with both the students and the tutor contributing to 
the content. The tutor’s role is that of e-facilitator, or e-
moderator, ensuring that the appropriate learning takes place 
in the discussions and that all members of the group make 
contributions. To promote this, all group members are given 
an identifier, a number 1 to 6, and the tutor targets the 
questions to a particular member of the group, by number. 
Once this person has satisfactorily responded to the 
question, the tutor opens it for contributions by the other 
members of the group. This aims to mimic the control that 
the tutor has in the traditional classroom, and prevents any 
enthusiastic members of the group from contributing more 
than their less eager classmates [33]. This method of control 
also addresses the issue of lurkers, namely those who access 
and benefit from others’ contributions without interacting 
themselves [44,89].  
Small group learning was implemented as it has emerged 
as being well suited to developing anatomical understanding, 
as has peer assisted learning [23]. The group process enables 
students to develop problem solving skills fundamental to 
developing their understanding; in doing so they learn to 
search for knowledge using the available resources, and to 
work in teams. Based on the contributions to the forum, the 
tutor evaluates progress based on the students’ knowledge 
building, problem solving and development of their 
interpersonal skills [90]. 
Formative testing takes place once a week during one of 
the on-campus days, and it is based on all of the body 
systems that have been covered up to that point. The testing 
is carried out in the computer labs using the computer-based 
examination tools that are used for the summative 
assessment for the module. This not only provides both the 
tutor and the students with feedback on the students’ 
progress with their studies [91], but also allows the students 
to practice with the interface and process prior to the final 
assessment, which has been shown to improve student 
performance [92-94].  
The final day of the module delivery is on-campus. Here 
the students are presented with a new virtual patient, one not 
previously used by any of the groups, and the same type of 
question and answer process that the students have 
experienced within the discussion forums takes place in the 
classroom, but based on this new patient’s parameters. The 
activity takes place within a quiz format with the groups 
competing against each other, and points being awarded for 
correct answers; a token prize is awarded to the winning 
group. Presenting the material in this way acknowledges the 
importance of the cognitive component of the activity (e.g., 
selecting, organizing, and integrating knowledge) to promote 
meaningful learning [95].  
The two summative examinations take place several 
weeks later, following a period of time where the students 
undertake self-directed study and have tutorial support, as 
requested.  
V. 
DATA COLLECTION 
 The module is delivered twice per academic year, 
September and March, with approximately 32 and 24 
students per cohort respectively; the revised programme was 
implemented two years ago.  
Overall student performance in the module was 
measured by outcomes in the two computer-based 
summative assessments; data is presented for two cohorts 
prior to the implementation of the revised programme (the 
control group), and four cohorts since. Assessment one is a 
multiple-choice exam, which is divided into the body 
systems that have been covered in the teaching, with ten 
questions per system. Assessment two is a seen exam that 
includes fill-in-the-blank items, diagram labeling, and two or 
three short-answer essay questions.  
The grading scale used is the standard institutional 
system for Foundation-level modules, where grades 40% 
and above are awarded a Pass; 39% and below are Referred. 
(N.B. students are given their actual grades in the feedback, 
to inform their development). 
Students’ perceptions of the module were also measured 
using the institution’s end-of-semester online student 
evaluation system. This comprises twelve statements divided 
into two sections, plus a free-text area for qualitative 
responses. All statements were linked to a 5-part Likert-
scaled data collection tool: strongly agree – agree – neutral –

disagree – strongly disagree [96]. All statements were 
worded positively; in other words, a higher score indicated a 
more favorable response. The online evaluation system was 
only recently introduced, so data is only available for the 
four cohorts who have undertaken the revised module 
structure. 
VI. 
DATA ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION 
As indicated previously, four cohorts have undertaken the 
revised module structure. The assessment results indicate a 
trend of improvement in exam one with the multiple-choice 
questions, and no significant difference in exam two, the seen 
exam, among the study group (cohorts 3 to 6) as compared 
with the control group  (cohorts 1 and 2); see Figure 2. 
The outcomes for exam one reflect previous findings that 
students experiencing computer-enhanced delivery have 
significantly higher post-test scores than groups receiving 
the same content by lecture; indicating that a higher level of 
cognition was achieved by these groups [97,98]. This is in 
contrast to a report where no significant differences was 
found in a multiple-choice test that compared lectures and e-
learning groups [99], and disagrees with recent evidence 
which found that students being taught by traditional 
methods achieved better performance in multiple-choice 
examinations when compared with e-learning students 
[100]. 
In comparison, the results for the seen exam (exam two) 
agreed with reports of no statistically significant difference 
in the post-test scores between a group on a technology-
enhanced course and a lecture group [75,101,102]. These 
findings appear to indicate no significant difference in the 
retention of material, as has been reported between groups 
who learned by e-learning and by traditional methods 
[103,104]. This is in contrast with findings that traditionally 
taught 
students 
have 
demonstrated 
slightly 
better 
performance in examinations in comparison with online 
students [105]. 
Similar to other findings [106,107], the majority of 
students in all four of the groups that have experienced the 
blended delivery model indicated satisfaction with the 
overall quality of the module within their evaluations. The 
responses to the Likert-scale evaluation significantly 
reflected positive views that the majority of the students

found the module to be well sequenced and stimulating, the 
discussion forum format clear and simple to follow, and that 
there was good quality feedback and support available to 
them when needed, (Table II). This is in accordance with 
other studies where students positively rated technology- 
enhanced courses [101,108-110], and would recommend it 
to other students [109].  
Many students also utilized the ‘Any other comments’ 
free-text box to provide further responses; one common 
theme being that the weekly formative tests were helpful, 
motivating, and deepened their understanding of the material. 
Some students commented on computer problems; they 
reported a few ‘teething problems’ during the early stages 
that could have become more serious, but the students 
positively mentioned how these were discussed and 
addressed by the tutor during the face-to-face sessions. This 
supports earlier findings that a frequently experienced 
negative comment related to e-learning programs was 
students’ early frustration with the use of the computer itself 
[111]; in this study it was the access to the tutor that 
prevented possible escalation of what were initially perceived 
as minor issues.

discussion forum. Some students indicated that they felt able 
to think more deeply and carefully about the subject before 
writing a response, as compared to giving verbal responses; 
this has previously been reported [112,113]. They 
particularly favoured the opportunity to review literature and 
prepare informed evidence-based responses, although at 
times this was felt to slow the discussions somewhat. 
A number of students also made comment on the positive 
interactions they had experienced with the tutor within the 
virtual environment, and how there appeared to be a 
continuous tutor presence. The tutor, obviously, was not 
online 24/7, but by using the subscription facility within the 
VLE, the tutor was able to receive email notification of 
student participation in the forum, which promoted timely 
review and contributions as appropriate. This provided the 
students with the perception that the tutor was constantly 
checking the discussion board, which in turn produced the 
positive feedback. These comments suggest that the tutor 
was able to overcome one area of support commonly 
receiving negative feedback; participants in an earlier study 
[112] reported that they felt a lack of immediacy in 
responses in the online element of their course, in 
comparison to what they expected from a face-to-face class 
discussion. This appears to be especially obvious in 
asynchronous interactions taking place within discussion 
boards, where students have reported frustration due to 
delays in getting responses [113,114]. 
The regular face-to-face sessions also received positive 
comment, with the students indicating that these enabled 
members of the group to ‘make connections’ with the tutor 
and other classmates. These connections could be interpreted 
as the building blocks associated with forming a community, 
which 
would 
continue 
within 
the 
virtual 
learning 
environment. This is significant, as a relationship between 
students’ perceived feelings of community and apparent 
cognitive learning has been indicated [115]; the stronger the 
online learners’ sense of community, the less isolated they 
felt. Continuous support and feedback as noted in the 
literature [44,61,106,116] appear to be essential in 
facilitating 
effective 
e-learning; 
this 
would 
support 
suggestions that technological tools alone cannot completely 
replace traditional teaching methods [117] as they both have 
their own advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, 
delivering anatomy and physiology using traditional 
methods along with technological methods could benefit 
various learners to achieve the course objectives [37].   
VII. LIMITATIONS 
This is a small-scale study and the data was drawn from 
a specific module with a limited number of participants. The 
study may have been influenced by factors specific to the 
student groups, which are not immediately evident from the 
findings. Also, experiences external to the module content 
and delivery may have contributed to student outcomes and 
opinions. Finally, the student satisfaction data is only 
gathered from those who have undertaken the revised 
module structure, so no comparison in this area can be made 
with students who have undertaken this module in the 
traditional mode of delivery. 
VIII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this module, the application of constructivist learning 
theory means following a pedagogy that provides learners 
with the opportunity to interact with sensory data, and build 
their own understanding; whilst cognitive learning theory 
requires students to be active in their learning, leading to 
further understanding. Integration of the 5Es enquiry process 
further allows this to be applied by giving students the 
opportunity to review their prior knowledge and construct 
new comprehension that arises from solving problems. The 
revised programme evaluated in this paper aims to combine 
these principles through enhancing the traditional content 
delivery with technological tools in a blended mode of 
delivery.  
The electronic resources not only enhance the traditional 
methods of teaching but also offer new and exciting ways of 
presenting the material to the students. However, in 
designing the programme it was acknowledged that the 
benefits of using technology are accompanied by challenges, 
which were best overcome by not totally moving away from 
some elements of traditional delivery. Whilst teaching and 
learning are no longer confined to the classroom, spending 
some time in this environment would appear to positively 
contribute to the overall experience of the learner. 
Technology is not a solution for all learning environments, 
but through careful determination as to which interventions 
can be used to effectively teach content, the optimum 
conditions may be achieved. 
In addition it is important to acknowledge that students 
require the necessary resources to make optimum use of the 
materials, therefore the responsibility of educators is to 
appropriately support programmes to ensure learners are not 
disadvantaged, through provision of adequate hardware, and 
evaluation of student abilities. Finally, there is a need to 
promote the creation of a community or feelings of 
connection in virtual learning environments; including 
strategies for community building into the design of the 
course, particularly in the role of the tutor to facilitate such, 
appears to assist with this.  
Future work will include continual evaluation of the 
module to ensure the students continue to demonstrate 
satisfaction with it. Also, a synchronous (chat) discussion 
tool will be added to the e-learning component of the 
structure, and an in-house social network environment, 
similar to Facebook, will be produced, both are in 
consideration of furthering the constructivism foundation of 
the module.
