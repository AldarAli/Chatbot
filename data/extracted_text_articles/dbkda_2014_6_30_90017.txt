Abstract—Literature-based discovery (LBD) is focusing on
automatically generating scientiﬁc hypotheses by uncovering hid-
den, previously unknown relations between existing knowledge.
Co-occurrences between biomedical concepts can be represented
by a network that consists of a set of nodes representing concepts
and a set of edges representing their relationships. In this work
we propose a method for link prediction of implicit connections
between Medical Subject Headings (MeSH
R
⃝) descriptors. Our
approach is complementary to standard LBD. Link prediction
was performed using Jaccard and Adamic-Adar similarity mea-
sures. Preliminary results showed high prediction performance
with area under the ROC curve of 0.78 and 0.82 for Jaccard and
Adamic-Adar coefﬁcient, respectively.

I. INTRODUCTION
Retrieval and linking different chunks of scientiﬁc informa-
tion into understandable and interpretable knowledge becomes
a challenging task. Text mining technologies complement
manual information retrieval from biomedical sources [1].
Common text mining tasks in biomedicine include the recogni-
tion of explicit facts from the literature, document summariza-
tion, question answering and literature-based discovery (LBD).
LBD is a methodology for automatically generating hy-
potheses for scientiﬁc research by uncovering hidden, pre-
viously unknown relationships between existing knowledge
[2]. The LBD methodology was pioneered by Swanson [3],
who proposed that dietary ﬁsh oils might be used to treat
Raynauds disease because they lower blood viscosity, reduce
platelet aggregation and inhibit vascular reactivity. The basic
assumption of Swansons approach is that there exists two
scientiﬁc domains that do not communicate. A segment of
knowledge in one domain may be related to knowledge in
the other domain, but this relationship is unknown. The
methodology of LBD relies on the idea of concepts relevant
to three literature domains: X, Y, and Z. For example, suppose
a researcher has found relationship between disease X and a
gene Y. Further suppose that a separate researcher has studied
the effects of substance Z on gene Y. The use of LBD may
suggest an XZ relationship, indicating that substance Z may
potentially treat disease X.
Associations between literature entities based on co-
occurrence of biomedical terms, such as diseases or genes con-
stitute an important part of knowledge representation. A co-
occurrence approach is built on the assumption that biomedical
concepts occurring together in the same title or abstract are in
some way biologically related [4], [5]. Biomedical knowledge
can be thus viewed as a set of concepts along with the relations
between them. Interactions between concepts can be described
in terms of a graph, consisting of nodes and edges, where
the former represent concepts and the latter represent their
relationships. Knowledge network is not static. It is a dynamic
structure that evolves over time either by addition of new nodes
or by new links that form between nodes.
Link prediction is a newly emerging research ﬁeld that is at
the intersection of the network analysis and machine learning.
Understanding the mechanisms of link formation in complex
networks is a long standing challenge for network analysis.
Link prediction refers to the discovery of future links between
nodes that are not directly connected in the current snapshot
of a given network [6]. Seen in this way, the link prediction
problem is similar to LBD. In the literature several link
prediction techniques have been proposed. These techniques
can be used to predict new link formation by estimating the
likelihood of link formation between two nodes on the basis
of the observed network topology.
In this work we propose a method for link prediction in
biomedical domain, i.e. for prediction and evaluation of im-
plicit or previously unknown connections between biomedical
concepts. Our approach is complementary to the traditional
LBD. To evaluate the link prediction techniques for LBD,
here we investigate the performance of link prediction tech-
niques for networks obtained from Medical Subject Headings
(MeSH R
⃝) [7] co-occurrence data.
II. METHODS
A. Basic Terminology
A network is represented by a graph G(V, E) that consists
of a set of nodes V representing concepts and a set of edges E
representing relationships between the nodes [8]. The number
of edges of a node i is denoted by its degree ki.
The link prediction problem can be formally represented as
follows. Suppose we have a network G[t1, t2] which contains
all interactions among nodes that take place in the time interval
[t1, t2]. Further suppose that [t3, t4] is a time interval occurring
after [t1, t2]. The task of link prediction is to provide a list of
edges that are present in G[t3, t4] but absent in G[t1, t2]. We

refer to G[t1, t2] as the train network and G[t3, t4] as the test
network (Figure 1). In this work the prediction was performed
on a core subnetwork which consists of nodes which have at
least k = 3 neighbors.
B. Data Collection and Network Construction
The train and test networks were constructed from the Uni-
ﬁed Medical Language System (UMLS R
⃝) [9] co-occurrence
table (MRCOC). MRCOC table includes statistical aggrega-
tions of co-occurrences of biomedical concepts in different
data sources. Two overall frequencies of MEDLINE R
⃝ co-
occurrence are provided: one for recent MEDLINE data
(MED) and one for MEDLINE data from a preceding block
of years (MBD). MRCOC provides the frequency of co-
occurrence of two concepts in the same indexed articles
from MEDLINE (i.e., the number of articles discussing both
concepts during a given time period). We select only those
co-occurrence pairs that refer to MeSH descriptors.
The constructed networks were post-processed to remove
all non-useful edges. We applied the Pearsons chi-square (χ2)
test for independence for each co-occurrence pair to obtain a
statistic, which indicates whether a particular pair of MeSH
descriptors occurs together more often than by chance [10].
If χ2 is greater than the critical value of 3.84 (p ≤ 0.05), we
can be 95% conﬁdent that a particular MeSH relation occurs
more often than by chance.
C. Experimental Setup
The link prediction framework we use follows the procedure
ﬁrst introduced by Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg [11]. We
perform link prediction using proximity measures. Proximity
measures are used to ﬁnd similarity between a pair of nodes.
For each node pair (u, v), a link prediction method gives
score s(u, v), an estimate of the likelihood of link formation
between nodes u and v. Among various proximity measures
proposed in the literature we use Jaccard and Adamic-Adar
coefﬁcients. Jaccard coefﬁcient measures the probability that
a neighbor of u or v is a neighbor of both u and v [12].
Jaccard coefﬁcient simply divides the number of common
neighbors by the number of total neighbors. Adamic-Adar
coefﬁcient measures neighborhood overlap between nodes u
and v, weighting the overlap of smaller neighborhoods more
heavily [13].
We examine how accurately we can predict which node
pairs will connect between times t3 and t4 despite not having
any co-occurrences before time t3. The major challenge in
prediction evaluation is the huge number of possible node
pairs which can greatly increase computational time. To cope
with this issue we use bootstrap resampling approach [14].
We use 100 bootstrap samples. In each bootstrap step we
draw a random sample of 1000 nodes and create appropriate
train and test subgraphs. Next, we compute the link prediction
score s(u, v) for each node pair (u, v) that is not associated
with any interaction before time t3 by using one of the link
prediction techniques introduced in the previous paragraph.
We assign class label ‘positive’ to this node pair if the

The prediction performance was evaluated using the receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curves. A ROC graph depicts
relative tradeoffs between true positives and false positives. As
a measure of prediction performance we use the area under
the ROC curve (AUC). The AUC is a widely used performance
measure which can be interpreted as the probability that a
randomly selected link is given a higher link prediction score
than a randomly selected non-existent link. Final AUC value
was averaged over 100 bootstrap samples.
III. RESULTS
Before evaluating the effectiveness of link prediction tech-
niques, we describe the characteristics of the used datasets.
The MBD network consists of 24,225 nodes and 4,897,380
edges. We ﬁlter out all non-useful edges using χ2 test. After
reduction the MBD network contains 3,328,288 edges. The
MED network contains 25,570 nodes and 5,615,965 edges.
After the ﬁltering step, the number of edges decreased to
3,810,535. The topological properties of both networks are
summarized in Table I. Both networks are very similar re-
garding topological properties. The networks exhibit relatively
short average path length between all pairs of nodes. On
average there are only about two hops from the selected
node to any other node. Both networks exhibit small world
property because of small average path length and relatively
high clustering.
The classiﬁcation performance is summarized in Figure 2.
Mean AUC for Jaccard coefﬁcient was AUC = 0.78 with
SD = 0.02. Mean AUC for Adamic-Adar coefﬁcient was
AUC = 0.82 with SD = 0.01. Adamic-Adar coefﬁcient
exhibited slightly better performance than Jaccard coefﬁcient.
IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we apply and evaluate link prediction meth-
ods on a network based on co-occurrence patterns between
MeSH descriptors. We have exploited two methods for link
prediction task, namely Jaccard and Adamic-Adar coefﬁcients
and demonstrated that link prediction is plausible with high
prediction performance. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the ﬁrst work that investigates unsupervised learning for
link prediction of literature-derived network in the biomedical
domain.
There are many possible directions for future work. One is
to consider addition similarity measures, including preferential
attachment, Katz measure, SimRank, or cosinus similarity, to

name just a few. Second, we should investigate prediction per-
formance of link prediction algorithm on different networks.
Biomedical science is full of interesting complex networks; for
example we should consider NCBI gene or protein network,
KEGG collection, or UniProt database.
Further we should investigate the connection between net-
work attributes and prediction performance. It is well known
that nodes which share similar properties tend to create links
to each other. For example, persons in a social network who
share similar interests are very likely to be friends [15]. In our
case we could use attributes such as number of occurrences
of particular MeSH descriptor, semantic type from UMLS
Semantic Network, etc. We should also systematically analyze
the inﬂuence of network topology on prediction performance.
The process of link creation may be a result of the joint
inﬂuence of several mechanisms such as small world effect
and preferential attachment.
