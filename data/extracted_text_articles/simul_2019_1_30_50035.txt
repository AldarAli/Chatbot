Abstract—Even though the relevance of the “human factor” for
the performance of work processes is well known, the design and
optimization of such processes, e.g., in factories, often strongly
focuses on machines. Especially intrinsic mental states as strain
and motivation can inﬂuence the human workers’ performance
and thus the organizational outcome. This paper proposes an
agent-based model of human work processes with respect to these
intrinsic states. To this end, the well-established job demands-
resources model is utilized. Experiments are presented that out-
line the model’s capability to produce plausible results concerning
the human work performance and the mutual inﬂuences between
job demands, resources, and the intrinsic mental states of strain
and motivation.

INTRODUCTION
Peoples’ workplaces are constantly changing, especially
as digitalization progresses. This digital revolution should be
oriented towards employees’ needs. Yet, people often subordi-
nate to IT systems and thus disempower themselves [1]. For
example, a scheduling system in a call center distributes calls
without considering inidividual needs. The consequences are
not only physical but also psychological strains like burn-out.
Digital change should not be rejected generally, as it has
potentials for making work processes more efﬁcient. Current
approaches for designing and optimizing work processes, e.g.,
the production of goods in a factory, often make use of
simulation and focus on machine processes such as predictive
maintenance or throughput time optimization. Here, downtimes
of machines or queuing strategies are analyzed to identify
optimal process conﬁgurations. In reality, however, human
workers can also inﬂuence the performance of such production
processes, e.g., due to unavailability, distractions, or overload.
Existing frameworks for the analysis of industrial service pro-
vision processes often neglect the human factor and only allow
for the modeling and simulation of machines in production
lines.
In a production plant, human workers may be assigned
a series of orders with different difﬁculties to be processed
during the working day. The workers’ performance can be
measured by the ratio of completed orders to the total number
of orders. While machines usually do not show performance
ﬂuctuations when being confronted with an immense workload
or time pressure, human workers are often susceptible to such
inﬂuences. Intrinsic processes of motivation and strain are
driving factors inﬂuencing their performance [2]. Still, human
beings are often only considered as workforces without indi-
vidual intrinsic needs during the planning and implementation
of work processes, even though their signiﬁcance and impor-
tance are well known, e.g., modeling of humans in Business
Process Model and Notation (BPMN). To achieve a more
adequate integration of humans into these processes as well as
increase performance and organizational outcome, individuals
and their intrinsic needs must be represented individually and
realistically within a computer system.
This paper aims at modeling human work performance
formation. Here, a special focus lies on representing the
intrinsic processes of strain and motivation. For modeling
workers, Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) and especially the
Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) architecture of practical reason-
ing [3] is proposed, as it has established in modeling of human
cognitive decision-making and behaviors [4]–[7]. Therefore, in
Section II, related work on the ﬁeld of modeling strain and
motivation in ABM is discussed. Furthermore, the ﬂexible Job
Demands-Resources model (JDR model) is introduced, which
is well-established in psychology and investigates factors in
the working environment that may lead to burn-out, especially
focusing on those factors causing a stressful situation and
mental effort for the worker [8]. Subsequently, an agent-
based model of work performance is introduced in Section III.
In Section IV, several experiments are conducted to analyze
the model’s adequacy to represent human work performance.
Finally, Section V provides a summary as well as an outlook
on future work.

BACKGROUND
There are several frameworks for modeling and optimizing
work processes, e.g., Enterprise Dynamics or Anylogic [9],
which focus strongly on the processes and functionalities
of machines. These frameworks often neglect to represent
human resources sufﬁciently, so that the ”human factor” can
not be considered properly when measuring the overall per-
formance. However, other areas, e.g., the representation of
social networks, lay emphasis on an adequate representation
of the human being. Here, agent-based models that utilize
sociological and psychological behavioral theories have been
established [10]–[12]. This paper introduces an agent-based
model of human work performance including the intrinsic
processes of strain and motivation, that in future work could
be used to represent workers in existing frameworks. In the

following, we discuss existing work on agent-based models
including stress and motivation formation and present the
psychological JDR model that serves as the basis for our
implementation.
In ABM, various approaches exist that include psycho-
logical strain in behavioral development. Silverman’s generic
agent architecture contains a working memory (BDI decision
logic) and four subsystems. An integrated strain value is
calculated as a function of the event strain, time pressure and
exhaustion, on the basis of which different coping strategies
are initiated [13]. Duggirala et al. apply this conceptual model
in an agent-based simulation of strain at work [14]. They
selected the variables task arrival volume, pending tasks,
and work hours to calculate the integrated strain value and
to determine the coping strategies. However, by choosing
work hours for exhaustion, they have missed Silverman’s
consideration of individual resources. Ashlock and Cage also
simulate strain at work using an agent-based model and a strain
factor consisting of individual strain tolerance and number of
stressors [15]. Nevertheless, strain is difﬁcult to quantify and
validate, especially using static mathematical formulas that are
limited to a number of variables. For this reason, Morris et al.
have investigated system dynamics of strain to model agents
by representing strain as causal loop diagram, and stock-ﬂow
diagram [16]. In the BDI extension BRIDGE, strain is similar
to Silverman’s approach part of the implicit behavior and
only inﬂuences the deﬁciency needs and overrules selected
intentions [17]. A broad ﬁeld of research is crowd simulation,
in whose models strain is also considered, (e.g., [18]). Strain
inﬂuences behavior generation mainly reactively, but this is due
to the frequent application context of emergency evacuations,
where deliberative behavior is less important.
However, most models include two aspects: Firstly, the
models focus on stimuli during the genesis of strain and sec-
ondly in doing so, they neglect the consideration of resources
that can signiﬁcantly reduce the amount of strain generated.
Such models do not recognize strain as the result of intrinsic
processes although psychology has already sufﬁciently shown
the degree to which cognitive processes occur regarding strain
for a long time (e.g., [19]).
In ABM regarding motivation as part of the decision-
making process models can be distinguished by the moti-
vations’ directionality, i.e., whether motivation is caused by
external factors or if it is merely generated intrinsically by
the individual. Maslow’s hierarchy of needs as an intrinsically
oriented motivation theory, e.g., is implemented by Spaiser
and Sumpter [20] as well as Silverman [13]. In these models,
the agent’s actions focus primarily on covering deﬁciency and
growth needs, and mostly neglect environmental inﬂuences
on motivation development. As already mentioned above, the
BRIDGE architecture also uses this theory to deﬁne an agent’s
goals and desires [17]. Using Vroom’s extrinsically oriented
expectation theory, the agent’s decision making is modeled
on the basis of its expected subjective value of a future
event in his environment [21], [22]. These models mainly rely
on subjectively perceived environmental factors and largely
neglect the mutual inﬂuence of intrinsic factors, e.g., between
perceived strain and motivation, although the relation between
these factors has already been recognised (see, e.g., [17]).
A well-known model that both considers stressors (stimuli),
resources, and the inﬂuence of motivation, is the JDR model
by Demerouti et al. [8]. The JDR model is an empirically
evaluated model, that has been used ﬂexibly in a variety of
scenarios, such as to predict job burn-out [23], organizational
commitment [24], connectedness [25], and work engagement
[26]. The model consists of two essential processes: a health
impairment process and a motivational process (see Figure 1).
The health impairment process is concerned with how job
demands affect individual strain. Job demands can be stressors
like workload, emotional demands, or organizational changes.
During the motivational process, job resources are main
predictors for motivation and engagement. Whereas job de-
mands consume energetic resources and in this way cause
strain, job resources fulﬁl basic psychological needs and there-
fore generate motivation. Thus, job demands and resources
initiate two different processes, but these processes are not
independent, because job resources can buffer the impact of job
demands on strain and job demands can reduce the generation
of motivation through job resources (see Figure 1). Due to
these moderation effects, there is also a direct relationship
between strain and motivation. By using the model, predictions
can be made about employee well-being, job-performance,
and respectively the aggregated performance of a company.
The model was extended several times by the authors, in
particular to include personal resources and job crafting, and
was maturated into a theory based on several meta-analyses
[2]. Nevertheless, this paper uses the original model to reduce
the complexity of the simulation signiﬁcantly and focus on the
prediction of job performance [28].

AN AGENT-BASED MODEL OF WORK PERFORMANCE
In this section, an agent-based model of human work
performance is introduced that coombines the BDI architecture
and the JDR model presented in Section II. The workers are
modeled based on the BDI architecture of practical reasoning
[3]. It organizes goals (desires), information about the envi-
ronment and the own conditions (beliefs), and action-oriented
measures (intentions) into mental states. To this end, we make
use of the JDR model presented in Section II. By utilizing both
models a strict modularization is made, which can be easily
extended and exchanged against further theories and models.
Figure 2 shows the basic concept of the agent-based model
of human work performance. Following the JDR model, the
agent’s environment consists of sets of JobDemands and
JobResources, that impact internal processes forming strain
(α) and motivation (β). These, in turn, determine the agent’s
action and thus the organizational outcomes (here: equal to
individual performance).
Referring to the factory example introduced in Section I,
the agent is confronted with a set of Orders, that are composed
of the two sets UnﬁnishedOrders and FinishedOrders (Equa-
tion 1). Initially, |Orders| is equal to |UnﬁnishedOrders|. If

an order i ∈ UnﬁnishedOrders is completed, it is deleted
from this set and added to FinishedOrders. Each of the orders
has a certain difﬁculty diﬀi ∈ N, which is deﬁned within a
range of set difﬁculties. The difﬁculty of an order expresses
how much time is required to execute the order. Because job
demands represent stressors as workload (see Section II) the
variable diﬃculties is introduced, which represents the agent’s
workload on one working dayand is composed of the sum of
difﬁculties diﬀi for each i ∈ UnﬁnishedOrders (Equation 2).
Orders = FinishedOrders

One working day is deﬁned by a number of time steps
totalTime ∈ N, whereas the running variable t ∈ N represents
the current time that has already elapsed. At each time step,
the remainingTime to complete all UnﬁnishedOrders is
computed (Equation 3). The difﬁculty level corresponds to the
minimum number of time units required to process an order
and depends on the agent’s skillRank ∈ N, thus its work-
related know-how. A lower value of skillRank means, that
less time units are needed to complete one difﬁculty level.
The skillRank together with the overall remainingTime to
complete all orders form the agent’s set of JobResources.
remainingTime = totalTime − t
(3)
Considering the JDR model, job demands initate a health im-
pairment process that affects the agent’s individual strain. Job
resources on the other hand, have a moderating effect on strain
and buffer the impact of the job demands. Therefore, strain
(Figure 2, Function α) represents the experienced pressure as
the ratio between the unﬁnished orders diﬃculties and the
remainingTime to complete them (Equation 4). Motivation
is formed in a process that is mainly inﬂuenced by job
resources. Here, job demands reduce the generation of this
variable. Hence, motivation (Figure 2, Function β) implies
the capabilities of the agent and represents whether the agent
is able to perform the open orders in the given time based on its
own skillRank at time t (see Equation 5). If the motivation
value is high, the agent is conﬁdent to complete the whole
set of unﬁnished orders in the remaining time. Strain and
motivation represent the agent’s set of IntrinsicStates. Both
values are normalized to [0, 1] relative to the minimal and
maximal possible values of the variables.

Following the example introduced in Section I, performance
is measured using the ratio of FinishedOrders to the overall
number of Orders (Equation 6).
performance = |FinishedOrders|
|Orders|
(6)
The algorithm in Figure 2 shows the BDI control cycle,
that determines the agent’s behavior formation process. First,
the internal states, as well as a variable determining the next
action to perform are initally set (lines 1-4). Based on the
general BDI architecture, the agent’s behavior in our model
is formed by passing various phases that consider and build
the mental states. These can be divided into react, decide, and
execute (see [29]). In react (belief-revision-function (brf)), the
agent processes perceived information and updates its beliefs
(B) about the current situation and intrinsic states. In decide,
based on the updated beliefs and the agent’s desires (D), the
agent updates its intentions (I). Considering these, an action
to perform next is chosen, before it is carried out in execute.
The agent’s beliefs B are composed of the three sets
JobDemands, JobResources, and IntrinsicStates (see Equa-
tion 7). Based on the beliefs B that are generated and updated
in react, the agent decides for an unﬁnished order to proceed
with next, to reach its sole desire (completing all orders).
B = JobDemands

⇒ B = {diﬃculties, remainingTime, skillRank,
strain, motivation}
(7)
In the decide phase, best choices for both values of
strain and motivation are deﬁned. Hereby, a mapping of
UnﬁnishedOrders’ difﬁculties diﬀi to the respective values
takes place, whereas a high motivation value leads to a choice
of a high difﬁculty. A high value of strain generates a low
difﬁculty as the best possible choice. These best choices serve
as boundaries to decide for the intention I to commit to,
which is done on a random basis (see Figure 2, Function
γ). Consequently, decide is only processed if the current
order has been completed in the preceding time step. The

chosen difﬁculty (I) is used to pick the next order (action)
to complete, which is then performed in execute. Starting
from the initial value the skillRank adapts in dependence to
the values of motivation and strain (decrease or increase
of value) and to the current order’s difﬁculty (strength of
decrease or increase of value) (Figure 2, Function δ). After
each time step t, the performance is used to update the orders’
difﬁculties.

SIMULATING WORK PERFORMANCE: EXPERIMENTS
AND RESULTS
In this section, the agent-based model of work performance
is evaluated based on a case study. Therefore, ﬁrst the sim-
ulation setup is deﬁned and the model input variables are
speciﬁed. Subsequently, the ﬁndings are presented and the
assumptions derived from these are discussed.
A. Simulation Setup
In order to simulate human work performance, the variables
introduced in Section III are speciﬁed. The number of orders
|Orders| is set to 20 and one agent is simulated at a time.
Because it is theorized that the workers abilities do not vanish
completely due to an immense workload, the skillRank cannot
exceed a maximum of 10. Equally, the skills of an agent
can not decrease inﬁnitely and the maximum decrease of the
skillRank is to 1, so that at least one time unit is needed to
complete one difﬁculty level of an order. Each ten time units,
the values of strain, motivation, and skillRank are updated.
To test the impacts of input variables on performance, 27
scenarios are deﬁned and the output behavior of the model is
analyzed (see Figure 3). Each scenario is deﬁned by an element
of the cartesian product of timeCapacity, diﬃcultyRange,
and skillRank (see Table I). The agent’s inital skillRank is
varied between a minimal (1), medium (5), and maximum
value (10). The orders’ diﬃcultyRange encompasses the range
1-5 (complete difﬁculty range), 1-3 (low difﬁculty), and 3-5
(high difﬁculty).

TimeCapacity is deﬁned by a small, suitable, and
high timeCapacity and depicts the time available to perform
the set of Orders. The three values of small (405) and
high timeCapacity (135) to complete the orders center around
a suitable amount of time units (270). The reference value
of 270 time units arises from the time an agent persistently
having a skillRank of 5 would need to complete all orders
with difﬁculty range from 1-5. Because the model makes use
of random number generators, it is repeated 30 times to neglect
possible effects.
B. Simulation Results and Discussion
The diagrams of Figure 3 show the experimental results
seperated by the variation of timeCapacity. The x-axis depicts
the initial input value of the variable skillRank. The y-axis
shows the performance of the agent, thus, the ratio of ﬁnished
orders compared to the overall number of orders. The boxplots’
colors represent the orders’ diﬃcultyRange, darkgrey repre-
sents a range of 1-3, lightgrey for 1-5, and white for a range
of 3-5. In the following, three main observations regarding the
work performance are discussed.
First, the results show that with increasing timeCapacity,
the agent is able to ﬁnish all or a majority of orders. Where
small timeCapacity shows a minimum performance value
of 0.2, this value increases to 0.55 in high timeCapacity,
so that even an agent with a skillRank of 10 is capable of
completing half of the orders. Theoretically, an agent with
skillRank of 1 should be able to complete the whole set
of orders even in the small timeCapacity scenarios. Never-
theless, this mainly occurs in a high timeCapacity scenario.
The simulation output does not reveal the difﬁculties of the
ﬁnished orders. Agents with a small skillRank tend to choose
orders with a high difﬁculty due to a high motivation value.
Thus, the agent may ﬁnish these high difﬁculty orders but
has a worse performance due to an overall smaller number of
ﬁnished orders. Agents with a skillRank of 10, on the other
hand, tend to start with low difﬁculty orders which is why the
number of ﬁnished orders differs less than expected from that
of the remaining skillRanks. With increasing time capacity the
choosing behavior becomes less important, because the agent
still has enough time left to ﬁnish the remaining orders of
small difﬁculty.

The second trend observed is the inﬂuence of the
diﬃcultyRange of orders on performance. The results indicate
that a range of 3-5 leads to the worst performance. Thus,
the performance mean throughout the simulation runs is 0.52,
whereas ranges 1-3 and 1-5 lead to mean values of 0.69
and 0.63. Transferred to working life, a constant execution
of difﬁcult orders that afford a high level of exertion and
concentration may lead to a low performance due to a heavy
11

strain load. A balanced order compilation is more purposeful
as it, on the one hand, demands the worker enough to keep
his interest, and on the other hand, allows for phases of lower
concentration while completing orders of a low difﬁculty level
[30].
Nevertheless, there are exceptions to this observation, as
it can be observed in small timeCapacity with skillRank
of 1 and 5 as well as in the suitable time capacity sce-
nario with skillRanks 5 and 10. A ﬁrst exception is a
worse performance for order difﬁculty range 1-5 than for 3-5
(small timeCapacity and skillRank = 1). This can be traced
back to the fact that the agent starts the simulation with a low
level of strain as well as a high motivation value, due to the
wider range of 1-5 and thus a smaller value of diﬃculties.
In contrast, a second exception intimates a worse perfor-
mance for range 1-3 than for 1-5 (small timeCapacity and
skillRank = 5; suitable timeCapacity and skillRank = 5 or
10). The agents in these scenarios start with a relatively low
motivation due to the comparably high value of skillRank.
However, the diﬃculties absolutely deﬁne which order is
chosen ﬁrst. Therefore, in both exceptions, the agent chooses
high difﬁculties ﬁrst which, caused by the progressing time,
leads to increasing strain and decreasing motivation and
ultimately to less ﬁnished orders. The range of order difﬁculties
should thus be adapted to the available time as well as the
agent’s skills in order to reach the best results.
A third tendency refers to the inﬂuence of the input
skillRank on performance. In contrary to the remaining values,
a skillRank of 10 tends to lead to extreme performance values
without any outliers. Especially concering diﬃcultyRange
3-5, the agent is not capable of completing more than 20%
of the existing orders. This is due to a low motivation value
resulting from the high skillRank as well as the restriction
of the model to generate a higher skillRank than 10. With
decreasing remainingTime, the strain value increases and the
skillRank is not allowed to improve. This covers ﬁndings in
psychology that investigate the connection between high strain
at the workplace to burn-out and thus a low job performance
[31].

Figure 4. Performance depending on motivation and strain.
The diagrams in Figure 4 depict the impact of the values
of motivation and strain (x-axis) on the agent’s performance
(y-axis). The data points represent the mean value of the
variables motivation and strain throughout one simulation
run (x-axis), whereas performance refers to the status at the
end of a simulation run (y-axis). The diagrams undermine the
aforementioned tendecies. With increasing mean motivation
throughout the simulation runs, the agent’s performance in-
creases almost lineary. Each scenario with a mean motivation
value of 1.0 leads to a perfect performance, whereas a value
<= 0.25 results in a mean performance of 0.42 and a best
value of 0.75. The agent’s strain value shows a u-shaped
impact on performance. A low strain level (<= 0.25) leads
to a high performance mean of 0.99. Subsequently, the curve
drops to a minimal mean performance of 0.2 at a strain level
of 0.84, before it starts to increase again to a mean value of
0.86 at a strain level of 0.98. The upswing of the curve at
higher strain values is rather unexpected, since there is a linear
calculation of the variable. Once again, the diagram does not
show us the difﬁculties of unﬁnished orders, but the proportion
of ﬁnished orders in comparison to all orders. Hence, if the
agent is heavily strained during the entire simulation run, its
skillRank probably rises fast to the highest possible value and
remains there for the rest of the run. This causes the agent
to favor low difﬁculty orders, which increases the value of
motivation and performance.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, an agent-based model of human work per-
formance was presented that makes use of the JDR model. A
decision-behavior based on the general BDI architecture was
introduced and adapted to the processes deﬁned in the JDR
model including a representation of strain and motivation as
well as the mutual inﬂuences of job resources, job demands,
and intrinsic mental states. Within several experiments, the
impacts of the input variables timeCapacity, skillRank, and
diﬃcultyRange on the overall performance of the agents were
analyzed. The experimental results revealed that the model is
capable of producing realistic working performance including
intrinsic processes of strain and motivation. However, the
model lacks reliable empirical studies to validate the model
and the underlying relationships.
In future work, we plan on conducting empirical experi-
ments with workers in a controlled working environment (see,
e.g., [32]). During these experiments, we aim at identifying
stressors and resources and measure individual reactions like
strain, especially by biosignals. Furthermore, we need to
improve the existing model in several respects. As mentioned
in Sec. IV-A, a skillRank of 10 leads to performance measures
that indicate burn-out developing processes. In order to inves-
tigate at which point the agent is no longer able to perform,
further experiments with more detailed parameter steps have
to be executed. Hereby, possible intervention strategies to
countermeasure this development could be tested. The model
shows the best results for orders within difﬁculty range 1-3.
As has been discussed in Sec. IV-A, a varied order difﬁculty
should lead to best performances, due to a balanced ratio of
exertion and relaxation. In order to receive a more realistic
representation, the effects of missing challenges could be
included. A difﬁculty range of 1-3 would thus theoretically
lead to a worse performance than a range of 1-5. The agents’

performance should be measured by showing how much of the
workload has been completed. Thus, not only the proportion of
ﬁnished orders, but the difﬁculties of the ﬁnished orders should
be taken into account, too. Furthermore, working in teams
should be included in the model. This could result in better
organizational outcomes, as by the interaction, poor perfor-
mances of some members may be offset by good performances
of others.
