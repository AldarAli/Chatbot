Abstract—Millimeter wave (mmW) links are an attractive solution
for backhaul of mobile networks. In order to cope with the
requirements of future networks, these mmW links should achieve
Gigabit data rates. These data rates can be achieved using
wide-band and high order modulations in E-Band. Zero-IF
architectures are good candidates for integrated transceivers.
However, the design of integrated transceivers at these frequencies
is a challenging issue. An important source of degradation is I/Q
imbalance, which can signiﬁcantly reduce the performance of
a communication system with zero-IF transceivers if it is not
appropriately compensated. In this paper, the impact of the I/Q
imbalance impairment on the transmitted and received signal
is analyzed and suitable digital signal processing techniques are
evaluated for I/Q imbalance compensation at the receiver for a
64-QAM system using 2GHz bandwidth.

INTRODUCTION
The growing demand for ubiquitous broadband commu-
nication, e.g., fourth-generation (4G) wireless, has motivated
the deployment of ultra high-speed communication systems.
Especially in backhauling networks, optical ﬁber is required to
transport very high data rates. However, optical ﬁber exhibits
important drawbacks, such as high costs, long deployment
times, and low ﬂexibility. Recently, point-to-point wireless
communication systems have been proposed as an attractive
alternative to optical ﬁber. In order to achieve comparable data
rates as the optical ﬁber, these communication systems demand
a very high bandwidth to transport enough data. Although
the frequency spectrum is congested, the regulation of the E-
band facilitates the deployment of high-speed communication
systems. The European Telecommunications Standards Insti-
tute (ETSI) is carrying out a standardization process for this
frequency band [1][2].
Commercial off-the-shelf communication systems operat-
ing in the E-band support data rates up to 2.5 Gbit/s. However,
new applications demand even higher data rates, which neces-
sitate both wide-band and high-order modulations to utilize the
spectrum efﬁciently. Higher order modulations require high
Carrier-to-Interference (C/I) ratios at the receiver involving
careful analysis of the degradation effects introduced by the
analog Radio-Frequency (RF) impairments and evaluation of
corresponding compensation algorithms in the digital baseband
processing [3].
In this paper, we focus on the I/Q imbalance impairment
caused by the local oscillators used for quadrature modula-
tion and demodulation in zero-IF transceivers. In an ideal
quadrature modulator or demodulator, the mirror images are
completely suppressed. I/Q imbalance entails a degradation
in the Image Rejection Ratio (IRR) and causes interfering
images at mirror frequencies [4]. The paper analyzes the
impact of these local oscillator imbalances in the transmitted
and received signal. Building upon the results of this analysis,
an approach to compensate for both transmitter and receiver
induced I/Q imbalance by digital signal processing techniques
is selected and its performance for a 64-QAM transceiver
operating with a signal bandwidth of 2GHz is evaluated.
Section II introduces the I/Q imbalance issue identifying
and modeling the source of this impairment. The mitigation
of the I/Q imbalance impairment by digital signal processing
at the receiver is described in Section III. In Section IV,
the selected mechanism to cope with the I/Q imbalance is
simulated and analyzed. Finally, some conclusions are drawn
in Section V.

SYSTEM ANALYSIS
A. Transceiver architecture
In order to address new applications for the future back-
hauling networks, a point-to-point microwave link in the E-
Band using a 64-QAM modulation with a signal bandwidth of
2GHz is considered. Figure 1 shows the proposed transceiver
(TRx) architecture for a point-to-point microwave link in the
E-Band. As shown, the transmitter (Tx) front-end consists of
an I/Q up-converting modulator that up-converts the baseband
I and Q channels to an Intermediate Frequency (IF). After
combining the I and Q channels, the IF signal is up-converted
by means of the millimeter-wave (mmW) mixer. The receiver
(Rx) front-end consists of a wideband Low Noise Ampliﬁer
(LNA), which receives and ampliﬁes the signal at the E-Band.
After the LNA, a ﬁrst mixer down-converts the mmW signal
to the same IF as in the Tx. This way, the same PLL can be
re-used for the Tx and the Rx. Finally, an I/Q demodulator
down-converts the IF signal to 0-Hz.
This architecture presents a good balance between different
design aspects and enables to minimize the sampling frequency
of the Digital-to-Analog (DAC) and Analog-to-Digital (ADC)
Converters. Nowadays, we can ﬁnd commercial DACs and

ADCs able to provide sampling rates close to 3Gsps, which
is enough for practical implementation of the zero-IF archi-
tecture. The use of other architectures such as low-IF would
require very high performance DACs or ADCs, with sampling
rates well above 4Gsps to achieve a practical implementation
of base-band and image rejection ﬁlters in the analog front-
end.
However, this zero-IF architecture is subject to the cor-
ruption due to I/Q imbalances at the transmitter and receiver
quadrature modulator and demodulator respectively. The re-
sulting system performance degradation can be important,
specially for high-order modulation schemes [5].
B. I/Q Imbalance Analysis
The goal of the I/Q modulator in Figure 1 is to perform
a frequency translation of the signal. That is, if the base-band
input signal to the I/Q modulator is
˜s(t) = sI(t) + jsQ(t),
(1)
where sI(t) is the signal in the I-datapath and sQ(t) is the
signal in the Q-datapath, a perfect I/Q modulation mixes the
base-band input signal with
ltx(t) = ejωtxt = cos(ωtxt) + j sin(ωtxt)
(2)
producing an output signal
s(t) = Re [˜s(t)ltx(t)] = sI(t) cos(ωtxt) − sQ(t) sin(ωtxt).
(3)
However, when implementing an I/Q modulator with actual
electronic circuits, the signals produced by the Local Oscillator
(LO) will present some difference in their amplitudes and will
not have a phase difference of π/2. The effect of this imbalance
can be modeled as the mixing of the base-band input signal
with
ltx(t) = cos(ωtxt) + jgtx sin(ωtxt + φtx)
(4)
to yield the output signal
s(t) = (sI(t) − gtx sin(φtx)sQ(t)) cos(ωtxt)
(5a)
− sQ(t)gtx cos(φtx) sin(ωtxt).

Spectrum of s(t) with imbalance.
In I/Q imbalance analysis, it is common to rewrite the signal
produced at the transmitter LO with imbalance of (4) in the
form [6]
ltx(t) = C1ejωtxt + C2e−jωtxt,
(6)
with
C1 = 1 + gtxejφtx

C2 = 1 − gtxe−jφtx

(7b)
and the transmitted signal is
s(t) = Re

˜s(t)

C1ejωtxt + C2e−jωtxt
.
(8)
In (8), the desired term is the one multiplied by ejωtxt and the
term multiplied by e−jωtxt is considered an undesired image.
Working on (8) we can rewrite it as
s(t) = 1

,
(9b)
where (·)∗ denotes the complex conjugate.
Let X(ω) denote the Fourier Transform of a signal x(t),
then from (9) we have
S(ω) = 1


C1 ˜S(ω − ωtx) + C∗
1 ˜S∗(ω + ωtx)
(10a)
+ C∗
2 ˜S∗(ω − ωtx) + C2 ˜S(ω + ωtx)

(10b)
Figure 2 illustrates the spectrum of s(t). The ﬁrst line in
the above equation is the desired term and the second line
is an image that aliases on the desired signal. A measure of
performance of the I/Q modulator is the Image Rejection Ratio
(IRR)
IRRtx = |C1|2
|C2|2 = 1 + g2
tx + 2gtx cos(φtx)
1 + g2
tx − 2gtx cos(φtx).
(11)
Similarly, the task of the Rx I/Q demodulator in Figure 1
is to mix the input signal with
lrx(t) = e−jωrxt = cos(ωrxt) − j sin(ωrxt),
(12)
so that after low-pass ﬁltering, we get the base-band equivalent
of the signal in the frequency band of interest ˜z(t) = zI(t) +
jzQ(t). Note that ˜z(t) is the base-band equivalent referred to
a carrier frequency ωrx. The actual implementation of the I/Q

demodulator will introduce similar imbalances to the actual
implementation of the I/Q modulator, which can be modeled
as the mixing of r(t) with
lrx(t) = cos(ωrxt) − jgrx sin(ωrxt + φrx).
(13)
The signal at the output of the I/Q demodulator after low-pass
ﬁltering can be written as [6]
˜r(t) = rI(t) + jrQ(t) = K1˜z(t) + K2˜z∗(t)
(14)
with
K1 = 1 + grxe−jφrx
2
(15a)
K2 = 1 − grxejφrx
2
.
(15b)
In this case, the ﬁrst term in the sum of (14) is the desired
term and the second one is the image that aliases on the desired
signal. The IRR for the I/Q demodulator is deﬁned as
IRRrx = |K1|2
|K2|2 = 1 + g2
rx + 2grx cos(φtx)
1 + g2rx − 2grx cos(φrx).
(16)
Note that the above model for the impairment affects in the
same way to the whole information bearing signal. Thus, the
I/Q imbalance is said to be Non-Frequency-Selective (NFS).
Other imbalances in the in-phase and quadrature datapaths
of the information bearing signals can introduce Frequency-
Selective (FS) I/Q imbalance. In this paper, we restrict our
attention to the NFS component of the I/Q imbalance. Al-
though the model has been developed from the point of view
of the local oscillators of the I/Q modulator and demodulator,
it can also be used to include the mean imbalances between
the in-phase and quadrature datapaths.
In order to gain some insight, we assume enough linearity
and proper ﬁltering in the remaining stages of the transmitter
and receiver analog chain and noise-less operation. Using (9),
it can be seen that
˜z(t) = (C1˜s(t) + C∗
2 ˜s∗(t)) ej(Δωt+θ)
(17)
where Δω and θ account for the overall carrier frequency and
phase offset between the transmitter and the receiver. Thus, we
have
˜r(t) = K1C1˜s(t)ej(Δωt+θ)
(18a)
+ K1C∗
2 ˜s∗(t)ej(Δωt+θ)
(18b)
+ K2C∗
1 ˜s∗(t)e−j(Δωt+θ)
(18c)
+ K2C2˜s(t)e−j(Δωt+θ)
(18d)
The desired term in (18) is the one in the ﬁrst line and the
terms in the second to fourth line represent undesired images
at the receiver due to transmitter and receiver I/Q imbalances.
When Δω = 0 , (18) simpliﬂies to
˜r(t) = J1˜s(t) + J2˜s∗(t)
(19)
where J1 and J2 are constants given by
J1 = K1C1ejθ + K2C2e−jθ
(20a)
J2 = K1C∗
2ejθ + K2C∗
1e−jθ.
(20b)
Comparing (19) with (14), it can be concluded that when
Δω = 0, the effect observed at the output of the receiver’s
I/Q demodulator due to the I/Q imbalance introduced at the
transmitter is the same as the one due to an I/Q imbalance
introduced by the I/Q demodulator. In a real transmission
system there will be some carrier frequency offset between the
transmitter and the receiver. However, the former observation
suggests that the I/Q imbalance introduced at the transmitter
may be addressed after carrier frequency recovery using ap-
proaches designed to address the I/Q imbalance introduced at
the receiver.

I/Q IMBALANCE COMPENSATION
A. Tx I/Q Imbalance Compensation
Using (1) and (3) with ˜s′(t) = s′
I(t) + js′
Q(t) denoting
the equivalent baseband signal of the Tx I/Q distorted signal
s(t) with respect to the transmitter carrier frequency ωtx, we
can derive the following matrix equation for Tx I/Q imbalance
distortion:s′
I(t)

−gtx sin(φtx)

.
(21)
If the matrix in (21) is invertible (gtx ̸= 0 and φtx ̸=
±π/2), what is the case for practical cases, the Tx NFS I/Q
compensation can ideally be achieved by performing a digital
predistortion based on the inverse operation. In this case, we
feed the I/Q modulator with the predistorted signal ς(t) =
ςI(t) + jςQ(t), which is obtained as

ςI(t)
ςQ(t)



tan(φtx)

1/(gtx cos(φtx))
	 

sQ(t)
	
,
(22)
Compensation by inverse transformation requires knowledge
of the gain and phase imbalance values, gtx and φrx.
Techniques for compensation of the transmitter I/Q imbal-
ance at the transmitter have been proposed in the literature
using tones as test signals (e.g., [7][8][9][10]) or even from
random data (e.g., [8][11]). The compensation using test tones
is very powerful and can be used for initial calibration. During
normal full-duplex operation of the transceiver, I/Q imbalance
compensation from the random transmitted data would be pre-
ferred. All these techniques of compensation require additional
circuitry (including an extra ADC) at the transmitter to feed-
back measurements performed in the analog front-end.
Under certain conditions Tx I/Q imbalance can also be
compensated in the receiver [6]. For this to be possible, an
important issue is that the spectral images caused by Tx I/Q
imbalance have to be emitted. This condition is fulﬁlled in
the analyzed system. Receiver-based compensation of Tx I/Q
imbalance is the approach further investigated in this paper,
because it does not require any additional circuitry in the
analog front-end of the transceiver and all the compensation
can be performed by digital signal processing.
B. Rx I/Q Imbalance Compensation
The down-coverted complex-valued base-band signal ˜r(t)
can be written as a function of ˜z(t) using the following matrix
equation

In case the matrix in (23) is invertible (grx ̸= 0 and

where α(t) = αI(t) + jαQ(t) is the output of the Rx I/Q
imbalance compensator and ideally would yield the desired
baseband signal ˜z(t). Compensation by inverse transformation
requires knowledge of the gain and phase imbalance values
grx and φrx, which can be derived by using statistics and
correlation properties of the I and Q signals as proposed in
[12].

SIMULATION RESULTS
A. System Model
Figure 3 depicts the simulation model developed in Matlab
for the analysis of the I/Q imbalance in the transceiver perfor-
mance. Random data information is generated as a sequence
of I/Q symbols, D, by using a 64-QAM mapper. D is then
ﬁltered through an appropriate Root-Raised-Cosine (RRC)
ﬁlter to create a pulse-shaped base-band signal x. The Tx
Baseband Filtering and Mixing models the data processing in
the transmitter analog front-end shown in Figure 1, including
the NFS-I/Q imbalance at the I/Q modulator.
Considering an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN)
channel, the signal ˜z at the output of the channel model is
given by:
˜z(t) = ˜s′(t) · ej2πft + n(t),
(25)
where ˜z(t) is the low-pass equivalent of the transmitted signal,
with f the Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) in Hz. Finally,
n(t) corresponds to a complex-valued white Gaussian noise
process.
On the receiver side, the Rx Baseband Filtering and Mixing
models the receiver analog front-end structure shown in Fig-
ure 1 including Rx I/Q imbalance. NFS I/Q Imbalance Com-
pensation is performed prior to matched ﬁltering following a
multi-stage approach that compensates for both Tx and Rx I/Q

1) The ﬁrst stage compensates for the Rx NFS I/Q imbalance
based on the algorithms in Section III.
2) A CFO correction stage compensates for the CFO.
3) A third stage is employed for performing Tx NFS I/Q
imbalance compensation prior to the matched ﬁlter by
applying again the algorithms in Section III .
The NFS I/Q compensated signal, β′, is then ﬁltered with
a matched RRC ﬁlter in order to recover the transmitted
information. Due to the high bandwidth of the signal and
limited sampling rates of the DACs and ADCs, there is a
frequency selectivity in the analog chain of the system. So as to
compensate for this frequency response, an equalizer modelled
as a Wiener ﬁlter [13] has been included at the receiver. The
received symbols D′ are then compared with the transmitted
symbols D to quantify the performance of the whole system.
B. Results

For illustration purpose, a noiseless transmission is considered.

sion takes places, and the dots correspond to a transmission
with I/Q imbalances both at transmitter and receiver assuming
zero carrier frequency offset. The I/Q imbalances considered
were 0.5 dB and 3 degrees in gain and phase, respectively, in
the transmitter and 1 dB and 3 degrees in gain and phase,
respectively, in the receiver. The signs of the imbalances

were selected in the transmitter and the receiver so that
they combine in the worst possible distortion. Figure 4(b)
shows the constellation at the receiver when the NFS I/Q
imbalance compensation is active. As it can be seen, the NFS
I/Q imbalance compensation approach is able to remove the
distortion of the constellation.
Figure 5 shows the impact of the NFS I/Q imbalance in
the performance of the transceiver. The curve labeled ‘without
NFS IQ’ is the performance of the transceiver when there is
no I/Q imbalance. As it is shown in the ﬁgure the equalizer
used to compensate the frequency selectivity of the analog
chain introduces minor losses. The curve labeled ‘NFS IQ’ is
the performance of the transceiver with I/Q imbalance at both
transmitter and receiver. The curve labeled ‘NFS IQ with comp’
is the performance when the I/Q imbalance compensation is
active. The NFS I/Q imbalance compesation is able to reduce
the losses to a few tenths of a dB.
Figure 6(a) illustrates the effect of NFS I/Q imbalance
when there is a residual carrier frequency offset equal to
Δω = 2π · 5 · 10−6/T after the CFO correction in Figure 3,
with T the symbol period. For proper symbol detection and
BER estimation, the residual carrier frequency offset has been
compensated in the simulations at the input of the receiver’s
matched-ﬁlter. The ﬁgure shows the corrected constellations

The transmitter’s I/Q imbalance manifests itself as rotations of
the constellation around the distorted constellation due to the
receiver’s I/Q imbalance.
Figure 6(b) shows the constellation when the I/Q com-
pensation algorithms are active for the same residual carrier
frequency offset. It can be seen that a reduction in the distortion
of the constellation has been achieved despite some residual
carrier frequency offset.
Figure 7 shows the impact of residual carrier frequency
offset on the performance of the NFS I/Q imbalance compen-
sation approach presented in Section III. The different curves
correspond to different values of the normalized residual
carrier frequency offset ΔωT/(2π). It can be seen that a
very accurate carrier frequency offset correction is needed for
proper compensation of the transmitter I/Q imbalance with
residual CFO below ΔωT/(2π) = 5 · 10−6, what can be
achieved via application of state of the art coarse and ﬁne
frequency synchronization algorithms [14].

CONCLUSION
In this paper, a theoretical analysis of the NFS I/Q imbal-
ance in a zero-IF transceiver has been presented. Digital signal
processing at the receiver has been evaluated based on a multi-
stage approach for the compensation of both transmitter and
receiver I/Q imbalance, as well as carrier frequency offset.
Simulation results were presented for a zero-IF transceiver
using 64-QAM with a signal bandwidth of 2GHz. The sim-
ulation results show that receiver-based Tx I/Q imbalance
compensation can be achieved with negligible degradation in
overall system performance. This is achieved when accurate
frequency synchronization is performed in the receiver that
reduces the residual carrier frequency offset below speciﬁed
limits.
