Abstract—This paper deals with localization in wireless cellular 
networks. We performed measurement of the received signal 
strength in and around Brno city and stored the collected data. 
The localization approach uses multislope channel models to 
estimates the propagation distance from the signal strength. 
Results are processed by two localization techniques. The first 
one is geometrically based with a triangular constellation of 
BSs. The second one is independent on the number of 
connected BSs, however more linked BSs with a triangular 
constellation 
refine 
the 
localization 
precision. 
This 
technique uses an optimization algorithm and proves to be 
universal and more accurate.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Wireless mobile communication networks are widely 
spread all around the world and new sites are built 
contemporary. This brings new opportunities for localization. 
Many techniques were developed for positioning in wireless 
networks [1][2][10][11][12][13]. In addition, the dedicated 
wireless satellite networks like GPS, GLONASS or 
GALILEO provide localization and navigation services [2]. 
The motivation of this work is to investigate localization 
capabilities of an optimization approach in wireless 
networks. We have measured parameters of GPS and GSM 
networks in an urban environment of Brno city. With the 
combined GPS/GSM module XT65 [3] we have collected 
localization data (latitude, longitude, received signal 
strength, timing advance, cell identity, signal frequency) and 
processed them in Matlab.  
The measurement of the received signal level in the GSM 
network is influenced by individual propagation conditions. 
Therefore, the positioning is ambiguous and additional 
processing is required to increase precision. We applied the 
adaptable multislope propagation channel model on the 
measured values of the signal level to estimate the 
propagation distance. Next, to determine the final position 
we propose two localization algorithms. The first one is 
geometric-based and it is strongly dependent on a network 
constellation. The second one uses an optimization approach 
with a mean square error (MSE) estimation to find the 
Mobile Station (MS) position in two-dimensional space. 
At the beginning of this paper is a theoretical description 
of localization principles in dedicated wireless networks 
(GPS, GSM). Next, the experimental measurement is 
introduced. An optimization multislope channel modeling 
technique is presented [9] to estimate a propagation distance. 
Next, two localization techniques are described and tested. 
Results are compared with other techniques described in 
[11][12]. In conclusion, the results are summarized and 
further improvements are proposed.  
II. 
GPS LOCALIZATION  
GPS uses the physical model of the Earth called 
WGS 84 [2]. The localization applied in GPS uses a precise 
time synchronization, and the GPS receiver measures 
the Time of Arrival (TOA) [2]. The satellite signals should 
be received from at least four satellites to achieve sufficient 
accuracy. Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) 
could provide additional corrections in a receiver. Its 
accuracy depends on the constellation and the number of 
visible satellites. With the SBAS [3] is the XT65’s Circular 
Error Probable (CEP) 2 m and Spherical Error Probable 
(SEP) 3 m [3]. 
III. 
GSM LOCALIZATION 
GSM is the wireless network with a cellular architecture 
(Figure 1). 
There 
are 
many 
techniques 
developed 
for localization [1]. However, the precise position data of 
BSs (Base Stations) are mandatory for all of them. 
A. Network Based Localization 
The GSM network was not designed for localization, thus 
this approach requires additional hardware enhancements in 
network architecture. The Location Measurement Unit 
(LMU) needs to be involved to perform time based 
measurements and computation. With the LMU unit the 
network is capable of using localization techniques TDOA 
(Time Difference of Arrival), OTD (Observed Time 
Difference), 
E-OTD 
(Enhanced-OTD). 
Additional 
capabilities for localization provide the combination with 
GPS receiver denoted as A-GPS (Assisted-GPS) and also the 
measurement of AOA (Angle of Arrival). We focus this 
work on the processing of the received signal strength 
information by the MS as the part of service communication.

Figure 2.  Localization approach based on the measured signal strength
B. Cell Identity Technique 
The Cell Identity (CI) code uniquely identifies each 
sector in the network as illustrated in Figure 1. The 
Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH) [1] carries the CI code 
expressed in hexadecimal format as part of the common 
service communication.  
With 
the database 
of 
identification 
and 
position 
information of BSs it is possible to track the MS moving in 
the network according to the actual CI value i.e., trace 
connected sectors of BSs. Other codes used for the 
identification of the MS in the network: Location Area Code 
(LAC), Mobile Network Code (MNC), Mobile Country 
Code (MCC) [1]. 
C. Timing Advance Technique 
The Timing Advance (TA) information transmitted 
in the BCCH corresponds with a propagation delay of a 
transmitted signal. The TA interval in the GSM network 
served to avoid an overlapping of the bursts transmitted by 
different users to a single BS. The TA is expressed as a 
natural number from 0 to 63. Each value determines the 
distance from the BS up to 34 km with a 550 m width 
step [1].  
D. Received Signal Level Technique 
The Received Signal Level (RxLev) represents the power 
of the BCCH received by the MS from a network [3]. The 
RxLev value depends on length and conditions of a 
propagation channel. The free space path loss formula (1) 
[10] is

where d is the propagation distance in [m], f is the signal 
frequency in [Hz], c is the speed of light (3·108 m/s). 
Figure 2 describes the basic principle of triangulation 
technique used for the MS position estimation. Character of 
a propagation environment influences path losses, therefore 
using the feasible propagation model is mandatory.  
IV. 
MEASUREMENT 
We designed the Structured Query Language (SQL) 
database containing position data and identification of BSs 
(latitude, longitude, CI, LAC, MNC and MCC). Next, we 
performed measurement in the real network in Brno city with 
the combined GSM/GPS module [3]. Measured BSs 
transmitted in the 900 MHz GSM frequency band [1]. 
Collected service information and position data were sent via 
GPRS data service on the http server. Next, the PHP script 
running on this server stored and processed incoming data 
in to the SQL database. Incoming data were CI, LAC, MNC, 
MCC, TA, RxLev, Absolute Radio Frequency Channel 
Number (ARFCN)) for each connected BS, and GPS latitude 
and longitude for each measuring point. Next, we determined 
the propagation distance for every connected BS. The path 
losses depend on a propagation distance and is modeled by 
propagation models [1][4][5][6]. Figure 3 shows path loss 
measurement. 
Based on the measured parameters of the network, two 
localization techniques were developed and simulation 
results were compared.  
V. 
CHANNEL MODELLING 
Channel modeling is a complex process influenced by 
individual propagation conditions. We have modeled path 
losses by some widely used path loss models (COST 231 [4], 
ECC 131 [6], WINNER II [5]) and adjusted their parameters 
to fit our measurement [8]. According to the results [8] we 
propose the adaptable optimization technique [9]. It uses 
the multislope modeling approach [7][9] and describes the 
log-distance dependency of path loses (2) [10] as

where n is the path loss exponent setting the slope of the 
model (nFREE SPACE = 2), d is the propagation distance, d0 is 
the reference distance (typically d0 = 1 m) and PLd0 is 
the frequency dependent parameter describing the free space 
path loss (1) at the reference distance d0 = 1 m.  
We enhanced the log-distance model with a multislope 
adaptation as described in [9]. We have optimized the break 
point positions of a multislope model. According to the MSE 
estimation, we adjusted the path loss model to fit with the 
measurement (Figure 4). Our adaptable modeling algorithm 
uses PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) to adapt the 
position of break points (blue and red triangles in Figure 4). 
The first break point bp0 is static and its position is 
determined as the free space path loss (1) at a distance 
of 40 m. This distance represents correction of the BS height

the position of the other three break points (bp1, bp2, bp3) 
in the range from 40 m to 1000 m The algorithm changes the 
position (distance and path loss) of the breakpoints and 
model path losses according to (3) [9].

where the first part is similar to (2) and describes 
propagation losses up to the first breakpoint, h1 is the 
distance of the first breakpoint, d0= 1 m is the reference 
distance. The summation in the second part of (3) describes 
the propagation losses between the first (bp1) and the last 
(bp4) breakpoint (the red triangles in Figure 4), nBP is the 
total number of break points and hi is the distance of the i-th 
breakpoint. The last part of (3) describes the path losses in 
the distances d over the last breakpoint hnBP-1. 
To estimate the final path loss value in a particular 
propagation distance it is necessary to determine the correct 
value of nBP (representing the number of breakpoints) as the 
number of the last breakpoint previous to the desired 
distance. 
We use the model shown in Figure 3 with parameters: 
bp0= [40 m; 64 dB], bp1= [253 m; 100 dB], bp2= [542 m; 
104 dB], p3= [1000 m; 127 dB]. The standard deviation is 
12dB. 
VI. 
LOCALIZATION  
Measured signal strength is the initial parameter for the 
localization. Channel models (COST 231, ECC 131, our 
optimized multislope log-distance model) were applied to 
determine the propagation distance. Unfortunately, none of 
the tested models are precise enough to estimate the exact 
position applying simple triangulation. Areas like parks, 
squares, wide streets, and crossroads cause spatial ambiguity 
and an inaccuracy of the propagation model. Moreover, 
the relative MS position, reflections and interferences (co-
channel, adjacent channel, intersystem) could cause 
degradation of the measured RxLev value.  
The visual presentation is performed in the UTM 
coordinate system. Displayed by blue circles and circular 
arcs in Figure 5 and Figure 6 represent the propagation 
distance In Figure 6 the sectors of the cells are considered.  
A. Geometric Localization Technique 
This technique is possible to apply only in case that the 
MS have connection with at least three BSs. The triangular 
constellation of connected BSs is mandatory. The best results 
were achieved with the constellation conformable to an 
equilateral triangle (Figure 5).  
The basic principle is to link the neighboring BS with 
a line to create the triangle (red lines in Figure 5). Next, 
divide those lines according to the ratio of the RxLev value. 
The perpendicular line (green lines) is led through this 
dividing point of each side of triangle. Intersections of the 
green lines create a small triangle. The space limited by this 
triangle defines the possible MS position. Then the final MS 
position is estimated in the center of the small triangle (the 
upper red cross on left). The second red cross on the right is 
the triangle’s centroid. The real GPS position of MS is 
marked with the green cross. 
The localization error for the case in Figure 5 is 165 m 
and the typical error of this technique was around 300m in 
an urban environment.

Figure 6.  Localization technique with optimization algorithm (localization 
error is 65 m). The blue arcs describe the modeled propagation distance of 
received RxLev in connected sectors of BSs. The green cross points real 
GPS position and the blue cross point the optimized position.
B. Optimization Localization Techniq 
This localization technique uses PSO (Particle Swarm 
Optimization) algorithm to estimate the MS position. 
In dedicated sectors of the linked BSs (blue triangles in 
Figure 6) the optimized channel model [9] determines the 
propagation distance (blue circular arcs in Figure 6).  
The TA value sets boundaries of the searched space. 
Twelve PSO agents move inside the defined space with the 
global scaling factor g= 2.49 and the personal scaling factor 
p= 1.5. The optimization algorithm has 25 iteration loops. In 
each loop, the main criteria function computes the criteria 
value K (4) for each of the twelve agents and store one with 
the minimal value. The stored value is compared with the 
values received in next loop. Ai represents the distance 
between the agent position and the modeled propagation 
distance (the blue circular arcs in Figure 6). Ai is weighted by 
Wi according to the modeled propagation distance Ri (the 
higher value of Ri, the higher value of weight Wi). The 
criteria function K for a single agent is described as

where Ri [m] is the modeled propagation distance between 
the BS and the MS (blue arcs in Figure 6) and Ai [m] is the 
Euclidean distance between the agent's position and 
the modeled propagation distance Ri. The nBS is the number 
of connected BSs. Wi is the weight describing the 
dependency on the modeled propagation distance Ri. 
C. Other Localization Approaches 
GSM localization based on measurement of the received 
signal strength use a fingerprinting approach [11][12]. This 
approach compares measured or modeled pattern of signal 
level in the desired area with an actual received value. 
Instead of determining the MS-BS distance, how it is 
performed in our approach. Additional improvements of 
fingerprinting technique are reported in [11] [13]. Achieved 
localization error was around hundreds of meters. The 
WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) localization 
proposed in [12] has an error of around a few meters.  
The localization error (in range of hundreds of meters) 
of the GSM techniques described in [11][13] is comparable 
with results obtained by our optimization technique. 
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
We presented the capabilities of localization in cellular 
wireless networks. We performed measurements of RxLev in 
the real GSM network in Brno. The post processing of the 
measured data predicts the propagation distance according 
to the applied channel model. Propagation models are not 
capable of involving every individual propagation scenario. 
Therefore, additional processing is performed to reduce 
ambiguity. Two localization methods are described and 
compared. 
The first approach is a simple geometric technique. 
The position is estimated as the ratio of received power from 
three BSs in the triangle constellation (Figure 5). 
The positioning error is around 300 m, but it is very strongly 
dependent on the triangular constellation of BSs. The second 
technique uses the PSO algorithm (Figure 6). The number

and the relative constellation of connected BSs influence the 
precision of localization. In some cases, the localization error 
was in ones of meters. Average error was in tens of meters 
for scenarios with at least three BSs connected.  
We created the database of BSs and stored measured and 
processed data. We use the CI and the RxLev localization 
technique. For path loss description, we use the multislope 
propagation model with optimization adaptation [9]. The 
mean localization error achieved by the geometric technique 
was around 300 m, the mean error achieved by the PSO 
technique was around 80 m. We proved the capabilities of 
the PSO technique in localization. The results were 
comparable with approaches presented in [11] [13]. 
We will focus our further work on a comparison of 
propagation models for serving and neighboring BSs and 
improving the optimization algorithm to adapt the size of the 
searched space. The fingerprinting technique will be 
considered and involved in the ongoing approach.
