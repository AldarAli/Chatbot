Abstract
The article proposes analytical methods for determining
trafﬁc characteristics of hierarchically organised telecom-
munication networks which are offered multi-service traf-
ﬁc streams. The article proposes a method for determin-
ing occupancy distribution in the group servicing multi-
service overﬂow trafﬁc. This method is based on modiﬁ-
cation of the Kaufman-Roberts recursion – elaborated for
the full-availability group with Poisson calls streams – and
uses Fredericks & Hayward approximation. Additionally,
a method for determining parameters of the trafﬁc overﬂow-
ing from primary groups servicing PCT11 and PCT22 trafﬁc
streams is also presented.
Keywords: overﬂow trafﬁc, PCT1, PCT2, multi-rate trafﬁc
1. Introduction
Modeling telecommunication networks employing the
strategy of redirecting trafﬁc via alternative routes, i.e. sys-
tems with trafﬁc overﬂow is a complex issue. This problem
comes down to resolving the two following basic problems,
namely: to a determination of trafﬁc characteristics of traf-
ﬁc that overﬂows from direct (primary) groups (with high
loss coefﬁcients usually), and a determination of the num-
ber the so-called Basic Bandwidth Units (or channels) in al-
ternative groups (with low loss coefﬁcients usually), where
the loss coefﬁcients will not exceed the assigned value.
Systems with overﬂow trafﬁc have been widely dis-
cussed e.g., in [8,22,35]. The above mentioned works, how-
1PCT1 – Pure Chance Trafﬁc Type One – type of trafﬁc in which we
assume that the service times are exponentially distributed and the arrival
process is a Poisson process. This type of trafﬁc is known as Erlang trafﬁc.
2PCT2 – Pure Chance Trafﬁc type Two – type of trafﬁc in which we
assume that the service times are exponentially distributed and the arrival
process is formed by the limited number of sources. This type of trafﬁc is
known as Engset trafﬁc.
ever, have dealt with single-rate trafﬁc only, i.e. with tradi-
tional single-service telephone networks. There have been
developed both exact [4,14,25,36] and approximate [15,35]
models of the full-availability group with overﬂow trafﬁc
assuming Poisson distribution of calls streams and the ex-
ponential distribution of holding time for calls offered to
the primary groups. The problem of modeling the groups
with overﬂow trafﬁc under assumption of hyper-exponential
distribution of the holding time has been described in [27]
while single-rate trafﬁc systems with overﬂow trafﬁc and ﬁ-
nite number of trafﬁc sources (PCT2) have been considered
e.g., in [26].
The basic method for determining trafﬁc characteristics
of multi-service systems employs the so-called Kaufman-
Roberts formulas (KR) [19, 24]. These equations allow to
reliably model systems with PCT1 streams that are offered
directly to the primary groups of telecommunication net-
works. The trafﬁc that is not serviced in such groups is
overﬂowed to an alternative group. This part of trafﬁc is
called the overﬂow trafﬁc. However, even if the streams
that are offered directly to the primary groups are of type
PCT1, the calls stream overﬂowing from the primary group
does not agree with the Poison distribution [35].
Overﬂow calls can appear only in the occupancy time
of all Basic Bandwidth Units of the primary group. This
means that the overﬂow stream is more "concentrated"
in certain time periods, i.e.
is characterized by greater
"peakedness" as compared with PCT1 trafﬁc. If identical
values of offered trafﬁc and the congestion are assumed,
then a greater number of Basic Bandwidth Units (BBUs)
is required for servicing overﬂow trafﬁc than that required
for servicing PCT1 trafﬁc.
The following parameters can be used for statistical eval-
uation of the overﬂow stream: the mean value R of overﬂow
trafﬁc (the ﬁrst moment of the probability distribution of
the number of calls) and the second moment with the corre-
sponding variance σ2. With the help of those two parame-
ters it is possible to determine "unevenness" of the overﬂow
stream by the introduction of the concept of the peakedness

15
International Journal On Advances in Telecommunications, vol 1 no 1, year 2008, http://www.iariajournals.org/telecommunications/
coefﬁcient Z that is equal to the ratio of the variance σ2 to
the mean value of overﬂow trafﬁc R:
Z = σ2/R.
(1)
The "unevenness" of the overﬂow stream can also be evalu-
ated by the application of the parameter D that is the differ-
ence between the variance and the mean value of overﬂow
trafﬁc:
D = σ2 − R.
(2)
It is noticeable that the parameters Z and D take the fol-
lowing values for the offered trafﬁc, serviced trafﬁc and the
overﬂowed trafﬁc:
• for offered trafﬁc: Z = 1 and D = 0,
• for serviced trafﬁc on the primary group (smooth traf-
ﬁc): Z < 1 and D < 0,
• for overﬂow trafﬁc: Z > 1 and D > 0.
The service process of a Poisson calls stream in a full-
availability group can be thus characterized by four parame-
ters A, V, R, σ2 (σ2 can be replaced by Z or D). The stream
offered to the group is here determined by one parameter A
– the mean value of the offered trafﬁc, whereas the overﬂow
trafﬁc stream by two: the mean value of the overﬂow trafﬁc
R and its variance σ2.
Having the above in mind, we can come to a conclusion
that the KR equations in their basic form (devised with the
assumption of the exponential distribution of time gaps be-
tween calls) cannot be applied to determining call blocking
coefﬁcients in multi-service trafﬁc in the alternative group.
The problem of modeling the full-availability group with
overﬂow trafﬁc with known value of parameter Z was taken
in [7], and then in [20, 34]. The methods for modeling the
systems with multi-service overﬂow trafﬁc (under the as-
sumption of inﬁnite number of trafﬁc sources) including
the methods for determining parameters of overﬂow traf-
ﬁc, an occupancy distribution in alternative groups and di-
mensioning systems with multi-service overﬂow trafﬁc was
presented in [10,11,13].
The other group of methods, enabling modeling the
systems with overﬂow trafﬁc, are the methods based on
Markov-Modulated Poisson Processes, published in [6, 17,
21]. Among this group of methods, the highest accuracy,
in case of multi-service systems, assures the method pro-
posed in [6]. The accuracy of this method is related to high
computational complexity of the process of calculating the
variance of overﬂow trafﬁc based on analysis of multidi-
mensional Markov process in the system composed of two
groups, i.e. the primary group and the alternative group. Ex-
ponential order of computational complexity (in function of
number of classes of calls) makes practical application of
this method very difﬁcult.
The purpose of the article is the proposition of a con-
sistent methodology for determining trafﬁc characteristics
of systems which are offered overﬂow multi-service trafﬁc
streams, generated both by ﬁnite and inﬁnite source popu-
lation. On the basis of author’s earliest results [10–13]), the
method for determining occupancy distribution in the group
servicing multi-service overﬂow trafﬁc will be presented.
The proposed method is based on the appropriate modiﬁca-
tion of the Kaufman-Roberts recursion [19,24] – elaborated
for the full-availability group with Poisson trafﬁc – and uses
the idea of Fredericks & Hayward approximation.
In order to keep consistency of the considered problems,
we start considerations from presentation of basic analyti-
cal dependencies for systems with single-rate overﬂow traf-
ﬁc in Section 2. In Section 3 it is presented the method
for determining occupancy distribution in groups servicing
multi-service overﬂow trafﬁc. Section 4 includes the de-
scription of the method for determining parameters of the
trafﬁc overﬂowing from primary groups servicing multi-
service PCT1 and PCT2 trafﬁc streams. Comparison of an-
alytical and simulation results of blocking probability in al-
ternative groups servicing multi-service overﬂow trafﬁc is
performed in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper.
2. Modeling systems with overﬂow single-rate
trafﬁc
2.1. Overﬂow traﬃc parameters
The trafﬁc that overﬂows from the direct group which
is offered PCT1 trafﬁc can be characterized with the help
of the following two parameters: the mean value of over-
ﬂow trafﬁc R and its variance σ2 (or the coefﬁcient Z or
the coefﬁcient D). In order to evaluate analytically these
parameters we will consider the following model: a full-
availability group with the capacity of V Basic Bandwidth
Units (the primary group) is offered trafﬁc of the type PCT1
with the mean intensity A:
A = λ
µ.
(3)
The next assumption is that the trafﬁc that is not carried be-
cause of the occupancy of all the BBUs of the considered
group overﬂows to a next full-availability group (the alter-
native group) with an unlimited number of BBUs. The val-
ues to be determined are: the average number of busy BBUs
R in the alternative group (mean value of overﬂow trafﬁc)
and its variance σ2 (variance of overﬂow trafﬁc).
The process going on in the system presented in Fig-
ure 1, composed of two full-availability groups, is deter-
mined by the the two-dimensional discrete Markov chain:
{ω(t), ρ(t)}, where ω(t) is the number of busy BBUs in

the original group at the point of time t, whereas ρ(t) is the
number of busy BBUs in the alternative group at the point
of time t. The state probabilities of the system under con-
sideration are denoted with the symbols [pω,ρ]V,∞ and are
deﬁned in the following way:
[pω,ρ]V,∞ = lim
t→∞ P {ω(t) = ω, ρ(t) = ρ} ,
(4)
where: (0 ⩽ ω ⩽ V ) and (0 ⩽ ρ ⩽ ∞). The probabilities
[pω,ρ]V,∞ can be determined on the basis of the system of
state equations that, for the considered process, takes the
following form:
. . .
−(λ + ρµ) [p0,ρ]V,∞ + µ [p1,ρ]V,∞ +
+(ρ + 1)µ [p0,ρ+1]V,∞ = 0 . . .
−(λ + ωµ + ρµ) [pω,ρ]V,∞ + λ [pω−1,ρ]V,∞ +

Once the system of equations (5) has been solved, it is
possible to determine all essential properties of the system
with trafﬁc overﬂow. A determination of the parameters R
and σ2, related to the alternative group with unlimited ca-
pacity, can be, however, simpliﬁed as compared to the sys-
tem (5). This possibility of simpliﬁcation is connected with
the fact that for a determination of parameters R and σ2 the
knowledge of all probabilities [gρ]∞ is not necessary, but it
is sufﬁcient to know only those probabilities [gρ]∞ that re-
late to the alternative group only, regardless the occupancy
state of the primary group, i.e.:
[gρ]∞ =
V

(6)
Knowing the occupancy [gρ]∞, it is possible to determine
the parameters to be found, i.e. R and σ2:
R =

σ2 =

(7)
Derivations of Equation (7) will be omitted here (they are
to be found in, for example, [1, 4, 35]), by giving the ﬁnal
result derived by J. Riordan [35]:
R = AEV (A),
(8)
σ2 = R [A/ (V + 1 − A + R) + 1 − R] .
(9)
In calculational practice, instead of the variance σ2 the pa-
rameter D is often used.
Hence, on the basis of Equa-
tion (2), (8) and (9) we obtain:
D = R [A/ (V + 1 − A + R) − R] .
(10)
Formula (8) is intuitively self-evident since it is only traf-
ﬁc lost in the original group that can be the offered trafﬁc
and, at the same time, be carried by the inﬁnite alterna-
tive group. It should be noted that, quite predictably, for
V = 0 (zero capacity of the original group), R = σ2 = A,
since all the PCT1 trafﬁc is directed to the alternative group.
Generally, for each value of the parameters A and V of the
full-availability group, the parameters of overﬂow trafﬁc R
and σ2, or R and D can be unequivocally determined.
In telecommunications networks, calls streams from
several high-usage full-availability groups most frequently
overﬂow to one alternative path. If we assume that PCT1
streams offered to high-usage primary groups are statisti-
cally independent, then the streams that overﬂow from these
groups will also be independent. In such a case, the param-
eters of the total overﬂow trafﬁc offered to the alternative
path are determined by the following formulas [31]:
R =
υ
X
s=0
Rs,
σ2 =
υ
X

D =

(11)
where: υ – number of primary group, Rs – mean value of
overﬂow trafﬁc from s-th group, σ2
s – variance of overﬂow
trafﬁc from s-th group.
2.2. Method of equivalent random traﬃc
Analysing Formulas (8) and (10) we can notice that the
parameters A and V determine unequivocally the parame-
ters of the overﬂow trafﬁc R and D of a given group. Conse-
quently, these formulas can be used to solve a reverse prob-
lem, i.e. to determine unequivocally the parameters of the
original group A and V on the basis of the parameters of the
trafﬁc that overﬂows from this group: R and D [31]. This
conclusion has been applied to the ERT method (Equivalent

Random Trafﬁc), which has been worked out independently
by R. I. Wilkinson [35] and G. Bretschneider [4].
The ERT method consists in ﬁnding such an equivalent
PCT1 trafﬁc with the mean value A∗, that when offered to
a ﬁctitious equivalent group with the equivalent capacity of
V ∗, will cause an overﬂow of trafﬁc with identical mean
value and variance as the actual trafﬁc offered to a given al-
ternative group [31]. In this way, the trafﬁc initially deﬁned
by the pairs of parameters: As and Vs (the alternative group
usually services trafﬁc overﬂowing from a few high-usage
primary groups), will be described by one pair of parame-
ters only (A∗, V ∗).
The parameters A∗ and V ∗ of the equivalent group can
be determined on the basis of the obtained values R and D,
solving the set of Riordan equations [35]:
R = A∗EV ∗(A∗),
(12)
D = R [A∗/ (V ∗ + 1 − A∗ + R) − R] .
(13)
Such equivalent trafﬁc, determined by the pair of the pa-
rameters (A∗, V ∗), requires V ∗ + Valt BBUs for servicing
calls with assigned quality B. The required capacity of the
alternative group can be obtained on the basis of Erlang-B
formula, written in the following form:
E = B = E(V ∗+Valt)(A∗),
(14)
where E is the blocking probability, and B is the loss prob-
ability in the alternative group.
Summing up, the ERT method, presented graphically in
Figure 2, can be written in the form of the following algo-
rithm:
Algorithm 1 ERT Method
1. Determination of the mean value Rs and the param-
eter Ds of each of υ (s = 1, . . . , υ) trafﬁc streams
that overﬂow to the alternative group (Equations (8)
and (10));
2. Determination of the parameters of the total stream
that overﬂows to the considered alternative group, as-
suming statistical independence of overﬂow streams
(Equation (11));
3. Determination of the parameters A∗ and V ∗ of the
equivalent group on the basis of the obtained param-
eters R and D; these parameters can be determined by
providing solution to the Riordan system of equations
(Equation (13));
4. Determination of the required capacity of the alterna-
tive group for the assigned quality of service in the sys-
tem equal to B (Equation (14)).

Figure 2. Graphical representation of the ERT
method
The determination of the parameters of the equivalent
group (A∗, V ∗) is a complex issue and requires the appli-
cation of complex, iterative computational programs [23,
31]. Therefore, to simplify the calculations, special nomo-
grams have been developed [28] that present in graphic
form dependencies between pairs of parameters (A∗, V ∗)
and (R, D). If, however, the above graphic dependencies
are unavailable, then to determine the parameters (A∗, V ∗)
one can use the approximate solution of the system of equa-
tions (12) and (13), proposed by G. Rapp [22]:
A∗ = σ2 + 3σ2
R
σ2
R − 1

,
(15)
V ∗ = A∗ (R2 + σ2)
R2 + σ2 − R − R − 1.
(16)
It should be stressed that the determined values of parame-
ters A∗ and V ∗ obtained after the application of Rapp for-
mulas are approximate, with the accuracy of calculations
being the lowest within the area of low loss probability val-
ues [33]. With values of this probability lower than 1%,
the approximation error can exceed 20%. Therefore, for
B < 0.01 (which happens rarely in high-usage primary
groups in real networks) it is more convenient to use the
cited above nomograms [28]. A detailed analysis of the ac-
curacy of this method has been worked out by J. M. Holtz-
mann and presented in [16] which shows the dependency
between the error of loss probability, determined by the
ERT method, and the number of BBUs of the alternative
group Valt and the overﬂow trafﬁc parameters R and σ2. On
the basis of these dependencies it is possible to ﬁnd that the
error increases with the increase of the variance of overﬂow
trafﬁc σ2, while it diminishes along with the increase in the
number of BBUs in the high-usage primary group [31].

2.3. Fredericks-Hayward Method
Let us consider a full-availability group with the capacity
of V BBUs which is offered overﬂow trafﬁc with the mean
value R and variance σ2. The peakedness coefﬁcient of the
offered trafﬁc is then:
Z = σ2(R)
R
.
(17)
Let us perform the following transformation, presented in
Figure 3.
Let us divide the group into Z identical full-
availability groups (subsystems), each one with the capac-
ity:
Ve = V
Z .
(18)
Each group is offered then trafﬁc with the mean value:
Re = R

Now we can determine the peakedness coefﬁcient of traf-

count (19) and (20), we get:
Ze = σ2
e
Re

RZ
= 1.
(21)
The peakedness coefﬁcient equal to one means that traf-
ﬁc Re is a PCT1 trafﬁc. Thus, we have made a transfor-
mation of the full-availability group – described by the pa-
rameters (R, V, Z) – which is offered overﬂow trafﬁc into
Z subsystems (full-availability groups) – described by the
parameters (R/Z, V/Z, 1) – which is offered PCT1 trafﬁc.
Since all groups are identical, blocking probabilities in all
groups will be also identical. In work [8] it is assumed that
blocking probability in the group (R/Z, V/Z, 1) will be the
same as in the initial group (R, V, Z). Therefore, we can
write:
E(R, V, Z) ≈ E(R/Z, V/Z, 1) ≈ E V
Z

.
(22)
Formula (22) is a modiﬁed Erlang-B formula that takes into
consideration non-Poisson nature of the calls stream offered
to the group. In teletrafﬁc theory, this formula is called
Fredericks-Hayward formula.
The presented reasoning for Equation (22) assumes mu-
tual independence of trafﬁc offered to the subsystems. In
real world, a distribution of the trafﬁc stream into several
identical streams without an application of an appropri-
ate call assignment mechanism is not possible. The intro-
duction of such a mechanism is, however, tantamount to
the introduction of mutual correlation between the streams,
which, in turn, can be interpreted as a lack of independence
of the trafﬁc streams offered to the subsystems. This phe-
nomenon makes the formula (22) an approximated formula.
It should be stressed, though that it is characterized by high
accuracy [8,18].
Equation (22) forms the basis for Fredericks-Hayward
method [8] and can be described in the form of the follow-
ing algorithm:
Algorithm 2 Fredericks-Hayward Algorithm
1. Determination of the mean value and the variance of
each of υ trafﬁc streams that overﬂows to an alternative
group based on the formulas (8) and (9);
2. Determination of the parameters of the total overﬂow
trafﬁc (Equation (11)) offered to the alternative group
and the peakedness coefﬁcient (Equation (1)) of the
trafﬁc, assuming statistical independence of the over-
ﬂow streams;
3. Determination of the number of BBUs of the alter-
native group (with the assigned quality of service,
equal to B) on the basis of Fredericks-Hayward for-
mula (22).
Fredericks-Hayward method is far more simple than the
ERT method since it requires only calculations based on
Erlang-B formula. The formula is used in two steps of the
algorithm – with the determination of mean value of trafﬁc
that overﬂows to the alternative group (Formula (8)) and,
in the form of Fredericks-Hayward formula, with the de-
termination of the capacity of the alternative group (For-
mula (22)).

3. Modeling of full-availability groups with
multi-service overﬂow trafﬁc
3.1. Basic assumptions
Let us consider ﬁrst a fragment of the network shown in
Figure 4, servicing multi-service PCT1 trafﬁc streams. It
is assumed that each of primary groups is offered only one
call class. The adopted assumption is to facilitate the un-
derstanding of the introduced analytical dependencies. Sys-
tems in which primary groups service many classes of traf-
ﬁc will be presented in Section 4.

Figure 4. A fragment of the network with over-
ﬂow trafﬁc
There are m = mI high-usage primary groups in the
considered system. The group designated by number i has
the capacity equal to Vi BBUs. Each of the groups is of-
fered a different calls stream characterized by the trafﬁc in-
tensity Ai. The calls of class i demand ti BBUs to set up
a connection.
3.2. Parameters of overﬂow traﬃc
As the result of occupying successive BBUs in primary
groups, a situation ensues in which the groups get blocked
and trafﬁc overﬂows to an alternative group with the ca-
pacity Valt. Blocking coefﬁcients in primary groups can be
calculated with the help of the Erlang-B formula. One has
to take into consideration, however, that one call of class i
occupies simultaneously ti BBUs [10,11].
Therefore, from the point of view of the Erlang model, it
is tantamount to ti-fold decrease of the capacity of the group
with the real capacity of Vi BBUs. What it means is that
before the substitution to Erlang-B formula, the group ca-
pacity should be divided by the number of BBUs demanded
to set up a connection of a given class. With the case of
non-integral values Vi/ti, calculations of blocking proba-
bility can be performed using the interpolation method or
the approximation of Erlang loss formula in the following
form [32]:
EN+δ =
AEN+δ−1(A)
N + δ + AEN+δ−1(A),
(23)
where N +δ is non-integral value of group’s capacity (N is
an integer part and δ is a fraction). To start the calculation
process we need to use an approximate formula:
Eδ ≈ (2 − δ)A + A2
δ + 2A + A2 .
(24)
Another way to obtain the same values of blocking coef-
ﬁcients is to apply the Kaufman-Roberts formulas [19,24]:
n [Pn]V =
m
X
i=1
Aiti [Pn−ti]V ,
(25)
Bi = Ei =
V
X
n=V −ti+1
[Pn]V ,
(26)
where [Pn]V is the occupancy distribution, i.e. the proba-
bility of n BBUs being busy in the system. Equations (25)
and (26) will take into consideration the group with the ca-
pacity of Vi which is offered one calls stream with Poisson
distribution formed by the calls that demand ti BBUs to set
up a connection [10,11].
Knowing the blocking coefﬁcients in primary groups we
are in position to calculate the parameters of overﬂow trafﬁc
of each of the classes, i.e the mean value Ri and the vari-
ance σ2
i . For this purpose, the Riordan formulas (8) and (9)
are used. Then, on the basis of the obtained parameters,
we determine the unevenness of individual calls streams of
overﬂow trafﬁc by calculating the values of peakedness co-
efﬁcients Zi = σ2
i /Ri.
It should be emphasised that the possibility of direct ap-
plication of Riordan formulas, elaborated for systems with
single-rate trafﬁc, results from the assumption that each pri-
mary group is offered only one trafﬁc class [10,11]. In the
case when all groups serve calls of several trafﬁc classes,
the determination of variance of overﬂow trafﬁc becomes
a complex problem [2,3], despite the value of trafﬁc inten-
sity can be simply obtained on the Kaufman-Roberts formu-
las (25) and (26). An approximate method of elaboration of
the variance of the trafﬁc overﬂowing from primary group
servicing mixture of multi-service trafﬁc will be presented

3.3. Modeling overﬂow traﬃc in systems
with inﬁnite number of traﬃc sources
Calls lost in primary groups are offered to an alterna-
tive group and, successively, begin to occupy its resources.
Thus, the group services m call classes. In order to de-
termine blocking coefﬁcients in such a group we apply the
analogy to Hayword method, described in Section 2.3. Let
us remind that the method was designed to determine the
blocking coefﬁcient in the group with the capacity of V
BBUs with single-service trafﬁc which was offered over-
ﬂow trafﬁc stream with the mean value R, additionally
characterized by the peakedness Z.
In this method the
Fredericks-Hayword equation is used, i.e. the Erlang-B for-
mula with appropriately modiﬁed parameters A and V . In
the case of a group with multi-service trafﬁc, we will apply
the identical modiﬁcation to Kaufman-Roberts formulas:
Ealt,1, Ealt,2, . . . , Ealt,m =
= KR
R1
Z1
, R2
Z2
, . . . , Rm
Zm
; t1, t2, . . . , tm; Valt


,
(27)
where KR(·) denotes the algorithm for determining block-
ing coefﬁcients of calls of particular classes E1, E2, ...,
EM, on the basis of the Kaufman-Roberts equations (25)
and (26) that take on the following form [10,11]:
n [Pn]Valt/Z =

· ti [Pn−ti]Valt/Z,
(28)
Balt,i = Ealt,i =
Valt
Z

n= V
Z −ti+1
[Pn]Valt/Z.
(29)
The peakedness coefﬁcient acts a normalization func-
tion. By dividing the mean values of overﬂow trafﬁcs of
particular call classes by the corresponding values of the
coefﬁcients Zi, we perform a transformation of the uneven
overﬂow trafﬁc stream into the Erlang stream. Similarly as
in the dependence (22), we also divide the capacity of the
alternative group V by the value of the peakedness coefﬁ-
cient. Let us notice that the capacity of the alternative group
in the formulas (28) and (29) is divided by the so-called
overall peakedness coefﬁcient Z. The problem of deﬁnition
of this coefﬁcient, for m calls classes, where each can have
individual value of the peakedness Zi, was taken in [10].
According to these considerations, the relevant parameter
will be approximated by the weighted mean of the coefﬁ-
cients Zi of particular calls streams:
Z =
m
X
i=1
Ziki,
(30)
where
ki =
Riti
Pm
l=1 Rltl
(31)
It is adopted in Equation (30) that the contribution of
peakedness Zi of a stream of class i in the overall peaked-
ness coefﬁcient Z is directly proportional to the value of
trafﬁc offered to the alternative group by class i calls. The
plausibility of this assumption has been proved by simula-
tion studies [13].
The formulas (28) and (29) are a generalization of the
Kaufman-Roberts formulas for all kinds of groups servicing
multi-service trafﬁc, both non-Poisson calls streams (over-
ﬂow trafﬁc) and Poisson calls streams. For the Poisson dis-
tribution, the value of the peakedness is equal to one and
then the formulas (28) and (29) will take on the form of the
basic Kaufman-Roberts formulas (25) and (26).
3.4. Modeling of overﬂow traﬃc in systems
with ﬁnite number of traﬃc sources
In this section it is presented an analytical method for de-
termining the mean value and the variance in systems with
multi-service trafﬁc overﬂowing from primary groups ser-
vicing multi-service PCT2 trafﬁc streams [12]. The pre-
sented method is based on the method elaborated in [5]
for the networks servicing single-rate trafﬁc.
The basis
of this method is the application of ERT method to con-
vert the trafﬁc stream generated by the ﬁnite population of
sources (PCT2 trafﬁc stream) to the equivalent trafﬁc stream
generated with the assumption of the inﬁnite population of
sources (PCT1 trafﬁc streams) [29].
Let us consider a group with the capacity of Vj BBUs
servicing a ﬁnite number of sources for each trafﬁc class.
Let Nj be a number of sources of class j requiring tj BBUs
to be serviced. The input calls stream of class j is built
by the superposition of Nj two-state trafﬁc sources which
can alternate between the active (busy) state ON (the source
requires tj BBUs) and the inactive state OFF (the source is
idle). When a source is busy, its call intensity is zero. Thus
the arrival process is state-dependent. The class j arrival
rate in the state of n BBUs being busy can be expressed by
the following formula:
λj(n) = (Nj − nj(n))Λj,
(32)
where nj(n) is a number of class j calls being serviced in
state n (state of n BBUs being busy) and Λj is the mean
arrival rate generated by an idle source of class j. In the
considered model we assume additionally that the holding
time for calls of particular classes has an exponential distri-
bution. Thus, the class j trafﬁc αj offered by an idle source
is equal to:
αi = Λi
µi
,
(33)
where 1/µj is the mean holding (service) time of class j
calls.

Let us additionally assume, that Nj > Vj. Based on
the results presented in [5] and [29] we can determine the
mean value RPCT2,j, the variance σ2

primary groups carry multi-service trafﬁc that is composed
of several classes of calls.
The assumption that has been used so far allowed us to
determine the variance of trafﬁc that overﬂows from pri-
mary groups in a simple way through the application of Ri-
ordan formulas. With the case when the group carries multi-
service trafﬁc, direct application of the Riordan formulas is
not possible. In this section we will present an approxi-
mate method for determining variances of different trafﬁc
streams that overﬂow from groups servicing multi-service
trafﬁc.
Let us consider the fragment of a multi-service network
shown in Figure 6. The system is composed of υ primary
high-usage groups.
Each of the group s = 1, . . . , υ is
offered mI,s PCT1 trafﬁc streams and mJ,s PCT2 trafﬁc
streams (ms = mI,s + mJ,s). Calls of class c demand tc
BBUs to set up a connection3. The intensity of PCT1 trafﬁc
stream of class i offered to the group s is Ai,s. The inten-
sity of PCT2 trafﬁc offered by a single idle source of class j
in the group s is αj,s, while the intensity of trafﬁc Aj,s(n)
offered by all idle PCT2 sources of class j in the group s de-
pends on the occupancy state n of the group in the following
way:
Aj,s(n) = (Nj,s − nj,s(n))αj,s,
(45)
where nj,s(n) is the number of in-service sources of class j
in the state of n BBUs being busy.
The trafﬁc of particular classes, which is blocked in pri-
mary groups overﬂows to the alternative group. The block-
ing coefﬁcient for calls of class i (PCT1) in the direct group
s (Ei,s) can be determined on the basis of the Kaufman-
Roberts formulas (25) and (26).
In the case of the full-availability group with PCT2
trafﬁc stream, the Kaufman-Roberts recursion (25) can be
rewritten in the form that includes characteristics of Engset
trafﬁc streams, namely:
n[Pn]Vs =
mJ,s
X
j=1
Aj,s(n − tj)tj[Pn−tk]Vs.
(46)
According to the considerations presented in [9], the pa-
rameter nj,s(n) in Equation (45) can be approximated by
the so-called reverse transition rate and can be calculated
on the basis of the local equations of equilibrium [19,30]:
nj,s(n) =
(
Aj,s(n − tj)[Pn−tj]Vs

[Pn]Vs
for n ≤ Vs,
0
for n > Vs.
(47)
The reverse transition rate determines the average num-
ber of class j calls serviced in the state n.
Let us note
that to determine the parameter nj,s(n) the knowledge of
3In the paper it is assumed that the letter "i" denotes a Poisson (Erlang)
trafﬁc class, the letter "j" – a Binomial (Engset) trafﬁc class, and the letter
"c" – an arbitrary trafﬁc class, (c = i|j)

the occupancy distribution [Pn]Vs, is necessary.
In or-
der to determine the distribution [Pn]Vs in turn, it is nec-
essary to know the value nj,s(n).
Equations (47) and
(46) form then a set of confounding equations that can be
solved with the application of iterative methods. In line
with [9], in the ﬁrst iteration we assume that the parame-
ters ∀j∈mj∀0≤n≤V n(0)
j,s(n) = 0. The adopted assumption
means that the Engset streams – in the ﬁrst iteration – can
be treated as an equivalent Erlang streams generating the
offered trafﬁc with the intensity:
Aj,s(n) = Aj,s = Nj,sαj,
(48)
which is equal in value to the trafﬁc offered by all free
sources of class j Engset stream. The state probabilities,
obtained on the basis of Eq. (46), constitute the input data
for the next iteration l, where the parameters n(l)
j,s(n) and
subsequently Aj(n) are designated. The iterative process
ends when the assumed accuracy ϵ is obtained:

. (49)
The obtained occupancy distribution [Pn]Vs in the group
with Engset trafﬁc streams allows us to calculate the block-
ing probability Ej,s on the basis of Equation (26).
Knowing blocking probabilities for PCT1 and PCT2
streams we are in position to determine the mean value

23
International Journal On Advances in Telecommunications, vol 1 no 1, year 2008, http://www.iariajournals.org/telecommunications/
of the intensity of class c trafﬁc that overﬂows from the
group s:
Rc,s = Ac,sEc,s.
(50)
To characterize overﬂow trafﬁc fully it is necessary to
determine the variance of each of calls streams. This pa-
rameter will be determined in an approximate way by car-
rying out a decomposition of each of the real groups into ms
ﬁctitious component groups with the capacities Vc,s. Each
ﬁctitious group will be servicing exclusively calls of one
class, which will make it possible to apply the Riordan for-
mulas to determine the variance σ2
c,s of the trafﬁc of class c
that overﬂows from the group s. Let us determine then the
capacities of the ﬁctitious groups. For this purpose we ﬁrst
determine the carried trafﬁc of class c in the group s:
Yc,s = Ac,s(1 − Ec,s).
(51)
According to the deﬁnition, the value Yc,s deﬁnes the av-
erage number of calls of class c serviced in the group s.
Therefore, the mean value of the intensity of class c trafﬁc,
expressed in BBUs, will be equal to Yc,stc. The capacity
of a ﬁctitious component group Vc,s will be deﬁned as this
part of the real group Vs which is not occupied by calls of
the remaining classes (different from class c). Thus, we
get [10–12]:
Vc,s = Vs −
mI,s+mJ,s
X
l=1;l̸=c
Yl,stl,
(52)
where Vs is the capacity of the primary group and the sum
on the right side of Equation (52) determines the number
of BBUs occupied by the calls of the remaining classes.
The proposed decomposition allows us to use the method
proposed in Section 3.4, to convert the system with PCT2
trafﬁc streams to the equivalent PCT1 trafﬁc streams.
Having all the parameters at our disposal for PCT1, i.e.
Ri,s, Ai,s, Vi,s and PCT2, i.e. A∗
j,s, Rj,s, V ∗
j,s, Vj,s we
can – on the basis of the Riordan formula – determine the
variance σ2

the alternative group:

(54)
where the quotient Vc,s/tc normalizes the system to
a single-service case. Such an operation is necessary since
the Riordan formulas in their basic form are designed for
determining overﬂow trafﬁc parameters in single-service
systems.
Since individual calls streams offered to the system are
statistically independent, then the parameters of the total
trafﬁc of class c offered to the alternative group will be equal
to:

At this point we have all the parameters that character-

ing at our disposal the dependencies (55), we can determine
the occupancy distribution and the blocking probability in
the system with overﬂow multi-service trafﬁc shown in Fig-
ure 6. In order to do that, we can apply the formulas (28)
and (29), where the overall coefﬁcient Z is determined ac-
cording to Equation (30).
Summing up our considerations, we can present the pro-
cess of determining occupancy distribution in the alternative
group of hierarchically organised networks with overﬂow
trafﬁc in the form of the Algorithm Overﬂow-MKRR.

trafﬁc are the approximate methods. To determine the pre-
cision of the proposed solution, results of analytical calcula-
tions were compared with the simulation data. The research
was carried out for two networks. The ﬁrst network was
composed of ﬁve primary groups servicing multi-service
PCT1 (Erlang) trafﬁc streams and one alternative group
(with the capacity of 200 BBUs) servicing the trafﬁc over-
ﬂowing from the primary groups. The second network was
composed of three primary groups servicing multi-service
PCT2 (Engset) trafﬁc streams and one alternative group
(with the capacity of 100 BBUs) servicing the overﬂowed
trafﬁc.
The parameters of the offered trafﬁc and the capacities
of individual groups are given in the captions to Figures 7
and 8 presenting the obtained blocking probability results
in the alternative group – both analytical and simulation re-
sults. The value of the blocking probability is expressed in
the function of normalized trafﬁc a offered to a single BBU

The simulation results are shown in Figures 7 and 8 in
the form of appropriately denoted points with 95-percent
conﬁdence interval, calculated according to the t-Student
distribution for 5 series, with 1000000 calls of each class.
On the basis of the obtained blocking probability re-
sults in the considered systems we can state that the pro-
posed calculational method for overﬂow trafﬁc parameters
combined with the modiﬁcation of Kaufman-Roberts for-
mula (28) provides high accuracy of calculations.
6. Conclusion
An analytical method for determining the occupancy dis-
tribution and blocking probability in groups of telecom-
munication networks servicing overﬂow multi-service traf-
ﬁc is presented in the article.
The presented method is
based on a modiﬁcation of the Kaufman-Roberts formula,

which involves an introduction of the peakedness coefﬁ-
cient Z that characterizes the unevenness of the overﬂow
calls stream. Additionally, an analytical method for deter-
mining the occupancy distribution and blocking probability
in groups of telecommunication networks servicing over-
ﬂow multi-service trafﬁc with a ﬁnite as well as inﬁnite
number of trafﬁc sources is presented in the article. The
presented method is based on conversion of trafﬁc streams,
generated by ﬁnite source population, to the trafﬁc streams,
generated by inﬁnite source population. The accuracy of
the proposed analytical method is veriﬁed by the presented
simulation data.
