Abstract— Reliable and efficient transportation system in 
smart cities relies on effective integration of connected and 
autonomous vehicles. Although there has been a lot of 
improvements in this technology, additional support from the 
emerging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are needed to 
streamline the future transportation systems' capabilities. This 
paper investigates the problem of data routing in UAV-assisted 
vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) composed of multiple 
flying nodes and intelligent cars aiming at exchanging 
messages through the dynamic network topology. The 
introduction of UAVs can offer multiple advantages to the 
routing process thanks to their free mobility and enhanced 
channel quality but, at the same time, they are subject to many 
limitations including their limited batteries and positioning 
issues. This paper provides a comprehensive survey about the 
advantages and challenges related to the use of UAVs in data 
routing in VANETs. Then, it discusses some existing routing 
protocols for connected vehicles supported by UAVs. Finally, 
the paper introduces the idea of combining routing protocols 
with UAV locations and/or path adjustment solutions to enable 
efficient data routing for delay-tolerant applications.

 INTRODUCTION 
Intelligent transportation system (ITS) constitutes one of 
the most important key components of future smart cities [1]. 
Reliable and efficient ITS is necessary to ensure safe and 
smarter transport networks. This requires the integration of 
multiple 
technologies, 
such 
as 
advanced 
wireless 
communication, computational, and sensing techniques to 
exchange and collect accurate and real-time information 
about the traffic and state of the transport network. 
Connected vehicles play an essential role in rendering the 
driving experience safer and more efficient. Using embedded 
communication capabilities, the vehicles can autonomously 
inform their neighbors about their status and motion 
parameters to mitigate any danger in the roads and avoid 
traffic jams [2]. The collected information can also be 
forward via cellular networks or deployed road side units 
(RSUs) to the traffic operator in order to monitor and control 
the transport networks.  
Research in connected vehicles has witnessed significant 
advances over the last decade [3]-[5]. The most tackled issue 
in such scenarios is the mitigation of the instability of the 
wireless links connecting these mobile vehicles. Several 
routing algorithms have been proposed in the literature 
optimize the exchange and collection of data in these 
vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). However, the 
performances of connected vehicles remain limited due to 
the short ranges of the communication links, their random 
mobility, and fast dynamic topology change [6]. Therefore, 
there is still a need to support the intelligent vehicles with 
other road and transportation components. To this end, 
micro-unmanned aerial vehicles (micro-UAVs), aka drones, 
can be efficient candidates with great potentials to support 
the ground vehicles to overcome their limits and improve the 
quality of service of diverse ITS applications. Hence, UAV-
assisted VANETs are henceforth the leading solution for 
data exchange and collection in ITS. 
In this paper, we investigate the data routing process in 
UAV-assisted VANETs. In Section II, we will highlight the 
advantages and challenges related to the employment of 
UAVs in ITS. Afterwards, in Section III, a brief survey 
summarizing the developed data routing techniques with an 
emphasis on the UAV mobility impact is presented. Next, in 
Section IV, we investigate a particular scenario where we 
propose our joint routing path selection and UAV 
positioning solution. Finally, we conclude the paper in 
Section V.

ADVANTAGES AND CHALLENGES OF UAVS IN DATA 
ROUTING 
Supporting connected vehicles by UAVs offer potential 
gains to enhance the performance of data exchange. UAVs 
can play an important role in routing the data between the 
different ground nodes due to the following advantages: 
 Channel Quality: Thanks to their placement flexibility 
especially at high altitudes, UAVs can provide reliable line-
of-sight (LoS) communication links with the ground vehicles 
[7]. Indeed, the higher the altitude is, the more the 
probability to establish LoS links occur. In this way, the 
system throughput of this air-to-ground (A2G) or ground-to-
air (G2A) link is enhanced allowing the transmission of 
higher amount of data during the routing process. Moreover, 
transferring data from UAV to UAV is much more efficient 
than using traditional V2V communications through ground-
to-ground (G2G) channels. Indeed, air-to-air (A2A) channels 
are subject to lower path loss and shadowing effects, which 
offer better channel quality. Hence, exchanging data between 
two ground nodes through multiple flying UAVs is much 
more 
efficient 
than 
using 
traditional 
methods. 
Mathematically, the free-space path losses in dB of A2A and 
G2G links corresponding to a LoS and non-LoS (NLoS) 
channels can be written as follows:

          𝑃𝐿𝐴2𝐴 = 𝑃𝐿𝐿𝑜𝑆 = 10𝛾 log10 (
4𝜋𝑓𝑐𝑑
𝐶
) + 𝐿𝐿𝑜𝑆,  
      (1) 
        𝑃𝐿𝐺2𝐺 = 𝑃𝐿𝑁𝐿𝑜𝑆 = 10𝛾 log10 (
4𝜋𝑓𝑐𝑑
𝐶
) + 𝐿𝑁𝐿𝑜𝑆,       (2) 
where 𝛾 is the path loss exponent, 𝑓𝑐 is the carrier frequency, 
𝑑 is the Euclidean distance separating the two nodes, 𝐶 is the 
speed of light, and 𝐿𝐿𝑜𝑆  and 𝐿𝑁𝐿𝑜𝑆  are two additional 
attenuation terms for the LoS and NLoS environments, 
respectively, such that 𝐿𝑁𝐿𝑜𝑆 ≫ 𝐿𝐿𝑜𝑆. It should be noted that 
other path loss models can be adopted. 
Regarding the A2G links, their path losses can be written 
as a linear function of the LoS and NLoS path losses 
weighted by the probability of having a path loss connection 
denoted by 𝑝𝐿𝑜𝑆. The A2G path loss is written as follows: 
          𝑃𝐿𝐴2𝐺 = 𝑃𝐿𝑜𝑆 𝑃𝐿𝐿𝑜𝑆 + (1 − 𝑝𝐿𝑜𝑆)𝑃𝐿𝑁𝐿𝑜𝑆.        (3) 
An expression of the path loss probability 𝑝𝐿𝑜𝑆  has been 
derived in [8] as follows: 
                           𝑝𝐿𝑜𝑆 =
1
1+𝛼 exp(−𝛽(𝜃(ℎ,𝑑)−𝛼)),  
      (4) 
where 𝛼  and 𝛽 are constants which depend on the 
environment and 𝜃 denotes the elevation angle and is given 
by 𝜃 =
180
𝑝𝑖 sin−1 (
ℎ
𝑑) where ℎ is the UAV's altitude. From 
this expression, we can deduce that UAV placed at high 
altitude will increase the probability of having a LoS link and 
hence, improving the channel condition. At the same time, it 
may increase its distance with ground node. A tradeoff 
between the altitude and the distance separating the 
communicating has to be achieved to enhance the channel 
quality. 
 Free Mobility: Thanks to their three dimension (3D) 
mobility, UAVs can offer additional degrees of freedom to 
enhance the data routing. Indeed, they can cover larger areas 
with the ability to transmit collected data in real-time or store 
it on-board for future use. Moreover, unlike vehicles that 
have to move according to road directions or fixed road side 
units (RSU), UAVs can be placed at any location in order to 
establish direct connectivity with other nodes. This flexibility 
allows these flying nodes to connect other out-of-range 
nodes and act as relays for their communications. Therefore, 
placing UAVs in optimized locations and/or efficiently 
planning their paths would contribute in enhancing the data 
routing 
process 
in 
UAV-supported 
VANETs. 
This 
constitutes one of the major challenges in data routing 
through the flying nodes. In addition, to the traditional path 
selection task that has to be performed in the VANET 
dynamic topology, placing and/or moving the UAVs to 
ensure better support to the routing path represents another 
objective that has to be jointly optimized. In such scenarios, 
balancing between path selection using traditional routing 
protocols and UAV positioning is a non-trivial task mainly 
for moving UAVs. 
The free mobility can also be subject to certain 
limitations. First, UAVs are not necessarily employed to 
route data. In most of the cases, they are used for other tasks, 
such as traffic monitoring or collecting images or videos. 
Hence, they can participate in the data routing procedure, 
i.e., the secondary task, if the objective of the primary task is 
not affected. Therefore, the support offered by the UAVs 
might be limited in space and time. For instance, UAVs 
cannot freely move out of certain regions defined by the 
operator or related to the primary task. Moreover, relaying 
UAVs may not be always available due to their limited 
primary task engagement or allocated energy budget. Finally, 
the UAV mobility has a negative effect on the channel 
quality. Indeed, high Doppler spread can be observed when 
both the UAV and car are mobile. This may limit the 
performance of the routing process. 
 Battery-Limited Nodes: Unlike vehicle nodes, UAVs are 
battery powered and require frequent to-and-fro trips to 
reload their batteries, which may affect their contributions in 
the data routing process [9]. Hence, the energy consumption 
of UAVs has to be taken into account during the data routing 
optimization procedure to ensure seamless communication 
between the nodes. In addition to the energy of the 
communication interface, additional and relatively more 
important energy is consumed to ensure the hovering and 
forward flight of the UAVs. Hence, the UAVs that are 
selected to participate in the routing procedure need to have 
sufficient energy to complete the data transfer. This may 
impact the transmit power level of the UAVs, affect their 
communication range, and limit their mobility. 
III. 
DATA ROUTING TECHNIQUES AND USE-CASES 
In UAV-assisted VANET, UAVs and ground vehicles 
can contribute to the data routing procedure where messages 
can be exchanged through air, ground, or both. The path 
selection is dependent on the objective of the process, such 
as the reduction of the total transmission time or the 
conservation of the link stability. Some of the applications 
in ITS allow some delay in the data transfer. Hence, the data 
routing procedure can be adapted to the type of applications 
which can be classified to delay-intolerant applications and 
delay-tolerant applications. In the sequel, we briefly discuss 
the routing protocols that can be applied in UAV-assisted 
VANET and the challenges corresponding to the tolerance 
of applications. 
A. Routing Protocols 
Several routing protocols involving UAVs have been 
discussed in literature [10]-[12]. Most of them are applied to 
Flying Ad hoc Networks (FANET) only. The routing 
protocols are classified as proactive, reactive, hybrid, and 
geographic routing protocols. The first protocol category 
assumes either fixed routing tables loaded to the UAVs 
before operation or periodically refreshed tables where the 
latest updates are considered to transfer the data. These 
protocols assume low topology variation even if the UAVs 
are in motion. The use of fixed routing tables requires a fixed 
topology. This can be applied for a group of nodes (UAVs 
86

VEHICULAR 2017 : The Sixth International Conference on Advances in Vehicular Systems, Technologies and Applications

and/or ground vehicles) having coordinated movement 
which is not the regular case in UAV-assisted VANET. For 
low frequencies of routing tables update, the protocols' 
performances can significantly degrade due to the very 
dynamic topology of the network and the distributed control 
of the nodes and their mobility. Optimized link state routing 
protocol (OLSR) is one of the prominent algorithms that are 
used in VANETs and FANETs. However, several extensions 
of OLSR have been presented in the literature to cope with 
the nodes mobility and high signaling overhead problems. In 
[13], directional antennas and cross-layer schemes based on 
flight information of UAVs have been added to the 
functionalities of the traditional OLSR in order to enhance its 
routing table’s updates. A fast OLSR protocol has been 
proposed in [14] to meet the need of highly dynamic 
topology. This leads to a considerable increase in the 
signaling overhead especially for the in-motion node. The 
authors of [12] have proposed a predictive OLSR protocol 
using Global Positioning System (GPS) information to 
measure the quality of wireless links between nodes. The 
movement of UAVs are predicted based on their past 
mobility and speed. The routing tables are then pre-
constructed based on these predictions. The performances of 
all these OLSR extensions remain dependent on the routing 
tables’ accuracy and the stability of the links connecting the 
nodes.  
The second routing protocol category known as reactive 
protocols proposes to discover paths for data transfer on 
demand. With such protocols, periodic messages are avoided 
but a delay has to be considered in order to establish the 
routing path before the data transmission. In addition to that, 
these protocols are designed for wireless mesh networks 
where a source needs to find a routing path to transfer its 
data to a target destination. Ad-hoc On-demand Distance 
Vector (AODV) is one of these reactive protocols where the 
source is aware about the next-hop information only [15]. 
Hybrid protocols represent a combination of proactive and 
reactive protocols. This protocol category will lead to more 
efficient performances but may cause additional delays in 
order to discover route in addition to extra signaling 
overhead. 
The geographic routing protocol is a position-based 
routing protocol assuming that each node is aware of its 
neighbors' geographic locations [16]. The data transfer is 
performed such that each node selects its closest neighbor to 
the destination such that the distance to destination is 
reduced. In some cases, this greedy behavior of the algorithm 
fails to find a next hop closer to the destination. In such a 
scenario, face routing can be applied to help in finding 
another route to be followed by the geographic routing 
protocol. Although these greedy protocols do not require 
routing tables, their achieved routing paths remain 
suboptimal and may require higher number of hops before 
reaching destination compared to other categories. 
B. UAV Path and/or Location Adjustment for Data Routing 
The aforementioned algorithms, which are originally 
designed and applied to MANETs and VANETs, are applied 
for delay-intolerant applications where the objective is to 
find a route as fast as possible to deliver data. The total 
routing operation time, which is consisted of the route 
construction time and the data transfer time, is in the order of 
milliseconds. In such scenarios, the routing process requires 
the existence of communication links between some of the 
nodes such that the data can be routed. However, in many 
cases and especially in ITS, seamless routing paths might not 
be found due to deficient communication links between two 
or multiple nodes. Therefore, shifting the locations of some 
nodes can enhance the link quality and allow the discovery 
of routing paths. In UAV-assisted VANET, dedicated UAVs 
can be controlled by the operator to ensure connectivity. The 
operator may decide to place UAVs in precise locations to 
act as relays for other ground nodes. Another scenario could 
correspond to the case when relaying is not the principle task 
of UAVs. In such cases, UAVs can modify their current 
locations or their initial paths if they are in motion to support 
other nodes. For on-demand applications, the path or location 
adjustments of UAVs can lead to additional delay in the 
order of seconds and possibly minutes due to the flying time 
corresponding to the UAVs shift. Hence, such routing 
process involving UAVs path or location adjustment can be 
applied for delay-tolerant applications.  
In Figure 1, we illustrate examples of some routing 
scenarios involving UAVs. In Figure 1(a), the UAV collects 
information about a particular event in the transport network. 
The data is routed through flying and ground vehicles 
already deployed in the area as direct communication links 
exist. Delay-intolerant applications require the existence of 
such topology to enable successful routing. Notice that the 
absence of ground vehicle 1 causes the failure of the routing 
process due to long distance separating UAV 1 and UAV 2. 
Hence, in order to overcome this issue and enable successful 
routing, one possibility based on location adjustment is 
shown in Figure 1(b). In this case, UAV 2 shifts its location 
Figure 1.  Examples of routing scenarios in UAV-assisted VANETs.

from position (2a) to position (2b) in order to establish a 
direct link with UAV 1 without breaking up its link with 
UAV 3. This location adjustment will certainly cause certain 
delay in the routing due to the motion of the UAV but 
remain a good solution for applications tolerating a certain 
delay. If the distance separating UAV 1 and UAV 3 is very 
long such that it is not possible to find a location for UAV 2 
where it can establish direct communication links with its 
peers, UAV 2 seeks close location to UAV 1 to collect the 
data and then, return next to UAV 3 to forward it as shown 
in Figure 1(c). Finally, another special case of routing is 
given in Figure 1(d). One or multiple UAVs act as data 
collectors where each UAV has to follow a particular path to 
collect and store necessary information from various 
locations then, go back and send the data to the sink. Many 
use-cases related to this type of applications exist in ITS. In 
the following, we cite few of them: 
 Flying Accident Report Agent: In this case, one or a 
set of UAVs fly to the accident's‎ location‎ to ‎get ‎a ‎detailed‎ 
report‎ about the accident. The collected information need to 
be sent to the related authorities. When reaching the 
accident's location, the UAV can exploit the ground vehicles 
to transfer the data. Other UAVs can also support the ground 
nodes in the routing process. They UAVs can be partially 
shifted to be located between out-of-range nodes to allow 
them transfer their data. 
 Flying Road Side Unit: Enabled with Dedicated Short 
Range Communications (DSRC), the UAV will be used as a 
flying road side unit that can fly to a specific location to act 
as a V2X RSU (e.g., extend communication link at corners) 
or to broadcast useful information, such as traffic situation in 
the surrounding area, and suggest alternative detours. In this 
case, UAV path planning approaches can be developed to 
determine the locations of UAVs through which it has to 
pass by to collect the data from ground vehicles. Data 
routing approaches and clustering algorithms can be 
combined together to find how data can be efficiently 
collected in traffic network using UAVs. 
 Flying Police Eye: The UAV will provides the police 
agent with a top view video streaming to better assess the 
traffic around and easily detect specific traffic violations. If 
the UAV is not directly communicating with police vehicle 
then, data routing is required through the UAV-assisted 
VANET. 
Joint optimization of the data routing procedure in UAV-
assisted VANET using traditional routing protocols and 
UAV path and/or location adjustments is a new trend 
research direction that has to be investigated in academia and 
industry. The mobility of UAVs represents, at the same time, 
an advantage and a challenge that has to be well studied. 
Mechanisms enabling efficient coordination and routing 
among UAVs and close ground vehicles need to be 
developed 
while 
taking 
into 
account 
the 
specific 
characteristics of 3D mobile environment, the energy 
limitation, and the application objective. In the following 
section, we investigate an example of data routing in UAV-
assisted VANET involving the adjustment of some UAVs' 
locations to ensure an efficient data routing for delay-tolerant 
application. 
IV. 
SELECTED EXAMPLE AND SIMULATION RESULTS  
In this section, we provide an example of data routing 
involving location adjustments of UAVs for delay-tolerant 
applications. In the framework, we consider a multiple-UAV 
network where each UAV is executing a certain task related 
to a primary application. Some of the UAVs are selected to 
participate to a secondary task, i.e., data routing, in order to 
transfer data from a source to a destination. In case of the 
absence of direct communication link, some UAVs are 
shifted to ensure seamless transmission. The participating 
UAVs are chosen according to their battery state, mobility 
range tolerated by the primary application, and the channel 
quality. The objective is to minimize the data transfer time, 
denoted by 𝑇𝑡𝑟, from the source to the destination which is 
the sum of the total transmission time in addition to the 
mobility time denoted by 𝑇𝑛
𝑓 . To this end, the following 
mixed 
integer 
nonlinear 
programming 
problem 
is 
formulated: 
  
The decision variables of the optimization problem given in 
(5)-(6) are the binary matrix 𝝐, the binary vector 𝝅, and the 
matrix 𝑿𝒇. The entries 𝜖𝑛𝑚of the matrix 𝝐 denote the states 
of the links between UAV 𝑛  and UAV 𝑚, ∀𝑛, 𝑚 ∈
{1, … , 𝑁} where 𝑁 is the number of UAVs in the network. 
The parameters 𝜖𝑠𝑛and 𝜖𝑛𝑑  indicate the states of the link 
between the source and a UAV 𝑛 and the UAV 𝑛  and the 
destination, respectively. The entries of 𝝅  are binary 
variables indicating whether the UAV 𝑛 is moving from an 
initial location to another to support the data transfer. If yes, 
𝜋𝑛 =1. Finally, the entries of the matrix 𝑿𝒇 correspond to 
the coordinates of the new locations of 𝑁 UAVs. Note that 
𝑋𝑛
𝑓 = 𝑋𝑛
0 where 𝑋𝑛
0 are the initial locations of the UAV 𝑛.  In 
(5), the first term indicates that the data transmission begins 
88

when all the UAVs have reached their new locations. The 
other terms correspond to the transmission time over the 
selected path where 𝑇𝑐
𝑥𝑦 is the communication time needed 
to send the message from node 𝑥  to node 𝑦 . The 
communication time depends on the size of the message and 
the achieved throughput per each selected link. 
Constraint (6) indicates that the total energy consumed 
by the UAV during the shifting (𝐸𝑛
𝑓), the data transmission 
(𝐸𝑛𝑚
𝑐
), and the reception (𝐸𝑛𝑚
𝑟
) has to be less than the 
available energy in its battery allocated to the secondary task. 
In other words, we assume that, for each UAV, the operator 
assigns a certain amount of energy for the secondary task 
that we denote by 𝐸̅𝑛. Constraint (7) indicates that, a UAV 
cannot be shifted with a distance 𝐷𝑛 higher than 𝐷̅𝑛  in order 
to guarantee the safe operation of the primary task. The data 
flow conservation is guaranteed by constraint (8), which 
forces a UAV that received a data to forward it to other 
UAVs. Constraint (9) ensures that a data is transmitted to 
only one UAV and, with constraint (10), cyclic transmission 
within a single link is disabled. Cyclic data routing over the 
whole network is avoided by jointly imposing the constraints 
(8)-(10). Hence, a UAV will not receive the message twice 
or more during the routing. The equality constraints in (11) 
force the source to transmit the data and the destination to 
receive it. Finally, constraint (12) indicates that the data 
transfer can only be possible over seamless links defined by 
the binary parameter Φ𝑛𝑚 = 1. 
The formulated optimization problem given in (5)-(12) is 
a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. 
It is difficult and complex to reach the optimal solution of 
these non-convex problems due to the existence of 
combinatorial decision variables. Therefore, to solve it, sub-
optimal deterministic or meta-heuristic algorithms can be 
implemented. In the following simulation results, we employ 
an exploratory search strategy to solve the MINLP problem. 
Inspired from the Hooke-Jeeves search method applied for 
multimodal functions, the proposed algorithm tries to find 
the best directions and distances according to which the 
UAVs will move in order to establish seamless links for data 
routing. The objective is to find the best shift combinations 
for the UAVs that do not affect their energy budgets and do 
not lead to a high delay. Notice that, for fixed UAV 
positions, the optimization problem is transformed to an 
integer linear programming problem that can be optimally 
solved using CPLEX optimizer. 
Four different scenarios are studied in Figure (2). The 
UAVs' speed are set to 10 m/s and the size of the transmitted 
message is 10 kilobyte. Figures 2(a), 2(b), and 2(c) 
investigates the same network topology but for different 
energy budget distributions. Figure 2(d) illustrates another 
network topology. Figure 2(a) assumes the absence of energy 
constraints of all UAVs. The obtained routing path is directly 
obtained without the need to shift the UAVs with a total 
transmission time equal to 0.18 s. In Figure 2(b), UAV 4 and 
UAV 11 are not able to participate in the routing process due 
to their limited energy budgets (𝐸̅4 = 𝐸̅11 = 0). Hence, some 
direct links are degraded and a shifting operation is needed 
by some of the remaining UAVs. To this end, the 
exploratory approach shifts UAV 3 and UAV 2 and 
accordingly, UAV 5 and UAV 6 to establish direct link 
between the different nodes. Then, instead of transmitting the 
message to UAV 7, UAV 5 decides to forward it to UAV 2 
and UAV 2 skips UAV 11 and sends the message to UAV 6. 
The total transmission time is equal to 6.17 seconds due to 
the shifting operation. 
In Figure 2(c), we disable the contributions of all UAVs 
except UAVs 3, 7, 10, and 11. In this case, the approach 
decides to shift UAV 7 and UAV 3 in addition to UAV 11. 
The obtained transmission time is 13.1 seconds due to the 
high shifted distance (UAV 7). 
In Figure 2(d), the initial topology created by the 10 
UAVs imposes the execution of a shifting process in order to 
find a routing path over the FANET. In this scenario, we 
notice that four UAVs are slightly shifted: UAV 4, UAV 5, 
UAV 10, and UAV 3. These minor location adjustments 
result in a low total transmission time of 3.48 seconds. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we investigated the data routing process in 
UAV-assisted VANETs. We started by highlighting the 
advantages of using relays in ITS and the challenges that 
have to be addressed to ensure efficient data routing. 
Afterwards, we surveyed the data routing techniques that can 
be implemented in such scenarios by describing some 
interesting use-cases. Finally, we highlighted the need to 
proceed with location and/or path adjustments of UAVs in 
order to obtain direct communication links and seamless 
routing process. A particular scenario involving UAV 
location adjustment is finally investigated. The joint 
optimization of the routing process along with the location 
and path modifications remain a challenging research 
direction especially for delay-tolerant applications.
