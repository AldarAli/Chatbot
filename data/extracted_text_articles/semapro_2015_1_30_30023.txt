Abstract—Matching ontologies which utilize signiﬁcantly hetero-
geneous terminologies is a challenging task for existing matching
techniques. These techniques typically exploit lexical resources in
order to enrich the ontologies with additional terminology such
that more terminological matches can be found. However, they are
limited by the availability of an appropriate lexical resource for
each matching task. For this scenario, we propose a new technique
exploiting partial alignments. We evaluate our technique on
a dataset which is characterized by matching problems with
signiﬁcant terminological heterogeneities. Further, we compare
our technique with the performance of matching systems utilizing
lexical resources to establish whether a partial-alignment-based
matcher can perform similarly to a lexical-based matcher. Lastly,
we provide a performance indication of a system utilizing both
partial alignments and lexical resources.

INTRODUCTION
Semantically structured data facilitates many services
which are used in a modern society, ranging from agent
communication [1] to semantic querying systems [2]. An
important criterion for the functionality of such systems is their
ability to access multiple sources of semantically structured
data. The structure of this data is determined by an ontology,
which can be deﬁned using expressive languages, such as the
Resource Description Framework Schema (RDFS) or the Web-
Ontology-Language (OWL). Information exchange between
two sources is possible if both are based on the same ontology.
A common issue is that two sources of semantic data are
based on two different ontologies modelling the same domain.
The ontologies can differ with regard to their terminology,
structure, scope or granularity [3]. In order to transfer data
between different ontologies, the data has to be transformed
such that it complies with the ontology of the receiving
knowledge system. For this to happen, a mapping between
the two ontologies is needed. This mapping speciﬁes for every
concept in the ﬁrst ontology whether there is an concept in the
second ontology modelling the same information. The process
of creating such a mapping is known as ontology mapping.
Ontologies can differ by their applied terminologies. If two
ontologies are created by different domain experts then it may
happen that the experts prefer different terms in order to refer
to the same concepts. This problem can be exacerbated if the
two ontologies conform to different design principles, thus
varying with regard to their naming formats. Alternatively, the
ontologies may simply differ with regard to the used natural
language, which can occur in international data-exchange
situations. In these scenarios, the two given ontologies have
very little overlap with regard to their terminologies, a prob-
lem which we refer to as a terminological gap. Name-based
approaches for ontology mapping are thus unlikely to produce
satisfying mapping results in such scenarios.
Terminological gaps between ontologies are typically over-
come by exploiting additional resources. Existing techniques
exploit lexical resources in order to identify additional names
for ontology concepts [4], thus increasing the chance that cor-
responding concepts are associated with similar names. These
techniques however require the presence of an appropriate
lexical resource which is modelled with in such detail that
alternative labels can be extracted for all concepts of both
ontologies. Thus, it is not always the case that a suitable
lexical resource is available. However, it might be that there is
a different type of resource available for this scenario, being
a partial alignment [5]. A partial alignment is an incomplete
mapping between the given ontologies stemming from previ-
ous matching efforts. An example of such an effort is a domain
expert being unable to complete the mapping due to time
constraints. The main problem is how a partial alignment can
be exploited to aid the matching between ontologies between
which exists a terminological gap.
In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing a proﬁle-
based similarity which exploits the correspondences of the
given partial alignment. A typical proﬁle similarity creates a
virtual document of each concept by gathering the encoded
terminology of related concepts and itself. The core intuition
is that two concepts are considered similar if their documents
are similar. A key component here is that information of
related concepts is exploited as well. Our approach is based on
enriching the given ontologies by extracting the encoded se-
mantic relations of each correspondence of a partial alignment,
also known as anchors. We deﬁne an extension of a given
proﬁle similarity which utilizes the added relations in order to
identify additional terminology for each concept. We evaluate
our approach on a dataset consisting of matching problems
with distinct terminological gaps. Further, we compare our
approach to the performance of existing systems utilizing lexi-
cal resources. Lastly, we provide a performance indication for
systems utilizing both lexical resources and partial alignments.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. We
discuss relevant work in Section II. We introduce proﬁle
similarities and their ability to deal with terminological hetero-
geneous ontologies in Section III. The proposed approach is
detailed in Section IV. The experimental results are presented
in Section V. We present the conclusions and future research
topics in Section VI.

RELATED WORK
Proﬁle similarities have seen a rise in use since their
inception. Initially developed for the Falcon-AO system [6],
this type of similarity has seen use in ontology mapping
systems, such as AML [7] and RiMoM [8]. These systems
typically apply the same scope when gathering information
for a concept proﬁle, being the parent concepts and children
concepts. Some systems, such as YAM++ [9], limit the scope
to the information of the concept annotations and labels.

There exist some works that aim to extend the scope of
exploited proﬁle information in order to improve the effec-
tiveness of the similarity. The deployed proﬁle similarity in the
mapping system PRIOR [10] extends the scope of exploited
information to the grand-parent concepts and grand-children
concepts, providing a larger scope of exploitable context.
The combination of proﬁle similarities with a set of pro-
vided anchors has been tackled in [11]. However, [11] has
some fundamental differences compared to this paper. In [11],
ontology concepts are compared to the given anchors using
a selection of similarity metrics, e.g., a string, instance, and
lexical metric. Instead of extracting terminology, the concept
proﬁles are created using the results of these similarity cal-
culations. Concepts are matched if they exhibit comparable
degrees of similarities towards the provides anchors. Therefore,
this technique can only match terminological ontologies if
appropriate similarity metrics are applied and both ontologies
contain the exploited meta-data for these similarities.
A. Semantic Enrichment
One way in which additional information can be ex-
ploited is through semantic enrichment. Semantic enrichment
describes any process which takes any ontology O as input
and produces as output the enhanced ontology E(O), such that
E(O) expresses more semantic information than O. Typically,
a semantic enrichment process exploits resources such as stop
word lists or lexical resources for this purpose. Semantic
enrichment has been applied in ontology mapping systems in
a non-proﬁle context. Examples are the addition of synonyms
to the concept descriptions by exploiting lexical resources.
LogMap [4] is capable of adding information from WordNet or
UMLS to the ontologies prior to mapping. YAM++ [9] uses a
machine translator to generate English translations of labels
prior to mapping. Multilingual ontology mapping has been
speciﬁcally addressed in [12]. Ontologies are enriched with
multilingual labels using a machine translator. A feature vector
for each match candidate is constructed using a combination
of similarities and aggregation techniques. Match candidates
are then classiﬁed using a support vector machine.
A noteworthy application of semantic enrichment for a
proﬁle similarity is the work by Su et al. [13]. Here, the se-
mantic enrichment process exploits a set of documents. Using
a linguistic classiﬁer and optional user input the documents are
assigned to the ontology concepts, such that each assignment
asserts that the ontology concept is discussed in its associated
document. The concept proﬁles are then created by gathering
terminological information from the assigned documents.
III.
PROFILE SIMILARITIES AND TERMINOLOGICAL GAPS
Proﬁle similarities are a robust and effective type of
similarity metric and deployed in a range of state-of-the-art
ontology matching systems [6][7][8]. They rely on techniques
pioneered in the ﬁeld of information retrieval [14], where the
core problem is the retrieval of relevant documents when given
an example document or query. Thus, the stored documents
need to be compared to the example document or query
in order to determine which stored document is the most
relevant to the user. A proﬁle similarity adapts the document
comparison techniques by constructing a virtual document for
each ontology concept, also referred to as the proﬁle of that
concept, and determines the similarity between two concepts x
and y by comparing their respective proﬁles. The core intuition

of this approach is that x and y can be considered similar if
their corresponding proﬁles can also be considered similar.
As their origin implies, proﬁle similarities are language-
based techniques [15]. Language-based techniques interpret
their input as an occurrence of some natural language and use
appropriate techniques to determine their overlap based on this
interpretation. A language-based technique might for instance
perform an analysis on the labels of the concept in order to
determine their overlap. For instance, given the two concepts
Plane and Airplane a language-based analysis of their labels
would result in a high score since the label Plane is completely
contained within the label Airplane. Thus, despite the labels
being different, a high similarity score would still be achieved.
However, the degree of surmountable label-difference has a
limit for language-based techniques. The labels of the concepts
Car and Automobile have very little in common with regard
to shared characters, tokens or length. Thus, many language-
based techniques are unlikely to result in a high value.
Proﬁle similarities have the advantage that they draw from
wide range of information per concept. Thus terminological
differences between the labels of two concepts can still be
overcome by comparing additional information. This addi-
tional information typically includes the comments and annota-
tions of the given concept and the information of semantically
related concepts [6][10].
In order for two proﬁles to be similar, they must contain
some shared terminology. For example, the concepts House
and Home can still be matched if their parents contain the
word Building or if a concept related Home contains the word
“House”. In order for proﬁle similarities to be effective, it is
still required that the two given ontologies O1 and O2 exhibit
some overlap with regard to their terminologies. However,
this is not always the case as two ontologies can model the
same domain using a completely different terminology. This
can be the result of one ontology using synonyms, different

naming conventions or the usage of acronyms. Furthermore,
two ontologies might even be modelled in a different natural
language. For example, one might need to match two biomed-
ical ontologies where one is modelled in English and one in
Latin. Thus, it is a real possibility that even if there is some
overlap, there can exist corresponding parts of two ontologies
exhibit little to no terminological overlap. The terminological
gap between two ontologies is illustrated in Figure 1.
Figure 1 displays an example Ontology 1 next to a series of
concepts from a different ontology, Ontology 2, modelling the
same entities. The terminological gap is illustrated through the
fact that all information in Ontology 2 is modelled in German
instead of English. As we can see, comparing the concept
House with its equivalent concept Haus using a typical proﬁle
similarity is unlikely to produce a satisfying result since the
neither they nor their related concepts contain any overlapping
terminology. Therefore, additional measures are necessary in
order to ensure the effectiveness of proﬁle similarities when
the given ontologies have little to no shared terminology.
IV.
ANCHOR-BASED PROFILE ENRICHMENT
A typical proﬁle similarity is inadequate for ontology
matching problems with signiﬁcant terminological gaps. One
way of tackling this issue is through semantic enrichment by
exploiting lexical resources such as WordNet [16] or UMLS
[17]. Techniques which fall under this category work by
looking up each concept in the given resource and adding
synonyms, additional descriptions or translations to the concept
deﬁnition. However, these techniques rely on several assump-
tions: (1) the availability of an appropriate resource for the
given matching problem, (2) the ability to locate appropriate
lexical entries given the naming formats of the ontologies,
and (3) the ability to disambiguate concept meanings such
that no incorrect labels or comments are added to the concept
deﬁnition. We can see that the performance of such techniques
is severely impacted if any of these assumptions fail. If (1) and
(2) fail then it is not possible to add additional information
to the concept deﬁnition, thus causing the ontology concepts
to be compared using only their standard proﬁles. To ensure
the ability of identifying correct lexical entries when dealing
with ambiguous concepts, one needs to apply a disambiguation
technique. State-of-the-art disambiguation systems can achieve
an accuracy of roughly 86% [18], meaning that even if a state-
of-the-art system is applied there is still a signiﬁcant proportion
of concepts which would be associated with unrepresentative
information based on incorrectly designated lexical entries.
If an appropriate lexical resource is not available, other
measures are necessary to overcome the terminological gap.
These typically are the exploitation of other ontological fea-
tures, for example the ontology structure. However, it may
be the case that instead of a lexical resource a different kind
of resource is available to be exploited. For a given mapping
problem it is possible that an incomplete alignment, also refer-
eed to as partial alignment, is available as additional input. A
partial alignment can stem from efforts such as a domain expert
attempting to create an alignment, but being unable to complete
it due to given circumstances, or from a high-precision system
generating such an alignment. The correspondences of the
given partial alignment can then be exploited in order to
determine the unidentiﬁed correspondences.
Our approach aims at adapting proﬁle similarities to be
appropriate for matching problems with signiﬁcant termino-
logical gaps through the exploitation of partial alignments. It
is based on the insight that an ontology will consistently use its
own terminology. For instance, if an ontology uses the term
Paper to refer to scientiﬁc articles, it is unlikely to use the
equivalent term Article in the descriptions of other concepts
instead, especially if the ontology is designed using a design
principle that enforces this property [19]. However, if a partial
alignment contains the correspondence Paper-Article, then one
can use this insight to ones advantage. For instance, given the
concept Accept Paper a proﬁle similarity is more likely to
match it to its appropriate counterpart Approve Article if the
proﬁle of Accept Paper contains the term ‘Article’.
A partial alignment PA is a set of correspondences, with
each correspondence asserting a semantic relation between
two concepts of different ontologies. The types of relations
modelled in a partial alignment, e.g., ⊒, ⊥, ⊓ and ≡, are
typically also modelled in an ontology and thus exploited in the
construction of a proﬁle. Thus, by semantically annotating the
given ontologies O1 and O2 with the correspondences of PA
it becomes possible to exploit these newly asserted relations
for the creation of the concept proﬁles. This enables us to
construct the proﬁles of O1 using a subset of the terminology
of O2, increasing the probability of a terminological overlap
between the proﬁles of two corresponding concepts. This idea
is illustrated in Figure 2.

semantic relation t between entity e1 ∈ O1 and e2 ∈ O2
with a conﬁdence of c ∈ [0, 1].

Anchor A correspondence belonging to a partial alignment.
Collection of words: A list of unique words where each word
has a corresponding weight in the form of a rational
number.
+: Operator denoting the merging of two collections of words.
×: Operator denoting element-wise multiplication of term
frequencies with a weight.
depth(x): The taxonomy depth of concept x within its ontol-
ogy.
D: The maximum taxonomical depth of a given ontology.
Next, it is necessary to provide a deﬁnition of a basic proﬁle
similarity upon which we can base our approach. For this, we
provide a deﬁnition similar to the work by Mao et al. [10].
Neighbouring concepts are explored using a set of semantic
relations, such as isChildOf or isParentOf. A base function
of a proﬁle similarity is the description of a concept, which
gathers the literal information encoded for that concept. Let x
be a concept of an ontology, the description Des(x) of x is a
collection of words deﬁned as follows:
Des(x)
=
collection of words in the name of x
+collection of words in the labels of x
+collection of words in the comments of x
+collection of words in the annotations of x
(1)
We deﬁne the proﬁle of x as the merger of the description of
x and the descriptions of semantically related concepts:
Proﬁle(x) =
Des(x) + P
p∈P (x) Des(p)+
P
c∈C(x) Des(c) + P
r∈R(x) Des(r)
(2)
where
P(x) = {p|x isChildOf p}
C(x) = {c|c isChildOf x}
R(x) = {r|r isRelatedTo x ∧ r /∈ P(x) ∪ C(x)}
In order to compute the similarity between two proﬁles, they
are parsed into a vector-space model and compared using the
cosine similarity [20]. To bridge the terminological gap we
aim to exploit the semantic relations provided by a given
partial alignment PA, such that we can enhance the proﬁle
of a concept x ∈ O1 using the terminology of O2. We refer to
this enlarged proﬁle as the anchor-enriched-proﬁle. For this,
we explore the parents, children and properties of a concept
x (or ranges and domains in case x itself is a property). If
during this exploration a concept y is encountered which is
mapped in a correspondence in PA to a concept e ∈ O2, then
Proﬁle(x) is merged with Des(e).
We will deﬁne the set that describes the extended collec-
tion of parentally-anchored-descriptions (PAD) with regard to
concept x in three variations. These gather the descriptions of
anchored concepts from the ancestors of x. To measure the
improvement caused by the addition of these sets, we also
deﬁne the omission of any such descriptions. They are deﬁned
as follows:
PAD0(x, PA) = ∅
PAD1(x, PA) = P
e∈E Des(e); where
E = {e|∃ < id, y, e, t, c >∈ PA; y isAncestorOf x}
PAD2(x, PA) = P
e∈E ω × Des(e); where
E = {e|∃ < id, y, e, t, c >∈ PA; y isAncestorOf x}
∧ω = D−|depth(x)−depth(y)|
D
(3)
An interesting point to note is that PAD2 utilizes the same
set of concepts than PAD1, but weighs their descriptions with
respect to the concept’s relative distance to x, such that the
descriptions of closer concepts receive a higher weight.
Exploring the children of x, we deﬁne the merged collec-
tion of child-anchored-descriptions (CAD) in a similar way:
CAD0(x, PA) = ∅
CAD1(x, PA) = P
e∈E Des(e); where
E = {e|∃ < id, y, e, t, c >∈ PA; y isDescendantOf x}
CAD2(x, PA) = P
e∈E ω × Des(e); where
E = {e|∃ < id, y, e, t, c >∈ PA; y isDescendantOf x}
∧ω = D−|depth(x)−depth(y)|
D
(4)
Lastly, we can explore the relations deﬁned by the properties
of the ontology, being isDomainOf and isRangeOf. Deﬁning
Oc as the set of concepts deﬁned in ontology O and Op as
the set of properties of O, we deﬁne the merged collection
of relation-anchored-descriptions (RAD) in two variations as
follows:
RAD0(x, PA) = ∅
RAD1(x, PA) =

if x ∈ Oc
P
e∈E Des(e); where
E = {e|∃ < id, y, e, t, c >∈ PA; y isDomainOf x∨
y isRangeOf x} if x ∈ Op
RAD2(x, PA) =

and F = {f|∃ < id, y, f, t, c >∈ PA ∃z ∈ Op;
x isDomainOf z ∧ y isRangeOf z} if x ∈ Oc
P
e∈E Des(e); where
E = {e|∃ < id, y, e, t, c >∈ PA; y isDomainOf x∨
y isRangeOf x} if x ∈ Op
(5)
The noteworthy difference between RAD1 and RAD2 is that
if x is a concept and the domain of property z, then every
range y of z will be explored as well. As an example, assume
we are given the concepts Car and Driver being linked by the
property ownedBy. Constructing the anchor-enriched-proﬁle of
Car using the set RAD1 would mean that we only investigate
if ownedBy is mapped in PA. Using RAD2 means we also
investigate Driver, which could provide additional context.
Given a partial alignment PA between ontologies O1 and
O2, and given a concept x, we deﬁne the anchor-enriched-
proﬁle of x as follows:
ProﬁleAE
κ,λ,µ(x, PA) = Proﬁle(x) + PADκ(x, PA)+
CADλ(x, PA) + RADµ(x, PA)

EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we will detail the performed experiments to
test the effectiveness of our approach and discuss the obtained
results. A widely used way of evaluating a mapping A is
by comparing it to a reference alignment R by calculating
the standard measures of Precision, Recall and F-Measure
[21]. When matching with a partial alignment PA the newly
computed correspondences are typically merged with PA in
order to create a complete mapping. However, this action
creates a bias with respect to the measured alignment quality.

For instance, if PA contains half the correspondences of R,
then the resulting Recall score cannot go below 0.5. It would
hence be desirable to use a measure which only focuses
on the correspondences that are contributed to PA to get a
better indication of their quality. To achieve this, we will use
adapted variants of Precision, Recall and F-Measure, which
take the presence of a partial alignment into account. Given a
computed alignment A, a reference alignment R and a partial
alignment PA, the adapted measures of Precision and Recall
are computed as follows:
P ∗(A, R, PA) = | A ∩ R ∩ PA |
| A ∩ PA |
(7)
R∗(A, R, PA) = | A ∩ R ∩ PA |
| R ∩ PA |
(8)
The adapted F-Measure can then be computed as follows:
F ∗(A, R, PA) = 2 ∗ P ∗(A, R, PA) ∗ R∗(A, R, PA)
P ∗(A, R, PA) + R∗(A, R, PA)

A. Multi-Farm
In this section we will present the results of our evaluation
on the Multi-Farm-sameOnto dataset. This data-set stems from
the OAEI 2014 [21] competition. The terminologies of the
ontologies in this dataset vary greatly since it is designed to
be a cross-lingual dataset. The set consists of 8 ontologies that
are modelled using 9 languages (including English). For each
pair of ontologies a set of mapping tasks exists consisting of
every possible combination of selecting different languages.
We generate the partial alignments by randomly sampling the
reference alignment with the condition that R(PA, R) = 0.5
and aggregate the results of 100 evaluations for each task. This
evaluation is repeated for every possible combination of κ, λ
and µ. The result of this evaluation is presented in Table I.

First, by comparing the performance of the baseline con-
ﬁguration ProfileAE
0,0,0 to any conﬁguration of our approach
we can easily see that our approach improves upon the
performance of the baseline. Adding the sets PAD or CAD
using either variation typically resulted in an F-Measure of
0.39-0.43, an improvement of 0.07 to 0.11 when compared
to the baseline. Curiously, enriching the proﬁles using RAD
alone typically resulted in a F ∗ score of approximately 0.5.
This could indicate that for this dataset the concept annotations
more often contain terms of related concepts than ancestors or
descendants.
Looking at dual-combinations between PAD, CAD and
RAD we can see a consistent increase in performance. Of these
combinations, ProfileAE
1,1,0 resulted in the lowest F-Measure
of 0.47, while ProfileAE
1,0,1 resulted in the highest F-Measure
of 0.583. We can also observe that combinations which include
a variation of the RAD-set in the enriched proﬁles typically
performed better than combinations that didn’t.
Lastly, we can observe using all three types of description
sets resulted in the highest measured F ∗ score. We can see
that every combination of PAD, CAD and RAD resulted in an
F ∗ score higher than 0.6. The best performing combination
was ProfileAE
2,2,1 with an F ∗ score of 0.622.
Comparing RAD1 with RAD2 reveals that combinations
which utilized RAD1 performed slightly better than combina-
tions which used RAD2 instead. This implies that concepts
which are related through properties are less likely to share
terms, leading to many impact-less terms being added to the
concept proﬁles.
B. Comparison with Lexical Enrichment Systems
The main goal behind this work is to provide an approach
that allows the enrichment of concept proﬁle by exploiting the
relations of a provided partial alignment. The reason behind
this is that current enrichment methods exploit primarily lexi-
cal resources, which rely on the presence of an appropriate
resource. In the previous sections, we have established the
performance of our approach using different conﬁgurations,
datasets, and partial alignment sizes. In this section, we will
provide some interesting context for these results. Speciﬁcally,
we aim to compare the results of our approach with the
performances of matching systems tackling the same dataset
while exploiting lexical resources. This allows us to establish
whether an approach exploiting a partial alignment can pro-
duce alignments of similar quality as approaches exploiting
lexical resources. To do this, we will compare the performance
of our approach on the Multi-Farm dataset [21] to the per-
formances of the OAEI participants which competed in the
2014 evaluation. Here we will make the distinction between
approaches utilizing no external resources, lexical resources
and partial alignments. This allows us to see the beneﬁt of
exploiting a given type of external resource.
Furthermore, to provide an upper boundary for the potential
performance on this dataset, we will also evaluate a method
utilizing both lexical resources and partial alignments. To
achieve this, we will re-evaluate the best performing conﬁg-
uration from sub-section V-A. However, the proﬁles of this
re-evaluation will be additionally enriched by translating the
concept labels using the Microsoft Bing translator. This will
provide an indication of how well a system may perform
when utilizing both appropriate lexical resources and partial

alignments. The comparison can be seen in Table II. Perfor-
mances of approaches utilizing partial alignments are denoted

From Table II, we can make several observations. First, we
can observe that every system utilizing either lexical resources
or partial alignments performs signiﬁcantly better than systems
which do not. This is an expected result given the nature of
this dataset. Of the system which do not exploit resources AOT
has the highest performance with an F-Measure of 0.12.
Comparing the performance of ProfileAE
2,2,1 to the perfor-
mance of system exploiting only lexical resources reveals an
interesting observation. Speciﬁcally, we can see that the perfor-
mance of these systems is comparable. While the performances
of LogMap and XMap were lower than ProfileAE
2,2,1, with an
F-Measure of 0.62 the performance of AML is very close to
the performance of ProfileAE
2,2,1. However, AML distinguishes
itself from our approach by having a notably higher precision
and a somewhat lower recall. In fact, all systems utilizing only
lexical resources are characterized with a high precision, which
implies that enriching ontologies using these resources only
rarely leads to false-positive matches in terminology.
Lastly, we can observe the performance of our approach
when paired with a lexical resource, speciﬁcally Bing Trans-
lator. The produced alignments reached an F ∗ score of 0.843,
which is signiﬁcantly higher than the OAEI participants. This
implies that the correct correspondences which lexical-based
systems ﬁnd differ signiﬁcantly from the correct correspon-
dences of a partial-alignment-based system. From this we can
conclude that the two types of resources are complementary
for matching problems with signiﬁcant terminological gaps.
VI.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented a technique aimed at tackling
ontology mapping problems with signiﬁcant terminological
heterogeneities between the given ontologies. This technique
exploits an existing partial alignment by enriching the given
ontologies with the relations asserted in the partial alignment.
We establish the performance of the approach on a dataset
characterized by terminological heterogeneous mapping prob-
lems. A comparison with other matching systems reveals that
the approach performs similarly to systems utilizing lexical
resources. Combining our approach with a lexical resource
reveals that a signiﬁcantly higher performance can be achieved
if both partial alignments and lexical resources are utilized.
