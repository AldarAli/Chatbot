Abstract: In response to global recession and 
increased competition, organizations have tried to 
become more efficient by decreasing costs and 
streamlining 
operations. 
To 
achieve 
this, 
the 
philosophy of lean management has gained in 
popularity. The main obstacle organizations face 
when implementing lean is deciding which activities 
to implement lean principals on. A well known lean 
practice, value stream mapping, is a very effective 
tool in mapping the current and future state of an 
organizations 
lean 
activities. 
Limitations 
in 
calculating variability information that describe 
system variations and uncertainty means more 
powerful analytical tools are needed. Simulation 
offers a more thorough analysis of a system’s data, 
including the examination of variability and has the 
ability to change certain parameters and measure key 
lean performance indicators. Using a tire distribution 
company as a case study, this paper has developed a 
framework that uses discrete event simulation as an 
integrative layer between current and future value 
stream mapping. The framework maps current state 
value and non-value activities in the company and 
through simulation has highlighted the activities that 
should be used when developing the future state map. 
This paper has highlighted simulation as a crucial 
middle layer in value stream mapping that will 
generate more accurate future state maps than the 
more common practices of using random estimates 
and experience alone.

INTRODUCTION 
The theory behind lean philosophy is to create 
more value with less. Over the last decade, 
competition between organizations has become a 
matter of not only productivity, but also of overall 
supply chain performance [1]. Delivering the right 
quantity of products to the right place and at the 
right time has become a necessity for supply chain 
survival in an ever-more-acutely competitive 
atmosphere [2]. The quest to offer high levels of 
service to customers, while keeping a worthwhile 
profit margin, has forced managers to think of new 
ways to eliminate waste from their internal 
operations. Lean thinking is one of the most 
effective techniques managers can use in this 
ambition.  
The „lean‟ strategy represents a holistic attack on 
all negative aspects of resource consumption, and 
seeks to achieve streamlined and waste-free 
operations [3]. While the focus of lean thinking 
literature has essentially been on production 
systems, the notion can also be stretched to cover 
every management activity. Recent research [4], [5] 
attention was directed into the use of simulation 
modeling in lean implementation and assessment 
processes due to many reasons including: 
1. Identifying the factors and parameters involved 
in the manufacturing process. 
2. Exploring the various opportunities of process 
improvement. 
3. Predicting the impacts of the proposed changes 
before implementation. 
4. Reducing the risks associated with lean 
implementation process. 
5. Mapping the future state of organizations‟ – 
value stream mapping. 
6. Assessing the interaction influence between 
system‟s components and parameters.   
Based on the above reasons, primarily 1,3 and 5, 
and through case study application, this paper has 
developed a framework (Fig. 1) that uses 
simulation and modelling as an integrated layer 
between  current and future state value stream 
maps. To achieve this, Section II will give a 
background 
overview 
of 
lean 
management, 
generally and from the case study perpective of 
distribution. This is followed by a detailed profile 
of the case study industry; tire distribution, and the 
case study tire distriubtion company (hereafter to 
be 
known 
as 
TDC) 
in 
relation 
to 
lean 
implementation in Section III. Section IV will 
develop a current value stream map of TDC using 
data collected through extensive field work in the 
industry. This map will then be used in Section V 
to build an accurate simuation model of the TDC 
system that can be analysed in Section VI to aid in 
a future state value stream map before conslusions 
and future work are discussed in Section VII. 
II. 
LEAN MANAGEMENT 
Lean management as a philosophy, rather than a 
stand-alone practice, aims to create a streamlined, 
high quality system that can achieve a high level of 
customer service with minimum cost with little or 
no waste. Originating from Toyota Production 
System (TPS), lean thinking has become one of the 
most effective management concepts in the world 
[6].  Lean processes encompass a wide variety of 
161

management practices, and variations in system 
parameters can have significant impact on its 
implementation. In the last decade, many authors 
expanded their lean research beyond manufacturing 
to include lean services, lean supply chain and lean 
logistics. As a result, lean definitions became more 
generic and were identified as a series of activities 
and strategies that are applied to eliminate 
operations waste and non-value added processes. 
Because service applications are subject to a much 
greater degree of variability than industrial 
production, new lean practices are required to be 
applied in service and supply chain environments 
[7], [8], [9]. Applying lean thinking promotes many 
changes 
in 
system 
strategies, 
operational 
characteristics and human behaviors [10], and has 
been applied in many manufacturing environments 
and as many publications have flagged, TPS has 
given eminent proof of lean capabilities. Survey of 
the literature reveals the five main principles of 
lean management to be: 
1. Identifying what creates value (from the 
customer perspective); 
2. Identifying value streaming (by understanding 
all process steps and defining waste);  
3. Establishing value flow (without interruption 
or waiting); 
4. Production by pull concept (instead of 
producing in excess); 
5. Achieving perfection (by eliminating all waste 
elements) 
The supply chain environment presented in this 
paper is that of the distribution center, a 
strategically critical service provider within the 
supply chain which has not fully utilized the 
potential of lean management. 
A. Lean Distribution 
Despite the continuous growth in academic 
publications representing the implementation of 
lean management in service sectors and supply 
chains, applications of lean on distribution are still 
scarce [11]. Being the first innovator of lean 
manufacturing concept in 1960, Toyota is also 
considered the pioneer in expanding the same 
concept to other supply chain tiers such as 
distribution and suppliers [12]. Toyota applied 
several lean practices on distribution elements such 
as delivery, ordering, warehouse management, 
dealers and network structure aiming to reduce the 
stock level while keeping high service rates [8]. 
The development of lean practices on distribution 
by Toyota have been used as the foundations for 
the development and categorization of lean 
practices available to the case study company used 
in this paper. 
III. 
TYRE DISTRIBUTION CENTER CASE STUDY 
Intensive global competition, reductions in brand 
loyalty, increasing tire life spans and high costs of 
raw materials (e.g., natural rubber, bio-chemical 
materials) have impacted on tire distributors‟ 
financial performance negatively and increased the 
market pressure upon them. Despite market 
volumes growing by 2.3% over the seven years of 
2003-2008, financial growth was just 2.1% [13], 
and this unsettled the industry‟s big players and led 
to a number of mergers and acquisitions, most 
notably the alliance of Goodyear Dunlop and 
Bridgestone/Firestone. In this acute atmosphere tire 
distributors have had to find efficient ways to cut 
costs and increase efficiency by reducing waste to 
survive.

Lean thinking is considered a robust concept to 
reduce different types of waste, so implementing 
lean 
practices 
acts 
to 
promote 
company 
competitiveness [14]. The important role that 
distribution activities play in achieving high 
customer satisfaction levels has prompted many tire 
distributors to adopt lean components in full or in 
part. TDC have agreed to implement lean 
management 
techniques 
to 
certain 
activities 
highlighted using the VSM framework developed 
in this paper.  Because of financial confidentiality 
reasons, TDC would only allow data to be collected 
on non-financial specific details therefore total 
costs could not be measured; therefore this paper 
has concentrated on information and material flows 
and the parameters and performance indicators 
specific to them. 
A. Tire Distribution Center 
TDC is an Irish based distribution center for one of 
the biggest brand names in the global tire market. It 
supplies tires for a wide variety of customers 
ranged between individual customers to large scale 
companies which in turn impact on the variety of 
customer orders regarding to items quantities and 
types. In order to keep as many customers on 
board, the company‟s response to its customers has 
to be fast, accurate, on-time, with the least possible 
price. Hence, an advanced enterprise resource 
planning (ERP) system has been applied to link the 
customers directly to the distribution internal 
operations, 
replenishment 
process 
and 
item 
availability, providing improved transparency and 
efficiency for orders manipulation (i.e. information 
flow). The company also provides the proper 
capacity of equipments, labor and storage spaces to 
prevent operations bottlenecks and improve item 
flow. However, many supply chain and operational 
challenges has risen that prompted the company to 
think about applying different lean practices as 
noted in Table I. The lean practices represented in 
Table I have direct impacts on the distribution 
operations and can be quantitatively evaluated in 
terms of time and customer satisfaction. 
B. Lean Initiatives on TDC Company 
During this study, three of the illustrated lean 
initiatives in Table I are used in the proposed VSM 
framework. The selection process of these 
initiatives was based on a series of interviews, 
focus group and quality circle of the company‟s 
planning and operational teams and managers. The 
selected initiatives are: 
1. Aggregate 
similar 
tire 
types 
in 
the 
replenishment 
process: 
Receiving 
large 
quantity of similar tire types facilitates the 
unloading and put-away operation. It also 
results in an easier planning process for put-
away as similar types will be stored close 
together which in turn accelerate the picking 
and assembly process. The main drawback of 
this practice is that the replenishment order 
might take a longer time to be aggregated 
under this policy which consequently increases 
order cycle time. 
2. Evaluating staff numbers and increasing labor 
hour productivity: Low utilization of labor 
hours can be seen as an operational waste. 
Non-value adding time (also known as vertical 
time) where staff is still getting paid increases 
operational cost and cycle time. Reducing 
duplication of work, unnecessary staff and 
increased training can increase staff utilization.  
3. Increasing the maintenance services frequency 
for handling equipments: The breakdown of 
handling equipments negatively impacts on

After discussing the proposed lean practices in 
TDC, the implementation process of the VSM 
framework took place with the aid of the 
company‟s planning and operational staff. The 
framework (Fig. 1) was applied as follows: 
1. Determine the scope of the study 
Various processes are involved to manage 
TDC‟s value stream, starting  with receiving 
customer orders and ending with delivering the 
products to the end-customers. These processes 
include marketing, sales, finance, forecasting 
and planning, inbound and outbound operations 
and shipment. Lean principles can be employed 
to eliminate the waste and non-value added 
activities and isolate sources of variation from 
company entities – processes and parties –, 
however the scope of this paper will just focus 
on sales, planning and forecasting, internal 
operations and delivery processes in addition to 
the relationships between TDC and their 
customers and suppliers. This scope matches 
TDC points of interest and strategic goals.  
2. Mapping the system‟s current state using VSM 
approach 
The value stream of TDC is similar to the 
generic distribution value stream of any 
distribution center. The company has two main 
ways to receive orders (1) sales team and (2) 
online purchasing. This area will be discussed 
in more detail in Section IV.  
3. Collecting data concerning TDC processes and 
resources 
Three input variables are addressed in the 
VSM-framework; (1) operations processing 
times, (2) labors/staff hours and (3) equipment 
capacity (hours). Despite cost being an 
important 
dimension 
in 
the 
leanness 
measurement process; it was not included in the 
proposed model due to the confidentiality 
reasons. The data collection process has focused 
on three input variables by conducting series of 
interviews, focus groups, and quality circles of 
planning and operational teams in addition to 
observations of the operational activities in the 
distribution center. Historical data about arrival 
times of customer orders, the quantity of items 
in each order, the frequency and items 
quantities in the forecasting process, the 
breakdown rates of handling equipments and 
their repair time are also collected and 
statistically analyzed as a basic requirement for 
the simulation stage in the next step. 
4. Simulation model for current TDC state 
Creating a conceptual model focusing on the 
relationships between system‟s components (i.e. 
entities and resources) and illustrating their 
interactions is the first step towards developing 
a simulation model for the TDC. IDEF 
language is selected for building the TDC 
conceptual model where IDEF0 is used to 
model the upper level of the system illustrating 
the inputs, outputs, controls and utilized 
resources for the main functions. This will be 
discussed further in Section V. 
IV. 
VALUE STREAM MAPPING 
A value stream is defined as the collection of 
activities (value added and non-value added) that 
are operated to produce a product or service or a 
combination of both to a customer [15]. These 
actions consider both information and materials 
flow within the overall supply chain [16]. The logic 
behind lean thinking is pursuing the optimisation of 
the value streams from the consumption point of 
view by eliminating the waste and non-value added 
activities. In order to identify the sources of waste, 
non-value added activities and opportunities of 
improvement, value stream activities have to be 
mapped using systematic tools and techniques – 
value stream mapping technique [15]. The VSM 
technique 
demonstrates 
the 
material 
and 
information flow, maps out value-added and non-
value-added activities and provides information 
about 
time-based 
performance. 
This 
VSM 
technique is based on generating a current state 
map that shows the current performance and 
conditions of the studied systems and a future state 
map which serves as the target of improvement 
actions.  
Given VSM features and capabilities, the tool is 
utilized in the first stage of the framework seeking 
to map the distribution activities and the types of 
waste and non-value added actions that are 
embedded in them (Fig 2). Identifying a generic 
process structure for the distribution function is the 
initial step towards creating a generic distribution 
value stream map. A senior manager in TDC, with 
35 years operational experience in a variety of 
departments was interviewed to gather general 
information about distribution in TDC and the 
current shape of its supply chains and activities. 
The industry‟s current awareness of lean concepts 
and practices was also a key topic in the 
discussions and interviews. Meetings were also 
held with a number of supply chain and logistics 
professionals with the aim of determining the 
essential process structure in distribution sectors.  
Initial findings from these discussions led to 14 
standard operations in a distribution business, 
classified into three main categories, outlined in 
Table II. The operations have been modeled based 
on the standard operations in Table II yet modified 
to match TDC processes.

TABLE II.         DISTRIBUTION CENTER PROCESS CATEGORIES 
A set of processes usually starts  once 
replenished items are received. The physical flow 
(i.e. items flow) in this stage is combined with the 
information flow throughout the whole process 
starting from items unloading and classification 
from the received trucks and ended by loading 
customer 
trucks 
with 
the 
required 
orders. 
Information and physical flows are interacted in 
various locations in this path; in the storing process 
for instance the workers receive information of the 
storage locations that they should use to store the 
received products and items. Another interaction is 
observed when information of the items that need 
to be picked is passed to the picking and assembly 
staff to start the picking process. Various buffers 
are built up between some processes due to the 
variation in their completion times and labors 
capacity, for instance the buffers between picking, 
checking and truck loading processes. The 
associated data blocks for each process illustrated 
in the generic state map have shown three different 
input variables used to distinguish the value added 
and non-value added status of the modeled 
processes; total cycle time, number of process staff 
and resources availability rate (i.e. equipments and 
technology packages). 
VSM has a high quality way of presenting 
system‟s parameters such as operations‟ cycle time 
and resources capacity and availability; however it 
does not have the ability to analyze the system 
settings impact on performance. Similarly, it is also 
difficult to know if the best future state regarding to 
the desired level of system performance is 
achieved. Moreover, value stream maps do not 
include information regarding variability  (i.e. 
system variations and uncertainty) [17]. Hence, it is 
required to integrate VSM with another technique 
that can handle system‟s variation, show dynamics 
between system‟s components, and validate the 
future state before the real implementation of the 
improvement steps. Modeling and simulation 
capabilities can fulfill this requirement. The 
simulation capabilities will also be represented 
using the generic distribution structure and 
parameters mentioned above.

been published that simulation can be used to 
„master   Simulation offers more thorough analysis 
of a system‟s data including the examination of 
variability, the determination as to whether the data 
is homogenous, and the estimation of the 
probability distribution that fits the data patterns. 
This kind of in-depth analysis of data enables 
simulation to be used to support continuous 
improvement [4] and to model systems‟ future state 
map showing the ideal state that the system can 
pursued over time. The advantage of utilizing 
simulation approach in lean context is not limited 
to the phase of developing a future state map but is 
extended to selecting the best alternative to the 
current system status. This is not within the scope 
of this paper, but such selection is done by a 
carefully 
designed 
simulation 
experiments 
integrated with optimization tools such as Taguchi 
and response surface methods. 
Based on the simulation capabilities and the 
potential important role it can demonstrate in the 
leanness assessment process, a generic simulation 
model mimics distribution operations and displays 
the interaction between its components, will be 
associated to the aforementioned distribution VSM. 
The model represents the general structure of the 
distribution processes, operations rules, items flow 
and resources and is developed through two main 
phases; (1) creating the conceptual distribution 
model using Integrated Definition Language 
(IDEF0) (Fig. 3) and (2) using the discrete event 
simulation to mimic the general features of the 
distribution systems. 
A. Simulation Model 
The 
stochastic 
technique 
for 
discrete-event 
simulation is selected due to its capability of 
dealing with the uncertainty resulted by customer 
demand patterns, the variability in operations times 
and resources availability in addition to high 
variance in handling systems [20]. A computer 
simulation model based on the IDEF0 conceptual 
model shown in Figure 3 was developed. The 
model assumptions are (i) no returnable items are 
modeled (ii) the resources availability rates are 
based on data collected from managers and (iii) the 
model focuses on the generic features (Table II) of 
the distribution activities. The model uses entities 
to describe the items movement through the 
distribution center, while resources represent the 
handling equipments, tools and labor that modify 
the entities. Resources are characterized by their 
capacity and availability, whilst the attributes of the 
entities are arrival time and processing time. 
Logical entities simulate the decisions for creating, 
joining, splitting, buffering and branching entities. 
Each product type has its own information (i.e. 
level of inventory, safety stock level, forecasting 
range and its supplier). As previously mentioned, 
the original purpose of the model is to accurately 
assess the system‟s leanness by handling its 
variability and uncertainty as well as clearly 
estimating the system‟s future state after lean 
practices implementation. 
 
Both the current state VSM parameters and the 
future state VSM parameters will be simulated 
measuring the following performance indicators: 
1. Cycle Time 
2. Number of Late Jobs 
3. Labor Utilization 
The current state VSM has one scenario simulated; 
before lean implementation, which has no changes 
to current inputs. The future state VSM runs under

three different lean management scenarios as 
discussed in Section III. They are; aggregated 
orders, maintenance and labor resources. The 
process parameters included in the new scenarios 
are; truck load quantities, equipment downtime and 
number of staff respectively. 
 
For the model to reach its steady state 
condition, the warm-up period was found to be 48 
hours.  Every simulation run represents one month 
of actual timing. Each experiment result is an 
average of twelve independent replications 
The simulation model used to model the 
distribution processes has used a generic package 
of simulation and customized it using Java and 
XML technologies. This selection provides flexible 
and efficient simulation model for three reasons; 
(1) it helps to provide object-oriented hierarchical 
and 
event-driven 
simulation 
capabilities 
for 
modeling such large-scale application, (2) It 
utilizes 
breakthrough 
activity-based 
modeling 
paradigm (i.e. real world activities such as 
assembly, batching and branching), and finally (3) 
it also used to customize objects in the package to 
mimic the real-life application characteristics. 
In an effort to make the decisions taken based 
on simulation models more accurate, efficient 
methods of verification and validation are needed. 
For the verification process, in addition to 
decomposition model (i.e. to verify every group of 
blocks), a simulation software built-in debugger is 
used. A decomposition approach is effective in the 
detection of errors and insuring that every block 
functions as expected. The studied model has been 
validated using a „Face Validation‟ approach that 
was performed by interviewing managers and 
operations teams in order to validate the structure 
of the generic simulation model. 
VI. 
RESULTS ANALYSIS 
The uncertain nature of customer demands and 
suppliers‟ lead time makes it difficult to select the 
best system process parameters that can achieve 
high level of customer satisfaction (i.e. short cycle 
time and no late orders) while achieving the goals 
set out in the VSM.  The core theme throughout 
this paper was to measure the impact certain 
individual lean process parameters would have on 
the system before developing a future state VSM. 
The average results of each simulation run can be 
seen in Table III. 
Decreasing the aggregated orders by nearly 60% 
has had a significant impact on both cycle time and 
late jobs, decreasing by 13 days and 3.5 orders 
respectively, but not surprisingly has not improved 
labor utilization. Less time spent waiting to 
replenish orders decreases cycle time which in turn 
will decrease the chance of delivering orders late, 
although this may increase total costs as more 
orders will be shipped more frequently. On the 
other 
hand, 
management‟s 
suggestion 
that 
decreasing the probability of breakdowns through 
applying regular maintenance services in fixed 
intervals did not materialize, suggesting that 
equipment breakdowns do not have a significant 
impact on order fulfillment at present. If 
management implemented these measures using 
random estimates and experience alone, it would be 
a costly mistake to make. Scenario 3 decreased the 
number of labor hours needed to operate TDC by 
merging many similar activities such as printing 
picking notes and picking orders, and sales and 
customer approval activities. This achieved major 
economies in labor utilization, increasing by just 
below 70% and decreasing staff numbers by 2. 
Although cycle time did not change a great amount 
due to the fact that the same work was being 
achieved at the same rate, job lateness decreased by 
25%, suggesting the decreased staff numbers were 
more efficient within the same cycle time. Also, the 
decreased number of staff and increased labor hour 
productivity would have decreased operations costs 
and potentially decrease flow rates in the future.  
VII. CONCLUSION 
With 
ever 
increasing 
market 
pressure 
and 
competition, coupled with a global economic 
recession and high operating costs it has never been 
more prevalent for organizations to operate at an 
optimal level. In response, organizations have tried 
to become more efficient by decreasing costs and

streamlining operations. To achieve this, the 
philosophy of lean management has gained in 
popularity.  
Through in-depth industry research, it was 
found that the main obstacle organizations face 
when implementing lean is deciding which 
activities to implement lean principals on and to 
calculate how optimized their decisions are. A well 
known lean practice, value stream mapping, is a 
very effective tool in mapping the current and 
future state of an organizations lean activities. 
Limitations in calculating variability information 
that describe the system variations and uncertainty 
means more powerful analytical tools are needed.  
This paper highlights the potential of using 
simulation technologies in implementing lean 
practices.  Simulation offers a more thorough 
analysis of a system‟s data including the 
examination of variability and has the ability to 
change certain parameters and measure key lean 
performance indicators. Using TDC as an applied 
case study, this paper presents a framework that 
uses discrete event simulation as an integrative 
layer between current and future value stream 
mapping for lean management. The framework 
accounts for the current value and non-value 
activities in the company and through simulation 
have highlighted the activities that should be used 
when developing the future state map.  
This paper demonstrates how simulation can act 
as a catalyst layer in value stream mapping in order 
to provide a more accurate future state when lean 
implementation process is taken place.   
Potential future work with TDC on the 
framework will include the evaluation of the 
interaction between various future state VSM‟s 
using design of experiments integrated with 
optimization tools such as Taguchi and response 
surface methods. The application of the framework 
will also consider system dynamics modeling.
