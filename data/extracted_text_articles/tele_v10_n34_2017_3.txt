Abstract—Most telecom operators have to plan the migration
of their existing copper networks to full or hybrid ﬁbre networks,
to offer their clients the bandwidth they require. This paper
proposes methods to optimise this migration path, heteroge-
neously per central ofﬁce area, using geometric models as input.
The methods result in a detailed migration path that meets a
required bandwidth coverage, installation capacity and/or budget
constraint. To solve the optimisation problem in an efﬁcient way,
both a problem-based solution method and a simulated annealing
approach are tested for scalability of the problem solving. As
the data used for the migration path optimisation is in practice
hard to gather, the use of geometric modelling is proposed.
This modelling approach leads to the optimal migrating path,
estimating the total initial investment of a migration step using
only two simple parameters per Central Ofﬁce area.

I. INTRODUCTION
Broadband internet is becoming a common utility service.
Using connected electronic devices in and outside our homes,
we use more and more data and demand connectivity 24/7.
The used services are asking more bandwidth due to the
integration of video into numerous services. Most of the home
connections, access networks and systems offered by telecom
operators are not prepared for this, because incumbent oper-
ators mostly use copper telecommunication networks offering
ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) or VDSL (Very
High Bitrate Digital Subscriber Line) techniques as service .
Digital subscriber line (DSL) is a family of technologies used
to transmit digital data over copper lines. The operators have to
make the costly step to Fibre to the Cabinet (FttCab), Fibre to
the Curb (FttCurb) or, even more costly, the full step to Fibre
to the Home (FttH), Fibre near the home (FntH) or Fibre to
the Air (FttA). Bringing the network to the next step we call a
migration step, as introduced in [1]. An example of FntH and
FttA is a wireless home connection or a Hybrid ﬁbre-wireless
(FiWi) access network, where ﬁbre is brought to a location
near the homes, e.g., street lights [2], and the remaining
distance is covered by WiFi or WiMax [3] [4]. However, in
many countries, the roll out of all these ﬁbre connections will
take too long to compete with the cable TV operators active in
those countries, who can offer the required bandwidth using
DOCSIS, Data Over Cable Service Interface Speciﬁcation, on
their Hybrid Fibre Coaxial (HFC) networks at this moment.
This urges the operators to take intermediate steps, such as
FttCurb, and to think about the optimal migration strategy.
The incumbent telecom operators can choose between vari-
ous topology types to offer. In this paper, the term ‘topology’
is used for the way the physical ﬁbres and equipment are
designed. It comprises the question where to deploy ﬁbres,
where to deploy copper and where the active or passive
equipment should be placed. Each topology can run multiple
technologies. For example, in the ‘Full Copper’ topology,
the operator offers the services from the Central Ofﬁce. The
operator still can choose to offer ADSL or VDSL (containing
here all VDSL based technologies such as VDSL, VDSL2,
Vectored VDSL2, Vplus etcetera) technology for this service.
In this paper, four topology types are distinguished (see
Fig. 1):
1) Full Copper: services are offered from the Central Ofﬁce
(CO) over a copper (twisted pair) cable, using DSL
techniques.
2) Fibre to the Cabinet (FttCab): the ﬁbre connection is
extended to the cabinet. From the cabinet, the services
are offered over the copper cable, using DSL or G.Fast
techniques.
3) Hybrid Fibre to the Home (Hybrid FttH): services are
offered from a Hybrid FttH Node, which is connected by
ﬁbre, close to the customer premises, in the street, or in
the building. Here again, VDSL and G.Fast techniques
can be offered.
4) Full Fibre to the Home (Full FttH): the ﬁbre connection
is brought up to the customer premises.
If the operator starts with a Full Copper topology in a
certain area, he has to decide on the next step: bringing
the ﬁbre connection all the way to the customers or use an
intermediate step, where he brings the ﬁbre closer to the
customer, e.g., FttCab. Note that the operator can have a
heterogeneous network, where in different areas a different
topology is deployed and a different starting position for

migration is found. To make in a certain area the decision
mentioned before, the operator has to look at the pros and
cons of all the options. For example, the deployment of FttCab
can be much faster than Full FttH, as it requires less digging,
the last part of the connection from the street to the access
node in the house does not have to be installed, and it meets
the growing bandwidth demand for now and the near future.
If, in future, this demand exceeds the supplied bandwidth, the
remaining part to the residence can be connected with Full
Fibre or using Hybrid Fibre as extra intermediate step. If the
demand does not exceed the supplied bandwidth, for example,
it reaches some level of saturation, no further migration is
needed, saving a lot of investments. However, when Full FttH
is the expected ﬁnal solution, using intermediate steps would
incur investment and installation costs that might be lost and
not reused.
This decision can be made on strategic level, for a bigger
region or a whole country, or more tactical/operational within a
region. In this paper, the option that the operator can decide per
Central Ofﬁce area which topology or technology to offer is
considered. This means that the operator is offering broadband
as a service, instead of offering for example FttH as a service.
If an operator decides on the topology or technique per Central
Ofﬁce area and per period (e.g., year), he can develop a
detailed migration path that meets, for example, a bandwidth
coverage in a larger area. This option is called a heterogeneous
optimal migration path in contrast to a homogeneous optimal
migration path, where one migration path is used for all
Central Ofﬁce areas within the bigger region. This is the
ﬁrst part where the novelty of this paper is in. Up to now,
other papers only considered uniform migration paths or single
migration paths.
The second part where this paper is novel, is the data used
for the migration path optimisation. To estimate the costs of
a topology and the migration from one topology to another
topology, for each migration an optimal planning should be
made. We propose to solve this by using the geometric
modelling, as presented in [5] [6].
Concluding, in this paper, we present a methodology that
can be used by operators to design their heterogeneous topol-
ogy migration path from Full Copper to Full FttH, meeting
their business requirements. First, we start with a literature
survey on related models in Section II. In Section III, a
model is presented to optimise the heterogeneous migration
paths, where the complexity of the model is discussed in
Section IV. In Section V, a method is presented to gather
the input for the migration path optimisation using Geometric
models. In Section VI, solution methods are presented in
order to get a solution to the problem in reasonable time.
Next, in Section VII, the optimisation method is demonstrated
by a case study and the scalability of ﬁnding a solution is
shown by computational results. Finally, in Section VIII, some
conclusions are presented.
II. LITERATURE
Migration within telecommunication networks is a topic in
many Techno-Economical studies. In these studies, the eco-
nomic sanity of some choices are investigated. The European
projects IST-TONIC [7] and CELTIC-ECOSYS [8] resulted
in various upgrade or deployment scenarios for both ﬁxed and
wireless telecommunication networks, which was published
in [9] and [10]. A major question in these studies is when
to make the decision to roll out a FttC/VDSL network or a
Full FttH network. Based on demand forecasts, it was shown
that it is proﬁtable to start in dense urban areas, wait for ﬁve
years and then decide to expand it to the other urban areas.
With the use of real option valuation, the effect of waiting
is rewarded to identify the optimal decision over time. In
[11] and [12], the OASE approaches are presented for more
in depth analysis of the FttH total cost of ownership (TCO)
and for comparing different possible business models both
qualitatively and quantitatively.
The work of Casier [13] presents the techno-economic
aspects of a ﬁbre to the home network deployment. First,
he considers all aspects of a semi-urban roll-out in terms of
dimensioning and cost estimation models. Next, the effects of
competition are introduced into the analysis.
The work in [14] presents a multi-criteria model aimed
at studying the evolution scenarios to deploy new support-
ing technologies in the access network to deliver broadband
services to individuals and small enterprises. This model is
based on a state transition diagram, whose nodes characterise
a subscriber line in terms of service offerings and support-
ing technologies. This model was extended for studying the
evolution towards broadband services and create the optimal
path for broadband network migration. A similar kind of
model is presented in [15] and [16], where also an optimal
strategy is proposed using a dynamic migration model. They
study the best migration path including investments (capital
expenditures, CapEx) and operational expenditures (OpEx)
and revenues. Several ﬁxed access technologies are considered
as intermediate steps. A more recent study [17], proposes
several migration strategies for active optical networking from
data plane, topology, and control plane perspectives, and inves-
tigates their impact on the total cost of ownership. However,
these migration strategies are not optimised.

Finally, our own previous work was about the beneﬁts of
a migration path as alternative for the direct step from Full
Copper to FttH [18], and a Techno-Economic model [19] that
can calculate the effect on market share, revenues, costs and
earnings of offering different topologies and technologies in
access networks (in migration).
As said earlier, all these approaches only consider uniform
or single migration paths and do not include the possibility of
using geometric models as input.
III. MIGRATION MODEL
A
migration
path
is
here
deﬁned
as
a
path
from
one topology/technique combination to a destination topol-
ogy/technique, possibly using other topology/technique com-
binations as intermediate steps. Analogue to [15], we use a
ﬁgure to clarify the idea, see Fig. 2.
Figure 2. Migration paths.
Each node here is a topology/technique combination. One
can choose a path from node 1, typically Full Copper/ADSL,
to node S, typically FttH. So examples for the paths are: Full
Copper/ADSL to FttH, Full Copper/ADSL to FttCab/VDSL to
FttH, Full Copper/ADSL to FttCab/VDSL to FttCurb/G.Fast,
etcetera. The focus in this paper is on an area that consists of
multiple Central Ofﬁces, which is the location of the switching
equipment, to which subscriber home and business lines are
connected on a local loop, for example, a city or a district.
The goal of the operator is to offer in this district a certain
bandwidth coverage (per year), given a budget (per year) and
possibly other constraints. A bandwidth coverage can be a
single value, e.g., ‘I want to offer 100 Mb/s in 2017’, or a
distribution over various bandwidth values in a number of
years. An example of this distribution over years is presented
in Table I. In the table is stated that in 2018 (at least) 60%
of the houses need to have (at least) 100 Mb/s, at least 40%
of the houses need to have (at least) 200 Mb/s and (at least)
10% need (at least) 300Mb. The percentages do not add up to
100% as they are exceedance probabilities. If all houses have
a connection that offers 500 Mb/s the bandwidth coverage
demand is met, obviously.
Now, the problem can be deﬁned as an Integer Programming
Problem. The notation that is used is presented in Table II.
First, the objective function is deﬁned as:

This model will be called the base model. Constraint (2)
makes sure that there is at most 1 migration step per year
per location. Constraint (3) makes sure that each location
has exactly 1 topology each year. Constraint (4) creates the
migration steps. The right term can only be greater than zero
if (and only if) (yjlt − yjlt−1) = 1 and (yilt − yilt−1) = −1,
which indicates that there is a transition from technology i
to technology j. Constraint (5) makes sure that the required
bandwidth is delivered.
An alternative objective function is realised when adding the
operational cost, or OpEx. This alters the objective function

An other alternative model, called the extended model,
is the model in which there exists a budget constraint per
time period and a constraint for the installation capacity. In
this formulation, the budget constraints are hard and the gap
between the realised and demanded bandwidth per year is
minimised.

IV. COMPLEXITY
In this section, the complexity of the base model and the
extended model are discussed and it is shown that both models
are NP-hard.
A. Base model
The Single Source Capacitated Facility Location Problem
(SSCFLP) is NP-hard and can be reduced to the base model
of the Migration of Fibre problem. In this problem, a number
of facilities should be located, whereby each customer is fully
assigned to a facility at minimum cost, such that the demand
of each customer is served and a facility does not supply more
than his capacity. This can be described as follows [20]:

∀i ∈ Q, j ∈ J, (31)
where I is the set of customers, J is the set of facilities, Vij
are the costs for assigning customer i ∈ I to facility j ∈ J
and Fj are the costs for opening facility j ∈ J. Furthermore,
108

Ki is the demand of customer i ∈ I and Sj is the capacity
of location j ∈ J. It holds that variable xij is equal to 1 if
customer i ∈ I is assigned to facility j ∈ J. Otherwise, this
variable is equal to 0. The variable yj is equal to 1 if facility
j ∈ J is opened. Otherwise, this variable is equal to 0.
For the reduction of the SSCFLP to the base problem, ﬁrstly,
one instance of the base problem is given. Assume there is one
location l, one time period t ∈ T and one distance d ∈ D. By
this, the base problem can be reduced to:

∀ i = i0, j ∈ I.
(37)
Here, i0 denotes the start state, namely the combination i of
a technology and a topology at time t = 0. So, Yi is equal to
1 for i equal to the technology and topology combination at
time period t = 0 and zero otherwise. Note that Constraint (5)
does not force that xij = 1 for i = j when no migration takes
place. However, having xij = 1 for i = j does not affect the
objective function, because the migration costs for migrating
to the same technology and topology combination i are zero,
as there is actually no migration happening. As a result, we
can change Constraint (5) to:
xij ≥ Yi + yj − 1,
∀ i = i0, j ∈ I.
(38)
In this equation, it is forced that xij = 1 for i = j when no
migration takes place. We know that Yi0 = 1, because i0 is
the start state, thus Constraint (38) can be changed to:
xij ≥ yj,
∀ i = i0, j ∈ I.
(39)
In the base model, Constraint (33) has got an inequality sign
and not an equality sign due to the fact that there is no time
period t = −1 before the start state, so there is no migration
possible from t = −1 to t = 0, and thus, for the start state
t = 0 it holds that xijl0 = 0 for all i, j ∈ I and l ∈ L. In the
ILP described above, we only have one time period t ∈ T,
so we can change the inequality sign in Constraint (33) to an
equality sign:
X
j∈I
xij = 1,
∀ i = i0.
(40)
As a result of Constraint (34) and (40), we can ﬂip the
inequality sign in Constraint (38), because this does not affect
the relation between the yj and xi0j, which should be equal
to each other:
xij ≤ yj,
∀i = i0, j ∈ I.
(41)
From Constraint (34), we know that exactly one technology
and topology combination j ∈ I should be active in the
considered time period. We can replace this constraint by
adding the following part to the objective function:
X
j∈I
Ujyj,
(42)
where it holds that Uj = U for all j ∈ I and U > max
∀i,j∈I Cij.
As a result, the ILP becomes:
min

i=i0

(46)
xij, yi

{0, 1}
∀ i, j ∈ I.
(47)
From Constraint (44), (45) and the fact that only one tech-
nology and topology combination j ∈ I could be active, it
follows that we can remove the sum in Constraint (46), by
adding xi0j at the right side of the inequality sign. This is
because it must hold that the active technology and topology
combination j after migrating fulﬁls the bandwidth demand
G. This results in the following ILP:

The values Cij, Uj,
Rj
RT and Gi for all i, j ∈ I correspond
to the SSCFLP values Vij, Fj, Sj and Ki for all i ∈ Q and
j ∈ J, respectively. Moreover, i0 is the set of customers Q
and the set of facilities J is equal to the set I of technology
and topology combinations. This shows that the SSCFLP is a

special case of the base problem and leads to the conclusion
that the base problem is at least as hard as the SSCFLP. The
SSCFLP is NP-hard [20], and thus, the base problem is also
NP-hard.
B. Extended model
The Multiple Constraint Knapsack Problem is NP-hard and
can be reduced to the extended model of the Migration of
Fibre problem. In this problem, a set of items, each with
a weight and value, could be packed once into a knapsack.
The objective is to determine which item to include in the
knapsack, to maximise the total proﬁt and without exceeding
the knapsack constraints. This can be described as follows
[21]:

yi

∀i ∈ I, (55)
where the sets of items is given by set I and the set of knapsack
constraints is given by set M with corresponding capacities
Wj with j ∈ M. The required capacity of item i for knapsack
constraint j is Aji with j ∈ M, i ∈ I. The value of item i is
denoted by Pi and yi is equal to 1 if item i is in the knapsack
and otherwise this variable is equal to 0.
Similarly, for the reduction of the Multiple Constraint Knap-
sack problem to the extended problem, ﬁrstly, one instance of
the extended problem is given. Assume there is one location
l ∈ L, one time period t ∈ T and one distance d ∈ D. By
this, the extended model is reduced to:

Again, i0 denotes again the start state, namely the combination
i of a technology and a topology at time t = 0. The objective
function is a max-min function. However, it is possible to
modify the objective function to a maximisation function.
Since there is only one location, the objective function can
be changed to maximising the bandwidth for this location.
The new objective function is deﬁned as:
max

i∈I

RT · yi.
(63)
Furthermore, the amount of variables can be reduced. This is
possible, because there is only one location, one time period
and the start state is known. Therefore, xij can be replaced by
yi. As a result, Cij and Hij are respectively changed to Ci and
Hi, and Constraint (59) and (61) become superﬂuous. Without
loss of generality, the equality sign in Constraint (60) can be
changed to a “less than or equal to” sign, because the optimal
solution will never be yi = 0, for all i ∈ I, due to the used
objective function and positive values of
Ri
RT . Furthermore, it
holds that Ci = 0 and Hi = 0 for i ∈ I equal to the start
state. Summarising, the described instance of the Migration of
Fibre problem becomes:

The budget B, installation capacity IC and 1 correspond
to the knapsack capacities W1, W2 and W3, respectively. Fur-
thermore, Ci corresponds to A1i for all i ∈ I, Hi corresponds
to A2i for all i ∈ I, and A3i is equal to 1 for all i ∈ I.
Lastly, Ri
RT is equal to Pi for all i, thus the Multiple Constraint
Knapsack problem is a speciﬁc case of the extended problem.
This leads to the conclusion that the extended problem is at
least as hard as the Multiple Constraint Knapsack problem.
The Multiple Constraint Knapsack problem is NP-hard [21],
thus, the extended problem is also NP-hard.
V. INPUT FROM GEOMETRIC MODEL
In the previous section, two parameters are used that are
not that easy to obtain, namely cijl, the cost for migrating
from technology i to j at location l, and Rild, the number of
premises reached by technology i within d meter at location
l. To get the value of these parameters, for each migration
an optimal planning should be made. We introduce an alter-
native for this problem by using the outcomes of geometric
modelling, as presented in [5] and [6]. This means that we
start by a simple set of parameters per (currently) active node:
the total cable length (D) and the capacity of this node (n),
which equals the number of premises connected. Note that
in this section d and D mean something different, using the
notation of [6], than in the model of the previous sections. As
110
International Journal on Advances in Telecommunications, vol 10 no 3 & 4, year 2017, http://www.iariajournals.org/telecommunications/
2017, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org

is shown in [6], from these parameters the geometric density of
the premises can be derived. With this geometric density, we
can estimate the number of new active locations that a next
technology needs in this area to achieve a certain distance
coverage, and consequently, the bandwidth coverage. From
this number of active elements, the costs of the migration can
be estimated. Next, using the same density, also the cable and
digging distances to connect those new active elements can be
estimated.
To illustrate this approach, think of an area, currently
equipped with VDSL2, that contains n1 = 1, 000 houses.
The given total cable length equals D1 = 875, 000 meter.
Now, the parameter d, which indicates the house density of
the area, expressed in the (average) width of the premises,
can be derived by solving (using s1 = √n1):
d =
D1
2 · s1 · ⌈ 1
2s1⌉ · ⌊ 1
2s1⌋,
(69)
resulting in d = 57.7 for the given example. Let us assume that
in the next topology, let us assume V-plus, we want to reach
85% within 400 meters. From [5], we know that the probability
distribution of the individual distances of the houses to the
active node can be estimated by a Normal distribution Fµ,σ(x)
with µ2 =
D2
n2 and σ2 =
M−µ
2
. Here M represents the
maximum cable distance in the second topology using [6]:
M = 2 · ⌈1
2s2 − 1⌉ · d + 0.5d,
(70)
s2 = √n2,
(71)
and the total cable length in the second topology
D2 = 2 · d · s2 · ⌈1
2s2⌉ · ⌊1
2s2⌋.
(72)
Now,
the
question
is
to
choose
n2
such
that
Fµ(n2),σ(n2)(400) = 0.85. This can be solved numerically
and leads to the following values: n2 = 100, M2 = 490,
D2 = 28800, µ2 = 290 and σ2 = 100. This means that to
meet this requirement of 85% within 400 meter, 10 new
nodes (n1/n2) should be installed. It takes 28800 meter of
digging and (ﬁbre) cable to connect these nodes.
VI. SOLUTION METHODS
The time to solve the Migration problem has to be of a
reasonable magnitude, regardless of the input of the model.
The reason for this is that the telecom operators should be
able to run the optimisation model in a few minutes, such that
the model can be used in an interactive way. After obtaining
a migration plan, the company has to consider whether the
migration plan is enforceable. If it is not a feasible plan, they
should be able to modify input or requirements and create a
new migration plan. Furthermore, in Section IV, it is shown
that the Migration of Fibre problem is NP-hard. For these
two reasons, heuristic methods are developed to obtain a good
solution within an acceptable computation time. A heuristic
method is a procedure that is likely to discover a good and
feasible solution, but not necessarily an optimal solution. In
this chapter, we present the different heuristic solution methods
used in this research. The third solution method which is
developed, is the optimisation of the base problem and the
extended problem per year. Next to these heuristic approaches,
the exact solution method is used to create benchmark values.
A. Problem-based heuristic
The ﬁrst method we used to obtain an good solution in a
reasonable computation time, is a heuristic method which is
based on the characteristics of the Migration of Fibre problem.
The main characteristics of the base problem is the requested
bandwidth percentage and the two main characteristics of
the extended problem are the budget and the installation
capacities. The heuristic starts with a solution in which the
technology and topology combination in each year is equal to
the start year, i.e., the current situation. The heuristic starts at
the ﬁrst year that has to be upgraded and upgrades the locations
with the largest proﬁt. When enough locations are upgraded to
meet the constraints for that year, the heuristic continues with
the same procedure for the next years. After this, a feasible
solution is constructed. In this way, the quality of the solution
is guaranteed. Next, we explain how this is implemented for
the base and extended problems.
For the implementation of the problem-based heuristic, we
distinguish the base problem and the extended problem. For
both the problems a total proﬁt matrix is made. For the base
problem, the proﬁt is based on the following ratio:
Rjl
Cijl
,
(73)
where Rjl is the matrix containing the mean values over all
the distances d ∈ D. For the extended problem, the proﬁt is
based on the following ratio:
Rjl
Cijl
Bt + Hijl
ICt
.
(74)
By dividing Cijl and Hijl respectively by Bt and ICt,
the inﬂuence of the migration costs and required installation
capacities are equivalent. Moreover, the proﬁt matrix shows
for each possible upgrade per location what the corresponding
proﬁt ratio is per year. After this matrix is made, the following
steps are performed:
1) Construct a migration schedule in which the technology
and topology combinations in each time period are equal
to the start time period, i.e., there are no migration
upgrades in this schedule.
2) Select the lowest time period t ∈ T which has not been
upgraded yet and which has to be upgraded (base model:
requested bandwidth constraint) or which could be up-
graded (extended model: there is budget and installation
capacity left over).
3) Using the total proﬁt matrix, a proﬁt matrix is made
for the current situation. This is a matrix containing
111

the proﬁts for the selected time period t ∈ T and
the technology and topology combination i ∈ I of the
previous time period (t − 1) ∈ T.
4) The upgrade with the highest ratio in the matrix, made
in the previous step, is selected and is carried out in the
migration schedule. Also the subsequent time periods of
this location get the same upgrade.
5a. (Base model) Repeat step 4. until the migration sched-
ule for the selected time period meets the required
bandwidth constraint. For the base problem, this is the
bandwidth constraint, and in this way, the migration
schedule up to the selected time period has became a
feasible schedule.
5b. (Extended model) Repeat step 4. until as much locations
as possible are upgraded and the solution still meets the
budget and installation capacity constraint. In this way,
the migration schedule is still a feasible schedule.
6a (Base model) Repeat step 2 until 5, until every time
period t ∈ T is upgraded as much as needed, and then,
the migration schedule feasible.
6b (Extended model) Repeat step 2 until 5, until every time
period t ∈ T is upgraded as much as possible, without
losing feasibility.
Note that the two last steps of the problem based heuristic
are dependent of the type of the model, i.e., the base or
extended model. Next to the model-based heuristic, we have
also used a meta-heuristic, which is described in the next
section.
B. Simulated Annealing
The meta-heuristic used in this research is Simulated An-
nealing (SA). A meta-heuristic is a general solution method
that provides general structures and strategy guidelines for
developing a speciﬁc heuristic method. SA is a stochastic
algorithm which searches for a global optimum and avoids
getting stuck in local, non-global optima [22]. It is based on a
heating and cooling process and simulates the energy changes
in a system subjected to a cooling process until it converges
to an equilibrium state.
From an initial solution s0, the SA algorithm generates a
random neighbour during each iteration. A neighbour is a
(feasible) solution obtained by performing an operation on
the current solution. If this neighbour is a better solution than
the current solution, related to the corresponding values of the
objective function, the neighbour solution will be accepted and
becomes the new current solution. If this is not the case, the
neighbour will be accepted with a certain probability, which
depends on the current temperature. This probability is the
Boltzmann probability:
P(acceptance) = e− |f(s′)−f(s)|
T
,
(75)
where |f(s′) − f(s)| denotes the difference ∆E between the
objective value of the generated neighbour s′ and the objective
value of the current state s. T denotes the temperature.
During each Mmax iterations of the algorithm, the temper-
ature T decreases, whereby the probability of acceptance
also decreases. The probability of acceptance also depends
on the quality of the neighbour solution, i.e., the worse the
neighbour solution, the lower the chance of acceptance. A
cooling schedule g(T) deﬁnes for each step r of the algorithm
the temperature Tr. Due to the possibility of accepting worse
solutions, the algorithm can escape an inferior local minimum.
The algorithm stops after a predeﬁned amount of iterations
Nmax. The overview in Algorithm 1 summarises the used
steps based on [23].

N = N + 1
end
T = g(T);
end
Output: Saved solutions s′ and corresponding objective
values f(s′)
The ﬁrst step of our implementation of SA is to gain
a good initial solution. To create an initial solution, the
Problem-Based Heuristic as described in Section VI-A is
used. Solutions are presented as a matrix of which the rows
illustrate the locations, the columns represent the migrations
years and the elements of the matrix represent the technology
and topology combination for the corresponding location and
year. The technology and topology combinations are ranged
from 1 until k, with k the total amount of combinations.
Furthermore, combination 1 provides the smallest bandwidth
and combination k provides the largest bandwidth.
The objective function for a solution s of the base model is

The goal of Simulated Annealing is to ﬁnd a solution with
the lowest possible objective value. Simulated Annealing also
needs a temperature scheme. This scheme deﬁnes for each
step of the algorithm the temperature T. First, we set an initial
temperature T and we deﬁne the cooling schedule as:
g(T) = αT , with 0 < α < 1.
(78)
We apply this scheme after each βth iteration. Previous
research showed that α should be between 0.5 and 0.99
[23]. The stop condition is deﬁned as that the algorithm will
stop after γ amount of iterations. In each iteration of the
algorithm, a neighbourhood solution will be created, using the
current solution. There are three operations possible to create
a feasible neighbour solution. First, choose a random number.
If the selected number is smaller than 1
3, then operation 1 is
performed, if the number is smaller than 2
3 and bigger than
1
3, then operation 2 is performed and otherwise, operation 3
is performed. By operation 1, a location is upgraded in a
time period and, if possible, an other location is downgraded
in the same time period. By operation 2, a location will be
upgraded in a timed period and by operation 3, a location will
be downgraded in a time period. The operations are speciﬁed
as follows:
1) A location is randomly chosen. If the selected location
contains already the best possible technology and topol-
ogy combination in each migration time period, reselect
the location randomly, until upgrading in at least one of
the migration time periods of this location is possible.
Then select a migration time period randomly, where
upgrading the technology and topology combination
for this location is possible and upgrade the selected
location for the selected time period. With upgrading a
network, we mean that we add 1 to the corresponding
entry in the solution matrix. If needed, some of the
following time periods for this location should also be
increased by 1, such that the migration steps for the
location form a row of non-descending entries.
If it is possible to downgrade an other location in the
selected time period, select randomly an other location
and check if it is possible to downgrade this location in
the selected time period. With downgrading a network,
we mean that we subtract 1 from the corresponding en-
try. If the technology and topology combination for this
location and time period is already as low as possible,
then reselect the location randomly. This is repeated until
a location is found where a downgrade is still possible
in the selected time period and then the location in this
time period is downgraded. In addition, if needed, some
of the previous time periods for this location should be
decreased by 1, such that the migration steps for the
location form a row of non-descending entries. If it is not
possible to downgrade an other location in the selected
time period, no additional steps are performed.
2) A location is randomly chosen. If the selected location
contains already the best possible technology and topol-
ogy combination in each migration time period, reselect
the location randomly, until upgrading in at least one of
the migration time periods of this location is possible.
Then, select a migration time period randomly, where
upgrading the technology and topology combination
for this location is possible and upgrade the selected
location for the selected time period. With upgrading a
network, we mean that we add 1 to the corresponding
entry in the solution matrix. If needed, some of the
following time periods for this location should also be
increased by 1, such that the migration steps for the
location form a row of non-descending entries.
3) A location is randomly chosen. If the selected loca-
tion contains already the worst possible technology and
topology combination in each migration time period,
reselect the location randomly, until downgrading in at
least one of the migration time periods of this location
is possible. Then, select a migration time period ran-
domly, where downgrading the technology and topology
combination for this location is possible and downgrade
the selected location for the selected time period. With
downgrading a network, we mean that we subtract 1
from the corresponding entry in the solution matrix. If
needed, some of the previous time periods for this loca-
tion should be decreased by 1, such that the migration
steps for the location form a row of non-descending
entries.
For the extended problem, we added a small extension to
operation 2 and 3, to increase the chance of creating a solution
which is feasible:
2. Check the feasibility of the adapted solution. If it is
infeasible, i.e., it does not meet the budget and/or instal-
lation capacity constraint, then also perform operation 3
in the selected time period. In this case, a location is
upgraded and an other location is downgraded in the
same time period.
3. Check the feasibility of the adapted solution. After
operation 3 is performed, i.e., a location is downgraded
in a time period, it is possible that the costs for the
next time period becomes higher and exceeds the budget
for this next time period. If the created neighbour
solution is infeasible, i.e., it does not meet the budget
and/or installation capacity constraint, then also perform
operation 2 in the selected time period. In this case, a
location is upgraded and an other location is downgraded

in the same time period.
For the base problem, check if the new solution is feasible,
i.e., it meets the bandwidth constraint. For the extended
problem, if an extension of operation 2 or 3 is performed,
also a check has to be performed: it is checked whether
or not the new solution meets the budget and installation
capacity constraints. If it does not meet these constraints,
the adapted solution is rejected and the procedure of the
operation is started again, using the unadapted solution. This is
repeated until a solution is found which meets the constraints.
We call this adapted solution a neighbour. All the solutions
which can be formed by using one of the operations to adapt
the current solution, form the neighbourhood of the current
solution. Additionally, during each iteration, the neighbour will
be compared with the current solution. It will be accepted if
it is better than the current solution and otherwise it will be
accepted with the Boltzmann probability.
VII. COMPUTATIONAL RESULTS
We tested all methods described in the previous section,
using the base model and extended model for various test
instances. In this section, the results of these methods are
presented. First of all, the impact of optimising per year instead
of optimising over the total horizon is showed in an example.
Next, the heuristics described in section VI are compared to
each other, subjected to the accuracy and the computation time
of these heuristics for various test instances.
A. Example
First, in this section, an example is presented introducing
a small city with 40 cabinets and 18,550 houses, to show the
beneﬁt of the optimisation over the total horizon. The current
employment is ADSL. The operator has a bandwidth coverage
goal, expressed in percentage of the houses that is within a
certain distance from the active equipment. The coverage goal
is shown in Table III. For example, the goal is to have 70%
of the houses within 400 meter in 2021.

Two cases are distinguished. In the ﬁrst case, the operator
tries to meet the distance requirement for each year indepen-
dently and optimally. This means that the operator optimises
the design of each area without knowledge of future networks,
topologies and technologies. In the second case, the operator
tries to meet the requirements for the total time horizon, by
solving the ILP model introduced in Section III. For each
cabinet, for each 3-year period, the operator can chose between
doing nothing, implementing VDSL and implementing V-plus,
each with its own costs and bandwidth consequences. Now,
the operator tries to make the decisions such that the total
migration costs are minimal, meeting the distance coverage
requirements for each period as modelled in the base model
of Section III. The used costs for digging and equipment are
based on the (Sub-Urban) numbers of [24].
Figure 3. Investment costs.
The result of the optimisation (only using Excel and Open-
Solver [25]) of the two cases is depicted in Table IV for the
per-period optimisation and Table V for the overall optimisa-
tion. In the ﬁrst year (2018) of the per-period optimisation,
more VDSL is chosen, as this is a cheaper solution to meet
the 2018 requirements. In the overall optimisation the more
expensive choice for V-plus is made, as this is more ready
for the future. In the other two stages more or less the same
choices are made. This leads to the total overview of costs
as depicted in Fig. 3, where the total costs of the overall
optimisation are lower, but the costs in the ﬁrst year are higher.
All costs are expressed in Net Present Value, with an average
cost of capital of 6%, making the values in the various years
comparable.
B. Scalability
To illustrate the scalability of the problem solving, ﬁve real
life areas containing different amounts of cabinets and houses
are selected. The time-span of the migration schedule and
the amount of possible technology and topology combinations
is the same as in the previous example, respectively three
moments in time and three combinations. In Table VI, an
overview is given of the characteristics of the areas.

The scalability of the base model and extended model is
based on the quality of the optimal solution found by the
different solutions methods and the corresponding computation
times of these methods. To determine the quality of the
provided solution of the methods, ﬁrst the exact solutions of
the base model and extended model for the different areas
are calculated. For this, three different solvers are used. The
ﬁrst used solver is ‘OpenSolver’ in Excel, in combination with
COIN-OR [25]. Furthermore, CPLEX Optimizer [26] in com-
bination with MATLAB and the standard solver IntLinProg in
MATLAB are used. In Table VII, an overview is given of the
computation times using these solvers for the base problem.

The illustrated computation times of the solvers are a
combination of the time for building the problem and solving
the problem using these solvers. Observe that the NP-hardness
of the base model, effects the computation time for area
E, using CPLEX Optimizer. This computation time is larger
than three hours, which is not an reasonable duration for the
telecom operators to obtain a migration schedule. In practise,
even more technology and combinations and more migrations
periods will be involved, which results in an exponential
growing runtime for obtaining an exact solution. In Table VIII,
an overview is given of the computation times for extended
model using CPLEX Optimizer. This table also shows that the
computation time for obtaining a migration schedule for large
areas is not acceptable, given the assumptions in the start of
this section.
Therefore, to obtain a good solution in a reasonable time,
solution methods were developed, as shown in Section VI.
These methods are the Problem-based heuristic and Simu-
lated Annealing approaches and, additionally, a per period
optimisation, calculating the optimal exact solution per year,
sequentially. Simulated Annealing uses the solution of the
problem-based heuristic as start solution. The parameters used
to simulate the cooling process, based on preliminary results,
are illustrated in Table IX for the base model and the extended
model.

Preliminary results show that the size of the areas has
no effect on the selection of parameters, meaning that the
best parameters is only based on the type of model. Now,
the solutions of the three methods can be compared with
the optimal solution found by CPLEX Optimizer. This is
illustrated in Table X for the base model and in Table XI
for the extended model.

Table X shows that the solution for the base problem in
area A, using Simulated Annealing, is 2.6% worse than the
exact optimal solution, as found by CPLEX Optimizer. This
means that the costs for the migration schedule as found by
Simulated Annealing is 2.6% higher than the costs for the
migration schedule of the exact solution, as found by CPLEX
Optimizer. Table XI shows that the solution for the extended
problem in area A, using the problem-based heuristic, has a
total realisation of 54.57% of the total realised bandwidth
demand of the exact optimal solution, as found by CPLEX
Optimizer. Moreover, the 100% of the exact solution is equal
to the sum over the minima of the demanded bandwidth and
the realised bandwidth per year and distance. Furthermore,
these two tables show that the improvement using Simulated
Annealing is signiﬁcantly more effective for the extended
model. However, the optimal solutions of Simulated Annealing
for both the models are not as good as the optimal solutions
of the per period optimisation.
The corresponding computation times of the methods are
illustrated in Table XII and Table XIII. Note that the compu-
tation time of Simulated Annealing includes the computation
time of the problem-based heuristic.

Table XII and Table XIII show that the computation time
of the problem-based heuristic is the lowest, however, the
computation time of the two other methods are also of a
reasonable duration. To conclude, combining this with the
previous results that the solution of the per year optimisation is
signiﬁcantly better than the solution provided by the problem-
based heuristic, the best method to provide a good solution
in a reasonable time for the extended model, is the approach
of optimising per year. For the base model, this approach can
give rather high deviations. Then, for smaller areas, at this
moment, the exact solver should be considered.
VIII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented a methodology that can be used
by operators to design their heterogeneous topology migration
path from Full Copper to (Full) FttH, meeting their business
requirements. Heterogeneous means that the operator decides
per Central Ofﬁce area the topology or technique per period
(e.g., year), resulting in a detailed migration path that meets a
required bandwidth coverage in the larger area. For this, two
models were presented. The ﬁrst, the base problem, minimised
the total investment (CapEx) and operational costs (OpEx),
such that the bandwidth requirement per period was met. The
second, the extended problem, minimised the deviation from
this bandwidth requirement meeting a budget constraint per
period.
The data used for the migration path optimisation is in prac-
tice hard to obtain. For this, the use of geometric modelling
was proposed, with which the total CapEx of a migration
step can be estimated using only two parameters per Central
Ofﬁce area, namely the total existing cable length and the
capacity of this node. The two models were demonstrated in
two case studies that showed the gain that can be realised by
the migration path optimisation.
To be used in practice, solving bigger instances, two
heuristic methods were presented, next to the option to solve
the problem per year. Numerical experiments show that an
exact optimal solution can be obtained by MIP-solver CPLEX
Optimizer up to rather big problems. If for bigger problems
the calculation time of the exact solution is experienced to
high, a consecutive approach of optimising per year gives the
best performance of the heuristic approaches, in the case of
the extended problem.
For further research we recommend to look for better
performing problem-based heuristics, as we expect them to
deliver the best computation times. Furthermore, beside the
costs, also the revenues could be taken into account.
