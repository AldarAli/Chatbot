Abstract— Computational Electromagnetics is a discipline 
that deals with the processing and modeling of multi-physics 
and electromagnetic problems. Thanks to the advent of 
computers and numerical methods, engineers today can 
develop algorithms and software to solve Maxwell’s equations 
numerically. The electromagnetic scattering problem leads to 
a very large system of equations with millions or even billions 
of unknowns; traditional data analysis methods are 
oftentimes not efficient enough to handle the problem due to 
data volume. The field of Big Data has emerged from the need 
to process a massive amount of data and is a research area 
that facilitates the complex work of extremely large data sizes. 
Fast algorithms can be developed to efficiently manage the 
Big Data approach to support areas of science and 
engineering. In this paper, we explore an application of Big 
Data and algorithms in computational electromagnetics 
scattering problems.  
Keywords—Big

I. INTRODUCTION 
 
We are currently in an era of digital information. This 
means that a great amount of information is generated daily. 
To manage, analyze and store this information, very 
powerful tools are needed. Big Data technology plays a very 
important role in this area. It allows large companies to 
optimize decision-making and obtain results optimally. Big 
Data is a term used to describe a set of data or combinations 
of sets of data whose size, complexity, and velocity of 
growth make it difficult to capture, manage, process or 
analyze using conventional technologies and tools, such as 
relational databases and conventional statistics or 
visualization package, within the time necessary for them to 
be useful [1]. Although there is no firmly defined size for 
determining whether a data set is Big Data, and the 
definition continues to change over time, professionals 
currently refer to Big Data to be datasets ranging from 30-
50 Terabytes to several Petabytes [1]. 
For some problems, the data size may be so large that it 
does not fit in the main memory of a single machine. The 
need to process such a huge amount of data There is a need 
to process such a huge amount of data through efficient 
algorithms 
in 
machine 
learning, 
network 
traffic 
monitoring, scientific computing, signal processing, and 
other areas. Some well-known examples of such algorithms 
are numerical linear algebra algorithms for big matrices [2] 
(regression, low-rank approximation, matrix completion), 
dimensional reduction for reducing data dimension to 
conserve the geometric structure [3], compressed sensing 
for approximation recovery of sparse signals [4] and sparse 
Fourier Transform as fast algorithms for signals calculation 
in a frequency domain [5]. To better understand Big Data's 
difficulty, it is often broken down using five V’s: Volume, 
Velocity, Value, Variety, and Veracity [8][9]. 
 
 
Figure 1. The 5 V’s of Big Data. 
 
The 5 V’s of Big Data illustrated in Figure 1 can be 
defined as follows: 
• 
Volume refers to the exponential increase in data 
resulting from new technologies, and the ease of 
generating digital data is a palpable reality. The 
volume means large size. 
• 
Velocity is the rate of growth and how fast data is 
gathered for analysis.  
• 
Value is indicative of substantial value, including 
the ability to understand the target better, 
accordingly, and optimize performance.  
• 
Variety is information about the various types of 
data, such as structured, unstructured, semi-
structured, etc.  
• 
Veracity means the confidence established about 
the data to be used. 
 
Big Data serves the purpose of converting data 
(information) into knowledge. Researchers have added 
more dimensions from 5 to 10 [6], covering terms such as 
validity, vulnerability, volatility, visualization, variability, 
and even more, which can be found in technology and data

generation advances [7]. The rest of this paper is organized 
as 
follows: 
Section 
II 
describes 
Computational 
Electromagnetic (CEM) as an interdisciplinary field, 
Section III describes the Method of Moments (MoM) as a 
powerful numerical technique in CEM, Section IV 
addresses the algorithm techniques to exploit MoM, Section 
V describes the multilevel fast multipole algorithm and 
Section VI summarize some Big Data techniques 
implemented to solve different electromagnetic engineering 
problems. The conclusions close the article.  
II. COMPUTATIONAL ELECTROMAGNETIC 
Electromagnetic (EM) analysis is a discipline that 
solves 
Maxwell’s 
equations 
to 
obtain 
a 
better 
understanding of complex systems. The advent of 
numerical methods and computers has changed the 
traditional ways of EM analyzing, and a field called 
Computational Electromagnetics has emerged [10]. It is a 
prominent EM research area that involves the modeling of 
the interaction of EM fields with physical objects, the study 
of electromagnetic compatibility between equipment in 
different environments, the design of antennas, the design 
of passive microwave circuits and components, the 
calculation of the Radar Cross Section (RCS) and Inverse 
Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) images, the analysis of 
antennas embarked on complex structures, Doppler 
analysis, and radio propagation both indoors and outdoors. 
When an EM problem is given for a practical 
application, 
we 
need 
to 
describe 
our 
problem 
mathematically based on EM physics to seek a numerical 
method. We can apply Partial Differential Equations 
(PDEs) and boundary conditions to define an equivalent 
boundary-value problem. Then, from our mathematical 
formulation, we can develop a numerical method 
effectively, and depending on the problem, we will need to 
decide to use an existing method or develop a new one 
addressing the problem. After a numerical method is 
selected or developed, it is necessary to develop an efficient 
computer program for implementation. Finally, after the 
computer program is validated, we can use it to solve the 
problem given by constructing a geometrical model and the 
specification of EM mediums (permittivity, permeability, 
and conductivity) [11]. All the steps previously discussed 
are summarized in Figure 2.

As shown in Figure 3, CEM is a highly interdisciplinary 
field that combines physics, mathematics, and computer 
science to advance engineering applications. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3. CEM is an interdisciplinary field for advancing engineering 
applications. 
 
Today, numerical methods for EM scattering problems 
need to process a very large system of equations with 
millions or even billions of unknown variables [12]. 
Traditional methods are inefficient and fast algorithms in 
EM have been developed to solve this problem in an 
efficient manner [10]. As a common method, we can 
represent our system of unknowns as a hierarchical 
representation with a matrix system of N number of 
unknowns. Fast algorithms use O(NlogN) memory and 
approximately O(N) or even O(logN) time [12]. Traditional 
numerical methods usually require O(𝑁2) memory and 
O(𝑁2) time so in the scenario that N becomes very large, 
we can identify a huge discrepancy in memory and time 
between traditional and fast algorithms [10].  
The next section describes an efficient algorithm for 
electromagnetic 
scattering 
problems 
that 
can 
be 
implemented in multicore-based and cluster architectures. 
Electromagnetics simulations are critically important in 
several application areas, such as antenna design for 
aircraft, satellites, and medical devices. We can reduce the 
numerical formulation cost by assuming time-harmonic 
solutions and reformulating Maxwell’s equations to 
describe EM waves in terms of surface currents. The result 
of this approach is a numerical problem that can be solved 
on the surface of the object being studied.  
III. METHOD OF MOMENTS  
The method of moments is a very powerful numerical 
technique developed for solving complex EM problems. 
Compared to the Finite Element Methods (FEM), MoM 
also transforms the boundary-value problem into a matrix 
equation that can be solved on computers [13]. 
Mathematical-based MoM was proposed almost one 
century ago, but its applications did not arise until 1960s 
[14]. Today, it is one of the most important methods in 
CEM. MoM has been well studied on open-region 
electromagnetic problems, such as wave scattering and 
antenna radiation, and it is very efficient for problems 
involving either impenetrable or homogeneous objects 
[13]. Also, the capability of MoM has been improved by 
the development of fast algorithms that can deal with huge 
MoM matrix equations [12]. MoM forces the boundary 
conditions to be satisfied in an average sense over the entire 
surface.

We can see a system of equations to compute the 
surface currents as an inverse problem. Applying an 
iterative method, the inverse problem is converted to 
repeated solutions of the forward problem. For example, a 
basic problem in EM consists of computing an EM field, 
given the distribution of sources/charges. The forward 
model is well known to compute electrostatic potential  
Φ = ∑ 𝐾(𝑥,
𝑁
𝑗=1
𝑥𝑗) 𝑞𝑗 
where 𝑞𝑗 is the point charge at the location represented by 
𝑥𝑗.The interaction between the field points and the charges 
is represented by the kernel 𝐾(𝑥, 𝑥𝑗) which is logarithmic 
in two dimensions and proportional to the inverse distance 
in three dimensions. 
The corresponding scattering problem computes 
electric and magnetic fields E and H generated by surface 
currents on metallic objects, such as aircraft [21]. Avoiding 
its mathematical derivation, a simplified form is given by  
𝐸(𝑟) = ∫
𝐺(𝑟, 𝑟′)𝑗(𝑟′)                                                       
𝜕𝛺
+ 1
𝑘2  𝛻 (𝐺(𝑟, 𝑟′ )𝛻 ⋅ 𝑗(𝑟′) 𝑑𝑟′ 
where ∂Ω is the surface of the object, and for computer 
simulation, it is discretized, r is a point in the space and 
𝐺(𝑟, 𝑟′) is the Green’s function representing a point source 
response [21]. Figure 4 shows a visualization of an example 
of a discretized unit sphere.  To make this type of problem 
solvable by computers, we need to discretize the object in 
N number of pieces. We can represent the sources and 
fields of the surface current by a set of basis functions and 
corresponding coefficients to approximate the solution of 
the surface current [19]. After the discretization, we 
convert the problem to a matrix equation by intruding on 
another set of functions called testing or weighing functions 
[19].  
 
It can be expressed in a compact form as 
∑ 𝑍𝑖𝑗𝐼𝑗 =
𝑁
𝑗=1
𝑉𝑖       𝑖 = 1,2,3 … 𝑁 
where 𝑍𝑖𝑗 is the N x N matrix system with the unknown 
coefficients, 𝐼𝑗 is the vector of unknowns, and 𝑉𝑖  is the 
source vector. 
 
IV. FAST ALGORITHMS 
Unlike FEM based on PDEs that yield to huge sparse 
matrix system, the method of moments, MoM, based on 
integral equations (IEs), produces a fully populated matrix 
system because of the applications of the Green’s function. 
Now, the problem is the high complexity associated with 
methods for the full matrix solution. It becomes a limitation 
on the capability of MoM. In conventional methods for 
matrix solutions, such as Gaussian elimination or lower-
upper (LU) decomposition, the time complexity is O(𝑁3) 
and the space complexity is O(𝑁2), where N is the matrix 
dimension. An iterative method can reduce the time 
complexity to O(𝑁2), but the memory remains the same for 
a direct method. The total time complexity is O(Niter 𝑁2) 
where Niter is the number of iterations reaching a certain 
convergence. If Niter is small, then an interactive process 
will be faster than LU decomposition just for the right-hand 
side of the equation, but the iterative solution must be 
repeated for every right-hand size [15][20], which makes 
MoM limited to one-, two- or three-dimensional problems. 
A better understanding of the high computational 
complexity of traditional direct and interactive methods 
can be found in [15]. The complexities of O(𝑁3)and O(𝑁2) 
make the time and space increase dramatically with the 
increase of the number N, and it may exceed the capabilities 
computers have today. A technique used to reduce time and 
memory complexities for iterative methods, especially for 
large-scale problems, is called fast algorithms. We can 
broadly define fast algorithms as algorithms that can solve 
both matrix and integral equations that can be discretized 
in a matrix equation by MoM. More details regarding fast 
algorithms can be found in [10][14][15]. Some examples of 
fast algorithms are the Conjugate Gradient–FFT (CG-FFT) 
method, the Adaptive Integral Method (AIM), the Fast 
Multipole Method (FMM), and the Adaptive Cross-
Approximation (ACA) method. 
For this survey, we focus on FMM because it is the 
base for the technique presented in the next section of this 
paper. FMM divides the current elements into groups by 
their physical locations in space. A group is then defined as 
a collection of current elements near each other. Figure 5 
illustrates an example of an arbitrary object with basis 
functions divided into groups, so the computation of far 
fields that is calculated indirectly in multiples steps is made 
fast, whereas near fields are computed directly (more 
quickly). 
FMM integrates a new concept of decomposing the 
MoM matrix into near-and-far-interaction components. It 
makes a fast matrix-vector calculation possible by

multipole or plane wave expansions and eventually reduces 
the computational complexity to O(NlogN) [18]. 
V. MULTILEVEL FAST MULTIPOLE ALGORITHM 
For a problem with N unknowns, we can divide them 
into N/M groups. For near-fields interactions, aggregations, 
and disaggregation, O(NM) operations are required, 
whereas the calculation of translation requires O(𝑁2/M) 
operations. A small or large number of groups M will 
improve the complexity performance of the operation 
count for the calculation of near-fields interactions or 
translation calculation. An optimal choice of M is M 
proportional to √𝑁  and the operation count in each 
calculation is balanced to O(𝑁3/2) [15]. We can apply 
FMM to each group; if we have small groups and each 
group has only a few basis functions, the calculation of 
near-fields interaction will be only O(N), and the same will 
be the case for aggregation and desegregation [15]. To 
reduce the translation calculation, when the groups are far 
from each other, we aggregate the field from the center of 
a group to another large group and designate the received 
field to the groups residing in the second larger group. This 
process reduces the translation counts, and this idea can be 
extended to multiple levels until there are no far-apart 
groups among the highest-level group. The algorithm that 
results from all this procedure is called Multilevel Fast 
Multipole Algorithm (MLFMA) [10]. 
In [10] and [15], the authors introduce a comparison 
example of a telephone communication scenario to 
understand how FMM and MLFMA work. We can 
consider a network with N telephones. Imagine that all the 
telephones are directly connected. In that case, we will need  
𝑁2 telephone lines. If we divide the telephones into groups 
according to their proximity to each other, and then connect 
all the telephones in the same group to a single hub, and 
then connect the hubs, we can reduce the number of 
telephones lines to O(𝑁3/2𝑙𝑜𝑔 𝑁); this is basically what 
FMM does. Now, imagine that we can establish a second 
level of hubs which can further reduce the number of 
telephone lines. If the number of telephone lines is very 
large, we can reduce the number of telephone lines to 
O(NlogN) by establishing multiple levels of hubs. 
Similarly, MLFMA reduces the operation counts and 
memory requirement of the FMM to O(NlogN). 
Finally, as a real application example, in [22], there is a 
snapshot of the surface current on a card induced by a 
Hertzian dipole at 1.0 GHz and a snapshot of the surface 
current on an airplane induced by an incident plane wave 
at 2.0 GHz. The discretization of the airplane surface 
results in nearly 1 million unknowns. Storing it in its 
corresponding full MoM matrix would take around 8TB of 
storage memory. Using MLFMA, the memory storage 
requirement is reduced to 2.5 GB. In [18], the same airplane 
is simulated with approximately 10 million unknowns at 8 
GHz. Also, in [12], we can find another example of surface 
current on an aircraft from a boundary element with 
approximately 2 million unknowns. 
In addition to all the topics discussed above, there are 
parallelization approaches of the MLFMA on distributed 
memory computers. The most common parallelization 
approach is to partition the data as tree structures over 
computational nodes. To make this possible, we apply 
Message Passing Interface (MPI) based parallelization, 
such as [16][17]. 
This paper has briefly discussed the complexity 
performance for MoM and the accelerated versions with 
FMM and MLFMA as integral method solvers for EM 
problems in the frequency domain.  A comparison of the 
complexity performance for these three algorithms using 
iterative solvers is summarized in Table 1.

VI. BIG DATA TECHNIQUES IN ELECTROMAGNETIC 
ENGINEERING PROBLEMS 
The electromagnetic spectrum has shown four 
characteristics of Big Data, namely, Variety, Volume, 
Value, and Velocity [32]. One application of Big Data is 
reported in [32], where data mining is used to detect 
abnormal spectrum and abnormal positioning targets from 
massive EM data in real-time. Another application of Big 
Data in EM problems is Symbolic Regression (SR). This 
type of regression analysis is used to perform a search in an 
analytical expression that fits a large dataset [23] SR is 
classified as a Machine Learning technique and can be 
applied to derive a full-wave simulation-based analytical 
expression for the characteristic impedance Z0 of microstrip 
lines using Big Data resulting from a 3D-EM simulation 
[23]. SR is considered a suitable algorithm for obtaining 
accurate analytical expressions where the interrelations 
within the data are highly complex in a very large dataset 
[23]. A different implementation of machine learning to 
manage the large size of data for design optimization in EM 
can be found in the literature, such as reinforcement 
learning for antenna configuration and design [33], deep 
learning for microwave filter and circuit design [34], EM

computation.

inverse problems in oil and gas exploration, as well as 
microwave and optical imaging [30].  
Big Data in EM is found in the design of tilted-beam 
antennas with aperiodic Partially Reflective Surfaces 
(PRS). To design antennas for beamforming and high gain 
wireless 
application, 
PRS 
are 
highly 
reflective 
metasurfaces considered well suitable for the design of 
antennas [25]. During the optimization process of the 
aperiodic PRS, a large data size is generated. An improved 
Hybrid Real-binary Bat Algorithm (HRBBA) is applied to 
optimize the aperiodic PRS [26]. Bat Algorithm (BA), 
inspired by the echolocation of microbats, efficiently and 
reliably process Big Data optimization problems [27]-[29]. 
In [30], a statistical approach is proposed based on the 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for Large-Scale 
Georsteering inversion using directional electromagnetic 
logging measurements. Due to the high volume of data 
collection in the oil and gas industry, the proposed method 
in [30] addresses large-scale inverse problems.  
Today, the convergence between Big Data Analytics 
and High-Performance Computing is considered a 
promising research area [35]. In CEM, training deep 
learning or running large-scale simulations can take a 
tremendous amount of time. For this reason, parallel and 
high-performance computing are essential to efficiently 
accelerate the convergence of an algorithm toward an 
accurate solution. An application of Big Data techniques in 
the EM scattering problem can be found in [31]. This work 
proposes a method to predict the number and location of 
scattering grating lobes produced by an array antenna. The 
method used implements the idea of decomposing the RCS 
of the array antenna into a multiplication of the array RCS 
factor and the element RCS factor.  
Fast Algorithms such as MLFMA are developed to 
accelerate the algorithm execution. At the same time, they 
can reduce the complexity of the algorithm in terms of 
memory and time; especially, it considerably alleviates the 
memory requirement to store the matrix system that can 
store millions or billions of unknown’s values. Parallel 
computing is implemented to reduce the computational 
time of the algorithm; in addition, it extends the usability 
of multiple threats for the mathematical operations in 
solving the problem.  Applications of high-performance 
computing in EM engineering applications can be found in 
areas such as EM radiation, propagation and scattering, 
antenna analysis, RCS, analysis of Electromagnetic 
Compatibility (ECM) and Electromagnetic Interference 
(EMI), circuits modeling, microwave, analysis, nano-
electronic devices among others [36]-[40]. 
VII. CONCLUSION 
Big Data has become one of the most important fields 
for complex research related to engineering applications. 
We have seen that the term Big Data does not only mean a 
very large amount of data; it is also a concept considering 
several important factors, such as how we interpret data, 
how valuable it is, and even how variable the data could be, 
like the well-known 5 V’s of Big Data. Besides, Big Data 
helps with the management of structured, unstructured, or 
misstructured data. Efficient algorithms exploit Big Data’s 
potential by reducing its computational complexity in 
modern computers. High-performance computing supports 
efficient large-scale data-intensive processing to enable 
complex applications in different scientific and engineering 
fields. 
In this survey, we have described what computational 
electromagnetics is and how highly multidisciplinary of a 
field it is. We have also described the numerical procedures 
of MoM and its application in EM scattering problems. 
MoM has been the base for fast algorithm implementations, 
such as FMM and MLFMA. It is important to state that 
MLFMA has been one of the most important advances in 
CEM in the last two decades. The development of 
numerical methods can be applied effectively across 
spatial, temporal, and frequency scales with the modeling 
and simulation of physical phenomena, such as circuits, 
heat transfer, and charge transport. This opens a new 
opportunity for computational electromagnetics research.
