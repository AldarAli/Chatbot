Abstract—This paper proposes a novel distance measuring
scheme based on repeated PN sequence for ultra wide-band
vehicle radar systems. The proposed scheme measures the
distance between a vehicle and an obstacle based on repeated
use of a single short pseudo random sequence. Simulation
results show that the proposed scheme provides a shorter mean
distance measuring time while keeping a similar measurement
error performance to that of the conventional scheme.

I. INTRODUCTION
Recently, the vehicle radar system has attracted much
interest for improved road safety, since it enables drivers
to safely control their vehicles by providing them with in-
formation on the distance between the vehicles and obstacles
[1]-[4]. The vehicle radar system can be classiﬁed into two
categories: long-range radar (LRR) and short-range radar
(SRR) systems [3]. Speciﬁcally, we are concerned with the
SRR system since it has lower cost and higher distance
accuracy than those of the LRR system [3].
Due to its high resolution requirement, the SRR system
generally employs the ultra wide-band (UWB) signal [1],
[3], and its distance measuring accuracy becomes higher as
the length of the pseudo-noise (PN) sequence used in the
UWB increases [5]-[7]. However, a long PN sequence leads
to a long distance measuring time, and consequently, is not
appropriate for the vehicle radar system requiring a short
distance measuring time to avoid a collision among high-
speed vehicles.
To tackle this problem, recently, a distance measuring
method using multiple PN sequences with different lengths
instead of a single long PN sequence was proposed [7]. In
this paper, on the other hand, a novel distance measuring
scheme based on repeated use of a single short PN sequence
is proposed. The simulation results demonstrate that the pro-
posed scheme offers a shorter mean distance measuring time
while maintaining a similar measurement error performance
to that of [7].
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section II describes the signal model and proposed distance
measuring scheme. Simulation results are presented in Sec-
tion III. Finally, Section IV concludes this paper.

II. PROPOSED SCHEME
Fig. 1 shows the system model of the proposed distance
measuring scheme. To measure the distance between a
vehicle and an obstacle, ﬁrst, the direct sequence (DS)-UWB
signal generator transmits the following DS-UWB signal
sK(t) to the obstacle:
sK(t) =
√
Ec
KN−1
∑
j=0
pmod(j,N)g(t − jTc),
(1)
where Ec and Tc are the chip energy and duration of a PN
sequence with a length of N, respectively, K is the number
of repeated use of the PN sequence, pj ∈ {−1, +1} is the
jth chip, mod(·, ·) is the modulo operation, and g(t) is a
UWB waveform with unit energy over [0, Tc). Subsequently,
the transmitted signal sK(t) is reﬂected from the obstacle
and returns to the radar with a time delay τ, and thus, the
received signal y(t) can be expressed as
y(t) = sK(t − τ) + w(t),
(2)
where w(t) represents the additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN) process with double-sided power spectral density
of N0/2. To estimate the delay τ, next, a correlation between
the received signal and a reference template sK(t−˜τ)/√Ec,
where ˜τ is a trial value for τ, is performed as
RK(τ, ˜τ) =
∫ t1+KNTc

for ˜τ = 0, Tc, 2Tc, · · · , KNTc, where t1 denotes the
initial time of correlation. Finally, the distance estimator
block estimates the distance between the vehicle and ob-
stacle based on RK(τ, ˜τ), whose detailed process is shown
in Fig. 2.
The maximum correlation value of RK(τ, ˜τ) is ﬁrst
selected and then compared with a threshold Rth. If the
maximum value is larger than Rth, the delay estimate ˆτ is
obtained as
ˆτ = arg max
˜τ {RK(τ, ˜τ)},
(4)
otherwise, the selection and comparison process resumes
with newly transmitted sK(t). Once a delay estimate is
obtained, the estimate of the distance D between the radar
and obstacle is calculated as cˆτ
2 , where c is the velocity of
light (3 × 108 m/sec). To get a more reliable distance esti-
mate, Q delay estimates and the corresponding Q distance
estimates are obtained, and then, the standard deviation σD
of the Q distance estimates is compared with a threshold
σR speciﬁed by the system. If σD is less than σR, the ﬁnal
distance estimate ˆD is obtained by averaging the Q distance
estimates; otherwise, the overall distance estimation process
is repeated with increasing K by 1. It should be noted that
the proposed scheme is based on RK(τ, ˜τ), Rth, and σR
independent from the speed of vehicles, and thus, valid for
any speed of vehicles.
III. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, the proposed scheme is compared with
the conventional scheme [7] in terms of the mean distance
measuring time and mean distance measuring error deﬁned
as the mean time that elapses prior to obtaining ˆD satisfying

we assume the following parameters: N = 15, Q = 100,
σR = 3 m (10% of the maximum detectable range 30 m
[2] of the SRR systems), and Tc = 2 ns. Rth is set with
a false alarm probability of 0.01, and D is assumed to be
distributed uniformly over the detectable range [5, 30] of
the SRR systems. For the conventional scheme, we use PN
sequences with lengths of 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 as in [7]
Fig. 3 shows the mean distance measuring time of the
proposed and conventional schemes as a function of Ec/N0.
From the ﬁgure, the proposed scheme is observed to out-
perform the conventional one as expected. This is due
to the fact that the proposed scheme uses a single short
PN sequence repeatedly unlike the conventional scheme
employing multiple PN sequences with different lengths.

Fig. 4 shows the mean distance measuring error perfor-
mance of the proposed and conventional schemes when
Ec/N0 is −7 dB and −4 dB. As we can see from the
ﬁgure, the proposed scheme exhibits a similar measurement
error performance to that of the conventional scheme in the
detectable range of the SRR systems.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed a novel rapid distance
measuring scheme for UWB vehicle radar systems, where
a single short PN sequence is repeatedly used to yield
a distance estimate, resulting in a shorter mean distance
measuring time than that of the conventional scheme using
multiple PN sequences with different lengths. The simulation
results conﬁrm that the proposed scheme outperforms the
conventional scheme in terms of the mean distance mea-
suring time while exhibiting a similar measurement error
performance to that of the conventional scheme in the
detectable range of the SRR systems.
