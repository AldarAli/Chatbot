Abstract—The paper addresses modular modeling, design,
and improvement of MPEG-like standard for multimedia infor-
mation processing. Morphological (modular) system design and
improvement are considered as composition of the standard
elements (components) conﬁguration. The solving process is
based on Hierarchical Morphological Multicriteria Design
(HMMD) approach: (i) multicriteria selection of alternatives
for system components, (ii) synthesis of the selected alternatives
into a resultant combination. Assessment of design alternatives
is based on interval multiset estimates, assessment of com-
patibility between the design alternatives is based on ordinal
scale. Improvement of the obtained solutions is examined as
well (knapsack-like problem). Numerical examples illustrate
the design process.
Keywords-standard for multimedia information; combinato-
rial synthesis; combinatorial optimization; multiset.
I. INTRODUCTION
In recent decades, the signiﬁcance of multimedia infor-
mation processing is increased (e.g., [1], [2], [7], [8]). A
structural approach to modeling of MPEG-like standard
for multimedia information has been presented in [14].
Multicriteria analysis of algorithms for processing of image
sequences to reveal Pareto-efﬁcient methods for some typical
image sequences was studied in [4]. This work is a basis
for on-line selection of the best processing algorithms for an
input image sequence. In [12], an example for combinatorial
synthesis of MPEG-like standard was described. This paper
focuses on combinatorial synthesis of MPEG-like standard
and its improvement with using interval multiset estimates
of standard elements. The approach can be considered as a
basis for on-line design and modiﬁcation of the standards in
multimedia information processing.
Morphological (modular) system design and improvement
are considered as composition of elements of MPEG-like
standard (components, e.g., rules, algorithms). Hierarchical
Morphological Multicriteria Design (HMMD) approach is
used for modular design with interval multiset estimates
for assessment of design alternatives (DAs) for elements of
standard. This composition method (with interval multiset
estimates) has been suggested in [10] and was used in
some synthesis works (e.g., [11], [13]). HMMD implements
a multi-stage design framework and provides cascade-like
design framework:
(1) Decomposition/partitioning of system and system
requirements to obtain a hierarchical system model and
a hierarchy of system requirements, which correspond to
system parts/components,
(2) ’Bottom-Up’ design process:
(i) multicriteria selection of design alternatives (DAs) for
system components,
(ii) synthesis of the selected alternatives into a resultant
combination.
The additional systems problem is examined: improve-
ment of the obtained solutions (multiple choice problem).
Fig. 1 depicts a simpliﬁed scheme of the approach.
The numerical design examples involve hierarchical sys-
tem structure of MPEG-like standard, DAs for system
parts/components, estimates of DAs and their compatibility,
Bottom-Up design process, analysis and improvement of the
obtained system solutions. Assessment of DAs and their
compatibility is based on expert judgment.
The structure of the paper is the following. Section II
presents description of combinatorial synthesis with interval
multiset estimates. In Section III, hierarchical modeling of
the MPEG-like standard (including design alternatives for
leaf nodes of the model) and combinatorial synthesis of
four Pareto-efﬁcient solutions (on the basis of HMMD) are
described. Section IV presents improvement of the obtained
solutions as selection of improvement actions (on the basis
of multiple choice problem).

II. SYNTHESIS WITH INTERVAL MULTISET ESTIMATES
This section presents a compressed description of com-
binatorial synthesis with interval multiset estimates, which
has been suggested in [10]. Close compressed materials are
contained in ([11], [12],[13]).
The
approach
consists
in
assignment
of
elements
(1, 2, 3, ...) into an ordinal scale [1, 2, ..., l]. As a result,
a multi-set based estimate is obtained, where a basis set
involves all levels of the ordinal scale: Ω = {1, 2, ..., l}
(the levels are linear ordered: 1 ≻ 2 ≻ 3 ≻ ...) and
the assessment problem (for each alternative) consists in
selection of a multiset over set Ω while taking into account
two conditions:
1. Cardinality of the selected multiset equals a speciﬁed
number of elements η = 1, 2, 3, ... (i.e., multisets of cardi-
nality η are considered);
2. “Conﬁguration” of the multiset is the following: the
selected elements of Ω cover an interval over scale [1, l]
(i.e., “interval multiset estimate”).
Thus, an estimate e for an alternative A is (scale
[1, l], position-based form or position form): e(A)
=
(η1, ..., ηι, ..., ηl), where ηι corresponds to the number
of elements at the level ι (ι
=
1, l), or e(A)
=
{
η1
z }| {
1, ..., 1,
η2
z }| {
2, ...2,
η3
z }| {
3, ..., 3, ...,
ηl
z }| {
l, ..., l}. The number of multisets
of cardinality η, with elements taken from a ﬁnite set of
cardinality l, is called the “multiset coefﬁcient” or “multiset
number” ([6],[15]):
µl,η
=
l(l+1)(l+2)...(l+η−1)
η!
. This
number corresponds to possible estimates (without taking
into account interval condition 2). In the case of condition 2,
the number of estimates is decreased. Generally, assessment
problems based on interval multiset estimates can be denoted
as follows: P l,η. The assessment problem P 3,4 will be used
in numerical examples.
In addition, operations over multiset estimates are used
[10]: integration, vector-like proximity, aggregation.
Integration of estimates (mainly, for composite systems)
is based on summarization of the estimates by compo-
nents (i.e., positions). Let us consider n estimates (po-
sition form):
estimate e1 = (η1
1, ..., η1
ι , ..., η1
l ), . . .,
estimate eκ = (ηκ
1 , ..., ηκ
ι , ..., ηκ
l ), . . ., estimate en =
(ηn
1 , ..., ηn
ι , ..., ηn
l ). Then, the integrated estimate is:
esti-
mate eI = (ηI
1, ..., ηI
ι , ..., ηI
l ), where ηI
ι = Pn
κ=1 ηκ
ι
∀ι =
1, l. In fact, the operation U is used for multiset estimates:
eI = e1 U ... U eκ U ... U en.
Vector-like proximity is considered as follows. Let A1
and A2 be two alternatives with corresponding inter-
val multiset estimates e(A1), e(A2). Vector-like proxim-
ity for the alternatives above is:
δ(e(A1), e(A2)) =
(δ−(A1, A2), δ+(A1, A2)), where vector components are: (i)
δ− is the number of one-step changes: element of quality
ι + 1 into element of quality ι (ι = 1, l − 1) (this corre-
sponds to “improvement”); (ii) δ+ is the number of one-
step changes: element of quality ι into element of quality
ι + 1 (ι = 1, l − 1) (this corresponds to “degradation”). It is
assumed: |δ(e(A1), e(A2))| = |δ−(A1, A2)|+|δ+(A1, A2)|.
A median (aggregated) estimate (aggregation) for a
set of initial estimates is deﬁned as follows. Let E =
{e1, ..., eκ, ..., en} be the set of initial estimates. let D be
the set of all possible estimates (E ⊆ D). Thus, the median
estimates (“generalized median” M g and “set median” M s)
are:
M g = arg minM∈D
Pn
κ=1 |δ(M, eκ)|;
M s =
arg minM∈E
Pn
κ=1 |δ(M, eκ)|.
A brief description of combinatorial synthesis (HMMD)
with ordinal estimates of design alternatives is the following
([9], [10]). An examined composite (modular, decompos-
able) system consists of components and their interconnec-
tion or compatibility (IC). Basic assumptions of HMMD
are the following:
(a) a tree-like structure of the system;
(b) a composite estimate for system quality that integrates
components (subsystems, parts) qualities and qualities of
IC (compatibility) across subsystems;
(c) monotonic cri-
teria for the system and its components;
(d) quality of
system components and IC are evaluated on the basis of
coordinated ordinal scales. The designations are: (1) design
alternatives (DAs) for leaf nodes of the model; (2) priorities
of DAs (ι = 1, l; 1 corresponds to the best one);
(3)
ordinal compatibility for each pair of DAs (w = 1, ν; ν
corresponds to the best one). Let S be a system consisting
of m parts (components): R(1), ..., R(i), ..., R(m). A set of
design alternatives is generated for each system part above.
The problem is:
Find a composite design alternative
S = S(1)⋆...⋆S(i)⋆
... ⋆ S(m)
of DAs (one representative design alternative
S(i) for each system component/part R(i), i = 1, m ) with
non-zero compatibility between design alternatives.
A discrete “space” of the system excellence (a poset)
on the basis of the following vector is used:
N(S) =
(w(S); e(S)),
where w(S) is the minimum of pairwise
compatibility between DAs, which correspond to different
system components (i.e., ∀ Rj1 and Rj2, 1 ≤ j1 ̸= j2 ≤ m)
in S, e(S) = (η1, ..., ηι, ..., ηl), where ηι is the number of
DAs of the ιth quality in S. Further, the problem is described
as follows:
max e(S),
max w(S),
s.t. w(S) ≥ 1.
(1)
As a result, we search for composite solutions, which are
nondominated by N(S) (i.e., Pareto-efﬁcient). “Maximiza-
tion” of e(S) is based on the corresponding poset. The con-
sidered combinatorial problem is NP-hard and enumerative
solving schemes or heuristics are used.
In the article, combinatorial synthesis is based on usage of
multiset estimates of design alternatives for system parts. For
the resultant system S = S(1)⋆...⋆S(i)⋆...⋆S(m) the same
type of the multiset estimate is examined: an aggregated
estimate (“generalized median”) of corresponding multiset
estimates of its components (i.e., selected DAs). Thus,
15

ICDT 2013 : The Eighth International Conference on Digital Telecommunications

N(S) = (w(S); e(S)), where e(S) is the “generalized me-
dian” of estimates of the solution components. The modiﬁed
problem is:
max e(S) = M g = arg min
M∈D
m
X
i=1
|δ(M, e(Si))|,
max w(S),
s.t.
w(S) ≥ 1.
(2)
Here, enumeration methods or heuristics are used ([9], [10]).
The basic multiple choice problem is (e.g., [3], [5]):

(3)
In the case of multiset estimates of item “utility” ei, i ∈
{1, ..., i, ..., m} (instead of ci), an aggregated multiset es-
timate as the “generalized median” is used. The item set
is: A = Sm
i=1 Ai, Ai = {(i, 1), (i, 2), ..., (i, qi)}. Boolean
variable xi,j corresponds to selection of the item (i, j). The
solution is a subset of the initial item set: S = {(i, j)|xi,j =
1}. The problem is:
max e(S) = max M =
arg min

III. STRUCTURE OF STANDARD AND SYNTHESIS

been examined in [14]. A simpliﬁed hierarchical model of
MPEG-like standard was analyzed in [14]. Here, a modiﬁca-
tion of the above-mentioned hierarchical model is considered

chronization, streaming data, testing, control) M: basic

Note, the initial set of possible solutions includes 82944
combinations.
IV. IMPROVEMENT/RECONFIGURATION
Generally, system improvement process can be based on
the following methods (e.g., [9]):
(i) improvement of a system component (element),
(ii) improvement of compatibility between system com-
ponents,
(iii) change a system structure, for example, extension of
the system by addition of system components/parts.
Here, the system improvement (or reconﬁguration) pro-
cess is brieﬂy presented as a combination of improvement
actions by elements and improvement actions by compati-
bility. The illustrative improvement actions are presented in
Table 3.

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The paper describes a hierarchical approach to modular
design of MPEG-like standard. Note, this material is a
preliminary one and is based on illustrative estimates of
design alternatives for elements of the standard (and esti-
mates of compatibility between the design alternatives). The
described illustrative solving schemes can be considered as
prototype frameworks for real-world applications.
In the future, it may be prospective to consider the
following research directions:
1. Consideration of other design and improvement (adap-
tation) problems in analysis and generation of communica-
tion standards;
2. Special simulation research to analyze various versions
of communication standards;
3. Usage of AI techniques; and
4. Usage of the described application and design approach
in engineering/CS education.
