Abstract— In this work, a Light Emitting Diode (LED)
assisted navigation system for large environments is presented.
The LEDs are used both for room illumination purposes and
as transmitters if modulated at high frequencies. The payload
data together with the identifiers, IDs, assigned to the physical
location of the transmitters are broadcast using an On-Off
Keying (OOK) modulated scheme. The mobile receiver is a
double p-i-n/pin SiC photodetector with light controlled
filtering
properties.
Coded
multiplexing
techniques
for
supporting communications and navigation together on the
same channel are analysed. A demonstration of fine-grained
indoor localization is simulated. Different indoor layouts for
the LEDs are considered. Square and hexagon mesh are tested,
and a 2D localization design, demonstrated by a prototype
implementation, is presented. The results showed that the
LED-aided Visible Light Communication (VLC) navigation
system makes possible not only to determine the position of a
mobile target inside the unit cell but also in the network and
concomitantly to infer the travel direction in time.

INTRODUCTION
With
the
rapid
advancement
of
smart
equipment,
location based services that employ different kinds of
communication and positioning technologies have started to
develop. Although Global Positioning System (GPS) works
extremely well in an open-air localization, it does not
perform effectively in indoor environments, due to the
inability of GPS signals to penetrate building materials.
Nowadays, indoor positioning methods are mainly based on
Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Radio-frequency identification (RFID),
Visible Light Communications (VLC) and inertia navigation
[1]-[5]. Although many methods are available, they require
dense coverage of WiFi access points or expensive sensors,
like high-performance cameras, to guarantee the localization
accuracy.
VLC is a data transmission technology [6]-[8]. VLC can
easily be employed in indoor environments, such as offices,
homes, hospitals, airplanes/airports and conference rooms.
Compared with other positioning methods, indoor VLC
based positioning has advantages, since it can use the
existing
LED
lighting
infrastructure
with
simple
modifications.
In the following, we propose to use modulated visible
light, carried out by white low cost LEDs, to provide
globally
consistent
signal-patterns
and
engage
indoor
localization. The LEDs are capable of switching to different
light intensity levels at a very fast rate. The switching rate is
fast enough to be imperceptible by the human eye. This
functionality can be used for communication where the data
is encoded in the emitting light in different ways [9]. A
photodetector can receive the modulated signals and decode
the data. This means that the LEDs serve twofold for
providing illumination as well as for communications.
Research is necessary to design LED arrangements that
can optimize communication performance while meeting
the illumination constraints for a variety of indoor layouts,
using four-code assignment for the LEDs in an extended
square or diamond mesh. The main idea is to divide the
space into spatial beams originating from the different light
sources, and identify each beam with a unique timed
sequence of light signals. The receiver, equipped with an a-
SiC:H pinpin photodiode, determines its physical position
by detecting and decoding the light signals. The overlap of
different light beams at the receiver is used as an advantage
to increase the positioning accuracy. Fine-grained indoor
localization can enable several applications; in supermarkets
and shopping malls, exact location of products can greatly
improve the customer's shopping experience and enable
customer analytics and marketing [10][11].

The use of Red-Green-Blue (RGB) LEDs is a promising
solution as they offer the possibility of Wavelength Division
Multiplexing (WDM), which can enhance the transmission
data rate. A WDM receiver has been developed [12][13].
The device is based on tandem a-SiC:H/a-Si:H pin/pin light
controlled filter. When different visible signals are encoded
in the same optical transmission path, the device multiplexes
the different optical channels, performs different filtering
processes
(amplification,
switching,
and
wavelength
conversion)
and
finally
decodes
the
encoded
signals
recovering the transmitted information.
In this paper, a LED-assisted indoor positioning and
navigation VLC system, for large indoor environment is
proposed. The paper is organized as follow. After the
introduction
(Section
I),
in
Section
II,
the
system
configuration is presented. The principle of the positioning
scheme and the algorithm to decode the information are
described and experimental results are presented, in Section
III. A 2D localization design, demonstrated by a prototype
implementation is tested. Fine-grained indoor localization is
demonstrated
using
square
and
hexagonal
topologies.
Finally, in Section IV, conclusions are addressed. The
proposed,
composed
data
transmission
and
indoor
positioning,
involves
wireless
communication,
smart
sensoring and optical sources network, building up a
transdisciplinary
approach
framed
in
cyber-physical
systems.
II.
SYSTEM CONFIGURATION
LED bulbs work as transmitters, broadcasting the
information. An optical receiver extracts its location to
perform positioning and, concomitantly, the transmitted data
from
each
transmitter.
Multiple
LEDs
can
transmit
simultaneously
to
the
same
receiver
using
joint
transmission. To synchronize the signals from multiple
LEDs, the transmitters use different ID´s, such that the
signal is constructively at the receiver.

The unit cells, for the analyzed topologies, are displayed
in Figure 1. In Figure 1a, the proposed LED arrangement
employs four modulated LEDs placed at the corners of a
square grid. In Figure 1b, a cluster of three diamond cells
sharing the violet node, fill the space with a hexagon,
leading to the hexagonal topology.
The estimated distance from the ceiling lamp to the
receiver is used to generate a circle around each transmitter
on which the device must be located in order to receive the
transmitted information (generated location and coded data).

In all topologies, the grid sizes were chosen to avoid
overlap in the receiver from adjacent grid points. To
improve its practicality, the tested geometric scenario for the
calculations, in both topologies, uses a grid in smaller size
(2 cm between adjacent nodes). To receive the information
from several transmitters, the receiver must be positioned
where the circles from each transmitter overlap, producing
at the receiver, a MUX signal that, after demultiplexing, acts
twofold as a positioning system and a data transmitter. The
generated regions, defined
onwards as footprints, are
pointed out in Figure 1 and reported in Table 1. In the
hexagonal topology, each node has six neighbors, so,
eighteen footprints are possible. Twelve at the edges of the
six equilateral triangles where four circles overlap (#P4 to
#P9) and six at their centroids (#P1 to #P3), where only
three channels are received. Taking into account the XY
symmetry (Figure 1b), the R, G and B nodes and their
symmetric (R’G’B’) must be considered. When the received
channels come from outside the hexagon edges (first ring),
the nodes are label with 0 (see Figure 1b). When the signal
comes only from one LED, the coordinates of the LED are
assigned to the device’s reference point. If the device
receives multiple signals, i.e., if it is in an overlapping
region of two or more LEDs, it finds the centroid of the

received coordinates and stores it as the reference point.
This is the so called fine-graining of the unit cell.
For data transmission commercially available white
RGB-LEDs and a violet (V: 400 nm) LED were used. The
output spectrum of the white LED contains three peaks
assigned to the colours red (R: 626 nm), green (G: 530 nm)
and blue (B: 470 nm), that mixed together provide the white
perception to the human eye. Each chip, in the trichromatic
LED, can be switched on and off individually for a desired
bit sequence. The luminous intensity is regulated by the
driving current for white perception. They exhibit a wide
divergence angle (2x60º), since they are also designed for
general lighting and allow a wide delivery of the VLC
signal around the surrounding area. The driving current of
each emitter is controlled independently, suppling the
respective coding sequence and frequency [14]. In both
topologies, the driving current of the emitters having the
same wavelength was always the same.

When the rooms are very large, such as in supermarkets
or large shopping malls, the positioning technique (four-
code assignment for the LEDs), is applied in the whole
room [15]. Two topologies were set for the unit cell: the
square, (Figure 2a) and the hexagon (Figure 2b). In the first,
the proposed LED arrangement employs four modulated
LEDs placed at the corners of a square grid. The unit cell
Ci,j is repeated in the horizontal and vertical directions in
order to fill all the space. In the second topology (Figure
2b), the hexagon, the same LED array was used, but in a no-
orthogonal system. We select a pair inclined at 120 degrees
to be the axes, labelled as X and Y. We have readdressed
the nodes, in the oblique Cartesian system. Consequently, in
both topologies, each node, X i,j, carries its own color, X,
(RGBV) as well as its ID position in the network (i,j).
C.
The OOK modulation scheme
The modulation of the emitted light was done through
the modulation of the driving electrical current of the
semiconductor chips of each LED. An on-off keying
modulation scheme was used. The frame structures are
illustrated in Figure 3, for both topologies.

For both, the frame is built based on three separate
blocks; the synchronism (Sync), the ID address of the
transmitter (ID) and the message to transmit (payload data).
The first five bits are used for time synchronization. The
same synchronization header [10101], in an ON-OFF
pattern, is imposed simultaneously to all the emitters. Each
color signal (RGBV) carries, its own ID-BIT, so, the next
bits give the coordinates of the emitter inside the array (Xi,j).
Cell’s IDs are encoded using a binary representation for the
decimal number. In the square topology (Figure 3a), six bits
are used: the first three for the binary code of the line and
the other three for the column. In the hexagonal topology
(Figure 1b to code the positive and the negative coordinates
"sign and magnitude" representation was used, setting bit to
0 is for a positive number, and setting it to 1 is for a
negative number. The remaining bits in the number indicate
the absolute value. So, the next eight bits (ID) are assigned,
respectively, to the x and y coordinate (i,j) of the emitter in
the array (Figure 3b). For instance, R12 emitter sends a six
ID_BIT [001 010] in the square topology while in the
hexagonal one the eight ID bits are [0001 0010]. For both,
the last bits, in the frame, are reserved for the message send
by the Xij node (payload data).
D.
The VLC receiver
The VLC receiver is a two terminal, p-i'(a-SiC:H)-n/p-
i(a-Si:H)-n
photodiode
packed
in
two
transparent
conductive contacts (TCO). The deposition conditions,
optoelectronic characterization and device optimization are
described in [13]. The configuration and operation is
illustrated in Figure 4.
Figure 4.
Double pi´n/pin configuration and device operation.
The device operates within the visible range using for
data transmission the modulated low power light supplied
simultaneously by the RGBV LEDs located at the nodes of
the array. A mix of R, G, B, and V pulsed communication
channels (input channels; transmitted data), each one with a
specific bit sequence, impinges on the device and are
absorbed accordingly to their wavelengths (see arrows in the
figure). The combined optical signal (MUX signal; received
data) is analyzed by reading out the generated photocurrent
under negative applied voltage and violet background
lighting, applied from the front side of the receiver [12]
[16].

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A.
Coding/Decoding techniques
In Figure 5, the normalized received data due to the
mixture of the four R, G, B, and V input channels, i.e., the
MUX code signal in a stamp time, are displayed, for the
square topology. In Figure 5a, the bit sequence was chosen
to allow all the on/off sixteen (24) possible combinations of
the four input channels. For three times slots (t1, t2, t3), in
Figure 5b, the MUX signal acquired by a receiving positions
P#3, P#1, and P#5 (see Table 1), is displayed. The decoded
packet of transmitted information is presented in the top of
both figures.

The results from Figure 5a show that the MUX signal
presents as many separated levels as the possible on/off

transmitted information [17]. All the ordered levels (d0-d15)
are pointed out at the correspondent levels, and are
displayed as horizontal dotted lines. On the right hand side

of Figure 5a, the match between MUX levels and the 4 bits
binary code assigned to each level is shown. Hence, by
assigning each output level to a 4-digit binary code, [XR,
XG, XB, XV], with X=1 if the channel is on and X=0 if it is
off, the signal can be decoded. The MUX signal presented in
Figure 5a is used for calibration purposes. Comparing the
calibrated levels with the different generated levels (Figure
5b), in the same frame of time, a simple algorithm [18] is
used to decode the multiplex signals. After decoding the
MUX
signals,
the
localization
of
the
receiver
is
straightforward. Taking into account, the frame structure
(Figure 3), the position of the receiver inside the navigation
cell and its ID in the network is revealed [19]. The ID
position,
in
the
unit
cell,
comes
directly
from
the
synchronism block, where all the received channels are,
simultaneously, on or off. The 4-bit binary code ascribed to
the higher level identifies the receiver position in the unit
cell (Table 1). Those binary codes are displayed in the right
hand of the Figure 5b. For instance, the level [1010]
corresponds to the level d10 where the red and the blue
channels are simultaneously on (see arrow in Figure 5a).
The same happens to the other footprints (P#1 and P#5).
Each decoded message carries, also, the node address of the
transmitter. So, the next block of six bits, in the square
topology or eight in the hexagonal one, gives de ID of the
received node. In P#5 the location of the transmitters, in the
network, are B2,2 and V2,3 while in P#1 the assigned
transmitters are R1,2, G1,3, B2,2 and V2,3. The last block is
reserved for the transmission of the message (payload data).
A stop bit (0) is used always at the end of each frame.
B.
LED-aided navigation system
The input of the aided navigation system is the MUX
signal, and the output is the system state estimated at each
time step (t). As a proof of concept, the suitability of the
proposed navigation data bit transition was tested, in the lab
[20]. The solution was to move the receiver along a known
pattern path as described in Figure 2a, the arrows illustrate
the simulated path in successive instants. The signal
acquisition
on
the
different
generated
locations
was
performed and the transition actions were correlated by
calculating the ID position codes in the successive instants.
Taking into account Figure 5b, results show that, as the
receiver
moves
between
generated
point
regions,
the
received information pattern changes. Note that, between
two consecutive data sets, there is one navigation data bit
transition (a channel is missing or added). We observe that
when the receiver initially moves from P#3 to P#1, the
green, G1,3 and the violet, V2,3, channels are added and the
4-bynary bit code changes from [1010] to [1111].
In Figure 6a, the arrows illustrate the simulated path, in
the hexagon topology, at six successive instants (t1 to t6).
Figure 6b, displays the MUX signals acquired at t1, t2 and t3.
At the right hand of the figure, the 4-bit binary codes are
pointed out at the correspondent levels.

1,-1 B1,0V0,0, then, at t3, moves towards P#2, [1011]/ R0,-1
B1,0V0,0.
The main results show that, for both topologies, the
location of a mobile receiver is achieved based on the LED-
based navigation system. At the client’s end, positioning
bits are decided by the received MUX signal (wavelengths
and ID address of the received channels). Fine grained
localization was achieved by detecting the wavelengths of
the received channels in each cell (Table 1). Nine sub-
regions fill each square cell while in the hexagonal, due to
the existing XY symmetry, eighteen possible sub-regions
can be designed. The use of the square, hexagonal or both
topologies depends on the layout of the environment.
