Abstract—Social media inﬂuences the tourist industry. This 
conceptual model research investigates the impact of Social 
Media (SM) on user's travel purchase intention and attitude. 
Data were collected from SM users in order to measure if there 
is a relationship between specific factors of SM and user attitude 
on travel purchase intention through Structural Equation 
Modeling (SEM). The main purpose of the research is to find 
out if there is a positive relationship among the following SM 
factors and travel purchase intention. That is, source credibility 
and user attitude, information reliability and user attitude, user 
enjoyment while searching for travel information, perceived 
value in travel services information and user attitude. This study 
presents a theoretical conceptual model based on the theory of 
credibility, information, enjoyment, and perceived value in SM 
and the potential connection of those factors to the customer 
attitude and purchase intention in travel services.

 INTRODUCTION 
SM users outran 2 billion in 2016, globally. Facebook was 
the most popular social network with 1.86 billion/month 
active users for 2016. Daily Internet users spend 135 minutes 
on SM. In the fourth quarter of 2016, 1.149 million users of 
Facebook accessed SM via mobile devices every month [1]. 
Today Information Technology (IT) has enhanced SM and 
the words “connecting” and “exchanging” have been 
replaced by the words “searching” and “selling” through the 
web [2]–[4]. Tourist industry and hospitality had also become 
an essential tool for accessing different sources of tourism 
[5][6]. The Internet has conquered the travel industry. 
Younger generations, especially Gen Y, are much more 
active in planning trips; they send and receive information via 
a variety of sources, including mobile devices (e.g., videos, 
SM). They make online reservations and think about potential 
destinations to visit. Users seek to be part of a wide range of 
traveling experiences and they are more responsive to online 
advertising. SM and mobile devices support these new ways 
of expression. 
The paper is structured as follows: Section II presents the 
research background. Section III presents the research 
methodology and hypotheses. Section IV contains the 
conclusion of our empirical study and the next steps to be 
followed. 
II. 
RESEARCH BACKGROUND 
Today SM networks, like Facebook and Instagram, allow 
people from different locations to interact and develop 
relationships or share travel experiences (e.g., posting photos 
and videos, sharing context) [7]. This information can be very 
useful to potential travelers and can be personalized [8]. 
There are installed SM apps in every smart device and they 
are used as a tool for finding more travel information, with 
search engines providing direct access [9]. Researchers, [10] 
found that purchase intention is one dimension of customer 
behavior. Behavior is assessed through purchase intention 
and consumers’ behavioral patterns are examined [11]. 
Behavior is correlated to purchase intention [11][12] and this 
relationship has been empirically tested on tourist industry 
[13][14] and it has been found that customers’ information 
reliability and satisfaction becomes an important factor of e-
behavioral intentions. Website design and information 
quality is essential for user satisfaction. There are many 
theories about value, such as consumption value, service 
value, consumer value, and perceived value [15]–[18]. When 
we talk about perceived value [15][19], we refer to 
consumer’s perception, price and quality of a product, 
evaluating cost and benefit factors. In order to proceed with 
SEM, we assume our conceptual research model, presented 
in Figure 1, which is measured by the following four 
variables: 
source 
credibility, 
enjoyment, 
information 
reliability and perceived value, in connection with customers’ 
attitude and purchase intention in travelling. In order to 
confirm our Conceptual Research Model, we will use SEM, 
which incorporates the confirmatory approach, needed to 
justify our hypotheses. SEM uses confirmatory analysis 
rather than exploratory analysis for data. We can assess the 
measurement model validity with Confirmatory Factor 
Analysis 
(CFA), 
which 
compares 
the 
theoretical 
measurement with actual model. SEM provides clear 
estimates of the errors in our parameters. Indeed, alternative 
methods (such as those using the regression or the general 
linear model) assume that errors all through the independent 
variables are eliminated. However, ignoring mistakes, could 
possibly lead us to serious inaccuracies, especially if mistakes 
are significant. Such methods are avoided by using the SEM. 
SEM can incorporate both measurable and obscure variables. 
SEM method is preferred because it estimates the multiple 
and interrelated dependence in a single analysis.

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AND HYPOTHESES  
Our study examines which factors and in which way travel 
information searches in SM networks, affect travelers’ 
purchase intention [20]–[22] and decision making. In mental 
accounting theory, travel information is examined, more in 
the context of SM use, rather from a user’s tech perspective 
[15][16]. Based on the perceived value and the usage of SM 
in the tourism sector, we developed our research model, 
Figure 1. In this context, perceptual value is defined in terms 
of quality and price performance or cost-benefit. Variables 
are categorized as source credibility, information reliability, 
enjoyment and perceived value. In addition, perceived value 
leads to the usage of SM in order to search for travel 
information as a consequence of value perception. 
Based on previous section theory, we design the presented 
research model in Figure1. We select travelers' purchase 
intention as the main theory of the SM usage developed in 
our research model. Framing this, travelers' purchase 
intention is defined in terms of credibility, enjoyment, 
information reliability and perceived value as a trade-off 
between costs and benefits [15][16][23]. The confirmation of 
this model, Figure1, will give us a clear view of how the user 
decide to book a travel. In this way we are expanding 
previous researches on the use of SM by travelers in order to 
enhance our understanding of how travelers choose travel 
destinations in SM and in which way these four important 
variables affect traveler purchase intention and interact with 
customer attitude. 
 
A. Source credibility 
Source credibility is defined as the factor upon which 
information is perceived as believable and trustworthy by 
users [24]. Source credibility works as a main factor in 
decision-making procedures and become aware by high 
levels of risk [25]. Thus, source credibility is relevant within 
the context and the information through computer and user 
interaction [24]. Researches have shown that source 
credibility influence user attitude as a peripheral factor 
because it affects human judgment [26]. Source credibility 
influences persuasion when evidence is fuzzy. In this case, 
hands-on processing can partially become cognitive 
processing [27]. For example, celebrities are one type of 
exogenous factor, which may enhance source credibility by 
influencing users’ judgement [26].  
 
H1a. Source credibility has a positive influence on 
customer attitude 
 
H1b. Source credibility has a positive influence on 
purchase intention 
 
B. Enjoyment 
Enjoyment has a significant effect on technology 
admittance that enforces the meaning of usefulness [28] and 
internal motivation that transforms user feeling to use a 
computer because it is enjoyable. In this case, authors 
referred to enjoyment as the "extent to which the activity of 
using the computer is perceived to be enjoyable in its own 
right”. When people use technology and feel pleased or 
joyful, they perceive technology as a contributory value and 
they are willing to use it again and again [29][23] said that 
the meaning of perceived value incorporates two different 
values (utilitarian and hedonic). Hedonic value explained the 
entertainment and emotional worth of shopping. Researchers 
have shown that enjoyment positively affects perceived value 
[15][17] and the intention of using hedonic information [30]. 
Enjoyable feelings created by using SM apps encourage 
travelers not only to search information for travel destinations 
but also to interact with others. Travelers interact with each 
other by sharing photos or videos [6]. We therefore assume 
the following:  
 
H2a. Enjoyment has a positive influence on customer 
attitude 
 
H2b. Enjoyment has a positive influence on purchase 
intention 
 
C. Information reliability 
Studies in marketing have shown that consumer 
preferences are driven by value. Consumers are essence 
persons who seek to maximize usage [23]. The Internet 
provides travelers with many choices to choose, from many 
destinations to visit. This is the reason why they aim 
information reliability through a strenuous information 
search [31]. Direct access to alternative sources of 
information through SM builds a trust between words-of-
mouth (eWOM) users and expertise travel agents. The 
combination of easy search and information reliability help 
travelers to search, and evaluate a destination, and read new 
experiences related to a trip. Reliability of information is 
considered as a major factor for the traveler in order to 
perceive value when using SM [6].

Travelers searching for reliable and credible information 
provided by the interaction between users of social media 
rather than by obtaining the information through travel 
websites [6]. Travelers use SM networks like Facebook or 
Instagram, which are connected to User Creative Contents 
(UCC) travel destinations, to share their experiences (e.g., 
photos, videos). By that, some travelers evaluate this reliable 
and credible information for a trip, reflecting their desire to 
engage online. The structure of information reliability is akin 
to the source information concept of information quality [32], 
which is the output characteristics of the accuracy, timeliness, 
and completeness offered by the source information. Quality 
of information of a traveler destination has become a driving 
force on user decision making [33] assuming that reliability 
of information influences purchase intention, hypothesizing 
the following: 
 
H3a. Information reliability has a positive influence on 
customer attitude 
 
H3b. Information reliability has a positive influence on 
purchase intention 
 
D. Perceived value 
Perceived value theory has also been adopted in travel 
destinations and shows high levels of influence in the future 
intention of travelers to discover the new or the same 
destinations [34][35] shows that in cruise travel services 
emotional factors are important in the perceived value. In 
cruise vacationer’s behavioral intention is influenced by 
hedonics or pleasure of the perceived value. Travelers 
evaluate the travel information in SM based on their 
perceptions of what they are willing to achieve and what to 
sacrifice. Perceived value involves a balance between costs 
and benefits and an interaction between customer and service 
[36][28] analyze in the cost-benefit theory that the 
discrimination of perceived ease of use and perceived 
usefulness is similar between product performance and the 
effort of using the product. In high levels of perceived value 
in SM, travelers are likely to use a travel information search 
and in the low levels of the perceived value, travelers show 
greater resistance toward travel information searches in SM 
[33]. When travelers search for information its more likely to 
select or reject it based on the perceived benefits and the 
associated sacrifices of use, according to [28].  
 
H4a. Perceived value in travel services information from 
SM has a positive influence on customer attitude 
 
H4b. Perceived value in travel services information from 
SM has a positive influence on purchase intention 
 
E. Data collection 
The data for this study has been collected through a 
convenient sample e-survey from SM users. The e-survey 
was sent with a Facebook link in over of 500 users’ profile. 
The number of responders was over of 400 users. The age 
range of the responders was between 18 and over 54.  
The e-survey is separated in three sections. The first 
section outline users’ habits on social networks and derive 
which are the most important criteria for purchasing products 
or services for them. The second section outline the factors 
that influences user purchase travel decision. In order to 
complete the survey, the third section is collecting data for 
classification and statistical processing. 
 
F. Data analysis 
This research study adopted Structural Equation 
Modeling (SEM) to test the hypotheses. By using SEM we 
want to evaluate our proposed model, analyze and explain the 
collected data [37]. All variables can be directly observed and 
thus qualify as manifest variables, called path analysis. In 
SEM terms, y enclose the endogenous variables and χ enclose 
the exogenous variables [38]. Variables that are influenced 
by other variables in a model are called endogenous 
variables. Variables that are not influenced by another other 
variables in a model are called exogenous variables. 
Covariances, such as the one between χ1, χ2, χ3 and χ4 are 
represented by two-way arrows, Figure 2.  Paths acting as a 
cause are represented by one-way arrows. Each individual 
effect of source credibility, enjoyment, information reliability 
and the perceived value can be separated and is said to be 
related to customer attitude and purchase intention. The 
structural equations for this model are: 
 
 
y1=γ11χ1+γ12χ2+γ13χ3+γ14χ4+e1  
(1) 
 
 
y2=γ21χ1+γ22χ2+γ23χ3+γ24χ4+e2 
 (2) 
 
 
y2=ψ21y1+e3  
(3) 
 
In our proposed research we can see a model with two y 
variables and four χ variables. For the reason of the multiple 
dependent variables, the covariances and the variances of the 
exogenous factors x’s are given and are estimated by the 
values of the sample. As a result of this, is very difficult to 
contribute to the falsification of the model. Freedom degrees 
of our model counts the elements in the Φ matrix containing 
four values of γ, and one of ψ.

Thus, the are exactly as many free parameters as there are 
the data points. Transformations of the data are created by the 
parameters. Σ matrix does not impose any restrictions to our 
model, meaning that it has 0 freedom degrees. In our SEM 
analysis we are going to include all individual items that load 
onto the observation variables, their relationships, variances, 
disturbance or errors. 
In this study, the measurements were taken from other 
studies focused in the four manifest variables known as 
source credibility, information reliability, enjoyment, and 
perceived value. To measure the manifest variable of 
credibility, we adapted four items studied by [39], for the 
manifest variable of enjoyment four items from a study 
performed by [40] were adapted, for the manifest variable of 
information reliability four items from a study performed by 
[33] were adapted and for the manifest variable of perceived 
value items four items from [15][16] were adapted. For every 
single item we use multi-measurement items to overcome the 
limitations. For the reason that every single item has a high 
rate of measurement error we usually aim to capture all the 
attributes of a structure. All of these 16 items were measured 
on 5-point Likert scales ranging from strongly disagree (1) to 
strongly agree (5). 
In this research, the Amos 24.0 SEM analysis package will 
be used to test and estimate our conceptual model. Two 
different approaches are going to be used for testing our 
research hypotheses. The first approach is with confirmatory 
factor analysis (CFA) and the second with analysis of 
variance regression (ANOVA). After the validation of our 
measures, SEM will be used to test the validity of the 
proposed model and hypotheses. For the validity of our 
model is needed to test the goodness-of-fit, [41], assisted by 
the, goodness of-fit index (GFI) [42], adjusted goodness-of-
fit index (AGFI) [41], comparative fit index (CFI) [43], and 
root mean square error of approximation RMSEA [44]. GFI, 
AGFI and CFI must have values between 0.9 and 1.0 to 
indicate a good fitting model. RMSEA with a value below 
0.80 is recommended [45][46]. 
In order to evaluate our structural model in a predictive 
manner, we need to calculate the R2s for the manifest 
variables, 
source 
credibility, 
enjoyment, 
information 
reliability and perceived value and discover the relationship 
with travel purchase intention. According to multiple 
regression results, R2 indicates the amount of variance 
explained by the exogenous variables [47].  
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
The aim of this article is to create a model by which we 
will be able to interpret the effect of specific SM factors on 
user purchase intention as far as a travel service is concerned. 
The theoretical background and the research gap that led us 
to the study of the specific case, are elaborated in the article. 
The results will show us whether there is a correlation or 
relationship among the following factors and the travel 
service purchase intention and user attitude. The factors are: 
source credibility, information reliability, enjoyment, and 
perceived value. As a next step to this research, we will 
analyze the data collected from the e-survey and test the 
validity of our research model by detecting the factors that 
influence the user purchase intention when traveling, through 
SM browsing. With SEM we going to check our assumptions 
and confirming our model. The data analysis by use of the 
SEM will determine the critical factors concerning the 
customer attitude towards travel purchase services. 
Furthermore, by use of the SEM method we will be able to 
look into other variables which can influence purchase 
intention, such as age and income, and also the how way they 
interact with reliability, enjoyment and perceptual value.
