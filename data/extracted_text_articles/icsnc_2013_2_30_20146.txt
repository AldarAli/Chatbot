Abstract—In this paper, we propose a novel cognitive engine 
based on genetic algorithm (GA). Unlike conventional GA-
based cognitive engines, the proposed cognitive engine takes 
the frequency band of the secondary user as one of the 
transmission parameters to be optimized, allowing the 
proposed cognitive engine to choose the optimal frequency 
band among the vacant bands detected via the spectrum 
sensing. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed 
cognitive engine well optimizes the transmission parameters 
for a given transmission scenario.

 INTRODUCTION 
The increasing demand for high-speed multimedia 
services has led to the advent of various wideband wireless 
communication systems including long term evolution (LTE), 
IEEE 802.16, digital video broadcasting (DVB), and Wi-Fi. 
As the number of the wideband wireless communications 
and associated subscribers increases, the spectrum deficiency 
problem is inevitable since the frequency spectrum is a 
limited resource. To resolve the problem, the dynamic 
spectrum access (DSA) technique, which opportunistically 
utilizes an underutilized frequency band, has been proposed 
by virtue of the software defined radio (SDR) capable of 
tuning its transmission parameters  [1].  
A secondary user (SU) observes the surrounding 
environments, and subsequently, adjusts its transmission 
parameters (e.g., the transmit power, modulation index, and 
transmission 
bandwidth) 
based 
on 
the 
observation. 
Specifically, the SU first determines if a primary user (PU) is 
utilizing the spectrum band of interest via a spectrum sensing 
[2]. Then, the transmission parameters of the SU are 
optimized by an intelligent signal processing unit referred to 
as a cognitive engine. The implementation of the cognitive 
engine has been studied mainly based on the artificial 
intelligence (AI) techniques such as the genetic algorithm 
(GA), expert systems, neural networks, and case-based 
reasoning [3]. Especially, the GA-based cognitive engine has 
attracted much attention since it is capable of self-evolution 
as the human cognition process unlike other AI-based 
cognitive engines [4].  
In wideband wireless environments, a wideband 
spectrum is generally interpreted as a set of multiple 
narrowbands. Thus, after the vacant narrowbands are 
identified via the spectrum sensing, the cognitive engine 
should choose an optimal narrowband out of the vacant ones. 
Thus, in this paper, we consider the frequency band of an SU 
as one of the transmission parameters to be optimized, and 
subsequently, propose a cognitive engine by designing a 
multiple objective fitness function that includes the 
frequency band of the SU as a transmission parameter, and 
then, applying the fitness function to the genetic algorithm. 
The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section II 
introduces the transmission parameters and the cognitive 
engine system model. Then, in Section III, a multiple 
objective fitness function is proposed taking the frequency 
band of SU as a transmission parameter. Section IV 
demonstrates that a cognitive engine employing the proposed 
fitness function appropriately optimizes the transmission 
parameters, and finally, Section V concludes the paper.

RELATED WORK 
Several studies on the GA-based cognitive engine have 
been researched focusing on how to optimize the 
transmission parameters of the SU [5]-[10]. In [5] and [6], an 
initial version of a GA-based cognitive engine was 
implemented as a hardware test-bed proving its usefulness as 
a cognitive engine. To deal with various transmission 
scenarios, in [7], a multiple objective fitness function is 
designed as a weighted sum of single objective fitness 
functions. Recently, to optimize the multiple objective 
fitness function, cognitive engines have been proposed by 
employing various evolutionary algorithms such as artificial 
bee colony algorithm, ant colony optimization, and 
Biogeography-based optimization instead of GA [8]-[10]. 
However, the conventional researches were focused on the 
transmission parameter optimization after the spectrum 
assignments have been determined, and thus, the frequency 
band of an SU has not been optimized as a transmission 
parameter. 
III. 
SYSTEM MODEL 
Transmission parameters are the variables to be 
optimized based on information in environment parameters 
(e.g., the noise density and the value of the test statistic used 
in the spectrum sensing). In this paper, we consider the 
following transmission parameters: the transmit power 
sP  of 
SU, modulation index 
,
M  bandwidth 
s
B  of the SU signal, 
and index k  of the frequency band that is detected as a 
vacant band via the spectrum sensing.  
To optimize the transmission parameters using GA, we 
first design a structure of the chromosome as a bit stream

example, we can design a chromosome as a bit stream with a

 respectively. Then, a 
multiple objective fitness function is defined to measure the

Finally, the GA provides an optimum solution maximizing 
the designed fitness function. Specifically, a fitness value of 
an initial set of the transmission parameter values is 
calculated, and then, searches for an optimum set by using 
the selection, crossover, and mutation operations. 
IV. 
PROPOSED FITNESS FUNCTION 
The procedure to design a multiple objective fitness 
function in a form of (1) is to determine single objective 
fitness functions and associated weight values. We first 
design single objective fitness functions that affect the data 
transmission performance of the SU including bit error rate 
(BER) and throughput. The smaller value of BER guarantees 
the more reliable performance of the SU, and thus, a single 
objective fitness function 
fBER
 is designed as

bP  is the BER and

 for the given candidates of the transmission parameters. 
When the BER

NUMERICAL RESULTS 
In this section, we explain the cognitive engine simulator 
that we have developed and show the results on the 
transmission parameter optimization. We measured a 
frequency spectrum of [250 MHz, 260 MHz] bands at the top 
of a mountain and used the measured data as the input of the 
simulator. The spectrum is shown in Fig. 2, where four 
spectrum bands (Band 1 ∼  Band 4) are detected as the 
vacant narrowbands. The simulator is developed using 
Matlab graphic user interface (GUI) programming and its 
main screen is shown in Fig. 3. 
For simulations, we assume the following parameters: a 
chromosome with a length of 10 bits, where 4, 2, 2, and 2 
bits are used to represent the values of

 is calculated as the

power over the spectrum range of [200 MHz, 300 MHz], 
then, the threshold for the spectrum sensing is determined to 
satisfy the false alarm probability of 0.01. The spectrum 
sensing is performed via the energy detector.  
For the transmission scenarios, we first consider the 
simplest case that

 as an 
example. Fig. 4 shows (a) the fitness value and (b) the result 
solution of the simulator when 
w = [1 0 0 0].

 From the 
figure, we can see that the fitness value becomes saturated as 
the generation increases. Also, the 7th and 8th bits of the 
chromosome are ‘01’ and the 9th and 10th bits are ‘11’ 
representing that Band 2 (the largest vacant band) is chosen 
as the frequency band and the SU uses the whole spectrum of 
Band 2. However, the transmit power (the 1st-4th bits) and 
the modulation index (the 5th and 6th bits) are randomly 
selected by the GA since the fitness function 
fband
 is not a 
function of 
sP  and

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we have proposed a GA-based cognitive 
engine suitable for the wideband wireless communications. 
Including the frequency band of the SU as a transmission 
parameter to be optimized, we have designed a multiple 
objective fitness function that measures the desirability of a 
solution, and then, applied the fitness function to the GA. 
From numerical results, it has been confirmed that the 
proposed cognitive engine appropriately optimizes the 
transmission parameters for a given weight vector describing 
the transmission scenario. To implement a cognitive engine, 
it is also required to optimize the weight vector w  as well as 
the transmission parameters, which is our future research 
topic.
