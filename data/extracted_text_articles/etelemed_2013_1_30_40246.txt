Abstract— Mobile ECG recordings are widely used to monitor 
abnormality of the cardiovascular system during daily life. 
However, ambulatory ECG recordings are often contaminated 
by many types of artifacts. In motion artifacts removal, 
because ECG and movement are not always independent, ICA 
based noise reduction may distort the signals. Thus, this paper 
introduces automatic noise detection and removal technique 
based on independent component analysis (ICA) preventing 
the signal distortion and attenuation. Using several proposed 
decision rules, 3-channel ECGs are analyzed their noisiness 
and Gaussianity to predict whether motion artifacts and ECGs 
can be separated and reconstructed without distortion. This 
method is evaluated by ECGs recorded during 0 to 7km/h rest, 
walking, and running exercise. Finally, its performance is 
compared to the conventional approaches of ICA-based noise 
reduction in ECGs. As results, the reconstructed ECGs by the 
proposed algorithm show higher correlation with estimated 
reference signals and there is no distortion in reconstruction of 
the signals.

 INTRODUCTION 
Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring provides useful 
information to diagnose, evaluate, and treat cardiovascular 
related diseases. Conventionally, patients visited hospital, 
where the measurement devices and the physicians are 
available, to acquire the ECG for detecting abnormality of 
the cardiovascular system. However, this approach involves 
temporal and spatial limitation for the measurement, because 
it is only possible when patients visit the hospitals. For this 
reason, many portable devices measuring the signal everyday 
have been researched and commercialized. But, it still has 
challenge, the ECG recording is exposed to many types of 
environmental noise such as power-line interference and 
motion artifacts in long-term acquisition. Furthermore, in 
many cases of the ECG analysis, manual classification 
between motion artifacts and other events such as arrhythmia 
by cardiologists is intensive and time-consuming task [1]. 
Overcoming the limitation, many noise reduction algorithms 
have been introduced and applied to the ECG recording. The 
technique of adaptive filter for motion artifacts removal, 
which uses acceleration signals as references, has widely 
applied for the ambulatory ECG measurements [2-3].  
However, low correlation values between complicated body 
movements during activities and acceleration signals restrict 
the use of the techniques. Independent component analysis 
(ICA) [4] has provided an effective method in the application 
of motion artifacts cancellation by assuming ECG and 
motion artifact are independent [5]. Practically, multi-
channel ECGs with motion artifacts (mixture signals) are 
decomposed to motion artifacts and ECG components 
(source signals) which are relatively high correlated among 
each channel based on the matrix that maximizes the non-
Gaussianity of mixture signals. Thus, the noise removal in 
ambulatory multi-channel ECG recording is possible by 
elimination of one source signal that is estimated to motion 
artifact. Applications of the ICA for motion reduction in 
ECG recordings have been introduced in many researches of 
which the algorithms automatically select and remove 
motion artifact in decomposed independent components [6-
7]. However, the ICA also has drawbacks. For the actual 
measurement, the motion artifacts and ECG are not exactly 
independent, i.e. cardiac dynamics such as heart rate and 
ECG morphology are affected by body movements for 
instance, Head Down Bed Rest maneuver [8]. Moreover, the 
ICA is limited on non-Gaussian random variables. Thus, in 
the case of mixture signals which follow the Gaussian 
property, applying the ICA is not suitable, further it might 
cause 
signal 
distortion 
by 
eliminating 
meaningful 
information. 
This paper is motivated by the above challenges: 1) 
automated noise detection from the acquired ECGs 2) 
automatic motion artifact component selection and removal 
from decomposed signals considering interdependency 
between ECG components and motion artifacts, 3) prediction 
of whether the multi-channel ECGs with motion artifacts can 
be decomposed or not before applying the ICA. In this paper, 
we present automated motion artifact removal algorithm 
based on ICA, which prevents reconstructive distortion and 
considers correlation between multi-channel ECGs and 
motion artifacts with several decision rules.

Noise detection is the first layer that filters unnecessary 
signals, such as clean ECGs. To check the signal status 
predicts whether the motion artifacts and ECGs will be 
separated by the ICA or not. It is based on properties of the 
ICA. Through this process, we can avoid signal distortion 
which the necessary component is removed in the 
reconstruction process. After the ICA, estimated motion 
artifacts which show low cross correlation coefficient 
among the components are eliminated. Then, finally we can 
observe de-noised ECG signals.

A. Data Collection 
The data was acquired from the portable device that is 
attached on the subject’s chest. 3-channel ECGs (Lead1, 
Lead2, v2) were recorded simultaneously from 5 healthy 
subjects (5 male, 28.2±2.68) during the rest, 2, 4, 5km/h 
walking and 6, 7km/h running on a treadmill. Every exercise 
trial contains 5 seconds recording in rest state. Each 
experimental data was acquired over a minute with 500Hz 
sampling rate and transferred to the PC using the Bluetooth. 
The measured data were segmented by the corresponding 
data in 5 seconds. The proposed algorithm was applied to 
each segmented data.  
B. Noise Detection 
ECG shows different characteristics depending on 
patients. Furthermore, motion artifacts are differently 
influenced to the ECG recordings. Therefore, the noise 
detection should be accessed with individual property. Here, 
we compared ambulatory ECGs to the reference ECGs that 
were recorded before the exercise.  
The Central Limit Theorem explains that the distribution 
of a sum of random variables tends toward a Gaussian 
distribution [4]. Therefore, ECGs during the exercise which 
contains motion artifacts are closer to Gaussian distribution. 
Thus, using negentropy (explained in section C.) which is 
one measure of non-Gaussianity, rest ECGs and ambulatory 
ECGs are compared. Proposed decision rule for detecting 
noisy ECG is as follows: 
  
 
C. Gaussianity 
The fundamental limitation in the ICA is that the 
independent components must be non-Gaussian [4]. Eq. (2) 
shows joint density of x, y which are Gaussian variables with 
zero mean and unit variance.  
 
 
 
In this case, the density is symmetric. Therefore it does 
not contain any information on the directions of the columns 
of the mixing matrix A [4]. 
The classical measure of non-Gaussianity is kurtosis, the 
fourth-order moment defined by 
 
 
 
Kurtosis is zero for a Gaussian random variable. However, it 
can be very sensitive to outlier [4, 9].  
Negentropy which is based on informatics is another 
estimation of non-Gaussianity defined by Eq. (4).  
 
 
 
where, xgauss is a Gaussian random variable of same 
covariance matrix as x. However, its computational 
complexity, some approximations are used. Here, we 
adapted the approximation developed in [10]: 
 
 
 
G is selected that have proved very useful: 
 
 
 
The main purpose of the Gaussianity check is to give 
limitation for the suggested algorithm to eliminate chances 
that ECG components would be removed on the de-nosing 
process and the signals distorted. If the random variable is 
Gaussian, negentropy is zero. Thus, we give threshold 
of .00005 for the second rule. If the approximation of 
negentropy for each ECG is lower than the threshold, the 
signal is regarded as Gaussian, then the algorithm stops 
processing and returns the original ECGs.   
D. Whitening 
 Whitening is a useful pre-processing before the ICA 
obtaining de-correlated data. In other words, covariance 
matrix of the de-correlated data equals the identity matrix.

One popular method for whitening is to use eigenvalue 
decomposition.  
In probability distribution aspect, de-correlation means 
probability distribution spreads out of mean value. Thus, we 
can decide whether mixture signals of ECG and motion 
artifact would be decomposed or not, by observing whitening 
results. Decision rule is as follow: 
 
 
 
E. ICA 
The ICA provides solution to find independent source 
signals s from the mixture signals x. It could be expressed as 
a linear equation with vector formation: 
 
 
 
where, S is source signals, X is observed mixture signals and 
A is transformation matrix. The idea of ICA is simple that S 
is statistically independent.  From the Eq. (9), its inverse 
form is acquired:  
                            
 
 
where, W is inverse of A matrix. With the assumption of 
ICA, W matrix should be set in direction to maximize 
independency of X. It means that W matrix is updated to 
maximize non-Gaussianity of mixture signals. There are 
several approaches in ICA such as Fast-ICA and Joint 
Approximate Diagonalization of Eigen-matrices (JADE) 
algorithm. Here, we chose JADE algorithm which consists of 
orthogonalization and rotation with advantage of avoidance 
convergence problem, fast processing and efficiency [11-13]. 
F. Noise Channel Selecion and Denoising  
After the ICA, motion artifacts channel selection is 
required from the independent source signals to remove 
unnecessary component for the ECG reconstruction. Because 
motion artifacts have low correlation with ECG, it can be 
selected by Eq. (10).  
 
 
 
Basic assumption of motion artifacts removal using ICA is 
that motion artifacts and ECG are independent. Therefore 
both signals should be completely separated under the 
condition. However, because the movements influence 
cardiac dynamics, it cannot be said ECG and motion artifacts 
are always and fully independent. Fig. 2 shows the in-
dependent components decomposed by the ICA. In Fig. 2 (a), 
estimated motion artifacts and QRSs are not completely 
separated. To overcome this problem, we applied the high 
pass filter with cutoff frequency 15Hz to selected channel 
instead of which motion artifacts component set to zero.

G. Analysis 
A major problem of ECG signal processing is that it is 
almost impossible to measure ECG and motion artifacts 
separately during the movement. Thus, even though ECG is 
de-noised by the certain motion removal technique, 
quantitative analysis is limited without the reference signal.  
In ensemble average, N sets of data are averaged together 
with fixed time t to reduce random fluctuations in the signal. 
From the measured ECGs in each trial, R-peaks are manually 
marked and set to central position of the ensemble with the 
size of 501 samples for each channel of ECG. R-peak-
centered ensembles are averaged to acquire representative 
ECG waveform which regarded as the reference signal.

Fig. 3 shows the results of the ensemble average for 
ambulatory ECGs. By the average, motion artifacts which 
show random fluctuation property are attenuated and 
relatively regular and deterministic ECGs remain. Thus, we 
regard the ensemble averaged signal as the reference for the 
trial and compute cross correlation coefficient among the 
reference signal and the results of signals based on proposed 
and conventional methods.

Table 1 presents the mean value of cross correlation 
coefficients among estimated reference signals and the 
processed signals that were followed each processing path. 
‘Reconstruction’ means the ECGs were noisy, non-Gaussian 
and, sufficiently whitened, thus, ICA was applied to remove 
motion artifacts. ‘Low Gaussianity’ means that the measured 
signals were noisy but, followed the Gaussian distribution. 
Therefore, ICA was not applied and the original signals were 
returned. Likewise, in the case of ‘Insufficient Whitening’, 
the algorithm moves onto the next segment data. The results 
arranged for the proposed algorithm (Prop.), conventional 
method (Con.), modified conventional method (mCon.) 
which is based on conventional method, but estimated noise 
vector is filtered by 15Hz BPF, not set to zero, and ‘cProp.’ 
which is based on the Prop., but estimated noise vector is set 
to zero. Thus, the results belonging to the ‘Low Gaussian-
Prop.’ and ‘Insufficient Whitening-Prop.’ present cross 
correlation coefficients between the original signals and 
estimated reference signals. On the Table 1, reconstructed 
ECGs from our method show high correlation with the 
estimated reference signals with low variance. Fig. 6 shows

Fig. 7 presents processed ECGs that is applied two 
different methods. ECGs on the left side were processed 
through the proposed algorithm. Even though the signals are 
slightly noisy, because the each ECG follows the Gaussian 
distribution, the ICA is not applied for the signals. On the 
other hand, ECGs on the right side were applied the ICA 
without any decision rules. After the ICA, the component 
which has the lowest kurtosis value is estimated to the noise 
component and set to zero. Then, necessary component can 
be eliminated. Finally, reconstructed signals are distorted as 
shown in Fig. 7. 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
In order to evaluate our propose algorithm, ambulatory 
ECGs were acquired and applied, and the algorithm is 
compared with several methods including normally used 
algorithm. Since our goal was to eliminate the motion 
artifacts in ECGs without distortion, several decision rules 
were applied and evaluated their efficiency. 
The ICA is popular blind source separation technique 
which has provided reliable solution for noise reduction 
problem in the ECG. According to the ICA, observed signals 
are separated to the independent sources by decomposing 
the mixture signals with direction to maximize non-
Gaussianity. One important characteristics of the ICA is that 
the method is restricted to Gaussian random variable. 
Traditional assumption in ECG de-noising is that ECG and 
motion artifact are statistically independent corresponding to 
basic assumption of the ICA. However, movements 
influence to cardiac dynamics, thus it is not always satisfied. 
Furthermore, ICA based motion removal algorithm may 
distort ECG signals by eliminating important components.  
Thus, we proposed 4 decision rules to avoid above limitation. 
Noisiness 
and 
Gaussianity 
were 
considered 
by 
approximation of negentropy which shows zero for the 
Gaussian random variable under condition of the Central 
Limit Theorem. Because the distribution of a sum of random 
 
 
variables 
follows 
a 
Gaussian 
distribution, 
if 
the 
approximation of negentropy for ECG during exercise is 
decreased compared to the signal during rest, the segment of 
the signal regarded as noisy signal. Also, if the 
approximation of negentropy closes to zero, it is considered 
to the Gaussian variable. Under this condition, the algorithm 
regards it as out of processing range, and moves onto next 
segment of data.  
Whitening is useful processing before the ICA. Through 
the process, observed random vector is uncorrelated and its 
variance equals unity. In the probability distribution aspect, 
it means that the distribution moves outside of mean value. 
If the distribution of the whitening result shows similarity 
with the distribution of the input random vector, it can be 
said vector is already uncorrelated. In this case, the 
algorithm also decides to stop processing and starts with 
next segment of data.  After the ICA, motion artifact 
component was found using cross correlation coefficient. 
The channel which has the lowest correlation with each 
other was selected and filtered. To consider motion artifact 
and ECG were not perfectly separated, we applied HPF to 
selected component, not set to zero.  
The algorithm was compared with several approaches to 
evaluate implications of the proposed method such as 
applying filter and decision rules. One of important 
problems in ambulatory ECG analysis is absence of 
reference signal. In this research, R-peak centered ensembles 
were generated and averaged data regard as the reference 
signal of each trial. Ambulatory ECGs in Fig. 3 are highly 
contaminated with motion artifacts (on the left side), but 
most of noise component are eliminated on the averaged 
signals (on the right side).  
For the results shown in Table 1, our proposed method 
showed higher correlation with the reference signal. In some 
results presented better results than our algorithm, such as 
result from S1 using modified conventional method 
(‘mCon.’). However, stability which is based on variation of 
the results for the all results proves the proposed algorithm

covers large range of movements for various subjects. The 
results ‘Low Gaussian-Prop.’ means cross correlation 
coefficient between observed ECGs and reference signals, 
because the algorithm detected the signals are Gaussian 
variables and returned original signals. These results can be 
regarded standard for ‘Low Gaussian- ’. Thus the results that 
are lower than this standard are explained that ECGs were 
distorted by the applied method such as ‘Low Gaussian-
Con.’ of the subject 3. Also, there are the results that have 
high variation among the channels, such as ‘Low Gaussian-
Con.’ of the subject 4. It is considered that the necessary 
components were eliminated during de-noising shown in Fig. 
7, for instance.  
It is not sufficient to compare the processing results with 
only one parameter. Therefore, it is needed to establish 
parameters which measure the degree of distortion. 
In summary, we proposed motion artifact removal 
algorithm using the ICA that minimizes distortion. It is also 
expected to reduce processing rate by jumping over 
unnecessary processes. Moreover, the method which is 
based on short-term segmented dataset offers potential for 
real-time processing this algorithm. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
In summary, proposed method successfully removed the 
motion artifacts in ambulatory ECGs without distortion. 
Furthermore, reconstructed ECGs processed by this method 
showed higher correlation with the estimated reference 
ECGs than the signals processed by other methods. Because 
the proposed algorithm jumps over unnecessary process, it is 
expected to reduce processing rate. In addition, the method 
which is based on short-term segmented (5 seconds) dataset 
offers possibility for real-time processing of ECG. Finally, 
the proposed algorithm has potential to be applied for long-
term ECG monitoring in daily life.
