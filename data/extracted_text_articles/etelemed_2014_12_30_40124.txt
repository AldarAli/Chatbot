Abstract—Falls in older adults are a major clinical problem
often resulting in serious injury. The costly nature of clinic-based
testing for the propensity of falling and a move towards home-
based care and monitoring of older adults has led to research
in wearable sensing technologies for identifying fall-related pa-
rameters from activities of daily living. This paper discusses the
development of two algorithms for identifying periods of walking
(gait events) and extracting characteristic patterns for each gait
event (gait features) with a view to identifying the propensity
to fall in older adults. In this paper, we present an evaluation
of the algorithms involving a small real-world dataset collected
from healthy adults in an uncontrolled environment. 92.5% of
gait events were extracted from lower leg gyroscope data from
5 healthy adults (total duration of 33 hours) and over 95% of
the gait characteristic points were identiﬁed in this data. A user
interface to aid clinicians review gait features from walking events
captured over multiple days is also proposed. The work presents
initial steps in the development of a platform for monitoring
patients within their daily routine in uncontrolled environments
to inform clinical decision-making related to falls.

INTRODUCTION
The global population is ageing - the proportion of the
population over 60 years of age has risen from 8% in 1950
to 11% in 2009, and is expected to dramatically increase to
22% in 2050 [1]. This trend will place an enormous burden
on healthcare systems and the instantiation of a proactive,
preventative approach to delivering healthcare is gaining recog-
nition. Falls are a major problem amongst the older adult
population and can lead to injury, hospitalization, restricted
mobility, and institutionalization [2]. Falls in older adults have
been estimated to cost in the region of U.S. $20 billion per
year [3]. The instrumentation of standard clinical tests has
been shown to discriminate between fallers and non-fallers
[4], [5]. However, as clinic-based testing is costly and often
performed infrequently, research is beginning to focus on home
and community-based technologies. Such technologies would
provide insight into the variability in daily activities over
extended periods. This paper focuses on the development of
technology which translates the assessment of gait from a
clinical to a home/community based setting.
Technologies for home-based gait monitoring can be di-
vided into two categories: non-contact technologies and wear-
able sensors. Non-contact technologies range from image-
based techniques (e.g. the Microsoft Kinect platform [6]) to
sensorised ﬂoors (such as the GaitRite [7] walkway or The
ELSI Underﬂoor Sensing Laminate by Marimils Oy [8]).
Image-based systems have the limitation of not catering well
with the changing orientation and/or position of the person
or the inability to capture gait data for the entire day as
the person moves between different locations. Additionally
image-based systems have privacy concerns. While sensorised
ﬂoor systems may provide a high level of detail, often these
systems are expensive to deploy and require specialist expertise
to install. Motion sensor based platforms, such as Passive
Infra-Red (PIR) sensors, can capture variations in transition
times between locations in an unobtrusive fashion, however
the gait metrics derived for such systems are generally limited
to gait speed measurements and their diurnal variations [9].
Wearable technologies are generally composed of inertial
sensors (including accelerometers and/or gyroscopes) applied
to various locations on the body (such as the waist or on
the lower shanks). Wearable sensors have been shown to
derive multiple gait parameters (such as stride length) from
walking events (known as gait events) through identifying the
repeating gait characteristic points of the gait cycle (such as
initial contact point). In many cases wearable sensors have
extracted the gait characteristic points using angular velocity
(captured via a gyroscope) and/or linear acceleration data, from
inertial sensors (often placed on the legs) [10], [11]. To date,
a number of gait feature extraction algorithms have focused
upon gyroscope data which quantiﬁes rotation in multiple axes,
and is therefore less dependent on the exact positioning of
the sensor [12]. Wearable inertial technologies may provide a
high utility (in terms of the number of gait features they can
report), however they also require the conscious participation
of the user (for example in applying the sensors daily). As
such the successful instantiation of wearable sensors over
extended term deployments may prove challenging. In contrast,
wearable inertial sensors continuously extracting gait features
can monitor and quantify longitudinal variability in gait, and
this may provide a greater clinical insight into why falls occur
than a single clinic-based falls assessment.
Inertial sensor technologies have recently been investigated
for their suitability for extended deployments in home and
community settings [13]. While clinic-based data collection
and analysis platforms are becoming more stable, signiﬁcant

challenges exist when moving towards the real-world [14].
For example, data collection in uncontrolled environments
requires stable and extensively tested platforms requiring
minimal user interaction, with the added complexity of data
being transferred seamlessly to central servers. Analysis will
likely be subsequently performed on the collected data with
results made available for later examination by users, carers
and/or clinicians. In the context of gait data, this challenge
is made more difﬁcult through the highly variable nature of
real-world gait data; users may only walk for limited periods
of time, those walking events may be short in duration, the
environment may affect the nature of the gait cycle, and
the persons own gait cycle may change throughout the day
(perhaps across different environment, through tiredness, from
diurnal variations and/or the effect of medications taken at
different times throughout the day). Potential clinical beneﬁts
lie in bringing gait information together with contextual details,
as demonstrated through associating images with gait data
[13]. Furthermore, making this gait information accessible to
clinicians through an interactive interface is crucial to the
success of the system. This interactive tool must be easy to use,
present meaningful data in a format that is easily interpretable
and support the clinician in querying the data so as to inform
an appropriate intervention.
This paper discusses the development of a platform which
identiﬁes gait events in continuous inertial data from wearable
sensors, extracts gait features for each of these events, and
presents this information to a clinician through a simple
interface. A signiﬁcant contribution of this work is that it
pertains to the application of gait feature extraction on real-
world data, and uses adaptive algorithms designed to allow for
intra- and inter-individual variations. This system is evaluated
using data collected from a healthy adult cohort. Future work
will evaluate this system with an older adult cohort. This study
design has been chosen in order to minimise any technical or
user acceptance issues before involving a sensitive older adult
cohort. The ﬁrst algorithm analyses long duration (typically
over 6 hours) gyroscope signals across 5 healthy adults,
recorded in an uncontrolled environment during a routine day,
to detect possible gait events. The second algorithm augments
an adaptive gait feature extraction approach [11] to work on
gait cycle signal shape, identiﬁes the gait characteristic points
and subsequently calculates commonly reported gait parame-
ters. Results from an evaluation of the algorithms using data
from healthy adults is presented along with a proposed user
interface to feed back gait parameters for walking segments
performed throughout the day to a falls specialist.
II.
BACKGROUND
In a recent review, Taraldsen et al. [15] surveyed a number
of papers examining physical activity in older adults, all
using accelerometers, over durations longer than 24 hours.
Studies were broadly divided into two areas: Activity Counts
(reporting energy expenditure and/or intensity of activity) and
Activity Recognition (reporting stepping or walking events,
posture, and/or transitions). It was noted that in order to
compare across studies there is a need for a consensus in
both activity monitoring protocols and also the variables (in
this case, gait features) reported. As described brieﬂy in
Section I, both the technologies and methods by which gait
features are derived varies widely. The diversity in gait feature
extraction algorithms is evidenced in a systematic review using
inertial sensors by Yang et al. [16]. Signiﬁcant effort has been
undertaken to validate these gait features using clinical gold
standards. However, as gait monitoring moves from a stand-
alone clinical snapshot (taken no more than once per year)
to multi-day home-based gait monitoring, signiﬁcant technical
and person-centered challenges exist including the processing
of continuous gait data, feeding back the gait information to
clinicians and users, and the acceptability of the gait data
collection system.
In terms of moving towards data collection in uncontrolled
environments using inertial sensors, gyroscope-based features
of gait cycles have been identiﬁed from walking data by
comparing successive steps and extracting speciﬁc gait char-
acteristic points [11], [17], [18]. Four of these characteristic
points [19] (as illustrated in Figure 1) are relatively easy to
identify:
1)
Mid-Swing (MS) point: highest position of the leg
during the gait cycle;
2)
Initial-Contact (IC) point: initial contact of the foot
with the ﬂoor;
3)
Full-Contact (FC) point: full contact of all the surface
of the foot and the ﬂoor;
4)
Terminal-Contact (TC) point: terminal contact of the
foot with the ﬂoor before the next step.
Figure 1: Example of gait gyroscope signal from the left shank
over 7 gait cycles with annotated points 1) MS point; 2) IC
point; 3) FC point; 4) TC point.
Over recent years, several algorithms have been described
for the identiﬁcation of these characteristic points [11], [20],
[21]. In particular Sabatini et al [20] adopted an approach
using empirically-deﬁned signal values during experiments.
However, it was found that this was too dependent on speciﬁc
measurements, and not always feasible in everyday-life context
across varying environments and people. Subsequently, Lee
et al [21] adopted an approach focussing on ﬁnding patterns
within the gait signal and demonstrated this using a quasi real-
time analysis system. The system produced a high accuracy
and a small delay in detection of gait events. Greene et al [11]
used an adaptive approach to initially identify the MS points
and to subsequently identify the remaining gait characteristic
points (IC, FC, and TC). This approach allowed for varying
heights in the MS point which occur both between successive
gait cycles and also across different individuals. Subsequently

local minima and maxima were determined through ﬁrstly
ensuring they were of a certain range and subsequently ﬁnding
the peak and trough points.
After the characteristic gait points are found, a number
of gait features can then be derived. While the number of
gait parameters that may be extracted from the gait cycle is
large (for example, 130 variables were identiﬁed from falls risk
assessments using inertial sensors [22]), often only a subset of
these are commonly reported in the literature. These include:
•
Cadence: number of steps per minute.
•
Stride time: the time from IC of one foot to IC of the
next foot.
•
Coefﬁcient of Variation (CV) of stride time: ratio of
stride time standard deviation and stride time mean.
•
Stride length: distance covered between the TC and
IC points of the same foot.
•
CV stride length: ratio of stride length standard devi-
ation and stride length mean.
•
Stride velocity: stride length divided by stride time.
•
CV stride velocity: ratio of stride velocity standard
deviation over stride velocity mean.
As outlined above, signiﬁcant work has been undertaken in
the extraction of gait features from inertial data from wearable
sensors in clinic-based environments. However, limited re-
search has taken place in catering for the additional challenges
in moving towards gait assessment from uncontrolled real-
world environments (such as the home and community).

METHODS
The gait of 5 healthy participants (3M, 2F, mean age: 30
years old) has been measured using the SHIMMER wireless
sensor platform [23] placed on participants lower shanks using
an elasticated bandage. All participants worked in a research
environment mainly performing desk-based research and were
asked to continue performing their normal daily activities. The
participants were instructed to wear the sensors for as long
as was comfortable. The sensors were removed at the end
of the working day corresponding to a mean duration of 6.6
hours of data. Shimmer data were synchronized manually after
data collection. Accelerometer and gyroscope signals were
recorded at a sampling rate of 51.2 Hz and stored locally on
an SD card. The gyroscope data was low-pass ﬁltered with
a cut-off frequency at 20Hz using a 5th order Butterworth
ﬁlter. Gyroscope signals were post-processed off-line using the
MATLAB R⃝platform [24].
IV.
REAL-WORLD GAIT FEATURE EXTRACTION
Two novel algorithms are presented in this section. The ﬁrst
algorithm identiﬁes periods (or frames) of inertial sensor data
where a gait event has likely occurred. Subsequently, for each
frame of data, a second algorithm is applied which extracts
multiple gait features.
A. Identiﬁcation of Gait Events
Each frame of gait data is found by identifying a recurrent
signal peak corresponding to the MS point occurring over mul-
tiple gait cycles. Below, the steps of the algorithm are described
in detail. Figure 2 shows multiple gait events identiﬁed from
continuous gyroscope data.
Step I - LP Filter: The signals are low pass ﬁltered
with a zero-phase 5th order Butterworth ﬁlter with a 3Hz cut
off frequency.
Step II - Calculate the adaptive threshold: An adaptive
threshold is used to identify the MS point candidates in the left
and right gyroscope signals. Firstly peaks are found using the
derivative of the signal. The adaptive threshold is deﬁned as
an average of heights, in degrees/sec, of the top ten peaks and
scaled by 0.2. A minimum value of 40 degrees/sec is taken.
Step III - Group MS peaks to identify gait event: All
peaks above the adaptive threshold are found. Gait events are
grouped together as one event as long as two MS peak points
are not more than 4 seconds apart. Additionally, each gait event
must last a minimum of 15 seconds. This duration has been
chosen to ensure that only events where steady state walking
occurs are examined.
Step IV - Ensure left and right occurrence of gait
events: Identiﬁed gait events are compared between both
signals and MS peaks must occur consecutively.
B. Extraction of Gait Features from Gait Events: Framing
algorithm
The extraction of gait characteristic points from the gy-
roscope data was performed using a modiﬁed version of the
approach used by Greene et al [11], as per Figure 3. Initially,
an adaptive threshold, proposed by Greene et al. [11] over
the entire gait event is found (step II) and used to identify
MS points (step III). Subsequently, a novel technique taking
advantage of the shape of the gait cycle signal, has been
adopted to identify the other gait characteristic points as shown
in Figure 4 (A). In order to ﬁnd the IC, FC and TC points,
the signal is windowed between consecutive MS points (step
III). The ﬁrst local minimum is deﬁned as the IC point,
subsequently a local maximum is deﬁned as the FC point, and
lastly another local minimum is deﬁned as the TC point (step
IV). Figure 4 shows an example of the gyroscope signal and
characteristic points during the ﬁnal phases of the algorithm.
Step I - LP Filter: A 5th order Butterworth low-pass
ﬁlter with cut-off frequency 5Hz is applied to the gyroscope
data to remove noise components.
Step II - Calculating the adaptive threshold:
The
adaptive threshold is deﬁned as per Greene et al [11] and is
calculated as:
th = 0.8 1
N
N
X
i=1
(ωMLi > ωML)
(1)
Where ωML is the mean of the medio-lateral (ML) angular
velocity signal and N is the number of samples occurring
above the mean.

through the described algorithm where the Roman Numberals
in the circles refer to the steps of the algorithm. Part (a) is
the gyroscope signal ﬁltered at 3Hz. Each identiﬁed gait event
is outlined by dotted rectangles. Part (b) shows the gyroscope
signal for the gait event occurring between 10060 and 10210
seconds. The black dotted rectangle delineates the entire gait
event identiﬁed. The shaded rectangle (slightly larger than the
black dotted rectangle) shows the edges of the gait event as
identiﬁed by the gait feature extraction algorithm.
Step III - Identifying the MS points: MS points are
deﬁned to occur above the threshold and the peak of the signal
above the threshold are identiﬁed as candidate MS points.
Candidate points occurring after 0.5 seconds are excluded.
Step IV - Frame the signal between consecutive MS
points: The 5Hz ﬁltered signal is framed between 2 MS
candidates and the highest peak in the frame is selected as
FC candidate.
Step V - Identify IC and TC points: The minima
occurring between the ﬁrst MS point and the FC point is
identiﬁed as the IC point and the minima occurring between
the FC point and the second MS point is identiﬁed as the TC
point. This process is repeated for each frame. For each point,
a window of data occurring on the 20Hz signal 0.1 seconds
either side of the point is extracted and each point is updated
to occur at the local minimum within this window.
Step VI - Artefact rejection: If any artefacts, identiﬁed
using the following list, were found, that data was removed
from the calculation of gait cycle parameters.
•
If the difference between IC and TC points is greater
than 2 seconds.
•
If the TC point is before the IC point.
•
If the TC point is before the FC point.
•
If the difference between two MS points is greater than
1.75 times the mean difference within that frame.
Step VII - Calculate gait parameters: A number of
gait parameters have been derived from the gait characteristic
points [11], [25] including walking time, number of steps,
cadence, stride time, CV stride time, stride length, CV stride
length, stride velocity, and CV stride velocity.

RESULTS
Tables 1 and 2 report results from the analysis of the daily
monitoring of the 5 healthy participants involved in the study.
Data was recorded for between 5.5 to 7.9 hours long (Table
1). In particular, participants 1 and 3 (with a length record
of 5.6 and 6.5 hours respectively) had the highest number of
gait events (27 and 25) and walking times (1413.8 seconds
and 1214.29 seconds). Participants 2 and 5 (length record
respectively 7.9 and 7.4 hours) had the lowest number of gait
events (15 and 7) and walking times (650.89 seconds and
566.78 seconds).
To evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm for gait event
identiﬁcation, a manual analysis of signals was performed,
thus providing a gold standard for evaluation. The algorithm
correctly identiﬁed 92.5% of all gait events. Such a high
accuracy is due of the adopted adaptive techniques that allow
the algorithm to correctly analyse signals in different gait
situations (e.g. different speed or walking time). Table 1 shows
also that globally the minimum walking time was about 20
seconds (when walking periods less than 15 seconds were
excluded) for all participants (except for participant 5 with
26.58 seconds), while the maximum registered walking time
was longer, for example participants 5 (197.10 seconds), 1
(178.50 seconds) and 3 (154.90 seconds) and shorter for
participants 2 and 4 (81.31 seconds and 90.88 seconds).
All gait derived parameters in Table 2 have been calculated
taking advantage of the identiﬁed characteristic points through
the Framing algorithm. The mean cadence was between 99.62
and 110.85 steps/min for participants 1,2,3 and 4. Participant
5 had the highest cadence with a value of 129.07 steps/min.
Concerning the mean stride time, participant 3 had the highest
average value (1.18 seconds) while the other participants
were all around 1.10 seconds. The mean stride length was
higher for participants 1 and 3 (1.20 and 1.21 metres), while
participants 2 and 4 had the lowest values (1.01 and 1.02
metres). Finally, the mean stride velocity was around 1.10 m/s
for all participants except participant 4 who had a value of
0.97 m/s. Concerning the coefﬁcient of variations, the values
were around 0.10% for the mean CV stride time and 0.5 for
mean CV stride length and velocity.
Gait information produced by these algorithms can be
overwhelming and difﬁcult for clinicians to interpret due to the
number of metrics reported, and their decontextualised nature.
A prototype user interface is proposed in Figure 5 to allow
clinicians user friendly access to information concerning daily
gait patterns. Such an interface allows the clinician to inter-
rogate gait data as required. General information concerning
the selected day (walking time per day and total activity per

CONCLUSIONS
This paper presents a platform that extracts gait infor-
mation from gyroscope sensors placed on the lower shanks.
The system automatically identiﬁes gait events, extracts gait
characteristic points for each event, and subsequently derives
gait features. The identiﬁcation algorithm accurately detected
92.5% of gait events from a day of gait data from 5 healthy
adults (total duration of 33 hours). Upon a visual examination,
the Framing algorithm successfully identiﬁed over 95% of
the gait characteristic points using gyroscope data from the
successive gait cycles within the gait events. A validation study
using a larger and more varied cohort is required to evaluate
the accuracy of the Framing algorithm. Further experiments
with older people (mean age >60 yrs) will be beneﬁcial
for the project as studies reveal that one in three adults
aged 65 and older fall each year. However this validation
will be difﬁcult as traditional approaches have been clinic-
based, and this may not translate well for uncontrolled home
and community environments. For example, the context of
where the person is walking may be very important (e.g. is
the surface uneven?) or other factors which may affect the
biomechanics of walking (e.g. what type of shoes are being
worn?). Additionally, longitudinal changes in gait may be
more important, and as such technologies which provide a
broad insight may be clinically useful (e.g. how has gait speed
changed over the past year?).

Figure 5: Clinician user interface for gait data
While the platform presented in this paper is applied to data
from healthy adults, on-going work is investigating applying
the methods to data collected in an older adult population
where it can be reviewed (post data collection) by a clinical
falls specialist. This system aims to present more contextu-
alized gait information, collected in home and community
settings, to support clinical decision making and inform falls
interventions, as necessary. Signiﬁcant challenges exist in the
further development of this system including extracting gait
features from individuals with an impaired gait.
We further plan to implement the proposed user interface in
a web-based system (accessible via secure connection through
laptop, tablet or smartphone) which could be accessed by both
physicians and patients with the aim of leading to better self-
management of the older population.
