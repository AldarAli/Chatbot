Abstract‚ÄîThis paper reports perceptual characteristics for 
multiple line-drawings using an ‚Äúactive-wheel mouse‚Äù and 
employing an ‚ÄúAfter-Recognition Go‚Äù presentation strategy. The 
active-wheel mouse is a mouse interface to which a finger-tactile 
interface is attached. The finger-tactile interface embodies an 
active wheel being rotatable in any directions, with any speeds 
and with any time durations, and the rotation provides slippages 
to users on their fingertip skin.  Users are instructed to accept the 
slippage stimuli as straight-line stroke motions with specific 
directions, velocities and lengths. A perceptual experiment was 
conducted: up to seven, straight-line strokes were presented to 
subjects, i.e., participants by the active-wheel mouse, and the 
strokes were drawings reproduced by the subjects. Next, the 
reproduced strokes were evaluated from the viewpoints of 
lengths, directions, velocities, and time durations. As a result, it 
made clear that the active-wheel mouse worked well for line 
drawing presentation.

I. INTRODUCTION  
Visually impaired persons utilize sensations other than the 
vision such as skin and proprioceptive sensations. For example, 
some handy-and-portable devices were proposed. For 
instructing arm motions, Tsuda et al. [1] and Causo et al. [2] 
proposed vibrotactile device. Norman et al. [3] proposed skin-
stretch device. Gwilliam et al. [4] proposed a skin stretch-
based tactile display in conjunction of a joystick-based force 
feedback, and Koslover et al. [5] combined a skin stretch-
based tactile display with vibrotactile and voice guidance. Ion 
et al. [6] proposed a tactile display to drag a physical tactor 
across the skin for instructing geometrical shapes. Tsagarakis 
et al. [7] proposed a slippage display to rotate two cones for 
instructing 2D directions. Moscatelli et al. [8] proposed other 
slippage display to rotate a ball for instructing 2D slippages.  
They provided motion information with tactors. However, 
they could not solve following problems: ‚ë† the number of 
physical properties to be presented was restricted in such the 
way that motion direction can be presented alone, ‚ë° the 
operating range was restricted in several millimeters. As a 
solution for the problems, the authors have presented an 
‚ÄúActive-Wheel 
Mouse 
(AWM) 
[9]‚Äù 
and 
an 
‚ÄúAfter-
Recognition Go (ARG)‚Äù presentation strategy [11].  
Towards a practical application of the AWM, we should 
know better the line-drawing perceptual characteristics. The 
perceptual characteristics can be evaluated by the outcome, that 
is, the reproduced strokes resulted from a series of processes 
from the stimulus perception, stroke recognition, and memory-
retention. In this study, the perceptual characteristics were 
examined for multiple-stroke line-drawings up to seven strokes 
through a psychophysical experiment. The remainder of the 
paper is structured as follows. The hardware and software of 
the system employed in this work are explained in Sections II, 
i.e., the authors‚Äô developed AWM, a line-drawing-stroke 
presenting strategy. Next, a stroke perception experiment 
follows the system descriptions. Practically, in Section III, 
perceptual characteristics of simple patterns of 1-, 3-, 5-, and 7-
strokes are presented. The paper closes with a conclusion and 
remarks for further developments. 
II. METHOD  
This section describes a hardware and software, i.e., a 
mouse interface and a line-drawing stroke presenting strategy. 
A. Active-Wheel Mouse 
An ‚ÄúActive-Wheel Mouse (AWM) is a renovated mouse 
interface: at the front of a mouse interface, a Finger-Tactile 
Interface (FTI) is attached as shown in Figure 1. In the FTI, a 
wheel is swiveled and rotated by two stepping motors 
(M15SP-2N and M25SP-6NK by Mitsumi Electric Co., LTD., 
Tokyo, Japan) as shown in Figure 2. The rotation and swivel 
provide a slippage on the user‚Äôs fingerpad with a velocity and 
time-duration: the velocity together with the time duration 
results in a slippage length. The wheel has a diameter of 20 
mm and a thickness of 6 mm (see Figure 3). On the wheel 
peripheral surface, raised dots are formed to enable slippage 
perception [9]-[11]: as for the raised dots, the height is 0.5 mm, 
and the diameter of the bottom circle is 1.7 mm. The dot 
interval was about 10.5 mm so that dots appear one by one on 
the fingerpad, which makes the slippage perceived [12][13].

B. After-Recognition Go Stroke-Presenting Strategy 
Multiple strokes were learned through two recognition 
stages as shown in Figure 4: (1) the first stage is for whole line 
segment patterns (i.e., motion loci), and (2) the second stage is 
for velocity variations (i.e., motion trajectories), in particular, 
the velocities were changed stepwise. In either case of the first 
or second recognition stage, the ‚ÄúAfter-Recognition Go stroke-
presenting Strategy (ARG-S)‚Äù [14] was employed in presenting 
each of the strokes as in the following. 
 
Figure 4. Two recognition stages for learning multiple-stroke loci and 
velocities. 
[Step 1] Subjects hold the mouse in their right hand. Then, 
they touch the wheel upper peripheral surface from 
above with their index-fingerpad. 
[Step 2] Finger-tactile interface swivels the rotating unit to a 
given direction and rotates the wheel with a given 
velocity and time duration: the velocity and the time 
duration determine a rotation angle. (See Figure 5 ‚ë†) 
[Step 3] While accepting the slippage stimulus, the subjects 
recognize the stimulus as a line segment in the 1st stage 
and as a constant velocity movement in the 2nd stage. 
(See Figure 5 ‚ë°) 
[Step 4]  The subjects drag the AWM so as to reproduce 
subjects‚Äô recognized motion. (See Figure 5 ‚ë¢) 
[Step 5] The subjects memorize the drag motion as a stroke. 
(See Figure 5 ‚ë£) 
[Step 6] Just after memorizing stroke, the subjects send a 
signal by pressing a button by their left finger. 
[Step 7] Return to [Step 2] till all the strokes are presented 
and memorized.

III. STROKE PERCEPTION EXPERIMENT 
This section describes a stroke perception experiment and 
presents line-drawing perceptual characteristics in relation to 
the number of strokes. 
A. Experimental Conditions 
Ten healthy right-handed males in their 20s (22~24; 
mean=22.6; SD=0.9) participated. The line drawings presented 
were from single to seven straight-line strokes (See Figure 6.). 
All the strokes were made by constant-velocity straight-line 
motion. The factors, i.e., the length, speed, direction and 
stroke-number and the factor-levels are shown in TABLE I.  
For each of the runs, the factor levels were randomly chosen, 
provided that corner angles are more than 30 deg.

B. Evaluation Values 
By connecting the start and end point, a secant was 
obtained for each of the actually reproduced strokes. Then, the 
length- and angle-differences between the secants and the 
desired strokes were used as evaluation values (see Figure 7):  
    Œîl = lsecant ‚Äì ldesired 
    ŒîùúÉ= ùúÉsecant ‚ÄìùúÉdesired 
In addition to these, the velocity difference of the mean 
velocity from the desired one is also employed as the third 
evaluation value: 
Œîv= vmean ‚Äìvdesired

C. Experimental Result 
Some reproduced line-drawings for the  drawing No. 7-1 
are shown in Figure 8. Even though much improvement is 
expected, they show a potential for rough sketches. For each 
of the 1, 3, 5, and 7 stroke drawings and for each of the 10 
subjects, the Mean Absolute Errors (MAEs) per stroke for the 
lengths, angles, and velocities of the reproduced strokes are  
shown in  Figure 9.  As the number of strokes increases, the 
elapsed times and their variances seem to increase. On the 
other hand, the errors of the length, angle, and velocity per 
stroke seem to be no difference in this experiment. That is, for 
the length MAEs (Figure 9 (a)), the angle MAEs (Figure 9 (b)), 
and the velocity MAEs (Figure 9 (c)), the sample means were 
calculated for the 1, 3, 5, and 7 stroke drawings, and they are 
shown by ‚ñ≠, 
‚ñ≥, ‚ñ°, and „Äá, respectively. Then, we applied a 
statistcal test, ANOVA, to all the residuals (the differences of 
the perceived values from the actual value). It was confirmed 
that there were no significant differences between the 
population means of the 1, 3, 5, and 7 stroke drawings: lengths, 
F(3, 309) = 0.73, p = 0.54; angles, F(3, 309) = 0.47, p = 0.70 ; 
mean-velocities, F(3, 309) = 1.01, p = 0.54 . 
On the other hand, the sample means of the elapsed times 
and the number of iterations were plotted by ‚óè and ‚ñ†, 
respectively in Figure 10. It is interesting to note that there are 
linear characteristics of the elapsed time per iteration and the 
number of iterations. It means that the elapsed times per stroke 
would not increase as the number of stroke increases (see „Äá 
in Figure 10). Even so, it is also noted that, since there must be 
some limits for human beings on the amount of information 
that can be memorized at a time, the elapsed time per stroke 
may increase in the much more strokes.

IV. CONCLUSION 
This 
paper 
presented 
multiple-stroke 
recognition 
characteristics using a tactile interface, i.e., an active-wheel 
mouse, and with an after-recognition go strategy. As a result 
of multiple-stroke recognition experiments using 1- to 7-stroke 
drawings with less than 100 mm of strokes, the followings 
were confirmed.  
(1)  The residuals (the differences of the perceived values 
from the actual value) of lengths, angles, velocities 
and elapsed times per stroke did not show significant 
difference between the 1- to 7-stroke drawings. The 
means of them were about 20 mm, 10 deg, and 10 
mm/s, and 6 sec, respectively. 
(2)  Elapsed times were proportional to the number of 
strokes of the presented drawings. It means per-stroke 
elapsed-times were almost remained unchanged even 
though the number of stokes increased.  
 
In the future, accuracy and efficiency are to be furthermore 
improved. Further extension of applicable scope is expected 
for curved strokes and accelerated strokes.
