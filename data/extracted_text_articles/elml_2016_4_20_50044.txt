Abstract—This paper provides an in-depth literature
review on situated learning and its conceptual model of
cognitive apprenticeship and their influence on learning in an
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) domain.
These are used as epistemological basis to reflect on an
intervention involving the translation of Wikipedia content
into Oshikwanyama, an indigenous Namibian language in a
high school context. This intervention follows a series of
research works on ways to engage and integrate ICTs in
African
indigenous
language
classrooms.
Cognitive
apprenticeship
principles
provide
participatory
units
of
analysis which help to explicate the socially mediated learning
process, in which all the elements co-contribute to learning in a
community of practice using interactive multimedia such as the
Internet. The paper argues that situated learning provides a
useful theoretical and analytical lens through which a set of
authentic activities – reflecting on the way knowledge is
constructed and used in real life – can be explored in the
classroom. Its key advantages seem to be access to expert
performances, modeling of the processes, providing learners
with multiple roles and perspectives, supporting collaborative
construction of knowledge through coaching and scaffolding.

INTRODUCTION
Learning environments are loaded with powerful digital
devices connected to the Internet, which have revolutionized
the way people interact, exchange messages, teach and
learn. The web increasingly features
“millions of web
pages, site-archives, portals, databases and much more for
ascertaining a kind of harvested-knowledge where learners
can learn by themselves to construct knowledge” [1]. E-
learning requires new skills, competencies and attitudes
amongst teachers who are the designers and developers of
classroom materials. This paper looks at the pertinence of
situated learning theory [2], and its model of cognitive
apprenticeship and its contribution to and implications for
ICT use in the language classroom.
This theoretical background follows a qualitative case
study aiming to investigate the use of Wikipedia translation
as an additional teaching and learning tool. The intention of
this study is to represent the complexity of Wikipedia
translation in an Oshikwanyama first language classroom,
by providing an in-depth representation of online translation
as a real-time activity and engaging learners in interactive
and collaborative learning mediated by ICT. We concentrate
on the impact that ICT tools have on learning, and the
motivation Wikipedia translation has on learners to learn
Oshikwanyama. The study involved 32 high school learners
who were involved in a survey on the accessibility to and
use of ICT devices in Oshikwanyama First Language (elml,
2012), a basic computer training for learner participants and
finally the Online Wikipedia translation project.
Therefore, the main aim in exploring this theoretical
framework
is
to
try
to
situate
eLearning
in
the
Oshikwanyama classroom as ICT integration across the
curriculum is stipulated in the Namibian ICT policy for
education [3] which maintains that teachers must try and
find contexts in which to integrate ICT and ensure that it
makes sense to learners so that they appreciate a new mode
of learning. This paper is divided into five sections. Section
two
reviews
literature
covering
the
ontological
and
epistemological frameworks of situated learning and the
model of cognitive apprenticeship. Section three discusses
the methodology of the study, and section four presents a
critical discussion of the
findings. The
final section
concludes the study.

LITERATURE REVIEW
This
literature
review
discusses
situated
learning
framework based on its ontological perspectives and its
model of cognitive apprenticeship and its influences on ICT
integration in the classroom with respect to the use of
Wikipedia translation.
i. Ontological and epistemological underpinnings
Situated
learning
stems
from
Vygotsky’s
social
development theory [4], [5], in which learning (including
language learning) is viewed as “the appropriation of
socially-derived forms of knowledge; which are constructed
through the exchange between persons and social and
cultural
circumstances”
[6].
“Situation”
encompasses
aspects of the physical, social and cultural environment,
including communication with peers during the learning
process [7]. In situated learning, knowledge and skills are
created in contexts that reflect how knowledge is obtained
and applied in everyday situations [3].
Situated learning maintains that “knowledge is not a
static symbolic representation, ‘stored’ in the brain of an
individual, it is situated, being a product of the activity,
58

eLmL 2016 : The Eighth International Conference on Mobile, Hybrid, and On-line Learning

context, and culture in which it is developed and used” [8].
Individuals, culture and languages are considered as a
whole, co-existing as joint members of the knowledge
construction
community.
ICT
integration
requires
knowledge to be constructed through the interactions of the
students
within
their
corresponding
socio-cultural
environment. ICT tools that include the use of computers
have the potential to alter and replace traditional forms of
teaching and learning and serve as a vehicle for situated
learning [9].
Lave [2], asserts that in situated learning, “knowledge is
conceived as a set of tools stored in memory, carried around
by individuals who take the tools and use them … after
which they are stored away again without change at any
time during the process”. This relates well with the use of
ICT tools in the language classroom. ICT may be used as an
effective and attractive means of presentation, and more
importantly, as a way to facilitate peer interaction in and out
of the classroom. From the situated learning perspective,
“integration of technology into instruction does not just
mean to teach students how to use a piece of technological
equipment or to teach students by drill and testing” [10]. It
is rather a plan to use technological resources to assist
students to construct meaningful knowledge by creating
social, collaborative, inquiry-based activities and engage
learners in critical and higher order thinking.
The computer plays a mediating role, providing a
medium for linguistic and notational expression, especially
in the language classroom [11]. ICT plays a significant role
in
enhancing
social
interactivity
among
learners
and
presenting information/ideas effectively for easy processing.
This
further
means
that
ICT
not
only
enables
the
transmission of the teacher’s understanding to the students,
but it is a medium through which teachers and students'
understanding can be enhanced through social learning
activities.
In proposing their model, Brown, Collins and Duguid
[12] argue that meaningful learning will only take place if it
is embedded in the social and physical context within which
it is used. The core idea in situated learning is that learning
is inherently social in nature [13]. This means that in
situated learning, learning is shaped by the nature of the
interactions among learners, the tools they use within these
interactions, the activity itself, and the social context in
which the activity takes place. These core ideas of situated
learning are relevant for ICT use in the language classroom.
ii. Cognitive apprenticeship as a model for situated learning
Cognitive apprenticeship [14], [2], [3], is a model of
learning based on the situated learning theory. This model is
designed to “acculturate students into authentic practices by
practitioners in their everyday work” [14]. In cognitive
apprenticeship, learners collaborate with one another and
their teacher to reach shared understandings. According to
Lave [2], “Apprentices learn to think, argue, act and interact
in increasingly knowledgeable ways with people who do
something well, by doing it with them as legitimate,
peripheral participants”. Apprenticeship is not just a process
of internalizing knowledge and skills, it is the process of
becoming a member in a community of practice [15].
In
cognitive
apprenticeship,
(i)
learning
occurs
naturally through activities, contexts and cultures, (ii)
concepts taken from the natural contexts and applications
are taught, and (iii) more “apprentice-like’ examples are
presented [3]. This means that learning is seen as the notion
of the apprentice observing the ‘community of practice’. A
community of practice helps learners to participate in a
legitimately peripheral way, which allows them to have a
broad access to arenas of mature practice. As learning
happens the involvement in the culture increases, the
learners participate in what is called, a ‘legitimate peripheral
anticipation’ [2], [3] which enables them to progressively
gather the culture of the group and get the meaning of what
it takes to be a member.
Lave and Wenger [3], adopted Vygotsky’s Zone of
Proximal Development (ZPD) [5] in developing this model.
According to Vygotsky the ZPD refers to “the distance
between the actual developmental level as determined by
independent problem solving and the level of potential
development as determined through problem solving under
adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers”.
Cognitive apprenticeship requires that a more experienced
member of the community of practice is involved to plan
and manage the learning situation [13]. This provides an
opportunity for guided activities, which are offered in
collaborative learning environments. A more knowledgeable
other (the teacher or an experienced peer) and cultural
artefacts (ICT tools and language) are regarded as important
social components for communication.
The concept of cognitive apprenticeship can only
promote understanding of the theories of teaching with ICT
but it has little influence on the actual practice of using them
in daily classroom teaching. Li and Ngan [16], claim that
“teachers will never be competent in using ICT in teaching
and learning if they are not given the opportunities to
observe other more experienced teachers using ICT in
teaching”. In an intervention conducted at a Namibian
school,
to
use
English
Wikipedia
translation
in
the
Oshikwanyama first language classroom the teacher needs
to be knowledgeable in carrying out online lessons, time
managements and more especially if they want to complete
the lesson objectives, and be aware of cultural artifacts such
as the use of language and the Wikipedia translation toolkit.
Stages of cognitive apprenticeship
Five extended stages of cognitive apprenticeship are
proposed by Brandt, Falmer and Buckmaster (1993) as cited
in [13]. These are analyzed in sequential phases, in the
figure below:
59

eLmL 2016 : The Eighth International Conference on Mobile, Hybrid, and On-line Learning

Figure 1. Cognitive Apprenticeship as a model for
situated learning
Modelling is one of the strong attributes of situated
learning [1], [7]. Modelling assists learners in observing the
activity performed by an experienced member of the
community and
cognitively
to
allow the experienced
member
to
share
knowledge
with
the
inexperienced
members [9].
Thus, in cognitive apprenticeship, a teacher models the
expert strategies needed to execute the function effectively
e.g. the teacher demonstrates how to use certain ICT tools
such as the Internet to translate English Wikipedia content
and how to use different strategies in translating from the
source language to the target language and scaffolds
learners throughout the activity. Scaffolding in cognitive
apprenticeship, requires a modification of the learning
context to suit the individual learner or situation [13].
Scaffolding is collaborative in nature, it requires the task to
be located within the learner’s ZPD and gradual support of
the learners’ competence is essential.
Development of eLearning classroom environment for
Situated Learning
Situated learning emphasizes the idea that “much of
what is learned is specific to the situation in which it is
learned” [3]. In cognitive apprenticeship, learning occurs
while learners are working on tasks that are slightly more
difficult
than
those
they
can
manage
independently,
requiring the aid of their peers and instructors to succeed,
[17], [18]. Therefore, situated learning can be considered
experimental learning since learners learn by doing.
Integrating ICT in the first language classroom can be a
daunting task for teachers. Teachers may struggle to decide
on appropriate learning contexts, learning content and
learning strategies to carry out online activities successfully.
Situated learning may offer some of the most helpful
strategies to deal with the effective development of learning
situations.
Wikipedia
translation
is
an
activity
grounded
in
everyday situations such as traditional translation with pen
and paper in the language classroom, and the professional
translation or localisation
of the Internet content by
professional translators. Thus, it is learning that could be
transferred to other situations such as the Oshikwanyama
language classroom using the English Wikipedia content. In
this way, knowledge is transferred to similar situations, and
learning becomes a result of a social process which is not
separated from the world of action but exists in robust,
complex, social environments made up of actors, actions
and situations. Situated learning happens in a community of
practice [3]. Thus, the situated cognitive use of technology
could
work
best
in
complex
situations
that
require
transferring lower level skills to higher order thinking skills
as there are many players (teachers and learners) that could
contribute to the body of knowledge.

METHODOLOGY
This case study was conducted in a northern Namibian
school located in the Oshana region. The group that was
involved in this research study comprised 32 learners (21
girls and 11 boys) who are, (1) Grade 12 Oshikwanyama
First language learners, (2) doing both English Second
Language and Oshikwanyama First Language on the Higher
Level. The group was chosen because of their language
proficiency, which was necessary to carry out the translation
from English to Oshikwanyama. Although not all the
participants speak Oshikwanyama as their mother tongue at
home, they were all taught Oshikwanyama throughout their
schooling (from grade 1 to grade 12). In addition, two
language teachers at the school participated as co-observers
and reviewers of the translated Wikipedia texts/pages on
different occasions.
This Wikipedia translation project was conducted in a
large, well-ventilated computer laboratory, which consisted
of 32 computers and a printer. The data was created through
the translation of Wikipedia pages. The respondents had an
opportunity
to
translate
Wikipedia
content
into
Oshikwanyama First Language in groups of 3-4 members.
This was also done in two stages. Firstly, the participants
were given a two-day basic computer literacy course.
Afterwards the Wikipedia translations were carried out on
four consecutive days. The researcher as a participant
observer
facilitated
the
translation.
Daily
reflection
questionnaires were given to the participants to reflect on
daily translation activities and an in-depth focus group
interviews were conducted at the end of the translation
exercise for overall evaluation of the project.

IV.
FINDING AND DISCUSSION
This section presents the findings which a discussed
based on the characteristics or elements of situated learning
environments in which they were analyzed [19][20].
a.
Authentic contexts
Situated learning attempts to promote learning within
the nexus of activity, tools and culture through collaboration
and social interaction [12]. A physical and conceptual
structure of the classroom, which comprises different ICT
media was needed to facilitate the translation activity and
was presented for learners to explore. A Wikipedia account
was opened for their group, which gives the participants a
range of activities to choose from and which could be edited
at a time convenient to the learner outside the classroom.
Although learning should be organized in authentic
settings for learners to apply “abstract concepts and self-
contained examples” [14], the participants were optimistic
about translating Wikipedia content, thus concerns were
raised about the area of the learning context (i.e. online
material) versus the number of learners with computer
knowledge or background. Conversely, some respondents
felt that learning on Wikipedia was interesting because they
would gain knowledge about working with online activities
and they believed this would improve their performance.
The participants also observed that although Wikipedia
might be a good platform for learning languages and
translation activities in the classroom there were risks
attached. Some participants asserted that Wikipedia is a free
encyclopedia, and thus its content is not reliable because it
might be full of inaccuracies. It has transpired that during
the translation activity, some learners were not truthful with
their translation because they omitted and deleted relevant
information. The participating teachers commented that this
is risky in the classroom context, if the translation is to
become a classroom activity, this would lead to learners
failing. They pointed out that, when using activities like
Wikipedia translation, learners must be given strict rules and
a thorough explanation on assessment procedures. The
activities must be treated in the same manner as any other
classroom activity.
Time management was one of the contextual key issues
which the participants highlighted as a critical factor in
learning with authentic content in an authentic context. The
participants observed that doing a Wikipedia activity was
time-consuming.
b.
Authentic activities
Cognitive apprenticeship methods try to acculturate
students into authentic practices through activity and social
interaction in a way similar to that evident – and evidently
successful – in craft apprenticeship [12]. This means that in
innovative teaching such as web-based teaching, the focus is
placed on problem-solving, deliberate attempts are made to
generate meaning and show understanding of the nature of
the activity. Authentic Wikipedia activities, which are
readily available on the Wikipedia portal, were introduced
to the learners. Learners opened a Wikipedia account in
their groups, which enabled them to access a wide range of
online articles in English that they could edit and translate
into Oshikwanyama. Learners were given the autonomy to
select the articles that they wanted to translate, although
they were asked to look at articles within their own context
(Namibia, African people, countries or villages and articles
within their social circles (the country’s or continent’s
celebrities).
Thus,
the
activity
required
cooperative
engagement in the task and sustained thinking over the
process and strategies of translation, using ICT.
Although learners were given the freedom to choose
any article
they
wanted
to
translate,
some
of them
pronounced their dissatisfaction with authentic articles.
Learners came across some of the articles that were social
but not educational and unnecessarily long. Some of the
articles
chosen
were
written
in
advanced,
complex
languages, which many failed to translate adequately, and
which led to the meaning being mistranslated and message
distorted. The findings indicate that learners were concerned
about the value the article added to their education and
knowledge. Articles that were not deemed educational were
a demotivating factor, which they translated just for the sake
of finishing.
c.
Expert performance
Wikipedia translation is a new phenomenon in an
African first language classroom. As such, it needs to be
guided through expert thinking and modelling in order to
move learners from being less knowledgeable to more
knowledgeable. Learners need to have access to the
observations of real-life, real-time translation episodes being
performed
by
the
teacher
or
an
experienced
online
translator.
This Wikipedia translation project followed a spiral of
activities designed to ensure that learners understood what
was required of them. First, the two-day basic computer
literacy training introduced learners to key areas of focus,
with skills such as basic keyboard use, Internet searching or
browsing,
and
the
Wikipedia
portal
itself.
Thus
the
participants had an opportunity to work on the project
surrounded by experts in languages and in ICT, who guided
and supported them and in some cases demonstrated
learning and decontextualised instruction and strategies for
them.
d.
Multiple roles and perspectives
Situated learning provides the students with a chance to
generate their own solution paths in which they take on
roles as creative members of the community, who discuss,
reflect upon, evaluate and validate learning procedures
through
collaboration
[12].
In
this
project,
multiple
perspectives were provided in different ways. One way was
that learners were assigned to work in collaborative groups
61
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2016.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-471-8
eLmL 2016 : The Eighth International Conference on Mobile, Hybrid, and On-line Learning

in
which
each
learner
brought
his/her
perspective,
experience and understanding of using ICT skills and
language skills to the group. Another perspective concerned
ICT skills versus the language skills and translation
strategies among the participants and lastly, the participants’
overall views on the Wikipedia translation process and the
translation.
The whole design of the activity, the computers and
Wikipedia itself brought in that natural curiosity of learners.
Learners
usually
consult
Wikipedia
as
a
source
of
information on the Internet, or as an educational platform.
This activity enabled them to search for and contribute to a
wide range of knowledge collaboratively; in which the
opportunity
to
share,
debate,
create
or develop
new
knowledge was enhanced. Furthermore, learners got a
chance to get different perspectives on ICT and languages
from their peers. This enabled them to rely on the team’s
efforts because the successful completion of the task
depended on group cooperation, time management and the
translations strategies used.
e.
Collaborative learning
Collaborative learning
is
the process of students
working in teams to pursue knowledge and learning [7]. In
collaborative learning, information, ideas, and problem
solving are actively shared among the team members. In
situated learning, learners participate and become intimately
involved with a culture of learning, interacting with the
community and learning to understand and participate in its
history, assumptions, and cultural values and rules [3]. In
translating Wikipedia pages, heterogeneous groups were
organized with learners given the freedom to choose their
partners. To many, group work was a serious arena for
knowledge building and co-contribution to the translation
activity. One advantage was that the learners learnt by
articulation and negotiation of meaning, by which they were
able to let other group members feed them with the
knowledge and then they combined that knowledge to make
decisions on how to translate. Although, most of the
learners enjoyed working in groups, some were not satisfied
with their group performance. Individual preferences in the
group, time wasting were some of the disadvantages that the
participants alluded to.
f.
Reflective learning
A situated learning environment would require students
to reflect upon a much broader base of knowledge to solve
their problems, and this can be done when the student is
able to predict, hypothesize, and experiment to produce a
solution [17]. The translation was designed based on
authentic context and authentic activities that required
learners to reflect on their experience and beyond. Learners
were given a daily reflection task to note their views,
feelings and think about their strengths and weaknesses. In
addition, the interview conducted with them served as a
reflective tool that enabled learners to look back at the
activity they had just finished, and reflect upon learning
languages, using ICT and the motivation from engaging in
the Wikipedia translation exercise. Some learners were
excited about the whole experience and the outcome of the
translation, and wished that their parents or grandparents
could see and read their translation, because although it was
not a perfect translation, they wrote it in a way that anyone
could understand the meaning. This meant that even though
this was intended to be a classroom activity, learners were
optimistic about the diverse knowledge and understanding
that it could carry out there for other people to get
information in their own indigenous languages.
g.
Articulation of learning skills
Articulation is needed in situated learning in order to
enable tacit knowledge to be made explicit [19]. This
articulation is procedural in the ICT context such as the
Wikipedia translation where tools are used to produce
knowledge, and where a learner as a novice becomes an
apprentice to learning. In this translation activity, learners
were not only given an opportunity to interact with
computers, they were also given a chance to interact with
each other, and interact with the Wikipedia content that they
were translating. These learners had the opportunity to view
the task from different aspects and use different strategies to
translate the sentences. The activity was designed in such a
way that allowed learners to learn in a social situation
through group work, where they discussed the translation
and strategies and tackled the whole process collaboratively.
Many students were able to draw from their individual
experience (tacit knowledge) and use it to provide effective
strategies. They alluded to the way they tackled translations,
mostly focusing on the area of failure experienced in the
previous sessions.
h.
Coaching and scaffolding
Scaffolding learning advocates that people learn in a
community
of
practice,
where
learning
requires
development through ZPD [2]. This means that learners and
novice members of the community need teachers to provide
different forms of support for learning, through intrinsic
scaffolding and coaching [19]. Learners were allowed to
work in collaborative groups where more experienced others
could assist in the learning process. The presence of a
facilitator,
an
experienced
teacher
of
English
and
Oshikwanyama
who
has
advanced
ICT
skills
helped
learners to comfortably engage with the online activity. The
presence of an additional teacher also contributed to the
success of the translation. Learners were able to consult and
ask the meaning of the words that they totally failed to
translate. In some cases, learners asked for clarity when it
came to the spelling of words or using the website.
i.
Authentic assessment of learning within the task
Assessment involves the process in which learning
outcomes are assessed and evaluated. In teaching through
62

eLmL 2016 : The Eighth International Conference on Mobile, Hybrid, and On-line Learning

ICT integration, authentic assessment requires “student time
and effort in collaboration with others and, as with authentic
activities, requires complex, well-structured challenges that
involve judgment and a full array of tasks within the
assessment seamlessly integrated in the activity” [20].
During the translation, learners were involved in the process
of error analysis in which they were asked to identify
different errors. This helped learners to correct those errors
immediately and choose the most suitable/closest terms.
After learners finished with the translation, they were
involved in retrospective assessment in which they were
asked to read the passage (several groups 3 out of 8 read
aloud for the whole class) and then compared it with the
source text. In this way the whole group was given the
opportunity to judge their translation, check for accuracy
and its effectiveness in case it was decided that the
Wikipedia
translation
process
become
part
of
Oshikwanyama curriculum.
V.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we provided a qualitative analysis of
literature based situated learning and the model of cognitive
practices through the lenses of eLearning and Language
learning. The use of English Wikipedia translation into
Oshikwanyama was explored. The review indicates that, as
an educational platform, Wikipedia presents a good chance
of involving learners as apprentices into new and practical
learning in an authentic context using authentic content,
collaboratively. The adoption of situated learning ensures
the enculturation of beliefs and improved self-esteem of
learners. Furthermore, situated learning widens the zone of
proximal development (ZPD), helping learners to carry out
an activity and achieve learning in an ICT integrated
environment.
