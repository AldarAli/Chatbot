Abstract— In a freight station in Japan, the number of forklifts 
is determined experientially based on the  quantity of work, 
shape of a container platform and operating time. But, it is 
difficult to evaluate the appropriateness of the number of 
forklifts quantitatively. So, the author developed a simulator of 
cargo handling operations in freight stations, and studied 
influences of the fleet size on the works of loading and 
unloading. As a result, it was found that the waiting time of 
trucks for loading or unloading was correlated with operation 
rate of forklifts. The shortening of the waiting time of trucks is 
desirable from the point of view of customer satisfaction. In 
this paper, the author proposes a method to evaluate the 
appropriateness of the size of the forklift based on operation 
rate of forklifts.

 INTRODUCTION 
Rail freight transportation in Japan is mostly operated by 
Japan Freight Railway Company (JR Freight). Most of the 
lines that JR Freight uses are owned by passenger railway 
companies, and JR Freight operates their trains by making 
them wedged in between the operation of passenger’s trains.  
Japanese passenger railway is well known for its high 
density and punctuality, so that freight trains also must be 
punctual for arriving or departing time.  
Over 700 freight trains are operated on the average each 
day in Japan. Of these, about 400 trains are container trains 
[1]. The freight stations used to handle container trains have 
“container platforms” surrounding the tracks for loading and 
unloading containers, and containers are loaded onto trains 
from container platforms or unloaded from trains onto 
container platforms by forklifts(Fig. 1). Transportation 
companies that are commissioned to take care of the 
containers go to container platform and load or unload 
containers onto/from own truck there using forklifts.  
As large-scale freight station must handle over 50 trains 
(sum of arrival and departure trains) per a day,  schedule of 
freight cars and locomotives in such large-scale freight 
stations must be planned in detail. In addition, most 
transportation companies bring out their containers in a few 
hours from arrival of freight trains, and some companies 
bring in their containers just before a deadline. Therefore, 
handling operation becomes very complicated and difficult.

At Japanese freight stations, forklifts and other cargo 
handling equipment are used to load and unload containers. 
Up until now, decisions on how many forklifts should be 
assigned to a freight station have been based on experience , 
based on a number of cargo works, a shape of the yard, 
working hours, and so on. It is difficult to determine 
whether the current number of forklifts assigned is too large, 
too small or appropriate. Quantitative analysis for 
appropriate assignment of resources has been a challenge. 
Against such background, the author developed a simulator 
program that is capable of analyzing the impact of the 
number of forklifts assigned to a freight station against the 
loading operations at the station. This paper introduces how 
the simulator program is used to assess the adequacy of the 
number of assigned forklifts. 
 
JR Freight has introduced the system “IT-FRENS 
SYSTEM (IT FREight information Network System)” that 
integrates management of containers in 2004 [2]. By using 
this system, we can grasp move of containers and move of 
forklifts in a freight station. The author developed the cargo 
handling simulator based on analysis of these data.  
The behavior of forklifts has been studied in the domain 
of warehouse. These researches aim at creating efficiency 
of picking or optimizing layout of a warehouse [3][4][5]. 
Therefore, it is difficult to apply the results of these 
researches to Japanese freight stations. The loading in ship 
transportation has been studied for many years [6][7][8], but 
it is difficult to apply these study results to the railway 
sector because the feature of loading and unloading facilities, 
and the method of loading and unloading in ship 
transportation 
are 
different 
from 
these 
in 
railway 
transportation.  
II. 
 CLASSIFICATION OF CARGO HANDLING OPERATIONS 
AT FREIGHT STATIONS 
The author classified the cargo handling operations at 
freight stations using the operation histories of forklifts used 
at the stations. As shown in Fig. 2, cargo handling 
operations are classified into Main Operations (moving the 
container) and Support Operations (moving away containers 
above or in front of a container to gain access to the 
container). Furthermore, Main Operations are subdivided 
into Primary Operations (operations typically carried out 
from when the container is brought into the station up to 
when the container is brought out, which are outlined in 
Table 1) and Secondary Operations (rearranging the station 
premises and cargo stacks to facilitate the handling of the 
container). Frequencies of Support, Primary and Secondary 
Operations at a freight station are shown in Fig. 3. It 
indicates that Support Operations account for roughly 40%

of all operations and that there are only small variations in 
the ratio between Support and Primary Operations 
throughout the day. 
III. 
LIMITATIONS ON CARGO HANDLING 
Typical limitations on cargo handling are described below. 
A. Time-related limitations  
• 
The time specified in the yard operation plans (i.e., 
time for trains pulling into and out of the container 
platform) must be observed. 
• 
Waiting time of the forwarders’ trucks should be 
minimized to achieve customer satisfaction. 
• 
Appropriate sequence of cargo handling shall be 
taken into consideration, such as the flow of Primary 
Operations shown in Table 1, loading and unloading 
operations performed in the same area, etc. 
B. Limitations posed by variations of containers  
• 
Some sizes of cargo handling machines must be used 
in accordance with the size of container to be 
handled. 
• 
At most freight stations, storage areas of the 
containers are specified according to their sizes  
C. Spatial limitations 
• 
Support Operations need to be considered according 
to the current container storage status. 
• 
If the specified container storage space is fully 
occupied, excess containers shall be stored in nearby 
vacant space. 
• 
The container platform has only a limited space for 
moving and some areas have restrictions such as 
one-way traffic. 
• 
The cargo handling operations should be arranged so 
that the total distance travelled by forklifts is kept as 
short as possible. 
 
To estimate the appropriate number of forklifts that should 
be assigned to a freight station to properly perform cargo 
handling operations under the limitations described above, a 
clear picture of the operations of the forklifts in a given 
environment including the layout of the station, the status of 
the containers and temporal distribution of the cargo 
handling work needs to be formed. For this purpose, the 
author developed a simulator program. 
 
IV. 
DEVELOPMENT OF CARGO HANDLING SIMULATOR 
PROGRAM 
A. Modeling of freight station  
Container platforms are normally complex in shape as 
they are constructed around cargo handling tracks, which 
makes simulation difficult. Moreover, as the locations of 
container yards and the areas where forklifts can travel are 
restricted, the distance a forklift actually travels is not the 
direct distance between any two points. To overcome this, 
the container storage areas at a freight station were created 
in a multidimensional space by defining the time taken to 
travel between two storage areas as a corresponding 
distance in a Euclidean space. 
For each area, arrays for the number of containers that 
can be stored on that container platform, trucks and freight 
cars (if the area is served by adjoining tracks) were assigned.

The storage conditions of that area were explained by 
storing the container IDs in the arrays. The algorithm was 
designed in such a way that containers that were behind or 
beneath other containers could not be moved, and so that 
container IDs could not be stored in the train or truck array 
unless trains or trucks were available. For the latter, 
operation management data of trucks and trains is utilized. 
The modeling enables changes of container locations 
made by forklifts to be represented by changes of the 
relevant container IDs stored in the arrays. For example, as 
shown in Fig. 4, moving Container 3 to Area B of a freight 
car requires a Support Operation consisting of moving away 
Container 2 from in front of Container 3 as well as 
Container 4 from above Container 3. These location changes 
are represented by the relevant changes in the tables in Fig. 
4. 
 
B. Simulation algorithm 
The developed simulator program employs a time-driven 
algorithm for assignment of cargo handling jobs. The 
algorithm is shown in Fig. 5. The simulation utilizes not just 
the arrays of containers stored on the station premises but a 
database on the status of available forklifts and another 
database on the status of Main Operations. Changes on the 
station premises are produced by changing these data with a 
lapse of time. The Main Operation database is created based 
on input data. Each Main Operation job is given a ready-to-
start time. The arrival of a train or truck can be simulated by 
assigning the ready-to-start time to the time when the train 
or truck has arrived and cargo handling operation has 
become possible. Each record in the Main Operation 
database is time-sequence enabled to ensure a job (e.g., 
loading a container to a truck) cannot be started until the 
previous job (e.g., unloading an existing container from the 
truck) is completed. This can also be applied to Primary 
Operations in Table 1. 
Job assignment to available forklifts is determined based on 
a prioritized order of ready-to-start jobs, which is calculated 
based on job types, deadlines, wait time and other 
parameters, and the work areas of forklifts, which is 
calculated based on the distribution of cargo handling jobs 
and forklifts and the operation status of forklifts. The 
method of determine the priority order depends on custom 
and circumstance of each station so that we must prepare an 
expression corresponding to each station.

C. Verification of cargo handling simulator program 
The simulation program was verified using the actual 
data of a freight station. Data covering one day at the station 
was imported and a simulation was conducted for 
comparison between the actual data and the simulation result. 
Fig. 6 shows the frequencies of Main and Support 
Operations for each time zone. Fig. 7 shows the ratio of time 
spent moving containers out of the forklift operation time for 
both Main and Support Operations. Both figures indicate a 
good reproduction of the actual data. With the results, the 
simulator can be considered accurate enough for practical 
application to forklift fleet size evaluation. 
 
 
V. 
FLEET SIZE EVALUATION METHODS USING CARGO 
HANDLING SIMULATOR PROGRAM 
The simulator program offers the facility to increase and 
decrease a forklift fleet size and observe the results. Through 
a trial an  d error process with the simulator, it is possible to 
determine the size of a forklift fleet that offers efficient 
operation with minimum  idle time. The result can then be 
used to evaluate the current fleet size. However, performing 
such evaluation while changing the fleet size with hours can 
involve too many combinations to consider. Instead, 
simulation was performed to find out how average waiting 
time of forwarders’ trucks could be minimized. 
For this simulation, using actual facility data of a freight 
station, cargo handling jobs were randomly generated while 
the size of a forklift fleet was changed. The relationship 
between the operation rate of forklifts and the average 
waiting time of forwarders’ trucks is shown in Fig. 8. 
With a fleet of two forklifts, the average waiting time can 
be relatively long even when the operating rate of the 
forklifts is low, indicating the fleet is too small for the size of 
the station (i.e., too much time spent traveling between 
containers on the premises). With a fleet of three forklifts or 
more, the average waiting time starts to increase suddenly 
when the operating rate becomes around 80 to 90%. In other 
words, keeping the operating rate below 80% can be 
effective in preventing the waiting time from becoming too 
long. 
Keeping the 80% threshold in mind, it is possible to 
identify the time when the fleet size is too small or too large 
by calculating the fleet size that can keep the operating rate 
below 80% based on actual workload data and then 
comparing the result with the actual fleet size. (Fig. 9 shows

loading/unloading time

the result of calculation, in which the fleet size was 
changeable every 30 minutes.) By observing the actual data 
for several days to check if chronic fleet excess or shortage 
occurs at any time of the day, the appropriateness of the fleet 
size can be evaluated. 
 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
The author developed a simulator program to simulate 
the cargo handling operations at a freight station and 
proposed a method to evaluate the appropriateness of the 
size of the forklift fleet using this program. In determining 
the actual fleet size for an existing freight station, however, 
a range of parameters still need to be considered including 
operators’ work schedules and variations in cargo handling 
workload.
