Abstract— An underwater swarm network for monitoring and 
exploration applications is proposed. Specifically, the behavior 
for different application scenarios with the corresponding 
performance analysis is presented. The design of an 
underwater swarm is discussed considering that the main 
requirement is maintaining the nodes power consumption as 
low as possible, without any increase of latency in the network. 
Results show that both average power and latency can be 
preserved by considering a reasonable number of hops needed 
to forward information from source to destination. It is 
verified that the results are influenced by the nodes motion 
related to the swarm configuration. This study aims to provide 
some guidelines to develop an autonomous underwater vehicles 
swarm for underwater applications. 
Keywords – swarm; underwater communications.

 INTRODUCTION  
Over the past few years, a growing interest has been 
showed for the Underwater Acoustic Networks (UANs) [1] 
[2]. Several studies have been performed to overcome 
limitations due to underwater environment, being the UANs 
affected by different factors influencing performance 
requirements with respect to the terrestrial ones. Mainly, the 
temporal and spatial variability, in combination with poor 
bandwidth availability of the underwater acoustic channel 
lead to consider the communication range limited and 
dramatically dependent on both range and frequency [3]. 
First underwater experimental systems were performed to 
demonstrate the hardware capabilities and the possibility of 
underwater communication architecture [4][5]. 
Our study is directed to a particular UAN, the Swarm 
Underwater Acoustic Network (SUAN), that is a network, in 
which the communication paradigm is not a trivial challenge, 
because the traditional peer-to-peer communication among 
Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) devices, as 
described in [6], is not applicable. Moreover, the particular 
scenario that is investigated, such as surveillance scenarios 
with self-organizing capabilities of the network, leads to 
consider both control and data traffic within the swarm.  
Some studies have been performed for this scope, where 
Ad-Hoc networks [7], or cellular-type [8] networks have 
been considered to define the underwater network 
communication. Other studies consider the underwater 
network as a sensor network. In [9], for instance Fazel et al. 
consider the performance of a sensor network in terms of 
energy efficiency, even if their conclusions are not 
applicable to our case because they assumed a network 
composed of a large number of fixed nodes anchored to the 
bottom of the ocean for long period monitoring. The swarm 
configuration is instead characterized by an aggregate 
motion due to different modes operability, in which they are 
involved.  
The outcome of this study is the basis for swarm nodes 
design, in order to define an underwater network for both 
monitoring and alarm detection applications. A preliminary 
study has been performed in [10], where the challenges 
needed at the protocol stack of the AUVs members of the 
swarm were analyzed. In this work a deeper investigation on 
swarm nodes motion has been carried out, and how this 
could impact over network performance has been further 
investigated in terms of number of hops involved during the 
forwarding information activities. It is mandatory to maintain 
this parameter as low as possible to obtain twofold 
enhancements  
• 
to preserve the lifetime of the network: few nodes 
are involved in the forwarding and consequently 
their corresponding battery levels are conserved; 
• 
to reduce latency in the network: few hops are 
needed and then less time is spent for sending 
packets in the very slow underwater channel. 
 
The paper is organized as follows: a brief introduction of 
the considered application scenarios is provided in Section 
II, the system model is described in Section III, the test cases 
are described in Section IV, and the main results are showed 
in Section V. Finally, in Section VI, the main conclusions are 
drawn. 
 
II. 
UNDERWATER SWARM DEFINITION  
An underwater swarm network is characterized by nodes 
very close one to each other, with mobility capability. The 
structure of the network is that of a distributed network, in 
which the nodes, through the exchange of control 
information, will take decisions in collaborative manner. 
 This system will be able to work in two different modes, 
which correspond to two different application scenarios: 
• 
Environment Monitoring (Broadcast Scenario), in 
which the nodes perform measurements of proper 
parameters, measurements of shallow water in the 
port area and short range communications are 
considered. From a communication point of view, it

means that each node is able to communicate with its 
closest neighbor and to forward information towards 
a collecting node, which usually is a bottom node 
with could have also a radio equipment to 
communicate with a platform at the surface. 
• 
Alarm detection (Pipeline Scenario): the swarm 
detects an alarm occurrence, for instance a measured 
value of a specific parameter (e.g., oil in the water) 
is higher than a given threshold in a specific region, 
and thus, it will be ready to coordinate itself and 
move towards the area, in which the anomalies have 
been detected. From a communication point of view, 
it means that each node is connected only to one 
next node and all the nodes are allocated in a linear 
manner. In this case a heavy data transmission is 
assumed in a directional way. 
We remind that, a swarm is characterized by a more 
complex communication protocol than a peer-to-peer 
paradigm often applied to AUV devices, and thus the 
performance of the network will be strictly related to the 
solutions taken into account at each design level. 
 
III. 
SYSTEM MODEL  
We consider an underwater network of 10 swarm nodes 
located initially in random positions within a volume of 1000 
m×1000 m×150 m. Each node has mobility capability. All 
the nodes within a coverage range rcov from a given node are 
considered as its own neighbors. Generally, a network design 
is based on a suitable trade-off between the coverage radius 
of each component, and the available transmission power. In 
addition, to take into account real time data transmission 
(e.g., submarine video), also the latency constraints need to 
be 
considered. 
Furthermore, 
the 
particular 
mobility 
availabilities of the swarm nodes need to be analyzed. They 
have to move, in some situations, very close each to the 
other, and so interference has to be maintained as low as 
possible. From these considerations, we have found that all 
the possible solutions impact, at different levels, over the 
network performance.  
 
A. Mobility 
An important aspect to be considered is the nodes 
mobility, which determines the different applicative 
scenarios under test. A 3D model is considered: it is assumed 
that the position information are stored in all the nodes, and

Figure 1. Pipeline scenarios: low (a) and high dense (b) configurations. 
thus a perfect knowledge of exact neighbors’ positions is 
available at any time. The two proposed scenarios imply 
different algorithms to model nodes motion.  
Pipeline Scenario -  In this scenario the nodes move 
along the linear conjunction source to destination node. They 
may assume a dense or a sparse configuration, as depicted in 
Fig. 1.  
Broadcast Scenario – In this case, a control algorithm  is 
implemented able to elaborate an ellipsoid dimension, in 
which each node has to move inside. The ellipsoid 
dimensions are dependent on two parameters: the number of 
nodes, N and the maximum “dimension” of the swarm (e.g., 
the more distance nodes possible within the swarm), D.  
Afterwards, one of the nodes will be elected as the 
“center” of the ellipsoid (this choice could depend on the 
target of the swarm, as well as the final configuration 
selection, i.e., ellipsoid or sphere) and then, others nodes, 
located outside the ellipsoid, will have to move inside it.  
Each of those nodes will move towards the direction of 
the center of the ellipsoid as far as a distance rmin from the 
node to the surface of the ellipsoid has been reached. rmin 
represents the minimum physical distance, at which the AUV 
devices have to stay to avoid to crash one to each other. Even 
in this case, the nodes could stay very close one to each other 
(high dense configuration) or not (low dense configuration).  
A possible sequence of the algorithm states is depicted in 
Fig. 2. Note that, when the nodes have reached the ellipsoid 
(Fig. 2b), they form three sub-clusters around the two 
focuses and the center of the ellipsoid, respectively (each 
node will choose the closest of these points). To save power, 
a node stops when has reached a connection to one of the 
possible sub-clusters (Fig. 2c). After that, sub-clusters will 
join together by moving their extreme nodes towards the 
other sub-clusters. During this operation, if a node loses 
connection from its sub-cluster of origin, another node of its 
group will “follow” it. Iterating this operation will force the 
swarm to occupy the maximum possible area of the ellipsoid 
(Fig. 2d), without the use of a central control.  
 
B. Physical Layer  
For the Physical Layer technology, a system based on 
underwater acoustic signals propagation is considered.  
Compared 
to 
traditional 
AUNs, 
in 
SUAN 
the 
communication range is very short and can be vary from 3 to 
100 meters.  
In [10], to obtain a good trade-off between bandwidth 
and efficiency, an isotropic transducer operating at 300 kHz 
was considered. This value is higher than those used in 
traditional UAN, but at the same time implies a less harmful 
multipath effect. The modulation format adopted for acoustic 
shallow water channel is a Multi-Frequency Shift Keying 
(M-FSK) with M=4, 8 and 16.  This modulation format is 
more prone to contrast the multipath effects and can allow a 
low cost modem implementation. Generally, the Signal-to-
Noise Ratio (SNR) per bit can be evaluated as [7]

is a frequency-dependent term depending on the 
absorption coefficient α(f). The absorption coefficient for the 
frequency range of interest is calculated according to Thorp’s 
expression [11], expressed in dB/km and f in kHz.  
A packet is correctly received if the SNR (1) exceeds a 
proper threshold, which can be evaluated by considering the 
sensitivity level of the receiver. This value is obtained by the 
data sheets specifications of the transducers. Specifically, for 
our simulations, an ITC-1089D transducer has been 
considered. Its specifications are: Receiving Voltage 
Sensitivity (RVS) of -218 dB re1V/1µPa and Transmit 
Voltage Response (TVR) exceeding 148 dB re 1µPa/V@1m.  
C. Medium Access Control Layer  
Different solutions have been proposed in literature for 
Medium Access Control (MAC) Layer design [12]. For low 
data rate, with rare collision events, a very simple solution 
such as ALOHA scheme or its improved version, can be 
considered. In particular, we have assumed an ALOHA 
without interference phenomena. Future studies will be 
necessary to evaluate the effects of the MAC over the system 
reliability. Hence, a Collision Probability, Pcoll, will be 
included in the proposed model.  
D. Network Layer  
To design a reasonable swarm, two aspects need to be 
verified: energy saving and latency reduction. These 
requirements suggest to consider at network level a multi-
hop paradigm to forward data among the swarm in order to 
obtain a reasonable trade-off between the above mentioned 
opposite factors. The network performance can be thus 
expressed by the End-to-End Frame Error Probability (FEP) 
for a multi-hop route, which depends on the number of hops 
needed to forward information from source to destination.  
FEP can be evaluated as in [7], resulting

where Pb is the bit error probability for a single node-to-
node link, L the frame size in bits, and nh is the number of 
hops needed to forward data within the swarm. Obviously, nh 
strictly depends in what configuration the swarm is, and then 
by its geometrical characteristics. The bit error probability 
depends on both the modulation format and the propagation 
channel. An M-FSK modulation format over a Rayleigh 
fading channel is considered. Therefore, the Pb of an M-ary 
orthogonal signal can be expressed as [13]

IV. 
TEST CASES 
Performance analysis has been repeated for both the 
proposed scenarios. Different considerations have been 
carried out for each case, strictly related to the different 
mobility models that swarm can assume. Specifically, 
• Pipeline Scenario - AUVs place themselves along 
the linear conjunction between source to destination 
to forward information in efficient manner. 
• Broadcast Scenario - The swarm can assume two 
different geometrical shapes: Sphere or Ellipsoid. 
For each case, it is possible consider two  configurations: 
• Low dense configuration: AUVs assume a uniform 
distribution inside the limited area to maximize the 
swarm coverage area.

• High dense configuration: AUVs are located very 
close each to other. They are at the minimum 
distance permitted by their physical dimension.  
 
V. 
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS AND TRADE-OFFS 
Performance analysis has been carried out by Matlab [14] 
and system performance has been evaluated and compared 
with different test cases described in Section IV. More 
deeply, we have investigated the performance of the swarm 
network in terms of FEP according to [4]. We have firstly 
evaluated the FEP by considering the number of hops 
needed to reach destination by theoretical considerations in 
different test cases, taking into account the main system 
constraints: the minimum distance, rmin , and the coverage 
radius of each node, rcov. After we have evaluated nh by 
considering the outcome by both mobility, and physical 
simulations.  
Specifically:  
• the outcome by the mobility model will permit to 
evaluate the distance of each node in different 
configurations; 
• the outcome by the physical model will permit to 
evaluate the corresponding SNR (at each distance 
calculated by the mobility schemes) of the 
transmitted signal for each node. The average SNR 
value for each test case will be considered for the  
FEP evaluation. 
These evaluations have been performed for each M-ary 
modulation format. We proposed some equations to define a 
number of hops for each scenario as described in the 
following subsections.    
  
A. Pipeline  Scenario 
We have evaluated the number of hops taking into 
account geometric configurations of the swarm for both high 
and low dense case. We have reported only theoretical 
considerations because no difference has been found by 
simulation results.  
• Low Dense Pipeline – In this case the nodes are 
located at the maximum distance allowable for a fully 
connected swarm, rcov (Fig. 1a), and the number of 
hops is given by

  (6) 
 
• 
High Dense Pipeline – In this case the nodes are 
located at the minimum distance allowable, rmin 
(Fig. 1b) and thus the number of hops to cover the 
distance D is obtained as the ratio D to rcov

B. Broadcast Scenario 
For this scenario we have firstly evaluated nh with 
theoretical considerations, after we have repeated the same 
analysis by considering the outcome of the mobility 
simulator.  
1) Theoretical Model – The model is based on 
geometrical considerations of the different configurations 
that the swarm assumes. For each test case, the maximum 
number of hops needed to forward information from source 
to destination has been evaluated. 
a) High Dense Sphere Configuration - The maximum 
number of nodes can be evaluated according to (8), as the 
ratio between two sphere volumes: the Physical Sphere, Vmin 
and the Coverage Sphere Vcov. This assumption is justified 
by considering that each node is very close to each other, 
and thus the Coverage Sphere of each node overlaps with 
the other ones (Fig. 3b),

b) Low Dense Sphere Configuration – The number of 
hops can be evaluated according to (9), where D is the 
diameter of the sphere, in which the swarm can stay and d is 
the maximum distance between two neighbors nodes, which 
corresponds, in the worst case, to rcov (Fig. 3a). The 
diameter D can be calculated as a function of the volume of 
the sphere that (in the worst case) contains N spheres of rcov 
/2 radius. In this case, the maximum hops number is

c) High Dense Ellipsoid Configuration – As in the 
high dense sphere case, the nodes are very close one to each 
other within a “thin” sphere that converges to an ellipsoid; if 
the ellipsoid is very thin means that the swarm assumes a 
quasi-linear configuration and thus the number of hops can 
be calculated by (7), whereas if the ellipsoid has its 
geometrical parameters of the same value (i.e., a=b=c), the 
ellipsoid converges to the sphere case and the number of 
hops is expressed by (8). For all the other cases, the number 
of hops is given by

d) Low Dense Ellipsoid Configuration – As in the low 
sphere configuration, the maximum distance allowable 
between two nodes is determined by the minimum SNR 
required by rcov.  If the ellipsoid is very thin, it collapses to a 
linear distance such as the pipeline, and the number of hops 
is equal to N-1, while if the ellipsoid collapses to a sphere, 
the number of hops can be expressed by (9). Even in this 
case the average configuration with a canonic ellipsoid leads 
to a number of hop as:

2) Numerical Results – The results obtained by using 
theoretical approaches have been confirmed by simulation 
outcomes. We have simulated the swarm mobility models 
and after evaluated the number of hops needed for each 
configuration. In our simulations, we assume 10 AUVs in 
the swarm, with rcov=80 m and rphy =3 m. The output of the 
mobility algorithm is the Hop Matrix, MHop, in which the i-
th column represents the number of hops needed to the i-th 
node to reach the j-th node. We have verified that: 
a) High Dense Sphere Configuration – Each node is 
directly connected to all the others, and then the MHop will 
be composed of all 1, i.e., only one hop is needed to reach 
the destination.  
b) Low Dense Sphere Configuration – In this case the 
details of the MHop are shown in Fig. 4, in which we can note 
that the maximum number of hops is 6, due to the spherical 
symmetry of the nodes configuration.  
c) High Dense Ellipsoid configuration – Even in this 
case the MHop matrix is fulfilled as the High Dense Sphere 
one. 
d) Low Dense Ellipsoid Configuration – The number of 
hops increases significantly with respect to the previous case, 
due to the increase of the swarm area.

Figure 4. Hop Matrix – Low Dense Sphere Configuration (left) and Low 
Dense Ellipsoid Configuration (right). 
 
In this case, the maximum number of hops reaches the 
Pipeline Low case, i.e., 9 hops. It means that all the nodes 
are involved in the forwarding activities (Fig. 4).  
Figures 5-8 show the performance in terms of FEP for 
each case under test for both theoretical and numerical 
results, respectively. The evaluations have been repeated for 
M-FSK with M=4,8, and 16. In the figures only 4-FSK and 
16-FSK have been reported because the 8-FSK results 
appeared not significantly different from the 4-FSK ones.  
Specifically, Fig. 5 shows the theoretical FEP evaluation 
for pipeline scenarios.  Figures 6-7 show FEP evaluations for 
low dense sphere and ellipsoid, respectively by considering 
both theoretical and numerical models. Fig. 8 depicts high 
dense sphere and ellipsoid cases. In the latter case theoretical 
and numerical results are coincident, and thus only one 
(theoretical) has been reported. We have verified that 16-
FSK requires a lower SNR value than 4-FSK to achieve the 
same FEP level. This attitude becomes more evident in the 
high 
dense 
cases. 
The 
sphere 
configurations 
are 
characterized by better performance with respect to the other 
ones, while the ellipsoid scenarios assume middle 
performance between the sphere and the pipeline cases. All 
the theoretical considerations are confirmed by numerical 
results, showing a good confidence level for the proposed 
mobility algorithm.

CONLCUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK   
Underwater swarm networks have been considered to 
define the requirements to be satisfied in different 
application 
scenarios. 
Performance 
evaluations 
by 
comparing different operability modes for a swarm network 
have been carried out. By numerical results we have verified 
that the performance strictly depends on the different swarm 
configurations. The power consumption and the latency have 
to be taken into account, which are the main constraints for 
alert applications. A good trade-off has to be achieved to 
obtain solutions suitable to real underwater context. Future 
studies will be to consider a more complex physical layer 
model, which includes environment information and its 
variability 
(i.e., 
temperature 
and 
salinity 
profiles), 
remembering that in underwater network design the upper 
layers of nodes are highly constrained by the physical layer 
parameters.
