Abstract— As Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex 
(OFDM) signal is essentially a sum of multiple subcarrier 
signals aligned in frequency domain, its waveform in time 
domain is a waveform that changes like Gaussian noise, and 
thus the amplitude of time-domain waveform has high Peak-to-
Average Power Ratio (PAPR). Constant Amplitude Zero Auto-
Correlation (CAZAC) waveform precoding transforms from an 
OFDM waveform into a waveform kind of single-carrier 
modulation signal. In this paper, a new technique of symbol 
synchronization for OFDM systems with CAZAC precoding is 
proposed. By the CAZAC precoding, the waveform of one 
OFDM symbol can be changed to the waveform of Zadoff-Chu 
sequence by inputting proper data sequence. Here, the Zadoff-
Chu sequence, known as one of CAZAC sequence, has excellent 
autocorrelation characteristics and is utilized as a strong tool for 
symbol synchronization in 4G-LTE systems.

 INTRODUCTION 
Currently, OFDM modulation scheme is mainly used in 
wireless communication systems: Wi-Fi, 4G-LTE, digital 
terrestrial broadcasting, etc. OFDM signals have high 
spectrum efficiency. However, as OFDM signal is essentially 
a sum of multiple subcarrier signals aligned in frequency 
domain, its waveform in time domain is a waveform that 
changes like Gaussian noise, and thus the amplitude of time 
domain waveform has high PAPR.  
To reduce the PAPR, many techniques have been 
proposed: Selected Mapping (SLM), Active Constellation 
Extension (ACE), Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS), etc. [1]. 
The technique that PAPR was improved drastically in 
CAZAC-OFDM which used CAZAC precoding have been 
proposed [2]-[4]. CAZAC precoder makes the PAPR of 
multilevel quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM) 
OFDM signals into the PAPR of M-QAM single-carrier 
signals. 
CAZAC-OFDM has an extremely unique time-domain 
waveforms of transmitted signals. The feature of the 
waveforms is that it consists of signals of which the phase of 
mapping data is rotated. Here, the mapping data means I-Q 
modulation data for subcarriers. In addition, the amount of 
phase rotation and the time ordering are uniquely determined. 
Thus, processing data sequence properly, the waveform of 
one OFDM symbol can be generated optionally.  
OFDM systems require exact timing estimation on the 
receiver side [5]. If OFDM symbols are demodulated without 
exact timing, phase rotation and distortion in amplitude 
occurred. It results in much degradation of the bit-error rates. 
Therefore, most of OFDM systems employ preamble blocks 
and cyclic-prefix periods for synchronization.  
In this paper, a new technique of symbol synchronization 
of OFDM systems with CAZAC precoding is proposed [6]. 
By using CAZAC precoding, the time-domain waveform of 
one OFDM symbol can be changed to the waveform of 
Zadoff-Chu sequence by inputting proper data sequence. 
Here, the Zadoff-Chu sequence, known as one of CAZAC 
sequence, 
has 
constant 
amplitude 
and 
excellent 
autocorrelation characteristics and is utilized as a tool for 
symbol synchronization in 4G-LTE systems [7]-[9]. If we 
accord the length of Zadoff-Chu sequence with the length of 
one OFDM symbol, for example, 64 Fast Fourier Transform 
(FFT) points, the OFDM symbol consisting of Zadoff-Chu 
sequence can be used for one unit of preamble sequence.  
Moreover, the technique is expected to be used in both of 
packet and continuous mode OFDM systems. By replacing 
data symbols with the Zadoff-Chu symbols periodically, the 
technique can apply to the synchronization for continues 
mode OFDM systems, such as digital terrestrial broadcasting 
systems. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, 
we describe OFDM system, CAZAC-OFDM system and 
proposed system. In Section 3, we describe performance 
evaluation and computer simulation results. Finally, we 
conclude this paper in Section5.

PROPOSED SYSTEM 
In this section, we describe OFDM system, CAZAC-
OFDM system and proposed system. We first describe 
OFDM system and then, we explain CAZAC precoding 
technique. Next, we explain proposed system. 
A. 
OFDM System 
In OFDM system, N-point inverse Fast Fourier 
Transform (IFFT) is taken for the transmitted symbols 𝑿 =
[𝑋0, 𝑋1, … , 𝑋𝑁−1]𝑇, so as generate 𝒙 = [𝑥0, 𝑥1, … , 𝑥𝑁−1]𝑇, the

samples for the sum of 𝑁 orthogonal subcarrier signals. Let 
𝒚 donate the received sample that corresponds to 𝒙 with the 
additive noise w (i.e.,𝒚 = 𝒙 + 𝒘). Taking the 𝑁 −point FFT 
of the received samples,  𝒚 = [𝑦0, 𝑦1, … , 𝑦𝑁−1]𝑇, the noisy 
version of transmitted symbols 𝒀𝒍 = [𝑦0, 𝑦1, … , 𝑦𝑁−1]𝑇 can 
be obtained in the receiver. 
As all subcarriers are of the finite duration 𝑇 , the 
spectrum of the OFDM signal can be considered as the sum 
of the frequency-shifted sinc functions in the frequency 
domain as illustrated in Figure 1, where the overlapped 
neighboring sinc functions are spaced by 1/𝑇. As the OFDM 
signals are orthogonal, they are inter-carrier interference 
(ICI)-free. The OFDM scheme also inserts a guard interval in 
the time domain, which mitigates the inter-symbol 
interference (ISI) between OFDM symbols [5].

B. CAZAC-OFDM 
CAZAC sequence is constant amplitude and provides a 
good 
cross-correlation 
property. 
Therefore, 
CAZAC 
sequence is used in wireless communication systems such as 
channel estimation and time synchronization. The Zadoff-
Chu (ZC) sequence 𝑐𝑘 which is one of the CAZAC sequences 
is represented as 
 
𝑐𝑘 = 𝑒
𝑗𝜋𝑘2
𝑁2  
(1)  
Where 𝑘 = 1,2, … , 𝑁2 − 1 donates the sequence index. In 
this paper, CAZAC 𝑁 × 𝑁  precoding matrix 𝑀  is 
represented as 
 
𝑴 = [
𝑐1
𝑐𝑁+1
 
⋮
𝑐(𝑁−1)𝑁+1
 
⋯
⋯
𝑐𝑁
𝑐2𝑁
⋱
…
⋮
𝑐𝑁2
] 
(2)  
In CAZAC-OFDM system, we precode by multiplying 
this matrix 𝑴 before IFFT.  
Time signal in CAZAC-OFDM is obtained by 
multiplying matrix 𝑴 before IFFT. The time signal 𝑥𝑛 can be 
represented as 
 
𝑥𝑛 = 𝑋 ((𝑁
2 − 𝑛)
𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑁
) 𝐶 ((𝑁
2 − 𝑛)
𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑁
) 
(3)  
where 𝑋(𝑛) is a value after data mapping. Therefore, the time 
signal in CAZAC-OFDM is a value after data mapping phase 
rotated (Figure 2).

C. Zadoff-Chu Sequence 
ZC sequence is currently used in the following three 
applications in LTE/LTE-advanced. 
1). Reference sequence of uplink reference signal 
It is required that the uplink reference signal has highly 
autocorrelation and the power fluctuation is small in the 
time domain. Therefore, ZC sequence having the 
characteristic that the power is constant in the frequency 
domain and the time domain is used.  
2). Main Sync Signal for Cell Search 
The cell search is the following before doing the 
terminal to communicate with LTE network. 
 ・detect and synchronize cells in the network 
・receive and decode necessary information for 
communication within the cell and appropriate operation. 
The ZC sequence is used as the main synchronization 
signal to assist these cell searches.  
3). A Random Access Preamble 
Random access is what the terminal does in order to 
establish uplink synchronization. By sending the 
random access preamble to the base station by the 
terminal, the base station estimates the transmission 
timing of the terminal. As this random access preamble, 
the ZC sequence is used [7]-[9]. 
D. Synchronizing Symbol Timing 
Synchronizing 
symbol 
timing 
is 
synchronization 
processing to obtain OFDM symbols of the reference. The 
process decides FFT window position. After establishing the 
synchronization, we can demodulate that received OFDM 
signals. In packet mode, preamble signals as short as possible 
is transmitted before the data to establish symbol timing 
synchronization. It can be roughly classified into an 
autocorrelation type using a repetitive signal section and a 
cross correlation type using a matched filter of a preamble 
provided in a demodulator (Figure 3) [5][10].

E. Transmission Mode 
When the OFDM signals continue for a long time, this 
scheme is called continuous mode. In this case, some time is 
allowed for establishing frequency and symbol timing 
synchronization in the receiver. Therefore, establishing the 
synchronizations gradually is possible by using pilot signals 
embed in OFDM signals. A schematic of the signal in 
continuous mode is shown in Figure 4. 
 
Figure 4.  Continuous mode signal 
On the other hand, OFDM signals separated by a certain 
time are transmitted and received in packet mode which are 
applied in wireless LAN and mobile communication. In the 
receiver, it is necessary to wait at all times and establish 
synchronizations in a short period of time. Signals to establish 
synchronizations called preamble are assigned in packet mode. 
By using this preamble for synchronizations, we can execute 
synchronization processing quickly and accurately, which are 
required for packet mode. A schematic of the signal in packet 
mode is shown in Figure 5. 
 
Figure 5.  Packet mode signal 
F. Oversampling 
PAPR for the discrete-time base band signal 𝑥[𝑛] may 
not be the same as that fore the continuous-time base band 
signal 𝑥(𝑡). In fact, the PAPR for 𝑥[𝑛] is lower than that for 
𝑥(𝑡), simply because 𝑥[𝑛] may not have all peaks of 𝑥(𝑡). In 
practice, the PAPR for the continuous-time baseband signal 
can be measured only after implementing the actual hardware, 
including digital-to-analog convertor (DAC). In other words, 
measurement of the PAPR for the continuous-time baseband 
signal is not straight forward. Therefore, there must be some 
means of estimating the PAPR from the discrete-time signal 
𝑥[𝑛]. Fortunately, it is known that 𝑥[𝑛] can show almost the 
same PAPR as 𝑥(𝑡)  if it is L-times interpolated 
(oversampled) where 𝐿 ≥  4.  
It inserts (𝐿 − 1) zeros between the samples of 𝑥[𝑛] to 
yield 𝑤[𝑚] as follows: 
 
𝑤[𝑚] = {𝑥[𝑚/𝐿],   𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑚 = 0, ±𝐿, ±2𝐿, …
0,                𝑒𝑙𝑠𝑒𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒
 
(4)  
A low pass filter (LPF) is used to construct the 𝐿 −times-
interpolated version of 𝑥[𝑛] from 𝑤[𝑚]. For the LPF with an 
impulse response of ℎ[𝑚], the L-times-interpolated output 
𝑦[𝑚] can be represented as  
 
𝑦[𝑚] = ∑ ℎ[𝑘]𝑤[𝑚 − 𝑘]
∞
𝑘=−∞
 
(5)  
Figures 6 and 7 illustrate the signals and their spectra 
appearing in the oversampling process with a sampling 
frequency of 2kHz to yield a result of interpolation with 𝐿 =
4. Referring to these figures, the IFFT output signal 𝑥[𝑛] can 
be expressed in terms of the 𝐿 −times interpolated version as 
 
𝑥′[𝑚] =
1
√𝐿 ⋅ 𝑁
∑ 𝑋′[𝑘] ⋅ 𝑒
𝑗2𝜋𝑚Δ𝑓𝑘
𝐿⋅𝑁
𝐿⋅𝑁−1
𝑘=0
, 
𝑚 = 0,1, … , 𝑁𝐿 − 1 
(6)  
with 
 
𝑋′[𝑘]
= {𝑋[𝑘],   𝑓𝑜𝑟 0 ≤ 𝑘 < 𝑁
2    𝑎𝑛𝑑   𝑁𝐿 − 𝑁
2 < 𝑘 < 𝑁𝐿
0,          𝑒𝑙𝑠𝑒𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒                                           
 
(7)  
where 𝑁, 𝛥𝑓, and 𝑋[𝑘] donate the FFT size (or the total 
number of subcarriers), the subcarrier spacing and the 
complex symbol carried over a subcarrier 𝑘, respectively. 
In the case of 4-times oversampling, the time waveform 
has a form obtained by interpolating between the original two 
signal points with three points [5].

G. Processed Preamble 
Using the characteristics of the transmission waveform of 
CAZAC-OFDM shown in (1), we estimated the symbol 
timing by inserting a preamble which becomes the ZC 
sequence after CAZAC precoding and IFFT. From (1), the 
relation between before and after modulation of CAZAC-
OFDM on the transmission side is as shown in the Figure 8. 
From (1) and (3), the amount of phase rotation 𝜃 at each 
subcarrier is represented as 
 
𝜃 = 𝜋
((𝑁
2 − 𝑛)
𝑁)
2
𝑁2
 
(8)  
From these, we can shape the time waveform to desired 
waveform by processing CAZAC precoding and IFFT after 
reversing the order and giving the opposite phase rotation in 
advance. Then, rather than sending the preamble from the 
physical layer, it can treat the same way as data and send the 
preamble as a transmission waveform. In the conventional 
packet mode transmission system, when transmitting a 
preamble, it is transmitted using another route as shown 
Figure 9. Therefore, the switching operation is required at the 
time of transmission of data and the transmission of data. 
However, if the above process is used, the preamble can be 
transmitted without switching. Therefore, it is expected that 
the preamble can be embedded and used for synchronization 
not only in the packet mode but also in the continuous mode. 
In other words, it is possible to use the same system when 
synchronization processing and data is transmitted.

H. Proposed Flame Configuration 
Proposed flame configuration is as shown in the Figure 
10. The preamble is transmitted for three periods at first. 
Subsequently, data is transmitted. Data is demodulated by the 
timing decided from the preamble. Used preamble is ZC 
sequence and is represented as 
 
𝑍𝐶 = exp (−𝑗𝜋
(𝑘 − 1)2
64
) (𝑘 = 1,2, … ,64) 
(9)  
The autocorrelation property of this sequence is as shown 
in the shown Figure 11. In this simulation, we assume the 
frequency synchronization and time synchronization to be 
perfectly synchronized. Therefore, the preamble is used for 
symbol synchronization.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
In this section, we describe performance evaluation of 
proposed system. We present simulation results to discuss the 
performance of the proposed synchronization technique. 
 
A. Setup 
In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed 
system, we simulated by MATLAB. Table 1 summarizes the 
simulation specifications. Bandwidth, symbol length and 
guard interval are based on the specification of IEEE802.11a. 
We also do 4-times oversampling at the same time. Therefore, 
prepared the ZC sequence was expanded fourfold as in the 
Figure 14. With the above simulation specifications, we 
examined whether synchronization is established while 
changing the SNR.

B. Simulation Results 
Figure 15 plots the probabilities of synchronizations 
versus SNR. In the 4-times oversample, the probability of 
synchronizations is 1 when the SNR is 13 dB or more. Here, 
the BER characteristic in conventional 16-QAM-CAZAC-
OFDM and proposed system is as shown in Figure 16. The 
BER in proposed system has characteristics similar to that of 
conventional CAZAC-OFDM. The BER at which the signal 
can be reproduced using error correction code is 10−3 or less 
becomes reproducible in the range of 13dB or more. In that 
range, we confirmed that the probability of synchronization 
can be 1 in 4-times oversample. We confirmed that BER does 
not deteriorated if synchronization is established. We 
confirmed that we can establish synchronization using the 
autocorrelation property of the ZC sequence.

CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we proposed a new technique of symbol 
synchronization of OFDM systems with CAZAC precoding. 
CAZAC-OFDM is one of the useful PAPR reduction 
techniques. Here, we also showed that the waveform of one 
OFDM symbol can be changed to the waveform of ZC 
sequence by processing data sequence properly. Using this 
technique, we demonstrated that a symbol synchronization 
can be established. Since the preamble can be treated as data, 
synchronization can be established using the preamble not 
only in the packet mode but also in the continuous mode. We 
have confirmed that once the synchronization is established, 
the BER does not deteriorate.
