Abstract—This paper proposes a triple-hop mixed Radio-
Frequency/Free-Space-Optical/Radio-Frequency (RF/FSO/RF) 
communication system, which intends to support wireless long-
range links between two terrestrial stations via two 
stratospheric relays. It is considered that these terrestrial 
stations communicate with the relays over RF links, whereas 
the relays communicate with each other over a FSO link. The 
RF channels experience Rician fading due to the Line-of-Sight 
(LoS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) signal components. 
Besides, the optical channel is affected by atmospheric 
attenuation, atmospheric turbulence, and pointing errors. 
Mathematical expressions for the outage probability are 
derived, considering the beam wander effect. The results 
demonstrate the theoretical derivations.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The development of next-generation wireless broadband 
communications comprises the seamless integration of 
terrestrial and aerospace infrastructures over heterogeneous 
networks [1]. In recent years, the use of mobile airborne 
services via High-Altitude Platforms (HAPs) flying in the 
stratosphere has been suggested for civil and military 
applications [2]. To successfully fulfill the demands of future 
wireless communication services, shifting from the Radio-
Frequency (RF) domain to the optical domain is 
indispensable [3] [4]. In Free-Space-Optical (FSO) systems, 
the data is transmitted at high data rates in the multigigabit 
regime using collimated highly directed laser beams with 
compact equipment and low power consumption. The FSO 
technology ensures privacy with low probability of 
interception, immunity to electromagnetic interference, and 
exemption from spectrum regulatory restrictions.  
The stratosphere stands for a propagation medium well 
suited for FSO connections. Hopefully, the inter-HAP 
crosslink is above attenuating clouds, fog or significant 
aerosols. Hence, inter-HAP distances of up to 900 km are 
possible 
with 
100% 
availability 
[5]. 
Nevertheless, 
stratospheric 
FSO 
links 
may 
experience 
substantial 
fluctuations in both the intensity and the phase of the 
received signal due to variations of the Index of Refraction 
Turbulence (IRT) along the propagation path resulting by the 
inhomogeneities in temperature and pressure fluctuations, 
especially for link distances of 1 km and above [6]. 
Moreover, beam pointing error effects are highly pronounced 
on the performance of a stratospheric network, which 
involves large distances and possible displacement of the 
platforms due to the winds or pressure variations of the 
stratosphere [7]. In addition, both mechanical vibrations and 
electronic noise may cause the received spots from the laser 
beams to wander on the detector planes. Hence, acquisition, 
pointing, and tracking errors should also be mitigated to 
achieve high directivity of the transmitted beam.  To extend 
the network range, and effectively combat the effect of 
turbulence, the use of relay-aided transmission schemes has 
been suggested [8]. In [7], a full-FSO system with multiple 
stratospheric relays and fixed stations on the ground was 
proposed. However, FSO systems should operate under 
accurate pointing requirements. Hence, employing FSO 
techniques is highly challenging and insufficient as soon as 
the terrestrial stations are in motion.  
Motivated by these observations, this paper investigates 
the use of two stratospheric relays acting as Decode-and-
Forward (DF) relay nodes, in order to facilitate challenging 
triple-hop long-range wireless communication between two 
terrestrial mobile stations. Although the Amplify-and-
Forward (AF) scheme is simple to implement, DF offers 
better performance and is a common assumption in multi-
hop networks. A mixed RF/FSO/RF airborne communication 
scenario is considered, where an RF transmission scheme is 
adopted for the communication between the terrestrial 
stations and the stratospheric relays, whereas these relays are 
interconnected through an FSO link. A stratospheric 
communication channel is expected to be Rician in its 
general form [9]. Hence, the Rician distribution is adopted to 
model the channels for the RF links. To investigate the effect 
of atmospheric turbulence on the FSO link, a Kolmogorov 
power 
spectrum 
for 
refractive-index 
fluctuations 
is 
considered and the Gamma-Gamma (G-G) distribution is 
used, 
which 
matched 
data 
values 
obtained 
from 
measurements, under a variety of turbulence conditions [10]. 
Finally, the effects of pointing errors are described by the 
Rayleigh distribution [7]. Mathematical expressions are

provided for different values of the system parameters. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II 
presents the system model. In Section III, the RF and FSO 
fading channels are modeled. In Section IV, the outage 
probability is mathematically derived. Results are provided

II. 
SYSTEM MODEL 
This paper considers a mixed RF/FSO/RF airborne 
communication system with slowly-varying and frequency-
flat-fading channels. As shown in Figure 1, the transmitted 
signal from a source node propagates through two serial DF 
stratospheric relays of similar size and type before arriving at 
a destination node. It is considered that the direct link 
between the source and the destination is obstructed due to 
high attenuation. To aid our analysis, the subscripts S, D, and 
Rm ,
 where 1
2,
 m

 are affiliated with the source, the 
destination, and the m-th relay, respectively. In this system, 
the S–R1 and R2–D links use RF technology, while the R1–R2 
link is based on FSO technology. The communication is 
assumed to operate in a half-duplex mode and to be 
conducted over three phases: S → R1, R1 → R2, and R2 → D. 
The source and the destination are equipped with single 
antennas. Besides, the relays not only include antennas, but 
also lasers and photo-detectors.  
A. First RF Link 
The received signal at the stratospheric relay R1 can be

B. FSO Inter-HAP Link 
In the FSO link, the cost-effective Intensity Modulation 
Direct-Detection (IM/DD) is employed. The received RF 
signal at the R1 is decoded and converted to optical signal by 
employing the Subcarrier Intensity Modulation (SIM) 
technique. In particular, after filtering by a Bandpass Filter 
(BPF), a Direct Current (DC) bias is added to the filtered RF 
signal to ensure that the optical signal is non-negative. Then, 
the biased signal is sent to a continuous wave laser driver. 
The retransmitted optical signal at R1 is written as [12]

The DC component is filtered out at R2 and an optical-to-

M = 1, the received signal can be expressed as

  is the 
modified Bessel function of the first kind and zero-th order. 
The Rician factor

For the FSO link, a composite optical channel model is 
used [7]. In particular, the channel state I  models the 
random attenuation of the propagation channel that arises 
due to the path loss 
lI ,
 the atmospheric turbulence

 and 
the pointing errors

A. Effects of Atmospheric Attenuation 
The atmospheric attenuation is deterministic and is 
defined by the exponential Beers–Lambert Law [18]

fixed during a long period of time.

this model is inappropriate due to the hot spot displacement

C. Effects of Pointing Errors 
To ensure that the communication scenario is viable, 
proper LoS alignment between the relays via appropriate 
pointing and tracking mechanisms is required. In this paper, 
a model that incorporates geometric spreading in the pointing 
error PDF ([18], p. 1703) is used. Considering a Gaussian 
beam profile of beam waist wz (at a distance z) and modeling 
the random radial displacement of the beam at the detector as 
Rayleigh distributed, the PDF of the pointing error 
I p
 
includes the random attenuation due to both geometric 
spreading and pointing errors and can be expressed as [18]

Figure 2 depicts the outage probability for different 
values of the Rician factor K1 = K2 = K and u = 10 m/s. It is 
obvious that increasing the Rician factor improves the 
performance of the system. Note that a certain outage floor 
exists at high values of K due to the average SNR over the 
FSO link. Hence, all curves tend to the same saturation 
floor. 
Figure 3 demonstrates the outage probability for both the 
best and worst case of turbulence conditions and different 
inter-HAP distance. As this distance decreases, a significant 
performance improvement can be achieved. However, the 
variation of the FSO propagation distance slightly affects the 
outage probability when the worst case of turbulence 
conditions is observed.

Finally, Figure 4 shows the effect of the normalized jitter 
standard deviation

 on the outage probability for                    
u = 10 m/s. One observes that the performance significantly 
degrades and the pointing errors have a dominant effect on 
the system performance, as

 increases. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, the performance of a triple-hop mixed 
RF/FSO/RF stratospheric communication system has been 
investigated. The results have depicted that the Rician factor 
significantly influences the system performance. These 
results have also underlined that the performance degrades, 
as the inter-HAP distance increases. However, for the worst 
turbulence case, this distance slightly affects the outage 
probability. Finally, the results have shown that the 
misalignment-induced fading has a severe effect on the 
system performance. Since there are no experimental data 
available in the literature to fully verify the theoretical 
results, future research efforts may be devoted to collecting 
measured channel data in real-world propagation conditions.
