Abstract— The paper studies the actual task of developing and 
setting up the algorithms for multi-extreme objects search 
optimization. To solve such problems, the heuristic methods 
are effectively used, in particular applying the swarming 
particles method. The mathematical base for the modified 
swarming particles method, which is oriented to solve the 
multi-extreme search problems, is developed and described in 
detail. The modified algorithm is applied to the irregular 
multi-extreme Lambda test functions, considered to be a very 
difficult test case. The developed "Lambda Function" software 
is created to control the generation, editing and investigation of 
multidimensional multi-extreme test functions. The applied 
Lambda function is a multiplicative function developed by R. 
Neydorf, with fundamental extremes, multidimensionality and 
isolation in the factor space, which completely exclude the 
influence of the computed results. The application of this 
fundamentally new test function shows that such modified 
method of swarming particles is suitable for solving rather 
complex multi-extreme search problems. In addition, the 
developed "Lambda Function" software shows wide range of 
application possibilities when developing and researching the 
test functions for other related applications.

swarming particles; test functions; irregularity; software. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Many modern technical and scientific problems are 
complex, as they need to solve optimization problems [1]. 
Today, most of the known search engine optimization 
methods are designed and used to find one optimum, which 
is often the global one. However, the goal is not always to 
find only the global optimal solution. In many cases, there 
are many suboptimal and close to the global optimal extreme 
solutions, which are quite acceptable. To study such 
problems and find solutions applying the Multi-Extreme 
(ME) optimization, subject-oriented methods, as well as 
tools for testing and evaluation, are required. 
When making decisions regarding ME, it is necessary to 
take into account that the deterministic search methods are 
usually very sensitive to their essential nonlinear continuum 
dependencies (in particular to discontinuity of their 
derivatives and variables). When searching the discrete 
quotient spaces, ME problems are often NP-complete [1]. In 
this regard, to solve complex (multidimensional and ME) 
optimization problems, more and more often various 
effective heuristic methods are applied. 
The most important advantages of the heuristic 
algorithms, over other types of optimization algorithms, are 
in analogies that generated them. They consider the 
adaptation processes found in living and inanimate nature. 
Methodologically, they are based on processes found in the 
knowledge areas as decision-making theory, fuzzy logic, 
neural networks, evolutionary-genetic mechanisms, fleece 
behavior, etc. These processes partially repeat and in many 
ways supplement each other [2][3]. The disadvantages of 
these methods are that they are not adaptable to support 
analytical research and evaluation. 
Today, the heuristic methods are used to solve problems 
of high computational complexity. One of the most 
promising representatives of such methods is the Method of 
Swarming Particles (MSP) [2]. However, the peculiarity of 
research and practical development of ME optimization 
algorithms are coming with their own complexity, 
cumbersomeness and significant development times, when a 
large number of extremes in the factor space of the related 
problem has to be solved. 
The impossibility in performing theoretical studies of 
qualitative properties and numerical settings of heuristic 
algorithms implies that their performance and efficiency are 
most often checked with so-called Test functions (TFs) [4]-
[6]. When algorithms for investigating ME objects are in 
development, the selection of effective testing tools is the 
problem. It is well known that TFs have either one global 
extreme, or they have a regular character with respect to the 
extremes location, and the magnitude of their respective 
amplitudes [7]-[10]. Thus, to have a more effective testing, 
the irregular multidimensional ME functions need to be 
created. 
The most famous and widely used ME optimization TFs 
are: Rosenbrock [7], Rastrigin [8], Himmelblau [9], De Jong 
[7], Griewank [7], Schwefel [7], etc. In addition, many 
papers describe other variants of TFs that generates ME 
functions [10]. They ensure a good verification of the ME 
optimization algorithms, the quality of the structural and 
parametric setup has to be controlled to study the factor 
space. In this context, a structural evaluation means the 
determination of the number of extremes and their spatial 
arrangement (coordinates). The parametric estimation means

the determination of the extremes magnitudes (taking into 
account their signs). 
The disadvantage of most TFs is their regular and 
analytical character. The absence of no differentiable or 
poorly differentiable areas greatly facilitates the work on the 
algorithm, 
by 
evaluating 
the 
surface 
shape 
under 
investigation. The real search is made difficult due to the fact 
that their coordinates are usually close to each other. The 
presence of noticeable surface curvature at the respective 
extreme distance facilitates its search. Therefore, the TF 
extreme should be as close as possible to the impulse form, 
as in such case its neighborhood is minimally curved. A 
sufficiently developed adaptive algorithm can easily identify 
the period of the extremes alternation. 
In Section 2, the problem described in this paper is 
formulated. Section 3 contains a description of the 
Multiplicatively Allocating Function (MAF) and its 
characteristics. Section 4 illustrates the features of the 
developed special software (SW) for MAF building. Section 
5 describes the mathematical model (MM) of modified MSP 
for ME search. Section 6 shows the result of experiments on 
the generated Lambda TFs. Section 7 contains the conclusion 
of the conducted research and future work.

PROBLEM FORMULATION 
Following the above described issues, the goal of this 
paper is to develop and study the MSP modification, aiming 
to solve different ME search problems. For testing and 
setting a highly efficient solution to treat these problems, it is 
necessary to test the MSP on TFs, which are coming with 
disadvantages, as already described in the introduction. Thus, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
implement 
algorithmically 
and 
programmatically the TF generator, which is theoretically 
presented in [4], and to conduct and process statistically the 
representative experiments, when setting up the modified 
MSP.

constructing the universal irregular ME TFs, based on the 
application of MAF suitable constructed to approximate 
problems [4]-[6].

number of K extremes, has the form:

MSP MM, MODIFIED FOR ME SEARCH 
The essence for using MSP in search optimization 
problems is well known [1][2]. The classical MSP algorithm 
imitates the real group behavioral insects, birds, fish, many 
protozoa, etc. However, the ME optimization requires some 
specific algorithm properties. Therefore, the canonical MSP 
version has been significantly revised and modified by the 
authors [2][3]. The hybrid algorithm includes basic algorithm 
laws of mechanics, dynamics, gravitation and stochastic 
"blurring" of the method parameters, which are used in the 
swarm prototype. In particular, its modification has been 
developed for solving ME problems in multidimensional 
spaces.

VI. 
MSP MODIFICATION FOR Λ TFS APPLICATION 
To study and adjust the ME modification of MSP, 3 
demonstration Lambda TFs are generated using the "Lambda 
Function" SW; see Figures 4(a), 4(b) and 4(c). In addition, to 
test the MSP modification, an appropriate "MMSP" 
(Modified MSP) SW was developed. For its development, 
the C # programming language was used. 
For all experiments, the same particle number (P) and 
iteration (I) settings were used, to obtain a more general 
picture of MSP operation on various generated functions. At 
the same time, the dynamics parameters were settings 
dynamically, with respect to the region under consideration. 
Figures 4(d), 4(e) and 4(f) show Lambda functions and 
localized MSP regions (red squares) and extremes (blue 
dots), which are found and evaluated. Each function has a 
specific feature that allows you to identify the positive 
aspects and disadvantages of the optimization algorithm 
being developed. 
Figures 4(a) and 4(d) show a TF with 5 minima and 3 
maxima. The functions are steep near extremes and 
moderately canopies at the bases, and being located at a 
considerable distance from each other. However, the 
amplitude of the extremes is not high (-1), and it is not easy 
to identify the whole set of extremes from the first pass. 
Figures 4(b) and 4(e) illustrate the generated function 
with 20 maxima. This function is complicated by the fact 
that the extremes have steep pulses. Outside the extremes 
region, agents have virtually no information about remote 
impulses. Only the mechanism of interaction between 
particles in the swarm, as part of the MSP MM modification, 
has enabled to investigate this type of function. 
Figures 4(c) and 4(f) show a Lambda function, which has 
8 minima and 8 maxima to identify and estimate the minima. 
The shape of this function is similar to the bends of "peaks" 
and "gorges," which can be smooth, but may have sharp 
cliffs. By localizing one of the extremes, the multi-agent 
system is not exploring the rest of the search space. 
However, this does not happen in the modified MSP. 
Tables I-III show the experiments results of a successful 
search for the modified-MSP. These results were obtained 
from the basic MM motion of the swarm (preceding the MM 
clustering mechanism [11], which divided the search space 
into subspaces and found in each an extreme, and which was 
replaced by the dynamic clustering caused by the behavioral 
model of the swarm itself). The agents localize extreme 
areas, under the influence of attraction forces (not only 
global, but also local). The increase in the influence of local 
attraction is caused, in particular, by the introduction of a 
turbulent deceleration in the MM. The removal of the non-
dynamic clustering mechanism from MM also enabled to 
exclude the "cluster" attraction of the swarm particles to the 
closest previously created clusters, which allowed the 
particles to behave in a more similar way to the real 
prototype. 
As a result, the minimum error of the obtained 
approximation in experiment 1 (see Table I), relative to the 
standard, was ~0.01%, average ~0.03%. MSP successfully 
isolated the extreme regions and obtained the described 
results due to the smooth motion of the particles to the 
extreme values found at the moment (based on (3)-(5)). This 
allowed the particles not to jump through the extremes. 
The minimum error of the obtained approximation in 
experiment 2 (see Table II), relative to the standard, turned 
out to be ~0.001%, mean ~0.01%. The parameter of the 
slope of the pulse fronts of a given Lambda function for all 
extremes is 0.01, which implies the complexity in finding 
them. However, since the number of extremes is 20, the 
particles interact with each other and receive an additional 
opportunity to study the neighboring extremes. This effect is 
due to the fact that, when the particle is found close to a 
extreme, then, in the next step, it will get a large acceleration 
(see (5)), which will allow the particle to escape from this 
extreme attraction zone and visit the extreme region of the 
neighboring one. 
The minimum error of the approximation obtained in 
experiment 3 (see Table III), relative to the standard, was 
~0.09%, average ~3%.

The complexity of this experiment consists in mixing 
maxima and minima. This means that the particles will be 
located more often in positions that may be worse than their 
previous ones. However, the method is also effective in such 
a case.

The attraction of particles to the global extreme allows 
improving the result of the whole swarm, even in a situation 
where the best position of the particle itself is not a local 
extreme (which forces the particle to swarm in the pseudo-
local area). With additional sub-optimization of the 
parameters of the swarm and particles, the error can be 
significantly reduced [2][3]. 
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The developed Lambda Function SW has proven to be an 
effective tool for the generation of the irregular multi-
dimensional ME TFs. The easy-to use and convenient 
interface to access the multi-functional SW allows the fast 
generation and qualitative analysis of TFs. The demonstrated 
SW functions do not have an obvious regular and analytical 
character, like the set of the today existing ME optimization 
TFs. 
The experiments carried out on TFs showed that the 
developed MSP modification allows localizing the extreme 
areas of the nonstandard irregular ME Lambda function, 
having the approximation error from ~0.001% to ~3%. 
The experimentally obtained results allow the validation 
of the developed MSP modification, and prove that the 
developed Lambda Function SW is an effective tool in 
searching the extremes of heterogeneous generated TFs. 
The main research outcome is the modified heuristic 
method of swarming particles applied to the author's Cut-
Glue approximation for highly nonlinear dependencies. 
The developed generator, in addition to the presented 
advantages has the possibility of creating irregular 
multidimensional ME TFs with MAF modification. Thus, it 
further helps to investigate the properties of TFs, when they 
are applied to different domains, and allowing more accurate 
results analysis of the overall "Cut-Glue" approximations 
approach.
