Abstract—Cerrado is the second largest biome in Brazil. 
Among the land changes in the Cerrado, over 500,000 km² of 
the biome have been transformed into cultivated pastures in 
recent years. Distinguishing the native formations and 
identifying types of land use and cover in the Cerrado are 
important tasks for monitoring and protection policy of the 
biome. Within this context, this work aims at developing a 
methodology based on remote sensing techniques, to map 
pasture and native grassland areas in the Brazilian Cerrado. 
Data related to land use and cover, relief, spectral information 
from Landsat images and vegetation indices were used to 
perform the image classification. Decision trees and Support 
Vector Machines algorithms were used, and the results showed 
that the analysis and integration of different data sources can 
aid in the classification process. In order to discriminate areas 
of cultivated pastures and grassland formations, we obtained 
accuracies up to 82% in the study area, being able to identify 
attributes and data required to recognize these areas in the 
Brazilian Cerrado by remote sensing images.

 INTRODUCTION 
Serious environmental risks can arise and pose a threat of 
global character when natural resources are not used properly 
[1]. Within this perspective, it can be mentioned the 
problems caused by changes in land use and land cover in 
the second largest biome in Brazil, the Cerrado [2]. More 
than half of Brazilian Cerrado’s area has been transformed, 
mainly to make room for cattle and cash crops, losing more 
than 1,000,000 km² of its original vegetation [3].  
Croplands cover more than 100,000 km² and pastures 
surpass 500,000 km², whereas protected areas comprise only 
about 33,000 km². The destruction of the Cerrado vegetation 
is three times larger than the amount of the deforested area in 
the Amazon region. Deforestation ranges from 22,000 to 
30,000 km² per year, even higher than those observed in 
Amazon 
Forest. 
This 
scenario 
represents 
a 
high 
environmental cost and implies loss of biodiversity, soil 
erosion, vegetation degradation, water pollution, instability 
of the carbon cycle and probable regional climatic changes 
and variations in fire events, which are typical of the biome 
[4]. 
There is a large number of definitions for Cerrado and, as 
a result, several proposals for classification of native 
formations can be found in the literature. Among the 
physiognomic types presented in the biome, there are the 
grassland formations, which include the physiognomies of 
Clean Field, Dirty Field and Rocky Field [5]. We argue that 
with the identification and monitoring of these vegetation 
types using satellite imagery, policies can promote its 
physical, chemical and biological integrity, and estimate the 
productivity of the degraded regions [6].

In order to promote the recovery of degraded areas and 
the policies that protect the biome, it is essential to create 
maps to analyze the land use and land cover of the savanna. 
However, cultivated pastures, similarly to native grasslands, 
may vary from formations with predominance of grasses to 
areas that present dominance of pioneer trees and shrub 
species [7]. Therefore, the mapping of pasture areas and 
native formations in the Cerrado is a difficult task if only the 
spectral information obtained by satellite images is used [8].  
To overcome this problem, this work proposes a 
methodology for mapping areas of Cultivated Pasture and 
Native Vegetation (Clean Field, Dirty Field and Rocky 
Grasslands), using data mining from integration of satellite 
imagery data in multiple resolutions. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In 
Section 2, we present a brief description of the Brazilian

Cerrado. Section 3 describes the cultivated pastures in the 
biome. The methodological procedures and data used are 
depicted in Section 4. In Section 5, we discuss the results 
obtained in this work. Finally, we describe the conclusion 
and future work in Section 6. 
II. 
THE BRAZILIAN CERRADO 
Cerrado is the Portuguese word for Brazil’s plateau of 
savannas, grasslands, woodlands, and gallery and dry forests 
[9]. One of the most biodiverse regions on the planet, the 
Brazilian Cerrado has an area of approximately 2 million 
km², comprising about 24% of the Brazilian territory [10]. 
Cerrado is the richest tropical savanna in the world [4] and 
the biome occupies the central region of Brazil, extending 
from the northeast coast of the Maranhão state (MA) to the 
north of Paraná (PR) state, as shown in Figure 1. Overall, 
Cerrado can be understood as a grass field coexisting with 
scattered trees and shrubs [11] and it is the second largest of 
Brazil’s major biomes, after Amazonia [4]. 
The biome is characterized as one that presents three 
types of formations: forests, savannas and grasslands. 
Generally, the grassland formation refers to regions with 
predominance of herbaceous species and some shrubs, 
without the occurrence of trees in the landscape [5]. 
The vegetation included in the grassland formations 
comprises areas of Clean Field, Dirty Field and Rocky Field 
(Figure 2). Regions of Dirty Field and Rocky Field present a 
physiognomic type predominantly herbaceous and shrubby. 
However, Rocky Field areas include micro-relief landscapes 
with typical species, which usually occupy regions of rocky 
outcrops at elevations above 900 m. On the other hand, the 
phytophysiognomy of Clean Field has a predominance of 
grasses interspersed with underdeveloped woody plants, 
without the presence of trees [5].  
 
Figure 2.  Grassland formations in the Brazilian Cerrado. Sources: [12], 
[13]. 
More than half of Cerrado’s original vegetation has been 
transformed into cultivated pasture areas, agriculture and 
other uses, as shown in Table I. In addition, studies indicate 
that changes in land use in the Cerrado occur with greater 
intensity than in the Amazon region [14] [15].

Hence, these changes in land use impose substantial 
threats to ecosystems and species of the biome. Only 2.2% of 
its area is legally protected and various species of animals 
and plants are endangered [4]. Furthermore, approximately 
20% of endangered endemic species no longer exist in 
preserved areas. Besides the vegetation degradation and soil 
erosion, the introduction of non-native species and the use of 
fire to create pastures can have an adverse impact on 
ecosystems and cause significant loss of biodiversity in the 
Cerrado [4]. 
III. 
CULTIVATED PASTURES 
Cultivated pastures represent about 500,000 km² of the 
biome. It is important to analyze the degradation of 
cultivated pastures, since nearly 50% of the planted areas in 
grasslands are severely degraded (Figure 3), causing 
increased erosion, loss of soil fertility and the predominance 
of invasive species [16]. Therefore, not only can the recovery 
of these areas increase the producers’ income, but also it can 
reduce the environmental impact by decreasing erosion, 
emission of carbon dioxide and opening new areas for cattle 
[17].

Some types of data can be extracted and analyzed to 
support the detection of these regions, such as biophysical 
(soil type, percentage of green cover and biomass), 
radiometric (Enhanced Vegetation Index – EVI and 
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index – NDVI) and 
climatic (precipitation) data. Moreover, wet and dry seasons 
are well defined in the region and, therefore, this fact may 
assist 
to 
identify 
the 
radiometric 
and 
biophysical 
characteristics of planted pasture areas [16].  
The classification of cultivated pastures is difficult 
because the degradation of these regions can, for example, 
influence the percentage of vegetation cover and the 
response of vegetation indices. Misclassification may occur 
when pastures are managed improperly, since those areas 
might be detected as invasive species or even the revival of 
species of native shrubs and trees in these regions [16].  
Therefore, in order to improve the discrimination of such 
targets it is necessary to use temporal and field data and also 
to better understand the biophysical properties of these areas. 
[8]. Thus, the analysis using images with different spatial 
and temporal resolutions can allow the more accurate 
identification of spatial and temporal patterns of the targets 
in the Cerrado.

IV. 
DATA AND METHODS 
This study encompasses a Cerrado area that comprises a 
region of Serra da Canastra National Park and neighboring 
regions (Figure 4). The region is located in the south-central 
state of Minas Gerais, southeastern of Brazil. The chosen 
scene contains the targets of interest, both native grassland 
areas and cultivated pasture. 
 
Figure 4.  Location of the study area. 
Information on cultivated pasture areas, for the year 
2006, were provided by the Brazilian Ministry of the 
Environment. The regions of native areas, for the year 2009, 
were obtained from the Forest Inventory of Minas Gerais, 
created by the University of Lavras (UFLA), which ranks the 
grassland formations into two classes: Field (Clean and Dirty 
Fields) and Rocky Field. As a means to evaluate the 
classification results, these reference data were used as 
ground truth. 
 Therefore, the types of classes used in this work includes 
the following standards: Cultivated Pasture, Field and Rocky 
Field. The experiments were performed in the system 
GeoDMA [18]. This system performs image segmentation, 
classification, temporal analysis and data mining, and it is 
available on the internet.  
Data related to relief, spectral information from Landsat 
images and vegetation indices EVI2 (Enhanced Vegetation 
Index 2) were used to perform the classification. For the 
classification of the areas, this work used the algorithms of 
decision tree C4.5 [19] and Support Vector Machines (SVM) 
[20], [21], using the system GeoDMA and the tools Weka 
[22] and LibSVM [23]. 
V. 
RESULTS 
In order to implement an efficient methodology for 
distinguishing cultivated pastures and native vegetation, 
several experiments were performed. In the first experiment, 
it was used the Decision Tree (DT) classifier and only 
information about topography, obtained from altitude and 
declivity, called TOPODATA [24], with a spatial resolution 
of 30 meters, to map four classes: Cultivated Pastures, Field, 
Rocky Field and Others. The class Others covered all other 
native formations in the study that are neither Field nor 
Rocky Field. The results with 8,000 samples showed that 
regions below 871.47m were classified as Cultivated Pasture 
and areas above this value were classified as native 
vegetation. However, the accuracy of the results was only 
60.0%. 
In the second experiment, two Landsat-5 TM images 
(spatial resolution of 30m) were used for the orbit/point 
220/74, acquired on 06/01/2006 and 07/27/2009. These 
images were georeferenced from NASA database (Global 
Land Cover Facility – GLCF). Various spectral attributes, 
such as mean, amplitude, homogeneity and entropy were 
extracted for bands 1-5 and 7. These were combined with the 
relief data previously used to classify the four classes. The 
classification accuracy based on decision tree slightly 
improved to 63.50%. 
Because of the confusion between Field and Rocky Field 
classes, these were combined into a single class. For 12,000 
samples, the results using the DT algorithm increased the 
accuracy to 71.65%. Finally, the SVM was also tested on the 
same set of samples, and the classification accuracy was 
73.65%. 
In the last experiment, it was added to the previously 
used set of attributes the time series of images EVI2 MODIS 
sensor (250m spatial resolution), with an interval of 16 days 
for the years 2006 and 2009. In addition to measuring 
accuracy, Kappa Coefficient [25] showed significant values 
in this experiment. Using the typology of four classes, the 
decision tree resulted in 60.15% of accuracy and Kappa 
equal to 0.468, while an accuracy of 67.20% and Kappa of 
0.563 for SVM. With the combination of classes Field and 
Rocky Field, the accuracy increased to 73.27% (DT) and 
82.12% (SVM), as well as Kappa Coefficient, that 
corresponded to 0.599 (DT) and 0.7319 (SVM). Table II 
summarizes the experiments performed so far.

(TOPODATA, Landsat and EVI2) and the SVM algorithm 
obtained the best classification, with an accuracy of 82.12% 
and Kappa of 0.7319. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In order to develop a methodology to combine image 
processing and analysis to identify areas of pasture and 
grassland formations of the Brazilian Cerrado, some 
experiments were performed. The best classification result 
was the one that combined different spatial resolutions and

the SVM algorithm, with an accuracy of 82.12% and Kappa 
of 0.7319, distinguishing areas of cultivated pasture and 
native grassland. 
However, further experiments will be carried out, by 
integrating images from different sources to aid in the 
characterization of targets. Images of high spatial resolution, 
as well as techniques of Linear Spectral Mixture Model and 
principal components will be tested to evaluate the most 
proper features for each of the targets.
