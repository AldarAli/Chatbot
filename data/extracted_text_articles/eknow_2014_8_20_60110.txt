Abstract— This paper describes an agent based model of a start-
up business firm for analyzing the conflict between the 
organizational performance and its employee motivation. Start-
up business firms tend to change its management strategies with 
the growth of the firm in order to increase the productivity and 
business performance. However, those changes may cause 
negative impacts on the motivation or entrepreneurship of its 
employee, and they might weaken the vitality of the firm for 
sustainable growth. According to those considerations, we have 
conducted the agent based simulation and have gotten the 
following suggestions.     1) Building management structures 
increases 
organizational 
performance 
while 
decreasing 
employee motivation.     
2) Keeping the initial informal 
management style by not building a management structure 
makes employee motivation increase, however, it makes 
organizational performance decline.     3) Informal networks 
among diversified employees can ease the negative impact of 
building a management structure.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Companies tend to build their management structures 
with the growing size of the organization in order to keep or 
enhance their organizational performance and profitability. 
“ Management structure ” means, for example, building 
organizational 
hierarchy, 
formalizing 
communication, 
creating a system of rewards, and so on. It has some 
advantages of enhancing efficiency of the company's 
operation and establishing an orderly growth. However, it 
also has some disadvantages of reducing organization 
member’s entrepreneurship and motivation, because the 
members role and power is restricted by formalized 
management system. Under those considerations, we have 
made following assumptions.  
• 
Underlying 
conflicts 
between 
organizational 
performance and employee motivation exist in a 
start-up firm. 
• 
The 
changes 
of 
organizational 
management 
strategies may effect on those conflicts. 
According to the assumptions, we propose an agent based 
model, which consists of organization utility and individual 
utility functions which represent organizational performance, 
and employee motivation. 
The first purpose of this paper is to present an agent 
based model for analyzing the effects of building a 
management structure for both organizational performance 
and member’s motivation. The second purpose is to detect 
the factors for the mitigating disadvantage of building a 
management structure. 
In organizational life cycle theory, there are many 
definitions of organizational growth stages [1], and they are 
frequently used in organization management because  easy to 
be understood intuitively. However, they are criticized that 
they tend to fall into tautology, for example, organizations go 
into “formalization stage” because they formalize their 
management [2]. In order to overcome the tautology and 
make the discussion in the organizational life cycle to be 
more meaningful, it is important to focus on not only 
management style itself, but also its effect on organizational 
members' motivation, because the organizational growth 
stage transition should be decided considering the conflict 
between 
organizational 
performance 
and 
employee 
motivation. For that reason, we have built the model for 
analyzing the conflict.   
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 
explains our model; Section 3 describes the simulation 
experiment settings; Section 4 shows the experimental 
results; Section 5 shows the experimental result which 
focuses on the informal network and diversity in employees; 
and Section 6 presents our findings and remarks as a 
conclusion 
II. 
AGENT BASED MODEL  
This section describes our agent based model for 
analyzing the effect of management style transition, which 
simplifies a real structure of an organization and the relation 
between an organization and individuals. We have applied 
the agent based modeling method [3], [4] in order to 
examine the bottom up changing process of organizational 
performance and employee motivation. In this model, 
hierarchical utility landscape is implemented based on the 
landscape theory [5], [6] that consists of two classes: 
individual utility and organizational utility.  
Fig. 1 shows an outline of the hierarchical utility 
landscape in our model. The utility function of individuals 
means experience and values of each agent. The utility 
function of the organization means strategy and business 
model of a company. When agents choose their actions, 
their own utility and their contributions to organizational 
utility are determined. Organizational utility is distributed to 
agents through a reward system.

Figure 1.  Structure of the Agent Based Model. 
In Fig. 1, a hierarchical organizational structure which 
consists of two layers is brought into our model, because it is 
commonly seen in many companies. The utility function of 
individuals means the values of each agent. The utility 
function of the organization means the business model of a 
company.  
In this model, agents choose their actions according to 
the rewards from organizations and information from another 
agent. As a result, their utility production amount for the 
organization is determined based on utility functions. Agents 
can recognize their own utility, however, they cannot 
completely recognize organizational utility. 
B. Utility Function 
The utility functions described in the previous section, 
are based on the NK fitness landscape model [7], [8]. The 
NK model determines the values of N integer sequences, and 
utility landscape is defined by the combinations of K integers. 
Fig. 2 shows a sample of integer combinations and their 
values, in case of N=6 and K=1.

The variations of utility functions are described by 
number sequences and their evaluation values. The 
evaluation value is between 0 to 1 depending on 
combinations of integers. The complexity of the utility 
landscape depends on the number of integers and their 
combinations. 
C. Choosing Actions of Agents  
Equation (1) describes that all agents changes their 
action in order to increase their satisfaction. The degree of 
agents satisfaction increases along with the rising of their 
individual 
utilities: 
Uind_i(X), 
and 
rewards 
from 
organization: Rei. The index i means the number of agents. 
 
 
(1) 
Equation (2) describes that agents imitate the actions of 
other agents whose actions are similar to them and receiving 
more rewards from the organization. Pj means the probability 
that agenti imitating the action of agentj. k means the number 
of agents. Lij means the similarity of action between agenti 
and agentj. The agents evaluate their satisfaction after 
imitation, and then return to original action when their 
degrees of satisfaction have been declined by the imitation.

We change the number of layers by controlling the 
number of subordinate agents of each upper layer agent as 
shown in Fig.3. 
 
III. 
EXPERIMENT SCENARIOS AND SETTINGS  
Based on the descriptions of the model in previous 
section, we have developed the simulator according to agent 
based computational architecture [9] in Java language. This 
section describes the scenarios and parameter settings of the 
agent based simulation experiment.  
In this experiment, we set the two types of management 
transition scenarios with three parameters based on 
organizational life cycle theory, as shown in Table 1. Those 
are 1) Building management structure with growth stage 
transition, 2) Keep initial management style throughout 
growth stages. We set each experimental condition, and 
analyze the difference of individual and organizational utility 
production amount depending on those scenarios. In scenario 
1), organizational hierarchy is enlarged, ratio of informal 
network is lower, and the degree of result-based reward is 
higher with the transition of the growth stage. In scenario 2), 
all three parameters are maintained at initial condition 
throughout growth stages. The number of agents is 
increasing from 5 to 50, and the ratio of diverse agents is 
increasing from 0% to 70% with progress from stage 1 to 
stage 4.

THE RESULTS OF COMPUTER SIMULATION   
A. Experimental Results of Organizational Utility 
Production 
At the beginning, Fig. 4 represents the result of 
organizational utility production change with the growth 
stage transition. Agents produce more organization utility in 
experiment scenario 1 than scenario 2.  
This result means that building a management structure is 
increasing the performance of the organization. On the other 
hand, organizational performance is decreasing by keeping 
the initial informal management style.

B. Experimental Results of Individual Utility Production 
Fig. 5 shows the result of Individual utility production 
change with the growth stage transition. Agents produce less 
individual utility in experiment scenario 1 than scenario 2.  
This result means that building a management structure is 
decreasing 
the 
motivation 
and 
entrepreneurship 
of 
organization members. On the other hand, the motivation of 
organization members is maintained by keeping with the 
initial informal management style compared to formalization.

C. Conflict between Organizational and Individual Utility 
Production 
In this subsection, the gap between organizational and 
individual utility production is analyzed. Fig. 6 shows the 
difference of gap comparing scenario 1 and scenario 2. 
In scenario 1, the gap between organizational utility and 
individual utility production is narrowing with growth stage 
transition. On the other hand, it is maintained throughout the 
growth stages in scenario 2 compared to scenario 1.

The result in Fig. 6 means that building a management 
structure mitigates the conflict between organizational 
performance and individual motivation while decreasing 
member’s motivation. On the other hand, organization 
members behave pursuing their motivation while neglecting 
their contribution to organizational profit by maintaining 
informal management style. 
V. 
THE KEY FACTORS FOR EASING CONFLICT   
As described in the previous subsection, building a 
management structure mitigates the conflict between 
organizational performance and individual motivation. 
However, it is achieved by sacrificing individual motivation 
and this may be a cause of preventing organization for 
sustainable growth. Therefore, it is necessary to achieve an 
appropriate balance between organizational performance and 
individual motivation. 
 
A. Informal Network 
The experimental results of simulation focusing on 
informal network are shown and discussed in this subsection. 
Fig. 7 presents the gap between organizational and individual 
utility production curve in experimental scenario 1 except for 
informal networking.  
In this experiment, the informal network ratio has 
maintained 80% and 0% throughout all stages in order to fix 
the informal communication volume among the agents. 
Other conditions; organization hierarchy and degree of 
result-based reward, are the same as scenario 1.

As seen in Fig. 7, the result of maintaining an informal 
network ratio 80% is similar to scenario 2 in Fig. 6.  This 
result means that company employees tend to pursue their 
176

motivation 
while 
neglecting 
their 
contribution 
to 
organizational profit by maintaining an informal network at 
high ratio even though building hierarchal organization 
structure and result-based reward system.  
On the other hand, organizational utility production with 
the condition of informal network ratio at 0%, is higher than 
at 80% in Fig. 7. And individual utility production has been 
kept higher than the scenario 1 in Fig. 6. This result suggests 
that building a formal communication style in the early 
stages is more effective for balancing the organizational 
performance and  employee motivation than building it in 
later stages.  
Those experiments have been conducted under the 
consideration that a communication strategy is one of the 
factors in achieving the balance. Some start-up companies 
have overcome the stagnation by acquiring new capabilities 
with 
spontaneous 
collaboration 
[10]. 
And 
in 
the 
organizational life cycle theory, it is described that 
decentralization of organizational structure is necessary to 
maintain organizational flexibility and achieve sustainable 
growth [1]. The previous studies suggest the importance of 
communication strategies based on the informal networks 
[11], [12]. 
 
B. Diversity in Organization 
Fig. 8 presents the comparison of utility production  
between uniform agents group and diversified agents group 
based on the previous study on diversity in organization [13], 
[14]. The experimental conditions are as same as in Fig. 7, 
and an informal network ratio is maintained at 80%.  
As seen in Fig. 8, the organizational utility and the 
individual utility productions are more balanced in the 
diversified group than in the uniform group. Furthermore, its 
individual utility production amount is higher than that of 
scenario 1 in Fig. 6, and the organizational utility production 
amount is higher than that of scenario 2 in Fig. 6. In stage 1, 
there is no utility production in diversified group, because 
there are no diversified agents on stage 1 according to the 
condition setting.  
Those results suggest that informal networks may 
enhance the mutual communication among organization 
members, and within uniform agents, they could have 
imitated the behavior which increases individual utility 
production because they have the same individual utility 
function; personal value or experience. As a result, they 
could have neglected 
contribution to organizational 
performance because they could increase their satisfaction 
without reward from the organization.  
On the other hand, within diversified agents, they could 
have imitated the behavior which increases contribution to 
organizational utility in order to maintain or increase their 
satisfaction with the reward form organization. The reason is 
that it is difficult to increase individual utility by mutual 
imitation for diversified agents because their individual 
utility functions are different from each other. Those 
behaviors are caused by the choosing action and maintaining 
satisfaction mechanism of the agents, which is defined in  (1).

VI. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK  
This paper has presented an agent based model for 
analyzing the effect of building a management structure in 
start-up business firms. In this paper, we have intended to 
contribute to organizational life cycle theory by analyzing 
the effect of management style transition. The advantage of 
our model is to enable analysis of the management 
structure’s effect to organizational performance and 
member’s motivation in an integrated view. 
Many start-up companies intend to increase their 
organizational 
performance 
by 
building 
management 
structure, but they tend to fall into stagnation by failure of 
keeping their growth abilities. The results of experiments in 
this paper show that the company employees tend to increase 
their contribution to organizational performance while 
sacrificing their individual motivation by building the 
management structure. This may be a cause of preventing 
start-up companies from sustainable growth. On the other

hand, company employees pursue their motivation while 
neglecting organizational performance when the initial 
informal management style is maintained. 
This paper also describes the effect of informal network 
and diversity in employees as follows.  
• 
When informal networks are expanded in uniform 
agent group, the agents tend to behave selfishly and 
neglect organizational performance. However, in the 
diversified agent group, informal networks are 
effective to balance organizational performance and 
individual motivation. This experimental result 
suggests that an informal network in diversified 
organization is a key factor for achieving sustainable 
growth 
by 
mitigating 
the 
conflict 
between 
organizational 
performance 
and 
employee 
motivation. 
• 
Building a formal communication style in the early 
stages 
is more 
effective 
for 
balancing 
the 
organizational 
performance 
and 
employee 
motivation, compared to building it in the later 
stages. 
In the further work, we would conduct additional 
experiments and analysis, and detect more key factors for 
sustainable growth of start-up business firms by balancing 
the organizational performance and employee motivation.
