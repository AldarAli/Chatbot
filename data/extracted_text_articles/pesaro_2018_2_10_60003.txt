Abstract— Resilience has been highlighted for the last
few years as one of the most important mechanisms of
survival and evolution of systems. However, with the
complexity and exponential advance of Information and
Communication
Technologies
(ICT),
volatility,
uncertainty and disorder have become constant in our
daily lives, creating the need for adjustments and
improvements in resilience, in order to maintain its
efficiency. As a consequence, various skills, such as
adaptation, learning, self-organization and others, have
been added to it, increasing it to antifragility. Focusing
on this process of evolution, this work confronts the
dissociation between resilience and antifragility, proving
in the end, that antifragility is the resilience in its most
advanced form.

INTRODUCTION
Today, with days full of change and uncertainty, shocks
and unexpected events have become more frequent, making
it difficult to maintain a constant equilibrium and stimulating
the emersion of a new mechanism of resilience [1][2], no
longer centered on the search for balance nor on the return to
its
original
form,
but rather on
the development
of
competences which promote improvements to the systems,
allowing them to evolve through stress and disorder.
In
this
scenario,
with
increasing
complexity
and
widespread diffusion of Information and Communication
Technologies (ICT), learning and self-organization skills
present in complex systems become essential to survive,
providing
to
the
systems
a
greater
adaptability
and
efficiency, which allow them not only to resist, but also to
evolve in the face of chaos [3].
This "new" mechanism of survival and evolution, called
resilience by many, is called antifragility by Taleb [4],
describing it as something beyond resilience because it
improves with shocks and it is not only resistant to them.
However,
such
dissociation
between
resilience
and
antifragility does not seem coherent to us. Our objective in
this work is to demonstrate that antifragility and resilience
should not be dissociated since antifragility corresponds to
an advanced and improved form of resilience.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section
II, we present a bibliographical review addressing (1)
resilience,
through
its
epistemological
origin
and
the
definitions of Holling [5][6] and (2) complexity and ICT,
and how they are intertwined with resilience. In Section III,
we show the antifragility and the evolution of resilience and
we compare their definitions in order to prove their
similarities.
Finally,
in
Section
IV,
we
present
our
concluding remarks.
II.
RESILIENCE
A. ITS EPISTEMOLOGICAL ORIGIN AND THE HOLLING’
DEFINITIONS
Coming from the Latin term "resiliens", whose meaning
is "to turn back", resilience, in general, refers to the ability of
an object (agent or system) to return to or recover its original
shape or position after having been stressed [7].
Initially addressed in studies with children, in which it
was linked to the degree of adaptation of beings in different
situations [8], resilience was defined as: "the persistence of
systems and their ability to absorb change and disturbance
and
still
maintain
the
same
relationships
between
populations or state variables" (Holling [5]). However, after
other studies, it was evident that resilience is not only related
to internal factors (or characteristics of being), but also to
external factors [9] - [13].
Still in this light, Rutter [14] states that resilience does
not come from the personality of each subject, but from a
dynamic process that varies according to each context and
which presents itself in different ways, once each person
assimilates each problem in a unique way [15].
Moreover, just as we are influenced by the environment
and other agents, we also influence them, establishing an

interdependence between systems, agents and environment,
from which unpredictable scenarios do emerge, permeated
with uncertainties, volatility and instability, in which only
dynamic mechanisms will be useful in the search for survival
[16]-[20]. This idea is similar to Jen’s idea [21], where new
non-qualitative features emerge in a structural stability
through of certain dynamic characteristics of the system, and
the idea of De Florio [22], where resilience is not a property
that systems have or do not have, but rather the emerging
result of a dynamic process.
In this context, we came to see resilience in a more
holistic and systemic way, shown by Holling [6], with the
improvement
of
its
previous
definition,
through
the
categorization of resilience in:
1)
Engineering Resilience: initially described as the
ability not to suffer from disorder, remaining in constant
equilibrium [23], the resilience involved here acquires a
more dynamic character, which allows the system to change
or move in the face of stress, but, at the end of the process,
there is always a return to the initial state or position. To this,
in its more static version - where the balance is preserved
and always maintained in the same form - the definition of
robustness was linked, where robust is the one that remains
intact, resistant to shocks and disorder [4];
2)
Ecological Resilience: linked to the idea of dynamic
balance, in which systems change and evolve when they are
disturbed [4][6], changing state and/or position after stress,
in this strand, adaptation and self-organization mechanisms
are responsible for allowing systems to learn and improve
with respect to past situations, in order to better take
advantage in future ones [24][25].
In line with this broader form, and in view of the
interconnections between environment, systems and their
emerging properties, a more comprehensive and anti-
reductionist approach encompassing
complex elements
present in our daily lives becomes necessary [4].
B. ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPLEXITY & ICT
Broader than the traditional thinking, complex thinking
chooses to adopt the duality, recursion and systemicity, with
the aim of highlighting and covering all relationships and
influences among environment, systems and agents, as well
as their results and forms of dissemination [26][27].
Together with complex thinking comes the General
Systems Theory (GST), which argues that every system
around us is complex, open, dynamic and adaptive. Thus,
through the interaction between its parts and with the
environment, new properties emerge and allow the survival,
adaptation and evolution of the system, through mechanisms
of evolutionary selection [16] [28].
In general, Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) are
formed by a set of diverse agents that get directly
interconnected and act guided by common goals and by the
spirit
of cooperation,
which
allows
them
to
develop
collective competencies and evolve as a whole [29]-[32].
Still under the logic of complexity, equilibrium and
stability are rejected because they do not provide the system
with any learning or stimulus for its improvement.
In
contrast, the state "on the edge of chaos" and a no-
interference policy with bottom-up structure are exalted as
enhancers of the growth capacity and evolution of the
systems [33]-[37].
In this context, stigmergy begins to gain prominence.
Described by Grassé [38] as a coordination mechanism used
by insects - where an insect leaves traces in the environment
that influence the later work of the same or others, without
any form of planning, control or direct interaction between
the agents [39]. Nowadays, we can see stigmergy in most of
the complex systems that surround us [40]. Encompassing
mechanisms of self-organization and learning, in addition to
elements of cognition and cooperation, stigmergy provides to
the systems the ability to adapt and evolve [41] [42].
In addition, it is important to note that every complex
system consists of networks of interactions between its parts,
and
it
is
important
to
consider
its
modulation
and
technologies, as these aspects directly interfere in the
capacity of resilience and system evolution [43].
Structured systems under dense networks - with high
degree of interconnection - at the same can be very efficient -
with large and rapid exchange of information [44] - or very
problematic, since the high proliferation power of this type
of structure can quickly lead the system to collapse [45]. On
the other hand, systems based on more specialized networks,
with low redundancy (number of agents performing the same
function) - tend to be less resilient, suffering more with the
removal or inactivity of one of its agents, especially if they
are the most interconnected (hubs) [46][47].
In this context, ICT also gain prominence, since they
allow systems and agents to interconnect in different ways,
which stimulate the emergence of new contexts, paradigms
and cultures [48]-[50].
Such
as
a
complex
adaptive
system,
ICT,
when
integrated into the routine of agents, become powerful
mechanisms
of
relationship
and
of
dissemination
of
knowledge. They aid agents and systems in their processes
of innovation and learning [51], either through smoother
routines or through routines that drive systems "on the edge
of chaos" [52].
III.
THE ANTIFRAGILITY AND THE EVOLUTION OF
RESILIENCE
As an intrinsic property of complex systems, resilience
makes the system able to assimilate and adapt to its
surroundings, allowing it to evolve in the face of disorder
rather than stagnate or succumb [53]-[56].
As Hayek's neoliberal discourse dictates, no agent should
interfere with the natural trajectory of the system and/or
prevent its mechanism of self-organization from acting, as
this may weaken the system or even lead to its extinction [4].
In addition, we should not try to predict the future based on
past data – because in the face of constant changes the future
would
appear
unpredictable
–
but
rather
accept
its
uncertainty and constantly seek to improve our adaptability
to cope well with what will come [57].
This results in a "General Resilience" that gives systems
the ability to deal with uncertainties, changes and surprises
through mechanisms of adaptation, learning and self-

organization, enabling systems to improve when faced with
shocks and disturbances [58].
In consonance, we see the Adaptive Cycle of Resilience
(ACoR), which emphasizes that every system, at some point,
will go through ruptures because even in equilibrium it
accumulates fragilities and vulnerabilities [52].
Therefore, it is essential that systems improve their
resilience mechanisms, but not only that. The antifragility
emerges here, since the systems should not only seek to
resist, but rather seek to improve when exposed to volatility
and disorder [4] [52].
As Dahlberg [3] does for resilience, Taleb [4] also
portrays the malfunctions of intervention for antifragility,
arguing that both the optimization and the specialization,
from human intervention, make systems more vulnerable. In
addition to that, antifragility also acts as a powerful
mechanism of risk mitigation [59] when using creation
processes and recombination of elements to face the
unpredictable [60].
Aven [61] also highlights that, in practical terms, when
explaining a situation, we can easily replace the concept of
fragility with that of resilience – fragile is the one not being
resilient - which again demonstrates the incoherence in the
distinction between antifragility and resilience.
In the field of industry, De Florio [62] shows the
antifragility as an advanced mechanism of resilience, which
is distinguished by its elasticity and machine learning ability.
An idea also defended by Hole [63], which explains fragility,
robustness and antifragility as stages of a spectrum, in which
antifragility figures as an advanced degree of resilience.
Finally, in Table I, we interconnect concepts and
definitions of resilience, robustness and antifragility, in order
to demonstrate their similarities and resemblances, proving
that antifragility is a type of resilience, in the broadest and
most advanced form, in a quantitative way.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
At the end of this study, it is shown the equivocation
when dissociating resilience from antifragility. This is
because, after exposing some of the current definitions of
resilience
and
confronting
with
the
definitions
of
antifragility, we can affirm that antifragility is synonymous
of resilience in its most advanced form (Resiliencenew), where
systems, in addition to resisting stress and volatility, also
grow with them, thanks to their adaptive capabilities.
As proof of this, we can return to the idea of De Florio
[62] (1):
Antifragility = Elasticity + Resilience + Machine Learning
(1)
where elasticity is directly associated with the idea of
adaptability and machine learning with the capacity for self-
organization and learning of systems. The main elements of
stigmergy are as described in (2).
Stigmergy = self-organization + learning + adaptability
(2)
Aligned with this idea, we also see the description of
resilience given by Folke [24]: "is not only about being
persistent or robust to disturbance. It is also about the
opportunities
that
disturbance
opens
up
in
terms
of
recombination of evolved structures and processes, renewal
of the system and emergence of new trajectories ".
Thus, in front of the necessities, the resilience has been
improving until the “new” resilience, resulting from the mix
of stigmergy and resilience (Figure 1) - in its simple form.
Figure 1. The Evolution of Resilience
From this, we can describe antifragility as (3):
Antifragility = Resiliencenew
(3)
In addition, Taleb [4], in portraying resilience through the
figure of Phoênix – bird, which never gets extinguished,
always being reborn from the ashes after its death -
demonstrates its most archaic definition, which is today the
synonymous of robustness, in which there is only resistance
to shock, without any improvement nor learning. With such a

description, the author is denying the evolution of resilience
and refuting all its improvements, due to the increase in
complexity and the widespread dissemination of ICT.
Thus, at the end of this work and after a vast review of
the studies cited here, it is noticed that the increase in
complexity and the introduction of ICT in our daily life
triggered the process of evolution of resilience, which in its
most advanced stage appears as antifragility.
