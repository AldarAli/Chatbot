Abstract— Universal donor blood of group O is widely used 
on an emergency basis when it is impossible to define for some 
reasons a blood type of the recipient, for pediatric transfusions, 
and, especially, in cases when the blood of unusual or rare 
phenotypes. For today in transfusion medicine, still there is a 
problem of production of a qualitative donor blood in 
necessary quantity. Despite occurrence of techniques of 
enzymatic production of a donor blood, it cannot widely be 
applied in clinical practice because the enzymes being used for 
blood groups conversion are isolated from pathogenic 
microbial strains or/and produce up to 70 % injuring 
erythrocytes. Herein, alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase and α-
galactosidase of marine bacteria, operating at neutral values of 
рН, have been suggested for conversion of erythrocytes of 
blood group A, B and АВ to O in biotechnological production 
of universal donor blood. Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase 
isolated from marine bacterium Arenibacter latericius has 
found to be uncommon enzyme. It shows the maximum activity 
at рН 7.0-8.0 and remains stable up to 50°С. The enzyme does 
not cause nonspecific agglutination of erythrocytes and their 
hemolysis and unlike known analogs modifies erythrocytes of 
blood subgroup А2 and А1 into erythrocytes of blood group O. 
Characterization 
of 
the 
sequences 
encoding 
glycoside 
hydrolases of marine bacteria revealed that they shared about 
20-40% overall amino acid identity with their terrestrial 
counterparts. For further comparison of A. latericius alpha-N-
acetylgalactosaminidase gene family, the gene sequence was 
isolated and characterized. It has a single open-reading frame 
consisting of 1287 base pairs, and the deduced amino acid 
sequence revealed that the mature enzyme consisted of 428 
amino acid residues. The enzyme was estimated to be a 
homodimer with a molecular mass of subunit 48.2 kDa. The 
Arenibacter enzyme has a conserved common gene structure 
with a new glycoside hydrolases family 109. The structure of 
the putative binding sites of A.  latericius alpha-N-
acetylgalactosaminidase with NAD+ and blood group A 
antigen was predicted by molecular docking.

 INTRODUCTION  
Unlike known analogs, the enzymes from marine bacteria 
seem to be more suitable for use in biotechnology of 
production of a universal blood: a comfortable interval of 
рН for keeping the vital activity of erythrocytes, high 
specific activity and demanded specificity that does a 
transfusion as much as possible effective, safe and 
economic. Recent characterization of alpha-galactosidase 
isolated from marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. 
KMM701 showed that the enzyme has a maximum activity 
at рН 6.7-7.7 at 22ºC [1]. Alpha-galactosidase splits off 
galactose from melibiose, disaccharide Gala-l,3Gal and 
trisaccharide Galαl, 3(Fucαl,2)Gal that is a terminal 
structural element of the B antigen on erythrocytes of a 
blood type B. The results of immunological investigation of 
erythrocytes have shown that B antigens are completely 
transformed to H antigens in absence of aggregation of 
erythrocytes and their hemolysis. Enzyme does not show 
activity towards antigens A and H that is very important. 
Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidases (EC 3.2.49), that is 
capable of removing alpha-1,3-bound residues of N-
acetylgalactosamine from glycoproteins of blood group 
substances and A-erythrocytes at neutral pH, converting 
them into O group substances are of more greater practical 
interest. For example, alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase 
from chicken liver carries out conversion only blood 
subgroup А2 that is not a sufficient condition for complete 
conversion of erythrocytes of type A, and the enzyme works 
at value of acidic рН, that in its turn produces 70 % injuring 
erythrocytes [2]. The enzymes from Clostridium perfringens 
and Elisabethkingia meningosepticum recently characterized 
are unsafe for recipients because of their pathogenic 
microbial sources [3, 4].  
We studied the distribution of microbial producers of 
alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidases 
among 
860 
bacterial 
isolates from water, bottom sediment, algae, and animals 
collected in different regions of the Pacific, Indian, and 
Atlantic oceans (Collection of Marine Microorganisms of 
PIBOC FEB RAS). Only nineteen percent of the 
microorganisms tested synthesized the enzyme with the 
different level of activity and specificity towards A-
erythrocytes [5]. In view of this application, we have 
selected N-acetylgalactosaminidase of marine bacterium 
Arenibacter latericius for future characterization [6]. In this 
paper, the molecular structure of A.  latericius alpha-N-
acetylgalactosaminidase and catalytic mechanism of blood 
group A antigen hydrolyzing are suggested.

II. 
MATERIAL AND METHODS  
A. Bacterium characterization and culture conditions  
Arenibacter latericius KMM 426T was isolated from 
sandy sediment sample collected from a depth of 20m 
(salinity, 32; temperature, 18 ºC) in the South China Sea, 
near the island of Ku-Lao-Re (lat152108N, long1090702E). 
The bacterial strain KMM 426T was cultivated on medium 
containing 5.0 g/liter bactopeptone from Difco (USA), 1.0 
g/liter glucose, 0.2 g/liter K2HPO4, 500 ml of distilled 
water, 500 ml of sea water, pH 7.8. Seeding material was 
grown on a shaker (150 rpm) in 250-ml shaker flasks (with 
medium of 50 ml) for 24-30 h at 25°C to the density 109 
cells/ml. The resulting material was inoculated into 1000-ml 
flasks with 500 ml of the same fermentative medium. 
 
B. Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase purification  
The bacterial cells were suspended in 0.01 М Na+-
phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and sonicated.  Proteins were 
precipitated from the supernatant with 50-70% ammonium 
sulfate, and the resulting pellet was resolved and dialyzed in 
0.01 М Na+-phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The solution was 
loaded onto DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B (15.0×2.8 cm), and 
then on DEAE-Toyopearl 650 M (Toya Soda) (15.5×2.0 
cm) 
in 
the 
same 
buffer, 
рН 
7.2. 
Alpha-N-
acetylgalactosaminidase activity was eluted with gradient of 
0–1 M and 0-0.5 М NaCl, respectively. Active fractions 
were concentrated. 
 
C. Effect of enzyme on erythrocytes blood group-specific 
glycoproteins 
Erythrocytes washed with physiological solution were 
mixed with the enzyme solution 
(2 U/ml) in isotonic phosphate buffer, pH 7.3. After 24 h 
incubation with stirring at 36°C, the erythrocytes were 
washed thrice with physiological solution (pH 7.3) and 
mixed with corresponding sera in a series of double 
dilutions on the plates. Agglutination titer was read after 1 h 
incubation 
at 
room 
temperature. 
Excision 
of 
N-
acetylgalactosamine from BGG A +H was registered by an 
amino acid analyzer after acidic hydrolysis of low-
molecular-weight fraction of the products of fermentolysis 
obtained by gel chromatography on Sephadex G-15. 
 
D. Molecular cloning and sequence analysis 
Recombinant DNA technique was performed using 
Ins T/Aclonetm PCR Product Cloning Kit, restriction 
endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, Long PCR mix (Fermentas), 
Smart Taq Polymerase (Topotili), automatic amplifier 
(Eppendorf). Two pair of primers (For1 - 5’-GG(G/A/T) 
GC(A/T) AA(A/G) TA(T/C) ATG GGN GGN TT (T/C) 
TC–3’  and Rev1 - 5’-GG (A/G)TG (G/A)TC (G/A)TA 
(C/T)TT N TC–3; For2 - 5’-ATG ATG ATG GA(A/G) 
AA(T/C) GTN AA(T/C) TA–3’ and Rev2 -  5’-GG 
(A/G)TG (G/A)TC (G/A)TA (C/T)TT N TC–3’) were 
synthesized 
on 
the 
base 
of 
known 
alpha-N-
acetylgalactosaminidase homologue sequences to amplify 
the active site region of alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase 
using  A. latericius chromosomal DNA as a template. The 
C-termini region coding sequence was determined using 
only forward primers (F1 and F2). PCR products were 
cloned and sequenced using the automated PE/ABI 310 
DNA 
sequencer 
and 
PE/ABI-ABI 
PRISM 
BigDye 
Terminator cycle sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (PE 
Applied Biosystems). Escherichia coli strains TOP10 or 
XL1 (Evrogen) were used for standard cloning procedures. 
Nucleotide and amino acid sequences analysis were 
performed with Chromas, GenRunner. Nucleotide and 
amino acid sequences homology and similarity searches and 
alignments were carried out by using the BLAST and 
ClustalW, MUSCLE facilities. The Molecular Operating 
Environment version 2010.10 software [7] was used for 3D-
structure modeling and visualization. The theoretical model 
of A. latericius alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase 3D-
structure was constructed with the use of Homology module 
of MOE package on the based of X-ray structure of E. 
meningosepticum alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (PDB 
ID: 2IXB) as template. Molecular docking alpha-N-
acetylgalactosaminidase with blood group A antigen was 
performed with the use of Docking module of MOE. 
 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The distribution of alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase 
activity in marine bacteria showed that the enzyme is rare 
and a highest number of its producers occurred as a free-
living or marine animal-associated bacteria in tropical water 
of Pacific Ocean [5]. The extracellular glycosidase activity 
suggests that the bacterium is able to hydrolyze organic 
materials in the marine environment [8]. The enzyme 
exhibiting a high alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity 
isolated from marine bacterium A. latericius KMM 426T, 
new genus of the family Flavobacteriaceae, was found to be 
unusual 
alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. 
After 
three 
purification stages, the enzyme was homogenous and not 
contaminated with other glycosidase activities. It shows the 
maximum activity at рН 7.0-8.0 and stability up to 50°С 
during 30 min. The enzyme has exogenous mode of action. 
The enzyme does not cause nonspecific agglutination of 
erythrocytes and their hemolysis and unlike known analogs 
completely modifies erythrocytes of both blood subgroup 
А2 and А1 into erythrocytes of blood group O (Fig. 1, Table 
1).  
The enzyme properties provide a significant advantage 
of the enzyme over the alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase 
from liver that have optimum activity at pH less than 5.5 
[2]. Characterization of the A. latericius alpha-N-
acetylgalactosaminidase 
gene 
sequence 
(accession 
n.HQ108058) revealed that the enzymes shared about 84%

and 70% overall amino acid homology with uncharacterized 
proteins of Flavobacteria bacterium и Akkermansia 
muciniphila, respectively, and 37% identity and 50% 
homology 
with 
its 
terrestrial 
prototype 
from 
E. 
meningosepticum. It has a single open-reading frame 
consisting of 1287 base pairs, and the deduced amino acid 
sequence revealed that the mature enzyme consisted of 428 
amino acid residues. The enzyme was estimated to be a 
homodimer with a molecular mass of subunits 48.2 kDa and 
pI 7.99. A. latericius alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase is 
characterized by a high content of Gly (10.51%) Glu 
(7.24%) Leu (7.01%) Ala (6.78%) Lys (6.54%). Polar 
amino acid residues are predominant. A high content of 
glycine residues in the structure can be explained by 
psychrophility of most marine bacteria [8]. Despite the low 
level of identity and homology with the known alpha-N-
acetylgalactosaminidases the tertiary structure analysis of 
the Arenibacter enzyme showed that it has a common 
molecular fold with a new glycosyl hydrolases family 109 
(Fig. 2). It has been found that exogenous NAD+ does not 
influence 
on 
the 
A. 
latericius 
alpha-N-
acetylgalactosaminidase 
activity. 
The 
structure 
superposition showed cofactor binding specificity and 
strength similarity to E. meningosepticum alpha-N-
acetylgalactosaminidase, belonging to family 109 (Fig. 2). 
The structure of the putative binding site of blood group A 
antigen 
trisaccharide 
with 
A. 
latericius 
alpha-N-
acetylgalactosaminidase 
was 
predicted 
by 
molecular 
docking (Fig. 3). The trisaccharide moiety was found to be 
close to NAD+ and residues Tyr 178, His 180, Tyr 209 and 
Tyr 292, which were invariant within the GH109 family.  
Structurally functional researches of glycosidases of 
marine bacteria will create a basis for optimal genetic 
construction of recombinant protein for working out of a new 
highly effective and hi-tech method of universal donor blood 
production for a safe and easy accessible transfusion.
