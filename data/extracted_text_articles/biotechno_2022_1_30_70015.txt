Abstract—Climate change will have serious repercussions on
the planet, including an increase in solar irradiance. The aim
of this article was to study how this problem will affect the
behaviour of plants. This is a topic of high relevance in Systems
Biology and Metabolic Networks. In particular, we will study
the metabolic pathway known as the ascorbate-glutathione cycle.
For this purpose, solar irradiance over the course of a year was
modelled using the Amplitude Modulation technique and will
serve as an input to this metabolic pathway. The aim was to
study how the plant behaves in the different seasons of the year
and how much increase in solar irradiance the plant will be able
to withstand.

I. INTRODUCTION
Light/dark cycles play an essential role in regulating plant
growth and development. On the other hand, computer sim-
ulation is a key technology increasingly used in systems
biology to analyze the dynamic behavior of plant metabolome.
Therefore, solar irradiance becomes a relevant parameter for
plant models. However, very few models contemplate this fact,
and in the best of cases, they only simulate a few days.
Numerous algorithms have been developed to predict solar
irradiance from meteorological data [1]. However, linking
these calculations with model simulation can become difficult
and many times such excessive precision is not necessary.
Therefore, our aim was to address this question looking for a
simple algorithm to simulate daily solar irradiance. For that,
we have chosen the modulation technique known as Amplitude
Modulation (AM), widely used in electronic communication
in the transmission messages with a radio wave [2]. The
corresponding equations have been adapted to design a basic
model able to generate quasi-real solar irradiance data, which
can be used as an input for metabolic pathways. Specifically,
the ascorbate-glutathione redox pathway in chloroplasts has
been studied [3][4] (see Figure 1).

II. MAIN RESULTS
The first step is to have approximate information about solar
irradiance data at the target location for a typical year. It is
also necessary to take into account the duration of day and
night for that place. As a proof of concept, we shall consider
the city of Albacete (Spain) (Lat/Long 38.998/-1.853) for the
case of global horizontal irradiance in a typical meteorological
year [5].
The equations have been described in a normalised way
(maximum solar irradiance is 1), and a random value will be
used to simulate real fluctuations. This factor can be adapted

and modified ad-hoc. Figure 2 shows a zoom for the 7 first
days of winter and Figure 3, for summer. As can be seen,
intensity of solar irradiance is different, and the length of
light/dark periods has changed.
Figure 4 shows the normalised solar irradiance simulated
through this technique for a year (8,760 h). This methodology
is easily adaptable to other geographical locations.
Then, this yearly light/dark model is used to feed a complex
metabolic pathway, in particular the ascorbate-glutathione cy-
cle using Tellurium [6], a Python environment for reproducible
dynamical modelling of biological networks. This cycle in-
volves the photosensitive enzyme ascorbate peroxidase (APX)
and Figure 5 shows the changes in the APX concentration over
a year.
III. CONCLUSION
The model herein proposed can be easily used to simulate
solar irradiance to input plant metabolic models. As a future
work, we plan to increase the solar irradiance and study how it
affects to the chloroplast; additionally we will consider other
photosensitive pathways and geographic locations. All of them
following the guidelines proposed in [7].
