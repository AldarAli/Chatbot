Community (W3C), images can be semantically 
indexed with metadata. The explicit representation of 
image contents is made possible by using ontologies 
that provide a common and shared understanding of a 
domain at both human users and application levels. 
The approach that we are proposing in this paper is a 
semantic indexing of images based on conceptual 
method. To make efficient the semantic indexing, we 
also propose a recommender system. User profiles: 
static and dynamic profiles are combined and 
supported by the system we have developed to suggest 
recommendations to users. The preferences of each 
user are taking into account to provide customized 
recommendations.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
 
The growth of multimedia data and in 
particular images caused not only a need for storage 
but also the need to get access to those images. So 
as to these data to be usable, they need to be 
effectively referred back to as in a catalogue. The 
techniques presented below, called indexing, 
propose to attach to an image a set of descriptors 
that describe their content.   
Many approaches seek the use of semantics to 
extract the representative of images content 
descriptors. These descriptors are then used to 
allow the system to retrieve the images of interest 
to the user. A set of keywords, names, nominal 
sentences are mapped to the concepts that they 
represent [2]. In these approaches, an image is 
represented as a set of concepts. To achieve this, the 
semantic structures of image representations are 
needed. These structures can be dictionaries, 
taxonomies or ontologies [3]. They can be either 
manually or automatically generated. They are 
widely used to improve the efficiency of images 
retrieval. There are generally three types of 
indexing: classic, conceptual and ontological. The 
classical indexing is based either on lexical or 
syntaxical analysis of the images content by taking 
into account keywords occurrences. The conceptual 
indexing is a statistical approach that aims to 
extract the semantics contained in the images. This 
approach groups terms that have common features 
in images and considers that each group represents 
a semantic. The terms chosen should allow to  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
retrieve the relevant images with respect to the 
representation of user needs. Two parameters are 
taken into account in classical indexing: language 
of 
representation 
and 
discriminating 
power. 
[4][5][6] [7].   
A new generation of methods is to consider 
the concepts rather than words. The conceptual 
indexing allows to identify the concepts and / or 
instances of ontology that appear in the images. The 
approach proposed in [15] aims to understand the 
specific requirements of users in order to meet their 
needs. Users propose instances of concept in their 
queries such as the acquisition time and the type of 
sensor and especially select the concepts by which 
they are interested. The researchers also assumed 
that the terms can carry a semantic structure whose 
they try to extract the concepts as a unit of semantic. 
To achieve this purpose, several approaches have 
emerged. The approach proposed in [7][8][9] aims 
to avoid the polysemy and synonymy of terms used 
as 
descriptors 
by 
conventional 
statistical 
approaches. 
It 
groups terms 
with 
common 
characteristics in their appearance in the images. 
Another approach consists of identify the elements 
of the ontology. This approach was used in [10] 
[11][12][13]. 
Other 
approaches 
extract 
“expressions”. The extraction of expressions is 
important because the instances of the concepts are 
often composed of such elements [10][14].  
Another type of ontological indexing approach 
is to rely on ontologies to retrieve images; this type 
of indexing is called ontological indexing. The 
ontological indexing put forward the fact that the 
meaning of textual information depends on the 
conceptual relationships between the objects to 
which they refer to [1] [16]. Ontological indexing is 
possible only by the existence and use of resources 
explicitly describing the information corresponding 
to objects [17][18]. Regarding ontology usage for 
images indexing, Khan [19] proposed a method 
based on sub-trees "regions" of ontology. Regions 
of an ontology represent different concepts. 
Concepts that appear in a given region are mutually 
disjoint concepts from other regions. The region 
containing the largest number of concepts is 
selected. Then all the selected concepts that also 
appear in other regions are deleted. In a region, the 
selection is made through the use of "semantic 
distances", by taking into account of paths between

concepts in the ontology. The concepts that 
correlate with the greatest number of other concepts 
are selected for indexing. Woods [20] proposed the 
same method of indexing, but his approach 
retrieves similar images. 
The studies performed in this paper consist in 
comparing the existing semantics indexing methods 
through large collections of images and present 
their advantages. Following, we will propose a 
technique that meets better the needs of users. 
Finally, we will propose a recommendation system 
for the semantics used by users to retrieve images. 
This includes a new factor to better take into 
account the user interactions with the retrieval 
system to perform specific recommendations. 
 
II. 
EMERGSEM APPROACH 
 
We note that once the images are annotated, 
different needs for access to these images appeared, 
each corresponding to a specific action: sequential 
scan of a set of images in the case where the user 
does not really have idea of what he wants, image 
search, when the user knows exactly what he wants 
and finally the image classification, which helps 
users to combine images with similar features and 
thus provides a simplified representation of an 
ordered set of images. 
The architecture of the suggested system is 
shown in Figure 1.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
      
 Figure 1. EMERGSEM model 
 
We propose the next two steps to realize 
EMERGSEM system. The system is equipped with 
image retrieval functionality and recommendations 
ranking technique to facilitate image retrieval and 
recommendations generation.  The approach 
proposes a technique based on ontology concepts. 
Concepts are used to select image semantics that 
are then used to retrieve images. Then, the system 
makes semantics recommendation using three 
fundamental steps: acquiring preferences from the 
user’s input data, computing recommendations and 
suggesting the recommendation to the user. 
 
III. 
SEMANTIC INDEXING 
 
In this section, we present an approach for 
semantic indexing of images based on concepts. To 
facilitate semantic indexing of images, we propose 
a conceptual indexing to end users. So users can 
provide keywords that represent instances of 
concepts of ontologies used to store the semantics 
of images they want as we show in Figure 2.  
 
        Figure 2. Semantic indexing 
 
The system selects the most similar semantics 
corresponding to instances proposed by user i.e., 
the concepts belonging to semantic of the retrieved 
image. This selection is based on the following 
algorithm. 
 
        Figure 3. Retrieval Algorithm 
 
For ki instances submitted by the user, we 
define the probability that these instances appear in 
the instances of each semantic displayed Nc. The 
retrieval probability is then computed as follows: 
     
   
       
Based on the semantic interpretations provided, the 
similar semantics containing these instances can be 
obtained. Lastly, the image semantics that contain 
greater instances are retrieved. Subsequently, the 
user can select the appropriate semantic of 
semantics displayed to index the image.  
The process of the concept-based image retrieval 
depicted can be described as follows: 
(1) User proposes keywords indicating the 
content of images. 
(2) EMERGSEM system verifies the 
presence of the instances proposed by user in each 
concept of the ontologies.  
(3) Once the instances are validated, the 
program invokes an ontology query service. The 
semantics containing the instances are displayed 
thanks to the ontology search engine.  
(4) User selects the semantic that describes 
better the needs image. Image is retrieved from the 
image database. 
 (5) Finally, the results are displayed to the 
user. 
 
IV. 
RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM 
 
Recommendation system has been a hot research 
topic in recent years. To recommend items to a 
user, the system must have a representative profile 
preference. To 
build this, 
it must 
collect

information about it, either directly or indirectly 
[21][22]. Recommender systems help users to 
manage 
information 
overload 
by 
providing 
personalized advice on content and online services. 
The term “recommendation system” generally 
describes a system that produces customized 
recommendations to users, and has the effect of 
leading the user to interesting items in a large space 
of possible options [23][25]. 
A recommendation system we propose aims to 
recommend images semantics to a user in 
correspondence with its tastes and preferences. The 
aim is both to minimize the time spent on research, 
but also to suggest relevant semantics that would 
not be spontaneously consulted and increase the 
overall satisfaction of users.  
The first step in the realization of the 
recommendation system is to extract the profiles of 
users. The next section focuses on this purpose. 
 
A. Acquiring Profiles 
Acquisition of user profiles is composed of 
two important steps: extraction of static and 
dynamic profiles.  
The static profiles are also called independent 
part of the domain. They take into account any data 
that has no connection with the domain. There may 
be personal user information such as professional 
status. This part does not require large resources 
since users, before using the system are required to 
create an account and thus to provide such personal 
information.  
The 
dynamic 
profiles 
are 
also 
called 
dependent part of the domain or the active model. It 
consists of data that represent the needs, interests 
and goals of the user i.e., user preferences. This part 
will be constructed by the system in response to 
user interactions with the system: a history of the 
user’s interactions with the recommendation 
system. To achieve this, the system needs to collect 
such data on assessments of the user. The analysis 
of these data is then used to build a model of the 
user’s preferences that will be used by the system to 
recommend the semantics deemed relevant for the 
user. A model of the user’s preferences, i.e., a 
description of the types of semantic that interest the 
user is represented. There are many possible 
alternative representations of this description, but 
one common representation is a function that for 
any semantic predicts the likelihood that the user is 
interested in that semantic. For efficiency purposes, 
this function may be used to retrieve the n 
semantics most likely to be of interest to the user 
[26].  
B. Classification of Preferences 
What we learned from this work is that the 
comparison between the profiles leads to the 
formation of user groups close to each other, groups 
called "communities". So we can say that the notion 
of community is a key factor in a recommender 
system to produce recommendations [24]. It is clear 
that the positioning of users in the spaces depends 
crucially on the dynamic profiles. The dynamic 
profiles of each user then evolve along with the user 
himself. 
To group profiles, we think that the formal 
concept analysis [29][30][31] and Galois lattices 
[32][33][34] will be indispensable. A lattice of 
Galois can regroup, exhaustively objects in classes, 
called “formal concept”, using their shared 
properties. A lattice is typically based on a Boolean 
matrix, called matrix context and denoted C, whose 
rows represent a set of objects O that we wish to 
describe and columns, a set of attributes A that 
these objects have or have not.

Suppose we have a description of the 
following profiles (see Table I). This description is 
based on the list of dynamic profiles that users have 
chosen or not. Possession of the property      by 
object      reflects the existence of a relationship 
  between them:    . The existence of this relation 
  between O and A is materialized in the matrix of 
context   by a value "true" or "false". The triplet 
          is called a formal context or context. 
A set X ⊂ O is the set of attributes jointly owned by 
all object X and is given by the function    
                           
Inversely a set Y ⊂ A is the set of objects jointly 
owned by all object Y and is given by the function 
                           (3) 
The pair (f, g) is called a Galois connection. A 
concept is any pair C = (X, Y) ⊂ O × A, such that 
objects in X are the only one to have attributes in 
Y; in other words X x Y is, if we add permutations 
of O and A, a maximal rectangle in C, i.e. 
                      
To illustrate this approach of formal Concept, the 
Table I shows that the set X= {Semantic 2, 
Semantic 3} gives one formal concept since 
                    
            , and 
this formal concept is ({Semantic 2, Semantic 3}, 
{User 2, User 3}), while the set X’ = {Semantic 1, 
Semantic 4} doesn’t give a formal concept because 
              
            
                                   
The Galois lattice is represented by a Hasse 
diagram as shown in figures 4. “Sem” means 
Semantic.

Figure 4: Display Galois lattice of users profiles 
 
In this Figure, the static profiles are connected 
to dynamic profiles. For example we see that the 
users 1, 2 and 3 have selected semantics 3 while the 
users 2 and 4 chose the semantic 7. 
One of important advantages of classification 
based on Galois lattice is that for a given formal 
context table the resulting lattice is unique, and it is 
exhaustive. This classification will allow us to find 
all the groups of static profiles in relation with a 
group of dynamic profiles and represent them 
similarly. 
 
C. Emergent Semantic 
Image semantics are provided to users after 
the 
proposition 
of 
instances. 
Users 
choose 
appropriate semantic in the list, i.e., the semantic 
that better meet their research needs. Once a 
semantic is used to search for images, a weight is 
assigned by the recommendation system which is 
responsible for the link between the semantic and 
the user. The users interact with the system, and the 
semantics used will be evaluated by the system. 
The system can therefore recommend these 
semantic to them. The weight is calculated by:  
         
      , (5) 
where Pbt is the probability of a semantic i to be 
chosen in image k. 
D. Recommendation List 
Recommendation list may then be introduced, 
once user profiles are grouped. It is to look for 
similarities between the dynamic profiles of each 
constituted 
group 
to 
make 
customized 
recommendations. Similarity measures considered 
here satisfy the following properties for all (u, v)  
  : 
- 
sim (u, v)         (sim mean similarity) 
- 
sim (u, v) = 1; if and only if u and v have 
the same common profile; 
- 
sim (u, v) = 0; If u and v do not have a 
elements of comparison [24].  
The method chosen to determine the user’s profiles 
similarity is cosine similarity since the cosine 
similarity seems very promising. It provides an 
accurate measure of similarity [27][28].  
The recommendation list given to user is 
consisted of two parameters: the personalized 
recommendations representing the preferences of 
each user and the general recommendations 
representing a mostly used semantic of each image, 
that are the emergent semantics. Unlike specific 
recommendations 
the 
emergent 
semantic 
is 
recommended to all users.  
Let u1 and u2 be two users with dynamic 
profiles specifying their utility functions of the 
subsets                
. We then calculate 
the similarity typically using for example the cosine 
similarity [25] by: 
                 
 
             
             
  
        
       
        
          
If                              then u1 and u2  are 
similar. Note that the threshold varies from one 
image to another, and this threshold is not stable. In 
order to compute the threshold between the 
instances of concepts, we calculate the average of 
common with proposed instances. Let x and y 
denote the feature sets of the common and proposed 
instances, respectively for image I. The threshold is, 
          
   
   , (7) 
For example for image 1 (Table III, Table IV), the 
threshold= 15/21= 0,714. 
 
V. 
EXPERIMENTATION 
 
       To illustrate how the combined approaches 
perform in practice, it was evaluated on a real-
world semantics recommendation application and 
compared 
its 
performance 
with 
the 
simple 
semantics indexing. The following table (Table II) 
gives the variations of images indexing durations. 
We note that the data in the first column of the table 
(Ti (hour)) are higher than those of other columns 
which remain stable. 
       The fundamental reason is that the first index is 
performed without any semantic recommendation. 
Users have suggested instances of concepts to 
retrieve images. But in the other columns, the 
search time is greatly reduced because the system 
took into account the preferences of the users to 
make their recommendation. The result is that they 
have a huge time saver. The following figure 
(Figure 5) shows indexing duration variation.

Figure 5: Indexing duration 
 
The figure 5 shows a graph with four curves 
representing the indexing duration of the 4 images. 
We note that the curves decrease when users had 
the recommended semantics for images semantic 
indexing. Then, the curves remained stable with 
values around 10.8 seconds. The recommendation 
system has helped to save time during semantic 
indexing. 
The following tables (Table III, IV and V) 
shows the different steps of calculating the 
similarity between user profiles to make them 
recommendations based on their preferences. Table 
3 is an example of instances of concepts proposed 
by users.

We note that for the image 1, user 1 proposes 8 
instances of semantic 1 while user 2 provides 7 
instances of semantic 2 and user 3 has 6 instances 
of semantic 1, etc. Common instances of each user 
are listed in Table IV (example: Among the 
proposals made by users 1 and 2 in Table III, IV 
instances are identical). Table V gives information 
on the results of the similarities between the 
dynamic profiles. To make recommendations of a 
semantic to a user group, only dynamic profiles that 
have a similarity greater or equal to the threshold 
are recommended for users concerned (see Figure 
6), i.e., the profiles are considered similar according 
to the cosine similarity.

The semantics of the image 1 can be recommended 
to users 1 and 3, the semantics of image 3 will be 
suggested to user 1 and 2, and those of image 2 to 
the users 2 and 3.  
We 
compare 
our 
method 
with 
two 
classifications methods (SVM and Naive Bayes). 
The next table shows the result of our experiment. 
Three parameters are taken into account: the 
performance (possibility to reduce the errors) and 
classification time.

The experiment was conducted on 632 profiles of 
users on different classifiers. The results are 
presented in the Table VI. We note that all methods 
are efficient because they reduce significantly the 
error rate with different classification time. We find 
that the results of our approach are better because it 
can regroup, exhaustively objects in classes. 
Although there is a tradeoff between complexity 
and performance, it is still viable choices when 
better performance is considered.

CONCLUSION 
 
In this paper, we propose an efficient method 
for semantics recommendation based on indexing.  
We first formalize semantic indexing based on 
concepts of ontology. Then, we propose a similarity 
by exploiting the relationship between dynamic 
profiles. The similarities are used to make tighter 
recommendation of semantics to the users. The 
purpose of this recommendation system can be 
achieved through the management of static and 
dynamic profiles derived from semantic indexing. 
The combination of semantic indexing and 
recommendation system calls for the development 
of more flexible recommendation methods that

types 
of 
recommendations that are of interest to them rather 
than being “hard-wired” into the recommendation 
engines provided by most of the current vendors 
that, primarily, focus on recommending semantics 
to the user and vice versa. The second requirement 
of interactivity also calls for the development of 
tools allowing users to provide inputs into the 
recommendation process in an interactive and 
iterative manner, preferably via some well-defined 
user interface.
