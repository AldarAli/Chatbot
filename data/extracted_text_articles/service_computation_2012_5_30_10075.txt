Abstract— Current advances of television systems provide 
interactive user experiences. This paper proposes a Video 
Object Annotation Platform (VOAP), which enables TV 
viewers can be provided with additional information during 
they is watching TV. The platform anchored to semantic data 
serialization to support a sharing of annotations located to 
specified object at a moment. With the platform, content 
providers can publish additional information about objects 
appeared in a program and the viewer can easily access the 
information. We expect that the proposed platform will 
provides a novel business model for advertisement market by 
providing seamless information transfer among consumer 
(viewer), advertisers (company) and mediation (broadcasting 
company). As an ongoing work proposing an information 
exchanging environment in interactive TV platforms, we 
implemented a user-side application proving the proposed 
concept.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
With the name of IPTV (Internet Protocol Tele-Vision), 
current advances of TV systems provide people interactive 
experiences like VOD (Video On Demand) service and time-
shifted watching [1]. Broadcasting companies and research 
groups are trying to put more services showing advantage of 
such interactive TV system [2], so that, the television 
viewers can enjoy various experiences in the TV screen. A 
TV answering user questions is not a new research topic, 
because, it ensures many new opportunities in commercial 
Ads. From casual one like “Who is that actor?” to 
complicated ones “ Where the movie is taken from?” and 
“ Where can I buy that thing?” the informative questions are 
easily come up when we watch TV. An environment to 
provide such additional information to viewers during 
watching TV is also important to broadcasting companies or 
content providers. They can not only answer such question 
with additional information, but also expose them to 
commercial advertisement  at the screen without troubling  
them. 
This paper proposes a video object annotation platform 
for digitalized and bi-directed TV environment, and it is 
anchored to current data serialization techniques that let data 
to be interchangeable and reusable through a standardized 
data representation format like RDF (Resource Description 
Framework) [RDF refer]. The proposed platform support a 
sharing of annotations located to specified object at a 
moment, so that, content providers publishes additional 
information related to program. Then, the platform ensures 
that viewer of the movie or TV series can see and retrieve the 
information in the interactive TV. 
We expect that the proposed platform will provide a 
novel business model for Ad market by providing seamless 
information transfer among consumer (viewer), advertisers 
(company) 
and 
mediation 
(broadcasting 
company). 
Contributions of this paper can be summarized as like; 1) a 
data schema for sharable movie annotation represented, and 
2) a technical design of movie annotation platform proposed. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Our basic 
idea on movie annotation and the other related work are 
described in Section 2. Overall architecture of Video Object 
Annotation Platform (VOAP) will be described in Section 3 
with two subsections, which explain details of key elements 
of the platform. Finally, Section  4 concludes the paper. 
II. 
MOVIE ANNOTATION 
Video annotation is tasks of associating graphical objects 
with moving objects on the screen. In existing interactive 
applications, only still images can be annotated, as in the 
“telestrator” system [3] used in American football 
broadcasting. Jeroen [4] developed an adaptive movie 
annotation with speech recognition techniques. The system 
helps people easily attach annotation by mapping scripts and 
a specific moment which the scripted is spoken. In the 
system the additional information like “who?” and “where” 
can be obtained from script of the program. A system 
proposed in [5, 6] helps easy annotating on moving objects 
in the scene by human. The system supports descriptive 
labels, illustrative sketches, thought and word bubbles 
communicating speech or intent, path arrows indicating 
motion, and hyperlinked regions. 
The previous works mostly are focused on how we can 
easily attach annotations on the movies and how a movie is 
explained by annotations on divided scenes. Our work is 
focused on the annotations attached to appeared object at 
each moment in a movie and how the annotations can be 
shared and spent by viewers. Of course, a technology for 
easy and correct creation of annotations is an essential issue

to be studied. We rather assume that the issues of creation of 
annotations could be solved through human labors if we have 
useful business model or motivation as we can see the 
Wikipedia [7] case. Therefore, our work is more focused on 
how the annotations can be used to enhance information 
viewers and content providers or to provide useful 
application. 
 
Figure 1.  Examplied VOAP application running on IPTV 
Figure 1 shows an example use of the attached annotation 
on the TV program. The annotation includes simple 
description about the objects we can currently see on the 
screen. Also, they provide external links containing useful 
information about the objects. By watching TV, a viewer can 
make a pause for a moment to have a look on additional 
information through the mixed annotations provided by 
broadcasting companies, sponsors of the program, and the 
other viewers.  In the example figure, some questions the 
viewer may be interested will be seen. For example, an 
online market which sells the doll in the current movie scene, 
a name of actress appeared now, and a name of her hairstyle 
can be provided with useful external links. 
The system proposed in this paper named VOAP (Video 
Object Annotation Platform) enables such exampled 
application. It consists of a systematic structure and a RDF 
schema which support representation and sharing of the 
video annotation data. 
III. 
VIDEO OBJECT ANNOTATION PLATFORM 
This section introduces a systematic structure of VOAP 
supporting share and the use of the video object annotation 
with semantically exchangeable data format. 
A. Architecturel of VOAP 
The architecture of VOAP is composed of three layers 
which represent three actors, namely, provider, server, and 
client, as shown in Figure 2. 
In the provider-side, there are annotation data providers 
which consist of content (program) provider, economically 
related actors like sponsor, and ordinary viewers. In our 
scenario, the content provider take charge of deciding 
authorities for attaching annotation to a movie. Content 
provider distributes authorities, divided by each time seconds, 
to the other actors to reduce garbage data. The other actors 
can attach annotations to only moments of program they 
have an authority. Of course, there could be other way to 
distributes authorities, for example, Wiki [8]. However, we 
believe that this approach will be effective to minimize 
garbage annotation data and to secure rich annotation data.

The server of the platform stores the created annotation 
data to be accessible to clients like applications run in the 
digital TVs or set-top boxes. As the annotation data are 
represented 
as 
RDF 
data 
formation 
to 
enhance 
interoperability, the server-side is equipped with a semantic 
data store like Jena [9]. By keeping annotation data persistent, 
the server has three types of access points; SPARQL, 
program index, program-timeline index. SPARQL provides 
SPARQL, as a standardized query language for semantic 
web data, allows a user to query on data. As proved in 
previous researches on benchmarks on RDF data stores, the 
store lacks of stable response time for large scale of data. 
Some of recently approaches [10] invented with massive 
computation power to create index data are applicable to 
build indexes. 
The applications in clines-side provide user-oriented 
services with the shared annotation data as illustrated in 
figure1. The applications are running on the digital TV or 
set-top box that both are connected to the internet and are 
equipped with operating system for various applications. 
 
B. Schema for Annotation Data 
The video object annotation data are represented as RDF 
in VOAP. As a serialize-able data format, it promises 
interoperability and reuse of data among different 
applications. Figure 3 depicts a RDF data schema used for 
representing the annotation data. As the figure shows, the 
schema is related to the BBC Programs ontology [11] and 
FOAF (The Friend of a Friend) [12]. The first one is usable 
to universally publish program-related information, whereas, 
the last one is exploited to represent information about agent 
or person. 
Instances of po:program from the BBC program ontology 
are linked as a program which have a annotation data, and 
foaf:person instances are linked to denote who created the 
annotation. Then, the annotation data which is an instance of 
voap:annotation has several type of attributes as followings.

C. Polygon rendering 
Polygon rendering is employed to designate an exact spot 
to be located an annotation in a scene. The  computation  of  
polygonal  areas  is  a  common  operation  in cartographic  
systems. The method of area calculation employed is 
dependent to some extent on the data format. A formula  
which was  proven  long  before  the  days  of  computer- 
assisted cartography,  Pick's  Theorem,  calculates  areas  of 
polygons  whose  vertices  are  points  in  a  regular  grid.  
The basic  equation  is AREA =  GI  +  1/2*GB  -  1  where  
GI  is  the  count  of  grid points  inside  of  the  polygon  and  
GB  is  the  count  of  grid points  in  the  polygon's  
perimeter  [13].

Using the polygon rendering algorithm in Figure 4, the 
area that includes an object annotated can be encoded when 
the annotation data is provided. Then, the area can be 
informed to the clients after decoding the rendered data. 
IV. 
IMPLEMENTATION 
To prove a concept of VOAP, we set up an annotation 
data repository at service-side and implemented a client-side 
application, so called, Interactive InforBox. The service-side 
data repository is equipped with Jena TDB [9] for serving 
queries on RDF data through SPARQL, RDF data query 
language. When he/she pause the VOD playing, the 
application invokes a data request query to the data 
repository with SPARQL constrained with a eclipsed time of 
current VOD and an URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) 
assigned to each VOD.

Upon requested, it returns a video object annotation data 
to be shown over the current scene. The answer for the 
requested SPARQL includes a set of annotations with 
appearance of the annotations and external links related to 
the featured objects as shown in Table 2.  
The Interactive InforBox application reads the annotation 
data and decodes rendered polygons to pop-up InforBox 
window. As Figure 5 shows, a television view can see the 
colored buttons with corresponding objects over the current 
scene. When the button clicked by the viewer, the screen is 
redirected to a web page containing related information of 
the object, so that, the viewer can supplied with additional 
information, such as, details on the object, commercial 
advertisements, and other related contents .

CONCLUSION 
This paper introduced the VOAP supporting share and 
use of the video object annotation. The platform is consisted 
of a data model for encoding video object annotation data 
and the data exchange scenario. RDF based data model 
promises 
an 
information 
exchanging 
environment 
universally usable in heterogeneous interactive TV platforms. 
And, the data exchanging environment can open a business 
model by adding a new information channel to the television. 
As a work in progress, we implemented a user-side 
application proving the proposed concept.  
By referring web editorial tools like Wiki, a strategy to 
resolve multiple annotation attached to the same object at the 
same moment need to be developed . Further developments 
on the platform will cover the applications useable in the 
platform for enhancing the information transfer among 
consumer, advertisers (company) and mediation. An 
annotation tool equipped with object tracing technology will 
be also provided to ensure easier annotating on the moving 
video object.
