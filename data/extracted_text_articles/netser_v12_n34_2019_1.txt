Abstract— Timely data services supported by efficient vehicular 
communications are essential for connected and autonomous 
vehicles and future transportation systems. In this paper, a 
cluster-based two-way data service model is introduced to 
promote efficient cooperation between Vehicle-to-Vehicle and 
Vehicle-to-Infrastructure communications, or namely V2X, so 
that the service delivery performance across the vehicular 
network can be improved. Our results show that the cluster-
based model can significantly outperform the conventional non-
cluster schemes, in terms of service ratio, network throughput 
and energy cost. 
Keywords— V2X communications; clustering; service delivery 
model; energy cost. 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
The main challenge in the development of smart mobility 
and intelligent transport systems is how to effectively manage 
traffic congestion, reduce car accidents and energy 
consumption with the rapidly increasing number of vehicles 
and complex road networks. It is vital to make traffic 
information 
(e.g., 
speed 
and 
vehicle 
density) 
and 
environmental information (e.g., weather and road condition) 
timely available for road users and network operators, to 
ensure road safety and traffic efficiency [1].  
The Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) is an extended 
version of the Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) and 
intended for improving driving safety and efficiency through  
both vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure 
(V2I) communications. V2V and V2I can be operated 
cooperatively as V2X, making the VANET play a better role 
in modern transportation systemes under a complex traffic 
environment. 
This paper proposes a V2X-based service system where 
the clustering technique is applied to improve transmission 
and energy efficiencies by significantly reducing the number 
of V2I connections. A cluster is a group of vehicles within the 
transmission range of each other, as shown in Fig. 1 where 
cluster heads exchange data with RSU via V2I while the other 
cluster members communicate with cluster heads via V2V. A 
data service model with cooperative V2X transmission via 
clustering is also introduced in this work, for effectively 
uploading the local information to the database and 
downloading the required service data from RSUs.  
The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. 
Related work is discussed in Section II. Following the 
clustering algorithm presented in Section III, the proposed 
data service model and an energy model for performance 
analysis are presented in Section IV. Section V explains the 
simulation results produced by OMNET++, SUMO and 
MATLAB software tools. Finally, Section V concludes the 
paper. 
II. RELATED WORK 
The idea of combining V2I and V2V has been applied in 
many works on VANET. In [2], Noori et al. explore the 
combination of various forms of communication techniques, 
e.g., cellular network, Wi-Fi and ZigBee for VANETs. In [3], 
a roadside unit (RSU) plays a vital part to provide services and 
make scheduling arrangements using a simple network coding 
in a V2X approach. This approach may cost more energy to 
complete the service and does not consider the packet loss and 
associated latency caused by the failed services. In [4], 
multiple RSUs are involved in broadcasting data periodically 
to vehicles via V2I and forwarded to vehicles via V2V if they 
are outside the transmission range. This model requires 
efficient handover mechanisms to ensure stable and in-time 
data services between the vehicles concerned. 
The Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) 
technology refers to a suite of standards of Wireless Access in 
Vehicular Environments (WAVE) [5] and supports both V2V 
and V2I communications. Vehicles equipped with sensors can 
collect local traffic and environment information and 
exchange it for the similar information of other regions (place 
of interest) with RSUs. A RSU acts as an interface between 
vehicles and the vehicular network to provide vehicles the 
service information requested and pass on the collected 
information to other parts of the network. The high mobility

and density of vehicles presents a big challenge in V2X 
communications, which causes congestion in service delivery 
in this environment. In addition, moving vehicles will keep 
exchanging information between them and this will cost a 
significant amount of energy for continuous data sensing, 
transmission and processing, especially for V2I as it needs to 
cover longer distances than V2V.  
The Lowest-ID clustering algorithm is a basic method to 
select cluster head, which uses unique vehicle ID numbers as 
the selection standard [6]. This algorithm works stably in most 
MANETs but may not always be suitable for VANET due to 
higher velocity and more restricted routes for vehicles. The 
AMAC (Adaptable Mobility-Aware Clustering) algorithm [7] 
considers mainly the destination as the key factor in forming 
clusters to improve the stability of clusters and extend the 
cluster’s lifetime. However, the destination may not always be 
collected from navigation systems as drivers do not always use 
them for the known routes. A three-layer cluster head selection 
algorithm based on the interest preferences of vehicle 
passengers is proposed for multimedia services in a VANET 
[8]. This scheme is inefficient when the requirements in 
operations differ too much.  
Based on the discussion of V2X related work, a more 
efficient service delivery method is introduced in this paper by 
utilizing clusters and minimizing channel congestion caused 
by excessive V2I transmission in conventional service models. 
We will show that the cluster model outperforms the non-
cluster model at both service and energy performance levels. 
III.  CLUSTERING ALGORITHM 
In MANETs, moving vehicles can be divided into different 
sizes of clusters, such as using the “combined weight” 
algorithm to select cluster heads [9]. The selection takes the 
current position, number of neighbours, mobility, and battery 
power of vehicles into consideration. In VANETs, vehicles’ 
mobility is more limited by the road type, traffic signs and 
other traffic factors. Therefore, the elements involved in 
forming clusters in a VANET need to be adjusted accordingly. 
Clustering in VANET needs to be adjusted in accordance 
with traffic features such as high mobility of vehicles, regular 
moving tracks and directions. The clustering algorithm for 
forming and maintaining clusters should ideally be stable and 
adaptive to vehicle mobility or sudden changes in network 
topology, and provide reliable end-to-end communications 
across the network. The algorithm presented here is focused at 
the methods for forming a cluster including cluster head 
selection and cluster operation, which are discussed below.  
A. Cluster Head Selection  
Clustering in VANET is an extension of clustering in 
MANET, where the mobility and channels show different 
features. On the road networks, vehicles equipped with 
communication devices group themselves into clusters 
according to certain rules applicable to the road environment 
and traffic characteristics. Cluster size is not fixed and usually 
depends on the communication range of vehicles and the 
traffic environment.  
There are three types of nodes (vehicles) in a VANET: 
Free Node (FN), Cluster Head (CH), Cluster Member (CM). 
The clustering algorithm considers the one-hop neighbours of 
each node and the cluster size is decided by cluster head’s 
communication range. CH is responsible for collecting data 
and service requests from CMs, uploading current driving 
information (e.g., traffic is normal or congested), and 
requesting services from the RSUs. This paper defines a new 
weighting metric for selecting the CH, considering the factors, 
such as position, velocity, connectivity and driving behavior 
of the vehicles involved.  
The position of each node is obtained from GPS (Global 
Positioning System) data. The average distance, Pi, between 
CH and CM should be as short as possible, which is given by

where n is the number of neighbors of node ni, x and y are

The velocity of CH, Vi, is defined to be the difference 
between the velocity of a candidate node vi  and the average

The connectivity of the candidate node is reflected by the 
number of its neighbors, Ni. The ideal connectivity is denoted 
as σ, which represents the maximum number of neighboring

where Pmax is the distance between the i-th vehicle and the 
farthest vehicle from it, Vmax is the speed limitation by traffic 
rules that a vehicle can reach in the flow, Dmax is the maximum 
absolute value of acceleration the vehicle can reach when it is 
running. A smaller Wi indicates the higher suitability of the 
candidate for the CH.  
B. Cluster Operation   
In the environment where vehicles have high mobility, 
cluster stability is a key factor to consider. In some traffic 
scenarios, in order to improve the transmission efficiency 
some vehicles are prevented from joining in a cluster. On a 
two-way straight road, for example, a vehicle is not allowed to 
join in the cluster that is running in the opposite direction. To 
maintain an established cluster in dynamic traffic and 
environmental conditions, different types of information 
packets are used for coordinating the operation with the cluster 
and delivering services, such as: 
1) Vehicle Information Packet (VIP): It carries the basic 
vehicle information, including vehicle ID, velocity and 
position. VIP is used for starting the cluster forming process. 
When a vehicle detects itself as a free node (FN), it sends its 
VIP to its neighbours and enables them to calculate its weight 
value Wi based on (7), which is the basis of CH selection: the 
vehicle with the smallest Wi value becomes the CH. 
2) Cluster Head Announcement (CHA): When a vehicle 
considers its weight low enough to be a CH, it will broadcast 
a CHA together with its weight value Wi. Other vehicles will 
compare the received Wj with their own weight and send their 
CHA to argue if theirs have a smaller weight than Wi.  
3) Cluster Head Maintain (CHM): A node with the 
smallest Wi is elected as CH, and it then sends CHM to all its 
neighbours to declare its identity (CH ID). This packet is 
broadcast periodically if CH considers its status still suitable 
to be a cluster head.  
4) Service Data Packet (SDP): SDP consists of two parts: 
head and context. The head includes the packet ID, sender ID 
and time stamp. The context part carries the actual 
communication message such as service requests and 
collected information.  
To reduce the transmission cost, CH does not keep the list 
of its members, every CM stores the CH’s ID to identify its 
cluster. When CH broadcasts the service packets, CMs who 
have the same CH ID and the targeted service ID will receive 
the service packets. 
IV.  COOPERATIVE SERVICE MODEL 
A. Service Delivery    
In the pure V2I service model, all vehicles are directly 
connected to RSUs for service delivery, resulting in 
transmission congestion due to a limited number of frequency 
channels and higher transmitting power to cover distance 
between vehicles and RSUs.  
The service model that we have developed utilizes cluster-
based V2X communications. In this model, vehicles are 
grouped into clusters for information exchange between 
vehicles and RSUs. CHs are selected to gather and aggregate 
information collected by CMs and disseminate service packets 
to CMs via V2V. V2I transmissions take place only between 
CHs and RSUs via V2I directly, including uploading 
information to the server via RSU and downloading service 
data from RSU by CHs, as shown in Fig. 2.     
This system model enables real-time information sharing. 
In addition, the cluster-based service model has transferred 
most of the data delivery from long-range V2I to short-range 
V2V. In this way, both transmission collision in the vehicle-
RSU links and energy consumption can be reduced as RSUs 
only need to communicate with CHs. The database server 
shown in Fig. 2 stores service information including the traffic 
and environmental information such as the velocity of current 
traffic flow, real-time density of vehicles, weather conditions 
and road status, which is updated periodically. 
This service system follows the standards of IEEE 802.11p 
and IEEE 1609 family [5], which specifies 7 channels of 10 
MHz with each including one control channel and 6 service 
channels. The transmitting power levels are up to 44.8dBm for 
RSUs and 33dBm for vehicles. The control channel is used for 
exchanging control messages and safety information, while 
service channels are used for delivering service information 
packets. 
Both uplink and downlink transmissions of the proposed 
service model are described as below.  
B. Uplink Transmission 
The vehicles on roads have different regions of interest and 
tend to learn the environmental and traffic conditions in those 
regions in advance. They also collect current traffic 
information from their on-board sensors and upload it to the 
road network for traffic control. Upon generating a message 
with a high priority (e.g., an accident), it is their responsibility 
to report it to CH. Each vehicle generates packets including 
vehicle ID, request ID and CH ID. Every CM submits the 
requests with the collected information to CH and then set the 
timer to wait for services. On receiving the packets, CH 
aggregates the collected information and forward to RSU in 
uplink transmission. 
The traffic/environmental information includes the 
average speed of current flows, position, weather (rain, fog, 
lights etc.) and traffic conditions (smooth or congested etc.). 
Figure 2. Cluster-based service model

Vehicles within the same cluster may gather similar 
information, especially the weather and road conditions. In 
addition, different vehicles may request information for the 
same regions. Therefore, CH integrates the collected 
information before forwarding it to RSU. The aggregated data 
at CH will be less than what it has been collected, so the 
transmission efficiency of uplink transmission can be 
improved. Emergent messages (e.g., accidents alerts) will be 
marked with a higher priority during data aggregation.  
Each RSU maintains its own database to store the recent 
service information collected from different CHs within its 
coverage. RSUs in different areas will periodically exchange 
and update information between them. In this case, vehicles in 
one area can learn the information about a larger range of areas 
ahead. The information service helps drivers to choose the best 
routes to reach their destinations and avoid congestion and 
accidents. They can also be aware of the travelling time they 
will spend. 
C. Downlink Transmission 
Upon receiving the packets from CH, RSU updates the 
database with collected information and generates the service 
packets requested by vehicles. These packets are sent to CH in 
downlink transmission via V2I and CH will redistribute them 
to CMs via V2V. Once overhearing the corresponding service 
ID and CH ID, CM will store the packets and mark the 
received request as satisfied. If CM is not satisfied (i.e., CM 
did not receive the requested service data) during a waiting 
time threshold, this request is considered as failed. In this case, 
a new request will be generated and sent to its CH again.  
It is likely that a service is requested by multiple vehicles 
(e.g., three cars are interested in the traffic information of the 
same area), so CH disseminates data to CMs by broadcasting 
to help reduce the transmission cost. When CH broadcasts 
service packets, the CMs that are marked with the same CH 
ID and service ID will receive and save the service packets 
sent by Ch. Our model can provide real-time services for 
vehicles and allow drivers to manage their routes and time 
efficiently. 
In addition, through clustering most of the data delivery 
between RSU and vehicles (i.e., V2I) is now transformed to 
data exchange between cluster members and cluster head (i.e., 
V2V). In this way, both transmission collision and energy 
consumption at the RSUs level can be reduced.  
 This service model follows the standards of IEEE 802.11p 
and IEEE 1609 family, which specifies 7 channels including 
one control channel and 6 service channels. Each channel has 
10 MHz. The control channel is used for exchanging control 
messages and safety information, while service channels are 
used for delivering service information packets. 
D. Energy Model 
The proposed service model groups vehicles into clusters 
to improve the service efficiency and reduce energy 
consumption. Within a cluster we only consider one-hop 
transmission between neighboring vehicles to ensure the 
stability of connections between them. The energy model 
covers transmission in both directions, i.e., uplink and 
downlink shown in Fig. 3.  
For comparison purposes, we consider two different 
service models: one is to provide services based on clusters 
(V2X) and the other is to provide services without clusters 
(pure V2I). In our service model using cluster-based V2X, 
both V2V and V2I are used for data uploading in the uplink 
and providing services in the downlink. However, higher 
transmit power is required in the V2I mode than in the V2V 
mode as the distances between RSU and vehicles are generally 
much longer than the distances between vehicles themselves 
within a cluster. In this subsection, we will discuss the energy 
performances of the cluster-based service model in 
comparison with the non-cluster service model where services 
are delivered through V2I only.  
The RSU is up to 8-15 meters high [11] and the distance 
between a RSU and vehicles is much farther than the distance 
between vehicles themselves, thus V2I requires higher 
transmitting power than V2V to deliver data. The transmitting 
power for V2V mainly depends on the distance between CH 
and the farthest CM from CH and the maximum transmission 
distance (d*) in this case is mainly based on the number of 
vehicles in a cluster. Denoting the distance between two 
vehicles as di,j, then:

With the following definitions: Ptvi,  - the transmission 
power of the i-th transmission by a vehicle to another vehicle; 
Ptri - the transmission power of the i-th transmission by a 
vehicle to a RSU; Prv - the lowest receive power at another 
vehicle; Prr - the lowest receive power at RSU; Lpvi - the path 
loss of a transmission link between two vehicles; and Lpr - the 
path loss of a transmission link between the vehicle and the 
RSU, the minimal required transmitting power for this vehicle

uplink transmissions. Similarly, ttr is defined as the 
transmission time for each downlink transmission and Ptri is

In our proposed model, cluster head aggregates the 
collected data from each member and these data may be of 
high similarity when cluster members are in a similar 
environment but may also differ from each other because of 
the unique requirement from each vehicle. This leads to 
different transmission times spent in V2I communications, 
depending on the level of data aggregation carried out by the 
cluster head.  The similarity level of the data from different 
cluster members will affect the data size for CH to transmit to 
RSU. In addition, only the cluster head involves V2I 
communications.  
In the cluster-based model, the uplink transmitting power 
comprises of power for V2V (CMs to CH), Putv, and power for 
V2I (CH to RSU), Putr, while the downlink transmitting power 
is also divided into two parts, i.e., power for V2V (CH to 
CMs), Pdtv, and power for V2I (RSU to CH), Pdtr. The total

In uplink V2I transmissions, the transmission time will be 
reduced as result of data aggregation at the CH. For this 
reason, tutr is scaled down from the original time duration 
required for transmitting all the data collected by CH from 
CMs, which is t’utr, by applying a scaling factor Ws, such that  
 
 
tutr = t’utr Ws 
(0 ≤ Ws ≤ 1).

E. Performance Evaluation 
In this paper, the following four metrics are applied to 
evaluate the performance of the proposed system.  
• Service ratio (γ). It is the ratio of the number of 
successful delivered requests ns to the total number of 
requested services n. This is a vital metric to evaluate 
the effectiveness of the V2X system. This performance 
metric is given by:

• Average service delay (τ). It is defined as the average

evaluate the transmission efficiency of a system. It is

V. SIMULATION AND RESULTS ANALYSIS 
A. Simulation Setup 
The traffic scenarios and communications models are 
simulated using SUMO [13] and OMNET++ [14]. SUMO is 
a powerful traffic simulator and supports multiple road 
topologies and vehicle attributes. It can cooperate with other 
network simulators via its Traffic Control Interface (TraCI) 
modules. OMNET++ is an extensible, modular, and

component-based C++ simulation framework, supporting 
various types of network simulation developments.   
We built a one-way straight road with three lanes on 
SUMO, in which vehicles in each lane are running as a flow 
and the related service model is shown in Fig. 2. According to 
the Highway Code [15], the safe stopping distances are related 
to the driving speed. Considering the transmission range of 
V2V, which is usually 300 metres, the number of vehicles in 
a cluster on motorways is related to the flow speed as well.  
Based on the safe stopping distance, we define six 
scenarios in simulation for the flow speed of 32, 48, 64, 80, 
96, 112 km/h, respectively. The relationship between the 
vehicle number and flow speed is shown in Fig. 4.    
The transmission model is configured based on the IEEE 
802.11p and IEEE 1609 Family. Table I gives the parameters 
of the physical and MAC (Media Access Control) layers of the 
vehicular communication system and Table II specifies the 
transmission power in different modes (V2V and V2I), which 
are adopted in simulations.  
 
For the purpose of performance comparison, we have also 
simulated the non-cluster model, as shown in Fig. 5 where the 
same number of vehicles and vehicle velocity are set in each 
scenario. Once the vehicles enter the transmission range of the 
RSU, they communicate with RSU directly via V2I. The two 
models are evaluated over the same set of performances, 
featuring the service ratio, average service delay, throughput 
and energy consumption.

B. Results analysis 
Fig. 6 shows different service ratios (or successful rate of 
service delivery) of both Cluster-Based (CB) and Non-Cluster 
(NC) service models under 6 different scenarios and with 
different flow speeds and vehicle densities. CB achieves 
higher and more stable service ratios than NC under all 
scenarios and at both 6Mbps and 12Mbps data rates. The 
service ratio of NC also shows a raising trend with the increase 
of the flow speed. This is due to the lower vehicle density 
when the flow speed is higher, which reduces transmission 
collision and congestion.  
When the flow speed is low, the distance between vehicles 
is relatively short and more vehicles are involved within the 
same transmission range, leading to more service requests and 
local data collected for transmission. In this scenario, by 
grouping vehicles into clusters, transmission loads between 
vehicles and RSUs are reduced, hence less collision events in 
the CB model than in the NC model.  
When vehicles move out of the transmission range of RSU, 
those without support of clusters will not be able to receive 
service packets directly from RSU. But in the cluster-based 
model, CMs can still obtain services from the CH that has 
stored service data from RSU as long as they are in the 
transmission range with the CH via V2V.  
The average service delay is shown in Fig. 7, which 
includes the time spent on transmitting service data and the 
waiting time for re-transmission when the previous service 
delivery is failed. In the NC model, each vehicle has to wait 
for downloading service data from the RSU in turn. This delay 
is reduced in the CB model since only CH is involved in V2I 
transmissions.  
In addition, more time can be saved by using a cluster 
where CH transmits aggregated sensing data collected from 
CMs and broadcasts service data from RSU to the CMs that 
request the same information. The delay profile presented in 
Fig. 7 is also correlated with the service ratio results shown in 
Fig. 6.  
When the flow speed increases, there will be less collision 
or congestion cases as a fewer number of vehicles  are 
involved in transmission, thus in this scenario the CB model 
does not show as much advantages as they have at low flow 
speeds.  
In Fig. 8, it is shown that the CB model clearly outperforms 
the NC model in terms of the network throughput under all six 
different scenarios. Throughput in the CB model appears to be 
more sustainable than that in the NC model, and the gaps 
between them are data rate dependant. As we can see, the CB’s 
throughput at 6 Mbps is up to 2.3 times higher than that of the 
NC model, while when at 12 Mbps the difference is increased 
to up to 5 times. However, the throughput of the NC model 
also increases with the flow rate as less service requests are 
generated at high flow speeds or low vehicle densities.   
The average throughput of individual vehicles is shown in 
Fig. 9 versus the flow speed. Generally, the throughput of 
individual vehicles in all schemes increases with the flow 
speed. As higher flow speeds correspond to lower vehicle 
densities according to Fig. 4, lower congestion in data traffic 
and, as a result, higher throughput will be expected in this 
situation.  
In addition, it also correlates proportionally with the data 
rate as well. At low flow speeds, the CB model has a clear 
throughput advantage over the NC model because clustering 
helps to improve transmission efficiency. But the NC model 
can achieve competitively high throughput when the flow 
speed increases and with a higher data rate. 
The energy performance in terms of Joule per bit is 
demonstrated in Fig. 10 for the two service models. Vehicles 
in a cluster exchange data with a RSU via V2X, i.e., V2V 
between themselves and V2I between CH and RSU, while

when clusters are not used all transmissions rely on V2I. This 
will make a significant difference in energy consumption 
between the two service models, as shown in Fig. 10.  
 
Like the results in other performance figures, the CB 
model is considerably more energy efficient than the NC 
model, and this advantage is particularly evident in the low 
flow-speed regions. The performance gap is closing down as 
the flow speed increases.  
The energy performance can also be displayed separately 
in uplink as well as downlink, as shown in Fig. 11 where V2X 
refers to transmission mode in the clustered model while V2I 
represents transmission mode in the non-cluster model. 
Clearly, the clustered model is superior to the conventional 
non-cluster model as much lower energy cost is incurred in 
V2X than in V2I for both uplink and downlink transmissions.   
Fig. 12 shows the energy costs for both V2V and V2I 
(uplink) transmissions under varied aggregation degrees.  The 
aggregation degree value ‘0’ refers to no data aggregation at 
all as data from different vehicles are all different, and value 
‘1’ indicates that all the data from different vehicle are the 
same, so only one copy of data is needed for V2I transmission 
after aggregation. And for other values in between it means 
that data from different vehicles are similarity to some degree. 
As shown in Table II, the transmitting power for V2I is 
much greater than that in V2V. But the energy cost in terms of 
energy per bit is affected by vehicle mobility (flow speed) and              
the similarity of data from different vehicles. Given the flow 
speed of 80 km/h in Fig. 12(a), the crossing point between 
V2V and V2I is when the aggregation degree AI is fairly low 
(around 0.08). This means that V2I transmission can have a 
lower energy cost than V2V when AI is greater than 0.08.  
When the flow speed is increased to 112 km/h as shown in 
Fig. 12(b), the crossing point is moved to a higher value of 
0.23. In this case, V2I could still be more energy efficient than 
V2V if more data can be removed through aggregation, i.e., 
having a higher aggregation degree.

VI.   CONCLUSION  
In this paper, we propose a service delivery model via V2X 
in a vehicular network to improve the transmission efficiency 
and reduce energy costs. This model can effectively provide 
vehicles with real-time traffic and environmental information 
required for selecting the best routes to their destinations and 
avoiding traffic accidents or congestions.  
A combined weighting metric is introduced in this paper 
and applied to the formation of clusters. The CH is selected 
based on the mobility and connectivity of vehicles to ensure 
the stability and efficiency of data exchange and service 
delivery. An energy model is also presented in this paper to 
provide an effective analytical tool for energy performance 
characterization comprising of both uplink and downlink 
transmissions.  
As only CHs are responsible for direct communication 
with RSUs and dissemination of service data to other vehicles 
in the network, the cluster-based V2X approach presented in 
this work can significantly enhance service delivery efficiency 
and improve energy performance. This has been shown by 
simulation results, in terms of service ratio, average service 
delay, throughput and energy cost, in comparison with the 
performance of the V2I dominated non-cluster model.    
Future work will consider more complicated scenarios in 
highway settings. The data aggregation method will be 
extended to develop specific data fusion and integration 
algorithms based on the information entropy theory. In 
addition, the two-way service model and associated energy 
analysis schemes will be established and investigated for 
developing a more realistic and optimized V2X service 
delivery platform.
