Abstract— All telemetry data generated on a low earth orbit 
satellite are stored in a mass memory and downlinked to the 
ground together with the real time data during the contact 
time. The playback telemetry data are stored in the ground 
station as a playback raw data file, which includes all types of 
telemetry frames. The file should be analyzed if there is any 
error in telemetry format and frame sequences. And also, it 
needs to separate the file by each frame type, and combine or 
split the playback files by the size or by the time for the 
convenience of the post processing. The playback data analysis 
utility is developed to perform the above requirements. It can 
be used for analyzing the playback data file generated by the 
ground test equipment during the ground test phase, as well as 
the real playback data file received from the satellite. This 
paper shortly introduces the telemetry data storage and 
downlink operation in a low earth orbit satellite developed in 
Korea, and presents the playback data analysis utility program.

 INTRODUCTION 
All telemetry frames generated on the satellite are stored 
in a mass memory of the On-Board Computer (OBC) [1]. 
The mass memory data structure is showed in Figure 1, and 
it is divided into blocks that are called pages. Each memory 
module has 2048 pages and a page consists of 128 Kbytes. 
Normally, one memory module is used and the other is ready 
for the backup. If required, both memory modules can be 
used at the same time [2]. The page structure is showed in 
Figure 2. A number of 585 Virtual Channel Data Unit 
(VCDU) frames are stored on each page. The telemetry 
frame format is derived from Consultative Committee for 
Space Data Systems (CCSDS) VCDU format [3].

There are many telemetry types including several kinds 
of State of Health (SOH) frames, specified dump area frames, 
Precision Orbit Determination (POD) related frames, 
Precision Attitude Determination (PAD) related frames, and 
so on. Each telemetry frame has its own VCDU ID and 
sequence counter, and stored in the mass memory in 
chronological order without overwriting older data which has 
not yet been downlinked. The newly generated telemetry 
frames are stored on the memory location pointed out by the 
current write pointer.  
There are two downlink rates: low downlink rate 
(4096bps) and high downlink rate (1.5626Mbps). Only real 
time telemetry frames can be downlinked to the ground in 
the low downlink rate. In the high downlink rate, there are 
two downlink modes: real-time mode and playback mode. 
Only real-time telemetry frames are downlinked in the real-
time mode and real-time and playback telemetry frames 
stored in the mass memory are downlinked in the playback 
mode. 2 real-time frames in low downlink rate and 2 to 4 
real-time frames in the high downlink rate can be 
downlinked to the ground every second. A total of 762 
telemetry frames including 2 to 4 real time frames can be 
downlinked to the ground every second in the high downlink 
rate.  
Playback operation is started by ground commands. 
Several types of the playback commands are used. Upon 
receipt of the playback command, telemetry frames are 
downlinked from the last playback pointer or specified start 
address designated by the command until the current write 
pointer or specified end address designated by command is 
reached. The downlink mode is automatically switched to the

real-time mode when the playback is completed. The 
playback telemetry data are stored in the ground station as a 
playback raw data file, which includes all types of telemetry 
frames. The file should be analyzed if there is any error in 
telemetry format and frame sequences. And the summary 
information (start/end time, the total number of frame, the 
number of each frame, and so on) of the telemetries included 
in the file need to be exposed. And also, it needs to separate 
the playback file into the individual frames, and combine or 
split the playback files by the size or by the time for the 
convenience of the post processing. The playback data 
analysis utility program is developed to perform the above 
requirements. It can be used for analyzing the playback data 
file generated by the ground test equipment during the 
ground test phase, as well as the real playback data file 
received from the satellite. Section II describes the utility 
program overview. Section III describes the utility program 
details. And conclusion closes the article.

UTILITY PROGRAM OVERVIEW 
The major functions of the playback data analysis utility 
program are as follows:  
 
 
Extracts each telemetry frame from the raw data file 
and check if there is any error in the telemetry frame 
format and individual frame sequences.  
 
Reports the file information including start/end time, 
the total number of frame, the number of each frame, 
and the error information 
 
Lists the total frame sequence and the individual frame 
sequences 
 
Stores the individual raw data frames in binary or text 
format 
 
Combines two playback files and splits a playback file 
into two playback files  
 
The feature of the program is that it is possible to use 
easily on the other satellite programs by adjusting the several 
identification data fields dedicated to each satellite. And it 
can be used for analyzing the playback data file generated by 
the ground test equipment during the ground test phase, as 
well as the real playback data file received from the satellite. 
There are three types of telemetry data frame lengths in 
playback file stored in the ground station or the ground test 
equipment. The data structure of each frame length is 
described in Table 1. All types of frames can be used as the 
program input.

PROGRAM DETAILS  
A. Playback data analysis 
When the playback file to be analyzed is selected, the file 
type and frame size are checked in advance, and then each 
frame is checked if the header format coincides with the 
CCSDS telemetry frame format and each VCDU sequence 
counter is incremented orderly in accordance with each 
frame type. After extracting and checking all frames 
included in the file, it displays the check result including the 
start/end On-Board Time (OBT), the total number of frame, 
the number of each frame and error information. Total frame 
sequence and individual frame sequence can be stored as 
separated files. And individual raw data in binary or text 
format can be also stored as separated files. The storage of 
the frame sequences and raw data can be controlled by the 
user selection wholly or individually. Figure 4 shows the 
major control process of the playback data file analysis 
program. And Figure 5 shows the Graphical User Interface 
(GUI) of the program and an example of the analysis result 
of a selected playback file. Figure 6 shows an example of the 
frame sequences and raw data outputs derived from a 
playback data file.

B. Playback Files Combine 
According to the file size or start/end time of the file, it 
can be required to combine two playback files. The playback 
file combine function is used to combine two separate files 
into a file. When two files for combining are selected, the 
format and frame size of two files are checked whether they 
consist of correct format and they are same frame size, and 
they are also checked the continuity or overlapping. If two 
files are not continuous in time sequence, the warning 
message is reported. If two files have overlapping frames, 
the number of overlapping frames is calculated automatically 
and reported. According to the user selection, overlapping 
frames can be excluded when combined file is generated.  
Figure 7 shows the GUI of the playback files combine 
program and a combining example with two playback files. 
The information of two playback files before combining and 
the combined playback file is summarized in Table 2. There 
are 19 overlapping frames in two playback files and they are 
excluded in combined file.

C. Playback File Split 
According to the file size or start/end time of the file, it 
can be required to split a playback file. The playback file 
split function is used to split a file into two separate files. 
When a playback file for split is selected, basic information 
about the file such as file size, frame size, start/end time are 
displayed. And the information about two half sized files are 
displayed as default. The sizes of two files can be adjusted 
by Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) slider control. And 
more exact file size can be set by writing the number of 
frame size of the first split file. The information of two files 
to be split is displayed continuously during adjusting the file 
size.
