Abstract—Reducing energy consumption in Wireless Sensor 
Networks (WSN) is important in order to lengthen the network 
lifetime and reduce maintenance cost. Although its substantial 
contribution, the energy consumed to overhear is often omitted 
in energy calculations. However, here it is included to model the 
tradeoff between the expected number of transmissions, 
transmission range, number of hops, and overhearing, to 
discover the optimal distance between the nodes along the 
routing path. Our calculations show that to reduce energy 
consumption, the node should choose their successors close 
enough to prevent the expected number of transmissions from 
exceeding 1.4. The access protocol is Low Power Listening 
(LPL), and we also present a solution to reduce the energy 
consumption of the nodes that are crucial for maintaining an 
operational network, i.e., the nodes whose successor is the sink.

 INTRODUCTION  
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) [1] are used in a wide 
range of areas from industrial applications [2] and smart grid 
[3][4] to healthcare [5], and used in all type of environments, 
from rural to urban areas [6]. The WSNs consist of sensor 
nodes that monitor their surroundings’ characteristics and 
relay collected information to a common central, generally 
called the sink. The network has several advantages such as 
flexibility, lack of wiring, and autonomous operation.  
One of the main issues related to WSN is energy 
consumption. The nodes constituting a WSN are generally 
low-cost battery-powered devices with limited energy 
capacity. Hence, reducing energy consumption is essential in 
order to extend the individual nodes’ lifetime, and maintain a 
well-functioning network [7]. The radio is the primary energy 
consumer [8][9]. During operation, the radio switches 
between various states such as receiving, transmission, idle 
and sleep, all of which consume different amounts of energy 
[4]. To save energy, the nods should remain in the sleep state 
whenever possible. One of the most frequently cited energy-
reducing approaches is the Low-Power-Listening (LPL) 
protocol [10][11], where nodes wake up periodically to sense 
the channel. To ensure successful data exchange, the senders 
transmit a preamble message to signal upcoming data 
transmission. The duration of the preamble must be long 
enough to ensure that the intended receiver hears it. This paper 
investigates further energy-reducing measures in networks 
running LPL. 
The total energy that is consumed to transmit data from a 
source to sink depends on several factors. First, all the nodes 
use energy to send their own generated data. Second, nodes 
along the routing path consume energy to receive and forward 
data. Third, overhearing nodes consume energy when they 
receive packets, which they afterward discard. These are the 
nodes located in the proximity of the path such that they are 
covered by the transmissions intended for different 
destinations. Forth, energy is wasted when packets fail to 
reach the sink and must be retransmitted. One of the factors 
that impact the packet delivery success is the distances 
between the successive nodes along the routing path. 
Successful packet delivery is likely when the distance is well 
within the transmission range. As the distance increases, the 
probability of success reduces until it gets unlikely as the 
distance increases beyond the transmission range. Thus, to 
maintain a high probability for successful delivery, the 
distance between the nodes along the path should be shorter 
than the transmission range. However, short distance means 
that the number of hops to reach the sink increases. Each hop 
increases the number of nodes that play an active part in 
forwarding the packet, increasing energy consumption. 
Another approach is, therefore, to increase the nodes’ 
transmission range. However, such a solution requires that 
each node along the path increases the output power, 
increasing energy consumption. Thus, there is an energy-
tradeoff between packet delivery-success, transmission range, 
and hop count. This paper investigates this energy-tradeoff.  
As well as minimizing the total energy consumed, it is 
important to balance the workload in the network to avoid 
early depletion of nodes. Depleted nodes cannot provide their 
own sensed data, and, as a more serious consequence they 
may lead to network partitioning. As data in WSNs are 
generally directed toward the sink, there is an innate energy 
imbalance in WSNs. That is, nodes in the proximity of the sink 
must forward data from nodes located further away such that 
the forwarding load increases with decreasing hop-count. 
Thus, the one-hop nodes deplete energy faster since they 
undergo the heaviest forwarding load. In addition, they are the 
most critical to keep the network connected. 
To alleviate this imbalance, we suggest to reduce the one-
hop nodes energy consumption by preventing them from 
transmitting the preamble. Remember, the preamble 
transmission is used to wake up and prepare the intended 
receivers to read the upcoming data packet. However, the sink 
is always awake and ready to receive.

The contribution of this paper is to investigate the tradeoff 
between the number of re-transmissions, transmission range, 
the number of overhearing nodes, and number of hops in WSN 
to discover an energy optimal distance between the 
consecutive nodes along the path. In addition, we suggest a 
simple approach to reduce energy consumption in networks 
running LPL. The scheme is verified by simulations, and 
shows that energy consumption is substantially reduced. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
presents related works. Section 3 presents the energy model 
for one-hop transmission, while Section 4 presents the model 
for multihop transmission. The energy optimal transmission 
range is calculated in Section 5.  Section 6 presents a model to 
calculate the energy consumed for nodes at various hop-
counts, followed by an approach to reduce the one-hop nodes’ 
energy consumption in Section 7. Section 8 presents the 
conclusion.

RELATED WORK  
In order to develop energy-efficient solutions for WSN, it 
is essential to understand the energy consumption of the 
individual nodes. Modelling of the energy-consuming activity 
provides valuable insight into this aspect.  
The energy consumed is proportional to the time the nodes 
spend in the active state to transmit and receive. As the 
controller of the various radio states [12], the MAC protocol 
is important to reduce energy usage. A common MAC layer 
method to save energy is to switch to the sleep state whenever 
possible [13]. However, to keep a WSN network connected 
and operational, the nodes must periodically switch to the 
active state. During the active periods, the nodes listen for 
transmissions, and they may exchange synchronization 
information [14]. The energy consumed for such periodic 
wakeups is included in the model presented in [15], which 
calculates the energy consumption for communication, 
acquisition, and processing. The model is used to illustrate 
how energy is reduced with a reduced number of active 
periods. A solution to reduce the need for periodic listening is 
to apply always-on wakeup radios with very low power 
consumption [16]. The always-on radio activates the central 
part of the nodes only when it detects activity on the medium. 
Although an interesting solution, it will not reduce the number 
of overheard transmissions, and the solution makes the nodes 
more complex.    
Several models for energy consumption in WSN are found 
in the literature. A stochastic model that estimates the 
expected energy consumed, and the expected lifetime of WSN 
nodes, is presented in [17]. The model is based on the time the 
nodes spend in various states such as sleeping, sensing, and 
relay. The communication is based on CSMA/CA. The 
deterministic energy bounds associated with maximum and 
minimum energy consumption are presented in the paper. In 
[18], a framework for modelling MAC protocols is presented. 
The framework can be used for energy calculations that are 
based on an absorbing Markov chain analysis. An analytical 
energy model that demonstrates the impact of the various parts 
of the PHY and MAC layer, is presented in [19]. A receiver-
initiated communication protocol is used, where the receivers 
periodically wake-up and transmit a wakeup beacon to signal 
that they are ready to receive. Testbed measurements that 
isolate hardware and software consumption are performed to 
understand the energy consumption and validate the model. It 
shows a relative error of 8% compared to the real energy 
estimate. A common aspect of these models is the focus on 
MAC-related activities related to switching between different 
states.  
An energy consumption model that also includes 
overhearing is presented in [20]. The energy consumption is 
modeled both for sender- and receiver-initiated asynchronous 
MAC protocols, as well as synchronous MAC protocols for 
multimedia sensor networks. They found that the receiver- 
initiated protocols generally outperform sender-initiated 
protocols, although LPL performs well under low sampling 
rates. A weakness of the calculations is that the LPL protocol 
modeled is very conservative, since only full preamble is 
considered.   
Increased transmission range increases the senders’ 
energy consumption. In addition, both the number of 
overhearing nodes and collision probability increase. The 
overhearing nodes waste energy to receive data addressed to 
neighboring nodes, and collisions require re-transmission. A 
number of analytical models are suggested to understand the 
energy impact of the transmission range. In [21], they use 
energy models to minimize the energy consumption of the 
nodes while meeting the delay constraints. The energy model 
suggested in [22] calculates the total energy consumed per 
successfully received bit. They study the tradeoff between 
energy per successfully received bit and the energy used for 
transmission. They find a single energy-optimal transmission 
range that is validated using real data. In [23], the energy 
consumption as a function of transmission range is modeled 
and used to balance the energy consumption among the nodes 
when new versions of programs are broadcasted throughout 
the network. Energy dissipation is modeled to study the 
impact of transmission power on both the data and the ACK 
packets in [24]. They assume a TDMA based communication 
model. When the data packets are much larger than the ACK 
packets, the latter should be sent with the highest possible 
output power to improve their delivery reliability. The reason 
is that higher output power increases the packet delivery-
success probability.     
There is an energy-tradeoff between transmission range, 
the number of overhearing nodes, and the number of hops 
between source and destination. Increased transmission range 
may decrease the number of transmissions and the number of 
hops toward the sink. However, the number of overhearing 
nodes, as well as the transmission energy consumption, 
increase. The hop count is considered in [25], where the 
transmission range is adjusted to balance the energy when 
transmitting data in multi-sink networks. In [26], overhearing 
is included, and the conclusion is that the transmission range 
should be short to reduce the number of overhearing nodes 
and reduce the collisions probability. In contrast, twelve 
reasons for having a long transmission range are listed in [27]. 
One of the main reasons listed is that a longer transmission 
range makes the routing path closer to the Euclidian distance. 
However, overhearing would be a limiting factor since 
receiving consumes energy in the same order of magnitude as

transmitting in WSN. In this paper, we investigate the effect 
of reducing overhearing. In addition, we take loss probability 
and routing distance to sink into consideration.  
III. 
ENERGY MODEL FOR ONE-HOP TRANSMISSION 
In this section, the energy consumed during one-hop 
transmission is modeled. The communication protocol 
applied is LPL, which is a preamble-based protocol where 
nodes periodically wake up to listen for activity [10][11][28]. 
Between the wakeup periods, the nodes remain in sleep mode. 
A preamble message is used to inform the neighboring nodes 
to stay awake to receive the message that is about to be sent. 
Its length is defined by the nodes with the longest sleep period 
to ensure that all nodes are informed. Upon receiving a 
preamble, the node remains active, listening for the rest of the 
preamble and the upcoming message.  
Assuming that the sleeping time of the nodes is 
approximately equal, the nodes will, on average receive half 
of the preamble. For all the nodes except the intended receiver, 
this is a waste of energy. In order to reduce the energy 
consumed to receive the preamble, the preamble can be 
divided into small preamble-fractions containing the 
receiver’s address and the start-time for the data-packet 
transmission [29]. In this way, the overhearing nodes can enter 
sleep mode after receiving a preamble-fraction. In addition, 
the intended receiver is no longer required to stay awake to 
receive the whole preamble. Rather, it can receive a fraction 
and then enter sleep mode until data transmission. We call this 
method divided-preamble.  
To model the energy consumption, we assume a network 
that uses divided-preamble LPL. Figure 1 illustrates packet 
transmission for such a network. We assume that there are 
four nodes, named N1, N2, N3, and N4, which all hear each 
other’s transmissions. The red squares represent a data-packet 
that is sent from node N1 to N3. The dark blue squares 
represent the preamble, which is sent just before the associated 
data-packets. The duration of one complete preamble is p. 
Note that divided-preamble is used, thus the blue preamble 
squares are divided into fractions of length Δp. The preamble 
must be long enough to ensure that each node wakes up and 
listens for activity at least once per preamble. Otherwise, they 
may lose a preamble transmission. The light blue shaded 
squares are the time periods when the nodes are in sleep mode. 
The periodic, green squares, named LT, are the time when 
nodes listen for activity. Hence, LT must appear at least once 
per period p. The orange squares illustrate that the nodes 
received and read one of the preamble-fractions. Only the 
receiver wakes up to receive the data-packet, illustrated by the 
red square on node N3’s timeline.  
The nodes affected by one-hop transmission are the 
transmitting and receiving node, and the nodes overhearing 
the transmission. The transmission time for the packet is b. 
The power consumed for transmission consists of a fixed part, 
k1, plus an offset, k2, that is proportional to the radiated power 
[23][30]. The transmission range is d. A preamble, p, is 
transmitted prior to each data-packet, b. Thus, the energy 
consumption for transmission is (k1+k2d2)ꞏ(b+p), represented 
by the first term in our model in (1). The second term in (1) 
calculates the energy consumed by the intended receiver as it 
receives the data packet. Receiving and listening consume a 
fixed amount of power, k3. The preamble-fraction has a time 
duration Δp. It contains the receiver’s address and the start-
time for packet transmission. We assume that Δp includes 
both the preamble-fraction and the small interframe spacing 
between the fractions. The node density is λ. Thus, the number 
of nodes covered by the transmission is λꞏπd2. On the average, 
all nodes covered by the transmission receive 1.5ꞏΔp. The 
reason is that the nodes must receive a whole preamble-
fraction but they wake up at a random time. That is, it is 
equally likely that a node wakes up at any point during the 
preamble-fraction transmission. However, it must receive the 
complete preamble-fraction to be able to read its content. 
Thus, if a node wakes up after transmission of a preamble-
fraction has started, it must remain in the receiving state until 
it receives the subsequent complete preamble-fraction. The 
nodes will, therefore, on average, receive one half preamble-
fraction in addition to the complete fraction that it is able to 
read. The energy consumed is represented by the last term in 
(1). The number of overhearing nodes is calculated based on 
the node density, the transmitting node is accounted for by 
subtracting one. Thus, the energy that is consumed per one-
hop communication is:  
 
𝐸 =  (𝑘1 + 𝑘2𝑑2)(𝑏 + 𝑝) + 𝑘3𝑏 + 
1.5𝛥𝑝(𝑘3𝜋𝜆𝑑2 − 1)

IV. 
ENERGY MODEL CONSIDERING MULTIHOP 
COMMUNICATION AND LOSS PROBABILITY 
Our focus is the energy consumed during data forwarding 
from source to sink.  The goal is to investigate the impact that 
both overhearing, transmission range and re-transmission 
have on the energy optimal transmission range. Short 
transmission ranges increase the number of hops between 
source 
and 
destination, 
increasing 
the 
number 
of 
transmissions, thus also the total number of re-transmissions 
is likely to increase. Re-transmissions increase energy 
consumption. Increasing the transmission range reduces the 
number of hops. The disadvantage is the increasing 
transmission energy consumption, and the number of

 overhearing nodes increases due to a larger area covered 
by each transmission. The impact of the overhearing nodes is 
determined by how much of the transmission is being 
overheard.  
A receiver experiences increasing re-transmissions when 
it is located at the border area of the sender’s transmission 
range [31]. We use the model presented in [32] to define the 
border area. The model is used to create the graph on the left-
hand side of Figure 2, where the x-axis represents the distance 
between the sender and the receiver. The y-axis represents the 
Packet Delivery Rate (PDR). In the figure, the transmission 
range is approximately 10 m. The PDR equals 1 when the 
distance between the sender and the receiver is much shorter 
than the transmission range. However, at distances in the 
vicinity of the transmission range, there is a transient area 
where the PDR starts to change and bends towards zero. This 
is the border area. The distance between a transmitter and its 
border area increases with increasing transmission power. 
Hence, the number of re-transmissions can be reduced by 
increasing the transmission energy.  
Based on the border-area discussion above, the total 
number of re-transmissions along the path from source to sink 
depends on the nodes’ transmission range and the associated 
hop-to-hop distance, i.e., the distance between the 
transmitting node and its successor. Assuming equal 
transmission power and hop distances, the expected number 
of transmissions (ETX) along a path is [31] found to be: 
 
        𝐸𝑇𝑋[𝑁] =
1−𝑞𝑚−(1−𝑞𝑚)𝑁
𝑞𝑚(1−𝑞)
 
 
     (2) 
 
N is the number of nodes along the path, which is equal to 
the distance to the sink, D, divided by transmission range, d. 
The factor m denotes the maximum number of transmission 
trials, i.e., the maximum number of re-transmissions is (m-1). 
The parameter named q, denotes the packet loss rate. q = 1- 
PDR, and PDR(x) is given by [32]: 
 
                       𝑃𝐷𝑅(𝑥) =
1
1+𝑒
𝑥−𝑥0
𝑥1
                                 (3) 
 
x is the distance between the transmitting node and its 
successor, and x1 defines the width of the border area. x0 is in 
the middle of the border area, i.e., x0 is the knee value as 
shown in Figure 2. The expected number of transmissions 
along a path, ETX[N], depends on the packet loss rate q. The 
energy consumed for transmitting a packet from source to sink 
can be found by introducing ETX[N] in (1):  
 
𝐸 = 𝐸𝑇𝑋[𝑁][ (𝑘1 + 𝑘2𝑑2)(𝑏 + 𝑝) + 𝑘3𝑏 +
                          1.5𝛥𝑝(𝑘3𝜋𝜆𝑑2 − 1)]  
 
      (4) 
 
 Equation (4) shows that ETX[N] has an important impact 
on energy consumption. ETX[N] increases both with the 
number of hops along the path toward the sink, and when the 
distance between sender and successor nodes approaches and 
enters the border area. The distance to x0 can be increased by 
increasing the transmission power, thus the tradeoff between 
hop-count, packet delivery rate (here represented by ETX), 
overhearing, and transmission range. The tradeoff is 
investigated in the next section. 
V. 
ENERGY OPTIMAL TRANSMISSION 
We use (4) to investigate the tradeoff between hop-count, 
packet delivery rate, overhearing, and transmission range. It is 
assumed to be an equal distance between the sender and the 
receiver for each hop along the path from the source node to 
the sink. The right-hand side of Figure 2 illustrates the sender-
receiver distance for one of these individual hops along the 
path. The blue node represents one sender, and the blue circle 
represents the associated knee-point value, x0, for the sender’s 
transmission range. The red dot represents a receiver at a 
distance to the sender, its distance is outside the knee-point 
value. In order to model this sender-receiver distance, we 
choose to represent it as the knee-point value times a constant. 
The constant is named Successor Distance factor (SD), i.e., x 
= x0ꞏSD. Hence, the red node has SD higher than 1. A node 
located on the blue circle will have SD = 1 and a node located 
inside the blue circle would have a SD lower than 1.  
The parameter values used in the calculations are the 
values presented in [30]. The values are based on the 
CC1000_radio [33]. For CC1000, k3 and k2 are in the same 
order of magnitude while k2 is much lower than k3. Other 
radios may have different numerical values. However, the 
  
Figure 2. The left-hand side of the figure shows the PDR for increasing 
distance between sender and receiver. The small blue circle in the center 
of the right-hand side figure illustrates a transmitting node, and the blue 
outer circle is the knee-point boarder line for the transmission.

characteristics are similar among WSN nodes [8][23]. Hence, 
our calculations present a general trend.   The values for k1, k2 
and k3 are 36.1µJ/bit, 0.06 pJ/bit/m2 and 37.5 µJ/bit 
respectively. The preamble-time, p, is normalized with respect 
to data-packet time, b. The transmission range d = 10m and 
the node density λ = 0.015. The preamble-length is 5ꞏdata-
packet length. The distance to the sink is set to D = 50m and 
the maximum number of re-transmissions is m = 20.  
In the calculations, the successor node is located at x =  
x0ꞏSD. Thus, the number of nodes along a path is N = round-
up-upward(D/x). 
Calculating 
energy 
consumed 
the 
overhearing nodes is challenging. The reason is that some are 
located inside x0, but do not receive the preamble or are not 
able to correctly decode the preamble. The same apply for 
some of the nodes that are located in the border area beyond 
x0. As an average, assume that all nodes inside x0 receive the 
preamble.  
Figure 3 shows the energy consumption changes as 
transmission range increases. The y-axis represents the energy 
consumption and the x-axis represents the transmission range 
knee value, x0. That is, moving toward higher x-axis values, 
the transmission power increases, and thus the transmission 
range. ETXper-hop changes with transmission range and is 
calculated using equations presented in [32], see reference for 
explanation: ETX(m) = (1-qm)/(1-q). The figure shows three 
different graphs representing three different SD parameters. 
For the blue graph SD = 0.5 (ETXper-hop = 1.19), for the 
orange graph the SD = 0.75 (ETXper-hop = 1.43) and for the 
yellow graph SD = 1.25 (ETXper-hop = 3.3).   
First, we concentrate on the impact of SD distance. The 
smallest SD, the blue graph, generally gives the highest 
consumption. The reason is that low SD gives short hop-to-
hop distances such that the number of hops from source to sink 
is high. Remember, each hop adds at least one packet 
transmission, causing energy to increase due to transmission, 
receiving, and overhearing. When SD increases, the hop-
count decreases, reducing the energy consumed. However, as 
the SD is further increased, the increase in ETX[N] cancels 
the positive effect of the reduced number of hops, because the 
successor is too far into the border area.  The energy 
consumption for SD = 1.25 is generally higher than for SD = 
0.75 although the hop-count for SD = 1.25 is the lowest due 
to the long sender-to-receiver distance. Performing the 
calculations with various SD shows that energy consumption 
is lowest when SD is about 0.75 (ETXper-hop = 1.4). That is, 
the successor nodes should be chosen so far into the border 
area that the ETXper-hop = 1.4. The result is comparable to 
the discussions and findings in [10], where energy 
minimization for LPL in noisy environments is investigated. 
It is found that noise-triggered false wakeups can be a 
dominant energy consumption factor. In our case, overhearing 
causes unnecessary wakeups, which does not provide any 
valuable information, thus it should be limited.      
Furthermore, Figure 3 shows that there exists an energy 
optimal transmission range. It is mainly determined by the 
overhearing nodes’ energy consumption. The optimal 
transmission range is more pronounced and shorter as Δp 
(fraction of preamble received by neighboring nodes) 
increases. The graph to the right in Figure 3 has the highest 
Δp and the shortest and most pronounced optimal 
transmission range. The reason is that increased Δp causes 
increased energy consumption among overhearing nodes, 
because they receive a larger fraction of the transmitted 
preamble. Combined with the fact that the number of 
overhearing nodes increases quadratic with distance, the 
energy optimal transmission range is reduced to reduce the 
impact of overhearing. When Δp is low, the optimal 
transmission range is less pronounced and longer because the 
impact of overhearing is much lower. The optimal 
transmission range is about 10m for λ = 0.015. Thus, the 
average number of nodes covered by the transmission is 4.71, 
which may be too few to keep the network connected [34]. 
The conclusion is that it is energy efficient to keep the 
transmission range short, considering that the range is long 
enough to keep the network connected. Other parameter 
values would give other results. For instance, there is no 
pronounced energy optimal transmission range if Δp is 
reduced to below 0.02 while the other parameters are kept 
unchanged. Reducing the preamble, p, to data-packet size has 
the same effect of making the optimum-point less pronounced. 
On the contrary, increasing the node density makes it more 
pronounced. However, the energy optimal distance, between 
a node and its successor, is the distance where ETXper-hop is 
1.4. This applies for all the various parameter settings. 
Deciding a distance that gives ETXper-hop = 1.4 is not 
realistic in real-world scenarios since environmental 
characteristics are prone both to temporal and spatial changes. 
In addition, the parameter settings both for the radio as well as 
other parameters such as packet size would vary, resulting in 
a slightly different optimal ETXper-hop. However, our result 
shows a valid trend, the optimal distance between successor 
nodes should not be too far into the border area, i.e., the area 
where the PDR starts to change and bends towards zero.  
We observe a sawtooth shape of the curves in Figure 3. 
The reason for this shape is that the number of overhearing 
nodes increases, initially, with increasing transmission range, 
as seen in the smooth increasing energy consumption. The 
abrupt drop occurs as the path decreases by one link. The 
reduced number of hops gives a sharp reduction in 
overhearing energy consumption since the number of

side of the figure shows the energy consumed when the preamble-fraction 
that overhearing nodes receive is 0.1 times the complete preamble. The

transmissions is reduced. The deepest sawtooth decrease in 
energy consumption occurs for the longest transmission 
ranges. The reason is that the longest transmission range 
covers the highest number of overhearing nodes.          
VI. 
ENERGY BALANCE IN WSN 
Although LPL is an efficient method to reduce the energy 
consumption in WSN, there is an energy imbalance in energy 
consumption among the nodes. The energy consumption due 
to forwarding increases towards the sink. The reason is that 
nodes closer to the sink must forward packets from nodes 
further away from the sink. The consequence is that the one-
hop nodes experience the highest energy-cost due to their 
packet forwarding.  
To investigate energy consumption versus hop-count, we 
assume a fair workload balance between the nodes. Fair 
means equal load-balanced among the nodes at a given hop-
count. Assume that the nodes' transmission range is d and h 
represent the hop-count distance to the sink. The number of 
nodes located (h+1) hops from the sink is equal to the number 
of nodes inside the donut-shaped area with an outer radius of 
dꞏ(h+1) and an inner radius of dꞏh. The number of nodes in 
the donut-shaped-area is found by multiplying its area with the 
node density, λ: 
 
𝑛ℎ+1 = 𝜋𝜆 [((ℎ + 1) ∗ 𝑑)
2 − (ℎ𝑑)2] = 𝜋𝜆(2ℎ + 1)𝑑2  (5) 
 
The number of nodes located h+2 hop from the sink is: 
 
𝑛ℎ+2 = 𝜋𝜆 [((ℎ + 2)𝑑)
2 − ((ℎ + 1)𝑑)
2] 
                          = 𝜋𝜆(2ℎ + 3)𝑑2  
 
     (6) 
 
Nodes at hop-count h forwards data on behalf of a given 
number of nodes at hop-count h+1. The average number of 
nodes use a given node at hop-count h is:  
 
                                  
𝑛ℎ+2
𝑛ℎ+1 =
2ℎ+3
2ℎ+1  
 
 
     (7) 
 
A node at hop-count h transmits one of its packets, in 
addition, it transmits (nh+1)/(nh) packets from its one-hop 
predecessors. The total number of transmissions for a node at 
hop-count nh is, therefore: 
 
                       𝑇𝑥𝑛ℎ = 1 +
𝑛ℎ+2
𝑛ℎ+1 ꞏ𝑇𝑥𝑛(ℎ+1) 
 
     (8) 
 
Based on (8), we find the energy consumed for nodes at a 
given hop-count is presented in (9). The first term in (9) 
represents the transmission energy. The second term 
represents the energy used to receive packets for forwarding, 
remember, the preamble is received for each received data-
packet. Besides, the nodes overhear neighbors’ transmissions. 
Some of the overheard neighbors are located at the same hop-
count distances from the sink as the overhearing node, while 
some are located at adjacent hop-count distances. Assuming 
that the contribution from all these three hop-count distances 
is equal, the number of transmissions overheard is as 
expressed in the first parenthesis of the last term in (9). 
However, each packet is received twice for nearby neighbors: 
once when the neighbor receives it, once when the neighbor 
transmits it. Other neighbors’ packets are overheard only 
once: when the neighbor transmits it. As a first approximation, 
we assume that half of each overheard packet is received 
twice, hence, the 1.5-factor in front of the parenthesis in (9). 
Thus, to investigate the energy imbalance, the energy 
consumed for a node at hop-count x can be calculated as: 
 
 𝐸 = 𝑇𝑥𝑛ℎ[ (𝑘1 + 𝑘2𝑑2)(𝑏 + 𝑝)] + 𝑘3(𝑇𝑥𝑛ℎ − 1) ∙ 
         (𝑏 + 1.5𝛥𝑝) + 1.5(
𝑇𝑥𝑛𝑥−1+𝑇𝑥𝑛𝑥+𝑇𝑥𝑛𝑥+1
3
)(𝑘31.5𝛥𝑝)   (9) 
 
VII. BALANCING ENERGY CONSUMPTION 
Although LPL is an efficient energy reduction method in 
WSN, the energy imbalance persists among the nodes. Caused 
by the forwarding load discussed above, the one-hop nodes 
consume much more energy than the other nodes. However, 
messages sent from the one-hop nodes are destined to the sink, 
which is always active. Therefore, in order to save energy, we 
suggest canceling the preamble from the one-hop nodes. The 
nodes are aware of their identity as one-hop nodes by looking 
in the routing table: their successor nodes are the sink, and 
their distance to the sink is one hop.   
Simulations are performed to compare when all nodes 
apply the same divided-preamble LPL algorithm against the 
case when the one-hop nodes are prevented from transmitting 
the preamble. The parameter investigated is total energy 
consumption. The simulation is performed in Omnet++ [35].   
The applied routing metric is hop-count, and each node 
generates 100 data packets during each simulation. The 
preamble time is four times the duration of a data packet. The 
preamble-fraction packets are one-tenth of the data-packet 
size. We have used a fixed number for receiving power 
consumption. The transmission power consumption is also 
fixed since the transmission range is equal for all nodes. 
Energy consumed for overhearing is not considered because 
the number of overhearing packets would be equal for both 
scenarios: The number of packets transmitted is equal for 
approaches, and, although the one-hop nodes do not transmit 
preamble, neighbors must receive and read all overheard 
packets in order to decide whether the packet is destined for 
them.   205 nodes are randomly distributed in an area of 1000 
m times 1000 m. The transmission range of all nodes is 141 
m.  
The simulation results are shown on the left-hand side of 
Figure 4. Every simulation point presented in the graphs 
represents the average value of 100 simulation runs with 
different seeds for random deployment of nodes. The red 
curve shows the simulation result when the one-hop nodes are 
prevented from transmitting preamble, while the blue curve 
shows the energy consumed when the one-hop nodes behave 
equal to the other nodes, i.e., transmit preamble. The 
continuous curves represent average values, and the marks 
over and below represent the 95% confidence interval.

The simulations show that one-hop nodes’ energy 
consumption is reduced by about 50% when the one-hop 
nodes are prevented from transmitting the preamble. 
Calculations using (9) verify the simulated result, as shown on 
the figure’s right-hand side. To what extent the energy is 
reduced depends on various factors, the main being the ratio 
of preamble size to data-packet size. Less energy is saved 
when the preamble is shorter. For instance, the energy saving 
is reduced to 19% if the preamble to data-packet-size is 
reduced to 0.5. Avoiding preamble transmission would reduce 
one-hop nodes’ energy consumption, which are the most 
critical nodes to keep the network connected. Preventing 
transmission of the preamble is equal to reducing the duty-
cycle of the nodes, and our result complies with the results in 
[36], where duty cycling is used to manage the delay as well 
as energy consumption of the nodes. The duty-cycle of the 
hot-spot nodes, which equals to the one-hop nodes, is kept low 
compared to the duty-cycle of nodes in non-hotspots areas.   
VIII.  CONCLUSION 
To reduce the energy consumed in multihop transmission 
in WSN the tradeoff between number of re-transmissions, 
overhearing, number of hops, and transmission range are 
investigated. Due to improved packet delivery rate (PDR), 
less energy is wasted on re-transmissions when the distance 
between senders and receivers along the routing paths is 
reduced. However, the number of hops to reach the sink is 
increased such that more nodes must use energy to forward 
the data. Another solution is to increase the nodes’ output 
power to increase the distance to where the PDR starts to fail. 
In this way, the distance between senders and receivers can 
increase 
without 
introducing 
more 
re-transmissions. 
However, each transmission consumes more energy. In 
addition, the overhearing nodes must be considered. Their 
contribution to energy consumption increases with the number 
of nodes covered by the transmissions, number of 
transmissions, and the size of the received packet. 
Investigating the tradeoff between all mentioned factors, we 
find that the optimal solution is for the nodes to choose their 
successors at a distance that gives an expected number of 
transmissions, ETXper-hop, of approximately 1.4. In addition, 
we suggest and show that energy is efficiently reduced if 
nodes whose successor is the sink, are prevented form 
transmitting preamble. The preamble can be omitted since the 
sink is always awake and ready to receive. Reducing these 
nodes energy consumption is crucial in order to avoid network 
partitioning.  
Future work on energy consumption in WSN will focus on 
more intelligent forwarding. Nodes will predict the traffic 
patterns to optimize their own duty-cycle and prevent 
overhearing.
