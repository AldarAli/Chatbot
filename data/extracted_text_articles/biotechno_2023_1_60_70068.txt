Abstract— Jellyfish bloom implies an economic issue directly 
affecting tourism, fishing, aquaculture, and oil plants. 
Although many methods have been used to repel jellyfish 
arrivals to our coasts, such as nets or water currents, none 
seems to be a permanent solution. In this paper, we test the 
effect of applying a medium-frequency Electromagnetic (EM) 
field on jellyfish behaviour, specifically, their movement. A coil 
inside a jellyfish aquarium is used to generate the EM field. A 
current generator powers the coil. As an indicator of jellyfish 
movement, jellyfish pulsations are counted in the presence or 
absence of the EM field. Selected jellyfish species (Catostylus 
mosaicus) present two types of colouration, blue and brown. 
According to the results, blue jellyfish showed different 
behaviour than brown jellyfish. Blue jellyfish have about 50 
pulses without an EM field, decreasing slightly in the presence 
of an EM field. On the other hand, brown jellyfish pulses about 
40 times without an EM field, dropping to values below 20 
when the EM field is applied. As suggested by the obtained 
data, we can propose different systems to prevent jellyfish 
from getting close to the shore, based on the use of coils to 
generate EM fields and bottom water current.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
The growing bloom of jellyfish in some areas and other 
gelatinous organisms can provoke multiple economic 
problems [1]. Moreover, some jellyfish stings can be cause 
injuries and even deaths [2]. Regarding the economic 
impact, we must highlight that the impact of jellyfish 
blooms in tourist destinations, which could reduce the 
number of visitors due to the fear of jellyfish stings.Jellyfish 
also generate problems in other sectors such as fishing, 
where they clog the nets; aquaculture, in which jellyfish can 
kill fry; and desalination and refrigeration of different 
industries (power and oil plants), where they obstruct the 
pipes [3]. Overfishing, water eutrophication, modification of 
coastal areas and habitats, and climate change are some 
factors to which these increasing blooms of jellyfish are 
attributed [4]. 
Different systems are currently being developed and 
used to avoid the interaction between humans and jellyfish. 
These systems consist of meshes, nets or water currents that 
prevent the passage of jellyfish to the shore. Nevertheless, 
these methods are costly, and data obtained in different tests 
do not confirm their effectiveness [5]. It has been shown 
that with a 25 mm mesh, the presence of jellyfish is 
significantly reduced. The number of jellyfish would be 
further reduced with a smaller mesh. Nonetheless, it would 
increase the number of detachments of the seabed 
vegetation, the entanglement of the fauna in the area, and 
the accumulation of rafts of marine debris. 
The effectiveness of these methods might depend on the 
area in which they are deployed. They were proven as a 
successful system for preventing jellyfish in areas where the 
energy of the waves, wind, and tides was low. In areas with 
higher hydrodynamic conditions, modifications should be 
made to increase the success rate, which leads to a higher 
cost [6]. Considering the normal hydrodynamic conditions 
on our shores, the shallow water current pushes the jellyfish 
to the shores. If the motion of jellyfish can be altered, the 
bottom water currents will return the jellyfish offshore.  
Electromagnetic (EM) fields have been used for 
behaviour change experimentation in animals and plants. In 
the case of animals, low-frequency EM fields have come to 
modify the behaviour. On the one hand, EM fields were 
used to see if they affected the orientation of birds, 
concluding that individuals exposed to EM waves tended to 
become disoriented [7]. On the other hand, the EM fields 
were used with seeds of two plant species. The selected 
species were Rhododendron smirnowii and Morus nigra . In 
the case of the first species, seed germination increased by 
up to 70%. However, in the case of the second species, the 
germination percentage decreased by 24%. Therefore, 
according to these two examples, it can be seen that EM 
fields can affect the behaviour of living beings. 
The aim of the paper is to verify if medium-frequency 
EM fields can alter the behaviour of jellyfish, particularly 
their motion (pulsation rate), to explore possible solutions to 
the problems they generate on the shore. These EM fields 
are expected to modify the motion of Catostylus mosaicus, a 
common jellyfish in Australia. The EM waves are expected 
to reduce their pulse rate and remain motionless on the 
bottom, avoiding advection by currents. The conducted tests

consist of exposing the jellyfish to an EM field generated 
with a coil. The exposure time to the EM field was set at 
five minutes. The pulse rate is used as an indicator of the 
jellyfish's motion. Twelve individuals of C. mosaicus were 
selected. Half of the jellyfish were bluish, while the other 
half was brown. It should be added that the size of the 
selected individuals was between 2.78 and 4.63 cm. 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows; Section 2 
outlines the related work. Section 3 details the test bench. 
The results are discussed in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 
summarises the conclusion and future work. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
In this section, we will summarise the current proposals 
for jellyfish barriers and the existing studies about the use of 
EM fields on animals.  
A. 
Jellyfish barriers 
In [6] Vasslides et al. test the efficiency of anti-jellyfish 
barriers. Their results indicate that the captured bay nettles in 
the area where the any-jellyfish barrier net was installed 
decreased by 28 to 67 %. In addition, the jellyfish captured 
in the area protected by the net was significantly smaller than 
in the adjacent areas. Nevertheless, this type of barrier's 
impact on fauna and flora and its relatively low effectiveness 
precludes its general use. The successfulness of air bubbles 
curtains in preventing the passing of jellyfish into 
aquacultural facilities was tested in 2021 by Haberlin et al. 
[9]. Their results were not entirely satisfactory. While high 
airflow reduces the number of jellyfish, low airflow does not 
affect the amount of jellyfish that passes the curtain. 
Moreover, the hydrodynamics link to waves increases the 
number of jellyfish that passes through the curtain.  
In a recent survey, N. Killi et al. [10] concluded that early 
warning systems and barriers are being used in some regions 
of Spain and France. These barriers are designed for Pelagia 
noctiluca blooms. Another survey by T. A. Morsy et al. [11] 
indicates that both stinger nets and stinger suits have a 
limited impact on jellyfish avoidance. While barriers do not 
affect tiny jellyfish, the suits' performance has not been 
demonstrated in trials.  
B. EM field effects on animals 
In this subsection, we detail the existing reported effects 
of EM fields on animals. Several papers have been published 
in which the effect of EM fields on different animals is 
evaluated. There is an increasing tendency for this sort of 
study in marine animals due to the high number of high-
power cables placed in the oceans. Although much literature 
can be found on this topic, few papers presented a proper 
comparison of animals' mobility of performance when 
exposed to the EM fields.  
In 2020 Z. L. Hutchison et al. evaluated the behaviour of 
Leucoraja erinacea and Homarus americanus (little skate 
and American lobster) when exposed to anthropogenic EM 
fields [12]. The selected EM field was the emissions of 
subsea high voltage cables for domestic electricity supply 
with a high voltage direct current. They analyse the impact 
of the EM field on animal mobility. The indicators used were 
the total distance travelled, the mean speed, and the 
proportion of significant turns, among others. All factors 
were affected by the EM field being considered a difference 
statistically significant for little skate. The EM field did not 
affect the lobster's total travelled distance and speed of 
movement. Similar tests were conducted with european 
lobster (Homarmus Gammarus) by R. Taormina et al. in the 
same year [13]. In these tests, the authors exposed juvenile 
individuals to magnetic fields generated by AC/DC 
submarine power cables. The mobility indicators used were 
the activity ratio, the mean velocity, and the distance 
travelled. Their results indicate that no differences in 
European lobster mobility were detected.  
The impact of EM fields on fish was studied by D. P. Fey 
et al. in 2019 [14]. The authors exposed the eggs of rainbow 
trout to an EM field for 36 days. Their objective was to 
detect if the EM field might affect fish development in the 
early stage. The measured parameters included time to 
hatching, mortality, and growth rate, among others. Their 
results indicated no variation between the control and 
exposed fish. Even there are few differences. Those 
differences were not statistically significant. The effect of the 
EM field in simple animals, such as on placozoa, a basal 
form of a marine multicellular organism, was evaluated in 
2020 by A. V. Kuznetsov1 et al. [15]. They used a square 
pulse with shallow frequency. As a mobility indicator, the 
fraction of immobilised individuals of Trichoplax sp. was 
considered. Results indicate that the higher the voltage, the 
greater the number of immobilised individuals. The 
exposition time also impacts the number of immobilised 
individuals greater after 1000 ms than after 1 ms.  
Numerous surveys have been published in recent years 
with mixed results. The main conclusion is that no apparent 
EM field effect has been demonstrated on marine animals. 
The main problem of existing research is the differences 
among studied EM fields and animals. In [12] and [13], 
scientists used anthropogenic EM fields generated by high-
voltage cables with frequencies that range from 1 Hz to 2.5 
kHz [12]. There is no information about the frequency in 
[13]. Meanwhile, in [15], a specific EM field was generated 
for the experiment with an Arduino Uno microprocessor that 
generates rectangular pulses with a frequency below 2 
kHz.As far as we know, no publication has been found in 
which the effect of EM fields on jellyfish is studied. 
III. 
TEST BENCH 
In this section, the complete test bench is detailed. 
Firstly, the type of coil used and the current generator have 
been described to quantify each jellyfish pulsation. Next, the 
jellyfish used in the tests are described. Later, the followed 
methodology in the conduct tests is explained. Finally, the 
used indicator, the pulse rate, is defined. 
A. 
EM field characterisation 
To generate the EM field, a coil is used. According to 
Ampere Law, Eq. (1), it is possible to estimate the generated 
EM field. The magnetic flux density (B) inside a coil is 
proportional to the magnetic permeability of the water (µ0), 
and the characteristics of the coil, including the number of

spires (N) and the length of the coil (l), and current (IC). In 
our scenario, de magnetic flux density in the centre of the 
coil is 10.3 mT. 
B = µ0 IC N/l  
                   (1) 
 
B. 
Equipment 
In order to keep the specimen during the tests, we used a 
cubic tank. The aquarium was filled with 18 L of seawater, 
with an average temperature of 21.6 ± 1.1 ºC and 31.8 ± 0.42 
ppm of salinity, from the aquarium where the jellyfish were 
maintained; see Figure 1.  
As explained before, the coil will be powered with a 
current generator AFG1022 from Tektronix [16]. The 
electronic circuit to power the coil includes a resistance of 
100 KΩ with a 5% tolerance on the positive side of the 
copper coil. The generated signal to power the coil was a 
sinus signal of 3.3 Vpp.  
C. 
Jellyfish description 
In order to perform our tests, we selected a total of 12 
specimens of jellyfish provided by Oceanogràfic de 
Valencia. All the individuals belong to C. mosaicus and have 
a similar age. In this case, even though they were all the 
same species, they presented two types of colouration (blue 
or brown). We balanced the number of brown and blue 
specimens among the selected individuals. Their size, 
measured using a calliper, varies between 2 cm and 5 cm, the 
smallest 2,66 cm and the largest 4,87 cm, as shown in Table 
1. 
D. 
Conducted test 
The methodology followed for this experiment can be 
separated into two stages. In all the tests, the coil is placed in 
the aquarium. The first one, where the EM field was not 
activated, also known as the blank test, serves to have 
information about the regular motion of jellyfish. In the 
second test, also known as the exposition test, the EM field 
was activated by powering the coil with the generator. This 
simulates the exposition of the proposed system. Each stage 
consisted of a 5 minutes lapse in which the behaviour was 
recorded every minute.

E. 
Behaviour’s indicator 
The pulse rate corresponds to the number of complete 
pulses performed by the jellyfish every 30 seconds. The 
pulses were counted during blank and exposition tests. The 
pulse rate has been selected as an indicator to characterise 
the jellyfish’s behaviour.  
Measurements were taken in slots of time of 30 seconds 
along the 5 minutes of trials. The first data collection started 
30 seconds after the beginning of the experiment, and the last 
one was at 4 minutes and 30 seconds. 
IV. 
RESULTS 
In this section, we describe the obtained results from the 
conducted tests. First, the results of the descriptive statistics 
are shown. The comparison of jellyfish behaviour when they 
are exposed or not to the EM fields is detailed later. Finally, 
the evaluation of the suitability of this system to prevent 
jellyfish on our shores is discussed. 
A. 
Descriptive statistics of obtained results 
Next, we describe the variability of data gathered during 
the different experiments. First of all, five histograms are 
included in Figure 2, in which we can see the distribution of 
pulses. During the data collection in the tests, we noted that 
the blue jellyfish behave differently than the brown ones. 
Thus, besides the histograms for the EM field and no EM 
field, the data is also divided according to the colour of the 
jellyfish. In addition, the descriptive analyses of this data are 
summarised in Table 2. 
In Figure 2 a), we can see the histogram for all collected 
data; it is possible to identify that the variable does not 
follow a normal distribution (kurtosis and skewness in Table 
2). In most cases, jellyfish pulse rate are close to 50 pulses 
every 30 seconds. Nonetheless, we can see differences when 
differentiating between colours, especially when jellyfish are 
exposed to the EM field. The blue jellyfish have, in most 
cases, values close to 50 pulses every 30 seconds, see Figure 
2 b). When they are exposed, the histogram shows a decrease 
in the number of pulses, see Figure 2 c). Concerning the 
brown individuals (Figure 2 d)), even when they are not 
exposed to the EM field, they have a lower pulse rate, with 
the maximum of the histogram in 40. Finally, when brown 
individuals are exposed to the EM field, they decrease the 
27

number of pulses even more. It is possible to find pulse rate 
values below 20, see Figure 2 e).  
When data is analysed independently according to the 
jellyfish colour and EM field exposition, in some cases, the 
pulse rate follows a normal distribution. This happens with 
data on brown jellyfish. 
The main conclusion of the descriptive analyses is that if 
all data is going to be analysed, non-parametric methods 
must be used. In addition, de descriptive analyses have 
already shown that there are differences between individuals 
when they are exposed to the EM field. These differences are 
more evident for brown jellyfish than for blue ones. 
B. 
Comparison of jellyfish behaviour when they are 
exposed to EM field 
Now, the comparison of results among tested individuals 
when they are exposed to EM fields is presented. Figure 3 
and Figure 4 depict the registered motion of jellyfish under 
the blank and exposition test. The X-axis includes the 
number of individuals and the type of exposition (Yes or 
Not). It is possible to see that the pulsation rate along the test 
is similar for the blue individuals, with very few differences 
between individuals and in exposition. For the brown 
individuals, higher variability in data is seen. It is possible to 
see in Figure 5 that when individuals are under EM, the 
pulses decrease considerably.  
In order to evaluate if differences are statistically 
significant, we used a Kruskall-Wallis non-parametric test 
since parameter did not follow a normal distribution. Table 2 
summarises the results of the different tests. First, we 
compared the data of all individuals using the presence of the 
EM field as a factor. The results indicate that differences 
were not statistically significant (p-value of 0.098). The case 
in which differences in motion due to the presence of EM 
field were statistically significant was for the brown 
individuals, with a p-value of 0.02.

Impact and limitations 
Our results indicate that using an EM field only for 5 
minutes can alter the mobility of brown jellyfish. During the 
test, the jellyfishes that stopped pulsing were in the bottom 
of the aquarium. Regarding the blue individuals, even though 
the pulse rate was not altered, they experienced moments 
when they stopped pulsing and went to the bottom, as can be 
seen in Figure 5. After each period in which the jellyfish 
stopped pulsing when the jellyfish start pulsing the pulse was 
faster than before. This explains why in some individuals, 
even if they remain for some seconds without pulsing, the 
pulse rate does not vary. Nevertheless, in those situations, the 
velocity of the jellyfish was almost null. Although an 
exhaustive study of the jellyfish's behaviour has not been 
carried out after its exposure to the EM field, it is possible to 
see a partial recovery in their ability to pulsate. 
 
 
Figure 5.  Picture of jellyfish in the bottom of the aquarium due to the EM. 
Before applying this solution to real environments, some 
adjustments must be made. The system can be extended by 
adding a method to detect the jellyfish for activating the EM 
field. It is not expected any problem between affected and 
non-affected jellyfish since, as far as we know, no 
communication has been described among jellyfish. 
Moreover, during the performed test, it was not detected that 
the jellyfish avoided contact with the coil that generated the 
EM field.  
The most challenging issues of this system are the 
powering and the structural aspects. In addition, it will be 
necessary to study the potential effect of generated EM fields 
on other organisms. The full system is expected to be 
developed and tested in the next year thanks to the 
collaboration of partners of the SALVADOR project. 
 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
The arrival of jellyfish blooms to the coast significantly 
affects areas in which the economy relies on tourism. 
Existing any-jellyfish barriers, mainly based on nets or air 
bubbles, are not fulfilling the expectations. Some public 
agencies are demanding adequate jellyfish management 
strategies [19]. 
In this paper, we presented a new any-jellyfish system 
based on the generation of EM fields that modify jellyfish's 
motion. The impact of EM on mobility was tested with 12 
individuals of Catostylus mosaicus. A copper coil and an 
alternating current generator generated the EM field. The 
results show that EM fields alter the mobility of half of the 
tested individuals according to the registered pulse rate. 
Initial results pointed out that using the EM field has clear 
potential as an alternative option for an anti-jellyfish barrier. 
The impact of these EM fields in other species of 
jellyfish as well as in other local fauna, must be tested in 
future work. Additional tests will include changing the signal 
used to power the copper coil to evaluate the effect of 
different generated EM fields. It would be interesting to 
study the behaviour in adult specimens by using the same 
parameters in this study in order to compare behaviours with

younger individuals. Furthermore, since it is intended to 
modify the used signal, it can be tested in adult jellyfish. 
Another possible work for the future would be to change the 
size and type of coil, using a larger one or changing the 
number of spires to generate an EM field with higher 
magnetic flux density.
