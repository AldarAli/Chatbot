Abstract—Node Compromise Detection (NCD) is an essential
requirement for dealing with potential attacks in randomly
deployed, unattended and not tamper resistant wireless sensor
networks applications. Behaviour based concepts, such as false
information communication by a compromised node (ZoneTrust),
are reported in literature. In our work, more effective parame-
ters, namely, packet sending rate, depletion of node energy, node
location, and node non-availability are identiﬁed for NCD. All
these parameters are used to detect a compromised node either
conjunctively (AND model) or disjunctively (OR model). The
OR model is suitable for military surveillance; and the AND
model is suitable for weather monitoring applications. The OR
model incurs a lot of overhead whereas the AND model suffers
from high risk of attack. To alleviate these demerits Parameter
Grouping (PG) concept is proposed to retain the merits of both
AND and OR models. An extensive NS-2 based simulation work
was carried out and found that the proposed NodeTrust-based
PG improves the system performance substantially.

I. INTRODUCTION
A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) consists of a large
number of sensor nodes, which perform sensing, processing
and communication. There are different types of WSN ap-
plications, i.e., smart home security, battleﬁeld surveillance,
civil structure condition monitoring, crop pest control, etc.
The sensor nodes have constrained resources such as limited
battery energy, low computing power and low memory.
An attacker can easily capture the sensor nodes and com-
promise them due to the vulnerabilities of the sensor networks,
i.e., unattended nature, low computing power (incapability to
run software-based security concepts), lack of tamper-resistant
hardware and unreliable communication, etc.
The node compromisation is a serious security threat to all
WSN applications, because when a node is compromised, an
attacker can launch a variety of attacks and inject malicious
code. A compromised node is a trusted node (benign node) that
has been taken control over by an attacker [8]. An attacker can
compromise a sensor node in two ways:
• An attacker can physically capture a sensor node, connect
it to a high-end computing system, steal the security keys,
inject the malicious code, and thereby making the node
compromised.
• An attacker can logically (remotely) connect a sensor
node to high-end computing system, steal the secret
keys, and inject the malicious code to make the node
compromised.
To mitigate the damage incurred by compromised nodes,
the system should detect and revoke the nodes at the earliest
[12]. For addressing these issues, researchers have recently
proposed various node compromise detection schemes, as well
as revokation techniques. There are two approaches for han-
dling Node Compromising [9], namely, prevention schemes,
and detection schemes, as shown in Figure 1.

Jun-Won Ho et al. [1] proposed a scheme named ZoneTrust
(ZT) based on the concept of trust of a zone. If a zone is
untrusted, then the base station applies the software attestation
for each and every node in the zone. The drawbacks of this
approach are:
• It is necessary for the base station to communicate with
each and every sensor node of the untrusted zone which
results in high communication overhead.
• Software attestation is applied on every node in the
untrusted zones, in which some of the nodes are not
compromised. This leads to computation overhead.
• Due to communication and computation overheads,
ZoneTrust scheme consumes a lot of energy of the nodes.
• ZoneTrust considered only one parameter to determine
untrusted zone, that is, false information communication.
In our previous work, packet arrival time (odd time of
arrival) is used to detect a compromised node [14].
This paper proposes a better scheme with minimal overhead
called Parameter Grouping (PG). It identiﬁes the untrusted
nodes based on the ﬁve identiﬁed parameters of the behavior
based approach, namely, packet sending rate, node energy
depletion, node location, false information and non-availability
of sensor nodes. Then, base station applies software attestation

on those identiﬁed nodes to decide the compromised nodes.
Afterwards it revokes them immediately.
The rest of paper is organized as follows: Existing literature
on NCD is reviewed in Section II. Network model, as well as
attacker model are discussed in Section III. Section IV elab-
orates our proposed scheme (Parameter Grouping). Section V
presents the simulation results. Finally, the paper concludes
with Section VI.
II. RELATED WORK
The prevention-based techniques are the ﬁrst approach of
defense for protecting sensor nodes using cryptography. The
encryption and authentication are the primary measures in a
prevention-based technique, based on key management, as that
introduced in the security framework SPINS [7]. However, in
case the ﬁrst approach of defense is broken the compromised
nodes could extract security-sensitive information (e.g., secret
key), leading to breaches of security.
Thus, developing detection-based techniques as the second
approach of defense has become of paramount importance.
Detection based techniques aim at identifying misbehaviour
and to check integrity of software. Detection based techniques
are divided into two major categories as shown in Figure 1:
Behaviour based and Software attestation based schemes.
The Behaviour based schemes detect misbehaviour of sensor
nodes based on different parameters. For example, packet
arrival time, packet arrival rate, packet sending rate, node
location, node energy, etc. [5][6][11]. These techniques detect
only misbehaviour, but fail to check integrity of malicious
code.
The software-attestation based techniques have been pro-
posed to detect the malicious code of sensor nodes. Speciﬁ-
cally, the base station checks whether the ﬂash image codes
have been maliciously altered by performing attestation in
randomly chosen portions of image codes or the entire codes
[2][3][4]. These techniques detect only malicious code, but
fail to detect misbehaviour of sensor nodes. The security
architecture of wireless sensor networks [13] is shown Figure
2. The vertical comparison given in Figure 2 indicates that the
various WSN security issues are addressed in every layer of
the protocol stack from physical to application layers.

III. SYSTEM MODEL
A. Network Model
The sensor network considered for our study is a static
network in which a sensor node does not change its location
once deployed. Besides, it is assumed that the base station
is a trustworthy node. The communication between a sensor
(leaf) node and base station takes place in two levels: from
sensor node to Zone Head (ZH), and from ZH to base station.
It is assumed that in every zone a sensor node nearest to base
station is named as ZH. The proposed architectural model is
depicted in Figure 3.
Figure 3. Architecture of Wireless Sensor Network.
B. Attacker Model
We assume that an attacker attempts to compromise as many
nodes as possible in each zone. An attacker physically captures
sensor nodes or remotely accesses them, compromises them,
and re-deployes them back at different locations.
The attacker injects malicious code in all the captured nodes.
This results in high packet sending rate, as well as faster
depletion of compromised node’s energy. The compromised
nodes will be unavailable for the duration of the attack
injection. Hence, it is to be noted that certain parameter values
change unexpectedly.
C. AND-OR Model
The AND-OR Model estimates the trust of sensor nodes
based on the behavioural parameters such as packet sending
rate, depletion of node energy, node location, false information
and non-availability of a node.
The evaluation of ﬁve parameters is follows:
• PSR (Packet Sending Rate): It can take different values,
namely, HIGH, LOW, and NORMAL. If this parameter
has value HIGH, then it is considered as satisﬁed (i.e.,
true).
• DNE (Depletion of Node Energy): It takes three values,
namely, LOW, NORMAL, and HIGH. If DNE is equiv-
alent to HIGH, then it is considered as true.
• NL (Node Location): Two values are possible, namely,
Changed, and Unchanged. If NL is equivalent to
Changed, then it is considered as true.

• FI (False Information): Two values are possible, namely,
TRUE, and FALSE. If a node reports/communicates False
Information, then the value of FI parameter is set to
TRUE; else FALSE.
• NAN (Non Availability of Node): It takes two values,
namely, YES and NO. If a node sends information
periodically to ZH, it indicates its availability in the
WSN; then NAN is set to NO; otherwise, YES.
The AND model identiﬁes a node as untrustworthy, if
it satisﬁes all the above ﬁve parameters simultaneously. In
other words, the node is declared as untrustworthy when the
conjunction of the ﬁve parameters is true. If at least one
parameter is not true, then that node is not declared as untrust.
A node where all the identiﬁed parameters are valid/satisﬁed
is declared as untrusted. Some (not all) parameters may be
satisfying at each and every node of the network; and it might
be the case that some nodes are already compromised. But the
AND model does not detect these compromised nodes because
all the parameters are not satisfying at those compromised
nodes. Obviously, this model increases the vulnerability of the
network for attacks (i.e., High risk).
The condition of AND model to be veriﬁed at ithnode is
Ci=(PSRi ∧DNEi ∧NLi ∧FIi ∧NANi). Node Status, NS
is deﬁned as follows:
NS(Nodei, TimeIntervalk) =
(
Untrust, if(Ci == True)
Trust, else
(1)
where PSR: Packet Sending Rate, DNE: Depletion of Node
Energy, NL: Node Location, FI: False Information and NAN:
Non-Availability of Node.
The OR model categorizes a node as untrusted, which
satisﬁes at least one of the above mentioned ﬁve parameters.
In other words, the node is declared as untrusted when the
disjunction of the ﬁve parameters is true. If all the parameters
are not satisﬁed simultaneously, then only a node is declared
as trust.
When more and more parameters are identiﬁed for NCD,
only some (not all) parameters may be satisﬁed in case of a
large number of nodes. As per OR Model, these nodes, where
at least one parameter is valid, are identiﬁed as untrustworthy.
This increases the number of nodes to be applied the software
attestation to decide whether they are really compromised or
not (Even if one parameter is satisﬁed by a node, it calls
for software attestation for compromised node detection). This
increases the software attestation overhead for OR model.
The condition of OR model to be veriﬁed at ithnode is
Ci=(PSRi ∨DNEi ∨NLi ∨FIi ∨NANi). Node Status, NS
is deﬁned as follows:
NS(Nodei, TimeIntervalk) =
(
Untrust, if(Ci == True),
Trust, else
(2)
The main motivation of Parameter Grouping is to strike the
balance between risk of attack and attestation overhead. The
OR model has a main advantage of low risk, whereas the AND
model has the chief advantage of low overhead. To retain the
merits of both, it is required to combine the two approaches.
One way to achieve this is to group the parameters based on
some criteria. Then, apply OR model among the groups, and
the AND model within each group. In other words, a group
is declared as satisfying when all the group parameters are
true (AND model). All the groups are evaluated on the same
lines. Then the node under observation is declared as untrusted
only when the disjunction of all the groups’ outcomes is true
(OR model). Table I shows the comparison of AND and OR
Models.

Let the probability of a node declared as untrustworthy
when all the parameters are considered individually be p1,
and the probability of the same node declared as untrustworthy
when some (potentially distinct subset or group) of the param-
eters are considered conjunctively is p2. It can be intuitively
derived that p2 < p1. Based on this, the following conclusion
is drawn:
Less number of nodes will be identiﬁed as untrustworthy in
Parameter Grouping Model than the OR Model. It means that
PG model results in less overhead in software attestation.
Let q1 be the probability of a node declared as untrustworthy
when all the parameters are considered as conjunctively, and q2
be the probability of the same node declared as untrustworthy
when disjunctions of groups of parameters are considered. It
can be intuitively derived that q2 > q1. Based on this, the
following conclusion is drawn:
Relative to AND Model, more number of nodes will be
identiﬁed as untrustworthy in Parameter Grouping Model. It
implies that more number of nodes are declared as untrust-
worthy when any one group of parameters is valid. It means
that false negative rate (attack risk) is reduced compared to
AND Model. It is to be observed that AND and OR models
helps each other to mitigate the disadvantage of the other.
We can deploy AND-OR model and Parameter Grouping
in different types of applications of WSNs, namely, military
surveillance, weather monitoring etc.,
We discuss parameter grouping in detail in the next section.
IV. PARAMETER GROUPING
The motivation for parameter grouping is to overcome the
demerits of AND, as well as OR Models. Parameter grouping
is done based on their inter-relationship, for example, packet
sending rate and depletion of node energy are inter-related as
high packet sending rate results in high Depletion of Node En-
ergy (DNE). The parameters mentioned earlier are categorized
into three groups, namely, G1, G2, and G3, where G1={Packet
Sending Rate, Depletion of Node Energy }, G2={Node Loca-
tion, False Information}, G3={Non-Availability}. Mathemati-
cally, the concept of parameter grouping is explained below:

or
(G1i ∨ G2i ∨ G3i)
(3)
where G1=(PSRi ∧DNEi), G2=(NLi ∧FIi), G3=(NANi),
and ith node is suspected.
A. Group1 (G1)
The parameters, namely, PSR and DNE are made as one
group, say G1. It means that the conjunction of the two param-
eters becomes true only when both the parameters are satisﬁed.
If at least one parameter is not satisﬁed, the group outcome
becomes negative irrespective of the other parameter’s validity.
Here G1= (PSR ∧ DNE).
Packet Sending Rate: It is assumed that each sensor node
sends a packet to ZH in every interval. The packets sent by
all the members of the zone are maintained in a table. If any
one node sends more number of packets abnormally, that is
noticed by ZH. Then it determines that node’s PSR value is
True. Mathematically, PSR value of a ith node at time interval
k is
PSR(Nodei, TimeIntervalk) =
(
True, pi > Th
False, else
(4)
where pi is a number of packets received by ith.
Depletion of Node Energy: As every node sends only one
packet regularly to ZH, its battery energy depletes (consumes)
uniformly. If some node’s energy depletes quite fast (might
be due to high packet sending rate), it becomes abnormal.
The ZH notices this abnormality and suspects that node is
compromised. Our assumption is that if any node’s energy is
decreasing more than threshold value in each interval, then
that node’s DNE value is considered as True.
DNE(Nodei, TIk) =
(
True, Preen − Curen > Th
False, else
(5)
where i is nodeid, k is time interval, TI is TimeIntervalk,
Preen is the node’s energy in the previous interval and Curen
is the node’s energy in the current interval.
After ﬁnding out the values of PSR and DNE, the G1’s
validity and then equation 3 are to be evaluated.
B. Group2 (G2)
The parameters, node location and false information are
considered as one group. The reason for combining the two
parameters is when an attacker physically captures a node,
makes it compromised, and replaces it back at different
location usually. As it is compromised, the node is likely to
send false information to ZH. In other words, a node is sus-
pected only when its location is changed and the information
communicated by it to ZH is incorrect/unusual. G2= (NL ∧
FI). If at least one parameter is false, then G2 is false.
Node Location: As we are dealling with static sensor
network, nodes’ location remains unchanged usually. The ZH
maintains the locations of all the nodes, and suspects those
nodes which change their locations unusually.
NL(Nodei, TIk) =
(
False, if(Orgloc == Curloc)
True, else
(6)
where i is Nodeid, k is time interval, Orgloc is the node’s
orginal location, and Curloc is the node’s current location.
False Information: A sensor node is expected to communicate
to ZH in a predeﬁned format with an expected size, which is
coherent with all other nodes reports. Contrary to this, if ZH
notices incorrect and/or unusual information (in terms of size
and format), that node is suspected.
After ﬁnding out the values of NL and FI, the G2’s validity
and then equation 3 is to be evaluated.
C. Group3 (G3)
This group has the only one parameter, NAN. Any new
parameter which is coherent with this will be added to the
group. If a particular node is unavailabe for communication
because of physical capturing and compromisation activity, it
is observed by ZH as unusual or abnormal. Then that node is
declared as suspicous.

2: Search all the nodes exist or not
3: if missing time > th then
4:
G3 or NAN=True
5: else
6:
G3 or NAN=False
7: end if
By substituting the values of G1, G2, and G3 the equation
3 is evaluated. If at least one of the Group (G1, G2, G3) is
true, then the corresponding is node considered as untrusted.
The ZH informs to base station, when the untrusted nodes are
identiﬁed.
V. SIMULATION
An extensive simulation study was carried out using NS2
simulator (NS2.35) on Ubuntu platform. As mentioned in Sec-
tion III the network model consists of four zones with a total
of 25 nodes including four zone heads and one base station, as
shown in Figure 3. The routing and transport protocols used
in our simulation are DSDV ( Destination Sequenced Distance
Vector) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol), respectively. The
energy model is also included to know the residual battery
energy of a node whenever required. Simulation was carried
out based on the proposed concept of Parameter Grouping,
and results are analyzed.
A. Experimental Analysis
All the parameters considered in simulation and their val-
ues/ranges are speciﬁed in Table II. The simulation was carried
out by changing the number of nodes as 25, 30, 40, and 50.
The atomic unit of time for our simulation is 1 sec. Behaviour

Node Trust, The ﬁrst experiment was carried out by setting
the number of nodes as 25 and statistics, namely, event time,

transmitted are collected and tabulated in Table III. It is to be
observed that all the parameters are taking values as expected.
No parameter is found with abnormal value. Hence, it is
concluded that all the nodes in four zones are trustworthy.
In other words, no node is found that is untrustworthy. This
is also supported by the report of our NCD reporting system
(based on NS2 simulation).

The second simulation was carried out assuming that the
attack took place. It means that some nodes are physically
captured, compromised and re-located back at different loca-
tions. By observing the values of the identiﬁed parameters in
Table IV, abnormality can be noted.
With respect to node 8 entry in Table IV, G1 parameters:
PSR and DNE are true; and hence, the G1 also becomes
true. Similarly G2’s truth value (based on location and false
information , as well as, G3’s truth value becomes true. Hence
5, 8, and 10 are untrusted.
If we assume that a WSN is deployed for military surveil-
lance application, an attacker can make the captured node to
always report false (or misleading) information. For example,
a particular compromised node reporting vehicle motion all
the time.

As mentioned in Section I, the node is declared as com-
promised (NCD) if a node is untrustworthy and if the code is
altered. It is to be noted that whether the code is altered or
not is known through software attestation process; see Table
V for the NCD report of the proposed and developed system.
The compromised nodes are 5, 6, 8, 10, and 11 as per the
report of the developed system. The MD5 (Message Digest)
algorithm [16][17] is used for attestation. Compromised nodes
can be revoked in two ways, ﬁrst; one re-conﬁgure code of
the compromised nodes, and secondly remove from the sensor
network and replace with new nodes.
B. Performance Analysis
Let ’k’ be the number of zones, each having ’m’ number
of nodes as its members on an average. If we assume that at
least one zone is untrustworthy, then it is necessary for the BS
to communicate the code for software attestation to each and
every node of that zone (as per ZoneTrust concept). Hence,
the communication cost is of the order n=k×m (total number
of the nodes). Hence, the communication cost of ZoneTrust is
O(n).
If we use the Parameter Grouping concept, the complexity
decreases to O(k), where k << n. It is due to the need of BS
to communicate only with identiﬁed untrusted nodes.
As explained above, the computation complexity (to run
MD5 algorithm) of ZoneTrust is O(n), whereas that of the
proposed PG concept is O(k) where k << n.
We apply the standard metrics of performance for detection
systems [15].
• False Positives: It means that some benign nodes are
reported as compromised. The PG model eliminates false
positive reports. Systems with a low percentage of false
positives are accurate.

• False Negatives: It implies that compromised nodes are
reported as benign nodes. The PG model avoids false
neagtive also.

VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, Parameter Grouping concept for NCD in
WSN was proposed, simulated and analyzed. The analysis,
as well as simulation results prove that the computation and
communication cost of the proposed method is O(k), whereas
that of ZoneTrust method is O(n) where K is the number of
zones and n is the total number of sensor nodes in WSN and
k << n.
The proposed solution is to carry out further experimenta-
tion of Parameter Grouping concept by considering various
node compromise models based on probability theory. The
models are basic uniform, basic gradient, intelligent uniform,
and intelligent gradient. This is to increase security and
decrease the overhead of the system.
