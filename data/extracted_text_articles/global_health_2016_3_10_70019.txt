Abstract—Human tremor is a public health problem that can
lead to social and physical deterioration. Parkinson disease
(PD) is a slowly progressive degenerative disorder of the
central nervous system. It is more significant in elderly
patients. Its signs start to appear at the age of 59 years.
Levodopa is the most commonly used medication to reduce
tremor in PD patients, but has serious side effects. Vibration
absorbers can be used as a mechanical treatment that can
counter-act the involuntary tremor caused by difficulties to
give certain commands to the muscles. The hand is modeled at
the musculoskeletal level as a three degree-of-freedom (DOF)
system in the horizontal plane. The vibration absorbers are
designed to reduce the flexion angle at the shoulder, elbow and
wrist joints when the muscles are operating at the resonance
frequencies that belong to the range of resting tremor. Single
and dual series absorbers are designed to satisfy the tuning
conditions. The system’s behavior is analyzed in the frequency
and time domains. The suggested dual absorber is composed of
a series combination between the elastic absorber and the
viscous damper absorber. It is more efficient than a single
absorber of the same total mass and causes 85.7–86.6%, 88.4–
91.3% and 58.29–59.9% amplitude reduction at the shoulder,
elbow and wrist joints, respectively.

INTRODUCTION
Parkinson
disease
(PD)
is
a
multi-system
neurodegenerative disorder caused by a deficiency of
neurotransmitter dopamine within the brain and affects the
brain’s control of the muscles. It leads to shaking (tremor),
increased muscle tone (stiffness), slowed movements and
balance problems. Parkinson tremor is usually a resting
tremor characterized by adduction-abduction or flexion-
extension motion with frequency 3–7 Hz [1]. PD incidence
increases with aging. It is difficult to specify the exact
number of young patients affected by PD, but we know that
they are rarely affected by this illness. It is more significant
in elderly patients and its average onset age is 59 years [2].
Initial symptoms
may start early in life, but tremor
progresses over time and becomes significant to a physician
when the patient is elderly.
Dopaminergic drugs are medications which aim to
temporarily restore correct dopamine level in the substantia
nigra and striatum. This treatment reduces the motor
symptoms and signs of PD, without, however, curing the
disease or stopping its progression. Levodopa is the most
effective dopaminergic medication for elderly patients which
is converted in the brain into dopamine. The recommended
drug dose increases with the increased symptom severity, but
high doses can produce involuntary tremor and can lead to
serious side effects. In addition, about 25% of PD patients
can have a low quality of life since they do not respond to
drugs or neurosurgery treatments [3][4].
Vibration absorbers can be used as a mechanical
treatment to reduce the tremor of elderly Parkinson patients
by supplying certain commands to muscles to counter-act the
vibration. Hand’s involuntary tremor is transmitted to the
absorber, which causes the vibration of its proof mass.
Mechanical oscillations are considered as the main source for
the tremor, in which joints and muscle movements satisfy the
laws of physics. Therefore, a dynamic model of the human
hand can describe its response and can be used for the
numerical testing of absorber’s performance.
A method of biodynamic response has recently been used
to describe the motion of human hand and solve problems
related to tremor. Jackson et al. [5] modeled human upper
limbs as two pivoted straight rods (the upper arm, and the
forearm together with the hand) with concentrated mass at
centroid of each segment. The hand was modeled in vertical
plane during locomotion where flexion-extension planar
motion at the joints was considered. The described model
shows similar results to the available data on the movement
of the upper limb during locomotion. Raikova [6] described
the real anatomy of the muscle functions by modeling the
human upper limb as a seven degree-of-freedom (DOF)
system. The biomechanical model consists of the upper arm,
forearm and palm modeled as rigid bodies connected by the
shoulder joint (three-DOF spherical joint-connected
to
immobile trunk), elbow joint (two one-DOF pin joints) and
wrist joint (two-DOF Hook’s joint).
Hashemi et al. [7] designed a single DOF vibration
absorber that is and attached to the forearm. It was able to
reduce tremor amplitude numerically for the model hand and
experimentally for the fabricated model. Igusa and Xu [8]
studied the multiple mass dampers tuned within a frequency
range. They found that it is more robust than the tuned mass
damper with same the total mass. Gebai et al. [9] have
designed a single dynamic vibration absorber (DVA) capable
to suppress the steady state response of the hand system
excited
at
its
fundamental frequency.
Moreover,
they
proposed a single DVA which was able to help elderly

patients
suffering
from
neurodegenerative
disorder
by
reducing the homogenous as well as the steady state response
of the involuntary tremor at the hand joints [10]. They have
also
suggested
a
dual
parallel
DVA
to
reduce
the
pathological tremor in the hands of Parkinson patients when
excited at the dual harmonic resonance frequencies [11][12].
The study reveals that the dual DVA was more effective than
the single DVA with the same total mass.
In this study, a new three-DOF hand system is used to
describe the biodynamic response of the hand of a PD
Patient. The system is operating at the first two natural
frequencies due to the shoulder, elbow and wrist muscles
activation. The dynamic model of the hand is used to study
the performance of a dual DVA in suppressing the rest
tremor of a PD patient. This absorber is formed from an
elastic absorber connected in series to a viscous damper
absorber; we will call it the dual series elastic-viscous
damper (SEVD) absorber. This absorber is connected to the
forearm of the hand and compared to the single TVA of the
same total mass. Both absorbers are designed to satisfy the
tuning condition. The equation of motion for the system is
derived using the non-Lagrangian formulation and solved
using system’s transfer function. The flexion angle at the
hand joints are shown in the frequency and time domains.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the
dynamic structure of the model hand system, its sized
segments and the derived equations of motion. Section 3
describes the designing steps for tuning the absorbers.
Section 4 presents the frequency and time domain response
at hand’s proximal joints. Section 5 provides a comparison
with the previous studies done. Section 6 includes the
conclusions and recommendation for future work.

BIODYNAMIC HAND MODELING
The human hand shown in Fig. 1 is modeled in the
horizontal plane as a three-DOF system reflecting the
biodynamic
response
of
a
Parkinson
Patient.
Most
researchers agreed on modeling the bones and corresponding
soft tissues as rigid bodies connected by frictionless joints
with fixed axes or centers of rotation [13]. So, the hand
segments are described as rigid bodies where the upper arm
and forearm (ulna and radius) are modeled as truncated
cones and the palm as rectangular plates to specify their
volume (V). The three segments are connected by one-DOF
frictionless kinematic pairs to permit the flexion-extension
planar motion at the proximal joints. The upper arm is
pinned by the shoulder joint, which is fixed to the trunk in
order to reflect the resting condition of the hand. The length
(l), position of centroid from proximal joints (r̅ ) and density
(D) used for each segment are provided experimentally by
Drillis et al. [14] and shown in Table 1. Then, the mass (m)
and the mass moment (I) of each sized segment are
calculated using the following equation:

and the obtained results are listed in Table 2. The four
muscles modeled to produce a movement are: the single joint
shoulder, elbow and wrist joint muscles and the Biceps
brachii muscle. Theoretically, muscles can be assumed to be
regulated independently [7]. The modeled stiffness and
damping coefficients of the considered muscles are provided
in Table 3. Damping and stiffness coefficients of the muscles
are assumed to be linearly proportional [15]. The active
inputs can be described as muscular activity [16] and can be
considered as sinusoidal function(s) [17].
Equation of motion for the hand system with a single
DVA attached to the forearm is provided by Gebai et al.
[9][12] and derived using the non-Lagrangian formulation. A
similar strategy is used for the hand controlled by the dual
SEVD DVA, where the general equation of motion is:

TUNED ABSORBER’S DESIGN
Two tuned vibration absorbers (TVAs) are designed to be
attached separately to the forearm at the same position. The
two absorbers have the same total mass (251.2 g) and the
same total length (8.5 cm).
As demonstrated by Gebai et al. [9], as the absorber’s
joint approaches the position of the wrist joint, more
reduction can be achieved at the palm. Taking into
consideration
the
maximum
designed
length
of
both
absorbers, the absorbers will be tested at a position la which
is 8.5 cm away from the wrist joint (la = l2 – 8.5 cm).
Absorbers dimensions can be chosen depending on the
Dunkerley’s semi-empirical formulation [18] as done by
Gebai et al. [9][10][12].
The single DVA is modeled as a stainless steel alloy
cantilevered beam with a copper mass attached along its
length. Its configuration, dimensions and equivalent linear
model are shown in Fig. 2. No damper is attached to this
absorber, a very little damping can be provided by the
beam’s material. The stiffness (ka) and damping (ca)
coefficients are assumed to be proportional by a constant [7],
such that ca = 0.005ka. This elastic absorber is tuned to the
second natural (9) frequency of the primary system to reduce
the resting tremor at this frequency:

damping coefficient and a copper mass attached along its
length. It is modeled at the tuning condition of (10). At the
end of the elastic absorber’s beam, a purely high damping
material having a zero stiffness coefficient is modeled as
beam’s material. A copper mass is attached along the beam’s
end. The appropriate dimensions and equivalent linear model
of this absorber are shown in Fig. 3. The damping coefficient
(ca) in the viscous damper absorber of the SEVD absorber is
designed to satisfy the tuning condition of the fundamental

Maximum flexion angles are shown in Fig. 4 at the

similar behavior to the single TVA with much damped

subjected to tremor amplification at 7.623 Hz because of the
high shifting to the right in the highest resonance frequency
of the primary system due to its damper. The dual SEVD
TVA is a very effective absorber at system’s resonance
frequencies and most of the other frequencies. It can cause a
very high reduction in the resting tremor’s amplitude in the

In Fig. 5a-c, the time domain response (19) at the shoulder,
elbow and wrist joints responses of the hand excited at the
first two resonance frequencies is shown due to the single
joint muscles activation (8). The single TVA and dual SEVD

The percentage of reduction at the shoulder, elbow and wrist
joints due to attaching both absorbers to the forearm is
summarized in Table 5.
It is shown that the dual SEVD
TVA is an important absorber to be considered. It causes
85.7–86.6%, 88.4–91.3% and 58.29–59.9% reduction in the
involuntary tremor’s amplitude transmitted to the shoulder,
elbow and wrist joints due to the activated muscles.

The SEVD and single TVAs have the same total mass and

However, the DEVD dual TVA is more effective than the
single TVA in reducing the flexion angular displacements.

hand modeling that can best reflect Parkinsonism and that
takes into account the tremor displacement at most allowed
angular displacements. In addition, developments in the
absorbers design are of high importance. Changing in the
configuration of the passive absorber aiming to increase its
performance attracted many researchers [8][12].
In a previous study, Hashemi et al. [7] have modeled the
human hand as two uniform rigid rods to describe the
flexion-extension motion of the elbow and shoulder joints.
The system was excited due to the elbow muscle activation
driven at a single frequency. In our study, the hand system is
modified considering an additional DOF to describe the
angular displacement at the wrist joint of a system actuated
with several muscles. In [7], a one-DOF absorber was
attached to the forearm but it was not designed at the tuning
condition. The resonance frequency was 2.24 Hz while the
absorber’s natural frequency was 2.755 Hz. So, the absorber
was not designed to operate at its maximum performance.
Rahnavard et al. [19] used the same hand model designed
by Hashemi et al. [7]. However, the single DOF absorber’s
parameters were designed using the H2 optimization method.
The proposed system leads to a 20 cm long absorber
providing high percentage of reduction at the shoulder and
elbow joints. In our study, very effective single and dual
TVAs are designed with an optimum length of 8.5 cm at all
the hand joints.

CONCLUSION
The three-DOF dynamic model of the human hand is
designed to reflect the biodynamic response at the proximal
joints of an elderly PD patient. The model describes the
flexion-extension motion for the system operating at resting
tremor’s resonance frequencies in the horizontal plane. Two
absorbers having the same total mass and length are tuned to
reduce the involuntary tremor transmitted to the hand joints
due to the single joint muscles activation. Both absorbers are
tested when attached at the same position on the forearm.
The one-DOF absorber causes 61.4–69.9%, 72.5–81.2% and
54.4–64.3% reduction in tremor amplitude at the shoulder,
elbow and wrist joints in the time domain. A very effective
two-DOF SEVD TVA is used for tremor reduction. The
SEVD is formed from a series combination between the
elastic absorber and the viscous damper absorber. It causes
85.7–86.6%, 88.4–91.3% and 58.29–59.9% reduction at the
shoulder, elbow and wrist joints.
As future work, the molded hand system can be sized
depending on the hand dimensions of a real Parkinson
patient. Then, the suggested passive controllers can be
manufactured and tested when attached to the forearm of the
real hand. In addition, a comparison can be done between the
numerical and experimental studies.
