Abstract—5G standard is targeting much higher data rates as 
compared to existing wireless technologies to accommodate the 
ever-increasing demand for faster wireless applications. A 
transmitter is required to implement a 5G system. In this 
paper, we are presenting a 28 GHz novel monolithic 
transmitter architecture on GaN substrate that offers Size, 
Weight, Area, Power and Cost (SWAP-C) advantages. The 
transmitter contains a Yagi antenna, which consists of three 
directors, two drivers, a strip line feed, a substrate and a 
ground plane. According to simulation results, the designed 
Yagi antenna has a compact size and low loss at the selected 
frequency of 28 GHz. At this frequency, its return loss, gain, 
and beam width are -38 dB, 8.69 dB, and 57.2 degrees, 
respectively. The second component in the monolithic chain is 
a bandpass filter (BPF), which offers enhanced selectivity and 
stopband suppression on GaN substrate. The Bandpass filter 
has a minimum insertion loss of 0.6dB at 28GHz. The rejection 
level is higher than 10 dB in the stop band. Further, a 
collaborative simulation of 28 GHz mixer for upconversion 
with CLASS-E power amplifier (PA) with integrated octature 
structure to achieve robust load insensitivity is presented. In 
this paper to design high-efficiency PA, we implemented 
harmonic load pull at both the input and output of the active 
device to obtain optimum impedances at fundamental and 
second-harmonic frequencies. After an iterative process, the 
optimum input and output impedances are obtained. In 
addition, we also implemented cascaded octature power cell 
structure. The proposed balanced PA achieves a saturated 
output power (Psat) of 13.5dBm and a maximum Power Added 
Efficiency (PAEmax) of 55%. It consumes 210mW power. The 
presented transmitter configuration is designed on a GaN 
substrate with a thickness of 0.8 mm, permittivity (Er) of 9.7,  
 
and loss tangent (TanD) of 0.025. Based on its performance at 
28 GHz, the designed transmitter is being developed for the 5G 
application.

 INTRODUCTION  
Fifth generation wireless network (5G) has become 
research focus since it could support the explosive growth of 
data traffic, massively interconnected devices, and new 
applications. It is expected that 5G will utilize spectrum at 
millimeter wave (MMW)  frequencies to satisfy the demand 
for massive bandwidth since the spectrum resources in the 
lower frequency bands are running out.  Resources have 
been invested to develop prototype millimeter wave 5G 
mobile communication systems, especially for frequency 
band such as 28GHz. Therefore 27.5 to the 29.5GHz band is 
a strong candidate for the new 5G radio interface and much 
of the research undertaken to date has considered this band. 
For example, Samsung Electronics has built a prototype 
system including beamforming antenna that works at  
28GHz [1], However, to our knowledge single chip 
transmitter on GaN does not exist for the 5G application. An 
overview of the architecture and components for our 
transmitter module on a GaN chip are shown in Figure 1. 
The Integrated Chip consists of a chain of various individual 
components such as yagi antenna, power amplifier, 
bandpass filter, upconverter, mixer and matching circuitry.

The presented transmitter configuration is designed on a 
GaN substrate with a thickness of 0.8 mm, permittivity (Er) 
of 9.7, and loss tangent (TanD) of 0.025. The goal is to 
ultimately fabricate the proposed transmitter module on 
GaN substrate.The Yagi antenna is designed using HFSS 
(High-Frequency Structure Simulator) simulation software. 
Rest of the blocks of the transmitter,  bandpass filter, Mixer, 
Power amplifier, and matching network circuitry are 
designed using Advanced Design System (ADS) simulation 
software.

DESIGN AND RESULT & DISCUSSION OF 
TRANSMITTER MODULE ON GAN CHIP 
A.  Yagi Antenna  
Yagi antenna was proposed by researchers from Japan 
usually for radio application [2]. Such antenna was 
developed for X-band, Ku-band, and K-band, etc. 
Generally, a design of Yagi antenna places a driver and 
director’s elements on one side of PCB and places a 
reflector on the reverse side. A driver is utilized for 
radiating electromagnetic wave whilst directors and a 
reflector is utilized to focus the electromagnetic wave 
radiation from its driver. But, the design of Yagi antenna is 
more challenging if it is being designed at 28 GHz on GaN 
substrate instead of PCB. 
In this paper, we present the design of novel structure 
Yagi antenna, which shows good radiation efficiency and 
gain. The design of proposed Yagi antenna is shown in 
Figure. 2. It is composed of three directors, two drivers, a 
strip line for feed and a reflector. This antenna can be 
configured in MIMO format if needed. The antenna is made 
from gold with a thickness of 0.035 mm and electric 
conductivity of 4.1 x 107 Siemens/m considering GaN as 
substrate. In order to match antenna impedance with another 
device, the impedance was optimized for 50 Ohm. To fulfill 
such requirement, its feed- width was set to be 1.8 mm. 
Details of the Yagi antenna design parameters that allowed 
best performance is shown in Table I. Figure 3 shows 
simulated return loss of -38dB for 27.4 GHz to 28.4 GHz 
with a center frequency of 28 GHz. Antenna results are 
mentioned in Table 2.

B. Band-Pass Filter Design 
Filters are an essential part of wireless communications 
systems as they are required to suppress undesired signals in 
the transceiver pass-band. The size, weight, cost, and loss of 
such filters must be kept as low as possible. 
In this paper, the design of a core circuit using microstrip 
line has been conceived and designed as shown in Figure.4. 
Small size, low cost, and good performance multifunction

filters are the main development trend in microwave/MMW 
domain. Filters with high selectivity and good stopband 
performances are extensively studied [3]. On the other hand, 
the GAN substrate has attractive characteristics, such as 
wide frequency range, static dielectric constant, low thermal 
expansion coefficient and very low water absorption [10]. In 
this paper, a Band-Pass Filter (BPF) based on broadside 
coupling H-shape resonators and half wavelength resonators 
are implemented on two-layer GAN substrate, which has 
relatively small sizes and good selectivity. 
The dimensions of BPF filter are listed in Table 3.

Figure 5 shows the simulated results of the designed BPF. 
The 3dB bandwidth is from 27.6GHz to 29.2GHz. This 
filter has a minimum insertion loss of 0.6dB at 28GHz. The 
rejection level is higher than 10 dB in the stop band. The 
return loss of BPF is more than -40 dB at 28 GHz.  
C. Impedance Matching Network  
At 28GHz frequency, the reflected power occurs when the 
load impedance is not matched to the characteristic 
impedance of source (mixer) and load (PA). Impedance 
matching using the passive network is critical to achieving 
maximum power transfer, minimum reflection, and 
adequate harmonic rejection. In order to overcome such 
problems, we propose matching network approach is based 
on Smith chart. Through Smith Chart, we can get a 
matching network at a certain frequency easily. When 
utilizing the Smith Chart to design matching networks at the 
center frequency, the next steps should be followed: 
 
Find out the output impedance Zout of previous stage 
transistor and the input impedance Zin of next stage 
transistor.

 
Find out the points of Zout, Zin in the Smith Chat. 
 
Describe the maximum equal Q curve Qmax from the 
points of Zou, Zin.  
 
In the extension of the Smith Chart constructed by Qmax, 
add appropriate microstrips and capacitances to make 
Zout and Zin conjugate match. 
Then, consider the network composed of micro-strips as the 
initial matching network. We designed such matching 
network using ADS. This network is designed to operate at 
28 GHz frequency with a normalized impedance of 50 Ω. 
Where ZS is source output impedance, ZL is load input 
impedance. We calculated stub values mentioned in Figure. 
6 using ADS. Figure. 6 shows the objective function to 
optimize the whole matching networks. Figure.7 shows 
return loss plots of machining networks; the rejection level 
is higher than 10 dB in the stop band. 
D. Mixer Design  
The transmit Signal coming from baseband is almost at 
DC, hence it must be upconverted to high frequency at 
which antenna is working. In order to do that signal must be 
up-converted using MMW mixer.   Doubly-balanced Mixers 
(DBM) are usually the desirable mixer because of their 
superior suppression of spurious mixing products and good 
port-to-port isolation [4].  An ultra-wideband balanced 
microstrip balun was reported [4], but this type of balun was 
difficult to fabricate. A 28 GHz mixer based on the 
Marchand balun was fabricated in 0.15ȝm GaAs PHEMT 
technology, similar to our proposed design in GaN 
technology. 
In this paper, a 28 GHz doubly-balance mixer based on the 
[12] Marchand balun in the 27GHz to 30 GHz RF/LO range 
and DC to 5GHz IF is presented. The collaborative 
simulation of HFSS and ADS has been adopted in mixer 
design, the balun in LO port and RF port are simulated by 
the full-wave electromagnetic simulator in HFSS, then the S 
parameter data of the balun are exported to the mixer circuit 
in ADS. The mixer offers about 10dB typical conversion 
loss, high gain compression, higher than 20dB LO-to-RF 
isolations and about 10dB return loss across 27GHz to 30 
GHz. 
1) The Balun Design  
The balun was simulated by using Ansoft HFSS and 
Agilent ADS. The Marchand balun was compensated by 
two open-circuited stubs at the output ports, the coupled line 
model in the circuit initially was used to predict the 
performance, and then simulated by using the full-wave 
electromagnetic simulator to improve the accuracy of the 
simulation finally. The 3D structure of the balun used in the 
mixer was drawn by HFSS and shown in Figure.8, which is 
designed for GaN substrate with thickness 0.8mm and 
dielectric constant 9.7. 1 is the input port and 2 3 are output 
ports. Impedances of three ports are all set to be 50 Ω and 
the microstrip line width is 0.25mm, and l. w2 and w3 stand 
for the length the width and the gap width of the microstrip 
lines, the hole is metallization and connected to ground. The 
Marchand balun is simulated by optimizing w2 and w3.

port and LO port is power source port, the IF port is load 
port, all the port is set to 50Ω. Two gold lines are set to near 
the real condition, the line is set to 5mm length and the 
diameter is 0. 1mm. The capacitances are used in LO port to 
make the minimal frequency of the IF port extend to DC. 
C1=C2=0.5Pf. The simulated result of the mixer circuit 
conversion gain was obtained using the harmonic balance 
method in Figure. 10. The type conversion gain is about 9. 
3dB.  
E. Power Amplifier Design  
For wireless communication systems, power amplifiers 
(PAs) with high efficiency is critical as they consume the 
majority of the power of the systems and closely related to 
the thermal problem. As a result, many categories of high-
efficiency PAs have been widely studied in recent years The 
Class-E amplifier is well known for its high efficiency and 
simple structure. Moreover, inherent output capacitor of a 
transistor deteriorates the performance of a Class-E 
amplifier at high frequency. To address above problems, the 
Class-E amplifier was designed by modifying the device 
output impedances at odd and even harmonics, so as to 
shape the output voltage and current that minimize the 
overlap to achieve high efficiency [7].  
In this paper, a simple method of designing high-
efficiency PA is presented. Compared with other works, this 
method is easier to design harmonic tuned PA and thus 
achieves relatively high efficiency with fewer harmonics to 
control. The simulated results indicate a high-efficiency 
Class-E PA is realized with 55% PAE and 13.5 dBm output 
power at 28 GHz. 
However, the challenge of the MMW PA design is to 
deliver maximum output power with a maximum Power 
Added Efficiency (PAE) and high linearity [8]. For this 
purpose, to achieve high efficiency, we have implemented 
two techniques. Technique one is harmonic load pull 
conducted at both the input and output of the active device 
to obtain optimum impedances at fundamental and second-
harmonic frequencies. After an iterative process, the 
optimum input and output impedances are obtained. 
Technique two is cascaded octature power cells structure is 
implemented. The presented circuit is implemented in GaN 
HEMT technology taking, the advantage of high-frequency 
performance and high power performance [9].  
1) Design process:  
To achieve the target output power, a total of eight stages 
were power-combined in the output stage. This output stage 
was driven by a pair of devices, and this, in turn, was driven 
by an input stage realized using a single transistor. The 
transistor sizes in each stage needed to be identical, and the 
basic power-combining topology needed to be similar.  
The individual PA structure is shown in Figure. 11 is 
composed of three series transmission lines with one 
parallel open-circuit stub located between the first two lines 
are used as the impedance matching circuit, which is a 
simplified method of the distributed multi-frequency 
matching approach, as introduced previously [10]. The 
single transmission line before the open stub is used to tune 
the impedance of the second harmonic, while the two series

transmission lines after the open stub are used to tune the 
impedance of the fundamental mode. Therefore, optimum 
impedance control at fundamental and second-harmonic 
frequencies can be realized simultaneously. The simulated 
large-signal performance is plotted in Figure. 12. 
 
F. End to End Module performance  
To investigate the loss of proposed transmitter 
architecture, we have simulated S11 of transmitter module 
chain (with Yagi antenna, a BPF, mixer, matching network 
and power amplifier) in ADS.  The results are shown in 
Figure.13. We plotted S11 to find the loss of the whole 
module and the S11 value at 28 GHz is lower than -30 dB, 
which is excellent. 
III. 
CONCLUSION 
The design of a novel transmitter module on a single chip 
using GaN/Si as the substrate is presented in this paper. The 
transmitter module consists of Yagi antenna, BPF, 
impedance matching network, up-conversion mixer and 
power amplifier. We investigated innovative designs for the 
transmitter components with potential for integration on a 
GaN substrate. To validate our designs, we selected 28 GHz 
but module design can be easily scaled to higher millimeter 
wave frequencies, such as 60 GHz for the 5G system. 
Designed transmitter module shows loss of less than -10 dB 
at 28 GHz, which can be further improved with design 
refinement. To our knowledge, this is first reported the 
design of monolithic transmitter module on GaN chip. Our 
proposed module will offer significant SWAP-C (size, 
weight, area, power and cost) advantages.
