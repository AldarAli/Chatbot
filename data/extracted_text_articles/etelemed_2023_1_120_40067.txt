Abstract—The study assessed user satisfaction with a new 
Electronic Health Record (EHR) system in the Northern 
Norway Regional Health Authority and compared it to a 
baseline. The baseline surveys were conducted in 2016 and 2018, 
and the survey after implementing the new HER system was 
done in 2021. A comparative analysis was performed, with the 
primary statistical method used for analysis being frequency 
(percentage) for discrete variables and mean for continuous 
variables. The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used 
to determine whether there are any statistically significant 
differences between the means of satisfaction for baseline data 
vs. the 2021 data. The results indicated an improvement in 
overall user satisfaction with the new system, with many users 
being either satisfied or neutral. The study also analyzed the 
generic satisfaction factors of the EHR system and found a 
positive shift from dissatisfaction to satisfaction or neutrality. 
The study revealed that specific functions of the EHR system 
still require improvement, with the lowest satisfaction ratings 
given to overview of drug treatment, prescribe drugs, and care 
planning. However, users were most satisfied with the functions 
of the overview of outstanding tasks and the overview of patient 
issues. The results also showed a reduction in system 
interruptions compared to the baseline, contributing to higher 
user satisfaction. Overall, the results suggest that the new EHR 
system has improved user satisfaction compared to the previous 
system, but further improvements are needed for enhanced user 
experience. Increased user satisfaction is an important finding 
considering theory of the installed base that states an expected 
decrease in satisfaction when implementing a new system.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
The focus has been directed toward digitalization in an 
effort for more efficient ways to operate the healthcare 
system. Part of the digitalization process has been the 
increased adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHR) [1]. 
In the last twenty years, the rapid development of EHR 
systems has changed what is possible to do within an EHR 
system. The development has gone from merely creating and 
storing the patient's health records electronically to an 
integrated health information system that helps patients and 
healthcare workers in their daily life, with examples such as 
clinical decision support [2][3].  
The Norwegian government has long been pushing for a 
new generation of EHR systems, mandated by the national 
white paper 9, 'One citizen – one Health Record [4]. Thus, in 
the last decade, there has been a planning process for 
considerable change in the EHR infrastructure in Norway. 
Three of four regional health authorities used the EHR system 
DIPS Classic, and the fourth region used DocuLive EHR. 
Norway's four regional health regions started implementing 
new EHR systems in 2021, which is still ongoing. DIPS 
Classic will be replaced with DIPS Arena, and DocuLive will 
be replaced with EPIC EHR. The first health region to 
implement DIPS Arena was the Northern Norway Regional 
Health Authority. DIPS Arena is a Norwegian-developed 
EHR built on an Open EHR platform, their third-generation 
journal system. The new system is expected to provide new 
possibilities while ensuring patient safety according to 
international standards and providing a modern user 
interface. 
While there are mixed results, some research says that the 
EHR is suggested to improve the efficiency, quality of care, 
and create a better workflow [1]. It also might have some 
negative consequences, such as more time-consuming 
documentation [5] practices and increased burnout [6]. In 
addition to the usual undesirable aspects of EHR, 
implementing a new EHR system adds further obstacles, with 
barriers such as a lack of training and support, restrictions on 
resources, and a lack of literacy [1]. Prior research has shown 
that an EHR implementation going from one EHR system to 
another is difficult to accomplish [7]. The basic principle of 
an Information Infrastructure (II) is that it is never built from 
scratch; instead, it grows through the evolution of an installed 
base [8]. The Installed base grows and increasingly 
influences its environment during its revolution from being 
implemented to being replaced [7]. The evolution of an 
implementation process where generic systems replace 
essential parts of an II increases the risk of failure and 
unexpected side effects. Due to this, an implementation 
should build on the installed base instead of replacing it to 
succeed [9]-[11]. To optimize the utilization of the EHR 
system and further improvement, an in-depth understanding 
of user satisfaction is necessary. User satisfaction can be 
influenced by a multitude of factors [12], including but not 
limited to usability [13] and prior system experience [14].

Previous studies have looked at measuring user 
satisfaction [15] and functionality [16] with the EHR systems 
in Norway. This study seeks to examine if this trend 
continues with the implementation of a new EHR system, as 
we were able to measure user experience shortly after the 
implementation. Thus, this study aims to evaluate user 
satisfaction in the implementation phase of the new EHR 
system and compare it with user satisfaction from the former 
EHR system to see if there is any change in satisfaction.  
This paper's overall structure contains five sections: 
Section II explains the applied quantitative methods. Section 
III presents the study's results on satisfaction and discusses 
ethical considerations and limitations. In Section IV, we 
discuss comparing the data and the findings. In the last part, 
Section V, we conclude with the results and suggest how to 
increase satisfaction for suppliers, health workers, and 
policymakers. 
II. 
METHODS 
In this section, we focus on the questionnaire, statistical 
methods, and data collection. 
A. Setting 
Norway's four regional health authorities govern the 
hospital sector: SouthEast, West, Central, and North. All the 
regions were in the year 2021 in a transition phase, preparing 
to implement a new EHR system. Northern Norway Regional 
Health Authority hospitals transitioned from DIPS Classic to 
DIPS Arena in 2021. Region West was the next to implement 
the same system in 2022. Region SouthEast has decided to 
implement the new system by 2025. The Central Region 
started a transition from DocuLive EHR to EPIC EHR system 
in 2022. This process is ongoing, and some hospitals still use 
the old system. All the regions are transitioning from an 
already existing electronic health record.  
This paper will compare data before and after 
implementing the new EHR system in the Northern Norway 
Regional Health Authority. The data collection was done in 
2021 as they were the first and only region to start 
implementing the new system. The hospitals include the 
University Hospital of North Norway (UNN), Nordland 
Hospital (NLSH), and Finnmark Hospital (FSH). 
B. Data collection 
This paper makes use of three surveys among EHR users 
in Norwegian hospitals. The first survey from 2016 included 
physicians only [12]. The EHR system in use was DIPS 
Classic. A total of 402 physicians were enrolled from three 
Norwegian hospitals, and 208 physicians (52%) submitted a 
fully answered questionnaire. Data from the largest hospital 
(Oslo university hospital) was included in this study. 
Exclusion criteria were no patient contact or if they had been 
employed for less than three months. Up to 10 reminders were 
sent in case of no response.  
The second survey was administered in the autumn of 
2018 [11]. The hospitals contributed with employers' email 
addresses, and a random-number generator selected the 
participants. EHR systems in use were DocuLive and DIPS 
Classic. For this survey, both physicians and nurses were 
included. A total of 506 clinicians were invited for the survey. 
You had to work full-time at one of the included hospitals to 
be included. A total of 299 persons completed the 
questionnaire, where 60 (20.1%) had a profession as nurses, 
and 239 (79.9%) were physicians. Response rates were 
35.0%, 22.0%, and 29.0% for physicians, nurses, and all 
clinicians. Ten reminders were issued between September to 
December 2018. 
The latest and present survey was conducted in the autumn 
of 2021 after implementing the new EHR system. The 
hospitals wanted to administer the participant recruitment 
themselves. The invitation was sent to all hospital employees. 
The EHR system in use was the new DIPS Arena. A total of 
603 employees started the survey, and 221 (36.5%) completed 
the survey. These respondents were EHR users of different 
professions. Physicians, nurses, and other professionals 
accounted for 25.8%, 36.2%, and 38.0%, respectively. The 
three hospitals had 5,393 full-time equivalent positions in 
2021, of which 1,606 (30.0%) were doctors, and 3,787 (70%) 
were nurses. The studied population of doctors and nurses 
represented 2.5% of the total number of full-time equivalent 
positions, with 3.6% of all doctors and 2.1% of all nurses. The 
sampling method is not ideal due to the lack of control over 
who got the survey. This may have affected which groups 
answered the survey, and it may lead to a bias where those 
who are more interested in the topic or have a stronger opinion 
may be more likely to respond. In this data collection, the 
hospital administration issued two reminders to the 
respondents from September to December 2021.  
As data included in this paper regards hospitals using 
DIPS Classic (2016 and 2018 surveys) and DIPS Arena (2021 
survey), this excludes one hospital from the 2018 survey as 
they used another EHR system (DocuLive EPR). From the 
2021 survey, only nurses and physicians were included in the 
data analysis to compare the clinical roles from the 2016 and 
2018 data collection. In this sense, survey data from 2016 and 
2018 serves as a baseline compared to the results after 
implementing the new DIPS Arena in 2021.  
C. Questionnaire 
The survey is based on a previously validated 
questionnaire [17]. Changes were made in 2021 to the full 
questionnaire as it was too time-consuming. However, the 
items regarding satisfaction remain equal to the previous 
studies. This new questionnaire is an early effort to develop 
ISO-based indicators for user satisfaction among clinical 
EHR users.

Two different survey programs were used to conduct the 
survey: in 2018, Questback (Questback, Oslo, Norway), and 
in 2016 and 2021, Limesurvey (LimeSurvey GmbH, 
Hamburg, Germany). All questionnaires were anonymous 
and constructed dynamically, hence that the respondents 
would only answer relevant questions that were relevant to 
them. Before conducting the surveys, they were piloted 
through interviews to get the necessary feedback.  
The questionnaire mainly used a 5-point Likert scale 
('Completely 
disagree,' 
'Partially 
disagree,' 
'Neutral,' 
'Partially agree, 'Completely agree'). Some questions were 
only rated as agree/disagree or asking for a numeric response. 
Three sub-categories are used to measure user satisfaction; 
EHR Function satisfaction (11 items; Q1-Q11), EHR Generic 
satisfaction (four items; G1-G4), and EHR Overall 
satisfaction (one item; O1).  
D. Analysis/statistical methods 
The main statistical methods used for analysis were 
frequency (percentage) for discrete variables and mean for 
continuous variables. The one-way analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) was used to determine whether there are any 
statistically significant differences between the means of 
satisfaction for baseline data vs. the 2021 data. The 
significance level was considered p=.05. The statistical 
software SPSS 25 (IBM Corp., Armond, NY) was used for 
the analysis. In the process of cleaning data, we had to 
address missing values. There was a high number of missing 
values for satisfaction items, n=616 (24.4%), as some 
questionnaire items depended on profession (e.g., nurse do 
not prescribe drugs). Several imputation techniques have 
been suggested when missingness is completely random 
(MCAR) and when there are no systematic reasons for 
missingness [18]. We addressed missing values by applying 
the MCAR assumption by Little [19]. The results confirmed 
that the missingness is MCAR (χ2 =1564.299, df=1493, 
p=.10). Then, we let SPSS impute our missing values based 
on the expectation-maximization (EM) analysis that 
estimates the means, correlations, and covariances.  
E. Ethics 
The Regional Committee for Medical and Health 
Research Ethics South-East Norway has been consulted. 
According to national regulations and ethics, approval was not 
required because the study did not involve biomedical 
research, and all data were anonymized.

RESULTS 
A. Baseline data  
The number of participants that completed the 2021 
questionnaire and were EHR users was n=221 (82.5%). From 
this sample, 70.1% were female; the mean experience was 
17.4 years (sd=11.0); the mean age was 45.9 years (sd=11.6). 
The clinical field with the highest number of participants was 
the aggregation of those treating conditions related to mental 
health and substance abuse (30.8%), medical (29.4%), 
surgical (19.0%), and other (20.8%). Physicians, nurses, and 
other professionals accounted for 25.8% (n=57), 36.2% 
(n=80), and 38.0% (n=84), respectively. Participants from the 
hospitals, FSH, NLSH, and UNN accounted for 28.5% 
(n=63), 40.7% (n=90), and 30.8% (n=68), respectively. 
Table I summarizes the baseline data by year, health 
region, and participants' clinical role. The clinical field with

related to surgical, psychiatry, and others, with n=130 
(34.8%), n=36 (9.6%), and n=39 (10.4%), respectively. 
B. Questionnaire results and interuptions 
Two questions related to interruptions of the clinical 
workflow while using the EHR. The first one regarded 
interruption caused by login requests; results range from 4 to 
50 interruptions per day (outliers removed). The mean number 
of interruptions for physicians and nurses per day is 15.13. 
The corresponding number from the 2018 and 2016 data was 
17.21 and 17.15, respectively.  
The second interruption regarded interruption due to the 
EHR hanging or crashing. The median number of 
interruptions is four, corresponding to one per month in the 
scale used. The corresponding numbers from the 2018 and 
2016 data were three, once a week, for both studies. Only 
12.3% of respondents reported interruptions that occurred 
once or more per day, 36.1% reported weekly interruptions, 
and 51.5% reported interruptions that ranged between once a 
month and none. The corresponding numbers from the 
baseline data were 35.1%, 37.7%, and 27.3%, respectively. 
C. User satisfaction 
The aggregated results for the three types of satisfaction 
significantly increased after the implementation of the new 
system, see Figure 1. There was a statistically significant 
effect on the satisfaction from the 2021 survey, except for item 
Q4  (See Table II). Items Q1, Q2, and Q11 show a significant 
decrease in satisfaction. An overview of the single items for 
satisfaction is in Figure 2.  
EHR Function satisfaction. For overall function 
satisfaction (questiQ1-Q11), 35.0% of respondents reported 
being satisfied, 30.7% neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, and 
18.2% dissatisfied.  
The highest satisfaction was reported for Q5 (overview of 
outstanding tasks), where 69.3% of respondents were 
satisfied. This item has the lowest indifferent rating, 24.8%, 
and the third lowest dissatisfaction rating, 5.8%. In addition, 
functions for Q5, Q3 (overview patients' issues), and Q4 (read 
radiology reports) all have high satisfaction rates, all above 
50%. For Q4, there is no significant change from the baseline 
measurements.  
The lowest satisfaction was measured for Q11 (overview 
drug treatment); only 16.1% of the respondents were satisfied. 
Compared with baseline data, this function has a significant 
decrease in satisfaction. At the same time, this function has 
the highest dissatisfaction rating, 45.3%. Less than 30.0% 
were satisfied with the functions for Q11, Q8 (prescribe 
drugs), and Q9 (plan for treatment and care).  
The function with the highest indifferent rate was Q8, 
61.8%. This function scores low both on satisfaction (9.6%) 
and dissatisfaction (28.7%).  
Three of the functions score are in the mid-range for 
satisfaction, Q6 (communicate with patients), Q7 (advise 
further treatment), and Q10 (assess right to priority health 
care), with satisfaction scores in the range of 40.1% to 49.6%. 
These items also have a low dissatisfaction score (7.5%, 5.1%, 
and 10.2%, respectively) and indifferent scores in the mid-
range (44.8%, 54.7%, and 40.1%, respectively).  
Items Q1 (Read medical reports), Q2 (Compare treatment 
and efficacy), and Q11 show a significant decrease in 
satisfaction. No significant differences were found in EHR 
Function satisfaction among hospitals or user categories. 
EHR Generic satisfaction. Generic satisfaction refers to 
effectiveness, high quality, the worth of time and effort, and 
user-friendliness; overall, 49.6% of respondents were

satisfied; 40.9% were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied; 9.5% 
reported being dissatisfied.  
Generic satisfaction for Quality (G2) was reported as high 
by 57.7%. The other factors have reasonable satisfaction 
rates, between 39.4% and 45.3%. The dissatisfaction is 
highest for Worth the Effort (G3), with 21.3%, while the 
other items have dissatisfaction rates between 10.9% and 
16.1%. All four generic items have a significantly higher 
satisfaction rate in the 2021 survey vs. baseline. No 
significant differences were found in EHR Generic 
satisfaction among hospitals or user categories. 
EHR Overall satisfaction. A single item assessed overall 
satisfaction, where 51.1% of respondents were satisfied, 
30.7% were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, and 18.2% 
reported being dissatisfied. The general satisfaction item has 
a significantly higher satisfaction rate in the 2021 survey vs. 
baseline. No significant differences were found in EHR 
Overall satisfaction among hospitals or user categories. 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
The study evaluated user satisfaction with a new EHR 
system in hospitals in Northern Norway health authorities and 
compared it with a baseline based on the old system. The 
results indicated that many users were either satisfied or 
neutral. Compared to data from the baseline, a significant 
improvement in user satisfaction was observed in the present 
study. One explanation for this change can be that the previous 
system was not perceived as good enough and that the 
difference (e.g., user interface) was enough to improve users' 
satisfaction. On the other hand, it can be interpreted that the 
implementation of the new EHR system was well-planned, the 
process was incremental and that the user was given enough 
training on the new system, hence overcoming a usual barrier 
of implementing a new EHR [1].   
Generic satisfaction (effectiveness, high quality, the worth 
of time and effort, and user-friendliness) looks further into 
some core aspects of usefulness that contribute to the 
satisfaction of the system. The results revealed a positive and 
significant change in generic satisfaction, with a decrease in 
overall dissatisfied users. This study found that the percentage 
of users dissatisfied with the system at the baseline has 
changed positively, shifting from dissatisfaction to either 
satisfaction or neutrality. Quality (G2) had the highest 
reported number of satisfactions, but it also included Worth 
the time effort (G3), which had the highest number of reported 
dissatisfactions. An interpretation of this development is that 
the vendor and the user had experience with the previous EHR 
system, DIPS Classic, which could have contributed to an 
easier transition when implementing DIPS Arena. 
When analyzing specific functions of the EHR system, 
overall improvements in functional satisfaction were 
observed, but some functions still required improvement. The 
functionality related to overview of drug treatment (Q11), 
prescribe drugs (Q8), and care planning (Q9) received the 
lowest satisfaction ratings. The exact reason why these 
functions received low satisfaction is not apparent in the data. 
Still, these are central features of the clinical work, and the 
low satisfaction rating raises concerns for the vendor. 
However, these are complex features that several actors are 
trying to solve, including the government (Shared Digital 
Medication List). Overview of outstanding tasks (Q5), an 
overview of the patient's issues (Q3), and read radiology 
reports (Q4) were the functionality with the highest user 
satisfaction. This finding can be interpreted as the vendors 
having enhanced the new system's design, making it more 
user-friendly and efficient. 
 Also, the data showed a reduction in the frequency of 
system interruptions, such as crashes or hangs, compared to 
the baseline data. This finding can be interpreted that vendors 
have simplified and stabilized the new system. This 
improvement can contribute to higher satisfaction among 
users.     
The results of this study suggest that the new EHR system 
has been well-received by users and has improved user 
satisfaction compared to the previous system. The notion of 
Information Infrastructure and the concept of the installed 
base is confirmed in our results [9]-[11]. The approach of the 
change between EHR systems where parts of the installed 
base have been kept can explain the implementation success. 
The socio-technical ensemble of systems is kept among the 
users, same system vendor, and slow incremental 
implementation process where structure data elements are the 
next implementation step. A further follow-up will be 
necessary for a prolonged conclusion. However, certain 
functions still need further improvements to enhance the 
overall user experience. The findings in this study will support 
the work regarding developing standardized indicators for 
usability in general and user satisfaction in particular. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
In conclusion, the study aimed to assess user satisfaction 
with a new EHR system in Northern Health Authorities and 
compared it to a baseline. The results showed that many users 
were either satisfied or neutral, indicating a significant 
improvement in user satisfaction compared to the baseline 
data. An analysis of generic satisfaction showed positive 
changes in the system's effectiveness, quality, the worth of 
time and effort, and user-friendliness, with a decrease in 
overall dissatisfied users. Although specific functions still 
require improvement, the new EHR system has been well-
received by users. It has improved the overall user 
experience, which is significant considering the many known 
barriers when implanting a new EHR building on the 
theoretical concepts of an Information Infrastructure and the 
installed base. Further research should continue monitoring 
user satisfaction and consider complementing quantitative 
findings with qualitative research for in-depth knowledge of 
why user reports are satisfied.
