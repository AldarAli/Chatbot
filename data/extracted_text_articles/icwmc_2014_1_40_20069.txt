Abstract—This paper deals with an Orthogonal Frequency Di-
vision Multiplexing (OFDM)-based uplink within a Multi User
(MU)-Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) system where a ”mas-
sive MIMO” approach” is adopted. In this context, either
an optimum Minimum Mean-Squared Error (MMSE) linear
detection or a reduced-complexity Matched Filter (MF) linear
detection are considered. Regarding performance evaluation by
simulation, several semi-analytical methods are proposed: one
performance evaluation method in the optimum (MMSE) case;
two performance evaluation methods in the MF case. This
paper includes performance results for uncoded 4-Quadrature
Amplitude Modulation (QAM)/OFDM transmission and a MU-
MIMO channel with uncorrelated Rayleigh fading, under the
assumptions of perfect power control and perfect channel esti-
mation. The accuracy of performance results obtained through
the semi-analytical simulation methods is assessed by means
of parallel conventional Monte Carlo simulations [10]. The
performance results are discussed in detail and we also emphasize
the achievable ”massive MIMO” effects, even for the reduced-
complexity detection techniques, provided that the number of BS
antennas is much higher than the number of antennas which are
jointly employed in the terminals of the multiple autonomous
users.

INTRODUCTION
The development of MIMO technologies has been crucial
for the ”success story” of broadband wireless communications
in the last two decades [1]. Through spatial multiplexing
schemes, following and extending ideas early presented in [2],
MIMO systems are currently able to provide very high band-
width efﬁciencies and a reliable radiotransmission at data rates
beyond 1 Gigabit/s. Appropriate MIMO detection schemes,
offering a range of performance/complexity tradeoffs, have
been essential for the technological improvements in this area
[1][3][4]. In the last decade, MU-MIMO systems have been
successfully implemented and introduced in several broadband
communication standards [5]; in such ”space division mutiple
access” systems, the more antennas the Base Station (BS) is
equipped with, the more users can simultaneously communi-
cate in the same time-frequency resource.
In recent years, the adoption of MU-MIMO systems with
a very large number of antennas in the BS, much larger than
the number of Mobile Terminal (MT) antennas in its cell, was
proposed by Marzetta [6]. This ”massive MIMO” approach
has been shown to be recommendable for several reasons
[6][7][8][9]: simple linear processing for MIMO detection
becomes nearly optimal; both MultiUser Interference (MUI)
effects and fast fading effects of multipath propagation tend
to disappear; both power efﬁciency and bandwidth efﬁciency
become substantially increased.
This paper deals with an OFDM-based uplink within a
MU-MIMO system where the BS is constrained to adopt
simple, linear detection techniques but can be equipped with
a large number of receiver antennas. In this context, either an
optimum (MMSE) linear detection or a reduced-complexity
MF linear detection are considered in Section II. Regarding
performance evaluation by simulation, several semi-analytical
methods are proposed in Section III, all of them combining
simulated channel realizations and analytical computations of
BER performance which are conditional on those channel re-
alizations: one performance evaluation method in the optimum
(MMSE) case; two performance evaluation methods in the MF
case.
In Section IV, this paper includes performance results
for uncoded 4-QAM/OFDM transmission and a MU-MIMO
channel with uncorrelated Rayleigh fading effects regarding
the several transmitter/receiver (TX/RX) antenna pairs, under
the assumptions of perfect power control and perfect channel
estimation. The accuracy of performance results obtained
through the semi-analytical simulation methods is assessed
by means of parallel conventional Monte Carlo simulations
(involving an error counting procedure). The performance
results are discussed in detail and we also emphasize the
achievable ”massive MIMO” effects, even for the reduced-
complexity detection techniques, provided that the number of
BS antennas is much higher than the number of antennas
which are jointly employed in the terminals of the multiple
autonomous users. Section V includes the main conclusions
of the paper.

SYSTEM MODEL
A. OFDM-based Radiotransmission
We consider here a Cyclic Preﬁx (CP)-assisted, OFDM-
based, block transmission, within a MU-MIMO system with
NT TX antennas and NR RX antennas - for example (but not
necessarily) one antenna per MT, as depicted in Figure 1(a).

We assume, in the jth TX antenna (j = 1, 2, ..., NT ), a length-
N block S(j) =

of frequency-domain
data symbols in accordance with the corresponding binary data
block. The insertion of a length-Ls CP, long enough to cope
with the time-dispersive effects of multipath propagation, is
also assumed after the IDFT that is required to bring the data
block information to the time domain.

B. Optimum (MMSE) and MF Linear Detection Techniques
With regard to subcarrier k, two linear detection techniques

domain detector output ˜Yk(k = 0, 1, ..., N − 1).

SEMY-ANALYTICAL METHODS FOR PERFORMANCE
EVALUATION
A. Performance Evaluation Method in the Optimum (MMSE)
Case
The frequency-domain output eYk of the MMSE detector in
Figure 2 (b) includes Gaussian noise and residual MUI terms in
its NT components. Regarding the jth component of eYk, the
resulting Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR) can
be derived by resorting to well-known ”MMSE estimation”
principles. It can be written as
SINRj,k =
Γ(j,j)
k
1 − Γ(j,j)
k

For 4-QAM/OFDM, the resulting BERj,k - conditional on

with SINRj,k according to (8). The average BER for the

B. Performance Evaluation Methods in the MF Case
The NT components of the frequency domain output eYk,
in the MF detector of Figure 2 (a), can be decomposed - into
”useful signal”, MUI and ”Gaussian noise” - as follows:

For 4-QAM/OFDM, the BER computation for the overall
channel realization Hk (k = 0, 1, · · · , N−1) can be performed
in accordance with eqns. (10), (11) and (12), through the use
of SINRj,k given by eqns. (14), (15) and (16).
The second semi-analytical method for performance eval-
uation considers the MUI as it is, and does not necessarily
regard it as a ”quasi-Gaussian interference”. By assuming
σS =

NUMERICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND
DISCUSSION OF MASSIVE MIMO EFFECTS
In the following, we present a set of performance results
for uncoded 4-QAM/OFDM uplink block transmission, with
N = 256 and Ls = 64, within a MU-MIMO NT × NR
Rayleigh fading channel. The fading effects regarding the sev-
eral TX/RX antenna pairs are assumed to be uncorrelated, with
all zero-mean complex Gaussian H(i,j)
k
channel coefﬁcients
having the same variance PΣ (see Section II-A).
Figure 5 and Figure 6 involve subsets of BER performance
curves taken from Figure 3 and Figure 4, respectively: in
both cases, we selected the NT × NR MU-MIMO MF linear
detection and the SIMO 1 × NR (single-path) performance,
for several values of NR. Figure 7 shows BER performance
results, under MF linear detection, for NR = 100 and several
values of NT [SIMO 1×NR (single-path) case also included.].
With regard to both linear detection techniques of Section
II-B, the several performance results concerning the MU-
MIMO system have been obtained by random generation
of a large number of channel realizations, analytical BER
computation - according to the methods of Section III - for
each channel realization, and an averaging operation over
the set of channel realizations. The accuracy of performance
results obtained through these semi-analytical simulation meth-
ods was assessed by means of parallel conventional Monte
Carlo simulations (involving an error counting procedure). As
expected, having in mind the subcarrier-by-subcarrier detection
procedure in the uncoded QAM/OFDM block transmission
context, the achieved performances turned out to be the same
for frequency-ﬂat and frequency-selective fading conditions
(under the assumption of a CP long enough to cope with the
channel time dispersion).

When NR ≫ NT , both the MUI effects and the fading
effects of multipath propagation tend to disappear: conse-
quently, the BER performances for the MU-MIMO NT × NR
Rayleigh fading channel become very close to those concern-
ing a SIMO 1 × NR channel with single-path propagation for
all NR TX/RX antenna pairs. The achievable performances
under a ”truly massive” MU-MIMO implementation can be
analytically derived as explained in the following.

ables with zero mean and variance PΣ. According to the law

MMSE) detection techniques of Section II. In both ﬁgures,
for the sake of comparisons, we include Maximum Likelihood
(ML) detection results concerning the NT × NR system;
we also include SIMO 1 × NR reference performances, for
both the multipath propagation channel - which implies a
Rayleigh fading concerning each TX/RX antenna pair - and an
ideal single-path propagation channel. For the linear detection
techniques, the semi-analytical methods of Section III have
been adopted; the complementary conventional Monte Carlo
simulation (involving error counting) results correspond to the
superposed circles in the solid lines.
Figure 5.
BER performances for OFDM-based MU-MIMO with NT = 2,
and NR = 10, 50 or 100, under MF linear detection [SIMO 1×NR (single-
path) reference performances are also included].
In all ﬁgures, where the 1 × NR (single-path case) SIMO
detection performance was analytically computed according to
(22) - an excellent agreement of the semi-analytical simulation
results with conventional Monte Carlo simulation results can
be observed.
In the simulation results concerning all subﬁgures of both
Figure 3 and Figure 4, the ﬁve BER performance curves
have been shown to be ordered, from the worst to the best,
as follows: NT × NR MU-MIMO with MF linear detection;
NT ×NR MU-MIMO with MMSE linear detection; NT ×NR
MU-MIMO with ML detection; 1×NR (multipath case) SIMO
detection; 1 × NR (single-path case) SIMO detection. These
ﬁgures clearly show that the performance penalty which is
inherent to the reduced-complexity (MF) linear detection -
as compared with the optimum (MMSE) linear detection and
even the optimum (ML) detection - can be made quite small,
by increasing NR signiﬁcantly; they also show that, under
highly increased NR values, the ”MUI-free” SIMO (multipath)
performance and the ultimate bound - the ”MUI-free and
fading-free” SIMO (single-path) performance - can be closely
approximated, even when adopting the reduced-complexity
(MF) linear detection. Figure 5 and Figure 6 emphasize the
performance beneﬁts of an increased NR , for a given NT , and
Figure 6.
BER performances for OFDM-based MU-MIMO with NT = 10,
and NR = 50, 100 or 250, under MF linear detection [SIMO 1 × NR

BER performances for OFDM-based MU-MIMO with NR = 100,
and NT = 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10, under MF linear detection [SIMO 1×NR (single-

Figure 7 emphasizes the more or less acceptable performance
degradation levels which are unavoidable when NR is kept
ﬁxed and NT increases (under the reduced-complexity detec-
tion in all cases). This set of ﬁgures emphasizes a ”massive
MIMO” effect when NR ≫ 1, especially when NR ≫ NT too,
which leads to BER performances very close to the ultimate
”MUI-free and fading-free” SIMO (single-path) performance

CONCLUSIONS
This paper was dedicated to the uplink performance evalu-
ation of a MU-MIMO system with OFDM transmission, when
adopting a large number of antennas and linear detection
techniques at the BS. The accuracy of performance results
obtained by semi-analytical means, as proposed in Section III,
was demonstrated.
The numerical performance results, discussed in detail in
Section IV, show the ”massive MIMO” effects provided by
a number of BS antennas much higher than the number of
antennas which are jointly employed in the terminals of the
multiple autonomous users, even when a reduced-complexity
(MF) linear detection technique is adopted.
