Abstract— There has been signiﬁcant interest and progress in
the ﬁeld of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) in recent years.
Intelligent Transport System (ITS) is the major application of
VANETs. Vehicle-to-vehicle communication is an important fac-
tor for safe driving applications such as blind crossing, prevention
of collisions, and control of trafﬁc ﬂows. These applications
require exchanges of vehicle information such as vehicle position,
cruising speed, direction, and steering angle. Delivery schemes of
vehicle information require high delivery ratio, low latency, and
high scalability. Additionally, large-size vehicles on actual road
environments may interrupt communication between vehicles.
Therefore, adequate vehicles should forward vehicle information
to their neighbor vehicles in delivery of vehicle information. This
paper proposes a new routing protocol for delivery of vehicle
information to neighbor vehicles within a speciﬁed geographical
region. The proposed protocol can deliver new vehicle informa-
tion with short delay by performing temporal limited ﬂooding
before a route construction. Moreover, it can deliver vehicle
information effectively with forwarding by adequate vehicles.
As a result, our scheme can achieve the high delivery ratio of
vehicle information and high scalability. Finally, we assume the
different sizes of vehicles in the computer simulations. Then,
we evaluate the proposed scheme in the more actual wireless
environment. The numerical results show that the proposed
protocol can achieve the high delivery ratio with short delay
even if the communication between standard-size vehicles is
interrupted by the large-size vehicle. Moreover, our protocol has
the high scalability in case of increasing of vehicles.

I. INTRODUCTION
Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are new technology to
integrate the capabilities of new wireless networks to vehicles.
Intelligent Transport System (ITS) is the major application of
VANETs [2], [3], [4]. ITS includes several applications such as
blind crossing, prevention of collisions, control of trafﬁc ﬂows,
trafﬁc monitoring, and nearby information services. These
applications can be divided into two major categories. One
is called safety application, which improves vehicle safety on
the roads. The other is called user application, which provides
value-added services such as internet access and entertainment.
As for safety applications, their speciﬁcation requires low
latency, high delivery ratio, scalability, etc [5], [6]. VANETs
are designed to provide drivers with real-time information
through vehicle-to-infrastructure communication or vehicle-to-
vehicle communication.
The vehicle-to-infrastructure communication is used for
delivering of trafﬁc information, electronic payment of high-
way tolls, internet accesses, entertainment, etc [7]. Vehicles
communicate with many base stations that are equipped along
a road. Therefore, vehicles perform handover of base stations
one after another. The vehicle-to-infrastructure communica-
tion is especially important technology to achieve some user
applications in ITS. Meanwhile, vehicles communicate each
other in the vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Main service
of vehicle-to-vehicle communication is offering vehicle infor-
mation for safety applications.
The vehicle-to-vehicle communication in VANETs has spe-
cial attributes that differentiate it from the other types of
networks such as mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). One of
the main different features between VANETs and MANETs
is related to the behavior of nodes. Vehicles in VANETs are
faster than nodes in conventional MANETs. Moreover, the
mobility patterns of vehicles in VANETs are more restrictive
due to road structures. Therefore, these characteristics are very
effective in most of the previous routing protocols [8].
Finding and maintaining routes has many difﬁculties in the
dynamic behavior of vehicles in VANETs. Routing in VANETs
has been recently studied and a variety of different protocols
were proposed [10]. These protocols can be classiﬁed into ﬁve
categories such as pure ad-hoc routing, position-based routing,
cluster-based routing, broadcast routing, and geocast routing.
VANETs and MANETs share the same principle such as
self-organization, low bandwidth, and short radio transmission
range. Therefore, most ad-hoc routing protocols are still ap-
plicable. Ad-hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) [11] and
dynamic source routing (DSR) [12] are well-known routing
protocols for general purpose mobile ad-hoc networks. These
protocols can reduce overhead in scenarios with a small num-
ber of ﬂows. Meanwhile, VANETs differ from MANETs by
their dynamic change of network topology. The conventional
studies showed that most ad-hoc routing protocols suffer from
highly dynamic nature of vehicle mobility and tend to have
low communication throughput due to poor route management
performance [13].
Vehicle movement in VANETs is usually restricted in just
bidirectional movements constrained along roads and streets
[14]. Position-based routing employs routing strategies that
use geographical information obtained from navigation system

on-board vehicles. Most position-based routing algorithms are
based on forwarding decision upon location information. Some
protocols exchange information of location and each vehicle’s
speed, and select a route with minimum link loss probability
[15], [16], [17]. Additionally, greedy perimeter stateless rout-
ing (GPSR) [18] is one of the well-known protocols. It works
best in a free space scenario. However, direct communication
between vehicles may not exist due to buildings and large-
sized vehicles. Connectivity-aware routing (CAR) protocol
ﬁnds paths between a source vehicle and a destination vehicle,
considering vehicle trafﬁc and movement of vehicles [19].
In cluster-based routing, each cluster can have a cluster
head, which is responsible for intra- and inter-cluster commu-
nication [20]. Vehicles in a cluster communicate with neighbor
vehicles directly. Inter-cluster communication is performed
via the cluster-heads. Many cluster-based routing protocols
have been proposed in MANETs. However, the VANETs
have different features due to constraints on mobility, high
speed movement, and driver behavior. As a result, cluster-
based routing protocols can achieve good scalability for large
networks. But, vehicles suffer from the long delay and the
overhead involved in forming and maintaining clusters in
VANETs [21].
Broadcast routing is frequently used for delivering adver-
tisements and announcements in VANETs. The simplest way
to implement broadcast mechanisms is ﬂooding, in which each
vehicle re-broadcasts packets to all of its neighbors. Flooding
performs relatively well for a small number of vehicles.
However, it suffers from broadcast storm problems when the
number of vehicle in networks increases [22]. Some schemes
for the broadcast storm problems have been proposed in ad hoc
networks [23], [24], [25]. However, the investigation about the
broadcast storm problems is not enough to be considered in
VANETs.
Geocast routing is a location-based multicast routing [26].
Therefore, packets are delivered from a source vehicle to
all other vehicles with a speciﬁed geographical region. The
geocast routing is beneﬁt mechanisms in many applications of
VANETs. For example, a vehicle can detect some problems in
neighbor vehicles to prevent collisions. Most geocast routing
schemes are based on directed ﬂooding. In VANETs, each
vehicle can obtain its own location by using global positioning
system (GPS). Therefore, some researchers have proposed
forwarding techniques that reduce redundant transmission by
using this location information [27], [28].
However, almost all schemes do not consider intercept of
communication by large-size vehicle. In the actual VANETs,
sizes of vehicles are also different. Therefore, VANET routing
protocols should consider the actual communication environ-
ment. Another researcher considers broadcast schemes based
on IEEE 802.11 [29], [30]. In these techniques, adequate
vehicles for forwarding are selected because vehicle positions

are exchanged via some control packets. However, actual
wireless environments in ITS networks are especially severe
from a practical standpoint. For examples, a standard-sized
vehicle comes under an inﬂuence of blocking by large-size
vehicles, and each vehicle suffers from dynamic ﬂuctuation
of signal intensity by moving so fast. In these environments,
a distance can not be appropriate criteria for selection of
forwarder vehicles.
We have proposed a simple delivery scheme for vehicle
information [1]. In this paper, we evaluate packet delivery
ratio and transmission delay. One characteristic of our scheme
is utilizing vehicle information messages (VIMs) themselves
for route construction. At ﬁrst phase, all vehicles forward all
vehicle information messages on a temporary basis. Therefore,
delivery of new vehicle information can be achieved with
short delay. This characteristic will be especially important to
achieve blind crossing and prevention of collisions The reason
for this is that almost all routing protocols require several pe-
riods to construct routes, and these route construction periods
will have big overhead to reduce the delay for recognizing
each vehicle. At second phase, each vehicle selects an adequate
forwarder vehicle for its vehicle information forwarding. As a
result, the number of forwarded vehicle information messages
can be reduced to solve broadcast storm problems. This
characteristic is an important factor to achieve high scalability
with increasing of vehicles. Finally, our scheme utilizes vehicle
information instead of hello messages to maintain routes.
Consequently, our scheme can check a link status between
neighbor vehicles without any control messages, and the
number of control messages can be also reduced. We assume
the different sizes of vehicles in the computer simulations.
Then, we evaluate the proposed scheme in the more actual
wireless environment. The numerical results show that the
proposed scheme can achieve the high delivery ratio with short
delivery delay.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
A purpose of this paper is to achieve a vehicle-to-vehicle
communication scheme, which delivers vehicle information
within a speciﬁed geographical region. Figure 1 is a di-
agrammatic illustration of vehicle information delivery for
safety applications in VANETs. We assume that each vehicle
transmits its vehicle information message as a source vehicle

periodically. But, we focus our attention on routes to neighbor
vehicles from a source vehicle in Fig. 1. Vehicles SV 2 and
LV 2 are forwarder vehicles for their neighbor vehicles. Our
protocol can support a mixed environment of standard-sized
and large-size vehicles. A vehicle information message is
delivered to some vehicles in a limited area. The limited area
is deﬁned as the delivery distance, and is determined as a
ﬁxed value beforehand. Our scheme can be implemented in a
bidirectional road environment by using directional informa-
tion of vehicles. However, we assume a one-way road in the
explanation for simplicity.
In the proposed protocol, three types of control messages
are introduced to deliver vehicle information messages; a
Forwarding Request Message (FRM), a Forwarder Search
Message (FSM), and a Forwarding Abort Message (FAM). The
FRM is transmitted when vehicles request neighbor vehicles
to activate forwarding function. The FSM is transmitted when
vehicles detect link losses. The FAM is transmitted when a
distance between a vehicle and its source vehicle is longer than
its delivery distance. These example procedures are shown in
Figures 2, 3 and 4.
Almost all routing protocols require periodic transmission
of control packets because adequate routes may be changed
due to moving of vehicles. On the contrary, each vehicle does
not transmit the control packets periodically in the proposed
protocol. In order to recognize neighbor vehicles, each vehicle
uses vehicle information messages as substitutes for special
control packets like hello messages. As a result, control
messages are only transmitted when vehicles lose links to
neighbor vehicles or change links to other neighbor vehicles.
Therefore, our protocol can reduce the number of transmitted
control messages.
Table I shows the components of the routing table. In the
proposed scheme, the routing table in Table I is constructed
for each source vehicle. In the assumed ITS networks, vehicle

information is delivered in a limited area near a source vehicle.
Therefore, our assumed application is one of multicast applica-
tion types and the proposed protocol is one of geocast routing
protocols. As a result, each source vehicle has a receiver group
for vehicle information. In the proposed protocol, the source
vehicle ID is used for determining the receiver group for the
source vehicle. The source vehicle position is used to detect the
delivery area. The ﬁnal received time of vehicle information
is used to remove the routing information if the vehicle does
not receive the vehicle information for a long time. The
forwarder’s vehicle ID is used to maintain its own forwarder
vehicle information. The forwarding requested vehicles IDs
are an ID list of vehicles, which transmit a Forwarding Request
Message to its own vehicle. If this list has some vehicle IDs,
the vehicle should forward vehicle information from the source
vehicle. The forwarding requested vehicle positions are lists
of positions for forwarding requested vehicles. These lists are
used to ﬁnd vehicles that exist outside of delivery area of the
source vehicle.
Figure 5 is example routing information of large-size vehicle
2. The LV2 has constructed a route to the SV3 and has been
requested to forward vehicle information of the SV2 by the
SV5 and the SV6. Therefore, the forwarder’s vehicle ID of
LV2 is the SV3, and the forwarding requested vehicles IDs
are SV5 and SV6.
Figure 6 shows a ﬂow chart of the proposed routing scheme.
In this ﬂow chart, a source vehicle S transmits a vehicle
information message periodically, and a forwarder vehicle F
forwards the vehicle information message from the vehicle S.
Finally, a destination vehicle D receives it.

A. Forwarding Procedures
When a vehicle receives new vehicle information messages
from neighbor vehicles, two procedures will be performed.
The ﬁrst one is forwarding procedures and the second one is
forwarding request procedures. In the forwarding procedures,
vehicles forward the received vehicle information message to
neighbor vehicles. The procedures are described as follows.
1) The vehicle calculates a distance between a previous hop
vehicle and itself.
2) The vehicle calculates a forwarding delay period accord-
ing to the distance in order to set priorities of forwarding.
The delay period is set to a short time when the distance
is long. On the contrary, the delay period is set to a
long time when the distance is short. This is because the

number of hops can be reduced if the distance is long. In
the proposed procedures, every vehicle forward vehicle
information with prioritized delay on a temporary basis.
Therefore, the proposed scheme is tolerant of vehicle
movement.
3) The vehicle sets a forwarding delay period that is related
to the distance.
4) The vehicle forwards the received vehicle information
message with this forwarding delay period.
B. Forwarding Request Procedures
In the forwarding request procedures, vehicles request to
forward vehicle information messages to neighbor vehicles.
Procedures are described as follows.
1) The vehicle calculates the distance between the source
vehicle of the vehicle information message and itself.
2) The vehicle checks the routing table to ﬁnd the source
vehicle ID within the vehicle information message when
the distance is shorter than the delivery distance.
3) The vehicle adds the vehicle ID and a position of the
source vehicle into the routing table when the source
vehicle ID cannot be found in the routing table.
4) The vehicle requests the previous hop vehicle as a
forwarder vehicle for itself by transmitting a Forwarding
Request Message (FRM).
5) The neighbor vehicle that receives the FRM adds a
vehicle ID and a vehicle position of the requesting
vehicle.
6) The neighbor vehicle starts forwarding of vehicle infor-
mation messages to the requesting vehicle.
Figure 2 is an example procedure when the vehicles SV 4
and SV 5 transmit FRMs. In this ﬁgure, the vehicle SV 6 does
not transmit a FRM because it exists outside of delivery area
of the source vehicle SV 0. Finally, the vehicle LV 2 starts
forwarding of new vehicle information messages.
C. Forwarder Search Procedures
Following procedures are performed when the distance
between a forwarder vehicle and itself becomes longer than a
threshold.
1) The vehicle tries to ﬁnd another vehicle as a forwarder
vehicle because the current forwarder vehicle is far from
itself.
2) The vehicle transmits a Forwarder Search Message
(FSM) to neighbor vehicles.
3) The neighbor vehicles activate each forwarding function
of vehicle information messages if each distance be-
tween the vehicle transmitting the FSM and themselves
is shorter than the threshold.
4) The neighbor vehicles start forwarding their vehicle
information messages for a while. The maximum re-
transmission time of vehicle information messages is set
to a counter for the temporal forwarding.
5) The vehicle transmits a new FRM to an adequate vehicle
of its neighbor vehicles when it receives a new vehicle
information message from them.
Figure 3 is an example procedure when the vehicle SV 5
transmits a FSM because the distance between the LV 2 and
the SV 5 is longer than the threshold. In this ﬁgure, the vehicle
SV 4 activates the temporal forwarding procedures for the
SV 5. Hence, the vehicle SV 5 will transmit a FRM to the
vehicle SV 4.
D. Forwarding Abort Procedures
Following procedures are performed when vehicles move to
outside of the delivery area of their source vehicle
1) The vehicle transmits a Forwarding Abort Message
(FAM) to its forwarder vehicle.
2) The forwarder vehicle removes the forwarding informa-
tion for it from the routing table.
Figure 4 is an example procedure when the vehicle SV 5
moves to outside of the delivery area, and transmits a FAM
to the vehicle SV 4. The vehicle SV 4 will inactivate the
forwarding procedures for the vehicle SV 5.
III. EXAMPLE OPERATIONS
In the proposed scheme, each vehicle starts to construct a
route by receiving a new vehicle information. In this section,
we explain example operations of the proposed scheme with
the vehicle layout in Fig. 7. Figure 8 shows an example of
packet transmission in this situation. In the example, each
vehicle is assumed to deliver vehicle information within radius
R.
In Fig. 7, the vehicle V1 is regarded as a source vehicle.
The vehicles V2, V3, V4, and V5 exist in the area where the
vehicle information of the vehicle V1 can be delivered. The
vehicle V1 transmits the vehicle information messages (VIMs)
periodically. The neighbor vehicles V2 and V3 register the
new vehicle V1 by checking each routing table. Then, each
vehicle calculates a forwarding delay according to relative
position to the source vehicle V1. The vehicle V3 sets a shorter
delay than the vehicle V2 because the relative position to
V3 is longer than that of V2. This procedure reduces the
hop count for vehicle information delivery. Then, vehicles V4
and V5, which receive the vehicle information forwarded by

the vehicle V3, transmit each Forwarding Request Message
to request vehicle information forwarding. The vehicle V3
registers the forwarding requested vehicle IDs and positions
when it receives the Forwarding Request Messages. Finally,
the vehicle V3 constructs a route to the vehicle V4 and the
vehicle V5 from the vehicle V1.
A. Route construction for new vehicles
Each vehicle transmits its own vehicle information period-
ically. Therefore, vehicles can ﬁnd that a neighbor vehicle
moves into delivery area of their souce vehicle. Figure 9 shows
an example that the vehicle V6 moves into the delivery area of
the vehicle V1. An example for packet transmission is shown
in Fig. 10.
In Fig. 9, vehicles V4 and V5 can ﬁnd the position of
the vehicle V6 because these vehicles exchange the vehicle
information each other. Moreover, the vehicles V4 and V5 can
ﬁnd that the vehicle V6 moves to the delivery are of the vehicle
V1 because they know the positions of the vehicles V1 and V6.
The vehicles V4 and V5 start to forward the vehicle infor-
mation from the vehicle V1 when they ﬁnd that the vehicle V6
moves to the delivery area of the vehicle V1. Consequently,
the vehicle V6 will be able to receive the vehicle information

vehicle V6 constructs a route by requesting vehicle information
forwarding.
B. Route modiﬁcation for moved vehicles
Vehicles can recognize neighbor vehicles by exchanging
vehicle information each other. Therefore, a forwarding re-
quested vehicle can start to ﬁnd the next neighbor vehicles if
it cannot communicate with the forwarder vehicle. Figure 11
shows that the vehicle V5 moves to the outer area of the vehicle
information delivery area of the vehicle V3. An example for
packet transmission is shown in Fig. 12.
In the Fig. 11, the vehicle V5 ﬁnds that the route through
the vehicle V3 becomes invalid by checking the vehicle infor-
mation from the vehicle V3. Then, it broadcasts the Forwarder
Search Message to neighbor vehicles. The vehicle V4, which
receives the Forwarder Search Message from the vehicle V5,
starts the temporary forwarding of the vehicle information.
Finally, the vehicle V5 can ﬁnd the new route through the
vehicle V4.

C. Route discard for moved vehicles
In the proposed scheme, two procedures for route discard
are considered. The ﬁrst is used in a situation that vehicles
in a certain delivery area cannot receive any information of a
vehicle, which were in the area, and they cannot recognize it
any more. The second is used in a situation that vehicles in
a certain delivery area can receive information of a vehicle
and can recognize it, but it is moving out to the area. In
the situations, they discards the routes in their own routing
table. Figure 13 shows an example that the vehicle V5 moves
to the outer area of the vehicle information delivery area
of the vehicle V1. Figure 14 shows an example for packet
transmission in this situation.
The vehicle V5 uses the route through the vehicle V4 in Fig.
13. It transmits a Forwarding Abort Message to the vehicle V4
if it exists in the outer area of delivery area for a given length
of time. Finally, the vehicle V4 stops vehicle information
forwarding and removes the route for the vehicle V5.
IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

we performed computer simulations with network simulator

simulation software that considers the more actual wireless en-
vironment. Therefore, packet errors are handled as the packet
error ratio according to the received signal-to-interference and
noise power ratio (SINR). Each results shows an average of
10 trials of simulation. Our proposed protocol is one of the
information delivery schemes by broadcast communication. It
is known that broadcast communication suffers from packet
collisions when many vehicles exist in a communication area.
Therefore, we considered 50 vehicles for small number of
vehicles and 200 vehicles for large number of vehicles. We
assumed that a road shape is a loop line with a radius equals
to 1500 [m] and 2 lanes. Each vehicle is located randomly on
the road, selecting the velocity between 90 [km/h] and 110
[km/h] randomly. Therefore, a distribution of vehicle velocity
is uniformly between 90 [km/h] and 110 [km/h] The vehicle
runs on the inside lane principally and keeps an inter-vehicular
distance as 100 [m]. If there is no vehicle on the outside lane,
the vehicle moves to the outside lane from the inside lane
to overtake a forward vehicle. After overtaking, the vehicle
moves to the inside lane if there is no vehicle on the inside

the number of vehicle is 50, and about 150 times of passing
occur when the number of vehicle is 200. Finally, the feature
of this paper is to consider the effect of large-size vehicles.
So, we deﬁne the large-size vehicle ratio that means the ratio
of the large-size vehicles and the standard-size vehicles. When
the large-size vehicle ratio is set to 0, all vehicles are standard-
size vehicles.
As the wireless propagation model, we used a two ray prop-
agation model. Moreover, we consider blocking effects due
to large-size vehicles. So, we assumed that large-size vehicles
are rectangular solids. If a rectangular solid is overlapped with
the straight line between two standard-size vehicles, these two
vehicles cannot communicate due to blocking.
The ﬁnal purpose of this study is to fuse vehicle information
delivery and communication networks for several network
applications. Therefore, we employ IEEE 802.11b for a com-
mon comunication device. In the simulations, the transmission
range is about 500 [m], packet errors are determined due
to the received signal-to-interference and noise power ratio
(SINR). Our packet error model can consider packet collisions
and noises. The size of a vehicle information message is 100
[Byte], and is transmitted with 4 [packets/s]. The delivery area
of vehicle information messages is assumed to be 1000 [m].
Our protocol is one of the broadcast communication meth-
ods. Therefore, we employ the probabilistic ﬂooding scheme
for comparison. The ﬂooding probability is assumed to be 0,
25, 50, 75, 100 [%]. Simulation parameters are shown in detail
in Table II.
Figure 15 shows the delivery ratio of vehicle information
messages with 50 vehicles. In this study, we deﬁne that the
delivery ratio is the message received ratio for vehicles in the
delivery area. From results, we can ﬁnd that our proposed
protocol can achieve the highest delivery ratio. The delivery
ratio of the probabilistic ﬂooding scheme degrades when the

ﬂooding probability decreases. This is because several vehicles
are required to forward vehicle information messages when
there are a small number of vehicles on the road. Moreover,
the delivery ratio of all schemes degrades when the large-size
vehicle ratio increases. Especially, it degrades much when the
value of the ﬂooding probability is set low. The reason for
this is that large-size vehicles block communications between
standard-size vehicles. So, more vehicles should be required
to forward vehicle information messages.
Figure 16 shows the delivery ratio of vehicle information
messages with 200 vehicles. From results, our proposed pro-
tocol can keep the highest delivery ratio. But, the delivery
ratio of the ﬂooding scheme degrades. This is because the
ﬂooding schemes suffer from broadcast storm problems. We
can ﬁnd that some ﬂooding schemes can achieve good delivery
ratio. However, the optimum ﬂooding probability is also
changeable depending on situation change. So, it is difﬁcult to
select the optimum ﬂooding probability in the actual system.

Incidentally, the delivery ratio of the proposed protocol can
achieve high performance even if the large-size vehicle ratio is
changed because each vehicle selects an optimum vehicle as its
forwarder vehicle in the proposed protocol. In the conventional
research, the objective packet delivery ratio is assumed to
be 90 [%]. In the broadcast communication, packets may be
corrupted due to hidden terminal problems. Therefore, it is
difﬁcult to achieve high delivery ratio when special media
access control (MAC) method is not employed. In our delivery
ratio, we evaluate packet delivery ratios at all receiver vehicles.
Therefore, we think that our protocol can be used for the actual
environments by employing the Forward Error Correction
(FEC).
Figure 17 shows the number of forwarded vehicle informa-
tion in the delivery area with 50 vehicles. From results, we
can ﬁnd that the ﬂooding schemes require several times of
forwarding. Therefore, the ﬂooding schemes can achieve high
delivery performance. However, these excess forwarding are

unreasonable from the viewpoint of the wireless resource. The
probabilistic ﬂooding can decrease the number of forwarding.
But, the delivery ratio is also degraded. On the contrary,
our proposed protocol requires small number of forwarding
like the probabilistic ﬂooding with 25 [%]. However, the
proposed protocol can achieve the high delivery ratio like the
full ﬂooding scheme. Therefore, our protocol is a reasonable
scheme from the viewpoint of wireless resources.
Figure 18 shows the number of forwarded vehicle informa-
tion in the delivery area with 200 vehicles. From results, the
performance of the probabilistic ﬂooding with 25 [%] keeps
small number of forwarded vehicle information messages.
However, the delivery ratio of the probabilistic ﬂooding with
25 [%] degrades due to blocking by large-size vehicles. This is
because it is difﬁcult to forward vehicle information message
appropriately when the ﬂooding probability decreases. Mean-
while, the proposed protocol can keep the smallest number
of forwarded vehicle information messages. Moreover, the

performance of the proposed protocol achieves a stable de-
livery ratio and a stable forwarding performance because each
vehicle selects its forwarder vehicle by considering blocking
due to large-size vehicles.
Figure 19 shows the delay performance with 50 vehicles.
The delay period starts when a source vehicle transmits
a vehicle information message, and ends when the vehicle
information message is received at all vehicles in the delivery
area. Therefore, the accurate delay of each vehicle is different
due to the positions of the vehicles. So, the delay performance
averages delays of all vehicles in the delivery area. From
results, the delay performance of the proposed protocol is
a little shorter than that of the full ﬂooding scheme. The
delay performance of all schemes increases when the large-
size vehicle ratio increases. The reason for this is that blocking
by the large-size vehicles causes degradation of the actual
transmission range. Therefore, more forwarder vehicles are
required to transmit the vehicle information messages.
Figure 20 shows the delay performance with 200 vehicles.
From results, the delay performance of the proposed proto-
col can keep short values when the large-size vehicle ratio
changes. On the contrary, the ﬂooding schemes have especially
long delay when the large-size vehicle ratio equals to 0 or 100
[%]. The actual transmission range becomes long when there is
no effect of blocking due to the large-size vehicles. Therefore,
broadcast storm problems occur.
Figure 21 shows the delay performance of standard-size and
large-size vehicles in the proposed protocol. This kind of delay
is required to transmit vehicle information in MAC layer. From
results, we can ﬁnd that delays of large-size vehicles decrease
according to increasing of the large-size vehicle ratio because
large-size vehicles block communications between standard-
size vehicles and the number of vehicles in a certain communi-
cation area also decreases. Therefore, each vehicle can obtain
more opportunities to transmit vehicle information. On the

contrary, the delay performance of large-size vehicles is also
constant. This is because large-size vehicles can communicate
with standard-size vehicles and large-size vehicles. Moreover,
these communication are not blocked. Then, the number of
vehicles sharing the same communication is also increasing.
As a result, it is difﬁcult for large-size vehicles to obtain
opportunities to transmit vehicle information.
Figure 22 shows the delivery ratio of vehicle information
with a large-size vehicle ratio equals to 40 [%] and 200
vehicles. From results, the performance of the all ﬂooding
mechanisms degraded according to increasing in the number
of vehicles. The reason for this is that it is difﬁcult to select
adequate forwarding vehicles in the situation the large-size
vehicle ratio equals to 40 [%]. Meanwhile, the proposed
protocol has good scalability performance. The scalability is
one of the most important factor in ITS. This is because
the proposed protocol is especially simple and only a few
control messages are exchanged when a vehicle joins certain
networks, it changes its forwarding vehicle and drops out
the networks. Moreover, the proposed protocol can select an
adequate forwarding vehicle, and improve effectiveness of
channel resource.
Figure 23 shows the number of forwarded vehicle informa-
tion with a large-size vehicle ratio equals to 40 [%] and 200
vehicles. From results, we can ﬁnd that the proposed protocol
can keep a small number of forwarded vehicle information.
However, the performance of the proposed protocol is little
larger than that of the probabilistic ﬂooding with P = 25
[%] because the proposed protocol can select the forwarding
vehicles. Therefore, more vehicles are selected as a forward-
ing vehicle when large-size vehicles blocks communication
between standard-size vehicles.
Figure 24 shows the delay performance with a large-size
vehicle ratio equals to 40 [%] and 200 vehicles. From results,
the delay performance degrades according to increasing in the

ﬂooding probability. This is because broadcast storms occur
and it is difﬁcult for almost all vehicles to transmit vehicle
information. On the contrary, the proposed protocol can keep
the short delay even if the number of vehicle increases.
Figure 25 shows the continuous drop ratio of vehicle
information with a large-size vehicle ratio equals to 40 [%]
and 200 vehicles. The continuous drop ratio means the ratio
that the vehicle cannot receive the vehicle information contin-
uously. The continuous drops of vehicle information are not
suited characteristics for ITS communication because these
drops cause temporal interruption of communication between
neighbor vehicles. From results, we can ﬁnd that the proposed
protocol has good tolerance to burst packet losses.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed a new routing protocol
for delivery of vehicle information to neighbor vehicles in a
speciﬁc area. The proposed protocol can deliver new vehicle
information with short delay by performing temporal limited
ﬂooding before a construction of routes. Moreover, it can

deliver vehicle information effectively with forwarding by an
adequate vehicle. The feature of the protocol is utilizing a
vehicle information message itself to detect each vehicle sta-
tus. Moreover, our protocol can be extended for a bidirectional
road by using directional information. As a result, our protocol
does not require periodic transmission of control messages. In
addition, we have evaluated an environment with the mixed
factor of standard-size and large-size vehicles. In the actual
environment, it is important to support this mixed factor for
real safe driving systems. Finally, we can ﬁnd that our protocol
can achieve the high delivery ratio with short delay even if
large-size vehicles inﬂuence the communication. Moreover, we
can provide required quality in communications if we employ
the forward error correction (FEC) to recover the packet loss.
Considering all these results mentioned above, the proposed
method could be one of the fundamental schemes for achieving
ITS.
VI. FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we evaluated the performance with two sizes
of vehicles in additive white gaussian noise (AWGN) envi-
ronment. Therefore, our evaluation can assume more actual
vehicle conditions and wireless communication environment.
However, multi-path fading is also signiﬁcant degradation
factor in city environment. Then, it is important to handle
the dynamic ﬂuctuation of wireless channel. Moreover, the
proposed scheme was evaluated with the IEEE 802.11b sys-
tem. Therefore, it is not difﬁcult to implement on embedded
system with IEEE 802.11 device. Authors has a schedule to
implement the proposed scheme on a Linux router board with
a mini-PCI IEEE 802.11device.
