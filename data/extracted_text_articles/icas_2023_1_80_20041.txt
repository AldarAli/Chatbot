Abstract— The land transport sector has passed through 
multiple phases 
of 
evolution 
in 
design, 
development, 
manufacturing of vehicles. In particular, the construction site 
continues to progress towards the autonomous vehicles (also 
called self-driving), which were one of its big trends and have 
become a hot topic in the industrial and academic world. By 
now, with this new technology of autonomous driving, we can 
ensure the safety by reducing the number of road accident, also 
the environmental impact and energy consumption is lessened. 
The modeling and simulation phases had become a mandatory 
step to design, characterize and simulate vehicle dynamics while 
reducing the cost of development. As they provide suitable test 
beds for the design and evaluation, the impetus of this study is 
to implement a model of a METALLIANCE’s industrial 
Electric Vehicle based on Matlab/Simulink, that will be close to 
the reality. The model is implemented based on electrical 
equations associated with the power supply circuit. The model 
defines for real time the evaluation of various electric 
parameters in safe vehicle operation for these vehicles. This 
work will be completed by the design of a full simulator, which 
reproduces reliably the dynamic behavior of Métalliance 
construction vehicles. 
Keywords- Electric system modeling; Vehicle dynamics; 
Construction Machinery; Traction and Suspension control. 
I.  INTRODUCTION  
The automotive and transportation industry are in 
perpetual evolution towards autonomous and electric vehicle 
(AEV), also known as automated car. It is seen as the 
important future technologies that will change the paradigm 
of mobility and facilities construction industry operations [1]. 
The Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) is a system 
concept that can do driving maneuvers and tasks by itself, 
without human intervention, and communicate with its 
occupants and with external elements. The realization of this 
type of vehicle release humans from the driving task, reduce 
energy consumption, CO2 and pollutant emissions, and 
environmental impact. In addition, the autonomous car can 
improve safety by minimizing and preventing as possible the 
number of road accidents caused by the driver carelessness 
(most accidents are caused by human errors). But until now, 
replacing human driver with an autonomous driver is not 
guaranteed to avoid all problems. As the automated driving 
can impact positively the road traffic, it can also have a 
negative impact. Many works can be taken in order to 
minimize the negative externalities arising from automated 
driving [2]. 
The future of autonomous vehicle is in progress to be 
electric in order to have a complete vehicle which take the 
advantages of both autonomous vehicle and electric vehicle 
(EV) such as environmental benefits (C02 emissions and 
environmental pollution) and energy efficiency [3]. The 
combination of the EV and AV could facilitate automatically 
the charging when the Stage of charge is in short supply and 
prove the best scan and analysis of the environment by its 
artificial intelligence system to avoid any kind of collision 
with static or dynamic objects. 
The wider application of AEV requires various real time 
vehicle operating tests under certain driving scenarios in order 
to determine if requirements are met for design. This process 
of development justifies the high cost and the long time taken 
to produce the final product. For that reason, modeling and 
simulation are becoming an important tool in solving this kind 
of problem and are considered as the best solution to 
dimension all components and achieve the best energy control 
strategy. 
Vehicle modeling was invented to facilitate every kind of 
parameter 
change 
and 
analyze 
several 
powertrain 
configurations in a computer model before building the 
vehicle prototype. Thus, it can allow the final product to be 
well built and faster while reducing cost. Also, it is easy to 
engineers to examine the performance and energy aspects of 
vehicle powertrain configuration from a computer-based 
model than swapping motors in a real vehicle prototype.  
This research is part of the Simulation of Autonomous 
Vehicle “SIMVA-2 “project funded by the French « France 
relaunch » plan. It is a bipartite link between the DRIVE 
laboratory and the METALLIANCE, company, which is

intended to develop a simulator for an autonomous vehicle 
with an application to the confined industrial environment, in 
which the company's construction machinery operates. The 
objectives of this research project are to provide solutions for 
partial or total driving delegation   of a construction vehicle in 
a controlled indoor environment, predict the physical behavior 
(electrical, thermal, etc.) of the various parts of the vehicle 
(engine, battery, perception/vision systems, etc.) and Train 
driver of this new mode of material transport. 
Métalliance, a company specialized in the design of 
mobile machinery required for tunnel construction, designs, 
industrializes, manufactures, and markets mobile machinery 
used for the construction and renovation of tunnels. It has 
recently turned its attention to make its machines totally 
autonomous. Therefore, both modeling and simulation are 
obligatory required to design, characterize, and simulate the 
behavior of its mobile machinery on an industrial construction 
site, while reducing costs in the development phase. The aim 
of this study is to implement a METALLIANCE's electric 
vehicle model based on Matlab/Simulink that will be used to 
create a complete vehicle model. Create a vehicle model is 
then followed by simulation, an autonomous vehicle simulator 
will be built, which constitutes an easily accessible tool that 
represents artificially the real operation of Métalliance self-
driving cars. This simulator allows reproducing in a more 
reliable way the dynamic behavior of these machines in their 
real environment with a huge number of scenarios, system 
configurations and driver characteristics.  
This paper is divided into five parts. Section II outlines a 
brief introduction of electric vehicles and several electrical 
models existing in the literature. Section III presents the 
industrial environment of our case study: the characteristics of 
Métalliance mobile machinery and their ODDs (Operational 
Design Domain). Section IV constitutes a literature review of 
all steps followed to describe the dynamic behavior of a 
system in the form of a model. Whilst, the Section V 
introduces the vehicle system modeling based on Matlab/ 
Simulink, the validation on a real profile and the behavioral 
analysis. The present work ends with conclusion and Outlook. 
 
II.  LITERATURE ON ELECTRIC VEHICLE MODELS 
A wide waste of energy and air pollution was resulted 
using construction machinery and influenced the health of 
humans and other human beings. Thus, to solve this problem, 
it is required increasing fuel efficiency and minimizing fuel 
consumption. The novel technology “Electric vehicle (EV)” 
allows both reducing air polluting and noisy mobility.  The 
control of the torque and the speed through motor control was 
achieved by several electronics components such as transistor. 
In the literature, several electrical construction vehicle 
models have been proposed to evaluate the vehicle energy 
consumption, examine the impact of different factors 
influencing the energy consumption and enhance the vehicle 
efficiency [4].  Most of these models was numerical models 
which are used most of the time in the first stages of the design 
process. The aim of these stages design of an energy efficient 
vehicle is to evaluate all parameters affecting the energy 
requirement based on a sensitivity analysis. 
In [5], a Model-based optimization of an electric vehicle 
has been developed in Simulink environment. It was used to 
determine an optimization driving strategy aimed at reducing 
energy consumption while driving (prototype electric car that 
has been designed for the Shell Eco-marathon). In this case, 
genetic optimization algorithm was used. The model includes 
the vehicle, the electric motor, and the motor controller, the 
simulation was compared to the real measurements and the 
results has shown the similar optimized model to the real 
world. In this wise, a full efficiency of electro-mechanical 
power system is treated. Nevertheless, each change, like way 
of the route modeling or the driving conditions modeling, 
applied in on of electro-mechanical power subsystems must 
be experimentally evaluated. Also, the driver control system 
is considered in this model which has as inputs the reference 
vehicle speed or the accelerator activation. 
In [6], a model optimization of the powertrain design has 
been developed. The system was applicated for the 
development of fuel cell electric vehicles which were vehicles 
with three wheels use a carbon-fiber monocoque pushed by a 
hydrogen fuel cell with a DC electric motor. In the model, the 
vehicle, and its subsystems (fuel cell, uphill climbing, electric 
motor, tires rolling resistances, aerodynamic drag, etc.) are 
simulated in AMESim and the dynamic behavior of the 
vehicle was analyzed. An optimization algorithm was 
employed to find the optimal driving strategy leading to least 
fuel consumption. The model was validated by the 
comparison of simulation results to results obtained on the 
track during the competition (Shell Eco Marathon 
competition). 
In [7] The paper describes a numerical modeling of the 
vehicle powertrain; a vehicle takes part in the Shell Eco-
marathon competition. The model includes the vehicle motion 
and the fuel consumption, it was validated using real 
measurements.  An optimization strategy was employed 
leading to low fuel consumption. 
A Multiphysics dynamical model of a fuel cell vehicle-
based power train (urban-concept vehicle used for energetic 
races) has been developed in [8]. The modeling encompassed 
several vehicle behaviors such as the losses and consumptions 
of the power in each train devices, mechanical requirement, 
thermal behavior of fuel cell, etc… A global optimization 
algorithm has been integrated to the model in order to find out 
the best driving optimization according to the road constraints. 
The simulation results are compared and validated with 
experimental measurements (real results obtained at the Shell 
Eco-Marathon competition). 
In the view of the METALLIANCE’s machines 
complexity (two or three vehicle module), no previous 
modeling of industrial electric vehicles has been done before. 
Also, none previous established results in modeling defined 
the validation of all inputs/outputs is made of electrical 
modeling vehicle before. 
 
III. MODEL DEVELOPMENT STEPS 
Models are usually primarily defined in the scientific 
literature as a simplified representation of a real-world 
phenomenon. The model is highly close to the real-world

vehicle system but it is simpler than the system it represents. 
The purpose of producing model is to enable the analyst to 
predict the dynamic behavior of any kind of   system, to be a 
close approximation to the real world and incorporate most of 
its salient features. The steps involved in developing a model, 
used to design a powerful simulation are [9]: 
• 
Identify the problem: Before proceeding with the 
modeling of a proposed vehicle system, it is necessary 
to define the inputs, the corresponding outputs, the 
temporal 
and 
spatial 
constraints, 
the 
traffic 
conditions, the stochastic elements, the study 
objectives, etc. 
• 
Formulate the problem: Select the bounds of the 
system, the traffic conditions, the environment 
conditions, the control rules, and the security 
constraints. The purpose of this step is to define 
performance measures and quantitative criteria based 
on different system configurations. At this stage, 
formulate 
briefly 
hypotheses 
about 
system 
performance. Hence, Problems must be formulated as 
precisely as possible and specific outputs are defined 
for each problem. 
• 
Collect and process real system data: Collect data 
on system specifications inputs variables. Generally, 
sensors are installed on the system and permanently 
record information about its environment, perception 
and data fusion algorithms are then used to extract 
useful information. 
• 
Formulate and develop a model: Develop network 
diagram of the system based on the relationships that 
connect the different outputs to the different inputs. 
• 
Simulate and validate model:   Once the previous 
steps are checked and validated, all that remains is the 
simulation of the model from the real data and ensures 
that the model achieves the expected results. At this 
level, it is required to vary different input parameters 
over their acceptable range and checking the output in 
order to verify that the simulation model executes as 
intended by comparing its performance with the 
performance of the real system. 
 
In the physical sciences, models are defined from 
mathematical 
tools 
(differential 
equations, 
recurrent 
equations, or partial differential equations), physical tools 
(generally used for vehicle systems) or computer tools (tools 
derived formalisms of AI (Artificial Intelligence)). In the case 
of our study, the electrical model was developed with extreme 
accuracy for every element based on different physical tools 
(mechanical block, thermal block, power electronic, 
electrochemical 
block, 
electric 
energy 
storage.  
 
IV. INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENT AND OPERATIONAL 
DESIGN DOMAIN SYSTEM 
 In this paper, electrical modeling was applied to an 
industrial environment: vehicles developed by the company 
Métalliance. These latter designs two types of vehicles: the 
Multi Service Vehicles (MSV) or Train on Wheels vehicles, 
that meet specific specifications These vehicles are used to 
transport the concrete elements required for the construction 
of tunnel. The Train on Wheels vehicle has a leading vehicle 
and a trailing vehicle each with a driver cabin to facilitate the 
reversible operation without having to make a U-turn in small 
space. Both the leading and the trailing vehicles are of self-
propelled type and can be used according to the required 
direction of travel at the same time. However, The Multi-
Service Vehicle is a non-articulated vehicle with only one 
vehicle. Like the train on wheels vehicle the MSV is also 
designed to facilitate reversible operation. The vehicles 
currently used by METALLIANCE are available in three 
variants with respect to the power source used by the vehicles. 
The vehicles can operate on a diesel engine, a hybrid between 
diesel and an electrical engine or a completely electrical 
engine. They, primarily used to supply logistics to and from 
the Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM), so they have wheels, 
which allow them to traverse on flat grounds and even on 
concave surfaces inside the tunnels without the construction 
of rails inside the tunnel. 
To date, METALLIANCE is developing Automated 
Guided Vehicles (AGV) to assist the driver in driving 
operation of the vehicle, facilitate logistics and storage 
operation in indoor and outdoor environment. The figure 
below depicts the MEATLLAINCE’S Multi Service Vehicle 
(MSV) design and its dimension. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
V. SIMULATION, RESULTS, AND VALIDATION ON A REAL 
ROAD PROFILE (RENNES TUNNEL) 
Electrical modeling vehicle allows to define the evaluation 
of all different electric parameters acting on the system at a 
time t in order to determine the electrical power needed for 
moving the vehicle forward. It constitutes the system of 
electrical equations associated with the power supply circuit. 
The electrical vehicle environment is modeled through the 
resistive torque applied to the electric motor. Therefore, the 
proposed electric model receives as input the drive cycle that 
the vehicle should execute (the given speed and road profile). 
This reference is given to a pilot model that gives as output a 
signal representative of torque request. 
The followed figure (Figure2) depicts the overall diagram 
of the electric model vehicle based on the physical description 
of all forces acting on moving the vehicle [10]. This objective 
defines the first and second step of model development.

Based on the third model development step, specifications 
system (road profile and constraint speed vehicle) is recording 
from Rennes tunnel France and the value of these forces is 
leaning on the limit conditions that influence the vehicle. 
To formulate the model and achieve the fourth model 
development step, the relationship that connect the different 
outputs to the different inputs is required. Thus, resistant 
wheel torque depends on the sum of these forces (rolling 
friction force, aerodynamic force, acceleration force, and the 
downhill-slope force) multiplied by the wheel radius. In fact, 
the rolling friction force is defined by the following equation. 
𝐹𝑟 = 𝐶𝑟 ∗ 𝑚 ∗ 𝑔 
(1) 
Where  Cr , m   and 𝐠  represent respectively the rolling 
resistance coefficient, vehicle mass (loaded and unloaded 
vehicle) and gravitational acceleration. The law states that the 
acceleration force is given by the multiplication of the 
acceleration a by the mass of the vehicle m. 
Facc = m ∗ a 
(2) 
The force exerted by the air on the vehicle constitutes the 
aerodynamic force. 
Faero = 0.5 ∗ Svehicle ∗ Cx ∗ ρ ∗ [V2] 
(3) 
 
Where  ρ   represents  the air density,  Svehicle  constitutes 
the section area of the vehicle, Cx  is the aerodynamic 
coefficient and V is defined as the vehicle speed in m/s. Given 
that the maximum speed is 18 km/h, the vehicle is moving at 
low speed so we can neglect the aerodynamic force. 
Therefore, the resultant force down the slope (downhill-slope 
force) is given by this equation. 
𝐹𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑒 = 𝑚 ∗ 𝑔 ∗ 𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝛼) 
(4) 
Where 𝛂  is the slope angle. The sum of all these forces 
multiplied by the wheel radius results the resistant wheel 
torque, which is given by this equation 
𝑇𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑙 = ∑Forces ∗ Rr 
(5) 
By the value of the resistant wheel torque and the 
reduction wheel ration, the motor torque is defined. 
 
𝑇𝑚𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑟 = Twheel ∗ 𝑅𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜 
(6) 
The motor speed is defined by from the vehicle speed. 
𝑆𝑚𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑟 = V ∗
60
2 ∗ 𝜋 ∗ 𝑅𝑟
(7) 
And finally, the mechanical power is calculated by this 
followed equation. 
𝑃 = Smotor ∗ Tmotor

All the vehicle parameters used for the simulation 
are defined in Table I.

forward. The speed profile has a maximum speed of 18 kmph 
with two phases: the first where the vehicle is loaded and the 
second where the vehicle is empty. The modeling is applied to 
a Multi-Service Vehicle (VMS) vehicle. 
In order to determine the level of fidelity model to the real 
world, the model should be compared to real data recorded for 
each real data of vehicle´s electrical system the driving 
operation vehicle. Indeed, an actual data has been recorded 
from driving task of the Métalliance Multi-Service Vehicle 
(VMS) in Rennes tunnel (France) (data of all electric 
parameters recording from vehicle operation inside Rennes 
tunnel during 238 minutes). Therefore, each real data of 
vehicle’s electrical is compared to the corresponding in the 
simulation model in order to evaluate the performance and the 
accurate model development as is shown in Figures 4 and 5. 
The model input (given speed) is divided into two phases: 
loaded (from 0 to 107 minutes) and unloaded vehicle (from 
122 to 238 minutes). The first plot shows the comparison of 
the results simulation to their corresponding signals that were 
recorded during the measurement: vehicle’s acceleration from 
the given speed input, the simulated rotational engine speed, 
the rolling friction force, and their corresponding signals that 
were recorded during the measurement. Moreover, the second 
plot shows the corresponding curves of the acceleration force, 
resistant wheel torque, motor torque and the mechanical 
power. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This 
simulation 
demonstrates 
approximately 
the 
overlapping curves of each parameter profile.  As it shown by 
the simulation results, the diagrams resulting from the 
simulation and that of real data are substantially identical. This 
allows us to conclude that our model is faithfully close to the 
real world. Even, this work focus is made on the 
METALLIANCE’s industrial vehicles, it could be used for 
other types of electrical vehicles. Just it must choose the road 
profile and speed and define the vehicle parameters. 
 
VI. CONCLUSION   
This paper presents the suitable process to implement an 
electrical model of a Métalliance Multi-Service Vehicle 
(VMS) in Matlab/Simulink environment, using the model 
development steps proposed throughout the literature. It falls 
within the framework of an autonomous vehicle, which can 
do driving maneuvers and tasks by itself. Therefore, methods 
and steps for modeling development have been exposed. The 
third model development step remains to study the operational 
design domain of the used system: environmental 
information, vehicle system characteristic and operation.

Hence, an electric model vehicle has been developed 
based on the electrical equations associated with the power 
sup-ply circuit. It defines for real time the evaluation of 
various electric vehicle parameters. It has been validated by 
real world environment. We conducted its simulation by real 
data in order to validate its performance and achieve high 
accuracy in comparison with the actual world. The simulation 
result showed that the model is highly close to the real world. 
Some perspectives are considered in order to develop a 
simulator, which represents a virtual prototype of the real 
world that could be fast, efficient, and valuable. 
The future work will focus on the development of the 
hydraulic and thermal vehicle model, then combining these 
models with the present work constitutes the step that achieves 
a complete Métalliance Multi-Service Vehicle (VMS) model. 
Thereby, the work will be completed by the design of a full 
simulator, which reproduces reliably the dynamic behavior of 
Métalliance construction vehicles.
