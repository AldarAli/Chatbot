Abstract—Power grids, as well as neural networks with
synaptic plasticity, describe real-world systems of tremendous
importance for our daily life. The investigation of these seemingly
unrelated types of dynamical networks has attracted increasing
attention over the last decade. In this work, we exploit the
recently established relation between these two types of networks
to gain insights into the dynamical properties of multifrequency
clusters in power grid networks. For this, we consider the
model of Kuramoto-Sakaguchi phase oscillators with inertia and
describe the emergence of multicluster states. Building on this,
we provide a new perspective on solitary states in power grid
networks by introducing the concept of pseudo coupling weights.

I. INTRODUCTION
Complex networks describe various processes in nature
and technology, ranging from physics and neuroscience to
engineering and socioeconomic systems. Of particular interest
are power systems, as well as micro and macro power grids [1],
[2]. It was shown that simple low-dimensional models capture
certain aspects of the short-time dynamics of power grids very
well [3]–[5]. In particular, the model of phase oscillators with
inertia, also known as swing equation, has been widely used in
works on synchronization of complex networks [6], [7] and as
a paradigm for the dynamics of modern power grids [8]–[22].
Over the last years, studies on models of oscillators with in-
ertia have revealed a plethora of common dynamical scenarios
with adaptive network models of coupled oscillators. These
scenarios include solitary states [15], [18], [19], [23], fre-
quency clusters [24]–[27], chimera states [28], [29], hysteretic
behavior and non-smooth synchronization transitions [30]–
[32]. Moreover, hybrid systems with phase dynamics com-
bining inertia with adaptive coupling weights have been in-
vestigated, for instance, to account for a changing network
topology due to line failures [33], to include voltage dynam-
ics [34] or to study the emergence of collective excitability
and bursting [35].
Despite the apparent qualitative similarities of the two types
of models, only recently their quantitative relationship has
been discovered [36]. In this paper, we show implications
of the relation for dynamical power grid models and provide
future perspectives for the research on power grid stability and
control.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we in-
troduce the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model with inertia. In the
subsequent section III, we brieﬂy review the analytic relation
between power grid models and adaptive networks and intro-
duce the concept of the pseudo coupling matrix. In Section IV
we show the emergence of a multicluster for oscillators with
inertia. Subsequently, in Section V, we show how the concept
of pseudo coupling weights can be used to study solitary states
in realistic power grid networks. Finally, in Section VI, we
summarize the results and give an outlook.

of the ith node (i = 1, . . . , N), corresponding to generators
and loads [34]. The φi(t), ˙φi(t) are deﬁned relative to a
rotation with reference power line frequency ωG, e.g., 50 Hz
for European power grid. The parameter M is the inertia
coefﬁcient, γ is the damping constant, σ is the overall coupling
strength, and Pi is the power injected or consumed at node i
(related to the natural frequency ωi = Pi/γ). The connectivity
between the oscillators is described by the entries aij ∈ {0, 1}
of the adjacency matrix A. Further, the coupling function
sin(φ + α) is parameterized by the phase lag parameter
α [37]. The phase lag can be interpreted as part of complex
impedance [19].
III. RELATING POWER GRID MODELS TO ADAPTIVE
NETWORKS
In the following, we present a relation between phase oscil-
lator models with inertia and systems with adaptive coupling
weights, and provide an extension for higher order power grid
models including voltage dynamics.

A. Pseudo coupling weights: The link between inertia and
network adaptivity
Consider N adaptively coupled phase oscillators [25], [29],
[38]
˙φi = ωi +
N
X
j=1
aijκijf(φi − φj),
(2)
˙κij = −ϵ [κij + g(φi − φj)] ,
(3)
where φi ∈ [0, 2π) represents the phase of the ith oscillator
(i = 1, . . . , N), ωi is its natural frequency, and κij is the
coupling weight of the connection from node j to i. Further,
f and g are 2π-periodic functions where f is the coupling
function and g is the adaptation rule, and ϵ is the adaptation
rate that is usually chosen to be small (ϵ ≪ 1). The entries
aij of the adjacency matrix A describe again the connectivity
of the network.
In order to ﬁnd the relation between (1) and (2)–(3), we
ﬁrst write (1) in the form
˙φi = ωi + ψi,
(4)
˙ψi = − γ
M

ψi + σ
γ
N
X
j=1
aij sin(φi − φj + α)

 ,
(5)
where ψi is the deviation of the instantaneous phase velocity
from the natural frequency ωi. We observe that this is a system
of N phase oscillators (4) augmented by the adaptation (5) of
the frequency deviation ψi. Note that the coupling between
the phase oscillators is realized in the frequency adaptation
which is different from the classical Kuramoto system [39].
As we know from the theory of adaptively coupled phase
oscillators [25], [29], a frequency adaptation can also be
achieved indirectly by a proper adaptation of the coupling
matrix.
In order to introduce coupling weights into system (4)–
(5), we express the frequency deviation ψi as the sum ψi =
PN
j=1 aijχij of the dynamical power ﬂows χij from the
nodes j that are coupled with node i. The power ﬂows are
governed by the equation ˙χij = −ϵ (χij + g(φi − φj)), where
g(φi − φj) ≡ σ sin(φi − φj + α)/γ are their stationary
values [17] and ϵ = γ/M. It is straightforward to check that
ψi, deﬁned in such a way, satisﬁes the dynamical equation (5).
As a result, we have shown that the swing equation (4)–(5)
can be written as the following system of adaptively coupled
phase oscillators
˙φi = ωi +
N
X
j=1
aijχij,
(6)
˙χij = −ϵ [χij + g(φi − φj)] .
(7)
The obtained system corresponds to (2)–(3) with coupling
weights χij and coupling function f(φi − φj) ≡ 1. The
coupling weights form a pseudo coupling matrix χ. Note that
the base network topology aij of the phase oscillator system
with inertia (1) is unaffected by the transformation.
With the introduction of the pseudo coupling weights χij,
we embed the 2N dimensional system (4)–(5) into a higher
dimensional phase space. In [36], it was shown that the dy-
namics of the higher dimensional system (6)–(7) is completely
governed by the system (4)–(5) on a 2N dimensional invariant
submanifold, thereby establishing a mathematically rigorous
relation.
Let us discuss the physical meaning of the coupling weights
χij. For this, we consider the power ﬂows Fij from node j
to node i given by Fij = −g(φi − φj) [17]. Then each χij is
driven by the power ﬂow from j to i. In particular, for constant
Fij, χij → Fij asymptotically as t → ∞ on the timescale 1/ϵ.
Therefore, χij acquires the meaning of a dynamical power
ﬂow.
The obtained result suggests that the power grid model is
a speciﬁc realization of adaptive neural networks. Indeed, in
the following, we proceed one step further and show that more
complex models for synchronous machines can be represented
as adaptive network as well.
B. Swing equation with voltage dynamics as adaptive network
with metaplasticty
Here we generalize the results of the previous subsection
for the swing equation with voltage dynamics [18], [34]:
M ¨φi + γ ˙φi = Pi +
N
X
j=1
EiEjaijh(φi − φj),
(8)
mi ˙Ei = −Ei + Ef,i +
N
X
j=1
aijEjv(φi − φj),
(9)
where the additional dynamical variable Ei is the voltage
amplitude. The functions h and v are 2π-periodic, and mi and
Ef,i are machine parameters [18], [34]. All other variables and
parameters are as in (1).
Equations (8)–(9) can be rewritten as an adaptive network
(6)–(7) supplemented by (9) where g(φ) ≡ −EiEjh(φ)/γ and
ϵ = γ/M. For this, in analogy to Section IIIA, we write (8)–
(9) as
˙φi = ωi +
N
X
j=1
aijχij,
(10)
˙χij = − 1
Mi
[γχij − EiEjh(φi − φj)] ,
(11)
mi ˙Ei = −Ei + Ef,i +
N
X
j=1
aijEjv(φi − φj),
(12)
where we introduce the coordinate changes χij → χij +Pi/γ,
Ei → Ei+Ef,i and set ωi = Pi/γ. Due to the voltage dynam-
ics (9), the adaptation function g(φ) = Ei(t)Ej(t)h(φ) in (11)
possesses additional adaptivity. This kind of meta-adaptivity
(meta-plasticity) is of importance in neural networks [40] as
well as for neuromorphic devices [41].

formed ﬁrst (d), and the other clusters are then successively formed depending
on their size (e),(f). In (a-f) the oscillator indices are sorted in increasing order
of their mean phase velocity. The state is found by numerical integration
of (1) with identical oscillators Pi = 0 and uniform random initial conditions

aij = 1 for all i ̸= j, M = 1, γ = 0.05, σ = 0.016, α = 0.46π, N = 100.
IV. MIXED FREQUENCY CLUSTER STATES IN PHASE
OSCILLATOR MODELS WITH INERTIA
In this section, we provide a novel viewpoint of the emer-
gence of multifrequency cluster states for phase oscillator
models with inertia. In such a state all oscillators split into
C groups (called clusters) each of which is characterized by
a common cluster frequency Ωµ. In particular, the temporal
behavior of the ith oscillator of the µth cluster (µ = 1, . . . , C)
is given by φµ
i (t) = Ωµt + ρµ
i + sµ
i (t) where ρµ
i ∈ [0, 2π)
and sµ
i (t) are bounded functions describing different types
of phase clusters characterized by the phase relation within
each cluster [25]. Various types of multicluster states including
the special subclass of solitary states have been extensively
described for adaptively coupled phase oscillators [23], [26],
[29].
In Figure 1, we present a 4-cluster state of in-phase syn-
chronous clusters on a globally coupled network. As we know
from the ﬁndings for adaptive networks [25], (hierarchical)
multicluster states are built out of single cluster states whose
frequency scales approximately with the number Nµ of ele-
ments in the cluster. In the zeroth-order expansion in γ, the
collective cluster frequencies are given by Ωµ ≈ −σNµ sin α.
Multicluster states exist in the asymptotic limit (γ → 0) also
for networks of phase oscillators with inertia if the cluster
frequencies are sufﬁciently different meaning the clusters are
hierarchical in size. Remarkably, the pseudo coupling matrix
displayed in Figure 1(f) shows the characteristic block diago-
nal shape that is known for adaptive networks. In particular,
the oscillators within each cluster are more strongly connected
than the oscillators between different clusters.
Another observation for multicluster states in networks of
phase oscillators with inertia is their hierarchical emergence.
As reported in [29] for adaptive networks, the clusters emerge
in a temporal sequence from the largest to the smallest. In
Figure 1(c-f), we show that this particular feature is also found
in phase oscillators with inertia.
V. SOLITARY STATES IN THE GERMAN ULTRA-HIGH
VOLTAGE POWER GRID
In this section, we show that multifrequency cluster states,
as discussed in Figure 1, may also occur in real power grid
networks, which are heterogeneous in contrast to the identical
oscillators treated in the previous section. For the simulation,
we consider the Kuramoto model with inertia given by (1).
The network structure and the power distribution are taken
from the ELMOD-DE data set provided in [42].
In Figure 2, we provide a visualization of the German ultra-
high voltage power grid. In order to determine the net power
consumption/generation Pi for each node in Figure 2 depicted
in the inset above the map, the individual power generation
and consumption at each node are compared. We obtain the
net power distribution Pi = (Ptotal/CTotal)Coff,i − Poff,i where
PTotal = 36 GW and CTotal ≈ 88.343 GW are the off-peak
power consumption and generation of the whole power grid
network, respectively, and Coff,i and Poff,i are the off-peak
power consumption and generation for each individual node,
respectively. Thus power balance P
i Pi = 0 is guaranteed.
For further details refer to [11], [18].
In Figure 3, we show a solitary state obtained by the
simulation of model (1) with the parameters as described
above for t = 600 and uniformly distributed random initial
conditions φ ∈ (0, 2π), ˙φ ∈ (−1, 1). The temporal averages
of the oscillators’ phase velocities are obtained by neglecting
the transient period t ∈ [0, 500). Solitary states are special
cases of multifrequency cluster states where only single nodes
have a different frequency compared to the large background
cluster [23]. Figure 3 (a) shows such a solitary state where
5 solitary nodes have a signiﬁcantly different mean phase
velocities than all the other oscillators from the large coherent
cluster, which is synchronized at Ω0 ≈ −0.407 Hz. Similar
results have been recently obtained in [18], [19]. Remarkably,
the mean phase velocities of the solitary nodes is very close
to their natural frequency, see Figure 3(b). This means that
the solitary states decouple on average from the mean ﬁeld of
their neighborhood, i.e., ˙φSolitary = ωSolitary + P
j aijχij with
temporal average ⟨P
j aijχij⟩ small compared to ωSolitary.
In order to shed light on further characteristics of the solitary
states, we consider the power ﬂows, i.e, the elements of the

we provide an overview of the pseudo coupling matrix for
the results obtained in the simulation of the German ultra-
high voltage power grid, see also Figure 3. Note that we do
not mark the nodes of the network in Figure 4 (locations
of the generators and consumers) to better visualize the
characteristics of the pseudo coupling weights. We present
the average coupling weights in Figure 4. As we know from
the discussion in Section III, the coupling weights correspond
to the dynamical power ﬂow of each transmission line. We
further know that the average value of the power ﬂow between
a solitary node and a node from the coherent cluster is small
but not necessarily zero. This is in fact supported by Figure 4,
see also blow-ups I and II.

The temporal variations of the power ﬂow are presented in
Figure 5. Here, only a few lines show signiﬁcant temporal
variations. In particular, these lines are between solitary nodes
and the coherent cluster. The blow-ups support the latter
observation by showing the highest values of the temporal
variation of the power ﬂow for lines from and to the solitary
nodes. Besides, Figure 5 shows how far into the network power
ﬂow ﬂuctuations are spread in the presence of solitary states.
It is visible that high power ﬂuctuations exist even between
nodes of the coherent cluster. These ﬂuctuations would not be
present if all oscillators were synchronized.
The insets in the upper panels of Figures 4 and 5 depict
the temporal evolution of three representative pseudo coupling
weights. The three coupling weights vary periodically in time
but with different amplitudes. For the coupling between two
nodes of the coherent cluster (10 → 70), the small variations
stem from the small difference in their individual temporal
dynamics which depends on their natural frequencies and the
individual topological neighborhoods. In this realistic setup,
the dynamical network is very heterogeneous. In contrast to
the case of two nodes of the coherent clusters, the couplings
between solitary nodes and a node from the coherent cluster
vary much more strongly periodically in time. To understand
this observation, we derive an asymptotic approximation for
the dynamics of the solitary states. Using an approach similar
to [25], the large power ﬂow variations on transmission
lines connecting solitary nodes can be explained. We apply
a multiscale ansatz in ϵ = 1/K ≪ 1 to a two-cluster
state. By the two-cluster state, we model the interaction of
a solitary node with the coherent cluster where φ1 represents
the phase of the solitary node with natural frequency ω and
φ2 represents the phase of the coherent cluster with natural
frequency Ω0. The pseudo coupling weights between the two
clusters are denoted by χµν (µ, ν = 1, 2, µ ̸= ν). The
ansatz reads φµ = Ωµ(τ0, τ1, . . . ) + ϵ(φ(1,µ)) + · · · and
χµν = χ(0)
µν + ϵχ(1)
µν + · · · with τp = ϵpt, p ∈ N.
Omitting technical details, in the ﬁrst order approximation
in ϵ we obtain φ1 = ω − (K/ω2) cos(ωt) and φ2 = Ω0 +
(K/ω2) cos(ωt) [36]. Additional corrections to the oscillator
frequencies appear in the third and higher orders of the
expansion in ϵ and depend explicitly on ω. The latter fact is
consistent with the numerical observation in Figure 3(b) that
solitary nodes with a lower natural frequency may differ more
strongly from their own natural frequency than the solitary
oscillators with a higher natural frequency.
As we have seen, the pseudo coupling approach allows for
a description of the power ﬂow for each line individually. It
shows the emergence of large power ﬂow ﬂuctuations at the
solitary nodes, and the spreading of those ﬂuctuations over the
power grid.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
We have discussed the striking relation between phase oscil-
lators with inertia, which are widely used for modeling power
grids [8]–[22] and adaptive networks of phase oscillators,
which have ubiquitous applications in physical, biological,

socioeconomic or neural systems. The introduction of the
pseudo coupling matrix allows us to split the total input from
all nodes into node i into power ﬂows. Thus, the frequency
deviation ψi =
˙φi − ωi in the phase oscillator model with
inertia corresponds to the adaptively adjusted total input which
an oscillator receives. This gives insight into the concept
of phase oscillator models with inertia, which effectively
takes into account the feedback loop of self-adjusted coupling
with all other oscillators. Additionally, our novel theoretical
framework allows for a generalization to swing equations with
voltage dynamics [34].
Our ﬁrst example shows that the theory of building blocks
developed for adaptively coupled phase oscillators can be
transferred to explain the emergence of multicluster states
in networks of coupled phase oscillators with inertia. These
ﬁndings are of crucial importance for studying power grid
models with respect to emergent multistability and dynamical
effects that lead to desynchronization [43].
In fact, a properly functioning real-world power grid should
be completely synchronized, i.e., clustering into different

groups with different frequencies would be undesirable. How-
ever, multicluster states can still have practical relevance, since
they inﬂuence the destabilization of the synchronous state.
Thus, it is important to study when they occur, in order to be
able to take control measures to prevent them. For instance,
recent works [18], [19] have shown that the solitary states,
which are a subclass of multicluster states, arise naturally
in the desynchronization transition of real-world power grid
networks (German and Scandinavian power grid), and that this
knowledge is essential for an efﬁcient power grid control. For
the German power grid, we provide an additional example and
show analytically how the techniques developed for adaptive
networks are used to characterize the emergent solitary states.
We have shown that the concept of pseudo coupling weights
is powerful tool to analyze the dynamical spreading of power
ﬂow ﬂuctuations. Therefore, we believe that this concept can
be used in the future to design novel detection and control
approaches for modern power grid networks.
