Abstract— The use of learning objects in constructivist 
learning environments causes a dilemma between reusability 
and context representation. The extension of current metadata 
standards with XML-based context resources offers a broad, 
transparent and efficient representation of the context of 
learning objects. They are the basis for context aware 
knowledge acquisition in self-paced learning environments.

 INTRODUCTION  
In contrast to traditional face-to-face learning, e-learning 
applications are available independent of time and space. 
They have in particular the potential to support self-paced 
and problem-oriented learning from a constructivist point of 
view. Learning processes are performed individually 
through active construction based on existing mental 
representations. Those individual learning processes can 
hardly be supported in face-to-face arrangements with a 
multitude of participants. 
 
In addition to self-paced learning, constructivist learning 
environments 
are 
mainly 
characterized 
through 
representation of multiple contexts and perspectives [14] 
Transparent context representation of learning content is 
crucial for flexible knowledge acquisition and to apply the 
knowledge later on. Hypermedia learning environments 
meet these requirements. Furthermore, they also support 
various information processing abilities of learners through 
multifaceted encoding of learning contents [14, 15]. Due to 
variation and choice, they also motivate the learner during 
his learning process [8]. 
 
However, while using hyper-structured learning contents 
the modularization of existing learning resources is 
necessary. Thereby learning material is divided into small 
self-contained units. The main reason for using learning 
objects during the modularization process is the reusability 
of learning content for several learning scenarios and the 
effective 
development 
of 
digital 
learning 
material 
accordingly. Learning objects are described as “any digital 
resource that can be reused to support learning” [16]. These 
building blocks for learning mainly represent de-
contextualized knowledge. The less specific context a 
learning object contains, the sooner it can be used for 
different learning scenarios and the higher is its 
“reusability” value. This modularization is often associated 
with disorientation and cognitive overload problems on the 
learners’ side [3]. Only a transparent context representation 
of learning content allows active construction of knowledge 
and guarantees learning success [6]. This dilemma is also 
called Reusable Object and Instruction Paradox [1]. 
 
This paper points out how contextualization of learning 
objects independent of their granularity can be realized for 
hypermedia environments that support self-paced learning. 
First, the context that is relevant for self-paced learning 
environments is characterized. In addition, the deficiencies 
of existing metadata standards for a comprehensive, 
transparent and efficient description of the context of 
learning objects are illustrated. Subsequently, the approach 
and the solution of XML-based context specifications, 
which are used to describe the context of learning objects, 
are presented.

CONTEXTUALIZATION OF LEARNING 
OBJECTS 
A. Access to Learning Objects in Hypermedia Learning 
Environments 
In order to define the relevant context of learning objects 
it is crucial to know how learners access learning material in 
self-paced learning environments. The access to learning 
contents in hypermedia learning environments mainly 
happens topic-oriented. Based on desired knowledge the 
learner selects relevant nodes from a network. It is 
necessary to illustrate the relationships between learning 
contents of the current node and other contents as well as 
previous knowledge. On the one hand this is essential for 
learners in order to integrate the semantically impact of the 
information into the own knowledge structure and existing 
mental representations [12]. On the other hand, it must be 
transparent for the learner, which learning paths he can

choose according to his desired and previous knowledge. 
For the representation of the context generic terms, specific 
terms and synonyms of the current topic as well as 
additional qualified relationships are being used (see fig. 1). 
Appropriate elements for navigation allow the retrieval of 
several contents and mapping techniques support the 
transparent presentation of the context [13].

It is also necessary to organize learning material 
hierarchically, i. e. to provide content refining paths. The 
learner can determine his current learning status and is 
guided through individually selected contents by an 
instructivistic approach. Here the learning context is 
classified into several chapters which can be divided into 
subchapters and sections [2]. A standard learning path 
which reflects the curriculum structure appears for the 
learner. Besides this hierarchy of chapters and sections there 
are often didactical links [2]. Those cross-references occur 
i. e. for a comparison. The learner navigates through the 
contextualized content by menus, outlines, and site maps. 
B. Metadata 
The context of learning objects is described by metadata, 
which on the one hand characterize the learning objects 
themselves and on the other hand the relationship between 
each other [10]. Describing learning objects with metadata 
is a part of learning technology standards, which were 
developed due to compatibility and reusability of learning 
resources. Standards, which provide elements for describing 
relationships between learning objects, are of special 
interest to contextualization. This is widely realized in the 
IEEE LTSC Learning Object Metadata (LOM)-Standard [9]. 
The category “LOM.Relation” plays an important role in 
specifying the context. This category allows the definition 
of directed relationships, starting from the metadataset in 
which they are formulated to various target metadatasets [7]. 
However, while using the metadata scheme for a 
detailed description of the context three fundamental 
problems appear. In order to realize a bi-directional 
connection between learning objects always two opposing 
uni-directional relations have to be defined. Those pair wise 
connections demand a high effort when first specifying the 
context, as all relevant learning objects have to be found 
first which are to be referred to. In case of extension and 
updating as well as removal and exchange of learning 
contents metadata of both learning objects have to be 
changed. 
As the authors of the learning objects mainly carry out 
the creation of metadata sets, domain experts have to define 
a framework for the relevant context. This aspect is not part 
of current metadata schemes.  
An additional problem results from the limited language 
space of the LOM scheme relationships, which do not admit 
a comprehensive description of the context [1]. 
The solution proposed here is to separate context 
information from learning objects and metadata. The 
metadata of the learning objects remain untouched so that 
context information can be extended and completed as well 
as maintained by an individual domain expert. This assures 
consistence and timeliness and reduces the complexity of 
defining metadata. The relevant context information is 
represented as a classification scheme.  
C. Subject-Based Classification 
Subject-based classification classifies objects by relevant 
topics 85]. As a basis the ISO standard for topic maps 
allows the configuration of semantic networks which are 
separated from the referenced objects [11]. Therefore, the 
three constructs topics, associations and occurrences are 
available in topic maps. 
All subjects but also abstract concepts and categories can 
be defined as topics [4]. Associations link topics to each 
other and also relationship types can be mapped. 
Relationships do not exist generically but are described in 
detail. A network develops from a hypergraph in which the 
topics are linked by associations, which may have several 
topics at their ends [4]. Finally, learning material which 
cover the topics or which are relevant for them is linked via 
occurrences to the topics.

Thus, topic maps have the advantage to build up a 
flexible model for mapping the context to an open 
vocabulary [5]. 
D. Structure-Based Classification 
Structure-based classification groups modular objects 
around a given didactical structure of a course or learning 
material. In order to represent the curriculum structure in a 
didactical way hierarchically organized classification 
systems have to be established. Taxonomies that already 
exist within the LOM standard provide an appropriate basis. 
However, they have to be extended by the possibility of 
building sequences of learning objects. Interlocking chapters 
and subchapters represent the basic structure. For further 
description, they are enhanced with a numbering system, 
which specifies the position in the whole course. In case of a 
didactical and organizational motivated conversion of the 
course structure, learning objects do not have to be 
described again, as changes are made separately in the 
classification system. 
Furthermore, chapters and subchapters have a rhetorical-
didactical internal structure, which is characterized by the 
learning elements such as theory, exercises, and learning 
progress controls (see fig. 1). For the representation of this 
internal structure, labeling of the learning objects’ types is 
sufficient as the sequence of the learning elements is 
determined independently by the learner within a self-paced 
learning environment. 
III. 
XML-BASED CONTEXT SPECIFICATIONS 
A. XML-ThemeMap 
The ThemeMap is alligned to the ISO standards for topic 
maps. The main difference is that the construct occurrences 
is not used because authors only specify a uni-directional 
link from the learning object metadata to the topics due to 
the problems mentioned in section 2.2. Figure 2 shows the 
elements of the ThemeMap.

Figure 2.  XML Structure of ThemeMap 
Topics comprise subjects the learning material is 
addressing to. One or several BaseNames can be assigned to 
a Topic. Also synonyms can be given. Furthermore, the 
element Scope also allows the indication of a domain with a 
valid BaseName. Each Topic has an identification number 
(ID) which is referred to within the learning object metadata 
in order to classify the context.  
In order  to create relationships between topics with the 
element Association a reference type has to be chosen. All 
intended relationship types are defined as a Topic. The 
element InstanceOf  refers to one of the defined relationship 
types. The element Member comprises Topics that will be 
associated by relationships. By using the attribute 
“assoc_qual” of TopicRef a qualified description of the 
relationships is possible.

Figure 3.  XML Structure of ChapterMap 
All elements possess an attribute for identification within 
the XML data. Metadata do not have to be adapted in case 
of changes of the course structure because the learning 
object metadata is linked with the ID of the element. For 
rhetorical-didactical cross-references the metadata of the 
learning object refers to a further element-ID and allocates 
the attribute “mentioned”. 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The presented contextalization of learning objects has 
been realized within the course “Introduction to Business 
Administration” of the “Bavarian Virtual University”. The 
context is separated from the learning objects and included 
in context resources that permit easy mapping and updating 
by a domain expert. The realized self-paced and hypermedia 
learning environment converts the XML-based context 
resources and generates dynamically the user interfaces for 
a topic-oriented as well as an instructivistic access to the 
learning material.

extension for current learning technology standards. 
ThemeMap is a flexible instrument for context mapping 
which may be customized to the individual e-learning 
content and may be processed automatically. In a wide 
sense contextualization not only covers the representation of 
relationships between learning objects but also takes into 
account learning environments in real life scenarios, e. g. at 
work or at home, and supports social context, e. g. learning 
groups or communities. These are open fields for research in 
many ways. ThemeMap can also be used to describe such 
context elements.
