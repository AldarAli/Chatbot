Abstract—In this paper, we investigate the use of systematic
random network coding (SNC) for multicast and multi-unicast
over satellite. In particular, the satellite coverage is over a large
geographical area that consists of several users. These users
may face different channel conditions and undergo different
packet loss rates. In this work, we identify two regions of
transmission. The multicast region where all users subscribed
to the multicast channel can recover all the data packets and
the multi-unicast region where only users with good channel
conditions can recover all the data packets but those with bad
channel accept transmission losses. For the two regions, we derive
theoretically and by simulation the beneﬁts of SNC against state-
of-the-art end-to-end coding. Our results show that SNC can
achieve up to 26.90% and 24.26% higher maximum achievable
rates for multicast and multi-unicast respectively. Further, we
show practical architectural and encapsulation feasibility.

I. INTRODUCTION
SNC [1]-[6] has been studied recently as a practical network
coding scheme to increase the achievable rates and reliability
of wireless networks. It has been proved that SNC achieves
smaller complexity, smaller delay and smaller overhead as
compared to previous network coding schemes based on
random network coding (RNC) [7] [8]. However, in the current
literature, SNC has been investigated mainly in the networks
for unicast with a source and a sink connected via several
intermediate nodes.
In this paper, we investigate the use of SNC for multicast
and multi-unicast over satellite. We identify two regions of
transmission, one for multicast and another for multi-unicast
with an in-network (re)encoding to increase the achievable
rates and the reliability of satellite networks.
We consider a system topology (Figure 1) where a source
is connected to all the sinks via an intermediate node. This
system topology is a relevant case in satellite systems where
there is one intermediate node which could be a gateway (or
others) and there can be several sink nodes which are the users
distributed in a large geographical area undergoing different
packet loss rates. Our theoretical derivations and simulation
results on the reliability and the achievable rates show the
beneﬁts of network coding with respect to state-of-the-art end-
to-end forward erasure codes (FEC) codes like Reed-Solomon
(RS) codes for both multicast and multi-unicast.
In this paper, we also explore the beneﬁts of network coding
in two different set of layers of a satellite network protocol ar-
chitecture. These are satellite-independent layers (application,
transport and IP layers) and satellite-dependent layers (link
and physical layers). In particular, the satellite-independent

layers are mainly signiﬁcant for the application’s developer
who has access to the data ﬂowing in these layers and the
satellite-dependent layers are mainly signiﬁcant for the system
operators. In this paper, ﬁrst we present the implementation of
network coding in the link layer of the satellite systems and
second, we focus on the implementation of network coding in
the application layer for better internet communication over
satellite systems.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II,
we discuss the system model. In Section III, we describe the
systematic network coding for multicast and multi-unicast. In
Section IV, we present the theoretical analysis and derivation
of theoretical expressions for the reliability and the achievable
rate. Section V presents the implementation of SNC in the link
layer of the protocol stack and Section VI presents the simu-
lation results. In Section VII, we discuss the implementation
of SNC in the upper layers of the satellite network protocol
stack. Finally, Section VIII concludes this paper.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
Consider that a source node has K data packets to send to
L − 1 sink nodes. Each packet is a column vector of length
M over a ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq. The set of data packets in matrix
notation is S =
 s1
s2
.
.
.
sK

, where st is the
tth data packet. The source is connected to all the sinks via
an intermediate node as shown in Figure 1. All the links are
modeled as memoryless erasure channels. There are L links
in the network. The erasure probability from the source to the
intermediate node is denoted by ϵ1 and the erasure probability
from the intermediate node to the sink node j is denoted by
ϵj, j = 2, .., L.
We assume there is no feedback from the sinks (or from
the intermediate node) due to the inherent large latency of
satellite systems. We also assume that packet transmissions
occur at discrete time slots such that each node can transmit
40

one packet per time slot. We will also assume that the coding
schemes run for a total of N time slots (N is larger than
or equal to K) and every node (except the sinks) transmits a
packet in each time slot t = 1, 2, ..., N.
III. SYSTEMATIC NETWORK CODING FOR MULTICAST AND
MULTI-UNICAST
A. Encoding at the source node
The SNC encoder sends K data packets in the ﬁrst K
time slots (systematic phase) followed by N − K random
linear combinations of data packets in the next N − K time
slots (non-systematic phase). Let X = SG represent K
systematic packets and N − K coded packets transmitted
by the SNC encoder during N consecutive time slots. The
generator matrix G =
 IK
C 
consists of the identity
matrix IK of dimension K and C ∈ FK×N−K
q
with elements
chosen randomly from a ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq. The code rate is given
by ρ = K
N .
B. Re-encoding at the intermediate node
The SNC re-encoder performs re-encoding operations in
every time slot and sends N packets to the sink nodes. Let
XI = XD1T represent N packets transmitted by the SNC re-
encoder during N consecutive time slots where D1 ∈ FN×N
q
represents erasures from the source node to the intermediate
node and T ∈ FN×N
q
represents the re-encoding operations at
the intermediate node.
The erasure matrix D1 is an N × N diagonal matrix with
every diagonal component zero with probability ϵ1 and one
with probability 1 − ϵ1.
The re-encoding matrix T is modeled as an upper triangular
matrix. The non-zero elements of T are selected as follows.
During the systematic phase, if a packet st is lost i.e.,
D1(t, t) = 0 then the non-zero elements of the tth column
of matrix T are randomly selected from Fq. This represents
that if the systematic packet is lost from the source node to
the intermediate node, then the intermediate node transmits
a random linear combination of the packets stored in its
buffer. If a packet st is not lost, i.e., D1(t, t) = 1 then the
tth column of matrix T is the same as the tth column of
identity matrix IN. This represents that the intermediate node
forwards this systematic packet to the sinks. During the non-
systematic phase, the intermediate node sends a random linear
combination of the packets stored in its buffer and all the
non-zero elements of last N − K columns of T are chosen
randomly from the ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq.
C. Decoding at the sink nodes
Let Yj = XIDj, j = 2, 3, ..., L represents N packets
received by the sink node j where Dj represents erasures from
the intermediate node to the sink node j. Dj is N×N diagonal
matrix of the same type as D1 but with erasure probability ϵj.
If the sink node j does not receive any packet in time slot t
then the tth column of Yj is a zero column.
The overall SNC coding strategy can be expressed using
a linear operation channel (LOC) model where the output
at the sink node j is Yj = SGHj where Hj = D1TDj
represents the transfer matrix from the source to the sink j.
We assume that the coding vectors are attached in the packet
headers so that the matrix GHj is known at the sink j.
However, the overhead, due to the attached coding vectors, is
kept low due to the use of systematic coding (coding vectors
are not attached with the systematic packets). The decoding is
progressive using the Gaussian Jordan algorithm as in [6]. All
the K data packets are recovered when K innovative packets
are received at the sink j, i.e., rank(GHj) = K.
IV. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS
In this section, we will present the theoretical expressions
of the average reliability and the average achievable rate of
the considered topology. Let us ﬁrst deﬁne η as the residual
erasure rate of any link that could be achieved after the overall
coding and decoding operations. The reliability of the link is
given by (1 − η).
Based on the deﬁnitions of the residual erasure rate and the
reliability and using the deﬁnition of achievable rate from [9],
the average achievable rate of the considered topology is given
by,
Rav = ρ (1 − ηav)
(1)
with,
ηav =
1
L − 1
L
X
j=2
[1 − (1 − η1)(1 − ηj)]
(2)
as the average reliability of the considered topology, η1 is the
residual erasure rate from the source node to the intermediate
node and ηj is the residual erasure rate from the intermediate
node to the sink node j where,
ηl = φl1 + φl2, l = 1, 2, ..., L
(3)
The ﬁrst term represents the residual erasure rate for the case
when the correctly received packets are less than K, it is given
by,
φl1 = ϵlPr(A < K − 1)
(4)
where A is a Binomial random variable, accounting for the
Bernoulli nature of the erasures. The second term represents
the case of reception of K or more packets but not linearly
dependent. It is given by,
φl2 = ϵlPr(A ≥ K − 1)Pr(rank(GHj) < K)
(5)
Using the results in [10], we obtain the exact expressions of
φl1 and φl2 in (6) and (7), respectively.

ing to the case when the average reliability approaches
100%. This would mean that all the sinks in the network
are able to recover all the data packets. We have also
identiﬁed the multi-unicast region where the sinks with
better channel recover all the data packets and the sink(s)
with bad channel still suffer from some losses. The beneﬁt
of multi-unicast over multicast is that one can achieve
overall higher transmission rates by not sacriﬁcing the
rate due to the bottleneck sink (link with higher erasure
rate). Hence, based on the requirements of the users, our
results provide optimal usage of available bandwidth for
transmission.

smaller than the capacity of the network which is

j (1−ϵj) = 0.4. However, when the code rate is higher
than the multicast capacity, multi-unicast is feasible. This
is because the capacity of the sinks with good channel is
different and higher than the capacity of the network (in
our example it is 0.8). Therefore, when the code rate is
smaller than 0.8, the sinks with good channel can recover
all the data packets making multi-unicast feasible.
• LL-SNC provides higher transmission rates and higher
reliability than LL-FEC in all the cases. When the number
of sink increases, LL-SNC can provide close to 100% re-
liability in the multi-unicast region itself. This is because
there is only one bottleneck link in the network and only
one sink suffers from the bad channel. In this case, it
would be efﬁcient to transmit in the multi-unicast region
such that the higher transmission rates are achieved and
almost all the sinks (except the one with the bad channel)
are able to recover all the data packets. Furthermore,
LL-SNC also provides higher maximum achievable rates
than LL-FEC for both multicast and multi-unicast. The
maximum achievable rate increases as the frame length
increases or the number of sinks increases. Our results
(Table I) show that LL-SNC can achieve up to 26.90%
and 24.26% higher maximum achievable rates than LL-
FEC for multicast and multi-unicast respectively.
In Figure 5, our simulation results also show that LL-SNC
provides smaller average delay per-packet than LL-FEC. This
is because of the following two reasons. First, the progressive
decoding in LL-SNC allows the sinks to start decoding and
recovering as soon as it receives the ﬁrst packet. Second, the
re-encoding in LL-SNC helps the sink to receive K degrees
of freedom and complete the decoding process in fewer time
slots than LL-FEC. The overall delay includes the inherent
transmission delay of 250 ms of the satellite systems.
VII. NETWORK CODING IN SATELLITE INDEPENDENT
LAYERS
In the previous sections, we have focussed on the ap-
plication of the network coding in the satellite-dependent
layers, speciﬁcally in the link layer of the satellite systems.
However, the use of network coding is not limited only to the
satellite-dependent layers, the same network coding framework
can be used in the satellite-independent layers to guarantee
reliability. In this section, we will focus on the protection of
application layer data units (ADUs) for better and efﬁcient
internet communication in the satellite systems.
In the previous sections, we have shown the beneﬁts of LL-
SNC to protect network layer IP packets in the lower layers
of the protocol stack. Similarly, SNC can be used to protect
ADUs in the upper layers of the protocol stack. The encapsula-
tion process is one of the main factors inﬂuencing the efﬁcient
implementation of network coding in the networking protocol
stack. In this section, we outline two encapsulation processes
which can be used for the network coding implementation to
protect ADUs for reliable internet communication.
The ﬁrst encapsulation process (encapsulation process A) is
shown in the Figure 6a. This way of encapsulation was used
for the protection of ADUs using RS coding [14] over real-
time transport protocol (RTP). In Figure 6a, we present the
modiﬁed encapsulation process to be used for the network cod-
ing. A source block (ADT) consists of K ADUs in K columns.
The number of rows in the source block is M = E + 2
where E is the length of the largest ADU. The columns,
which do not have the largest ADU, are ﬁlled with zeros to
be completely ﬁlled. Each column can be considered as a data
packet. The ﬁrst two bytes of each column in the source block
contain the length of the corresponding ADU. ADUs are then
encapsulated into RTP packets. The ﬁrst two bytes and the
zero paddings are not sent over the network. The FEC block
(NCDT) contains N −K columns with N −K coded packets
and the coefﬁcient block (CDT) contains N −K columns with
N −K set of coding coefﬁcients. FEC packets and coefﬁcients
are then encapsulated into RTP packets. Each RTP packet
contains RTP payload, RTP header and FEC payload ID. This
FEC payload ID is used for signaling the coding parameters
like source block ID, FEC packet ID, values of K and N etc.
The CRC-32 is added with every RTP packet to detect errors
in RTP packets at the receiving end. At the receiver, the values
of coding parameters are extracted from the FEC payload ID.
Now, if ADUs are lost then the complete columns are lost.
So, if FEC decoding succeeds, the receiver recovers ADUs
by ﬁlling the erased columns. The initial two bytes are used
to remove zero padding from the data packets to recover the
ADUs.
The second encapsulation process (encapsulation process B)
is shown in the Figure 6b. This way of encapsulation was
used for the protection of IP packets using RS coding over
GSE [12]. In Figure 6b, we present the modiﬁed encapsulation
process to be used for the network coding to protect ADUs.
A source block (ADT) consists of K columns and stores
ADUs. Now, ADUs are arranged column wise starting from
the upper left corner. If an ADU does not ﬁt in one column,
it continues at the top of the following column and so on. If
the ADT is not completely ﬁlled then the zero-padding bytes
are inserted in last column to ﬁll it completely. Each ADU
is then encapsulated in a single or multiple RTP packets. The
FEC block (NCDT) contains N − K columns with N − K
coded packets and the coefﬁcient block (CDT) contains N −K
columns with N − K set of coding coefﬁcients. Each coded
packet from NCDT and the corresponding coding coefﬁcients
from CDT are encapsulated in one RTP packet. The ﬁrst K
bytes of RTP payload contain K coding coefﬁcients followed

(b) Encapsulation process B
Figure. 6: The two encapsulation processes for encapsulation of application layer data units over RTP
by the corresponding NCDT column. The value of K is
signaled through the RTP header of the RTP packet. Finally,
the CRC-32 is added with every RTP packet to detect errors
in RTP packets at the receiving end. Now, if an ADU is lost,
then the corresponding part of the column or the complete
column is also lost. The progressive decoding is performed
and lost columns (or lost part of columns) in ADT are ﬁlled
with the recovered data. The implementation efﬁciency of the
encapsulation process based on the overhead due to headers,
payload ID’s, etc. Both of the above encapsulation processes
inlcude ﬁlling of data tables in different ways. Speciﬁcally,
the encapsulation process B does not include adding of zero
bytes for each unﬁlled column. Therefore, the overhead due
to the extra padding bytes could be reduced and higher
throughput could be achieved by using encapsulation process
B for network coding implementation.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have focussed on the use of SNC for
multicast and multi-unicast over satellite. We have identiﬁed
the transmission regions for multicast and multi-unicast over
satellite by characterizing the reliability and achievable rates
offered by SNC in these two different regions. We have
derived the theoretical expressions for the average reliability
and the average achievable rate of the considered topology.
Our theoretical and simulation analysis present the beneﬁts
of SNC over end-to-end coding for both multicast and multi-
unicast. Our results have shown that a higher rate is achievable
for the multi-unicast however not all the users in multi-
unicast can recover all the data packets. Therefore, based on
the requirements from different users, the transmission region
can be chosen for the optimal usage of available bandwidth.
Finally, we have explored the beneﬁts of network coding at
different layers of the satellite network protocol stack. We have
shown the encapsulation and architecture feasibility of network
coding application in the satellite-dependent layers and we
have proposed two encapsulation processes for the network
coding application in the satellite-independent layers. Future
work includes the investigation of SNC on more complex
networks such as network with multiple sources. Furthermore,
the implementation efﬁciency of the two proposed encapsula-
tion processes should be compared numerically using realistic
values of coding parameters, packet sizes, etc for different
standards.
