Abstract—Designed as semantic structures to support the 
sharing and reuse of geographic data, spatial ontologies have 
recently 
gained 
attention 
within 
the 
geo-information 
community. Geographic ontologies are designed to provide a 
common understanding of the structure of geographic models, 
and to support the development of geographic information 
systems that are conceptually complex. This paper proposes an 
approach for merging spatial ontologies based on three 
complementary modules: matching, mapping and merging. A 
Spatial Ontologies Integration Tool (SOIT) is also developed 
and applied to the road domain.

 INTRODUCTION 
In the applications with spatial vocation (e.g., 
geographic domain), ontologies are an effective solution in 
particular 
to 
ensure 
interoperability 
and 
semantic 
cooperation between Geographic Information systems 
(GIS). Spatial ontologies offer a relevant solution for the 
sharing and the integration of geographic data.  
The problem of heterogeneity of geographic ontologies 
is more complex than that of other domain ontologies [5]; 
because it is necessary to take into account the spatial and 
temporal aspects as well as rules governing the data 
evolution. 
Spatial data interoperability allows simplifying and 
enhancing the sharing, reuse and integration of geographic 
data. However, semantic heterogeneity [8] is a major 
obstacle to the interoperability of geographic data [9]. 
Indeed, the implementation of a geographic ontology can 
manage and structure multiple data sets that can be grouped 
according to geographical criteria. Its objective is not to 
only describe the list of existing geographic objects 
(territory, boundary, road network, etc.) but to identify 
classes; to define the relationships may exist between them, 
and to describe the attributes in order to obtain the 
knowledge base. 
In this paper, we aim to resolve the problem of 
heterogeneity of geographic ontologies by proposing a 
merging approach.  
 
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents an 
overview about tools and techniques for merging ontologies. 
The Third Section details the proposed approach for merging 
geographical ontologies. A spatial ontologies integration tool 
is described in Section 4. Section 5 presents the application 
of our approach and tool on the road domain. The conclusion 
and outlook of our work are listed in Section 6. 
II. 
 ONTOLOGY MERGING TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES 
Several ontologies merging tools were developed in 
literature, such as [6]: Chimaera, FCA-Merge, PROMPT, 
OntoMorph and ONIONS.  
- Chimaera: It is an interactive ontologies merging tool 
that allows the diagnosis, the test and the edition of the 
merging result [4]. It helps user to find the best term by 
proposing a list of the used terms while helping to resolve 
the terminological difficulties. This tool, based on the 
Ontolingua ontology editor, offers a support for the merging 
process to enable the collection of ontologies expressed in 
different formalisms. It makes the translation at the language 
level and uses heuristics to find the parts of the ontology to 
be reorganized. 
- PROMPT: Based on a semi-automatic merging 
approach, it allows making certain tasks automatically and 
helps the user along the merging process [5]. PROMPT 
determines possible filminesses in the state of the ontology 
resulting from user's actions and suggest solutions for them.  
- OntoMorph is based on a merging approach which is 
similar to the two previous tools [2]. An expert uses an initial 
list of correspondences between concepts of the source 
ontologies: the user defines a set of operators that are applied 
to ontologies for resolving inconsistencies. 
- FCA-Merge: It uses a formal, bottom-up method of 
ontology merging based on the extraction of concepts from 
textual documents [7]. It applies natural language processing 
and generates a "concept trellis" from “FCACore” algorithm. 
This trellis is transformed subsequently into domain 
ontology by an expert of the domain. 
- ONIONS (ONtological Integration Of Naive Sources) 
is a method designed for the conceptual analysis and 
ontological integration of terminologies [3]. This method

consists of two steps: (1) A reengineering step which 
consists in the extraction, formatting, analysis and 
formalization of data; (2) A merging step which allows the 
merging of ontologies using an algorithm based on algebra. 
The developed tools do not consider the spatial aspect of 
objects describing the geographical domain. The spatial 
dimension as well at the intrinsic level of the concepts at the 
level of the spatial and semantic relationships were lacking 
to these tools. This limits their applicability in geographical 
ontologies. 
III. 
SPATIAL ONTOLOGIES MERGING APPROACH 
We developed an approach for geographical ontologies 
merging, based on two criteria: 
- The identity search: the search for relationships of spatial 
identity and total identity between concepts of the initial 
ontologies.  
Definition 1. Two objects are spatially identical if they are 
located in the same place but having a different 
characteristic such as the instance name or the acquisition 
date. 
Definition 2. Two objects are totally identical if they are 
spatially and semantically identical. By semantic identity, 
we mean that both objects have the same name and the same 
properties. 
This criterion allows obtaining the skeleton of the ontology 
result of merging process. We thus join the not identical 
individuals of the candidate ontologies to serve as entries to 
the second step of the merging process. 
- The search for enrichment relationships. Enrichment 
relationships have two types: the semantic relationships 
such as equivalence and part-of and the spatial relationships 
such as adjacency, intersection, joint, junction etc. 
The proposed approach is based on three main modules: 
(1) matching module, (2) mapping module and (3) merging 
module (Figure 1). The first module consists in determining 
the matching process between candidate ontologies. The 
output of this phase is a list of matching functions. The 
second phase allows finding correspondences between 
concepts of candidate ontologies. The result of this phase is 
two lists: a list of matches between candidate concepts and a 
second list of concepts without correspondences. The third 
phase is merging which is based on merging rules. It 
produces as result a comprehensive ontology spatially and 
semantically richer than the candidate ontologies.

3.1    The matching phase 
A matching process defines a set of functions which 
specifies correspondences between terms of ontologies. This 
phase gives as a result a list of features matches. There are 
two types of relationships considered in our approach: 
- Connecting relationships: they are the relating points 
between two ontologies. We distinguish spatial identity 
relationships and semantic identity relationships.  
- Enriching relationships: we distinguish semantic 
relationships and topological relationships (intersection, 
union, etc.). 
We use two types of matching: spatial and semantic 
matching. In the semantic matching, we define two 
functions: the first one defines semantic identity relationship 
(Idsem) and the second function defines semantic enrichment 
relationships between candidate concepts. In the spatial 
matching, we define two functions: the spatial identity 
relationship (Idspa) and the spatial enrichment relationships.  
The semantic Identity: Idsem means that two concepts 
have the same name and same properties. We use the 
syntactic technique to derive such relationship. We use the 
edit distance of Levenshtein to calculate the similarity 
between concepts names and their properties. This measure 
of edit distance ed represents the minimum number of

insertions, deletions or substitutions necessary to transform 
one string x into another y. Similarity s(x, y) normalized to 
[0,1] is defined as follows: 
s=1-ed/max(| x |,| y |).  
We consider that two concepts C1 and C2 admit a 
semantic identity relationship Idsem(C1, C2) if and only if: 
s(C1.name,C2.name) = 1  
and for every attribute atti of C1, there exists an attribute 
attj of C2 where s(C1.atti, C2.attj)=1, and vice versa, for 
every attribute of C2, there is an attribute of C1 where 
s(C2.attj,C1.atti) = 0.  
The spatial identity relationship Idspa relates only to 
geographical concepts. A spatial object is described 
according to its graphical form: GF (point, line or polygon), 
semantics data (eg name, nature, appearance, various 
characteristics) and localization data (position on the 
surface). The search for Idspa relationship between concepts 
of candidate ontologies consists in comparing localization 
characteristics of concepts.  
We formally define the relationships considered by our 
approach. We present the following formal definitions 
defined. 
Definition 1: Two objects are spatially identical if they 
are located in the same place but having a different 
characteristic such as the instance name or the acquisition 
date. 
Definition 2: Two objects are totally identical if they are 
spatially and semantically identical. 
Let us consider the concepts C1(X1, Y1) and C2(X2, Y2) 
with X1, Y1 and X2, Y2 are coordinates of C1 and C2 
respectively and C1.GF=point and C2.GF=point. We 
consider Idspa(C1, C2) if and only if Euclidean distance 
dE(C1,C2) =0. The function of spatial identity relationship is 
defined as follows: 
 
    (1) 
(2
) 
 
                          (2) 
3.2    The mapping phase 
The input of this phase is two concepts from both 
candidate ontologies. The mapping process is iterative and 
consists of two steps. The first step is to investigate Identity 
relationships and the second step is to investigate Enrichment 
relationships between candidate concepts. The search for 
enrichment relationships is performed on non-identical 
concepts selected at the previous phase. The compared 
concepts and their correspondences are stored in a base of 
matches. Concepts which the mapping algorithm found no 
connections between them, i.e. the concepts that do not 
verify any type of relationship between them (called 
unrelated concepts) are stored in a base of unrelated 
concepts. 
We have defined rules to optimize the number of 
comparisons of concepts in order to avoid a randomly 
process. For example, to research identity relationship, we 
rely on the type of the graphic form of the concept to make 
comparisons.  
3.3    The merging phase 
The merging phase consists in building the ontology 
result. The input of this phase is composed of bases of 
correspondences and unrelated concepts. The aim of this 
module is to apply the correspondence links stored at the 
correspondences bases (semantic and geographical) in 
accordance with merging techniques. The merging process 
creates a new geographical ontology from two candidate 
ontologies connected by identity concepts which are used as 
connected points between the two ontologies and enriched 
by the semantic and geographical relationships. 
Rules for merging candidate concepts are defined. These 
rules are of two types: rules for semantic relationships and 
rules for spatial relationships. The merging rules are applied 
to concepts accepting connections between them. Unrelated 
concepts are transmitted in the ontology result without any 
treatment. 
IV. 
SOIT: SPATIAL ONTOLOGIES INTEGRATION TOOL 
We have developed the SOIT tool (Spatial Ontologies 
Integration Tool) (Figure 2) based on Java language and the 
integrated development environment (IDE) NetBeans. The 
tool is designed for automatically merge two spatial 
ontologies. SOIT takes as input two spatial ontologies 
written in OWL and produces as result an ontology spatially 
and semantically richer. In addition, SOIT allows other 
functions: it can perform two types of matching candidate 
ontologies and see the result of the matching process. It can 
also generate the graph of an ontology written in OWL and 
view or print one ontology in the form of a text or a graph. 
We model a use case diagram of UML language representing 
the various functionalities of the SOIT tool (Figure 2).

The host interface of SOIT includes a menu bar contains 
five menus: “File”, “View”, “Match”, “Merge” and “Help”. 
The matching process starts with the introduction of two 
candidate ontologies (figure 3).

After running the matching process, the system displays 
the list of matches found. This functionality is performed 
using XSLT style sheets (figure 5). For example, we have 
identified a relationship of type Extremity between 
individuals: 
Priority_R1_Tunis_Teniour 
and 
BW1_Teniour_Kaied.

clicking on the button “Browse”. The following window 
displays (Figure 6).

APPLICATION TO THE ROAD DOMAIN 
The application domain of the developed spatial 
ontologies integration tool is the road domain. We 
developed two spatial ontologies related to the city of Sfax 
(Tunisia), called respectively ontoRoadChihia.owl and 
ontoRoadSfax.owl instances of the OntoRoad ontology [1] 
which is developed to model the road domain concepts .  
The studied corpus is composed of topographic maps. 
The instantiation of the OntoRoad ontology is made by 
geographical zone. Both candidate ontologies subject of 
experiment cover different geographical zones from the city 
of Sfax (Tunisia). We extract all the objects of the 
considered 
zone 
and 
we 
attribute 
them 
to 
their 
corresponding 
classes. 
For 
example, 
the 
object 
Hedi_Chaker is a Street; the street Ibn_kholdoun is one-
way. 
The following extract presents the modelling of the 
individual “RL911” of the concept “Local_Road” in the 
ontology ontoRoadChihia.owl (Table I).

VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The need to combine ontologies developed in an 
independent way and containing heterogeneity, raised 
problems from the point of view of the ontological 
language, the conceptualization and the specification. The 
heterogeneity between the knowledge expressed within each 
of the ontologies treating the same domain must be 
resolved. Several solutions to produce much more 
successful ontologies were proposed and varied techniques 
were developed for the adaptation, the merging and the 
integration. The integration is the construction of a new 
ontology reusing the other available ontologies which will 
be a part of the new ontology. The logical integration of two 
ontologies supplies to the user a vision unified by various 
sources. 
In this paper, we have presented an approach for 
merging geographic ontologies. This approach consists of 
three processes: (1) the matching process, (2) the mapping 
process and (3) the merging process. We also developed 
SOIT: a tool for spatial ontologies integration. The 
application of this tool has been made on the road domain. 
Our ongoing work are to evaluate “SOIT” by comparing the 
result produced by this tool with the one developed by an 
expert in the field. In future work, we aim at extending this 
tool with functionalities for query ontological data bases.
