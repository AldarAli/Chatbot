Abstract—The shift towards use of the 5 GHz band by WiFi
networks comes with the requirement that these networks coexist
safely with existing systems using that band, e.g., meteorology,
aeronautics or military radars. Regulatory bodies are mandating
the implementation of Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) in
wireless communication protocols to (i) detect radar operations
and (ii) move away from channels populated by these. Conven-
tional approaches to implementing such mechanisms, however,
can result in massive underutilization of the radio channel since
the radio must be kept silent for a large amount of time in
order to ensure sufﬁcient detection accuracy. This inevitably
impacts the throughput capacity of the wireless network. In this
paper, we consider whether bit-error patterns at the receiver of
a WiFi link can be used for radar detection. In our experimental
study, we adopt a pair-packet transmission technique to mitigate
the interference inherent to the 802.11 protocol due to, e.g.,
other contending stations. Our initial results show that the
observation of bit-error patterns due to radar interferences is
indeed possible, establishing that the potential exists to design
unobtrusive detection mechanisms that work transparently with
existing network protocols without loss of network capacity.

INTRODUCTION
The growing density of radio frequency (RF) transceivers
operating in the ISM 2.4 GHz band (Industrial, Scientiﬁc and
Medical radio band) is placing increasing pressure on the
limited spectral resources available (up to 13 channels spaced
5 MHz apart) for e.g., IEEE 802.11b/g [1], ZigBee [2] or
Bluetooth [3] users. This is encouraging greater utilization of
the wider 5 GHz band (up to 25 channels of 20 MHz) for
newer WiFi standards, ﬁrst with IEEE 802.11n and ultimately
with the advent of IEEE 802.11ac [4] which only uses this
band.
The trend towards utilization of the 5 GHz band in com-
modity wireless devices potentially impacts the functioning
of pre-existing communication systems, e.g. meteorological
radars [5]. Weather radars periodically emit unidirectional
electromagnetic pulses and listen for echoes, e.g., reﬂected by
raindrops. Fig. 1 illustrates the regular behavior of a radar
that emits bursts of pulses separated by a time equal to TP R.
For each transmitted pulse, the radar processes the echoes
for a measurement time Tmeas and then remains idle for
an Inter-Measurement Gap time TIMG before the next pulse
is transmitted. For example, Fig. 2 shows measured weather
radar traces taken with a Rohde & Schwarz FSL-6 spectrum
analyzer near to Dublin airport in Ireland. These measurements
show bursts of electromagnetic pulses, with 3ms inter-pulse
separation time. From Fig. 2(b) it can be seen that on a
larger time-scale the amplitude of transmissions is periodic in
nature, with a period of approximately 20s. This is attributed
to periodic rotation of the radar antenna, with high amplitudes
corresponding to intervals when the radar antenna is directed
towards the spectrum analyzer.

In order to facilitate coexistence, Dynamic Frequency Se-
lection (DFS) is enforced for unlicensed devices, e.g., through
FCC [6] regulations in North America and ETSI [7] regulations
in Europe. To meet these regulatory requirements, the IEEE
802.11h [1] amendment introduces DFS to the IEEE 802.11
PHY/MAC standard. However, although the 802.11h speciﬁes
the mechanisms for supporting DFS, the ultimate responsibility
for implementing efﬁcient radar detection schemes lies with
the device manufacturer.
DFS mandates that the master device (e.g., the Access
Point in a WLAN) monitors the channel for potential radar
interference for at least the channel availability check time.
A major issue with this requirement is that no transmissions
can occur during this check time, which may be up to 10
minutes duration for some channels [7]. A further issue is
that, even after the check time has elapsed, when using half-
duplex radios, radar detection cannot be carried out while
data is being transmitted/received. Hence, radar detection in
future dense (and heavily loaded) wireless networks is likely
to be problematic. Moreover, weather radar technology keeps

changing, with more complex and faster scan patterns that
inﬂate the ratio of false positives in legacy wireless devices,
scaling up dramatically the amount of sensing time needed and
so of channel unavailability.
In this paper, we present initial results of our experimen-
tal evaluation of radar detection through in-service bit-error
pattern recognition. The ability to detect (and react to) the
presence of radar signals while a transmission is ongoing not
only offers the potential to increase the spectrum efﬁciency,
but also to improve the reliability of radar detection in heavily
loaded networks.
The rest of the paper is structured as follow. A brief survey
of related literature is given in Section II, the description
of the experimental methodology in Section III, and a set
of representative results in Section IV. Finally, in Section V
we discuss the open issues to resolve in future work, and
Section VI concludes the paper.

RELATED WORK
Most of the related literature focuses on the design of
off-line detectors. For instance, in [8] the authors develop
a detector based on Compressive Sensing (CS), while [9]
designs a radar detector based on a Constant False Alarm
Rate (CFAR) and a Complex Approximate Message Passing
(CAMP) algorithm. [10] evaluates a few algorithms based on
a matched ﬁltering technique and propose a method based on
power detection in the time domain. However, these detectors,
if implemented in a regular wireless device with a half-
duplex transceiver, could only work while communication is
not ongoing, which limits its applicability as explained above.
The coexistence between IEEE 802.11 transceivers imple-
menting DFS and radars has been studied in [5], [11]. These
evaluate DFS in the presence of a Doppler weather radar
system and show that the 802.11 radio introduces an additive
and uncorrelated noise into the radar system.
A few works analyze the radar detection probabilities.
Within the FCC and ETSI standards, the computation of the
detection probability was carried out initially using a basic
random transmission model [12]. The authors of [13] perform
a theoretical evaluation of the detection of radar pulses in time
division duplexed systems, and compute the expected number
of pulses occurring during the receive period of a transmission.
In contrast to all previous works, this paper is, to the best
of our knowledge, the ﬁrst attempt to experimentally assess
radar detection via bit-error recognition over received packets.
III.
METHODOLOGY
The key idea is to search for radar interference footprints,
via inspection of bit error patterns, while packet processing is
ongoing at the receiver. Fig. 3 illustrates this idea with a burst
of eleven pulses (at the bottom) and three examples of data
packet communication with different packet rates and lengths
(at the top). Those packets, transmitted concurrently with one
or more radar pulses, will be disrupted by a burst of bit errors
(shown in black in the ﬁgure). The observation of this footprint,
jointly with the knowledge of the underlying radar process,
should make possible the detection of radar signals.

The ﬁrst step to study the feasibility of bit-error pattern
recognition for radar detection requires a controlled envi-
ronment. To this end, we programmed a Rohde&Schwarz
SMBV100A vector signal generator to emulate the behavior
of a radar. Unless otherwise stated, each pulse width is set to
1 µs, PRF = 1/TP R = 1000 s−1 and we send bursts of
15 pulses, to mimic the behavior of a radar test signal type
2 [7]. Given the traces collected with our spectrum analyzer
when our “radar emulator” is in operation, shown in Fig. 4,
and their similarity with respect to those of Fig. 2, we validate
this set-up for our experiments.
One of the main challenges in the detection of errors caused
by the operation of radars is the ability to distinguish these
from other sources of error, for instance those caused by
another transmitter within the same WLAN, i.e., collisions.
Collisions are part of the correct operation of the CSMA/CA
MAC protocol in IEEE 802.11 and are caused by two or more
stations selecting the same slot to transmit during the random
backoff procedure. If a station is successful (i.e., its backoff
counter reached zero before other senders), the other stations
will defer their backoff while the channel is not idle. The
physical layer (PHY) implements a Clear Channel Assessment
(CCA) scheme based on a carrier-sense threshold for energy
detection, and the MAC uses a Network Allocation Vector
(NAV) parameter transported in each header to inform other
stations about the duration of the ongoing transmission. A
channel is idle only if the CCA fails to detect a carrier and
if the NAV timer is zero. However, collisions are not the
only cause of packet impairment. Nodes that are too far to
be able to decode the NAV of concurrent transmissions whose
energy level is below the CCA threshold (i.e., hidden nodes)
could cause errors in theoretically successful transmissions as
well. In order to narrow down the sources of interference to
just those due to radar coexistence, we applied the technique
proposed in [14]. To this end, we force each packet to be
fragmented at the MAC layer to ensure that the second and
subsequent fragments are protected from both collisions and

hidden nodes. The protection against collisions is granted by
the NAV value used in the ﬁrst fragment, which is set to
the amount of time required to send all the fragments. Each
fragment is sent back-to-back (separated by a SIFS interval)
to the AP and individually acknowledged by the AP; given
the fact that all stations should be able to hear the AP’s
transmissions, and therefore the NAV value carried within the
acknowledgment frames, these fragments are protected against
hidden nodes (similarly to the RTS/CTS scheme).

We have run two simple experiments to validate this
methodology; the results are shown in Fig. 5. In both ex-
periments, we conﬁgure a laptop as a WiFi AP transmitting
test trafﬁc to another laptop, conﬁgured as a WiFi client. The
AP sends 50 bursts of 3000 ICMP packets, with 1150 bytes
of payload, generated with SING, an ICMP-packet generator
which allows customization of the transmitted packets. The
transmission power is set to 16dBm and we set a fragmentation
threshold of 600 bytes to force the delivery of 2 fragments
per packet (i.e., the ﬁrst has to contend for channel access, the
second is protected against collisions and hidden nodes). In the
ﬁrst experiment, the AP transmits the test trafﬁc towards the
client, while we increase the number of additional contending
stations to the network. Fig. 5a depicts the ratio of bit errors
for each of the pair of packets sent in each transmission
opportunity. As we can see, the ﬁrst fragment is severely
affected by the growing number of collisions incurred by the
additional contending stations. On the other hand, the second
fragment is unaffected by this type of interference source. In

the second experiment we switch the additional contending
stations for the signal generator, to generate synthetic RF
noise. Fig. 5b shows the error rate as a function of the power
of the noise generated. The results indicate that both the
ﬁrst and second fragment experience the same effects upon a
noisy environment. These two experiments serve as validation
for this technique to identify bit-error patterns due to radar
signals while excluding those inherent to the IEEE 802.11
MAC protocol. In the following, we will apply this technique,
along with our radar emulator, to study the bit-error patterns
in received frames and its feasibility in the detection of radars
in the environment.

MEASUREMENTS
We set up two laptops with an IEEE 802.11b/g Atheros
AR5008 wireless card each using the driver madwiﬁ 0.9.6
and separated by 100cm. Note that we have disabled the
IEEE 802.11.h capabilities from the driver to avoid that the
legacy DFS operation affecting channel selection upon the
observation of our radar signals. One laptop serves as WiFi
AP and the other as a regular client. Each experiment consists
of the transmission of a stream of packets from the AP to the
client. Each UDP packet transports a 1796-byte payload with
known information, which allows us to assess the error patterns
occurring at the receiver. In the following, we summarize
our initial results where we compare the trace given by the
spectrum analyzer and the error pattern found in selected
packets.
In the ﬁrst experiment, each packet is sent at 1 Mbps (so
they are of relatively long duration). Fig. 6 top shows how the
end of a packet transmission collides with one pulse from the
beginning of a radar burst. In Fig. 6 bottom we illustrate the
results of the packet inspection at the receiver. We mark the
beginning of the payload (the part that we process), each bit
error found after decoding (we also zoom in the burst of errors)
and the end of the packet. This ﬁgure shows that the footprint
of the colliding radar pulse is clearly observable. However, in
this case, the observation of one burst of errors is not sufﬁcient
to infer the presence of a radar signal.

Fig. 7 shows the resulting packet processing of another
packet sent at 1 Mbps where two pulses of a radar signal
corrupts the payload of the data transmission. We can easily
identify the radar footprint out of the packet inspection, i.e.,
two bursts of errors separated by 1ms (PRF of our test radar
signal) with pulses of approximately 1µs duration.
We now conﬁgure the AP to transmit 6-Mbps packets. Sim-
ilarly as before, Fig 8 depicts the results for a selected packet
of this experiment which is corrupted by two radar pulses. This
result allows a similar observation as in the previous case, that
is, we found two burst of bit errors of approximately 1µs of
duration and separated by 1ms, matching the characteristics
of the underlying radar test signal.

OPEN QUESTIONS
The experiments we have carried out so far unveil a clear
footprint from radar interference which is observable while a
packet reception is being processed. However, the heteroge-
neous (and random) nature of real-life data packet communi-
cations makes the actual design of a practical algorithm for
radar detection through bit-error pattern recognition inherently
challenging. The major challenge is indeed to discern the
constant rate footprint of radar bursts from a decoupled data
transmission, i.e., with independent rate/size distribution.
Fig. 3 illustrates this with three examples with different
packet rates and packet lengths (although packet rate and
length are constant in these examples, which will not be the
case in general). First, a single large packet might be enough
to observe a constant error burst rate that would trigger a
radar presence alarm. However, the case with short packets
requires a longer-term observation. Second, the analysis of
consecutive packets from a high packet rate transmission could
also be sufﬁcient. However, slower rates (and/or heterogeneous
distributions) might hide the presence of a radar given that
most of its bursts could coincide with idle inter-frame spaces,
not causing bit errors.

CONCLUSIONS
Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) is a mandatory
scheme for wireless communication protocols operating in
the 5 Ghz band in order to mitigate the interference caused
to coexistent systems such as radars. Unfortunately, conven-
tional implementations may cause severe underutilization of
resources and poor performance in heavy loaded networks.
Motivated by this observation, we explore the feasibility of
radar detection via duly observation of bit-error patterns in
received packets. In this paper, we present the initial results
of our experimental evaluation and discuss a series of open
questions that need to be resolved to design an effective in-
service detection mechanism.
