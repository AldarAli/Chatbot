Abstract—The realisation of cost-efﬁcient Optical Burst
Switching (OBS) networks can be greatly facilitated from
minimising the number of contention resolution resources
required at congested network nodes. In this paper we present
a Fibre Delay Line (FDL) optimal allocation scheme where
the total cost associated to the employment of FDLs is
minimised subject to performance requirements deﬁned in
terms of maximum tolerable end-to-end blocking probability.
The optimal buffer conﬁguration is achieved by means of a
constraint-handling genetic algorithm. We additionally increase
the accuracy of our analysis by considering the non-Poissonian
trafﬁc characteristics of the OBS network under study. Results
show that our method permits to identify an optimal FDL
conﬁguration that minimises the total buffer installation cost
and simultaneously satisﬁes the network blocking probability
requirements.

I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years substantial research effort has been de-
voted to the performance evaluation of network architectures
employing Optical Burst Switching [1], one of the most
promising switching strategies for the deployment of next
generation optical networks. A major drawback in OBS is
due to burst loss which occurs when two packets (bursts) are
contending for the same wavelength channel on a common
output ﬁbre link. This issue can be addressed with the
employment of Fibre Delay Lines (FDLs) [1], [2]. An FDL
can be considered as a buffer in the time domain and is
capable of preventing burst loss by delaying the transmission
of one of the contending bursts. It has been demonstrated
that FDLs can be very effective in reducing burst loss of
several orders of magnitude as shown in works such as [2],
[3] and [4], where performance evaluations of buffered OBS
architectures have been conducted. The overall performance
of an FDL-buffered OBS network might vary considerably
depending on how many FDLs are employed and their allo-
cation in the network. In non-uniform network topologies
some links of the network may be congested more than
others even under uniform end-to-end trafﬁc demands. This
means that some links may require more buffering resources
than others resulting in a non-uniform allocation of FDLs
in the network, however, the problem can not be solved by
simply adding FDL buffers to bottleneck links. In fact, the
employment of an FDL might shift the trafﬁc load from
a congested link to the next link over the same path, thus
potentially shifting the “congestion problem”.
In this paper we address this issue by proposing a method
to ﬁnd an optimal FDL allocation that minimises the cost
associated to the buffers employment and, at the same time,
satisﬁes a maximum tolerable end-to-end blocking probabil-
ity. We solve this problem by means of genetic algorithms
[5], a branch of evolutionary algorithms that have been
already successfully used to solve different optimisation
problems for photonic switched networks. For example, in
[6] the authors develop a genetic algorithm to jointly solve
a Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) problem for
optical networks. A similar method has been derived in
[7], where the authors solve an RWA problem for Optical
Packet Switching (OPS) networks with load balancing. Yang
et al. propose in [8] a multi-objective genetic algorithm to
simultaneously minimise the delay while maximising the
throughput for metro optical networks. Differently from
these works, our main contribution is in applying a genetic
algorithm to solve a cost minimisation problem where the
decision variables deﬁne the allocation of the FDL wave-
length channels. Castro et al. focus on a similar problem in
[9] where they derive a method to ﬁnd an optimal placement
of the FDLs in OBS networks with Tabu Search, however,
differently from [9], we decide to use a different OBS node
buffered architecture [3] and a more realistic and accurate
network model as proposed in [10]. The rest of the paper
is organised as follows: in Section II, we brieﬂy describe
the architecture and the analytic model of the OBS network
under study. In Section III, we deﬁne a cost minimisation
problem for the OBS network in question and in Section IV
we describe the genetic algorithm used to solve it. Results
and conclusions are respectively given in Section V and VI.
II. THE OBS NETWORK UNDER STUDY
We consider the Tune And Select with Shared feedback
FDL (TAS-shFDL) OBS node architecture analysed in [3]
and illustrated in Figure 1(a). The switch is equipped with

P input/output ports, each one connected to an optical ﬁbre
link comprising W wavelength channels. We assume full
wavelength conversion, that is each channel is supported by
a Tunable Wavelength Converter (TWC) for burst contention
resolution. Additionally, an extra input/output port is dedi-
cated to an FDL comprising K wavelength channels. We
refer to these channels as virtual buffers as described in [2].
The FDL is shared between the output links connected to
the node in a feedback conﬁguration [3]. This means that a
contention between two bursts will be resolved by directing
one of the bursts to a free virtual buffer of the FDL and
then re-offering it to a free wavelength channel of the output
port. If this is not possible, the burst will be dropped and
consequently lost from the system.
We consider an OBS network of such switches described
by a graph G(N, L, R), where N is the number of nodes, L
is the number of links and R is the number of paths of the
network. All links comprise the same number of wavelength
channels W. Each path r is offered with burst trafﬁc of load
ρr (in Erlang). We further deﬁne ρ= [ρ1, ρ2, . . . , ρR] as the
vector comprising the burst trafﬁc loads offered to each path.
We characterise the burst trafﬁc as a non-Poisson process by
assuming generally distributed burst interarrival times and
exponentially distributed burst lengths. We attempt to model
the trafﬁc characteristics with the BPP two-moment match-
ing technique [11] by considering the additional contribution
of the trafﬁc peakedness Z. The peakedness quantiﬁes the
deviation of the burst trafﬁc from being Poisson and is
deﬁned as the ratio between the variance and the load of
the burst trafﬁc. The trafﬁc is said to be peaked or smooth
whether Z is greater or less than one. If Z = 1 the
trafﬁc is Poisson. This analysis allows us to approximately
match the expected OBS trafﬁc characteristics, which are
largely determined by the burst aggregation process [12].
Further results on the impact of trafﬁc burstiness in optical
packet switching networks can be found in [13]. Under these
premises, we model the OBS network with the approximate
method proposed by the present authors in [10]. The model
is used to evaluate end-to-end burst blocking probabilities
and can generally be summarised as a non linear function
whose output is the vector P= [P1, . . . PR], where Pr is
the end-to-end blocking probability of path r. Namely,
P = P(N, L, R, W, K, ρ, Z),
(1)
where we have indicated with Z = [Z1, . . . ZR] the vector
of the burst trafﬁc peakednesses offered to each path and
with K = [K1, . . . , KN] the vector comprising the number
of virtual buffers allocated to each node in the network.
For space constraints we can not provide a description of
the method in this paper. The reader will ﬁnd a detailed
mathematical analysis and the validation of our method in
[10], however we show here some additional new results
in Figures 2 and 3. Particularly, the average end-to-end
burst blocking probability obtained with our analytic model
is compared with the one obtained from a discrete-event
simulation of the OBS European Optical Network (EON)
topology depicted in Figure 1(b). The network comprises
N = 15 nodes, L = 25 bidirectional links and R = 18
source-destination pairs whose shortest paths are indicated
in Table I. The FDL allocation is uniform, thus all nodes are
equipped with the same number of virtual buffers. The trafﬁc
demands are uniform as well, that is each path is offered
with the same trafﬁc load and peakedness. As we can see
from the graphs the accuracy of the analytic model compares
favourably with the simulation data for a broad range of
end-to-end blocking probability, a feature that convinces us
to adopt our model for the deﬁnition and the solution of the
cost minimisation problem.
III. DEFINITION OF THE OPTIMISATION PROBLEM
We ﬁrst start by introducing the cost function that will
be used to deﬁne the objective of the optimisation problem.
Our goal is to determine an estimate of the cost introduced
by the employment of a shared FDL in a node of the
network. Following the analysis presented in [3] on the

TAS-shFDL architecture, we note that the installation of an
extra input/output port dedicated to the FDL requires one
additional Erbium Doped Fibre Ampliﬁer (EDFA). Further-
more, since we are assuming full wavelength conversion,
each wavelength channel of the FDL must employ a TWC,
for a total of Kn TWCs. Finally, in order to allow the
transmission of burst packets to the FDL, each wavelength
channel on each output port must be equipped with an
additional Semiconductor Optical Ampliﬁer (SOA), for a
total of Pn · W SOAs, where we have indicated with Pn
the number of output ports of node n. Similarly, in order to
send packets to the output ports, each wavelength channel
of the FDL requires Pn SOAs for a total of Pn · Kn SOAs.
Under these premises, we deﬁne the total cost associated
with an FDL to node n as follows,
Cn = hE + hT Kn + hSPn(W + Kn),
(2)
where we have denoted with hE, hT and hS respectively
the unit cost of an EDFA, of a TWC and of a SOA. Finally,
the total cost arising from the employment of FDLs in the
network can be expressed as

following problem:
Given an OBS network deﬁned by graph G(N, L, R)

and where the trafﬁc demands for each path are quantiﬁed
by vectors ρ and Z, we want to minimise the cost function

subject to
Pr(K) ≤ Pmax,
r = 1, . . . , R,

n = 1, . . . , N,
(4)
where we have indicated with Pmax the maximum tolerable
end-to-end blocking probability and with Kmax the maxi-
mum number of virtual buffers that can be allocated in a
node of the network. Furthermore, we force the number of
virtual buffers to be positive integers. We solve the above
deﬁned problem with the use of a genetic algorithm as
described in the next section.
IV. GENETIC ALGORITHM
Genetic algorithms (GAs) [5] are a branch of evolution-
ary algorithms, a family of search heuristics that mimics
the process of evolution to ﬁnd near-optimal solutions for
optimisation problems. In a GA, each potential solution cor-
responds to a string of decision variables called an individual
(or chromosome) where each decision variable represents a
gene. The algorithm starts by generating an initial random
population of individuals. A set of individuals is selected
from the population to form a new generation on the basis
on “how suitable” they are as solutions of the optimisation
problem. The “goodness” of the selected individuals is
evaluated by a speciﬁc ﬁtness function which is typically
deﬁned as a combination of the objective functions of the
optimisation problem in question. In this way, the better
individuals have more chances to “reproduce” and transfer
their “good” genes to their children (offspring) that will form
a better new generation, mimicking the evolution process.
The algorithm normally ends when a user-deﬁned maximum
number of generations is reached or when some conditions
on the improvement achieved by the best individuals are
met.
A. Initial Population and Encoding
In our problem, each individual corresponds to a speciﬁc
allocation of FDLs K. Each element of K is the number
of wavelength channels of an FDL at a given node and
represents a gene of the individual. All the individuals are
encoded directly into strings of integer numbers with values
in the range [0, Kmax]. Note that the encoding process
forces the potential solutions to be integrals and within the
interval [0, Kmax]. Therefore, the constraints Kn ≤ Kmax
and Kn ∈ N for n = 1, . . . , N are already satisﬁed by the
process of encoding of the individuals.

B. Fitness function and Selection
The ﬁtness function evaluates the “goodness” of an indi-
vidual. The greater is the ﬁtness value of an individual, the
higher is the probability that the individual will be selected
for “reproduction”. Generally, in constrained optimisation
problems, the ﬁtness function of each individual is modiﬁed
by introducing a non-zero penalty function for the solutions
that are unfeasible, that is the solutions that do not satisfy the
constraints of the optimisation problem. We adopt a simple
yet very efﬁcient method inspired by the work of Deb in
[14]. Particularly, the ﬁtness function f of an individual K
can be written as
f(K) =
(
−C(K)
if K is feasible,
−C(K−) − |Pr(K) − Pmax|
if K is unfeasible,
(5)
where we have indicated with K− the feasible FDL allo-
cation with the lowest ﬁtness in the population and with
|Pr(K) − Pmax| the constraint violation of individual K
representing the penalty function for r = 1, . . . , R. At
each generation, the ﬁtness of all individuals is evaluated
and a set of “good” candidate solutions are selected to
“reproduce”. The selection process is a key operation in
genetic algorithms and there are several mechanisms to
perform it. We decide to select individuals with the roulette
wheel technique [5] where the ﬁttest individuals have more
chances to be chosen for reproduction. Particularly we ﬁrst
normalise the ﬁtness value of all the individuals of the
population as
f ∗
i = fi/
I
X
i=1
fi
i = 1, . . . , I,
(6)
where I is the number of individuals in the population and
fi is the ﬁtness of individual i. Then, we sort the ﬁtness
values in ascending order (denoting them with t∗
i ) and we
generate a random number ǫ uniformly distributed within the
interval [0,1]. If ǫ < t∗
1, we select individual 1 as a parent
for reproduction. If ǫ > t∗
1, we calculate the cumulative
sum s1 = t∗
1 + t∗
2 and we compare again ǫ with s1. At
this point, if ǫ < s1, we select individual 2 otherwise we
recursively re-calculate the cumulative sum s2 = s1+t∗
3 and
proceed with the next comparison in a similar manner until
two individuals will be selected as parents.
C. Crossover, Mutation and Elitism
Once the individuals have been selected, they reproduce to
generate a new offspring. This step of the algorithm is called
crossover and is performed with a user-deﬁned probability
Probc. We choose to perform a two-point crossover where
the new offspring inherits genes from the parents on the basis
of two random crossover points as illustrated in Figure 4.
Once the new children are generated, we mutate them
by randomly changing one of their genes with a predeﬁned

mutation probability Probm. The mutation is an essential
step in GAs that helps preserving the diversity in the
population and prevents the GA to get stuck in a local
minimum.
In the ﬁnal step of the algorithm, once the new generation
is obtained, we select a speciﬁc number of individuals E
with the highest values of ﬁtness and we include them in the
new generation. This ﬁnal step is known as elitism and the
set of chosen individuals is called the elite. This procedure
permits us to keep the best E individuals in the population
as the algorithm continues its search for ﬁtter solutions.
V. RESULTS
We test our method on the same network topology of
Figure 1(b). The conﬁguration settings for the genetic algo-
rithm are shown in Table II. The values of Probc and Probm
are proved to generally work well for different optimisation
problems. The estimation of the hardware unit costs hS, hE
and hT is quite difﬁcult as real costs for these devices
vary considerably on the basis of their manufacturer and
their speciﬁcations. Based on the study proposed in papers
such as [15] and [16] we decided that it may be reasonable
to relate all unit costs to the one of a SOA, being the
SOA a device less expensive than an EDFA and a TWC.
Thus, we set the unit cost of a SOA as hS = 1 and we
decide to ﬁx the unit cost of an EDFA at 3hS and the
unit cost of a TWC at 15hS. We stop the genetic algorithm
after 300 generations. Table III and Table IV illustrate the
beneﬁts introduced by the optimisation in terms of cost
savings subject to different values of Pmax for different
values of trafﬁc load and peakedness. We ﬁrst note how

the cost varies considerably with Z, an occurence that, we
believe, justiﬁes the choice of modelling the OBS network
with the analytic method proposed in [10]. We compare
the total FDL cost resulting from our optimisation method
(COP T ) with the total cost resulting from the minimum
uniform allocation of the virtual buffers that satisﬁes the
requirements in terms of Pmax (CUNI). For example, in
Table IV, to reach a maximum target blocking probability
Pmax of 10−2 on all paths for Z = 1.4, the optimal numbers
of FDLs are found to be Kopt=[0 8 0 10 4 6 10 4 0 10
10 4 0 0 4], resulting in a total cost of COP T = 2178.
The same performance requirements can be satisﬁed with a
uniform allocation of no less than 10 buffers in each node,
for a total cost of CUNI = 3891. Thus, for this particular
scenario, the optimisation process yields a 44% reduction
in cost of the extra hardware added by the employment of
FDLs compared to a uniform FDL allocation. Furthermore,
following [3], we can also estimate the achieved reduction in
the total hardware cost of the network with the same optimal
buffer allocation. In fact, in the bufferless TAS OBS node
architecture (that is, without considering the extra hardware
added by the FDL), a node n is equipped with 2Pn EDFAs,
W · Pn TWCs and W · P 2
n SOAs. If we consider the cost
of this additional hardware in the OBS network under study
for all nodes of the same scenario above mentioned, we
obtain a total hardware network cost of COP T = 24294
for the optimal allocation Kopt and CUNI = 26007 for the
uniform allocation of 10 buffers per node, resulting in an
approximate total hardware cost saving percentage of 6.6%.
We also note that for some scenarios it is not possible
to ﬁnd an optimal (and uniform) allocation of the FDLs
(e.g., Table III for Z = 1.4 and Pmax = 10−3). This
is because all the solutions found are unfeasible, that is
there is no FDL allocation that can satisfy the performance
requirements given by Pr(K) ≤ Pmax for r = 1, . . . , R
with Kn ≤ Kmax for all nodes of the network.
Figure 5 illustrates an example of the distribution of the
FDL virtual buffers in the OBS network. We observe that
the FDL distribution changes considerably with Z, since
congestion at nodes increases when trafﬁc becomes peaked.
Note that some nodes are not assigned with FDLs, regardless
of the peakedness of their offered trafﬁc demands. Thus, the
genetic algorithm is able to identify the nodes of the network
for which adding an FDL does not add any contribution
in lowering the end-to-end blocking probability value. In
this regard we want to remark that, although the offered
load may be generally considered low in all the cases of
study (0.3-0.35 Erlang), this is not the case for congested
links in the core network, where it can reach normalised
values of 0.6 Erlang. The algorithm allows to determine
the optimal number of FDL buffers required for nodes with
such congested links, a number that is higher than the one
determined for the less congested links at the edges of the
network. This feature may consent to considerably decrease
the FDL cost compared to an uniform allocation as shown
in the example of Figure 6. In this particular case, to satisfy
the performance requirements, at least 4 FDL buffers must
be employed to node 7. This means that, in an uniform
allocation, we must employ at least 4 FDL buffers for each
node of the network, resulting in an increased FDL cost per
network node compared to the optimal scenario.
Finally, end-to-end blocking probabilities for each path
are shown in Figure 7. We observe that the analytic method
provides a quite accurate estimate of the blocking probability
at the optimal point compared to simulation data. The graph

Z = 1. Note that all blocking values compare favourably with simulation
results and they are all below the required performance level given by
Pmax = 10−3. The optimal FDL allocation for this particular scenario is
found to be K=[0 6 0 7 6 7 8 6 0 6 6 6 0 0 6].
additionally shows that each path blocking is below the
maximum tolerable value given by Pmax, thus satisfying
the performance constraint of our optimisation problem.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
We have proposed a method to ﬁnd an optimal allocation
of FDLs in an OBS network that minimises the cost as-
sociated with the employment of FDL-buffers and satisﬁes
performance requirements in terms of maximum tolerable
end-to-end blocking probability. Our results illustrate the
potential equipment cost savings achieved when FDL al-
location is optimised as opposed to uniformly distributing
the number of buffers in the network. Future works will
deal with the deﬁnition of multi-objective optimisation prob-
lems for OBS networks where conﬂicting objectives such
as throughput maximisation and cost minimisation will be
taken into consideration.
