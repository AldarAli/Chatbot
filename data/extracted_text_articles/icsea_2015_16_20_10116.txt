Abstract— The small and medium enterprises (SME’s)  
have a low level of survival and are facing serious 
problems like access to financing, weak management 
capacity, poor information about market opportunities, 
limited information about access to innovation and 
research funds, new technologies and methods of work 
organization, the integration of its key processes into 
information and communication technologies (ICT’s). The 
methodology of Enterprise Architecture (EA) can provide  
a model of integration supported with strategic planning, 
integrated by partial  architectures like business, data, 
applications and technology. In this study case, we are 
providing information that was collected from different 
sources of a medium manufacturing firm to design and 
implement an  EA. As a result we get to the identification 
of strategic changes supported by the methodology, the 
assessment of option for change, and a change plan for the 
adoption of the methodology in their processes; those 
processes must improve their competitiveness and 
productivity. 
 
Keywords-Enterprise architecture; Strategic planning; 
Manufacturing companies. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION  
 
The EA is a methodology which is looking to 
provide a framework for the companies, for the use of 
the information in the processes of the business [1]. EA 
consist of methodological frameworks, architectural 
frameworks, technologies and standards [2]. The 
identification of the key processes of the companies in 
the manufacturing sector located in the areas of 
marketing, engineering, logistics, productivity and 
business 
management, 
will 
provide 
important 
guidelines for the design of the EA. Studies conducted 
by 
researchers 
in 
Germany 
indicate 
that 
the 
administration of the EA is a factor that leads to 
changes in the companies. They found the impact of 5 
dimensions to take advantage of the benefits derived 
from the EA [3]: 
 
Quality of the EA 
 
Quality of the infrastructure of the EA 
 
Quality of service of EA 
 
Culture of EA 
 
Use of the EA 
The five dimensions are important to achieve a 
successful EA, with the realization of benefits measured 
by the EA Benefit Realization Model (EABRM) [3]. 
EA is used as a strategic tool and a mechanism to 
support the alignment between business strategy and 
ICT’s. It also represents a change in the organizational 
learning, and not just a change of intellectual learning, 
but learning to cooperate and share information across 
the entire enterprise [4]. It enables companies to 
achieve a logical balance between technological 
efficiency 
and 
innovation 
seeking 
competitive 
advantages. Therefore it is necessary to create strategic 
solutions to enhance the capabilities of enterprises and 
respond with agility to the challenges, be they business 
or technology, that today's markets require. 
The SME’s are major generator of employment in  
Mexico (7 of 10 jobs are provided by them) [5]. The 
design and implementation of EA in support of the 
strategy of SME’s in the manufacturing business sector, 
will increase the competitiveness and productivity of 
these companies. 
The main purpose of this article is designing and 
implementing an EA for SME’s for the manufacturing 
sector that support the innovation and competitiveness 
in 
the 
national 
and 
global 
market 
through 
methodologies, 
frameworks, 
technologies, 
and, 
standards. This research can be replicated in SME’s in 
the manufacturing sector of metalworking. 
This paper is structured as follows: In Section II the 
state of the art is presented. In Section III, partial 
architectures, business, application, and technology are 
described. Also, the values of the company for the study 
are stated. Section IV describes the principal findings of 
the study application of each partial architecture and 
their final recommendations. Section V presents 
conclusion and future work.

II. 
STATE OF THE ART  
Porter defines innovation as the creation of new 
products, processes, knowledge or services by using 
existing, or new scientific, or technical knowledge. 
Furthermore, Porter also mentions that firms are 
evolving into value chains based on intangible assets, 
such as knowledge, technology, intellectual property, 
and others [6]. 
Afua also defines “innovation as the use of new 
technological knowledge, market knowledge, and 
business models that can deliver a new product, or 
service, or product/service combinations to customers 
who will purchase at prices that will provide profits” 
[7]. 
Consequently, the "Innovation Economy" involves 
the production and generation of knowledge, and its 
application in products, processes, and services. Thus, it 
has become the main asset for developing dynamic 
competitive advantages  [8]. 
Innovation is the most important topic required for 
companies to grow successfully. In addition, some 
factors are changing the environment where the 
companies are competing. Among these factors include 
[9]: 
 Access to Knowledge: Permit to companies 
has access to the best ideas, technologies, research 
resources, and experts at low cost. 
 Trade Barriers: Are rapidly being dismantled, 
thus opening up all markets to global suppliers. 
 Access to Capital: The funds may now seek 
opportunities on a global basis, and companies must 
compete internationally for capital. 
 Technological 
Obsolescence: 
Market 
life 
cycles are now less than product development 
cycles. In addition, companies are developing new 
methods to reduce their product development times. 
A study by the Centro de Tecnologia Avanzada A.C. 
(CIATEQ) developed in 2008, found insufficient 
capacity of SME’s for the  production of knowledge 
and technology, little demand for them, and the 
disconnection between demand and possible public 
offering [10]. The study reflects that SME’s had greater 
difficulties in order to integrate into the productive 
chains. In addition, there is a lack of coordination 
between the system of technological innovation and the 
technological demand from firms. 
In the adoption of new methods for the organization 
of work and innovation, the EA methodology was 
placed into consideration. EA is a methodology that 
aims to provide companies with a framework for the 
use of the information in business processes in ways 
that support their business strategy [4], and provides the 
strategic alignment between the business strategy and 
the ICT’s. 
Some frameworks have been created for providing a 
guide or method for the establishment of the EA. These 
are: 
 
The Zachman Framework. 
 
The 
Department 
of 
Defense 
Architecture Framework (DoDAF). 
 
The 
Open 
Group 
Architecture 
Framework (TOGAF). 
 
The Zachman Framework [11] was created by John 
Zachman in the early 60’s at the International Business 
Machines 
(IBM) 
Corporation. 
Consequently, 
he 
developed the framework to define the information 
systems. This combines rows and columns that 
represent the perspectives, views, and descriptions 
types. The perspectives include scope, business model, 
systems 
model, 
technology 
model, 
detailed 
representations, and company’s performance.  
The description types are data, function, network, 
people, time, and motivation. Therefore, Figure 1 shows 
the Zachman Framework with its elements. Each cell 
contains a set of elements that represent diagrams or 
documents on the specific architecture and the level of 
details. For example, in the column of the functions or 
processes with line of objectives and scope, the cell has 
a list of processes which run the business.  
Ylimaki and Halttunen say that all the columns and 
rows are important because they form the abstractions 
of the company [12]. Thus, each cell must include a 
primitive graphical model which describes the company 
from the viewpoint of the perspective that it is 
analyzing. 
The Zachman Framework established the basis for 
the next generations of frameworks. This includes 
DoDAF, which later became TOGAF, which is based 
on the Architectural Development Method (ADM).

In Figure 2, nine phases were represented. 
Therefore, these phases are preliminary analysis, 
architecture vision, business architecture, information 
systems 
architectures, 
technology 
architecture, 
opportunities 
and 
solutions, 
migration 
plan, 
implementation of governance, and architecture change 
management. All these components of TOGAF 
generate deliverables in the form of diagrams, 
flowcharts, structures, definitions, and other artifacts. 
 
 
                         Figure 2. Phases of TOGAF [14] 
Every framework has a common factor. They aim to 
empower the company through the ICT’s search which 
helps 
to 
increase 
the 
productivity 
and 
the 
competitiveness of the company.  
With the increment of complexity in the companies, 
the needs of data processing are increasing [13]. In this 
case, 
references 
about 
TOGAF 
and 
Zachman 
Framework has been taken [11]. This is used to 
construct the design proposal of the architecture. In 
addition, software designing tools like Essential 
Architecture Manager and the editor Protégé Ontology 
Editor Version 3.4, have been used in the management 
of the data in the architecture design.  
Other 
researchers 
have 
developed 
advanced 
applications of EA, as Bernard [15] who has defined 
EA 
as 
a 
holistic 
management, 
planning, 
and 
documentation activity, and has introduced the EA 
Cube Framework and implementation methodology. 
Where lines of business were defined as five sub-
architectures: Strategic initiatives, business services, 
information flows, systems and applications, and 
technology infrastructure. 
 “Newer 
approaches 
as 
business 
services, 
exemplifies how EA can link strategy, business, and 
technology components across the enterprise within a 
service bus that encompasses platform independent 
horizontal and vertical EA components”  [15]. 
Ahlemann, Stettiner, Messerschmidt, and Legner 
establish that the Enterprise Architecture Management 
(EAM) is a driver of strategic architecture initiatives as: 
The implementation of reference models and industry 
norms, with the goal of adopting best practices, 
standardization and harmonization, with the goal of 
reducing the heterogeneity and complexity of business 
processes, applications, data, infrastructure technology, 
service oriented and modularization , with the goal of 
creating reusable services and modules [16]. 
III. 
PARTIAL ARCHITECTURES  
 
Research and studies in Europe indicate that the EA 
is a driver for transformations in companies [3]. 
Orantes, 
Gutierrez 
and 
Lopez 
mentioned 
that 
companies should be constantly evolving, redefining 
business processes to achieve business architecture 
(BA) which is the basis for subsequent architectures [2]. 
The data flow of the study is shown in Figure 3. 
With these premises, partial architectures have been 
constructed. However, the first is the BA. 
 
 
 
Figure 3. Data flow of the EA 
 
A. Business Architecture 
The purpose of the BA is to define the business, 
document organizational structure, identify and define 
business functions and processes, relying on strategic 
planning with their areas of interest [17]. The BA 
involves some elements of the company like the 
mission, vision, objectives, goals, values and policies; 
business processes, procedures and functions, and 
organizational structure, situational analysis, customers, 
markets, products, and long, medium, and short 
strategies.

The company of the study case is a medium 
enterprise that provides raw material to the large steel 
companies in northeast of Mexico. This company was 
established in 1982 to meet the needs of the industry in 
the manufacture and machining of metal parts. 
Consequently, the machined parts are made through 
computerized numerical control machines (CNC). The 
main products which were manufactured are generally 
forklift parts, rotating joints, plates thousand holes 
(clamps, 
screws, 
etc.), 
and 
various 
mechanical 
equipment parts and assembly work. The company has 
65 employees.  Figure 4 presents some data for the BA. 
The structure of the company has 4 levels, 
corresponding to the CEO and Sales manager at the top 
position. As follows, these levels include Head of 
production machining, Head buyer, Head finance, and 
Human 
resource 
manager. 
Other 
levels 
have 
Supervisors for machining and pailer areas. 
 
 
Figure 4.  Elements of the Business Architecture 
The company competes in the regional market of 
Mexico, and has a local quality certification. Their 
strategy is to produce high quality metals that the 
markets are demanding for. 
 
B. Applications Architecture 
The Applications Architecture (AA) contains the 
software products that the company has for the support 
of the processes. The objectives, principles, and 
capabilities that govern this architecture are presented 
in Table I. 
The objective of AA is defined as the best kinds of 
applications to manage data and support business 
processes with the minimum packaged applications. As 
a result, the capabilities for the management of the AA 
are 
the 
analysis, 
design, 
programming 
and 
implementation 
of 
information 
systems, 
search 
packaged solutions tailored towards the needs of the 
SME’s, and providing technical support for software 
and hardware in all the company. Some of the current 
applications are presented in Table II. In this case, the 
applications are related to the processes that supports 
the firm.

principles, and capabilities of TA are displayed in Table 
III. 
The consolidation of the technology infrastructure is 
the main objective, with minimun diversity for 
maintenance purposes. The capabilities are complex 
because TA manages communications and networks. 
Also, it provides technical support and various services 
like platforms integration and monitoring. Thus, Figure 
5 presents the equipment.

TABLE IV. RESULTS OF THE  INTEGRATION 
 
 
IV. 
RESULTS  
 
After the design of the partial architectures in this 
firm, the results show that two processes are not 
completely supported by applications and technology.  
These include Training and Shipment.  
E-commerce which could improve the sales volume 
and increase productivity is highly recommended when 
rethinking a strategic planning of the company. 
Therefore, quality and production processes are 
supported by spreadsheets. 
The Microsip Manufacturing System [18] is a 
solution designed for SME’s that do not have 
applications in the production areas. Also, the study of 
EA confirms the need that had already been detected to 
automate production processes. Thus, the advantages of 
the software are: 
 
Planning and control of production. 
 
Calculation of production. 
 
Prioritize work orders. 
 
Monitoring of workers. 
 
Monitoring of machines. 
 
Simulation of production orders. 
 
Production reports.

 
Tracking production. 
 
Dynamic queries with access to all 
production data. 
 
Control of shipments. 
 
Conversion to graphics. 
 
Integration with other installed modules of 
Microsip brand. 
With this special solution, SME’s control of the 
shipments of finished products will be achieved. 
Information systems are used in training areas in 
order to manage the main elements, such as courses, 
facilitators, identifying the needs of the plant for 
training, and the proposed dates. 
The activities of internal or external training 
generate a dynamic company that leads to improved 
productivity and competitiveness. 
Regarding the proposal to integrate e-commerce 
firm on a long term, the following activities were 
proposed: 
 
Development of a dynamic website to 
promote the manufactured products. 
 
Investment 
in 
ICT’s 
could 
increase 
competitiveness and growth into new 
domestic and international markets. 
 
Establish a definition of roles, functions, 
and policies for recategorizing. 
 
Get an open line of credit to finance the 
expansion plan and the purchase of 
equipment and machinery. 
 
Competition is intense in the sector of this 
industry. Thus, achieving a better position 
in the market is necessary to identify and 
select new potential customers, increase 
advertising in all media, expand their sales 
channels, and follow up through customer 
service. 
 
Fostering a culture of total quality in the 
whole company. 
 
The change plan is long term, and it 
includes management activities to close 
gaps encountered and the acquisition and 
implementation of information systems and 
technology. 
In addition, this project helps in meeting the needs of 
SME’s companies to propose affordable solutions that 
use business management resources and technology, to 
solve problems. This study is limited to manufacturing 
SME’s.  
Other findings in terms of improvement show that 
SME’s have demonstrated alignment with business 
strategy to drive a strong organizational culture and 
technological infrastructure. 
 
 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  
 
In this paper, the EA methodology was designed 
and applied in a medium manufacturing company with 
information provided from different sources of the firm, 
where the applications and technology that support their 
business processes were analyzed, linking them through 
tables and charts. As a result we found that the 
company requires an ICT’s investment in production 
and quality processes, which would integrate the 
information that is obtained in real time and would 
expedite the processes of decision-making, as well as 
the integration of e-commerce to the sales strategy. This 
can help increase the productivity of the company.  
The advantage of this approach lies in that the 
company is analyzed holistically, especially in its core 
processes. 
Given the importance for EA, organizations will 
increasingly support their EA efforts as a virtual 
reporting structure with collaboration of all people to 
deliver substantial business value.
