Abstract— The Indian manufacturing industry is undergoing a 
significant change after the global pandemic. The supply chain 
disruption from Covid-19 has forced many manufacturing 
industries to speed up the adoption of digitalization in their 
supply chain to address the growing need for convenience and 
more rapid "anytime anywhere" solutions. As a result, 
manufacturing industries are using advanced technology in 
their supply chain. Digitalization has the ability to drive the 
efficiency of their processes and reduce business cost. This 
study investigates the relationship between DIGitalization 
(DIG) and Business Performance (BP) in the Indian 
manufacturing sector. In this context, a scientific research 
model has been developed from the existing literature. The 
proposed model was tested using statistical data collected from 
Vice 
president/Associate Vice 
President/Divisional/Chief 
Managers/ Project Managers/ Senior Managers/ divisional 
Managers, IT managers, consultants, and project leaders of 
manufacturing industries. Data were analyzed through 
Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) using Analysis of 
Moment Structure (AMOS 22.0). Our empirical result 
indicates that there is a significant positive relationship 
between digitalization and business performance in the Indian 
manufacturing sector. 
 
Keywords - Digitalization; Business Performance and Structural 
Equation Modelling. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
The COVID-19 pandemic spread across the world 
affecting populations across countries [44]. The COVID-19 
virus disrupted the Indian manufacturing sector due to the 
worldwide lockdown. Most manufacturing setups lack an 
end-to-end view of their supply chain such as end-to-end 
visibility, 
data-sharing 
across 
silos, 
real 
-
time response capabilities, and flexibility in last-mile 
delivery. To address the above issues, the manufacturing 
industry can leverage digitalization with the use of Industry 
4.0 
technologies, 
to 
provide 
end-to-end supply 
chain management visibility. 
Digitalization 
results 
in 
increased operational efficiency and gross margin for 
businesses [25]. To achieve the above, the information must 
be shared between the manufacturing floor and business 
systems in real-time. Better integration of data and processes 
and real-time capturing of data from the machine and shop 
floor will enable manufacturing organizations to fine-tune 
their operations and produce products according to the 
demand of customers. In digitalization, firms implement a 
broad set of new technologies to optimize their business 
processes to improve operational efficiency and speed. 
Indian manufacturing companies are on a secular growth 
trend due to their correlation with the growing Indian 
economy, which is characterized by rising demand in the 
domestic market and worldwide growth opportunities. 
According to India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF), "By 
the year 2030, India has the potential to become a global 
manufacturing hub and it can add more than US $500 billion 
annually to the global economy". 
The digital transformation market size in manufacturing 
has been valued at USD 263.93 billion and it is poised to 
reach USD 767.82 billion by 2026 with a CAGR of 19.48% 
during the forecast period 2021-2026 [32]. This digital 
transformation enables increased visibility, control and 
optimisation of production processes by integrating 
operations technology with information technology. The 
goal of value chain management is to improve bottom line 
of business by improving operational efficiency while 
preserving product quality while lowering inventory 
carrying costs. This builds customer confidence and 
Customer satisfaction. When industrial processes are 
digitalized, mistakes caused by lost or misread data are 
eliminated which is prevalent in manual operations.  
Based on the above insight, current literature on 
digitalization 
does 
not 
empirically 
demonstrate 
a 
relationship 
between 
digitalization 
and 
business 
performance. Thus, we formulated our research questions to 
address these gaps in knowledge. Our study aims to 
empirically examine the relationship between digitalization 
and business performance in the Indian manufacturing 
sector. The following research question has been identified 
in our study. 
 
RQ1. Does digitalization have a positive relationship 
with business performance in the Indian manufacturing 
sector? 
To answer the above question, a conceptual model was 
developed to analyze the relationship between digitalization 
and business performance and the model was tested 
statistically through SEM (AMOS 22.0 software).

II. 
LITERATURE SURVEY 
A. Digitalization 
The 'digitalisation of manufacturing' has recently 
become one of the most prominent themes for major 
economies 
[3][17][33][41]. 
"Digitization" 
and 
"Digitalization" are two constitutive definitions that 
were used interchangeably in the academic literature 
[33][41]. At a fundamental level, digitization creates 
excellent sources of data, and can be defined as "moving 
from analogue to digital data for streamlining existing 
processes" [33][41]. "Digitalization is defined as adopting 
digital technologies to facilitate business operations" 
[2][13]. Digitalization is a process that takes advantage of 
cutting-edge digital technologies in order to enhance 
productivity and improve operational efficiency cutting-
edge technology like Artificial 
Intelligence (AI), 
Virtual 
Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), Internet of 
Things (IoT), Cloud computing, and robotics are driving 
growth of manufacturing industries [51]. According to 
Gobble, “Digitalization is the use of digital technology, 
digital information, and other resources to create value in 
new ways" [11]. According to Gartner, "Digitalization is the 
use of digital technologies to change a business model and 
provide new revenue and value-producing opportunities" 
[10]. According to Westerman et al., “digital transformation 
is the use of technology to radically improve the 
performance or reach of enterprises" [50]. In a nutshell, 
digitization refers to information, while digitalization refers 
to processes. Lenka et al. explained that "Digitalization 
enables the processes, resources interactions and outcome 
between manufacturing firms and the customer to co-create 
value at the new frontiers of the business" [29]. According 
to Agarwal and Narain, the following are potential benefits 
of digitalization: "greater transparency", "reduced inventory 
levels", "clear visibility of inventory", "more decentralized 
warehousing", "delivery times reduction", "a better 
understanding of customer's requirements", "higher sales 
and profit margins", "improved supply chain flexibility", 
"better decision-making processes" and 
"maintaining 
competitive advantages" [1]. Big data analytics and cloud-
based systems in the context of Industry 4.0 can 
significantly 
improve 
operational 
efficiencies 
[30][34][42][48]. The study has established factors to 
measure the perceived benefits of implementing Industry 4.0 
technology [16]. Digitalization has the ability to improve 
flexibility, agility, and responsiveness as per customer 
demand in dynamic market conditions [37]. Implementing 
digitization in manufacturing gives an instant boost to 
productivity and allows quick project execution so 
manufacturers can meet aggressive deadlines. With 
digitalization, manufacturers can share real-time data across 
the globe also data can have accessed by anyone from 
anywhere [5]. 
B. Business performance 
Business performance measures the actual performance 
of a business against intended goals. Regular review of the 
business performance saves the business against any 
financial or organizational problems and helps the 
businesses lower operational costs and improve productivity 
[7].Any organizational initiative, including supply chain 
management, 
should 
ultimately 
lead 
to 
enhanced 
organizational 
performance. 
Numerous 
authors 
have 
measured business performance by utilizing "financial and 
market indicators" such as "market share", "return on 
investment", "the profit margin on sales", "overall 
competitive position", and "the growth of market share", 
"sales and return on investment" [39][45][47][49][52][53].  
C. Digitalization and business performance 
Various studies have proved the significant relationship 
of technology adoption with business performance [4][12]. 
Digitalization increases revenue for the organization's 
stakeholders by widening the distribution of sales channels 
and increasing the productivity of industrial processes by 
reducing operational expenses or shortening the duration of 
operations. According to Horváth and Szerb, “Digital 
management practices with the use of IT tools tend to 
enhance business performance” [21]. Implementation of Big 
data is related to this concept, and its impact on business 
performance has been shown [9]. According to Hensher, 
leveraging digital platforms can reduce operational costs in 
turn its leads to business performance [18]. There is a 
significant positive effect of strategy or technology 
implementation from Industry 4.0 on business performance 
among SMEs [35]. It is also proven that Industry 4.0 
technologies have a positive influence on service, and 
production and they enhance business performance 
[24][35][43]. Continuous innovation in technology can 
strengthen the relationship between people, processes, and 
performance [38]. According to [15], the use of digital 
technology has a positive relationship with business 
performance. According to reference [27], there is a positive 
relationship between blockchain technology, Supply Chain 
Integration 
(SCI) 
and 
Sustainable 
Supply 
Chain 
Performance (SSCP). 
III. 
MODEL CONCEPTUALIZATION 
 
Based on the deep understanding of research questions 
from the obtainable literature and experts' insights we 
developed a conceptual model that analyses the relationship 
between digitalization and business performance. As an 
illustration, Figure 1 shows the hypothesized model which 
6

ICCGI 2023 : The Eighteenth International Multi-Conference on Computing in the Global Information Technology

sheds light on the relationship between digitalization and 
business performance. 'Digitalization' is conceptualized as a 
five first order construct adapted from [19][46][54], whereas 
business performance of the manufacturing sectorwill be 
evaluated through "financial performance" and "market 
performance" [26][28]. Using literature support, the 
expected relationships between digitalization and business 
performance are discussed and hypothesis relating these 
variables are developed. Subsequently during our pilot study 
phase, the dimensions and items of digitalization and 
business performance were verified and validated using 
confirmatory factor analysis. 
  
Hypothesis: There is a significant relationship between 
digitalization 
and 
business 
performance 
in 
Indian 
manufacturing sector.

IV. 
METHOD 
       The research uses a quantitative approach to examine 
the relationship of digitalization and business performance 
in the Indian manufacturing context. Literature review 
supplemented by expert advice acts as an input to develop a 
questionnaire as per the objectives of the research. This gave 
us extensive information about the constructs namely 
digitalization 
and 
business 
performance 
for 
Indian 
manufacturing industry. A preliminary questionnaire was 
drawn up (see Appendix A), post which pre-testing was 
performed on 50 respondents to evaluate the clear and 
comprehensible wording of the questionnaire.  
 
     Data was collected from Vice Presidents (VP), Associate 
Vice President (AVP), Deputy Vice President (DVP) senior 
managers, IT managers, consultants, and project leaders and 
asked to fill the questionnaire survey. Data collection 
occurred between third week of December 2021 to Forth 
week of October 2022. Out of 234 usable responses, the 
survey revealed that around 53% of respondents were 
between the ages of 25-35, 36.33% were between 35-50, 
and the other 10.68% were above 51 years old. Furthermore, 
38.03% 
of 
participants 
were 
VP/AVP/DVP/Chief 
Managers/Project 
Managers/Senior 
Managers/Divisional 
Managers, 
34.19% 
were 
Technology 
experts 
and 
consultants, 14.96% were Technology product/marketing 
Managers, and the remaining participants fell into other 
categories. 
V. 
ANALYSIS AND RESULTS 
A. Preliminary analysis and measurement model 
A Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was used to 
investigate the internal construct reliability, convergent 
validity, and discriminant validity of measurement model. 
Statistical 
Package 
for 
the 
Social 
Sciences 
(SPSS 22.0) and AMOS 
22.0 
are used for 
empirical 
analysis. Table I shows the psychometric properties of the 
measurement model. The "Cronbach alpha" and "composite 
reliability" of all constructs were above the threshold of 0.70 
which confirmed internal consistency reliability (presented 
in Table I). 
 
TABLE I. RELIABILITY AND ITEMS LOADING OF THE MEASUREMENT 
MODEL 
 
 
      Hair et al. described that "Discriminant validity shows 
the extent to which a construct is truly distinct from other 
constructs" [20]. According to Fornell and Larcker, " the 
square root of the Average Variance Extracted (AVE) of 
each construct should be much larger than the correlation of 
the specific construct with any of the other constructs" [8]. 
The value of AVE for each construct should be at least 0.50. 
Table II demonstrates the square root of an AVE of any 
latent constructs is much larger than the correlation between 
them which confirm the discriminant validity [8]. It is 
evident from Table II that the questionnaire has a valid and 
reliable instrument for measurement of digitalization and 
business performance in manufacturing sector.

To examine the "fit" of the measurement model, a 
number of model fit indices were obtained from the 
confirmatory factor analysis like Chi-square/df (Degree of 
freedom) = 2.953 CFI (Comparative Fit Index) = 0.959, GFI 
(Goodness of Fit Index) = 0.919, NFI (Normed Fit Index) = 
0.939, TLI (Tucker-Lewis index) = 0.944 and Root Mean 
Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0.092. Gefen 
and Straub (2000) has proposed the acceptable fit of 
respective values of χ2/df, should be less than 5, GFI, CFI, 
TLI and NFI should be more then 0.9 and the RMSEA value 
must be lower than 1. Table III clearly demonstrates that 
measurement 
model 
posited 
goodness-of-fit 
indices 
indicating a good fit with the collected data so we can 
proceed further for testing the structural model using SEM.

B. Assessment of the structural model 
According to Hair, "A structural model is a conceptual 
representation of the hypothesized relationships between 
constructs" [20]. In order to examine the proposed model 
and relationships, the test of the structural model was 
performed on SPSS 26.0 and AMOS 22 using structural 
equation modeling. Table IV depicts the goodness-of-fit 
indices for the structural model: χ2/df, CFI, GFI, NFI, and 
TLI values are 2.953,0.959,0.919,0.939,0.944 The RMSEA 
shows a value of 0.092. Thus, we can conclude that the 
structural model is accepted as per goodness-of-fit indices. 
We can proceed to test a statistical hypothesis defined in the 
model.

Table V summarizes the standardized path coefficients 
(β), standard error and hypotheses result. The level of 
significance (α) is set at 0.05.  
 
The result reveals that digitalization has a positive and 
significant relationship with business performance (β=0.322; 
p < 0.05), supporting the hypothesis. The result was 
consistent with theoretical expectations and the relationship 
is significant as the p-value is less than 0.05.

RESULT DISCUSSIONS 
 
Digitalization is one of the biggest buzzwords across 
every business around the globe. Digitization is often joined 
by digitalisation and digital transformation in both 
conversations and business practices. The primary objective 
of this study to investigate the relationship of digitalization 
on business performance in Indian manufacturing sector. 
The conceptualized research model was build using existing 
literature, practical insights and consultation with the subject 
experts. The results of statistical testing of hypothesis 
reveals that digitalization has a positive relationship with 
business performance. Horváth and Szerb (2018) are line 
with the findings that management practices linked to 
digitalization and the use of digital tools increase business 
performance. Several studies have demonstrated that 
technology can improve business processes and boost 
performance [10][22][40]. IT has entered in an era of 
digitalisation 
where 
digital 
technologies 
can 
boost 
sustainable 
growth 
by 
spurring 
innovation 
and 
differentiation. By integrating digital technologies in current 
business processes, it allows authorized users to access the 
information more efficiently, quickly, intuitively and 
securely. Greater efficiencies and business benefits can 
boost profitability of the organization [36]. McKeown and 
Philip deliberated a business transformation to be "an 
overarching concept encompassing a range of competitive 
strategies which organizations adopt in order to bring about 
significant improvements in business performance" [31]. 
Our 
findings 
demonstrate 
that 
digitalization 
can 
8

significantly bolster business performance in industrial 
firms. It can do so by boosting efficiency, lessening 
expenses, optimizing quality, and offering new business 
prospects. However, to reap the rewards of digital 
advancements, we need thoughtful preparation, investment 
in the proper tools and infrastructure, and a thorough 
comprehension of the potential advantages and difficulties. 
 
VII. CONCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS 
 
Our study takes a first step towards examining the 
relationship 
between 
digitalization 
and 
business 
performance in the Indian manufacturing sector. From the 
empirical 
results, 
it 
was 
evidently 
specified 
that 
digitalization has a positive relationship with business 
performance.  
This study has some limitations and opportunities for 
future research.The findings of our research primarily focus 
on the Indian manufacturing sector which does not provide 
an adequate basis for generalization. Moreover, the said 
limitation potentially paves the way for further research. For 
improving the generalization of the study, the model can be 
tested in other countries. Further research can be conducted 
to investigate the relationship between digitalization 
andsupply chain performance, competitive advantage, and 
organizational resilience.
