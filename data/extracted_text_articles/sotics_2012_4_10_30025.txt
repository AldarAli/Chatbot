Abstract— This paper refers to fora for distance education. 
The present research focuses on content analysis, a technique 
frequently used to approach issues concerning asynchronous 
computer mediated discussion groups. There is a variety of 
approaches, varying on the level of detail and on the type of 
categories of analysis they use. The content category is 
presented as a unit of analysis for the decodification of 
messages in the asynchronous distance education fora in which 
the modelling is incorporated in a formal language and the 
development of a respective system created by Hellenic Open 
University for this purpose. The creation of this system makes 
an important contribution to the decoding of discussions in 
fora, and aims at summary identification of discussions which 
do not develop in the desired way.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
During the last decade, an increasing number of 
educational institutions, as well as companies, apply 
asynchronous educational services via internet [1][2][3]. 
One of the means utilised in distance education during the 
last decade is the electronic fora (fora hereinafter). Research 
efforts on distance education fora, at an international level, 
began during the ’90s [4][5][6]. However, this is a field, 
which requires constant updating and redefinition. Given, 
also, the fact that the practice of distance education during 
the last decade has acquired new features, both in its 
methodology and in the tools which are utilised, the further 
exploration of this field becomes necessary.  
The structure of this article is as follows: the theoretical 
framework section is a short description of the respective 
assignment 
on 
the 
content 
analysis 
technique 
of 
asynchronous discussions at distance education fora. The 
role of the fora of Hellenic Open University (HOU 
hereinafter) concerning the educational procedure is 
described. The unit of analysis, which was used, is then 
presented, followed by the integration of the message content 
category as a unit of analysis in formal language. A 
presentation of the system of automatic text classification 
and the association with the message content category 
follows, including the description of the results of the 
experiments performed to control system operation. The 
paper closes with a discussion on the necessity of this system 
and the conclusions of this article. 
II. 
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK 
Although researchers seem to agree that collaboration 
may encourage the learning procedure [1], there is no clear 
theory available to guide research on computer mediated 
interaction [2], empirical markers which shall be the base of 
a codification tool as a standard against which to evaluate 
whether or not effective learning is occurring through the 
online discussions [3]. In the last few years, numerous 
efforts to approach this issue were made, stemming from 
different theoretical backgrounds. Indicatively, Henri [4] 
uses the point of Cognitive and metacognitive knowledge, 
while others [5][6] the point of Critical thinking.  
As is shown from all the above, an important issue 
arising is the unit of analysis which shall be used for the 
content analysis. Fahy et al. [7] consider each single 
sentence as one unit of analysis, and Pena-Shaff and 
Nicholls [8] uses the sentence as unit of analysis, trying to 
approach it at a paragraph level. Others choose the 
definition thematic unit (or otherwise of a “theme” or an 
“idea”) to be their unit of analysis [4][5][9]. Another 
approach [3][6][7][10] is to consider the whole message that 
a student enters at a specific moment in the conversation as 
the unit of analysis. Jarvela and Hakkinen [11] choose a 
Complete discussion, while during the last years there has 
been an approach of multiple point both at a micro and at a 
macro level [12]. Further down, a comprehensive review is 
presented in a table form (Table I), referring to the unit of 
analysis used by this field’s researchers.

III. 
THE CASE OF HELLENIC OPEN UNIVERSITY 
HOU is the eminent educational institution offering 
distance education in Greece. Today, HOU has 30,557 
students (17,889 undergraduate, 12,600 postgraduate and 68 
PhD candidates); it is staffed by 1642 professors (only 42 of 
which are permanent and the rest are associate professors-
counsellors).  
The HOU’s structural educational unit is the course 
module; presently, 203 course modules are offered by HOU. 
An important supportive mean of the educational procedure 
is the fora of HOU, which contribute both to the 
organization of the studies during the course module as well 
as to the elaboration and development of what the student 
have already studied. 
The HOU’s fora offer important help during the 
educational procedure.  They may also contribute to the 
following:  
a) as for the  organization of the studies during the 
course module: 
• 
to the communication between the tutor and the 
students (regularity of contacts, subject, resolution 
of “technical” problems etc.). 
• 
to the organization of homework (method of use of 
the teaching material and the preparation of the 
activities, exploitation of the literature and the other 
sources, timetables, encountering problems related 
to it etc.) 
• 
to the supply of information about the advisory 
meetings 
(their 
number, 
their 
duration, 
the 
timetables, the goals, their content and methodology 
applied, problems’ encountering as for the ability to 
attend them etc.).  
• 
to supply clarifications about the procedure of 
preparation 
and 
evaluation 
of 
the 
written 
assignments 
(form, 
method 
of 
preparation, 
evaluation criteria, ways to be supported by the 
tutor etc.). 
• 
to inform about the procedure of final exams. 
b) as for the elaboration and development of what the 
students have already studied, the HOU’s fora may be 
exploited for: 
• 
presentation of consolidation exercises, short 
suggestions, 
presentation 
of 
examples, 
methodologies, literature etc., 
• 
resolution 
of 
questions 
and the supply 
of 
clarifications about the teaching material. 
• 
interconnection between what is already studied and 
the next chapters and the following written 
assignment.  
In the discussion threads of each course module, the 
tutor and all the students of the course module have the 
chance to participate. As for the students of informatics, for 
the 16 course modules of informatics (for undergraduate 
level) offered by HOU, by the time this research was 
conducted, there were 753 discussion threads created with 
6,663 messages. Concerning the evolution of the HOU 
forum's use, indicatively, at the course module “Introduction 
to Informatics” (INF10), during the last three academic 
years there is a great increase in the number of messages: 
1808(2009-10), 1942 (2010-11) noted and 2913 (2011-12). 
Given the big flow of information transferred through 
fora of HOU, simulated the development of a formal 
language to interpret messages in the fora of HOU, a system 
based on modelling with the use of a formal language was 
created, entering threads from discussion fora and exporting 
the respective strings in an automatic way. 
IV. 
THE UNIT OF ANALYSIS 
Given that the choice of a unit of analysis is dependent 
on the context and should be well-considered, because 
changes to the size of this unit will affect coding decisions 
and comparability of outcome between different models 
[14], as well as given the fact that Schrire [15] refers to a 
dynamic approach in which data is coded more than once 
and the grain size of the unit of analysis is set, depending on 
the purpose and the research question, it was decided not to 
take into consideration the discussion thread, not even the 
message as unit of analysis, nor the paragraph or the single 
sentence.  
It was decided to use as unit of analysis, the category of 
the message’s content, as for the observation of the 
discussion threads, it was noticed that there are cases of 
messages which may comprise two (or/and more) content 
categories, e.g., a question about the next advisory meeting 
and a reply to a question concerning the study of the 
educational material.   
Thus, in that case, the analysis at a message’s level used 
by some researchers [3][6][10][13] is insufficient for the 
exploitation of information that shall arise aiming to reach 
educational conclusions, as it is obvious that in a message 
more content categories may coexist.  
Furthermore, the analysis at a level of a single sentence 
used by some researchers [7] could not be taken as a single 
unit of analysis since a content category may extent to two 
or/ and more sentences. For the same reason the unit of 
analysis at a paragraph level, used by Pena-Shaff and 
Nicholls [8], was not chosen. In addition, in our case, not 
even the Complete discussion used by Jarvela and Hakkinen 
[11] as unit of analysis cannot be exploited, since it is noted 
that in a discussion thread there may exist many more than 
one content categories. Otherwise, the title of a discussion 
thread may not be representative of this and the discussion 
may extent to more than one subjects. 
According to the study of the messages of INF10 for 
academic years 2009-2012 the messages as for their content 
may concern (in brackets you see the respective symbols 
used in formal Language): study of educational material 
(M), questions/answers for exercises – assignments (X), 
presentation of sample assignments by tutors (P), 
instructions (I), assignment comments, corrections (F), 
student comments on assignments (D), sending – receiving 
assignments (J), sending - receiving grade marks (G), 
notification of advisory meeting (V), and pointless message 
(L).

V. 
INTEGRATION OF  THE MESSAGE CONTEXT 
CATEGORY AS A UNIT OF ANALYSIS IN FORMAL LANGUAGE 
According to the study of the messages on HOU’s fora 
during the academic years, a Language was developed, 
which is defined by mathematic terms and represents the 
messages using as unit of analysis the category of the 
message content. More specifically:   
There are two categories of communication’s carriers: a) 
Tutors, b) Students 
For brevity reasons, tutors shall be symbolized with T 
and students with E  
As for the type of message, they are discerned to 
questions and replies (symbols q and a respectively). 
As for their content category, we have the symbols 
aforementioned in the previous section: M, X, P, I, F, D, J, 
G, V.  
Finally, the order in which the above symbols appear is: 
a) the message carrier, b) the type of message and c) the 
content category to which the message belongs. 
Thus, the Language contains: 
a) Terminal symbols alphabet VT, where VT = {T, E, q, 
a, n, M, X, P, I, F, D, J, G, V, L } 
b) Non terminals alphabet VN, where VN = {u, r, y, c}, 
more specifically :  
r: represents the message carrier (where T for tutors and 
E for students)      
u: represents a pair yc i.e., a message type y (whether it 
is a question q or an answer a) followed by its content 
category.  
c) The grammar P 
A set of rules of the form α → β, where α and β 
sequences containing terminal and non-terminal symbols 
and α is not an empty sequence, as follows: 
1.   S   →  ruS 
   8.  y   →   q 
15.   c   →    F 
2.   S   →   ε 
   9.  y   →   a 
16.   c   →    D 
3.   u   →   uyc 
10.   y   →   ε 
17.   c   →    J 
4.   u   →   ε 
11.   c   →   Μ 
18.   c   →    G 
5.   r   →   T 
12.   c   →   X 
19.   c   →    V 
6.   r   →   E 
13.   c   →   P 
20.   c   →    L 
7.   r   →   ε 
14.   c   →   I 
21.   c   →    ε 
where ε stands for an empty symbol 
d) Symbol S where every sentence generated starts with 
this symbol. 
According to the above, when a message should be 
represented concerning a student's message, addressing a 
question about the study of the educational material, 
followed by another student’s question about the following 
assignment and at the end of the thread there is the reply of 
the tutor both for the study of the material and for the 
following assignment, it shall be represented as follows: 
EqMEqXTaMX (Ε for the student’s capacity, q for the 
question, Μ as it concerns the study of the educational 
material, Χ for the fact that the next message concerned an 
assignment, T for the tutor’s capacity, a for the fact that it is 
an answer, M for the fact that this reply concerns the study 
of educational material and X for the fact that the second 
part of the message concerns an assignment.). According to 
the above, the sequence EqMEqXTaMX constitutes a 
sentence of the Language because: 
Rule:  (1)          (1)            (1)                  (3)                           
        S —> ruS —> ruruS —> rururuS   —> ruycruycruycS 
 
(4)(6)(8)(11)                            (4)(6)(8)(11)                            
—————> EqMruycruycS —————> EqMEqXruycS 
 
       (3)                                (2)(4)(5)(9)(10)(12) 
       —>EqMEqXruycycS ————————>   EqMEqXTaMX 
As it is obvious from the example, while to the first two 
messages corresponds one content category M and X 
respectively, at the 3rd message there are two content 
categories MX. 
VI. 
THE SYSTEM - TIME ASSOCIATION 
According to this approach, a system of automatic 
classification 
was 
developed, 
which 
comprised 
the 
following:  
a) Data filtering: where some web pages are considered 
as input accommodating the discussion threads of a distance 
education forum of HOU (which include a great deal of 
irrelevant data containing essential information concerning 
the educational procedure, e.g., titles, images etc.) and 
creates a temporary file with the “useful” part (User name, 
date, message’s content), which may become a source of 
information for educational conclusions. 
b) Storage of root files: which is a dynamic way 
according to which word or phrases or symbols roots are 
stored, as well as the respective terminal symbols q if it is a 
question or a if it is an answer. The same was also done for 
the storage of information necessary in the determination of 
content category of a message, i.e., if it is about study, 
assignment, comment etc. or combination of them (e.g., a 
message concerning both the study and an assignment). To 
wit, it takes as input couples of information of the type root 
of a word or phrase and terminal symbol of the content 
category (M, X, P, I, F, D, J, G, V, L). As it is obvious, the 
system provides the ability to add further content categories 
if necessary. 
c) Strings’ production: receiving as input the temporary 
file with the “useful” information (User name, date, 
message’s content) and the files with the couples of roots 
words/ phrases/ symbols and terminal symbols and presents  
the respective strings with the relative extensible file, so as 
the results to be kept for further exploitation (Figure 1).

Months:Φεβ=Feb, Μάρ=Mar, Απρ=Apr).

It is worthy to note here that this specific system 
incorporates the sense of time along with its association 
with each of the nine (9) categories of message content 
(except from the pointless message category) chosen as unit 
of analysis. More specifically and given that within a 
message (as it is deduced both from literary review and 
from the observation of the fora of HOU) more than one 
contents may exist, the dates are recorded for each such case 
and not simply in each message. 
In fact, after each couple yc, there is a date's record. 
Certainly, so as to effectuate the above procedure nine (9) 
stacks were used – as many at the message’s content 
categories, each one having as many figures as the number 
of appearance of terminal symbols resulting from the non-
terminal symbol c. Consequently, time differences may 
automatically exist (in days, if from each current date, by 
content category, it is deduced the previous one) and thus 
there may arise another nine (9) respective stacks with the 
above date references. Of course, the length of these stacks 
is equal to the length of dates minus one (-1), i.e., apart from 
the initial message, which is considered to be the point zero 
(0), where the numbering of the time differences begins. 
The contents of the stacks of time differences may constitute 
an important criterion, which may participate as such (in 
combination with other criteria) in case of evaluation of a 
forum's consequences to the educational process. 
Also, the final form that will have the 9 stacks with the 
dates they will be as follows (Table II):

VII. EXPERIMENTS 
A. Phase A  
At first, experiments were carried out by using 80 
discussion threads of the INF10 module of the academic 
year 2010-11. Given that 219 threads with 1,942 messages 
had been created throughout the year, there was the ratio of 
approximately 9 messages (in particular 8.87) per discussion 
thread. Therefore, out of the 80 selected threads, an effort 
was made to use those containing 8 or 9 messages for the 
purpose of experimental control. Thus, we finally chose 80 
discussion threads with 712 messages in total (average 8.90 
messages/thread).  
At the first experimental operation, the word root files in 
relation to both the type (question/answer) and (mainly) the 
content category of message contained 18 and 92 entries 
respectively. Under these conditions (Table VI), we ended 
up having 58 discussion threads with no errors and 16 
threads with only one wrong symbol (compared to what was 
expected). Namely, out of (approximately) 9 messages (of 
each of the 16 threads), 8 of them were correct and one 
message was wrong because it did not contain not even one 
of the 92 provided word roots. Respectively, there were 5 
threads with two errors and 1 thread with more errors (this 
thread was created before Christmas holidays and its 
messages contained mainly wishes). We should note here 
that there has been no error regarding the type of messages 
(question/answer), only in terms of determining the content 
category. 
Following the observation/study of messages in the 21 
threads that contained 1 or 2 errors, 49 additional word roots 
(concerning the content category) were recorded and it was 
decided to enter them in the root file. The experimental 
operation performed in the same 80 threads had, clearly, 
better results, with total success in 70 threads, one wrong 
symbol in 8 threads, two errors in 1 thread, and 1 thread that 
did not actually refer to educational content (Table V). 
At this point, it should be clarified that the control of the 
results produced by the system in this phase (A), was 
conducted with manual comparison of all the messages in 
the discussion threads that were used in order to control 
system reliability at the first degree.

experimental phase (B’). Classification was performed 
according to international literature [16-21], using the 
algorithms indicated for this purpose: Naive Bayes (NB), 1-
Nearest 
Neighnor 
(1-NN), 
WINNOW 
and 
discrete 
AdaBoost (in the form generalized by Nock and Nielsen 
[19] based on Freund and Schapire [20]).  
During this phase every algorithm was formed using the 
data 
collected 
from 
the 
academic 
year 
2010-11. 
Subsequently, a group of data for two other academic years 
(2009-10 and 2011-12) was also collected. The results show 
that the discrete AdaBoost algorithm produced the greatest 
accuracy. This result complies with Bloehdorn and Hotho 
[21] who used the discrete AdaBoost algorithm in a similar 
experiment. The accuracy is denoted in the Table VI.

The star (*) indicates that the algorithm which were  
used ,performed statistically better than the specific 
classifier according to t-test with p<0.05. In all the other 
cases, there is no significant statistical difference between 
the results (Draws).  
The average accuracy (1) corresponds to the total 
number of threads and messages, while in (2) the years have 
an equal participation (1/3) in the total average. 
It is worth noting that in all cases, the type of message 
has been correctly identified (i.e., whether it is a question or 
answer), and therefore any errors concerned the content 
category (as noticed in the initial experimental operation).  
Results are shown in Table VII.

The above results, which followed a calibration process 
of repeated readjustment, were deemed satisfactory (98.32% 
correct message interpretation for 2011-12) and in the end, 
the development of this system gives a clear affirmative 
answer to the question “is there an automated method to 
interpret messages in a distance education forum?” 
Therefore, by using this system, it is now possible to read 
study and classify, within a few minutes, a large number of 
messages (6,663 messages) which took 12 months to be 
completed within the framework of this paper. 
VIII. DISCUSSION 
At this point, it is important to initially discuss the need 
for such a system using the content category as analysis 
unit. As it is deduced from the related literature review, it is 
concluded a gap as for the methodological approach which 
is to be based on modelling with the use of formal language 
and which will examine the content analysis from the 
message content category view. This research aims to 
contribute to the covering of this gap, consequently a need 
arose to create a system to interpret the discussion of a 
forum about distance education in a structured way, through 
the approach presented above and at the same time taking 
into consideration the concept of time and producing 
respective results, so as to help the participating students to 
improve their educational practices.  
In fact, this system defines a “code” clarifying some 
issues 
which 
determine 
both 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
communication relations and the educational principles of 
teaching/ learning procedure. In other words, this system 
aims to encourage towards the direction of the use of 
“good” or “desirable” educational techniques, adding up to 
the distance education. At this point it should be clarified 
that the development of this system does not intend to 
disorientate from the basic principles of distance education, 
but aims to contribute to its further development and 
upgrading and to act auxiliary and not in excess. The results 
of its use shall constitute data for the creation of a database 
[22] aiming to investigate the effects of fora in educational 
procedure from the point of causal interpretation point of 
view. Given that the HOU is not a conventional university 
(with the features of a homogenous student community), but 
it addresses to adults with special educational needs and 
incongruity (both as far as their age, their professional and 
family obligations are concerned), the future research access 
to such issues becomes particularly important.  
More specifically, the system in the future shall collect 
the students’ particulars (e.g., marital status, age, sex, 
profession etc.), their performance at course modules of 
HOU (final mark, assignments’ marks, effort of success of 
the course module) and the strings produces by the system so 
as to interpret the messages of HOU’s fora, in order to reach 
educational conclusions in combination with the use of the a 
tool, weka type. In fact, this application refers to a wider 
field of interdisciplinary encounter, by the merge of 
cognitive theories and artificial intelligence. 
IX. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
The practice of distance education during the last years 
has acquired new features, both in relation to methodology 
and in the tools it uses. It is also a fact that the subject of 
electronic fora in distance education is a dynamically 
formed field requiring constant updating and redefinition.  A 
big part of the research presented in the international 
literature concerning distance education's fora, refer to the 
content analysis, which principally aims despite the fact that 
this research technique is frequently used, though there are

still no standards established. There is a variety of 
approaches, varying both at detail’s level and at the type of 
categories of analysis they use. As it was deduced from the 
above presentation and study of the discussion threads of 
HOU, it was noticed that there are cases of messages, which 
may comprise two (or/and more) content categories, e.g., a 
question about the next advisory meeting and a reply to a 
question concerning the study of the educational material. 
For this reason, this paper uses the content category as unit 
of analysis for the messages’ interpretation in Asynchronous 
distance education fora and for this purpose incorporates it 
in a modelling in a formal language. Furthermore, time 
indexes of participation were integrated in combination with 
the content categories of the message, in order to define the 
way these elements could improve the capacity of the tutor 
to evaluate the progress of a discussion thread in a distance 
education forum.  
Among others, the prediction for future research actions 
are long-term studies concerning the main issue: what 
reinforces the participation at fora and how this contributes 
to the educational process effectiveness by investigating side 
questions, such as how much it affects the person who starts 
the thread (tutor or student), how it starts, the period when 
the thread starts, how important the time of response in 
threads, is the groups’ size etc. and their association with the 
elements concerning the students’ profiles and their 
performance in course modules of HOU, intending to reach 
educational conclusions.
