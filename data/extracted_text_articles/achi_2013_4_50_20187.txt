Abstract—In recent past the need for ubiquitous people 
identification has increased with the proliferation of human- 
robot interaction systems. In this paper we propose a 
methodology of recognizing persons from skeleton data using 
Kinect. First a half gait cycle is detected automatically and 
then features are calculated on every gait cycle. As part of new 
features, proposed in this paper, two are related to area of 
upper and lower body parts and twelve related to the distances 
between the upper body centroid and the centriods derived 
from different joints of upper limbs and lower limbs. Feature 
selection and classification is performed with connectionist 
system 
using 
Adaptive 
Neural 
Network 
(ANN). 
The 
recognition accuracy of the individual people using the 
proposed method is compared with the earlier methods 
proposed by Arian et. al and Pries et. al. Experimental results 
indicate that the proposed approach of simultaneous feature 
selection and classification is having better recognition 
accuracy compared to the earlier reported ones.

INTRODUCTION 
Automatic person identification is one of the important 
factors in Human-robot interaction based applications [1]. 
Successful identification of individual gait pattern can 
certainly help a machine to take and control different actions 
on the basis of previous interaction with that same 
individual. The interaction by the robot can be personalized 
upon identification of an individual [2][3]. Biometric 
identification, using different behavioral patterns like gait, 
keyboard typing, lip movement etc. or physiological 
signatures like voice/speech, face, iris, fingerprint etc. [4], is 
one of the common means of automatic person recognition. 
Over the last few decades, extensive research work has 
already been done on different biometric modalities like 
face, iris scan and fingerprint recognition [5]. However, 
other biometric characteristics like gait, skeleton data, EEG 
are relatively less considered [8]. Moreover, it is very 
difficult to get iris, fingerprint, face or audio (voice/speech) 
related biometric information (at the recognizable resolution) 
from a large distance and without user’s direct co-operation. 
Human gait recognition has great advantages in recognition 
from low resolution images where other biometric 
techniques are not suitable because of insufficient pixel 
information [6]. Psychophysical studies [7] indicate that 
human being is capable of recognizing an individual reliably, 
from his/her style of walking or movement. Another 
advantage of gait pattern identification is that it is very much 
hard to hide or imitate. 
For gait information processing, we need video sequence 
of walking person, where at least one complete gait cycle is 
present.  A gait cycle is starting with one foot forward and 
ending with same foot forward. Each and every gait has two 
main components [9] namely, a structural component or 
physical build of a person (e.g. height, length of limbs etc.) 
used to derive static features and motion dynamics during 
gait cycle used to derive dynamic features. 
In this paper, we use Microsoft Kinect sensor to derive 
the skeleton data for recognizing of individuals. The main 
contribution of this paper is given below: 
• 
Automatic gait cycle detection algorithm from skeleton 
data of Kinect as opposed to manual gait cycle detection 
[22]. 
• 
Proposal of new static and dynamic features related to 
area and distance. 
• 
Methodology 
to 
use 
ANN 
based 
connectionist 
framework for feature selection and supervised learning 
algorithm [30] to determine the important features. 
The proposed area features include the area spanned by 
the lower and upper parts of the body as physical/structural 
features. The distance features include relative distances 
between body-centroid and the centroids formed by the 
joints of upper and lower limbs. Comparison of recognition 
accuracy is done between the proposed approach and the one 
mentioned in [21] and [22]. 
This paper is structured as follows: Related work is 
presented in Section II. Proposed method for Kinect data 
recording setup and feature extraction are given in Section 
III. The supervised learning and ANN based feature selection 
is given in Section IV. The results are given in Section V 
followed by conclusion and acknowledgement.

Related work 
Existing gait recognition methods can be categorized 
under two categories namely model based and model free 
approaches [10].  In the model based approach, gait signature 
is derived from modeling and tracking different parts of the 
body (like legs, limbs, arms etc) over time and then it is used 
for person recognition and identification. Primary model 
based approaches consider only static parameter for 
recognition [11]. BenAbdelkader et al. [12] used structural

parameter like stride and cadence, of walk-cycle for 
identification. Yam et. al [13] built a structure and motion 
based model of legs to indiscriminate walking and running 
gait pattern using biomechanics of human and pendulum 
motion. Though this approach is view-invariant and scale 
independent, but it is computationally expensive and very 
much sensitive to quality of gait sequences [10]. Model free 
approaches mainly characterize gait pattern by observing 
how shape of the silhouette of an individual changes over 
time or by considering entire motion dynamics of the person. 
Sarkar et. al [14] propose a baseline algorithm using series of 
gait silhouettes as feature. Gait Energy Image (GEI) [15] and 
Motion Energy Image (MEI) [16] are also used for 
individual identification. Though GEI is robust but it lacks 
dynamic gait information. Liu and Zheng [17] propose an 
algorithm which combines both spatial and temporal 
information. To solve the problem of gait incompleteness, 
Chen et. al [18] suggests FDEI algorithm. Xue et al. [19] use 
wavelet decomposition of GEI for infrared gait recognition. 
In many of these approaches, width of the outer silhouette 
contour has been considered as a good feature candidate. 
Model free approaches are relative easy but not robust with 
view point and scale. For direct gait classification, many 
researchers use KNN, SVM and TSVM. Dynamic Time 
Wrapping (DTW) is a very popular technique for gait pattern 
matching. Sundaresan et al. [23] successfully develop a 
HMM based framework for gait recognition. Recently [21] 
has employed 3D skeleton based approach for recognizing 
individual person from their walking gait pattern. They have 
used Microsoft Kinect to capture skeleton data and used K-
means as an unsupervised learning algorithm for clustering. 
Pries et. al. [22] also does a comparable job of skeleton 
based person recognition using Kinect. They have used 11 
static and 2 dynamic features for classification and compared 
1R, C 4.5 decision tree and Naive Bayes classification 
results. To best of our knowledge there have been no work 
done on the feature selection of Kinect data for person 
identification. PCA [20] and LDA [24] are most commonly 
used feature selection tool in this field. More recently, Mu 
and Tao [25] use DLA to reduce biologically interdependent 
features. In this paper we investigate the importance of 
various features using the ANN based feature selection 
method. 
III. 
PROPOSED METHOD 
In this paper we propose a skeleton based approach 
(provided by Microsoft Kinect Sensor) for gait recognition 
and person identification. Kinect provides real time human 
skeleton information of 20 skeleton joints. We have used 
Microsoft Kinect SDK for recording the data for human 
skeleton at 30 frames per second (fps). 
Our system is implemented mainly in three steps - 
recording of skeleton data for side walking pattern using 
Kinect (section III.A), feature generation over half gait cycle 
(section III.B) and supervised learning and feature selection 
to identify an individual (section III.C). 
A. Skeleton Data Recording 
We recorded the 20 joints of skeleton data for a person, 
keeping position of Kinect fixed throughout our experiment. 
In our experiment, side way walking pattern of an individual 
on an arbitrary path is considered. In each recording session, 
we have taken multiple side-walks (from left to right and 
right to left), where the distance of the persons from the 
Kinect ranged between 6 feet to 10 feet (Figure 1). This 
enables us to test the identification accuracy in a scenario 
where the distance of the subject changes over time. 
 
Figure 1. Recording setup using Kinect -- (a) showing right to left walk 
and (b) showing left to right walk 
B. Feature Generation 
Salient feature generation from skeleton data is an important 
step to discriminate individual characteristics. In case of 
walking, half gait cycle provides all the meaningful 
information required for identification. Thus initially, the 
half gait cycles need to be identified from the skeleton data 
and then generate the features per half-gait cycle. 
Computation of Half-Gait Cycle 
The side walk movement pattern of a person is shown in 
Figure 1. We have considered x-axis as horizontal axis, 
parallel to ground. Figure 2 shows the changes in left and 
right ankle position over time (frame number) indicating an 
individual is moving multiple times from left to right and 
right to left in front of the Kinect.

frames between two consecutive local minima. Figure 3 
shows the square of #$%&'()*+ for several frames, in dotted 
green color and the half gait cycle boundaries are shown with 
vertical partitions in red color.  
 
 
Figure 3. Detection of Half Gait Cycle 
Feature Vector 
The features that can be generated from the skeleton data 
of 20 joints can broadly be classified as static and dynamic 
features. The static features are based on the distances 
between the adjacent physical joints as shown in the 
following equation 
#$; , <||.$  1 .;||2 >  ||?$ 1 ?;||2  >  ||@$  1 @;||2  
where the joints i and j are directly connected and adjacent 
to each other. The dynamic features include the variation 
due to the joint movements and their orientations with 
respect to the other joints which are not adjacent to each 
other.  
In [21] Adrian et. al have proposed eighteen features 
related to the angle changes in different joints below hip. 
These are mainly dynamic features where they have taken 
the mean, max and standard deviation of the three angles for 
each leg. We have considered these features for comparing 
the accuracy of individual identification. In [22] Preis et. al 
have proposed 12 static features (distances between joints) 
and 2 dynamic features (stride length and speed) for people 
identification. These are also considered for comparison. 
In this paper we have proposed a two area related 
features and a set of hybrid features which are a mixture of 
static and dynamic information. Out of these, the first area 
feature fau is static information of an individual and changes 
insignificantly while walking or movement. The second area 
feature fal is a dynamic feature and changes significantly 
while walking. The proposed twelve hybrid features are 
distance features fD which are related to static and dynamic 
information of an individual. 
Area Features: Area occupied by upper and lower part 
of the body during side walk is the key distinguishing factor 
as the spread of hand and leg for each person is different 
from others. So we have considered area of upper and lower 
body during side walk as one of our features. 
A reasonable way to compute area of upper or lower part 
of a body is to select N joints (3 ≤N ≤ 20), so that N joints 
form a closed polygon. If co-ordinate of ith(∀ $ ∈ C) joint is 
(xi,yi), then the area enclosed by N joints, as projected on Z-
plane, is 
D , 
E
F ∑

      (2) 
Using (2) we have calculated area of upper body (fau) and 
lower body (fal). The joint considered for upper body area are 
shoulder centre, shoulder left, hip left, hipcentre, hip right 
and shoulder right. The joints considered for lower body area 
are hip centre, hip right, knee right, ankle right, ankle left, 
knee left and hip left. The final area feature vector is the 
mean area values in a half-gait cycle, given as fA = {fau , fal} 
is in R2 space. 
Distance Features: The change in distances of skeleton 
joints with respect to the centroid of the upper body is unique 
for a person and is easily recognizable by a human brain. 
Thus, the Euclidean distances between centroid of different 
parts of the body with respect to the centroid of the upper 
body are indeed a set of good candidate as features. Here, we 
have considered only four distances between upper body 
centroid and to the centroids of both hands and legs, 
separately.

computed as

Using (3), we have calculated the centroid for the following: 
• 
upper body (enclosed by shoulder centre, shoulder left, 
hip left, hip right and shoulder right) 
• 
right hand (enclosed by shoulder right, elbow right and 
wrist right) 
• 
left hand (enclosed by shoulder left, elbow left and wrist 
left) 
• 
right leg (enclosed by hip right, knee right and ankle 
right) 
• 
left leg (enclosed by hip left, knee left and ankle left) 
The Euclidean distances fST  between upper body 
centroid (xS, yS, zS)  and other centroids (xT, yT, zT) can be 
written as given in (4) where, i=1 for left hand, i=2 for right 
hand, i=3 for left leg and i=4 for right leg.

Figure 4 shows Euclidean distance between upper body

We have also considered all the features (0rFEs) and (0rFFs) 
reported in the papers [21] and [22] respectively however, 
instead of taking angle between foot and ground, angle 
between ankle and ground is used because left and right foot 
co-ordinates are relatively more inclined to noise. Thus 
finally the combined feature vector is in t46 space as given 
by (6).

SUPERVISED LEARNING 
We have used Adaptive Neural Network (ANN) and 
Naive Bayes classifier for supervised learning. Pries et. al. in 
[22] have found that Naive Bayes performs better compared 
to 1R and C4.5 decision tree. Hence we have excluded them 
in our experiment. 
A. Naive Bayes 
The Naive Bayes classifier is based on Bayes' law. It is a 
probabilistic classifier which assumes the statistical 
independence of the features. This assumption is violated in 
the case of features extracted from the human gait cycle as 
clearly indicated by [22], however, it performs the best as 
reported with the dataset tested in [22]. Thus we also have 
considered the Naive Bayes classifier for comparing the 
proposed features along with one more non-linear classifier. 
B. Multi layer Perceptron Models 
Multi-layer Perceptron Model (MLP) is a well know 
ANN architecture [26]. This consists of an input layer, an 
output layer and one or more hidden layers. The excitation 
function of the neurons (nodes) used for the experiment is a 
uni-polar sigmoid function. The strengths of the connections 
between the nodes of different layers are termed as weights. 
These weights are initialized randomly and the final weights 
are obtained after running the back-propagation (BP) 
algorithm [27] iteratively over the training feature vectors. A 
sample structure of the ANN is shown in Figure 5 where a 
single hidden layer is shown but in general multiple such 
hidden 
layers 
can 
be 
present. 
The 
weight 
matrixxE
PPPPPPQcorresponds to the weights between the hidden 
layer and the input layer. Similarly, xF
PPPPPPQcorresponds to the 
weight matrix between the hidden layer output layer and the 
output layer. The output of the neural network is denoted by 
the hypothesis function 4y(0). 
In our experiments we have considered only a single 
hidden layer. It is observed that increasing more number of 
nodes or increasing number of hidden layer is not improving 
the results and it was taking more time to execute. By 
experimentation and using the method proposed by 
Hagiwara [29], we have chosen a single hidden layer with 
number of nodes as 25.

The regularization parameter  is selected as 0.6 which 
gives the minimum cross-validation error. Learning curve is 
used to verify that the training samples are enough to train 
the designed ANN structure (Figure 5). 
C. Feature Selection using ANN 
In this paper, we provide a methodology to use the 
connectionist system for feature selection as proposed by Pal 
et. al [30] in order to get more insight to the previous and 
new features. In [30], an "on-line" methodology is provided 
for simultaneous feature selection and classification using 
MLP. We have used the same approach; however the 
learning is done in "Batch" mode rather than "on-line" mode. 
For each iteration, in the "Batch" mode, all the training 
samples are fed to the neural network and the error in each 
layer are accumulated to compute the gradient values of the 
cost function with respect to the weights. Whereas in "on-
line" mode, for each iteration, a single training sample is 
used to compute the error in each layer to compute the 
gradient values. After every iteration, the weights are 
updated using conjugate gradient descent algorithm to 
minimize the cost function. The ANN structure is shown in 
Figure 7 where a "Selection Layer" is added before the 
standard input layer. 
 
 
Figure 7. ANN Structure with Feature Selection 
According to [30], the attenuation function in the selection 
layer is F and the argument for the attenuation function is _ 
for the (a feature. This attenuation function F is applied to 
the input features before passing to the normal neural 
network. During the learning process the arguments _ gets 
updated such that the favourable features having higher 
discriminative properties get higher values in _while others 
get lower values. Thus the favorable features, termed as good 
features, get passed with higher strength while the others get 
lower strength. This process is called the selection of features 
which happens simultaneously with the training of the ANN. 
In our experiment the attenuation function is chosen as a 
uni-polar sigmoid function given by (8).

The correctness of the feature selection method in batch 
mode is verified by using the IRIS dataset [32]. This dataset 
has four features namely, sepal length (0E), sepal width (0F), 
petal length (0), and petal width (0¢) of Iris flower. It is 
observed that the features 0 and 0¢ get higher importance 
compared to features 0E and 0F. This is same as reported in 
[30] and [31]. Hence the design for the feature selection in 
batch mode for ANN is confirmed to be consistent to 
previously reported results. This ANN structure is used in 
our experiment to analyze the proposed features and 
previously reported features for human identification from 
Kinect based skeleton data. 
V. 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
The accuracy of recognizing an individual based on skeleton 
data is evaluated for the proposed features and compared 
with the features and results reported in earlier works [21], 
[22]. We have performed the experiments in four stages. 
Section V.A compares the proposed features with the one 
given in [21] for 5 subjects with manual gait data, section 
V.B gives the results for automatic gait detection, section 
V.C gives the effect of increase in subjects to 10 and 
comparison with [22] and section V.D gives the results for 
feature selection using ANN. 
The results of performance comparison are given in 
terms of F-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision 
and recall and calculated by (10).

A. Comparison with [21] 
Initially, we have captured data for 5 individuals and 
compared the results with [21] as Adrian et. al have used 4 
subjects in their experiment. The total number of half-gait 
cycles for 5 individuals is approximately 700 with an 
average of 140 half-gait cycles per individual. 
As reported in [21], we perform k-means clustering on 
the features with k as 5 corresponding to 5 subjects.   
TABLE I shows the confusion matrix in percentage for the 
feature points as grouped in different clusters. It can be noted 
that the overall average accuracy of recognition is 25.2% as 
against the by chance accuracy of 20%.

In this experiment the half-gait cycles are manually 
extracted to keep the experimental environment similar to 
[21]. The results of the k-means clustering are compared 
with the ANN classification. Out of the 700 features vectors, 
372 vectors are used for training and the remaining are used 
for testing. In our implementation, we have used ANN with 
one hidden layer of 25 nodes as shown in Figure 5. 
A summary of the results for 5 subjects with manual half-
gait cycle extraction is shown in TABLE II. This clearly 
indicates that if we take all the 32 features (14 new features 
(0 , W0v, 0ZY) and 18 earlier features (0rFEs) proposed in 
[21]), the recognition accuracy is maximum at 86% which is 
substantially higher compared to by chance accuracy of 20%.

B. Automatic Half-Gait detection 
The accuracy of the half-gait detection algorithm (section III) 
is measured by comparing the ground truth generated by the 
manual gait detection. The precision of the algorithm is 1, 
recall is 0.79 and the F-score is found to be 0.88. The 
accuracy of the recognition of an individual for 5 subjects 
using automatic gait cycle detection is given in TABLE III. 
It can be seen that the performance has slightly degraded 
compared to the manual gait detection (TABLE II).

only 14 new features 0 , W0v, 0ZY are used.

The results in the remaining section of this paper are 
based on automatic gait detection. 
C. Effect on Increase in Subjects 
It is important to analyze the effect in accuracy results as 
we increase the number of subjects. Pries et. al in [22] have 
used 9 subjects for their experiments where they have found 
Naive Bayes classifier to perform best on the 14 features, 
0rFFs proposed by them. As the dataset used by [22] is not 
publicly available, we have generated a larger dataset of 10 
subjects with 8 men and 2 women. The comparison of 
different features and classifiers are shown in TABLE IV. It 
can be seen 0 , [0rFEs, 0v, 0Zewith ANN classifier performs 
best having recognition accuracy of 55% which is much 
better than chance accuracy of 10%.

A sample confusion matrix on the test data for ANN with 
0 , [0rFEs,  0v, 0Ze is shown in Figure 9. It can be seen that 
the recognition for the subject "a" is worst affected whereas 
others are quite reasonable as seen from high values in the 
diagonal entries. 
 
Figure 9. Confusion matrix for 10 persons using 32 features 
It is to be noted that the recognition reported here is 
based on every half-gait cycle, however in actual scenario 
the recognition will be done on a recording of a session 
where the decision will be taken on multiple gaits. 
Considering this fact, we can clearly say that the recognition 
is 90% (9 identified correctly out of 10) where the entry 
corresponding to the maximum number in the confusion 
matrix is taken to identify an individual. 
D. Feature Selection using ANN 
The feature selection method described in section IV.C 
for batch mode using ANN is applied on the feature vector 
0 , [0rFEs,  0v, 0Z,  0rFFse to understand the more important 
features against the least important. For this experiment, we 
initialize attenuation function (H) to 0.05. After the ANN 
training using the feature selection technique, the values of 
(H) are shown in Figure 10 for all the 46 features. The 
first 18 features (0rFEs) are the one reported in [21], the next 
two features are based on area (0v), the next 12 features are 
based on centroid distances (0Z) and the final 14 features 
(0rFFs) are as reported in [22]. It can be seen that most of the 
static features reported in [22] are having much higher 
importance than the dynamic features. The skeleton data 
captured using Microsoft SDK is not noise free and as the 
dynamic feature captures the property of persons walking in 
time, the uniformity in feature generation could be lost due 
to noise incorporation during walk, e.g different angle could 
be different in different gait cycles. On the other hand the 
static features capture the relative distances between joints 
and more stable in computation. Given the raw skeleton 
information using Microsoft SDK and Neural network as a 
classifier, these static features get more importance in person 
identification.

The recognition accuracies for 10 subjects with and without 
feature selection technique are given in TABLE V. It can be 
seen that 
with 
simultaneous 
feature 
selection and 
classification the F-score has increased to 0.62.

VI. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper we have presented few static and hybrid 
model based features for gait recognition solution using 
Microsoft Kinect. The static feature proposed is the area 
encompassed by the upper body and the hybrid features 
include the area encompassed by the portion below hip and 
the distances between the body-centroid and the centroids 
derived from the joints of the upper and lower limbs. The 
accuracy of the gait recognition is compared with the 
methods proposed in [21] and [22]. ANN based 
connectionist system [30] is used to perform simultaneous 
feature selection and classification in the batch mode. 
Results indicate that the static features get higher 
importance compared to the dynamic features. Moreover, 
the hybrid features proposed in this paper are having a great 
importance compared to the dynamic features proposed 
earlier in the ANN based feature selection process. Future 
scope of research lies in removing the noise from the 
skeleton data before extracting dynamic features and also 
investigates their importance in the feature selection 
process. Future research is also aimed to use other sources 
of human identification along with skeleton data from 
Kinect, to further improve the recognition accuracy. 
Moreover the effect of using multiple Kinect and camera 
needs to be analyzed in future.
