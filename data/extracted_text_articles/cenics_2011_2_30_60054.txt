 INTRODUCTION 
As the wireless market continues to grow with the 
proliferation of wireless communications standards such as 
GSM, WCDMA, and Wimax, there is increasing demand for 
reconfigurable multi-band RF front-ends that meet the 
specifications of various standards. 
Considering 
multi-band 
operation, 
designing 
reconfigurable power amplifier (PA) is required for multi-
standard RF transceivers. From the cost point of view, 
CMOS technology is a breakthrough in competitive RF 
monolithic integrated circuits, allowing development of cost 
effective reconfigurable PA. 
There are different configurations to achieve multi-band 
operation and many reconfigurable PAs using different 
approaches have been reported. The conventional multi-
mode implementation consists of a combination of different 
PA units, designed optimally for each frequency band [1]. 
Although the PA module presents high performance, it needs 
complex structure resulting in larger circuit. The second 
method is a wideband approach with input and output 
impedance matching in wide range of frequencies [2]. 
However it is difficult to achieve high efficiency in all bands 
of interest. Compared to the two first methods, the tunable 
approach would avoid the use of redundant blocks of single 
PA and is based on adaptive matching network [3]. 
The introduction of  radio-frequency micro-electro-
mechanical systems (RF-MEMS) components have opened 
new perspectives to implement this ideal solution with 
enhanced tuning range, low loss and high quality factor Q of 
passive devices. The reported reconfigurable PAs based on 
tunable impedance matching network with MEMS switches 
and/or stubs have demonstrated a high output capability with 
good efficiency over several bands of operation [4]-[5]. 
However these devices require the hybrid integration of the 
MEMS matching network. Thanks to significant advances in 
CMOS-MEMS 
integration, 
reconfigurable 
PA 
fully 
integrated in CMOS process can be achieved. 
In this work, the design of a reconfigurable quad-band 
class AB CMOS power amplifier with the help of MEMS 
variable capacitors 
and micromachined inductors is 
presented. The designed PA is fully integrated in 0.18 
CMOS technology and operates in 1.7, 1.8, 1.9 and 2 GHz. 
The paper is organized as follow. In next Section, the 
design of the class AB power amplifier is described. Section 
3 presents the tunable approach with MEMS variable 
capacitors and Section 4 presents the simulation results. 
Conclusion and future work are summarized in Section 5.

CLASS AB POWER AMPLIFIER DESIGN 
Power amplifiers have balancing parameters which, often 
are in conflict; thus a good linearity comes usually at the cost 
of efficiency. The aim is to achieve 20dBm of output power 
with good efficiency. A reduced conduction angle 
configuration is adopted and Figure 1 shows the schematic of 
the single ended one stage class AB power amplifier. 
A. Transistor characterization & circuit design 
The first step of the design consists to provide a suitable 
biasing point for the power amplifier to operate ideally in 
class AB region. The power amplifier’s figure of merit such 
as maximum output power, gain, efficiency and linearity are 
related to the bias conditions. Using 0.18µm 1P6M RF-
CMOS process available from TSMC, the voltage supply is 
fixed at 1.8 V for a maximum output voltage swing. The 
relative low oxide breakdown voltage in bulk CMOS 
technology limits the maximum drain voltage, hence the

maximum output power. In order to increase the output 
power, a large transistor size required. The transistor width is 
chosen according to the maximum driven current capability 
required for 20 dBm output power. The maximum drain 
current is derived from [6] with a conduction angle α equals 
to 3π/2. The corresponding current value is 200mA which in 
turn leads to a transistor width of 400µm in TSMC 0.18µm 
RF-CMOS process. To operate in class AB, the gate is 
biased at 1.05 V corresponding to a DC bias current of 90 
mA. 
 
Figure 1.  Schematic representation of the power amplifier 
The inductor L is used as a DC biasing choke to set the 
DC level of the transistor to the supply voltage. It must have 
a high reactance at the operating frequency and with the 
assumption that its value is ten times greater than the load 
impedance, an inductance of 12 nH will suffice for all 
frequencies from 1.7 GHz to 2.1 GHz. An integrated 
capacitor of 10 pF is used as DC blocking capacitor. 
The LC tank at the output termination is designed to 
resonate at ω0
2= 1/L0C0 and removes higher harmonics. 
B. Load pull analysis 
For the given transistor size and bias conditions, the load 
impedance is swept in order to find the optimal load which, 
enables a maximum output power. To perform the load pull 
simulation, the input of the power amplifier is conjugately 
matched to the source for a maximum power transfer. Figure 
2 shows the load pull simulation results for 2.1GHz 
frequency band.

An optimum power matching point is found after load pull 
analysis over the different operating bands. The maximum 
output power is delivered to the load with optimal impedance 
Zopt = 16.2 + j19.4 Ω at all frequencies of interest. 
C. Input & Output matching networks 
The output matching network is designed to transform 
the 50 Ω load antenna into optimal load impedance Zopt. The 
matching network is also implemented in L-sections 
configuration as shown in Figure 3.

A. Tunable matching network 
The matching network is based on L-networks 
configuration for different operating frequencies and variable 
values for the inductance and capacitance. The concept of the 
matching network used in this design consists of 
implementation of the network with a combination of fixed 
inductors and MEMS variable capacitors as shown in the 
schematic diagram of the PA circuit in Fig. 4. 
To achieve the required impedance both for source and 
load matching, series inductance of 15 nH and 12 nH are 
coupled to the source and load respectively with two MEMS 
variable capacitors actuated by DC voltage between 
electrodes to insure tunability over the four operating 
frequencies. In addition, the resonant frequency of the LC 
tank can be tuned by varying L0 and C0. In this case, a 
MEMS variable capacitor is employed with fixed inductance 
of 4.5 nH. 
The required states of MEMS capacitance for impedance 
matching and tunable resonance frequency are reported in 
Table III.

B. CMOS-MEMS Variable capacitor 
The MEMS variable capacitors proposed in [7] represent 
a practical configuration for the tunable matching network. 
The MEMS variable capacitor will be fabricated by the 
CMOS-MEMS post-processing technique described in 
Figure 5. The MEMS capacitor is implemented with M3 and 
M5 metal layers as the bottom and top plates, respectively. 
An air-gap is created in between by removing interconnect 
metal layer M4. This CMOS-MEMS post-processing 
technique is developed at Centre for Integrated RF 
Engineering (CIRFE) [8].

SIMULATIONS RESULTS 
The designed circuit was simulated using cadence 
Spectre. Simulations include components available from 
0.18µm TSMC RF-CMOS process and device models for 
MEMS inductors and variable capacitor. The electrical 
models for micromachined inductors and MEMS variable 
capacitor were described in [9] and [10] respectively.  
The gain for the tunable PA is over 16 dB in 1.7 GHz, 
1.8 GHz, 1.9 GHz, and 2.1 GHz modes, respectively as 
shown in Figure 6. Figure 7 shows the frequency response of 
the PA from small signal simulation for the quad band of

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, the design of a reconfigurable quad-band 
CMOS power amplifier (PA) operating in 1.7, 1.8, 1.9 and 
2.1 GHz frequency bands is presented. The PA is fully 
integrated in 0.18µm CMOS technology and can be used in 
multi-band environment. Compared to traditional PAs, the 
designed device has a small circuit and works more 
effectively. The simulations results show that the PA can 
achieve a variable gain over than 16 dB with saturated output 
power of 20 dBm in the four operating bands and a PAE 
better than 50%. The proposed circuit is based on 
micromachined inductors and a tunable impedance matching 
network integrated with CMOS MEMS variable capacitors. 
The use of the CMOS-MEMS post processing technique 
allows the development of fully integrated reconfigurable RF 
circuits for multi-standard applications. 
The designed reconfigurable power amplifier is regarded 
as our first prototype; hence future works will focus on the 
optimization of the design and the integration of next 
generation’s PA with higher output power and suitable for 
multi-mode as well as multi-band application. The aim will 
be to develop a CMOS-MEMS reconfigurable PA according 
to the specifications for mobile phone standards.
