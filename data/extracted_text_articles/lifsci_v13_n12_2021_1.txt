Abstract—This paper discusses an application of a portable 
electronic nose based on an array consisting of 8 piezoelectric 
sensors with nanostructured solid-state coatings to detect 
volatile biomolecules secreted by nasal mucus and skin. A 
fundamentally new approach is proposed for a quick 
assessment of the status of the human body as a whole (normal, 
stress, inflammation) and the work of individual systems 
(reproductive, endocrine, digestive). This approach includes 
processing the output curves of sensors to assess of the 
qualitative and quantitative composition of the gas mixture of 
biomolecules secreted by the skin in the Zakharyin-Ged zone. 
Two algorithms for visualizing signals from an array of sensors 
are proposed. The first algorithm allows constructing the four 
―visual prints‖, reflecting the state of the human body (general, 
endocrine, energy, negative). The second algorithm constructs 
the health status sphere, which specifies the possible causes of 
deviation in health. Also, a portable electronic nose was 
applied in the veterinary field to assess the health status of 
calves’ respiratory system. Unlike the traditional approach in 
diagnostics using a sensor array, one sample of nasal mucus 
was monitored for 5-9 hours with an interval of 2-3 hours. The 
new parameter is proposed to separate the diagnostic group of 
calves according to respiratory tract health. The changes in the 
composition of the gaseous phase over nasal mucus samples 
were considered. Using an electronic nose with nanostructured 
piezoelectric sensors, the speed and simplicity of measurement 
allow painlessly scanning the body for metabolic disturbances 
and estimating certain pathologies' presence and treatment 
effectiveness. The proposed algorithms and device for analysis 
of biosamples from humans and animals could be implemented 
to rapidly diagnose health status on farms, hospitals, and at 
home.

compounds; metabolism; noninvasive diagnostic; skin; biofluid. 
I.  INTRODUCTION  
Biosamples are complex objects to analyze. The problem 
of their analysis is connected with the absence of constant 
composition and in its almost instantaneous change when 
substances are excreted from the sample. Despite the 
emergence of new methods for analyzing and studying 
biostructures at the level of individual cells, the scheme 
remains traditional: a selection of biomaterial - sample 
preparation - detection of target components. The use of 
highly selective and effective methods of analysis (gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry, high-pressure liquid 
chromatography.) suggests a special sample preparation, 
which can change the natural profile of the biosamples. The 
purpose of the analysis determines the method of sample 
preparation, but the integrity of the biological object is lost. 
Furthermore, the results obtained by advanced analysis 
methods do not reflect a biological object's complex structure 
and behavior. Therefore, recently, in analyzing living objects 
(food, 
environmental 
objects, 
human 
and 
animal 
biosamples), complex methods with a multivariate analytical 
signal have been used more often. Such methods by 
methodology include artificial tongues, noses, eyes, and their 
portable variants [1][2]. The undoubted advantage of highly 
sensitive sensor systems with a rapid response is the ability 
to monitor the state of small volumes and masses of 
biological samples in a reasonably short time (from 2 to 9 
hours). Given the lack of their contact with the environment 
(in vitro), primarily with oxygen, small volumes of 
biosamples, which means fast processes of changing their 
properties, open up a unique opportunity to obtain 
information about the status of the studied object, even if the 
specific methods for determining individual substances or

laboratory 
indicators 
(primarily 
microbiological) 
are 
unavailable. 
A possible approach for assessing the body's status in the 
absence of biomaterial selection is to analyze the chemical 
composition of the gas, sweat of the skin in the zones of 
Zakharyin-Ged. Earlier, the presence of redness, peeling, 
rash, temperature changes in these areas was widely used as 
an additional parameter to confirm the malfunction of organs 
corresponding to these zones. The detection limits of modern 
methods of analysis, the complexity of the instrumentation of 
the most sensitive methods do not allow noninvasive 
scanning and determining the chemical composition of the 
gas phase of secretions from the skin. Therefore, creating an 
integrated system for scanning a volatile metabolome using a 
device with a sensitive detector to biomolecules of normal 
and disordered metabolism, inflammation, and microbial 
metabolites is actual for now.  
The purpose of this paper is the development and 
application of a new mobile device based on piezoelectric 
sensors (portable electronic nose) for assessing the health 
status of organs and systems of humans and animals by 
analyzing the volatile metabolome. 
We will demonstrate our approach in two ways: 1) 
analysis of nasal mucus samples of calves for the diagnosis 
of respiratory diseases and 2) characterizing the health status 
of humans by skin odor in the Zakharyin-Ged zones. 
Further, in Section II, the related works and state-of-the-
art technologies for health status assessment are described. In 
Section III, the features of the experiment, description of 
biosamples, and methods of analysis are presented. Section 
IV contains technical characteristics of the proposed device, 
characteristics of used sensors and their coatings, a 
description of the procedure for obtaining and recording 
output data of the sensor array. Section V shows the results 
of applying the proposed portable electronic nose (e-nose) 
for solving diagnostic problems according to the purpose of 
the work. Section VI is devoted to conclusions and 
perspectives of development. 
II. RELATED WORK 
There are some state-of-the-art approaches, including 
portable devices, for assessing the state of the body using 
electronic noses and various data processing methods: for 
exhaled breath air [3][4][5], for the analysis of biomaterials 
(blood, urine, secrets of the endocrine glands and others) 
[6][7][8]. The different approaches for assessing health status 
by skin based on electrochemical or optical methods are 
proposed [9][10][11].  
At the same time, several devices have been developed to 
detect body odor with different types of sensors to 
discriminate volunteers and estimate changes in their body 
odor during physical activities [12][13]. There are examples 
of developing unique construction with sensors to diagnose 
tuberculosis [14], renal dysfunction [15], heart failure [16] 
by volatile compounds from the skin. 
The mentioned researches are based on training the 
sensor array by volatile compounds, measuring the body 
odor, and calculating the relative of normalized signals used 
for processing by different multivariate data analysis 
methods for classification or discrimination. However, the 
investigation of healthy people in different conditions is 
missed. Also, the application of such complex multivariate 
algorithms is not understandable for users and difficult to use 
in a hospital.  
We want to propose a sensor device with the simple 
measurement, calculation, and visualization of sensors 
signals with the verbal characteristics of state understandable 
by any user. The new technique of estimating respiratory 
organ state in animals and differentiating the disease on 
farms based on a simple parameter of the sensor array was 
one of the investigation tasks. 
III. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
This section represents the additional methods used to 
diagnose the health state of animals and humans. 
A.  Diagnosis of Respiratory Diseases in Calves 
The 17 samples of nasal mucus from calves (10-20 days 
of life), both with signs of respiratory system damage and 
conditionally healthy, were analyzed. A sampling of nasal 
mucus was carried out with sterile cotton swabs in individual 
sterile containers. The time from sampling to analyzing on e-
nose was taken into account.  
The calves were clinically studied in detail using a point 
system (WI score) developed at the University of Wisconsin, 
Madison (USA) [17]. Samples of nasal secretions were 
investigated in the laboratory at the All-Russian Scientific 
Research Veterinary Institute of Pathology, Pharmacology 
and Therapy using bacteriological and molecular genetic 
(PCR) analysis for infectious rhinotracheitis, parainfluenza-
3, viral diarrhea-disease cattle mucous membranes, rotavirus, 
adenovirus, chlamydia, pathogenic mycoplasmas (M. bovis, 
M. bovirhinis). Also, the hematological indicators in the 
blood 
(leukogram, 
haptoglobin 
concentration) 
were 
determined to confirm inflammation. 
For 
the 
isolation 
of 
cultures 
and 
typing 
of 
microorganisms from the nasal mucus samples, meat and 
peptone broth, milk salt, enterococcal agar, Endo medium, 
blood agar, glucose-serum broth and agar produced by 
Research Center for Pharmacotherapy (St. Petersburg, 
Russia) were used. The isolated Escherichia coli were typed 
in an agglutination reaction using O-serums.  
B. Characterizing the Some Deviation from Normal Status 
by Human Skin Odor 
The forearm area of human skin was chosen to analyze 
the volatile metabolome by a portable electronic nose. Over 
100 volunteers aged 3 to 80 years took part in the 
investigation for two years (72 female, 35 men). The 
volunteers periodically were clinically (visits to physicians) 
and laboratory (general analysis of blood, urine, biochemical 
analysis of blood (glucose, cholesterol, some hormones: 
thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, progesterone, 
follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol, lutein hormone, 
adrenaline, cortisol)) tested to control health status.  
Clinical monitoring of health status and measurement of 
volatile metabolome were performed on average once a 
month in the absence of pathology. When volunteers had

diseases (acute respiratory viral infections, bronchitis) or 
exacerbation of chronic pathologies (diabetes, heart failure), 
monitoring of the volatile metabolome of the skin and the 
main clinical and laboratory parameters (glucose level, heart 
rate, blood pressure) was carried out 2-3 times a day until the 
health state stabilized due to the therapy. The state 
―inflammation‖ corresponds to both an increase in laboratory 
parameters (leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate) 
and some cases, a change in biochemical parameters 
indicating 
the 
inflammation 
in 
organs 
- 
lactate 
dehydrogenase, 
aspartate 
aminotransferase, 
alanine 
aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, C-reactive protein. 
During the experiment, we monitored inflammation with 
different diagnoses: arthritis (n=2), gastritis (n=5), sinusitis, 
pyelonephritis, pneumonia (n=2), adnexitis (uni- and 
bilateral, n=3), endometritis (n=3), osteochondrosis (n=2), 
diabetes (n=2), inflammation of soft tissue and tendon, 
systemic lupus erythematosus. 
For conditionally healthy volunteers, the results of 
laboratory tests corresponded to the typical reference values, 
and the symptoms did not match with clinically significant 
ones for illness. Clinically not diagnosed conditions, so-
called descriptive states (tiredness, excitement, agitation, 
stress, lack of sleep, spasm, pain), were recorded from the 
volunteers' words.  
In 
total, 
by 
March 
2020, 
we 
performed 
964 
measurements. 
IV.  DESCRIPTION OF PORTABLE E-NOSE AND 
MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE 
The characteristic of used piezoelectric sensors and 
coatings, hardware and software of a portable e-nose, as well 
as technique of measurement, are presented below. 
A.  Making of Piezoelectric Sensors  
We used piezoelectric quartz resonators (PQR) with a 
natural frequency of 14 MHz with an established linear 
response with a film mass on its electrodes up to 20 μg/cm2. 
The array contained eight piezoelectric sensors with 
electrodes covered by films of carbon nanomaterial, 
hydroxyapatite, zirconium salts of different mass (1-5 μg) 
(NANO-BIO array). 
1)  Characteristics of the Used Sorbents 
Hydroxyapatite (HA) Ca5(PO4)3OH was obtained by the 
sol-gel method developed at Nizhny Novgorod State 
University, named after N. I. Lobachevsky [18] and 
optimized by us to obtain nanostructured coatings with good 
sorption properties. 
The reaction was carried out according to the following 
equation: 
5Ca(NO3)2·4H2O + 3H3PO4 +10NaOH → Ca5(PO4)3OH + 
10NaNO3 + 29H2O  
To a solution of calcium nitrate (2 mol/dm3) prepared 
from Ca(NO3)2·4H2O in bidistilled water has added a 
solution of H3PO4 in the amount necessary to maintain the 
ratio Ca/P = 5/3. The resulting solution was thermostated for 
one hour at 37 °C; then its pH was adjusted to 7-8 using a 
NaOH solution with a concentration of 2 mol/dm3. A 
hydroxyapatite sol began to form at pH = 4. The reaction 
mixture was kept at 37 °C for 1 hour. Then, the resulting gel 
was centrifuged and dried in air. The obtained sorbent can 
be stored for at least 0.5 years in airtight conditions. Multi-
walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) were obtained in the 
Institute for Extra Pure Materials of the Russian Academy 
of Sciences (Chernogolovka, Russia) by gas-phase chemical 
deposition during ethanol pyrolysis. Nickel was used as a 
catalyst; deposition temperature was 450-500 °C. Then 
nanotubes were washed with HNO3 concentrated (Reachem, 
Russia). The solvent for the suspension of HA and CNTs 
was 
chloroform. 
Zirconium 
nitrate 
(ZrO) 
(ZrO(NO3)2•2H2O) (chemically pure) was obtained from 
aqueous solutions containing zirconium and nitrate ions 
(Reachem, Russia). The solvent for the suspension of ZrO 
was acetone. According to the preliminary experiment 
results, these sorbents are selective and sensitive to volatile 
metabolites of bacteria and inflammation [19]. Also, the 
variation of sorbent mass affects the selectivity and 
sensitivity of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) micro 
weighting [20]. 
Therefore, the main array of sensors consists of: 
Sensors 1, 8 – CNT phases of different masses. 
Sensors 2, 7 – phases of ZrO of different masses. 
Sensor 3 – dicyclohexane-18-Crown-6, DCH-18C6. 
Sensors 4, 5 – HA phases of different masses. 
Sensor 6 – polyethylene glycol succinate, PEGS. 
Additionally, for the analysis of the gas phase over the 
nasal mucus samples, we used an array with polymer polar 
films (additional sensor array), which we previously used in 
our work with other biological samples [21][22], namely 
polyethylene glycol 2000 (PEG-2000), polyoxyethylene 
sorbitan 
monopalmitate 
(Tween), 
t-
octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol (TX-100), dicyclohexane-
18-crown-6 (DCH-18C6), polyethylene glycol sebacinate 
(PEGSb), bromocresol blue (BCB). These polymeric 
compounds were dissolved in organic solvents according to 
their polarity: PEG-2000, Tween, ТХ-100 – in acetone, 
DCH-18C6, PEGSb - in toluene, BCB – in ethanol. The 
solutions of polymeric sorbents were immediately used to 
form films on the piezoelectric resonator electrodes without 
their pretreatment with ultrasound (step 3). 
2)  The Method of Forming Films on the Surface of the 
Piezoelectric Quartz Resonator 
The films were uniformly deposited to the electrodes of 
PQRs, fat-free with acetone or chloroform, by immersion in 
solutions of sorbents. 
The forming of films on the electrodes of resonators was 
performed using the following procedure: 
Step 1 – the measurement of the initial oscillation 
frequency of the piezoelectric resonator (10 or 14 MHz) F0, 
Hz with an accurate record, for example, 9999280 Hz; 
Step 2 – suspension was prepared in the beaker as 
dissolution of sorbent (0.5 g) in 10 ml of solvent; 
Step 3 – processing in an ultrasonic bath for 15 minutes 
at a power of 90 W;

Step 4 – exposure of the quartz piezoelectric resonator in 
suspension for 15 s; 
Step 5 – drying the coating in an oven (40 minutes at a 
temperature from 50 ° C) in the holder vertically; 
Step 6 – the measurement of the oscillation frequency of 
the sensor, calculation of the coating mass (Δm) according 
to the Sauerbrey equation [23]:

where ΔF is the change in the oscillation frequency of the 
quartz plate of the resonator after film deposition and 
removal of an unbound solvent, MHz;

cm2/g; 
F0 — base oscillation frequency of the PQR, MHz; 
0.2 – the area of electrodes of PQR, cm2. 
B.  Characteristic of Portable E-nose 
The portable device for diagnosing the status of humans 
and animals is a miniature case, consisting of two functional 
parts (Fig. 1): head 1 and the protective part of the body 6. 
A microprocessor 2 with terminals for sensor mount 
sockets, a block for fixing and transmitting information 3 to 
the recording device (laptop, tablet, personal computer). The 
sockets are located in cover 4, into which removable sensors 
5 are mounted on the outside, separated from the 
environment by the protective part of the body 6, which is 
tightly attached to the head 1. Optionally e-nose is 
supplemented by an internal gas-permeable gasket 7, which 
separates the body's sensor and free air region of the body 6. 
The protective nozzles of various types 8 from inert 
materials (fluoroplastic) are used depending on the nature of 
the analyzed sample to reduce interfering factors (external 
fluctuation in airflow, temperature, air composition in the 
near-sensor space).  
 
 
Figure 1.   General view of the 3D model of the portable e-nose for 
diagnostics: 1 – head; 2 – microprocessor with terminals for sensor mount 
sockets; 3 – block recording and transmitting information to a recording 
device of any type; 4 – cover; 5 – removable sensors; 6 – protective part of 
the body; 7 – internal gas-permeable gasket; 8 – nozzles; 9 – power supply 
from the electricity; 10 – removable battery. 
The e-nose is powered by either an electronic device via 
a USB cable, either from electricity 9 or a removable battery 
10. The developed portable device is an electronically 
counting frequency meter with 8 channels to measure the 
oscillation frequency of BAW-type PQRs with a base 
oscillation frequency of 5 to 20 MHz with a resolution of 1 
Hz a time interval (step) of 1 second. The electronic 
counting frequency meter is switched on in the network 
(220 V); it warms up for 10-15 minutes. In this case, the 
sensors should be in the device to reduce measurement 
errors. Nevertheless, their subsequent inclusion is also 
possible. It takes about 5-10 minutes to stabilize the baseline 
of the oscillation frequency of the quartz plate.  
To 
simultaneously 
record 
(read) 
the 
oscillation 
frequency of each sensor every second for a specific time 
interval (from 1 s to a maximum of 6000 s), the device is 
connected to a computer via USB cable, and other 
connection options are possible (via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth). 
Operating conditions and technical specifications of E-
nose are presented below: 
 
Ambient temperature from +15 to +35 ° С. 
 
Humidity is up to 98% at temperature +35 °C. 
 
The device is powered by an alternating current with 
a voltage of 220 ± 22 V and a frequency of 50 ± 0.5 
Hz. 
 
Frequency range of using PQR 4 MHz – 20 MHz. 
 
The reference frequency oscillator is 4 MHz. 
 
Overall dimensions – 38x120x170 mm. 
 
Weight with a cover – 0.40 kg. 
C.  Specification of Software  
The responses are recorded in the instrument software, 
which saves the measurement and converts it into analytical 
information – a change in the oscillation frequency of each 
resonator individually at each measurement moment relative 
to the starting point of measurement (-ΔF, Hz). The total 
output curve is displayed in a set of chronograms for all 
resonators installed in the e-nose (Fig. 2).

During the interaction of vapors with the surface of the 
piezoelectric sensors, sorption occurs on the films or 
electrodes, resulting in frequency changes. Individual colors 
reflect a change of the base oscillation frequency in time for 
each of the eight piezoelectric sensors (Fig. 2). 
In the developed software based on chronograms, the 
―visual print‖ is constructed using different algorithms 
depending on the purpose of analysis. The quantitative 
characteristic of ―visual prints‖, therefore, the total amount 
of volatile substances excreted by samples and sorbed by 
piezoelectric sensors, is the area of ―visual print‖ (Sv.p., Hz∙s). 
The ―visual print‖ area is calculated in software as a sum of 
definite integrals of time dependence the signals of sensors 
during measurement (chronograms). 
Additionally, in software, the parameters of sorption 
(A(i/j)) are calculated by equation (2), which can be used for 
the identification of volatile substances in the gas phase over 
samples [24][25] or to describe additional analytical 
information about sample characteristics.

where ∆Fi(j) are the maximum responses of piezoelectric 
sensors during the sorption of the gaseous phase over the 
biosamples or skin. 
D.  Technique of Measurement  
The gas phases over nasal mucus samples and skin were 
studied with the front input method into the detection cell. 
The open detection cell of the device contacted the forearm 
area (20 cm2) of the skin or Petri plate with mucus sample to 
analyze the volatile substances excreted by the biosamples. 
The registration time of the sorption of volatile substances 
excreted by biosamples was 80 s, the registration of 
desorption was 120 s. Thus, the total time of one 
measurement was 200 s. The frontal analyte input method in 
detail is described in [26][27]. 
Preliminary, the electronic nose was trained in the same 
technique of measurement by 45 individual substances of 
normal and pathogenic metabolism: C1-C5 alcohols, ketones, 
C5-C7 cyclic ketones, aldehydes, N-, S-containing aldehydes, 
C1-C5 carboxylic acids; primary, tertiary, cyclic amines, O-
containing amines. 
Analysis of the gas phase above the nasal mucus samples 
using an additional array of sensors with films of polymer 
sorbents was carried out immediately after measurements 
with 
the 
main 
array 
of 
sensors 
with 
solid-state 
nanostructured films by the same technique. A detailed 
description of the measurement technique of nasal secretion 
samples is provided elsewhere [27]. 
V.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Examples of using developed sensor device for medical 
applications are provided in this section, including sensor 
data processing algorithms to extract information concerning 
health status.  
A.  Diagnosis of Respiratory Diseases in Calves 
We selected three diagnostic groups of calves based on 
the results of clinical studies, the determination of 
hematological and biochemical markers of inflammation 
(leukocytosis, an increase in the concentration of haptoglobin 
in the blood serum), pathogens of viral and bacterial 
infections accompanied by damage to the respiratory system: 
1 - ―healthy respiratory system‖ (n=4), 2 - ―with signs of 
respiratory disease‖ (n=7), 3 - ―with the subclinical course of 
respiratory diseases‖ (n=6). 
A natural change in the mucus composition taken at a 
weekly interval can reflect only significant changes in the 
condition – for example, a vivid manifestation of the 
inflammatory process. Unlike state-of-the-art approaches to 
diagnosing respiratory diseases by one measurement of 
biosamples [6-8], for the first time, it has been proposed to 
monitor one sample for 5-9 hours with an interval of 2-3 
hours. It allows recording changes in the state at the micro-
level associated with microbiological contamination of the 
sample or its absence. The areas of ―visual prints‖ were 
calculated for all samples of nasal mucus. Early it was shown 
that the values of the ―visual prints‖ area correlate with 
biochemical indicators of inflammation characterizing the 
disease of respiratory organs in calves [28]. 
The results of one-day monitoring of nasal mucus 
samples can be divided into three groups (Fig. 3).  
1) Positive (increasing) dynamics of changes in the value 
of the integral analytical signal of the sensor array (area of 
―visual print‖) - indicates the destruction of nasal mucus and 
production of a large number of volatile compounds, 
including microorganisms metabolites.  
2) The negative (decreasing) dynamics of the change in 
the value of the analytical signal of the sensor array indicates 
the decreasing of volatile substances excreted from nasal 
mucus due to increase of its viscosity by the high level of 
proteins, mucin, which is observed in the acute phase of 
respiratory disease [29]. 
3) The almost constant value of the integral signal from 
the array of sensors, which is observed at the first sign of 
respiratory disease (subclinical course), indicates that the 
excretion of substances at the destruction of nasal mucus and 
the production of metabolites by microorganisms are not so 
active.

of respiratory disease.

When a sample of nasal mucus from an animal with the 
subclinical course of the respiratory disease is taken within 5 
minutes after the first selection, then the time dependence of 
area of ―visual print‖ for this sample will be like for 
conditionally healthy (curve 1, Fig. 3). These facts are in 
good agreement with the data on the formation of local 
protection of the respiratory tract of calves [29].  
The maximum exposure time of nasal mucus samples 
from the moment of sampling to analysis by the array of 
sensors should not exceed 7 hours; with a longer exposure 
time, the differences in the concentration of volatile 
substances between diagnostic groups are disappeared.  
The study of the sorption of the gas phase over nasal 
mucus samples on an additional array of sensors with 
polymer hydrophilic films coatings showed the same trend 
with more significant differences between groups, since 
sensors with polymer films are more sensitive than solid-
state sensors [30], although with a shorter operation time 
[31]. Consequently, during the delayed analysis of nasal 
mucus samples, it was proposed to calculate the ratio of the 
sum of sensor signals (ΣFref.) with hydrophilic polymer 
coatings of the first measurement (1mtesurement) to the one 
carried out after 2 hours for each sample using the equation

The deviation in sensor array responses due to internal 
factors (microelectronic scheme, reproducibility of sensors 
surface) is no more than 5 % [16]. Therefore, if indicator 
ΣFref deviates by more than 15%, the differences in gas 
phases 
over 
biosamples 
are 
statistically 
significant. 
Consequently, based on the established trend by one-day 
monitoring of nasal mucus samples, the group ―healthy 
respiratory system‖ – ΣFref. ≤ 0.85, and for the group ―early 
signs of respiratory disease‖ – ΣFref. ≥ 1.15, the values Fref. 
1.00 ± 0.15 is assigned to the ―with the subclinical course of 
respiratory diseases‖ group.  
Table I shows the proposed classification based on the 
value of indicator ΣFref. and actual diagnostic group for the 
17 studied samples. The proposed indicator was used to rank 
additional 4 samples of nasal mucus of calves to check the 
implementation of such classification. These calves were 
also clinically and laboratory tested to determine the 
diagnostic group (in italics at the bottom of Table I). The 
proposed ranking for 4 samples also correlates with the 
established diagnostic group. Hence, samples of nasal mucus 
from calves with or without infections of the upper 
respiratory tract (nasal cavity, trachea, bronchi) can be 
differentiated using the ΣFref.. 
Thus, several measurements of one biosample during the 
day and simple indicator ΣFref. allow clarifying the degree of 
damage respiratory tract in calves associated with the 
contamination sample.

branched and cyclic ketones, amines; ZrO – alkylamines, cyclic amines, oxy-amines. 
 
For samples of nasal mucus from calves from the group 
"with signs of respiratory disease", conversely, in the first 2-
3 hours after sampling in its gas phase, the proportion of 
volatile aromatic, cyclic amines, nitro compounds is 
significantly decreased and the proportion of oxy- and 
hydroxyacids is increased, with an increase in the proportion 
of ketones, oxy-compounds in the next 4 hours. For samples 
of nasal mucus from calves from the group "with the 
subclinical course of respiratory diseases", a decrease in the 
proportions of all VOC classes in the gas phase over samples 
is observed in the first 2 hours after sampling. In the next 6 
hours in the gas phase, the proportion of VOCs increases up 
to 35% with the predominance of ketones, acids, amines 
(Table II). Thereby, parameters ΣFref. and wi,ref. can be 
applied for estimating respiratory organ state in animals and 
differentiating the disease on farms. 
B. Characterizing the Some Deviation from Normal Health 
Status by Human Skin Odor 
A forearm zone of skin was chosen to scan the whole 
organism's health status according to information about the 
diagnostic significance of the Zakharyin-Ged zone. The 
primary measurement database contained the responses of 8 
sensors in 200 seconds (1590-1600 signals). 
Based on the analysis of the skin odor of 100 volunteers 
in various states according to their words and the results of 
laboratory tests, a primary algorithm of ―visual print‖ 
construction has been developed for linking the features of 
the forms of ―visual prints‖ with the human condition and 
possible causes of deviation (Table III, Fig. 4).  
"Visual print" is a circular diagram of the sensor signals 
at specific points in the process of sorption and desorption of 
volatile substances from the gas phase over biological 
samples.

= ΔF4(30 s)/ΔF4(180 s). 
At β1, β2 ≤ 2.5 pathology occurs 
 
Integral analytical signals of the sensor array when 
measuring the volatile metabolome of the forearm skin are 
visualized in the form of 4 ―visual prints‖ (general state, 
energy, 
endocrine, 
negative, 
Table 
III). 
These 
multidimensional 
responses 
represent 
a 
particular, 
differentiated part of the chronograms of the most 
informative sensors, reflecting the sorption features of 
volatile organic substances established in the preliminary 
training experiment. "Visual prints" differ in the set of time 
points of recording the sensor responses (mask) and the 
number of sensors.  
The largest number of points on the "visual print" 
corresponds to the "General state" algorithm - all 8 sensors 
and 7 time points on the chronograms of complete 
measurement (Table III). It reflects the complete information 
about the nature and concentration of volatile substances in 
the gas phase above the skin.  
The "Energy" algorithm includes the desorption time on 
the most sensitive sensors. It estimates the rate of desorption 
of the volatile metabolome of the skin, presumably 
associated with the production of adenosine triphosphoric 
acids and, as a result, production of the energy by the cell.  
The "Endocrine system" algorithm uses only the 
beginning of the sorption of volatile substances, where the 
difference between volatile products of hormone metabolism 
and other substances is maximally manifested.  
The "Negative" algorithm takes into account the initial 
sorption time and the final desorption time of substances, 
allowing the maximum differentiation of heavy compounds 
(cyclic and aromatic amines, ketones), which are associated 
with the development of negative processes (oncology, 
inflammation, tissue and organ damage).

Figure 4.  Statistically significant typical changes in the shape of the 
integral signals of the sensor array of the portable e-nose (―General state‖ 
algorithm) for different conditions of one person (for left forearm – the blue 
color and for right –red color). 
Masks 
and 
a 
set 
of 
sensors 
for 
constructing 
multidimensional visual signals were selected based on the 
results of preliminary training of the array of sensors for 
individual substances – biomarkers of metabolic disorders 
and the disfunction of individual organs, the presence of 
inflammatory processes in the gaseous phase of biosamples 
[33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44]. 
The 
proposed algorithms are different from the traditional 
approach to visualize the sensor signals used in the state-of-
the-art methods [4]. Moreover, such visualization is more 
straightforward and more evident for the user. 
Based on the data obtained for 400 measurements of 
volatile compounds secreted by the forearm zone of skin, the 
geometric characteristics of ―visual prints‖ and their typical 
shape were determined, corresponding to the reference 
boundaries of the norm for different categories of people 
(men, women, adolescents, dependence on the type of central 
nervous system). The geometric shape of the "visual print" is 
characterized by its rays, area, and the ratio of parts relative 
to the line of symmetry (passes through 80s). Changes in the 
geometric shape of typical ―visual prints‖ at different time 
intervals (for example, the first three points) are signs of a 
change in the composition of the volatile metabolome. The 
features of these changes were compared with a verbal 
description of the condition (headache, stress, fatigue, 
hunger, and others), clinical examination and the presence of 
disease symptoms (runny nose, cough), parameters A(i/j) for 
substances. Fig. 4 shows the comparison of ―visual prints‖ 
forms for left and right hands, used for visual assessment of 
descriptive states. As a result, statistically reliable responses 
and ―visual prints‖ forms were determined, which 
correspond to the physically normal functioning of the body 
(norm), stress, tiredness, inflammation, weakness, in total no 
less than 17 states. The deviation of the geometric shape of 
the "visual print" from the typical one is the first sign of a 
change in health state.  
In a normal state, the qualitative and quantitative 
composition of the volatile metabolome on the left and right 
hand practically does not change - the shape and area of the 
―visual print‖ practically do not differ (Table IV, Fig. 4). 
During an extended stay in a warm or cold room, when a 
person can describe his condition as ―warm‖ or ―cold‖, a 
regular increase or decrease in the amount of excreted 
substances occurs, while the shape of the ―visual print‖ does 
not change (Fig. 4). When the body overheats, changes in the 
volatile metabolome are more significant, the shape of the 
"visual print" changes, associated with a more intense 
excretion of VOCs to maintain homeostasis.

In the presence of pathology and severe symptoms of the 
disease (viral infections, headache, heart weakness, Fig. 4), 
the shape of the ―visual print‖ changes in different ways 
compared to the normal state, which is associated with the 
VOCs of intoxication of the organism. If we normalize for 
one person its average quantitative parameter of the smell 
trace (area of ―visual print‖) by 500 measurements in 
different periods during two years, then the general nature of 
the bias of this indicator will obey the laws presented in 
Table IV. The geometric shape of the ―visual print‖ is strictly 
individual for each person and the calculated parameters 
(A(i/j)) – for health status (Fig. 4, Table V).  
The number of changed parameters and indicators 
depends on the degree of deviation of the health state from 
the norm and correlates with the severity of destructive 
processes during the disease. The shape of ―visual print‖ is 
influenced to a greater extent by the body health, a psycho-
emotional state during measurement, and gender, to a lesser 
extent by age. The reference limits of parameters A(i/j) for 
the degree of deviation from the norm have been established 
for each descriptive state, for instance: the low level of 
tiredness, the middle level of tiredness, the high level of 
tiredness, and the critical level of tiredness. Besides, the 
appearance of individual substances in the descriptive states 
can be evaluated, comparing values of parameters A(i/j) for 
45 substances of normal and pathogenic metabolism with 
those for descriptive states. The ranges of parameters A(i/j) 
for identifying VOC classes and individual compounds are 
described in the works [25][26]. For an array of eight 
sensors, the maximum number of parameters A(i/j) is 28. Of 
these, the values of 21 parameters are statistically significant 
and reliably (according to Pearson's and Student's criteria) 
correlate with changes in clinical and laboratory test results 
or the verbal description of the state by volunteers. Namely, 
four parameters A(i/j) are associated with inflammatory 
processes, 4 – with malfunctions of the gastrointestinal tract 
(spasms of bile streams, slowed metabolism in the liver, 
pancreatitis, ketoacidosis), 3 – with changes in hormones or 
their metabolites (growth hormone, adrenaline, cortisol, sex 
hormones, hypothyroidism). Several parameters reflect 
descriptive conditions, for example, fatigue and its severity 
up to critical exhaustion (Table V). 
For the convenience of deciding the health status of the 
organism, the state sphere is constructed using parameters 
A(i/j) in the software. This program is written in a high-level 
Java language as an Android application, designed to interact 
with the electronic nose device (Fig. 5) and based on 
previous our development [45][46]. Two algorithms have 
been developed to analyze received signals from an array of 
8 sensors. The first allows getting the measurement results 
understandable to any user. Initial processing of the 
measurement results is carried out according to the 
maximum sensor responses. The body's health state decoding 
is displayed on the screen together with a complete set of 
calculated parameters in the form of a sphere (health status 
sphere), where each parameter corresponds to its sector (Fig. 
6).

Figure 5.  The dialoge windows of program to input of sensor responses 
and save the mesurements. 
The sector's colors are determined by the numerical value 
of parameters in Table V. The comments about the body's 
health state or the volatile substances in the analyzed sample 
are displayed depending on the interval in which the 
calculated parameters fall. The complete data about 
measurements (entered and calculated) are saved to the 
database (on a personal device) (Fig. 5). The more green 
sectors in the health status sphere, the closer it is to norm. 
For instance, in Fig. 7 on the sphere of the state, 4 red and 2 
yellow sectors are noted, which corresponds to many 
deviations from the norm: inflammation, disturbances in the 
functioning of the endocrine glands, a violation in the work 
of the excretory system. The value of parameters A(2/6), 
A(4/8) is in the red zone, which corresponds to the spasm and 
problems with the gastrointestinal tract or inflammation and 
the results of clinical and laboratory tests confirm 
inflammatory process in the digestive and respiratory tracts.

In the example in Fig. 8, the presence of inflammation is 
noted, presumably of the gastrointestinal tract by the 
parameters A(2/6), A(4/5), A(4/6), severe exhaustion and 
stress according to parameters A(5/6), A(1/7). Parameter 
A(3/5) reflects the residual processes of food digestion. The 
doctor’s conclusion by the examination of the volunteer with 
the special test was gastritis. According to the survey of this 
volunteer, the study was carried out after a snack due to a 
strong feeling of hunger. Although in the cases of monitored 
diseases, correlations were established between deviations in 
laboratory indicators and parameters of the sensor array, the 
study of the mechanisms of changes in the volatile 
metabolome in the process of biological adaptation in the 
case of specific diseases requires clarification.

Thus, according to the parameters of sensor signals, one 
can easily and quickly obtain comprehensive information 
about the deviation of the health status from the average 
norm.  
The general algorithm for assessing the condition using a 
portable "electronic nose" consists of: 
1) Measurement of the volatile metabolome of the 
forearm skin with an array of 8 sensors. 
2) Processing of sensor chronograms – constructing of 
the "visual prints" and calculation of its area, parameters 
A(i/j). 
3) Comparison of the shape and areas of "visual prints" 
for the left and right hands according to the "General 
condition" algorithm 
4) If there are deviations, we analyze the "visual prints" 
using other algorithms to determine the presumptive reason 
for the deviation. 
5) Deviations identified by other prints are confirmed and 
refined by the parameters A(i/j) in the health status sphere. 
6) If serious deviations are found (the presence of a 
disease, hormonal imbalance, inflammation), it is necessary 
to consult a specialist and take specific laboratory tests. 
At the moment, according to the collected base of 
measurements, the sensitivity and specificity of determining 
descriptive states (fatigue, anxiety, stress, excitement, and 
others) is 98 %, clinical cases of the disease, including 
exacerbation of chronic illness, – up to 80%. The sensitivity 
of determining deviations in some blood test indicators 
(changes in hormonal balance, including during a monthly 
cycle in women, an increase in glucose levels) reaches 
100%. 
Thereby, using portable e-nose for scanning volatilome 
secreted by the skin allows determining the diverse variation 
in health status, including the descriptive states, the presence 
of individual volatile substances at ppm-level. 
VI.  CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
According to the responses of the electronic nose, when 
monitoring biosamples of nasal mucus from 17 calves during 
5-9 hours, with an interval of 2-3 hours, the changes in the 
qualitative and quantitative composition of biosamples gas 
phase possible to assess atraumatic, on a place. The proposed 
parameter ΣFref. can be used to differentiate the diagnostic 
group of calves, identifying the animals that needed medical 
treatment. 
For the first time, a fundamentally new approach is 
proposed for a quick assessment of the health status of the 
human body as a whole (normal, stress, inflammation) and 
the work of individual systems (reproductive, endocrine, 
digestive), based on the results of an assessment of the 
qualitative and quantitative composition of the gas mixture 
of biomolecules secreted by the skin in the forearm and the 
Zakharyin-Ged zone.  
The correct interpretation and prediction of the status of 
biosamples and a person’s state have been proved by 
different analyses (leukogram, biochemical, microbiological, 
molecular genetic analysis). The algorithms are proposed for 
reading and visualizing signals from an array of sensors 
understandable to any user.  
The time of one analysis of volatile substances excreted 
by the biosamples or skin using portable e-nose, including 
visualization and processing, is up to 5 min that is faster than 
described in works [3][4][5][6], and without any sample 
preparation, unlike other modern research [3][8][9].  
We believe that proposed in this work approach in the 
analysis by sensor array is appropriate for other biosamples, 
such as blood, cervical mucus, exhaled breath condensate, 
and urine. 
In future works, we plan to expand the set of parameters 
when processing sensor chronograms to better specify the 
state of a person and differentiate states corresponding to one 
parameter value, such as stress, inflammation, and 
gastrointestinal problems. Investigation of idiosyncratic 
changes in humans and animals is one of the future work 
tasks. Also, we plan to improve the algorithm for deciding on 
the dominant reason for the deviation from the norm state to 
include it in the sensor data processing program.
