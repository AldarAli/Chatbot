Abstract—Understanding the trends in the use of wireless local 
area networks (WLANs) (i.e., how much, when and where 
traffic is present) is an important issue for modeling the 
network and for optimizing the allocated resources. Interesting 
results can be extracted by analyzing traces from real 
scenarios. In previous works, the authors studied three 
buildings belonging to two campuses in Barcelona (Spain) and 
its surroundings. Similar common trends were observed in the 
three buildings, despite the different amount of users, purpose 
of the building, geographical location and size of the campus. 
In this work, the fidelity of the users in accessing the WLAN in 
different days is analyzed in depth. The population accessing 
the networks is mostly composed of infrequent users: less than 
half of the devices access the WLAN more than four days 
during the studied period. Special insight is given to the 
underlying distribution. It is shown that, in contrast to 
previous studies in the same environment, the distribution of 
the frequency of reconnections to the WLAN is not uniform. 
The main difference among different buildings is the fidelity of 
users: users on a small campus are more likely to reappear on 
different days than on a large campus, where the population is 
more heterogeneous. The results of this analysis provide 
general tools for characterizing campus-wide WLAN and a 
better understanding of usage and performance issues in a 
mature wireless network in Europe.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Among other advantages, wireless communications 
provide flexibility in the deployment of the network and 
allow users to move around while connected. Users are 
increasingly interested in taking advantage of the flexibility 
of wireless technology, and a boom in its implementation to 
local area networks has been seen. There are many 
applications of wireless local area networks (WLAN) to 
universities, from the classical communications (including 
email and web browsing) to special e-learning applications. 
Accordingly, universities have pioneered the development of 
infrastructures to provide connectivity. An example is the 
Wireless Andrew at the Carnegie Mellon University campus 
[1], an enterprise-wide broadband wireless network 
developed in 1993.  
In the last decade, research has been carried out to 
understand the use of WLAN (typically using standard IEEE 
802.11) networks in different scenarios, like campus-wide 
universities 
[2]-[9], 
corporate 
networks 
[10], 
and 
metropolitan area networks [11]. All these works differ in the 
way in which data are collected; tcpdump, the Simple 
Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and syslog are the 
most common tools. Tcpdump is normally used to sniff the 
traffic and analyze the applications run by users and the 
amount of data managed in the network [2], [4], [5], while 
SNMP is applied to periodically poll the access points (APs) 
of the network [2], [10] and to obtain information regarding 
the authenticated/associated users and their approximate 
location (i.e., the coverage range of the AP to which a user is 
associated). Information on the authenticated/associated 
devices at each AP can also be obtained through syslog [4], 
[7], a standard for forwarding log messages in an IP (Internet 
Protocol) network. As found in [12], although polling-based 
trace collection is suitable for usage statistics, it is not very 
suitable for deriving the association patterns of users because 
they tend to overlook details of association changes due to 
the polling interval. Differences may also be found in the 
duration of the period analyzed; some span a period of a 
week [3], in which case weekly cycles cannot be observed, 
others one month [10], and others three to five months [2], 
[4], [5], [7], in which case monthly patterns can also be 
observed. Each work can also involve different numbers of 
users. In previous studies, number of users ranged from 74 
users in the earliest study [2] to 8 thousand in wider 
environments [4], [5], [7], [10]. 
In this work, we process data recently collected at the 
Technical University of Catalonia (UPC), Spain, from March 
to May 2009. UPC is composed of eight campuses in 
Barcelona and its surroundings. Wireless local area network 
traffic is analyzed at each building separately to deal with 
homogeneous data and not to mix behaviors from 
populations with different features. Two libraries were 
selected. The first one, BRGF, is located on a large campus 
in Barcelona, while the second one, EDSE, is on a campus in 
Castelldefels. Results from another building (EETAC) in 
Castelldefels, a faculty building with classrooms and 
studying rooms, are also provided. To complete the work 
presented in [7], this paper analyzes the frequency in the 
connections to the WLAN. A fitting distribution is found 
which can be used to describe how often the same user will 
appear in the network during a given period of time. 
Differences are found with respect to previous works in a 
wide university [4], while the pattern is more similar to that 
found in a corporate network [10].

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a 
summary of the related literature. Section 3 provides details 
of the methodology followed to collect the data from the 
WLAN and of the environment where the analysis was 
conducted. Main findings on users’ activity are given in 
Section 4. The frequency of user’s connections is examined 
in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
Several studies have been performed to analyze network 
traffic and user behavior in different WLAN environments. 
The first study was performed at the Computer Science 
Department of Stanford University in 1999 [2]. In this work, 
the authors prepared a testbed with 74 laptops. Users moved 
freely inside a building and the authors analyzed their 
movements and traffic during three months. Data were 
collected using three different techniques (i.e., tcpdump 
traces, SNMP polling and authentication logs). During the 
day, they observed higher activity in the afternoon, while 
during the week they found lower activity in the weekends. 
They found out that most users did not move much within 
the building; however, a few users were highly mobile. 
Regarding the total number of days that users are active 
(present in the network) during the traced period, they found 
that while some users rarely connect their laptops to the 
network (17 users do so on 5 days or less), others connect 
their laptops frequently (14 users are active at least 37 days 
during the traced period).  
The use of the WLAN at the Saskatchewan University 
Campus was presented in [3]. The campus is composed of 40 
buildings covering public spaces (i.e., lounges, libraries, 
coffee shops, etc.), classrooms, laboratories and offices. A 
traffic trace was collected during one week in January 2003 
using EtherPeek, a software package that allows researchers 
to record MAC (i.e., Medium Access Control) addresses and 
traffic load information. MAC addresses were matched with 
the authentication logs obtained from each of the 18 APs of 
the campus. In total, 134 unique users connected to the 
network during the week under study. Individual users 
visited at most 8 different APs. Regarding the number of 
authentications, they observed that more than half of the total 
number of users authenticated more than 50 times during the 
week. According to the method used for collecting traces, 
they stated that authentications cannot be literally interpreted 
as distinct sessions of network usage. 
Generalization of the results presented in these works is 
difficult due to the low number of users observed (74, 134 
and 195, respectively). Moreover, the fact that users knew 
about the tracing study may have perturbed the user behavior 
in [2], while in [3] authors are aware that no effort was made 
to ensure that the week they analyzed was representative of 
overall usage patterns.  
Kotz and Essien analyzed the wireless network at 
Dartmouth College during three months [4] and extracted 
information about users’ mobility, card and building activity, 
traffic load and protocols. The main results are that network 
activity shows clear patterns: almost half of the users were 
active on a typical day, and about one third of those were 
mobile. The weekly pattern showed a typical student’s 
pattern of activity, with lower activity on Fridays and 
Saturdays, and a pick up on Sundays. Users varied in the 
number of days that they used their cards, from only once to 
every day in the 77-day trace (many users lived on campus 
and could be always on-line). The distribution of the 
frequency in the user activity is roughly uniform between 
one and 77 days, with a median of 28 days. In 2004, they 
revisited the WLAN [5] and found that, despite a drastic 
increase in traffic, users were mainly non-mobile.  
Similar user patterns were found in a corporate network 
from July 20 to August 17, 2002 [10]. Despite mobility 
results report higher mobility than on university campuses, 
users still spend a large fraction of time at only one location. 
The results regarding the daily and weekly patterns are 
similar to those observed on university campuses. The 
number of days that users connected to the WLAN varies 
greatly: only 12% to 25% of users are present more than 18 
out of the 20 work days, whereas 22% to 38% of users 
appear only during one or two days (i.e., outside visitors 
mostly from other sites that the company has in the same 
metropolitan area). The presence of visitors and the absence 
of employees were uniformly distributed. In terms of the 
fraction of days that users access the network, the 
distribution is similar to a single building on a university 
campus [2]. Compared with a whole campus [4], more users 
appeared only one or two days (visitors) and fewer users 
appeared more than 2/3 of the days. The authors observed 
that the higher uniformity of a campus wide distribution 
might be related to the fact that the study tracked many users 
for prolonged periods of time (i.e., students living on 
campus) and not only when they went to work in specific 
buildings.  
Mc Nett and Voelker analyzed the mobility patterns of 
users of wireless handheld PDAs in a campus wireless 
network using trace belonging to 11 weeks of wireless 
network activity. They also observed the frequency of 
connections in their traces: 50% of the users initiated more 
than 77 sessions over the trace period. This means that the 
median user initiated an average of one session per day over 
the trace period. Still, 20% of the users initiate roughly three 
sessions per day, and 10% initiated roughly four connections 
per day. To understand user activity on a day to day basis, 
they analyzed the number of days the users actually turned 
on their PDAs. Half the users turned on their devices less 
than 21 days during the trace. This is lower than the median 
number of days from [4]. Moreover, the distribution is not 
uniform as observed in [4]; 8% of the users only used their 
PDAs one day during their trace period. The number of users 
for each number of active days tends to drop from there. 
20% of the users used their PDAs 60% of the total days; 
10% used them more than 75% of the total days; and there 
were a few users who used their PDAs nearly every day. 
The trends regarding the frequency of connections 
observed at the three buildings of the UPC are presented in 
the following sections. Not only the users’ behavior will be 
related to the environment and compared with previous 
similar works. A deeper insight will be given to the 
underlying distribution, in order to model the fidelity of the 
user in the WLAN network.

III. 
TRACE COLLECTION AND SCENARIO 
This paper analyzes data collected during 3 months from 
March 2009. Users were not informed that the study was 
performed. The only sensitive information gathered were the 
MAC and IP addresses of network cards connected to the 
network and the name assigned to each AP; these data are 
not shown. 
The data were collected with syslog [14], which is a 
standard client/server protocol for forwarding log messages 
in an IP network: the client sends a small textual message to 
the syslog server through User Datagram Protocol and/or 
Transport Control Protocol connections. The access points 
were configured to send syslog messages to a central server 
whenever they received authentication, deauthentication, 
association or disassociation IEEE 802.11 messages. Each 
message contains the AP name, the MAC address of the 
card, the time stamp at which the AP received the message to 
1-second precision, and the type of message. From the MAC 
address, it is possible to relate a given address to a given 
device; however, the same user may have multiple cards, or 
the same device can be used by different persons. In the rest 
of the paper, we will use the term “device” to refer to a given 
MAC address.  
According 
to 
the 
IEEE 
802.11 
standard, 
after 
authentication, a device chooses the best AP among a list of 
nearby APs and associates with it. When a device no longer 
needs to use the network, it disassociates with its current AP. 
Disassociation can be due to the device moving into another 
cell (i.e., handover), to authentication problems, or to the 
device leaving the network. The aim of this study is to 
analyze users’ frequency of connections to the WLAN and 
extract the underlying distribution. For this purpose, only 
IEEE 802.11 association frames are considered. A device 
can only associate to an AP to which it has authenticated 
before, so authentication messages can be ignored. In order 
to catch users’ frequency, the number of days an association 
response frame is received by a given device is calculated. 
The same for each device observed in the trace (see last row 
in Table I) 
A. Library in Barcelona (BRGF) 
The campus in Barcelona houses the faculties of 
Information and Communication Technologies and of Civil 
Engineering, with a total of 4,339 students. On this campus, 
one can also find research centers, the library, student 
associations, and the UPC Foundation, which is dedicated to 
lifelong learning and professional retraining. The central 
library (BRGF) is housed in a five-story building of 6,300 
m2, four above-ground floors and one basement. People 
access the library from the ground floor, where the loan 
service is housed. The first and second floors house the 
library collection, which is divided according to the specific 
subjects taught on the campus; students spend their time 
there to work on their subjects and to study. The third floor 
provides specific documentation for PhD students and 
researchers. In the basement, there are two studying rooms 
and two rooms for foreign languages teaching. BRGF 
provides room for about 700 users and provides 63 desktop 
PCs and 9 laptops for library users. BRGF is open from 9 am 
to 9 pm from Monday to Friday, and during the exam period, 
the opening hours are extended until 2:30 am and during 
weekends. 
The WLAN infrastructure at BRGF is composed of eight 
APs on the first four floors and four APs in the basement, 
which provide good coverage all over the building. A total of 
5,917 devices associated to the wireless network during the 
whole trace period. Table I summarizes the main parameters 
of the three buildings.  
B. Library in Castelldefels (EDSE) 
The Castelldefels campus houses the Castelldefels 
School of Technology (EETAC), the School of Agricultural 
Engineering of Barcelona and a library; it is located 30 km 
from Barcelona. The library is housed in a three-story 
building. It is open from 8 am to 9 pm from Monday to 
Friday. Three APs are located on the ground floor (edse002 
to edse004) where the loan service is located, four on the 
first floor (edse101 to edse104) and two on the second floor 
(edse201 and edse202), where the library collection and the 
studying rooms are located.  
The infrastructure provides good coverage inside the 
building. In this analysis, the APs in the basement are also 
considered (edses01 to edses04) because students go to the 
bar and connect to the WLAN from there as well. A total of 
1,419 devices associated to the wireless network during the 
whole trace period. 
C. Classrooms (EETAC) 
EETAC is a Higher Education School specializing in 
technical and scientific courses in Aeronautics and 
Telecommunications. It is housed in the Castelldefels 
campus. The total number of students attending classes at 
EETAC is about 1,500 persons. The building houses 20 
classrooms, 25 laboratories, professors’ offices and 2 
studying rooms, all distributed on 3 floors. It is open from 8 
am to 9 pm from Monday to Friday. 
The WLAN infrastructure at EETAC is composed of 
twelve access points, which provide good coverage 
throughout the building. A total of 1,417 devices associated 
to the wireless network during the whole trace period. 
IV. 
COMPARISON OF THE ACTIVITY 
In our previous study [7], the association pattern was 
observed during the three-month period. Table I reports the 
main parameters of the three scenarios. The number of APs 
providing the WLAN infrastructure is the same in the three 
buildings, despite the EETAC building is more than three 
time bigger than EDSE building. The number of students in 
the Barcelona campus is 3 times that in the Castelldefels 
campus, while the number of detected devices at BRGF is 
higher than the number of students due to the proximity to 
other university (e.g., students from outside the UPC are 
using the WLAN). Since the Castelldefels campus is far 
away from other universities, the number of detected devices 
nearly equals the number of students.  
Details on the user behavior at each building are given in 
[7]. A decrease in the usage of the WLAN was observed at 
each building during Easter holidays (one week in April), 
71

during weekends at the two buildings in Castelldefels, during 
one week in April at EETAC building due to exam period. In 
order to deal with homogeneous data, only the working days 
in March and May are taken into account in the rest of the 
paper (no holidays, nor weekends). April is skipped due to 
inconstant activity.  
V. 
FREQUENCY OF CONNECTIONS 
The empirical cumulative distribution (CDF) of devices 
according to the number of days per period that they appear 
as active is shown in Figure 1. At BRGF, more than 50% of 
the devices connect just once or twice in two months. This 
proportion of infrequent users decreases for EDSE (35%) 
and EETAC (24%). This is explained by the proximity 
between the library at BRGF and other campuses that cause

a higher proportion of occasional visits; in a smaller campus, 
on the other hand, users tend to re-appear more often. 10% of 
the users at each building appear: more than 12 days at 
BRGF; more than 21 days at EDSE; and more than 24 days 
at EETAC. Again, more similar trends are observed in the 
Castelldefels campus. The number of very frequent users 
(i.e., those who appear more than 30 days over the whole 
period) is 1% at BRGF and 4% at both buildings in 
Castelldefels. The building housing classrooms (EETAC) 
displays the highest fidelity among the three buildings (lower 
number of infrequent users, and higher number of very 
frequent users).  
Table II resumes the trends observed in previous similar 
works. Results in [4] and [6] show very different behaviors if 
compared with our trace, despite all refer to traces taken 
from university campuses. In these other works, the 
percentage of users who connect once or twice during the 
whole period is lower than in our traces; half of the users 
connect more often; 10% of the users connect more than 
91% of the days in [4] and more than 75% in [6], which are 
higher than in our trace. The distribution in [4] is roughly 
uniform between one and 77 days. On the other hand, the 
figure observed in a corporate network [10] is more similar 
to the one observed in our trace. EDSE can be compared to 
the small building (SBldg) in [10], while EETAC to the large 
building (LBldg). This similarity with a corporate building is 
due to the fact that, at UPC, students do not spend the night 
inside the campus (which is instead typical in the campuses 
in the US) but go home at night and return the next day they 
have classes; this behavior is similar to that of a worker. 
BRGF shows quite different trends, with the highest 
percentage of infrequent users (connected up to 2 days) and 
the lowest percentage of constant users.  
The probability mass function of devices that are active a 
given number of days is shown in black in Figures 2 to 4 for 
BRGF, EDSE and EETAC building, respectively. Three 
theoretical distributions have been proposed and tested 
through the Chi-Square goodness of fit (gof) test: Zipf, 
geometric and negative binomial. The latter is not 
represented in the figures since it gives the worst matching.  
Moments' matching has been applied to estimate the 
parameters for each distribution, as shown in Table III. 
Again the lowest mean belongs to the BRGF due to its 
proximity to other similar campuses.

The Chi-Square gof test with 5% significance was 
performed for each building and distribution. Given the null 
hypothesis that the fitting distribution is F, this test compares 
the number Oi of observed elements of the empirical 
distribution in category Ci (for i = 1,2,…,k), with the 
expected number Ei of elements of F in category Ci. As a 
measure of comparison the test uses [15]:

χ2 is known as the Chi-Square test statistic: if it is greater 
or equal to the critical value χ2
α, then the null hypothesis that 
the fitting distribution is F must be rejected at level α. The 
critical value depends on the level of significance α and on 
the sample size n (see Table III), and can be computed as:

where zα can be found in [15]. In this paper, we use z0.05 = 
1.6449. The test statistic χ2 and the critical value χ2
α are 
displayed in Table IV.  
For all the buildings, the Zipf distribution provides a 
good fit. According to the Zipf law’s, the frequency of active 
days is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency 
table. Thus the most frequent number of active days will 
occur approximately twice as often as the second most 
frequent number of active days, three times as often as the 
third most frequent number of active days, etc. For the 
EETAC building, the best fit is provided by the geometric 
distribution. Despite the similarities shown in Table II, the 
distribution for the two buildings at the Castelldefels campus 
is not the same. Instead, the same distribution characterizes 
the frequency in the connection to the WLAN in the libraries 
(BRGF and EDSE), while a different behavior is shown in a 
building housing classes.

CONCLUSIONS 
The frequency of the connections at three different 
buildings in two different campuses of the UPC in Barcelona 
(Spain) has been investigated. It has been shown that the 
trends are more similar to those observed in a corporate 
network [10] than to those reported from other universities in 
the USA [4][6]. This is mainly due to the fact that the 
students in Barcelona do not live inside the campus, so their 
pattern is more similar to that of workers. The distribution of 
the active days has been analyzed through the Chi-Square 
goodness of fit test: the same distribution (Zipf) can 
characterize the behavior at the libraries of both campuses, 
while the geometric distribution better fit the behavior in the 
building with classrooms. The results presented in this paper 
provide general tools for characterizing campus-wide 
WLAN and a better understanding of usage and performance 
issues in a mature wireless network in Europe. These 
findings may be useful both for those researchers interested 
in simulations under realistic scenarios and for optimal 
planning of a WLAN infrastructure in similar environments.
