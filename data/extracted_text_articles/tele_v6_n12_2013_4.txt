Abstract‚ÄîThe challenges Intelligent Transportation Systems 
(ITS) address have only increased in time as, along with fast 
and cost-effective route planning, environmental sensibilities 
are nowadays also prominent. Currently, many ITS related 
studies focus on studying Car-to-Car (C2C) and Car-to-
Infrastructure (C2I) communications in Vehicular Ad-hoc 
Network (VANET) environments. The utilization of such 
infrastructure-less and flexible topology networks poses several 
challenges for the routing mechanism aiming to achieve 
effective and efficient message delivery, specifically through 
broadcasts. This paper presents a new broadcast-based 
message delivery approach termed the Traffic Message 
Delivery Algorithm (TMDA) optimized for a city-based 
VANET setting. TMDA considers urban traffic travelling 
patterns and has been designed to exploit the route properties 
of different vehicle types such as cars and buses. In the case of 
the latter, TMDA adjusts its message propagation strategy so 
that bus routes, which intuitively involve elements (buses) with 
predictable routes, help propagate broadcast messages to a 
whole region which may otherwise have been disconnected. We 
investigate and compare the communications performance of 
vehicle groups under TMDA against other broadcast protocols 
through a set of experiments using NS-2 to simulate 
communications and SUMO to create representative mobility 
patterns. The simulation outcomes show that TMDA 
outperforms its competitors in efficiency and reliability while 
avoiding the deteriorating effects of a broadcast storm.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Traffic demands in urban environments have been 
growing in recent years, following the proliferation of 
vehicles in the developing world and increasing worker 
mobility in modern economies. Utilising technology to help 
optimise existing traffic patterns and anticipate future 
demands has been a perpetual goal of Intelligent 
Transportation Systems (ITS). The availability of in-car 
wireless capabilities as well as the definition of 
interoperable vehicular communication standards worldwide 
has allowed for practically deployable decentralised ITS 
solutions alongside the more traditional centralised 
approach. As future trends indicate that in the near future 
urban centres will keep growing in importance and size, 
traffic coordination fuels and is fuelled by this growth, thus 
failing to manage it could stunt city development.  
The importance of ITS in urban environments has been 
highlighted several times in the literature, with many 
developments helping define and expand its role [2-4]. A 
major theme in such works is decentralisation in the sense 
that traffic participants can be used as a practical tool to 
achieve efficient and reliable message propagation. 
Intuitively, vehicles are mobile entities with both 
predictable and unpredictable paths and so can be transports 
of messages to different sections of a city even if these are 
not covered by fixed ITS infrastructure. Further, fixed 
infrastructure facilities that can help propagate messages 
may be used in a complementary fashion helping the overall 
network to achieve an acceptable degree of connectivity. As 
a result of their great potential Car-to-Car (C2C) and Car-to-
Infrastructure (C2I) solutions have received much attention 
[2], [5-8]. 
Several ITS related completed and on-going projects can 
be found in the seventh EU Framework Programme for 
Research and Technological Development [2], such as  the 
Cooperative Vehicle-Infrastructure Systems (CVIS) project 
[5], which investigates interactions between vehicles and 
transport infrastructures for road safety. Another noteworthy 
and influential project is SAFESPOT [6], which considers 
intelligent information exchanges between vehicles and 
roadside units to realize safe and efficient transportation. 
Other works such as [7] recommend the deployment 
of roadside stations as it considers that infrastructure is a 
prerequisite for particular transportation monitors such as 
speed advisories and route navigation. These projects, 
among others, attempt to integrate C2C and C2I 
applications to achieve a combined benefit whilst 
highlighting that C2I can help improve ITS outcomes by 
utilizing roadside units (RSU), access points (AP) and 
cellular base-station information. 
Even though C2I applications are broadly deployed 
compared to C2C applications, they exhibit well-studied 
weaknesses such as higher cost of infrastructure deployment 
[8], lower speed of connections [9] and smaller volume of 
handled data [10]. Importantly, C2C communications in 
Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs), which are by 
definition infrastructure-free, self-governing and self-
organized, can help effectively address such issues.

This study contributes to the C2C communication 
potential in a VANET architecture deployed in an urban 
(city) environment. It proposes a novel and efficient 
broadcast-based message dissemination algorithm termed 
the Traffic Message Delivery Algorithm (TMDA) which 
makes use of known travel route information for public 
(buses) or private  vehicles (considering route intentions 
declared via Sat-Nav devices) to efficiently spread messages 
of interest through the network. The proposed algorithm is 
evaluated via extensive simulation, as opposed to testbed 
assessment [11-13], using the Network Simulator 2 (NS-2) 
[14] to model communications and the Simulation of Urban 
Mobility (SUMO) [15] to model the mobility pattern based 
on the topography of the city centre of Nottingham in the 
UK.  
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The next 
section presents a literature review of existing broadcasting 
techniques in ad-hoc networks outlining their respective 
strengths and weaknesses. Section 3 describes a VANET-
based C2C communication architecture proposed in previous 
work, which works in tandem with existing fixed 
infrastructure features to more effectively accommodate ITS 
functions. Section 4 contains an in-depth description of our 
novel message delivery algorithm termed TMDA, intended 
for use in the VANET C2C setting described in the previous 
section. Section 5 describes the simulation parameters used 
in the subsequent evaluation of TMDA. Then, Section 6 
presents the simulation results and an in-depth discussion of 
TMDA performance. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper 
and offers suggestions for future work.

RELATED WORK 
Flooding is a classic broadcasting method used in ad-hoc 
networks [3], [16], [17]. In this method, each of the nodes 
broadcasts or rebroadcasts a packet to all their neighbouring 
nodes the first time they receive it; if it has been received 
before they discard the packet to avoid redundant 
retransmissions. Ho et al. [18] state that simple flooding, 
also known as blind flooding [19] provides minimal state 
and high reliability, which are suitable for high mobility 
networks such as MANETs and VANETs.  
Broadcast-based protocols suffer from high redundancy 
and transmission congestions, known as broadcast storms. 
Presently, several different broadcasting mechanisms are 
implemented in routing protocols to address this problem. 
Based on in-depth overviews of different protocols in [3] and 
[20], we only concentrate on those studies which are directly 
related to our area of focus, specifically those that propose 
delay-based, position-based and probability-based methods 
to mitigate broadcast storms. 
A. Delay-based Protocols 
In order to alleviate the negative effects of simultaneous 
broadcasting collisions, different methods have been adopted 
to generate forwarding delays. 
In [21], the authors suggest a Vehicle-Density-based 
Emergency Broadcasting (VDEB) protocol which takes into 
account the sender-receiver distance. It obtains the distance 
from the interaction of neighbouring nodes, i.e., from 
acknowledgement (ACK) packets, and assigns a waiting 
time-slot for the rebroadcast action so that simultaneous 
forwarding can be avoided. The Beaconless routing 
algorithm (BLR) [22] applies a similar idea. Here, the delay 
is defined as deferring time which represents a relationship 
between transmission range and one-hop distance between 
the last sender and the current receiver. In Urban Multi-hop 
Broadcast (UMB) [23], which functions over IEEE 802.11, 
the farthest vehicles forward the received data first and then 
inform other nodes in between. Furthermore, Zhang et al. 
suggested a Neighbor Coverage-Based Probabilistic (NCPR) 
protocol [4], which defines a rebroadcast delay. The 
difference between NCPR and other protocols is that the 
delay is calculated based on a uncovered neighbour set 
ùëà(ùëõùëñ) and covered neighbour sets of node s and ùëõùëñ ‚àí ùëÅ(ùë†) 
and ùëÅ(ùëõùëñ).  
B. Position-based Protocols 
There exists a set of protocols which work with the 
position of nodes. In such cases, the nodes within or towards 
a particular area are the only ones that can rebroadcast 
messages. For example, the BLR [22] protocol specifies a 
Forwarding Area (FA). The nodes positioned inside the FA 
are the only ones that can rebroadcast the message. The 
shape of FA, which is defined as a sector in BLR [22] is 
considered as an issue. Position-based Opportunistic Routing 
(POR) [24] is another example of Position-based protocols 
and it defines the shape of FA as an area with positive 
progress towards a terminus. 
C. Probability-based Protocols 
Probability-based forwarding is another widely adopted 
approach to address the problem of broadcast storms. For 
example, Ni et al. [25] assume that the nodes should 
rebroadcast the received packet by following predetermined 
probabilities. So, if the probability is 100%, the scheme will 
be identical to blind flooding. The aforementioned NCPR 
[4] protocol uses a probability scheme to control the 
forwarding candidates. The authors in [25] introduce 
additional coverage ratio and connectivity factors to 
calculate the rebroadcast probability for each node. Higher 
coverage ratio means that there are more nodes that should 
be covered in the rebroadcast and therefore, the rebroadcast 
probability needs to be set to a high value (e.g., 0.75), 
allowing more nodes to dispose of Route Request (RREQ) 
packets. Meanwhile, although the connectivity factor 
increases the rebroadcast probability for the node in a sparse 
network with poor connectivity, it decreases the rebroadcast 
probability for nodes located in a dense network.  
Current broadcasting protocols have improved the 
communication performance in terms of transmission 
efficiency and reliability. However, as Ros et al. [26] 
present, there are other factors such as uneven distributions 
of vehicles and their travelling speeds which are specific to

VANET networks. In sparse network scenarios such as 
VANETs, appropriate protocols should be applied to deal 
with the high number of disconnections and their impact on 
message exchanges. Many existing approaches [21], [24], 
[27] utilize acknowledgement packets for this purpose. For 
example, Lee et al. [28] introduce a method for periodically 
broadcasting to neighbouring nodes. In this approach, 
neighbouring nodes of one-hop distance will be able to 
disperse the message to higher distance hops when they are 
in one-hop distance with them because of their mobility 
freedom. As another method, Kitani et al. [29] suggest the 
concept 
of 
‚Äòmessage 
ferrying' 
in 
inter-vehicle 
communications, introducing bus as the ferry rather than a 
vehicle. Message ferrying is proposed to improve the 
efficiency of information sharing in sparse areas by relying 
on buses‚Äô regular routes and their ability to help with 
collecting more traffic information. 
In VANETs, there are diverse and changeable 
communication demands and traffic problems can occur at 
any time in different areas. These characteristics make it very 
difficult for a communication protocol to perform adequately 
in typical communication scenarios and, it would be fair to 
state, there has not yet been any comprehensive and popular 
message delivery algorithm to do so. Researchers have 
proposed algorithms which include particular traffic 
information, such as the inclusion of the acknowledgments 
into the periodic beacons for high reliability in [28] and the 
inclusion of vehicles' status and surrounding information in 
[30]. So far, on the basis of studies in the literature, explicitly 
utilising scheduled routes information has not been 
considered as a means to improving network coverage or 
message dissemination; the proposed TMDA algorithm in 
this paper addresses this void. 
III. 
A VANET FRAMEWORK 
In previous work, we introduced a VANET architecture 
[31] 
which 
accommodates 
spontaneous 
wireless 
communications occurring within a group of wireless mobile 
nodes, as shown in Figure 1. The architecture integrates 
features of traditional ad-hoc networking and VANET 
technologies allowing for both intra-network and inter-
network 
connections 
with 
gateway 
functions 
providing access to the Internet  [32]. 
In this setting, we focus on the aspect of the 
communication system which utilizes vehicles (roaming 
agents) for routing purposes via the inclusion of traffic route 
information. To better utilise the potential of the 
vehicle/node as a message forwarding device when 
communications occur, the system distinguishes them in 
three types: mobile, semi-mobile and static nodes.  
Mobile nodes, such as private vehicles, are defined as 
common ad-hoc nodes without pre-conceived routes that are 
able to consume and forward messages. As these are the 
most prolific in public road networks (privately owned 
vehicles outnumber publically or state owned ones in most 
settings), they form the majority group in acting as message 
forwarders and consumers. As vehicles can be generally 
equipped with highly capable electronic devices for message 
storage, they can also act as long-storage and dissemination 
agents for relevant messages through the network. The 
routes of such nodes cannot easily be predicted as it depends 
on the will of the owner at the time - i.e., the routes are 
largely unpredictable and cannot be known in advance. 
Semi-mobile 
nodes, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
have 
predetermined routes which they follow at particular times; 
the most characteristic example of such vehicles is a bus 
following a particular bus route. In the particular case of 
buses, which is the semi-mobile node type considered in this 
study there is opportunity of including more powerful 
devices with greater storage than in cars due to the larger 
physical size of the bus vehicle. As such messages can be 
cached for longer before they are propagated (due to 
increased storage space), the communications range may be 
greater with the use of directional antennas (the cost of 
additional antennas is small compared to the cost of the 
bus)  and more messages may be processed at the time (due 
to the availability of greater processing power). The 
presence of semi mobile nodes allows the predictable re-
connection of possibly disconnected network segments and 
allows message propagation to reach, with predictable 
delay, areas in the road network where mobile node traffic is 
sparse. Further, in many cities there are dedicated bus-lanes 
or bus-priority lanes which help guarantee travel times for 
commuters even in times of peak traffic; as such the 
scheduled travelling times of semi-mobile bus nodes are 
more reliable than the predictable travelling time of other 
semi-mobile vehicles (such as police patrol cars). 
Static nodes are fixed infrastructure units with the ability 
to relay and consume messages. These cannot ensure road 
network coverage on their own due to their high expense of 
deployment but instead cooperate with the other two node 
types to aid communication in the network. Broadly, these 
are termed roadside units and, in general, have few 
processing power and storage limitations.

The message delivery algorithm described in the next 
section is specifically designed to meet the requirements of 
C2C communications in this VANET framework by taking 
advantage of the three types of traffic participant mentioned 
above. We generally assume a sparse presence of static 
nodes (due to their cost) and mostly rely on mobile and semi-
mobile vehicles to achieve message dissemination. 
IV. 
TMDA ‚Äì NOVEL MESSAGE DELIVERY ALGORITHM 
Traffic Message Delivery Algorithm (TMDA) is a novel 
broadcasting-based algorithm designed for improving 
communication performance in the VANET network 
configuration described in the previous section. The TMDA 
version used here is identical to that used in previous work 
[1]; however, it is examined here more thoroughly. The 
main difference between TMDA and previously proposed 
broadcast methods is that it does not implement only a 
single broadcasting approach - such as simple flooding, 
delay-based, 
position-based 
or 
neighbourhood-based 
methods [34] - but also adopts intelligent broadcasting 
strategies by utilizing pre-existing travel information for 
semi-mobile 
vehicles. 
Specifically, every 
participating 
vehicle is aware of the route and schedule of semi-mobile 
nodes in the road network; this is used in the manner 
described below to disseminate a message to a single or 
several recipients. Initial route information of semi-mobile 
vehicles could be downloaded each day from the vehicle 
owner‚Äôs smartphone or through some other means. 
Overall, TMDA aims to take advantage of the arbitrary, 
but presumably law abiding, route patterns of mobile nodes 
(cars) and exploits the benefits of controllable, scheduled, 
and predictable bus-nodes; it does not only use the simple 
broadcasting behaviours of cars, but also makes use of the 
higher processing power  of bus-nodes to persistently store 
and forward messages. As well as handling local message 
delivery, TMDA allows for the possibility of Internet access 
through the static nodes infrastructure with road sign units 
acting as gateways. 
A. Algorithm Description 
TMDA is a receiver-oriented broadcasting protocol, 
meaning 
that 
receivers 
are 
solely 
responsible 
for 
determining re-broadcasting behaviour. The process can be 
distinguished in four sequences, namely (1) redundancy 
check; (2) position check; (3) distance check and (4) delay 
assignment. Algorithm I shows the pseudo-code of TMDA 
operations when a message reaches a receiver. 
When a message is received by a receiver R but R is the 
originator S for this packet, then a broadcasting loop occurs 
(lines 2-3 in Algorithm I), so, in this case, R needs to 
discard the message. Each message has a unique message id 
msg_id. When a message reaches any receiver R, the msg_id 
is recorded into a broadcast table brd_table that every 
receiver R maintains. If the msg_id is found in brd_table, 
the redundant packet is directly discarded (lines 5-6); 
otherwise, R continues processing the message (lines 8 to 
19). 
ALGORITHM I. 
PSEUDO-CODE OF TMDA IN MESSAGE RECEIVING 
 
 
 
In this VANET configuration, nodes are assumed to be 
equipped with GPS enabled devices. The location 
information derived from GPS allows the node to discover 
whether it is located in a special geographic location termed 
the I-Route. The term I-Route refers to predetermined routes 
on the map which are distinguished from regular road 
segments in that they are bus lanes where, normally, only 
buses travel, i.e., bus movement there is independent from 
normal traffic flow. If R is on an I-Route or it is a static node 
(e.g., bus stop), then R forwards the message to be 
propagated at time T1 after a waiting delay WD1. Another 
waiting delay WD2 is defined with some value, which is 
inversely proportional to the distance between S and R. That 
is, the farthest R forwards the message first (because the 
calculated added delay will be smaller compared to that of 
other Rs). On the other hand, if R is not on the I-Route but 
the last-hop S is, then R discards the message so that 
redundant messages can be limited to a certain degree. With 
this method we attempt to guarantee that transmissions on an 
I-Route have higher priority to others. If the last-hop S is a 
non I-Route node, then R reads the message and knows that 
the position of last-hop sender (Ps) is not on the I-Route; it 
then compares the direction of the last sender (Ds) and itself 
(Dr). When they move towards the same direction, then the 
message is forwarded at T2 after adding a delay of WD2. WD2 
is always greater than WD1 which in turn means that the 
resulting T2 is greater than T1. If the nodes move in opposite 
directions no propagating transmission takes place.

B. Main Mechanisms 
1) I-Route: In TMDA, I-Route is a novel concept of 
assigning special importance to some linked road segments. 
The term implies a set of special routes considered in the 
message delivery algorithm that are used to determine the 
next operation of nodes. If a message reaches an I-Route 
receiver, the receiver forwards the message quickly using 
the pre-configured directions of the I-Route; otherwise, they 
follow the regular broadcasting strategy outlined in the 
algorithm. I-Routes are meant to represent locations where 
nodes will often be present and traffic will be dense. I-
Routes also exist in sparse traffic places where there is a 
greater chance that a bus will be present compared to other 
parts of the network. In any case, I-Routes are predefined 
and they exist to attempt a best effort at finding an 
intermediate  to propagate the message to its destination. 
2) Farthest Node First Send: The final forwarding 
behaviour is defined by the Farthest Node First Send 
(FNFS) paradigm. This can be defined as follows; when a 
sender broadcast a message to all neighbours, the farthest 
one within the transmission range will retransmit the 
message before the others. This is represented by a 
probability value, as defined in (1):  
 
ùëÉùëëùëñùë† =
ùëë<ùë†,ùëü>
ùëëùëöùëéùë•                                 (1) 
where ùëÉùëëùëñùë† is a probability of distance; ùëë<ùë†,ùëü>   represents a 
distance between last-hop sender and current receiver, as 
shown in (2); ùëëùëöùëéùë•  is a maximum value of transmission 
range, e.g., 150 meters - this value depends on the signal 
propagation configuration. 
 
ùëë<ùë†,ùëü> = ‡∂•‚àÜùë•2 + ‚àÜùë¶2                        (2) 
where ‚àÜùë• and ‚àÜùë¶ is the difference of the ùë• and ùë¶ coordinates 
of the last sender and current receiver. 
The above equations indicate that, if a receiver is 
positioned closer to the boundary of its last-hop sender, a 
larger ùëÉùëëùëñùë† is obtained, which contributes to a faster 
rebroadcast. In general, FNFS limits data collisions 
somewhat by reducing the number of transmissions along a 
transmission path. 
3) Direction vector: The direction vector of the nodes is 
considered when both the sender and the receiver are not on 
any I-Routes. This is because nodes in such case are prone 
to broadcasting collision and congestion, and taking the 
direction of traffic into account can possibly reduce packet 
collisions. However, as described in Algorithm I the 
direction vector is not considered when the receiver is an I-
Route node (a node located on an I-Route). The I-Route 
scheme includes a suppression mechanism to reduce the 
number of broadcast collisions - additional utilization of the 
direction vector may limit the quantity of forwarding 
candidates, resulting in lowering message reachability.  
Thus, the direction-based strategy is not essential for I-
Route nodes.  In (3), the direction vector  is applied as: 
 
ùëÉùëëùëêùë° =
ùúã‚àíùëÜùëÖ¬∞
ùúã
                                   (3) 
where ùëÉùëëùëêùë°  is termed a direction based probability; ùëÜùëÖ¬∞ 
represents the difference of direction vector of sender and 
receiver in degrees; ùúã is equal to 180¬∞. In TMDA, when the 
angular distance between sender and receiver is less than 
180¬∞, we consider these two nodes to move in the same 
direction, i.e., ùê∑ùëü == ùê∑ùë†. 
4) Waiting Delay: In TMDA, the waiting delay ùëäùê∑ is 
the most influential parameter used to control the time of 
forwarding. In generating a delay ùëäùê∑ , the position and 
direction of senders and receivers as well as the distance 
between last hop and current receiver are the main factors. 
Forwarding with a ùëäùê∑  strategy somewhat addresses the 
problem of broadcast storms. As mentioned before, VANET 
nodes are assumed to be equipped with GPS devices so they 
can detect their own positions and directions in a timely 
fashion and could place that information in the forwarded 
packets. So, when a receiver R receives the message, it is 
possible to deduce the distance between it and the sender (or 
last hop node). In TMDA, ùëäùê∑ is calculated via (4) which 
adapts it for different node conditions:  
ùëáùë§ùëë = ·âä
(1 ‚àí ùëÉùëëùëñùë†) √ó ùëá‚Ñéùëúùëù                         ùëÖùêºùëÖ = 1
(1 ‚àí ùëÉùëëùëñùë†) √ó 2ùëá‚Ñéùëúùëù       ùëÖùêºùëÖ = 0, ùëÜùêºùëÖ = 0      (4) 
where ùëáùë§ùëë is a waiting delay; ùëáùëëùëñùë† is an minimum interval 
time of one-hop transmission. 
According to the above equations, the waiting delay 
varies due to the position and direction of senders and 
receivers. The waiting delay is smaller when the receiver is 
an I-Route node than when both sender and receiver are 
non-I-Route 
nodes. 
In 
the 
latter 
condition, 
only 
communicating pairs facing the same directions have a 
chance to forward the message after some waiting delay. 
The predominant reason for this is to assign nodes different 
waiting delays before transmission, aiming to avoid or 
reduce the negative effects caused by simultaneous 
broadcasts. 
V. 
SIMULATION SETUP 
To evaluate the proposed TMDA broadcasting protocols, 
we employ simulation and in particular use the NS-2 v.2.35 
to create VANET network model for different scenarios. 
Further, we use SUMO to simulate real traffic flows in 
Nottingham (UK) city centre. Figure 2 depicts an overview 
of the simulation structure.  
The NS-2 modules in the simulation structure consist of 
mobility information and broadcasting protocols. The raw

A. Simulation Scenario 
In this study, the simulated area is chosen to be the city 
centre of Nottingham as shown on the map in Figure 3. 
Compared with T-shaped patterns [31] and #-shaped patterns 
[1] reported in our previous papers, this scenario contains 
more realistic elements such as road distributions, vehicle 
movements and the layout of bus lanes. Important elements 
in the simulation scenario are described as follows. 
1) Nottingham City Centre: This is a medium scale 
traffic area consisting of intersections, roads in various 
shapes, buildings and so on. In this scenario, we need to find 
whether I-Routes provide efficient decisions for message 
delivery; whether different types of nodes can cooperate to 
provide high reachability under various network densities 
;and whether broadcast storms can be alleviated effectively. 
2) I-Route: This is a term used for a set of special routes 
in a target system. In I-Routes, the message transmission 
mechanism can process rebroadcasts based on their 
priorities and improve communication performance. In this 
simulation, we take advantage of buses in the city traffic by 
adopting bus lanes to shape the I-Routes; this is shown as 
red lines in Figure 3. 
3) Network density: It represents the number of nodes in 
the network. In reality, the traffic density in an area can vary 
at different times and different days. Therefore, we consider 
simulation results for scenarios containing a number of 
mobile nodes, ranging from 50 to 200. We define terms 
‚Äòvery low density‚Äô, ‚Äòlow density‚Äô, ‚Äòmedium density‚Äô, and 
‚Äòhigh density‚Äô to represent networks with 50, 100, 150 and 
200 nodes respectively. Density examples are shown in 
Figure 4.

senders, the message expiry and current time. The size of 
message can vary for different communication purposes. In 
this paper, we observe message sizes from a minimum of 
128 bytes to a maximum of 1024 bytes. We assume that 
only one message is transmitted per observation time. 
VI. 
SIMULATION SETUP 
In order to assess communication performance of 
TMDA by comparing it to conventional flooding protocol 
methods, we first introduce the performance metrics 
considered as follows, before presenting and discussing the 
simulation results. 
A. Network Communication Performance Metrics 
1) End-to-End delay (E2Ed): This metric refers to the 
time needed for a message from an originator to be received 
at the intended destination over the network, as in (5) and 
(6). E2Ed represents a capability of the network 
communication from a source to its possible destinations via 
one-hop or multi-hop transmissions. 
‚àÜùëá = ùëáùëí ‚àí ùëá0                              (5) 
ùëáùëí2ùëíùëë = ùëáùëäùê∑ + ‚àÜùëá                          (6) 
where  ùëáùëí  and  ùëá0 stand for the time that the ultimate 
destination receives a packet and the first transmission time 
respectively. 
2) Network Reachability (NRch): This parameter 
represents a ratio of network nodes receiving a message as 
in (7). In a broadcast storm, the NRch theoretically 
decreases due to more packet collisions or when link 
disconnections occur.  
ùëÖùëÅùëÖùëê‚Ñé = ·âÄ
ùëÅùëüùëíùëêùë£
ùëÅ ·âÅ √ó  100%                  (7) 
where ùëÅùëüùëíùëêùë£ is the number of reached nodes and N is the 
total number of network nodes, i.e., vehicles and bus stops in 
this study. 
3) Invoked Broadcast (IVKBrd): This metric measures 
the number of invoked broadcasts in the whole network. 
The particular goal of the metric is to observe how 
effectively the protocol can control the forwarding process. 
B. Compared Protocols 
1) TMDA: The proposed traffic message delivery 
algorithm in this study delivers messages using the concept 
of pre-configured routes (I-Routes) in the city scenarios. On 
the basis of general broadcasting methods, TMDA reduces 
broadcast storms via a selective forwarding mechanism, 
coupled with geographic information such as positions and 
directions. 
2) Flooding: Flooding is the simplest broadcasting 
approach used in VANETs for data disseminations. This has 
been reviewed and further discussed in Section 2. Although 
there are obvious problems caused from the broadcast 
storm, flooding is a protocol with very high reachability in a 
particular range of networks. By comparing with this 
broadcasting protocol, we can clearly identify whether 
TMDA addresses broadcast storm and how effectively it 
does so.  
Table II shows the anticipated features of TMDA, being 
given in advance, and these advantages and disadvantages 
are investigated through simulation results in the following 
sections.

C. Results Evaluation and Analysis 
This section compares the communication performance 
under the TMDA and flooding protocols with respect to 
E2Ed, NRch and IVKBrd. In this paper, the in-depth 
evaluation and analysis is presented in two parts: the effect 
of networks density and the effect of message size. 
 
1) Effective of network density 
 Network density, as introduced earlier, represents the 
number of nodes in the network. In our target VANET 
scenario, both mobile vehicles and static bus stops are 
involved. In C2C communications, a dense network usually 
maintains good connectivity at the cost of serious broadcast 
storms. Therefore, our first investigation point on how to 
overcome heavy packet collisions and transmission 
congestions, which is closely related to the reachability 
performance metric. We compare the reachability of TDMA 
with the high reachability of flooding protocol to identify 
whether TMDA can exhibit an acceptable message delivery 
ratio. 
A number of studies [2], [35], [36] have attempted to use 
infrastructures in C2I technology to reduce the problem of 
large disconnections and consequently lower reachability in 
sparse networks such as C2C. However, if we consider 
resource consumption and costs the C2C approach is more 
effective. At this stage, we are using TMDA to improve 
C2C communication performance without any connected 
infrastructure node. TMDA‚Äôs capability to maintain C2C 
message delivery in both dense and sparsely connected

communication environments is investigated. This can 
become the basis for C2C and C2I communications in a 
more advanced TMDA in future work.  
In Figure 5, TMDA‚Äôs network reachability shows an 
upward trend of 0.35 to 0.5 when the number of nodes 
increases and then shows a significant decrease to 
approximately 0.15 when the network density exceeds 200 
nodes. On the other hand, flooding protocol shows a slight 
network reachability fluctuation (0.4 to 0.32 to 0.48) when 
the number of nodes is less than 200. Flooding shows a 
significant decrease for network reachability similar to 
TMDA for a denser network (over 200 nodes). For fixed size 
of the messages, TMDA leads to around 5% to 20% higher 
reachability than flooding as the network becomes denser, 
except in the case where 128-byte messages are delivered in 
the 100-node network. 
The reduction of rebroadcasts is a credible reason for 
TMDA‚Äôs higher reachability. In Figure 6, TMDA shows a 
lower number of invoked broadcasts compared to the 
flooding protocol as the number of nodes in the network 
increases. For a fixed message size of 128 bytes, the IVKBrd 
is approximately 22, 30, 70 and 35 for TMDA and 58, 70, 
115, and 98 for flooding, as network density increases. The 
range of difference in performance between the two 
protocols varies from about 30% to 60%. This outcome 
suggests that the concept of I-Route priority forwarding has 
reduced the number of redundant packets and thus alleviated 
broadcast storm. 
The reachability results exhibit an unexpected trend when 
the size of the network increases from 200 nodes to 250 
nodes. In most cases, TMDA controls the forwarding process 
adequately so we expected that the NRch in 250-node 
network should be higher than that in smaller networks. This 
is in contrast with the results for the 250 node case. 
Similarly, the flooding protocol results suffer from this 
descent. Here, we notice that the mobility model of 250-node 
network includes a large number of vehicles with short trips. 
In other words, many vehicles can leave the simulation

region during simulation time. In this case, according to 
equation (7), the ùëÅùëüùëíùëêùë£  presents significant small value 
against the N. However, IVKBrd and EDT are not affected 
by this. This observations concludes our discussion of 
network reliability for TMDA compared to the flooding 
protocol. Now, we focus on the efficiency of message 
delivery.  
In Figure 7, for both protocols the E2Ed metric generally 
increases as the number of nodes increases. Intuitively, if 
two protocols lead to similar or even the same level of 
message reachability, then the one with smaller E2Ed 
achieves more efficient transmissions. Results presented in 
Figures 5 and 7 show that TMDA can outperform flooding 
protocol with better NRch and E2Ed.  
The best case for communication performance takes 
place in the 200-node network case where NRch is around 
0.5 for TMDA and 0.42 for the flooding protocol when the 
message size is fixed to 128 bytes; in this case, E2Ed is 17ms 
and 27ms respectively. The differences between the two 
protocols vary in other cases. We can summarize that the 
schemes such as prior forwarding on I-Routes and waiting 
delay in TMDA work as anticipated in Table II. These 
schemes provide new optimisations addressing packet 
collisions caused by simultaneous forwarding. 
Despite the fact that TMDA outperforms flooding for 
E2Ed, NRch and IVKBrd metrics, there is need and scope 
for further improvements addressing disconnections. In a 
sparse network (e.g., 100 nodes), if we were to observe high 
reachability, that would indicate that the network has an 
effective 
mechanism 
for 
addressing 
intermittent 
disconnections. In this case, TMDA shows rather better 
outcomes than the flooding protocol. However, it can be 
noticed that the value is still low over a C2C communication 
network ‚Äì at around 0.35 regardless of the message size. We 
aim to address this in a future proposed improvement for 
TMDA. 
2) Effect of message size 
A critical factor effecting communication is not just the 
number of transmissions, but also the volume of data 
contained per message. To investigate the effect of the 
latter, in this paper, we set observed message sizes as 128

bytes, 256 bytes, 512 bytes and (at maximum) 1024 bytes. 
The effect of message size is represented in Figure 8 for 
E2Ed , Figure 9 for  NRch  and Figure 10 for IVKBrd.  
There is an obvious impact on E2Ed as shown in Figure 
8. Generally, for both protocols, E2Ed increases as the 
message size increases. This can be justified by the fact that 
the larger packets require longer time to be received by 
neighbouring nodes for a limited channel capacity. However, 
we consider more notable the fact that the E2Ed of TMDA is 
considerably less than that of flooding and the speed of 
growth under TMDA is much smaller (no more than 30ms) 
than that of flooding (up to approx. 75ms). The differences 
can be approximately 4ms to 60ms for very low density 
network, 5ms to 40ms for low density network, 11ms to 
60ms for medium density network, and 15ms to 60ms for 
high density network. As shown above, TMDA outperforms 
flooding in terms of transmission delays and, in fact, the 
observed delays recorded are well acceptable for several 
VANET traffic applications. It then becomes of interest to 
examine whether packet size increase has an unacceptable 
deteriorating effect on reachability or observed end-to-end 
delay. In Figure 9, it can be seen that NRch for TMDA is not 
significantly affected by the increase in packet size at a given 
network density. Further, measurements of NRch in flooding 
show some notable decrease. This trend becomes less 
prominent when the network density increases to 250 nodes. 
As evinced in Figure 9, the best NRch performance noted in 
flooding is when the message size is 128 bytes and the 
number of nodes over the network is 100, i.e., the network is 
sparse. With regard to the number of IVKBrd shown in 
Figure 10, the impact of message size is not too significant as 
is the case with TMDA. 
According to the above presented results, C2C 
communications in our chosen city scenario can only be 
reasonably achieved using the TMDA method when 
considering realistic packet sizes, such as 512-1024 bytes; 
flooding only exhibits reasonable performance at small 
packet sizes (128bytes) and in sparse networks. Overall, 
TMDA is a competent performer able to broadcast messages 
within acceptable delay and reachability margins, suitable for 
typical ITS applications. 
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper presented a new broadcast based Traffic 
Message Delivery Algorithm (TMDA) for VANETs and 
compared its communication performance to popular 
broadcast-based protocols in scenarios modelling road traffic 
of the centre of the city of Nottingham in the UK. TMDA 
adopts several principles of existing broadcast algorithms, 
such 
as 
delay-based 
and 
position-based 
forwarding 
techniques and, further, incorporates urban traffic route 
information. With respect to the latter, TMDA considers the 
concept of different node types in the VANET, such as cars 
and buses, and exploits the fact that some nodes' routes, 
termed the I-Routes, are predetermined and predictable. In 
TMDA nodes in such I-Routes are given higher transmission 
priorities so that propagation of messages, ultimately, occurs 
in areas where traffic is likely and predictably present. The 
broadcast techniques used in TMDA aim to alleviate the 
impact of the broadcast storms by controlling dissemination 
as opposed to indiscriminately re-transmitting broadcast 
messages. 
    We measured the performance of TMDA against flooding 
broadcast in sparse, medium and heavy traffic densities, 
measuring end-to-end delay, reachability and the number of 
broadcasts in the network with different packet sizes. Our 
results indicate that the end-to-end delay observed is always 
25%-68% less when using TMDA in all traffic density and 
packet size configurations. The difference is in the higher 
range as the packet size used increases (from 128b to 1Kb). 
The same holds true with the number of invoked broadcasts; 
TMDA typically exhibits 30-60% less broadcasts than 
flooding for similar or higher network reachability. The latter 
is only observed to be less than flooding by 10% in a sparse 
network and at a very small packet size; in any other case 
reachability is observed to be higher than flooding by 12-
45%. Overall, we observe that in all interesting use cases, 
i.e., medium packet/message size and across all network 
topology configurations, TMDA outperforms flooding in all 
metrics. 
     In the near future, we aim to examine TMDA 
performance against more modern flooding techniques, in 
particular, 
probabilistic 
and 
counter-based 
message 
dissemination methods because the advanced protocols show 
high capability to control the broadcast storm during 
message propagations. We also aim to consider other road 
topologies from different cities in the UK to extend our case 
study and observe if our results hold in different settings. 
Finally, we will study the offered broadcast load more 
thoroughly by examining TMDA behaviour when the 
number of simultaneous broadcasts increases.
