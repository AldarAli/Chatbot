Abstract—
The
problem
of
quantum
cloning
is
closely
connected to quantum cryptography. While an eavesdropper
on a quantum channel cannot copy perfectly the sent quantum
states, in many cases a cloning machine is known to be the
most powerful eavesdropping strategy with which to counter
quantum cryptographic protocols. In this paper, effective
computational
geometrical
methods
are
used
to
analyze
cloning activity on a quantum channel. A geometric approach
is demonstrated which analyzes the security of the quantum
channel, based on quantum relative entropy and Delaunay
triangulation on the Bloch sphere. In the security analysis, an
approximation algorithm derived from classical computational
geometry is used to determine the smallest enclosing ball of
balls using core-sets. An improved version is presented which
is able to obtain a more effective approximation algorithm in
quantum space, while the performances of the proposed
geometric algorithms are compared.

INTRODUCTION
In the past few years, quantum key distribution schemes
have invited
much study [1]. Quantum theory takes
advantage of quantum mechanical principles such as the
superposition of states and their no-cloning principle,
introduced by Wooters and Zurek [2]. According to the no-
cloning theorem, an unknown quantum state cannot be
copied perfectly. The method of imperfect cloning was first
published by Buzek and Hillery in 1996 [3], while
Mozyrsky and Privman have subsequently analyzed other
possible imperfect quantum copying approaches and their
practical realization [4].
The problem of quantum cloning is closely connected
to quantum cryptography, a cryptographic method based on
the principles of quantum theory. Using current network
technology, interfaces able to manage both quantum and
classical channels simultaneously must be implemented in
order to spread quantum cryptography.
In our fundamentally new security analysis of quantum
cryptography, the fidelity of the eavesdropper’s cloning
machine is derived from Laguerre-type Delaunay diagrams
on the Bloch sphere. Voronoi diagrams are the geometric
dual of ordinary Delaunay diagrams, and their application in
quantum space has been studied by Kato et al. [5].
In
computational geometry, many complex high dimensional
problems can be expressed with graphs and tessellation
diagrams. Using Laguerre diagrams [6][7], the radii of the
smallest enclosing balls of mixed states on the Bloch sphere
can
be
calculated
efficiently,
while
the
level
of
eavesdropping activity can also be measured. The geometric
interpretation of quantum states investigates informational
distances between two different quantum states [8][9]. The
fidelity of the quantum cloning transformation is here
computed
using
a
classical
informational
geometric
algorithm presented by Badoui and Clarkson [10], and the
Laguerre Delaunay triangulation on the Bloch sphere. The
geometric interpretation of the smallest ball problem in
informational space has been investigated previously by
Nielsen and Nock [11].
As classical cryptographic methods used in wired and
wireless security have been found to have vulnerabilities,
new methods based on quantum mechanical principles have
been deployed [12]. Quantum cryptography is an emerging
technology that may offer new forms of security protection.
However, quantum cloning-based attacks against quantum
cryptography protocols will play a crucial role in the future
[13][14][15][16].
Our goal is to identify these imperfect quantum cloning-
based attacks, and find potential and efficient solutions for
their detection in secret quantum communications. Analysis
of the fidelity of the eavesdropper’s cloning machine
indicates how far the eavesdropper preserves the size of the
space of quantum states. In the proposed method, quantum
informational distance plays an important role in the
estimation of this fidelity. Also presented is a fundamentally
new method of deriving quantum relative entropy based on
Delaunay tessellation on the Bloch ball and the computation
of the radius of smallest enclosing quantum informational
ball, to detect eavesdropping activity on the quantum
channel.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, basic
facts
about
computational
geometry
and
quantum
information theory are discussed. In Section III, the basic
properties of quantum cloners are explained, while in
Sections IV and V, the application of the method for the
security analysis of eavesdropping detection on the quantum
channel is shown. In Section VI, the optimized algorithm is
presented, and the performances of the proposed methods
compared. In Section VII, an illustrative example is

provided which presents the main steps of the proposed
quantum informational geometric security analysis. Finally,
in Section VIII a conclusion is drawn from the results.
II.
ATTACKER MODEL AND GEOMETRIC BACKGROUND
The map of the quantum cloner compresses the Bloch
ball as an affine map. This affine map has to be a
completely positive, trace-preserving map which shrinks the
Bloch ball along the x, y and z axes. Quantum informational
theoretical analysis of the eavesdropper’s cloning machine
indicates to what extent the size of the space of quantum
states
is
preserved.
In
the
proposed
model,
due
to
eavesdropper activity the sent pure quantum states become
mixed states. Eve’s output is represented by a 2 2

density
matrix, her operation being a trace-preserving completely
positive (CP) map. Eve’s map is denoted by L , which is
trace-preserving
if
  

 
Tr




L
for
all
density
matrices  , and positive if the eigenvalues of
 
L 
are
non-negative, whenever the eigenvalues of 
are non-
negative. As Eve’s map L has to be CP,
I n L
is thus a
positive map for all n, where
nI
is the identity map on n
n

matrices [15].
A computational geometric method is used to analyze
cloning activity on a quantum channel, using the Bloch ball
representation. The activity of an eavesdropper on a single
qubit in the Bloch sphere representation can be expressed by
an affine map as

state.

Related Work
To analyze the informational geometric impacts of
cloning activity on the quantum channel, the mathematical
results of Aurenhammer and Klein [6], Badoiu and Clarkson
[10], Panigrahy [17], Badoiu et al. [18], Kumar et al. [19],
Kato et al. [5] and Nielsen and Nock [11] are used. The
proposed geometric analysis of this paper is based on the
most important studies of the security analysis of QKD
protocols. Our approach integrates the results of Cerfand
Bourennane [14], D’Ariano and Macchiavello [15], Acín et
al. [16], Kraus et al. [20], Hillery et al. [21], Cerf et al. [22],
D’Ariano and Macchiavello [23], Gisin et al. [24], Gisin and
Popescu [25], Niederberger et al. [26] and Mozyrsky and
Privman [4]. The geometric approach of Kato et al. [5] is
based on the computation of Voronoi diagrams using a
lower envelope technique. However, the current paper
shows that an enhanced version of the method presented by
Nielsen and Nock [11] can be applied in quantum space, and
by the introduction of quantum Delaunay diagrams for
convex hull calculation, a more powerful method can be
achieved.
In our security analysis, the informational theoretical
meaning of quantum cloning activity in the quantum
channel is studied. Alice’s side is modeled by the random

For conditional random variables, the probability of the
random variable X given Y is denoted by 

. Alice
sends a random variable to Bob, who subsequently produces
an output signal with a given probability.
The effects of Eve’s quantum cloner on Bob’s received
quantum
state
are
then
geometrically
analyzed.
The
presence of Eve’s cloner in the quantum channel increases
the uncertainty in X, given Bob’s output of Y. The
informational theoretical noise of Eve’s quantum cloner
increases conditional Shannon entropy

The proposed geometric security analysis focuses on the
cloned mixed quantum state, which is received by Bob. The
type of quantum cloner machine depends on the actual
protocol. For example, in the four-state protocol Eve
chooses the phase-covariant cloner, while in the six-state
protocol she uses the universal quantum cloner (UCM)
machine. Alice’s pure state is denoted by

presence of an eavesdropper on the quantum channel is
measured in a geometric representation.
In a secret
quantum channel,

and

H X Y 
are sought to be

to
maximize the radius

To calculate the radius
*r of the smallest informational ball
of quantum states and the entropies between the cloned
quantum states, von Neumann entropy and quantum relative
entropy are used rather than classical Shannon entropy.
Geometrically, the presence of an eavesdropper causes
detectable mapping to change from a noiseless one-to-one
relationship to a stochastic map. If there is no cloning
activity on the channel, then


H X Y  0
and the radius of
the smallest enclosing quantum informational ball on Bob’s
side will be maximized.

the boundary of the Bloch ball B , while the mixed states
are inside the Bloch ball.

The Smallest Enclosing Quantum-Information Ball

In Figure 6, we compare the smallest quantum informational

that the quantum states

The informational theoretical effect of the eavesdropper’s

enclosing quantum informational ball, denoted by
*r . This

QUANTUM CLONING IN QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHY
The quantum cloning machine does a trace-preserving,

When
apriori
information about the input states is given so that input
quantum states can be particularly characterized, we call it
state-dependent quantum cloning. By the outputs, there are
symmetric and asymmetric cloning machines. A cloning
machine is called symmetric if at the output all the clones
have the same fidelity, and asymmetric if the clones have
different fidelities.
The quantum channel’s error rate is denoted by
attack
DC
,
and the maximal information theoretic fidelity of the
eavesdropper’s cloning machine is denoted by
FEve
. The
parameter
FEve
represents the theoretical upper bound on the
cloning machine’s fidelity. The cloning machine based

A.
Optimal Individual Eavesdropping Strategy for QKD
The phase-covariant cloning machine has a remarkable
application in quantum cryptography, namely its use in
optimal individual eavesdropping strategies in the BB84
protocol [20][22][23]. Using an individual-type cloning-
based attack, Eve applies the same unitary transformation to
each sent quantum state. She does not introduce correlation
among the copies, measuring her state after she clones it [9].
Alice, Bob and Eve immediately measure their respective

quantum states, since the parties have no ability to store
qubits.
The results of their measurements can be described by a
probability distribution


, ,
P A B E . Eve’s quantum state is
denoted by
E
, while the unitary operation, which
describes the interaction between the sent qubit and Eve’s
state, is denoted by L , and thus the whole transformation
can be expressed as [24][26]:

F is the fidelity
parameter, while D is the disturbance. The fidelity F
provides the probability that Bob detected Alice’s bit
correctly using the same basis, while D provides the
probability of an incorrect detection [9].
B.
Different Types of Quantum Cloners
In quantum cryptography the optimal eavesdropping
attack is done by a phase-covariant cloning machine, which
clones the x equator. The importance of equatorial qubits lies
in the fact, that quantum cryptography requires these states,
rather than the states that span the whole Bloch sphere [9].
The transformations were restricted for pure input states
of the form


(34)
where
the
parameter



represents
the
angle
between the Bloch vector and the x-axis. These qubits are
called equatorial qubits, because the z-component of their
Bloch vector is zero. The phase-covariant quantum cloners
[14][15][16] can clone arbitrary equatorial qubits, and they
keep the quality of the copies same for all equatorial qubits.
The reduced density operator of the copies at the output can
be expressed as [9]

COMPUTATION OF QUANTUM CHANNEL SECURITY
In this section the informational geometric model of the
proposed security analysis is defined, fundamentally based
on
the
results
of
Gyongyosi
and
Imre
[1].
In
the
computation
of
the
smallest
enclosing
quantum
informational ball, the results of Kato et al. [5] and Nielsen
and Nock [11] are also used.
In the proposed model, the fidelity of the eavesdropper’s
cloning machine is derived from the quantum informational
theoretical radius
*r
of the smallest enclosing quantum
informational ball and the theoretical upper bound of the
quantum informational radius of the eavesdropper’s cloning
machine, denoted by
*
rEve
.

For a secure quantum channel, the radius

where S is the von Neumann entropy of the corresponding

The values of
rUCM
and

can be computed from
the informational theoretical radii of the smallest enclosing

.
Theorem
For UCM and phase-covariant cloner machines, the

It can be concluded that if

and hence the informational theoretical radius will be

Figure 10. Comparison of smallest enclosing quantum informational ball of
UCM-based and phase-covariant cloners.
Geometrically, the smallest quantum informational ball can
be computed from the intersection of the contours of the
quantum relative entropy ball with the ellipsoid of the secret
channel, the latter being generated by the eavesdropper’s
cloner machine.
A.
Geometrical Calculation of Channel Security
In the Bloch sphere representation, the smallest value of

D   
corresponds to the contour closest to the location
of density matrix.
In Figure 11, the smallest quantum informational ball
with
radius


intersects
the
channel
ellipsoid at the magnitude m of Bloch vector
r . The
Euclidean distance between the origin and center
*c is
denoted by m . Similarly, the Euclidean distance between
the origin and state 
is denoted by m , respectively.
We note, that for a perfect UCM cloner and a perfect
phase-covariant cloner, the center of the channel ellipsoid is
equal to the Bloch sphere origin. In our next example, we
will use an imperfect quantum cloner model, where the
center slightly differs from the Bloch sphere origin.
Figure 11. Intersection of radius of smallest enclosing quantum
informational ball and channel ellipsoid.
In our geometrical iteration algorithm, we would like to
determine the location of vector
r
inside the channel
ellipsoid such that, the largest possible contour value


Dmax

touches the channel ellipsoid surface, and the
remainder of the

contour surface lies entirely outside
the channel ellipsoid. The point on the channel ellipsoid
surface is defined as the set of channel output  . The
vector
r
is defined in the interior of the ellipsoid, as the
convex hull of the channel ellipsoid.
To determine the optimal length of the radius, the
algorithm moves point  . As we move vector
r
from the
optimum position, a larger contour corresponding to the
larger value of the quantum relative entropy D will intersect
the channel ellipsoid surface, thereby


The maximum length radius
r
can be determined by an
iterative algorithm, suing the quantum relative entropy as
distance measure. The computed radius is equal to the
radius of the smallest quantum informational ball, hence the
quantum informational radius can be used to derive the
fidelity of the eavesdropper’s quantum cloner machine.

r
in our geometrical analysis, we choose a start point for
vector

in the interior of the ellipsoid.
In Figure 13(a), we show the initial start point inside
the channel ellipsoid chosen by the algorithm. The vector of
state  is denoted by
r . In the next step, the algorithm
determines the set of points to the vector
r on the ellipsoid
surface most distant from
r , using the quantum relative
entropy as distance measure. In Figure 13(b), the new state
is notated by  .

We choose a random Bloch sphere vector from the

r
towards the surface point vector
r
in the Bloch sphere

In Figure 14(b), we illustrate the quantum informational

Delaunay Triangulation on the Bloch Sphere
The mesh of the Bloch sphere B can be described as a
number of points connected in some way by lines, the points
and the lines of the mesh are referred to as edges and
vertices.
The triangle t is said to be Delaunay, when its
circumcircle is empty. For an empty circumcircle, the circle
passing through the quantum states of a triangle t
T
,
encloses no other vertex of the set S [6][7].

In our algorithm we present an effective solution to seek the

1.
We construct quantum Delaunay triangulation
from Laguerre diagrams on the Bloch ball.
2.
We seek the center of the smallest enclosing ball.
In our procedure, we use Delaunay tessellation, because
it is the fastest tool to seek the center of a smallest enclosing
ball
of points.
By
the
usage
of
quantum
Delaunay
triangulation on the Bloch sphere, the convex hull of the
quantum states, and the radius of the smallest enclosing
quantum informational ball could be determined very
efficiently.

A.
Rate of Converge
We made simulations and numerical analysis on the
performances
of
the
proposed
algorithms.
We
have
compared the core-set algorithm and the improved core-set
algorithm
to
find
the
smallest
enclosing
quantum
information ball. We have analyzed the approximation
algorithms for 30 center updates.
In the simulation work, the quantum information ball is
generated random, and the quantum relative entropy based
approximation used uniformly sampled quantum states. In
our numerical analysis, we have measured the quality of the
approximation with respect to quantum relative entropy. At
first we have simulated the algorithm presented in Section
V, then we analyzed the improved algorithm presented in
Section VI.
The results of our simulation are shown in Figure 22.
The x-axis represents the number of center updates to find
the center of the smallest enclosing quantum informational
ball, the y-axis represents
the quantum informational
distance between the found center c and the optimal center

From the results, it can be seen that each presented
algorithm finds the approximate center c to the optimal
center
*c extremely quickly. The quantum relative entropy-
based approximation algorithms have a very accurate
convergence of c towards
*c , but the improved core-set
algorithm presented in Section VI converges more rapidly
with a smaller number of center updates.
It can be concluded that only a small set of quantum
states are required to compute the center of the quantum
informational ball, with the proposed algorithms providing
very
solid
approximations
of
the
smallest
quantum
informational ball.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper proposes a fundamentally new method of
calculating the security of a quantum channel, based on
Laguerre diagrams and quantum relative entropy. Using a
Delaunay tessellation on the Bloch sphere, the geometric
space can be divided and can be calculated extremely

efficiently,
in
a
reasonable
computational
time.
A
generalization of an effective approximation algorithm of the
smallest enclosing quantum information ball of the set of
quantum states was presented, equipped with quantum
relative entropy as a distance measure. This improved
approximation algorithm was demonstrated to obtain a more
efficient
optimized
geometric
method.
Finally
the
performances of the proposed methods were compared.
In this paper a new algorithm with which to compute the
quantum
informational
theoretical
impacts
of
an
eavesdropper’s cloning machine on the quantum channel was
also
proposed.
In
this
analysis,
the
fidelity
of
the
eavesdropper’s cloning machine is numerically computed by
tessellation on the Bloch sphere. A very effective core-set
algorithm and an optimized core-set method were also
designed.
The
adaptability
of
classical
computational
geometric methods in the quantum space was presented,
while the performance of the basic and improved core-set
algorithms were analyzed and compared. It was shown that
both of the proposed algorithms provide very strong results
concerning the approximation of the smallest quantum
informational ball.
In terms of future work, it is hoped that the method will
be extended to analyze coherent and individual attacks for
quantum cryptography, while an in-depth study on the
geometric impacts of physically allowed quantum cloning
transformations is also intended.
