Abstract—The 
combination 
of 
frequency 
modulated 
continuous wave (FMCW) and SAR (synthetic aperture 
radar) , is one of the most important and dynamic research 
around 
the 
world. 
For 
FMCW 
SAR, 
traditional 
approximation of stop-go is invalid, hence the traditional 
motion compensation method is no longer suitable for 
FMCW SAR. The signal model of FMCW SAR in the 
presence of motion error is derived in the paper, as well as 
the difference introduced by inter-pulse motion errors. Then 
a new motion compensation method is proposed. Simulated 
and experimental FMCW SAR data is generated and the 
well-focused image shows the proposed method is available. 
Keywords-Frequency Module Continuous Wave; Synthetic 
Aperture Radar; Motion Compensation; Line of Sight; 
intra-pulse; inter-pulse. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Being a kind of advanced imaging sensor, SAR has 
been assembled with a variety of platforms, like airplane, 
airship, helicopter, missile, UAV (unmanned airplane 
vehicle), even the satellites. Most of these airborne 
platforms would be disturbed by the air current and are 
going to move on a non-ideal trajectory, accordingly, 
declines the quality of SAR imagery, even leads to a 
failure of imaging.  
Airplane is a popular platform for SAR system, in the 
background of the glorious boom of UAVs, the 
combination of SAR and UAV, leads to a significant 
development for both the SAR sensor and UAVs. For one 
thing, it expands the application of SAR, for another, 
UAVs could have a stronger power of observation. 
However, the limited load of UAV could not satisfy the 
big, heavy and high-power pulsed SARs. Fortunately, the 
technology of FMCW could make the SAR smaller, low 
power and low-weight. It is the reason why FMCW SAR 
has been one of the most important and dynamic research 
in the field of radar around the world [1-5]. 
In FMCW SAR Systems，due to the fact that the 
transmitted wave is continuous and the length is in 
milliseconds, traditional approximation of stop-go in SAR 
theory is no longer valid. The motion during inter-pulse 
could not be ignored and the original method of motion 
compensation is not available either. But the error motion 
could still be separated into two terms: range error along 
the LOS and velocity error along track. Resampling the 
raw 
data 
along 
the 
track 
or 
transmitting 
the 
pseudo-continuous 
wave 
whose 
duty 
cycle 
is 
approximately to 1 then adjusting the PRF online are 
alternative for the elimination of velocity error. Thus the 
processing of eliminating velocity error could be seen as 
the preparation for imaging. However, it becomes 
complicated when dealing with the range error. A new 
method which is available for compensating the range 
error is proposed in this paper. In addition, a laboratorial 
FMCW SAR system is built-up, based on which the 
presented approach could be validated. 
In Section II, the SAR system geometry and signal in 
presence of trajectory deviation is addressed. In Section III, 
difference phenomenon introduced by inter-pulse motion 
error is presented while the related approach is presented 
too. The proposed method is verified with the simulated 
and experimental data in Section IV. Finally, the 
conclusion is pointed out in Section V. 
II. SIGNAL MODEL OF FMCW SAR IN NON-IDEAL CASE 
Let us refer to Fig.1, in which the SAR system 
geometry in the presence of the 3-D motion error is 
presented. The real trajectory is shown as the dotted line, 
while the straight line along X denotes the ideal trajectory. 
O means the origin of the coordinates and   is the 
off-nadir angle.

Unfortunately, the motion error destroys the invariance

The sampled line is suitable for pulsed SAR but 
unavailable for FMCW SAR due to the fact that the 
inter-pulse motion error could not be ignored. 
For FMCW SAR, assuming the period of the

As for the real-time processing of SAR, the approach

pursuit the maximum efficiency. Due to the fact that range 
doppler (RD ) algorithm is effectively and easy to realize, 
an available approach of motion compensation which is 
based on RDA is proposed in this paper, and the flow

the terms of new RCM compensation, and the 
compensation of Doppler factor. The form of first and 
second ordered motion compensation could quote from 
[6][8], the two-step motion compensation method  is 
used widely in data focusing. It’s necessary to point out 
that the Doppler factor is derived from the continuous 
move inter-pulse and be considered as the main difference 
between pulsed SAR and FMCW SAR. 
IV. THE RESULTS OF SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENT 
It is common for airplane to be disturbed by the air 
current, especially, severe and high-frequency jitter would 
made the velocity error obvious and increase the difficulty 
for compensation. Firstly, partial parameters of simulation 
are settled in Table 1. 
Assuming the location error in Y dimension obey a 
sine wave whose amplitude and period are 3m and 5s, 
while the location error in Z dimension obey a cosine 
wave whose amplitude and period are 4m/s and 5s. Then 
the velocity error could be calculated by the difference of 
location error. Both of them are shown in Fig. 4.  
Based on (13) and the parameters in Table 1, we could 
calculate the new RCM introduced by inter-pulse motion 
errors, shown in Fig. 5.

Figure.5.  the new RCMs introduced by inter-pulse motion error 
There are two conclusions can be derived from Fig. 5; 
for one thing, the absolute value of new RCM is about 
0.2m which will has a obvious influence to imagery when 
the range resolution is less than 0.2m. For the other, 
referring to the parameter in Table.1, the difference of new 
RCM from minimum range or maximum range to central 
range are tiny, hence compensating the whole scene with 
(14) is available. 
Fig.6 shows the result of an analysis of simulated 
FMCW SAR data. Fig.6 (a) shows the distribution of 
scatters. Fig.6 (b) shows the motion correction result using 
traditional compensation method, whereas Fig.6 (c) shows 
the motion correction result using the proposed 
compensation method. An array of point targets is used for 
the qualitative analysis, especially for the points located in 
the margin and center of scene. The proposed motion 
compensation is compared to traditional motion correction 
method in the presence of severe motion error. The better 
results performed by proposed method represent the better 
applicability for FMCW SAR.  
From the theoretical analysis and simulated result, it 
has been seen that the proposed method is valid to 
compensate the motion errors when the resolution is very 
high and the motion error is severe. Although when the 
resolution is low and the trajectory is better, new range 
migration derived from (13) is less than half of range 
resolution, the new range migration derived from 
inter-pulse motion error could be ignored. 
The experiment was also carried out with our designed 
FMCW SAR system, in which the SAR system is fixed on 
the roof of a sport utility vehicle (SUV), the LFM 
bandwidth is 600MHz, some corner reflectors were placed

in the scene. With the imaging process chart shown in 
Fig.3, we obtained the results shown in Fig.7. From the 
above to down: (a) the measured motion error calculated 
from the GPS data. (b) the focused image after applying 
the proposed compensation scheme and the schematic 
diagram of corner reflectors.(c) the range and azimuth 
profile. 
From Fig.7, it is obvious that the corner reflector is  
well focused. The amplitude is various because the 
off-nadir angle is approximate to zero so the variance of 
corner reflectors’ placement has a significant influence on 
the radar cross section (RCS). In addition, the integrated 
side lobe rate of azimuth compression is higher than the 
ideal case, since the motion error contains high-frequency 
component which is hard to compensation based on GPS 
data. However, some autofocus approaches, such as PGA 
[9]-[10] and PACE [11] could improve the result of 
compression. 
From the simulated and experimental result shown in 
Fig. 6, Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, it is obvious that the SAR is well 
focused, further, the proposed approach is valid. While 
more high-precise high-resolution large scene airborne 
based FMCW SAR data focusing is ongoing. It is 
confident that the high resolution SAR imagery will have 
a vast application in kinds of fields. Like remote sensing, 
monitor, cartography, disaster estimation, environment 
survey.etc.

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The main difference between pulsed SAR and FMCW 
SAR is the approximation stop-go is invalid and the 
motion during inter-pulse should be considered. Hence the 
traditional motion compensation method which is suitable 
for pulsed SAR will no longer available for FMCW SAR. 
An 
available 
method 
for 
FMCW 
SAR 
motion 
compensation is proposed in this paper. The geometry and 
signal model of FMCW SAR in the presence of 3-D 
motion error is built; the influence introduced by 
inter-pulse motion error is analyzed while the accordingly 
approach is presented too. Simulated FMCW SAR data is 
generated and the proposed method is compared to 
traditional method. Simulation shows the proposed 
method results are much better than those of traditional 
method and the proposed method is particularly available 
for FMCM SAR. Eventually, the proposed approach is 
adopted on a laboratorial FMCW SAR system. 
Well-focused experimental data confirm the effectiveness 
of the presented method.
