Abstract—In this paper, we propose a multirate teletrafﬁc loss
model of a single link that accommodates elastic and adaptive
services whose calls come from a ﬁnite trafﬁc-source population.
This call arrival process is known as a quasi-random process
and is used in trafﬁc modelling when the number of users
who generate trafﬁc is relatively small compared to the sys-
tem capacity. In-service elastic and adaptive calls can tolerate
bandwidth compression by extending their remaining service-
time (elastic calls) or not (adaptive calls). In this loss system,
we study the effect of the bandwidth reservation policy on time
congestion probabilities, call congestion probabilities and link
utilization. The bandwidth reservation policy is considered when
a certain quality of service for each service-class is required and
is essential to be guaranteed. The proposed model does not have
a product form solution, and therefore we propose approximate
but recursive formulas for the efﬁcient calculation of the above
mentioned performance measures. The accuracy and consistency
of the proposed model are veriﬁed by simulation and is found to
be quite satisfactory. Finally, we generalize the proposed model
to include calls from both ﬁnite and inﬁnite number of trafﬁc
sources.

INTRODUCTION
I
N contemporary communication networks, the trafﬁc en-
vironment is composed mostly of multirate services of
elastic and adaptive trafﬁc. The co-existence of this type of
services makes the call-level performance analysis and evalu-
ation of modern telecom networks much more complicated and
challenging. It is therefore essential to have proper multirate
teletrafﬁc loss models, for the call-level QoS assessment of
such networks [1]. Based on analytical tools, telecom engineers
can include various services in the network according to their
offered trafﬁc-load, decide on proper network dimensioning
and avoid link over-dimensioning [2].
In [1], we present a multirate loss model for elastic and
adaptive services with ﬁnite trafﬁc-source population. By the
term elastic trafﬁc (e.g., ﬁle transfer), we refer to in-service
calls that have the ability to compress their bandwidth, while
simultaneously expanding their service time. On the other
hand, adaptive trafﬁc refers to in-service calls that tolerate
bandwidth compression, but their service time does not alter
(e.g., adaptive video) [3]. In both cases, we assume that band-
width compression is permitted down to a minimum value. As
far as the consideration of trafﬁc sources with ﬁnite population
is concerned, it results in a quasi-random call arrival process,
which is, in many cases, a more realistic consideration than a
random (Poisson) process (where inﬁnite population of trafﬁc
sources is assumed). As the Markov chain analysis shows, the
existence of the bandwidth compression/expansion mechanism
destroys the Markov chain reversibility, and because of this,
the model has no product form solution. Therefore, we propose
approximate but recursive formulas for the efﬁcient calculation
of the call-level performance metrics, such as time and call
congestion probabilities and link utilization. The consistency
and the accuracy of the model are veriﬁed through simulation
and found to be quite satisfactory.
In this paper, we extend [1], by studying the effect of the
Bandwidth Reservation (BR) policy on time and call conges-
tion probabilities, as well as on link utilization. The BR policy
can achieve the equalization of call blocking probabilities
among calls of different service-classes, or guarantee a certain
QoS for each service-class. For instance, to equalize blocking
probabilities between different service-classes, the BR policy
ensures greater link bandwidth to high speed service-classes.
Applications of the BR policy in wired (e.g., [4]-[6]), wireless
(e.g., [7]-[9]) and optical networks (e.g., [10], [11]) show
the policy’s signiﬁcant role in teletrafﬁc engineering. As an
example, in wireless networks the BR policy can ensure certain
QoS for handoff trafﬁc, while, it is worth mentioning that in
optical networks, the term “bandwidth reservation” refers to
“wavelength reservation” [10].
The Markov chain analysis is extensively used in the call-
level analysis of communication networks. Contrary to the
analysis of the complete sharing policy where the stationary
probabilities have a product form solution, the BR policy
cannot be analysed by the use of a product form solution. This
is because one-way transitions appear in the state space of the
Markov chain, which destroy the reversibility of the Markov
chain [12]. Therefore, the reason why the proposed model in
this paper does not have a product form solution is twofold:

not only the existence of the bandwidth compression/expansion
mechanism but also the existence of the BR policy. Because
of the absence of a product form solution we resort to an
approximate solution, and propose a recursive formula for
the efﬁcient calculation of the link occupancy distribution.
This formula simpliﬁes the determination of all performance
measures. We have evaluated the accuracy and consistency of
the proposed model through simulation, and found them to be
quite satisfactory. Herein, we name the model of [1], Extended
Finite - Erlang Multirate Loss Model (EF-EMLM), because it
is based on the classical EMLM (also known as Kaufman-
Roberts model – more details are referred to the next Section)
[13], [14]. Hence, the proposed new model is named EF-
EMLM/BR. Furthermore, we generalize the EF-EMLM/BR to
include calls from both ﬁnite and inﬁnite number of trafﬁc
sources.
Potential applications of the proposed new model are mostly
in the area of cellular networks, where calls come from ﬁnite
sources and their bandwidth can be compressed (e.g., [15]–
[20]). More precisely, a Wideband Code Division Multiple
Access (W-CDMA) network, like Universal Mobile Telecom-
munications System (UMTS), supports not only streaming
trafﬁc of voice service, but also data trafﬁc of an elastic
or adaptive type (transferring messages or images) that can
tolerate bandwidth compression. A single base station of this
network can be modelled as a multirate loss system. The
number of users in a cell is rather realistic to be considered
ﬁnite, due to the limited coverage of a cell; this is even more
realistic in the case of microcells. The BR policy can be
applied to the system in order to reserve a part of the cell
resources especially for handoff incoming trafﬁc, which has to
be serviced with a higher priority than the trafﬁc originated
inside the cell.
This paper is organised as follows: Section II contains
related work. In Section III, we: a) present the basic assump-
tions and the call admission control, b) show the recursive
formula for the link occupancy distribution and c) provide
formulas for the various performance measures of the EF-
EMLM. In Section IV, we: a) consider the application of the
BR policy in the EF-EMLM, b) show the recursive formula
for the link occupancy distribution, c) show how the EF-
EMLM is related to other multirate loss models and d) provide
formulas for the calculation of various performance measures
of the EF-EMLM/BR. In Section V, we provide numerical
results whereby the new model is compared to existing models
and evaluated through simulation results. In Section VI, we
generalize the proposed model to include calls from both ﬁnite
and inﬁnite number of sources. We conclude in Section VII.
In Appendix A, we prove the recursive formula for the link
occupancy distribution. Finally, we tabulate (as Appendix B)
all the symbols used in this paper.

RELATED WORK
Multirate teletrafﬁc loss models of a single link that accom-
modates elastic and adaptive calls have been proposed in [3],
[21]-[24]. In [3], the call arrival process is Poisson. A new call
is accepted in the link with its peak bandwidth requirement
when the occupied link bandwidth together with the peak
bandwidth of that call does not exceed the capacity of the link.
Otherwise, the new call is accepted in the link by compressing
its peak-bandwidth, as well as the bandwidth of all in-service
calls (of all service-classes). Call blocking occurs when the
minimum bandwidth requirement of a call (achieved after the
maximum bandwidth compression) is higher than the link’s
available bandwidth. The minimum bandwidth requirement of
a call is a proportion of its peak-bandwidth; this proportion
is common to all service-classes. When an in-service call
departs from the system, then the remaining in-service calls,
whose bandwidth has been compressed, expand their band-
width in proportion to their peak-bandwidth requirement. The
Markov chain analysis of this model shows that the bandwidth
compression/expansion mechanism destroys the Markov chain
reversibility, and therefore the model has no product form
solution. However, according to [3], a reversible Markov chain
that describes the model in an approximate way does exist,
and leads to a recursive formula for the determination of
link occupancy distribution and, consequently, call blocking
probabilities and link utilization. This formula resembles the
classical Kaufman-Roberts formula used in the EMLM, where
Poisson arriving calls of different service-classes have ﬁxed
bandwidth requirements (stream trafﬁc), and compete for the
available link bandwidth under the complete sharing policy
[13], [14]; thus, we name the model of [3], Extended EMLM
(E-EMLM). In [21], the E-EMLM is extended to include
retrials, i.e., blocked calls may retry one or more times to
be serviced with reduced bandwidth. In [22], new calls, upon
their arrival, may reduce their bandwidth according to the
occupied link bandwidth. In [23], [24], the E-EMLM is further
extended to include the Batched Poisson call arrival process,
which is used to approximate arrival processes that are more
“peaked”and “bursty” than the Poisson process.
In [1], we consider an extension of the E-EMLM, the EF-
EMLM, whereby calls arrive in the link according to a quasi-
random process [25]. The latter is smoother than the Poisson
process and is used in trafﬁc modelling when the number of
users (sources) who generate trafﬁc is ﬁnite. As an application
example of the quasi-random process one may think of a
microcell in a cellular network, where the number of users
roaming in the cell’s vicinity can be considered ﬁnite [19],
[26]. Recently, a multirate loss model that includes Poisson
calls of stream, elastic and adaptive trafﬁc has been proposed
in [20]; however, the presence of stream trafﬁc prohibits the
recursive calculation of link occupancy distribution or the other
call-level performance measures.
III.
THE EXTENDED FINITE EMLM (EF-EMLM)
In the following subsections, we present basic assumptions
for call admission control, the recursive calculation of the link
occupancy distribution and the consequent calculation of the
call-level performance measures of the EF-EMLM, under the
complete sharing policy (without QoS guarantee).
A. Notation, basic assumptions and call admission
We study a link of capacity C bandwidth units that ac-
commodates elastic and adaptive calls of K different service-

classes. Let Ke and Ka be the set of elastic and adaptive
service-classes (Ke +Ka = K), respectively. Calls of service-
class k (k = 1, . . . , K) come from a ﬁnite source popu-
lation Nk and request bk bandwidth units (peak-bandwidth
requirement). The mean arrival rate of service-class k idle
sources is λk = (Nk − nk)vk where nk is the number of
in-service calls and vk is the arrival rate per idle source.
This call arrival process is a quasi-random process [25]. If
Nk → ∞ for k = 1, . . . , K and the total offered trafﬁc-load
remains constant, then a Poisson process arises. To introduce
bandwidth compression, the occupied link bandwidth j may
virtually exceed C up to T bandwidth units.
The description of call admission is based on a new service-
class k call that arrives in the system when the occupied link
bandwidth is j bandwidth units. Then:
i) If j + bk ≤ C, the call is accepted in the system with bk
bandwidth units for an exponentially distributed service time
with mean µ−1
k .
ii) If j + bk > T, the call is blocked and lost.
iii) If T ≥ j + bk > C, the call is accepted in the system
by compressing its peak-bandwidth requirement, as well as
the assigned bandwidth of all in-service calls (of all service-
classes). After compression has taken place, all calls share
the C bandwidth units in proportion to their peak-bandwidth
requirement, while the link operates at its full capacity C. This
is the processor sharing discipline [27], [28].
When T ≥ j + bk > C, the compressed bandwidth bcomp
k
of the newly accepted service-class k call, is calculated by:
bcomp
k
= rbk = C
j
′ bk
(1)
where r = C
j′ denotes the compression factor and j
′ = j + bk.
Since j = PK
k=1 nkbk = nb, n = (n1, n2,..., nK) and
b = (b1, b2, . . . , bK), the values of r are expressed by r ≡
r(n) =
C
nb+bk . The bandwidth of all in-service calls is also
compressed by the same factor r(n) and becomes equal to
bcomp
i
= C
j′ ·bi for i = 1, . . . , K. After bandwidth compression,
the occupied link bandwidth is j = C. All adaptive calls do
not alter their service time. On the other hand, all elastic calls
increase their service time so that the product service time by
bandwidth remains constant. The minimum bandwidth that a
call of service-class k (k = 1, . . . , K) tolerates, is:
bcomp
k,min = rminbk = C
T bk
(2)
where rmin = C
T is the minimum proportion of the required
peak-bandwidth and is common to all calls.
When an in-service call of service-class k, with bandwidth
bcomp
k
, departs from the system, then the remaining in-service
calls of each service-class i (i = 1, . . . , K), expand their
bandwidth to bexpan
i
, in proportion to their peak-bandwidth
bi:

To
illustrate
the
previous
bandwidth
compression
mechanism consider the following simple example. Let
C = 3 bandwidth units, T = 5 bandwidth units, K = 2
service-classes, b1 = 1 bandwidth unit, b2 = 2 bandwidth
units, N1
= N2
= 10 sources, v1
= v2
= 0.1 and
µ−1

2
= 1 time unit. The ﬁrst service-class is elastic
while the second service-class is adaptive. The permissible
states n = (n1, n2) of the system are 12; they are presented
in Table I together with the occupied link bandwidth,
j = n1b1 + n2b2, before and after compression has been
applied. Note that compression is applied if T ≥ j > C
(bold values of the 3rd column of Table I). After compression
has been applied, we have that j = C (bold values of the
4th column of Table I). For example, assume that a new
2nd service-class call arrives while the system is in state
(n1, n2) = (1, 1) and j = C = 3 bandwidth units. The new
call is accepted in the system, since j
′ = j + b2 = T = 5
bandwidth units, after bandwidth compression has been
applied to all calls (new and in-service calls). The new state
of the system is now (n1, n2) = (1, 2). In this state, and
based on (2), calls of the 1st and 2nd service-class compress
their bandwidth to the following values:
bcomp
1,min = rminb1 = 3
5b1 = 0.6 , bcomp
2,min = rminb2 = 3
5b2 = 1.2
so that j = n1bcomp
1,min + n2bcomp
2,min = 0.6 + 2.4 = 3 = C. The
value of µ−1
1
becomes
µ−1
1
rmin so that b1µ−1
1
remains constant,
while the value of µ−1
2
does not alter.
Consider now that the system is in state (n1, n2) = (1, 2)
and a 2nd service-class call departs from the system. Then, its
assigned bandwidth bcomp
2,min = 1.2 is shared to the remaining
calls in proportion to their peak-bandwidth requirement. Thus,
in the new state (n1, n2) = (1, 1) the 1st service-class call
expands its bandwidth to b1 = 1 bandwidth unit and the 2nd
service-class call to b2 = 2 bandwidth units. Thus, j = n1b1 +
n2b2 = C = 3 bandwidth units. Furthermore, the service time
of elastic calls only is decreased to µ−1
1
= 1 time unit.
In Fig. 1, we present the state transition diagram of this
example. If we consider the four adjacent states (n1, n2) :
(2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1) and (3, 0) and apply the Kolmogorov’ s
criterion (ﬂow clockwise = ﬂow counter-clockwise) [27], it
is obvious that this criterion does not hold. This means that
the Markov chain is not reversible. Generally speaking, the
bandwidth compression mechanism destroys reversibility in
the proposed model and therefore no PFS exists. To circum-
vent this problem, we use, in the following subsection, state
dependent multipliers per service-class k, φk(n), which have
a similar role with r(n) and lead to a reversible Markov chain.
B. Determination of link occupancy distribution
Let Ω be the system’s state space Ω = {n : 0 ≤
nb ≤ T}. The fact that the system cannot be described by
a reversible Markov chain means that local balance does not
exist between adjacent states of Ω. Therefore, the steady-
state distribution P(n) does not have a product form so-
lution. To derive an approximate but recursive formula for

To derive (7), we keep the product service time by bandwidth

four adjacent states (n1, n2) : (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1) and (3, 0),
the Kolmogorov’ s criterion (ﬂow clockwise = ﬂow counter-

In order to prove a recursive formula for the calculation of
G(j)’s, we consider two cases: i) states where 0 ≤ j ≤ C
(bandwidth compression does not occur) and ii) states where
C < j ≤ T (bandwidth compression occurs).
When 0 ≤ j ≤ C, then φk(n) = 1 and based on (4) and
(5), it is proved that [29]:

otherwise
(11)
where: αk =
vk
µk is the offered trafﬁc-load (in erl) per idle
source of service-class k.
Note that (11) comes in fact from the Engset multirate
loss model [29], in which calls come from ﬁnite sources and
compete for the available link bandwidth under the complete
sharing policy. The name “Engset” is justiﬁed by the fact that
for K = 1 service-class, (11) can be used to calculate time
congestion probabilities (by taking the sum of G(j)’s over all
blocking states) whose values are the same with the classical
Engset formula [30].
When C < j ≤ T, it can be proved (see Appendix A) that:

(a)
When Nk → ∞ for k = 1, . . . , K and the total offered
trafﬁc-load remains constant, then the call arrival process
is Poisson and the E-EMLM results. In that case, the
formula of G(j)’s is given by [3]:

When Nk
→ ∞ for k = 1, . . . , K and the total
offered trafﬁc-load remains constant, and T = C, then
no bandwidth compression is allowed and the classical
EMLM arises. In that case, the formula of G(j)’s is
given by the Kaufman-Roberts recursion [13], [14]:

D. Determination of various performance measures
The calculation of G(j)’s in (13) requires the value of
nk which is unknown. In other ﬁnite multirate loss mod-
els (e.g., [29]–[31]) there exist calculation methods for the
determination of nk in each state j through the use of an
equivalent stochastic system, with the same trafﬁc description
parameters and exactly the same set of states. However, the
state space determination of the equivalent system is complex,
especially for large capacity systems that serve many service-
classes. Thus, we avoid such methods and approximate nk
in state j, nk(j), as the mean number of service-class k
calls in state j, yk(j), when Poisson arrivals are considered,
i.e., nk(j) ≈ yk(j). Such approximations are common in the
literature and induce little error (e.g., [32]–[34]). The values
of yk(j) are given by (16) and (17) in the case of elastic and
adaptive service-classes, respectively [3]:

THE EF-EMLM UNDER THE BR POLICY
(EF-EMLM/BR)
In
the
following
subsections,
we
describe
the
EF-
EMLM/BR, we provide the recursive determination of the
link occupancy distribution, we show the relation of the EF-
EMLM/BR to other multirate loss models and determine the
various call-level performance measures of this model, which
assures QoS guarantee (regarding congestion probabilities).
A. Description of the proposed EF-EMLM/BR
The BR policy is used to guarantee a certain QoS for calls
of each service-class or attain equalization of call blocking
probabilities among different service-classes that share a link
by a proper selection of the BR parameters. If, for example,
equalization of call blocking probabilities is required between
calls of two service-classes with b1 = 1 and b2 = 10 bandwidth
units, respectively, then t(1) = 9 bandwidth units and t(2) = 0
bandwidth units so that b1+t(1) = b2+t(2). Note that t(1) = 9
bandwidth units means that 9 bandwidth units are reserved
to beneﬁt calls of the 2nd service-class. Similarly, if a link
accommodates calls of three service-classes with b1 = 1, b2 =
5 and b3 = 10 bandwidth units, respectively, and equalization
of call blocking probabilities is required between calls of the
ﬁrst two service-classes, then t(1) = 4 and t(2) = 0 bandwidth
units so that b1 + t(1) = b2 + t(2).
The application of the BR policy in a single link multirate
loss model is based on the assumption that the number of calls
of certain service-classes is negligible in those states j that
form the so-called reservation space. More precisely, in the
proposed EF-EMLM/BR the number of service-class k calls
is negligible in states j > T − t(k) and is incorporated in the
calculation of G(j)’s (see (21) below) by the variable Dk(j −
bk) given in (22). Generally speaking, the population of calls of
service-class k in the reservation space may not be negligible.
In [35] and [36], a complex procedure is implemented in order
to take into account this population and increase the accuracy
of call blocking probability results in the EMLM and Engset
multirate state-dependent loss models, respectively. However,
according to [36] this procedure may not always increase the
accuracy of the call blocking probability results compared to
simulation.
B. Determination of the link occupancy distribution
To apply the BR policy to the EF-EMLM we consider the
method of [37]. In that case, the formula for the approximate
calculation of G(j) takes the form:
G(j)=


(21)
where:
Dk(j − bk) =

bk for j ≤ T − t(k)
0
for j > T − t(k)

(22)
and t(k) is the reserved bandwidth (BR parameter) for service-
class k calls (elastic or adaptive).
C. Relation of the EF-EMLM/BR to other multirate loss mod-
els
(a)
When Nk → ∞ for k = 1, . . . , K, and the total offered
trafﬁc-load remains constant, then we have the Poisson
arrival process and the formula of G(j)’s is given by
[38]:
G(j)=

(23)
where αk = λk
µk (in erl), λk is the arrival rate of calls
of service-class k and the values of Dk(j) are given by
(22).
(b)
When all service-classes are elastic and Nk → ∞ for
k = 1, . . . , K and the total offered trafﬁc-load remains
constant, then the formula of G(j)’s is determined by
[39]:
G(j) =

(c)
When Nk → ∞ for k = 1, . . . , K, and the total
offered trafﬁc-load remains constant, and T = C, then
no bandwidth compression is allowed and the EMLM
under the BR policy results. In that case, the formula of
G(j)’s is given by the Roberts’recursion [37]:
G(j) =

D. Determination of various performance measures
The calculation of G(j)’s in (21) requires the value of nk
which is unknown. We approximate nk in state j, nk(j), as
the mean number of service-class k calls in state j, yk(j),
when Poisson arrivals are considered, i.e., nk(j) ≈ yk(j). The
values of yk(j) are given by (26) and (27) in the case of elastic
and adaptive service-classes, respectively:
yk(j)G(j)=

(27)
where the values of Dk(j) are given by (22) and the values
of G(j)’s by (23).
Note that in (26) and (27), the mean number of service-class
k calls in state j, yk(j) = 0, if j > T −t(k) as it is implied
by (22).
Having determined the values of G(j)’s according to (21),
we can calculate the link utilization based on (20) and the time
and call congestion probabilities as follows:
Pbk =
TP
j=T −bk−tk+1
G−1G(j)
(28)
Cbk =
T
X
j=T −bk−tk+1
G−1G(j)
(29)
where: G =
TP
j=0
G(j) is a normalization constant.
Note that, in order to calculate the call congestion probabilities
of service-class k, G(j)’s, the system should be determined
with Nk − 1 trafﬁc sources – hence, the similarity between
(28) and (29).
V.
EVALUATION
In this section, we present an application example and
compare the analytical results of the Time Congestion (TC)
probabilities and link utilization obtained from the E-EMLM,
the EF-EMLM and the EF-EMLM/BR. The corresponding
simulation results, presented for the EF-EMLM and the EF-
EMLM/BR, are mean values of 6 runs. The resultant reliability
ranges of the simulation measurements (conﬁdence intervals
of 95%) are very small (less than two orders of magnitude)
and, therefore, they are not presented. Simulation is based on
Simscript III simulation language [40].
We consider a single link of capacity C = 90 bandwidth
units (b.u.) that accommodates calls of three service-classes.
The ﬁrst two service-classes are elastic, while the third service-
class is adaptive. The trafﬁc characteristics of each service-
class of the EF-EMLM are:
•
1st service-class: N1 = 200, v1 = 0.10, b1 = 1 b.u.
•
2nd service-class: N2 = 200, v2 = 0.04, b2 = 4 b.u.
•
3rd service-class: N3 = 200, v3 = 0.01, b3 = 6 b.u.
In the case of the E-EMLM, the corresponding Poisson
trafﬁc loads are: α1,inf = 20 erl, α2,inf = 8 erl and α3,inf = 2
erl. We also consider two values of T:
a)
T = 90 b.u., where no bandwidth compression takes
place, and
b)
T = 100 b.u., where bandwidth compression takes place
and rmin = C
T = 0.9.
In the case of the EF-EMLM/BR model, we choose t(1)=5,
t(2)=2 and t(3)=0 in order to achieve blocking equalization
between calls of all service-classes since: b1+t(1)=b2+t(2)=
b3+t(3). In the x-axis of all ﬁgures, v1 and v2 increase in steps
of 0.01 and 0.005 erl, respectively, while v3 remains constant.
So in Point 1 we have (v1, v2, v3) = (0.10, 0.04, 0.01), while
in Point 6 (v1, v2, v3) = (0.15, 0.065, 0.01). In the case of
the E-EMLM, the corresponding Poisson trafﬁc loads in Point
1 and Point 8 are (α1,inf, α2,inf, α3,inf) = (20, 8, 2) and
(α1,inf, α2,inf, α3,inf) = (30, 13, 2), respectively.
In Figs. 3-4, we present the analytical and the simulation
TC probabilities of the 1st service-class for T = 90 b.u.
and T = 100 b.u., respectively. To better compare the cor-
responding TC probabilities results (while having numerical
values), we present in Table II and Table III, only for Points
1 and 6, an excerpt of the results of Fig. 3 and Fig. 4,
respectively. Similarly, in Figs. 5-6 and 7-8, we present the
corresponding results of the 2nd and 3rd service-class. In
the legend of all ﬁgures, the term N = inf. refers to the
E-EMLM where the number of trafﬁc sources is inﬁnite
for each service-class. Likewise, the term BR in all ﬁgures
refers to the EF-EMLM/BR. Note that the call congestion
probabilities of service-class k (k = 1, 2, 3) are quite close
to the corresponding TC probabilities of service-class k (since
they are obtained for a system with Nk − 1 = 199 trafﬁc
sources) and, therefore, are not presented herein. The interested
reader may resort to [1], where call congestion probabilities
are presented for the EF-EMLM.
All ﬁgures show that:
i)
analytical and simulation results of TC probabilities are
very close to each other,
ii)
the application of the compression/expansion mechanism
reduces congestion probabilities compared to those ob-
tained when C = T = 90 b.u. (compare, e.g., Figs. 3-4,
Figs. 5-6 and Figs. 7-8),
iii)
the co-existence of the BR policy and the compres-
sion/expansion mechanism reduces congestion probabil-
ities compared to those obtained when C = T = 90
b.u.,

the corresponding results obtained by the EF-EMLM.

Finally, in Figs. 9-10, we present the analytical and simu-
lation results of the link utilization (in b.u.) for T = 90 and
T = 100, respectively. It is clear, that the application of the
bandwidth compression/expansion mechanism increases link
utilization, since it decreases call congestion probabilities.

GENERALIZATION OF THE EF-EMLM
Consider a link of capacity C b.u. that accommodates calls
of ﬁnite and inﬁnite number of sources. Let Ke,inf and Ka,inf
be the set of elastic and adaptive service-classes (Ke,inf +
Ka,inf = Kinf) whose calls arrive in the link according to a
Poisson process. Similarly, let Ke,ﬁn and Ka,ﬁn be the set of
elastic and adaptive service-classes (Ke,ﬁn + Ka,ﬁn = Kﬁn)
whose calls arrive in the link according to a quasi-random pro-
cess. Then, the calculation of the link occupancy distribution,
G(j), can be done by the following formula:
G(j)=

The proof of (30) is based on the combination of the proofs
proposed for the corresponding ﬁnite model in [1] and the
inﬁnite model of [3], and therefore is omitted. Such a mixture
of service-classes does not destroy the accuracy of the model,

since both the E-EMLM and EF-EMLM give quite satisfactory
results compared to simulation. The TC probabilities, CC
probabilities and the link utilization in the generalized model
can be determined by (18), (19) and (20), respectively.

CONCLUSION
We propose an analytical model for the call-level perfor-
mance assessment of telecom networks, when elastic and/or
adaptive calls of different service-classes come from ﬁnite
trafﬁc-sources and compete for the available bandwidth of a
single link with ﬁxed capacity. Because of the existence of
the bandwidth compression/expansion mechanism for handling
the elastic/adaptive trafﬁc, the proposed model does not have
a product form solution. Therefore, we propose approximate
but recursive formulas for the calculation of the most im-
portant performance measures, namely time congestion and
call congestion probabilities, and link utilization. In addition,
we incorporate in our model the bandwidth reservation policy
(whereby a part of the link’s available bandwidth is reserved
to beneﬁt calls of higher bandwidth requirements), and study
its effect on the performance measures. Simulation results
verify the analytical results and prove the accuracy and the
consistency of the proposed model. Furthermore, we show
the relation of the proposed model to other multirate loss
models and generalize it to include a mixture of service-
classes of ﬁnite and inﬁnite number of trafﬁc sources. Potential
applications of the proposed model are in the environment of
wireless networks that support elastic and adaptive trafﬁc. As
a future work, we would like to incorporate into the proposed
model the peculiarities of wireless networks.
