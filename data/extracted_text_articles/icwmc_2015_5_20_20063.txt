Abstract—A 26µW voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) and 
mixer have been designed in an 130nm RF CMOS process for a 
direct conversion DPSK demodulator in the MedRadio frequency 
band (401-406MHz). The circuit utilizes a two-stage (VCO) design 
directly coupled to a passive ring mixer. With biasing circuits it 
requires an active die area of 49×39 um. The circuit is designed to 
operate from a 1 V supply and achieves a post-extracted simulated 
phase noise of -118dBc/Hz when injection locked. With the passive 
mixer, conversion gain is -18.4dB.

I. INTRODUCTION 
There is a growing need for low power radio frequency (RF) 
technology for medical implant devices. The original Medical 
Implant Communication Services (MICS) band has been 
expanded in recent years to the new MedRadio band, increasing 
the available spectrum to 401-406 MHz [1]. 
Current technologies for low power radio consume an order 
of magnitude more power than is acceptable for implantable 
operation. Proposed in this paper is a two-stage (VCO) and 
mixer configured as a Vance demodulator [2]. The design is 
intended for use in a direct conversion, differential phase-shift 
keying (DPSK) receiver front-end for a MedRadio transceiver. 
The circuit has been designed to operate with minimal power 
consumption in moderate inversion while maintaining 
performance and reliability. 
The design and implementation of the circuit are discussed in 
detail in Section II, including information on design 
methodologies for low power design in deeply scaled CMOS 
processes. In Section III simulated, post-extracted design 
results will be discussed. Finally, conclusions and future 
directions will be discussed in Section IV. 
II. CIRCUIT DESIGN 
In order to reduce power consumption a two-stage VCO was 
designed using the Maneatis delay-cell, which uses positive 
feedback to reduce the required transconductance to achieve 
oscillation [3]. This VCO is designed to be directly coupled to 
a passive ring mixer; the loading from the mixer is accounted 
for in the delay calculation. By injection locking the ring 
oscillator to the incoming signal, the quadrature output of the 
oscillator represents a delayed version of the incoming signal. 
The input signal is mixed with this delayed replica to form a 
Vance demodulator, which can directly downconvert and 
demodulate DPSK signals [2]. The block diagram (Fig. 1) for 
the proposed receiver front-end represents a minimal set of 
circuitry needed to demodulate such DPSK signals. Though not 
included, the literature contains microwatt LNA [4]. Details of 
the oscillator and mixer designs follow. 
A. Voltage Controlled Oscillator Design 
The Maneatis delay cell based VCO topology is shown in Fig. 
2. The delay cell uses positive feedback to reduce the parasitic 
conductance at the output of the cell, reducing the required 
transconductance required for startup. The oscillation frequency 
is given by the following equation [5]: 
𝑓𝑓𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 =
1
2𝜋𝜋 ∙
𝐺𝐺𝑚𝑚
𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 
(1) 
where Ctot is the total capacitance and Gm is the total 
transconductance at the drain of the delay cell. Examining the 
half-circuit of the schematic yields the following expression for 
Gm: 
 
𝐺𝐺𝑚𝑚 = ට𝑔𝑔𝑚𝑚𝑀𝑀3
2
− ൫𝑔𝑔𝑚𝑚𝑀𝑀1 − 𝑔𝑔𝑚𝑚𝑀𝑀2 + 𝑔𝑔𝑑𝑑𝑜𝑜𝑀𝑀1 + 𝑔𝑔𝑑𝑑𝑜𝑜𝑀𝑀2 + 𝑔𝑔𝑑𝑑𝑜𝑜𝑀𝑀3൯
2
 
(2) 
The negative transconductance terms result from the cross-
coupled transistors, M2,5, in parallel with the active load 
transistors, M1,4. The conductance can be cancelled for a given 
bias and transistor size, reducing the expression for frequency of 
oscillation to the following: 
𝑓𝑓𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 =
1
2𝜋𝜋 ∙
𝑔𝑔𝑚𝑚𝑀𝑀3
𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡  
(3) 
By exploiting this reduced formula the entire VCO can be 
implemented using two differential Maneatis delay-cells 
connected in quadrature with no external passive components, 
reducing the size and complexity of the VCO. Because the

oscillator utilizes only active components with small feature 
sizes, the oscillator occupies little die area. Due to the 
quadrature connection, each of the two cells contributes a 90o 
phase shift, with the final 180° phase shift necessary   for 
oscillation contributed by a cross-coupled connection from the 
output of the oscillator back to the input. 
Wideband frequency control of the VCO can be achieved by 
controlling either the bias current or supply voltage, with the 
former preferred. This allows the oscillator to operate over a 
relatively large tuning range, allowing for guaranteed 
functionality while operating in the low power moderate 
inversion region. This region of operation is more susceptible 
to PVT variations; hence a wide tuning range allows for more 
robust operation. The first tuning method is to vary the bias 
current by changing the voltage at the gate of the current source, 
M7. This is used to adjust the free running frequency of the 
oscillator in implementation, allowing it to be more easily 
injection locked to the incoming signal. This can be adjusted 
via an on-chip generated control voltage, or more likely, by 
segmenting and digitally controlling a current mirror to 
increase/decrease bias current as needed. Using this tuning 
method, the oscillation frequency changes nearly linear with the 
applied change in the input current; this is consistent with 
theory as the transconductance varies linearly with the bias 
current for a given overdrive voltage (e.g., 𝑔𝑔𝑚𝑚 = 2𝐼𝐼𝐷𝐷/𝑉𝑉𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜). The 
free running frequency of the oscillator and VCO power 
consumption is plotted versus input bias voltage is shown in 
Fig. 3. 
As can be seen in Fig. 3, this design allows for a wide range 
of tunability, covering the entirety of the MedRadio frequencies 
and allowing for correction due to PVT variation.  
The cell can be injection locked by inserting a frequency-
dependent current into the Iinj port (Fig. 2). Simulations have 
validated functionality for injection signals as small as 1μA 
across process corners. 
Injection locking is important in this application as it is 
necessary to create the delayed version of the signal needed for 
demodulation; it also reduces oscillator phase noise compared 
to its free-running state. 
B. Passive Mixer 
To minimize power consumption in the receiver chain, a 
passive ring mixer has been selected. The passive ring (Fig. 4) 
is implemented using NMOS transistors to allow for the best 
tradeoff between size and switching resistance. 
The mixer consists of a set of alternating switches that are 
selectively opened and closed by the injected signal and delayed 
replica, multiplying the two signals. The output of a low noise 
amplifier (LNA) can be used as the injection signal for the 
oscillator, which drives one branch of the mixer, while the LNA 
can drive the other branch. DPSK information is then 
demodulated in the following manner. The input signal is phase 
modulated, so the mixer will produce a high- (low-) output 
when the phase of the input signal leads (lags) the delayed 
replica.  
In choosing the passive mixer, a tradeoff was made between 
gain and power consumption. For applications where more gain 
is necessary, an active mixer can be employed consuming 
similar power to the VCO delay cells.  
C. Design Methods 
The circuit elements for both the VCO and the mixer were 
determined using the 𝑔𝑔𝑚𝑚/𝐼𝐼𝐷𝐷 methodology, allowing for sizing 
of transistors using pre-derived look-up tables of geometry 
independent properties. This method produces more accurate

first-pass device sizes than square-law hand calculations [6]. 
This is because standard hand calculations do not take into 
account short-channel effects that start to become dominant in 
deep-submicron CMOS. The script is flexible enough to 
accommodate the addition of multiple stages and their 
associated loading effects, which is important for ultra-low 
power design. 
A MATLAB script was written to automatically size the 
VCO and the mixer, taking into account the mixers loading 
effect on the VCO. A lookup table, generated using DC 
simulations of the BSIM4 device models, was generated using 
OCEAN scripting. The table contents are geometry 
independent parameters (e.g., current density, 𝐼𝐼𝐷𝐷 𝑊𝑊
⁄
; 
transconductance efficiency, 𝑔𝑔𝑚𝑚/𝐼𝐼𝐷𝐷 , etc.). The script uses 
desired properties of the delay cell (e.g., total power 
consumption, desired oscillation frequency, and the desired 
operating points of the transistors in both the mixer and VCO) 
to lookup information in the tables to satisfy such conditions. 
For optimal power efficiency the 𝑔𝑔𝑚𝑚/𝐼𝐼𝐷𝐷 values of the VCO 
were chosen in a region of moderate inversion, 23 V-1, where 
decreasing the 𝑔𝑔𝑚𝑚/𝐼𝐼𝐷𝐷  value results in increasingly strong 
inversion.  
In addition to transconductance, the device capacitance per 
unit width was also found according to the desired power 
characteristics. Layout capacitance was estimated based on the 
cell size and the cell geometries were iterated in the script until 
a satisfactory solution was achieved that optimized the design 
for low power at the desired operating frequency. The final 
devices obtained from the script are shown in Table I. 
III. RESULTS 
The VCO and mixer pair has been designed and extracted 
using an 8 metal, RF CMOS technology. The chip layout is 
shown in Fig. 5. The design is compact and is dominated by 
biasing and decoupling circuitry, occupying a die size of 
49×39μm, not including bonding pads. 
This design has been extracted and simulated at 37°C because 
the intended use is for a medical implant. The simulated results 
of the circuit show that the overall design consumes 25.8μA 
when the supply voltage is 1V, at typical operating conditions. 
The circuit has also been tested in fast and slow fabrication 
corners. Simple adjustment of the biasing current and supply 
voltage has been shown to allow the design to operate across 
expected PVT variations. 
The VCO achieves a free running oscillation frequency of 
403.5MHz at a typical process corner, with and associated 
phase noise of -51.8bBc/Hz. When the VCO is under injection 
lock conditions the phase noise improves to -118dBc/Hz, using 
an ideal injection lock signal. The free running and injection 
locked VCO phase noise characteristics are shown in Fig. 6.  
The passive mixer achieved an overall voltage conversion 
gain of -18.4dB and 1 dB compression point of -13.5dBm, as 
shown in Fig. 7. This conversion gain is far below the 
theoretical limit (~ -4 dB) obtained when square wave drive 
signals are used. Such a signal would result in a significant 
power consumption increase in the VCO. Hence a tradeoff was 
made between power consumption and conversion gain. The 
effects of this tradeoff can be mitigated by using a high-gain 
LNA, or by using an active mixer. 
Post-extracted simulations have demonstrated that this 
system is capable of demodulating a PSK signal. MATLAB is 
used to generate a piecewise linear voltage signal carrying the 
DPSK at the desired injection locking frequency. The signal is 
used as the injection locking frequency for the oscillator and to 
drive the RF port of the designed mixer. Representative 
input/output waveforms are shown in Fig. 8. 
To compare this work with other low power VCOs, a figure 
of merit (FOM) by which different VCO designs can be 
compared and captures the two most critical design criteria, 
power consumption and the phase noise (NF) is calculated:

where 𝐹𝐹𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜  and 𝐹𝐹𝑚𝑚  are the oscillation frequency and offset 
frequency, respectively, 𝑃𝑃 is power consumed, in mW, and 𝐿𝐿 is 
the phase noise at the offset frequency, in dBc/Hz [7]. It should

[9]. 
As can be seen in Table II, this design exhibits a good phase 
noise while operating at a low power point. The work outlined 
in [7] has been include as a comparison point as the design 
outlined in it also uses a two-stage Maneatis cell VCO, while 
the other papers utilize other delay cells.

IV. FUTURE WORK & CONCLUSION 
A low power VCO and mixer pair is implemented in this 
paper. The two-stage VCO, based on a Maneatis delay cell, has 
a phase noise of -118dBc/Hz at 1MHz offset when injection 
locked, and requires no external passive components. The 
passive ring mixer has a conversion gain of -18.4dB. The VCO 
and mixer configuration is used as a Vance demodulator 
designed for the MedRadio frequency band. Targeted for low 
power applications, the design consumes 26μW of power from 
a 1V supply. Future work will expand this design with the 
integration of an LNA and receiver back-end and examine 
effects of DC offset and compensation techniques.
