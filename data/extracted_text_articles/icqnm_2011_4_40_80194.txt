Abstract — The effect of a TiO2 nanoparticle suspension (4 mg 
in 5 ml distilled water) doped or not with gold or iron, 
complexed or not with α- or β-cyclodextrin, on the mitotic 
division was studied. The treatment was performed in the M 
cellular mitotic cycle phase, in the meristematic tissue of 
Nigella damascena radicels, being analyzed the cytogenetic 
modifications. The cyclodextrin type and the ratio between 
cyclodextrin and titanium dioxide affect the percentage of 
normal cells and the chromosome aberration type. The TiO2 
complexed with α-cyclodextrin did not facilitate the reunion of 
the chromosome broken ends (absence of bridges in anaphase 
and in telophase). The titanium dioxide doped with iron, 
complexed with α- or β-cyclodextrin, also reduced the 
percentage of reunion of the broken ends of the chromosomes. 
These findings suggest the possibility of using doped or 
undoped TiO2, complexed with α-cyclodextrin, in the 
anticarcinogen therapy. 
Keywords - TiO2-Au, TiO2-Fe, cyclodextrin, chromosome 
mutations. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Although the bimetallic particles were obtained long ago, 
their characterization was effected at the end of the 20th 
century [1]. The conjugation of bimetallic nanoparticles of 
AuNP type with oligonucleotides facilitates their use in 
molecular biology experiments and nanobiotechnology [2]. 
Other types of AuNP biconjugate with peptides, lipids, 
enzymes, drugs or viruses, were also obtained with 
application in nanobiotechnology, nanomedicine and/or in 
gene therapy. 
Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides. Depending on 
the glucose moiety number, they are classified in: α-
cyclodextrins (with 6 glucose units), β-cyclodextrins (with 7 
glucose units), and other greather homologues. The 
complexes with pharmaceutical products are usually better 
accepted and tolerated by the organism; they protect the 
bioactive substances against degradation (oxygen, humidity) 
and reveal controlled release properties. They are non-toxic 
and stable at the human digestive enzyme action. They are 
used in the obtaining of some pharmaceutical products, food 
additives, in agriculture, a/o [3]. In recent papers, the effect 
of β-cyclodextrin conjugate with TiO2 [4] or with different 
bioactive substances [5], [6] was analyzed, in different 
experimental conditions. 
In the present study nanoparticles of TiO2-Au and TiO2-
Fe, dispersed in α- or β-cyclodextrin, the ratio between TiO2 
and cyclodextrin being 1:1 or 1:2, were used. The 
experiments were performed at a radiobiological tester plant 
(Nigella damascena L.), the chromosome aberrations from 
the meristematic radicel tissue being used as radiobiological 
indices.

MATERIAL AND METHODS 
A. Nanoparticle achievement 
1) Achievement 
of 
undoped 
and 
doped 
TiO2 
nanocrystals. 
Undoped and doped titanium dioxide nanocrystals were 
synthesized by the sol-gel route, using the precursors: 
titanium isopropoxide, isopropyl alcohol, distilled water, 
nitric acid, gold (III) chloride trihydrate and ferrous nitrate. 5 
ml of titanium isopropoxide (in drops) were mixed with 30 
77

ml of isopropyl alcohol, under continuous stirring. After a 
few minutes of stirring, distilled water was added, 
continuously controlling the solution pH with nitric acid in 
order to avoid the precipitation. In the case of iron-doped and 
gold-doped TiO2 ions, after the adjustment of the pH (2.5 for 
Au, 5.0 for Fe), the previously prepared solutions, namely 
iron nitrate and gold (III) chloride trihydrate were added 
under continuous stirring. In both cases, the gel was dried 
and washed in order to remove the secondary reaction 
products. The calcination was achieved in the oven, at a 
temperature of 250ºC for undoped TiO2 and 500ºC for Au or 
Fe doped TiO2. The achieved nanocrystals based on titanium 
dioxide were used for complexation with cyclodextrins. 
2) Achievement of complexes based on TiO2 with α-
cyclodextrin or β-cyclodextrin. 
α- and β- cyclodextrins used for the co-crystalization 
with the previously attained titanium dioxide were of 
analytical purity (Fluka Chemie AG). In order to perform the 
complexation/co-crystalization, different solvents were used 
as suspension medium. In 1 ml distilled water, 0.054 g of α- 
(α-CD) or 0.067 g of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) was dissolved, 
at a temperature of 50ºC. 0.075 g of undoped and doped 
TiO2 was added to the solution, under continuous and 
vigorous stirring for 30 minutes at 50ºC. For the completion 
of the complexes crystallization, the solution was cooled and 
kept for 12 hours at a temperature of 5ºC, followed by 
filtration and drying of the achieved nanocrystals. The 
obtained materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction 
(XRD), 
scanning/transmission 
electron 
microscopy 
(SEM/TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX).  
Biological experiment 
The experiment was performed in vivo, on the 
radiogenetic tester species Nigella damascena (Fam. 
Ranunculaceae). This species, used for a long time, is for its 
features: small somatic chromosome number different 
morphologically (2n=12), synchronized cell mitotic cycle, 
centromeres situated near the nuclear envelope, and absence 
of the bioactive substances in seeds [7], [8], [9]. The seeds 
with radicels of about 10 mm length were treated in the 
mitotic phase of the cellular cycle (for 2 hours), with a 
suspension of TiO2-Au or TiO2-Fe, complexed or not with α-
cyclodextrin, or with β-cyclodextrin (4 mg TiO2-Me in 5 ml 
distilled water). After treatment, the radicels were harvested 
for the cytogenetic investigations. 
B. Cytogenetic investigations 
The chromosome aberrations were analyzed in the 
radicular meristematic tissue, on squash preparation type, 
stain with a Carr solution. The normal and aberrant phases 
of the mitotic cycle were analyzed, as well as the metabolic 
and structural modifications of the chromosomes and of the 
mitotic spindle. Although in the literature there are 
numerous papers about the environmental factors’ effect at 
the chromosome level, regarding the nanoparticles’ effect at 
the chromosome level the information is poor. The 
investigation performed at the Chinese hamster ovary, with 
TiO2 particles, in the presence or absence of the UV light, 
evidenced that these not enhance the chromosomal 
aberrations’ frequency [10]. Similar results were obtained 
by other authors, in the genotoxicity tests performed in 
Chinese hamster ovary, as well as in experiments on aquatic 
organisms (Daphnia magna, Onchorhynchus mykiss and 
green algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata), acutely 
exposed to the ultrafine TiO2 particle-types [11], or in 
experiments in fish (Nothobranchius rachovi), at which the 
mitotic index was analyzed in different organs and variants 
[12], [13]. 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
A. Characterization of the nanoparticles 
The XRD patterns (Fig. 1) analyses present the 
crystallization as anatase form of the undoped/Au or Fe 
doped TiO2, even if the calcination temperatures for the 
TiO2 doping surpass the value of 250ºC. The presence of the 
dopant in the crystalline network of the titanium dioxide 
prevents the transition of phases from anatase to rutile. 
From the diffraction spectra it is noticed that the dopants did 
not present separate peaks, which means that they are 
distributed uniformly in the crystalline network. From the 
surface morphology (SEM) it can be observed that the TiO2-
Au and TiO2-Fe nanospheres’ dimensions range between 10 
and 20 nm (Fig. 2, a and b). EDX microprobe provided a 
semiquantitative elemental analysis of the surface indicating 
the Ti, O, Au and Fe presence (Fig. 2, c and d).

From the SEM analyses of TiO2 complexes with α- or β-
cyclodextrin (Figs. 3-5), the needle-like, parallelepiped shape 
of the crystals (or co-crystals) for the undoped TiO2/α-CD 
and β-CD complexes can be seen. The crystals have much 
smaller dimensions compared to those of the raw materials 
(pure α- or β-CD), the length being in the range of 10-100 
nanometers, and the width of only a few tens of nanometers. 
In the case of complexes TiO2-Au/α-CD, the crystals present 
similar morphologies and dimensions to the undoped TiO2, 
but these are more agglomerated. In the case of TiO2-Au/β-
CD complexes, the crystal morphology is different; the 
crystals are more uniform, of smaller dimensions, 
agglomerated, of rhomboidal (generally polyhedral) form. 
The approximate dimensions of the crystals are between tens 
and hundreds of nanometers.

The EDX analyses of the obtained complexes with 
undoped/doped TiO2 have indicated a higher concentration 
of Ti in the complexes, especially in the case of α-CD 
complexation, which can be explained by the fact that pure 
α-CD and its complexes are more soluble in the water system 
than β-CD or the corresponding complexes.  
The TiO2-Au or TiO2–Fe nanoparticles are disposed on 
the surface of the α-CD or β-CD (Fig. 6). For the radicel 
treatment, the complex TiO2-Me / cyclodextrin was 
suspended in distilled water, having as a result an aqueous 
solution of TiO2-Au or TiO2–Fe nanoparticles in α-CD or β-
CD (Figs. 7, 8), without crystalline structure, easily absorbed 
by the cells.

of normal cells was dependent especially on the nanoparticle 
types (Table I). Thus, in the treatments with unconjugated 
TiO2, the percentage of normal cell recorded values of about 
96% (except for the variant with β-cyclodextrin in ratio 1:2), 
79

92-94% in variants with Au-TiO2 and around 95% in the 
variants with Fe-TiO2.  
The  normal  cell  percentage  in  the  presence  of  TiO2 
nanoparticles, without metals or cyclodextrin, recorded 
values similar to those recorded by the TiO2 nanoparticles 
complexed with cyclodextrin α or β. 
Because the cyclodextrin is a hydrosoluble substance and 
in an aqueous solution these crystals are dissolved, the shape 
of the cyclodextrin crystals does not influence their 
absorption in the plant meristem and implicitly the 
percentage of aberrant or normal cells in different mitotic 
phases, as well as the structural modifications of the 
chromosomes and of the mitotic spindle.

C. Structural modifications of the chromosomes 
As a consequence of the free radicals action, the 
chromosomes are broken, which leads to structural 
chromosome aberrations. In different phases of the mitosis, 
or under influence of some substances, the broken ends of 
the chromosomes can be reunited or not. In the absence of 
the reunion processes, acentric fragments, minutes, a/o 
result (Figs. 9, 10, 12), and after the reunion of two brocken 
chromosomes, mainly bridges (Fig. 11), or arch result. 
The BR index (anaphasic fragment frequency/anaphasic 
bridge frequency), points out the possibility of a substance 
or another factor to reunite of the broken ends of the 
chrfomosomes.  A low BR index, suggests a substance with 
role in reunion of the broken ends of the chromosomes, 
having a radioprotective role [14]. A high BR index 
suggests that a substance not favor the reunion of the broken  
chromosome ends, the affected cells being eliminate from 
tissue (Table II).  
The cyclodextrin type and ratio between TiO2: 
cyclodextrin influenced the reunion or not of the broken ends 
of the chromosomes, and implicitly the aberration type 
(Table II). The absence of bridges in anaphase and telophase 
at variants with TiO2-α-cyclodextrin, suggests that the α-
cyclodextrin does not facilitate the chromosomal reunion 
processes of the chromosome broken ends. Thus, in variant 
TiO2-α-cyclodextrin (ratio 1:2), 66.66% acentric fragments 
are present in anaphase and 11.11% in telophase, while the 
chromosomal bridges are absent. This feature can be used for 
the progressive elimination from organism of the cells with a 
high multiplication ratio (carcinogen cells). At a ratio of 1:1 
between the two components, the percentage of acentric 
fragments is lower (15.73, and 8.86%), the reunion process 
of the broken ends being also absent.

Figure 12.  Kinetochore inactivation and chromosome break (TiO2-Au/β-
CD, 1:1) 
The β-cyclodextrin presence induces a very low percent 
of reunion of the broken ends, only at a ratio of 1:1. 
Complexed with cyclodextrin, the Fe-TiO2 manifested 
the inhibition of the reunion process of the chromosomes’ 
broken ends (the absence of the bridges or their presence in a 
lower percentage), the efficacy being dependent on the 
cyclodextrin type and the ratio TiO2 : cyclodextrin. 
The nanoparticles conjugated with gold or iron, 
independent of the cyclodextrin type presence and of the 
ratio TiO2 : cyclodextrin, induced in a small percentage 
(0.57%-1.92%) the inactivation of the mitotic spindle, as 
well as the kinetochore inactivation (0.46-1.15%; Fig. 12). 
The most stable phase from the cellular cycle was 
prometaphase, and the most sensitive one was anaphase, 
independent on the experimental variant (Table I). Although 
in the literature there are numerous papers about the 
environmental factors’ effect at the chromosome level, 
regarding the nanoparticles’ effect at the chromosome level 
the information is poor. The investigation performed at the 
Chinese hamster ovary, with TiO2 particles, in the presence 
or absence of the UV light, evidenced that these not enhance 
the chromosomal aberrations’ frequency [10]. Similar results 
were obtained by other authors, in the genotoxicity tests 
performed in Chinese hamster ovary, as well as in 
experiments on aquatic organisms (Daphnia magna, 
Onchorhynchus mykiss and green algae Pseudokirchneriella 
subcapitata), acutely exposed to the ultrafine TiO2 particle-
types 
[11], 
or 
in 
experiments 
performed 
in 
fish 
(Nothobranchius rachovi), at which the mitotic index (the 
metaphase number in 100 microscopic fields) was analyzed 
in different organs and experimental variants [12], [13]. The 
recorded values were dependent on the organ, being bigger 
in animals treated with TiO2, in comparison with untreated 
Control. Other authors [15] analyzed the percentage of 
chromosomal aberrations induced by three commercial TiO2 
types in isolated human lymphocyte cultures. The percentage 
of chromosomal aberrations depended on the treatment type, 
the features of the used product, a/o. The anatase 
crystallization form induced a significant increase of the total 
chromosomal number, but without establishing a dose – 
response relation. The main types of recorded chromosomal 
aberrations were not presented. 
D. Metabolic modifications of the chromosomes 
The metabolic modifications of the chromosomes 
affected especially the condensation degree of the chromatin 
fibre and the synchronisation of this process, and others 
(Table II). Their presence reveals the action of a stress or an 
experimental factor which makes the interphase cells enter  
into mitosis abruptly.

Figure 13.  a. PCC in prophase (TiO2-Fe/β-CD, 1:2); b. DCC in metaphase 
(TiO2-β-CD, 1:1) 
     The main metabolic modifications are premature 
chromosome condensation (PCC; Fig. 13a.), or delay in 
chromosome condensation (DCC; Figs. 13b, 14), as well as 
gaps (the uncoloured regions on the chromosome length), 
differences in condensation degree of the chromatin fibers 
in eu- and heterochromatin regions of the chromosomes, 
resulting a banding aspect of the chromosomes (met 
especially in metaphase), the parallel disposition of the 
chromatin fibers in prophase, a/o. PCC and DCC were met 
in a low percentage (0.72-4.08%), especially in variants 
treated with β-cyclodextrin, independent of the presence or 
absence of the chelated metal (gold or iron).

CONCLUSIONS 
The undoped and doped TiO2 nanocrystals used in this 
experiment presented the anatase form crystallization, the 
TiO2-Au and TiO2-Fe nanospheres presented dimensions 
ranging between 10-20 nm. 
The TiO2-Me nanoparticles, complexed or not with α- or 
β-cyclodextrin, presented a different morphology, dependent 
on the doped metal and cyclodextrin type. The TiO2-Me 
nanocrystals are present at the surface of cyclodextrin 
crystals. 
In an aqueous solution, cyclodextrin crystals are 
dissolved and TiO2-Me are suspended in a cyclodextrin 
solution, being thus absorbed in the meristem cells. 
Doped or undoped TiO2 nanocrystals, complexed with α- 
or β-cyclodextrin, induced both metabolic and structural 
modifications at the chromosome and mitotic spindle level, 
depending on the chelated metal, the cyclodextrin type and 
the ratio TiO2: cyclodextrin (1:2 or 1:1). 
As the cyclodextrin is a hydrosoluble substance, the 
different form of crystals of the complexed TiO2-Me-
cyclodextrin, did not influence the percentage of aberrant or 
normal cells in different mitotic phases, as well as the 
structural or metabolic modifications of the chromosomes 
and of the nuclear spindle. 
The cyclodextrin type and ratio between TiO2: 
cyclodextrin influenced both the reunion process of the 
chromosome broken ends, and the chromosome aberration 
type. 
The α-cyclodextrin induced a high acentric fragment 
percentage in anaphase and telophase, and did not facilitate 
the reunion processes of the chromosome broken ends (the 
absence of bridges from cells). For this reason the variant 
TiO2∼α-cyclodextrin (ratio 1:2), can be used for the 
progressive elimination, from organism, of the cells with a 
high mitotic multiplication rate (carcinogen cells). 
The TiO2 conjugated or not with a metal (gold or iron), 
complexed or not with a cyclodextrin, induced, in a low 
percentage, the metabolic modification of the chromosomes, 
their compaction degree in prophase and metaphase being 
affected (PCC and DCC), as well as the inactivation of the 
kinetochore or mitotic spindle.
