Abstract—Health care services are encountering critical issues
due to the increasing demand for services at the time of economic
recession. Hospital performance is subject to many constraints,
and planning is made more difﬁcult by the complexity and
uncertainty of demand. Population ageing is creating immense
pressures on healthcare facilities across the world, leaving them
struggling to cope with the growing demand for elderly healthcare
services. Current demand-supply gaps result in prolonged waiting
times for patients and substantial cost burdens for healthcare
systems due to delayed discharges. This paper discusses on a
project that uses modelling and simulation to address elderly care
pathways in the Irish healthcare sector. The faster management
of frail patients admitted to acute hospitals and the introduction
of new intermediate care beds are alternative interventions that
healthcare executives are interested in simulating to examine their
impact on the performance of the elderly care system. Using a
detailed simulation model along with statistical analysis, hospital
managers can assess the critical performance and ﬁnancial issues
of the current system and highlight the decision variables that
could signiﬁcantly improve the ﬂow of elderly patients.
Keywords—Population Ageing, Elderly Care, Discrete Event

INTRODUCTION
This study builds on and extends our previous research
presented to the SIMUL 2012 Conference, in Lisbon, Portugal
[1]: this extended version includes more detail in all sections.
Advances in pharmaceutical and medical technology during
the last century caused a major shift in global demograph-
ics, increasing life expectancy to unprecedented ﬁgures. So
there are now more aged people than ever before - in both
developing and developed countries which can be seen as an
indicator of advances in global health [2]. Worldwide, there are
around 600 million people aged 60 years and over: as Fig. 1-a
shows, this total is expected to double by 2025 and to reach
virtually two billion by 2050 (World Health Organization -
WHO) [3]. In Europe, there are currently 108 million elderly
people who constitute 15% of the continent’s population, a
ﬁgure which is forecast to increase to 26% by 2050 [4], a
trend which is reﬂected in Ireland where the elderly population
is projected to grow from 500, 000 to 1.3 million over the
next 30 years [5]. As Fig. 1-b shows, projections by the Irish
3S Group is a research centre in Collage of Business, Dublin Institute of
Technology (DIT), Dublin, Ireland web site(see http://www.3sgroup.ie)
National Council on Ageing and Older People (2002) show
female and male ‘seniors’ (65 years and over) accounting,
respectively, for 16.4% and 14.1% of the Irish population
by 2021[6]. Older people are the major users of health and
social care services while elderly patients currently represent
11% of the Irish population, they are estimated to account
for up to 50% of hospital bed usage [5]. At the same time
as increasing the demand for health and social care services
generally, population ageing is affecting the supply of health
and social care professionals as the health workforce will have
to grow to cope with the demands of the ageing population.
These projections constitute a major challenge that is critical to
prosperity and quality of life of society as a whole, and promise
to put great demand on national healthcare organizations.
Consequently, pressures are now rising on Irish hospitals,
not only due to the increased demand for acute hospital
beds, but also because elderly patients use hospital resources
disproportionately: these demographic changes mean that Irish
hospitals are struggling to ﬁll the existing gap between supply
and demand while maintaining their service quality[5]. The
global economic crisis has inﬂicted severe cuts on available
healthcare funds and led to a ‘limited resource’ policy in hos-
pitals and other healthcare services. Thus Irish hospitals and
elderly healthcare facilities both face equally grave capacity
planning challenges if they are to respond effectively to current
and projected demand increases [7].
The shortage of beds resulting from this demand increase
has had numerous facets that have adversely impacted the
overall performance of the Irish healthcare system. Firstly, bed
shortages have signiﬁcantly increased overcrowding in Emer-
gency Departments (EDs), with high percentages of patients
leaving without having been seen, and increased mortality
rates for elderly patients [5]. Several national reports have
highlighted the growing demand for emergency care and the
simultaneous decrease in the number of EDs operating to meet
this demand; mainly due to economic constraints. Over 1.1
million individuals attended the 33 Irish EDs during 2010, 30%
of whom were admitted to hospitals as emergency admissions
[8]. Secondly, shortage of community care beds leads to
delayed discharges from acute hospitals, which not only delays
new admissions to hospitals, but also burdens hospitals with
high and unjustiﬁed costs, since acute beds are among the most
expensive resources of the entire healthcare system [9]. Further
complications associated with delayed patient discharges can

adversely affect acute hospitals’ abilities to cut their waiting
lists and deliver their services efﬁciently and effectively [10].
Finally, delays due to the lack of short- and long-term bed
availability create substantial waiting times at many other
stages of healthcare systems. As in other sectors, long waiting
times in elderly care services are the most frequent source
of complaints reported by patients to healthcare executives
every year [5]. In Ireland, prolonged waiting times have been
reported with more than 500 patients waiting on trolleys for
hospital admission every day; 18% of patients are waiting more
than 24 hours and 40% between 10 − 24 hours [8]. It is clear
that Irish healthcare already operates over capacity,- and the
overcrowding in EDs can lead to compromises in quality of
care and patient safety [11, 12].
This paper presents a project implemented to support Irish
health executives in taking decisions regarding the manage-
ment of the care of elderly patients. By modelling their dis-
patch pathways, we developed a model that enables healthcare
decision makers to examine the dynamics of their care systems,
and also highlights the variability in patients’ dispatch delays,
and the limitations on the resources available in healthcare
facilities. The model also provides a holistic capacity-planning
model that can be used to assess proposed strategies to
handle existing bottlenecks and improve the overall experience
for elderly patients attending EDs, and throughout the Irish
hospital system. The paper reviews literature on discrete event
simulation and its applications in healthcare domains, then
introduces the conceptual model depicting the elderly patients’
journeys through the healthcare system and their different dis-
charge destinations. The development phases of the simulation
model including data collection, coding, and then validation
are presented. The proposed model is then used to examine
two scenarios proposed by healthcare policy makers to improve
patient ﬂow, after which experiments and statistical analyses
are conducted to determine the most signiﬁcant factors that
affect patient ﬂows and the magnitudes of their impact.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Business environments exhibit two types of complexities:
combinatorial and dynamic [13]. Combinatorial (or detailed)
complexity describes how complex a problem is in terms of
alternatives, which may point to the possibility of very large
numbers of potential solutions [14, 15] and can be used to
represent any combinatorial problem such as scheduling ﬂight
legs [16]. In contrast, dynamic complexity relates to non-
linear interactions of system components over time, and may
appear in even simple systems [13, 17, 18]. System complexity
complicates, and thus can adversely affect, human decision-
making processes, which can result in sub-optimal, or even
unintended, results (side effects), which are mainly due to the
bounded rationality of decision makers [19-21]; misperception
and the non-linearity of the complexity [22, 23].
Complexity in healthcare systems stems from various
causes, as there are many elements and components involved
which interact with and mutually impact each other. Such
interactions may be circular, are not easy to capture, so the
results of actions and decisions are not immediately obvious
or measurable. For example, there will be a delay between
when hospital expansion is recognized as being necessary to
satisfy increased demand and when the expanded hospital is
fully functioning, and there will be time delays and variations
between when health problems appear and when actions are
taken to restore the system to the desirable state of being able
to meet demand. Such non-linear relationships also make it
hard to forecast the dynamics of healthcare systems accurately,
and complicates decision making processes. For example, the
relationship between length of stay (LOS) and admission
waiting times is non-linear: if a patient is admitted quickly,
it can be expected that his/her medication period will be short
- but if s/he has waited for a long time to be admitted, the
medication time is likely to be signiﬁcantly longer
indeed
the patient’s situation may have worsened considerably while
waiting for medication, especially if they are elderly. These
make the results of policies intended to improve system’s
performance may be disappointing, as they may be subject

to resistance from staff, in particular consultants, and counter-
intuitive behaviour on the part of the policy makers. Simulation
and modelling can be an effective and ﬂexible tool to apply
with several of these concerns and so contribute towards
improved health system performance and better health care
provision [25].
In most recent studies of simulation an modelling, discrete
event simulation (DES) has been the most widely used in
many applications. The system’s functions are modelled as
a ﬁnite-state machine in which transitions occur based on
events [26, 27]. DES system modelling can be viewed as a
queuing network: individual entities (here, patients) go through
a process (a consecutive series of activities), each of which
may have a queue of other entities waiting to be processed.
Individual entities have attributes that reﬂect their particular
characteristics and which determine what happens to them
during their journey through the system. The selection of
probability distributions is subject to the modeller’s decisions,
historical data, literatures and the nature of the particular
problem being modelled. Traditionally, DES models were
applied to deal with details, process, decision rules, queues
and scheduling activities at both operational and tactical levels.
Such models require large amounts of quantitative numerical
data, and their intrinsic stochastic nature means they need
extensive statistical analysis and design experiments. The main
objective of these models is performance prediction, compar-
ison of scenarios and optimizing performance measurement
with accompanying optimization algorithms [28, 29].
Healthcare administrators can beneﬁt from DES to assess
current settings and in predicting changes in performance after
proposed operational changes. DES models can be effective
tools to deal with hospital problem areas, like operating
theatres and emergency departments, where healthcare demand
will be variable but resources are likely to be limited [30,
31], and to identify possible areas of improvement that could
be achieved via reorganization and re-allocation of existing
resources [32, 33]. Many studies have discussed the suitability
of DES for modelling healthcare processes in detail [27, 34-
37], and they used them to examine outpatient clinics [38,
39], planning for healthcare services [40, 41]; ambulance
scheduling [42]; and improving capacity utilization in intensive
care units [43]. A previous study has used a stochastic sim-
ulation model for bed occupancy[44], and other applications
have included settings - such as emergency departments [25,
45-47], operating theatres [48]; and pre-operative process
[49] - in which resources are scarce and patients arrive at
irregular times, where modelling can facilitate the effective
evaluation and testing of the outcomes of various alternatives
and interventions [39]. The dynamic capabilities of simulation
can allow a more accurate interpretation of the utilization of
hospital resources to be envisaged [50], supporting hospital
managers’ decisions on bed usage and patient ﬂow through
the hospital [51] by modelling problems of patient ﬂows
[52], and then using scenarios to illustrate the consequences
of possible suggested solutions by hospital management on
performance[53].

PROBLEM CONTEXTUALIZATION
A. Background
Elderly patients are usually deﬁned as those who are aged
65 and older and this study adheres to that convention [54].
The most challenging elderly patients are those referred to as
frail - as suffering from an array of medical conditions that
individually may be curable, but collectively create complex
and potentially overwhelming burdens of disease [2]. Frail
patients constitute 18 − 20% of the Irish elderly population
and usually require longer treatment in the healthcare facilities,
followed by rehabilitation and/or community care. In terms
of length of stay (LOS), frail patients are characterized in
this study as those needing treatment in acute systems (i.e.,
hospitals) for more than 15 days: The remaining 80 − 82%
of elderly patients (who receive shorter treatment periods)
are referred to as non-frail. While this study focused initially
just on frail patients, since all 65+ patients use the same
healthcare system resources, it was found necessary to widen
the project’s scope to encompass all elderly patients, both frail
and non-frail. Although elderly patients utilize a wide range of
resources, the initial phase of the proposed model gives special
attention to bed capacity in healthcare facilities based on a
request from healthcare executives: thus elderly care services
that do not involve admissions - such as outpatient clinics - are
excluded from the model because they do not affect hospital
bed utilization.
B. Conceptualization
Elderly patients’ journeys through hospital systems usually
begin with their arrival at ED by ambulance, walk-in or
following a referral by a General Practitioner (GP). After
admission, elderly patients receive treatment in acute beds until
they are assigned care pathways according to their diagnosis
and frailty level. The duration of treatment ranges from few
days to two weeks for non-frail patients, but usually exceeds
45 days for frail patients. After their stay in acute beds, elderly
patients are discharged to one of the following destinations:
•
Another Hospital: Certain medical procedures may re-
quire equipment that is unavailable in the acute hospital
where an elderly patient has been admitted, and they
need to be transferred to another hospital where the
technology required for the procedure they need is
available. Discharge ﬁgures to another hospital (6% of
all elderly patients) include patients who are moved to
undergo certain procedures, and those who are returned
to their original hospital after such procedures
•
Rehabilitation: Patients whose are deemed ‘frail’, but
who are judged as having the potential to improve
towards functional independence are discharged to an
on- or off-site facility where they receive rehabilitation.
Such facilities can be seen as intermediate destinations
suitable to the situation where they are no longer cat-
egorized as acutely ill, but still need close medical
observation in the hope that they will recover [55].
After rehabilitation, the majority of patients (80%) are
discharged home, and the remaining 20%, who have not
recovered, to long term care.

•
Convalescence: Around 10% of non-frail patients are
discharged to a convalescent care facility for a short
stay to recover from a medical procedure. Convales-
cence offers less intensive care than rehabilitation, as it
essentially prepares patients to go home, and may take
place within dedicated short stay beds in nursing home
facilities.
•
Long Term Care (LTC): More than a quarter of frail
elderly patients will be unable to live alone at their
homes as they are unable to care for themselves, and
may require ongoing medical supervision. Such patients
are discharged to a public or private nursing home to
receive LTC, where they usually stay for years until they
die. This prolonged stay in nursing homes hampers the
supply of LTC beds in the healthcare system, and can
result in waiting times that amount to several months.
In addition to hospital demand, there is also a demand
from frail patients in the community who need LTC, and
must wait in their homes for a nursing home place.
•
Home: The vast majority of non-frail elderly patients -
88.9% in all - are eventually discharged to their homes,
whether directly or after a short stay in convalescence.
24% of frail patients are discharged directly to their
homes, and another 28.8% go home after a period of
rehabilitation. More than half of them will continue
to require medical care in their own homes, and are
given Home Care Packages (HCP), which comprise a set
of state-provided services that may include home help,
nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and other
services [5].
•
Other Destinations: In addition to these destinations, 6%
of elderly patients are likely to die during their acute
stay, with the probability of mortality increasing pro-
portionally with the frailty level, while another minimal
number of patients (slightly more than 1%) with special
conditions are discharged to ‘other’ destinations (e.g.,
prisons, psychiatric facilities, etc).
Elderly patients’ alternative care pathways and their required
bed resources are illustrated in Fig.
2, and the percentages
of patients discharged to each destination listed in Table
I.
However, shortages of LTC and HCP bed or service capacities
may be the main reasons behind delayed discharges from acute
hospitals. Elderly patients can often occupy acute beds for
extended LOS, that exceed their treatment periods, not because
they continue to require acute health services, but because they
are waiting to be discharged [56].
C. Data Collection
The overall aim of this project is to develop a simulation
model to address the problem of the delayed discharge of
elderly patients in Ireland. Interviews and observations are
qualitative, which is of a great beneﬁt in understanding and
modelling work ﬂows in the healthcare facility. Data quality
and precision determines the validity of the simulation model,
so the data collection phase represents a critical element of
any simulation project. Historical admission and discharge data
was collected from the Hospital In-Patient Enquiry Scheme
(HIPE), a computer-based system designed to collect demo-
graphic, clinical and administrative data on discharges and
deaths from acute hospitals nationally, while bed capacities and
LOS data were gathered through surveys conducted nationally,
and included valuable information about patients and their care
journeys, such as arrival times, sources and times of admission
and times and destinations of discharge. As in other healthcare
modelling projects, collecting the relevant modelling data
presented considerable challenges [57]. The ﬁrst was the dearth
of data about certain parameters that were not captured by the
HIPE. (It is worth noting that the lack of relevant data caused a
similar project studying care of the elderly in the UK to alter its
objectives from producing quantitative results to only building
a simulation model [55].) The second challenge was that the
data was provided in aggregate ﬁgures e.g., the numbers of
patients discharged to multiple destinations was combined into
a single number, while modelling inputs require such ﬁgures
to be broken down into their individual elements. The third
problem with data in this case was inconsistencies between
different data sources, such as variations in ﬁgures between
hospitals data and annual reports. After numerous extended
meetings with hospital ofﬁcials, the absence of certain data
and lack of information on how to decompose aggregated
ﬁgures were overcome by the use of assumptions based on
the opinions of experts in the ﬁeld [58]. Gaining a deeper
understanding of what each ﬁgure reﬂected revealed that, in
most cases, misunderstandings of terminology or scope were
the reasons behind what seemed to be inconsistencies in the
data available.
Patient information was extricated from the raw data by
data manipulation and reorganization, after which data analysis
was used to extrapolate important inputs for the model, such
as admission and discharge patterns, and to segment frail
patient data. The admission pattern of all elderly patients is
shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3-a shows the daily patients admission
histogram distribution during 2010. More than 75% of days
saw average daily admission rates of between 575 and 675
elderly patients (average 587, standard deviation 88.26). Fig.
3-b presents the monthly demand of patients as a percentage
of the total annual demand, which shows the distribution of
demand across the months is approximately uniform. Although
admission numbers for December are signiﬁcantly lower than
for other months - which may be due to demand decay during
the Christmas holidays - demand levels return to normal in
January.
While these ﬁgures give an overview of the elderly care
demand pattern, it would be inaccurate to think all patients
present the same demand characteristics: elderly patients’
needs and the severity of those needs differ. Accordingly,
it was essential to manipulate different admission patterns
to reﬂect the characteristics and needs of different groups
of patients. Admission data were clustered to group frail
patients into ﬁve categories (coded numerically from 0 − 4)
according to their acute LOS, which representing the degree
of complexity (DOC) of their needs, based on the validated
assumption that the most complex cases spend more time
in hospital. All 65+ patient data was also categorized into
ﬁve clusters by age group. Based on the data analysis and

this segmentation, elderly patients’ degrees of complexity and
age groups were used during simulation to deﬁne their care
pathways through the model. Fig. 4-a shows the percentages of
elderly patients classiﬁed in each degree of complexity: About
82% are classiﬁed as non-frail patients (with zero complexity),
the other 18% are classiﬁed as frail patients with different
degree of complexities. Fig. 4-b shows the different sources
of admission categorized by age group. About 90% of all
elderly patients came directly from home: as the ﬁgure shows,
that percentage decreased as patients got more elderly, sloping
down from 93% of 65 − 69 year-old patients coming from
home to about 84% for the for 85+ age group, which reﬂects
the pattern of their health care demands and emphasizes how
elderly people - in particular frail patients - need more care
and treatment which they cannot be provided with at home.
D. Model Development and Validation
Based on conceptual model development and empirical data
analysis, a comprehensive discrete-event simulation model was
developed, with an input/output MS Excel spreadsheet as a
user-friendly interface - as requested by the executive team.
Simulation model modules were connected in the same way to
the conceptual ﬂow chart, which eased the model construction
phase, with, the top level of the simulation model deﬁning
the overall model structure, and sub-level blocks compris-
ing additional modules with more details. Object-oriented
programming was used to customize pre-deﬁned blocks for
constructing the simulation model. The main entities for the
simulation were elderly patients, each of which was assigned
a set of attributes reﬂecting a mix of characteristics (such as
their degree of complexity and age group) to determine their
discharge destination. Statistical assumptions were included
by using a Poisson distribution for the admission rate and
exponential distributions for service times [56]. These assump-
tions were validated using the Kolmogorov Smirnov test for
goodness of ﬁt with a 95% conﬁdence level. Days were used
as the time unit for all modelling inputs and outputs. The
measured Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were saved onto
a database after each simulation run, and then exported in
tabular form for further analysis and validation.
To reduce the model development cycle time and to increase
the conﬁdence in the simulation model’s results, veriﬁcation
and validation were carried out throughout the development
phase to conﬁrm the model represented actual patient ﬂows
[57], and to ensure each model development phase aligned with

previously completed phases. The model logic was veriﬁed
to ensure that patients followed the expected care pathways,
by visually tracking patients using animation and by checking
intermediate output values such as queue lengths and waiting
times. Queues at each patient care stage were initially set as
empty and idle, and a three months ‘warm-up’ period used to
mitigate any bias introduced in the simulation model’s initial
conditions until a steady state was achieved. To compare model
results for each scenario with the data provided, we generated
results for one year by running the model for 465 days and
discarding the results for the ﬁrst 100 day which is the warm up
period. Different numbers of runs (i.e., replicates) were tested
and it was found that 10 runs per scenario were sufﬁcient to
obtain unbiased estimators of the expected average of each
KPI. The results of the ‘as-is’ model were validated in two
ways. First, stakeholder validation was completed by meeting
executives and presenting the simulation model ﬁnal results
to them, and second, the model was validated by comparing
simulated ﬁgures with the actual ﬁgures for patients discharge
per age group, per degree of complexity, and per discharge
destination (see Fig. 5). Fig. 5-a compares the percentage of
discharged patients grouped by age for actual ans simulated.
Fig. 5-b compares between simulated and actual percentage
of discharged patient in terms of degree of complexity. While
Fig.
5-c compares between actual and simulated discharge
destinations.
The architecture of the elderly care simulations consists
of three main layers (see Fig.
6). Firstly, the simulation
model layer, which represents the system structure and logic.
The simulation model reﬂects the interactions between system
entities (patients) and different types of resources by creating a
network of processes and represents what happens to patients
after their admission (patient’s pathway). Animated interfaces
were provided to the model’s users, which are particularly
useful for end users who need to see the dynamics of the
problem and its impact. The second layer is the input output
layer, which uses Excel as an external database for input and
output variables, to simplify and automate user interaction
and policy testing. It enables model users to test different
policies related to capacities (i.e., Acute Beds, Rehab Beds,
Transitional Beds,...), to see the effects of changes in demand
under different scenarios on performance measures, and to
quantify the effects of changes in model parameters (i.e., av-
erage LOS, Discharge percentages,...) on overall performance.

At the start of a simulation run, the model reads input variables
from the input data ﬁles and stores them in its embedded
database in order to speed up the run. At each time step,
the simulation model writes the output variables (Queues,
resources, and entities related information) to its embedded
database, and then to Excel output ﬁle for further analysis.
After the simulation runs are completed, the Excel output ﬁles
store output datasets which reﬂect what happened during the
simulation. These datasets need to be analyzed to generate
informative reports to the users (the decision makers), which
necessitates a mechanism for displaying the relevant output
information. MS Excel report generation layer (third layer) is
used to analyze the output datasets automatically, and generate
reports that include statistical summaries, analysis and ﬁgures
which simplify the output presentation for the end users.
E. Delayed Discharge
Table II presents the reasons for delays in the discharge of
elderly patients, and shows that about half of them were wait-
ing to get rehabilitation beds and the other half for long term
care beds. On average about 2, 258 elder patients occupied
about 314, 711 acute bed days while waiting for rehabilitation
care, which represented about 50% of total acute bed days
occupied and 17.24% of the total annual acute bed capacity.
Their mean waiting time for rehabilitation care was 139 days.
Similarly, about 2, 720 elderly patients occupied 317, 928 extra
acute bed days inappropriately (waiting about 118 on average)
whilst waiting for long term care (LTC) accommodation. These
delays affected both the cost of running health services and
patients’ wellbeing negatively [10, 59, 60]. Overall, about one-
third of the total annual capacity of acute beds was occupied
inappropriately by elderly patients, whose need for acute beds
had ended and who were ready to be discharged. This depletion
of about one-third of the annual acute bed capacity highlights
how delays in discharge is a signiﬁcant problem for acute
hospitals: difﬁculties in accessing rehabilitation facilities or
long term care services were the main factors for these high
discharge rate delays.

SCENARIOS
Hospital executives proposed a number of strategies to the
project team to improve patient ﬂow: this section examines
these scenarios and considers the key performance metrics
involved.

A. Key Performance Indicators
Although the model produced a portfolio of results, the
following KPIs that focus on acute hospital measures were
selected:
•
Acute waiting time: the average time spent by patients
waiting for admission to an acute hospital.
•
Acute access: the ratio of admitted elderly patients to
the overall demand for admission.
•
Average cost per patient: this cost perspective was added
to the model to reﬂect ﬁnancial effects of different
scenarios. The average cost per patient was calculated
by dividing total cost incurred through bed usage by
the total number of discharged patients. Due to data
conﬁdentiality, the results reported for each scenario in
this paper have been anonymized by normalization, i.e.,
setting the current ‘as-is’ values at one and reporting
scenario results as percentages relative to those ﬁgures.
•
Throughput rate: the total number of elderly patients
discharged per year
B. Shorter Acute LOS for Frail Patients Scenario
One of the ﬁrst strategies the management team proposed to
improve patient ﬂow was to set a target for how long maximum
acute LOS for frail elderly patients - whose current average
LOS exceeds 45 days - should stay in acute hospital beds.
Where this length was exceeded, hospitals would be instructed
to make earlier decisions about an elderly patient’s medical
needs and degree of frailty to accelerate their discharge from
hospital. A scenario was tested assuming that frail elderly
patients would have a maximum acute LOS of 18 days (only
slightly longer than the average for non-frail patients).
The results of testing this scenario (presented in the Fig.
7-a) show some improvement in patient ﬂow. Throughput rate
and acute access are increased by 6% and 8% respectively,
while acute waiting time and cost/patient decrease by similar
percentages. It is likely that performance improvements in
this scenario would be somewhat limited, since frail patients
whose LOS currently exceeds 18 days constitute 54% of all
frail patients, but only 10% of the entire elderly population,
so reducing this duration would not have a major impact on
the efﬁciency of the system globally. Despite their interest
in testing this scenario, healthcare policy makers foresaw its
drawbacks. The dependence of acute LOS on patient diag-
nosis and the medical procedures required could hamper the
implementation of a maximum LOS policy, and might face
resistance from medical staff. Hence, other more effective and
pertinent solutions needed to be sought.

C. Intermediate Care Scenario
The second strategy proposed was the introduction of a
new service similar to the Intermediate Care initiative in the
UK that could serve patients who were only using acute or
rehabilitation beds for prolonged periods because they were
awaiting discharge to LTC [55]. Intermediate care beds would
be mostly located offsite in what would be a ‘transitional’
venue, where frail elderly patients could spend time before
being assigned a place in a long term facility. Intermediate
Care option can contribute signiﬁcantly to the efﬁcacy of
acute healthcare services by reducing unnecessary acute care
admissions and assisting the more timely discharge from acute
care beds, which could yield signiﬁcant cost savings, as the
costs of intermediate care beds are estimated to only about half
those of acute beds. To assess the impact of this service on
the elderly care system, different alternatives of this scenario
were examined using the simulation model developed for this
study, with each experiment using different intermediate care
beds capacities. These alternatives were based on a gradient
increase in intermediate care beds in proportion to a static
number of acute beds in the system, starting with 5% of the
acute bed capacity and increasing in subsequent versions to
20%.
Introducing intermediate care beds appears to have an
overall positive effect on patient ﬂow by noticeably increasing
throughput rate and acute access by factors of up to 2.5, while
reducing acute waiting times and costs/patient by up to 50%
of the current ﬁgures (as Fig. 7-b shows). Intermediate care
beds can reduce waiting times for both acute and rehabilitation
admissions because they accelerate the release of acute and
rehabilitation beds back into the system, so more beds are
available to meet the incoming demand. Despite the fact that
intermediate care would be the last stage that precedes LTC, it
is observed that it has almost no effect on LTC waiting time.
This was not unexpected, as LTC waiting time is constrained
by LTC bed supply, regardless of where elderly patients are
while they await LTC placement.
D. Design of Experiments and ANOVA
In addition to evaluating these two scenarios, healthcare
executives were interested in trying to gain insights into the dy-
namics of the elderly care system, and also to identify the most
signiﬁcant factors affecting its overall performance. Using an
orthogonal array (L27) a factorial design of experiment was
conducted [61, 62]. three The Taguchi method uses orthogonal
array from the design of experiments theory to study a large
number of variables with a small number of experiments. The
L27 design allows for testing up to 13 factors at each of three
levels: high (3), medium (2) and low (1) (H − M − L). Six
selected factors were tested and the values for H − M − L
levels were determined based on the current ﬁgures (with
one of the three levels set as the ‘as-is’ value. Twenty-seven
experiments were carried out based on the selected orthogonal
array, with the system’s throughput rate, acute access rate, and
acute waiting time as the responses (i.e., outputs) measured in
each experiment, as healthcare executives recommended. L27
design for mixed factors was selected and analysed to develop
the experimental matrix in Table III . This was followed by a
two-way Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA) test to determine the
signiﬁcance of the six selected factors: Number of acute beds,
number of rehabilitation beds, number of LTC beds, Acute
care average LOS, rehabilitation average LOS, percentage of
rehabilitation patients, and their interactions. The main and
interaction effects of the studied factors were analysed using
95% conﬁdence interval (Table IV). The main effect analysis
is conducted by changing one single factor at a time while
all other parameters are ﬁxed, whereas the interaction effect
is based on changing two or more factors and examine their
impacts on the KPIs.
The ANOVA results showed that the number of acute bed,
rehabilitation average LOS, and percentage of rehabilitation
patients were the signiﬁcant factors that inﬂuenced all KPIs
with (P − value < 0.05), while acute average LOS has a
signiﬁcant impact on the acute average waiting time. It is
interesting to note that LTC bed capacity has no effect on
any of the KPIs at 5% signiﬁcance level. This is due to the

average LOS in LTC beds is huge (long term) and the impacts
of LTC bed capacity expansion appears on long term witch not
reﬂected in this model. Furthermore,These results illustrate that
the acute beds and rehabilitation service represent bottlenecks
in healthcare systems that impact on patient ﬂows, and hence
negatively affect the whole healthcare process. Interaction be-
tween Rehabilitation average LOS (E)and % of Rehabilitation
patients (F) have a signiﬁcant impact on both acute access are
and acute waiting time. This is due to that factor (F) controls
the inﬂow to rehabilitation service (Demand), while factor (E)
controls the outﬂow (discharge) from rehabilitation service.
Additionally, the interactions of these factor (E and F) with all
other factors show signiﬁcant inﬂuences on the acute waiting
time. To determine the relationships between main factors
and KPIs, and to quantify their impacts magnitude, multiple
regression analysis was applied to the signiﬁcant factors for
each KPI individually.
E. Regression analysis
An investigation off all signiﬁcant factors against the KPIs
(responses) was conducted to determine if the relationships
were curvilinear or not, so as to determine the appropriate
mathematical transformation, but found all the relationships
were linear. Hence multiple linear regression analysis was used
to explore the causality relationships between factors and KPIs,
and also tested and validated all the regression model assump-
tions. Table V presents the summary results of the regression
analysis for the three KPIs against their main signiﬁcant factors
at 95% conﬁdence level - all three regression models were
signiﬁcant with P −value < 0.00001 and all individual factors
were also signiﬁcant. The regression models were investigated
explicitly for assumptions of homoscedasticity, independence,
linearity, and normality. The residuals - the residuals between
actual and ﬁtted values -, were used to test model assumptions,
and any outliers investigated and tested using Cook’s distance
statistics.
F. Discussion
The regression analysis for throughput rate revealed that
acute and rehabilitation bed capacities positively affected the
throughput rate, while rehabilitation average LOS and per-
centage of rehabilitation patients were inversely proportionate
to the throughput rate. Thus, increasing numbers of either
type of bed improved the throughput rate: increasing acute
capacity directly increased numbers of patients who could
be admitted , provided beds were available at the discharge
destinations
and the provision of more rehabilitation beds
increased the rate of discharge from acute care beds, again
improving the throughput rate. On the other hand, increasing
average LOS on the rehabilitation care service reduced admis-
sions to rehabilitation care, and thus the discharge rate from

rehabilitation care, so negatively affecting the throughput rate.
Also, increasing percentage of patients discharged from acute
care to rehabilitation increased demand on the rehabilitation
service, which could increase its waiting lists, so reducing the
rate of discharge from - and thus the rate of admission to
- acute care, again, eventually, reducing the whole systems
throughput rate. These signiﬁcant factors explained the 78.8%
of the system’s throughput variations: Fig.
8-a reveals their
effects.
The regression analysis for acute waiting times showed that
72.4% of its variations can be explained by acute bed capacity,
rehabilitation average LOS, and percentage of rehabilitation
patients. Normally, acute waiting times decrease as the acute
bed capacity increases - this relationship is clearly straight-
forward. The provision of acute care beds increases acute
care admission rates, reducing waiting lists and waiting times.
Conversely, average waiting times for acute care admission are
directly proportionate to both rehabilitation average LOS and
percentage of rehabilitation patients. But increasing rehabilita-
tion average LOS hinders the acceptance of new patients who
are discharged from acute beds for rehabilitation care - so,
the rehabilitation care waiting list increases and those patients
stay in hospital consuming acute bed resources, so increasing
both the acute bed waiting lists and average times. Likewise,
increasing the percentage of acute care patients discharged
to rehabilitation care increases rehabilitation waiting lists and
times - as rehabilitation beds are limited - directly magnifying
acute care average LOS, reducing acute care admission rates
and lengthening average acute care waiting times. Fig.
8-b
illustrates the effect of these factors on average acute waiting
times.

inﬂuence of both acute and rehabilitation bed numbers on acute
access rates are positive, but the inﬂuence of both rehabilitation
average LOS and the percentage of rehabilitation patients are
negative. We found that factors affecting throughput rates were
the same as those effecting acute access rates, and that their
inﬂuences had the same sign. The explanation behind this is
that acute access rate is the ratio of admitted elderly patients
to the demand for acute care admission
thus ratio of acute
care out to acute care in
in other words, it is a deﬁnition
of acute care throughput rate. The overall system’s throughput
rate is positively and highly related to the throughput rates of
all its subsystems but, as the acute care subsystem is the core
subsystem in an acute hospital (and as many elderly patients
encounter it) its throughput rate is likely to signiﬁcantly
determine that of the whole system - and certainly, they are
highly and positively correlated.
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
the mounting demand for elderly healthcare services driven
by increasing population ageing is confronting Irish healthcare
executives with critical capacity planning challenges. Devel-
oping a simulation model to investigate service constraints
in healthcare systems was found to be an approach that was
well-suited to provide decision makers with a tool to evaluate
their proposed strategies. Conceptual modelling was used to
illustrate different elderly patient care pathways and improve
understanding of the resources required during their care
journeys. This phase was followed by developing a discrete-
event simulation model with the object of investigating the
impact of demand uncertainty on available capacity, which was
of great beneﬁt to policy makers in forecasting the outcomes of
potential strategies they wanted to investigate. The reduction of
average length of stay of patients using acute beds in hospitals,
if possible, only promised minor improvements in patient
ﬂows, but results showed that introducing intermediate care
beds could enhance the system’s performance signiﬁcantly,
reducing delays and the cost of patient stays by almost 50%.
The model we developed also had the potential to examine
the economic feasibility of implementing this intermediate
bed solution fully, based on a cost-beneﬁt analysis, as well
as testing other scenarios the policy makers proposed. An
ANOVA statistical analysis revealed that the rehabilitation
stage was a bottleneck that affected onward patient ﬂows,
so it could be concluded that efforts to improve the ﬂow
of elderly patients through the healthcare system should be
directed more towards rehabilitation than to other stages of the
patient treatment journey, and it is strongly recommended that
future research should study the impact of the rehabilitation
stage and its capacity on overall patient throughput. Potential
strategies that might be considered include setting a maximum
rehabilitation LOS and transferring a number of acute beds to
used for rehabilitation.
It is worth emphasizing that the main challenge in this
study was the data collection phase. Problems varied between
irrelevant or insufﬁcient data and issues of data accuracy, and
assumptions made by healthcare experts had to be used to
overcome the lack of data in several instances. Comprehensive
and periodic collection of elderly patient data is strongly rec-
ommended to provide decision makers with a solid foundation
to use for process improvement strategies. Another limitation
was that a detailed real cost analysis was not possible in this
study phase due to two main reasons; (1) lack of cost related
information and, (2) the high variability of cost models used in
Irish public hospitals, which created a high level of complexity.
A further problem is that one of this model’s limitations is
that it assumes demand is static (due to data availability),
although this can be overcome by considering it through a
dynamic module designed to deal with demographic changes,
or via sensitivity analysis. A project recently launched by 3S
group will attempt to create a ﬁnancial model for Irish public
hospitals in order to facilitate better cost analysis of decisions.
