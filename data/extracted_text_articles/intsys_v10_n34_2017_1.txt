Abstract—Major incidents can disturb the state of balance of a
society and it is important to increase the resilience of the society
against such disturbances. There are different causes for major
incidents, one of which are groups of individuals, for example
at demonstrations. The ideal way to handle such events would
be to prevent them, or at least provide information to ensure
the appropriate security services are prepared. Nowadays, a lot
of communication, even criminal, takes place in social networks,
which, hence, provide the ideal ground to gain the necessary
information, by monitoring such groups. In the present paper,
we propose an application framework for knowledge-based social
network monitoring. The ultimate goal is the prediction of short-
term activities, as well as the long-term development of potentially
dangerous groups, based on sentiment and topic analysis and the
identiﬁcation of opinion-leaders. Here, we present the ﬁrst steps
to reach this goal, which include the assessment of the risk for
a major incident caused by a group of individuals based on the
sentiment in the social network groups and the topics discussed.

I.
INTRODUCTION
The representation and communication of individuals, com-
panies and organizations, using the Internet, especially social
networks, has become the standard in our society. Even though
social networks are successful and have progressed throughout
these past years, they have also contributed to the formation of
new criminal energy. As already mentioned in [1], in particular,
the provision of an infrastructure for rapid communication
and the possibility to exchange ideas, pictures etc. in private
and protected environments, which are difﬁcult to control by
investigators - if at all - enables radical or extreme political
groups, criminal gangs or terrorist organizations to use Social
Networks as a tool to plan, appoint and execute criminal
offenses. These groups often use large-scale events with a
high degree of group dynamics to promote their ideas. Events,
such as sporting events, demonstrations or festivals, cause high
expenses on security personnel. The inherent group dynamics
cause a great uncertainty and unpredictability concerning the
development of such events and make it difﬁcult to estimate
how much security personnel is needed. For example, in
2014 the police ofﬁcers spent more than two million working
hours just on securing soccer games in Germany [2]. Tar-
geted and automated monitoring of social networks, taking
into account the applicable legal provisions, can particularly
support strategic security planning as well as the development
of effective prevention strategies. As a positive side effect,
the subjective sense of security of the users is strengthened.
Authorities of the federal ofﬁce for the protection of the
constitution, as well as intelligence services, are aware of
the importance of social networks as a source for important
information and increasingly focus on extracting and analyzing
this information. However, at this point the extraction and
evaluation of the information is done manually. Taking into
account the increasing number of users worldwide – currently,
for example, approximately 40 % of the population worldwide
uses social networks – it has to be noticed that there is an
enormous amount of potential proﬁles or communication to
be monitored. This demonstrates the need for an automated
solution that is capable of handling this amount of data and
the resulting complexity.
Consequently, the design of an application framework,
namely Social Network Analyzer (SoNA), for monitoring
groups and organizations in Social Networks as key elements
of critical events is presented to assist decision-makers. A
prototype implementing parts of this framework for monitoring
publicly accessible Facebook data is discussed.
The paper is segmented in six sections. The ﬁrst two
sections following the introduction discuss the concept of
predictive policing as well as give a short overview about the
language characteristics in Social Networks. These sections
are followed by an outline of the framework, which is still
under development, including how the dangerous militant
proﬁles can be selected, how the risk of an event can be
assessed and the opinion-leaders can be identiﬁed. In Section
V, a prototypical implementation including its architecture and
currently available features is presented. Finally, the paper ends
with a conclusion, also discussing the progress of the work and
its future development.

PREDICTIVE POLICING AS A TOOL FOR RESILIENCE
ENGINEERING
A major incident includes a great number of casualties
and/or severe property damage [3]. At large-scale events, such

as described above, there is always a possibility for a major
catastrophic event to happen. However, whether or not it will
happen is usually difﬁcult to predict. Resilience is the ability
of a socio-ecological system to recover from disturbances, for
example a major catastrophic event, and retain or regain its
identity, functions, structures and its ability to respond [4]. In
a study about resilience the German Academy of Technical
Sciences (acatech) developed a resilience cycle based on the
Social Resilience Cycle by Edwards [5], which includes the
following ﬁve stages: prepare, prevent, protect, respond and
recover [6]. In order to return quickly to the deﬁned secure
state of balance [7] it becomes necessary to apply resilience
engineering [8] in the sense of a technical support system,
which allows to anticipate the disaster situation [6]. Crime
that arises from dynamic groups at large-scale events as well
as organized and especially political motivated crime regularly
disturb the state of balance. Information gained from moni-
toring activities of such groups in the Internet and especially
Social Networks can be used to predict the probability of
such catastrophic events beforehand. Accordingly, the National
Institute of Justice in the USA deﬁned Predictive Policing as
follows:
“Predictive policing, in essence, is taking data
from disparate sources, analyzing them and then
using the results to anticipate, prevent and respond
more effectively to future crime.” [9]
The knowledge gained from the monitoring of suspicious
groups in Social Networks directly contributes to an increase in
resilience in the stages Prepare and Prevent of the resilience
cycle [5] [10]. Therefore, the development of an automated
solution to monitor Social Networks is an important step of
resilience engineering.
III.
CHARACTERISTICS OF SOCIAL MEDIA LANGUAGE
While the language used in chat rooms is one of the most
researched topics [11], language used on the social media
site Facebook seems to be one of the least researched, which
is evident in the small amount of literature covering that
topic [12]. Zappavigna [12] suggests that one reason might
be the combination of several genres on one social media
site, making the analysis very complex. Even though it is
impossible to generalize the language found on the Internet
[11], studies about language use for example in chat rooms
or on microblogging sites, combined with the scarce literature
covering some linguistic aspects on Facebook gave a starting
point for an analysis. The focus of this paper is on posts and
comments and, therefore, excludes messages written on the
instant messenger.
In order to get a ﬁrst impression of the language used
in Facebook groups, a small corpus was created using posts
and comments from different Facebook groups, relevant to
the application of SoNA (see Table I). The structure of a
“conversation” in a Facebook group is very different to the
structure for example of a chat conversation. The starting point
for a “conversation” on a group wall on Facebook is always a
post, often written by the group itself. Afterwards, users can
write a comment or reply to an already existing comment. In
comparison to a chat conversation the user is not expected to
write a comment immediately after a post was posted or write
a reply to a comment from another user. In fact, they do not
have to reply at all. This leads to the fact that “conversations”
in Facebook groups are not almost-synchronous as in a chat
conversation, yet clearly asynchronous [13] [14]. Therefore, it
might be questioned whether to talk about “conversations” at
all. Nonetheless, whenever users start a discussion on a group
wall and reply to each other’s comments within minutes, these
conversations look very similar to chat messages. Overall,
this “conversation” structure on Facebook leads to a highly
complex way of communication, which makes the analysis of
the language used and the meaning created difﬁcult.
Furthermore, the wall on Facebook allows the users to
include multimodal communication, by posting pictures or
videos, either with a comment or with words included for
example in the picture. Additionally, often posts include ref-
erences to other websites or users simply repost a post from
someone else. Another aspect that makes the automated anal-
ysis of meaning difﬁcult is the language itself. Characteristics
taken from studies on other Internet-based communication
were used as features in an annotation with the UAM corpus
tool of the small corpus mentioned above [11] [15] [16]
[17] [18]. The results show clearly that there seems to be a
difference between posts and comments. For example, orality,
especially colloquial language, typing errors and lower case
spelling of nouns seem to be more common in comments. In
comparison, hashtags seemed to be used more often in posts
than in comments. Furthermore, comments and posts can be
distinguished by their length. While the length of posts varies
between zero words (e. g., pictures) up to 892 words, the length
of comments varies from 1 word up to 92 words. Moreover,
these numbers show that in comments one can often ﬁnd
incomplete sentences. Even though, it seems that the typical
features found in chat conversations are not used as often in
comments and posts on Facebook, they are still present and
create a challenge for the automated analysis used in SoNA.
Especially, emoticons make the analysis of meaning difﬁcult,
because the way in which they are used to create meaning is
complex and they can also be used to create irony [19]. This
is why, so far, the sentiment analysis used in SoNA is based
on word and not sentence level.

OUTLINE OF A FRAMEWORK
The analysis of social networks from the point of view of
security policy pursues two main objectives. The ﬁrst one is
the identiﬁcation and estimation of potential dangers, including
their scope and location. The second one is to enable security
forces to plan in the long-term. In order to do so, it is of
special interest how a group is developing in terms of their
size growth, their orientation or radicalization and the increase

in their propensity to violence. This section discusses basic
concepts of a framework that addresses these tasks.
The proposed framework allows decision-makers of secu-
rity forces, for example in the police’s management and control
centers, to identify and predict areas with high levels of crime.
As a result, it is possible to deploy forces more efﬁciently
depending on the speciﬁc situation. Thus, if, for example
during a debate about the policy regarding refugees on publicly
accessible pages of a social network, users loudly advocate
arson attacks on refugee homes, decision-makers can now put
security forces and specialized investigators on standby. If, on
the other hand, before a soccer games, violent fans or fans in
general do not seem to plan any riots, it may be sufﬁcient to
return to the minimum number of necessary staff to secure the
event.
Another goal is to predict the long-term development of
potentially violent groups. Such a prediction may include state-
ments about the expected development of their membership,
but also evidence of a possible increase in radicalization in the
future. With this information, executives will be able to plan
resources and make infrastructural decisions in the long term.
If, for example, a district becomes, in the future, a point of
attack for various, growing and violent political groups, due
to certain circumstances, this information could lead to the
construction of an additional police station or the expansion of
the forces of an existing one. The development of a framework
for the automated analysis of data from social networks with
the aim of more effective crime prevention and defense in the
long and short term, makes it an application from the ﬁeld of
predictive policing as deﬁned in Section II.
In particular, the following tasks must be addressed by the
framework:
1)
selection of potential proﬁles of dangerous militants,
2)
assessment of the probability that the danger occurs,
3)
determination of location and time of risks.
In order to meet the special needs and challenges of
forensics, especially with regard to the dynamics of language in
social networks, it is necessary to resort to expert knowledge.
This knowledge can be represented in the form of a Forensic
Topic Map (FoTM) as explained in detail in [20]. In particular,
abstract threats are modeled here, which form the basis for
the assessment and evaluation of the communication content.
Figure 1 shows the entire process chain for the proposed frame-
work. All process steps except for the long-term prediction,
which will be covered in future work, are explained in more
detail in the following subsections.
A. Selection of dangerous militants proﬁles
The selection of so-called dangerous militants proﬁles
ensures that proﬁles are not arbitrary selected and is thus es-
sential to the observance of data privacy protection regulations.
Furthermore, it focuses the monitoring on those proﬁles and
thus regulates the limitation of the analysis effort. Even though
the monitoring is limited to public proﬁles, and therefore all
information publicly available, it is important not to violate
the individual feeling of freedom, especially the freedom of
speech as regulated in the legal framework of the respective
legislature. The concept of the potential attacker was deﬁned
by a German working group, consisting of the heads from

150

the State Ofﬁces of criminal investigations and the Federal
Criminal Police Ofﬁce, for the scope of German law as
follows:
“A dangerous militant is a person in whom
certain facts justify the assumption that they will
commit politically motivated offenses of consider-
able importance...” [21, translated by H. S.]
The extent to which this deﬁnition can be extended to
other areas of organized crime and gangs, without a political
motivation, remains to be legally clariﬁed. Based on that
concept, a dangerous militant proﬁle can now be deﬁned as
follows:
A dangerous militant proﬁle is the proﬁle of a
dangerous militant in a social network. All proﬁles
associated with this proﬁle are part of the extended
dangerous militant proﬁle.
Traditionally, the selection of proﬁles to be monitored
has been carried out manually. Appropriate candidates are
selected, for example through research on the Internet or other
investigations. In this way, however, new or short-term proﬁles
are hardly detected. Here, automated approaches can help in
the long-term.
For example, the task of automatically identifying a danger-
ous militant proﬁle, associated with a certain crime area, given
a group of proﬁles can be interpreted as a classiﬁcation task.
Let P be the set of all proﬁles of a particular social network,
and R the set of risk classes, corresponding to an area of crime.
Then the selection of potential militants proﬁles is a surjective
mapping f : R → P. An overview of classiﬁcation techniques
(supervised learning methods) is given, for example, in [22]
[23]. However, as already emphasized by [24], a large amount
of training data is needed to train classiﬁers with sufﬁcient
accuracy. This problem can be addressed, for example, by
the use of semi-supervised learning methods, such as self-
training or co-training. An overview of methods is described,
e. g., in [25]. Whichever method is chosen, the performance
depends on the choice of appropriate features. These should
generally have sufﬁcient discrimination power and should be
as independent as possible.
Particularly in the context of social networks, the use of
techniques for recommender machines is often used (push-
mode) instead of classiﬁcation (pull mode). Typically, such
systems use Collaborative Filtering [26] [27], Content-based
Filtering [28] [27], or a combination of both. In recent years,
a whole series of studies have been devoted to the creation of
friendships in social networks using these classic approaches
[29] [30]. More recent approaches are based on social graphs
[31] [32] or semantic analyzes, especially LDA, which attempt
to produce recommendations based on lifestyles [33] [34]
[35] [36]. However, the inclusion of structured data is more
reliable than the analysis of latent topics and is therefore
more suitable for classifying threats. Naruchitparames et al.
presented a recommender system based on genetic algorithms
[37]. As a feature (social genome), they propose the following
Facebook feature:
•
common friends,
•
location,
•
age range,
•
common interests (likes and music),
•
photo tags,
•
events,
•
groups,
•
movies,
•
education,
•
religious and political attitude.
Manca et al. criticize earlier approaches because they do
not take into account a mutual interest which is, however,
necessary for friendship. They suggest a similarity-based rec-
ommender as a basis for friendships using so-called Social
Bookmarks, i. e., shared bookmarks on the Internet [38]. Tags
of shared images are the basis for the recommender system
proposed by Cheung et al. and are another interesting feature to
generate recommendations in social networks [39]. In a similar
manner, a general classiﬁer can be trained based on the proﬁles
of known dangerous militants or offenders. For example,
by means of corresponding known proﬁles, a classiﬁer or a
recommendation system could be implemented for detecting
proﬁles of the hooligan scene or radical political groupings.
Adapting this approach, a classiﬁer can be trained in the
sense of supervised learning, which can automatically detect
such dangerous militants proﬁles. We can use a social feature
vector ⃗f s for each proﬁle (see Equation (1)) as a basis for the
computational task of the classiﬁcation and recommendation
of dangerous militants.
⃗f s =





friends
location
age
interests
· · ·





(1)
Considering this as a binary classiﬁcation task, we need
to assign each proﬁle ⃗f s either to the class of potential dan-
gerous militants proﬁles or not. Assuming the features f s
i are
independent, we can use the Bayes theorem for computation
(see 2).
ˆy = arg max
ci∈{0,1} p(ci)
|⃗f s|
Y
j=0
p(f s
j |ci)
(2)
Although we know that this assumption is not true, experi-
ences have shown that this approach still produces good results
[40]. In general, supervised approaches need a sufﬁciently
large set of training examples which is a problem in many
cases. To overcome this, we can use a bootstrapping approach,
as shown in [41].
B. Assessment of the risk of dangers
After the potential dangerous militants proﬁles have been
selected, the content analysis of the communication takes

place. This step is necessary to determine whether the extrac-
tion of further information is necessary to elucidate various
modalities (location, time, participants, etc.) of possible events.
A prerequisite for the assessment of the probability that the
danger occurs is once again the experience-based knowledge
of the investigator, which must be available for each individual
risk type, for example, in the FoTM as discussed in [20] [41].
After deﬁning the risk classes risk1, ..., riskn which
should be monitored, the explicit deﬁnition of the corre-
sponding danger topics is made: Θrisk = ϑrisk1, ..., ϑriskn.
A risk class describes the amount of all offenses belong-
ing to a deﬁned group, for example, left or right-winged
politically motivated crimes. A risk topic includes all the
terms and associations that characterize such a risk class.
Afterwards, the selection of potential or known dangerous
militants proﬁles leads to a set of candidate proﬁles for each
risk class P c
i = pi1, ..., pik ∈ P, i = 1, ..., n from the set of
available proﬁles of the investigated social network is carried
out taking into account a particular risk class to limit the
scope of observation and analysis. Subsequently, the topics
Θcom = ϑcom1, ..., ϑcomn of the communication between these
proﬁles must be extracted and it must be then analyzed to what
extend they overlap with the risk topics. Afterwards, they are
evaluated. In the simplest case the overlap can be represented
binarily as shown in Equation (3).
f(Θcom) =
1
if Θcom ∩ Θrisk ̸= ∅
0
otherwise
(3)
In order to quantify the degree of correspondence of Θcom
and Θrisk, a corresponding metric is needed to compare
probability distributions over the terms t of a topic. Niekler
and J¨ahnichen examined the suitability of the Jensen-Shannon
divergence, the cosine similarity, and the dice coefﬁcient as a
measurement of similarity for various topics [42]. As a result,
it was found that the best results were obtained on the basis of
the cosine similarity sim(ϑcom, ϑrisk). Adapted to the present
application, sim(ϑcom, ϑrisk) is thus deﬁned as:
sim(ϑcom, ϑrisk) =
ϑcom · ϑrisk
∥ϑcom∥∥ϑrisk∥
(4)
If f(Θcom) = 1, i. e., ∃ϑcomi|ϑcomi ∈ Θrisk, the analysis
of the sentiment S in the network is carried out. Approaches
are found in the literature, especially for Twitter messages [43]
[44]. In principle, these approaches can also be applied to other
social networks such as Facebook. If the sentiment exceeds a
threshold value ε, an increased risk can be assumed.
To evaluate this hypothesis the communication on the
Facebook page of “Pegida e. V.” (a mostly right-winged or-
ganization in Germany) was analyzed over a period of eight
months, between June 2015 and January 2016. The extracted
textual communication data was divided into individual sen-
tences (tokenization). Subsequently, one out of three polarity
classes pol: positive (+), negative (−) or neutral (0) was
assigned to each sentence s using a probabilistic language
model. Equations (5) and (6) show the associated likelihood
function and the derived scoring function.
log2 P(s, pol) = log2 P(s|pol) + log2 P(pol)
(5)
score(s, pol) = log2 P(s, pol)
|s| + 2
(6)
The polarity class with the highest score is assigned to the
respective sentence. The “Multi-Domain Sentiment Encyclo-
pedia for the German Language”, which was developed at the
Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences, formed the basis for
the training. It contains extracted mood-bearing terms from the
MLSA-A corpus [45], the pressrelations dataset [46], and the

152
International Journal on Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 10 no 3 & 4, year 2017, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/
2017, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
“German Sentiment Vocabulary” (SentiWS) [47], all annotated
with the average polarity values in the range [−1, 1].
The sentiment of a message m = {s1, ..., sn} (post,
comment) is decided in the simplest case by the number
of its positive sentences s+ and/or negative sentences s−.
The sentiment that dominates the constituent sentences also
determines the sentiment of the whole message (see Equation
(7)). In case of equality, the message is considered to be neutral
m0.
S(m) =



m+
if |s+| > |s−|
m−
if |s+| < |s−|
m0
otherwise
(7)
This approach, of course, is only a rough estimate of the
sentiment, since it does not take into account the connection
between meaning (semantic) and sentiment of a sentence.
The accuracy, however, appears sufﬁcient for a ﬁrst check of
the hypothesis, since the messages themselves were ﬁltered
in advance by the topic analysis. The results are presented
in a histogram (see Fig. 2), with only negative messages
(comments) m− being taken into account.
Comparing the development of the sentiment of the com-
ments in the network with the events during this period
(marked by red lines), it was found that there is a possible
correlation between these two. For example, on January 11th,
2016 serious riots lead by the right-winged scene occurred
during the demonstration of the sister organization Legida
e. kV. in Leipzig (Germany). Members in the Pegida network
were also encouraged to attend this event. Similar to most
of the cases, it can be clearly seen that the peak of negative
communication is situated immediately before the incident.
The sudden reduction in conversations at the time of the event
can be explained by the active participation of the members in
the event. The 95%-prediction interval (blue lines) supports the
assumption that incidents mostly occur after a local or global
peak.
Even if this short study is not considered representative and
a random correlation between the occurrence of the incident
and the discussion in the network cannot be ruled out, it still
shows the potential of the presented approach. At this point,
additional long-term studies with larger data sets considering
different networks are necessary.
C. Detection of Leaders and Multipliers
Leaders and multiplier in the context of the intended anal-
ysis of social networks are individuals, who exert a signiﬁcant
amount of inﬂuence on the opinion and sentiment of other
users of the network through their actions. In social sciences
the term ’opinion leader’ was introduced before 1957 by
Katz and Lazarsfeld’s research on diffusion theory [48]. Their
proposed two-step ﬂow model (see Fig. 3) retains validity in
the digital age, especially in the context of social media.
Katz et al. assume that information disseminated in the
Social Network is received, strengthened and enriched by
opinion-leaders Li in their social environment. Since opinion-
leadership is strongly knowledge-driven and thus topic-
dependent, this model must be supplemented by various the-
matically limited opinion-leaders Lϑi. Each individual is then
inﬂuenced by a variety of heterogeneous opinion leaders in his
opinion as illustrated in Fig. 3. This signiﬁes, that the opinion
of an individual is mostly formed by its social environment. In
1962, Rogers references these ideas and deﬁnes opinion leader
as follows:
“Opinion leadership is the degree to which an
individual is able to inﬂuence informally other indi-
viduals’ attitudes or overt behavior in a desired way
with relative frequency.” [49, p. 331]
Social Media

Figure 3: Extended two-step ﬂow model adapted from [48]. In-
formation is spread throughout social media. Individuals with
a high level of competence at strategic local positions receive
and amplify this information according to their competence
(opinion-leader Lϑ1, ..., Lϑ4) and spread it to its followers and
friends. This means, each individual’s opinion is inﬂuenced
by different opinion leaders depending on the topic (different
colors) discussed in the network.
For the present study, the most important question to
answer is what inﬂuence means, or rather how to identify an
opinion leader or how the inﬂuencer can be distinguished from
those being inﬂuenced. Katz deﬁned the following features
[48]:
1)
personiﬁcation of certain values
2)
competence
3)
strategic social location
One approach to identify opinion-leaders is to extract and
analyze the content of nodes and edges of networks to mine
leadership features. For instance, the sentiment of communi-
cation pieces can be analyzed to detect the inﬂuence of their
authors, as shown by Huang et. al., who aim to detect the
most inﬂuential comments in a network this way [50]. Another
strategy is to perform topic mining to categorize content and
detect opinion-leaders for each topic individually, as opinion-
leadership is context-dependent [48] [51]. For this purpose,
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [52] can be used, as seen
in the work of [53]. We considered the implementation of
content-based methods problematic, as texts in social networks
lack correct spelling and formal structure, which impairs such
methods’ performance.
Another approach to identifying leaders is to analyze the
ﬂow of information in a network. By monitoring how the in-
teraction of actors evolves over time, one can identify patterns
and individuals of signiﬁcance within them. To achieve this,
some model of information propagation is required, such as the

Markov processes used by [54] and the probabilistic models
proposed by [55]. These interaction-based methods consider
both topological features and their dynamics over time. How-
ever, the latter are not yet considered by our framework and
are reserved for future developments.
We utilized methods, which are solely based on a network’s
topology, therefore, consider features, such as node degree,
neighborhood distances and clusters, to identify opinion lead-
ers. One implementation of this is the calculation of node
centrality. The underlying assumption is, that the more inﬂu-
ence an individual gains, the more central it is in its network.
Which centrality measure is most suitable is dependent on the
application domain. We judged eigenvector centrality to be
most adequate, speciﬁcally Google’s PageRank algorithm [56],
which functions in a similar fashion. It recursively assigns a
rank R to each node A, based on the rank of the nodes of its
incoming edges Ti and its total number of links Ci. The value
of an edge is strongly dependent on the score of its originator
(see Equation (8)).
R(A) = 1 − d
N
+ d
n
X
i=1
R(T1)
C(T1), 0 ≤ d ≤ 1
(8)
With the damping factor d, normalized over the number
of all nodes of the network N, a part of the resulting rank
can be subtracted and distributed to all nodes. The application
of PageRank for the purposes of opinion leader detection has
seen merely moderate success [57] [58]. With LeaderRank, L¨u
et al. advocate further development and optimization of this
algorithm for social networks, and have achieved surprisingly
good results [59]. Users are considered as nodes and directed
edges as relationships between opinion leaders and users. All
users are also bidirectionally connected to a ground node. At
time step t0, all nodes receive the score si(0) = 1 except
for the ground node initialized with sg(0) = 0. Equation (9)
describes the process of probability ﬂow through the network,
where si(t) indicates the LeaderRank score of a node i at time
step t.
si(t + 1) =
N+1
X
j=1
aji
kout
j
sj(t)
(9)
Depending on whether or not there exists a directed edge
from node i to node j, the value 0 or 1 is assigned to aij.
kout
i
describes the number of outgoing edges of a node. The
ﬁnal score is obtained as the score of the respective node at
the convergence time tc and the base node score at the same
time, as shown in Equation (10).
Si = si(tc) + sg(tc)
N
(10)
The advantage of this algorithm compared to PageRank
is that the convergence is faster and above all that nodes,
that spread information faster and further, can be found. In
later work, for example, by introducing a weighting factor, as
in [60] or [61], susceptibility to noisy data has been further
reduced and the ability to ﬁnd inﬂuential distributors (hubs) of
information has been added.
However, there might be cases in which LeaderRank would
assign high scores to individuals, which are not relevant for
the present application. When a user attained a signiﬁcant
audience, while also actively following many opinion leaders,
we argue that their inﬂuence is based on their activity in
the network and not their opinion, as their presence makes
them more likely to be followed. We propose an approach
to eliminate such hybrid leaders from the top ranks, which
punishes the LeaderRank score LR(ϑi) of users with many
interactions in the network, meaning, those users who follow
many leaders. This way the top ranked users are pure leaders,
whose inﬂuence is purely based on their opinions.
PSC(Lϑi) =
LR(Lϑi)
1 +
kout
i
kout
total ∗ LRtotal
(11)
One way to calculate the PureScore of a particular topic-
speciﬁc opinion leader PSC(Lϑi) is shown in Equation (11).
The PureScore of a certain topic-speciﬁc opinion-leader is
calculated by dividing its original LeaderRank score LR(Lϑi)
by a percentage of the maximum score (equal to the number
of users) deﬁned by the node’s share of network activity, kout
being the number of outgoing links. However, this approach
needs to be evaluated in later work.
D. Visualization
If, with the approach described above, a risk greater than a
threshold value ε was determined, further information such
as locations, times and people involved are extracted from
the text and subsequently transferred to a corresponding map
with the help of geographical coordinates. An additional score
frisk(ϑ, Sϑ, |P|ϑ) provides information about the extent of the
expected risk, estimated from the risk class, the sentiment score
associated with it and the number of people involved in that
particular discussion. This value can, for example, be used to
color the geo location on a map, corresponding to a heat-scale.
The obtained result directly supports the short-term strategic
planning of security forces as proposed at the very beginning
of this section.
V.
PROTOTYPICAL IMPLEMENTATION
The aim of the prototype’s architecture is to implement the
frameworks described in [20] as well as the sections above. It
was programmed with Java and built as an Eclipse Rich Client
Platform (RCP). Its OSGi implementation Equinox allows for
a service-oriented architecture, consisting of three tiers:
1)
Persistence: Data is fetched from the various social-
network databases and put into EMF models. The
models are stored into a, as for now, local EMF Store
server. Thus, the databases and the EMF Store server
form this tier. Any annotations and meta-data are also
held by the models.
2)
Logic-Tier: This tier contains various linguistic ser-
vices, e. g., for topic modeling, used for annotation
and querying. The modeling service, which provides
CRUD-operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for
models in the EMF Store server, also resides here.

Furthermore, all data retrieval services, which com-
municate with corresponding social-network APIs,
are part of this tier.
3)
Access: The high-level services, usually directly con-
trollable by the UI, deﬁne this tier. At the current state
of the development, this is the retrieval service, which
initializes data fetching from the social networks, the
query-service, used for data retrieval from the EMF
Store server and the annotation services, which use
the linguistic services to enrich models.

Figure 4 provides a visual representation of these tiers.
When developing this application further, efforts will be made
to make the prototype more closely resemble the SoNA
framework described in this work. Permission services can be
realized through user proﬁles in the EMF Store server.
Figure 5: The user interface of the prototype. Shown is a down-
loaded Facebook page visualized in a graph. The Facebook
logo node represents the page, which is connected to posts,
which in turn are connected to their comments. The outermost
nodes are users, which are associated to the comments they
created.
The prototype provides a user interface to retrieve data
from Social Networks, currently Facebook, and visualizes it
in a 2D graph, as shown in Figure 5. Several ﬁlter options
are available in order to reduce the output network to the most
relevant nodes depending on the investigator’s needs. Data can
be retrieved from a speciﬁc part of the social network for a
certain period of time or a certain amount of content (i. e.,
posts and comments), before being stored in models. Created
models can then be annotated following the process chain as
discussed in the former sections.
VI.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper the theoretical framework SoNA was pre-
sented, which allows investigators of law enforcement agencies
as well as intelligence services to monitor social networks
in order to gather information about potentially dangerous
activities. This information can support the long- and short-
term planning of the deployment of security forces. It was
shown that the knowledge gained by applying this framework
can directly increase the resilience of a society in the ﬁrst
two stages of the resilience cycle. Furthermore, given the
complexity of the language used in Social Media it was nec-
essary to apply a knowledge-based and word-based approach.
In this respect, a process chain for analyzing social networks
was proposed and the main steps were discussed in detail.
These include the selection of dangerous militant proﬁles,
the assessment of the risk and the detection of leaders and
multipliers. We presented a prototype of the SoNA framework,
which aims to implement these aspects. Future work will
include the remaining steps of the process chain as well as
the evaluation of the entire framework. In order to do so, it
is fundamental to create an appropriate test environment in
collaboration with law enforcement agencies.
