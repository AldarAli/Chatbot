Abstract—Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a medical treatment
whose exact underlying biological mechanism is unknown. Yet,
DBS is an established therapy in a number of neurological
and mental disorders. Mathematical models aiming at a better
understanding of DBS through the simulation of the electrical
ﬁeld in the brain have been developed in the past years. This
study covers
in silico optimization of the electrical stimuli
delivered to the brain by means of a Finite Element model
individualized through medical imaging data. The goal is to
cover a given target volume with stimulation for full therapeutic
effect while limiting the spread of the stimuli beyond the target
border, to avoid undesirable side effects. The fraction of the
activated tissue volume within the target and the fraction of
the stimulation ﬁeld that spreads beyond it are computed in
order to quantify the performance of the stimuli. Two readily
available leads are treated: a state-of-the-art lead using single
active contact and a ﬁeld-steering one in multiple active contact
stimulation. Further, in order to obtain insights into lead design,
hypothetical leads with different geometric characteristics are
as well considered. The obtained results suggest that simpliﬁed
models give a reasonably good approximation to optimal contact
selection when compared to clinical data. Conﬁgurations with
multiple active contacts might improve stimulation in some cases,
although there is no general tendency. The lead design study
suggests that row segmentation with three or four contacts per
row is a good option. In addition, the stimulation performance
was generally better for the designs where the contacts were
closer to each other. This study thus conﬁrms the importance of
mathematical modeling in DBS as an inexpensive way of obtaining
optimal stimulation settings and lead designs.

INTRODUCTION
Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a surgical procedure that
consists of delivering electrical stimuli, usually rectangular
biphasic pulses, to a certain target in the brain by using
one or several surgically implanted leads. Initially DBS was
considered a purely medical problem. However, nowadays
there is a lot of interest in the engineering community, e.g.,
by suggesting alternative set ups based on modeling [1].
The goal of the therapy is the alleviation of symptoms of
various neurological diseases, such as Parkinson’s Disease
(PD) [2], epilepsy [3], dystonia [4], and others. DBS has
mostly replaced surgical lesioning and ablation procedures
because of its reversibility, ﬂexibility, and individualization
potential [5]. The interest in DBS has spread to other areas
of medicine and applied to treatment of psychiatric diseases,
such as e.g., schizophrenia [6] or Tourette Syndrome [7]. In the
case of PD, since the implantation and programming procedure
is quite complicated and costly compared to pharmacotherapy
[8], [9], physicians usually choose advanced patients for this
procedure, when drugs such as levodopa have lost effectiveness
or have severe side effects [2] such as ﬂuctuations, dyskinesias
or toxicity [10]. Some studies suggest in fact that an earlier
implantation could be beneﬁcial [11].
The principle of DBS is in delivering mild electrical pulses
via a chronically implanted lead, whose active contacts are
positioned in the subcortical area, where a stimulation target
is usually deﬁned. Prior to the operation, patients undergo an
extensive clinical examination as well as medical imaging.
Based on the images, the physician pinpoints a target area,
which is in PD usually located in the basal ganglia, with the
subthalamic nucleus (STN) being of particular interest. A few
weeks after the surgery, the patients undergo a lengthy trial-
and-error programming period to properly tune the stimuli.
Since the underlying physiological mechanism of DBS and
its long-term effects on the brain still remain unknown, the
therapeutical outcome is difﬁcult to predict. Furthermore, be-
cause of uncertainties in the position of the lead or suboptimal
stimulation settings, the stimulated volume might go beyond
the target causing undesirable side effects [12]. Shaping the
stimuli so that the stimulated volume covers the intended
target and does not spill outside of it is thus important for
maximization of the therapeutical beneﬁts and minimization
of the side effects.
Currently used lead designs (see Fig. 1(a)) were originally
adopted from cardiac pacing technology [13] and have not
evolved much since then. Meanwhile, further insights into
neuromodulation obtained in recent years by using computer
modeling based in Finite Element Method (FEM), multiphysics
simulation and neuron models, along with the exponential
improvement of computational capabilities, open up for more
sophisticated and individualized solutions. The aim of these is
to shorten the programming time and to better understand the
underlying mechanisms [14].
Addressing the shortcomings of the currently used designs,
novel DBS electrodes have been developed by such companies
as Boston Scientiﬁc (USA), St. Jude (USA) and Sapiens
(The Netherlands, now part of Medtronic). These leads could
be conﬁgured in more versatile spacial settings and take
advantage of ﬁeld steering techniques to shape the stimuli.
As seen from the geometry of the lead contacts in Fig. 1,

while the conventional state-of-the-art lead delivers a radially
symmetric stimulation over the whole cylindrical contact, the
ﬁeld steering one is capable of asymmetrical stimulation that
can be tailored to the target area anatomy [15].
Apart from the existing electrodes, hypothetical ones can
be tested inexpensively by using realistic computer models.
Analysis of design degrees of freedom in novel leads can be
performed as well, going beyond the ones already in clinical
usage or in development. Segmentation schemes were analyzed
in [16] while row separation as a design degree of freedom was
treated in [17] and [18]. This study compares the performance
of different lead schemes with respect to row segmentation and
the separation between the rows, see Fig. 2. At the moment, it
is a topic receiving close review, with some of the companies
mentioned above already developing schemes with optimized
geometry.

Another possibility for electrode performance improvement
is offered by a multicontact stimulation approach, i.e., ma-
nipulating the stimuli simultaneously at two or more active
contacts. It allows further shaping of the activated tissue
volume, thus providing more ﬂexibility.
This study focuses on stimuli optimization using the afore-
mentioned leads, i.e., how to choose a conﬁguration such
that a target volume, given by the STN or other volumes, is
stimulated. Due to the possible side effects, the stimulation
should be kept low outside the target. Within this framework,
the objectives of the present study are:
•
To compare the optimization results for a state-of-the-
art lead to the active contact and to the stimulation am-
plitude in clinical data, which are assumed to provide
good outcome. Both single contact and multicontact
approaches are evaluated.
•
To optimize a ﬁeld steering lead over a set of contact
conﬁgurations and compare to the state-of-the-art lead,
in order to assess possible advantages of the former.
•
To suggest design guidelines for several proposed
leads. Apart from the overspill, stimulation amplitudes
are also analyzed to address potential issues with
safety and battery life.
Results obtained in this paper suggest that a simpliﬁed DBS
model can reasonably well predict which contact or contacts
are used for stimulation by medical personnel according to
clinical data, at least for the analyzed lead population. Further,
the described optimization algorithm obtains a signiﬁcant
improvement in the overspill with ﬁeld steering asymmetrical
stimulation compared to symmetrical stimulation provided by
a state-of-the-art lead. In addition, the proposed approach
makes a useful design tool for new leads, although given
the variability of clinical data drawing reliable conclusions is
difﬁcult.
The rest of the paper is composed as follows. In Section II,
an overview of the FEM mathematical model is given, along
with different neuronal stimulation quantiﬁcation schemes.
Afterwards, the core optimization technique used is presented.
The state-of-the-art lead is analyzed in Section III with one
or two contacts used for stimulation. The ﬁeld steering lead
is analyzed and compared with the state-of-the-art one in
Section IV. In Section V, hypothetical electrode designs are
analyzed and the results obtained summarized. Conclusions
and limitations are discussed in Section VI.

MODELS AND METHODS
In this section, the FEM model, the neuronal stimulation
quantiﬁcation scheme and the optimization procedure used for
this study are described in detail.
A. Electric Field Model
The ﬁrst step to compute optimized stimuli is to obtain the
electric ﬁeld distribution given the lead geometry. The electric
potential is evaluated by solving the equation of steady currents
in the brain tissue:
∇·(σ∇u) = 0,
(1)
where u is the electric potential, σ the electric conductivity,
and ∇ is the gradient operator. The electric ﬁeld E is obtained
by taking the negative gradient of u:
E = −∇u.

An analytical solution to the model given by (1) does not
exist in most cases, but it can be integrated numerically using,
e.g., a FEM solver. The model considered in this study consists
of three main components: the bulk brain tissue, the lead, and
an encapsulation layer surrounding the lead.
The bulk tissue is represented as a cube with a side of
0.4 m centered at the tip of the lead that is grounded on
the outer surfaces to simulate the ground in the implanted
pulse generator. Although the brain tissue is heterogeneous
and anisotropic in reality, these effects are beyond the scope
of this paper, see [14] and [19] for details. Although the brain
tissue is made of several components, e.g., white matter, gray
matter, cerebrospinal ﬂuid and blood vessels, its conductivity
is approximated for this study as homogeneous with σ = 0.1
S/m [20].
In addition to the former two components, an encapsulation
layer is formed around a lead implanted in the brain due to
the reaction of the body to foreign objects [21]. However, the
thickness and conductivity of it are still open to debate and
might be patient speciﬁc. Following [14], a 0.5 mm thick layer
with a conductivity of 0.18 S/m is introduced.
Several lead designs are considered in this study:
•
A widely used state-of-the-art lead (Fig. 1(a)) with
cylindrical contacts, a height of 1.5 mm, and a sep-
aration between contacts of 0.5 mm. Its diameter is
1.27 mm.
•
A ﬁeld-steering lead with elliptical contacts. To fa-
cilitate ﬁeld steering, the rows are rotated 45◦ to
each other with respect to the lead axis, as shown in
Fig. 1(b),1(c), and 1(d). Its diameter is 1.27 mm as
well.
•
Hypothetical leads derived from the state-of-the-art
one. Two design degrees of freedom are considered:
◦
Row segmentation: As seen in Fig. 2, one
possibility is to split each row in a number
of contacts. For this study, rows with 2, 3, 4
and 6 contacts are considered.
◦
Row separation: Different separation schemes
are simulated to investigate the inﬂuence of
other contacts’ proximity on the shape of the
electric ﬁeld. In this study, contact row sep-
arations are in the range 0.25-1.5 mm. For
comparison, depending on the lead model, the
state-of-the-art leads have separations of 0.5 or
1.5 mm between contacts.
The stimulation signal is modeled as a Dirichlet boundary
condition at the active contacts surface while the non-active
contacts are left ﬂoating. It should be noted that model (1)
is a linear partial differential equation, and thus, it is enough
to compute the ﬁeld distribution for a unit stimulus and then
scale it accordingly, which transformation will simplify the
computations.
The model has been implemented in COMSOL 4.3b (Com-
sol AB, Sweden). The solutions obtained by the FEM solver
were then equidistantly gridded on a 70×70×60 grid centered
at the lead tip and expanding 16 mm in the axes perpendicular
to the lead and 20 mm in the lead axis, in order to be exported
for further processing.
Several ﬁeld distributions were computed:
•
State-of-the-art lead: Distributions with one active
contact and the rest ﬂoating were evaluated at ﬁrst. In
addition to that, ﬁeld distributions with the grounded
inactive contacts were computed. This was done to en-
able summing up them for the multicontact approach,
since the effect of one active contact on the others
when they are left ﬂoating can be computed.
•
Field steering lead: Distributions for the considered
conﬁgurations (Diamond-4, X-5, X-8, shown in Fig. 1)
were obtained for each row of contacts.
•
Hypothetical leads: Similarly to the computations for
the state-of-the-art leads, ﬁeld distributions for one
active contact with the rest ﬂoating were computed
at ﬁrst and, in addition, distributions with grounded
inactive contacts were computed for the multicontact
approach. It is useful in particular when considering
two rows stimulating with different amplitudes.
B. Quantiﬁcation of activated volumes
Volumes of activated tissue can be quantiﬁed by using
axon models [22]. While axon models yield precise results,
the procedure is computationally expensive and the topology
and connectivity of the neuron network must be known to some
degree. Other approaches involve functions that approximate
the activated volume without taking into account the anatomy
of the neurons, such as Rattay’s activation function [23] or
the electric ﬁeld [24]. These have the advantage of requiring
less computations and only stationary analysis. However, using
second derivatives might result in numerical issues, in partic-
ular in the area near the lead. Furthermore, it was shown that
the electric ﬁeld provides more robust means of quantifying
neuronal stimulation [24]. Thus, the electric ﬁeld will be used
in this study. The activated neurons are distinguished from
the rest by applying a threshold to the electric ﬁeld, with
the threshold value depending on the neuron anatomy and the
characteristics of the stimulation pulse itself [24].
To place the electric ﬁeld pre-computed by the FEM solver
at the proper position, conventional translation-rotation algebra
is utilized. Assuming that the tip of the lead is at the origin,
the set of operations is given by:
Eeval = RrotRzE+xlead,
(3)
where E and Eeval are the original and positioned electric ﬁeld
vectors respectively, Rrot is a rotation matrix that aligns the
ﬁeld with the given lead vector, Rz is a rotation matrix with
respect to the Z axis (used for ﬁeld steering), and xlead is the
lead position.
Once the ﬁeld is properly positioned and ﬁltered with the
aforementioned threshold, intersection volumes are computed
under a methodology similar to [25]. Two of them are of
particular interest with respect to the clinical applications: the
activated volume of the target area and the activated volume
outside the target area. The topology of the target area is taken
from an atlas of potential regions for therapeutical stimulation
and can be assumed to be convex. Whether the electric ﬁeld
points are inside of the convex hull of the target area or not is
checked by an additional function [26].

C. Optimization scheme
In order to optimize the stimuli, the following minimization
problem is deﬁned:
min
ui
J(ui),
(4)
where ui are the optimization variables (in this case, the electric
potential or potentials of the stimuli) and J(ui) is a cost
function to be deﬁned that should ideally be a convex function.
The following cost function is proposed:
J(ui) = pSpill(ui)

100−pAct(ui)
100−pTh

pAct ≤ pTh,
J(ui) = pSpill(ui)
pAct > pTh,
(5)
where pSpill is the fraction of the activated volume that lies
outside the target, pAct is the fraction of the target that is
activated, and pTh is the minimum activation required for the
target. All of them are given in percent for illustration. For
this study, pTh is set at 95%. It should be noted that, if several
amplitudes were to be optimized, the cost function would be
multi-dimensional.
The motivation behind the cost function above is that
it is continuous and convex, since both pAct and pSpill are
monotonically non-decreasing with the amplitude of the stim-
ulus. However, there is no clear relationship between the
functions pAct, pSpill and the stimulus amplitudes ui. Therefore,
a numerical optimization algorithm estimating the gradient of
J(ui) from the computed values of pAct and pSpill has to be
used.
An example illustrating the dependence of cost function
(5) on the stimuli amplitude is given in Fig. 3.

The small peaks in Fig. 3 occur because of issues with
the volume computation, namely since the geometry used for
both the activation volume and the target is deﬁned in convex
hulls of a discrete cloud of points. The computed volumes
are thus not smooth as u changes. Although this makes the
function non-convex in practice, the peaks are small enough
to be skipped by increasing the step size of the optimization
algorithm. A minimum step size of 0.002 V was taken.
When considering several stimulation amplitudes, extra
care should be exercised then in choosing the initial guess in
the optimization algorithm. It was found that the optimization
gets stuck in local minima more easily than in the one-
dimensional case.
III.
STATE-OF-THE-ART LEAD
In this section, approaches to stimulation with the state-of-
the-art lead are analyzed and compared.
A. Single Contact
To optimize stimulation with only one active contact, two
approaches can be considered. First, the active contact position
can be ﬁxed and only the stimulus amplitude is optimized.
Second, the active contact is left as an additional optimization
variable, restricted to taking a single value in the set of possible
positions Cs = {0,1,2,3}, where contact 0 is the most distal
and 3 is the most proximal. Due to the possibility of choosing
the active contact at will and to illustrate the efﬁciency of the
optimization method, the second approach is selected further.
Keeping the active contact free makes the optimization
problem equivalent to four such with ﬁxed contacts. In order to
speed up the computations, best active contact could be chosen
without optimization. By examining J(ui) given by (5), it can
be easily seen that as long as there is an intersection between
the activated volume and the target for at least one of the
contacts, the cost function will be lower in general for the
optimal contact no matter how large ui is. So, it is enough to
do a single evaluation of the cost function for a given value of
ui to choose the contact. Said value cannot be too low, since
it might yield empty intersections, or too high, since it will
take too much time to calculate due to the number of points
involved. Thus, the evaluation is performed with low ui and
then, if the intersection is empty, ui is set to a higher value.
Optimization was performed for 65 lead positions whose
clinical data stated a single contact stimulation with an activa-
tion threshold of 175 and 200 V/m. Comparing the optimized
results to the clinical settings is of great interest, so the fraction
of conﬁgurations estimated successfully by the optimization
algorithm with respect to the clinical settings was computed
as well.

with the threshold values of 175 and 200 V/m.
As seen from Tab. I, the mathematical model predicts the
clinically used contact for the deﬁned target in roughly a half of
the cases. In addition, in almost all of the cases, the predicted
optimal contact is an immediate neighbor of the one speciﬁed
in the clinical data. In some cases, there is no signiﬁcant
difference in the values of the cost function and either contact
can be utilized, according to the calculated values.

In addition, the predicted optimized stimuli amplitude is
fairly close to the clinical one. The plots in Fig. 4 suggest that
in most cases a threshold between 175 and 200 V/m might
be sufﬁcient. It comes though with a high standard deviation
thus revealing a high variability between patients. This is to be
expected, since the position of the lead has a very signiﬁcant
impact on the predicted optimal stimuli amplitude.
B. Multiple Contacts
Another approach to improve target coverage would be to
allow for multiple active contact conﬁgurations. To facilitate
the ﬁeld modeling, the linearity of (1) is exploited. In partic-
ular, the ﬁeld distribution for each contact stimulating with a
unit stimulus while the others are grounded is computed ﬁrst
and denoted as E0,i for the i-th contact. Then the interaction
between active contacts and the rest in ﬂoating conﬁguration is
calculated. It follows a linear relationship and is expressed by
the coefﬁcient αki, representing the effect the i-th contact has
on the k-th contact when the k-th contact is ﬂoating. This is
used to transform from an active-grounded to an active-ﬂoating
conﬁguration, when the contributions are being summed.
The electric ﬁeld distributions result from a sum of four
contacts, with the stimuli given by the active contacts, denoted
by ui and representing the degrees of freedom and the non-
active (ﬂoating) contacts contributing with the terms charac-
terized by the corresponding αki. For instance, for a 2-contact
scheme, one gets
E2cont(r) = u1E0,1 +u2E0,2+
+(u1α31 +u2α32)E0,3 +(u1α41 +u2α42)E0,4
(6)
It should be noted that the numbering of the contacts above
was arbitrary, and it could be any combination of them.

(b)
Figure 5. Isolevels for E = 200 V/m for a single active contact (a) and two
active contacts (b).
As Fig. 5(b) suggests, multiple active contacts might be
useful to tailor the stimulation so that it achieves a similar
activated volume with less overspill. The results are in princi-
ple dependent on the position of the target with respect to the
active contact in the single contact approach. If the target is
located next to the active contact, then it would be probably
reasonable to consider just a single contact stimulation. How-
ever, if the target is located in between two contacts, shaping
the stimulation with these two contacts might be beneﬁcial.
Figure 6. Example of considered multicontact conﬁgurations, with Contact 1
as the optimal (in red) and Contacts 0 (left) and 2 (right) as secondary (in
green).
To speed up computations, only the conﬁgurations which
involve neighboring contacts to the ones obtained in the
single contact approach are considered. So, for example, if
the predicted optimal contact is contact 1, only combinations
involving contacts 1 and 0 and 1 and 2 are considered, see
Fig. 6.

part of the cases. However, the improvement can be signiﬁcant,
with a decrease of up to 5 − 6% in the absolute value of
the overspill compared to the single contact approach. Note

that the state-of-the-art lead considered here features a ﬁxed
distance between contacts. The effects of uneven separation
between contact rows will be analyzed later in this study.
IV.
FIELD STEERING ELECTRODE
As was investigated in [25], [27], ﬁeld steering yields
better results regarding overspill than the state-of-the-art radial
stimulation. In this study, optimization is used in order to in
silico conﬁrm those ﬁndings.
Three conﬁgurations llustrated in Fig. 1 were tested. For
each conﬁguration, the parameters to optimize are the rows
where the active contacts are located and the orientation of
the lead with respect to its axis. To speed up computations,
the optimization followed a similar scheme to that applied with
multiple contacts, taking as a baseline the results obtained with
single contacts and the state-of-the-art lead. As shapes of the
contacts are different, the rows at roughly the same height are
considered, together with their neighbors.

The results are summarized in Fig. 8 - Fig. 10 and Tab. III
- Tab. V. In almost all cases, there is an improvement in
the overspill with respect to the single contact approach.
The improvement is largest in average with the Diamond-4
conﬁguration, Fig. 8. The high standard deviation comes from
the variety of geometries considered, making the improvement
heavily dependent on the lead position with respect of the
target. Some cases were observed where the X-5 or X-8 con-
ﬁgurations achieved better results for a speciﬁc lead location.

HYPOTHETICAL LEADS
Leads that have not been implemented in hardware are
analyzed in this section by computing ﬁeld distributions with
one or several active contacts, similarly to what has been done
above for the state-of-the-art and ﬁeld steering lead. This part
of the study is organized in three sections:
•
Row separation comparison, where the inﬂuence of
row separation on the stimulation ﬁeld is evaluated,
cf. Fig. 11(a) and Fig. 11(b).
•
Row segmentation comparison, in order to under-
stand how many contacts per row are enough to
achieve good selectivity, cf. Fig. 11(b) and Fig. 11(c).
•
Conﬁguration comparison, to compare active contact
schemes. For each lead, three active contact conﬁgura-
tions are considered: single contact, multiple contacts

and separation between rows of 0.25 mm (a) and 1.5 mm (b). A lead of 1
contact per row and separation of 1.5 mm is depicted for comparison (c).
Due to the amount of combinations needed, this part is
limited to a population of 6 leads, with only the illustrative
cases being described.
A. Row separation comparison
The ﬁrst question to look into is how the separation
between rows affects the predicted stimuli amplitude, together
with the overspill percentage. For the state-of-the-art lead
considered in the present manuscript, the separation between
the rows is 0.5 mm. Separations between rows equal to
0.25 mm, 0.75 mm, 1 mm and 1.5 mm are analyzed further.
Considering only one active contact, two trends were
observed, as illustrated in Fig. 12 and Fig. 13. In some cases,
increasing the distance between the contacts decreases the
overspill, while in some other cases the effect is the opposite
one.

When analyzing dual contact conﬁgurations, however, the
trend is usually that the overspill is larger the more separated
the contacts are, as seen in Fig. 14 and Fig. 15.
A plausible explanation for this is that the geometry of
the electric ﬁeld isolevels is quite different in case when the

contacts are close to each other compared to when they are
more separated. Indeed, it can be seen in Fig. 16 that the
considered isolevel when contacts are close to each other is
not so different from that when only one contact is active.
However, when contact rows become more and more sepa-
rated, the ﬁeld will stretch along the lead axis. Together with
the target morphology, this might explain why the overspill is
larger the more separated the contacts are.
(a)
(b)
Figure 16. 200 V/m isolevels for a hypothetical lead with 1 contact per row
and separation between rows of 0.25 mm (a) and 1.5 mm (b).
It can be concluded that having a large separation between
contacts does not facilitate achieving a good stimulation per-
formance although it might be beneﬁtial in some cases when
considering only one active row.
B. Row Segmentation
Another possibility to look into is segmented contact rows
that also offer ﬁeld steering, but for a lead shape different from
that analyzed in Section IV. For this part of the study, ﬁeld
distributions were optimized for 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 contacts per
row, see Fig. 2. From the results obtained above for the ﬁeld-
steering electrode, it is expected that the overspill will decrease
to some extent for the segmented state-of-the-art lead, as the
segmentation increases.
In the population considered, an overspill reduction is
achieved in most cases when the contacts are segmented, as
illustrated in Fig. 17. However, in some other cases, probably
due to the location of the lead, segmentation can actually lower
the predicted performance, as shown in Fig. 18. However, these
cases are less frequent.
It can be seen as well that the optimal stimulation amplitude
increases as the rows become more segmented. In the popula-
tion considered, the lower values of overspill with a moderate
amplitude are usually obtained at three or four contacts per
row at most. Going beyond that implies a large stimulation
amplitude that could be potentially harmful to the patient and
will consume more energy in a battery-driven device, while the
beneﬁts could be minimal or non-existent. In addition, more
complex hardware could be needed in order to achieve it, thus
making the product more costly and difﬁcult to handle in the
clinic.
It is worth mentioning that even in cases when segmen-
tation does not improve the overspill, multiple contacts could
be active in the same row yielding something similar to a
symmetric stimulation in the state-of-the-art lead. Indeed, as
can be seen in Fig. 19, there is no signiﬁcant difference

between them. Thus, even in cases when ﬁeld steering does
not produce an improvement, a good stimulation result can
still be achieved with these hypothetical leads by making all
the contacts in a given row active.

C. Contact conﬁgurations
Contact conﬁgurations can be analyzed, in pursuit for an
improvement over the single contact ones. A more thorough
analysis than in Section III is conducted here, taking into

consideration row segmentation and separation as well, since
it was previously done only with the state-of-the-art lead
speciﬁcations.
Dealing with active contact settings, the ﬁrst issue to con-
sider is the number of independent electrical sources present in
the pulse generator. If only one is present, the same amplitude
must be used for all active contacts. With several sources,
different amplitudes can be assigned to the active contacts,
making the setting more versatile. However, having several
sources makes the hardware more complex and expensive.
Further, the number of active contacts should be considered,
along with their location that can be in the same row or in
different rows.
For this study, conﬁgurations with both the same amplitude
and different amplitudes are considered. In all cases, the active
contacts neighbor each other.
1) Same amplitude: When considering active contacts with
the same amplitude, two options can be analyzed: when the
active contacts are in the same row or when they are in
different rows. The former however is not interesting since it
should yield the same stimulation as an electrode with contacts
per row and one active contact. For example, if a six contacts
per row lead is considered, having two active contacts in the
same row means that the stimulation will be the same as with
three contacts per row. Thus, only different rows are considered
in this part of the study.
Some results are depicted in Fig. 20 and Fig. 21. The
observed trends included the following:
•
Signiﬁcantly reduced amplitude in all cases, with the
effect being more pronounced the more segmented the
contacts are.
•
When considering overspill, there is an improvement
in some cases. Said improvement varies however sig-
niﬁcantly between leads: in some cases the improve-
ment is larger with a very segmented lead and vice
versa in others. As mentioned before, this is not an
issue since segmented electrodes can behave as non-
segmented ones, see Fig. 19.

different rows, the predicted amplitude is much lower, which
property translates into less power consumption and higher
patient safety.
2) Different amplitude, different rows: As with the state-of-
the-art lead, different stimulation amplitudes can be considered
as well under the same methodology as in Section III. Different
segmentation schemes will be considered as well.

From the plots in Fig. 22 and Fig. 23, the following can
be concluded:
•
The predicted amplitudes when different amplitudes
are allowed are similar to the ones obtained with the
same amplitude at all active contacts.
•
Compared to the case of two contacts with the same
amplitude, taking different amplitudes improves in
some cases the overspill.
•
In all considered cases, the amplitudes are lower than
the ones obtained with only one active contact.
Thus, as expected from the results in Section III, it could
be relevant in some cases to consider different amplitudes
assigned to two different contacts. However, in principle, the
gains might not justify the extra costs in hardware and in
programming time.

3) Different amplitude, same row: It could be interesting to
see how using different stimulation amplitudes can help when
the active contacts are taken in the same row. For this part,
only the lead with six contacts per row is considered since it
makes the most illustrative case. Conﬁgurations of three and
ﬁve active contacts positioned are considered, as in Fig. 24.

Figure 24. Conﬁgurations considered in the different amplitude, same row
case. Active contacts are depicted in red and blue, with the red contacts
having different amplitude than the blue contacts. Non-active contacts are
depicted in black.
The results obtained show that there is indeed a possibility
of using these conﬁgurations, as can be seen in Fig. 25 and
Fig. 26. Surprisingly, with ﬁve active contacts, the predicted
amplitudes are mostly the same for all contacts, which does
not happen when three active contacts are considered. How-
ever, the results exhibit large variability and can make this
alternative not worth the effort. Nevertheless, it could clearly
improve the performance in some cases.
VI.
DISCUSSION
Using optimization schemes in order to scale the stimulus
amplitude of the active contact or contacts could yield an
activation volume that better covers a given target while
limiting, as much as possible, stimulation beyond the target.
This study has compared two available leads: a state-of-the-art
lead and a ﬁeld steering lead. In addition, several hypothetical
leads have been tested in order to gain an insight into lead
design. Different contact conﬁgurations have been tested as
well.
Selecting the active contact freely for a given target with
the state-of-the-art lead while using the single-contact ap-
proach, a simple model predicts the clinically used contact in
roughly a half of the times in the considered lead population.

Furthermore, in some cases, there is no signiﬁcant difference
between the amplitudes or performance of the clinical and the
optimal conﬁgurations. Extending the stimulation to multiple
contacts allowed for an improvement of the overspill in around
38% of the cases.
The obtained results were compared to ﬁeld steering con-
ﬁgurations. A signiﬁcant improvement of the overspill with a
decrease of 10 percentage points on average was found in all
cases, with an average decrease of 18 percentage points for
the Diamond 4 conﬁguration.
The analysis was then extended to hypothetical leads with a
signiﬁcant variability in results observed. Even so, some trends
have been discerned: higher vertical separation between the
contacts usually leads to a higher overspill, in particular when
multiple active contacts are considered. Segmentation yields
good results in most of the analyzed leads, with the best perfor-
mance achieved with three or four contacts per row. Even if no
improvement is present, it is still possible to stimulate in a way
similar to the state-of-the-art lead by making all contacts in the
same row active. Care should be exercised however, since the
amplitudes needed to achieve satisfactory coverage are higher
than in the non-segmented leads, an effect that becomes more
profound the more segmented the leads are. When stimulating

with several contacts, the amplitude is signiﬁcantly lower but a
higher overspill could occur. Nevertheless, variability among
patients makes it difﬁcult to achieve general conclusions in
many cases.
The results obtained in this study apply under some limita-
tions. First, the brain tissue was assumed to be homogeneous,
when this is not the case and signiﬁcant (patient speciﬁc)
differences may arise [14]. Furthermore, the encapsulation
layer surrounding the lead has uncertain physical properties,
such as the conductivity and the thickness, both of which
might be time varying [28]. In addition, considering the electric
ﬁeld as a predictor of whether a neuron is stimulated or
not is an approximation. A more thorough analysis would
need a complete neuron population model. Finally, the results
obtained assume a certain target structure, which may be
patient speciﬁc as well. Results should be veriﬁed against
therapeutic outcomes, but the latter were not available for this
study.
Despite the mentioned limitations, this study highlights
the use of optimization schemes and geometric arguments
to choose optimal DBS stimuli and facilitate the comparison
between different lead designs and contract conﬁgurations.
These optimization schemes could be used as a benchmark
for other optimization algorithms such as in [29] and the
intersection algorithms can be used in order to assess a set
of stimulation settings as in [25].
