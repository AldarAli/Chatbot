Abstract—A paraconsistent logic program called Extended
Vector Annotated Logic Program with Strong Negation(abbr.
EVALPSN) has been developed for dealing with defeasible
deontic reasoning and plausible reasoning, and also applied
to various kinds of intelligent safety veriﬁcation and control.
Moreover, in order to deal with before-after relation between
processes (time intervals), another EVALPSN called bf(before-
after)-EVALPSN has been developed recently. In this paper, we
review the reasoning system for before-after relation between
processes based on bf-EVALPSN and introduce how to apply
the reasoning system to real-time pipeline process order safety
veriﬁcation and control with an example.
Keywords- before-after relation; paraconsistent logic pro-
gram; safety veriﬁcation; pipeline process order; reasoning
system.
I. INTRODUCTION
It has already passed over two decades since paraconsis-
tent annotated logic and its logic programming have been
developed [3], [4]. Based on the original annotated logic
program, we have developed four kinds of paraconsistent
annotated logic program, ALPSN (Annotated Logic Pro-
gram with Strong Negation), VALPSN (Vector ALPSN),
EVALPSN (Extended VALPSN) that can deal with defeasi-
ble deontic and plausible reasonings, and bf (before-after)-
EVALPSN that can deal with before-after relation between
processes (time intervals) [9]. We note that “before-after”
is abbreviated as just “bf” hereafter. Those annotated logic
programs have been applied to various kinds of intelligent
control and safety veriﬁcation such as pipeline valve control
based on safety veriﬁcation [7] and real-time process order
control based on safety veriﬁcation [10], and so on. More-
over, it has been shown that EVALPSN can be implemented
on microchips as electronic circuits, which implies that
EVALPSN is suitable for real-time control [8].
In this paper, we review the reasoning system for process
before-after relation in bf-EVALPSN [10] and show how to
apply it to the safety veriﬁcation for process order with an
example. The before-after relation reasoning system based
on bf-EVALPSN consists of two groups of inference rules
called basic bf-inference rules and transitive bf-inference
rules, both of which can be represented in bf-EVALPSN.
In bf-EVALPSN, a special annotated literal,
