Abstract— Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access 
(SC-FDMA) is the access scheme chosen by 3GPP for uplink 
UTRAN Long Term Evolution project (LTE). As SC-FDMA 
provides intra-cell orthogonality, one of the main reasons for 
performance degradation is the Inter-Cell Interference (ICI). 
This degradation is accentuated by the frequency reuse of 1 
deployed in the system, Since the Frequency Reuse (FR) and 
Power Control (PC) functionalities is a strong tool for co-
channel interference mitigation, using them critical issues in 
cellular Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access 
(OFDMA)/LTE networks. In this paper, we compare between 
the Open Loop Power Control (OLPC) and Closed Loop 
Power 
Control 
(CLPC) 
performance 
using 
different   
frequency reuse schemes. Simulation results show that large 
differences exist between the performance of different (FR) 
schemes and the optimal case in the overall cell throughput, as 
well as the cell-edge user performance. Also the closed loop 
power control has shown more cell and edge throughput gain 
over OLPC.

I. INTRODUCTION 
 LTE introduces a number of innovations that, in 
aggregate, continue to push ever closer to the theoretical 
maximum data rates defined by Shannon's Law [4]. 
Advances in multi-antenna techniques, OFDMA methods, 
wider bandwidth, interference mitigation, and protocol 
efficiencies are fundamental to deliver the promise of 4G 
Mass Market Wireless Broadband. The amazingly high data 
rates and sector throughputs (capacity) per cell are 
fundamental to supplying the ever increasing demand for 
wireless broadband. 
Effective reuse of resources in a cellular system can 
highly enhance the system capacity. With a smaller 
Frequency Reuse Factor (FRF), more available bandwidth 
can be obtained by each cell. So, in this sense the classical 
FRF of 1 is desirable see Fig. 2a. However, with the usage 
of FRF-1, the most User Equipments (UEs) are seriously 
afflicted with heavy ICI, especially near the cell edge. And 
that causes severe connect outages and consequently low 
system capacity. The conventional method to figure out this 
problem is through increasing the cluster-order, which can 
mitigate the ICI efficiently, nonetheless at the cost of a 
decrease on available bandwidth for each cell. This leads to 
restricted data transmissions and lower system spectrum 
efficiency. To take aim at improving cell-edge performance 
while retaining system spectrum efficiency of reuse-1. 
There are many techniques which can be used to 
mitigate interference in E-UTRA uplink. The basic 
approaches are classified into different type such as Power 
Control, 
Inter-cell-interference 
randomization, 
Coordination/avoidance, and Frequency domain spreading.  
 
Recent researches are focused at OLPC and CLPC 
performance evaluation. This is due to its capability of 
interference mitigation as well as increasing the system 
throughput. Many investigations for the performance and 
configurations of the OLPC and CLPC [4][7]. Results show 
that the different configuration is directly effect on both cell 
edge users and cell center users. 
Also, many recent researches are focused at FR 
techniques such as Hard Frequency Reuse HFR, Fractional 
Frequency Reuse FFR, Soft Frequency Reuse SFR and 
performance evaluation and developing [5][6], Results show 
great performance, especially for the cell edge throughput 
due to interference mitigation.

The current paper investigates about the ICI as a result of 
uplink PC and FR. In addition, it will combine between each 
PC techniques and the three FR schemes to achieve better 
performance.   
 
The paper is organized as follows; Section II describes 
the general interference mitigation concepts for E-UTRA 
followed by detail description of OLPC, CLPC and the most 
famous frequency reuse schemes which will be used with 
both OLPC & CLPC. Section III is discussing proposed 
system model. Section IV illustrates results and its analysis. 
Finally, the conclusion is presented in Section V. 
 
II. INTERFERENCE MITIGATION 
PC and FR schemes are representing the main building 
blocks of the proposed system model. 
 
A. Open Loop Power Control: 
PC refers to set output power levels of transmitters, Base 
Stations (BSs) in the downlink and UEs in the uplink. A PC 
formula has been already agreed in a 3GPP meeting for the 
Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) [2]. Fig. 1 is 
based on an OLPC algorithm and CLPC adjustments can 
also be applied. 
 
The 3GPP specifications [3] defines the setting of the 
UE transmit power P  for PUSCH by the following 
equation

where
Pmax
 is the maximum UE transmit power,
0
P  is a 
parameter that has a cell specific and nominal part. It is 
measured in dBm/Hz, expressing the power to be contained 
in one Physical Resource Block (PRB), M is the number of 
assigned PRBs to a certain user,   is the cell-specific path-
loss compensation factor that can be set to 0.0 and from 0.4 
to 1.0 in steps of 0.1, PL is the downlink path-loss measured 
in the UE, 
 msc
 is a UE-specific parameter (optionally cell-
specific), and 
( i )
f 
 is a UE-specific close-loop correction 
value with a relative or absolute increase. 
 
The scope of PC is to define the transmitting power in 
one PRB according to (1), letting the UE scale it to the 
assigned transmission bandwidth (BW). This implies that 
ultimately it will transmit with a constant power in each 
assigned PRB, For this reason, the term 
10  log10 M
 can be 
extracted from (1). Finally, removing the closed loop term, 
the Power Spectral Density (PSD) formula results in (2), 
which is referred to as the Fractional Power Control (FPC) 
formula.

It is preferred to work with the path gain information 
which is the linear inverse of the path loss. Then, (2) is re-

where PG  is the path gain of the user to the serving BS. 
 
If  =0, a case referred to as no compensation. All UEs 
will transmit at full power which results in high interference 
level and poor cell edge performance. With   =1, a case 
referred to as full compensation. The equation reduces to 
traditional slow power control scheme where all UEs are 
received at the same power resulting in poor spectral 
efficiency. By letting 0< <1,  one can achieve both good 
edge performance and high spectral efficiency by letting 
UEs with good channel condition transmit at relatively low 
power level to reduce the interference. At the same time, 
UEs with bad channel condition are transmitting at 
relatively high power level to achieve high spectral 
efficiency. 
Regarding to one of the references [4], we will use 
 =.8 and 
81

P  
dBm/PRB which achieve both good 
edge and cell throughput. 
 
 
Impact on the CINR Distribution 
 
The Carrier to Interference plus Noise Ratio (CINR) 
is one of the factors that determine the user 
throughput. Therefore, a discussion of the impact of 
the OLPC parameters on each UE experienced 
CINR would be very helpful for the operator. Let’s 
define the experienced CINR per user

Impact on the Cell and Edge throughput  
 
In EUTRAN LTE UL, the Modulation and Coding 
Scheme MSC is chosen according to the state of 
CINR, higher orders are used when this is higher. 
Equation (6) shows how the user throughput is 
calculated for a given user from its experienced 
CINR and allocated bandwidth. [4]

Equal to 180 KHz, 
Seff
 is the CINR efficiency at 
system level Set to 0.2 dB. By taking one PRB to be 
compatible with the fractional frequency reuse which 
will be discussed later, so there will be difference 
between our edge throughput and the reference edge 
throughput [4]. 
 
 Equation (7) is to calculate the cell throughput.  
 
T=E[C]*total number of PRBs at the system   “bps”    (7) 
 
where T is the cell throughput, E[C] is the average UEs 
throughput. 
Edge throughput is the lowest 5 % of Cumulative 
Distribution Function (CDF) of the total cell throughput. 
 
B. Closed Loop Power Control: 
 There are different techniques are used in CLPC because 
it does not have standardization. But the main idea of the 
closed loop is to start with OLPC then the UEs also sends 
feedback to the BS, which is then used to correct the user 
Transmitted 
TX
 power. 
There are two main techniques used for CLPC, 
Generalized Interference Based Power Control GI-PC, 
which take in the consideration the path loss to the serving 
BS, and the generated interference from the UEs to the 
neighbour BS. 
The second technique is Cell Interference Based Power 
Control C-IPC, which proposed for each UE to have not less 
the minimum reference CINR. 
 In our work, we will use the GI-PC as the second PC 
reference.

For the cell and edge UEs throughput will be the 
same as OLPC, other assumption will be at the 
Table 3. 
C. Frequency Reuses Schemes: 
There are three major techniques used 
 
Hard Frequency Reuse (HFR), hard frequency reuse 
splits the system bandwidth into a number of 
distinct sub-bands according to a chosen reuse 
factor and lets neighboring cells transmit on 
different sub bands see Fig. 2b. 
 
Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR), Fractional 
frequency reuse [5] splits the given bandwidth into 
an inner and an outer part. The inner part is 
completely reused by all BSs, the outer part is 
divided among the BSs with a frequency reuse 
factor greater, as one seen in Fig. 2c.

  Figure 2.  Different frequency reuses techniques 
 
 
 
Soft Frequency Reuse (SFR), soft frequency reuse 
[6][8][9], the overall bandwidth is shared by all base 
stations (reuse factor of one is applied), but for the 
transmission on each sub-carrier the BSs are 
restricted to a certain power bound see Fig. 2d. 
 
III. PROPOSED SYSTEM MODEL 
In this section, the system model is discussed; details are 
shown in tables 1, 2.  
Following the 3GPP guidelines [1], the cell simulation 
layout consist of a wrap around Macro-cell scenario 
reference case 1; see Fig. 3. Composed by a grid of 19 sites 
with 3 sectors each (19 BS with 3 sectors, total cells are 
19*3=57cells), each cell has 100 user, the inter site distance 
is 500 meters and each sector is modeled by a hexagon 
 
The operating bandwidth is divided in 50 PRBs (48 PRB 
for users and 2 for signaling) with a bandwidth of 180 KHz 
each. There is a Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) in the 
specifications, used to constructively combine the multiple 
received signals in the antennas. It is modeled here as a 
constant gain of 3 dB in the received signal. 
The total path loss between an UE and a BS is modeled 
as in (10).

For the PC parameter we will take the same assumption as 
[4], except the PRB for each user will be one PRB, all 
parameters are shown in Table 3.  
 
       For the frequency reuse  
 
For HFR, we will divide the total used PRBs for the 
3 sectors which will give 16 PRBs for each sector. 
 
For FFR, we will divide the total PRBs to two 
groups each group is 24 PRBs, 24PRBs for the 
centre UEs (Ues, which have path loss less than 
120dB), and 24 PRBs is distributed to the three 
sectors (8PRBs for each sector for the UEs which 
have path loss more than 120dB).  
 
For SFR, we divide the total PRBs to three [9] 
groups, the first group include the UEs which have 
path loss less than 110dB, the second group include 
the UEs, which have a path loss between 110dB and 
120dB and the last group include the UEs, which 
have a path loss more than 120dB.  
 
IV.   RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 
The implementation and simulations are carried out using 
a multi-cell radio network dynamic simulator implemented 
in MATLAB to evaluate the PC with different FR schemes. 
 
The results show that all techniques start from the lowest 
cell throughput and edge throughput and both of them 
increase to a certain point,   peak edge throughput observed 
when the first user reaches the maximum UE power 
limitation. Sudden decreasing appears in edge throughput 
due to interference increasing regarding to the many UEs 
reach the maximum power limitation which leads to average 
PSD increasing, which is responsible of edge throughput 
decreasing. 
We will divide the results to three main parts, validation 
results, OLPC with different FR schemes and CLPC with 
different FR schemes 
 
A. Validation results 
Fig. 4 shows a comparison between the obtained results 
and that had been presented in [4] in the same operational 
conditions. It is shown that the obtained results get more 
gains and have the same behaviour of [4] taking in the 
consideration that in [4] there are 6 PRB for each user ,but 
in our case there are only 1 PRB for each user to be 
compatible with each FR scheme.  
 
B. OLPC with different FR schemes 
     Fig. 5 illustrates different schemes of FR. It is shown that 
by decreasing the interference level by using different FR 
there will be an increasing in the CINR. The obtained results 
may be categorized into two main sections. The first one is 
the edge throughput and the other one is cell throughput. 
 
1. Impact on edge throughput  
 
All FR schemes obtained edge throughput gain over the 
ordinary OLPC. 
 
OL-HFR has become the highest obtained edge 
throughput, on the other hand OL-SFR is acting as the 
lowest edge throughput.

the increasing of the interference level when it is 
compared to the other FR schemes; see Fig. 6. 
 
2. Impact on cell throughput

gain over ordinary OLPC on the other hand CL-HFR has 
lower cell throughput than ordinary OLPC. 
The result may be explained as follows; 
 
 
OL-HFR: Has the lowest cell throughput as the 
total number of PRBs is decreased to 16 PRBs only; 
see Fig. 6. 
 
OL-FFR: Has a good cell throughput regarding to 
decreasing the amount of interference which is 
generated from the edge UEs; see Fig. 6.

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  
As the FR and PC functionalities is a strong tool for co-
channel interference mitigation, using them critical issues in 
cellular (OFDMA)/LTE networks.  
Both of OLPC & CLPC techniques had been 
investigated. 
The novelty of the current work is presented via 
considering both of FR schemes as well as the PC 
techniques.The obtained results shows gain in CINR for all 
FR schemes. 
The closed loop power control has shown more cell and 
edge throughput and system gain. 
 
During this work PC techniques with different FR 
schemes were analyzed by the means of a fixed bandwidth, 
balanced load and specific boundries of PL for FR schemes. 
Future work could investigate the impact of variable 
bandwidth and unbalanced load. An important contribution 
would be to find a mechanism to automatically set the 
optimum boundries of PL for FR schemes and the ability to 
switch between different FR schemes to obtain the best 
performance
