Abstract—The large synchrotron radiation facility SPring-8 in
Japan is a shared research facility opened to domestic and foreign
researchers of industry, government, and academia. It is used
for research and development in a wide range of ﬁelds. This
facility must be efﬁciently operated and must have substantial
research outcomes because national grants are used to fund its
operation. This paper creates a visual of how the experimental
stations in the facility were used over time on the basis of
the SPring-8 publication database. It aims to clarify which
experimental stations are used in combination to create research
outcomes. A network analysis showed that each experimental
station can be classiﬁed into groups: a group with many research
outcomes, a mediating group that supports research by other
experimental stations, and a group specialized for combined use
with speciﬁc experimental stations. It also became clear that there
is a difference in the publication productivity of each group.

INTRODUCTION
Shared research facilities in Japan are ﬁnanced by the
national treasury. For this reason, such facilities must maximize
their research outcomes and contribute to academic progress
and social and economic development. Optimizing facility
services with a limited budget and staff is also important. To
improve facilities and their proposal systems, it is necessary
to determine whether experiments conducted have had corre-
sponding research results. In most cases, for shared research
facilities that have only recently started operation, those in
charge of the facility prioritize tracking usage trends such as
the operation time of the facility and the number of users.
The evaluation of research outcomes by facility-use is often
conducted after the facility has been in operation for several
years. Also, in many cases, those in charge of the facility
evaluate mainly on quantitative values such as the number of
published papers or citations. Therefore, there is not much
analysis of research outcomes derived from the combined use
of experimental stations in facilities.
This research aims to present a new perspective by evaluat-
ing experimental stations in addition to conventional quantita-
tive indicators. We analyzed the database in which the results
of research conducted at SPring-8 [1] are registered. SPring-
8 is a shared research facility open to domestic and foreign
researchers in the ﬁelds of industry, government, and academia.
This paper ’s main contributions are as follows: ﬁrst, we
closely examine how the interactions between experimental
stations changed over time, and extracted some characteris-
tic network structures; second, we visualize the publication
productivity of each experimental station and classify them
into several groups; third, we present the potential for creating
research outcomes as a general indicator for each experimental
station whose position cannot be evaluated by its number of
associated publications alone.
In Section 2, we give an overview of SPring-8 and its
publication database. We then discuss related work in Section
3. In Section 4, we explain how we visualized the potential for
creating research outcomes. In Section 5, we focus on unique
structures in the complex network of beamline interactions
and classify the beamlines into four groups on the basis of
publication productivity. By the analysis results, we discuss
future subjects for research in Section 6.

OVERVIEW OF SPRING-8
SPring-8 is a large synchrotron radiation facility con-
structed in the west of Japan that started operation in Oc-
tober 1997. More than 15,000 researchers come to SPring-8
annually, and more than 2,000 experiments in a wide range
of ﬁelds, such as material science, earth science, life science,
environmental science, and industry (in other words, research
proposals) are conducted every year.

This facility has multiple experimental stations with dif-
ferent characteristics; these experimental stations are called
“beamlines” [2]. In a beamline, high-intensity light (radiation
light) is spectroscopically divided (taken out into the light of a
speciﬁc wavelength), and a measurement sample is irradiated
with it. Researchers who want to use this facility prepare
an application form describing which experimental station
they wish to use, for what purpose. They need to submit
their proposal on the user portal website “SPring-8 User
Information” [3] before the deadline that is twice a year. The
main items of the application form are shown below.
•
Experimental Details
•
Research Area
•
Research Method
•
Project Team Members
•
Samples
•
Requested Experiment Time
•
Preferred Beamline
After the deadline, proposals are reviewed from the per-
spectives of scientiﬁc validity, technical feasibility, and ex-
periment safety. After these assessments, the proposal review
committee makes a ﬁnal decision on whether or not to approve
each proposal.
Beamlines are classiﬁed into three types depending on the
researching party by whom they are intended to be used. In
this research, we analyze the potential for creating research
outcomes of 26 public beamlines that were built for researchers
to use generally and 18 contract beamlines that were con-
structed by research proposers (consisting of domestic and
foreign industries, academia, and government) for their own
continuous use.
A beamtime fee corresponding to usage time is charged
after each experiment. However, if researchers publish their
research results in a refereed journal article, etc., within three
years of the experiment and register information such as the
article title in the SPring-8 publication database, the beamtime
fee is waived.
The research result information of SPring-8 is open as a
database on the User Information portal [4], and it is possible
to search by specifying article title, author name, journal title,
proposal term, and other such terms (Figure 1).
Although it is not possible to directly access the article
content from each search result, if the article ’s digital object
identiﬁer (DOI) has been registered, users can navigate to the
website of the corresponding publisher manually.

RELATED WORK
As a precedent network analysis, Yamashita et al. predicted
trends in the information of academic ﬁelds using information
from applications for Grants-in-Aid for Scientiﬁc Research [5].
Also, ´Erdi et al. analyzed a temporal change in the structure
of a cluster based on the citation information of US patents
[6]. Cho and Shih identiﬁed core and emerging technologies
in Taiwan from a patent-citation network in order to pursue
competitive advantages [7]. In addition, studies that trace the
transition of research trends and predict research domains
expected to develop in the future by analyzing the network
of cited works and references have been conducted in various
research ﬁelds [8]–[11].
National Institute of Science and Technology Policy in
Japan (NISTEP) extracts high-attention research areas on the
basis of citations in other articles and depicts the results in a
“Science Map” [12]. With this map, one can understand the
changes over time in research trends around the world and
domestically with a visual similar to a heat map. One can
also visually compare the competitive research areas of each
research institution. However, this is not suitable for analyzing
the potential for creating research outcomes from experimental
stations in a single facility because this map comprehensively
shows competitive domains of an entire research institution.
Major synchrotron radiation facilities in the world publish a
booklet summarizing research highlights every year [13]–[15].
From this information, it is possible to roughly understand the
latest trends and outcomes in each research domain at each
synchrotron radiation facility. However, there are few studies
that analyze from multiple perspectives how experimental
stations in a shared facility are used in combination and
whether combined use creates research outcomes.
In this research, on the basis of the SPring-8 publication
database, we conduct network analysis to clarify the mutual
relationship between beamlines that contributed to research
outcomes. In short, we arrange each beamline as a node in
a network diagram and connect the nodes if there is combined
use of the beamlines. This connection is depicted as an edge.
By analyzing the temporal changes in this beamline network,
we can evaluate each beamline not only by its number of
associated publications but also by the presence of nodes
that contribute to outcomes. Further, in order to visualize the
differences in trends between public and contract beamlines,
the node shape of the two beamline types is distinguished.
IV.
METHODOLOGY OF VISUALIZATION
Here, we present the procedure for visualizing the potential
for creating research outcomes of each beamline using a
network analysis of the data accumulated in the SPring-8
publication database. We analyzed the research results (9,126
records) and related proposals (21,277 records) published be-
tween January 1, 2006 and September 30, 2017 and registered
in the database by 13 October 2017. Then, we prepared
separate data for every three years from 2006 in addition to
the overall data and analyzed the overall trend and the changes
over time. All data used in this analysis are open information
that can be found in the SPring-8 publication database.

A. Structure of SPring-8 Publication Database
The SPring-8 publication database consists mainly of the
following items.
•
Publication Title
•
Type of Publication
•
Place of Publication
•
Author Information (First Author, Coauthor, Corre-
sponding Author)
•
Related Proposal Information
Besides publications in refereed journals, activities such
as oral presentations, poster sessions, and invited talks can
also be registered in the publication database. However, the
beamtime fee is only waived when a publication is registered
in the categories of “refereed journals, dissertation, refereed
proceedings,” “SPring-8 research report,” or “corporate tech-
nical journal” [16]. In this research, we analyze the registration
data of publications that satisfy these criteria for approval as
a “dissemination of research results.”
In the publication registration form, in addition to the
publication title, there is a column for registering related
proposal information corresponding to past research results,
and multiple items of related proposal information can be
registered for each research result. When doing so, it is
necessary to enter the proposal number that uniquely identiﬁes
the research proposal to be used. From this number, it is
possible to identify the beamline used in the experiment.
B. Calculation of Nodes and Edges
If a research result (article) is derived from multiple
proposals, it is considered that a single beamline more than
twice or different beamlines were used. In other words, by
depicting a network with edge co-occurrence of beamlines
used in research outcomes, the nature of each beamlines’
contribution to research outcomes can be represented visually.
We calculated values of nodes and edges according to the
following procedure (Figure 2).
1)
Record beamline(s) from related proposals for each
registered publication.
2)
Enumerate combination(s) of beamlines included in
the same registered publication.
3)
Count total number of registered publications for each
beamline. This value corresponds to node size.
4)
Count total number of registered publications for each
beamline-pair combination. This value corresponds to
edge width.
C. Visualization of Combined Use with Beamlines
An undirected graph was created using the beamlines of
related proposals as nodes and the combination of beamlines
as edges. The graph-drawing algorithm used a spring model.
We represented the number of publications registered for
each beamline with the size of the node and the number
of publications derived from the combined use of multiple
beamlines with the width of the edge. Public beamlines were
plotted as circles while contract beamlines were plotted as
squares; this way, the difference in the interaction depending
on the beamline type could be identiﬁed.
A weak connection between the nodes indicates that the
frequency of combined use of the beamlines is low. Because

these networks have a low impact on research outcomes, we
excluded edges with less than ﬁve publications over the entire
period. However, in the network in which the aggregation
period is divided into three years, the edges that are not
included in the overall period are drawn on the network even
if the number of registered publications in the beamline-pair
is less than ﬁve.
D. Visualization of Publication Productivity
The proportion of articles associated with each beamline
to the total number of registered publications is plotted on
the x-axis. The ratio of the edge of each node (degree) to the
maximum edge number, i.e. the edge co-occurrence rates of the
beamline, is plotted on the y-axis. We deﬁne the coordinates
of each beamline in this graph as publication productivity.
V.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 3 shows the beamline network that is based on
the related proposals of registered publications issued between
2006 and the end of September 2017.
From the total number of edges and registered publications,
it can be seen that the mutual relationship between beamlines
is stronger for public beamlines than for contract beamlines.
Many public beamlines occupy the central part of the net-
work while contract beamlines are satellites in the peripheral
part. Further, some contract beamlines were isolated from the
network of beamline connections, and most of the approved
proposals were conducted with a single beamline. Figure 3
also shows that beamlines with little combined use with other
beamlines have a relatively low number of publications. As
for beamlines with a large number of publications, nodes with
high degrees such as BL01B1 and BL02B2 are in the center
of the network, while structures that use a small number of
beamlines in combination intensively like BL38B1, BL41XU
and BL44XU are also seen. In this way, the existence of a
clique is recognized between beamlines that have relatively

low degrees but a large number of publications. In this case,
“clique” means that the three nodes are connected to each other
by edge. The clique in the beamline network seems to indicate
compatibility of experimental equipment to some extent. These
results suggest that when a speciﬁc beamline is crowded with
proposals and the requirements of the measurement object are
met, a change to another beamline may be possible. Therefore,
if it is anticipated that a beamline in a clique has a high ability
to produce outcomes and the demand in the future is expected
to be strong, it will be possible to consider adding additional
beamlines of the same speciﬁcations. The cliques in which
the number of registered publications between each node by
beamline-pair is 12 or more are listed in Table I.
Additionally, we divided the aggregation period into every
three years from 2006 on the basis of publication year in
order to compare how beamline combinations changed over
time. Table II shows the cluster coefﬁcients by period, average

2006 to 2008, and there was only one clique corresponding
to the No. 1 combination of Table I. However, in the 2009
to 2011 period, the network structure grew large, combined
use of beamlines increased considerably, and cliques No. 2
and 4 appeared. The number of clusters and edges increased
in 2012 to 2014, and the existence of all the cliques in Table
I was visible at this point. However, in the last three years,
the network structure saturated and no signiﬁcant change was
observed as an indicator. This is likely because the number
of approved proposals, operation time of the facility, and
beamlines in operation (nodes) have not changed signiﬁcantly
in recent years.
The proportion of the number of registered publications for
each beamline to the total number of publications (9,126) is
plotted on the x-axis. The percentage of combined use among
other beamlines, i.e. the degree of each node divided by the
maximum number of edges (43) in the network, is placed on
the y-axis. Each point is drawn as a scatter diagram (Figure
4).
The graph of publication productivity shows that beamlines
can mainly be classiﬁed into the following four groups.
•
High-Performance Group
•
Mediating Group
•
Specialized Group
•
Low-Performance Group
The triangular dotted line indicates beamlines for special-
ized applications. Some such beamlines include industrial-
use beamlines and protein crystallography beamlines whose
main application is a routine measurement of protein structure
analysis.
The high-performance group is a beamline group with a
large number of registered publications and nodes with high
degrees. As can be seen from Figure 3, it is in the center of
the network and is active in combined use with other beam-
lines, but there are also a large number of publications that
come from multiple uses of the same beamline. In beamlines
included in this group, a general-purpose measurement method
called X-ray absorption ﬁne structure (XAFS) is available. Its
use for general purposes in a wide range of research ﬁelds is
likely a factor leading to the group’s high performance.
The mediating group has relatively few registered publi-
cations, but has active combined use with other beamlines,
which suggests that this group supports the research outcomes
of other beamlines. In this group, nodes have relatively high
degrees, and it is difﬁcult to identify cliques. In other words,
the combined use of three or more beamlines is not common.
Therefore, it is presumed that beamlines in this group are also
utilized for preliminary experimental measurements in various
research ﬁelds.
Beamlines included in the specialized group are highly ca-
pable of creating research outcomes, but they are characterized
by limited combining with other beamlines. In other words,
it is a group that easily creates cliques, such as the No. 1
beamline group in Table I. This beamline group is contained in
a triangle dotted line indicating that it has a speciﬁc application
type, and contains most of the beamlines capable of the routine
measurement called protein crystal structure analysis. It is
thought that the connection with beamlines used in other
research methods and ﬁelds is sparse for this reason.
The low-performance group has few publications, and its
association with other beamlines is weak. The fact that many
contract beamlines are in this group is considered to be one
reason that the publication productivity of contract beamlines
is relatively lower than that of public beamlines. Contract
beamlines were initially built by research proposers on the
premise that they would be used for speciﬁc research, so this
group is not generally considered for a wide range of use by
researchers other than stakeholders. However, the installation
space for beamlines is limited, and it is essential to continually
create research outcomes commensurate with the beamtime
because government grants are being used in the construction
and operation of the entire facility. Because there are beamlines
specialized for research in speciﬁc areas with few contact
points with other ﬁelds, they should not be evaluated only
by their associated number of registered publications. But, the
potential for creating research outcomes in this group would
be improved by promoting interaction with other beamlines.
VI.
CONCLUSION
In this research, on the basis of data registered in the
SPring-8 publication database, we visualized the correlations
between beamlines and the potential for creating research
outcomes from each beamline. As a result, the edges in
the network increased with time, and we found that new
outcomes were created as a result of using various beamlines
in combination. We also found that the beamline network
includes some clusters such as a group with a large number
of publications, a group that indirectly supports the outcomes
of other beamlines, and a group that forms a clique structure
with strong connections between speciﬁc beamlines. It is
essential to consider measures for improving the performance
of beamlines (nodes) with low degrees and few registered
publications. Our research will be helpful as one method for
deciding which beamlines to renew when planning a SPring-8
upgrade program.
However, in this research, we do not mention the differ-
ences in beamtime required for creating publishing results for
each research area and the quality of the research outcomes.
Therefore, to deepen the evaluation of individual beamlines, it
will be necessary to consider the impact that research outcomes
conducted using each beamline has had on academia and
society and the adaptability of the beamlines to high-growth-
potential ﬁelds in the future. We aim to further this analysis by
including external indicators such as the ranking of academic
journals (e.g., impact factor) and the number of cited articles
for each registered publication. We also intend to analyze the
similarities between registered publications using the metadata
of the publication database and adding the originality of
publications as a perspective to consider when evaluating the
beamlines.
