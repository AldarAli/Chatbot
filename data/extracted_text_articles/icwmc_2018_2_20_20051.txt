INTRODUCTION 
In Advanced Television Standard Committee (ATSC) 3.0, 
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) is optionally 
supported and can provide spatial diversity and multiplexing 
gains [1]. The ATSC 3.0 MIMO system additionally includes 
MIMO demultiplexer and precoder compared to ATSC 3.0 
baseline system. Each output of the MIMO demultiplexer is 
mapped to constellation symbols in the mapper which is 
identical to ATSC 3.0 Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) [2]. 
In ATSC 3.0, Non-Uniform Constellations (NUCs) are 
defined and the shape of NUCs is specified for each 
combination of modulation order and code rate [3]. Also, the 
MIMO precoder consists of the stream combining, I/Q (In-
phase/Quadrature) polarization interleaving and phase 
hopping. Here, the precoder outputs can be divided into the 
in-phase and quadrature components and then the 2x2 
complex-valued channel model of ATSC 3.0 MIMO system 
can be transformed into a 4x4 real-valued channel model [4]. 
This paper proposes a suboptimal decoding scheme based 
on QR-decomposition [5] and Parallel Detection (PD) [6] 
using the 4x4 real-valued channel model for ATSC 3.0 MIMO 
system. Since NUCs are used in ATSC 3.0, the shape of NUCs 
should be considered for the proposed decoding scheme. 
However, NUCs were not considered in previous works for 
real-valued channel models [7][8]. The proposed decoding 
scheme can reduce the decoding complexity with a negligible 
performance loss compared with the Maximum-Likelihood 
(ML) decoding.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II 
introduces the MIMO precoder and NUCs of ATSC 3.0. In 
Section III, the real-valued received signal model for ATSC 
3.0 MIMO is described and the proposed decoding scheme is 
presented. The simulation result is provided in Section IV and 
finally, this paper is concluded in Section V.

 MIMO PRECODER AND NUCS OF ATSC 3.0 
The received signal vector of ATSC 3.0 MIMO system 
can be represented as follows:

𝑈&"'(]* denotes the received signal for the 
𝑖-th cell pair. And, 𝐇 = -ℎ((

𝑚-th receive antenna. Also, 𝐍" = [𝑛&"
𝑛&"'(]* denotes the 
Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) vector for the 𝑖-th 
cell pair. Here, 𝐬" = [𝑆&"

vector 𝐱" = [𝑋&"
𝑋&"'(]* is input into the MIMO precoder 
and passes through the stream combining, I/Q polarization 
interleaving, and phase hopping blocks in turn.  
In ATSC 3.0, NUCs are used in the mapper. Fig. 1 shows 
an example of NUC for the combination of 16-ary modulation 
and code rate of 10/15 [1]. Unlike uniform 16-ary Quadrature 
Amplitude Modulation (QAM), the number of candidates of 
in-phase or quadrature components is 8. In general, for M-ary 
2 dimensional (2D)-NUC defined in ATSC 3.0, the number of 
all possible real-valued candidates in each dimension is M/2 
[3] where M denotes the modulation order. Hence, several 
component bits of a given complex symbol in 2D-NUC are 
not separated into in-phase and quadrature components unlike 
uniform QAM. 
 
III. 
PD-BASED DECODING SCHEME FOR ATSC 3.0 
MIMO 
The real-valued received signal vector for ATSC 3.0 
MIMO system can be represented as follows [4]: 
 
 
 
where 𝐇< = -Re{𝐇}
−Im{𝐇}
Im{𝐇}
Re{𝐇}/, 𝐬"
< = [Re{𝐬"

Im{𝐬"
*}]* , 
and 𝐍"
< = [Re{𝐍"
*}
Im{𝐍"
*}]* . Here, Re{∙}  and Im{∙} 
denote the real and imaginary parts, respectively. Additionally, 
the output of the MIMO precoder can be rewritten by using 
the real-valued input vector, 𝐱"
< = [Re{𝐱"
*}
Im{𝐱"
*}]*, of the 
MIMO precoder and the real-valued transformation matrices, 
𝐓, 𝐏, and 𝐂, for the stream combining, I/Q polarization 
interleaving, and phase hopping, respectively. Also, 𝐇H
< =
𝐇< ⋅ 𝐂 ⋅ 𝐏 ⋅ 𝐓 denotes the real-valued equivalent channel gain 
[4]. 
By using the real-valued signal representation for ATSC 
3.0 MIMO, suboptimal decoding algorithms based on QR-
decomposition can be considered. As mentioned in the 
previous section, several component bits of NUC in ATSC 3.0 
cannot be separated into in-phase and quadrature parts and 
such bits are related across two layers, i.e., real and imaginary 
parts. Therefore, each inseparable bit has to be jointly 
considered with both of real and imaginary parts. However, 
uniform constellations were considered in previous works for 
real-valued channel models, this property of the NUC shape 
was not considered [7][8]. In this paper, a PD-based decoding 
scheme for ATSC 3.0 MIMO using NUCs is presented. The 
PD considers all possible transmitted symbols for the first 
layer which is the last element of the received vector [6]. Next, 
the cancellation for the second layer is performed for each 
possible candidate symbol. Note that the first layer means the 
last element of the real-valued received signal vector in 
reverse order. Similarly, all possible real-valued candidates 
for the first layer, i.e., the imaginary part of the second 
complex symbol, are considered in the proposed PD-based 
decoding for ATSC 3.0 MIMO. Note that the number of all 
possible real-valued candidates is M/2. 
This paper assumes that the perfect dual-polarized 
antennas are used. Therefore, the in-phase component vector 
[𝑋&",K
𝑋&"'(,K]  and the quadrature component vector 
[𝑋&",L
𝑋&"'(,L]  in the real-valued signal vector can be 
decoupled for MIMO decoding. However, each real symbol 
𝑋&",K and 𝑋&"'(,K for in-phase components or each real symbol 
𝑋&",L  and 𝑋&"'(,L  for quadrature components cannot be 
decoupled. Hence, for the second layer, i.e., the imaginary part 
of the first complex symbol 𝑋&"'(,L, the cancellation for the 
symbol of the first layer has to be performed. However, for 
the third and fourth layers, i.e., 𝑋&",K  and 𝑋&"'(,K , the 
cancellations for the symbols of the first and second layers are 
not performed. 
On the other hand, inseparable bits for a complex symbol 
are related with both real and imaginary parts of the complex 
symbol. The first and third layers are related for 2i-th complex 
symbol and the second and fourth layers are related for (2i+1)-
th complex symbol. For the separable bits, the hard decision 
for each candidate can be independently performed by 
computing Euclidean distance between the received signal for 
a given layer and each candidate symbol. For inseparable bits, 
on the other hand, the hard decision for each candidate is not 
performed in the first and second layers. Next, for the third 
layer, all candidates of the first layer are jointly used with all 
candidates of the third layer. Also, for the fourth layer, all 
candidates of the second layer are jointly used with all 
candidates of the fourth layer in a similar manner. After that, 
the Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) for each bit in a given 
complex symbol is calculated by using obtained candidate 
vectors.  
Note that the complexity of the ML decoding is 
proportional to 𝑀&. For the proposed PD-based decoding, on 
the other hand, the second layer can consider (𝑀/2)&

candidates. Next, the third and fourth layers can consider 𝑀 
and 𝑀/2 candidates, respectively. Therefore, the complexity 
of the proposed decoding is proportional to (𝑀/2)& +
(3𝑀 2

decoding. 
 
IV. 
SIMULATION RESULT 
Fig. 2 shows the performance of the ML decoding for 2x2 
complex-valued channel model and proposed PD-based 
decoding scheme under AWGN channel. This paper assumes 
that the receiver perfectly knows the channel gain and uses the 
perfect dual-polarized antennas. Also, 16-ary NUC and code 
rate of 10/15 are used for the simulation. Due to the use of 
perfect dual-polarized antennas, the upper triangular matrix R 
by QR-decomposition of 𝐇H
′  becomes a diagonal matrix. 
Then, the interference cancellation at each layer can be 
negligible. The proposed decoding scheme shows a negligible 
performance loss compared with the ML decoding. Note that 
the complexity of the proposed PD-based decoding scheme 
with NUC is higher than the original PD scheme with uniform 
QAM due to the inseparable property of several bits in NUC. 
 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, a suboptimal decoding scheme based on the 
QR-decomposition and PD for ATSC 3.0 MIMO system was 
proposed. In order to apply the concept of PD to ATSC 3.0 
MIMO, the 4x4 real-valued channel model and the non-
uniformly distributed shape of the constellation, i.e., NUC, in 
ATSC 3.0 were utilized. The complexity for the proposed 
decoding scheme can be reduced with a negligible 
performance loss compared with the ML decoding. 
In the future work, more realistic channel models 
including multipath and time-varying channels should be 
considered to further analyze the performance and verify the 
availability of the proposed decoding scheme. Also, numerous 
sub-optimal decoders for MIMO decoding can be studied to 
compare the performance and complexity. Note that the 
inseparable property of NUCs should be considered for these 
further studies.
