Abstract—Recently, many advances have been made in 3D 
technology. However, the influence of stereoscopic vision on 
human 
sight 
remains 
insufficiently 
understood. 
"Accommodation convergence discrepancy theory" states that 
when a person views stereoscopic images, a visual discrepancy 
occurs because convergence focuses at the position of the 
virtual object, while lens accommodation is fixed on the screen. 
It is widely accepted in the field that this is the main reason for 
visual fatigue caused while viewing 3D images. However, we 
have not found such a mismatch in experiments with young 
subjects. The aim in this study was to compare the fixation 
distance of accommodation and convergence in viewing real 
objects and 3D video clips. We measured accommodation and 
convergence in subjects who watched both real objects and 3D 
video clips with similar movements. From the result of this 
experiment, we found that no discrepancy exists in viewing 
either 3D video clips or real objects. We argue that the 
symptoms that occur when viewing stereoscopic vision may not 
be due to a discrepancy between lens accommodation and 
convergence. To compare the accommodative response and 
amplitude in different age groups, we fit the experimental 
results to the operation of a sine curve.

 INTRODUCTION 
Investigations of the influences of stereoscopic vision on 
the human body are essential in order to ensure safe and 
comfortable viewing of virtual 3D objects. In a previous 
study with associates, we verified that both convergence and 
lens accommodation are connected with the motion of the 
virtual object when viewing 3D images  [1][2][3][4].  
On the other hand, when viewing stereoscopic images, 
people sometimes feel visual fatigue, 3D sickness, or 
other discomfort [5]. And one of the main theories for the 
cause of this visual fatigue is still the "accommodation 
convergence discrepancy theory". According to this theory, 
when viewing 3D images lens accommodation remains fixed 
on the screen while convergence moves to the position of the 
virtual object [6][7]. 
The 
relationship 
between 
accommodation 
and 
convergence is one factor that enables humans to see one 
object with both eyes. Toates [8][9] said that the proximity 
of the target appears to cause vergence, and that 
accommodation, to be a specific accommodative effort, is 
associated with innervation to vergence. Accommodation 
and vergence are mutually interacting control systems. It is 
possible under normal conditions for accommodation to 
depend on convergence to a certain extent. 
Convergence occurs when an image is captured 
differently with both eyes (parallax). The recent methods of 
3-dimensional images, for example, liquid crystal shutter 
systems, lenticular systems, and polarized filter systems have 
improved to make it easier for human convergence. The 
latest technology in this area in visual 3D production has 
shown many improvements focusing on convergence 
[10][11]. 
We conducted these experiments and discussion shown 
below based on our previous work. 
1. Lens accommodation was measured and compared 
with both a real object and a 3-D image. 
2. More than 100 subjects were divided into four age 
groups and were tested. We applied the lens accommodative 
response data from these subjects to fit the operation of a 
sine curve. Then we summarized the fitting of the sine curve 
by age group. After this, we evaluated the accommodative 
ability or the delay in accommodative response by age. 
3. Rejection of the "accommodation convergence 
discrepancy theory" leads to the question of whether the 
subjects saw blurred images when they focused on the virtual 
object instead of display. One reason for not seeing any 
blurring would be the existence of depth of field. When 
subjects watch the target, the pupil is contracted by the 
luminance. It is advantageous in order to obtain a deep depth 
of field [12][13].

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Explanation of the instrument used for the experiment 
and the experiment method was shown below. 
A. Instruments 
1) WAM-5500 
We used the WAM-5500 by Shigiya Machinery Works, 
Ltd. in this experiment (Figure 1a).  
This instrument can measure the refractive value 
(accommodation value) of a single eye when the subject 
gazes at a target of a given distance. It can measure pupil 
diameter continuously and monocular accommodation and 
pupillary diameter at a sampling interval of 0.2 seconds. The 
WAM-5500 has also been used in investigations of eyestrain

and transient myopia [14][15] based on accommodative 
values. Moreover, the WAM-5500 has been used in 
investigations of lens accommodation response under near 
work conditions and visual discomfort over a year [16][17], 
and its reliability was found to be sufficient. 
2) EMR-9 
The EMR-9 Eye Mark Recorder (NAC Image 
Technology Inc.) can measure the binocular scan paths (eye 
movements) using the pupillary/corneal reflex method. The 
resolution for eye movement is 0.1 degrees, with a 
measurement range of 40 degrees and sampling rate of 60 Hz. 
The convergent focus distance can be easily calculated from 
the obtained binocular eye movement data based on the 
calibration for 9 points (3×3), as shown in Figure 1b. 
3) WMT-1 
The WMT-1 by Shigiya Machinery Works, Ltd. is a 
target movement viewing system. It consists of a movable 
plate (about 1 m in length), a control device, and software 
that can be connected to a PC, and is the same as that of a 
numerical control (NC) robot.  
By combining the WAM-5500 and WMT-1, we built a 
system to measure the accommodation value for a moving 
visual target. By connecting with the PC and having controls 
from exclusive communication software (WCS-1) (Figure 
1c), it was possible to ascertain the position information for 
visual targets at 0.01-second intervals. Accommodation was 
measured continuously and pupil diameter was measured at 
0.2 seconds intervals.  
B. Methods 
1) Experiment 
I. 
Simultaneous 
Measurement 
of 
Accommodation and Convergence for a 3D Video Clip in 
Diopter Sine Drive and Step Drive 
For the simultaneous measurement of accommodation 
and convergence, we combined the WAM-5500 and EMR-9 
and connected them with a link cable. We set the start times 
of the two data collecting devices.  
The images used were from OLYMPUS Advanced 
POWER 3DTM, which is a CG 3-dimensional video. The 
images were created using the stereo image fabrication 
technique from OLYMPUS Memory Works, Ltd. This 
technique involves the use of two cameras showing a 
background image, and two cameras showing an object in 
motion so that the views are superimposed (Figure 2).  
In a previous study, we found that the reaction of the 
subject’s lens accommodation with OLYMPUS Advanced 
POWER 3D shows a nearer value to natural vision than 
conventional 3D images [2]. 
Fujine et al. [18][19] suggested that the viewing distance 
should be a minimum of three times the absolute display 
height. We decided to follow this recommendation as part of 
our procedure. The specification of the display and the 3D 
image are shown in tables I and II).  
For the first 10 seconds, subjects viewed a white circle in 
the center of a black screen. Then a moving sphere appeared, 
going back and forth between 1.0D (1 m) and 2.0D (50 cm). 
The subjects used binocular vision, and simultaneous 
measurements of accommodation and convergence were 
made with the WAM-5500 and the EMR-9, respectively.  
There were three patterns of movement. The first pattern 
was a sine curve drive in a 10-second period for 30 seconds. 
The second pattern was a sine curve drive in a 2.5-second 
period for 10 seconds. The third pattern stopped for 10  
seconds at distances of 1.0 D (1 m), 1.5 D (67 cm), and 2.0 D 
(50 cm) from the front of the eye of the subject (step drive). 
The order of precise stoppage was 1.0 D, 1.5 D, and 2.0 D. 
The low-screen brightness was 12.7 cd/m2 and the high-
screen brightness was 70.4 cd/m2. We measured the 
luminance in a white part of the sphere through a circular 
polarized filter and a dichroic mirror on the WAM-5500. 
2) Experiment 
II. 
Simultaneous 
Measurement 
of 
Accommodation and Convergence for a Real Object in Sine 
Curve Drive and Step Drive 
A Rubik's Cube was used as the real visual target because 
of its ease of recognition as a geometric form. This visual 
target was fixed to the movable plate of the WMT-1, and the 
PC controlled the movement of the target forward and 
backward. During measurement, the subjects were instructed 
to gaze at the visual target. 
The PC recorded various data, including the time code 
from the measurement start time, the position information on 
                    (a) WAM-5500                                   (b) EMR-9                                                               (c) WMT-1 and WAM-5500

 the visual target from the WMT-1, the accommodation 
value and the pupil diameter from the WAM-5500. The 
WMT-1 was used in two movement patterns (the diopter-
sine drive and the step-drive). The diopter-sine drive 
includes two different periods (10 and 2.5 seconds) of 
movement, the same as in Experiment I. The step drive 
suspended a real object for 10 seconds at three points: 1.0 D, 
1.5 D, and 2.0 D, the same as in Experiment I. 
3) Experiment III. Measurement of Accommodation for 
Diopter Sine Drive of Real Object and Fitting to a Sine 
Curve   
We measured accommodative change while the subjects 
gazed at a moving object (the Rubik's Cube). At this time, 
the subjects were asked to gaze at the center of the Rubik's 
Cube. The moving object oscillated between 1.0D and 2.0D 
from the front of the eye of the subject.  
There were two patterns of movement, as in Experiment I. 
The first pattern was a sine curve drive with a 10-seconds 
period for 30 seconds. The second pattern was a sine curve 
drive with a 2.5-seconds period for 10 seconds. 
4) Subjects 
For Experiments I and II, the subjects were seven 
individuals from the age of 21 to 47 years old who 
participated 
in 
the 
simultaneous 
measurement 
of 
accommodation and convergence when viewing the 3D 
video clip and real object.  
For Experiment III, the subjects were 135 individuals 
from the age of 17 years old to 85 years old who participated 
in the accommodation measurement with the real object.  
The subjects were divided into the following four groups: 
young (n=40, 17-29 years old), young-middle age (n=23, 30-
44 years old), middle-aged (n=37, 45-64 years old), and the 
elderly (n=34, aged 65 and over).

The crystalline lens loses elasticity with age and its 
refractive power also decreases. The clinically measured 
amplitude of accommodation, which includes both the true 
dioptric change in the power of the eye and ocular depth-of-
focus, decreases fairly steadily from about 13 D at the age of 
16 to 2 D at the age of 50 and thereafter [20][21]. Therefore, 
these groups were divided according to visual function 
characteristics, especially accommodative ability. For 
example, the young group had sufficient accommodative 
power. The young-middle age group had somewhat weak 
accommodation power and does not suffer from presbyopia. 
They can clearly see close objects 20 to 30 cm from their 
eyes without much effort. The middle-aged group had mild 
difficulty in seeing near objects because of presbyopia.  
In this group, some individuals wore glasses for near-
sighted issues and others did not. The elderly group had 
severe presbyopia, so they generally wore convex glasses. 
5) Method of Analysis for Experiment III  
We selected samples that successfully measured two 
periods or more. Each datum was fitted to a sine curve. The 
processed data were averaged for each age group. 
In the following equations, α represents the average, κ0 
represents half the amplitude, and κ1 represents delay.   
 
           ｙ＝ α + κ0 ⋅ sin（36 ⋅ｘ + κ1）                   (1)  
           ｙ＝ α + κ0 ⋅ sin（144 ⋅ｘ + κ1）                  (2)

Figure 3.  Simultaneous measurement values for accommodation and 
convergence with a real object (24-year-old male) 
 
Figure 4.  Simultaneous measurement values for accommodation and 
convergence with 3D images (24-year-old male) 
Since the movement of the visual target was a sine curve, 
each subject's measurement data was fitted to the sine curve.  
The Rsquare.exe of the software used a curved reliance 
panel with a least-squares method for fitting to a sine curve.  
The amplitude and delay of the measurement data were 
totaled and averaged for every group, and modeling based on 
equations (1) and (2) which were performed for the 10-
seconds period (1) and 2.5-seconds period (2).  
6) Technical Limit of the Measuring Instrument  
The sampling frequency of the WAM-5500 during 
operation is 5 Hz. This value is not sufficient to measure the 
frequency of accommodative reaction, especially in 2.5-
second period movement. In the lower sampling rate, when 
measuring rapid reciprocating motion as a 2.5-seconds 
period, careful operation is required to obtain accurate 
measurements. (According to H. Anderson et al., the delay of 
an accommodative reaction is about 0.3 seconds [22]).  
However, the time resolution for the accommodation 
value of WAM-5500 (0.2 seconds) is considered relatively 
low. Furthermore, since the pupil diameter becomes smaller 
with age, the measurement success rate with elderly subjects 
is reduced. Therefore, the number of samples decreases.  
The data in this study were restricted to subjects in whom 
measurements were possible under the following conditions: 
visual performance is high and pupil diameter is sufficiently 
large.

RESULTS 
The experiments I and II compared the real object with 
the 3-D image, and  experiment III was based upon the age 
group.  
A. Experiments I and II: Comparison of Accommodation 
and Convergence about Real and 3D Objects 
1) Sine Curve Drive 
In the case of the young subjects, convergence and 
accommodation were similar and synchronized for the 
movements of both real and 3D image objects. The 
convergence values were in agreement with the position of 
the 
visual 
target 
in 
a 
bright 
environment. 
The 
accommodative values were in a similar position to 
convergence or slightly distant from the visual target 
(Figures 3 and 4). 
2)  Step Drive (1.0D, 1.5D, and 2.0D) 
Figure 5 shows the values of the simultaneous 
measurements of accommodation and convergence with the 
real object during the step drive. Figure 6 shows the 
simultaneous measurement values for accommodation and 
convergence with 3D images during the step drive. 
In the case of the younger subjects, accommodation and 
convergence were similar for the step movements of both the 
real and 3D image objects. The convergence values were in 
agreement with the position of visual targets (real and virtual 
targets). Accommodative values were slightly further away 
from the visual target.

year-old male) 
 
Figure 8.  Typical example of younger subject, 2.5 seconds period (24-
year-old male) 
With both the real object and 3D images, lens 
accommodation had focused at a place 0.3-0.4D distant from 
the position of the visual target [4][21]. In step movement 
with 3D images, the value for accommodation moved clearly 
away from the visual target.  
B. Experiment III: Comparison between Age Groups of 
Lens Accommodation while Gazing at Sine Curve 
Movement of a Real Object 
1) Younger Subjects (17-29 years of age) 
Figures 7 (10 seconds period) and 8 (2.5 seconds period) 
show the results for accommodation and pupil diameter in 
the younger subjects for sine curve real object movement. 
The accommodation and pupil diameter values in 15 of 
40 subjects are superimposed and averaged in Figure 9 (10 
seconds period). Figure 10 shows an analysis of 20 of the 40 
subjects (2.5 seconds period).  
Figure 7 shows the results for a subject (23 years old, 
male) who viewed a visual target during a period of 10 
seconds.  
 
Figure 9.  Younger subject fitting results, 10 seconds period 
 
Figure 10.  Younger subject fitting results, 2.5 seconds period 
The values for accommodation matched those with the 
real object movement. On the other hand, the pupil diameter 
showed little variation, with a mean value of 2.8 mm. 
Figure 8 shows of the results for a different subject (24 
years old, male) who viewed visual target with a period of 
2.5 seconds.  
The values for lens accommodation were synchronized 
with the movement of the visual target. The visual target of 
the real object moved back and forth from 2.0 D (50 cm) to 
1.0 D (1 m).   The mean for the lens focus was recorded from 
1.80 D (56 cm) to 0.87 D (1.15 m). The pupil diameter 
showed a slight variation with a similar phase to the sine 
curve movement of the visual target.  
As explained in the Methods section, we used 
Rsquare.exe software, which performs a curved reliance 
panel using a least-squares method. It was fit to a sine curve.  
Figure 9 shows the fitting results for the young subjects 
with a period of 10 seconds. 
We superimposed the data of the 15 cases that were 
successfully measured out of 40 people.

period (41-year-old male) 
 
Figure 12.  Typical example of young middle-aged subject, 2.5 seconds 
period (36-year-old female) 
The calculated values of the sine curve fitting showed a 
movement of between 1.05 D (95 cm) and 1.80 D (56 cm). 
The value of the amplitude is reduced to 75% of the visual 
target, and the average value of the sine curve was reduced 
approximately 0.075 D. The delay was about 0.4 seconds for 
the visual target. 
Figure 10 shows the fitting results for the young subjects 
with the period of 2.5 seconds. We superimposed data of the 
20 cases that were successfully measured out of 40 people. 
The calculated values of the sine curve fitting were between 
1.05 D (95 cm) and 1.70 D (59 cm). The value of the 
amplitude was reduced to 65% of the amplitude of the visual 
target (1.0-2.0 D), and the average value of the sine curve 
was reduced approximately 0.13 D. The delay was about 0.2 
second against visual target. 
2) Young Middle-aged Subjects (30−44 years old) 
Figures 11 (10 seconds period) and 12 (2.5 seconds 
period) show the results of the accommodation and the pupil 
diameter for sine curve real object movement of the young 
middle-age subjects.  
 
 
Figure 13.  Young-middle subject fitting results, 10 seconds period  
 
Figure 14.  Young-middle subject fitting results, 2.5 seconds period 
The accommodation and pupil diameter values in 10 
subjects out of 23 were superimposed and averaged.  
Figure 11 shows the example of one subject (41 years old, 
male) who viewed visual target with a 10-seconds period for 
30 seconds. The values for accommodation were partially 
matched with the real object movement. 
The values for accommodation were between 0.94 D 
(1.06 m) and 1.80 D (56 cm). The average value of the sine 
curve was reduced approximately 0.29 D. On the other hand, 
the pupil diameter showed little variation and had a mean 
value of 3.8 mm.  
Figure 12 shows the results from a subject (36 years old, 
female) who viewed the visual target with a 2.5-seconds 
period for 10 seconds. The lens accommodation values were 
synchronized with the movement of the visual target. 
The visual target of the real object moved back and forth 
from 1.0 D (1 m) to 2.0 D (50 cm). The mean lens focus 
(accommodation) was recorded from 0.96 D (1.04 m) to 2.11 
D (47 cm). The pupil diameter showed no relation to the 
visual target. A characteristic reaction was seen during the 
4th period.

The pupil seemed to be constricted pupil like in a near 
reaction. 
Figure 13 shows the fitting results for the young middle-
age subjects with the period of 10 seconds. We averaged the 
data of 10 cases in which measurements were successful. 
The calculated values of the sine curve fitting moved 
back and forth between 0.83 D (1.20 m) and 1.64 D (61 cm). 
These values were reduced to 75 % of the amplitude of the 
visual target, and the average value of the sine curve was 
reduced approximately 0.27 D. The delay was about 0.3 
seconds against the movement of the visual target. 
Figure 14 shows the fitting results for the young middle-
aged subjects with the period of 2.5 seconds. We averaged 
the data for 10 of 23 cases in which in the measurements 
were successful. The calculated values of the sine curve 
fitting moved back and forth between 1.13 D (88 cm) and 
1.79 D (56 cm). The value of the amplitude is reduced to 
75 % of the visual target. The delay was about 0.3 seconds 
against the movement of the visual target.

Figures 15 (10 seconds period) and 16 (2.5 seconds

for sine curve real object movement for the middle-aged 
subjects. 
The accommodation and pupil diameter values for 9 of 
37 subjects were superimposed and averaged, as shown in 
Figures 15 (10 seconds period) and 16 (2.5 seconds period). 
Figure 15 shows an example of one subject (46 years old, 
female) who viewed the visual target with the period of 10 
seconds. The values of accommodation were partially 
matched with the movement of the real object. The values of 
accommodation of the back and forth movement were 
between 1.20 D (83 m) and 1.80 D (56 cm). The pupil 
diameter showed little variation, with a mean value of 3.4 
mm. Figure 16 shows an example of another subject (46 
years old, female) who viewed the visual target for the 
period of 2.5 seconds. The values of lens accommodation 
were synchronized with the movement of the visual target.  
The values of lens accommodation were synchronized 
with the movement of the visual target.

Figure 20.  Typical example of elderly subject, 2.5 seconds period (72-year-

The real object visual target moved back and forth from 
1.0 D (1 m) to 2.0 D (50 cm). The mean lens focus 
(accommodation) for this movement was recorded from 1.5 
D (67 cm) to 2.44 D (40 cm). The delay was about 0.2 
seconds. The pupil diameter was nearly unrelated to the 
visual target. There seemed to be some pupil constriction that 
was a slight reflective reaction. This subject was near-sighted 
at about -1.25 D. The values of lens accommodation were 
synchronized with the movement of the visual target. The 
real object visual target moved back and forth from 1.0 D (1 
m) to 2.0 D (50 cm). The mean lens focus (accommodation) 
for this movement was recorded from 1.5 D (67 cm) to 2.44 
D (40 cm). The delay was about 0.2 seconds. The pupil 
diameter was nearly unrelated to the visual target. There 
seemed to be some pupil constriction that was a slight 
reflective reaction. This subject was near-sighted at 
approximately -1.25 D. 
Figure 17 shows the fitting results for the middle-aged 
subjects for the period of 10 seconds. We superimposed the 
data for the 9 cases that were successfully measured among 
the 37 subjects.

The calculated values of the sine curve fitting showed 
that the back and forth movement was between 0.97 D (1.03 
m) and 1.41 D (71 cm). The value of the amplitude was 
reduced to 44% of the visual target. The value of 
accommodation was reduced approximately 0.6 D on the 
near-point side. The delay was about 0.4 seconds against the 
movement of the visual target.  
Figure 18 shows the fitting result for the middle-aged 
subjects with the period of 2.5 seconds. We superimposed 
data of the 9 cases that were successfully measured among 
the 37 subjects. The calculated values of the sine curve 
fitting showed back and forth movement between 0.95 D 
(1.05 m) and 1.50 D (67 cm). The value of the amplitude was 
reduced to 75 % of the visual target. The delay was about 0.2 
seconds against the movement of the visual target. 
Generally, people in their 40’s suffer from presbyopia 
and need to use glasses. Therefore, almost all the subjects of 
this group were considered to be affected by presbyopia.

subjects. The accommodation and pupil diameter values for 
4 out of 34 subjects were superimposed and averaged, as 
shown in Figure 21 (10 seconds period).  
Figure 19 shows a typical subject (72 years old, female) 
who viewed the visual target for a period of 10 seconds. The 
values for accommodation were almost unchanged for the 
real object movement. The values for accommodation 
showed a very weak back and forth movement between 0.47 
D (2.13 m) and 0.90 D (1.11 m). The pupil diameter showed 
typical synchronization with the distance of the visual target. 
When the target was close to the subject, the pupil diameter 
was about 2.8 mm. When the target moved away, the pupil 
diameter was about 3.8 mm. The elderly subjects seemed to 
compensate for their poor accommodative power by using 
extreme pupil constriction to capture close targets clearly. 
Figure 20 shows a typical subject (72 years old, female) 
who viewed the visual target for the period 2.5 seconds. The 
values of lens accommodation were almost unchanged with 
the movement of the visual target. The mean of the lens 
focus (accommodation) showed a back and forth movement 
from 0.59 D (1.69 m) to 0.82 D (1.22 m). The delay was 
about 0.9 seconds. The pupil diameter showed typical 
synchronization with the distance of the visual target. When 
the target was close to the subject, the pupil diameter was 
about 2.8 mm. When the target was far away from the 
subject, the pupil diameter was about 3.6 mm. These subjects 
also used extreme pupil contraction to compensate for the 
reduction in their lens accommodation ability.  
Figure 21 shows the fitting results of the elderly subjects 
for the period of 10 seconds. We superimposed data of the 4 
cases that were successfully measured among the 34 subjects. 
The calculated values of the sine curve fitting showed a back 
and forth movement between 0.61 D (1.64 m) and 0.83 D 
(1.20 cm). 
The value of the amplitude was reduced to 22 % of the 
visual target. The value of accommodation was reduced 
approximately 1.17 D on the near-point side. The delay was 
about 0.9 seconds against the movement of the visual target. 
IV. 
 DISCUSSION 
This section presents a discussion of experiments I and II 
(simultaneous 
measurement 
of 
accommodation 
and 
convergence) followed by a summation of experiment III 
(fitting to a sine curve).  
A. Experiments I and II: Comparison of Simultaneous 
Measurement Results of Lens Accommodation and 
Convergence 
Hoffman et al. stated that there is an inconsistency 
between accommodation and convergence, and they said that 
lens accommodation in viewing 3D images should be fixed 
at the position of the display [6]. However, they used a very 
short viewing distance (30 cm) that produced a small depth 
of field. Shibata et al. also reported an inconsistency between 
accommodation and convergence [23]. Their experimental 
stimuli were random dot stereograms depicting sinusoidal 
depth corrugations. . They used a unique test with a spatial-
frequency modulated depth stimulus of small amplitude. 
The amplitude was small (peak–trough disparity = 4 
arcmin), and spatial frequency was high (1, 1.4, and 2 cpd). 
Their stimuli were displayed on two static image planes, 
spaced 1.2 D apart. However, these two studies did not 
actually measure accommodation and convergence in their 
subjects simultaneously. In contrast, we used the Power 
3DTM (Olympus Memory Works, Corp.) for the stimulus in 
this experiment. This technique involves the use of two 
cameras showing a background image, and two cameras 
showing an object in motion, so that the views are 
superimposed. It is able to show multiple focal planes 
corresponding to different focal lengths and convergence 
angles. It presents a very natural dynamic in the movement 
of the image in consideration of the natural human eye. 
Therefore, in our experiment, accommodation for the 
artificial 3D image closely followed the virtual position of 
the moving target, as if the image were a real moving object. 
Other researchers have reported that an accommodation-
convergence discrepancy can create problems such as 
eyestrain and visual discomfort [8][9][24][25]. 
However, in this experiment, we found no mismatch in 
accommodation and convergence, at least in the younger 
subjects participating in the study. 
According to our previous studies, accommodation does 
not agree strictly with a real object (or with a virtual image) 
but does agree with a position slightly behind the object 
[4][26]. 
Our 
past 
studies 
have 
shown 
that 
the 
accommodation gap behind the object in younger subjects 
was within 0.4 D. The gap in the present experiment was 
also in this range. When subjects viewed 3D video clips in 
this study, both accommodation and convergence nearly 
agreed with the virtual position of the 3D video clips. 
Experiment 
III: 
Amplitude 
of 
Accommodation 
According to Age with Real Object, and Average Delay 
The data from the subjects were classified into four 
groups. For the 10 seconds period, the groups were young: 
15/40, young middle-aged: 10/23, middle-aged: 9/37, and 
elderly: 4/34. For the 2.5 seconds period, they were young: 
20/40, young middle-aged: 10/23, middle-aged: 9/37, and 
elderly: 3/34. Figures 9,10,13,14 and 21 show the fitting of 
the data to the sine curve for each subject, and the average of 
each amplitude and delay. In general, the amplitude for 
accommodation becomes smaller with age and the delay of 
accommodative response becomes longer [27][28]. The 
amplitude changes and becomes significantly smaller 
beginning in middle age. However, the delay for 
accommodative response was nearly the same at 0.3 seconds 
for all groups except the elderly group. The elderly group 
showed a notable delay of 0.9 seconds in accommodative 
response. 
B. Relation between Depth of Field and Blurring 
Patterson 
[29] 
reported 
that 
the 
accommodation 
convergence conflict should be a problem only in near-eye 
displays, and that it likely would not occur under most stereo 
display viewing conditions because of the depth of field [30].

Figure 22.  Acuity of fifth grade elementary school student without 
astigmatism 
Two factors that affect a person’s perception of depth of 
field are pupil size and resolution. A person’s depth of field 
changes as the pupil diameter decreases linearly with an 
increase in luminance [31][32]. The pupil diameter will be 
slightly over 6 mm for a luminance level of 0.03 cd/m2 and 
near 2 mm for a luminance level of 300 cd/m2. For each 
millimeter of decrease in pupil diameter, the depth of field 
increases by about 0.12 D [33][29]. The depth of field is also 
affected by the spatial resolution. Ogle and Schwartz [34] 
found that the total depth of focus increased by 
approximately 0.35 D per 0.25 as the arcmin increased in the 
angular target size. They showed that the total depth of focus 
was an average of 0.66 D for a 1.0-arcmin target and 2.0 D 
for a 2-arcmin target. In our experiment, the screen was set at 
1.0 D (1 m) from the subject and the object emerged to the 
point of 2.0 D. Most of our subjects accommodated at 0.4 D 
behind the object at 1.6 D (93 cm). Typically, a perfect 
match for accommodation and convergence in such a case 
would be at 2.0 D (50 cm); however, most individuals would 
show lens accommodation at 0.4 D, which is the boundary 
point of the depth of field. The usual TV screen has a 
brightness of 300 cd/m2. If the illumination occurs on an 
indoor screen, the diameter of a pupil will be about 2.0 mm, 
and the depth of field will be about ±0.5 D. None of the 
subjects in this study commented on any blurring. 
C. Relation between Refractive Power and Blurring 
When lens accommodation moves forward to the 
position of a virtual object when viewing a 3D image, the 
object displayed on the screen appears the same as the image, 
as if the person had myopia. Therefore, if the character is not 
too small it can be viewed satisfactorily [34]. For example, it 
is considered that if you focus the lens accommodation to a 
virtual object “popping out” 50 cm from the display at a 
viewing distance of 1 m, the image shown on the screen can 
be seen the same as an image viewed with a decimal visual 
acuity of 0.5 (refer to Figures 22 and 23).   
Patterson [29] stated that the interval of the depth of field 
was on the order of 1.0 D on average.  
 
 
Figure 23.  Lens accommodation focused at the pop-out position (50 cm 
apart from the display)  
Therefore, when a subject’s gazing point is at 0.5 m, the 
range of total depth of field would be from a distance of 
about 0.1 m in front of a fixed point to about 0.17 m behind 
the fixed point. For a fixed distance of 1 m, the interval of 
the depth of field would be from a distance of about 0.33 m 
in front of the point to about 1.0 m behind the visual point. 
For a fixed distance of 2.0 m, the interval range of the depth 
of field would be from about 1 m in front of the point to an 
infinite distance behind the fixed point. Wang et al. [35] also 
showed that the depth of field increased with age because of 
the constriction in pupil diameter. According to these authors, 
the typical depth of field values for young observers was 
approximately 0.8 D to 1.2 D. In our present study, none of 
the subjects reported blurred images. This might be because 
the target was set in the depth of field range when subjects 
were viewing 3D images. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
In younger subjects, the real object and 3D image were 
interlocked with the movement of the object, without large 
deviation between accommodation and convergence, and the 
focus position changed. 
Since the elasticity of the crystalline lens is lost with age 
and accommodative power decreases, there is a discrepancy 
between accommodation and convergence in the middle-
aged and the elderly, even if it is a natural vision state. 3D 
images on a screen can be seen without much blurring even 
if the accommodation focus moves to the position of the 
virtual object when the 3D image visual target is popping out. 
Subjects can recognize an object with little or no blurring 
despite the separation of accommodation from the screen 
because the position of their focus is within the depth of field. 
Patterson [29] and Patterson and Silzars [36] proposed that 
the eyestrain and viewing discomfort that accompany the 
viewing of stereo displays comes from a high level of 
conflict between the presence of binocular parallax in the 
display and the absence of motion parallax.  
In the future, we would like to study in more detail how 
this high level of conflict may contribute to visual fatigue, 
3D sickness, or other discomfort in people who view 3D 
images.
