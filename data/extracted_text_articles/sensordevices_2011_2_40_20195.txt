 INTRODUCTION  
 
This research work takes place in the context of an 
industrial contract aiming at developing a robust small 
size (1 cm3) large bandwidth magnetometer. We investigated 
benefits provided by using search coils operating in the flux 
mode, instead of the classical Lenz-Faraday mode. This 
paper consists in a theoretical and experimental comparative 
study of sensors specifications (bandwidth, sensitivity, 
measuring range) depending on the operating mode. To meet 
the industrial constraints, we fixed a budget (ie we selected a 
search coil and a low noise differential instrumentation 
amplifier). The obtained results are providing new solutions 
for applications requiring large bandwidth like pulsed eddy 
current non destructive evaluation [1], biomedical or 
geomagnetic measurements in the [1Hz-1MHz] bandwidth, 
for which Lenz mode magnetometers are not well adapted. 
We present in the Section II the main characteristics of 
the sensors for the two operating mode. In Section III, we 
discuss how to optimize the signal conditioning so as to 
obtain low noise and large bandwidth magnetic field sensors. 
We show that using search coils in a Flux mode enables a 
large enhancement of both bandwidth and measuring range 
of the sensor without reduction of its sensitivity. Section IV 
is devoted to the study of a coupled search coils sensor in 
Flux mode and the design of a small size differential 
magnetometer. 
II. 
SENSORS CHARACTERISTICS AND ELECTRICAL 
EQUIVALENT MODEL IN FLUX MODE AND LENZ MODE  
In the Lenz mode, the search coil generates a voltage 
signal proportional to the flux time derivative not to the field 
density B and is connected to a voltage instrumentation 
amplifier. In the flux mode, the short circuit current, 
proportional to the field density, is measured. In that case the 
coil has to be connected to an infinite input admittance 
transimpedance amplifier [2]. Thus, search coils sensor can 
be considered as voltage or current source depending of the 
mode they are being operated. Their Thevenin equivalent 
voltage generator ETh, Thevenin impedance ZTh, Norton 
equivalent current generator IN and Norton equivalent 
admittance YN (Fig. 1) can be calculated as a function of 
both the flux density Be to measure and the coil features: 
inductance Lb, noisy resistance Rb, parasitic capacity Cb and 
flux equivalent surface Seq, which is defined as the ratio of 
the collected flux to the flux density and experimentally 
determined. One gets:

the intrinsic magnetic noise sensitivity, defined as the input

) that produces a voltage (or 
current) equal to the contribution of the Johnson noise of the 
resistance Rb, are plot as a function of the frequency in 
Fig. 2. One deduces from these figures that in the Lenz mode 
the bandwidth is intrinsically upper limited by the coil 
resonant frequency and that the measuring range is inversely 
proportional to the frequency, whereas in the flux mode the 
bandwidth is larger, since not affected by the coil resonant 
frequency, and the measuring range is constant above a low 
cut off frequency equal to

 [3]. The magnetic 
sensitivity in the Lenz mode decreases as the frequency and 
is thus better at high frequency than in the flux mode. In this 
latter case, the sensitivity is constant over the bandwidth 
sensor.  
As a brief conclusion, intrinsically, the flux mode sensor is 
well suited to applications requiring a large bandwidth and 
frequency independent measuring range whereas the Lenz 
mode magnetometer is rather adapted to applications in 
limited frequency range and provides in that case a better 
sensitivity than the Flux mode magnetometer.  
 
Signal amplification is different depending on the operation 
mode of the search coil. The signal has to be amplified for 
the Lenz mode by a voltage amplifier, with as high as 
possible input impedance Zi, and for the Flux mode Lenz 
mode by a transimpedance amplifier, with as large as 
possible input admittance Yi. These amplifiers can be 
replaced by their equivalent noisy quadripolar model as 
shown on Fig. 3 and 4. Such models are very useful for 
calculating the effective sensitivity of the sensor taking into 
account the noise due to the amplifier stage and more 
generally to state the required characteristics of both search 
coils and amplifier for given sensor specifications in terms of 
bandwidth and sensitivity.

SEARCH COILS SENSORS OPTIMIZATION 
 
The classical Lenz mode magnetometer, which is rather a 
magnetic flux derivative meter, can be converted into a B 
field meter by using an integrator output stage [4]. We 
designed a solution with the integrator embedded inside the 
amplifier (Fig. 7). The transfer function TLenz of this Lenz 
mode B field meter is in that case given by:

The magnetometer low cut off frequency can be adjusted by 
proper choice of integrator parameters. Nevertheless, the 
magnetometer bandwidth is still limited by the search coils 
resonance and the measuring range is not enlarged by the 
integrator stage. 
 
For the standard Flux mode magnetometer, the low cut 
off frequency is fixed by the search coil parameter. This low 
cut off frequency can be significantly reduced by including a 
compensation stage in the transimpedance amplifier as 
described in Fig. 8.

Using the compensation stages described ahead, whatever is 
the mode of the magnetometer, one can obtained the same 
cut off low frequency and the same transfer value in the 
magnetometer bandwidth. The Lenz mode magnetometer 
bandwidth stays nevertheless limited by the search coil 
resonant frequency.

SEARCH COILS  
A significant reduction of common mode signals as well 
as parasitic signals sensed in connecting wires is usually 
achieved by the use of a differential structure. An original 
flux mode differential magnetometer is presented in Fig. 10.

The low cut off frequency can be significantly reduced 
by including the compensation stage described in Section III. 
The theoretical study was compared to experimental 
measurements and calculations using a SPICE simulator. All 
results are in very good agreement as shown on Fig. 11.  
 
The search coils coupling leads to correlation of the 
voltage noise sources of the two input amplifiers A1 and A2 
of the instrumentation amplifier and thus to noise reduction 
of the sensor [5]. The coupling allows also a significant size 
reduction of the magnetometer since the coils can be 
wounded together on the same magnetic coil. In order to 
check the validity of the theoretical study, experimental 
measurements and calculations using a SPICE simulator 
were performed. All results fits very well as shown on 
Fig. 12.

intrinsic search coil transfer equal to 28A/T and search coil 
low cut off frequency equal to 1,5kHz. The compensation 
stage of the magnetometer (see Section III) was designed so 
as to obtain an 8 Hz low cut off frequency.

CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES 
A detailed comparison of transfer function and noise 
sensitivity of search coils magnetometer operating either in 
Lenz mode of Flux mode was presented. We explained how 
to optimize both magnetometers and showed that the Flux 
mode provides a transfer function, which can be set constant 
over a bandwidth ranging from 1 Hz to 1 MHz, larger than 
what can be achieved in Lenz mode. The Flux mode also 
provides a constant measuring range over the full bandwidth, 
which is not the case for Lenz mode magnetometer. Such 
features are very interesting for applications requiring a large 
bandwidth and a good sensitivity over the whole bandwidth. 
An original differential flux mode magnetometer, which is 
much more compact than classical Lenz mode search coil 
differential magnetometer, was proposed and studied in 
details, namely in terms of transfer function and noise. 
Theoretical analysis, SPICE simulations and experimental 
measurements are in very good agreement.
