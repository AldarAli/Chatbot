Abstract— This paper clarifies that 802.15.4k direct sequence 
spread spectrum (DSSS) systems are suitable for wide sensor 
networks with star topology. According to our evaluation, the 
robustness of 802.15.4k DSSS systems under the co-channel 
interference (CCI) is 60 dB stronger than that of 802.15.4g due to 
its DSSS (1023 spreading factor) and FEC. In addition, this paper 
clarifies the area where 802.15.4g cannot survive under 802.15.4k 
CCI and vice versa. The latter area is 50 times larger the former. 
Furthermore, we show that directive base station antennas can 
reduce the interference impacted area by 80% compared to 
omnidirectional base station antennas.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
One of the latest standardization projects of 802.15 Working 
Group is P802.15.4k Low Energy Critical Infrastructure 
Monitoring (LECIM) Networks [1]. The standard is an 
amendment to the 802.15.4 standard to enable wide area sensor 
networks. Communication systems based the standard combine 
very low power consumption with long communication ranges 
with order of kilometers. There are two PHY layer options in 
the standard, the first one is based on direct sequence spread 
spectrum (DSSS PHY), the second one is based on frequency 
shift keying (FSK PHY). The focus of this paper is the DSSS 
PHY of 802.15.4k with following three reasons: (i) DSSS PHY 
deploys direct sequence spreading and this process gain is 
mandatory for longer transmission range – if 1023 spreading 
code length is used, the system can enjoy 30 dB processing gain. 
(ii) DSSS PHY standard mandates the use of strong FEC (rate 
1/2 convolutional encoding with a constraint length of 7) while 
FSK PHY regulates it as an option and there has been none of 
FSK PHYs deploying FEC in market as of today. This may 
generate about 5 dB advantage of DSSS PHY against FSK PHY 
in AWGN channels and more than 8 dB difference in 
interference dominated environments, (iii) DSSS PHY regulate 
the use of PSK modulation which can be demodulated 
coherently while FSK PHY can’t be demodulated coherently. 
This creates another 3 dB advantage to DSSS PHY. Thus, the 
total advantage of DSSS PHY against FSK PHY is more than 
40 dB practically (with a spreading code length of 1023) and 
this is why this paper selected DSSS PHY as a targeted system 
Although there will be a lot of different sources of 
interferences in 900 MHz bands, this paper focuses on how 
802.15.4.k DSSS systems can survive against interference from 
another standard of the 802.15 family, namely 802.15.4g Smart 
Utility Networks (SUN). This is important assumption since we 
need to identify the interferer to analyze and in Japan, 802.15.4g 
is supposed to be a major interferer to IEEE802.15.4k systems. 
Both systems operate in unlicensed bands, between 920 and 928 
MHz in Japan [2]. Our analyses assume 802.15.4k systems 
operating in the presence of IEEE 802.15.4g co-channel 
interference (CCI) as well as 802.15.4g systems experiencing 
802.15.4k CCI.   
For the interference analysis, we consider two parameters 
that affect the performance of both systems under CCI. The first 
is a relative location of an 802.15.4g sub-channel with respect 
to an 802.15.4k channels. The second one is minimum desired 
signal to undesired signal ratios (D/U) of each system in 
AWGN environments. By using these two parameters, we will 
deduct “Installation inhibited area” in which the interferer 
destroys communications channels in each system. Further, the 
“installation inhibited area” is re-evaluated with a directive base 
station antenna for 802.15.4k DSSS systems showing how the 
“inhibited area” will be reduced by adopting high gain base 
station antennas instead of Omni antennas.  
The outline of the paper is as follows. In the next section, we 
introduce 802.15.4k and 802.15.4g systems and illustrate their 
mutual interference. Section III provides the permissible D/U 
ratios of both systems under CCI. In Section IV, we show the 
Installation inhibited areas of 802.15.4k and 802.15.4g systems. 
Section V elucidates “installation inhibited areas” reduction by 
adoption of directional BS antennas. Conclusions are drawn in 
Section VI.  
II. 
 SYSTEM MODELS AND CO-CHANNEL INTERFERENCE  
As mentioned in the introduction, we focus on the DSSS 
PHY of the 802.15.4k standard. It can operate in many 
unlicensed bands throughout the world including 920-928 MHz 
band in Japan with up to 1 MHz bandwidth as shown in Table 
I. Here, one sub-channel is defined as a channel with a 
bandwidth of 200 kHz and the maximum bandwidth is 1 MHz 
by bonding 5 sub-channels. The other system examined here, 
the 802.15.4g system, has a smaller bandwidth of 200 KHz or 
400 KHz. Its details are shown in Table I as well. 
The channelization of these standards enables 802.15.4g 
with a bandwidth of 200 KHz to interfere with 802.15.4k 
systems in one of its 5 sub-channels. In Figure 1, we illustrate 
the spectra of 802.15.4g operating at 50 kbps (in 200 kHz) and 
802.15.4k systems operating in 1 MHz bandwidth, where a D/U 
ratio is 0 dB. Here, D/U ratio is defined by (1), as a ratio of 
transmission powers of desired and undesired signals.

Sub-channel 3 of 802.15.4g is located at the exact center of 
the 802.15.4k signals with a bandwidth of 1 MHz.  
In Figure 2, there are three channels of 802.15.4g systems 
with a bandwidth of 400 kHz, each interfering with 802.15.4k

systems operating with 1MHz bandwidth. In this case, sub-
channel 2 of 802.15.4g systems is located at the exact center of 
the 802.15.4k signals.  
Fig. 3 shows a block diagram of the interference simulation. 
“Gain” enables us to set the transmit power of 802.15.4k and 
set expected D/U ratios. “Freq. offset” is used to set the location 
of 802.15.4g channels relative to the 802.15.4k bandwidth. 
Using this system, we evaluate BER performance of each 
system, and derive the minimum D/U ratios to meet the target 
PER (Packet error rate). 
 Fig. 4 compares simulated and theoretical BER 
performance of 802.15.4k and 802.15.4g systems. The 
theoretical performance is evaluated by (2) and (3) as follows 
[7].  
Equation (2) provides bit error probability of BPSK 
modulation with FEC (R=1/2, k=7, Soft decision), and equation 
(3) yields that of Gaussian filtered FSK (GFSK) modulation. As 
indicated by the simulated and theoretical performance, the 
802.15.4k and 802.15.4g simulation systems work correctly. In 
next section, we use the simulation system to evaluate the 
interference of both systems.

III. 
THE MINIMUM D/U RATIOS OF BOTH SYSTEMS  
A. 802.15.4k DSSS system performance 
We evaluate first the minimum D/U ratios of 802.15.4k 
systems with a spreading factor of 1023 to meet the target PER 
under CCI of 802.15.4g operating at different data rates 
(bandwidths). Fig. 5 plots the minimum D/U ratios versus 
Eb/N0 to meet the target PER with parameters of bandwidth 
and relative channel locations of 802.15.4g signals against 
802.15.4k signals. For 802.15.4k systems, the target bit error 
rate (BER) is calculated as 3.9x10-5 to transmit 32-byte packets 
with less than 1 % packet error rate.  
The minimum D/U ratio of 802.15.4k (with 1023 spreading 
factor) under CCI from 802.15.4g tends to be less than -60 dB 
for Eb/N0 values higher than 15 dB, regardless of 802.15.4g 
bandwidths and sub-channels. In the case of narrower 
bandwidth interference, 200 kHz bandwidth 802.15.4g 
interference, the inteference on the center of the 802.15.4k 
channel generates the largest degradation in the low Eb/N0 
region. In the case of 400 kHz bandwidth interference, both 
non-centered 802.15.4g signals (sub-channels 1  and 3) give 
less degradation due to the drop in interference power created 
by passage through a  802.15.4k receiver filter. 
B. 802.15.4g GFSK system performance 
 Fig. 6 plots Eb/N0 versus minimum D/U ratio of 802.15.4g 
under CCI from 802.15.4k with spreading factor of 1023. The 
target BER is the same value as the previous one. The minimum 
D/U ratios of 802.15.4g show up to 4 dB difference depending 
on the bandwidths and relative interfering channels (sub-
channels) in the high Eb/N0 region. 
From these two figures, 802.15.4k DSSS systems show 
much 
stronger 
interference-resistant 
performance 
than 
802.15.4g FSK systems such as a -60 dB D/U ratio requirement 
for DSSS systems and 2-4 dB D/U ratio requirement for 
802.15.4g FSK systems to realize a PER of 1%. This huge 
difference is due to the DSSS processing gain & de-spreading 
of the interference and FEC coding gain. 
 Using the performance results obtained above, the next 
section we will estimate the range / area in which 802.15.4g 
systems can disturb 802.15.4k communications and vice versa.

IV. 
INSTALALTION INHIBITED AREAS OF 802.15.4K 
AND 802.15.4G SYSTEMS 
In this section, we evaluate “installation inhibited area” of 
802.15.4g and 802.15.4k systems. We assume two things. First 
is that both systems operate as one-to-one communications. 
Second is that the 802.15.4k system uses a spreading factor of 
1023. Simulation parameters are shown in Table II. Fig. 7 
shows the “installation inhibited area” from the Sensor Node of 
802.15.4g to the BS or Sensor Node (SN) of 802.15.4k as an 
interferer. Fig. 8 shows the “installation inhibited area” from 
the SN of 802.15.4k to the BS or SN of 802.15.4g as an 
interferer.  
In this simulation environment, the receiver location is 
shown by (x, y) = (0, 0) meters. The transmitter is located at (x, 
y) = (0, d) meters. “d” means the communication range in Table 
II. We assume that if the D/U ratio is less than the permissible 
D/U ratios (defined in section III), communication is successful.

Areas inside the contours in each figure indicate locations 
where the interferer transmitter can disturb communication, 
namely, “installation inhibited area”. 
Figures 7 and 8 show that the 802.15.4g system is weaker 
against the interference. The “installation inhibited area” is 210 
meters range, 105 percent of the communication distance. Fig. 
8 indicates that spreading can greatly suppress 802.15.4g 
interference on 802.15.4k systems. As a result, “installation 
inhibited area” is a maximum of 100 meters, 2 percent of the 
communication distance. Finally, we conclude 802.15.4k 
systems have high tolerance to the interference due to spreading 
and FEC. The next section clarifies how the directive antenna 
reduces the interference compared with the omnidirectional one.

INSTALALTION INHIBITED AREA REDUCTION 
BY DIRECTIONAL BS ANTENNA 
In this section, we investigate the reduction of the 
interference from 802.15.4k to 802.15.4g and the one from 
802.15.4g to 802.15.4k when 802.15.4k BS employs a 
directional antenna. The BS antenna gain pattern of the 
802.15.4k system is based on a 4-element linear beam forming 
antenna as shown in Figure 9. We use this antenna with a gain 
of 10dBi and an omnidirectional antenna with a gain of 3dBi. 
Simulation parameters are the same as in Table II, except the 
transmit power for directive BS antenna is set the total transmit 
eirp does not exceed 16 dBm as regulated in Japan. Fig. 10 
shows the “installation inhibited area” of 802.15.4k under 
802.15.4g interference for the two types of antennas. The 
“installation inhibited area” is evaluated by formulas (4) and (5) 
as follows. Formula (4) yields a continuous value, while the 
formula (5) yields a discrete value.

With the omnidirectional antenna, the area is 0.04 km2 but 
with the directive antenna it is 0.01 km2. The directional 
antenna reduces the area by 75 percent relative to the 
omnidirectional antenna. Fig. 11 shows the “installation 
inhibited area” of 802.15.4g under 802.15.4k interference. The 
omnidirectional antenna offers an area of 0.15 km2 while the 
directional antenna reduces this to 0.03 km2. The directional 
antenna reduces the area by 80 percent relative to the 
omnidirectional antenna. Therefore, BS directional antenna can 
well suppress the interference and increase spectrum efficiency.

CONCLUSIONS 
In this work, we have investigated the performance of 
802.15.4k and 802.15.4g systems under CCI. We confirmed 
that 802.15.4k DSSS Systems under CCI is 60 dB more robust 
than 802.15.4g. We have clarified “installation inhibited area” 
in which 802.15.4g or 802.15.4k cannot survive under CCI of 
the other system. The “installation inhibited area” of 802.15.4k 
turned out to be 50 times smaller than that of 802.15.4g. 
Furthermore, we have showed deployment of directional 
antennas can reduce the “installation inhibited area” (from other 
system) by 80 percent and by 75 percent (to other system). 
Therefore, 802.15.4k DSSS PHY and directional 802.15.4k BS 
antennas can reduce the interference much smaller and increase 
the spectrum efficiency a lot. 802.15.4k DSSS systems are 
suitable for wide area sensor networks with star topology and 
are much more widely deployable in interference dominated 
ISM bands than 802.15.4g systems with higher spectrum 
efficiency.
