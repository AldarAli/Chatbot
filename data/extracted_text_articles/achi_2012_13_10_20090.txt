Abstract—Teams and teamwork are indispensable, especially 
when tackling difficult and complex tasks that cannot be easily 
addressed by a single individual. Because breakdowns in team 
cooperation can cause accidents, much research attention has 
been devoted to studies on team cooperation, and many 
measurements and training of teamwork have been proposed. 
Traditional studies have often focused on observational 
teamwork behaviors to measure and enhance teamwork. In 
order to better measure and enhance teamwork, it is believed 
that it is necessary to focus on the cognitive mechanisms that 
underlie teamwork. This study focuses on metacognition in 
cooperation that underlies team cooperation, and aims to 
investigate the importance of metacognition in cooperation. 
The comparisons of metacognition in cooperation and team 
performance indexes suggest that an improvement of 
metacognition in cooperation will enhance team performance 
and that certain types of metacognition in cooperation are 
important for positive teamwork.  
Keywords - team cooperation, cognition, measurements,

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Team performance has been increasingly recognized as 
an indispensable foundation of difficult and complex tasks 
that cannot be easily addressed by a single individual, such 
as air traffic control and surgical care. The ability of an 
individual to contribute as the member of a team in a 
complex team task should be enhanced through training 
strategies that are aimed at providing competencies that 
facilitate teamwork. One of the prerequisites of team training 
is valid and reliable teamwork measurement, which underlies 
effective team performance. This is because it is necessary to 
identify the problems and characteristics of a team, provide 
constructive feedback, and evaluate the success of training 
for the training to be successful. 
One of the typical measurements of teamwork is based 
on the behavioral marker system of teamwork. Mishra et al., 
for example, have developed a measurement of non-
technical skills (NOTECHS), including teamwork [1]. They 
have divided NOTECHS into four behavioral dimensions 
(leadership and management, teamwork and cooperation, 
problem-solving 
and 
decision-making, 
and 
situation 
awareness) and defined the positive/negative behavioral 
modifiers of these dimensions. Based on these modifiers, 
trained experts evaluate NOTECHS using a four-point scale. 
Crew Resource Management (CRM) has been proposed and 
adopted as a procedure of teamwork training in different 
industries and organizations. CRM focuses on improving 
teamwork behaviors, including interpersonal communication, 
leadership, and decision-making  [2]. 
The traditional research and methods described above 
have often focused on observational teamwork behaviors to 
measure and enhance teamwork. Explicit teamwork 
behaviors can be beneficial for the assessment of teamwork; 
however, it is additionally necessary to focus on both 
implicit teamwork and the cognitive aspects of teamwork in 
order to better measure teamwork. An improvement of the 
cognitive mechanisms underlying teamwork must effectively 
be able to enhance team performance. A recent study has 
implied that an important mechanism behind team 
cooperation is metacognition in cooperation [3]. This study 
aims to show the effect of metacognition on cooperation in 
effective team behaviors and to verify useful metacognition 
in cooperation for positive teamwork. The next Section 
introduces a team cognition model about metacognition in 
cooperation. In Section III, a team experiment and an 
analysis of the elicited reflection are described. In Section IV, 
the analysis and team performance indexes are compared. N 
Section V, we conclude this study. 
II. 
A TEAM COGNITION MODEL 
Cognition in teams has been receiving much research 
attention for more than a decade, and a variety of cognition 
models for teams have been proposed. Many of these 
models have aimed to present either the status of cognition 
in teams or the sum/overlap of individual cognition [4], 
instead of describing the cognitive factors underlying 
cooperation. 
We 
examined 
these 
factors 
through 
participants’ reflections on cooperation, and proposed a 
team cognition model that describes and explains the 
cognitive processes of cooperation [3]. As a method to 
examine the underlying cognitive factors of cooperation, we 
analyzed participants’ reflections on cooperation and 
elicited 
several 
important 
factors 
of 
cooperation. 
Subsequently, based on these factors, the findings of past 
studies by team researchers, and human cognitive abilities 
[5][6][7], we developed a team cognition model to capture a 
portion of the cognitive factors of team cooperation. The 
schematic of the proposed model is shown in Fig 1. The 
model consists of two levels—object-level and meta-level—
with reference to a popular structure of metacognition that is 
defined as “cognition about cognition” [5]. The object-level 
is the ongoing progress or current status of a particular 
cognitive activity and is described by the combination of 
319

ACHI 2012 : The Fifth International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interactions

two categories—“Subjects” and “Contents”. Object-level is 
monitored and controlled by meta-level, and the abilities for 
this process are defined as “Metacognitive skills”. The 
details of each category are shown in Table I and are 
described in the following subsections.  
 
 
Figure 1.  A Team Cognition Model 
A. Subjects 
Reviews and studies about group intention imply that 
humans use two modes of perspective in collective 
activities: reductive and non-reductive [8]. In the non-
reductive perspective mode, one recognizes his or her group 
as having a mind of its own and this is distinct from 
individual members’ intentions. The notion of “group mind” 
represents this mode [6]. In the reductive perspective mode, 
on the other hand, the individual infers or simulates the 
minds of others, consciously or subconsciously, and relates 
this to his or her own intention and the inference results. 
The notion of “mutual belief” represents this mode [7]. This 
category of the model presents the two modes of perspective 
in collective activities, and consists of three elements: 
“Self,” “Partner,” and “Team”. “Self” and “Partner” 
represent the reductive perspective, and “Team” represents 
the non-reductive perspective.  
B. Contents  
This category represents content that relates to 
operations and consists of a variety of mental processes, 
actions, equipment conditions, situation awareness, mental 
status, knowledge, roles, tactics, etc. A set of one of the 
subcategories of this category and that of “Subject” 
comprises a basic element of the object-level. Non-cognitive 
elements such as equipment and roles were reported in 
introspections on team cooperation; thus, these elements are 
also included in this category.  
C. Metacognitive Skills 
Metacognitive skills are defined as monitoring and 
controlling the object-level (the set of “Subjects” and 
“Contents”) through the meta-level. This category helps 
represent cognitive factors behind teamwork behaviors and 
teamwork behaviors themselves, in combination with the 
object-level. Examples are shown in the subsequent sections.  
D. Characteristics  
An advantage of the proposed model is that it describes 
the cognitive aspects of team cooperation and explains the 
reason behind popular teamwork as a set of “Metacognitive 
Skills,” “Subjects,” and “Contents”. For example, mutual 
performance monitoring that is considered important 
teamwork behavior [9] can be described as applying 
“Evaluation (Good/Bad)/Issue” to “Activity/Status” of 
“Self/Partner/Team”; the shared mental model of role 
sharing can be described as applying “Compare (Match)” to 
the “Role” of “Team”; and behavior adjustments can be 
described as applying “Adjustment” to “Activity” of “Self”.  
Our previous study has implied that a wide scope of 
metacognition in cooperation will provoke metacognitive 
skills in both team members’ activities and interactions; this 
could encourage team members to strive to improve their 
team 
performance. 
However, 
the 
importance 
of 
metacognition in cooperation, especially metacognitive skills 
for cooperation, has not completely been clarified.

If metacognition in cooperation is important for positive 
teamwork, the reflection in cooperation by team members 
who demonstrate good team performance must include a 
variety of subjects, contents, and metacognitive skills. This 
study aims to test this hypothesis and investigate the 
importance of metacognition in cooperation. 
III. 
EXPERIMENT AND DATA ANALYSIS  
In order to investigate the importance of metacognition in 
cooperation, we use the experiment data collected in [3] and 
analyze the relationship between the coded results of the 
reflection on cooperation and team performance in detail. 
First, the team experiment is introduced. Then, the coded 
results of the reflection on cooperation are shown. Finally, 
the reflection with the team performances to clarify the 
importance of metacognition in cooperation is compared. 
A. Experiment 
1) Task: An air traffic control simulator was used for a 
task (Fig. 2). The standard operating procedures of the task 
were as follows: (1) to select an aircraft with a mouse, and 
(2) to enter a command for the selected aircraft using a 
keyboard. Participants were asked to route arriving and 
departing aircraft both safely and accurately. During the 
session, the aircraft randomly appeared on the display. The 
participants were required to perform different sub-tasks 
simultaneously, such as understand commands that were 
given to aircraft, provide appropriate commands to control 
the altitudes and flight directions of aircraft, check distances 
between aircraft, make timely decisions about landings and 
takeoffs, monitor aircraft exiting from the airspace, etc. 
Each two-person team comprised a “Selector,” who had 
only a mouse, and a “Commander,” who had only a 
keyboard. The Selector selected the aircraft to which they 
would give a command with the mouse. Then, the 
Commander would enter a command for the selected 
aircraft using the keyboard. A team member could not 
complete these tasks by himself or herself and, thus, was 
required to cooperate with the partner. Because the number 
of aircraft increased in the second and third sets, team 
members had to reallocate team resources in the second and 
third sets; otherwise, they would fail to manage the aircraft.

Twenty-six 
graduate/postgraduate 
students (13 teams) participated. 
3) Instructions 
for 
reflection: 
Two-types 
of 
metacognitive instructions were designed and applied in 
order to investigate whether differences of metacognition in 
cooperation can affect team behaviors. The participants 
were asked to reflect on these instructions.

4) Procedures: The participants practiced the operation 
until they could smoothly land and transfer an aircraft. The 
total trial duration was 15 min for all participants. The 
metacognitive instruction was presented every 7.5 minutes 
and the participants read it and wrote down their own 
cognitive status and beliefs twice in each set (Fig. 3). When 
the instruction was presented, the display turned blank and 
the simulation was suspended. The participants sat face-to-
face, and communicated freely with each other, except when 
they were responding to the instructions. Some teams could 
not participate in the third set because of their schedules.  
 
 
Figure 3.  Procedure 
5) Game scores: Two types of game score were used as 
team performance indexes: safety violation time and number 
of aircraft successfully processed. Safety violation time was 
the duration in seconds of when the distance between two 
different aircraft was less than 1,000 feet vertically and 3 
miles laterally. The number of aircraft successfully 
processed was calculated by subtracting the number of 
failed landings or improper exits from the airspace from the 
number of successful landings or successful transfers to 
other airspaces at the handoff points. 
B. Data analysis  
The reflection data were coded by a collaborator (who 
was unaware of the research purpose), based on the 
categories of the proposed model. Initially, the reflection 
data were divided into two categories: related to cooperation 
and not related to cooperation. Subsequently, each reflection 
related to cooperation was represented as a set of 
subcategories 
of 
the 
three 
primary 
viewpoints.

subcategory “someone (self or partner)” was added in the 
“Subjects” category to code the reflection correctly. There 
were two types of sets of subcategories; a set of “Subject” 
and “Contents” and a set of “Subjects,” “Contents,” and 
“Metacognitive Skills”. For example, the reflection “(I am) 
monitoring what my partner is not monitoring” was coded as 
“Self + Cognition + Adjustment,” and the reflection “We 
demonstrate better performance than ever” was coded as 
“Team + Status + Evaluation (Good)”. In addition, the 
reflection data that were not related to cooperation were 
represented as “Self” and “Contents” or a set of “Self,” 
“Contents,” and “Metacognitive Skills”. 
IV. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
To investigate the importance of metacognition in 
cooperation, we conducted two types of analysis. In the first 
analysis, we compared both the reflection and the transitions 
of the game scores between the team-oriented instruction and 
the self-oriented instruction (Analysis I). In the second 
analysis, we compared the coded results of the reflection 
with the mean scores of each team to clarify the effect of 
metacognition on the cooperation of members with relatively 
good performance across the sets (Analysis II). 
A. The Scores 
In order to compare the transitions of the scores of the 
teams that obtained similar scores in the first set between the 
two metacognitive instructions, the teams were classified 
into three groups according to the number of aircraft 
successfully processed in the first set: high (6~10), middle 
(3~5), and low (0~2). Because the simulator was accidently 
stopped during the experiment by one team for each 
instruction, their two values of performance data were 
excluded from the comparison on the scores. The teams that 
answered the team-oriented instruction and the self-oriented 
instruction were named T1~T6 and S1~S5, respectively.  
Table III shows the transitions of the scores of the teams. 
T1 and S1 got the same degree of both the number of aircraft 
successfully processed and the safety violation time in the 
first set. Although T1 improved in both indexes in the second 
set, S1 deteriorated in the number of aircraft successfully 
processed. T2 and S2 got the same degree in both indexes in 
the first set. Both teams deteriorated in the safety violation 
time in the second set; the degree of deterioration in S2 was 
higher than that in T2. In the third set, both indexes of S2 
improved. Both indexes of T3 and S3~S5 were similar in the 
first set; however, the safety violation time of T4 was longer 
that of T3 and S3~S5. Although the performance indexes of 
both T3 and T4 improved in the second and third set, 
respectively, those of S3~S5 worsened in the second (S5) or 
third (S3 and S4) set.  
In addition, in order to highlight the teams that got 
relatively good scores in the experiment, we divided the 
teams into two groups according to their mean scores in the 
experiment sets. Fig. 4 shows the mean scores of all sets for 
each team. T1~T4, S2, and S4 were categorized as teams that 
relatively performed well. On the other hand, T5, T6, S1, S3, 
and S5 were categorized as teams that relatively performed 
badly. Because the number of the scores was too small to 
apply significance tests between the groups and between the 
sets, we could not discuss the significance of the differences.

We statistically compared the two groups of the 
reflection to investigate the effects of the two types of

on 
the

of 
metacognition pertaining to cooperation. Then, the game 
scores that were regarded as team performance indexes were 
compared.  
Table IV shows the results of coding the reflection data 
by a collaborator who was unaware of the research purpose. 
We compared the mean number of each subcategory that was 
used to code the reflection elicited from the team-oriented 
instruction with that of the self-oriented one, using t-test per 
answer sheet for each member in each interval. Although the 
mean number of the reflection that does not relate to 
322

cooperation in the self-oriented instruction was significantly 
higher than that in the team-oriented instruction, the mean 
number of the reflection that relates to cooperation in the 
self-oriented instruction was significantly lower than that in 
the team-oriented instruction. The mean numbers of 
“Partner,” 
“Team,” 
“Role,” 
and 
“Environment 
+ 
Characteristics” in the team-oriented instruction were greater 
than those in the self-oriented instruction were. The coding 
pattern of “Role + Improvement” only existed when coding 
the reflection data that were derived from the team-oriented 
instruction. These results suggest that the team-oriented 
instruction induced metacognitive skills for cooperation 
more than the self-oriented instruction did. 
Although the scores in the second and third set of the 
team-oriented instruction team improved, those of the self-
oriented scores instruction team remained the same or 
worsened. The performance indexes after the team-oriented 
instruction may have improved because three teams (T2, T3, 
and T5) talked about their teamwork (e.g., role sharing) just 
after the team-oriented instruction. The team-oriented 
instruction induced team members to think about not only 
their own cooperation but also that of their partner and their 
team. This wide scope of metacognition in cooperation is 
expected to provoke metacognitive skills in both their 
activities and interactions; thus, it probably encourages team 
members to find problems in their teamwork and strive to 
improve their team performance.  
C. Analysis II  
Table V shows the coded results of the reflection for each 
member. The number in each cell represents the sum of 
subcategories that were used for coding the reflection 
through all the sets. Because the differences between the 
metacognitive instructions affected the viewpoint of 
metacognition pertaining to cooperation, we compared the 
coded results of the reflection with the scores for each team 
within the teams that answered the same instruction.  
Among the team-oriented instruction teams, T1~T4 were 
categorized as better-performing teams. On the other hand, 
T5 and T6 were categorized as teams that performed 
relatively badly. The fact that the reflections of T1 and T2 
were coded using more “Self” and “Partner” values implies 
that the members of both T1 and T2 tended to reflect their 
cooperation in terms of the reductive perspective. Their 
reflection, which included “Self/Partner + Equipment + 
Characteristics,” “Compare,” and “Adjustment,” implied that 
the members applied metacognitive skills that were derived 
from the metacognition of their partner. Although the

reflection of T5 included more “Self” and “Partner” values, 
the metacognitive skills of “Compare/Adjustment” were not 
included. The reflection of T5 included relatively fewer 
descriptions of cooperative relationships than those of 
“Self/Partner + Equipment + Characteristics,” and a variety 
of metacognitive skills including “Evaluation, Issue, 
Clear/Unclear,” and “Improvement”. The reflection of T3 
included relatively more “Evaluation, Issue, Clear/Unclear,” 
and “Improvement” values. The number of reflections of T6 
was relatively lower. Members of T6 tended to describe 
themselves in terms of “Team,” and there are few 
descriptions that included metacognitive skills. Among the 
self-oriented instruction teams, S2 and S4 were categorized 
as better-performing teams. On the other hand, S1, S3, and 
S5 were categorized as relatively bad. The reflection of S2 
included 
more 
descriptions 
of 
metacognitive 
skills. 
Specifically, the commander’s description in S2 included a 
variety of metacognitive skills that were probably derived 
from belief in the partner, including “Adjustment,” 
“Compare,” and “Belief in Partner”. The reflection of S4, 
whose team performance indexes improved in the second set, 
but worsened in the third set, included descriptions of the 
characteristics of the equipment and “Adjustment”. Although 
the 
reflection 
of 
the 
commander 
in 
S4 
included 
metacognitive skills through all the sets, the number of 
reflections that included metacognitive skills gradually 
decreased in the reflection of the selector. Although the 
reflection of 
S1 included 
more descriptions 
about 
cooperation and metacognitive skills such as “Compare,” 
there were no descriptions coded as “Adjustment” and 
“Belief in Partner”. There was a reflection coded as 
“Self/Partner + Equipment + Characteristics”; however, it 
was included by the final reflection. The reflection of S3 
included more descriptions in terms of “Team”. Although the 
commander of S3 applied metacognitive skills in team 
cooperation, the selector did not. There were fewer 
reflections of S5.  
These results imply the following four characteristics of 
the reflection in teams that had good cooperation: (1) 
members can easily understand the characteristics of their 
equipment; (2) members can describe their cooperation 
activities in terms of “Self” and “Partner,” rather than 
“Team”; (3) both members applied metacognitive skills in 
cooperation; and (4) metacognitive skills that can be derived 
from belief in partner, such as “Compare,” “Adjustment,” 
and “Belief in Partner,” can be important for positive 
teamwork. These four characteristics mentioned above may 
be compatible with past findings from research on teams: (1) 
can correspond to system monitoring, or can understand 
environmental characteristics in teams [9]; both (2) and (3) 
can correspond to mutual performance monitoring; and (4) 
can correspond to shared mental models and backup 
behaviors [10]. Observational marker systems for teamwork 
are probably not suited to evaluating these implicit teamwork 
behaviors. The reflection on cooperation and its analysis can 
be applied as a teamwork measurement for implicit 
teamwork and can be expected to give us good insights on 
some problems of team cooperation that cannot be identified 
through observation. 
The team task used in the present study demanded team 
resource management, such as building effective cooperation 
patterns and adjusting behaviors, to not interfere with the 
partner, but to help the partner. It was necessary for the 
management to monitor the members’ status and to identify 
problems with their team cooperation. In addition, 
understanding the characteristics of members’ equipment in 
the task was necessary for building an effective cooperation 
style in this task. These are probably the reasons why teams 
whose reflections included more metacognitive skills and 
richer descriptions of cooperation could show and maintain 
good performances. If this is true, a metacognitive 
instruction that induces a wide range of metacognition in 
cooperation can be applied as effective team training in tasks 
that have the same characteristics as those in this experiment.  
V. 
CONCLUSION 
This study aimed to examine the importance of 
metacognition in cooperation. The comparisons of both the 
reflection and the transition of the game scores between the 
team-oriented instruction and the self-oriented instruction 
suggested that a wide range of metacognition in cooperation 
could enhance team performance. In addition, the 
comparisons between the coded results of the reflection and 
the scores for each team suggested that the reflection of 
teams that had relatively good performances through the sets 
included metacognitive skills that were derived from belief 
in the partner’s cognition and activities. These two 
comparisons suggested that for positive teamwork, it is 
important that team members apply metacognitive skills to a 
variety of “Subjects” and “Contents” with each other.
