Abstract— This paper gives an overview of design aspects of 
software instructional videos resulting from a literature re-
view. The goal is to identify design dimensions and recommen-
dations for instructional videos for software training and to 
make the results usable for the production of Computer-Aided-
Design/-Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) instructional videos as 
part of a training concept within a Research and Development 
(R&D) project. The qualitative analysis provides four key de-
sign dimensions: (1) didactic design, (2) influence of the object, 
(3) material-technical implementation and (4) linguistic-visual 
design of the instruction. Recommendations were examined for 
similarities and differences and, if necessary, supplemented 
with findings from studies on particular aspects. The guide-
lines’ recommendations are mainly influenced by contextual 
factors. Fewer design solutions are discussed at a linguistic or 
visual level. The results provide valuable input for the design 
of instructional videos as learning materials for CAD/CAM 
software training in professional contexts. 
Keywords-instructional videos; software video training; 
digital education; CAx systems; digitalization in industry sectors. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Instructional videos present a solution process for specif-
ic tasks, enable users to act independently [1] and support 
Demonstration-Based Training (DBT) [2]. Multimedia prod-
ucts are increasingly discussed as a suitable means of 
knowledge transfer in a rapidly changing technical world. 
They can be produced quickly due to technical developments 
[3] and they use a familiar form of knowledge transfer (in-
struction) with new means. They are among the most used 
tools in the 21st century for the efficient, independent solu-
tion of activity-related tasks [4]. In addition to private use, 
there is a growing interest in the use of instructional videos 
in professional fields. Instructional videos have a high poten-
tial for companies (e.g., software training). As a blended 
learning format, they facilitate to make training and educa-
tion of employees more efficient; employees are given the 
opportunity to acquire knowledge in a self-regulated way [5]. 
Within the R&D project “WerkerLab - A modular train-
ing concept for Small and Middle-sized Enterprises (SMEs) 
in the production technology environment" a training con-
cept that prepares workers in SMEs for the use of 
CAD/CAM systems and for requirements of Industry 4.0. is 
developed. A major part of the modular training concept is 
the use of instructional videos. Therefore, a literature-based 
orientation framework for the production of CAD/CAM 
training videos is developed. This framework will then be 
enriched by the perspectives of workers and trainers from 
industrial project partners. Based on this framework videos 
will be produced and evaluated. The goal was to identify 
requirements for the design of instructional videos in this 
field of application. The results are presented in a systematic 
manner with reference to four design dimensions: didactic 
design, influence of the object, material-technical implemen-
tation and linguistic-visual design of the instruction. The 
latter part focuses on the central aspect of instruction and its 
implementation. From the perspective of communicative 
usability [6], questions of linguistic and visual design are 
considered in particular. The paper addresses three research 
questions:  
• 
RQ1: Which design dimensions of instructional vid-
eos are considered in the research literature? 
• 
RQ2: Which design aspects are discussed? Which 
recommendations are given? 
• 
RQ3: How are aspects of communicative usability 
taken into account? 
In the following, the theoretical framework that guides 
the literature evaluation is established (Section 2), followed 
by the description of the methodological procedure (Section 
3). The evaluation is based on the four design dimensions 
mentioned above (Section 4). After a discussion in Section 5, 
the article closes with a conclusion and outlook for further 
research (Section 6).

II. 
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK 
This paper addresses instructional videos from a linguis-
tic point of view and refers to it as a communication pattern 
(A). Their main purpose is to instruct. Instructing is under-
stood as a linguistic design task that takes didactic principles 
into account (B) and must meet the requirements of commu-
nicative usability (C).  
A. Instructional videos as a communicative format 
This paper treats instructional video as a communicative 
tool (or genre) for solving recurring problems (in this case 
lack of knowledge to operate CAD/CAM software). The 
design of the tool is oriented towards an overall goal (media-
tion or acquiring knowledge about software operation) and 
its pattern is conventionally agreed upon [7][8]. The design 
is limited by external parameters: the object (here production 
software), contextual factors (e.g., the domain or industry in 
which the software is used, with its values and conventions, 
and the cultural-economic context), as well as situational 
factors (conditions for video use, e.g., embedding in didactic 
measures). Other restrictions concern the material-technical 
implementation as well as the users. The design pattern en-
compasses different levels [7][8]: the topic hierarchy (main 
topic, secondary topics), structuring and sequencing of con-
tent and design solutions, the types of actions (instructing, 
naming target states) with typical linguistic and visual means 
as well as a typical average length. 
B. Instructing 
According to action theory, instructing is a directive writ-
ing or speaking act [9: 255]. They are intended to enable 
people 
to 
acquire 
(long-term) 
procedural 
(how-to) 
knowledge in order to independently carry out action steps 
and achieve a desired target state. Ballstaedt [9] defines ac-
tion as the intentional change of a state by an agent. 
From the perspective of learning psychology (and theo-
ries of comprehensibility that are based on it), actions (and 
their mediation) are framed by goals, conditions, conse-
quences and potential disturbances [10]. The learning pro-
cess is more efficient if the learner knows about the purpose 
of the action and the context. Every action has initial condi-
tions that must be described [9]. Initial state S1 requires ac-
tion A (rule: name conditions, then describe action). Every 
action has its consequences, it changes the initial state S1 
and transfers it into a state S2. State S2 gives feedback 
whether action A was successful or not. S2 must therefore be 
described, even if it is not directly observable. Instructions 
always contain series of the sequence S1, A and S2 [9]. They 
need to be described in the order in which they are to be exe-
cuted. Actions can be hindered by disturbances. Instructions 
must describe what the target state looks like when an action 
step has been carried out successfully and name potential 
disturbances and offer problem-solving options for them. 
This can also be done by means of supplementary measures 
(further sources of information) [11]. 
Instructions must describe goals, conditions and conse-
quences in the correct order to avoid mistakes, which can 
sometimes be costly or even dangerous. They must be seg-
mented in the right granularity and sequenced in a logical 
manner [11]. The content structure of an instruction is hier-
archical, consisting of a main action with several subactions 
[9]. The hierarchically highest action represents the superor-
dinate activity, which is implemented via actions and opera-
tions [9: 256]. The level of detail depends on the target group 
and its requirements. Experts understand process descrip-
tions without a detailed level of instruction (high-level in-
structions); intermediate experts or laypersons require in-
structions in small steps (low-level instructions). 
The quality of the target naming and the description of 
initial and target states are relevant for success. Beginning 
and end of the instruction are functionally assigned. A task-
oriented heading at the beginning, e.g., helps the recipient to 
mentally establish a meaningful context. Based on the repre-
sentation of sub-goals (action-target state scheme) the user 
can verify whether he has executed an action step correctly.  
A special component of instructions are warnings. Their 
intention is to induce the user to "refrain from certain actions 
or to carry them out imperatively in order to avoid unwanted 
consequences" [9: 259]. Since product liability exists in Eu-
rope and America, warnings in technical documentation are 
legally relevant and writing acts are mostly standardized. 
Established components are information on the severity of 
the hazard, the type and source of the hazard, the conse-
quences of the hazard and measures to counteract it. 
C. Communicative Usability 
The concept of communicative usability complements 
other forms of usability (e.g., cognitive or ergonomic) [6]. It 
focuses on the use of communicative modes in digital com-
munication and interaction contexts and sees language as the 
most important modality of interaction between humans and 
machines [6][12]. The quality of design is measured by the 
extent to which linguistic-visual means support the user in 
fulfilling higher-level (pragmatic, hedonistic or affective) 
interests of action and the resulting hierarchies of goals and 
tasks. The reception of instructional videos as part of profes-
sional training is motivated pragmatically - the acquisition of 
skills is part of the professional activity. 
Communicative usability considers communicative arti-
facts in their embedding in superordinate contexts of action, 
which are influenced by domain-specific, socio-cultural as 
well as temporal-spatial aspects [6].  
Based on the theoretical framework, four perspectives are 
used to analyze the literature: Aspects of the didactic design 
(purpose: transfer procedural knowledge), impact of the ob-
ject (CAD/CAM software, use in SMEs producing tangible 
goods) and its contextual embedding, the material-technical 
implementation as well as the linguistic-visual implementa-
tion of the instruction. The starting point is the assumption 
that the first three factors mentioned above significantly ex-
pand or limit the scope of design for the instruction itself.  
III. 
METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH 
The literature search and selection (corpus building) was 
done in four steps. Step 1: The search included the following 
terms: instructional video, video tutorial, video instructions, 
how-to video, recorded demonstration. The search was car-
ried out in the databases Scopus, Web of Knowledge and 
379

Google Scholar. For reasons of manageability it was limited 
to German and English articles published between 2004 and 
2019. In a second step, the results - 13317 findings - were 
limited to publications that discuss video tutorials as learning 
material and software use. The resulting corpus comprises 67 
publications. In step three, the corpus was limited to contri-
butions to video tutorials for software in the production area 
or as part of training courses that give design recommenda-
tions for their production. The adjusted corpus contains 13 
publications. In step four, two subcorpora from this cleaned-
up corpus were formed. Subcorpus 1 comprises contributions 
that formulate design recommendations in the form of guide-
lines (n=4). Subcorpus 2 includes individual studies on the 
topic (n=9).   
The two subcorpora were evaluated qualitatively [13] - 
firstly the guidelines, then case studies. The evaluation was 
based on the dimensions of didactic design, influence of the 
object, material-technical implementation and linguistic-
visual design of the instruction. The determined categories 
within the main categories (dimensions) were transferred 
into a category system. Five subcategories were determined 
for the dimension didactic design, three subcategories were 
determined for the dimension influence of the object, seven 
subcategories were determined for the dimension material-
technical implementation. The dimension linguistic-visual 
design of the instruction was initially divided into two cate-
gories - user guidance and instruction. Three subcategories 
were determined for the category user guidance. The catego-
ry instruction comprises four subcategories. The design rec-
ommendations were compared in terms of similarities and 
differences. 
IV. 
DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INSTRUCTIONAL 
VIDEOS 
A. Didactic design 
All evaluated guidelines discussed didactic requirements 
for instructional videos [1][2][4][14]. Taken the fact that 
instructional videos convey knowledge about action process-
es, they have didactic elements per se. In the literature main-
ly five design aspects of didactic design are discussed: (1) 
relevance of types of knowledge, (2) the user’s prior 
knowledge, (3) knowledge application, (4) self-efficacy, (5) 
autonomy of the learning material. 
Relevance of the types of knowledge: All guidelines ad-
dress the types – conceptual knowledge and procedural 
knowledge [1][2][4][5][14]. They emphasize their depend-
ence on the learning content [1]: it makes a difference 
whether basic mathematical knowledge should be taught or 
whether the user should learn how to set up a tool in the tool 
database. In the first case, the focus is on teaching conceptual 
knowledge. In the second case, the learning material mainly 
provides procedural knowledge [1]. Software training is de-
signed to teach the user the sequence of necessary steps (pro-
cedural knowledge). Swarts [4] emphasizes that processes 
are simultaneously demonstrated (procedural knowledge) 
and explained (conceptual knowledge). Plaisant and Shnei-
derman [14] call this hybrid of both types of knowledge "in-
structional information".  
User's prior knowledge: During the learning process, 
new information is incorporated into existing knowledge [2]. 
The evaluated guidelines emphasize that learning success 
depends on how the user's prior knowledge is activated 
[1][2] and on how much prior knowledge the addressee has 
[2]. Van der Meij [15] recommends the use of Advanced 
Organizers for the activation of prior knowledge. They 
should show "initial and final states" [15: 1370] of the action 
in order to clarify the learning goals and purpose of the vid-
eo. This preview of the task supports orientation and the de-
velopment of a bigger picture (Guideline preview the task 
[1]). Users with little prior knowledge benefit from added 
instructional support, i.e., design solutions that additionally 
support the learning process such as markers. Users with a 
lot of prior knowledge need less instructional support, it ra-
ther hampers their learning process. 
Knowledge application: Instructional videos provide 
knowledge for the autonomous solution of action-related 
tasks. The literature emphasizes the value of using practical 
exercises [1][2][15][16]. Practical exercises support retention 
(i.e., they help to anchor knowledge in long-term memory) 
and give the user the opportunity to check whether he can 
solve the problems on his own ([1] Guideline 8; hereafter 
referred to as “G.1-8”). The video should explain the prob-
lem and the way to solve it, which should be the starting 
point for practical exercises. During the application the 
learner should be able to consult the video again and solve 
the task without having to resort to other teaching materi-
als/staff. 
Self-efficacy: Two guidelines address affective aspects of 
learning [2][4]. An affective design "helps users engage with 
and feel comfortable about a message". [4: 196]. During the 
instruction the user should develop the feeling of being able 
to solve the task successfully (perceived self-efficacy) 
[2][4][15][16]. The user should have the feeling to be able to 
reach the target state by following the instructions. The in-
structor has to be convincing (confidence and expertise) [4] 
and not deviate from the previously determined solution. 
Important information should be repeated, the speaker 
should explain confidently (script, practice before recording) 
and confidently execute actions in in the interface. 
B. Influence of the object 
The evaluated literature focuses on instructions for ac-
quiring operating knowledge for software. The target group 
receives the videos in order to gain knowledge for a specific 
"task domain" [2], e.g., to achieve better performance in uni-
versity studies or in everyday working life. The object (soft-
ware, operating tasks) is part of the task domain. Considered 
are aspects of (1) content selection, (2) content segmentation 
and (3) content sequencing. 
Content selection: The selection of content should take 
the application context (task domain) into account as well as 
characteristics of the target group [14] in order to serve the 
interests of the user best. To anchor the learning content in 
the (professional) domain of the user has a motivating effect 
[2][16]. Also, content (problem, solutions, target states) 
should be oriented to the users' core tasks [2]. Content in 
instructional videos should be representations of sequences 
380

of actions. Only essential information relevant to the learning 
objective should be given [1][4]. Relevant content is always 
up to date. Brenner & Walter [17] emphasize the updating of 
content as an essential and continuous task of producers. 
Content segmentation: Instructional videos should not 
exceed a certain duration (see 4.C.). If the content to be con-
veyed cannot be presented in a given time, it must be divided 
into segments [1][2]. Segmentation means the division of the 
superordinate content into smaller but self-contained tasks. 
Content sequencing: The learning content in the video 
must be sequenced. The sequencing of the actions demon-
strated should be based on the correct order in which the user 
has to solve the problem [1]. The object (e.g., software) usu-
ally determines which content must be learned first and what 
must be learned later. If a video is divided into several seg-
ments, and the sequence of those is not determined by the 
object, the presentation sequence should follow the simple-
to-complex principle (problems that are easier to solve are 
presented first and more complex problems later) [2]. 
C. Material-technical implementation 
Instructional videos are complex multimedia products 
that are produced with technical aids. In the literature the 
technical implementation is dealt with extensively. The fol-
lowing design aspects are addressed: (1) duration of the vid-
eo, (2) coordination of image and sound, (3) user control, (4) 
quality of the visual recording, (5) screencapture, (6) quality 
of the auditory recording and (7) voice-over. 
Duration of the video: The most discussed technical de-
sign aspect in the literature is the duration of the video 
[1][2][14][16][18][19]. Guidelines and individual studies 
agree that videos should be kept as short as possible (G. 7). 
Differences can be seen in the exact determination of length. 
Plaisant and Shneiderman [14] do not address the length of 
an entire video, but rather the length of individual segments 
that ideally last 15-30 seconds but should not exceed 60 sec-
onds. The exact number of such segments needed to form an 
instructional video is not given. In contrast, guideline [1] 
specifies a maximum length of 3 minutes. Guo, Kim, and 
Rubin [18] find that shorter videos have a more engaging 
effect and suggests keeping videos shorter than 6 minutes. If 
a topic cannot be dealt with in a given length, it should be 
divided into shorter videos to not overwhelm the user with 
too much information. 
Coordination of image and sound: Information in videos 
are multi-coded (visual, verbal, auditory) and must be or-
chestrated. The majority of the guidelines [1][4][14] consider 
this and recommend that the actions performed on the visual 
level should be presented simultaneously with the content-
related information on the auditory level. The user is cogni-
tively relieved as he/she does not have to keep out-of-date 
information active on one coding level while waiting for the 
presentation of information on another coding level [1]. 
Swarts [4] goes into more detail and recommends that sound 
should slightly precede image. 
User control: User control allows the user to inde-
pendently navigate through the video and to determine their 
learning pace individually. This should be realized by allow-
ing the recipient to use the following functions via the video 
player software: starting, pausing, stopping, repeating, fast-
forwarding/rewinding 
and 
(chapter) 
skipping 
[1][2][4][14][20]. Recommended interface elements are but-
tons and an interactive timeline. To enable the user to move 
through the content in a self-determined way, segmented 
content (sections) should be labelled and be directly se-
lectable. Individual segments can be marked by short breaks, 
the insertion of black screens or title slides [1][2][4][14]. 
Quality of visual recordings: The quality of the visual re-
cording is taken into account by most guidelines [1][4][14]. 
The visibility of the actions and objects that are manipulated 
is a prerequisite for users to be able to follow the processes. 
The literature recommends the image in the video to be as 
stable as possible. The resolution of the video should be at 
least Near HD (vertical resolution = 720P). The visibility of 
objects and the readability of texts must be guaranteed by 
using a zoom effect [1][14]. However, the zoom area should 
not overlay important elements [1][14].  
Screencapture: Usually, video recordings are edited. 
Among other things, the producers decide whether or not to 
adapt the screen recordings. Two guidelines [1][14] take this 
into account. They recommend to always show the entire 
interface in the video without cropping the edges (G. 2). In 
practice, the user is guided by what he has seen in the video. 
Hence, it is important that the video shows what the user will 
see later in practice. If it differs, the user will have problems 
orientating. 
Quality of auditory recordings: In contrast to the visual 
quality, the auditory quality is hardly discussed. Only [4] 
states that information presented in video must be of suffi-
ciently high quality to ensure that the user can understand 
everything. Swarts [4: 202] speaks of "high resolution au-
dio". 
Voice-over: If there is a voice-over narration in the video, 
it can be performed either by a computer or a human. The 
explanations should be spoken by a human voice [1][4]. The 
learning process would be facilitated by a human voice (G. 
2), as users perceive it as more natural and appealing. 
D. Linguistic and verbal realization of the instruction 
With regard to implementation, in the following, a dis-
tinction is made between the framing of the instruction (user 
guidance) and the instruction itself.  
1) User guidance 
The majority of the recommendations in the guidelines 
relate to user guidance, i.e., how the instruction is framed 
communicatively or how the beginning and end of the video 
are designed. The framing pursues different goals: (1) acces-
sibility of the information, (2) directing attention and (3) 
narration. 
Accessibility of information: Instructional videos must 
ensure the accessibility of information; relevant information 
must be easy to find. A distinction can be made between 
external (finding the video itself) and internal (in the video) 
accessibility. If a learner is looking for a video, he/she must 
be able to judge whether the video is suitable for his/her pur-
poses based on the title (G. 1). Therefore, the title should be 
well chosen. With the help of a table of contents, an index or 
381

by using keywords the learner can assess in detail the rele-
vance of the topics covered within a video. 
At the beginning of the video, in the title sequence, the 
learning objective should be formulated and afterwards a 
short overview of the content should be given [1][4]. It is 
important to cover all announced contents [4]. A preview can 
be used as a tour through the components of the main screen 
[14]. However, detail should not be described in advance. 
User attention: The user's attention can be directed visu-
ally and/or audibly. Especially visual signals and markers are 
recommended in all guidelines. Elements in the interface can 
be highlighted by the cursor or in editing process by e.g., 
circles or arrows [1][2][4][14]. Auditory signals and markers 
can be edited in the form of a voice-over and can indicate 
content or details [1][2][4][14]. 
Narration: Narration is the reproduction of an event in 
oral or written form. Instructional videos for software can be 
understood as screen capture with narration [1]. It is im-
portant that all communicative modes (video, audio and text) 
are well coordinated [1, 4]. The spoken narration should be a 
human voice (G. 2). The language should be personal 
[1][2][18] and functional (G. 4). The ideal speaking rate is a 
bit lower and should be supported by natural pauses in 
speech. The speaking rate should follow the shown action 
sequences [1][2][18]. 
2) Instruction 
The presentation of the instruction itself requires design 
decisions on different levels: sequencing, wording, visual, 
auditory. 
Sequencing the instruction content: The sequencing of 
the instruction and sub-actions follows the sequence of ac-
tions that must be performed to get from the (superior) initial 
state to the (superior) target state [1]. The process from the 
superordinate beginning to the superordinate goal should be 
divided into manageable, meaningful sequences. Those se-
quences should also have a clear beginning, a clear middle 
section, a clear end and should comprise three to five sub-
actions. This is described as a three-part division [1]: (1) the 
starting state or the problem to be solved, (2) the solution 
path, and (3) the target state (see similarly [9][11]).  
Wording: The Guidelines recommend few aspects con-
cerning the wording in instructions. The vocabulary should 
be adapted to the user group [1]. Technical terms and foreign 
words should be defined and explained; abbreviations should 
be avoided [14]. They should be explained in a tour through 
the user interface. Technical vocabulary should be explained 
during the demonstration and in context, according to the 
just-in-time principle (G. 4) [1]. The narrator should address 
the learner directly and use the personal pronoun you to em-
phasize that the objectives of the video are relevant to the 
learner [1]. Plaisant and Shneiderman [14] apply the criteria 
of simplicity, directness and precision to language. Active 
language should be used and sentences kept short and sim-
ple. The imperative is best suited to describe the visual 
demonstration [1]. 
Visual parts: The visualization of the instruction should 
represent the entire interface that the user sees in front of him 
when he performs the task himself (G. 2). High resolution 
and stable images should ensure that all relevant information 
is clearly visible at all times [1][4]. If good visibility or legi-
bility cannot be guaranteed a zoom effect can be used. Oth-
erwise the complete interface should always be visible. The 
pace of the demonstration has to follow the pace of action in 
the real performance but also has to consider the pace of the 
learner [1][2][4]. Actions in the video must be executed flu-
idly and correctly [4]. Consequences of user actions has to be 
made clear [1][4][14]. The cursor should be highlighted with 
an animated circle that changes color depending on the per-
formed action (right or left click) [14].   
Auditory parts: All guidelines mention the high relevance 
of auditory parts for the reception of the instruction 
[1][2][4][14]. The spoken description should begin shortly 
before the visual demonstration, so that users can make a 
mental model of the actions to come [4]. During the visual 
demonstration, the spoken explanation should firstly describe 
what is being shown. On the other hand, it should give rea-
sons for what is shown, explain why something is done 
[1][4][14]. It should contextualize the actions, place them in 
a higher level of action. The speaker should use the interface 
at the same time to ensure synchronicity of the auditory and 
visual parts [14]. In addition to the spoken instruction, other 
auditory components such as sound effects play a subordi-
nate role. Sound effects should be used e.g., to highlight 
mouse clicks or scrolling audibly [14]. 
V. 
DISCUSSION 
Communicative usability and the guidelines see the em-
bedding in and dependence of the communicative instruc-
tional video on superordinate contexts of action that are 
shaped by the domain. The embedding in professional con-
texts and the pragmatic motivation of the guidelines are par-
ticularly evident in the focus on learning purpose-related 
knowledge about action sequences and the recommendation 
to apply this knowledge in practice. The recommendations 
show that the scope for designing instructional videos is pri-
marily influenced by external parameters. 
In contrast to the communicative usability approach [6], 
the guidelines, do not measure quality by how linguistic-
visual means support the user in fulfilling higher-level inter-
ests of action, but rather by how the didactic design and the 
material-technical implementation relieve the user cognitive-
ly and make the learning process effective [1].  
The focus in the recommendations is primarily on "tech-
nical guidelines" [14], which are intended to provide users 
with easy technical access to the learning content. In this 
respect, there is a consensus on the technical and media re-
quirements that instructional videos must meet in order to 
effectively support the learning process. Details regarding 
the exact duration of a video differ.  
Regarding the linguistic-visual implementation of the in-
struction, recommendations for user guidance include con-
siderably more aspects than recommendations for instructing 
as a linguistic action. Although there is an awareness that the 
beginning and closing of the video is crucial for learning 
success, linguistic-visual aspects are only addressed superfi-
cially. The guidelines mainly discuss material-technical con-
ditions as factors influencing the design of the instruction.

In contrast to individual studies, the guidelines have a 
greater claim to general validity; they address software train-
ing in general - not for specific products. The applicability of 
the guidelines should always be checked in the context of the 
interface to be presented and the target group [14].  
The guidelines focus on conveying best practice recom-
mendations. In industry, however, a failure-oriented ap-
proach is also used to convey how action should not be tak-
en. This is, e.g., also part of warning. This approach is not 
found in the literature and there is no research that contrasts 
both approaches. Warnings play a subordinate role in the 
guidelines, although it is legally relevant [9]. Only [4] men-
tions that warnings should be issued at the beginning.  
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
Research on the production of instructional videos for 
professional purposes and design solutions includes best 
practice as well as research-based approaches. There are al-
ready "key notions of accepted thinking" [1] that provide 
guidance for the production and evaluation of well-designed, 
efficient software instructional videos.  
Design requirements for instructional videos for software 
training are characterized by three main factors: Didactic 
purposes, influence of the object and technical-material con-
ditions. The literature primarily addresses questions of di-
dactic design and/or technical-material implementation. The 
communicative usability of instructional videos, i.e., the ex-
tent to which the linguistic-visual design supports the learner 
in the appropriation of content has rarely been addressed.  
This article provides an overview of design dimensions 
as well as aspects and corresponding recommendations dis-
cussed in the literature. It aims to sensitize producers of in-
structional videos for CAD/CAM software training for estab-
lished design requirements. In the research project Werk-
erLab, the results of this contribution will be presented to 
practitioners (workers and trainers) in order to evaluate the 
relevance of the identified recommendations from a practical 
point of view and, if necessary, to add new aspects. Prelimi-
nary results of interviews with practitioners already suggest 
that context factors such as video production costs are more 
relevant for practitioners than described in the literature.
