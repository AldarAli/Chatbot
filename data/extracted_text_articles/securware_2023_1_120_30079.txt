Abstract— This extended abstract introduces an initial 
application of long-distance remote security diagnostics for 
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), focusing on Industrial Control 
Systems (ICS) during maintenance testing. Through the 
Internet, a distance of 350 kilometers was bridged to conduct a 
preliminary security assessment of a building automation 
system. Emphasizing the importance of monitoring essential 
functions of ICS, such as digital outputs and serial 
communication, we utilized a pair of devices designed to 
encapsulate digital outputs using TCP/IP, enabling remote 
monitoring at the test device over a temporally configured site-
to-site Virtual Private Network (VPN). Despite an average 
network latency of 33 milliseconds and an approximate delay 
of around 3 seconds for digital outputs, the system was able to 
effectively communicate changes in the essential services of the 
control systems to the test device. Preliminary results 
underline the feasibility of this long-distance approach, setting 
the stage for future work on comprehensive real-world 
demonstrations using diverse simulated control systems, 
namely factory automation and gas plant control systems. The 
goal is to advance the field of remote security diagnostics 
during maintenance testing, providing reliable and effective 
security evaluation of CPS.

 INTRODUCTION 
As society increasingly relies on Cyber-Physical Systems 
(CPS) in sectors such as distributed solar power plants, 
cloud-based building management, and smart factories, the 
inherent cyber risks and potential disruptions multiply. A 
successful cyberattack on CPS can cause significant damage 
in both digital and physical realms, rendering critical 
infrastructures like pipelines, water treatment facilities, and 
power grids vulnerable to shutdowns and disruptions. 
In an environment where new vulnerabilities are 
continuously discovered and cyber attackers' tactics 
constantly evolve, it is crucial to persistently assess 
cybersecurity 
measures. 
Existing 
security 
evaluation 
frameworks include certification tests for control systems 
and embedded devices, focusing on known vulnerabilities 
and communication robustness. However, executing such 
tests on systems under operation is fraught with challenges 
due to time, workforce, and cost constraints [1]. 
This extended abstract discusses the potential of remote, 
network-based testing as an alternative strategy for 
enhancing cybersecurity in CPS. We delve into a cloud-
based diagnostic approach designed to minimize on-site 
testing while providing a practical assessment of the security 
posture of these systems [2]. 
The primary focus of this extended abstract is to establish 
whether the distance between testing and target sites impacts 
the efficacy of remote security diagnostics during the 
maintenance testing of Industrial Control Systems (ICS), 
according to IEC 62443 standards. A key challenge we seek 
to address is determining how remote testing conditions can 
simulate Local Area Network (LAN) testing conditions, 
despite significant physical distances between systems. 
The rest of the extended abstract is organized as follows: 
Section 2 provides an overview of the proposed 
methodology for remote security diagnostics, while Section 
3 presents an analysis of our initial findings. Section 4 
discusses potential implications, and Section 5 concludes.

In our study, we designed and executed a series of tests 
utilizing a practical testbed with the following characteristics 
(Figure 1): 
Physical distance from the Test Device: The target 
systems were located 350 kilometers away from the Test 
Device. This considerable physical distance provides a 
realistic scenario for assessing the capability of remote 
diagnostics during the maintenance of ICS.

Private Network (VPN) for communication between the Test 
Device and the target systems.   
Diverse Simulated Control Systems: The subjects of 
our security diagnostics were different types of simulated 
control systems, each using varied control protocols and 
implemented using different control devices. These systems 
were: 
• 
Building Automation System: This system 
controls elements such as air conditioning, 
lighting, and electricity reception in a building. 
• 
Factory Automation System: This system 
simulates a section of a robotic arm in an 
automobile assembly factory, specifically one 
that sorts parts. 
• 
Gas Plant Control System: This system controls 
the 
pressure 
in 
gas 
tanks 
to 
maintain 
consistency. 
The diversity of these systems provides a comprehensive 
testing ground to evaluate our remote diagnostic approach 
across various operational conditions and requirements. The 
results from these tests provide insights into the efficacy of 
remote security diagnostics during maintenance testing and 
can inform future development in this field.

IMPLEMENTATION AND PRELIMINARY RESULTS 
In the implementation phase of our study, we first set up 
the necessary equipment for our testing environment. This 
included a pair of devices designed to encapsulate digital 
outputs using TCP/IP and enable Ethernet-based remote 
monitoring of distant equipment, bridging the physical gap 
of 350 kilometers (Figure 2) [3]. These devices were placed 
at both the test device and the Device Under Test (DUT), a 
Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) of the building 
automation system, in our preliminary testing. 
Figure 2.  Two buildings to run long-distance remote diagnostics trials.  
Once the setup was complete, we conducted preliminary 
testing by sending diagnostic data from the test device to the 
DUT and remotely monitoring the state of the building 
automation system’s essential services from the test device 
as closely as possible. Notably, this was achieved despite the 
inherent latency in our network setup, characterized by an 
average network latency of 33 milliseconds (ICMP: Internet 
Control Message Protocol) and a delay of around 3 seconds 
for digital outputs (DO over TCP/IP). 
Our preliminary results showed that the proposed system 
effectively conveyed changes in the essential services of the 
control systems to the test device, even in the presence of 
notable network latency and digital output delay. The tests 
demonstrated that the method could consistently deliver 
changes to the test device from the remote building 
automation system, fulfilling its goal of reliable remote 
security diagnostics. 
IV. 
FUTURE WORK 
We will extend the remote diagnostic methodology 
developed and tested preliminarily on a building automation 
system to other control systems, specifically factory 
automation and gas plant control systems. This diversity will 
provide a more comprehensive view of the applicability and 
efficacy of our methodology across different industrial 
scenarios. 
Firstly, we will refine our approach to remote monitoring 
of essential services. Essential services, which include 
communication between DUT, Human-Machine Interfaces 
(HMI), and other controllers, are integral to the functioning 
of control systems. It is, therefore, crucial to ensure the 
reliability and accuracy of their remote monitoring, despite 
the inherent challenges posed by the physical distance and 
consequent latency. To achieve this, we will continue 
optimizing the systems for encapsulating digital outputs and 
transferring data over temporal site-to-site VPN. 
Furthermore, we will investigate the impact of the 350 
kilometers distance, particularly the associated network 
latency and digital output delay, on the quality of the remote 
diagnostics. Our preliminary results have shown that the 
proposed methodology can reliably deliver changes in the 
essential services to the test device from a remote building 
automation system. However, a more in-depth understanding 
of how the inherent latency affects the quality of diagnostics 
is crucial. This analysis will aid in refining the methodology 
for optimal performance even over long distances. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
In this extended abstract, we have presented an initial 
application of remote diagnostics over a long-distance 
network for the security evaluation of CPS. Our preliminary 
results, based on a building automation system situated 350 
kilometers away, demonstrate the feasibility of this 
approach. We have highlighted the importance of reliable 
data transfer and effective monitoring of essential services, 
even in the presence of inherent network latency. The future 
research will continue to refine this methodology, exploring 
the impacts of long distance on diagnostic quality across 
different control systems.
