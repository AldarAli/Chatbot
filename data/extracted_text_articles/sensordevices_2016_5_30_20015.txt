Electronics, recently we explore R-QWIPs for long wavelength
applications. By using our two optimized inductively coupled
plasma (ICP) etching processes, two format (1Kx1K and
40x40) R-QWIP detectors were fabricated successfully. We
achieved a quantum efficiency of 37% for 19 quantum wells
and 35% for 8 quantum wells under a doping density of 0.5 ×
1018 cm-3. The cutoff wavelength and bandwidth of both
detectors are 10.5 µm and 2 µm respectively. The thermal
sensitivity of the large format FPA is 27.2 mK at half well-fill
(Nw/2) of 8.85 M electrons and intergration time of 4.46 ms
under F/2.5 optics.

INTRODUCTION
We established a highly reliable electromagnetic (EM)
model to calculate the quantum efficiency (QE) of an
infrared detector [1]. We subsequently applied it to design a
new detector structure, which is referred to as the resonator-
QWIP (R-QWIP) [2]. An R-QWIP consists of an active
quantum well (QW) layer, a GaAs bottom contact layer, and
a top GaAs contact layer. On the top contact layer, there is an
array of diffractive elements (DEs) that are covered with
ohmic metal and gold layers. The ohmic metal consists of
Pd/Ge/Au layers. The mesa is surrounded by a low index
material, such as epoxy, and the substrate underneath the
ground contact layer is completely removed.
When light is incident from the bottom side of the
detector, it is scattered by the DEs back to the detector
volume, and the subsequent angles of incidence are larger
than the critical angles for total internal reflection at all
detector boundaries. The light is therefore trapped inside the
pixel. By designing a properly sized detector volume, the
trapped light forms a constructive interference pattern, with
which the internal optical intensity is greatly increased,
thereby yielding a large QE. To achieve the expected
performance, the height of the DE and the thickness of the
active resonator must be uniformly and accurately realized
to within 0.05 µm accuracy and the substrates of the
detectors have to be removed totally to prevent the escape of
unabsorbed
light
in
the
detectors.
To
achieve
these
specifications, an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching
tool is used to fabricate a good number of test detectors and

FPAs. In an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) system, ion
density is controlled by ICP source power alone. Increasing
ICP source power increases ion density. Meanwhile, ion
energy is affected by both ICP source power and RF chuck
power. Increasing ICP power decreases induced dc bias. On
the contrary, increasing RF chuck power raises dc bias on
the chuck. Since an ICP system provides one more process
parameter than a reactive ion etching (RIE) system for
plasma control, it is more flexible to use ICP to optimize
different etching processes, such as selective (etching GaAs
over AlxGa1-xAs stop etching layer) versus non-selective
etching, or isotropic versus vertical etching [3-7]. We thus

adopted ICP etching (selective and non-selective) over
reactive ion etching (RIE) for the fabrication of test
detectors and FPAs. Our selective ICP etching process can
yield a very high selectivity (>5000:1) and a fast GaAs
etching rate (2700Å/min). The etching surface was perfectly
smooth and mirror-like after processing. In addition to high
selectivity and smooth etching surface, the process is also
highly reproducible and shows no damage to the detector
material [8-11].
In this work, we designed an R-QWIP with a broad
resonance. When it couples to a broadband material, which
has a cutoff wavelength at 10.5 µm, infrared radiation
between 7.5 – 10.5 µm within the long wavelength infrared
(LWIR) window can be efficiently detected. Two format R-
QWIP detectors were fabricated (1K x 1K and 40 x 40). The
pixel pitch size are 20 µm and 25 µm respectively. In this
article, we will describe the material and geometry design,
fabrication and test results.
II.
10.5 µM CUTOFF R-QWIP DESIGN
To design a broadband R-QWIP with 10.5 µm cutoff, we
use a double-well structure to broaden the spectral bandwidth
of the QWIP material. In the design, each quantum well
(QW) period contains a 50-Å GaAs QW, a thin 60-Å
Al0.22Ga0.78As barrier, another 50-Å GaAs QW, followed by
a thick 500-Å Al0.22Ga0.78As barrier. To reduce the dark
current level in this long wavelength detector, a moderate
doping density ND of 0.5 × 1018 cm-3 is adopted for each
QW. If the two GaAs QWs are coupled through the thin
barrier, its bandwidth is broadened from ~1 µm to ~3 µm.
Figure 1 (a) shows the band structures of the design. Figure 1
(b) shows the material layer structure. Two types of wafer
materials are subsequently grown, 19 QW periods and 8 QW
periods. They are labeled as DX1 and DX2. The active layer
thickness of DX1 and DX2 are 1.3 µm, and 0.6 µm
respectively.
Figure 2(a) shows the R-QWIP geometry design. Each
pixel consists of 9 GaAs rings as diffractive elements (DEs)
that covered with ohmic metal and gold. The pixel size is 20
× 20 µm2 with a 25-µm pixel pitch. In this structure, the
incident light is diffracted by the DEs and reflected back to
the active layer as shown in Figure 2(b) where it is trapped
and circulated inside the pixel until it is absorbed eventually.

R-QWIP FABRICATION
R-QWIP focal plane array (FPA) and test detector
fabrication process involves five masks. We use the first
mask to create an array of rings as DEs. By using an EVG

photoresist was coated on the wafers. The resist was baked at
110C° for one minute in the system. Karl Suss MA/BA6
Contact Aligner was used to expose photoresist and align
patterns over layers. The DEs were formed by using our
optimized selective ICP etching process to etch down to the
15 Å etch-stop layer, which is shown in picture 1(b). The
optimized etching parameters were: BCl3 = 20 sccm, SF6 =
10 sccm, Ar = 10 sccm; pressure = 0.5 mTorr; RF Power = 0
W; ICP Power = 200W; and substrate temperature = 25˚C. 
Before the ICP etching, one minute oxygen plasma was used
to clean the etching surface. The etching process was
conducted in a Unaxis VLR 700 Etch System. Since the
selective etching process has a very high selectivity (greater
than 5000:1 for Al0.4Ga0.6As), 15-Å thick stop etching layer
is sufficient to define the DE height. The etch-stop layer is
also important to maintain a uniform height across the wafer
as the etching rate is higher near the wafer edge. Figure 3
shows a microscope pictures that was taken after DE etching.

We use second mask to delineate the ground contact area
located outside the detector area. Optimized non-selective
ICP etching recipe was used to touch the ground contact
layer. The etching parameters were: BCl3 = 50 sccm, Ar =
10 sccm; pressure = 5 mTorr; RF Power = 80 W; ICP Power
= 800W; and substrate temperature = 25˚C. In this etching, 
we apply a finite RF power to form a vertical sidewall. Since
The RF power also induces a DC voltage on the chuck,
which accelerates the ions toward the etching material, we
minimized the RF power to avoid the possible plasma
damage.
In metallization step, instead of negative photoresist, we
use positive photoresist to create a favorable undercut for
metal lift-off. In our case, the DE elements scatter UV light
during exposure, which results in the undercut. The metal
layer consists of five layers of materials, and they are:
Pd(50Å)/ Ge(200Å)/ Au(300Å)/ Pd(50Å)/ Au(5000Å). After
lift-off, the wafer was annealed in a tube furnace at 350C for
25 minutes.
The fourth mask was used to define the pixels. We
opened the pixel areas while other areas were covered with
photoresist. In the pixel areas, the metal pads were used as
etching masks, and non-selective ICP etching was utilized to
create individual pixels. The fifth mask is indium bump
mask. We coated 9 µm-thick positive photoresist (AZ9245)
and deposited 5 µm-tall indium bumps on the wafer using a
thermal evaporator. Figure 4. Shows a microscope picture
taken after indium bump deposition. The wafer was then
diced into FPAs and test detectors and candidates were bump
bonded to readout and fanout circuits. The backsides of the
detectors were then filled with low viscosity epoxy.

x 1K format and 25 µm pixel pitch size).
One of the most important process step is substrate
removal. Thinned QWIP FPAs offers several advantages
over un-thinned detector FPAs. Besides other general
benefits, substrate removal is specifically important for R-
QWIP. The thinned R-QWIP FPAs and test detectors
enhance the resonant effects, and the QE can rise by a factor
of 3 - 5 according to EM modeling. To remove the substrate
of FPAs and test devices, we need to mechanically lap the
substrates to within 50 µm. Our optimized selective etching
process was then use to totally remove the substrates. The
surface of the dies is uniform, smooth and mirror-like after
etching.[8]

DX1 (19 QWs) R-QWIP CHARACTERISTICS
The test detector of DX1 R-QWIPs are fabricated into
groups of 40 × 40 pixel elements and they are hybridized to

fanout circuits. The fabricated pixel is shown in the insert of
figure 5(b). After backfilling with epoxy, the substrate was
removed completely. The conversion efficiency (CE) is
measured at different substrate bias v at the operating
temperature t = 10 K. The light source is a globar
monochromator. Next, the gain of the detector is deduced
from the noise measurements. From the values of CE and g,
the QE spectrum can be obtained and it is shown in figure
5(b). The maximum QE at 2 v is 36.5%. Figure 5(a) shows
the expected QE spectrum for the present detector material
and structural designs. If we assume a planar wave front as
in normal incidence, the peak at 9.7 µm will have a QE of
43%. On the other hand, if we assume a spherical wave
front as in f/2.5 optics, the main peak will be slightly

reduced to 38%. The overall detection lineshape however
remains almost the same. Comparing the calculated and

observed QE spectrum in Figure 5(a) and (b), the observed
peaks are broader. These broader peaks may help to explain
the slightly lower averaged peak value from the theoretical
expectations. Even with the broadened peaks, the individual
peaks from A to D are still visible at the calculated
wavelengths, although the magnitudes of A and B peaks are
smaller than predicted. We attribute this peak suppression to
the processing imperfections and nonuniformity. Since A

resonances
in
the
shorter
wavelengths, their vertical electric polarization distributions
have higher spatial frequencies and thus will be more
sensitive to the fidelity of the global detector geometry. As
seen in figure 4 and in the insert of figure 5(b), the
fabricated pixel has rounded corners and the rings are
slightly displaced from the pixel center, both are deviated
from the EM model. These imperfections may be the causes
for the lower peaks.
Although QE under positive substrate bias is consistent
with EM modeling, QE under negative bias is substantially
smaller, and it is shown in Figure 6(b). Under negative bias,
QE at -2 V are 20.5%. It is nearly a factor of 2 less than that
under positive bias. The same situation was also observed in
three separate wafer materials in earlier studies. We attribute
this polarity asymmetry to the fact that the resonant optical
intensity is highly localized along the z axis. The value of
vertical optical intensity decreases exponentially from the
maximum at the top of the active layer to zero at the bottom
of the ground contact layer. This highly localized intensity
makes the creation of photocurrent sensitive to the internal
potential drop across the QWs. It is known that the potential
drop inside a QWIP is not linear but larger at the cathode
than at the anode. The photoelectrons generated at the
cathode are then more likely to drift out of the well and
contribute to the photocurrent. The photoelectrons at the
anode, on the other hand, are prone to recombine in the
same well and do not create a photocurrent. Therefore, when
the cathode is at the top of the QW layer under positive
substrate bias, almost all optical absorptions generate
photocurrent and thus the detection QE is closer to the
absorption QE. Conversely, under negative substrate bias,
the anode situates in the high intensity region where the
QWs are less active. The detection QE is thus reduced.
In addition to the fanout circuits, we also produced a
DX1 focal plane array with the same pixel size and pitch in
a 1-megapixel format. The FPA was first characterized in an
experimental dewar using a globar monochormator. Figure
6(a) shows an infrared image taken in this experimental
dewar. The FPA operating condition is: T = 61 K, V ~ -1.1
V, F/# = 2.5, integration time τint = 3.06 ms, and signal
processing = 1-point background subtraction. Under this
operating condition, the pixel operability is 99.5% and
thermal
sensitivity
(NE∆T)
is
45
mK.
After
this
measurement, the FPA was integrated into a camera that can
operate at a lower T. With a F/2.5 lens, 300 K background,
55 K cold stage T, and a lower bias of ~ -0.5 V, the
measured NE∆T is 27.2 mK at half well-fill (Nw/2) of 8.85
Me− and integration time (τint) of 4.46 ms.
V.
DX2 (8 QWs) R-QWIP CHARACTERISTICS
To confirm the explanation of the polarity asymmetry,
we adopted the DX2 material structure, which has fewer
QWs (8 QWs instead of 19 QWs) but has the same total
thickness as DX1 so that they have the same resonant
structure. In DX2, the original 1.3-µm thick active layer is
divided into two material layers: a 0.6-µm thick active layer
at the top and a 0.7-µm contact layer at the bottom.
Figure 7(a) shows QE of DX2 R-QWIP under positive
bias. At 0.8 V, QE are 34.7%, which is only slightly less
than the 36.5% for DX1. The similar QEs thus confirm that
the vast majority of IR absorption indeed occurs within a
very thin layer (< 0.6 µm) next to the diffractive elements.
The nearly equal QE for different active thicknesses was
predicted in a previous study12 and is confirmed in this
experiment. The photons cycle more times in less absorbing
layers, thus yielding similar QE. Furthermore, the DX2 QE
at negative bias of -0.8 V, shown in Fig. 7(b), is 33.8%,
respectively. They are almost the same as that under
positive bias, which again confirms that all DX2 QWs are in
the high intensity region.

CONCLUSION
We designed a broadband long wavelength R-QWIP
detector. With the help of our two optimized ICP etching
processes, we fabricated a good number of FPAs and test
detectors. Using a moderate 0.5 × 1018 cm-3 doping, we
achieved 37% QE in a 19-QW detector and 35% in an 8-
QW detector at a large positive substrate bias. Similar QE
can also be obtained under negative bias in the 8-QW
detector. Despite the fact that the present readout circuit
operates on negative bias, the DX1 FPA shows a thermal
sensitivity of 27.2mK with 99.5% operability at 55 K under

Higher
sensitivity, shorter integration time, and higher operating
temperature are expected at positive bias. With nearly
double QE of DX2 relative to DX1 at negative bias, higher
performance will also be expected from the DX2 FPA. To

and more accurate alignment. The result will be reported
elsewhere.
