Abstract—Routing in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs)
remains challenging after years of research because the network
conditions can vary signiﬁcantly depending on the actual ap-
plication scenario. This effect is even increased if the external
conditions are not stable but rather change during the operation
of the network as for example in disaster scenarios. In such
a case, one single routing approach is usually not able to
perform well because it was optimized for one parameter set
only. Hybrid routing protocols usually combine two approaches
for better adaptability to multiple use cases but still require
a careful selection of the protocols in question. In adaptive
routing concepts, nodes can choose from multiple protocols and
thus adapt to the given network conditions seamlessly. In this
paper, we present our adaptive routing framework allowing easy
integration of multiple protocols and discuss its advantages over
hybrid and traditional routing concepts as well as the application
to disaster scenarios.
Keywords—Mobile Ad Hoc Networks; Adaptive Routing; Hy-
brid Routing; Disaster Scenarios.
I. INTRODUCTION
When a disaster hits a region, fast and efﬁcient rescue
operations are essential to save as many lives as possible.
This requires an operational communication network ideally
for both the ﬁrst responders and the affected people. But the
disaster will also damage the communication infrastructure,
resulting in missing coverage or overloaded networks.
Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) are one promising
option to provide communication under these circumstances,
as the network is built based on devices at hand. But due to
the structure of the network and the node mobility, routing be-
comes a challenge and remains challenging even after years of
research because the network conditions can be quite different
depending on the actual circumstances. In disaster scenarios,
where after an initial damage to the whole infrastructure
more and more ﬁrst responders arrive to help and parts of
the remaining infrastructure get restored, this effect is even
increased because the conditions within the network are not
stable but rather change during the operation of the network.
In such a case, a single routing protocol is usually not
able to perform well under all conditions because routing
protocols are typically optimized for one parameter set only.
Hybrid routing protocols try to solve this by combining two
approaches for better adaptability to multiple use cases. This
shows a better performance, if the protocols in question are
carefully selected for the envisioned scenarios. If not, the
performance might even decrease.
To overcome the need to preselect the employed routing
protocols, adaptive routing has been proposed in the literature.
When using such approaches, nodes can choose a currently
active routing protocol from multiple options and thus adapt
to the given network conditions seamlessly as they are enabled
to dynamically switch to a better candidate as needed. In
this paper, we present our adaptive routing framework Self-
organized Routing in heterogeneous MANETs (SEREMA),
which allows easy integration of multiple routing protocols,
and show its potential for disaster networks. SEREMA was
developed during a dissertation project [1].
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we will
discuss several related adaptive routing approaches that in-
spired different features of our framework. Afterwards, we
introduce the conceptual design of our framework and discuss
its components in detail in Section III and show how this
framework can provide robust and reliable communication
in disaster scenarios. Then, we prove the feasibility of the
concept with simulative evaluations in Section IV. Finally, the
paper is concluded in Section V where we also present future
planned research studies.
II. RELATED WORK
In this section, we present work that has been done in the
ﬁeld of adaptive routing.
Nada et al. [2] proposed a framework that enables the
switching between different routing protocols during runtime.
This was realized without any modiﬁcation to the protocols
participating in the framework and thus ensuring that new
protocols can be integrated later on. However, the approach
comes with the drawback that the whole network has to
switch to the same (new) routing protocol if the algorithm
decides, hence making the system less ﬂexible and unable to
handle different conditions in different parts of the network.
Moreover, during such a protocol switch the routing tables
of all nodes have to be converted to match the required
entry structure of the new protocol. Besides that, the decision
mechanism of the whole network is deployed to a single node
only. This potentially leads to inefﬁcient routing or a complete
failure, if this node is not working or gets corrupted.
Another example for this globally switchable routing is the
Chameleon Routing Protocol (CML) proposed by Ramrekha et
39

al. [3]. This approach is also based on a centralized monitoring
agent that controls the choice of the routing protocol used by
the whole network. Again, the centralized node introduces an
undesired single point of failure into the network. However,
the monitoring concept described by the authors is quite
interesting in order to identify the optimal switching point. The
optimal switching point deﬁnes when the beneﬁts of changing
to another routing protocol out weight the overhead caused by
switching. Ideally, the monitoring to determine this point has
to be done in a distributed and cooperative way throughout
the network.
Hoebeke et al. [4] proposed a strategy, where every node
is able to use its own routing protocol depending on the local
scenario. Throughout the whole network, multiple routing
mechanisms can be activated at the same time and global
decision making is no longer needed. Conceptually, this sup-
port for multiple active protocols at the same time is desired.
However, all envisioned protocols have to be adapted in order
to work with the presented framework. Hence, a plug-and-
play solution for newly introduced protocols as well as the
interaction with unaware nodes is not possible. This limits the
usability of the approach in cases where legacy nodes have to
be integrated into the network or a ﬂexible extension of the
routing framework is needed.
In the Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP) proposed by Beijar et
al. [5], participating nodes have two routing zones, a reactive
and a proactive one. Depending on the near-ﬁeld scenario,
a node can adapt the radius of these zones dynamically.
However, this only changes the size of the regions in which
the two protocols are used. Besides that, it is not possible
to change the used protocols during runtime, again limiting
the adaptability to changing conditions during the operation
of the network. While regions with different protocols and
dynamic size adaptation are beneﬁcial, the pre-conﬁguration
of the active protocols is not, since these might not suit all
scenarios.
Besides these approaches, several recent works show the
relevance of adaptive routing. Son et al. [6] present a similar
approach with different metrics related to the node mobil-
ity. Based on the observed mobility, the routing protocol is
switched for the whole network only. To achieve this, the
scheme requires extensive control information to synchronize
all nodes. This has two drawbacks. First, one single switching
decision throughout the network might be suboptimal in some
parts and second, the additionally introduced trafﬁc should be
avoided.
Kaji and Yoshihiro [7] use adaptive routing to identify
alternative paths and thus avoid congestion in the network.
To enable fast adaptive switching to different paths, they
modify the packet structure and require an additional routing
table to store alternative paths. Again, the modiﬁcations are
problematic for legacy node support.
In the next section, we present our new concept that takes
the beneﬁts of the presented approaches while eliminating
most of the drawbacks.
III. SEREMA FRAMEWORK
A. Conceptual Design Considerations
In order to allow nodes to dynamically select the best
routing protocol according to given network situations, several
protocols have to be included into the adaptive routing frame-
work. But there are several things that should be considered
when designing such a framework.
The network conditions will not be constant throughout the
complete network, especially in disaster networks or any other
large-scale MANET covering a sufﬁciently large geographical
region. Therefore, the framework should support the operation
of multiple simultaneously active protocols in different sub-
zones of the same network and allow the dynamic switching
of the currently active protocol out of a set of protocols based
on monitored metrics. This adaptivity mechanism builds the
core functionality of any adaptive routing approach.
The operation of multiple protocols in parallel and the
switching poses additional challenges that have to be solved
in order to build a robust framework. The ﬁrst point is related
to the lifetime of a system running the adaptive routing
framework. In case of disaster scenarios, this is important for
the ﬁrst responder devices that are usually employed for longer
periods. At the same time, old devices will be constantly
replaced by newer ones. The new devices will beneﬁt from
recent advances in both technological and software-related
enhancements. This will also include more recent routing
protocols outperforming the previous ones. Therefore, the
framework should be able to integrate additional routing
protocol versions without too much extension effort. Hence,
the framework should support easy integration of additional
protocols.
Besides that, it cannot be ensured that the adaptive frame-
work is deployed on all participating nodes. To enable these
nodes to communicate with the remaining network, the frame-
work has to support legacy nodes. In a region or zone with
legacy nodes, the framework should therefore switch to one
standard protocol supported by these nodes. This switching,
however, does not require all surrounding nodes with adaptive
routing to switch to the same protocol, if they are equipped
with a more suitable protocol. In this case, one node can act
as a Border Node [8] bridging the resulting two zones.
In order to enable the support of legacy nodes, the protocol
versions integrated into the framework should be standard
compliant as far as possible. This can be achieved if the
adaptive routing framework does not require any signiﬁcant
changes of the existing protocols. Therefore, we try to avoid
modiﬁcations for example of the routing table structure, the
control packet structure, or the addition of new packet types.
The only exception in our approach are standard compliant
extensions that are allowed by the protocol speciﬁcation.
The limitation of modiﬁcation raises the question whether
the framework introduces its own control messages or is
able to beneﬁt from the operation principles of the integrated
protocols. Ideally, the normal protocol operations are used as
far as possible and only few additional control messages or
40

piggy-back extensions to existing control messages should be
deﬁned. This is also true for the routing table structure. Each
protocol comes with its own deﬁnition for the routing table it
uses and the structure of the corresponding routing entries.
An adaptive framework enabling the operation of multiple
protocols in parallel has to either deﬁne a uniﬁed table that
is accessed by the forwarding agent or to translate the entries
from each table, if multiple tables are used.
Besides that, the framework has to provide a translation
mechanism in order to enable seamless communication be-
tween the supported protocols. This is needed to exchange
routing information between zones using different active pro-
tocols, as the format of control messages as well as routing
table entries have to be converted into that of the other proto-
col. For example, the information gathered by one proactive
zone should be available in the reactive zone as well. This can
be achieved by storing the corresponding routing information
in the routing table and use this to respond to corresponding
reactive requests. Therefore, the routing information has to be
converted or translated from the formats used by the proactive
protocol into that of the reactive one and vice versa. To limit
the processing overhead introduced by the adaptive routing
framework to perform the required translations, the number of
the required operations should be minimized.
Finally, the framework has to fulﬁll multiple performance-
related criteria. When employed in a disaster scenario, the
framework has to provide robust communication and thus
reliable packet delivery. For the framework, this requirement
results in three crucial design aspects:
• distributed constant Monitoring of network conditions,
• distributed Decision Making, and
• a high Decision Quality.
The ﬁrst two aspects help to avoid potential single points-
of-failure. Besides that, distributed approaches can handle
malicious nodes if the surrounding nodes detect apparently
contradicting information. A high decision quality is ensured
by this because it helps to prevent nodes from switching to a
wrong protocol or taking isolated switching decisions. This can
be achieved for example by monitoring multiple parameters
and integrating them into a weighted scoring function as base
for the switching decision.
As mentioned before, the nodes have to monitor the network
conditions in their surrounding and take a decision to activate
or deactivate speciﬁc routing protocols based on the collected
data. One of the biggest challenges is the deﬁnition of good
algorithms realizing such switching decisions.
Based on the points discussed above, the goal of our
framework is to provide network-wide adaptive routing which
fulﬁlls the following criteria:
• support of an extensible set of routing protocols,
• support of multiple active protocols in different variably-
sized zones in parallel,
• support of legacy nodes,
• distributed switching decisions of the active protocol,
• requiring only standard-compliant extensions of the rout-
ing protocols, and
• integrating multiple routing tables by building a wrapper
component to allow an easy and uniﬁed access.
B. Framework Components
Based on the design considerations presented in the previous
section, we developed our adaptive routing framework with
the following components trying to combine the advantages
of previous approaches. In the following, we will introduce
the structure of our framework and provide details on how to
achieve the mentioned criteria.

Fig. 1. Architecture of the Adaptive Routing Framework
Our proposed framework has the architecture as shown
in Figure 1. The core of the system consists of multiple
routing protocols, which can be connected/disconnected from
the network via simple switches. Each of the equipped routing
protocols can use its own routing table that allows to simply
add further protocols without a huge implementation effort or
changes to the protocol operation. All of the received and
transmitted routing, as well as data packets are monitored
locally by probes (M) and all of the gathered information is
forwarded to the Monitoring Agent. It will calculate relevant
statistics on the current trafﬁc, as well as neighboring nodes
and provide this information representing the current network
situation to the Decision Maker. For making a decision about
the currently most suitable routing protocol, additional infor-
mation about the behavior of the protocols is required and
provided by the Routing Mode Information block. This behav-
ioral information describes the ideal operational parameters of
41

the protocols including the reactions to certain load situations
(e.g. increased overhead due to ﬂooding requests). After the
Decision Maker has used the data from the Monitoring Agent
and Routing Mode Information block to make its protocol
decision, it controls the input/output switches of the equipped
routing protocols and, therefore, connects/disconnects speciﬁc
protocols to/from the network. Since the decision is based
on the locally observed network conditions at each node
including information from its neighbors via received packets,
we are able to make a dezentralized decision without requiring
additional control trafﬁc.

Fig. 2. Routing Table Wrapper
To provide routing information to the forwarding plane,
our framework uses a special Routing Table Wrapper (c.f.
Figure 2) that allows to simply access the information in multi-
ple, different routing tables. With this mechanism, SEREMA
is able to use multiple different routing protocols, allowing
each protocol to use its own speciﬁed routing table. If a
route to a speciﬁc destination in the network is required, the
Routing Table Wrapper looks up the destination in all of the
equipped routing tables and provides the resulting route to the
IP-Forwarding module. This mechanism has the big advantage
that in the time directly after a routing protocol change, when
the new routing protocol has not gathered any new routes yet,
the Routing Table Wrapper is able to provide the routes from
the previously used routing protocol to the IP-Forwarding, not
interrupting any ongoing data transfers.
If the network uses different routing protocols in different
areas at the same time, the Border Node Manager (c.f. Fig-
ure 1) enables the interconnection of such areas. To achive this,
it converts routing information between different protocols and
allows to forward routing requests/responses over multiple
routing domains. Nodes can freely chose their respective
routing protocol in this setup. The interconnection of different
routing zones is achieved by Border Nodes, that are able to
translate the routing trafﬁc accordingly and thus guarantee
the end-to-end consistency of data ﬂows. Any node can act
as Border Node, if it detects different routing zones and
supports both corresponding routing protocols [8]. Based on
this mechanism, we are also able to integrate legacy nodes
that support only one protocol as long as a suitable SEREMA
node running the required protocol is within range.
The translation also includes a mechanism to enable route
discovery across zones with different protocols and possibly
different operation principles. This is crucial, if the nodes
currently operate with a proactive protocol but are supposed
to communicate with nodes in other zones running reactive
protocols. In this case, the proactive node has to be enabled to
start a reactive-style request. This is achieved by implement-
ing corresponding annotation packets and a passive request
mode. All packets needed for this mechanism are designed as
standard-compliant packet extensions.
C. Implementation Details
To prove our concept, we implemented an adaptive routing
framework that is able to switch between two traditional and
well-know routing protocols for our evaluation: Ad hoc On-
Demand Distance Vector (AODV) Routing [9] and Optimized
Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR) [10].
Core of the implementation is the scoring algorithm em-
ployed in the decision maker. It will deﬁne which protocol is
currently used based on the results of the monitoring agent.
Figure 3 shows the implemented scoring algorithm that is used
to select the currently active routing protocol.

Fig. 3. Scoring Algorithm
To prove the conceptual design of an adaptive switching
mechanism, we decided to use simpliﬁed criteria to estimate
the current conditions in the network that are easy to monitor
in simulations. Therefore, the currently implemented algorithm
might not take the ideal decisions. However, it is suitable to
show the feasibility of our concept in general.
We chose to utilize a score-based mechanism in our al-
gorithm where each protocol can get/lose scoring points de-
pending on the given criteria. This is required because there
are several metrics and interactions between them that describe
the current conditions in a network. Not all metrics are easy to
normalize and afterwards be used in a uniﬁed formula which
results in a number representing the best protocol.

For example, if we consider the routing overhead on a node
related to the data trafﬁc of the node, we get a number between
0 and 100 %. However, if we try to use the number of neighbor
nodes for a decision, we do not have a maximum value to
use in the formula. Therefore, the scoring algorithm simply
adds/removes points to/from a protocol if speciﬁc conditions
are met. In Figure 3, the notation Protocol ± 1 indicates
that either the currently active protocol (main protocol) or
the supported variant get an additional scoring point, if the
corresponding criteria is fulﬁlled. Finally, the protocol with
the highest score is activated. Depending on the requirements
made to the adaptive routing framework, the number of points
a protocol gets can be adjusted. In this way the protocol
behavior can also simply be adjusted during runtime.
Currently, the algorithm considers three criteria only. These
are the network load in terms of an ratio between the overhead
introduced by the chosen routing protocol and the actual
data trafﬁc, the active protocol, and how many neighboring
nodes use the same protocol. The network load in this case
is locally observed by each node and relevant metrics are
currently not exchanged between neighboring nodes to limit
the otherwise introduced signaling overhead. However, the
individual decision can propagate through the network, since
the protocol selected by neighbors is one criteria. With this
subset of criteria, we are able to evaluate our framework
in scenarios where the density of nodes varies and should
therefore result in adaptive switching decisions.
Future research will be dedicated to the evaluation of more
realistic criteria and their corresponding weights in terms of
scoring points. This work can be based on previous work on
adaptive routing (cf. Lye et al. [11] or Haerri et al. [12]), but
should include a thorough evaluation of suitable metrics de-
scribing characteristic network situations. Further simulations
with our routing framework can help to evaluate the impact
of such criteria. Such studies should include the evaluation of
routing protocols under the characteristic conditions as well.
Besides that, we plan to apply multi criteria decision making
principles (e.g., [13]) to enhance our scoring algorithm and
thus enable the combination of further relevant criteria. Such
approaches allow to consider and optimize multiple criteria
even if they have quite different notations. This is based
on normalization proﬁles for each criteria and corresponding
weights according to the optimization goals.
D. Application to Disaster Scenarios
Our framework fulﬁlls several points that makes it suitable
for disaster communication besides the fact of providing
adaptivity. Disaster networks, especially in early stages of
any relief mission, are highly heterogeneous and feature
intermittent connectivity due to damaged infrastructure or
limited communication ranges. At the same time, many users
want to communicate either with friends or other affected
people, as well as with rescue forces with whatever devices
they have available. This adds a high load to the remaining
network. In the worst case, this trafﬁc from or to the affected
people will however use up valid resources for ﬁrst responder
communication. Therefore, ﬁrst responders usually provide
their own communication network, which is separated from
other public communication networks for security reasons.
But affected people can become volunteers, supporting the
professional rescuers. In this case, they should have access to
the network as well. Besides that, an option to add the devices
of affected people for emergency calls is also required, because
in this case they are easier to detect and help can be sent faster.
Our framework supports both aspects, by allowing legacy
nodes to join the network via a suitable Border Node acting
as gateway. We assume that affected people are equipped
with legacy devices, because they most likely did not install
any additional software to support our framework just to be
prepared for a disaster event.
Using the Border Nodes as gateways helps the ﬁrst respon-
ders to become aware of the presence of affected people which
might indicate their position and help to rescue them. On the
other hand, this gateway can act as trafﬁc shaper to allow
the detection of nodes and the placement of emergency calls
but limiting other communications to a minimum in order to
prevent high trafﬁc by affected people. This could be done
by a simple group assignment. Each unauthorized device is
assigned to a corresponding group that allows this device to
only announce its position and otherwise routes the trafﬁc to
the emergency call management. Other destinations are not
propagated to these nodes. Once a device has been registered
as volunteer, its status changes and it is granted more rights
to communicate with further ﬁrst responders.
With these additional features our framework can ensure
reliable and robust communication required during any disaster
mission. The core concept here is to provide self-organized
adaptivity on the network layer. This ensures the maximum
ﬂexibility to various networking conditions, if the selection of
any given operation mode is robust.
IV. SIMULATION AND DISCUSSION
In this section, we present simulation results veriﬁng our
concept. Simulations were done in the well-known ns-3 [14]
in combination with Click [15].
In Figure 4, we show the simulated scenario. We created
three subnetworks (routing domains) each with its own ac-
tive routing protocol. They are connected via Border Nodes
translating between the different protocols. In the SEREMA
scenario, the ﬁrst and third routing domain used AODV, while
nodes in the second utilized OLSR. Two Border Nodes are
used to directly tunnel the reactive control trafﬁc through
the OLSR zone [8]. For reason of comparison, we also ran
this scenario with AODV and OLSR active on all nodes,
respectively.
The simulation was conﬁgured to use six data transmissions
between areas one and three and in addition one transmission
from area one to area two as well as a connection from area
two to area three. The rest of the active data transmissions used
in the scenarios take place in the proactive routing domain 2.
Each of the simulated routing domains contained 20 nodes
with a transmission range of 10 m and a speed of 1-3 m/s. For

the movement scenario, we decided to use a Random Waypoint
model to not consider special behaviors of speciﬁc movement
models. The simulated duration of the scenario was 300 s and
the results were averaged over ten simulation runs.

Fig. 4. Simulated Scenario
The ﬁrst measured parameter is the Packet Delivery Ratio
(PDR), showing how successful routes could be established
for communication. Figure 5 shows that the gradient of the
PDR graph decreases with an increasing number of active data
transmissions in the network. This behavior is because in a
scenario with a lower number of active data transmissions,
the number of received packets increases with the number
of sent packets, but if the trafﬁc in the network increases,
the percentage of received packets, related to sent packets,
decreases. In the simulated scenario, most of the data trans-
missions take place in routing domain two, which is used
by the data transmissions between routing domain one and
three for transit. This means that such data packets have to
pass a network area with a higher trafﬁc load. Furthermore,
it can be seen that in the AODV-only scenario, the PDR is
highest, as the reactive routing searches for routes on-demand
and therefore delivers the most up-to-date routing information.
In this scenario, SEREMA has a higher PDR than OLSR,
because of the reactive part of SEREMA which provides better
routes than OLSR-only. However, SEREMA cannot reach the
performance of AODV in this scenario, because of SEREMA’s
proactive behavior which produces additional routing trafﬁc in
the network.

The last parameter we evaluated is the routing overhead
related to the overall trafﬁc introduced by the routing protocols
as shown in Figure 6. For networks with lower trafﬁc, AODV
outperforms OLSR and behaves comparable to SEREMA.
However, as soon as the number of active data transmissions
in the network increases, AODV generates more routing trafﬁc
because of its reactive behavior that emits packets on demand.
In this case, the routing overhead ratio of OLSR decreases as
the overall trafﬁc in the network increases while the OLSR
routing overhead stays more or less constant because of the
proactive protocol behavior. SEREMA can outperform both
protocols since it beneﬁts from both routing protocols (AODV
and OLSR). In routing domain two with a high trafﬁc, it
behaves like OLSR and limits the produced routing overhead,
while in routing domain one and three which only have a few
data transmissions it uses AODV to avoid the periodical static
load to the network caused by OLSR. It can be seen that the
network beneﬁts from our adaptive routing framework as the
routing overhead stays lower, compared to AODV-only as well
as OLSR-only networks.

Finally, we evaluated the switching performance of our
scoring algorithm (cf. Figure 3). To do that, the resulting
decision was evaluated analytically for both protocols. Tables I
and II present the corresponding switching matrices. The
criteria used are the overhead ratio between routing trafﬁc and
data trafﬁc and the neighbor ratio indicating which subset of all
neighboring nodes runs the same protocol (cf. Section III-C).
In both tables ’1’ denotes the decision to switch the protocol
and ’0’ to keep the current protocol.
It should be noted that the number of neighboring nodes
running the same routing protocol is a ratio here and does
not reﬂect the node density in the network. This commonly
used metric for the utilization of reactive or proactive routing
schemes will be considered in future versions of our algorithm.
Based on the two metrics currently considered, both tables
show that our approach is able to switch the routing protocol
under given network conditions. Here, the switching is in
general done when few neighboring nodes run the same
protocol and depending on the current overhead introduced
by the routing protocol, AODV is favored for low overhead
cases and OLSR for cases with higher overhead.

If a node detects that it should act as border node, this
decision matrix is obsolete as both protocols have to be active
in this case.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we presented our adaptive routing framework
SEREMA and discussed relevant design choices required for a
common solution in highly dynamic scenarios. Our framework
is able to fulﬁll the resulting requirements by providing
distributed decision making and support of legacy nodes.
The framework was implemented and evaluated using ns-
3 and click. Simulations showed that adaptive routing in
MANETs is an interesting solution if conditions are not
constant network wide. Even though we use simplistic scoring
criteria, our solution is able to outperform single routing pro-
tocols with respect to the analyzed metrics. To overcome the
reduced PDR in comparison to pure OLSR, further research
is required to identify both the ideal switching point and the
relevant metrics.
Future work will therefore include a thorough evaluation of
further more realistic metrics and criteria that are characteristic
for given network conditions, as well as the impact of these
parameters on different routing protocols in order to enhance
the performance of our adaptive routing framework. We also
plan to incorporate further relevant routing protocols into our
framework to enhance the adaptivity to additional conditions
and exploit the combination of adaptive routing and Delay Tol-
erant Networks (DTNs) principles in an hybrid DTN-MANET
scenario. Finally, the adaptive approach could be combined
with address resolution and service discovery mechanisms as
presented by Finke et al. [16]. Such combination of different
approaches could provide beneﬁts in terms of lower delay for
name resolutions and robustness to node failures.
