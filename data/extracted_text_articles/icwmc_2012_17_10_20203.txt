Abstract—Mobility Load Balancing (MLB) is one of the most 
important functions of Self-Organizing Networks (SON) in 
Long Term Evolution (LTE). The conventional MLB schemes 
based on handover (HO) conflict with Mobility Robustness 
Optimization (MRO) because both operations adjust the same 
HO parameters. The simulation results show that the 
conventional MLB scheme cannot achieve load balancing gain 
without some degradation in HO performance. In order to 
solve the conflict problem, this paper proposes an MLB scheme 
based on cell reselection (CR) that works in coordination with 
MRO. The proposed scheme adjusts the CR parameters and 
not the HO parameters, and never conflicts with MRO. 
Through computer simulations, it is shown that the proposed 
scheme can realize effective load balancing on a par with 
conventional schemes without any degradation in HO 
performance. The simulation results show that the proposed 
scheme is especially effective in an environment where a lot of 
small-size data packets are transmitted by a large number of 
users, which is highly applicable to current mobile networks 
with explosive diffusion of smart phones. In such case, more 
than 10% and 90% gains can be obtained in the total 
throughput and 5th percentile user throughput, respectively.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In conventional cellular networks, system parameters are 
manually adjusted to maintain and/or improve the 
operational performance. However, due to the rapid 
evolution of networks, the parameters have become more 
complex and larger, and such manual tuning of the 
parameters is becoming increasingly difficult. In order to 
reduce the operational complexity of cellular networks, the 
concept of Self-Organizing Networks (SON) has been 
introduced into Long Term Evolution (LTE) and is currently 
being discussed in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 
(3GPP) [1]. 
One of the main functions of SON is Mobility Load 
Balancing (MLB) [2]. In cellular networks, traffic demand 
dynamically changes both in time and space, and it is 
common for some cells to be heavily loaded, whereas their 
adjacent cells are not. The objective of MLB is to distribute 
cell load evenly among adjacent cells or to transfer part of 
the traffic from congested cells. In MLB, this is done by self-
optimization of the mobility parameters. 
In the 3GPP, the concept, requirements, procedures and 
interfaces of MLB are discussed. The actual solutions are left 
to vendor specific algorithms and several algorithms for the 
optimization of the mobility parameters have been reported 
in 
the 
literature 
[3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11]. 
They 
considered MLB based on handover (HO), which is referred 
to as “HO-MLB” hereafter. HO-MLB adjusts the HO timing 
by biasing the HO measurements, forcing user equipments 
(UEs) around the cell-edge in highly loaded cells to hand off 
to less loaded neighboring cells in order to share traffic 
between adjacent cells. The unavoidable problem in any 
attempt to realize HO-MLB is the conflict with Mobility 
Robustness Optimization (MRO), which is also one of the 
important functions of SON [2]. MRO aims to minimize HO 
failures and reduce ping-pong HOs by adjusting the HO 
parameters. Therefore, it is possible that both HO-MLB and 
MRO adjust the same HO parameter in the opposite 
directions at the same time and the conflict may lead to 
performance degradation. The conflict problem between HO-
MLB and MRO was investigated in detail [6]. In [6], the 
authors proposed a solution to avoid the conflict problem by 
imposing a restriction on HO-MLB through setting an 
allowed range to make sure that HO failures never occur. 
However, the proposal is not a sufficient solution because the 
load balancing is extremely limited by the operation of MRO 
and the gain is therefore expected to be negligible. Moreover, 
it is very difficult to determine the allowed range for in-
service cellular networks where the allowed range varies 
dynamically in response to changes in the radio environment 
and UE mobility. In such networks, the scheme may not 
work effectively. 
Cell reselection (CR) also has the potential to realize load 
balancing [2]. We refer to an MLB based on CR as “CR-
MLB” hereafter. In the same way as HO-MLB, the 
adjustment of the CR timing by biasing the CR 
measurements causes the UEs around the cell-edge in highly 
loaded cells to migrate to less loaded neighboring cells. 
While HO-MLB is intended for UEs in radio resource 
control (RRC) connected mode, CR-MLB is intended for 
UEs in RRC idle mode. In previous studies of MLB, HO-
MLB is mainly studied because the adjustment of CR 
parameters is only effective during call set-up and the 
optimization of HO parameters is considered to be the 
preferred option [9]. However, CR-MLB has a great 
advantage over HO-MLB in that there is no conflict with 
MRO because CR-MLB and MRO adjust different 
parameters. Therefore, CR-MLB can be a promising way to 
realize load balancing more than HO-MLB. To the best of 
our knowledge, the performances of CR-MLB have not been 
reported.

In this paper, we propose a CR-MLB scheme that works 
in coordination with MRO. The proposed scheme adjusts CR 
parameters under the restriction determined by the HO 
parameters, which are obtained by MRO operating 
independently of MLB. The proposed scheme is expected to 
realize load balancing without any degradation in HO 
performance. In order to examine the performance and 
clarify the applicable scope of the proposed scheme, we 
perform the computer simulations over different UE 
distributions and traffic patterns. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section II, 
we explain the conventional HO-MLB scheme, and the 
influence on HO performance is clarified through a computer 
simulation. Section III introduces the proposed CR-MLB 
scheme. The performance of the proposed scheme is 
evaluated in section IV. Finally, we conclude this paper in 
section V. 
II. 
MOBILITY LOAD BALANCING BASED ON HANDOVER 
In this section, we introduce the HO procedure in 3GPP 
LTE and then explain the operational principle of the 
conventional MLB scheme based on the HO (HO-MLB). 
The influence of HO-MLB on HO performances is also 
examined by computer simulations. 
A. HO Procedure 
The HO procedure in 3GPP LTE begins with 
measurement report (MR) transmission from a UE to its 
source cell (serving cell). The UE periodically performs 
downlink channel measurements based on cell-specific 
reference signals and checks whether the signal strengths 
satisfy the conditions for MR transmission. The entering 
condition for event A3, which is one of the MR triggering 
events generally used for the HO procedure [12], is defined 
as 

Hys0a3Offset0 CIO

where M0 and M1 are the signal strengths of the serving cell 
(Cell#0) and the target cell (Cell#1), respectively. Hys0 is the 
hysteresis parameter and a3Offset0 is the offset parameter for 
event A3.  In order to simplify the discussion without 
generality, we disregard Hys0 and a3Offset0 in this paper. By 
substituting Hys0 = a3Offset0 = 0 into (1), we obtain the 
following condition; 

CIO

where CIO0,1 is a cell-specific offset parameter set by Cell#0 
for Cell#1 and is called “Cell Individual Offset (CIO).” If 
condition (2) is satisfied for duration of Time To Trigger 
(TTT), the UE sends the MR to Cell#0 and the HO 
procedure from Cell#0 to Cell#1 is initiated. 
B. Conventional HO-MLB Scheme 
The operational principle of HO-MLB is illustrated in 
Figure 1. As shown in Figure 1(a), 12 UEs and 2 UEs belong 
to Cell#0 and Cell#1, respectively, that is, Cell#0 is more 
loaded than Cell#1. In this case, as illustrated in Figure 1(b), 
the HO-MLB scheme increases CIO0,1 to make the HO 
timing from Cell#0 to Cell#1 earlier and UEs of Cell#0 near 
Cell#1 will hand off to Cell#1. In addition, as shown in 
Figure 1(c), the HO-MLB scheme can decrease CIO1,0 to 
make the HO timing from Cell#1 to Cell#0 later in order to 
keep the handed off UEs from Cell#0 staying in Cell#1. 
Finally, the load is shared equally between Cell#0 and 
Cell#1.

C. Influence on HO pereformances 
The adjustment of the HO timing by the HO-MLB 
scheme may cause performance degradation of HO processes. 
Here the influence of HO-MLB on HO performances is 
examined through computer simulations. We evaluate the 
HO failure rate and ping-pong HO rate between Cell#0 and 
Cell#1 by changing CIO0,1 and CIO1,0. In the simulations, the 
number of HO failures is counted if “Too Late HO,” “Too 
Early HO,” or “HO to Wrong Cell” is observed [2]. The 
number of ping-pong HOs is counted when the UE returns to 
the original serving cell within a pre-determined minimum-
time-of-stay (MTS) after a HO from the original serving cell 
to a neighboring cell [13] and the MTS value in the 
simulations is set to 2 seconds. The HO failure rate and ping-
pong HO rate is defined as the ratio of the number of HO 
failures and ping-pong HOs divided by the number of all 
HOs including HO failures, respectively. The other 
simulation conditions are summarized in Table I.

In order to obtain significant load balancing gain, the 
MLB scheme should be operated in an environment in which 
low mobility UEs are dominant. Therefore, we assume that 
UE mobility is 3 km/h throughout the paper. In the case of 3 
km/h, we run the MRO [14] and find that the optimal CIO 
value that minimizes the sum of the HO failure rate and 
ping-pong HO rate is 6 dB.  The default CIO value is set to 
6 dB.

Figure 2 shows the HO failure rate and ping-pong HO 
rate when the HO-MLB scheme increases CIO0,1 from the 
default value of 6 dB to 6 dB while CIO1,0 is fixed to 6 dB. 
It is found that the HO failure rate is almost zero for all CIO 
values, but the ping-pong HO rate becomes higher as the 
HO-MLB scheme increases CIO0,1. This is because the 
hysteresis region becomes narrower by increasing CIO0,1. It 
is undesirable for the incidence of ping-pong HO to be too 
high as it consumes a lot of radio resources as well as placing 
an unnecessary burden on the hardware units of eNBs and 
wastes backhaul resources. If we introduce a policy whereby 
the ping-pong HO rate is kept below 15 %, HO-MLB can 
increase CIO0,1 only up to 2 dB and this may result in little 
load balancing gain being achieved. The gain will be 
evaluated in detail in section IV.

Figure 2.  HO failure rate and ping-pong HO rate: CIO0,1 is changed from

In order to prevent ping-pong HO from occurring, HO-
MLB has to keep the hysteresis region at 12 dB by 
decreasing CIO1,0 according to the increase in CIO0,1 as 
shown in Figure 1(c). Figure 3 shows that decreasing CIO1,0 
causes a large number of Too Late HO from Cell#1 to Cell#0 
and the HO failure rate becomes critically high as HO-MLB 
increases CIO0,1. It is found that the increase in HO failures 
is inevitable when HO-MLB decreases CIO1,0. As a result, 
this option is not an appropriate approach because the HO 
failures directly influence the user performance. 
Finally, from Figures 2 and 3, it can be concluded that 
HO-MLB cannot achieve load balancing gain without some 
degradation in HO performance.

MOBILITY LOAD BALANCING BASED ON CELL 
RESELECTION 
In this section, we introduce the CR procedure in 3GPP 
LTE and then explain the operational principle of the 
proposed MLB scheme based on the CR (CR-MLB). 
A. Cell Reselection Procedure 
The CR procedure in 3GPP LTE is performed as follows. 
The UE in RRC idle mode periodically performs idle mode 
measurements. When more than 1 second has elapsed since 
the UE camped on the current serving cell and the following 
condition (3) is satisfied during a time interval of 
TreselectionRAT, the UE camped on Cell#0 shall perform cell 
reselection to Cell#1 [15]. 

QHyst,0Qoffset

where M0 and M1 are the signal strengths of the camped cell 
(Cell#0) and the target cell (Cell#1), respectively. QHyst,0 is 
the hysteresis parameter and, to simplify the discussion, we 
383

disregard it in this paper. By substituting QHyst,0 = 0 into (3), 
we obtain the following condition; 

 Qoffset

where Qoffset0,1 is a cell-specific offset parameter set by 
Cell#0 for Cell#1 called Qoffset. In normal operation, the 
CR timing is adjusted to be the same as the HO timing and 
then Qoffset0,1 is equal to CIO0,1. 
B. Proposed CR-MLB Scheme 
Figure 4 illustrates the operational principle of CR-MLB. 
As illustrated in Figure 4(a), 12 UEs and 2 UEs in RRC 
connected mode belong to Cell#0 and Cell#1, respectively. 
Because Cell#0 is more loaded than Cell#1, the CR-MLB 
scheme decreases Qoffset0,1 to make the CR timing from 
Cell#0 to Cell#1 earlier as shown in Figure 4(b). Once UEs 
of Cell#0 leave the RRC connected mode and enter the RRC 
idle mode, the UE near Cell#1 will perform cell reselection 
to Cell#1. Finally, as shown in Figure 4(c), the UEs camped 
on Cell#1 will enter the RRC connected mode and belong to 
Cell#1. In summary, if the UE stays within the hysteresis 
region of the HO parameter, it can potentially connect to 
both Cell#0 and Cell#1. Once the UE connects to either cell, 
the UE does not satisfy the HO condition and continues to 
stay in the same cell. CR-MLB moves such UEs to the less 
loaded cell when they are in the RRC idle mode.

Figure 4.  Operational principle of CR-MLB. 
In the proposed scheme, CR-MLB and MRO operate 
independently and never conflict with each other. MRO 
always operates and optimizes the setting of CIO to 
minimize the HO failure rate and ping-pong HO rate. When 
the traffic load in each cell is not heavy and it is not 
necessary to perform load balancing, CR-MLB does not 
operate and the CR parameter is set to the default value 
Qoffset0,1 = CIO0,1, which is determined by the result of 
MRO. If the traffic load in some cells becomes high and the 
traffic loads between adjacent cells are unbalanced, CR-
MLB begins to operate and decreases the CR parameter of 
the higher loaded cell for the less loaded cells. As a result, 
CR-MLB works in coordination with MRO and can realize 
load balancing without any degradation in HO performance. 
There is one concern that will need to be considered. 
When CR-MLB decreases Qoffset0,1 and the hysteresis 
margin between the CR timing from Cell#0 to Cell#1 and the 
HO timing from Cell#1 to Cell#0 are close to zero, there is a 
high possibility for the UE performing cell reselection to 
Cell#1 in RRC idle mode to return to Cell#0 by HO after the 
UE becomes the RRC connected mode. This is because the 
measured signal strengths of Cell#0 and Cell#1 fluctuate 
over time due to the effect of fast fading, shadowing, and so 
on. Note that though this may reduce the load balancing gain 
of CR-MLB, it never causes ping-pong HO in RRC 
connected mode because the hysteresis of the HO parameters 
between CIO0,1 and CIO1,0 is not changed by CR-MLB. In 
the following section, we examine the load balancing 
performance of CR-MLB considering the above concern. 
IV. 
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
In this section, the load balancing performance of the 
proposed CR-MLB scheme is examined through computer 
simulations. The system-level simulator written in C++ is 
developed for the evaluation. First, we compare the proposed 
scheme with the conventional HO-MLB scheme for various 
offered traffic loads. We also evaluate the proposed scheme 
over different UE distributions and traffic patterns to clarify 
the applicable scope. 
A. Simulation Conditions 
Figure 5 illustrates a part of the cell layout used in the 
simulation. In order to examine the load balancing gain, we 
change CIO and Qoffset values of Cell#0 for the neighboring 
6 cells (Cell#1, Cell#2, Cell#4, Cell#5, Cell#8, and Cell#19) 
and evaluate the downlink UE throughput in those cells.

We define the ratio of the throughput to that for the case 
where {CIO0,1 6 dBQoffset0,16 dB} as throughput 
gain. From the simulation results, the throughput gain for the 
case where { CIO0,1 x dBQoffset0,1y dB } is derived as

and the gains of total throughput, 5th percentile user

As an example, throughput gain of 1.0 means that the 
throughput is twice as that for the case where {CIO0,1 6 
dBQoffset0,16 dB}. 
As for the traffic model, we assume that traffic with a 
fixed data size arrives at a fixed time interval per UE. Note 
that the timing of traffic arrival is uniformly distributed 
among UEs. When the traffic arrives, the UE enters the RRC 
connected mode and then returns to the RRC idle mode 1 
second after the transmission traffic queue becomes empty. 
If the queue is not empty when the next traffic arrives, the 
UE continues to stay in the RRC connected mode. The other 
simulation conditions are summarized in Tables I and II.

B. Comparison with HO-MLB 
First, we compare the load balancing performance of the 
proposed CR-MLB with that of the conventional HO-MLB 
schemes for various offered traffic loads. In order to compare 
them in the case where high throughput gain is expected to 
be obtained, we allocate 140 UEs to Cell#0 and no UEs to 
neighboring cells, that is, intentionally create an unbalanced 
traffic load situation between Cell#0 and the neighboring 
cells. In the CR-MLB, Qoffset0,1 is changed from 6 to 6 dB 
and, in the HO-MLB, CIO0,1 is changed from 6 to 6 dB. 
Figure 6 shows the throughput gains of the CR-MLB and 
HO-MLB. We change the data size of traffic so that the total 
offered traffic load in Cell#0 is 17.6, 22, and 26.4 Mbps in 
Figures 6(a)-(c), respectively. The resource block (RB) usage 
of Cell#0 without MLB is nearly 100% when the total 
offered traffic load is 17.6 Mbps. 
From Figure 6(a), it is found that there is little throughput 
gains both for the CR-MLB and HO-MLB because almost 
all offered traffic can be handled solely by Cell#0 even 
though MLB does not operate. 
In Figure 6(b), we can see that high throughput gains are 
obtained. It is found that MLB improves the 5th percentile 
user throughput rather than the total throughput and about 
80% gain can be achieved both with CR-MLB and HO-MLB. 
In HO-MLB, as CIO0,1 increases, the throughput gains 
become higher although the ping-pong HO rate also becomes 
higher as shown in Figure 2. The throughput gains become 
saturated with CIO0,1 of more than 0 dB because the 
overloaded offered traffic of Cell#0 is mostly transferred into 
neighboring cells and the RB usage of Cell#0 becomes less 
than 100%.  In CR-MLB, as Qoffset0,1 decreases, the 
throughput gains become higher without any degradation in 
HO performance. Compared with HO-MLB, the throughput 
gains of CR-MLB increase more slowly. The reason is that 
some UEs return to Cell#0 in the RRC connected mode due 
to the effect of fast fading. If the stationary UEs are 
dominant and the signal strengths change more slowly, it is 
expected that the lines of throughput gains of CR-MLB will 
fit closely with those of HO-MLB. In any case, CR-MLB 
can achieve throughput gains equivalent to HO-MLB with 
Qoffset0,1 = 6 dB. In addition, as an example, if we adopt a 
policy where the ping-pong HO rate is kept below 15%, HO-
MLB cannot increase CIO0,1 by more than 2 dB as shown 
in Figure 2 and the throughput gains of CR-MLB with 
Qoffset0,1 = 6 dB are superior to those of HO-MLB with 
CIO0,1 = 2. 
Figure 6(c) shows the case where Cell#0 is very heavily 
loaded. In this case, the differences in the throughput gains 
between CR-MLB and HO-MLB become larger. However, if 
we adopt the policy that does not allow the ping-pong HO 
rate to rise above 15%, the throughput gains of CR-MLB 
with Qoffset0,1 = 6 dB are comparable to those of HO-MLB 
with CIO0,1 = 2. 
From the above observations, we can conclude that the 
proposed scheme can realize load balancing effectively on a 
par with conventional schemes without any degradation in 
HO performance. 
C. Performance Evaluation of CR-MLB 
Next, we evaluate the proposed CR-MLB scheme over 
different UE distributions and traffic patterns. 
Figure 7 shows the throughput gains when the ratio of the 
number of UEs in Cell#0 to neighboring cells is changed. 
The number of UEs in each cell except for Cell#0 is fixed at 
20 and only the number of UEs in Cell#0 is changed. The 
offered data size of traffic is normalized so that the total 
offered traffic load in Cell#0 is 26.4 Mbps. From Figure 7, 
we can see that the throughput gains become higher as the 
ratio of UEs increases and the traffic load becomes more 
unbalanced. 
In Figure 8, we evaluate the throughput gains by 
changing the total offered traffic load in Cell#0. In the 
evaluations, we allocate 140 UEs to Cell#0 and no UEs to 
neighboring cells. From Figure 8, it can be seen that the 
throughput gains reach the maximum when the total offered 
traffic load is around 22 Mbps, and then they become lower 
as the total offered traffic load increases. This is because 
385

ICWMC 2012 : The Eighth International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications

when the total offered traffic load increases significantly and 
the RB usage of Cell#0 is much greater than 100%, the UEs’ 
transmission traffic queues are always full and the UEs 
remain continuously in the RRC connected mode. In this 
case, there is no possibility of performing cell reselection and 
the performance gain of CR-MLB is reduced. This is a weak 
point of CR-MLB, but this situation can be avoided if CR-
MLB operates before the RB usage of Cell#0 becomes 
greater than 100% and properly off-load the excess load of 
Cell#0 to the neighboring cells. 
In Figure 9, the throughput gains are evaluated by 
changing the data size of traffic. The time interval of traffic 
arrival is adjusted according to the data size of traffic so that 
the total offered traffic load in Cell#0 is 26.4 Mbps. In the 
evaluations, we also allocate 140 UEs to Cell#0 and no UEs 
to neighboring cells. From Figure 9, we can see that more 
than 90% and 10% gains in the 5th percentile user throughput 
and total throughput respectively when the data size of traffic 
is less than 500 KB. As the data size of traffic increases, the 
throughput gains becomes lower because the time that a UE 
stays in the RRC connected mode becomes longer due to the 
large data size of traffic and the possibility that the UE will 
return to Cell#0 in the RRC connected mode becomes higher. 
Finally, from Figures 7-9, we can conclude that the 
proposed CR-MLB scheme is especially effective in an 
environment where a lot of small-size data packets are 
transmitted by a large number of users. Note that in the 
simulations of Figures 7-9, we also evaluate the throughput 
gains of HO-MLB and confirm that those of CR-MLB are 
superior or comparable to those of HO-MLB for all cases if 
we adopt a policy where the ping-pong HO rate is kept 
below 15%. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have proposed a novel MLB scheme 
based on CR that works in coordination with MRO. The 
conventional MLB schemes based on HO conflict with MRO 
and the simulation results show that the conventional MLB 
scheme cannot achieve load balancing gain without some 
degradation in HO performance. The proposed scheme 
adjusts the CR parameters but not the HO parameters, and 
never conflicts with MRO. Through the computer 
simulations, it was demonstrated that the proposed scheme 
can realize load balancing effectively on a par with 
conventional schemes without any degradation in HO 
performance. The simulation results have also shown that the 
proposed scheme is particularly effective in an environment 
where a lot of small-size data packets are transmitted by a 
large number of users, which is highly applicable to current 
mobile networks with explosive diffusion of smart phones. 
In such case, more than 10% and 90% gains can be obtained 
in the total throughput and 5th percentile user throughput, 
respectively.
