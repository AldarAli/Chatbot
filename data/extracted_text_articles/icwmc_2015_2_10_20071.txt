Abstract—In recent years, due to the increasing number of 
computers and smartphones which can detect Wi-Fi signals, 
wireless local area networks (WLAN) have been installed 
almost everywhere. WLAN based indoor positioning systems 
have been widely investigated and used, because of their 
accessibility, low cost and not requiring any additional 
hardware support.  This study presents a Wi-Fi based 
trilateration method for indoor positioning using Received 
Signal Strength (RSS) measurements. The distances between 
Access Points (AP) and the mobile device were estimated from 
evaluated RSS values by signal propagation model. The 
position of the mobile device was estimated using these 
distances through trilateration method. The application was 
carried out in the line-of-sight region.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Indoor positioning systems are used to determine the 
position of people and objects in indoor environments. 
Nowadays, many people are spending most of their time in 
gigantic structures [1], thus the importance of indoor 
positioning systems is increasing. People want to reach 
accurate positioning in indoor environment which is obtained 
by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) systems for 
the outside of the buildings. In the GNSS system, the 
conditions needed are a direct line of sight between the 
receiver and the satellites and the connection of at least four 
satellites simultaneously. The desired accuracy cannot be 
possible to achieve with GNSS systems in indoors 
environments. Hence, the emergence of other systems and 
approaches in determining indoor positioning has become 
inevitable. In the indoor environment, some technologies 
have started to use systems, such as; Wi-Fi [2]-[7], GNSS 
like systems [8], radio frequency identification (RFID) [9], 
Ultra Wide Band [10], ZigBee [11], Camera [12] and 
infrared. Among these technologies, Wi-Fi based indoor 
positioning is a very popular technology because of its 
widespread 
utilization 
in 
mobile 
devices 
(laptop, 
smartphone, etc.). Moreover, wireless signals are accessible 
everywhere like shopping malls, campuses, airports, 
exhibition halls, office buildings, warehouses, underground 
parking and even homes. So, Wi-Fi based indoor positioning 
does not require any additional equipment and associated 
cost for indoor positioning applications.  
This paper proposes an indoor positioning system to 
estimate the position of the mobile device by using 
trilateration method which uses Received Signal Strength 
(RSS) data from Wi-Fi access points.  The study consists of 
two main stages; the first stage is distance estimation. In this 
stage, the distance between APs and the mobile device is 
obtained by RSS values simultaneously from 4 access points 
by signal propagation model. In the second stage, the 
position of the mobile phone is calculated by four distances 
via trilateration algorithm. 
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In the next 
section, we present the distance estimation stage. Path loss 
model were also described in this section. Section 3 explains 
the position estimation stage using trilateration technique. 
Application has been presented in Section 4. Finally, Section 
5 concludes with a summary of results and gives possible 
future research.

DISTANCE ESTIMATION 
In Wi-Fi based indoor positioning, establishment of 
correct relationship between distance and received signal 
strength is very important in order to obtain accurate 
positioning. However, due to the reflection, refraction and 
attenuation effects of signals, modelling of this relationship 
is very difficult in an indoor environment. RSS-based indoor 
positioning is also affected by environmental changes and 
the fluctuation of the RSS values restricts the accuracy of the 
estimation. Even in line-of-sight area RSS values are

continuously changing because of the signal attenuation. In 
literature, many Wi-Fi based signal propagation models have 
been used to model signal propagation. In this study, a model 
proposed by Chipcon [1][7] was used. The formulas of this 
approach are explained below.

The value n is the signal propagation constant, where d is 
the distance between the mobile phone and access points, 
and A is the received signal strength in a meter’s distance 
from the AP. The value A was obtained experimentally from 
a meter’s distance to the AP. The constant n was calculated 
using (2). Using (1), the distances between AP’s and the 
mobile phones are calculated in terms of RSSI values.  
 
III. 
POSITION ESTIMATION 
Trilateration is a method that determines the position of 
an object based on simultaneous range measurements from at 
least three references APs at known locations. To calculate 
the position of the mobile devices through trilateration 
technique, (3-8) were used [5][6];

where d1, d2, d3 and d4 are established distances between 
AP’s and mobile device. (X1, Y1, Z1), (X2, Y2, Z2), (X3, Y3, 
Z3) and (X4, Y4, Z4) are the known coordinates of APs. The

the design of the trilateration based indoor positioning 
system.  
 
IV. 
APPLICATION 
The test-bed is the Line of Sight (LoS) indoor 
environment that covers a 7.87m x 10.28m area. This system 
consists of 4 access points which were placed in corners of 
the area and a mobile phone. The mobile phone which has an 
android operating system is capable of Wi-Fi access and 
receiving Wi-Fi signals from all AP’s in the vicinity. Four 
similar access points transmit the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi signals 
(IEEE 802.11n) simultaneously. These signals are received 
by the mobile phone and are regulated through Java codes 
(Mac Address of AP’s, signal frequency, signal rate in dBm) 
which works integrated into Android operating system. 
Using (1) and (2), the distances between the access points 
and the mobile phone were estimated using RSSI values. 
Using these distance data, the position of the mobile phone 
was 
estimated 
through 
trilateration 
technique. 
This 
application was carried out at 34 different points and the 
geometric distribution of the points was shown in Figure 2. 
Measurements were conducted 100 times for each of these 
points and the mean values were depicted in Figure 3. 
Known coordinates of these points were obtained by precise 
geodetic method. 
 
Figure 1.  Trilateration method. 
The results show that positioning accuracy of this system 
ranges from 1.3 m to 8.6 m in an indoor environment and the 
mean accuracy of the system is 4.2 m (red line in Figure 3). 
The standard deviation of the mean is 1.845 meters and  it 
passed the χ2 test at 95% confidence level. Although some of 
the values are enough for many indoor positioning 
applications, it is very difficult to say that the system has 
enough accuracy for most of the points.

V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Wi-Fi is prevalent in most public buildings, such as 
campuses, shopping malls, hospitals, museum, exhibitions 
and even homes. So, Wi-Fi based indoor positioning 
systems do not require any additional infrastructure and 
cost. The user can use these systems using their mobile 
devices which can reach Wi-Fi signals.  
This method proposes the cost effective solution to the 
users. This experiment was carried out along the hallways 
where all AP’s were located at the line-of-sight to the 
mobile device. The Wi-Fi signals between APs and a 
mobile device are very sensitive to extraneous noise, thus 
the estimated distances are very inaccurate, even in the 
LoS area. Due to errors in the received signal strength, the 
distance between the transmitter and the receiver cannot be 
correctly calculated, and this leads to incorrect position 
estimation. To obtain a more accurate solution, the 
fluctuations of signals should be regulated by using other 
methods and algorithms. 
This application was conducted in Line-of-Sight area 
and static measurements were evaluated. In our future 
work, we will apply kinematic application at more 
complicated area.  Moreover, we intend to perform other 
path loss models and position estimation methods with the 
integration of inertial sensors to obtain more accurate 
position estimation.
