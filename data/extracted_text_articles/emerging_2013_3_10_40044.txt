 
QoS Equalization in a Multirate Loss Model of Elastic and Adaptive  
Traffic with Retrials 
 
Abstract—In this paper, we consider a single-link modeled as a 
loss system, which accommodates multirate traffic of elastic 
and adaptive calls. Calls arrive in the link according to a 
Poisson process, have a peak-bandwidth requirement while 
their service time is exponentially distributed. If the available 
link bandwidth is lower than the peak-bandwidth requirement 
of a new call, then the call can retry to be connected in the link 
with reduced bandwidth, one or more times (single/multi-retry 
loss model). If the available link bandwidth is still lower than 
the last bandwidth requirement of the call, then the call can be 
accepted in the link by compressing the bandwidth of all in-
service calls (of all service-classes) together with its last 
bandwidth requirement. In this multirate loss system, we study 
the effect of the bandwidth reservation (BR) policy on Call 
Blocking Probabilities (CBP) and link utilization. The BR 
policy achieves CBP equalization among calls of different 
service-classes, or guarantees a certain quality of service for 
each service-class. The proposed single/multi-retry loss models 
under the BR policy do not have a product form solution, and 
therefore we propose approximate recursive formulas for the 
efficient calculation of CBP and link utilization. Simulation 
results validate the results obtained by the analytical models. 
Keywords-Poisson process, elastic/adaptive traffic, call 
blocking, reservation, recurrent formula.  
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Multirate loss models based on recursive formulas 
provide an efficient way for the call-level QoS assessment 
in modern communication networks which accommodate 
elastic and adaptive traffic. In-service calls whose 
bandwidth can tolerate compression while at the same time 
their service time increases (so that the product service time 
by bandwidth is constant) compose elastic traffic. Adaptive 
traffic is a variation of elastic traffic in the sense that in-
service adaptive calls tolerate bandwidth compression 
without altering their service time. The call-level analysis of 
a single link that behaves as a loss system and 
accommodates elastic and adaptive calls of different 
service-classes is based on the classical Erlang Multirate 
Loss Model (EMLM) ( [1]- [2]). 
In the EMLM, calls arrive in the link according to a 
Poisson process (i.e., an infinite number of traffic sources is 
assumed) and compete for the available bandwidth under 
the Complete Sharing (CS) policy. According to the CS 
policy, new calls are blocked and lost only if their required 
bandwidth is higher than the available bandwidth of the 
link. Accepted calls cannot compress their assigned 
bandwidth and remain in the link for an arbitrarily 
distributed service time  [1]. The calculation of the steady-
state probabilities in the EMLM is based on a formula that 
has a Product Form Solution (PFS). The latter leads to an 
accurate calculation of Call Blocking Probabilities (CBP) 
via the well-known Kaufman-Roberts recursive formula  [1], 
 [2]. The existence of this recursive formula has led to 
numerous extensions of the EMLM in wired (e.g.,  [3]- [7]), 
wireless (e.g.,  [8]- [11]) and optical networks (e.g.,  [12]-
 [15]). In [16], an extension of the EMLM is proposed, 
whereby blocked calls can immediately retry one or more 
times (Single- and Multi-Retry Loss Model, SRM and 
MRM, respectively) to be connected in the link by 
requesting less bandwidth units (b.u.). A retry call is 
blocked and lost if its last bandwidth requirement is still 
higher than the available bandwidth of the link. In  [17], an 
extension of [16] is considered, whereby a single link 
accommodates elastic and adaptive traffic with single/multi 
retrials. We name the models of [17], Elastic-Adaptive 
Single-Retry Loss Model (EA-SRM) and Elastic-Adaptive 
Multi-Retry Loss Model (EA-MRM). Contrary to [16], if 
the available link bandwidth is less than the last bandwidth 
requirement of a retry call, the system compresses this 
bandwidth down to a minimum proportion of the last 
bandwidth requirement, together with the bandwidth of all 
in-service calls of all service-classes. If the resulting 
bandwidth requirement is not higher than the available link 
bandwidth, the retry call is accepted; otherwise is blocked 
and lost. When a call, whose bandwidth is compressed, 
departs from the system, then the remaining in-service calls 
expand their bandwidth. Due to retrials/compression, the 
EA-SRM and EA-MRM do not have a PFS. However, in 
[17], approximate recursive formulas are proposed for the 
calculation of the link occupancy distribution and CBP. In 
[18], 
elastic/adaptive 
calls 
have 
several 
bandwidth 
requirements and request for bandwidth, upon their arrival, 
according to the occupied link bandwidth (i.e., calls do not 
retry).

In this paper, we study the effect of the Bandwidth 
Reservation (BR) policy in the EA-SRM and EA-MRM. 
The BR policy is used in order to achieve CBP equalization 
among different service-classes, or guarantee a certain QoS 
for each service-class. Although the proposed models do not 
have a PFS, we propose approximate but recursive formulas 
for the calculation of the link occupancy distribution, and 
consequently, CBP and link utilization. Simulation results 
validate the proposed models and show very good accuracy.  
This paper is organized as follows. In Section  II, we 
review the EA-SRM and the EA-MRM. In Section III, we 
present the proposed models under the BR policy and 
provide formulas for the approximate calculation of the link 
occupancy distribution, CBP and link utilization. In Section 
IV, we present analytical and simulation results in order to 
evaluate the models’ accuracy. We conclude in Section V.

REVIEW OF THE EA-SRM AND EA-MRM 
A. 
Review of the EA-SRM 
Consider a link of capacity C b.u. that accommodates K 
service-classes. Let Ke and Ka be the set of elastic and 
adaptive service-classes (Ke+Ka=K), respectively. Let also T 
> C be the limit (in b.u.) that determines the maximum 
permitted bandwidth compression among calls. Service-class 
k calls (k = 1,…, K) follow a Poisson process with rate λk, 
request bk b.u. (peak-bandwidth requirement) and have an 
exponentially distributed service time with mean
k 1
  .  
Let j be the occupied link bandwidth, j=0,1,…,T, when a 
service-class k call arrives in the link. Now, we consider the 
following cases: a) If j+bk C, the call is accepted in the link 
with bk b.u. b) If j+bk > C, then the call is blocked with bk 
and retries immediately to be connected in the link with bkr < 
bk. Now if: b1) j + bkr  C the retry call is accepted in the 
system with bkr and

, b2) j + 
bkr > T the retry call is blocked and lost and b3) C < j + bkr  
T the retry call is accepted in the system by compressing its 
bandwidth requirement bkr together with the bandwidth of all 
in-service calls of all service-classes. In that case, the 
compressed 
bandwidth 
of 
the 
retry 
call 
becomes 
'
kr
kr
kr
kr
C
b
rb
j +b b


where r is the compression factor, 
common to all service-classes. Similarly, all in-service calls, 
which have been accepted in the link with bk (or bkr), 
compress their bandwidth to 
'
k
k
b
 rb
(or 
'
kr
kr
b
 rb
) for k = 
1,…,K. After the compression of all calls the link state is j = 
C. The minimum value that the compression factor can take 
is given by rmin = C/T.   
When a service-class k call, with bandwidth 
'
kb (or 
'
kr
b ), 
departs from the system, the remaining in-service calls of 
each service-class i (i=1,…,K), expand their bandwidth in 
proportion to their initially assigned bandwidth bi (or bir). 
After bandwidth compression/expansion, all elastic service-
class k calls (k =1,…,Ke) increase/decrease their service time 
so that the product service time by bandwidth remains 
constant. Adaptive service-class calls do not alter their 
service time. 
The existence of retrials and the bandwidth compression 
mechanism destroys reversibility in the model and therefore 
no PFS exists. However, in [17] an approximate recursive 
formula is proposed for the calculation of the un-normalized 
values of the link occupancy distribution, G(j):

The proof of (1) is based on: 1) the application of local 
balance between adjacent states, which exists only in PFS 
models, 2) an approximation, expressed by γkr(j) in (1), 
which assumes that the occupied link bandwidth from retry 
calls of service-class k is negligible when j C–(bk–bkr) and 
3) an approximation that refers only to those service-class k 
calls whose bkr > 0; it is expressed by γk(j) in (1) and 
assumes that the occupied link bandwidth from service-class 
k calls accepted in the system with bk b.u. is negligible when 
j > C.  
Having determined G(j)’s we can calculate CBP and link 
utilization. The final CBP of a retry service-class k call, Bkr,

(4).   
III. 
THE PROPOSED EA-SRM & EA-MRM UNDER THE 
BR POLICY 
The application of the BR policy in the EA-SRM and 
EA-MRM follows the analysis of Roberts in [21], who 
proposed an approximate but recursive formula for the 
calculation of G(j)’s in the EMLM under the BR policy.  
The calculation of the un-normalized values of G(j)’s in 
the EA-SRM under the BR policy (EA-SRM/BR) is based 
on the following recursive formula:

The recursive formulas (9), (10) are based on the

. The BR policy is used to attain CBP equalization 
among calls of different service-classes that share a link by 
a proper selection of the BR parameters. If, for example, 
CBP equalization is required between two service-classes 
whose calls require b1=1 and b2=5 b.u., respectively, then 
t(1) = 4 b.u and t(2) = 0 b.u. so that b1 + t(1) = b2 + t(2). 
Note that t(1) = 4 b.u means that 4 b.u. are reserved to 
benefit calls of the 2nd service-class.

link, then (10) takes the form:

APPLICATION EXAMPLE - EVALUATION 
We present an application example in order to compare 
the analytical CBP and link utilization results of the EA-
MRM/BR with those obtained by simulation.  To show the 
necessity of the proposed model we also present the 
analytical results of the MRM, MRM/BR and EA-MRM. 
Simulation results are mean values of 7 runs. In all figures 
of this section we present only mean values, since the 
reliability ranges of the measurements (assuming 95% 
confidence interval) are very small. The simulation 
language used is Simscript II.5  [24].  
Consider a link of capacity C = 80 b.u. that 
accommodates Poisson arriving calls from three different 
service-classes. Calls of the 1st and 2nd service-class are 
adaptive and are not allowed to retry while calls of the 3rd 
service-class are elastic and may retry two times. Their 
bandwidth requirements are: b1=1 b.u., b2=2 b.u. and b3=6 
b.u., respectively. The reduced bandwidth of the 3rd service-
class calls for two retrials is: 
b3 r 1
=5 b.u. and 
b3 r 2
=4 b.u. To 
equalize the final CBP of all service-classes we choose the 
BR parameters t(1)=3, t(2)=2, t(3)=0, since: b1 +  t(1) = b2 + 
t(2) = 
b3 r 2
+ t(3). The call holding time is exponentially 
distributed with mean value:

The initial values of the offered traffic-load are: α1=20

class we assume that: α3b3=

. In the x-axis of 
all figures, we keep constant the value of α3=2 erl, while α1, 
α2 increase in steps of 1.0 and 0.5 erl, respectively. The last 
values are: α1=28 erl, α2=10 erl. Three values of T are 
examined: a) T = C =80 b.u., where no bandwidth 
compression takes place and the EA-MRM/BR gives the 
same CBP and link utilization results with the MRM/BR, b) 
T =82 b.u. where rmin = C/T =80/82 and c) T =84 b.u. where 
rmin = C/T =80/84. In Figs. 1-3, we present the analytical 
and simulation CBP results of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd service-
class (CBP of calls with
b3 r 2
), respectively, for all values of 
T. In Fig. 4, we present the corresponding link utilization 
results. All figures show that the analytical results obtained 
by the EA-MRM/BR are of absolutely satisfactory accuracy, 
compared to simulation and that the MRM/BR fails to 
approximate the behaviour of EA-MRM/BR. This is 
expected 
since 
in 
the 
MRM/BR 
the 
bandwidth 
compression/expansion mechanism is not incorporated. 
Similarly, the results obtained by the MRM and the EA-
MRM fail to approximate the behaviour of the EA-
MRM/BR since the BR policy is not applied in these 
models. Furthermore, Figs. 1-3 show that the existence of 
the bandwidth compression/expansion mechanism in the 
EA-MRM/BR reduces CBP even for small values of T. This 
CBP decrease results in the increase of link utilization in the 
EA-MRM/BR compared to the MRM/BR (Fig. 4).

V. 
CONCLUSION 
We propose multirate loss models for a link that 
accommodates elastic and adaptive calls, under the 
bandwidth reservation policy. Calls of all service-classes 
arrive in the link according to a Poisson process and have an 
initial peak-bandwidth requirement. If this bandwidth 
requirement is not available then calls are blocked and may 
immediately retry to be connected in the system one (EA-
SRM/BR) or more times (EA-MRM/BR). If a retry call is 
blocked with its last bandwidth, it can still be accepted in 
the system by compressing its last bandwidth together with 
the bandwidth of all in-service calls of all service-classes. 
We propose approximate but recursive formulas for the 
efficient CBP calculation. Simulation CBP and link 
utilization results verify the corresponding analytical results.
