Abstract- The detection of concealed weapons is one of the biggest 
challenges facing the security community. It has been shown that 
each weapon can have a unique fingerprint, which is an 
electromagnetic signal determined by its size, shape, and physical 
composition. Extracting the signature of each weapon is one of 
the major tasks of any detection system. This paper addresses the 
issue of identifying conductive objects based on their response to 
electromagnetic fields. A system developed at Newcastle 
University using a walk-through metal detector with a giant 
magneto-resistive sensor array to measure the spatial magnetic 
field is used in the study. Threat and non-threat objects have 
been tested. Image visualization and feature extraction of the 
electromagnetic field were carried out. Classification was 
performed using cross correlation. Promising results indicating 
the feasibility of using electromagnetic imaging to identify objects 
have been found. 
 
Keywords- sensor array; electromagnetic imaging; weapon

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
There is a growing need for effective, quick and reliable 
security methods and techniques to identify weapon threats 
using new screening devices [1]. Electromagnetic (EM) 
weapon detection has been used for many years, but object 
identification and discrimination capabilities are limited. Many 
approaches and systems/devices have been proposed and 
realised for security in airports, railway stations, courts, etc. 
The fact that most weapons are made of metallic materials 
makes EM detection methods the most prominent and 
systems/devices built on the principle of EM induction have 
been prevalent for many years for the detection of suspicious 
metallic items carried covertly [2]. Walk-through metal 
detector (WTMD) and Hand-held metal detector (HHMD) are 
commonly used devices for detecting metallic weapons and 
contraband items using the EM field. Most of the WTMD and 
HHMD units use active EM techniques to detect a metal 
objects [1, 3, 4] see Fig. 1. Active EM means that the detector 
sets up a field by a source coil and this field is used to probe 
the environment. The applied/primary field induces eddy 
currents in the metal under inspection which then generate a 
secondary magnetic field that can be sensed by a detector coil. 
The rate of decay and the spatial behaviour of the secondary 
field 
are 
determined 
by 
the 
conductivity, 
magnetic 
permeability, shape, and size of the target. Sets of 
measurements can be then taken and used to recover the 
position, the size and the shape of the objects. 
 
 
Many other EM techniques have been also used in WTMD, 
such as Microwave imagers based on the EM Reflectometer 
principal [5], a wide bandwidth, time-domain EM sensor 
system to measure the eddy current time-decay response of a 
wide variety of metal targets [6], other advanced EM technique 
such as a magnetic real-time tracking vector gradiometer RTG 
using high-resolution fluxgate magnetometers used for 
incorporation into an unmanned underwater vessel to improve 
mine detection which comprises three primary three axis 
sensors and one three-axis reference sensor [7]. 
Currently available weapons detection systems are 
primarily used to detect metal and have a high false alarm rate 
because the WTMD works on adjusting threshold to 
discriminate between threat items and personal items, 
depending on the mass of the objects which means increasing 
the false alarm level (Fig. 2) [8, 9], also a human body has 
affected the sensitivity of the detector so when dealing with

low conductivity or small materials, the human body could 
give a stronger signal than the material. This would cause the 
material to pass undetected, giving poor reliability [10]. 
 
 
 
It can be concluded that the current EM imaging systems 
have several drawbacks such as: low-resolution images, the 
shape captured of EM signal not corresponding to the actual 
shape of objects, lack of detection with multiple objects, high 
cost for the 2-D array and the signal received correspond to the 
metal part only. 
The aim of this study is to improve the characterisation 
capabilities of EM systems, especially in terms of object 
identification and classification, using visualization of an EM 
signal. A system developed at Newcastle University [11] and 
built in a lab using an ex-service CEIA WTMD, with the 
addition of a giant magneto-resistive (GMR) sensor array to 
capture the EM data, is used in this study. Features are 
extracted and integrated from the EM image to visualize, 
identify and classify metallic objects using cross correlation 
techniques. 
This paper is organized as follows: Section II will describe 
the system design and set up. Section III will present the details 
of the classification approach and results and is followed by the 
conclusions and future work in Section IV. 
 
II. 
 TEST SYSTEM AND PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION 
A.  System design 
The system used for the experimental tests is based around 
an array of NVE GMR sensors [12] used in conjunction with 
the excitation coil in an ex-service CEIA WTMD. Fig. 3 shows 
a block diagram of the system. 
Fig. 4 illustrates the experimental system, converted from a 
typical walk through system. The signals from the sensor array 
are amplified using an array of signal amplifiers based on 
INA111 instrumentation amplifier. Data acquisition is 
performed using an 80 channel PXI based National instruments 
data acquisition system. The use of the PXI based system 
allows data to be acquired on 40 channels at a rate of 125kS/s 
or 80 channels at a rate of 62.5kS/s. The channel count is 
further increased to a maximum of 160 by the use of 
multiplexer circuits. A variable excitation waveform is 
provided by a function generator, the signal from which is also 
used for data acquisition synchronisation. The signal is 
amplified by a Kepco BOP 36-12ML bipolar power supply 
operating in constant current mode. 
 
 
 
 
The AAL002-02 GMR sensors were chosen because of 
their sensitivity and noise suppression compared with other 
common sensors such as Hall Effect models [13]. The 
AAL002-02 has a linear range of 0.15mT–1.05mT and a 
sensitivity of 4.5μV/T. The L in the sensor model name 
indicates that low hysteresis (maximum 2%) GMR material has 
been used fabricate the sensor, this was chosen because it was 
initially intended to utilise an applied magnetic field varying 
from 0 to a maximum value and the lower hysteresis would 
minimise error at low fields. However, after initial tests, it was 
found that a more stable signal could be achieved by biasing

the sensor response into its linear region using a DC offset 
superimposed on the excitation signal.  
B. Electromagnetic field imaging 
Fig. 5 illustrates the different metallic objects and their EM 
field images. The samples represent common threat and 
personal objects carried by peoples. Five experiments have 
been carried out with each item and their capturing condition 
can be summarized below: 
 
1. The object under inspection is moved through the 
detector with data acquired at a pulse repetition rate 
of 500Hz. 
2. Sets of 10 pulses are averaged to produce a single 
pulse response to improve signal-to-noise ratio.  
3. A single value is computed from each pulse response. 
In this case the maximum value of the difference 
signal (with object and without object) has been used.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 5: Samples with the equivalent EMIs. 
Thus the temporal EM field distribution as the object 
moves past the array can be determined. The sensors array is 
aligned with the coil to pick up any distortions in the applied 
field due to the presence of metallic materials, the interaction 
between the applied field and any sensor in the array will be 
capture and the pulse response from a group of sensors will be 
stored. If no object is present in the WTMD, the field measured 
by the sensor is unchanged; the presence of a metallic object 
causes a distortion of the field, which can then be measured by 
the sensor. 
In the system, pulsed excitation is applied to the coil. 
Pulsed excitation provides the opportunity to apply an 
interrogating field with rich frequency components in a single 
waveform. In the tests detailed in this paper, a pulse repetition 
frequency of 500Hz is used with a pulse width of 1ms and an 
applied current of 0.5A – 1.5A.  
C. Transient analysis 
In order to extract more information about the objects in the 
WTMD from the test results, a form of transient analysis has 
been employed. In this transient EM signature imaging 
technique, the pulse response from each sensor is analysed and 
processed into sections, or time slots, as shown in Fig. 6a. 
The values of the samples in each time slot are averaged, 
and using the data from all sensors for the whole test, an image 
is built up for each time slot. Fig. 6b shows a sequence of these 
transient images for the hunting knife. 
 
III. 
OBJECT CLASSIFICATION 
Analysis of the transient image sequence can be used to 
extract more information about the object under examination 
especially for object classification. For example, it has been 
observed that aluminium objects exhibit a tendency for the EM 
signature to appear later in the image sequence and to increase 
in intensity over time. In contrast, the EM signatures 
corresponding predominantly to ferromagnetic objects, such as 
the hunting knife, have a tendency to appear earlier in the 
sequence, peak in amplitude at a particular point and to change

in distribution over time. Consequently, through analysis of the 
image sequence generated by the transient analysis, any object 
detected by the system can be classified. An example of this is 
shown in Fig. 7, where a cross correlation technique has been 
applied to the transient image sequence [14] and processed to 
classify the objects into paramagnetic (aluminium=AL-block), 
ferromagnetic (steel=ST-block) and combinations of both. Fig. 
7a represents a maximum cross correlation values between 
each two frames. Fig. 7b shows the result of computing the 
ratio between two peaks which are evident in the cross 
correlation plot shown in Fig. 7a, where different objects have 
unique transient features reflecting materials and geometrical 
characters. The results can be applied for object classification 
and are sorted by ascending amplitude. It can be seen from Fig. 
7b and Table 1 that a clear distinction can be made between 
paramagnetic, ferromagnetic and mixed objects thus allowing 
very good discrimination.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper has demonstrated a new EM metal detector 
system and investigated the feasibility of visualizing the EM 
signal in a WTMD for object identification and classification 
purposes. A system to obtain the EM images has been built and 
features have been selected using the cross correlation between 
14 EM frames to discriminate between the 20 different objects 
depending on the material properties. The system show 
promising results for the visualisation of EM signal especially 
in security applications. 
In comparison with conventional induction based WTMDs, 
the GMR array based system has shown great potential in 
material discrimination as the samples are made from mixed 
material is clearly distinguished. Whereas the induction based 
WTMD can only discriminate between metal and non-metal, 
this system has taken it a step further. The proposed cross 
correlation 
technique 
is 
more 
advanced 
in 
object 
characterisation as it depends on the amplitude distribution of 
the EM field making training possible using a database of 
objects; unlike traditional thresholding adopted in the induction 
based system, which largely depends on material volume. On 
the whole the conventional WTMD based system had a 
limitation to present results in images, however, the proposed 
system has superior performance when using proposed sensor 
in terms of using imaging for localisation and material 
discrimination as buttressed by the results discussed in this 
paper. 
The discrimination capabilities of the system could be 
developed to the point that individuals could pass through the 
system without removing metallic objects from their person. 
This would be realised through “training” the system to 
identify threat objects by presenting the system with a wide 
variety of threat and non-threat objects and programming the 
response accordingly. 
Further study is necessary to extend these results to smaller 
metallic objects in not controlled environment to investigate 
concealed weapons. EM images from other objects will be 
investigated and compared with the results of this study. Other 
features such as: metallic density, total area of metallic density
