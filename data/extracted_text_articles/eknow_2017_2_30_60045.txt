Abstract—This paper presents the evaluation of two graph-based
recommendation methods compared to collaborative ﬁltering as
the baseline. The evaluation is primarily based on the investiga-
tion of the Average Receiver operating Characteristic curve on
the MovieLens dataset. The presented methods operate on the
knowledge graph, which information representation technique is
also discussed in this paper. The evaluation results show that
combining a network based and a user interest based method
leads to a more stable performance and an increase in the
recommendation quality.

INTRODUCTION
Collaborative ﬁltering and content-based ﬁltering are two
prominent classes of the recommender systems. The essence of
collaborative ﬁltering is that the recommendations are derived
only from user-item interactions. Content-based techniques
primarily focus on item attributes. Thinking in general, uti-
lizing the user attributes can also be treated as a content-based
technique. Our work is based on a graph based information
representation technique, which is capable to represent user-
item interactions, item attributes and user attributes at the
same abstraction level. We call this representation technique
the knowledge graph. This technique can be treated as a
hybridization method at the information representation level.
Graph based recommender systems provide an alternative
aspect to the widely used, matrix or tensor oriented meth-
ods. An advantage of the graph based representation is the
potential to develop recommendation methods operating on
networks. Referring to the results of network science, utilizing
networks, the calculation methods can be improved regarding
to their robustness and stability. In addition, the graph based
representation has the capability to represent heterogeneous
information sources and to provide a general information rep-
resentation method. Working with heterogeneous information
can be helpful to eliminate the cold start problem, as the more
information is available, the higher is the chance to connect
the current user to the items in the graph.
In our work, we focus on separating the information
representation method from the calculation methods. We do
this in order to have a clearer methodological approach. As the
representation method provides the hybridization technique,
two calculation methods, spreading activation and recommen-
dation spreading is described and compared to the perfor-
mance of collaborative ﬁltering. Recommendation spreading
basically alloys spreading activation and collaborative ﬁltering.
As recommendation spreading does not use any representation
technique to compress the adjacency matrix of the graph, we
compare the performance of recommendation spreading to the
performance of collaborative ﬁltering.
Grad-Gyenge et al. [1] evaluate recommendation spreading
and collaborative ﬁltering regarding to the mean absolute error
(MAE) and the coverage of the mentioned methods. As list
based recommendations are more in the focus of interest
of the research on recommendation techniques, a Receiver
operating Characteristic (RoC) based evaluation of the methods
is presented. In order to adapt the RoC measure to the ﬁeld of
recommender systems, the Average Receiver operating Charac-
teristic (ARoC) evaluation method is introduced. Providing an
overview of the performance of the evaluated method, ARoC
interprets the RoC in the case of recommender systems, as
the RoC graphs are averaged over all users in the knowledge
graph. The result is a more robust measure and a smoother
graph. An additional advantage of the evaluation method is
that it also provides information about the completeness of
the list of retrieved items.
The contribution of the paper can be summarized as
follows. The evaluation results show that regarding to the
ARoC, recommendation spreading is capable to incorporate the
advantages of spreading activation and collaborative ﬁltering,
thus we show that the information found in the network can
stabilize rating value based methods and also vice versa. The
information found in rating values can improve the network
based calculation. We also show that in the information sparse
case, the rating estimation based methods show better perfor-
mance than ranking based methods.
Section II presents related research conducted. Section III
discusses the graph based information representation tech-
nique. Section IV describes the recommendation methods eval-
uated in the paper. Section V introduces ARoC, the evaluation
method. Section VI presents the results of the evaluation.
Section VII concludes the paper and gives insight into our
plans for the future.

RELATED WORK
To discuss related research conducted, we focus on graph
based information representation techniques, spreading activa-
tion based methods and RoC evaluation methods. Regarding
to graph based information representation and spreading ac-
tivation based techniques, the improvement presented in this
paper can be found in the performance of recommendation
spreading.
Although not widely used, the graph based information
representation technique presents in the ﬁeld of recommender

systems. State of the art research is also conducted on graph
based representation. Tiroshi et al. [2] involve graph repre-
sentation to work with social data. Lee et al. [3] represents
correlations between the entities in a graph. Similarly to the
representation presented in this paper, Lee at al. [4] represents
content-based and collaborative ﬁltering information in a het-
erogeneous graph.
Next to ontology representation, graphs are typically in-
volved to model the social relationships. To mention asym-
metric networks, Ziegler et al. [5], Guha et al. [6], Jsang et
al. [7], Massa et al. [8] calculate the recommendations with
the help of the trust network. Symmetric networks are also
involved, as He et al. [9], Konstas et al. [10] and Guy et
al. [11] calculate recommendations with the help of the social
network. Layered graphs, as less generalized approaches also
can be found in the literature. Cantador et al. [12] apply a
clustering technique on a multi-layered graph. Kazienko et
al. [13] calculate recommendations on a layered graph.
Representing heterogeneous information in the knowledge
graph is also in the focus of intense research. Burke et
al. [14] deﬁne a heterogeneous network in order to be able to
model various recommendation cases as user-based k-Nearest
Neighbors algorithm (k-NN) with the user-tag matrix, user-
based k-NN with the user-resource matrix, item-based k-NN
with the resource-tag matrix and item-based k-NN with the
resource-user matrix. Yu et al. [15] introduce the PathSim
measure to compare paths in the knowledge graph to measure
the similarity between the observed and the potential paths.
Catherine et al. [16] derive recommendations with a proba-
bilistic logic approach on the knowledge graph. Hu et al. [17]
present label propagation for lead generation. Kouki et al. [18]
deﬁne a probabilistic framework as a hybridization technique.
Spreading activation is widely used in different domains
to derive recommendations. Alvarez et al. deﬁne ONTO-
SPREAD, a well-elaborated, spreading activation based met-
hod for medical systems [19]. Troussov et al. present the
investigation of different decay conﬁgurations of spreading
activation in a tag aware recommendation scenario [20]. Gao
et al. argue that the domain knowledge and user interests
on items are to be represented in the same ontology [21].
Blanco-Fernandez et al. utilize spreading activation to conduct
content based reasoning [22]. In their work, they model the
semantics of the preferences of the users. They stress out that
spreading activation is a potential method to avoid overspe-
cialisation. Jiang et al. utilize spreading activation to calculate
recommendations on an ontology based user model [23]. The
primary goal of Hussein et al. is to close the gap between
context-awareness and self-adaptation [24]. To perform this
task, SPREADR, a spreading activation based recommendation
method is deﬁned. Codina et al. present a semantic recom-
mendation method to estimate user ratings on items with a
reasoning technique [25]. In their work, the item score is
deﬁned as the weighted average of the related concepts.
Herlocker et al. describe a method to prepare the RoC
curve [26], which is a known evaluation technique in the
ﬁeld of recommender systems. They leave the deﬁnition of
the relevance of an item for the speciﬁc user open, thus
the relevance is to be deﬁned for the actual evaluation case.
For example, in the case of rating estimation methods, the
relevance can be deﬁned based on a threshold value. To draw
an RoC graph, the curve is started from the origin and an
iteration is conducted on the recommendation result list. For
each item, the relevance is determined. If the item is relevant,
then the curve is drawn one step vertically. If the item is
not relevant, then the curve is drawn one step horizontally.
Herlocker et al. deﬁne the RoC curve for the speciﬁed user.
As typically there are several users utilizing a recommender
system, a possible enhancement of the RoC should examine
the performance of the recommendation method regarding to
all users or a well deﬁned subset of users.
Cremonesi et al. also utilize the RoC curve to evaluate
their recommendation methods [27]. In their work, Cremonesi
et al. deﬁne two variants of the RoC curve and denote them as
ROC1 and ROC2. ROC1 uses a threshold based technique to
identify true positives, false positives, true negatives and false
negatives. ROC2 is suitable for ranked lists and is deﬁned for
both the binary and the non-binary case. An important aspect
of their work is that Cremonesi et al. use a user sampling
technique. To focus on users with relatively sparse on item
preferences, they evaluate their methods on the subset of users
containing users issued at most 99 ratings.
Improvements to the RoC curve can also be found in the
literature. Schein et al. introduce CROC, the Customer RoC
curve [28]. In their work, Schein et al. stress out the divergence
in the lengths of the recommendation lists of different users.
To solve this problem, they propose a technique to unify the
lengths of the recommendation lists and calculate the measures
necessary to produce the RoC curve based on the uniﬁed
lists. Also mentioning the problem of different lengths of
item lists, Schr¨oder et al. focuses on the ﬁrst n items of the
recommendation lists [29].
III.
REPRESENTATION TECHNIQUE
The advantage of the graph based knowledge base is the
capability to represent heterogeneous information sources in
the same structure. In this section, a modelling technique is
discussed, which is capable to store the information necessary
for both collaborative and content-based ﬁltering. In special
cases, this technique can also act as the background of rule
based systems. A similar representation technique is used by
Lee et al. [4], Burke et al. [14], Yu et al. [15], Kouki et al. [18]
and Grad-Gyenge et al. [1].
This section presents the deﬁnition of the information
representation method and also provides theoretical insights.
In order to clarify the approach, the concrete dataset and its
representation is described in this section.
A. Deﬁnition
The information is represented in a labelled multigraph.
We refer to it as the knowledge graph or the knowledge base
and deﬁne it in Equation (1).
K = (N, E, TN, TE, tN, tE, r),
(1)
where N represents the set of nodes in the graph, E ⊆
{{u, v}|u ∈ N ∧ v ∈ N ∧ u ̸= v} represents the set of
undirected edges between the nodes. TN denotes the set of
node types and TE denotes the set of edge types. The function
tN ⊂ N × TN assigns a node type to each node, the function
tE ⊂ E × TE assigns an edge type to each edge. The partial
function r ⊂ E × R assigns a rating value to speciﬁc edges.
The function is partial, as in most cases not all the edges

represent a rating. Although it is formally not deﬁned, in the
implementation, due to performance reasons, we avoid parallel
edges of the same type between the same pair of nodes. We
would also like to mention here that type assignments do not
inﬂuence the ﬁnal recommendation result and are introduced
for completeness.
B. MovieLens
The numerical experiment is conducted on the MovieLens
dataset [30]. Analysing the available MovieLens versions, we
decided to use the MovieLens 1M dataset, as in addition
to containing true rating values, this dataset is also rich in
user and item attributes. The user attributes are gender, age
category, occupation and ZIP code. The item attributes are
year of release and list of genres.
As illustrated in Fig. 1, the user and item attributes
are modelled in the knowledge graph similarly how seman-
tic networks represent the information. Light blue nodes as
Jaws, Forrest Gump and Chasing Amy represent the
items (movies). Lilac nodes as Person 1, Person2 and
Person3 represent the persons. Drab nodes as Romance
and Drama represent the genres. The gray node represents
the gender Male. The blue node represents the occupation
Scientist. The light brown node represents the release year
1997. The green node represents the ZIP region 2. The
red node represents the age category 25-34.
Each user is represented with a node of type Person.
A node type is introduced to represent each kind of user
attributes. To represent the user attributes, a node of the appro-
priate type is created for each attribute value. Nodes of type
Gender represent the genders. Nodes of type AgeCategory
represent the age categories. Nodes of type Occupation
represent the occupations. Nodes of type ZipCodeRegion
represent the zip code regions. In this case the ﬁrst digit of the
zip code is used as it determines the U.S. region. To model that
a user has a speciﬁc attribute value, the node representing the
user is connected to the node representing the attribute value
with an edge of the appropriate type. To model this informa-
tion, edge types PersonGender, PersonAgeCategory,
PersonOccupation and PersonZipCodeRegion are
introduced, respectively.
Each item is represented with a node of type Item.
To represent the item attributes, a node of the appropri-
ate type is created for each attribute value. Nodes of type
Genre represent the genres. An item can have multiple
genres. In this case, the item node is connected to mul-
tiple genre nodes. Nodes of type YearOfRelease rep-
resent the years of release. To model that an item has a
speciﬁc attribute value, the node representing the item is
connected to the node representing the attribute value with
an edge of the appropriate type. To model this informa-
tion, edge types PersonGender, PersonAgeCategory,
PersonOccupation and PersonZipCodeRegion are
introduced, respectively.
The MovieLens 1M dataset contains 1 000 209 true ratings.
Each true rating consists of an item, an user, a rating value
and a time-stamp the rating event has been recorded at. The
rating values are integer numbers and are in the interval [1, 5].
In our experiment, the rating values are normalized and are
transformed linearly into the interval [0.2, 1] by a division by
5. We denote the set of known true rating events with T and
an element of the set with t. To access the attributes of true
rating t, t.u, t.i, t.v and t.t stands for the user, item, value
and time-stamp of rating t, respectively.
In the case a rating is added to the knowledge base, a
new edge of type ItemRating is created between the node
representing the user and the node representing the rated item.
The rating value is assigned to the edge using the function r.
C. The Limes of the Hybridization
To present the amount of information the methods operate
on in this experiment, Table I summarizes the count of nodes
and edges in the knowledge graph. Subtable Ia contains the
number of nodes of each node type. Subtable Ib presents the
number of edges of each edge type. The total number of nodes
is 10 062. The total number of edges not counting edges of type
ItemRating is 34 451.

The representation technique models the information nec-
essary to conduct both collaborative and content-based ﬁltering
methods. A properly deﬁned calculation method should treat
these information sources as general. It means that deriving
recommendations, the calculation method should process the
edges of different type at the same algorithmic abstraction
level.
In the cold start case, when the knowledge base is sparse
on ItemRating edges and is relatively dense on edges
representing content-based information, the recommendation
method can be treated as content-based. Thinking about the

magnitude of the number of edges of type ItemRating
(1 000 209) and other, content-based edges (34 451), as during
the operation, the knowledge base is ﬁlled with user interac-
tion, the recommendations are to be become more collabo-
rative. In other words, the hybridization technique inherently
ensures content-based recommendations in the cold start case
and inherently transforms the methods operating on the top of
it to be collaborative as it is populated with edges representing
user-item interaction.
IV.
RECOMMENDATION METHODS
In our experiment, collaborative ﬁltering, spreading activa-
tion, recommendation spreading and random recommendations
are evaluated. The methods are deﬁned in the following
subsections.
A. Collaborative Filtering
We utilize a representation technique, which gives a dif-
ferent aspect to the more or less traditional, matrix based
methods. Another problem of the matrix based representation
is the restricted ability to represent heterogeneous information
sources. A well researched direction to solve this issue is to
involve tensors and to conduct tensor factorization [31].
Collaborative ﬁltering [30] calculates rating estimations ba-
sically by averaging the known ratings on the item in question.
The weight of a rating is the similarity of the user issuing
the rating to the user the recommendations are generated for.
To be more exact, instead of aggregating the known ratings,
the differences from the mean ratings are averaged and then
addded to the mean rating of the user. The rating estimation
formula for user u on item i on our knowledge base is deﬁned
in Equation (2).
ˆru,i = ¯ru +
P
e∈Er,{v,i}=e,v̸=i,u̸=v (r(e) − ¯rv)su,v
P
e∈Er,{v,i}=e,v̸=i,u̸=v su,v
,
(2)
where ˆru,i denotes the estimated rating value for user u on
item i. The average of the known ratings is denoted by ¯ru.
To calculate the similarity between u and v, the Pearson
correlation formula is utilized on the rating values of the
common rated items.
B. Spreading Activation
Spreading activation [32] is widely used on ontologies,
semantic networks, associative networks and RDF knowledge
bases [33]. To utilize the method on the knowledge graph,
spreading activation is used to calculate ranking values for the
items. In this case no rating estimation is calculated.
Spreading activation is an iterative method with a step
limit (c) based termination criteria. To generate item rank-
ings, the method maintains the activation of the nodes. The
function a(i) ⊂ N × R assigns an activation value to each
node in the graph in each iteration step. In the initial step
the activation of the nodes is set to 0 except for ns, as
a(0)(ns) = 1. The notation ns stands for the source node,
the node representing the user.
During the iteration, the activation of the nodes is propa-
gated in the network. In each step, (i) a part of the activation
of the nodes is distributed to the neighbour nodes equally
and (ii) the activation of the nodes is relaxed. The parameter
spreading relax (rs) controls the amount of activation
to distribute. The parameter activation relax (ra) de-
termines the ratio the activation of the nodes are to be relaxed.
The update of the activation is conducted according to the rule
deﬁned in Equation (3).
a(i+1)(n) = raa(i)(n) + rs
X
m∈Mn
a(i)(m)
|Mn| ,
(3)
where n ∈ N, i ≥ 0. The set containing the neighbour nodes
of n is denoted with Mn, as Mn = {m|{m, n} ∈ E}.
The iteration is performed until the step limit (c) is
reached. The rank of each node is deﬁned as its activation after
the iteration has been stopped.
C. Recommendation Spreading
Recommendation spreading introduced by Grad-Gyenge et
al. can be treated as the generalization of collaborative ﬁltering
for the graph based knowledge base [1]. The method is based
on spreading activation but focuses on rating estimation. As
already discussed, collaborative ﬁltering deﬁnes a weighted
average of the known rating values. In the case of collaborative
ﬁltering, the weights are determined by the similarity of the
users. In the case of recommendation spreading, a distance
like measure is deﬁned between the user to generate the rec-
ommendations for and the edges representing the known rating
values. To calculate the distance, an iteration is conducted with
a step limit (c) based termination criteria. The activations
are calculated using the same formula as in the case of the
spreading activation. In each iteration step, the amount of ﬂown
through activation is summarized for the edges, as deﬁned in
Equation (4).
Ae =
X
i∈[0,s−1],m∈e,tN(m)=P erson
rs
a(i)(m)
|Mn| ,
(4)
where e ∈ E. The set containing the neighbour nodes of n is
denoted with Mn, as Mn = {m|{m, n} ∈ E}.
To estimate the rating of an item, recommendation spread-
ing calculates a weighted average. The weight of a rating is the
ﬂown through activation in the spreading iteration, as deﬁned
in Equation (5).
ˆru,i = ¯ru +
P
e∈Er,{v,i}=e,v̸=i,u̸=v (r(e) − ¯rv)Ae
P
e∈Er,{v,i}=e,v̸=i,u̸=v Ae
.
(5)
D. The Random Method
The random method is involved in the experiment for
the following reasons. Thinking about the no free lunch
theorem [34], the method can act as the theoretical baseline for
all the methods. The other reason to involve random recom-
mendations into the experiment is to control the mathematical
correctness of our evaluation measure. A more or less trivial
consequence of the deﬁnition of the RoC curve is that the
performance of random recommendations should show a minor
diagonal on the RoC graph.

E. List Recommendations
Collaborative ﬁltering and recommendation spreading cal-
culates a rating estimation for each item. Based on the rating
estimation of the items, the list of recommended items is
assembled by sorting the items in descending order by their
rating estimation. As spreading activation calculates a ranking
value for each item, the list of recommended items in this case
is assembled by sorting the items in descending order by their
rank.
We introduce function m as the notation for calculating
the list of the recommended items for user u using method m
over knowledge base K, as deﬁned in Equation (6).
mK(u).

V.
EVALUATION METHOD
The evaluation of the recommendation methods is con-
ducted with ARoC, a RoC based evaluation technique, which
is to be deﬁned in this section. An important parameter of
the evaluation method is the amount of rating edges to be
inserted in the knowledge base in addition to the content-based
information.
A. Initial Information
The evaluation of the recommendation techniques analysed
in this paper is strongly connected to the information content
contained in the knowledge base. Each evaluation starts with
a knowledge graph containing only the user and the item
attribute edges. In this case, there is no user preference stored
in the knowledge graph. To incorporate also user preference
information, a speciﬁed number of ratings is added to the
knowledge base by creating edges of type ItemRating. As
our intention is to model real-world applications, in this case,
the ﬁrst n ratings are selected from the true ratings in ascending
order by their time-stamp. The ﬁrst n ratings are called training
set and are denoted with Ti.
B. Deﬁnitions
The evaluation of the methods is based on the RoC curve.
Its essence is to plot the true positive rate (TPR) of the method
in question against its false positive rate (FPR) on a single plot.
RoC is typically used in the case of binary classiﬁcation. In our
experiment an item is deﬁned to be positive for a particular
user if the training data contains a true rating value higher
than a pre-deﬁned threshold. An item is deﬁned to be negative
if the value of the true rating is lower than the threshold.
To formalize it, the predicate p stands for the positive case
and the predicate n stands for the negative case as deﬁned in
Equations (7) and (8), respectively.
pΘ(u, i) = ∃t ∈ T : u = t.u ∧ i = t.i ∧ t.v ≥ Θ,
(7)
nΘ(u, i) = ∃t ∈ T : u = t.u ∧ i = t.i ∧ t.v < Θ.
(8)
Based on the predicates, the true positive and related
measures are to be deﬁned. The functions TP, FP, TN,
FN calculate the number of true positive, false positive, true
negative and false negative items, respectively. The functions
are deﬁned in Equations (9), (10), (11) and (12), recpectively.
TPΘ,k(u, l) = |{i ∈ I | pΘ(u, i) ∧ ∃j ≤ k : i = lj}|,
(9)
FPΘ,k(u, l) = |{i ∈ I | nΘ(u, i) ∧ ∃j ≤ k : i = lj}|,
(10)
TNΘ,k(u, l) = |{i ∈ I | nΘ(u, i)∧ ̸ ∃j ≤ k : i = lj}|,
(11)
FNΘ,k(u, l) = |{i ∈ I | pΘ(u, i)∧ ̸ ∃j ≤ k : i = lj}|.
(12)
Functions TP, FP, TN and FN count the items for user
u on the list of items l. The function attribute Θ speciﬁes the
threshold value. The function attribute k speciﬁes the length
the item list should be analized for.
The RoC curve is produced by plotting the TPR against
the FPR in a graph. The TPR is the ratio of positive items
retrieved compared to all the positive items. The FPR is the
ratio of negative items retrieved compared to all the negative
items. The functions are deﬁned in Equations (13) and (14),
recpectively.
TPRΘ,k(u, l) =
TPΘ,k(u, l)
TPΘ,k(u, l) + FNΘ,k(u, l),
(13)
FPRΘ,k(u, l) =
FPΘ,k(u, l)
FPΘ,k(u, l) + TNΘ,k(u, l).
(14)
The function TPR and FPR deliver the appropriate ratio
values for user u on the list of items l. The function attribute Θ
speciﬁes the threshold value. The function attribute k speciﬁes
the length the item list should be analized for.
The functions TPR and FPR are to be calculated for
a given user and list of items. In order to be able to plot
the RoC curve, a distinguished user has to be selected from
the knowledge base. As this selection procedure is not a
straightforward task, instead of calculating TPR and FPR for
a speciﬁc user, the average of these measures is calculated for
all the users in the dataset. For each user, the list of items
is delivered by the evaluated recommendation method, thus l
is to be substituted to mK(u) as presented in Equations (15)
and (16).
ATPRΘ,k(m) =
P
u∈U TPRΘ,k(u, mK(u))
|U|
,
(15)
AFPRΘ,k(m) =
P
u∈U FPRΘ,k(u, mK(u))
|U|
,
(16)
where m denotes the evaluated method. The method oper-
ates on the knowledge base K. The set U denotes the set of
users (U = {u ∈ N | tN(u) = Person}).

C. ARoC
Having the underlying measures deﬁned, an RoC based
evaluation method is to be introduced, the Average Receiver
operating Characteristic, the ARoC. The deﬁnition of the
ARoC is based on ATPR and AFPR. To draw the RoC
curve of method m, k is iterated from zero to the length of
the longest list of recommended items. For each value of k, a
mark is plotted onto the graph. The coordinates of the mark are
calculated as the value of ATPRΘ,k(m) and AFPRΘ,k(m).
As its name indicates, ARoC averages the RoC graphs over
all the users into a single graph. Thanks to the aggregation,
ARoC provides a more robust measure and also a smoother
graph. The difference between RoC and ARoC can also be
found in the drawing method. While the drawing of the RoC
curve is based on vertical and horizontal steps of the same unit,
the coordinates of the ARoC graph is deﬁned by the ATPR
and AFPR function. This is also the reason why the ARoC
graph is not necessarily a continuous curve.
The ATPRΘ,k and the AFPRΘ,k measures are calcu-
lated as the averages on the lists of recommended items for
the speciﬁed list length k. As mentioned in Section II, the
recommendation lists typically differ in their length, as the
reachable item nodes differ for each user. This is the reason
why the higher is value of k, the lower is the amount of the
averaged TPR and FPR measures.
Unlike random item selection, most recommendation meth-
ods do not retrieve the whole set of recommendable items. To
illustrate this phenomenon in the graph oriented aspect, it is
not ensured that all the items are linked to the users with the
appropriate path. Looking at the ARoC graphs presented in
Section VI, especially in the case of collaborative ﬁltering and
recommendation spreading, the graph of the methods do not
reach the upper-right corner because of the aforementioned
reason. We think about this property of the ARoC method as
a useful feature, as next to illustrating the TPR and FPR of the
methods, it also provides information about the completeness
of the retrieved items.

EVALUATION RESULTS
The methods described in Section IV are evaluated on the
MovieLens dataset represented in the knowledge graph deﬁned
in Section III. The evaluation is based on the ARoC curve as
deﬁned in Section V.
To evaluate the methods, various the following parameter
settings of Θ are evaluated 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0. Due to
space limitations, the 0.8 case is presented. This is also the
most representative case. To interpret the 0.8 value, items
with rating 4 or 5 are treated positive. Table II contains
the presented method conﬁgurations. Column Name contains
the short name of the method. Column Method holds the
type of the method. Column Configuration deﬁnes the
conﬁguration parameters of the methods if there is any. Our
past results [1] show that the examined methods are not
sensitive to the different ra and rs settings. These results are
not presented in this paper due to space limitations. Regarding
to the setting of c, those conﬁgurations are presented, which at
most represent the evaluation properties of the speciﬁc method.

As we are interested in how the amount of rating edges in
the knowledge base inﬂuences the performance of the methods,

the evaluation is organized into 4 scenarios. The scenarios
differ in the size of the training set (Ti). To refer to it later, the
10k, 20k, 40k and 200k shorthands are introduced for the
case with 10 000, 20 000, 40 000 and 200 000 rating values,
respectively. Fig. 2 contains the ARoC graph of the discussed
methods with different |Ti| settings in its subﬁgures.

The primary result of the evaluation is that RS outperforms
the other methods in all the 4 scenarios. The advantage of the
method stands out more in the information sparse (10k) and
in the information dense (200k) cases.
Comparing the CF and the SA, the performane of the
methods vary with the different amount of rating values in
the knowledge graph. While in the 10k scenario, the CF is
dominant, in the 20k case, the SA performs better. In the
40k and the 200k case, the CF performs better on the lower
domain of k than SA then the graph of the CF and the SA
are crossing each other. In these cases, the performance of the
methods is ambigously comparable.
Analysing the performance of the CF on high k values,
Fig. 2d shows that the performance of the CF falls below
the performance of the RND. Referring to the no free lunch
theorem [34], this is an important theoretical result. In addition,
the curve of the CF is not monotonic and is also not continous.
We explain it as follows. The ARoC measure is deﬁned to
show the average performance of the precision and recall
measures over all users of the dataset. As the length of
the recommendation lists grows, the amount of the averaged
measures decreases causing non-monotonicity.
As mentioned in Section V-C, an important feature of the
ARoC curve is that the coverage of the evaluated methods
can be read from its graph. For example, the curve of CF
on Fig. 2a does not reach the upper-right corner meaning that
the CF retrieves only a subset of relevant items for the users.
Analysing the methods from this aspect, it can be seen that the
SA has the highest coverage, the RS is the second highest
and the CF has the lowest performance. This result can be
explained with the restrictions on the path between the users
and the items. For example, in the case of the CF the path must
contain exactly 3 edges and the type of the edges should be
ItemRating. Regarding the current conﬁguration, the length
of the path of the RS is 5 and the type of the only last edge is
restricted. The restriction for the SA is the path length of 5. A
more trivial result is that the coverage of the methods grow as
the more rating values are contained in the knowledge base.
A minor result of the evaluation is that the graph of the
RND shows the minor diagonal.
B. Time need
Spreading activation based methods are computation in-
tense. This is the reason why we also summarize the time
need of the examined methods. Table III presents the time
need of the methods. Column Method contains the method
conﬁguration. Columns 10000, 20000, 40000 and 200000
contains the time necessary to generate the recommendations
to draw the ARoC curves in the 10k, the 20k, the 40k
and the 200k case, respectively. The execution times are the
total times of calculating 6 040 recommendations, as the ARoC
curve averages the performance of the method among the users
in the dataset.

The numerical experiments have been conducted in a vir-
tualised environment on a single computation core. The virtual
hardware conﬁguration is Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2650
@ 2.00GHz, 11GB of memory. Regarding the computational
resource need, the CF has the highest performance, SA is the
next and RS involves the most resources.

CONCLUSION
The performance of collaborative ﬁltering, spreading ac-
tivation and recommendation spreading is compared on the
MovieLens dataset. The methods operate on the knowledge
graph presented in Section III. The evaluation is based on
ARoC, which evaluation method is introduced in this paper.
Its essence is to average the RoC curves over all the users in
the dataset. The evaluation results present the ARoC graphs
of the methods in three different cases. The evaluation cases
are distinguished by the amount of rating information inserted
into the knowledge graph.
The SA calculates recommendations based on the structure
of the knowledge graph. The CF derives its recommendations
from user preferences on items. As its deﬁnition shows,
recommendation spreading alloys spreading activation and
collaborative ﬁltering. On one hand, the RS can be treated
as the generalization of the CF for the graph based case. On
the other hand, the RS can be treated as the extension of
the SA with the ability to incorporate rating values into the
recommendations process. The method has the capability to
both utilize the structure of the network to stabilize its per-
formance and to involve the explicit ratings as a sophisticated
declaration of the user afﬁnity to the recommendable items. To
draw a conclusion, the evaluation results show that regarding
to the ARoC, while the CF and the SA show a varying
performance, the RS successfully alloys the information found
in the structure of the network and the information found in the
user ratings. The price for the higher recommendation quality
is the higher computational resource need.
Thinking about the cold start problem and the information
sparse case, we would like to emphasize the evaluation case
1k. This is the case with the lowest amount of information
about user preferences on items. Also, this is the case, when
the methods involving the user ratings as an information source
provide a better performance than the ranking based spreading
activation. To draw a conclusion based on the results, the rating
values hold an important source of information, especially in
the information sparse environment.
Analysing the ARoC curves over the evaluation cases, the
graphs show that the performance of the methods decrease as
the more training data is added to the knowledge base. This
result lets us draw the same conclusion as described by Blanco-
Fernandez et al. [22], as spreading activation based methods
have the potential to avoid overspecialization.
In our future work, ﬁrst of all, we would like to extend
the evaluation scenarios to additional datasets. In addition,
at the moment, no representation learning techniques are
involved in the experiment. In order to further investigate the
methods, our plan is to apply SVD or other matrix factorization
technique to the adjacency matrix of the network and to involve
additional, matrix factorization recommendation techniques to
the evaluation.
