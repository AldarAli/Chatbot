Abstract—For estimating user’s location, Global Positioning
System (GPS) is very popular and important technique. The
GPS estimation uses satellites which ﬂy in the air. The estimator
needs the open sky and multiple satellites (usually 4 and more
satellites). However, there are many buildings in urban area.
The receiver tends to receive bad signals, called as non-line-
of-sight (NLOS) or multipath signals. The problem is that
the receiver cannot get direct path signals from adequate
number of the satellites coinstantaneously. This case leads
to degrade estimation quality. So, we introduce the novel
estimation algorithm, which can estimate own position with
as low number of satellites as possible.

I. INTRODUCTION
For next generation, a plan of Intelligent Transportation
System (ITS) is very attractive. ITS can resolve problems
such as trafﬁc accidents and jam. By realizing ITS, conve-
nient and safety life will be turn up. As a hot topic, electrical
vehicles and hybrid vehicles are famous. Compared to fossil
fuel, the electrical vehicles can miniaturize vehicle’s size.
Then, personal mobility, such as “Segway” and “Winglet”,
can be provided [1].
In development of high performance vehicles, own loca-
tion is one of important information. The most popular tech-
nique is Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS can estimate
user’s location by receiving signals from GPS satellites. In
our life, we have been getting beneﬁts of GPS already. Route
guidance by car navigation system or smart phones is very
useful. However, the estimation by GPS still has problems
[2], [3]. Especially, we cannot get own position precisely
in urban area. In urban area, there are a lot of structures
such as buildings. So, GPS receivers receive the signals from
the satellites via multipath propagation. Also, the receivers
cannot watch the satellites in line-of-sight (LOS) when the
satellites are shield by the structures. That is the case called
as non-line-of-sight (NLOS). In case of riding the personal
mobility and walking on street, users exist near building.
The harmful effect such as receiving multipath or shielded
signals often occurs. The quality of positioning becomes
worse. So, it is important to realize robust and accurate
positioning even if the above bad environment. Ideally, it is
important to be able to estimate own position everywhere.
The above robust and accurate positioning leads to high
functional drivers assistant systems, such as supporting every
each of road lanes or automatic drivng [4]–[6]. Moreover,
the application to probe car systems for collection of vari-
ous data, road-to-vehicle / vehicle-to-vehicle communication
will be realized effectively [7]–[9]. In our research, we focus
on the positioning algorithm under such a bad environment
of receiving multipath or NLOS signals.
In GPS positioning, the receiver estimates the own posi-
tion from the propagated distance between the LOS satellites
and the receiver [10]. The distance can be derived from both
a transmitted time at the satellite and a received time at the
receiver. So, the estimated parameters are four parameters,
that is 3 dimension position and time clock error between
the satellite and receiver. The estimator needs four and more
satellites. In urban area, the number of satellites which
can observe in LOS ﬂuctuates. Unfortunately, there are the
places where we cannot observe four satellites frequently.
In this paper, we show the novel positioning method which
can estimate own position with as low number of satellites as
possible. Our estimation uses two LOS satellites. Also, we
assume a moving vehicle. So, we use a travelling distance
as sensor data too. In our method, we can estimate user’s
position even if the number of LOS satellites is reducing.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we
introduce the related works. And, we conﬁrm the problem
of the urban positioning. In Section III, we introduce the
coordinate systems which is required in our positioning algo-
rithm. Then, in Section IV, we introduce the our positioning
algorithm and performance. Finally, Section V summarizes
the paper.
II. RELATED WORKS AND CURRENT PROBLEMS
In this section, we will introduce the related works.
There are a lot of works which can improve the positioning
performance in urban area. After the introduction, the simple
experiment, which we conﬁrm the problem of the urban
positioning, will be shown.
A. Related works
The propagation environment in urban area is multipath
propagation. There are a lot of works which can mitigate
the multipath interference. For example, techniques which
focus on signal tracking on a receiver or channel estima-
tion by multiple correlators have been shown [11], [12].
Moreover, the mitigation methods of Direction-of-Arrival
(DoA) estimation by array antenna have also been shown
[13], [14]. The purpose of these methods is to prevent the
degradation of the positioning performance in case of the
multipath propagation with LOS satellites.

In our research, we focus on the multipath environment
with the NLOS satellites. That is, the direct signal is shielded
by some structures such as buildings. This situation may
often occur in urban area. One of the researches under
assumption of NLOS is [15]. Meguro et al. [15] uses a
camera which watches the sky. The camera decides if there
is the structure or not.
If the receiver exists at static position, observed satellites
are always the same satellites. However, in case of a moving
receiver in urban area, the observed satellites are changed
frequently. The changing the satellites leads to the ﬂuctua-
tion of the positioning accuracy. Irie’s work [16] is to prevent
such a problem of the accuracy degradation. Kawamura and
Tanaka’s work [17] is also to keep the accuracy good by
calculating weightings to the satellites.
When the number of satellites which can be observed
is reduced, the positioning accuracy becomes worse. In the
worst case, the receiver cannot estimate own position at all.
This is because the number of observed satellites is few. In
Fan et al.’s work [18], the receiver adds the virtual satellites
by using the reﬂected signals at the ground.
As other approaches, the estimator can keep the position-
ing accuracy ﬁne by using other information and devices.
Map matching techniques may be most famous. The devises
such as camera, direction, gyro or travelling distance sensors
can improve the positioning performance. The vehicle-to-
vehicle or vehicle-to-road communication can be also used
for improvement. The above researches are shown in [4],
[8], [9], [19].
In Japan, in order to improve the positioning accuracy
in urban area and the environment decreasing the number
of observable LOS satellites, the project of Quasi-Zenith
Satellite System (QZSS) is under way [20]–[22]. In Septem-
ber 2010, the ﬁrst QZSS “MICHIBIKI” was launched. The
satellite of QZSS moves on quasi-zenith orbit of Japan. So,
the receiver can observe QZS at high angle of elevation.
Even if there are a lot of buildings, the QZS can tend to
become the LOS satellite.
B. Checking current probrem and our approach
In urban area, there are a lot of structures such as
buildings. It leads to the bad effect of both reduction of
the observable LOS satellites and generation of multipath
propagation. This bad effect generates large positioning
error. In order to conﬁrm the positioning performance and
its problem, we tested simple experiments of the positioning
in urban area. We used GPS logger (model: m-241, made by
HOLUX), which is popular and we can buy at stores easily.
The frequency of records is 1 Hz. We tried estimation a static
position in 10 minutes. The receiver’s position and estimated
positions are summarized in Figure 1. The positions are
plotted to Google Map by a useful plotting tool “Wadachi
Ver.3.44”.
The location in the experiment is near Hamamatsu Station
in Shizuoka, Japan. There are a lot of buildings. We set the
logger on the edge of the street, that is by the side of the
building wall. From Figure 1, the estimated positions have
about 20-30m error compared to the true position of the
logger. We can conﬁrm that the positioning in urban area
has large errors. The reason may be NLOS or multipath
environment.
The bad satellites, which have NLOS path or multipath
should not be used to estimate the receiver’s position. How-
ever, the estimate algorithm needs four or more satellites.
So, conventionally, in order to get adequate number of the
satellites, the estimator needs to use the bad satellites too.
Figure 1.
Positioning results in urban area (front of building)
Figure 2.
Process ﬂow in positioing
In our approach, we avoid using these bad satellites.
So, we consider another algorithm which can estimate own
position with less than four satellites. In this paper, we
introduce the estimation algorithm which uses two satellites
and the information of the receiver’s movement. We assume
the positioning of a moving vehicle. So, the receiver can get
the information of the travelling distance.
The ﬂow of the usage is illustrated in Figure 2. Usually,
the receiver estimates own positions by conventional algo-
rithm, that is with four and more satellites. In case of bad
environment, we continue the positioning by selecting just
two satellites which have high elevation angle. Our approach
may help in the robust positioning everywhere.
III. COORDINATE SYSTEM (ECEF, ENU COORDINATE)
In this section, before the introduction to our positioning
algorithm, the coordinate systems which are used in the
paper will be shown. The conversion equation will be also
shown. The coordinate systems are both ECEF and ENU.
Both coordinates illustrate as Figure 3. Our algorithm, which
is presented in Section IV, use the assumption “the altitude
of the receiver do not change in short time”. For applying
the assumption, the conversion of the coordinate is needed.
ECEF stands for Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed. The origin
of ECEF is the center of the earth, that is the point Oenu in

Figure 3.
ECEF and ENU coordinate system
Figure 3. ECEF is x − y − z orthogonal coordinates on the
ﬁxed earth. The unit of x, y, z is meter.
ENU means East-North-Up. As pointing out in Figure
3, each of coordinates e, n, u means east-direction, north-
direction, vertical(up)-direction respectively. The origin of
ENU is deﬁned as a arbitrary base position, such as the
position Oenu in Figure 3. The unit of x, y, z is also meter.
Next, we introduce the conversion equation. We deﬁne a
ECEF position (x, y, z) as a vector ⃗xecef, and also deﬁne
a ENU position (e, n, u) as ⃗xenu. The conversion equation
from the ECEF position ⃗xecef to the ENU position ⃗xenu is
the following:
⃗xenu = R(B, L) · [⃗xecef − ⃗x0,ecef]
(1)
where the vector ⃗x0,ecef means the base position which is
expressed in the ECEF coordinate. Generally, the matrix
R(B, L) is called as rotation matrix. In (1), in order to rotate
the coordinate, the matrix R(B, L) is used. So the matrix
is:
R(B, L) =

− sin L
cos L
0
− cos L sin B
− sin L sin B
cos B
− cos L cos B
sin L cos B
sin B

(2)
where the parameter B is the degree of latitude and the
parameter L is the degree of longitude at the base position
⃗x0,ecef (Figure 3). By using (1), we can convert positions
from ECEF to ENU.
In this paper, we apply World Geodetic System 84 (WGS-
84) as a geographical coordinate system. Then, the semi-
major axis Re of the earth and the oblateness fe are:
Re = 6378137.0[m]
(3)
fe =
1.0
298.257223563.
(4)
When we want to convert from ENU to ECEF, the
conversion equation is the following:
⃗xecef = R−1(B, L) · ⃗xenu + ⃗x0,ecef

IV. POSITIONING ALGORITHM USING TWO SATELLITES
In this section, we present the positioning algorithm which
can estimate with the two satellites. Usually, the conven-
tional estimator needs four and more satellites. However,
in urban area, the number of satellites which can observe
in LOS ﬂuctuates. Moreover, the place where we cannot
observe four and more satellites often occurs. In these bad
situations, our positioning method can estimate own position
even if the number of LOS satellites is reducing.
A. System model
Our system model is shown in Figure 4. There are the
two LOS satellites in the sky. Their ECEF coordinates are
(α1, β1, γ1), (α2, β2, γ2)[m] respectively. The position of the
receiver which should be estimated is (x, y, z)[m] and the
position is shown as point A. It is ECEF coordinate. The
parameter t [sec] means time at the receiver. The previous
time is also denoted as the parameter t′ and the relation is
t = t′+Δt. The past receiver’s position A′ is (x′, y′, z′)[m],
that is at the time t′. The travelling distance between the
time t′ and t is d[m]. The time interval Δt is assumed as
short time. So, we assume that the altitude of the receiver
at t and t′ is the same. The distance d can be gotten from
the sensor which measures car speed. The parameter r1[m]
means the range between the satellite #1 and the receiver.
The parameter r2[m] also means the range to the satellite #2.
These ranges r1, r2 are called as pseudorange because the
clock error between the satellites and the receiver is added
to the true range.
B. Algorithm explication
In order to estimate the receiver’s position A, we enumer-
ate the related equations as follows.
r1 =

(α1 − x)2 + (β1 − y)2 + (γ1 − z)2 + s
(7)
r2 =

(α2 − x)2 + (β2 − y)2 + (γ2 − z)2 + s
(8)
d =

(x′ − x)2 + (y′ − y)2 + (z′ − z)2
(9)
Equations (7), (8) are the pseudorange to the satellite #1 and
#2, respectively. The parameter s means the error [m] of
43

the clock difference between the satellites and the receiver.
Equation (9) means the travelling distance of the movement
of the receiver in the time interval Δt.
We must estimate both the receiver’s position (x, y, z)
and the clock error s from (7)ʙ(9). Equations (7)ʙ(9) are
non-linear simultaneous equations. So, we try estimating the
parameters by sequential approach as follows.
[Step 1] We set initial values x0, y0, z0, s0 of the unknown
parameters x, y, z, s.
[Step 2] When the receiver’s position and the clock error are
x0, y0, z0, s0, the pseudoranges and the travelling
distance can be denoted as the following:
r0
1 =

(α1 − x0)2 + (β1 − y0)2 + (γ1 − z)2 + s0
(10)
r0
2 =

(α2 − x0)2 + (β2 − y0)2 + (γ2 − z′)2 + s0
(11)
d0 =

(x′ − x0)2 + (y′ − y0)2 + (z′ − z)2
(12)
[Step 3] The residual errors between the observed value and
the above r0
1, r0
2, d0 are:
Δr0
1 = r1 − r0
1
(13)
Δr0
2 = r2 − r0
2
(14)
Δd0 = d − d0
(15)
Starting from the initial values x0, y0, z0, s0,
we update the estimating unknown parameters
x, y, z, s as the above residual errors become zeros.
[Step 4] In
order
to
derive
the

values
Δx, Δy, Δz, Δs,
we
approximate
(7),

(9) to the followings. That is, the non-linear
simultaneous equations are transformed to linear
simultaneous equations.

(18)
[Step 5] The above simultaneous equations can be repre-
sented as matrix forms as below:
Δ⃗r = GΔ⃗x

Δ⃗r = [Δr1, Δr2, Δd]T

[Step 6] Equation (19) has four unknown parameters. How-
ever, the row of the matrix G is three. So, we
cannot solve the each of the unknown parameters.
Then, we assume that the altitude values of the
receiver A and A′ are the same. In order to use
the assumption, we try converting the coordinate
from ECEF to ENU.
[Step 7] The matrix G is presented as ECEF coordinate
system. We convert the matrix G to ENU coor-
dinate system. The matrix G means the amount
of change in terms of each direction x, y, z. For
example, in the satellite #1, the value ∂r1
∂x means
the change of r1 in terms of the direction x. The
value ∂r1
∂y also means the change of r1 in terms of
the direction y. The value ∂r1
∂z of course means the
change of r1 in terms of the direction z. Then, we
just have to convert each of directions to the east,
north and vertical (altitude), respectively. So, we
represent the matrix G in ENU as follows:

⎠
(26)
The values B, L are the degrees of latitude and
longitude at the position (x, y, z).
[Step 8] Because of the matrix Genu is ENU coordinate, the
vector Δ⃗x have to be ENU coordinate. Then, (19)
have to be converted to ENU coordinate system.

the updating value Δ⃗xenu2.

[Step 11] Based on the updating values in ECEF, we update
the estimating parameters as follows.
x1 = x0 + Δx,
y1 = y0 + Δy,
z1 = z0 + Δz,
s1 = s0 + Δs
(32)
After that, we return back to the step 2 with the
updated values x1, y1, z1, s1 instead of the ini-
tial value x0, y0, z0, s0. We update the estimating
unknown parameters x, y, z, s again and again as
the residual errors Δr1, Δr2, Δd become small
adequately. Finally we get the solution of x, y, z, s.
By the above steps, we can estimate own position with
only two satellites. Our algorithm uses also the travelling
distance. In case of vehicles, we should apply the distance
to the positioning effectively because we can get the distance
easily. As mentioned before, in urban area, the number of
satellites which can observe in LOS ﬂuctuates. Moreover,
the place where we cannot observe four and more satellites
often occurs. Our algorithm can continue the positioning
by selecting just two satellites which have high elevation
angle. Our approach may achieve the robust positioning
everywhere.
C. Performance evaluation
In this section, we show the examples of our estima-
tion performance. The simulation parameters are summa-
rized in Table I. The positions of the two satellites and
the receiver are decided from the real data which was
recorded at the forth order triangulation point (reference
code: TR45235161301, Housono, Kyoto Japan). Especially,
we set the position of the satellites as the decoded position
at 17:50:4.801, December 27, 2012. The simulated satellite
#1, #2 is set as the real GPS satellites whose PRN is #5,
#18, respectively. The distance d is 5 [m].
The pseudorange includes some errors such as troposphere
and ionosphere delay error, clock error, multipath error and
some noise. The experiment was done under the open sky.
So, we can ignore the multipath error. The troposphere and
ionosphere delay error can be modeled and the satellites
sends the modeled delay in their messages. So, we can
subtract the above modeled delay from the pseudoranges.
The remained error is sum of model error and clock error

and some noise. In this simulation, in order to conﬁrm robust
convergence, we assume the remained error as a normal
distribution with standard variation σ. By using the positions
of both the satellites and receiver in Table I, we calculated
the true range. And we prepared the pseudorange r1, r2 by
adding the above remained error to the true range. In the
simulation, the standard variation of the error is set as 3
cases, 1.0m, 5.0m, 10.0m. These values are affected in terms
of the elevation angle to the satellites. We also modeled the
error of the travelling sensor as uniform distribution whose
range is ϵmax = ±1.25[m]. The range is decided as a outer
perimeter of a tire of a personal vehicle.
For comparison, we also estimated the receiver’s position
by using the conventional algorithm with four satellites. We
added more two satellites #3, #4 in Table II to the satellites
#1, #2 in Table I. The PRN of the added satellites #3, #4 is
#24 and #28 respectively.
As performance measure, we evaluate the positioning
error which means the Euclidean distance between the
true position and the estimated position. The trial times is
100,000. The ﬁnal positioning error is deﬁned as the mean
value of each of trials. The results are summarized in Figure
5. The horizontal axis is the pseudorange error and the
vertical axis is the ﬁnal positioning error.
From Figure 5, our algorithm has large positioning error
when the pseudorange error is small. This is because the
error of sensor affects the positioning error as a dominant
factor. On the other hand, our algorithm becomes better
when the pseudorange error is large. This is because the
error of sensor is small compared to the pseudorange error,
can suppress the positioning error. Our algorithm has some
errors, but noteworthy big advantage. We note our algorithm
can estimate the position though the conventional cannot

In this paper, we presented the novel positioning algorithm
in urban area where propagation environment of multipath or
NLOS occurs. Especially, our algorithm can estimate own
positions even if the number of LOS satellites is reduced
because of the structures such as buildings. The conventional
algorithm needs four and more LOS satellites. Our algorithm
can estimate with just two LOS satellites by using the sensor
data of the travelling distance. In the computer simulations,
our algorithm achieved better positioning performance than
that of the conventional in case that the pseudorange errors
of the satellites were large.
