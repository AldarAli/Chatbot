Abstract— A controversial debate has arisen about the effects 
on household electricity prices of electricity generation from 
Renewable Energy Sources and regulatory reforms in the 
European Union Electricity Market. In this paper we propose 
to use panel data models with the aim of explaining the 
household electricity prices as a function of several economic 
variables related to renewable energy sources and electricity 
market regulation. More specifically we use a panel data set 
provided by Eurostat and covering 27 European Union 
countries during the period 1998–2009. Our results suggest 
that electricity prices increase with the deployment of 
Electricity from Renewable Energy Sources.  
 
Keywords-renewable energy, electricity market, panel data

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
There is a controversial debate about the effects of the 
promotion of renewable energy and electric power sector 
reforms on electricity prices. 
 
The European Union has emphasized the need to control 
climate change and then it has assumed a binding unilateral 
greenhouse gas emission reduction target for 2020, 
according to which the EU is committed to reducing 
emissions to at least 20% below 1990 levels. In order to 
achieve this target the European Union is working on the 
development 
of 
renewable 
energy 
industries, 
the 
implementation of energy efficiency measures and saving 
energy technologies. 
More specifically, the Community Directive 2009/28/EC 
[1] on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable 
sources has agreed European targets for 2020: European 
Union should achieve by 2020 a 20% share of Renewable 
Energy Sources (RES) in the Community’s gross final 
consumption of energy and a 10% share of energy from 
renewable sources in transport energy consumption.  
 
The EU sustainable development strategy [2] recognises 
that environmental investments as well as technological 
innovation 
are 
the 
prerequisites 
for 
long-term 
competitiveness and better environmental protection. 
Therefore, the development of renewable energy 
industries and energy-saving technologies provides several 
positive effects, mainly with reference to the expected 
increase in energy self-sufficiency, employment, investment 
and production1, but it also has some costs related to the 
adjustments in production, prices and transportation systems   
 
Regarding the effects on prices, the majority of 
renewable 
energy 
technologies 
increase 
electricity 
generation costs with regard to conventional generation so 
they are expected to increase the electricity price paid by 
final consumers. In fact, there are three principal components 
of extra costs: the generation costs, the costs of distribution 
and transmission system reinforcements and, in the case of 
the intermittent renewals, the extra balancing costs.  
In the European Union the largest part of the investments 
for electricity production was devoted to new wind power 
stations and Photovoltaic and Solar thermal systems as we 
can see in Table I. 
The generation of Electricity from Renewable Energy 
Sources (RES-E) especially from wind and photovoltaic 
power, can increase generation costs when compared with 
conventional generation. A number of recent studies have 
sought to quantify the costs associated with large-scale 
renewable generation by wind ([6], [7] and [8] among 
others). 
 
Moreover, the majority of renewable energy technologies 
are not profitable at current energy prices so their 
development is mainly driven by different public renewable 
support schemes: feed in tariffs, quota obligations, green-
certificate trading, fiscal measures as tax benefits, investment 
grants, etc. Some important classification criteria are whether 
policy instruments address to price or quantity, and whether 
they support investment or generation. A classification of the 
existing promotion strategies for renewals is provided in [9].  
 
 
                                                           
1 Several studies have reviewed the effects of the introduction of renewable 
energies at EU country level. This is the case of [3] for the United 
Kingdom or [4] for Germany. Other studies as [5] have analysed the 
macroeconomic RES impact at local level.

Most RES-E support systems are financed via the 
electricity market, which increases the retail electricity price. 
Therefore promotion systems have costs for the final 
consumers. For example, [10] shows that Quota-based 
Tradable Guarantee-of-Origin Certificates systems as well as 
Feed-in tariff systems create an artificial market and cause 
policy costs (¼ additional costs to be usually paid by 
electricity customers).  
In Table II we summarise the main promotion 
mechanism implemented in specific EU countries. Quota-
based systems are now in place in the UK, Sweden, Italy, 
Belgium, and Poland. Moreover, as each country has 
different targets set in Directive 2009/28/EC [12], the 
dimension of policy support can be different thus following 
in different effects on electricity prices.  
 
In addition, environmental costs related to CO2 emissions 
in electricity generation usually have a significant negative 
effect on energy costs as a CO2 emission trading scheme 
(ETS) exists. The substitution of conventional electricity 
generation by renewable energies could reduce the cost 
derived from environmental emissions and the electricity 
price. Support systems for Electricity from Renewable 
Energy Sources (RES-E) can reduce electricity prices that 
have also been influenced by a CO2 Emission Trading 
Scheme (ETS): Additional RES-E substitute electricity from 
fossil fuels, and thus CO2-emissions are reduced. The 
demand for emission reductions is lowered; as a result the 
CO2 price is also reduced and consequently the wholesale 
price for electricity decreases [13].

It is also necessary to consider that a higher use of 
renewable energies could reduce even the electricity final 
prices because its promotion stimulates the generation of 
renewable energy which is characterized by variable costs 
lower than fossil conventional technologies [14].  
 
Regarding the legislative aspects, the regulatory reforms 
in the EU Electricity Market could also have effects on 
electricity prices. In fact the liberalization of generating and 
retailing activities could increase competition thus reducing 
electricity prices. 
 
Following the EU Directives 96/92/EC [15] and 
2003/54/EC [16] the electricity markets in Europe were fully 
liberalized the 1st of July 2007. Since then all electricity users 
are able to choose their own suppliers, and electricity 
network service providers are separated from generating 
and/or supply companies. 
This liberalization of the European electricity markets 
aims to increase efficiency by competition, thus decreasing 
electricity prices for final consumers. 
 
However, as [17] points out, market liberalization does 
not necessarily imply effective competition and competitive 
prices. Achieving competitive prices depends on the number

of enterprises and the nature of consumer to switch. The 
combination of low elasticity to prices and a small number of 
competitors means that market prices can easily deviate from 
competitive levels.  
 
Regarding 
the 
production 
market 
structure, 
the 
liberalization in many of the EU countries in the generation 
sector has not provided a less concentrated market structure.  
In Figure 1 we can see that the market share of the largest 
generator in the electricity market has not a significant 
decrease for the majority of the EU countries from 1999 to 
2008. This lack of competition may allow electricity prices 
on the wholesale markets to increase, thus leading to higher 
retail electricity prices, especially for household consumers. 
 
Therefore, there are several economic variables related to 
renewable energy sources and electricity market regulation 
affecting the electricity prices. During the last years several 
studies have been developed in order to explain the effect of 
several variables on electricity prices using cross-sectional, 
temporal or panel data. Some of them include explanatory 
variables related to energy use or technology [18] and [19] or 
liberalization market [20] [21]. In this paper we propose an 
empirical study including all the potential effects together 
and therefore we propose panel data models with the aim of 
explaining the household electricity prices as a function of 
variables related to renewable energy sources and electricity 
market regulation. The main objective of our empirical work 
is to explain some differential aspects of the European Union 
member countries in the electricity prices.

II. 
MODELLING THE IMPACT OF RENEWABLES ON 
ELECTRICITY PRICES. PANEL DATA MODELS  
The European Union is working in the development of 
renewable energy industries, the implementation of energy 
efficiency measures and saving energy technologies. Within 
this framework countries pledge to make substantial efforts 
in their energy policy. However, each country tries to 
effectively implement renewable energies according to its 
own characteristics such as energy consumption, energy 
diversity or composition of electricity generation.  
 
Moreover, the RES-E policy support and dimension of 
each EU member can vary, leading to different effects in 
electricity prices. With regard to the market liberalization 
each country has particularities in its market structure, size 
(number of enterprises) and consumer demand.  
All these differences lead to a wide range of household 
electricity prices in the EU countries as we can see in Figure 
2.  
 
In this section we propose panel data models with the 
aim of explaining the household electricity prices as a 
function of several economic variables related to renewable 
energy sources and electricity market regulation. More 
specifically we use a panel data set provided by Eurostat and 
covering 27 countries of the EU during the time period 
1998–2009.  
 
The basic country-level time series data for the period 
1998–2009 were taken from Eurostat (available at the web 
site http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu).

The considered dependent variable is Electricity prices 
for 
household 
consumers. 
This 
indicator 
measures 
electricity prices charged to final consumers, which are 
defined as follows: Average national price in Euro per kwh 
without taxes applicable for the first semester of each year 
for medium size household consumers (Consumption Band 
Dc with annual consumption between 2500 and 5000 kwh). 
Until 2007 the prices are referring to the status on the 1st of 
January for medium size consumers. 
 We propose the following explanatory variables related 
to renewable energy sources and electricity market 
regulation: 
• Electricity generated from renewable sources - % of gross 
electricity consumption (RES-E). This indicator is 
computed as the ratio between the electricity produced 
from renewable energy sources and the gross national 
electricity consumption for a given year. Electricity 
produced from renewable energy sources comprises the 
electricity generation from hydro plants (excluding 
pumping), wind, solar, geothermal and electricity from 
biomass/wastes. We expect a positive estimated effect of 
this variable on electricity prices as the generation of 
Electricity from Renewable Energy Sources (RES-E) 
increases generation costs and their development is 
mainly driven by different public renewable support 
schemes.    
• Percentage of Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 
Energy industries as a total of Greenhouse gas emissions 
(Energy Industries Emissions). We expect a positive 
estimated effect of this variable on prices as emission 
trading schemes exist. 
• Market share of the largest generator in the electricity 
market- Percentage of the total generation (Electricity 
Generation Competition-ECG). This indicator shows the 
market share of the largest electricity generator in each 
country. To compute this variable, the total net electricity 
production during each reference year is considered, 
meaning that the electricity used by generators for their 
own consumption is not taken into account. Then, the net 
production of each generator during the same year is 
considered in order to calculate the corresponding market 
shares, and only the largest market share is reported under 
this indicator. As a result a positive effect of this variable 
on electricity prices is expected, since market share 
increases also increment the market power thus leading to 
higher electricity prices. 
• Gross Domestic Product, GDP per capita, measured in 
Purchasing Power Standards PPS- (GDPpps). This 
variable aims to study the effect of the general economic 
activity on electricity prices. Besides the convenience of 
considering the general economic context, the inclusion 
of this indicator is particularly interesting in some 
European Countries (as in Spain) where part of the 
electricity price is paid by the government through state 
budgets. 
 
In the described situation the use of panel data techniques 
could be advisable if significant country effects exist, 
allowing us to determine if there are differences at country-
level among the European Union member states.   
We specify the following panel regression model:

where i=1,…,27, t=1998,…,2009.  
Parameters 
i
α  denote country effects and they are 
included in the model with the aim of capturing the specific 
effects related to the different EU countries, since the 
omission of these terms might lead to biased estimates. The 
disturbances of this model are denoted by uit and are 
assumed to be independently and identically distributed 
random variables with mean zero and variance
2
u
σ . 
In order to identify the most suitable specification, the 
proposed model has been estimated considering both fixed 
and random effects2 . According to the fixed effects model 
i
α  is considered as a regression parameter while the 
random effects model treats it as a component of the random 
disturbance. In order to establish whether the fixed or the 
random effects estimator is more appropriate a Hausman 
test is performed [26]. 
If the effects 
i
α are correlated with the explanatory 
variables, then the random effects model cannot be 
consistently estimated, and the Hausman test can be used to 
test for inconsistency in the random effects estimation by 
comparing the fixed-effects and random-effects estimated 
coefficients (a significant difference indicates that the 
random effects model is estimated inconsistently). In other 
words, the null hypothesis of the Hausman test is that 
individual country effects are uncorrelated with the other 
explanatory variables and thus the random-effects model is 
the most appropriate estimator. 
 The obtained value for the Hausman test statistic is 
39.81 and the related p-value (approximately 0) leads to a 
rejection of the null hypothesis of strict exogeneity. 
Therefore, we conclude that the fixed effects model is better 
than the random effects option.  
Further, the existence of country specific effects has been 
checked though the F test (whose null hypothesis is the 
existence of equal αi for all the countries). If the individual 
country effect 
i
α  is assumed to be equal across all countries, 
then the pooled Ordinary Least Square are consistent and 
efficient.   
The obtained results are summarized in Table III 
confirming the existence of country-specific effects (The F 
test statistic leads to the rejection of the null hypothesis at the 
1% level). As a result, different αi are assumed in order to 
control for unobserved heterogeneity of EU-27 members as 
significant differences between countries in electricity prices 
exist.

The fixed effects estimated model has a good explanatory 
power (the overall goodness of fit is 80%). 
 
The panel regression results indicate that, according to 
the t-test, the overall considered variables are statistically 
significant at 5% level. The variable Electricity generated 
from RES has a positive estimated coefficient, showing that 
a 1% increasing in RES-E, holding constant all other 
explanatory variables, causes an increases of 0.00167 Euro 
per kwh in the household electricity prices.  
Moreover, Energy Industries Emissions and GDPpps 
have also estimated positive effects on electricity prices. 
More specifically, by increasing 1% the Green Gas 
Emissions produced by Energy Industries the electricity 
price would increase in 0.00181 Euros per kwh (holding 
constant all other variables). The positive estimated effect of 
the GDP per capita on electricity prices could indicate that 
the RES-E promotion expenditures in countries with higher 
income are usually supported by increasing electricity prices 
paid at the end by the consumers (in stead of state budgets).  
Lastly, the variable related to the liberalization of 
electricity generation (Electricity Generation Competition) 
has a negative impact on household electricity prices. This 
result does not fulfil our initial expectations as it is generally 
expected that liberalization of generating activities increase 
competition thus reducing electricity prices. 
 In fact, when market share of the largest generator in the 
electricity market decreases 1% (holding constant all other 
variables) the household electricity prices are expected to 
increase in 0,00056 Euro per kwh, Therefore, Electricity 
market liberalization does not necessarily imply effective 
competition and competitive prices. Achieving competitive 
prices depends on the number of players, the nature of 
electricity supply and the nature of consumer demand.  
Since the largest part of the EU electricity generation by 
RES is devoted to wind power and hydro, we estimate the 
model including the explanatory variables Electricity 
generated from wind power and Electricity generated from 
hydroelectricity, obtaining the results summarized in Table 
IV. In this new model, the Hausman test for the null of 
random effects versus fixed effects leads to a chi-squared 
statistic with a value of 10,56 and therefore random 
components can not to be rejected at 5% of significance.

explanatory variables.  
Regarding Electricity generated

estimated coefficient suggests that an 1% increasing in this 
variable (holding constant all other variables) leads to an 
increase of 0.0025 euros per kwh in household electricity 
prices.  
III. 
MAIN FINDINGS AND CONCLUDING REMARKS 
The liberalization of electricity markets in Europe aims 
to increase competition, thus decreasing electricity prices for 
the final consumers. However, the promotion of European 
electricity generation from renewable energy (RES-E) could 
have an opposite effect on electricity prices. 
In the framework of a controversial debate about the 
effects of RES-E on household electricity prices, this paper 
explores the impact of several economic variables on 
household electricity prices in the European Union. 
With this aim, panel data models are estimated trying to 
explain the household electricity prices as a function of 
several economic variables related to renewable energy 
sources and electricity market regulation: Electricity 
generated from renewable sources, Greenhouse gas 
emissions produced by Energy industries and Market share 
of the largest generator in the electricity market. The panel 
data set is provided by Eurostat covering 27 EU countries 
during the period 1998–2009 and the obtained results 
indicate that electricity prices increase with the deployment 
of RES-E and also with the increased emissions of energy 
industries.  
Regarding the liberalization of electricity generation, 
our findings suggest that when the market share of the 
largest generator in the electricity market decreases 1% the 
household electricity prices increases in 0,00056 euro per 
kwh. Therefore, the liberalization of Electricity markets 
does not necessarily imply effective competition and 
competitive prices.
