Abstract—In this work, we provide new experimental results 
on temperature dependence of hysteresis loops and the Giant 
MagnetoImpedance (GMI) effect of amorphous Fe75B9Si12C4 
microwires.  We observed a remarkable improvement of GMI 
ratio and modification of hysteresis loops from rectangular to 
inclined upon heating. The observed experimental results are 
discussed considering relaxation of internal stresses upon 
heating, Hopkinson effect and modification of the thermal 
expansion coefficients upon heating.

 INTRODUCTION  
 
Amorphous 
magnetic 
materials 
are 
commonly 
considered among the most promising magnetic materials 
because of their excellent magnetic and mechanical 
properties [1]-[5]. Such amorphous materials can be 
prepared with planar (ribbons) or cylindrical (wires) shapes. 
Magnetic wires can have unique magnetic properties, 
such 
as 
magnetic 
bistability 
[6]-[8] 
and/or 
giant 
magnetoimpedance, GMI, effect [9]-[11], which are suitable 
for development of several technological applications [12]-
[15]. Therefore, research on amorphous magnetic wires has 
attracted substantial attention since the 70-s [6]-[15].  
Recently, substantial attention has been paid to 
development 
of 
amorphous 
materials 
with 
new 
functionalities, such as reduced dimensions, enhanced 
corrosion resistance or biocompatibility [11][13]. Therefore, 
great attention has been paid to development of alternative 
fabrication methods allowing preparation of biocompatible 
amorphous materials with reduced dimensionality [11][13]. 
Accordingly, studies of glass-coated microwires with 
reduced diameters (between 0.5 and 100 µm), covered with 
thin, insulating, biocompatible and flexible glass-coating 
prepared by the Taylor-Ulitovsky method have attracted 
great attention [11] [13].  Such microwires are covered with 
thin, insulating, biocompatible and flexible glass-coating 
allowing better corrosion resistance and biocompatibility. 
Additionally, such microwire can present excellent magnetic 
softness or magnetic bistability [11] [13]. Such features of 
glass-coated microwires allow development of new exciting 
applications in various magnetic sensors, as well as in smart 
composites with tunable magnetic permittivity [6][11][13]-
[21]. One more advantage of glass-coated microwires is 
their excellent mechanical properties [4] [5]. 
One of the most promising applications of glass-coated 
microwires is the external stimuli (temperature, stress, 
magnetic field) monitoring [22]-[25]. As was previously 
demonstrated [22], the dispersion of the effective 
permittivity, εef, of the composites with magnetic wire 
inclusions depends on the metallic wires geometry, as well 
as on the magnetic wires impedance. The utilization of 
ferromagnetic wires allows tuning of this dispersion through 
changing the wire magnetic structure by external stimuli 
(magnetic field, stress or temperature) [22]-[25]. 
For 
such 
applications, 
studies 
of 
temperature 
dependence of the GMI effect are essentially relevant. 
However, there are only very few studies on temperature 
dependence of GMI and most studies were performed in 
different amorphous materials (ribbons or thick magnetic 
wires without glass-coating) [26]-[29]. 
In this paper, we provide our recent experimental results 
on temperature dependence of the GMI effect and hysteresis 
loops for Fe-rich (Fe75B9Si12C4) microwires.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the 
experimental 
methods, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
microwires 
characteristics analyzed in this paper are provided. Section 3 
presents the experimental results dealing with temperature 
dependence of hysteresis loops and GMI effect. Finally, we 
conclude the paper in Section 4.

EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM DETAILS 
Amorphous 
Fe75B9Si12C4 
glass-coated 
microwires 
(metallic nucleus diameter, d= 15.2 µm, total     diameter, D= 
17.2 µm) with positive magnetostriction coefficient, λs, (λs ≈ 
38x10-6), have been prepared using the Taylor-Ulitovsky 
method, previously described elsewhere [16] [18].  
The hysteresis loops have been measured using 
MicroSense EV9 Vibration Sample Magnetometer (VSM), as 
well as using fluxmetric methods.  The latter was previously 
successfully employed for characterization of magnetically 
soft microwires at room temperature [30], while utilization of 
VSM magnetometry allowed to measure the hysteresis loops 
of 5 mm long samples from room temperature up to 300 oC, 
as described elsewhere [31]. The hysteresis loops were 
represented as the dependence of normalized magnetization, 
M/M0 (where M is the magnetic moment at a given magnetic 
field and M0 is the magnetic moment of the sample at the 
maximum magnetic field amplitude measured at room 
temperature) versus magnetic field, H. 
Specially designed experimental set-up allows to measure 
sample impedance and evaluate ΔZ/Z-ratio in the temperature, 
T, range from room up to T= 300 oC at frequencies, f, up to 
110 MHz [32].  
We used the GMI ratio, ΔZ/Z, determined as:   
 
                ΔZ/Z = [Z (H) - Z (Hmax)] / Z (Hmax),                (1) 
 
where Z is impedance of the wire, H and Hmax are the applied 
and maximum DC magnetic fields. 
 
III. 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
As shown in Figure 1, a rectangular hysteresis loop is 
observed 
for 
as-prepared 
Fe75B9Si12C4 
glass-coated 
microwire, as expected for Fe-rich microwire with positive 
λs [18].  
A remarkable change in hysteresis loop is observed upon 
heating: the hysteresis loops of studied sample becomes 
essentially non-rectangular (see Figure 2a). The substantial 
effect of heating can be better appreciated from Figure 2b, 
where the change in the low field hysteresis loop upon 
heating is shown. Rectangular hysteresis loop transforms 
into inclined upon heating (see Figure 2b).  
The observed changes in hysteresis loops upon heating 
are almost completely reversible: as shown in Figure 3, the 
hysteresis loop measured after heating up to 300 oC and 
cooling back to room temperature becomes again 
rectangular. 
The aforementioned GMI effect is successfully explained 
in terms of skin effect of magnetically soft conductors. The 
origin of the GMI effect is related to the effect of a magnetic 
field, H, on the penetration depth, δ, of an electrical current 
flowing through the magnetically soft conductor [9]-[11].

where  is the electrical conductivity and f the frequency 
of the current along the sample. 
Accordingly, high ΔZ/Z-ratio values are usually observed 
in magnetic wires with high  - values, typically observed 
in amorphous wires with low transversal magnetic 
anisotropy [9]-[11][23]. 
As reported elsewhere [11], for magnetic wires with 
rectangular hysteresis loops, the ΔZ/Z-ratio values are 
usually rather low. However, the observed influence of 
heating on the shape of the hysteresis loops suggests a 
modification of the GMI effect. Figure 4 shows the results 
of the temperature dependence of the GMI effect of studied 
microwire. Indeed, evidenced from Figure 4, a remarkable 
increase in ΔZ/Z-ratio is observed for the studied sample 
upon heating (see Figure 4). Temperature dependencies of 
maximum GMI ratio, ΔZ/Zmax, for 50 and 100 MHz are 
summarized in Figure 4c.  
The origin of the rectangular hysteresis loop of Fe-rich 
microwires is commonly attributed to the peculiar domain 
structure of as-prepared Fe-rich microwires consisting of 
axially magnetized inner single domain and outer domain 
shell with radial magnetization [6] [7] [33]. Axial magnetic 
anisotropy of as-prepared Fe-rich microwires (λs >0) is 
commonly explained considering preferentially axial 
character of the internal stresses arising during the 
fabrication process consisting of simultaneous rapid 
solidification of metallic nucleus surrounded by glass-
coating with rather different thermal expansion coefficients 
[18] [34] [35]. The main origin of such stresses is the 
difference in thermal expansion coefficients of the glass-
coating and the metallic nucleus. Accordingly, the heating 
effect on hysteresis loops shape must be attributed to a 
decrease in internal stresses upon heating. 
The transformation of the hysteresis loops from 
rectangular to inclined must be the main reason of 
remarkable GMI effect improvement. 
Upon samples heating, several processes are expected: 
the reduction of internal stresses originated by the rapid 
solidification of a composite microwire with a different 
thermal expansion coefficient of the metal nucleus and glass 
coating and relaxation of internal stresses (as in any 
amorphous materials). Additionally, the origin of the 
substantial GMI effect improvement at T= 300 oC can be 
related to the Hopkinson effect. The Hopkinson effect is 
manifested as a sharp magnetic permeability maximum at

temperatures slightly below the Curie temperature, Tc, 
[36][37]. The origin of such effect is commonly associated 
with a faster decrease of magnetic anisotropy constant with 
temperature as compared to the magnetization.  
A comparison of the hysteresis loops measured at 
different T (see Figure 5a) shows that, indeed, higher 
magnetic permeability is observed at T= 300 oC, as 
compared to the hysteresis loops measured at T= 200 oC and 
250 oC (see Figure 5 a). 
The evolution of average magnetic anisotropy field, Hk, 
upon heating is provided in Figure 5b. Such Hk –values 
were evaluated from the hysteresis loops, as previously 
described [38].  
In order to separate the effect of heating from the effect 
of the internal stresses relaxation, the comparison of the 
ΔZ/Z(H) dependencies measured at room temperature before 
and after heating up to 300 oC is provided in Figure 6. 
A comparison of the ΔZ/Z(H) dependences (see Figure 6 
a,b) clearly shows some ΔZ/Zmax improvement after heating 
to 300 oC. This increase in ΔZ/Zmax must be related to the 
relaxation of internal stresses. However, the main 
contribution to the increase in ΔZ/Zmax is related to the 
heating itself. 
The observed experimentally results on substantial 
temperature dependence of the GMI effect and magnetic 
properties of Fe-rich microwires can be useful for 
temperature monitoring. However, the effect of heating 
must be separated from the internal stresses relaxation upon 
heating.  
 
                                                    IV. CONCLUSIONS 
 
The temperature dependence of the magnetic properties 
and the GMI effect of amorphous FeSiBC microwires have 
been thoroughly analyzed using both hysteresis loops and 
GMI measurements. A substantial change in hysteresis 
loops shape and GMI effect upon heating is observed. We 
observed a remarkable improvement of the GMI ratio and 
modification of hysteresis loops from rectangular to inclined 
upon heating of FeSiBC microwire. The observed 
experimental results are discussed considering relaxation of 
internal stresses upon heating, Hopkinson effect and 
modification of the thermal expansion coefficients upon 
heating. 
 
The observed significant effect of temperature on the 
hysteresis loop shape and the GMI effect of FeSiBC                 
microwires coated by insulating, flexible and biocompatible 
glass-coating opens up the possibility of using such Fe-rich 
microwires for temperature sensors and for temperature 
monitoring in composites with magnetic microwire 
inclusions.
