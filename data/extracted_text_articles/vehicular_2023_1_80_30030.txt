Abstract—To fully use the benefits of a hybrid energy storage 
system in an Electric Vehicle (EV), it requires an effective 
energy management system to control the energy flow. 
Knowledge of how energy consumption is generated in EVs is, 
therefore, important for the development of such a system. Since 
one of the biggest energy consumptions in modern EVs are 
generated by the auxiliary consumers, an auxiliary model needs 
to consider all relevant auxiliary consumers, including the 
heating/air-conditioning system and other switched, dynamic, 
comfort and continuous consumers. The vehicle interior is, 
therefore, modeled using a 1-zone air model and the auxiliary 
consumers (such as heating/air conditioning, power steering and 
others) are adjusted based on environmental conditions. The 
electric power steering’s energy demand is calculated 
dynamically during the journey. The energy consumption of the 
heating system matches literature data with deviation less than 
8%, while the consumption of other auxiliary consumers 
matches measured values with deviation of 2.8%. The focus is 
on the energy consumption of auxiliary consumers in EVs, 
which are a significant factor in the energy flows of the vehicle. 
The model accounts for factors, such as weather and driving 
behavior, that affect the use of auxiliary consumers and the 
resulting energy consumption.

 INTRODUCTION 
The utilization of Hybrid Energy Storage Systems (HESS) 
in electric vehicles has been the subject of growing interest in 
recent years, as it offers a unique combination of the benefits 
of both lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors. The 
integration of these two energy storage technologies results in 
a system that boasts both high energy density and high-power 
density. The effective management of energy flow between 
these two storage technologies requires the implementation of 
an intelligent Energy Management System (EMS) [12]. For 
the development and testing of such systems, it is necessary to 
model the energy flows in the vehicle as realistically as 
possible. Based on these models, the EMS can make a 
prediction of the expected range and suggest and/or take 
appropriate corrective steps if any action is required [12]. 
Alongside the powertrain, the auxiliary consumers are the 
second-largest energy consumers in an electric vehicle. 
Heating and air conditioning of the interior in particular 
consume a lot of energy [11]. Since electric vehicles have to 
operate with a limited energy capacity or comparatively long 
charging times, an accurate representation of the energy flows 
and the respective energy consumption is significant for 
model-based development approaches of management 
systems like the EMS presented in [12]. The use of auxiliary 
consumers in a vehicle depends on many different influencing 
factors. For example, the vehicle’s lights depend on the 
weather, the time of day, the season, and the route. The use of 
the radio and the heating/air conditioning system is in return 
dependent on the driver. So, the presented model has to 
simulate the usage of the auxiliary consumers and the 
resulting energy consumption realistically, while at the same 
time taking external influences such as weather and route 
conditions into account. 
 
Section 2 presents an investigation about the state of the 
art and gives an overview about modelling of auxiliary 
consumers in EVs. In Section 3, the individual models 
(vehicle cabin, Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning 
(HVAC) system, and other auxiliary consumers) are 
presented. Section 4 presents the individual validations of the 
used model in this project. Afterwards, Section 4 discusses 
and concludes the results of this work. 
II. 
STATE OF THE ART 
The paper of Basler [1], Baumgart [2], Konz et. al. [10], 
Kruppok [11] and Suchaneck [16] are studied to compare with 
the modeling approach of this investigation. The research 
focuses on modeling the HVAC system, as it is the main 
auxiliary consumer of an electric vehicle. Modelling the other 
auxiliary consumers via a constant power is sufficient since 
the transient behavior is not the focus, only their energy 
consumption. However, the additional consumers must be 
modeled dynamically based on ambient and route conditions 
for a realistic estimation of energy flows. Route-specific data 
is required and can be obtained from suitable sources or 
entered manually. 
This work's focus is on energy flow calculations and does 
not aim to calculate additional range reductions of an electric 
vehicle or model comfort behavior. Instead, it aims to 
realistically calculate energy consumption through a realistic 
integration of route and environmental parameters into the 
auxiliary consumer model.

III. 
MODEL ENVIRONMENT 
The model is generated in C-Code which is integrated into 
the simulation tool CarMaker. On one side through the 
interface, it is possible to set options and starting conditions 
for the model. On the other side, it is possible to return the 
calculated energy flows to the CarMaker environment for 
further processing [9]. While the transient behavior of the 
HVAC 
system 
determines 
the 
energy 
consumption 
significantly, the transient behavior of the other consumer 
(e.g., lightning, wipers) is not relevant for an accurate energy 
flow calculation. That’s why the model is split into the blocks 
of HVAC and other consumers. The other consumers can be 
modelled as consumers with constant power demand when 
turned on. 
A. Heat Flow Balance of the vehicle cabin 
The vehicle’s exterior surfaces are in heat exchange with 
the environment. Solar radiation passes directly through the 
glazed surfaces of the vehicle into the passenger compartment 
(𝑄̇𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠) and the exterior surfaces of the body heat up. At low 
ambient temperatures, the heated body parts release their heat 
(𝑄̇𝑏𝑜𝑑𝑦 ). A heat flow is supplied by the HVAC module 
(𝑄̇𝐻𝑉 𝐴𝐶). Since the principle of mass conservation applies 
within the vehicle interior, the air mass flow supplied by the 
air-conditioning system must be able to escape again from the 
vehicle, as otherwise there would be an increase in pressure in 
the cabin, which is not the case (for real vehicles). The 
calculation of the dissipated heat flows 𝑄̇𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 and the outgoing 
mass flow is shown in [7]. If the passenger compartment is 
considered as a holistic system, the following heat flow 
balance results: 
 
𝑄̇𝐻𝑉 𝐴𝐶 + 𝑄̇𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 + 𝑄̇𝑏𝑜𝑑𝑦 + 𝑄̇𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠 = 0 
(1) 
 
The heat flow from the HVAC system 𝑄̇𝐻𝑉 𝐴𝐶  can be 
calculated with the air mass flow 𝑚̇ 𝑎𝑖𝑟 , the specific heat 
capacity 𝑐𝑝,𝑎𝑖𝑟 and the temperature difference ΔT. 
 
𝑄̇𝐻𝑉 𝐴𝐶 = 𝑚̇ 𝑎𝑖𝑟 ∗ 𝑐𝑝,𝑎𝑖𝑟 ∗ ΔT 
(2) 
 
The other heat fluxes, like convection, radiation and heat 
conduction, are calculated as described in [19]. 
B. Influence of Solar Radiation 
The solar radiation entering the vehicle interior through 
the glazing heats up the interior of the vehicle, which 
additional heats up the air inside the vehicle cabin. As 
described in [14] it is possible to determine the sun’s position 
through the day depending on the rotation around the north 
axis. The angle between the sun and the north axis is called 
azimuth (𝛼𝑠𝑢𝑛). To calculate which masses and which exterior 
surfaces of the vehicle cabin are heated up by the sun, it is 
necessary to calculate the relative angle between the sun and 
the vehicle. Figure 1 shows the relative rotation between the 
sun and the vehicle. The angle between the vehicle and the sun 
Δα is the difference between 
 
Δα = α𝑣𝑒ℎ𝑖𝑐𝑙𝑒 − 𝛼𝑠𝑢𝑛 
(3) 
 
 
Figure 1.  Relative rotation between a vehicle and the sun. 
From Δα can be derived which surface and which window 
is heated up by direct solar radiation. If Δα is equal to zero or 
180° the sun is directly in front or back of the vehicle and these 
are the only surfaces which are shined. If Δα is not equal to 
zero more than one reference surface is irradiated and 
depending on the value of Δα the shined surfaces are 
calculated in a look-up-table. The sun position is calculated as 
described in [14] and the solar intensity depending on date and 
time can be provided for different regions worldwide. For this 
paper, we will use Karlsruhe in Germany as an example, data 
provided by [4].  
C. Model of the vehicle cabin 
The vehicle interior is modelled as an air volume with a 
homogeneous air density and temperature distribution. The 
interior temperature depends on the incoming heat fluxes from 
the interior walls of the vehicle cabins and the incoming solar 
radiation. Furthermore, the interior temperature is increased, 
reduced or kept constant by the heating/air-conditioning 
system. The design of the vehicle interior model is based on 
the model by [11] but is adapted with regard to the model’s 
own requirements.

surfaces, masses and heat exchange mechanisms.

The external surfaces of the vehicle are in heat exchange via 
radiation (red arrows) and forced convection (yellow arrows). 
There are three glass surfaces in the vehicle cabin: Front 
window, side windows and back window. Through the glass 
surfaces, solar radiation is emitted into the vehicle cabin 
(black arrows). All incoming and outgoing heat flows are 
balanced via the cabin air volume. The temperature of the 
cabin air volume can be calculated with [1][11].

Using (4), it is possible to calculate the surface 
temperatures of the vehicle cabin. For the calculation of the 
heat exchange coefficient, the vehicle cabin is simplified as a 
cylinder [2] and calculation of the coefficient is done with the 
methods from [19]. The solar radiation hitting the inclined 
surfaces 𝐸𝑑𝑖𝑟,𝑡𝑜𝑟 can be calculated with the help of the direct 
horizontal solar radiation 𝐸𝑑𝑖𝑟,ℎ𝑜𝑟 from the data from [4], the 
torsion angle of the surface θ and the solar elevation γ𝑠𝑢𝑛 [14]: 
 
𝐸𝑑𝑖𝑟,𝑡𝑜𝑟 = 𝐸𝑑𝑖𝑟,ℎ𝑜𝑟 ∗
θ
γsun
 
(5) 
For a detailed calculation of θ see [14]. The diffuse solar 
radiation 𝐸𝑑𝑖𝑓 𝑓,𝑡𝑜𝑟  can be estimated with an isotropic 
approach using the horizontal diffuse radiation from the data 
𝐸𝑑𝑖𝑓 𝑓,ℎ𝑜𝑟 and the rotation angle of the surface γ𝑠𝑢𝑟 𝑓 . 
 
𝐸𝑑𝑖𝑓 𝑓,𝑡𝑜𝑟 = 𝐸𝑑𝑖𝑓 𝑓,ℎ𝑜𝑟 ∗ 0.5 ∗ (1 + 𝑐𝑜𝑠 γ𝑠𝑢𝑟 𝑓) 
(6) 
 
The calculation of a projected surface, as in [7], is 
dispensed with in favor of the model complexity. The fraction 
of radiation which enters the vehicle cabin through the glazed 
surfaces is determined by the transmission coefficient τ. The 
radiation entering the cabin is calculated as a product of the 
sum of the diffuse and direct radiation times τ and the surface 
area A. 
 
𝑄𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ = (𝐸𝑑𝑖𝑓 𝑓,𝑡𝑜𝑟 + 𝐸𝑑𝑖𝑟,𝑡𝑜𝑟) ∗ τ ∗ 𝐴 
(7) 
 
 
It is assumed that the passengers are sitting and remain 
calm which results in heat flow from the passengers of 58
𝑤
𝑚2 
[15]. Depending on the height and weight of the passenger the 
surface area of the passenger can be calculated with the 
Mosteller equation, which can be found in [18]. 
D. Controlling of the HVAC-System 
The HVAC system can be operated in three different 
operational modes. In the preset mode, it is possible to set the 
desired cabin temperature and the inlet mass flow. The 
maximum mass flow of the HVAC system is in this case 
9
𝑘𝑔
𝑚𝑖𝑛. The Min/Max - Mode aims to heat/cool down the 
vehicle cabin as fast as possible. If the temperature difference 
between the set temperature and the actual temperature is 
smaller than 3 K, the HVAC power is reduced. The automatic 
mode is modelled using the comfort perception of an average 
passenger. The comfort perception is described in [3] and can 
be modelled with the equations of [2]. The comfort perception 
is depending on the environment temperature, see Figure 3. 
Independent from the operation mode, the inlet air 
temperature is controlled by a PI - Controller. A Proportional–
Integral–Derivative (PID)-controller has no significant 
advantage compared to a Proportional–Integral (PI)-controller 
because of the big thermal internal of the vehicle cabin [11]. 
A PI-controller is also used in the model of [13] to control the 
Air Conditioning (AC)-compressor. The power demand of the 
air conditioning is calculated using the Coefficient of Power 
(COP). The data comes from a comparable air conditioning 
system [10]. Using (8), the electric power demand P𝑒𝑙 can be 
calculated. 
 
𝐶𝑂𝑃 = 𝑄̇𝐻𝑉 𝐴𝐶
P𝑒𝑙
 
(8) 
 
The electric power demand when heating is calculated via 
a characteristic map using the output of the controller as input. 
The electric power demand is calculated as the output variable 
of the characteristic map. The characteristic map is 
constructed heuristically with data from [11] where the same 
HVAC system is modelled.

vehicle interior as a function of the ambient temperature. Calculated with 
the equatiosn from [2]. 
E. Modelling the other auxiliary consumers 
Auxiliary consumers are divided into four categories: 
continuous (e.g., electronic control unit), comfort (e.g., radio 
and window heating), dynamic (electrical power steering), 
and switched consumers (can be switched by driver). Kruppok 
has published measured power values of the auxiliary 
consumers, which are used in this model, since the same 
electric vehicle is modelled [11].  
The low beam in this model is switched on and off 
automatically. A distinction is made between summer and 
winter. In winter, the low beam is switched on automatically 
between 5 p.m. and 9 a.m. In summer mode, the period is 
shortened to the time between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. From 
visibility of less than 150 m, the low beam is also switched on.

VEHICULAR 2023 : The Twelfth International Conference on Advances in Vehicular Systems, Technologies and Applications

If the low beam is switched off, the daytime running lights are 
switched on as required by the Road Traffic Act [17]. The 
indicators are turned on when the internal CarMaker variable 
Vehicle on Junction is set and the steering angle is greater than 
114.6°. The brake lights are turned on when the internal 
CarMaker Variable Brake is set. The wipers are used 
depending on the rain rate set before the simulation in 
CarMaker. The operation level is set automatically in the 
model. The Electric Power Steering (EPS) is modelled 
differently. Due to the highly dynamic power demand, the 
actual EPS power is calculated by a characteristic map.  
IV. 
VALIDATION 
The validation of the model includes, on the one hand, the 
validation of the heating/climate system and the associated 
thermal processes in the vehicle interior, and secondly the 
power requirements of the auxiliary consumers. Measurement 
data from the literature are used for validation. There are 
measurement studies of the temperature behavior of the 
vehicle cabin, which can be found in [6] and [11].  
A. Validation of the Vehicle Cabin Model 
The An essential component of the overall model with 
considerable influence on the temperature development in the 
interior is the vehicle cabin model. For the validation of the 
vehicle cabin model, the heating behavior of the interior is 
observed without air conditioning, without solar radiation and 
without wind. The measurement data used is taken from the 
work of Kruppok [11]. The test vehicle is pre-tempered to 
275.5 K for a sufficiently long time, so that it can be assumed 
that each component has the same temperature. Subsequently, 
the vehicle is transferred to an environment with an ambient 
temperature of 291 K and the heating behavior of the interior 
is measured. The temperature is measured at different places 
inside the vehicle cabin and is averaged for validation. The 
vehicle is stationary and there is no irradiation from the sun. 
The same is also simulated in the model. To describe how well 
the model reproduces the experimental data, the coefficient of 
determination R2 is shown in (9). A detailed derivation of the 
coefficient of determination can be found in [5]. 
 
𝑅2 = 1 −
∑
(𝑦𝑖 − 𝑦̂𝑖)2
𝑛
𝑖=1
∑
(𝑦𝑖 − 𝑦𝑖̅)2
𝑛
𝑖=1
 
 
(9) 
The coefficient of determination lies between 0 ≤ 𝑅2 ≤
1 . A value of zero indicates that there is no correlation 
between the measured values and the model, whereas a value 
of 1 can only be achieved if the measured values also describe 
the model at the same time.  For the validation of the vehicle 
cabin model, the coefficient of determination between the 
heating curve of the model and the measured values is 
calculated. Optimal is a value close to one. By adjusting the 
heat transfer coefficients of the vehicle cabin model, a 
coefficient of determination of approx. 91.1% is achieved. 
Figure 4 shows that the heating of the interior is faster in the 
model than in the measurement, but the same final 
temperature is reached in both cases. For the determination of 
the energy demand of the air conditioner without taking 
comfort aspects, the interior model is considered to be 
sufficiently accurate. 
 
 
Figure 4.  Heating of interior without air condit. with pre-heated interior. 
B. Validation of the HVAC 
Investigations by Kruppok have shown that the required 
inflow temperature of the air flowing into the vehicle, cabin is 
not achieved immediately after the heating/air-conditioning 
system is switched on [11]. Due to the thermal inertia of the 
system, it takes approx. 1000s (about 17min) until a stationary 
final temperature is reached. The behavior of the inflow 
temperature can be approximated by a transfer element with a 
second-order delay (PT2 element). The result is a well-fitting 
temperature curve in the model compared to the measurement 
data, see Figure 5.  
 
 
Figure 5.  Heating of the interior without air conditioning with pre-heated 
interior. 
It is assumed that the same behavior occurs in the heating 
mode because the HVAC is operated as a heat pump when in 
heating mode. So, the same components are in operation. By 
validating the heating behavior of the vehicle cabin model, the 
entire HVAC system, but especially the controller setting can 
be validated. As a reference, a measurement in which the 
interior temperature is recorded with active heating. This is 
the same as the average temperature, determined in the model. 
The test vehicle is pre-conditioned to 266.2 K and the target 
temperature of the interior is 297.2 K. The measurement data 
44

VEHICULAR 2023 : The Twelfth International Conference on Advances in Vehicular Systems, Technologies and Applications

is published in [6]. In the preset mode, the temperature 
behaves like the real-world measurement. The heating system 
is operated with the maximum mass flow of 9
𝑘𝑔
𝑚𝑖𝑛.  
A similar mass flow is also used for the measurement, due 
to the low ambient temperature and the preconditioning of the 
vehicle. In the real vehicle, there is a clear overshoot of the 
interior temperature. This is avoided in the model by 
controller setting. The target temperature is reached at the 
same time after approx. 800s. The steady-state final 
temperature of the simulation is a few tenths of a Kelvin 
higher than the setpoint temperature, but this deviation 
reduces in the further course of the simulation. In min/max 
mode, the setpoint temperature is reached much earlier, as 
desired. A stationary final state is already reached after 
approx. 400s. This is achieved by a maximum temperature of 
the incoming air and a maximum air mass flow. The validation 
of the heating-up behavior shows that the model can be used 
to simulate the real vehicle interior very well. Through the 
different operating modes, it is possible to simulate different 
scenarios. 
C. Validation of The Energy Consumption 
In his work, Gutenkunst carried out five test drives of 
Bruchsal - Karlsruhe - Bruchsal and measured the distance 
travelled and the energy consumption [8]. Those measured 
data is used as a reference for the results of the simulation. In 
the simulation environment, the model has calculated with the 
air conditioning switched off, in good visibility, without rain 
and during the day. During the simulation, the local speed 
limits along the route are adhered to exactly. Table I shows 
the results of the measurement runs and the simulation.  
TABLE I.  
COMPARISON ENERGY CONSUMPTION. MEASUREMENT 
DATA ARE TAKEN FROM [8]. 
 
 
The normalized energy consumption in the simulation is 
approx. 5% higher than the average consumption of the 
measurement runs. This is due to the following reasons: The 
route length in the simulation already deviates 1.94% from the 
average real route length. The reason for this is the inaccuracy 
of GPS data, with which the route was created in CarMaker. 
Since the normalized consumption results from the total 
energy demand and the route, there are deviations. The pure 
energy demand is also higher in the simulation despite the 
shorter route. The reason for this is the unknown use of the 
auxiliary consumers and a possible velocity deviation during 
the measurement. Since the deviation in the simulation to the 
measurement is less than 3%, it can be assumed that the 
general calculation of the energy consumption is sufficiently 
accurate. The data from measurements two to four are done 
with normal traffic. Since the traffic is not modelled in the 
simulation the comparison between measurements two to four 
and the simulation are expected to be better. The comparison 
shows a deviation of only 0.33% for the comparison of total 
energy consumption. The normalized consumption is now 
only 1.4% higher than in the measurement. 
D. Validation 
The energy consumption of the HVAC system in the 
heating case is validated with the data from [11]. Since a 
similar HVAC model for the same reference, the vehicle is 
described in [11], the comparison is legitimate. The power 
demand in the heating case in the model of the present work 
is determined via a characteristic map. The map is developed 
heuristically. The input variable of the characteristic map is 
the output of the controller, which describes the extent to 
which the temperature of the incoming air must be increased 
by the heating system. The output variable is the electrical 
power in Watts. The energy consumption calculation is 
carried out in the time frame of the WLTP cycle. Figure 6 
shows the result of the validation with different ambient and 
target temperatures in the vehicle cabin. 
 
 
Figure 6.  Validation of the energy consumption in the heating case at 
different ambient temperatures in the WLTP cycle. Comparison data are 
taken from [11]. 
 The percentage values above the bars describe the relative 
deviation between the simulation and the data from [11]. The 
approximation of the power demand of the heating system via 
a map provides sufficiently accurate matches to the data from 
the literature. The relative deviation is in all cases smaller than 
7.25%. At low ambient temperatures, however, the energy 
consumption in the simulation is higher than in [11]. One 
possible reason for this is deviating heat transfer coefficients, 
which lead to increased heat loss from the vehicle cabin at low 
ambient temperatures. The heat transfer coefficients in [11] 
are not fully known.  
V. 
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
The validation shows a good result if the model is 
compared with data from the literature. The deviation is 
relatively small and is, therefore, acceptable for the objective

of this work. The model construction of the HVAC system is 
based on similar models, which can be found in literature, e.g., 
[1],[11] or [16]. The aim was to build a simpler model with at 
least nearly good simulation results as other, more complex 
models. This is achieved but only validated for the heating 
case. In addition, the calculation of the power demand of the 
heating system with a characteristic map is not very accurate 
although it works well in this case. A detailed measurement of 
real currents would bring more accurate information into the 
model. But overall, the investigation has shown, that the 
model results are quite accurate for the cases investigated. 
With more detailed data from the reference vehicle, especially 
for cooling cases and the explicit use of different auxiliary 
consumers the model can be updated to a more detailed model 
with a highly accurate energy consumption calculation. 
The auxiliary consumer model makes it possible to 
determine the energy consumption of all the auxiliary relevant 
in an electric vehicle. The model shows good agreement with 
measured data which can be found in the literature, despite its 
simplifications and assumptions and with considerably less 
modelling effort. The deviation of the energy consumption of 
the heating system to values from the literature is less than 8% 
and the consumption of the other auxiliary consumers deviates 
only 0.33% from the measured values. At the same time, the 
structure of the model makes it possible to link the model to 
the simulation tool CarMaker. Via the interface between the 
model and CarMaker, it is possible to connect other models, 
such as an EMS, to the auxiliary consumer model. This work 
has shown that even a less detailed model can produce 
similarly accurate results about the energy consumption of the 
auxiliary consumers than detailed models.
