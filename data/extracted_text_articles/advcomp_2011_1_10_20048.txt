Abstract—Knowledge of optical properties could shed more
light on initial ultrafast phases of bacterial photosynthesis. Soft-
ware package Mathematica is used for computer simulation of
absorption spectra and steady state ﬂuorescence spectra of ring
molecular system, which can model cyclic antenna unit LH2 of
the bacterial photosystem from purple bacterium Rhodopseu-
domonas acidophila. Three different models of uncorrelated
static disorder are included in our simulations: Gaussian dis-
order in local excitation energies, Gaussian disorder in nearest
neighbour transfer integrals and Gaussian disorder in radial
positions of molecules in the ring. Dynamic disorder, interaction
with a bath, is also included in Markovian approximation. The
cumulant-expansion method of Mukamel et al. is used for the
calculation of spectral responses of the system with exciton-
phonon coupling. Calculated ﬂuorescence spectra are compared
with measured one. Values of the interpigment interaction
energy and unperturbed transition energy from the ground
state for above mentioned static disorder types are given.
Keywords-LH2 ring; exciton; ﬂuorescence spectrum; static
disorder; dynamic disorder; Mathematica.
I. INTRODUCTION
Ultrafast initial phases of photosynthesis in purple bacteria
have been thoroughly studied over the last years. The bacte-
rial light-harvesting complexes contain pigments circularly
arranged in a protein scaffold. The crystal structure of
peripheral light-harvesting complex LH2 from Rhodopseu-
domonas acidophila has been determined with high reso-
lution [1], [2]. LH2 is a highly symmetric ring of nine
pigment-protein subunits, each containing two transmem-
brane polypeptide helixes and three bacteriochlorophylls
(BChl).
In what follows, we are dealing with ring-shaped unit with
nonameric symmetry resembling LH2 ring from Rhodopseu-
domonas acidophila with a strong interaction J between
BChl molecules. Therefore, in our theoretical approach, an
extended Frenkel exciton states model is considered. In spite
of extensive investigation, the role of the protein moiety in
governing the dynamics of the excited states has not been to-
tally clear yet. At room temperature, the solvent and protein
environment ﬂuctuate with characteristic time scales ranging
from femtoseconds to nanoseconds. The simplest approach
is to substitute fast ﬂuctuations by dynamic disorder and
slow ﬂuctuations by static disorder.
In several steps, we have extended the former inves-
tigations of static disorder effect on the anisotropy of
ﬂuorescence made by Kumble and Hochstrasser [3] and
Nagarajan et al. [4]–[6] for LH2 rings. After studying the
inﬂuence of dynamic disorder for simple systems (dimer,
trimer) [7]–[9] we added the dynamic disorder effect to our
model of LH2 ring by using a quantum master equation
in Markovian [10] and non-Markovian limits [11]. We also
studied inﬂuence of four types of uncorrelated static disorder
[12], [13] (Gaussian disorder in local excitation energies,
transfer integrals, radial positions of BChls and angular
positions of BChls on the ring) and inﬂuence of correlated
static disorder (elliptical deformation) [11]. Models of rings
with different arrangement of optical dipole moments (radial
arrangement) were also investigated [14]–[16].
Recently, we have focused on the modeling of the
steady state ﬂuorescence spectra for molecular rings with
18 molecules and tangentially arranged optical transition
dipole moments [17]. Main goal of the present paper is
the investigation of absorption and steady state ﬂuorescence
spectra for different types of uncorrelated static disorder.
The results for above mentioned three types of uncorrelated
static disorder are compared with experimental ﬂuorescence
proﬁle [18]. The dynamic disorder - interaction with the
phonon bath in Markovian approximation for low and room
temperature is taken into account simultaneously.
The remainder of this article is organized as follows.
In Section II, we give the model of LH2 ring and re-
view the theory we have used. In Section III, we mention
computational point of view and used software. In Section

ﬂuorescence spectra simulations, and in Section V, we draw
some conclusions.
II. PHYSICAL MODEL
The Hamiltonian of an exciton in the ideal ring coupled
to a bath of harmonic oscillators reads
H0 = H0
ex + Hph + Hex−ph.

Here
H0
ex =

(2)
corresponds to an exciton, e.g., the system without any
disorder. The operator a†
m (am) creates (annihilates) an
exciton at site m, Jmn(for m ̸= n) is the so-called transfer
integral between sites m and n.
The second term in (1),
Hph =

phonon creation and annihilation operators are denoted by

describes exciton-phonon interaction, which is assumed to
be site-diagonal and linear in the bath coordinates (the term
Gm
q denotes the exciton-phonon coupling constant).
Inside one ring, the pure exciton Hamiltonian can be
diagonalized using the wave vector representation with cor-
responding delocalized ”Bloch” states α and energies Eα.
Considering homogeneous case with only nearest neighbour
transfer matrix elements
Jmn = J0(δm,n+1 + δm,n−1)
(5)
and using Fourier transformed excitonic operators (Bloch
representation)
aα =

the simplest exciton Hamiltonian in α - representation reads

The matrix of the spectral densities Cαβγδ(ω) in the
eigenstate (exciton) representation reﬂects one-exciton states
coupling to the manifold of nuclear modes. In what follows
only diagonal exciton phonon interaction in site represen-
tation is used (see (4)), i.e., only ﬂuctuations of pigment
site energies are assumed and the restriction to completely
uncorrelated dynamic disorder is applied. In such case each
site (i.e., each chromophore) has its own bath completely
uncoupled from the baths of the other sites. Furthermore it
is assumed that these baths have identical properties [12],
[22], [23]

III. COMPUTATIONAL POINT OF VIEW
In the present paper, we are dealing with simulations of
absorption spectra and steady state ﬂuorescence spectra for
molecular ring, which can model B850 ring from bacterial
LH2 complex. Fluorescence FL(ω) and absorption OD(ω)
spectra have to be simulated for large number of different
static disorder realizations. Each realization of static disorder
is created by random number generator. Then, so as to have
single ring ﬂuorescence spectrum FL(ω) and absorption
spectrum OD(ω), it is necessary to put through numerical
integrations (see (8), (9)) for each realization of static
disorder and ﬁnally average these results over all realizations
of static disorder. For all calculation, the software package
Mathematica [26] was used. This package is very convenient
not only for symbolic calculations [27], that are needed
for expression of all required quantities, but it can be used
also for numerical ones [28]. That is why Mathematica was

used by us as for symbolic calculations as for numerical
integrations and also for ﬁnal averaging of results over all
realizations of static disorder.
IV. RESULTS
Three above mentioned types of uncorrelated static dis-
order have been taken into account in our simulations
simultaneously with dynamic disorder in Markovian approx-
imation. Dimensionless energies normalized to the transfer
integral J12 = J0 have been used. Estimation of J0 varies
in literature between 250 cm−1 and 400 cm−1. Contrary
to Novoderezhkin et al. [18], different model of spectral
density (the model of K¨uhn and May [12]) has been used.
In agreement with our previous results [29] we have used
j0 = 0.4 J0 and ωc = 0.212 J0 (see (15)). The strengths
of individual types of uncorrelated static disorder have
been taken in agreement with [30]. For each type of static
disorder, the simulations have been done for three values of
the static disorder strength:
(I) ﬂuctuations in local excitation energies δεn:
∆ = 0.1, 0.3, 0.6 J0,
(II) ﬂuctuations in transfer integrals δJmn:
∆J = 0.05, 0.15, 0.30 J0,
(III) ﬂuctuations in radial positions of molecules on the ring
δrn:
∆r = 0.02, 0.06, 0.12 r0, where r0 is the radius of
unperturbed ring.
Resulting steady state ﬂuorescence spectra FL(ω) and ab-
sorption spectra OD(ω) averaged over 2000 realizations of
each static disorder type and strength can be seen in Fig. 1
for low temperature (kT = 0.1 J0, Fig. 1(a)) and for room
one (kT = 0.5 J0, Fig. 1(b)).
Comparison of calculated ﬂuorescence spectra with ex-
perimental ﬂuorescence proﬁle averaged in time and over
the particles at room temperature [18] is also displayed in
Fig. 1(b). Simulated ﬂuorescence spectra ﬁtting has been
done for middle values of static disorder strength. From
this ﬁtting we can determine values of the interpigment
interaction energy J0 and unperturbed transition energy from
the ground state ∆E0 for which the experimental data are
best reproduced (the values are given in Section V).
Peak position of single ring ﬂuorescence spectrum de-
pend on the realization of static disorder and also on the
temperature. To investigate this effect we calculate peak
position distributions of simulated ﬂuorescence spectra for
all three above mentioned types of static disorder and for low
(kT = 0.1 J0) and room (kT = 0.5 J0) temperature. For
each static disorder type we consider three different static
disorder strengths (see above). Calculated peak position
distributions are shown in Fig. 2.
V. CONCLUSION
Software package Mathematica has been found by us very
useful for the simulations of molecular ring spectra. For each
above mentioned type of static disorder the experimental
ﬂuorescence proﬁle averaged in time and over the particles
at room temperature [18] is best reproduced with:
(I) local excitation energy ﬂuctuations δεn (for the stan-
dard deviation ∆ = 0.3 J0):
the interpigment interaction energy J0 = 370 cm−1
and unperturbed transition energy from the ground state
∆E0 = 12280 cm−1,
(II) transfer integral ﬂuctuations δJmn (for the standard
deviation ∆J = 0.15 J0):
J0 = 400 cm−1 and ∆E0 = 12350 cm−1,
(III) ﬂuctuations of radial positions of molecules on the ring
δrn (∆r = 0.06 r0):
J0 = 400 cm−1 and ∆E0 = 12300 cm−1.
The ﬂuorescence spectra shift to higher wavelengths (to
lower energies) for increasing static disorder (it can be seen
from Fig. 1). This shift is the smallest in case of static
disorder in radial positions of molecules (III).
In Fig. 1 the shift of ﬂuorescence spectra peak position to
the higher wavelength in comparison with absorption spectra
peak position is also visible. This shift is highest (8 nm) for
the static disorder type (III).
If the temperature is changed from kT = 0.5 J0 to 0.1 J0,
the peak position distributions of single ring ﬂuorescence
spectra do not alter very much (Fig. 2). At low temperature
we can see enlargement of the distribution to the higher
wavelengths for all types of static disorder (mainly for small
strength of static disorder). At room temperature, this effect
is covered by larger widening of single ring spectra caused
by dynamic disorder.
