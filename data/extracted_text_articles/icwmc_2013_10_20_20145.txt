Abstract— In this paper, a Bit Error Rate (BER) analysis is
presented for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) schemes
in the 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) system. Analytical
expressions for the average BER of the system are derived over
ﬂat Rayleigh fading channels for two different MIMO schemes
as deﬁned in LTE, assuming M-ary quadrature amplitude modu-
lation (M-QAM) schemes and are evaluated numerically. Monte-
Carlo simulation results of the LTE system are also provided to
verify the accuracy of the mathematical analysis. It is shown that
the results obtained from Monte-Carlo simulations match closely
with those obtained from the derived mathematical formulas.

ulation.
I. INTRODUCTION
To increase the capacity and speed of wireless commu-
nication systems, a new wireless data networks has been
emerged and has been standardized by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP). This new standard is a natural
evolution to the existing second (2G) and third (3G) generation
wireless networks in order to respond to the growing demand
in terms of data rates and speed and marketed as 4G Long
Term Evolution (LTE). In LTE, data throughput and the speed
of wireless data are increased by using a combination of
new methods and technologies like Orthogonal Frequency
Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and Multiple-Input Multiple-
Output (MIMO) techniques.
In the downlink, the LTE transmission is based on Orthog-
onal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), known
as a technique of encoding digital data on multiple carrier
frequencies. It was shown that OFDMA is an efﬁcient tech-
nique to improve the spectral efﬁciency of wireless systems.
By converting the wide-band frequency selective channel into
a set of several ﬂat fading subchannels, OFDM technique be-
comes more resistant to frequency selective fading than single
carrier systems. As OFDM signals are in time and frequency
domain, they allow adding frequency domain scheduling to
time domain scheduling. In LTE, for a given transmission
power, the system data throughput and the coverage area
can be optimized by employing Adaptive Modulation and
Coding (AMC) techniques. The role of the user scheduler at
the transmitter side is to assign the data rate for each user
according to the channel conditions from the serving cell, the
interference level from other cells, and the noise level at the
receiver side.
In LTE standard, the use of MIMO has been considered
as an essential technique in order to achieve the target in
terms of data throughput and reliability. MIMO is known
to be a very powerful technique to improve the system
performance of wireless communication systems. The diversity
and multiplexing modes are the two main modes of operation
of multiple antennas systems. The principle of diversity mode
is based on transmitting the same signal over multiple antennas
and hence to improve the reliability of the system by the
diversity gain. In this mode, the mapping function of transmit
symbols used at the transmit antennas is called Space Time
Block Code (STBC). On the other hand, multiplexing mode
uses two or more different spatial streams and send them
through two different antennas, consequently, the data rate can
be improved.
To study the performance of LTE systems a MATLAB based
downlink physical layer simulator for Link Level Simulation
(LLS) has been developed in [1] [2]. A System Level Sim-
ulation of the Simulator is also available [3]. The goal of
developing the LTE simulator was to facilitate comparison
with the work of different research groups and it is publicly
available for free under academic non-commercial use license
[2]. The main features of the simulator are adaptive coding
and modulation, MIMO transmission and scheduling. As the
simulator includes many physical layer features, it can be
used for different applications in research [3]. In [4], the
simulator was used to study the channel estimation of OFDM
systems and the performance evaluation of a fast fading
channel estimator was presented. In [5] and [6], a method for
calculating the Precoding Matrix Indicator (PMI), the Rank
Indicator (RI), and the Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) were
studied and analyzed with the simulator.
In this paper, the Bit Error Rate (BER) analysis of two
transmit diversity schemes known as Space Frequency Block
Codes (SFBC) and Frequency Switched Transmit Diversity
(FSTD) MIMO schemes in LTE system for M-QAM modula-
tion scheme are presented in terms of SNR using the moment
generating function of the SNR. The results obtained from

the analysis are then compared to the results of Monte-Carlo
simulation using the Link Level LTE simulator [1] [2].
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, we present the system and channel model used
in the simulation. In Section III, we present a performance
analysis for the average BER of SFBC and FSTD MIMO
schemes. The numerical and simulation results and discussions
are presented in Section IV. Finally, Section V concludes the
paper.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
In this section, the structure of the OFDM LTE signal is
described. The OFDM signal has a time and a frequency
domains. In the time domain, the LTE signal is composed of
successive frames. Each frame has a duration of Tframe = 10
msec. Each frame is divided into 10 subframes with equal
length of 1 msec. Each subframe consists of two equal
length time-slots with a time duration of Tslot = 0.5 msec.
For a normal cyclic preﬁx length, each time-slot consists of
Ns = 7 OFDM symbols. In the frequency domain, the OFDM
technique converts the LTE wideband signal into several nar-
rowband signals. Each narrowband signal is transmitted on one
subcarrier frequency. In LTE, the spacing between subcarriers
is ﬁxed to 15 KHz. Twelves adjacent subcarriers, occupying
a total of 180 KHz, of one slot forms the so-called Resource
Block (RB). The number of Resource Blocks in an LTE slot
depends on the allowed system bandwidth. The minimum
number of RB is equal to 6 corresponding to 1.4 MHz
system bandwidth. For 20 MHz system bandwidth (Maximum
Allowed bandwith in LTE) the number of RB is equal to
100. In a MIMO system with MR receive antennas and MT
transmit antennas, the relation between the received and the
transmitted signals on subcarrier frequency k (k ∈ 1, ...K), at
sampling instant time n (n ∈ 1, ...N) is given by
yk,n = Hk,nxk,n + nk,n
(1)
where yk,n ∈ CMR×1 is the received vector, Hk,n ∈ CMR×MT
represents the channel matrix on subcarrier k at instant time
n, xk,n ∈ CMR×1 is the transmit symbol vector and nk,n ∼
CN(0, σ2
n.I) is a white, complex valued Gaussian noise vector
with variance σ2
n. Assuming perfect channel estimation, the
channel matrix and noise variance are considered to be known
at the receiver. A linear equalizer ﬁlter given by a matrix
Fk,n ∈ CMR×MR is applied on the received symbol vector
yk,n to determine the post-equalization symbol vector rk,n as
follows [6]
rk,n = Fk,nyk,n = Fk,nHk,nxk,n + Fk,nnk,n.
(2)
The Zero Forcing (ZF) or Minimum Mean Square Error
(MMSE) design criterion [7] are typically used for the linear
receiver and the input signal vector is normalized to unit
power. In MIMO-OFDM systems, the key factor of link error
prediction and performances is the signal to noise ratio (SNR)
which represents the measurement for the channel quality
information. In this study, the SNR is deﬁned as follows [1]:
γk,n = ∥Hk,nxk,n∥2
F
NT σ2n
(3)
where xk,n is the transmitted symbol vector, ∥.∥2
F is the
squared Frobenius norm of a matrix.
III. AVERAGE BER PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
In the following, we present a BER performance analysis for
the 2×1 MIMO SFBC and 2×2 MIMO SFBC systems, over
slow fading channels. Using the Moment Generating Function
(MGF)-based approach we obtain closed-form expressions for
the average BER performance of the system. We then present
numerical evaluation results obtained from the closed-form
expressions. Finally, we present Monte-carlo simulations to
verify the accuracy of our analysis.
A. BER Analysis of SFBC
In LTE, the transmit diversity techniques are deﬁned only
for 2 and 4 transmit antennas and one data stream. When two
eNodeB antennas are available for transmit diversity operation,
the Space Frequency Block Code (SFBC) is used [8]. SFBC
is based on the well known Space Time Block Codes (STBC),
also known as Alamouti codes for two transmit antennas [9].
STBC is employed with the UMTS and it operates on pairs
of adjacent symbols in the time domain. Since the signal in
LTE is two dimensional (time and frequency domains) and
the number of available OFDM symbols in a subframe is not
always an even number, the direct application of STBC is not
straightforward. In LTE, for SFBC transmission, the symbols
are transmitted from two eNodeB antenna ports on each pair
of adjacent subcarriers as follows [8]:

y(1)(1)
y(1)(2)

(4)
where y(p)(k) denotes the symbols transmitted on the kth
subcarrier from antenna port p. An important characteristic
of such codes is that the transmitted signal streams are
orthogonal and a simple linear receiver is required for optimal
performances.
Since OFDM converts the multipath channel into N fre-
quency ﬂat fading channel, we ﬁrst derive the BER expressions
over ﬂat Rayleigh fading channels, given by Pb (E). Then, the
overall average BER over N subcarriers, in each case can be
calculated from
BER = 1

where the index k (subcarrier index) is ignored for the sake
of brevity. In addition, the impact of cyclic preﬁx in OFDM
is assumed to be negligible.

For the 2 × 1 SFBC MIMO scheme, the probability density
function of the SNR for each subcarrier is given by a chi-
square distribution function as follows [10]:

where ¯γ is the average SNR per symbol given by ¯γ = Es/N0.

using the following equation:

IV. SIMULATION AND ANALYTICAL RESULTS
In this section, we provide the results obtained from the
mathematical expressions derived in this paper. Monte-Carlo
simulation results are also provided to show the accuracy of
the analysis. The common simulation settings for Monte-Carlo
simulations are summarized in Table I.
The average BER performance as a function of γ = Es/N0
for SISO and MIMO schemes are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig.2.
Fig. 1 shows the results for 16-QAM modulation and Fig.2
presents the results for 64-QAM modulation. It can be seen
that the average BER performances of 16-QAM and 64-QAM
schemes at high SNRs decrease by factors γ1, γ2, and γ4, for
SISO, 2 × 1, and 4 × 2 cases, respectively. Thus, the diversity
order (slope of the curves) are equal to 1, 2 and 4, respectively,
for the considered cases. As stated earlier, since in 4×2 FSTD,
at each time-slot/frequency-slot 2 out of 4 transmit antennas
are in use, therefore the diversity order will be 2 × 2 = 4. In
fact, the corresponding average BER curve for 4 × 2 FSTD
is somehow like the classical 2 × 2 STBC system, when the
channel is not a time-varying channel.
From the ﬁgures it is clear that the BER performance im-
proves as the number of transmit or receive antennas increases,
as expected. It can be observed that the negative slope of
the BER curve for the SISO case is equal to 1, meaning
that the diversity order for the SISO case is equal to 1, as
expected. The second curves in Fig.1 and Fig.2 represent the
BER results of the 2×1 diversity scheme. Asymptotically, the
slope of these curves can be observed to be equal to 2, which
corresponds to the diversity order of 2 × 1 system. An SNR
(Es/N0) gain improvement can also be observed compared
to the SISO scheme. From Fig.1, it can be observed that to
achieve the BER value of 10−3, the 2 × 1 diversity scheme
needs about 10 dB less in Es/N0, compared to the SISO case.

In Fig.2 for 64-QAM modulation, the BER of 10−3 is
achieved at Es/N0 = 39 dB in SISO conﬁguration, however
the same value of BER is achieved with only at Es/N0 = 29
dB in the 2 × 1 diversity scheme. Thus a SNR gain of 10
dB is clearly observed for the 2 × 1 diversity scheme. The
BER results of the 4×2 diversity scheme for both modulation
schemes 16-QAM and 64-QAM are also shown. As described
earlier, in high SNR region the slope of that curve tends to be
equal to 4. This value corresponds to the diversity order of a
2 × 2 system.
Finally, it can be observed from Fig.1 and Fig.2 that
numerical evaluation results obtained from BER formulas
match closely to the BER results obtained from Monte-Carlo
simulations. This veriﬁes the accuracy of the mathematical
analysis.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have presented an average BER perfor-
mance analysis for MIMO schemes in the 3GPP Long Term
Evolution (LTE) system over a ﬂat Rayleigh fading channel.
The theoretical analysis for two different MIMO schemes in
a 5 MHz bandwidth LTE system were presented. To verify
the accuracy of the analysis the results of Monte-Carlo sim-
ulation for the studied schemes were provided and compared
with the theoretical analysis. To show the BER performance
improvement in the MIMO schemes, the performance of a
SISO conﬁguration was also presented. The results show a
good agreement between numerical results and Monte-Carlo
simulation results.
