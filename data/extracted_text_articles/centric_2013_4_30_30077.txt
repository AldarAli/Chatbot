Abstract â€“ Cochlear implants are used by deaf people to recover 
partial hearing. The electrode array inserted inside the cochlea is an 
extensive area of research. The aim of the electrodes array is to 
directly stimulate the nerve fibers inside the Organ of Corti. The 
electrical model of the physical system consisting of  Organ of Corti 
and the electrodes is presented in this paper. This model allowed to 
run Spice simulations in order to theoretically detect the minimal 
voltage sufficient for nerve fiber stimulation as well as the impact of 
the electrode voltage on the duration of  nerve fibers stimulation. 
Besides, the perturbations introduced by one electrode on the 
neighboring electrodes were theoretically studied. Finally, the study 
of power consumption was performed, which is of great importance 
in such embedded system.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Cochlear implants are an electrical device used by severely 
deaf people to gain or recover partial audition. They allow direct 
stimulation of  the auditory fibers using an electrodes array 
designed to reproduce the stimulus that would be generated by a 
healthy cochlea.  
To do so, an external part of the hearing devices is located 
outside the ear and contains a microphone that captures the 
acoustic waves and transforms them into an electrical signal used 
by the data processing unit. Then, this signal is transmitted to the 
receiver, located within the patientâ€™s head, close the skull. The 
receiver is composed of a demodulator and a set of electrodes 
driven by electrical signals that will contract the cochlea and 
stimulate the auditory nerve [1] [2]. 
Cochlear implants directly stimulate the nerve fibers inside 
the cochlea, and requires surgery to pull the electrodes array 
inside the scala tympani (Figure 1). 
The connection between the electrodes in the scala tympani 
and the auditory nerve fibers is critical for efficient nerve fibers 
stimulation.  
In an healthy ear, when a sound wave is produced, it strikes 
the eardrum and this vibration is reported in the oval window 
using ossicles. The oval window is the very first part of the 
cochlea. This oval window vibration creates a wave propagating 
inside the scala vestibuli, which is filled with perilymph. 
Figure 1. Cochlear implant device [2] 
 
According to biophysical theories [3] [4] when a mechanical 
wave propagates inside the cochlea, the Basilar Membrane (BM) 
distorts to absorb the wave energy, resulting in a height variation 
of the BM which compresses the organ of Corti. As shown in 
Figure 2, the organ of Corti is composed of Hair Cells (HC) 
(Outer Hair Cells (OHC) and Inner Hair Cells (IHC)), which 
have stereocilia at their end. When BM vibrates, stereocilia 
position change allowing potassium channels to open [5] [6]. 
Opening of the potassium channels creates the depolarization of 
the HC allowing complex mechanisms to take place (reviewed in 
[7] [8] [9]), and finally, resulting in neurotransmitter released in 
the synapse. Once released, these neurotransmitters travel to the 
post synaptic cell (the nerve fiber) and creates the depolarization 
of the nerve fiber. This depolarization, if sufficiently important, 
generates an Action Potential (AP) running through the nerve cell 
membrane [10] [11].

Figure 2. Organ of Corti 
 
The aim of the electrodes array of the cochlear implant is to 
generate an AP once a sound is perceived. 
Consequently to obtain the same Action Potential at the nerve 
fiber using only electrode stimulation, two possibilities exist. 
First the direct nerve fiber stimulation can be made by changing 
the nerve membrane potential in order to produce a membrane 
depolarization above the threshold of Voltage Sensitive Na+ 
Channels (Nav) to create an AP [12]. The second solution 
consists in opening the potassium channels of the stereocilia to 
recreate the complete stimulation process. As HC or stereocilia 
are disfunctionning in the vast majority of implanted patients, 
only the first mechanism is considered in this paper.  
Electrical model of electrodes inserted within the cochlea 
have been proposed by Hartmann et al. [13], where the spatial 
distribution of electrical potential was measured for intracochlear 
stimulation.    In addition, electronic model of electrode/neuron 
coupling is available in [14] in order to reveal the most efficient 
coupling conditions. However, both models lack of physical 
connection with AP generation. In this paper, we present an 
electrical description of the electrode and organ of Corti in order 
to obtain theoretical minimal stimulation voltage sent to the 
electrodes for AP generation. Furthermore, this model allowed us  
to link the stimulation voltage with the duration of the nerve 
fibers stimulation. Finally the impact of surrounding electrodes 
were theoretically investigated. 
The next section presents the theoretical model developed for 
the Organ of Corti associated with the electrodes. Then, 
simulation results from Spice software are presented. Finally, the 
conclusion and future work direction are  presented.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
The electrical equivalent circuit of human tissue used in this 
paper is the one presented in figure 3 and extracted from Cole 
and Cole impedance model [15], which has been shown to fit 
experimental data. The human tissues considered were the one 
present in Figure 2. The value of Rs, Rp and Cp were obtained 
using a gain response extraction over frequencies analysis. As the 
maximum hearing frequency is 22khz, it was considered in this 
paper that Rp could be neglected as it models the energy loss in 
high frequencies. 
 
Figure 3. Human tissue electrical analog [15] 
 
To obtain the numerical values for Rs and Cp for all the 
tissues or interfaces, we use the physical equations for the 
capacitance (parallel-plate capacitor) and for the resistance 
computation (cylindrical resistance model) [16] [17]. 
The values of the relative permeability and electrical 
conductivity for the nerves were extracted from [18] or from [19] 
for platinum as electrodes are mainly composed of it. However as 
far as the authors know, no relative permeability or electrical 
conductivity was available for Deiter cells or Basilar Membrane 
tissue. As Deiter cells are mainly composed of microtubules [20], 
which are involved in mechanical transport as actin proteins 
found in muscles cells and because the width of the BM is 
negligible compared to the Deiter cell height, we chose to take 
the relative permeability and electrical conductivity of muscle 
cells to characterize those two tissues.  
On the other hand, the computation of the capacitance and the 
resistances (Cpatch, Rppatch, Rspatch ) between two electrodes is 
more complex, as highlighted Figure 4, those variables depend on 
the distance between the two electrodes. The Cable Model 
Theory was used to compute those variables as the space between 
two electrodes is composed of various tissues rendering the Cole 
and Cole model implementation difficult. We simplified the 
tissue between two electrodes as only made of Deiter cells, then 
we implemented the Cable Model Theory in order to obtain a 
general impedance depending on the electrodes distance.  
 
 
Figure 4. Two surrounding electrodes influences the nerve fibers targeted.  
 
To compute Rspatch, the cylindrical model of resistance was 
considered. The cylinder going from the first electrode to the 
second electrode, as defined in Figure 5.a, was used to compute 
Rspatch (expressed in (1)):

[23]. y is the variable shown in Figures 5.a, 5.b and 5.c. ÏƒM is the 
electrical conductivity of  muscle cells. 
Rppatch models the resistance between the two longitudinal edges 
of the cylinder defined previously. Hence, this computation 
changes as expressed in (2), as it models all the losses through 
the ground from one electrode to another one.

Figure 5. Physical model of Rspatch (5.a), Rppatch (5.b) and Cppatch (5.c) 
 
The electrical description containing only a single electrode is 
shown Figure 6.a. The input voltage generator is directly 
connected to the electrodes analog model (low frequencies 
model), which can be eventually considered as a perfect 
conductor compared to the other resistance values. Then the 
current can flow to the nerve cell or can go back to the ground. 
The current loss through the physical isolation between the 
electrode and the ground is neglected as the insulator has a low 
loss tangent (high resistivity). The membrane rest potential of a 
nerve cell is around -70mV, explaining the two -70mV voltage 
generators, in figure 6.a. We defined the analog equivalent circuit 
of a nerve cell using a resistance (Rn) in parallel with a capacitor 
(Cn) (this electrical description should not be confused with the 
Hodgkin-Huxley model [24], which is used to model ions flow 
through the nerve cell membrane and not the electron flow). 
In addition, the electrical description of the system starting 
from the nerve and going through all the body to the earth was 
not considered because very little electrical current is going 
through this pathway.

Figure 8. Spike train generated by the electrode input voltage 
 
We performed also a parametric simulation using the 
electrical description of Figure 6.b, where the surrounding 
electrodes are added. The central electrode had a DC voltage of 
1V and we varied the voltage of the surrounding electrodes 
between 0.9 and 5V. According to RC values used in figure 6.b, 
analytical computation showed that when the voltage of the 
surrounding electrodes was maximum (5V), the nerve  fibers 
(above the central electrode) membrane potential Vm variation 
was 0.5mV, which was not high enough to stimulate these nerve 
fibers (the ones that should be stimulated only by the central 
electrode). 
The overall system consumption is a great significance as 
cochlear implants are not convenient for the user to recharge. The 
study of the power consumption is presented Figure 9. 
 
 
Figure 9. Current consumption during one stimulation period 
 
The current peaks during each input signal transitions could reach 
1A. Consequently, the maximum power consumed during a 
square input signal generation by the electrodes was around 1W 
(peak value), whereas the mean power consumed per period was 
around 50mW. These results may be used for the electrode array 
design to define battery size as well as electrode minimum width. 
 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
 
The theoretical electrical description presented in this paper 
was used to carry out simulations allowing the detection of the 
minimum voltage needed to ensure nerve fibers stimulation. This 
voltage was found around 0.9 V. Furthermore, the current peaks 
during each input signal transitions could reach 1A (peak value),  
and the mean power consumed per period was around 50mW. 
These results may be used as requirements for the electrode array 
design and corresponding control electronics. 
It has also been suggested that two consecutive electrodes 
were not disturbing one another and that the duration of the 
stimulation did not depend on the input electrode voltage. A more 
complex model, including the spike trains frequency (which is 
the number of spikes generated per second) related to the 
electrode input voltage is being currently developed. 
Besides physical tests are ongoing to ensure that the 
theoretical results obtained match the measurements. Deaf people 
using cochlear implants were asked to kindly submit themselves 
to cochlear implant reprogramming in order to test if the 
threshold of 0.9 V was sufficient; if not, it would greatly affect 
the perturbation between electrodes.
