electronics and computers have changed all of the industries, 
as well as the world itself. These technological advancements 
have evolved automotive industry by redefining the concepts 
like: performance, efficiency, fuel consumption, driving

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Oil sensors and analyzers are used in automotive and 
industrial applications to gather or send valuable information 
to ensure that the level of the engine oil does not become 
dangerously low without being noticed. The sensor monitors 
the oil level continuously during the entire engine operation, 
which means that the oil level can be prevented from falling 
below the minimum level during operation, which in turn 
means the oil film is not interrupted (which would lead to 
engine damage). Secondary influences such as the slope of 
the vehicle's lateral and longitudinal accelerations are 
compensated by the vehicle control unit calculating a mean 
value [1]. 
There are many oil level sensors in automotive, but most 
common approaches are ultrasound and resistance sensors 
[29]. Sensors using a resistance wire work with the principle 
of changing resistance and temperature of the wire between 
under and over the liquid. Sensor sends a current to the wire, 
and the output voltage differs by changing liquid levels.  
The ultrasonic level sensor, however, works on the 
principle of measuring the time-frame between transmitting 
and receiving of ultrasound waves. The ultrasound wave 
travels through material [2]. The sensors emit high frequency 
(20 to 200 kHz) acoustic waves that are reflected back to and 
detected by the emitting transducer affected by the changing 
speed of sound according to moisture, temperature, and 
pressures. Correction factors can be applied to the 
measurement level to improve the accuracy of measurement 
[3]. Ultrasonic sensors have advantages in dynamic 
measurements; nevertheless they are more complex and 
more expensive when compared with the resistance wire 
type level sensors. 
At this point, new approaches were searched and a 
possibility of applying Whispering Gallery Mode (WGM) 
theory into liquid level sensing is considered [14] [19].  
II. 
LIQUID LEVEL SENSOR DEVELOPMENTS IN HISTORY 
There are many different techniques in literature for 
measuring the liquid levels. Although, the concept 
development of sensors is parallel with the technological 
developments in electronics, some applications are much 
older than the electronics, like the Archimedes’ principle. 
 Archimedes’ principle also works for liquid level 
measurement. A cantilever beam is mounted into the liquid 
tank, and Archimedes’ principle raises the beam through the 
liquid, and load cell measures the deflection [4].  
Another method which uses ultrasonic lambda waves, 
was developed in Russia (2002). The principle of this study 
is based on the changing characteristics of lambda waves in 
the liquid environment [5]. 
Ultrasonic level sensor for liquids working under high 
pressure [6] was developed and performed by NASA 
Langley research center and Old Dominion University. The 
basic principle can be explained as follows; the ultrasonic 
waves sent by a transducer propagate and are reflected from 
the liquid surface, and the time between transmission and 
reception is converted to distance. 
An ultrasonic wave propagation method was developed 
in 2001 by BFGoodrich airplane advanced sensors 
department [7]. The principle is the same with the study 
before, sending and collecting ultrasonic waves, and finding 
the liquid levels according to the wave transfer times.  
A totally different method is the usage of fiber optics in 
liquid level measurement [8]. Fiber optic cables reflect the 
laser/light signal when in the air. However, when the density 
difference reduces, it transfers the laser light to the liquid 
environment, and thus, the sensor detects the liquid 
environment. 
Fiber optics is used again in another study [8]. The 
methodology used in [8] is as follows. While in air, most of 
the light rays reflect back, but in water light rays continue 
their way. The decrease in the level of reflected signals 
indicates that the optical fiber tip is inside water. The 
simplicity of the methodology implies that within the 
material property boundaries (between -20C and +70C) 
usage of optical fibers is easy, accurate and inexpensive.

In the case for automotive engine applications, however, 
although all of the above methods have different advantages, 
a new method is required. The design must have high 
precision, and needs to be small enough to be located into the 
engine and must be durable enough for working under 
flammable liquids or gasses safely. 
III. 
NEW OIL LEVEL SENSOR DESIGN 
A. 
Hella Sensor Design 
This study was first started with the idea of generation 
and development of a new oil level sensor which is 
integrated inside an oil pan (Fig. 1). The initial plan was to 
study with the engineers in Hella Company's (Hella KGaA 
Hueck & Co.) automotive sensors division [26]. 
 
 
Figure 1.  The current Hella oil level sensor, the picture in the right shows 
the sensor in it’s assembled position and Target of OLS Design [25]. 
According to the mutual 
study 
plan, available 
information is shared. The information include previous 
three dimensional (3D) computer aided design (CAD) 
models, design and finite element analysis (FEA) studies, as 
well as the test results of the previous ultrasonic oil level 
sensor. For this aim, Hella Company has been visited, and 
during this visit details of the ultrasound sensor, its 
development, production and validation stages have been 
evaluated. Design validation tests of the sensor are 
thoroughly investigated to setup a relevant computational 
model. 
The target of the Hella cooperated study is to work on the 
mechanical designs (material, sealing, mounting) in order to 
integrate the ultrasonic oil level sensor inside the vehicles oil 
pan.  
For design verification purposes, a FEA simulation 
model is developed to study overall thermo-mechanical 
performance and vibration influence. Following the 
computational verification of the model developed, rapid 
prototypes of the model are planned to be produced to 
perform the first functional tests by Hella. 
The main details of the FEA analysis are; the vibration 
profile and mechanical properties of the new sensor design 
under various temperature ranges, which are between -40C 
up to +150C. The endurance of the new design will be 
evaluated by using computer aided engineering (CAE) 
methods. 
Following the verification of an acceptable design, the 
physical samples made out-of rapid prototyping will be 
prepared, and tested submerged in oil within the real world 
experimental setup. The target is to reach an accuracy of -/+ 
0,2mm for sensing the oil levels. 
In the present the study, several sensor models have been 
analyzed, and a new, reliable design proposal is developed 
(Fig. 2) 
IV. 
FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION OF 
RESULTS 
During the FEA analysis, material properties of PA66-
GF35 [25] is assigned for the main sensor parts, while 
fixings are CuZn39Pb3 and grounding is CuNi10Fe1Mn 
[24]. Several meshing structures are tested and an optimum 
mesh structure is reached. Final mesh structure consists of 
over 76.000 tetrahedral elements and around 22.000 nodes. 
Following the “meshing” stage of parts, all the individual 
parts are assembled with an attention to the rigidity of each 
part and the model. During the analysis it is assumed that the 
oil level is low, which also demonstrates the worst case by 
minimizing the damping effect of oil in the sump.

analysis and the requirements of Hella GmbH. 
A. 
Modal Analysis 
The goal of modal analysis [27] is to determine the 
natural mode shapes and frequencies of an object or structure 
during free vibration. Since the model developed is of 
complex structure it is customary to use the finite element 
method (FEM) to perform this analysis, 
The types of equations which arise from modal analysis 
are those seen in Eigen systems. The physical interpretation 
of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which are determined 
by solving the system, correspond to the natural frequencies 
and related mode shapes. Usually, the modes that are 
dominant are the lowest frequencies which are the most 
prominent modes at which the object will vibrate, 
dominating all the higher frequency modes [23]. 
A sample of the results evaluated is presented in Fig 3. 
The results indicate very high strain and stress values only in 
7th, 8th and 9th modes, where the frequencies are 1635 Hz, 
2187Hz, and 2413Hz. 
All of the above frequencies are higher than the testing 
limits: (According to DIN EN 60068-2-6) [26], and our 
design is completely safe according to natural frequencies 
found in the modal analysis. 
The above conclusion is demonstrated in depth in the 
next section, which summarizes the stress analysis results 
under the testing conditions.

Stress-Strain Analysis in Freqency-vs-Acceleration 
 Frequency vs. acceleration values obtained from the 
Volkswagen Automotive test spec [26] in Table 1.,  are 
applied to the new sensor model designed and meshed  as 
summarized in Part A. 
TABLE I.  
THE FREQUENCY VS ACCELERATION VALUES 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Results of the stress-strain analysis under test conditions 
(Fig. 4) show that the  oil level sensor faces a stress value of 
not more than 0.21 MPa, which makes no deformation when 
compared with its Yield Stress and  Ultimate Tensile 
Strength values which ranges within  150-200MPa. Also the 
results show that there are no significant strain values.   
In summary, computational results indicate that, in these 
test conditions, the new design is assessed to be safe. 
 
Figure 4.  Fatigue Analysis Sample Results 
C. Fatigue Analysis 
Post processing of the results obtained show that, the 
stress values may not harm the design. However, the new 
model needs to be analyzed according to fatigue conditions 
to see the effects of cycling loads. 
For this aim Fatigue Strength Coefficient, Fatigue 
Strength Exponent, Fatigue Ductility Coefficient and Fatigue 
Ductility Exponent values have been found and inserted into 
the materials' database of the computational model [24]. 
Same loading conditions are repeated for many times to 
see the life-time of the model under the test conditions. The 
results show that expected lifetime is above 10^36 cycles. 
Safety factors have minimum values of 25.76 for fatigue and 
2.796 for strength. According to these findings it can be 
suggested that, the new design is absolutely safe according to 
both stress-strain and fatigue properties under cycling 
loading of test conditions. 
 
V. 
WHISPERING GALLERY MODE PHENOMENON 
A. 
Theory 
Following the above study, exploring the capabilities of 
Southern Methodist University Mechanical Engineering 
Faculty’s Micro Sensors Lab. a totally new type of liquid 
level sensor idea is activated.  
This new sensor is planned to detect pressure/force by 
using whispering gallery mode (WGM) phenomenon, and 
capable of working nearly in everywhere including 
underwater. 
The target is to develop sensor prototypes using the 
existing WGM theory. The test design includes equipments 
such as; laser as the signal source, micro sphere as the 
sensing element, fiber optics, and a liquid container as the 
test medium (Fig. 5). It is planned to perform the functional 
tests by using the Micro sensors laboratory of Southern 
Methodist University.

As a summary; results of the present work is aimed to 
include not only a new level sensor, but also a new 
perspective into the WGM phenomenon will be evaluated to 
create a completely new sensor to be used in automotive as 
well as in many other branches of industry. 
B. 
Equations 
In the whispering gallery mode theory, light undergoes 
total internal reflection, and because it is trapped inside the 
sphere, WGMs are observed under certain conditions. 
The details of the theory, the change in WGM spheres 
under pressure is as follows [19]: 
 
For r >>,  resonance condition (approximate): 
                  2π r n0 ≈         ( = integer)                            (1)      
 
n = Refractive index of the micro-sphere  
= Wavelength 
r = Micro-sphere radius    
 
  
 
 
 
 
                     (2) 
  
 
Figure 7.  Total internal reflections of the sensor, according to basic 
optical physics. 
When we look at Fig. 7 above, it can be seen that each 
time the light bounces off the inner surface of the sphere due 
to total internal reflection, the reflected wave experiences a 
“phase delay”,. This phase delay is a function of the light 
wavelength, λ; and incidence angle; as well as the sphere-to 
surrounding refraction index ratio, n1/n2. 
As it can be seen easily, the laser light comes into the 
microsphere in its contact point in the tapered film, and the 
light undergoes total internal reflections in the sphere, which 
causes the phase shifts or in other words WGM shifts.  
As illustrated in Fig. 8, while light starts re-circulating in 
the sphere a resonance shift occurs in the light when 
compared with the reference light beam. 
 
 
Figure 8.  The WGM phenomenon, and the phase shift (or the WGM 
shifts) caused by the total internal reflections occured in the microsphere 
[19]. 
 
Figure 9.  The experiment setup in it’s general form. The light coming 
from the laser splits into two  [19]. 
Fig. 9 presents the experiment setup in its general form. 
The light coming from the laser splits into two, leaving a 
small percentage for reference going directly to the 
photodiode, while keeping a high percentage (90% in this 
scenario) for WGM shift, which goes directly to the 
microsphere. So after the WGM phase shift occurs, it has 
been noticed by checking the differences between the 
reference light and WGM part of it 
When force is applied to the resonator, a change occurs 
in both the shape and index of refraction of the resonator 
(Fig. 10). The formulas below demonstrate that we can 
measure the force by detecting the changes occurred in the 
shape and the index of refraction [19].

Figure 10.  When force is applied to the resonator, a change occurs in both 
the shape and index of refraction of the resonator [16]. 
 
Figure 11.  Force versus Resonance results for different spheres [16]. 
In this manner, there are different kinds of sphere 
materials showing different responses to the measurements. 
Fig. 11 shows the different sphere materials and their 
specific values like Young’s modulus, index of refraction 
and Elasto-optical constant which all are related with the 
WGM measurement results. 
It can be observed that, the force shifts the resonance, but 
more importantly according to different materials, resonance 
shift also differs. 
Now if we use WGM phenomenon to develop a pressure 
sensor we can see that pressure changes of the medium 
surrounding the sphere will induce WGM shifts. 
This means by using the same formula [19]: 
 
(6) 
 
We can reach to the pressure as a function of the 
differences of sphere radius and index of refraction [19]: 
 
(7) 
 
If the stress and strain of a sphere is investigated, first the 
coordinate system should be defined (Fig. 12)  
After many calculation steps, the formulas below can be 
achieved [16].

By inserting the appropriate expression for the three 
principle stresses in                   we can obtain the dependence 
of the WGM shift on external pressure 
0P  for a PMMA 
spherical resonator as follows [19]:

This equation can be simplified - if the effect of 
ip (Which denotes Inner Pressure) is ignored [19]: 
(Please note that 
0p denotes External Pressure) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(10) 
 
 
 
This equation indicates the dependence of WGM shifts 
on external pressure
0P .  
Fig. 13 demonstrates the experimental results of a 
previous study [16] showing that the WGM resonances shift 
by applying force on the sphere.

resonance shift [19].

As a summary, WGM shifts can now be calculated 
according to the pressure changes of the medium, or in other 
words the external pressure changes. 
 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this study, development and verification stages of a 
new, state of the art, oil level sensor was presented. Finite 
element analysis and modal analysis results indicate that the 
new design may be safely used within the oil pan of the 
engine. Safety factors, 25.76 for fatigue and 2.796 for 
strength, indicate that the model is ready to initiate 
production of prototypes for experimental verification 
purposes.  
Research done within the scope of this study initiated an 
idea for developing a totally new liquid level sensor. The 
new sensor design is expected to detect pressure/force by 
using whispering gallery mode (WGM) phenomenon. This 
attempt is a new perspective into the WGM phenomenon. 
For this aim, the experimental set up outlined in this 
paper will be built and operated in SMU laboratories.
