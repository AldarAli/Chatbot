Abstract - This pilot project is one of the first applications
of Telemedicine solution (Telemonitoring) for comorbidity
and translational study. A total of 20 patients with
Diabetes
and/or
Cystic
Fibrosis
were
enrolled
to
a
telemedical intervention and assigned to different Groups.
The patients, who enrolled voluntarily, were as follows: 5
with consecutive Type1 Diabetes Mellitus and assigned to
Group
1;
5
with
Cystic
Fibrosis
already
under
Telemonitorig protocol and assigned to Group 2; 5 with
consecutive Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Cystic Fibrosis
already followed at Bambino Gesù Children’s Hospital,
Unit of Endocrinology and Diabetes and by Telemedicine
group of Cystic Fibrosis Unit and assigned to Group 3;
and 5 voluntary without disease assigned to Group 4
(Control group). The Aim of this study was to analyze
possible variation of Heart Rate Variability, depending on
the glycaemia value or Forced Expiratory Volume in 1
second in adolescent and adult patients with diabetes
and/or Cystic
Fibrosis
by telemedicine protocol
and
analyze the correlation between compliance and patients
technology background. In the first four months of
Telemonitoring, we received 855 glycaemia transmissions
and 378 spirometry test transmissions. We show a good
compliance
trend,
especially
in
the
patients
with
technology background. For the patients or patient family
members without technology background, we offered
telephonic assistance to verify the home procedures, and to
store and download the data. Preliminary analysis of data
showed no overall significant differences in Heart Rate
Variability parameters among the three groups. More
months of
observation are needed to show possible
correlation between Forced Expiratory Volume in 1
second, glycaemia value and Health Rate Variability.
Various Telemonitorig solutions could be important tools
for new international comorbidity research, but an easy
methodology to share the data from Home to Hospital has
to
be
taken
into
consideration
when
planning
a
Telemedicine protocol assistance.

I. INTRODUCTION
Heart Rate (HR) can appear static and regular at rest,
during exercise or recovery after exercise. However, HR
is constantly adjusted due to factors such as breathing,
blood pressure control, thermoregulation and the renin-
angiotensin system, leading to a more dynamic response
that can be quantified using Heart Rate Variability
(HRV).
HRV is defined as the deviation in time between
successive normal heart beats and the total HR variation
in a certain interval can be measured by non-invasive
methods [2].
HRV can serve as measure of autonomic activity of
sino-atrial node [1]. The clinical relevance of heart rate
variability was first appreciated in 1965 when Hon and
Lee [3] noted that fetal distress was preceded by
alterations in interbeat intervals before any appreciable
change occurred in the heart rate itself [4].
The clinical importance of HRV became apparent in
the late 1980s when it was confirmed that HRV was a
strong and independent predictor of mortality following
an acute myocardial infarction [4].
A high degree of HRV is found in compensated
hearts with good function, whereas HR variability can
be decreased with severe coronary artery disease,
congestive heart failure, aging and diabetic neuropathy
[5].
Diabetes is a hormonal disorder that affects around
three hundred million people worldwide [6]. Several
therapies have been proposed and a good compliance to
treatment offers patients a good quality of life. Diabetes
is a disease characterized by a group of metabolic
disorders caused by defects of insulin’s secretion and /
or activity.
The first condition is represented by a pancreas
inability
to
produce
insulin
and
the
latter
is
characterized by incorrect use of normal secreted insulin
(insulin resistance). Literature data concerning bronchial

reactivity in diabetic patients is controversial [7].
Changes in the respiratory system are little known,
tardive complications of diabetes. The mechanisms
which lead to dysfunctions of the respiratory system in
patients with diabetes might be: microangiopathy of
pulmonary
vessels,
changes
of
alveoli's
structure,
vegetative
neuropathy
of
the
respiratory
system,
changes of bronchi's reactivity and dysfunctions of the
mobility of the thorax [8].
The prevalence of complications such as micro and
macro angiopathy involving heart, kidney, eyes, Central
Nervous System (CNS) are also increasing, causing
severe economic and social burden [9].
Uz-Zaman, Salim et al. [9] show significant changes
of Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1), and
related
pulmonary
function
indicators,
in
Type-2
diabetes patients and it has been correlated with poor
glycemic control. The above pattern of changes are
possibly due to hyperglycemia induced non enzymatic
glycosylation of tissue proteins and chronic diabetic
microangiopathy
causing
basement
membrane
thickening (capillaries and endothelium) leading to
reduction in strength and elasticity of connective tissues
and reduced pulmonary blood volume.
Another chronic disease with impact on pulmonary
function is Cystic Fibrosis (CF). CF is characterized by
progressive lung destruction, caused by obstruction of
the airways due to dehydrated thickened secretions,
which
results
in
endobronchial
infection,
and
an
exaggerated
inflammatory
response
leading
to
development
of
bronchiectasis
and
progressive
obstructive airways disease [10].
In these patients, spirometry shows a reduction in
Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (FEV1),
and in Current Volume (FVC), (around 2 % of the
expected yearly value) [11]. In previous study [12], we
have shown how the Telemedicine can improve the
management of CF disease and prevent complications.
In
the
Pediatric
Hospital
Bambino
Gesu’,
Telemedicine is also offered in the follow up of diabetes
patients as additional service. In previous trial research
[13][14], we have also shown the impact of long-term
use of eHealth systems in adolescents with Type 1
diabetes. We demonstrated a favorable impact of
monthly tele-assistance (as phone call) on treatment
compliance.
We have shown how patients receiving frequent
feedback provided by the medical/multidisciplinary
team,
on
telemonitoring
procedure,
were
more
compliant in self-management of diabetes. In particular,
Telemonitorig protocol can help the medical team to
promptly give feedback on behavioral errors, and
insulin therapy adjustments. The aim of this study was
to find the correlation between HVR and FEV1 and
glycemia variations of patients with diabetes and/or CF
and control group in a pilot study of 4 months.
The main aim of this research was to understand if
HRV could be a cardiovascular prevention indicator
also in patients with diabetes and/or CF followed with
additional Telemonitoring assistance. The rest of this
paper is organized as follows. Section II describes our
methods, including the enrolling criteria. In Section III,
we
present
our
results.
Section
IV
presents
our
conclusions and ideas for future works.
II. METHODS
We have performed an observational study with 20
volunteer patients already followed at Bambino Gesù
Children’s Hospital. The patients enrolled had different
diseases: Diabetes and/or CF. They were assigned to a
telemedical intervention and divided in 3 Groups, plus
one Control group with volunteers, without disease. The
voluntary patients enrolled were as follows:
5 with
consecutive
T1DM
(SAP-treated)
and
assigned
to
Group 1; 5 with CF already under Telemonitorig
protocol and assigned to Group 2; 5 with consecutive
T1DM and CF already followed at Bambino Gesù
Children’s
Hospital,
Unit
of
Endocrinology
and
Diabetes and by Telemedicine group of Cystic Fibrosis
Unit and assigned to Group 3; and 5 assigned to Group
4 (Control group).
The
Telemonitorig
intervention
guaranteed
tele-
assistance and tele-interaction between the medical
team, engineers and the patients/families.
All
the
enrolled
patients
were
monitored
and
followed for a study-period. Patients with a Tanner
Stage <IV (pre-pubertal) were excluded from this study.
The Tanner System describes the sequence of changes
in secondary sexual characteristics and is the staging
system
utilized
most
frequently
in
children
and
adolescents.
Moreover, in order to exclude a potential effect of
duration
of
disease
on
diabetes
compliance
and
management capacities, patients with diabetes duration
<1
year
were
excluded
from
the
randomization.
Furthermore, the mean HbA1c level in the year before
randomization was evaluated for each study group.
A. Standard protocol
During the whole study, all patients had a regular
standardized
protocol
training
of
education
about
correct
diabetes
and
CF
control
provided
by
a
multidisciplinary
team
(diabetologist,
specialized
doctor, nurse, dietician, and psychologist). All the
patients and their families were given instruction in
carbohydrate counting, spirometry and RR test
(RR
interval variations present during resting conditions
represent beat-by-beat variations in cardiac autonomic
inputs ) procedures and were recommended to follow a
balanced nutritional program with a calorie intake
regularly
distributed
between
carbohydrate
(55%),
protein (15%) and lipids (30%).
Moreover, all of the enrolled subjects followed a
similar and regular aerobic physical activity program for
a total commitment of three hours per week with or
without oxygen, depending on the clinical conditions.
All patients were equipped with a Glycaemia kit
consisting of an Android Tablet [Noesis- Infosolution
Spa].
In addition, all patients were equipped with a watch
Polar V800 and heart rate sensor able to record RR
value for the HRV analysis, for one week a month for 4

months.
Patients in the telemedicine group and control group
were asked to do a glycaemia control 5 times/day and an
RR measure for 5 minutes/day for one week a month for
4 months and spirometry.
The Telemonitorig window period for this pilot study
was fixed for only four months because of the median
stability of HVR of each patient, in the short period.
Also, patients with CF were asked to perform a
spirometry test every day, as usual, using the CF
Telemonoring protocol. All the other enrolled patients
not having CF were asked to perform a spirometry test
during a hospital visit with Spirobank-MIR, during the
equipment meeting, and not less than once per month.
All spirometer tests were analysed with WinSpiroPro
Software (MIR developer).
A
personal
online
website
profile
on
Polar,
Noesis.Infosolution and dedicated internal Network
EAD1 (Food Diabetes Education), was edited in order
to receive regular feedback provided by the medical
team during the virtual sessions at one-month intervals,
by the engineer with one week intervals to have
information about the quality of the transmissions or
about equipment information. They were also educated
and periodically (at 4 week intervals) retrained to use
App updates.
B. Data Analysis
All data received by mobile devices was stored on
the Noesis web server and exported from the local
server.
The spirometry file could be exported directly on
.xls, otherwise the data related on fitness activity could
be exported on .csv and it was converted into .xls format
afterwards. The same was done for the first App release
and so for glycaemia data.
C. Data Transfer
The patients were able to share the data in different
ways, depending on the device. RR value was stored by
USB connection on the PolarFlor software on each
patient profile.
The data transfer, from spirometry to hospital, was
done by an integrated SIM for internet connection.
The glycaemia values were transferred by USB
connection from glucometer to Android tablet and
shared onto the Noesis server thanks to SIM for Internet
connection. The RR value was acquired by Polar V800,
downloaded by Polarflow software, exported in .csv file
and analysed with HRV-Kubioshrv Software.
D. Data Storage
All patients accepted the analysis of the data in line
with the international guideline for the privacy of the
data.
The data was stored on Polar web-site (PolarFlow);
for the spirometry data was stored on MIR server and at
Bambino Gesù Children’s Hospital. The glycaemia data
was stored on Noesis server and shared with the hospital
as .csv file.
III.
RESULT
Patients with Diabetes and/or CF were enrolled,
assigned to a telemedical intervention and divided into 4
groups.
In the first two months of Telemonitoring, we
received 322 transmissions. We recived a total of 855
glycaemia
transmissions
in
the
last
month
of
Telemonitoring.
In the first two months of monitoring, the most
compliant with the protocol were 2 patients with only
diabetes and 3 patients with diabetes and CF. The
glycemia transmissions from most complaint patients
are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2.
For the spirometry test, we received data from CF
patients only by Spirotel II-MIR. During the 1th period
of trail, 3 CF patients were hospitalized, so they did not
send the data and 1 patient asked to be enrolled in a
different time period. Nevertheless, we received 378
transmissions with spirometry test.
-All RR data, downloaded on PolarFlow (Figure 4),
was
analysed
with
HRVkubioshrv
Software
and
exported as .pdf file, as shown in Figure 3. All values
were acquired with Polar V800 (Figure 5).
For this project we chose an observational window of
4 months because 3/4 weeks of HRV screening was
valued enough for this kind of patients, to show some
cardiac dysfunction or index of cardiovascular risk
associated on glycaemia value.
Preliminary analysis of data showed no overall
significant differences in HRV parameters among the
three groups. In detail, no overall significant reduction
in HRV parameters could be observed in DM1 and CF
patients as compared to normal subjects, suggesting the
lack of significant abnormalities in our selected group of
patients. It is important to highlight that a significant
reduction
in
(Root
Mean
Square
of
Successive
Differences) RMSSD was found in CF patients when
reduction in FEV1 was reported, often preceding acute
respiratory complications. This finding is in accordance
to the
notion
that
acute
increase
in
the
patient
inflammatory status reduces HR variability, through a
mean increase in heart rate. Nonetheless, in our study
population, this finding might be of interest as it shows
that acute reduction in HRV in these high-risk patients
might represent, similarly to what is already known for
acute reduction in FEV1, a preclinical sign of incoming
complications,
thus
suggesting
more
aggressive
monitoring and need for prompt clinical evaluation.
We
did
not
observe
any
learning
difference
depending on the age of the patients, but we showed
some learning difficulty, depending of the technology
background.
IV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
This pilot project is one of the first applications of
Telemedicine solution (Telemonitoring) for comorbidity
and translational study.

In our study, we started a new Telemedicine protocol
for cardiologic prevention screening in-patient with CF
and or Diabetes to show the possible correlation
between FEV1, glycaemia value and HRV index.
We show a good compliance rate, especially for
patients with technology background. For the patients or
patients
family
members
without
technology
background, we offered telephonic assistance to verify
the home procedures, and to store and download the
data.
A
long
period
of
time
of
several
months
of
Telemonitoring is needed to find more co-morbidity
correlation between decrease in FEV1 and RMSSD.
After 4 months of Telemonitoring, it was possible to
detect
some
important
reduction
of
RMSSD
in
association with FEV1 reduction, before unpredictable
hospitalisation.
More months of observation are needed to show
possible correlation between FEV1, glycaemia value
and HRV.
The pilot study will be extended for patients with CF
and diabetes, so with higher risk of cardiovascular
complications.
More
pilot
studies
are
needed
using
the
Telemonitoring program for comorbidity analysis. Care
must be taken when purchasing devices in order to
choose the most accurate, intuitive and with an accepted
communication protocol.
