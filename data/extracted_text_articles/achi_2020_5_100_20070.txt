Abstract—Handedness detection has an effective role in classifying
different criminal suspects into speciﬁc categories according to
soft biometric properties. It determines human motor skills that
are performed with the dominant hand while doing everyday
activities such as writing and throwing. In this context, this paper
offers a system that extracts the characteristics of a person’s
drawing patterns and uses these features to perform handwriting
classiﬁcations with regards to handedness. For this, we collect
left and right hand data and derive various types of parameters
such as elapsed time, x-coordinate, y-coordinate, pen pressure,
pen orientation, and pen height. We deﬁne different features
like mean, maximum, minimum, writing pressure, speed, and
Dynamic Programming (DP) for handwriting data for analysis.
P-value and t-test are calculated for handwriting evaluation.
Furthermore, handedness detection is achieved by using a Sup-
port Vector Machine (SVM) classiﬁer. The result shows quite
encouraging performance that highlights the effectiveness of the
proposed system.

INTRODUCTION
Handedness is a complex characteristic in human behavior
that reﬂects the domination of the brain that is related to
quantitative change. The use of the dominant hand instead
of the other hand makes it more efﬁcient and comfortable
for everyday tasks. This became increasingly evident during
childhood and persists throughout life. Handedness can be
used to identify a person’s cognitive ability and personality
concerning ﬁne motor skills and manual functionality and
help to ﬁnd suspects in criminal investigations. Many scholars
have explained that psychological traits i.e., developmental
process, cognitive abilities [1] and personality [2] are re-
lated to hand preferences. In [3], Nicholls et al. proposed a
cognitive ability scale and hand preference test, which are
subtle and sensitive measures of hand performance. Gradient
feature-based biometric traits, such as handedness, age, gender
prediction suggested in [4]. This work is addressed how to
automatically predict these soft biometric features from the
handwritten text. Moreover, in [5], Morera et al. proposed an
ofﬂine handwriting-based gender and handedness prediction
system. From the handwriting, they introduced a deep network
in order to solve demographic classiﬁcation problems. How-
ever, handwriting recognition can cause some problems when
writing with inter- and intra-individual variations. This can
be assessed by analyzing the correlation between the writing
velocities of each test for each participant. Pressure and stroke
sequences, use of different pen types, or background noise are
also major concerns. Wang and Chuang [6] proposed a pen-
type input device to detect trajectories for handwriting digits
and gestures. They extract time and frequency-domain features
from acceleration signals and then identify important features
by a hybrid system. We, therefore, focus on the detection of
handedness based on drawing pattern by analyzing elapsed
time, x-coordinate, y-coordinate, pen pressure, pen orientation,
and pen height. We consider different statistical methods and
DP distances as a feature for handedness analysis and we make
a classiﬁcation using the SVM classiﬁer.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section
II describes the proposed methodology. In Section III, we
describe the data acquisition process and analyze the results.
Section IV concludes this paper.

METHOD OF HANDWRITING ANALYSIS
In this section, we explain the overall process of the
handedness detection system. Figure 1 shows the basic ﬂow
diagram of the proposed system. Data is acquired using a pen
tablet and processed for feature extraction. Then, we calculate
the t-test and p-value for each feature. Finally, we classify
handedness using different kernels of SVM.
A. Handwriting Feature Analysis
To extract the handwriting features, we create a reference
model. In this work, T represents the length of each input
data and NT represents the length of the coordinate points of
the reference model. t(n) is the elapsed time after the start
of the test, p(n) is the writing pressure, x(n) is the positional
coordinate in the horizontal direction, and y(n) is the positional
coordinate in the vertical direction. The experimental data is
acquired by following (1), where n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , N.
S(n) = [t(n), p(n), x(n), y(n)]
(1)
The reference model is deﬁned using (2) where xT (nT ) repre-
sents the positional coordinate in the horizontal direction and
yT (nT ) is the positional coordinate in the vertical direction.
ST (nT ) = [XT (nT ), yT (nT )]
(2)
where nT = 1, 2, 3, ..., NT . To evaluate the differences be-
tween right handed and left handed persons, we obtained some
statistical features that are shown in Table I. Moreover, we had
measured the DP distance using the DP matching algorithm as
a feature.
B. Dynamic Programming (DP) Matching
DP matching is a pattern recognition methodology used
in many studies in the ﬁeld of signature authentication and
speech recognition [7][8]. It calculates the distance between
sample data and input data which optimizes all route-to-
route measurements through backtracking. In this study, the
differences between the right handed person and left handed

person are deﬁned as the total cost DPx of the optimum route
and are calculated as the difference between the cost and the
sample data. d(i,j) was measured by the distance between the
x-coordinates of input data and reference data, as shown in
(3) and (4). The cost Cx of DP matching was calculated from
using (5).
d(i,j) = xγ(i) − yj
(3)
(4)
DPx = g(NT , N)
(5)
d(i,j) deﬁnes the distance between the ith coordinate point of
the sample data and the jth coordinate point of the input data.
DPy is deﬁned similarly. After that, these analysis methods
are used to recognize the differences between a right handed
person and a left handed person.
C. Handedness Classiﬁcation using SVM
Support Vector Machine (SVM) differentiates the advanced
features into different domains based on the concept of ﬁnding
a hyperplane [9]. In this work, we use different kernels, such
as linear, polynomial, Radial Basis Function (RBF) to classify
handedness. Table II shows the function of different SVM
kernels.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
The experiment aims to classify handedness, provide hand-
writing features for analysis, and evaluate performance through
machine learning techniques.
A. Data Acquisition Process
We used a liquid crystal tablet (Wacom Cintiq Pro 16) to
collect handwriting data. Random participants are requested
to draw and write characters that can be obtained as 6-
dimensional data sets such elapsed time, x-coordinate, y-
coordinate, pen pressure, pen orientation, pen height. The
elapsed time since application startup (ms) and the x-
coordinates and y-coordinates are represented by the pixel
value. The writing pressure is represented by a 215 scale;
the value decreases as the writing pressure becomes weaker
and the value becomes larger as the writing pressure becomes
stronger. The pen orientation is represented by 90 degrees
while the pen is positioned vertically on the surface of the
board and the pen was at close to 0 degrees while it was
horizontally aligned to the right of the board surface. As the
tip of the pen points to the top of the display, the horizontal
component of the height of the pen increases and the value
decreases when pointing down. The value range is expressed
between 0 and 1800, and the height angle can be calculated by
dividing the value obtained by 10. However, these data were
acquired as time-series data at an average of 40 ms. We used
these parameters to detect and analyze the differences between
handedness. Ten people (7 right handed and 3 left handed)
participated in the handwriting experiment as we collecting
data. Figure 2 shows some examples of handwriting samples
in handedness detection. Samples 1 to 3 are continuous spiral
writing, 4 to 6 writing a line in different directions, 7 is
writing a square continuously, and 8 and 9 are dotted lines.
The participants we asked to write the same character in the
blank space in 10 and 11.
B. Results Analysis
We calculated handwriting characteristics from each sam-
ple data of each individual. Also, the t-test was performed
and the p-value was calculated for each feature. Table III
shows the results of the t-test analysis from each feature. In
all results, the difference between right handed and left handed

individuals was signiﬁcant at the 5% level. Finally, the results
of signiﬁcant differences were found to be the maximum
pressure, the average pressure, and average velocity. For the
classiﬁcation process, we used and compared the different
SVM classiﬁcations techniques shown in Table IV. The highest
recognition accuracy at the highest pressure and the average
pressure is about 95.20%. In the Polynomial kernel, we have
achieved the highest accuracy in analyzing Pmax and Pmean
features. Thus, a major difference between the right hand and
the left hand has been observed from the pressure analysis
of the pen. Table V presents the comparison of recognition
accuracy with a state-of-the-art system.

CONCLUSION
This work addresses the use of a statistical and DP distance
feature to detect handedness. The SVM classiﬁer is used to
identify left hand and right hand individuals. We used built-in
datasets in the experiments. There are 10 people who partici-
pated to create the dataset. We collected left handed and right
handed data for each individual. We analyzed six parameter
values, such as elapsed time, x-coordinate, y-coordinate, pen
pressure, pen orientation, and pen height. From the results, we
can say that the pressure of the pen is an important feature
of distinguishing the handedness. The average classiﬁcation
accuracy of handedness is 95.20%. The obtained results reveal
that the proposed system provides a signiﬁcant improvement
compared to the state of the art. In future work, we will explore
more robust optical features and review various integrated
feature identities and create a feature ranking to improve the
detection of handedness.
