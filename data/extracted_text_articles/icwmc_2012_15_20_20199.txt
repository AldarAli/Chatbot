Abstract—In this paper, we propose a novel relay selection 
scheme based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) decision 
criterion for a dual-hop semi-blind (DHSB) amplify-and-forward 
(AF) relaying, where only long-term channel statistics at the first 
relaying hops are taken into consideration. The observed channel 
gain vectors across the cluster of the first hops are provided to 
the selection algorithm, which then selects the relay node which 
has the “most likely highest probability of channel power gain 
distribution” using a posteriori likelihood ratio over a burst time 
period. The other selection scheme based on the maximum first-
hop signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) is also compared, taking 
into account sample mean of channel power gain. Fixed gain 
relaying is adopted to constrain our DHSB system for both MAP 
and first-hop SNR based relay selection schemes. The outage 
performance of max-min sense end-to-end SNR relay selection, as 
a conventional scheme and benchmark, is compared to our 
proposed schemes. Simulation results demonstrate that, in terms 
of outage performance, our proposed MAP-based relay selection 
scheme is particularly appropriate for a DHSB relaying network.

 INTRODUCTION  
Various 
selective 
cooperation 
schemes 
have 
been 
investigated recently with the objective of improving 
transmission throughput and reducing outage probability [1, 2, 
3, 4]. There are two common selection relay schemes for 
which the amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward 
(DF) modes are adopted. For practical relay networking, it is 
realized that the AF relaying protocol provides the simplest 
and most economic relaying approach [1, 2, 5, 6, 7], where 
the relay node (R) forwards the received signal from the 
source (S) to destination (D) after scaling it to meet its power 
constraint. The relay selection schemes presented in the 
literature [1, 5], using the so-called max-min relay selection 
scheme, are primarily based on the selection criteria of 
instantaneous SNR across both relaying hops (S-R   R-D), 
with the proviso that the achieved transmission rate is 
satisfied. However, this approach likely introduces high 
computational complexity of the relay link instantaneous 
channel power gains (via channel estimations) and inadequate 
real-time capability for executing the selection algorithm [8, 
9]. As a consequence, it results in performance degradation of 
the relay selection operationally. These drawbacks can be 
mitigated if relay selection solely depends on the long-term 
channel statistics of the source to relay link (i.e., first-hops), 
where the dual-hop semi-blind (DHSB) AF relay was 
introduced [12, 14].  
In reality, it is impossible to switch (select) the relay node 
per symbol base, but which can be determined objectively in 
terms of sample mean of 
i
SNR with long-term channel 
statistics. Therefore, the maximum a posteriori probability 
(MAP) is based on the maximum-likelihood decision criterion 
which is simple and needs a minimal amount of statistical 
information (i.e., probabilistic channel description). Similar to 
the MAP approach using long-term channel statistics, a first-
hop SNR-based relay selection is also considered in the 
DHSB relay system, in comparison with MAP-based outage 
performance. This is measured on the first and second 
statistical moments of the channel parameters (i.e., sample 
mean of channel power gains) without stochastic channel 
description. However, the conditional mean is not linear in the 
time-varying fading channel. Therefore, it is possible to cause 
a large error variance of the channel power gain that will 
result in the performance degradation on the relay selection. 
Accordingly, that gives the instantaneous end-to-end SNR 
based max-min relay selection a degraded performance. 
Hence, we turned our attention to the MAP relay selection, 
and the problem in determining the optimum channel range 
over the observed relaying links which has the minimum 
average risk for the relay selection. We assumed that the 
perfect channel state information (CSI) and statistics orders 
are estimated at the source node via the down-link pilot sub-
channels. These parameters are then fed back to the 
destination for decision algorithm via dedicated uplink control 
channel sequentially.  
Recently, a performance analysis of DHSB AF relaying 
over Nakagami-m fading channel has been investigated based 
on the end-to-end SNR [11, 14], however, there are no relay 
selection methods being discussed. In this paper, we have 
focused on the outage performance of a DHSB AF relaying 
scenario with our extended the maximum a posteriori 
probability (MAP) decision algorithm for the relay selection. 
Hence, the MAP-based relay selection scheme does not 
require calculation and comparison of end-to-end signal-to-
noise ratio (SNR) across relay hops, since it calculates the a 
posteriori probability using long-term channel statistics and 
then selects the relay link with the highest probability over 
multi-relaying links. The main contributions of our work can 
be summarized as follows. 
A) 
A novel relay selection scheme based on MAP decision 
rule is proposed for the DHSB relay system, where M-1 
likelihood ratios of the first hop channel gains are 
exploited. Hence, our proposed selection algorithm

SNR relay selection scheme. This greatly reduces the 
complexity of implementing the selection 
B) 
Our presented outage probabilities also include the 
performance constraint on the relay selection where it 
was not discussed previously in most of the publications 
[1, 5, 9, 12]. 
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section II 
describes the system model and AF relaying implementation. 
Section III discusses implementation issues of the MAP relay 
selection scheme. Simulation and analytical results are 
compared in terms of outage probabilities are provided in 
Section IV. Section V concludes this paper.

SYSTEM MODEL 
Fig. 1 shows a dual-hop AF relaying network incorporating 
the MAP decision algorithm. For the 
th
m  relay node, m = 1, 
2,…, M, the channel gains, 
Sr ,Rm
 and 
rRm D
, , denote the first 
hop from the S node to the R node and the second hop from the 
R node to the D node respectively. We assume that 
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) static Rayleigh 
fading [10] occurs across all relay hops S-R and R-D. The 
channel statistics (i.e., mean, channel covariance) of both 
relaying segments corresponding to the channel state 
information (CSI) are assumed to be perfectly estimated via the 
pilot sub-channels, and centralizes these parameters available 
to the MAP decision algorithm at D node. Hence, the AF gain 
can be formulated to an inverse function of the average channel 
power gain of the first hop [11, 12]. In our paper, the MAP 
decision algorithm (i.e., a special case of the Bayes decision 
rule) [13] is implemented to minimize the average cost per 
decision of relay selection, where the most likely highest 
probability of channel power gain distribution is measured over 
M first-hops on a per burst basis. The problem with minimizing 
the average cost is solved by selecting optimum channel gain 
regions.

These optimum regions are then provided to calculate the a 
posteriori probabilities for each relay node. As a result, the 
selected relay node with the maximum a posteriori probability 
is determined from among the set of relay nodes.  
As for the transmissions from source to relay, the 
instantaneous SNR on the S-R link is proportional to its 
corresponding channel power gain

is defined as 
the distance between the

represents the path loss factor. Thus, the instantaneous SNR

It is assumed that instantaneous channel power gains

(i.i.d.) random variables, corresponding with channel gains,

 and

M, respectively, according to Rayleigh fading assumptions. As 
a long-term post processing is applied to our relay selection 
scheme, the mean channel gains
Sr ,Rm
and 
rRm D
,  are given by 
averaging over a time-slot period.  Thus, the instantaneous

Since we consider a dual-hop AF relaying system, the 
transmission period from the S-node to the D-node is divided 
into two consecutive phases. In the first phase, the S-node 
transmits signal s  to the

 In the following, we consider that the relay system operates in 
a half-duplex mode (i.e., time division duplexing system) and 
only one selected relay node is allowed to transmit per time slot.

MAP RELAY SELECTION SCHEME 
A. Relay Selection Criterion 
For a DHSB AF relaying system, the relay selection 
criterion will proceed to jointly search for the channel statistics 
which has the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) over 
the first hop (stochastic fading channel). The selected relay 
has

after scaling it to meet its transmit 
power constraint for a target spectral efficiency  (bit/sec/Hz). 
As such, a relay selection rule can be classified as M-1 
likelihood ratios for each relay link (first hop between S-R), 
and this is subject to : the vector observations of the channel 
gains, the conditional probability density function, a prior 
probability and decision cost factor with respect to each radio 
link. Therefore, the a posteriori probabilities can be determined 
in terms of these given information individually using Bayes’s 
rule [13]. The MAP selection process can thus be divided into 
two steps: (1) jointly identify the optimum channel gain ranges 
on the first hops where the average decision risk is minimized; 
and (2) achieve maximum a posterior probability by 
integrating its corresponding channel gain range. Let the 
conditional PDF,

channel gain vectors are random processes with Rayleigh 
distribution and its variance 

vectors are composed of the channel sequences of the first 
relay hops. This gives our analysis a boundary over three times

 for each first relay hop. It 
also corresponds to the probability of exceeding the Rayleigh 
envelope by one percent (1%) via setting the standard deviation

Jakes’ model [10]. For the

fulfilling the DHSB AF relaying system design, we found that 
this simplified selection rule is more practical since it resulted 
in faster selection by eliminating the search through all 
possible end-to-end SNR comparisons in general relay 
selection schemes.

NUMERICAL ANALYSIS 
In this section, we illustrate by simulation the outage 
performance of our proposed MAP-based relay selection 
scheme on behalf of a DHSB AF relaying system. Our analyses 
started with relay selection using the MAP decision algorithm, 
then the outage performances were analyzed via Monte-Carlo 
simulations. For a single relay link, the outage is generally 
given by

The target spectral efficiency is  = 1 bps/Hz and M = 4. To 
fulfill our optimum decision input parameters and numerical 
analyses, the variances of the instantaneous channel gain of the 
first hops were calculated in the basis of block lengths of 100 
channel samples at each relay link and the outage probabilities 
were averaged over a collection of 2000 channel segments for 
each SNR value. Note that the relay selection is performed 
form block to block and the average SNR is considered in 
symmetric relay hops (i.e.,
2

single hop SNR). The 
relay links are generated using Rayleigh fading channel model 
[10] with normalized Doppler frequency
fdT  .0 05
, and have 
equal average end-to-end channel power gain across all relay 
links. 
In Fig. 3, the outage performance of MAP-based relay 
selection (DHSB AF), is compared with the analytical max-
min based selection [Equ (5), 5] as a benchmark, and the first-
hop SNR based selection (semi-blind AF) are also presented. 
Both MAP and first SNR based relay selection schemes are 
provided for the DHSB AF relay networking. The simulations 
were conducted for multi-relay M = 2, 3, 4, respectively. We 
found that with an increase in the number of relay nodes, the 
outage probabilities decrease as selection diversity gain is 
available correspondingly in all cases. Comparing with the 
max-min sense analytical results, our proposed MAP scheme 
introduces about 3 dB degradation at a
.3
10  outage rate, whilst 
there is a 4 dB degradation with first hop SNR-based selection. 
It is generally accepted that end-to-end SNR selection gives 
higher expected reward, but will consume more computational 
load. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig.3. Outage performance comparison with max-min end-to-end SNR 
based selection (Analytical) and proposed MAP-based selection 
scheme (DHSB AF) and first-hop SNR based  (semi-blind AF) with 
multi-relay M = 2, 3, and 4 respectively. 
 
Through our simulation results, we confirmed that our 
proposed MAP-based relay selection scheme consumes 
approximately 1 dB less energy than the first hop SNR-based 
selection when considered with a DHSB AF relaying system. 
Although a full-CSI assisted end-to-end (max-min) selection 
scheme has better performance than DHSB AF relaying, this 
incurs a greater computational load in selection algorithm 
implementation. As a result, our proposed scheme gives a 
simple and effective approach to practical DHSB AF relay 
networking design. 
 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Through our simulations, we confirmed that the MAP-based 
probabilistic channel description approach relay selection 
outperforms the first-hop sample mean SNR based selection 
for a DHSB AF relaying system using a long-term channel 
statistics scenario. We also found that it introduces a 3 dB 
performance degradation at outage level 
3
10  against max-min 
sense relay selection scheme, whilst substantially simplifying 
and reducing the relay selection process in terms of 
computational load. The numerical and simulation results 
demonstrate that our proposed MAP-based relay selection is 
appropriate to DHSB relay network design in terms of the 
implementation simplicity and outage performance. It is also 
interesting to derive an analytical expression of the outage 
probability jointly considering the relay selection performance 
(i.e., MAP-based selection algorithm), not merely adopting a 
generic outage definition. This will be helpful to evaluate the 
overall system performance in practical relaying network 
design.
