Abstract— Usability is an important quality factor for the 
success or failure of any website. Users of university websites 
encounter various usability problems during the navigation and 
information searching activities. Studying these problems is a 
critical issue for the success of the growing higher education 
market. The main goal of this paper is to identify usability 
challenges encountered by the users of university websites. We 
conducted an extensive literature review in this regard. We 
identified numerous aspects of usability and relevant challenges 
to those aspects. We also presented proposed solutions from the 
existing literature. This study will help to have a deeper insight 
into user requirements to develop usable university websites. 
Keywords- Usability; Usability evaluation methods; Usability 
issues; University websites. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Usability is one of the critical criteria of website quality. 
Nielsen has defined usability as "a quality attribute that 
assesses how easy user interfaces are to use"[1]. Another well-
known definition of usability given by the International 
Standards (ISO 9241-11 1998) is the effectiveness, efficiency, 
and satisfaction with which specified users can achieve goals 
specified in a specified context of use" (ISO 9241-11 1998). 
The success or failure of any website relies on that user should 
not face any obstacles during the website's usage. Web 
usability has a combination of multiple components to look 
upon, which are relevant to the amount of time required to 
learn to navigate a website, how quickly the desired goal is 
achieved, and the user's perceptions[2]. 
Numerous studies have employed evaluation techniques to 
assess the site's usability by measuring user performance and 
satisfaction and then suggesting enhancements to the site's 
usability. 
Researchers 
proposed 
several 
evaluation 
approaches to assess the usability aspects. Usability 
Evaluation Methods (UEMs) could be classified into three 
categories: 
(1)User-based 
methods, 
(2)Experts-based 
methods, and (3)Tool-Based Methods[3]. User-based 
methods involve assessing the interface by the users and 
finding usability issues, such as questionnaires and interviews. 
Expert-based methods involve having several experts' 
examinations of the user interface, such as heuristic 
evaluation. However, both approaches were conducted to 
evaluate the external attributes of the site (e.g., design 
consistency). Unlike other methods, tools-based methods aim 
at assessing the website's internal attributes that users or 
experts cannot perceive (e.g., the quality of the HTML code). 
Nowadays, the importance of universities' websites has 
increased with the rapid development of technology. Such 
websites' importance comes from being a gateway to provide 
information and services. It is also a marketing tool to reach 
potential students. Most universities' websites provide the 
same information and services. In order to achieve the aims of 
such websites, universities should consider usability while 
developing and improving their websites. Many studies found 
in the literature evaluated the usability of university websites 
by employing different usability evaluation methods, such as 
questionnaires[3]–[6]and heuristic evaluation. Some studies 
employed two or more evaluation methods [7][8]. 
This study investigates various usability problems found 
in university websites and extracts their proposed solutions 
from existing literature. The paper also aims to understand 
university websites' specific characteristics and usability 
aspects. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 
2 provides a background of usability evaluation approaches, 
and we present the methodology used in this study in Section 
3. Section 4 presents issues and challenges followed by 
proposed solutions in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes 
the paper. 
II. 
BACKGROUND DISCUSSION  
Usability evaluation methods mainly aim to identify 
usability problems on systems evaluated. According to 
Nielsen[9], usability problems can be defined as the user 
interface aspects that may have any negative effect on the 
user. It may negatively affect usability factors, such as ease of 
understanding, learning, usage, and user satisfaction. Many 
research studies evaluated the usability of university sites by 
employing different usability evaluation methods. As a result, 
various 
usability 
problems 
were 
detected 
through 
experiments. 
Several studies[3]–[6][10]–[12] involved users in the 
usability testing of university sites by using questionnaires, 
user testing, or/and other methods. Those studies assessed 
university sites usability' from the students' point of view. For 
example, Christoun et al. [4] investigated student satisfaction 
with the usability, aesthetics, content, and technology of a 
college's site of one of southeastern Massachusetts' public 
institutions of higher education. Hasan [3] also evaluated the 
usability of nine Jordanian university sites, while [5] 
67

investigated the usability of the Benue State University 
Website in Nigeria. Jabar et al. [6] measured the usability of 
the top three Malaysian university websites from students' 
perspectives. The study [11] used user testing and interviews 
to assess the effect of the information architecture of 
Dalhousie University's Website, including how information is 
categorized, labeled, and presented and how navigation and 
access are facilitated. Furthermore, Kasli and Avcikurt [12] 
evaluated 132 educational websites in Turkey using website 
evaluation forms and interviews. 
Other studies employed heuristic evaluation or other 
expert-based methods to identify university site usability 
problems. Kostaras and Xenos [13], for example, evaluated 
the usability of the new site of Hellenic Open University. 
Similarly, Astani and Elhindi [14] selected the top 50 
universities in the U.S to rate by two experts based on the 
design characteristics of sites. Furthermore, Hasan [7][8][15] 
investigated the usability of university sites in Jordan using 
heuristic evaluation based on the set of heuristics proposed by 
Hasan [16]. Nizamani et al. [17]tested the usability of the top 
10 universities of Pakistan by utilizing guideline scoring. 
In order to sufficiently identify usability problems on 
university sites, some studies utilized a combination of two or 
more approaches. Qasim et al. [18] used questionnaires and 
heuristic evaluation to assess university sites' usability in 
Pakistan. The study [19] combined heuristic evaluation and 
performance measurement to assess the usability of the 
Hellenic Open University(HOU) Website. Pierce [20] also 
evaluated the usability of the Harvard University site by 
heuristic evaluation and user testing. Furthermore, Majrashi 
and Hamilton [21] used several methods, including usability 
testing, heuristic evaluation, experts review, and competitive 
analysis. They evaluated the usability of the Jazan University 
site in Saudi Arabia and the RMIT University site in Australia. 
Also, the study investigated the design and content of eight 
university sites worldwide to identify the necessary content 
and essential features that should be included in each 
university site. Erickson et al. [22] evaluated the accessibility 
and usability of university sites using accessibility and 
usability evaluation methods. 
Some studies found in the literature utilized automated 
evaluation tools. Al-Ananbeh et al. [23] employed HTML 
ToolBox, SEO PageRank, and PageRank Checker to evaluate 
eighty sites for universities in the Arab countries 
automatically. Islam and Tsuji [24] also combined automated 
tools and questionnaires to test the usability of some academic 
sites in Bangladesh. The literature outlined above proved the 
usefulness of usability evaluation methods regarding their 
ability to detect various usability problems on university sites. 
The identified problems were collected and analyzed to 
provide valuable sources, including the different types of 
usability problems that could be found on any university site, 
along with the solutions.  
III. 
METHODOLOGY  
In order to get an insight into the usability issues faced by 
users of university websites, we performed an extensive 
review of the literature. The goal is to analyze scientific 
studies related to university site usability', focusing on issues 
and solutions. We formulated the following research question 
for our study:  
• 
What are the common usability issues found in 
university websites and how to resolve those?  
      To address the research question above, we have 
completed an extensive literature review. The phases of the 
study are shown concisely in Figure. 1. 
 
 
 
 
In this study, we considered only studies that achieved the 
following inclusion and exclusion criteria: 
• 
We included studies that discuss university websites' 
usability or conduct experiments to evaluate 
university websites' usability worldwide by utilizing 
different usability evaluation methods and identifying 
usability problems or providing solutions. 
• 
We excluded studies that have no relation to 
university websites or those concerned with systems 
relevant to university websites (e.g., e-learning and e-
library). 
The methodology phases are explained below:  
Phase one: We identified the main search terms: usability, 
usability issues, usability problems, usability evaluation, and 
university websites. And then searched through digital 
databases: Google Scholar, IEEE, Elsevier, ACM, and 
Springer link using keywords. We focused on highly relevant 
papers and restrained the search to human-computer 
interaction/computer science studies if the search engines 
supported it. As a result, we obtained 5139 papers from the 
five digital library databases (Google Scholar -1840, IEEE -
1480, Elsevier -159, ACM -1452, and Springer link -208).  
Phase Two: We performed a quick reading for the title and 
abstract of all collected papers to do a preliminary paper 
classification (relevant, irrelevant, and need further reading). 
And then, we skimmed papers that needed further reading by 
reading relevant sections (e.g., the introduction and 
conclusion). Finally, we performed snowballing on the 
selected relevant papers, scanning their reference lists to 
identify additional relevant studies that we did not include. 
The studies were included or excluded based on the identified 
criteria.  
Phase Three: We read the whole text of the papers and 
identified the final set of papers, which was 27 papers. And 
then, we explored papers thoroughly to extract relevant 
information.

IV. 
USABILITY ISSUES AND CHALLENGES 
Usability issues mostly lead to a delay in accomplishing 
users' tasks or preventing achieving their goals, which 
frustrate them. Some reviewed studies have provided more 
detailed descriptions of detected usability problems. After the 
literature survey on usability issues, we collected and 
classified ninety-two specific usability issues into seventeen 
categories. Each category of the seventeen categories and 
relevant usability problems are explained below: 
A. Design Issues  
Twelve usability problems are relevant to four major 
design issues: overall web pages design, inconsistency of 
fonts and images, appearance issues regarding links and 
elements, and overcrowded elements and information. 
• 
Overall web pages design: Inconsistency of design 
and layout of web pages color (e.g., an inappropriate 
combination of background and font colors)[5][7][8];  
inconsistency of the interface language (i.e., some 
pages on the English interface displayed Arabic or 
English content)[7][8]; inconsistency of the content 
(e.g., content differed between English and foreign 
language 
interfaces)[7][8]; 
inappropriate 
page 
heading[7][8]; inappropriate design of the main menu 
(e.g., the menu items unseen or could not be 
selected)[7][8]; unappealing aesthetic features[6]. 
• 
Inconsistency of fonts and images: inconsistency in 
font case (capital and small), size, style (regular and 
bold), and color[3], [5]–[8], inappropriate number, 
size, or quality of images[7][8][24], and broken 
images[5][7]. 
• 
Appearance issues regarding links and elements: 
misleading links (e.g., elements looked like links, but 
no action is performed when clicked)[21], and 
inconsistency or incorrect alignment of the headers 
and content (center, right, or left) [7][8][21]. 
• 
An overcrowded element and information (e.g., 
unnecessary elements and information and an 
overcrowded advertisement) [6][21]. 
B. Navigation Issues 
• 
Users get lost within the website pages [5][21]. 
• 
Difficulty finding or using a site map (e.g., the site 
map is not linked to all the website pages) [21]. 
• 
Links Errors: broken links [5][7][10]; under 
construction and maintenance pages [21]; dead node 
pages (orphan page) [7][8][21]; links not opening the 
destination pages [7][8]; misleading links [7][8]; and 
links causing the menu to disappear [7][8]. 
• 
Global navigation issues: it is a common navigation 
pattern located on the top of every page. This section 
is reserved for links of top-level categories, logos, 
search bars, and other important elements. This 
pattern issues include the following: the global 
navigation disappearance (e.g., university logo,  home 
page link, and other navigation options are 
disappeared, do not work properly, or does not exist 
at all) [7][8][21]; poor or inconsistent design of global 
navigation [21]; elements of global navigation issues 
(e.g., primary users sections have not included as 
categories in the global navigation) [21]. 
• 
Lack of Navigation Patterns (e.g., breadcrumbs)[21]. 
C. Ease of Use Issues 
• 
Difficulty in interaction with a website [3][7][18]. 
• 
Lack of support in more than one language [3][7]. 
• 
Lack of considering the usage for blind and other 
disabled individuals (e.g., use of an inappropriate 
color like green which is not suitable for color 
blinds)[25]. 
D. Visibility of System Status Issues 
Invisibility may cause some issues, mainly if the process 
consumes time. Users have to be informed about the progress 
of any processed process, their current location on the website, 
and where they go next. The category includes the following: 
the invisibility of search query (e.g., status progress of 
submitted search) [21]; the invisibility of other processes 
status (e.g., the progress of downloading files or submitting 
forms)[21]; and invisibility of selected icons and links status 
(e.g., icon and link are not highlighted when they selected) 
[13][24][25]. 
E. Load Time Issues  
The load time of websites should be reasonable. Some 
websites were evaluated and found to be too slow [5]. 
F. Compatibility Issues 
• 
Browsers Incompatibility [5][24]. 
• 
Devices Incompatibility (e.g., lack of following the 
platform guidelines for mobile version) [21][23]. 
G. Content Issues 
The most important component of a university website is 
information content. 
• 
Inadequate Information [5][8][17][20][26].  
• 
Empty Pages [7][8]. 
• 
Old Information [7][8][17][26]. 
• 
Inappropriate content (e.g., repeated or very concise 
content) [7][8]. 
• 
Information Classification issues (e.g., the contents 
were 
not 
classified 
by 
headings 
and 
sub-
headings)[21]. 
• 
Labels of Links and Button issues (e.g., button and 
link labels did not start with action words) [21]. 
• 
Content Errors (e.g., punctuation or grammatical 
errors) [7][8]. 
• 
Lack of Technical Information (e.g., information 
regarding the file types that will open through 
links)[8]. 
H. Search Issues 
Earlier studies showed that the most preferred features on 
educational websites from the user's perspective are useful 
navigational support and effective search tools [7]. The 
category comprises the usability issues encountered by users 
during their search for information.

• 
Ineffectiveness of search tools [4][7][8][11][17][26]. 
• 
Limitation of search scope [21]. 
• 
Intolerance of Errors (e.g., misspellings) [21]. 
• 
Lack of refining and filtering mechanism [17][21]. 
• 
Lack of research suggestions [21]. 
• 
Lack of search scope customization [21]. 
• 
Lack of support features (e.g., autocomplete) [21]. 
I. User Support Issues 
 For users to accomplish their tasks and look for information 
needed in the website, it is necessary to provide good support 
for the users to achieve tasks quickly and easily. 
• 
Lack of Help and Documentation (e.g., lack of hints 
to help navigate or to complete tasks, and lack of 
tutorials, services documenting, and the FAQ)  
[12][18][17][21]. 
• 
Lack of support for login and authentication processes 
[21]. 
• 
Lack of support for services (e.g., services guide) 
[12][20][21]. 
• 
Lack of Search Support [20][21]. 
• 
Lack of helpful error messages [21]. 
• 
Use of technical language in error messages (e.g., 
using “attribute” term rather than “field” term) [21].  
J. Information Architecture Issues 
The organization and classification of the website's 
content and pages must be easy for accessing and finding 
information.  
• 
Labeling issues (e.g., not self-explanatory, perplexed, 
or generalized labels) [5][11][21]. 
• 
Hierarchy issues [11][21]. 
• 
Organization system issues(e.g., deep hierarchy) 
[11][21]. 
K. Data Entry Forms Issues 
• 
Form Fields and Text Area Problems (e.g., lack of 
form features that help users input the proper data like 
default values)[21][27]. 
• 
Form button problems: lack of following the 
standards in labeling and positioning of buttons (e.g., 
use the label  “OK” for the submitting button rather 
than “Submit” label, buttons are not located based on 
the natural reading order of the website audience, or 
two buttons have the same function, but they are 
located in different places)[21]. 
• 
Form Feedback problems (e.g., providing feedback 
without full description of what is happening, using 
poor language (like "adding process is done"), or 
using 
inappropriate 
color 
for 
a 
particular 
message)[21]. 
• 
Label alignment problems (e.g., labels are far from 
the fields) [21]. 
• 
Unhelpful error messages [21]. 
• 
Form functionality issues (e.g., difficulties regarding 
correcting errors when submitting an incomplete form 
or with non-expected data entry, and synchronously 
validation of the form before being submitted)[21]. 
L. Accessibility Issues 
Among the users of university websites, there are a rising 
number of disabled users, such as individuals with visual 
impairments and individuals with reading-related and learning 
disabilities. As such, it became necessary for the designers of 
university websites to consider the specific needs of such 
users and make modifications needed to ensure web content 
accessibility for all users as possible.  
• 
Accessibility issues regarding performing tasks (e.g., 
tasks cannot be completed using only the 
keyboard)[21][22].  
• 
Accessibility issues regarding design (e.g., poor 
contrast between text and background and lack of 
meaningful alternate text for inaccessible graphics) 
[21][22]. 
• 
Forms accessibility issues (e.g., labels of form fields 
do not match the visible text for that element when 
read by the screen reader) [22]. 
• 
Accessibility issues regarding navigation (e.g., lack of 
helpful skip navigation links)[22]. 
M. FamiliarityIssues 
Information presentation has to be in a logical order and 
follow real-world convention. 
• 
Matching the real-world convention issues (e.g., 
registration instructions are displayed at the end of the 
registration task rather than at the top of tasks to read 
them first)[21]. 
• 
Using unfamiliar terminology (e.g., using unfamiliar 
words to typical users, such as operational rules term, 
bursar, and provost[21], and lack providing a 
reference 
for 
the 
user 
that 
contains 
such 
terminologies) [20]. 
• 
Form issues (e.g., inappropriate or illogical structure 
and elements alignment) [21]. 
N. User Control and Freedom Issues 
While conducting the tasks on university websites, 
sometimes users face critical situations, such as making 
mistakes in previous stages or facing some difficulties. They 
need some way of going back or undoing[21].  
• 
Lack of ways to undo actions (e.g., cancel button or 
back button not existing ) [21]. 
• 
Lack of navigation options (e.g., lack of link of the 
main page of the category, lack of link of "Back to the 
top" on the pages that have a too long amount of 
information[13][19][21], and indirect navigating 
ways through key topics in the site)[20]. 
O. ConsistencyIssues 
This category is nearly overlapped with all aspects, such 
as design, navigation, and content, whereby consistency is 
pivotal for all aspects of a website's usability.  
• 
Unexpected placement of elements (e.g., sign out was 
not in expected place) [21].  
• 
Navigation Inconsistency (e.g., inconstant navigation 
bar and different format of menus on the page) 
[13][20][21].

ACHI 2022 : The Fifteenth International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interactions

• 
Content Inconsistency (e.g., forms buttons labeled 
inappropriate or very ambiguous names[13], and 
blank front pages of some categories)[19][21]. 
• 
Design Inconsistency (e.g., inconsistent design of 
website pages in the form of colors, fonts, and 
languages[3][13][19][21]. 
• 
Search Facility Inconsistency(e.g., a search box is not 
in its standard location)[21].  
P. Prevention of ErrorIssues 
Users can not always avoid errors while using the sites; 
therefore, preventing errors upfront from occurring is a good 
feature for websites [21].  
• 
Lack of preventing errors of forms (e.g., lack of hints 
clarifying the required data format and permitted 
length, lack of showing the mandatory fields up front, 
lack of submission confirmation of critical form)[21]. 
• 
Content ambiguity or presentation errors[20](e.g., a 
single command has different jobs, and a single 
animation image leads to navigate to two different 
pages)[21]. 
• 
Links errors issues (e.g., invalid and unimplemented 
links) [21].  
• 
Search facility errors[13][19]. 
Q. MemorabilityIssues 
• 
Memorization of Information (e.g., need to memorize 
courses ID when students attempt to enroll in courses 
or read multiple pages when looking for information 
relevant to a particular topic)[21].  
• 
Memorization of task's Instructions[21]. 
• 
Memorization of navigational paths deep (e.g., menu 
with 6 levels deep[13][19][20]. 
V. 
OBSERVATION AND PROPOSED SOLUTIONS 
This section presents guidelines for designers of university 
sites to achieve the advantages of usable websites. An 
essential component of a university site is information. The 
university sites usually provide information and services for 
students and staff. Information should be accurate, updated, 
and consistent. Accessing information should also be quick 
and easy for students. Logically organize information (e.g., 
courses classification by degree, school, and campus[21]), 
follow real-world conventions, and avoid deep hierarchy. 
Terminology and links labels should be self-explanatory, 
accurately describe the relevant contents, and be familiar in an 
academic environment. The site should provide information 
regarding the file types that open through links (e.g., DOC and 
PDF files)[8]. Students and staff should be able to contact via 
contact services(e.g., email and contact forms). Access and 
search tools should be well worked. The search facility has to 
offer refining and filtering mechanisms, alternative search 
suggestions, 
support 
features 
(e.g., 
autocomplete), 
customizing search scope, and the search scope should include 
the entire university site [21]. The university site should 
support the native of most students and other commonly used 
languages (e.g., English language).  
      Since the university sites are too large and have many 
branches, using navigation patterns, such as breadcrumbs is 
very useful. Navigation options should be consistent, 
implemented correctly, and placed obviously on all site pages. 
Include global navigation in the most frequently visited site's 
pages and use other navigation patterns (e.g., breadcrumbs) 
for other pages[21]. The University logo should be linked with 
the 'Home Page' and be placed in the global navigation area. 
The global navigation has to include the main content 
categories (e.g., students, staff, research, and program and 
courses)[21]. All links should open intended and expected 
pages. Design site map and a site index (A-Z) appropriately. 
The site should provide information about under construction 
and maintenance pages, or redirect users to alternative pages 
that provide the same information or services[21]. 
It is necessary to provide good support for students and 
staff to achieve tasks quickly and easily (e.g., Online 
enrolment). Provide assistance on pages with high error 
occurrences[21]. Make users feel in control in many 
situations. Offer multiple navigation options and help students 
undo some entries or exit from situations like the cancel button 
or back button. Provide helpful error messages in familiar 
terminology to help them recognize, diagnose, and recover. 
Provide immediate feedback in plain language and use an 
appropriate color after clicking the link or button (e.g., the 
color green indicates a successful process)[21]. The site 
should offer features that help students and staff input the 
correct data in the form fields (e.g., input hints and default 
values). The site must prevent potential errors in links (e.g., 
invalid links and unimplemented links), content (e.g., a single 
command has different jobs), and forms (e.g., errors of data 
entering). Students should not have to remember information. 
System usage instructions should be simple, easy, and 
visible[28][29]. The site should provide FAQ and 
documentation (e.g., documentation of student and staff 
services[21]) obviously and easily. Users should always know 
the progress of any query or process that is processed (e.g., 
downloading files or submitting forms), their current location 
on the site, and where they go next. The site must be accessible 
for diverse user groups, including disabled. Pages must work 
or display appropriately under different browsers and devices. 
Test the sites through common web browsers[23][28] by 
employing tools(e.g., Browser Shots)[24]. 
The site design component should reflect its intended 
function[28]. Make sure menu items and all content of pages 
should be aligned correctly based on the interface language. 
The load time of the site's pages should be reasonable. Display 
what the student need when and where they need it[21]. Do 
not burden frequently refreshed pages with many multimedia 
elements[28]. The site must follow navigation standards, 
forms, and search facilities (e.g., the search box placed in the 
expected place). Students and staff resources and other 
elements should be placed in the standard location to make the 
site easy to learn and remember. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
Using any system by actual users reveals some potential 
weaknesses 
that 
suggest 
usability 
problems. 
Users' 
preferences may affect and cause the classification of some 
71

issues as problems while they might never bother the other 
users. However, it still should be considered as a usability 
issue if there is an expectation that these issues may bother 
some actual users during their system usage[30]. Several 
literature reviews have been conducted on university site 
usability evaluation, but not many have focused on usability 
issues and solutions. Those studies discussed specific aspects, 
such as objectives, methods, and common usability attributes 
used. This research addressed a gap noted in the literature 
concerning the lack of a comprehensive source that cataloged 
different types of usability problems detected in university 
sites. We have identified and analyzed ninety-two different 
usability issues mentioned in earlier studies. We classified 
them into seventeen categories based on usability aspects 
violations. We also found an agreement among most of the 
reviewed studies as they mainly focused on some standard 
usability features, such as design, navigation, and content. 
This observation may indicate the importance of these 
features for the usability of university sites. 
Our study could be a valuable source for developers and 
researchers interested in university site usability. The 
developers could focus on these features to investigate and 
improve the usability of educational sites. In future work, we 
intend to develop a new set of usability heuristics that could 
be used as a comprehensive and reliable instrument for 
evaluating the usability of university sites. We are planning to 
have a follow-up empirical study to update the usability 
problems list and identify the severity and frequency of those 
problems. We hope that this study will contribute to a 
recommendation for improving university site usability.
