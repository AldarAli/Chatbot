Abstract—This paper introduces a criterion, based on the Lp-
problem, which has been employed to allocate capacity among
Earth Stations. The obtained allocations permit a performance
compromise between Packet Loss and Transmitted Power,
which are taken into account as performance metrics. More-
over, starting from the proposed Lp-problem based allocation
and considering speciﬁc analytical models for the Packet Loss
Probability (PLP) and the Transmitted Power (TP), the paper
highlights the existence of a Capacity Bound, independent of
the overall capacity available CT OT , on which the allocations
converge. The main contribution of the paper concerns the
performance analysis, carried out by simulation, which shows
that the proposed method enables a signiﬁcant savings of
capacity and Transmitted Power and simultaneously, with only
a limited worsening of the Packet Loss.

I. INTRODUCTION
Resource allocation in modern satellite networks, such as
satellite-sensor [1], LTE [2] and WiMax [3], plays a crucial
role and needs to be deeply investigated. In several previous
works (such as [4], [5], [6] and [7]), we consider a scenario
composed of a satellite communication system of Z earth
stations that receive TCP trafﬁc ﬂows from a ﬁxed number
of sources and forward them onto a common geostationary
satellite channel with an overall available capacity set equal
to CT OT [bps]. The channel state is modeled by considering
the fading effect, due to atmospheric conditions, that have
a negative impact on the quality of communications. As
a consequence, to compensate, we apply a Forward Error
Correction (FEC) encoding system, selecting the code rate
as a function of the fading level F, expressed in [dB],
undergone by each station. From the viewpoint of the
higher protocol layers (i.e., above the network layer) the
redundancy bits added to protect the transmitted information
cause a reduction of the available capacity for transmission.
Taking into account the proposed scenario, the problem con-
sidered in this paper is the well known capacity allocation
problem. The goal is to share the channel capacity among the
earth stations according to the policy deﬁned in [6] whose
performance is further analysed and discussed in this paper.
The proposed allocation problem models each transmission
entity (i.e., the Earth Stations) using some functions, which
values are directly proportional to the capacity allocated, that
represent some metrics that need to be optimized simulta-
neously (e.g., the Packet Loss Probability, shortly PLP, and
the Transmitted Power, shortly TP, as done in this work). If
the functions are in contrast to each other, as it happens
in the case of this paper, the solution of the allocation
problem must represent a compromise. For this reason we
use the Multi-Objective Programming (MOP) framework
to formulate the allocation problem thereby obtaining a
solution also known as the Pareto Optimal Point (POP)
set. To ﬁnd out a single solution from this set, which is
representative of the best compromise between the adopted
metrics, we apply the Lp-problem.
An important consequence of the proposed approach is that
its solution converges if CT OT increases (i.e., the Capacity
Bound (CB) discussed in [6]). It enables a signiﬁcant ca-
pacity savings with respect to the allocation of the overall
resources available on the channel: CT OT . In fact, sharing
all the channel capacity enables to optimize the value of a
decreasing metric, however this is not true for an increasing
metric. So it is useless to allocate the whole capacity but a
signiﬁcant portion can be reserved to increase the number
of earth stations that can transmit on the satellite channel.
It is worth noticing that all the stations, that are allowed to
transmit, experience the same conditions in terms of PLP
and TP.
The aim of this paper is to present a performance analysis
of the allocation problem proposed, by focusing on the
evaluation of the beneﬁts obtained, considering the value
of the PLP and the TP, with respect to the allocation of the
whole available capacity CT OT . Another key point of this
paper is the evaluation of the increment of the number of
earth stations computed by using a formula of the average
number of earth stations, which can transmit with ﬁxed value
of PLP and TP, is presented.
As next step of the research presented in this work, adaptive
modulation and coding techniques, applied together with
the resource allocation, for example based on the DVB-
S2 standard as in [8] and [9], will be object of thorough
study. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The
next section presents a brief survey of the state of the art of
resource allocation for satellite and wireless communications
systems. In Section II the model adopted for the capacity

allocation is presented while Section III describes the for-
mulae employed for the Packet Loss Probability (PLP) and
Transmitted Power (TP). Section IV presents the simulation
results that highlight the advantages obtained allocating a
capacity equal to the CB, obtained by using our allocation
method with respect to the allocation of the overall available
capacity. Finally Conclusions are drawn.
II. THE FORMULATION ALLOCATION PROBLEM
The model adopted in this paper and developed in
previous works by same authors ( [5] and [6]), is based on
three different components. The physical entities represent
the earth stations, which are composed by different queues
called virtual entities. Each queue is characterized by several
objective function that model some performance metrics
such as the Packet Loss Probability and the Transmitted
Power, as done in this work.
A. The MOP based capacity allocation problem
To formalize the MOP based capacity allocation we deﬁne
two vectors: the ﬁrst one, reported in (1) is the control vector
and contains all the capacities allocated to each virtual entity
for each physical entity considered. Formally we consider
that each physical entity is identiﬁed by z ∈ [1, Z]. Yz is
the number of virtual entities of the z − th physical entity.
Each virtual entity is identiﬁed by yz ∈ [1, Yz]. Myz is the
number of objective functions for each virtual entity yz.
Each objective function, of a given yz − th virtual entity,
is identiﬁed by the index m ∈ [1, Myz]. Cyz is the capacity
allocated to the virtual entity y of the physical entity z
C = (C11, C21, C31, ..., CY1, ..., C1Z, C2Z, C3Z, ..., CYZ)
(1)
In this work the capacity allocation is supposed to be
carried out in a centralized fashion: the control vector is
the output of a centralized decision maker and represents
the decision taken by the allocation algorithm, that is the
capacity assigned to each queue in each earth station. It is
worth noticing that the overall capacity allocated to the z−th
physical entity, Cz is the sum of the capacities allocated to
all its virtual entities that are Cz =
Yz
X
y=1
Cyz.
The second vector deﬁned is the so called objective function
vector and contains the value of each objective function of
each virtual entity in each physical entity. All the compo-
nents of this vector are the metrics, the PLP and the TP
analytically deﬁned in Section III that need to be optimized
simultaneously.
F(C) = (F1,11(C), ...
FM11 ,11(C), ..., F1,YZ(C), ..., FMYZ ,YZ(C))
(2)
In (2), the generic term Fm,yz(C) is the m − th objective
function of the y − th virtual entity of the z − th physical
entity. Considering the Multi Objective Programming theory
formalized in [5] with the control vector deﬁned in (1) and
the objective function vector (2) is possible to formalize the
MOP based capacity allocation problem as follows:

(3)
An important boundary is imposed in (3): the sum of the
capacity allocated to each virtual entity must be lower
or equal to the overall capacity available in the channel
CT OT . As a consequence the MOP capacity allocation
problem determines a feasibility region that contains all the
control vector that may be admissible solutions. The goal
of this allocation policy is to determine a control vector
Copt that simultaneously minimizes all the components of
the objective function vector.
The solution of the deﬁned problem is not single but
it is a set, called Pareto Optimal Points (POP) set. The
position of this set depends on the characteristics of the
objective functions considered: if all objective functions
are strongly decreasing [10], then a solution Copt is a POP
if and only if the solution is on the constraint boundary
Z
X
z=1
Yz

Cyz = CT OT . If this condition is not true the POP
set may also stay also inside the feasibility region which
means that the Pareto Optimal may also be a point for
which

Cyz < CT OT .
The
strongly
decreasing
assumption
concerning
the
objective-function vector is quite typical because common
performance
functions
applied
in
telecommunication
networks such as Packet Loss Probability, Packet Delay
and Packet Jitter are quantities that decrease their values
when the allocated capacity value increases. This is not
true if other important metrics are also used: power, but
also processing and computation effort. In those cases,
as done in this paper considering the PLP as one of the
adopted metrics, the allocation of the overall available
capacity CT OT may not be the optimal choice. In fact as
previously said the optimal solution may also be also inside
the feasibility region and not on the constraint boundary.
The aim of this paper is to identify a solution through the
MOP approach, as well as to compare the performance by
way of the results obtained sharing the overall capacity
available among the considered earth stations.
B. The Lp-problem based capacity allocation
As previously said, the MOP based capacity allocation
problem determines as a solution a set of points. In this

paper we apply the Lp-problem to obtain a single control
vector that represents a compromise between the adopted
metrics. The idea is to allocate capacity so that the value of
each objective function is as close as possible to its ideal
value. The set of ideal capacities (i.e. the ideal vector (4))
is composed of the ideal decision variable vector elements
CFk,yz

Each element CFk,yz
yz,id
can assume a value between 0 and
CT OT , independently of any physical constraint and of the
values of the other components of vector (4). It is called ideal
(utopian) for this reason. For example, if a generic objective
function is decreasing versus the allocated capacity, it is
obvious that it is ideal to use all the possible capacity CT OT ,
while if it is increasing versus capacity, it is ideal allocating
no capacity at all. The values of vector (4) are considered
known in the remainder of the paper while the vector in (5)
contains each objective function attaining its ideal value.

optimality of the solution. Modifying the values of the
weights it is possible to differentiate the importance of
the considered objective functions. As a consequence, the
proposed capacity allocation is elastic and can be applied
to
different scenarios with
heterogeneous trafﬁc ﬂow
with different QoS requirements (e.g., telephony, video-
conferencing, audio/video streaming, web transactions).
The most interesting contribution of this work, that is a
consequence of the allocation method proposed, concerns a
comprehensive analysis of the performance assured by the
existence of a Capacity Bound, that has been demonstrated
in [6]. This point represents a Pareto Optimal Point (POP)
on which the LpCA problem converges. It implies that, from
the practical viewpoint, a Satellite Service Provider may
provide capacity allocations to all the entities involved in the
allocation process without employing the overall available
capacity. It allows dedicating the rest of the capacity to
further possible entities. As shown in Section IV, moreover,
it can be done without penalizing the overall performance
and without capacity wasting.
III. THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTIONS
In this paper each physical entity represents an Earth
Station that transmits through a satellite channel and is
composed by a single queue (as a consequence, physical
and virtual entities are not differentiated). Each considered
entity is represented by two objective functions that are
the Packet Loss Probability, shortly PLP, due to congestion
(F1,1z = Plossz(Cz)) and the Transmitted Power, shortly
TP, (F2,1z = Wtxz(Cz)) and the constrain is deﬁned by the
amount of available capacity (
Z
X
z=1
Yz
X
y=1
Cyz ≤ CT OT ).
A. Packet Loss Probability Function
The PLP model used in this paper is referred to the loss
due to congestion for a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
based trafﬁc ﬂow and is analytically reported in (8):
Plossz(Cz) =
kz · N 2
z
( Rz·Cz·rttz
l
+ Qz)2
(8)
It is worth noticing that the PLP model adopted in this work
is a decreasing function with respect to the allocated capacity
Cz. Moreover in this paper, the values of the parameters
reported in (8), applied in the performance analysis section,
and the related meanings are: kz=128/81 is a constant
depending on TCP protocol, Nz =10 is the number of active
TCP connection for the z-th station, Qz is the buffer size,
equal to 10 packets, for the z-th station. rtt is the round
trip time, equal to 512 [ms], l =1500 [byte] is the TCP
packet size and Rz and Cz are the code rate and the capacity
allocated to the z-th station, respectively. Channel conditions
vary over the time and, in this paper, the undergone fading
level Fz for each station represents the satellite channel
status. Each Earth Station is supposed to apply different
code rates in dependence on the channel status modeled
considering the fading level. Code rates are assigned as in
Table I. This hypothesis allows considering packet losses due
to congestion because channel errors are made negligible by

applying encoding. On the other hand, as previously said,
from the application layer view point, represents a reduction
in the available capacity for the considered station. So the
detriment of the channel conditions due to the fading effect is
modeled by a reduction of the capacity available to a station
with respect to the portion allocated as reported in equation
(8) where the applied code rate is the capacity reduction
factor.
B. Transmitted Power Function
The TP of the z-th station is reported in (9):
T Pz(hz, Cz) = (2
Cz
W − 1) · 1
hz
(9)
Considering the formulation of the TP is possible to view
that it is an increasing function with respect to the allocated
capacity Cz. hz, called link constant in this paper, takes into
account the parameters related to the satellite link. In more
detail, it contains the transmission antenna gain GTz of the
z-th station, the receiver antenna gain on the satellite GR
(common for each station) both equal to 104, the Boltzman
constant k equal to 1.38·10−23J·K−1, the noise temperature
T set to 290 [K] (considering additive white Gaussian noise),
the bandwidth of the satellite channel W=1 [MHz] and the
Free Space Loss (FSL) set equal to 1019 as deﬁned in [11].
In practice, the coefﬁcient
1
hz is:
1
hz
= k · T · W · FSL
GTz · GR
(10)
The Transmitted Power function is obtained by combining
two equations: Cz = B · log2

the Hartley-
Shannon law, and


z = GTz ·GR·T Pz
k·T ·B·F SL that represents the
carrier to noise ratio [11].
It is worth noticing that the employment of equation (9)
as transmitted power function implies the hypothesis that
the transmission bit rate of the z − th station is equal
to the allocated capacity Cz. Both the objective functions
considered in this paper are continuous and differentiable in
R so assuring the existence of a solution of the Lp-problem
applied.
C. The Capacity Bound
In this paper we consider Z physical entities, a single vir-
tual entity for each physical entity (Yz = 1 ∀z ∈ [1, Z]) and
two objective functions for each virtual entity (k = 2 ∀yz ∈
[1, Yz], ∀z ∈ [1, Z]). Considering the two objective functions
previously introduced, the vector F(C), deﬁned in (2) it is
possible to deﬁne a capacity bound where our allocation
converges. In practice, given ﬁxed channel conditions, if
the overall capacity available for the entire communications
system signiﬁcantly grows, the POP solution provided by
solving (3), considering Jp(C) as deﬁned in (7), will not
signiﬁcantly change tending, in the sense of a horizontal
asymptote, to a quantity called Capacity Bound Cbound.
From a formal viewpoint,
Cbound =
Z
X
z=1
Cbound
z
, Cbound < CT OT
(11)
where Cbound
z
is the portion of capacity allocated to the
z − th Earth Station when the overall allocation converges
on the deﬁned bound. The mentioned Cbound exists and
is ﬁnished if Cbound
z
∀z ∈ [1, Z] is a quantity independent
of CT OT when CT OT tends to inﬁnity. [6] deﬁnes three
conditions, regarding the objective functions used, that
assure the existence of the capacity bound. Moreover
it demonstrates also that the proposed LpCA, with the
considered metrics, satisﬁes these conditions.
IV. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
The scenario considered in this performance evaluation
has been implemented through the ns-2 simulator. It is
composed by Z = 2 Earth Stations that transmit TCP trafﬁc
over a common geostationary satellite channel. The overall
duration of the simulation is 300 [s]. The allocation is done
each 5 [s] (i.e., allocation period) and the Fading Level
suffered by each z − th station, expressed by Fz, assumes
values, kept constant in each allocation period, that belong
to Table I. It is worth noticing that Fz is not included in (10)
because the fading is supposed to be compensated applying
the FEC encoding. As a consequence the terms Fz does not
modify the value of TP, which depends only on the FSL.
The main contribution of this section is the investigation of
the advantages of the proposed LpCA approach in terms
of saved capacity, which are strictly related to the existence
of the Capacity Bound. In more detail, the performed tests
consider the two earth stations with a random fading level
considered uniformly distributed among all possible levels
and the code rate is consequently chosen according to the
aforementioned table. Obviously, the fading level value is
considered known when the allocation algorithm acts. Each
value of the performance metrics reported in the ﬁgures
below represents the average of the values obtained by a
number of simulation runs aimed at guaranteeing a conﬁ-
dence interval of the 95%.
The Transmitted Power [W] (TP) values, reported in the
following ﬁgures, are computed through the objective func-
tion (9) itself on the basis of the allocated capacity
Cz; the packet loss has been computed, for each allo-
cation period, as the number of packets lost for conges-
tion over the number of sent packets, measured through

the available ns-2 simulation counters. For this reason,
in the following, the results are presented in terms of
Packet Loss Rate (PLR). Five weighs conﬁgurations are
applied to give more, or less, importance to an objective
function with respect to the other for both the stations
(z = 1 and z = 2): w1,1z=0.1 and w2,1z=0.9; w1,1z=0.25
and w2,1z=0.75; w1,1z=0.5 and w2,1z=0.5; w1,1z=0.75 and
w2,1z=0.25; w1,1z=0.9 and w2,1z=0.1.
The practical purpose of this section is to explicitly evaluate
the ratio between the obtained capacity allocations and the
related performance with LpCA, which operates at the
Cbound value, and the reference case in which the overall
capacity CT OT is employed.
To reach the aim, we deﬁne the quantity, Cref
z
, for the
z − th station, which represents the capacity allocated
to the z − th station according to its channel condition,
applying the LP CA and imposing that the overall capacity is
used, in practice
Z
X
z=1
Cref
z
= CT OT . Similarly, the quantity
PLRz(Cref
z
) and T Pz(Cref
z
) are, respectively, the Packet
Loss Rate and the Transmitted Power of the z − th station
obtained allocating to it Cref
z
.
In this work we deﬁne the Capacity Saving Ratio (CSR) as
the quantity reported in (12), which is the percentage of the
capacity saved using Cbound (i.e., to employ Cbound
z
for the
z−th station), with respect to the overall capacity available,
CT OT (i.e., to employ Cref
z
for the z − th station):
CSR =
Cbound − CT OT
 · 100
CT OT
(12)
In the same way, we deﬁne the Transmitted Power Saving
Ratio (T PSR) as the percentage of the average TP saved
with respect to the TP obtained sharing the overall available
capacity: (13).

the satellite channel. In this case Z is set equal to 2, CT OT
varies in the range [1 − 10]Mbps.
V. CONCLUSIONS
The
work
extends
the
capacity
allocation
method
proposed in [5] modeled as the MOP problem. In particular,
a criterion based on the Lp-problem is proposed to
ﬁnd out a capacity allocation, among Earth Stations,
representative of a compromise if Packet Loss Probability
(PLP) and Transmitted Power (TP) are taken into account
as performance metrics. Moreover, applying the proposed
Lp-problem based allocation and considering PLP and
TP analytically modeled as in Section III, the obtained
allocations converge on a Capacity Bound. This bound
is independent of the overall capacity available CT OT .
The
performance
analysis
shows
that
the
proposed
method enables a signiﬁcant capacity and TP saving and,
simultaneously, a limited worsening of the packet losses.
From the practical viewpoint, the paper contribution implies
that a Service Provider may provide capacity allocations
to Z Earth Stations without employing its overall available
capacity and may dedicate the rest of it to other possible
entities without penalizing the overall performance and
avoiding capacity wasting.
