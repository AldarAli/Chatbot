Abstract—Faced with the difficulty to know all the dangerous 
areas and find the latest information to avoid becoming the 
victim of a crime, this article proposes a mobile application for 
smartphones and smartwatches called Beware, which shows 
the dangerous zones within a specific geographical area 
according to the day and time of the week. This application 
also allows reporting emergencies to the corresponding 
emergency service entities and communicating events that put 
at risk the patrimony, life, body and health of other users and 
yourself. In addition, another Web application is proposed for 
the emergency service (police station, fire brigade or municipal 
patrols) responsible for receiving the emergency calls. User 
tests show that 14 out of 15 citizens consider that the proposed 
application is useful and very useful for public safety. 
Keywords-geolocation; mobile computing; crime prevention; 
smartwatch. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Public safety is promoted worldwide to effectively 
safeguard the inherent human rights, particularly, the right to 
life, personal integrity, the inviolability of the home, and 
freedom of movement; however, over 1.5 billion people all 
over the world live in countries affected by violence, 
conflicts and high criminal rates; over 526,000 people are 
savagely murdered every year, which is slightly more than 
one person per minute [1]. 
The fight against citizen insecurity, in general, comes 
from the different government levels whether local, regional, 
central or federal, and is executed reactively, aimed to 
capture delinquents before or after the criminal activity takes 
place, or in a proactive manner by attacking the root causes 
of citizen insecurity. In both situations, the information and 
communication technologies are an essential tool. One way 
information technology is used for prevention are the so-
called crime maps, which show information about the 
criminal activities within a geographical area. These are used 
in various countries, such as ‘CrimeReports’ [2] in the USA, 
‘InstaGIS’ [3] in Chile, and ‘Onde fui Roubado’ [4] in 
Brazil. However, most are Web applications, which makes 
them less used than a mobile app. They do not present 
information in real time nor the crime intensity like a heat 
map.  
This paper presents a smartphone and smartwatch mobile 
application that allows citizens to inform, in real time, about 
the security level of the area where they are located, and 
report any crime or possible crimes. It also proposes a Web 
application to be used by the police so they can see the 
criminal activities and act. The use of a smartwatch is 
justified due to its ease of use, low cost and lower theft risk 
compared to a smartphone. In addition, it is estimated that 
sales will be of 66.71 million units in 2017 [5] and by 2020 it 
will become one of the most sold wearables [6]. 
This article is organized in 5 sections. In Section 2, we 
present a review of mobile and Web applications related to 
crime maps. Section 3 describes the proposed mobile and 
Web applications. The use of these applications in an area of 
Lima, Peru, and its results are presented in Section 4. Finally, 
conclusions follow in Section 5. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
There are four important aspects to consider when 
developing a crime map mobile application: data collection, 
data analysis, architecture and related applications.  
The data is the most important component for the whole 
crime map. It must be timely, significant and of quality; 
however, many times this information is not available or 
accessible, therefore the work in this context is aimed at 
building a criminal database from different sources. The 
collection of data from sources such as websites, news sites, 
blogs, social media, and Really Simple Syndication (RSS) 
feeds is presented in [10]. In [12], the data is collected based 
on the information obtained from interviews with the police, 
reports and the documentation in the occurrence books. A 
crowdsourcing based mobile application that allows people 
to send information about criminal activities is presented in 
[14]. In Beware, we decided to collect crime information 
from 
different 
governmental 
sources 
and 
to 
use 
crowdsourcing, allowing users to report crime events into the 
mobile application. 
Once the crime information is obtained, it is analyzed to 
make decisions. The analysis could be about the criminal 
activity spatial (geographical) behavior, criminal records, 
crime trend, or urban infrastructure, among others. In [7], it 
is explained that a factor that could help reduce citizen 
insecurity is the analysis of the spatial behavior of the 
delinquents known within their activity space (Crime

Theory), since it can determine the likelihood of possible 
crime places. In [8], Sathyadeyan et al, include criminal 
records for the delinquents, the causes for crime occurrence, 
and every day crime factors. An emergency management 
system for public transport, based on a Geographic 
Information System (GIS), is proposed in [9], which includes 
the crime trend, and guides police officers might use to 
capture the delinquents. An analysis of the urban aspects 
related to criminal activities is studied in [15], where it is 
concluded that there is a correlation between the streets 
width, the number of construction floors, the type of 
facilities and neighborhood, and the criminal activities. In 
our approach, we not only count the occurrences of crime 
events in an area, but also take into consideration the aspects 
of the streets in that area that might represent a risk for 
people. This could be, for example, if the area has been 
abandoned or it has drug addicts rounding the streets (Table 
III). 
Several architectures have been proposed for systems 
related to public safety. A client-server software architecture 
to determine more accurately the police location is presented 
in [11]; this considers that the mobile device should have an 
Assisted Global Positioning System (A-GPS) and be 
compatible with a HyperText Markup Language version 5 
(HTML5) geolocation so it can connect with Google Maps 
API and the data center through JavaScript Object Notation 
(JSON). In [14], the architecture is designed around cloud 
development with the integration of GPS functions. In the 
same manner, in [13], the use of GPS is incorporated in the 
software architecture, and this consists of five layers: 
information knowledge layer, business support layer, data 
layer, business application layer, and user level. For our 
application, we considered to use GPS functionalities to 
capture, in real time, the user’s current location, and use the 
Google Maps API to show him/her current map positions as 
well as the dangerous zones and crime events reported 
around. 
There are several mobile applications related to public 
safety that take into consideration a crime map and allow 
reporting criminal activities. In [12], the authors added a 
search functionality for information about arrested people, 
the display of a map with the crime zones, and it also accepts 
alerts about new crime zones. [10] allows the police to 
receive information about the citizen’s location – by GPS – 
and for him/her to receive information about the closest 
police station. In [13], six crowdsourcing mobile applications 
were evaluated, among which we mention: CrimeWatch 
Mobile, which displays the crimes reported within a 1-mile 
radius around the user current position; Community Against 
Crime, which sends email or Short Message Service (SMS) 
notifications about crimes reported by a registered or an 
anonymous user; CommunityAlert that includes reporting 
floods or fires, which are sent to the closest police station; 
and MyDistress, from where the closest police stations can 
be located. The application proposed in [14] also includes 
sending a report through short messages, and phone calls to 
all emergency contacts and institutions. A HTML5 based 
application that allows police officers to register a crime 
according to the GPS location at that very moment, attach 
pictures or videos related to the incident, and display on a 
map or chart the crimes reported, is proposed in [10]. In the 
Beware mobile application, it is not only possible to report a 
fixed type of event, as shown in Table II, but also any other 
incident or emergency as, for example, a land slide or flood. 
We added a type “other”, which can be further explained by 
the user and viewable by others in the wall of events. 
Another useful feature added to the application is when a 
crime event (e.g. a house robbery or a fire incident) is 
reported close to a favorite location (e.g. your home, your 
university or your work) and a notification is sent to the user, 
so him/her can be timely informed. 
Three mobile applications were selected to analyze their 
features. These applications were downloaded and installed 
on mobile phones that supported Android. Table I shows the 
summary of each criteria we used for this analysis.  
Y = if the application complies with the feature.

Based on the evaluation of the applications, it was 
observed that the three applications do not show the reports 
of crimes on a map. Only one of them allows to show them 
in a list (Community Against Crime). In the case of the 
Community Alert, it allows to notify the user’s emergency 
contacts and shows the crime events, but in a general way

and without evaluating if they are close to the user. Two of 
the applications have not been updated in 4 and 5 years, and 
none of the three applications perform an analysis of the 
information shared by their users. In comparison to Beware, 
the crime reports users share are used to create dangerous 
zones, as well as official police records. This way, it is 
possible to provide more reliable information, since there is a 
risk that they will register non-real crimes. In addition, 
hazards that exist on the streets (Table III) and the possibility 
of notifying emergency contacts are included to create 
dangerous areas. Additionally, the application notifies the 
user when entering a dangerous area, sends the location and 
report information to a local authority and the emergency 
contacts if requested, displays a map with the crimes closest 
to the user's location and a wall with the list of crimes that 
includes photographs. 
III. 
BEWARE 
A. Background  
A mobile application called Beware has been developed. 
Its main objective is to warn citizens when they enter a 
dangerous area, report any crimes or risk events, and request 
assistance from an entity or emergency contact. To respond 
quickly to a criminal activity, the application has been 
designed to be used also by the security staff, police stations 
and fire stations. Also, with the information gathered, it is 
possible to generate a report of the crimes that are not 
reported to the police station and, in this way, create action 
plans.  
Figure 1 shows the interaction between the citizen and 
the functionalities that Beware offers.

Data Analysis 
The five steps for unstructured data analysis proposed in 
[8] and the criminal activities grouping given in [9] were 
considered. To collect data for the first time, public 
information sources were chosen, which are shown in Table 
II. After implementing the mobile applications for 
smartphones and smartwatches, these will be included as 
information sources for documenting new crimes.

The Public Safety Local Plans were reviewed to obtain a 
standard of the variables. We choose the most important 
variables that affect the citizen’s patrimony, life, body and 
health. There were also interviews to obtain information, 
opinions and suggestions from the surveillance staff. 
Regarding the data analysis, the most relevant crimes 
and risks were taken into consideration; these are listed in 
Table III. To identify delinquency patterns and trends within 
a specific place, the collected database was analyzed, which 
was spread according to the day of the week (7 days), hour 
range (every 6 hours), the amount of crime events (3 crimes 
or more) and how close these events are between each other 
(50 meters or less). The result of the analysis while 
identifying the pattern showed the places with the highest 
concentration of reported crimes, which, when manually 
grouped in polygons, form the areas with a delinquency 
index. The type of risks occurring in those polygons was 
also identified.

To obtain the areas prone to crime, we first identify the 
crime type level (Table IV), then the risk type level (Table 
V), and finally the crime percentage level that the created 
area contains. The crime type level refers to the occurrence 
degree and the crime priority at national level. The risk type 
level represents the degree it would harm a person while

being near to a risk type, where the highest number is what 
would cause the most harm.

To qualify and visualize the crime level, the following 
concepts were taken into consideration. The crime 
percentage level within an area is the percentage that the 
criminal activities grouping represent compared to the total 
number of crimes that occurred within a day of the week 
and time range in that area. The danger value represents the 
amount of danger that exists in that area, and the danger 
level is the danger category to which each area belongs 
(Table VI). The danger value has been created from the 
International Standards Organization (ISO) 31000 risk 
management concepts, where the risk and type of impact are 
identified [16]. The risk represents the crimes and risks from 
Table III, and the type of impact are the levels in Tables IV 
and V.

The classification in Table VI is related to the ISO 
31000, while the lower and upper limit ranges of the danger 
levels have been determined first by the maximum upper 
limit mean; from there, the areas with values higher than the 
midpoint were divided to be classified as “High” or “Very 
High”. Meanwhile, values lower than the midpoint were 
established with a 2-difference-value interval for “Medium” 
and “Low”, and finally, “Very Low” for values no greater 
than 1.  
Equation (1) determines the danger value:

Each danger level is associated with a color, which can 
be seen when painting each dangerous area in the map of the 
mobile and Web applications (Table VII).

Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) Structure 
 
Aside from the information gathered, an ETL structure 
had to be done to elaborate the database. The data stored in 
the flat files and Web Services is extracted, then the 
transformation of the types of data from the corresponding 
fields takes place, and these are loaded into the database 
tables. For this, the quality of the data collected was verified 
wherever inconsistent terms were found, blank spaces and 
street names written backwards (e.g., Chavez Jorge instead 
of Jorge Chavez). The latter made it difficult to obtain the 
coordinates. To find the address where a crime occurred, it 
was necessary to make a connection with the Google Maps 
API to obtain the latitude and longitude through JSON, 
which were stored as spatial data in the database. The risks 
and crimes were associated to the geographical location 
(latitude and longitude), time, date, type and address where 
it occurred. 
Software Architecture 
The software architecture focuses on Model, View, and 
Controller (MVC), the geolocation services in the Google 
Maps API and the use of a cloud platform for the Web 
Services that the applications consume, as well as the 
PostgreSQL database with a PostGIS extension [17]. Next, 
the logical and physical architecture diagrams are shown. 
Logical Architecture Diagram 
In Figure 2, the logical architecture diagram describes the 
breakdown in the software architecture layer, which goes 
down to the level of the server containing them.

Mobile Application 
In the mobile application for smartphones (Figure 4), the 
users can see the areas with a security index and receive a 
notification when they are in one of them, register their 
emergency contacts, add their favorite places, enter relevant 
personal information that would be used in case they require 
medical assistance (blood type, allergies, medication), and 
report events according to their type. The users can also 
send their information and location automatically when 
requesting assistance through the alarm button. Aside from 
all this, they can view the reports from other users on a wall.

In the smartwatch application (Figure 5), users can see 
the map with a security index and receive a notification 
when they are in one of them, as well as request assistance 
quickly so the command center can obtain their location and 
personal information, and send a SMS to his/her emergency 
contacts.

Web Application 
In the Web application (Figure 6), called Command 
Center, all the notifications that the users have made can be 
seen in real time. This platform is meant for the 
municipality patrols, where they register their security 
members. They are granted access through a Quick 
Response (QR) code generated by the mobile application. 
Inside the application, they can obtain all the information of 
an emergency event, such as the address, map location and 
information of the user who reported this emergency. 
 
 
Figure 6. Web application interface (command center). 
The access to this platform will be only for authorized 
security staff, since it shows the location of all the security 
staff that is on foot or inside a vehicle.

VALIDATION 
For the validation, we performed some tests and a survey 
about the usability, functionality and input from mobile and 
Web applications related to public safety. 
A. Design 
We performed a test to obtain the satisfaction level of 
the citizens from the Santiago de Surco district in Lima, 
Peru. In the first part, each participant would replicate the 
applications functionalities. For the second part, they had to 
answer questions about “Beware” after their experience with 
the application. 
The sample area, in the Santiago de Surco district, was 
from the Primavera Bridge until the Peruvian University of 
Applied Sciences (UPC), from 13:00 to 18:00 hrs. on a 
Monday. Figure 7 shows the dangerous area and its danger 
level within the selected hour range and day of the week. 
Prior to the test, the participants should have installed 
the mobile application “Beware” on their smartphones 
and two of them should have configured and installed it 
on their smartwatches. For the Web application, it was 
only necessary to have access to the URL, and the test 
user name and password.

According to the survey results, in question 3, 90% of 
the participants consider the applications to be “Very 
useful” and “Extremely useful”. Question 4 shows that 77% 
of the participants would frequently report events or 
emergencies. Questions 1 and 2 show how easy is to use the 
applications and that they help them “Much” to identify the 
dangerous areas.  
It can also be observed that for participant P07, who 
lives in the district, the application helps him “Moderately” 
to identify the dangerous areas, while for most who visit the 
area a few days a week it helps them “Much”. 
In summary, it could be concluded that there is a 
favorable 
acceptance

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, a mobile application for smartphones and 
smartwatches was implemented. It displays and notifies 
which are the dangerous zones within a geographical area, 
and allows reporting emergencies and/or events. There is 
also a Web application to receive the emergency alerts from 
the users and manage the security staff who oversee these 
emergencies. 
Public safety requires constant citizen participation since 
there is a lack of reporting in the police stations. Therefore, 
the use of GIS technologies helps to locate the exact place of 
a crime, analyze various factors that influence the reduction 
of citizen insecurity, and detect new places prone to crime. 
Another requirement is that all the criminal information 
should be stored in a single place to avoid losing data, and 
that at the same time it is presented in a friendly and updated 
manner. 
The mobile application “Beware” for smartphones and 
smartwatches, allows citizens to be alert and take the 
necessary measures when entering into an unsafe area, so 
they can avoid becoming victims of a crime against their 
patrimony, life, body and health, as well as to participate in 
the reporting of criminal events that are not documented in 
the police stations, and safeguard their lives by sending an 
emergency report. The “Beware” Command Center allows 
the Municipality to know the crimes that occur during the 
day, detect new areas with a security index, know the 
location of their security staff so they can attend immediately 
to emergency alerts and, from the information gathered, 
create new action plans to reduce citizen insecurity. 
The validation of the usability, functionality and security 
perspective of these applications is through a user experience 
test, which ended with a survey. It showed that the 
applications comply with the functionalities mentioned and 
that are easy to use. Also, the survey showed that the 
application helped to identify new dangerous areas that the 
participants were not aware of despite that they visit the 
place regularly. Thus, 14 out of 15 citizens consider that the 
proposed application is useful and very useful for public 
safety. 
As for future work, we intend to develop an algorithm 
that generates automatically the dangerous areas from spatial 
data. This would decrease their creation and storage time. 
Likewise, we are also interested to use crowdsourcing.
