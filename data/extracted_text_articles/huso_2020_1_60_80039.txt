online media, such as TripAdvisor, to consumers’ decisions 
with several approaches for sentiment analysis. However, 
travelers are also widely affected by online comments posted

proposes a methodology for modelling the role of social media

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Consumers increasingly use online media to search for 
information, compare alternative products and services, and 
make decisions for activities, such as travel planning and 
hotel selection [1][2]. Not surprisingly, high ratings in social 
media have a direct impact on sales [3][4]. Due to the 
experiential nature of travel-related products and their 
instantaneous nature, online reviews have become an 
increasingly popular information source in travel planning 
and have a profound effect on consumers’ buying decisions, 
particularly in hotel booking [5]. According to Travel 
Industry Association of America, the evidence shows that 
64% of travelers use search engines for their travel planning 
[6][7]. 
In this context, social media have gathered the research 
interest as a major form of electronic Word-Of-Mouth 
(eWOM) to prospective travelers facilitating the sharing and 
seeking of experiences [5,8,9,10]. Hotel-related decision-
making has fundamentally changed, as social media are used 
in every stage of the consumers’ decision-making process. 
They play a key role before, during and after the trip [11]. 
Prospective tourists are influenced by social media, as 
content from other travellers can shape, guide and redirect 
their initial decisions [12][13].  
In the business perspective, social media are perceived as 
effective tools and fruitful platforms for deepening customer 
engagement and enhancing customer–business interactions 
[14]. In fact, they have provided a new distribution channel 
for businesses to communicate with their customers [7].  In 
the consumer perspective, consumers use social media for a 
wide spectrum of scenarios, e.g., sharing their travel-related 
experiences, engaging with others, connecting with people 
from different destinations and buying travel-related 
products and services [15][16]. 
Existing literature is rich on research works about the 
influence of travel-oriented 
online media, such as 
TripAdvisor, to consumers’ decisions. However, travelers 
are also widely affected by online comments posted on social 
media, such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. as well as by hotels’ 
marketing campaigns [17]. Therefore, the identification of 
the relationships between the way travelers use social media 
and the criteria for selecting hotels is of outmost importance. 
This paper proposes a methodology for modelling the role of 
social media in hotel selection using Bayesian Networks 
(BN). To the best of our knowledge, despite their 
applicability in a wide range of problems and scenarios, BNs 
have not been used for identifying the influence of social 
media to the decisions of travelers about the hotel selection. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II 
presents the related work on methods and approaches for 
evaluating the effect of online reviews on social media on 
hotel 
booking. 
Section 
III 
describes 
the 
research 
methodology and the proposed approach for modelling the 
role of social media in hotel selection using BNs. Section IV 
presents the results from the adoption of the proposed 
methodology on a dataset of 360 users. Section V concludes 
the paper and outlines our plans for future work.

RELATED WORK 
Online comment has become a popular and efficient way 
for sellers to acquire feedback from customers and improve 
their service quality [18]. These online reviews generate an 
eWOM effect, which influences future customer demand and 
hotels’ financial performance [19]. However, apart from the 
hotels’ websites and official social media pages, prospective 
travelers are increasingly interacting through social media in 
order to gather and share information about hotels and to 
select the one that matches their criteria. To this end, a vast 
33

amount of research has focused on travel-oriented platforms 
and social media, such as TripAdvisor, aiming at 
investigating their influence to hotel booking decisions 
[7][11][14][20][21]. Moreover, such works are conducted 
from a tourism management perspective resulting in the use 
of descriptive statistical methods instead of exploiting the 
advancements of data analytics and machine learning. On the 
other hand, the role of social media such as Facebook and 
Twitter on hotel selection is rarely investigated [8]. 
In [22], the authors examined the effects of traditional 
customer satisfaction relative magnitude and social media 
review ratings on hotel performance and explored which 
online travel intermediaries’ review ratings serve as the most 
reliable and valid predictor for hotel performance. The 
results of this study indicate that social media review rating 
is a more significant predictor than traditional customer 
satisfaction for explaining hotel performance metrics. The 
research work in [23] assessed social media content 
produced by customers and related review-management 
strategies of domestic and international hotel chains with the 
use of descriptive statistics and multilevel regression.  
In [11], the authors proposed the use of multi-criteria 
ratings provided by the travelers in social media networking 
sites for developing a new recommender system for hotel 
recommendations in e-tourism platforms. Reference [3] 
applied multilevel regression analysis in order to quantify the 
extent to which differences in client satisfaction with hotels 
can be attributed to the destination in which the hotels are 
located. They measured this through ratings provided 
through social media outlets. In [24], the authors also 
investigated the influence of social media on destination 
choice. In [5], the presented work is based upon homophily 
and similarity-attraction theory in order to prove that review 
valence significantly affects hotel booking intention, and that 
reader-reviewer demographic similarity moderates this 
effect. This three-way interaction reveals a substituting 
moderation effect between demographic similarity and 
preference similarity.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In [12], the authors explored how social media influence 
the way consumers search, evaluate and select a hotel within 
the ‘evaluation stage’ of the wider hotel decision-making 
process, i.e., in the pre-travel stage during which social 
media unfold their most critical role. In [6], the authors 
examined tourists' knowledge sharing behavior in social 
media for two different types of social media: Facebook and 
TripAdvisor. They proposed a structural model that connects 
homophily and knowledge sharing through posting. Finally, 
the research work in [13] investigated the influencing role of 
social media in the consumer’s hotel decision-making 
process and identified the advantages and disadvantages. 
They concluded that the advantages of utilizing social media 
in hotel selection outperform the disadvantages.

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
A. Data Collection and Structuring 
The data was collected in the form of a questionnaire 
completed by 360 social media users. The questions lay on 
three categories: generic questions, questions related to the 
reasons of searching information on social media, and 
questions related to the criteria according to which the users 
select a hotel for vacation. The first category of questions 
was in the form of multiple choice, while the last two were in 
the form of Likert scale. 
B. Modelling the Relationships between Social Media and 
Hotel Selection Criteria Using Bayesian Networks 
In order to model the relationships between the reasons 
of searching information on social media and the criteria 
according to which the users select a hotel for vacation, we 
applied BNs. A Bayesian Network (BN) [25], also known as 
belief network, is defined as a pair B = (G, Θ). G = (V, E) is 
a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where V = {v1, …, vn} is a 
collection of n nodes, E ⸦ V × V a collection of edges and a 
set of parameters Θ containing all the Conditional 
Probabilities (CP) of the network.

       Each node v ϵ V of the graph represents a random 
variable XV with a state space XV which can be either discrete 
or continuous. An edge (vi, vj) ϵ E represents the conditional 
dependence between two nodes vi, vj ϵ V where vi is the 
parent of child vj. If two nodes are not connected by an edge, 
they are conditional independent. Because a node can have 
more than one parent, let πv the set of parents for a node v ϵ 
V.  
      Therefore each random variable is independent of all 
nodes V \ πv. For each node, a Conditional Probability Table 
(CPT) contains the CP distribution with parameters θxi|πi 
:=P(xi|πi) ϵ Θ for each realization xi of Xi conditioned on πi. 
The joint probability distribution over V is visualized by the 
BN and can be defined as  
 
 
 
(1) 
 
With BN, inference for what-if analysis can be 
supported, either top-down (predictive support) or bottom-up 
(diagnostic support). If a random variable which is 
represented by a node is observed, the node is called an 
evidence node; otherwise, it is a hidden node [26]. Based on 
the categories of the questions included in the questionnaire, 
a BN with three layers was developed, as shown in Figure 1. 
The nodes per each layer of the BN are presented in Table I.  
The top layer of the BN includes 4 nodes related to 
generic information (A1-A4). These nodes along with their 
alternative values are: the respondent’s age group = {15-20, 
21-25, 26-30, 31-35, 36-40, 41-45, 46-50, >50), the 
frequency of vacations = {once per 2 years, once per year, 
twice per year, three times per year, more than three times 
per year}, the frequency of staying at hotel in vacations = 
{always, very often, often, rarely, never}, and the frequency 
of using social media for hotel information = {always, very 
often, often, rarely, never}.  
The intermediate layer includes nodes related the reasons 
of searching information on social media in general and 
consists of 9 nodes (R1-R9). In other words, it indicates the 
behaviour and the attitude of the users with respect to the use 
of social media.  
The bottom layer includes nodes related to the criteria 
according to which the users select a hotel for vacation and 
consists of 14 nodes (C1-C16). Their candidate values are 
{Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly 
Disagree}.  
Based upon this structure, the BN is subject to reasoning 
in order to compute all the CPTs. The BN was constructed in 
a way that all the nodes of the intermediate and the bottom 
layer are potentially affected by all the nodes of the top and 
the intermediate layer respectively. Therefore, the CPTs are 
calculated accordingly.  
The outcome of the proposed methodology indicates the 
probability assigned to each selection criterion (bottom 
layer) given the reasons a user searches for information in 
social media (intermediate layer) and some generic 
information (top layer).

Therefore, the model can answer questions such as: 
“What is the probability that a user will select a hotel 
according to the criteria of the reliable booking procedure

(C2) and the cleanliness (C6) given that he/she uses the 
social media for socializing (R4) (referring to node values 
“Strongly Agree” and “Agree”) and for receiving better 
quality of responses (R7), while he/she belongs to the age 
group 31-35 (A1), he/she goes for vacations once per year 
(A2), he/she stays at a hotel often (A3) and he/she often uses 
social media for hotel information (A4)?”. In order to answer 
such questions, the model computes all the CPTs for all its 
nodes and for all their alternative values. 
The model is able to identify, represent and store in the 
database complex relationships aiming at supporting 
marketing and hotel operations in response to different 
customers’ profiles. Upon request, the model can compute 
the CPTs of every possible relationship based upon the 
resulting CPT in order to provide insights on the hotel 
selection criteria. In this way, the hotels can focus on specific 
target groups according to their strengths as well as to 
improve their operations that result in lower rating of certain 
criteria. Moreover, it is able to serve as a model for 
predicting the criteria according to which a social media user 
will select a hotel among various alternatives. The model is 
extensible to additional nodes per each layer in case more 
information needs to be incorporated. 
IV. 
RESULTS 
The proposed approach was applied on a dataset of 360 
social media users. The implementation and execution of the 
experiments were performed using the BN functionalities of 
the pgmpy (Probabilistic Graphical Models using Python) 
package in Python [27]. We developed the associated BN 
and we calculated the CPTs for all the nodes.  
Table II presents the criteria (Ci) and their associated 
values with the highest CPs, given the values of the reasons 
of searching information in social media (Ri) and the generic 
information (Ai). Table III presents the criteria (Ci) and their 
associated values with the lowest CPs, given the values of 
the reasons of searching information in social media (Ri) and 
the generic information (Ai).  
For this specific analysis, we have grouped the values 
Strongly Agree and Agree in order to identify the most 
probable criteria in the first columns of the aforementioned 
Tables. The results show that the criterion C6 given the 
values of the Ri and Ai nodes that are shown in the first row 
of Table II is the one with the highest CP, which is equal to 
39.5%. The criterion C15 given the values of the Ri and Ai 
nodes that are shown in the first row of Table III is the one 
with the lowest CP, which is equal to 1.2%.  
Based upon these results, the hotels are able to identify 
the most important criteria according to which a social media 
user selects a hotel given some generic information, such as 
the age group, the frequency of vacations, etc., and their 
attitude towards the use of social media for searching 
information. In this way, the hotels may design more 
specialized marketing strategies, e.g., focusing on specific 
target groups, and to improve their operations in order to 
achieve higher service quality and increased customer 
satisfaction with respect to certain criteria.

As already mentioned, the model can also serve as a 
classifier for predicting the class attribute of criteria (Ci) as 
soon as new records of Ri and Ai are inserted into the 
database. In order to evaluate its classification effectiveness, 
we inserted additional records, derived from more 
questionnaires addressed to social media users, and we 
created the confusion matrix according to Table IV in order 
to estimate the precision and the recall of the classifier using 
the (2) and (3) [28].

The Precision results are quite satisfactory, while the 
Recall results can be further improved. The BN model sticks 
to the initially identified relationships, i.e., the ones that have 
been mined during the model training. Therefore, when new 
relationships, not previously identified, are added, they are 
not classified correctly. These records include values that are 
not frequent (e.g., A1={>50} and A4={always}), so they are 
not critical for decision making.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
Consumers increasingly use social media to search for 
information, compare alternative products and services, and 
make decisions for activities such as travel planning and 
hotel selection. In this context, social media have gathered 
the research interest as a major form of eWOM to 
prospective travelers. In this paper, we proposed a BN model 
for modelling the role of social media in hotel selection. 
More 
specifically, 
we 
developed 
a 
3-layered 
BN 
corresponding to generic information, reasons for searching 
information to social media, and criteria for hotel selection 
respectively. In this way, the model is able to mine 
relationships and to compute the CPTs in order to reveal 
meaningful insights and predictions about the criteria of 
hotel selection given the use of social media and other 
information.  
The BN model was applied to a dataset of 360 social 
media users, derived from an associated questionnaire. 
According to the defined BN structure, all the CPTs were 
computed. We presented indicative examples of the 
outcome, i.e., the criteria with the highest and the lowest 
CPs. We also validated the model in terms of its precision 
and recall in predicting the most important hotel selection 
criteria when new records are inserted into the database. 
Regarding our future work, we plan to use more data 
analytics and machine learning methods and algorithms in 
order to mine hidden relationships among various attributes.

Moreover, we aim to use fuzzy pattern matching methods for 
mining also online review comments, as well as clustering 
and fuzzy sets qualitative analytics algorithms for extracting 
user profiling insights of hotel customers. These directions 
have the potential to further enhance decision making 
process in hotel management from both a marketing (e.g., 
revealing key groups of customers and target groups) and an 
operations management (e.g., for improving service quality if
