Abstract— Telemedicine comes in many shapes. It aims to 
offer many benefits to both patients and clinicians, but until 
today, it is not widely utilized. This study aims to investigate 
public willingness to use telemedicine service, and identify 
cases/situations it is preferred to use for. It also identifies 
community views to increase actual use of telemedicine. To 
achieve our goals, 84 participants in the age ranging from 20 to 
64 years were randomly selected, and data were collected from 
them using a questionnaire. The survey results reveals that all 
participants had never experienced telemedicine despite 
COVID-19 state of emergency. Less than half (46%) of 
participants stated their willingness to use the current 
telemedicine service. About 77% of participants preferred to 
use telemedicine service in a state of a personal emergency 
“with mild illness”. This study also indicates two approaches to 
promote telemedicine utilization. First approach aims to 
expand the scope of telemedicine, so that encompasses various 
issues/conditions, which currently concern the community. 
Second one focuses on improving a telemedicine platform 
through 6 actions relevant to the service usability, availability, 
value, and accessibility. At present, there are many issues 
impact on telemedicine growth in Japan. Learning about the 
community’s views and needs play an important role in 
increasing the use of telemedicine service.

 INTRODUCTION  
    Telemedicine provides healthcare services when patients 
and healthcare providers are at different locations using 
Information and Communication Technologies [1]. Since 
2018, telemedicine has been covered by Japanese insurance, 
but the incentive to promote telemedicine is weaker than 
that of other countries partially due to free access to medical 
institutions and other issues [2]. In April 2020, the COVID-
19 crisis has prompted Japan to ease regulations on 
telemedicine [3]. However, the use of deregulated 
telemedicine has been sluggish compared to the US and UK. 
In Japan, only 15% of medical institutions have deployed 
telephone or online consultations [4]. Therefore, this study 
investigates public willingness to use current telemedicine 
services. Furthermore, it identifies community perspectives 
and needs to develop telemedicine program and increase the 
rate of its usage. The rest of this paper is organized as 
follows. Section II explains the method of this study. 
Section III shows the major results of the survey. Section IV 
includes discussion and limitation of a study. Section V 
includes conclusion. 
II. 
METHOD  
    To achieve our goals, a semi-structured questionnaire (9 
multiple-choice questions) was undertaken with 84 
participants (63 Female and 21 male) between February and 
April 2021. Selecting the survey participants was based on 
their busy works with limited vacations time (about 10 days 
in a year) to visit hospitals. Participants were provided with 
an explanation of telemedicine and all information regarding 
the study, including the reasons for undertaking the survey. 
The questionnaire sheets had been given to the person in 
charge of the department by hand in order to distribute it to 
all the employees. Based on the literature review [5] [6], the 
questionnaire was designed, and then piloted on 5 
individuals. From the responses of 5 people, the questions 
were revised and determined. Probing questions were used 
to determine the best patterns and circumstances for making 
telemedicine services more usable and efficient. Ethical 
approval for this study was obtained from the Kyushu 
University Hospital, permission no 2021-15.  
III. 
RESULT 
    A total of 84 administrative employees of which female 
(63) and male (21) completed the questionnaire. The 
following are the main results of the questionnaire.   
A. The Characteristic of Participants 
     The participants’ ages are ranging from 20 to 64 years. 
They are administrative employees working (full-time job) 
in different business sectors at 2 public universities in the 
Fukuoka city. The results of this survey indicated that all 
participants have no physical disabilities, and are not 
telemedicine users. Fifty-nine (70%) of them are somewhat 
aware of telemedicine. The majority (29%) visit the 
hospitals about 2 times a year (Table 1). 
B. Opinions Towards the Use of Telemedicine Service  
    The participants were asked about their willingness to use 
telemedicine service (see Figure 1). Less than half (46%) of 
participants answered with “yes”. About 37 (44%) of 
participants chose “I’m not sure”, and 8 (10%) of them

responded with “no”.  Regarding the situations/cases which 
the participants may use a telemedicine for, 65 (77%) of 
them would prefer to use the service in the state of a 
personal emergency “mild illness”, while 30 (36%)  
participants might use the service when it is imposed by 
policies or other means. Twenty-five (30%) participants 
answered that when a hospital is far from home, while 15 
(18%) participants responded that it might happen for 
prescription renewals and chronic care management. A few 
(7%) participants indicated that in all cases, they will not 
use telemedicine, and 3 (4%) participants chose “other”. 
C. Expanding the Scope of Telemedicine  
     The participants were asked about their issues/concerns, 
which could be well addressed through online care services 
(see Figure 2). The majority (62%) of participants indicated 
that telemedicine is a good tool for virtual visits to 
inpatients by their loved ones and/or conducting remote 
follow-up meetings with the family members who are 
unable to be with their hospitalized patients. Forty-two 
(50%) participants stated that telemedicine could be 
effectively used for following up care, including post-
operative follow up, while 39 (46%) participants mentioned 
that the service is a suitable way to educate people about 
lifestyle diseases. Twenty - two (26%) participants indicated 
that telemedicine can be used for patients on board (such as 
emergency medical care on the express train or at the sea by 
providing medical advice for the passengers on board ships), 
while 19 (23%) participants stated their needs to school-
based telemedicine program for providing access to high-
quality healthcare in the school setting. A few (12%) 
participants mentioned the need to use telemedicine for birth 
control counselling. Eight (10%) participants chose “other”. 
D. Actions to Improve a Telemedicine Platform 
    All participants were asked about their needs, views and 
suggestions to improve a telemedicine platform (see Figure 
3). The majority (49%) indicated the importance of creating 
a user-friendly telemedicine program. Twenty-four (29%) 
participants suggested to provide telemedicine in higher  
number of hospitals and be for all, while 21 (25%) 
 
 
 
 
participants requested to make the service available at any  
time “24 hours a day, and 7 days a week”. Twenty (24%) 
participants indicated the necessity to offer many value-
added programs to telemedicine patients as a part of their 
wellness programs, while 18 (21%) participants requested to 
make the services easy to access without having Internet 
connection problems. 
About 
17 
(20%) 
participants 
responded that telemedicine must consider desires and needs 
by age demographic. Ten participants (12%) chose “other”, 
such as recommended that telemedicine be held to the same 
standards of in-person care, and establish unique patient 
engagement strategy that focuses on creating greater 
awareness of telemedicine’s potential and its usage.  
E. Usability in a Telemedicine Meeting 
    Regarding the most suitable and trustful healthcare 
delivery model (see Figure 4), the survey results revealed 
that the majority (74%) of participants preferred home-
based telemedicine, while 12 (14%) participants chose 
mobile medical clinic, and a few (12%) participants selected 
the hospital-based telemedicine. Regarding the better mode 
for communication, we found that the majority (73%) of 
participants 
preferred 
video 
call, 
while 
17 
(20%) 
participants chose voice call, and a few (7%) participants 
selected “other”.  About the most adequate device for a 
telemedicine visit, the majority (38%) preferred smartphone 
“using a video call service”, while 30 (36%) participants 
chose PC/tablet, about 24% of participants preferred 
smartphone “a voice call only”, and a few (2%) of them 
chose “other”.  
IV. 
 DISCUSSION 
    Telemedicine services have the advantage of ensuring the 
health of inaccessible local residents and increasing 
convenience [7] [8]. Studies have shown that remote 
monitoring approaches are as effective as – and in some 
cases better than – in-person care for many chronic 
conditions [9] [10]. However, all participants were not 
telemedicine users, even in a state of public health 
emergency due to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.

    Further, less than half (46%) of them stated their 
willingness to use the telemedicine service. In Japan there is 
a strong cultural bias towards face-to-face consultation, but 
the servicing rural and remote areas by doctors is 
increasingly difficult so there is an urgent need to increase 
the uptake of telemedicine [2]. In terms of telemedicine 
growth and development, studies reported that the service 
should deliver care that respects the patients’ preferences and 
values - responds to needs in a person-centered manner [11] 
[12]. Based on the participants’ responses, there are two 
approaches to potentially increase the use of telemedicine in 
Japan. First one aims to expand telemedicine capabilities. 
This is by identifying community issues and concerns that 
can be addressed through online care services. In other 
words, it is better going beyond traditional home diagnostic 
and monitoring activities to include further medical care 
forms where the individuals’ abilities are restricted. The 
survey results revealed that most (62%) participants 
indicated that telemedicine is a good tool for virtual visits to 
inpatients by their loved ones and/or conducting remote 
follow-up meetings with the family members who are unable 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to be with their patients at hospitals. In our previous study 
the same suggestion had been stated by the majority of 
Japanese physicians [13]. The second approach is about 
understanding people’s requirements, preferences and views 
to improve a telemedicine platform. From the participants’ 
responses, there are 6 key actions suggested to higher use of 
a telemedicine program. Regarding the first action, the 
majority 
(49%) 
stated 
the 
importance 
of 
creating 
telemedicine equipment as user- friendly as possible. The 
usability issue is one of the seven core principles that 
underlie the development of successful telemedicine 
systems [14]. Furthermore, to make a telemedicine easier 
and safer, be mindful of the importance of site in which 
virtual encounters occur [11]. The survey results indicated 
that most participants preferred to conduct a telemedicine 
appointment at home by using video call over the 
smartphone. Similar findings showed in another survey that 
the majority of Japanese participants preferred video call 
with supplementary text message as a communication tool 
used for telemedicine [15]. On the other hand, studies 
pointed out that home-based telemedicine system via video

conference can be of great benefit to patients in terms of 
convenience, reliability, health care availability, and cost 
savings. However, there are some issues affecting the 
efficiency of this system and should be well considered and 
addressed, such as privacy and security concerns, patient 
age, patient and healthcare professional's capabilities to use 
digital technology, Internet speed, network signal, audio 
quality, and technological compatibility [16] [17] [18]. In 
addition, a recent study indicated the necessity of the apps 
being easy to use for patients and staff, providing smooth 
access to important functions [19]. Regarding this point, 
further study stated that a user-friendly device which is easy 
to use by patients with low digital literacy is helpful, and a 
system allows medical personnel to remotely control the 
equipment could be an option [10]. Second action, 24 (29%) 
participants suggested providing the telemedicine services 
in the greater number of hospitals/clinics. In Japan, there is 
a slow spread of telemedicine in the hospitals. A high 
percentage of hospitals are not offering the service due to 
many issues, such as the lack of infrastructure and 
uncertainty about reimbursement [20].  A study reported 
that among the 110,898 medical institutions that exist, the 
number of medical institutions implementing telemedicine 
increased slightly from 10,812 (9.7%) in April 2020 to 
16,202 (14.6%) in June. Of this number, only 6,801 (6.1%) 
medical institutions implement telemedicine for a patient’s 
first visit [21]. The third action is about the service 
availability seven days a week. The current study findings 
showed that twenty-one (25%) participants requested to 
offer telemedicine services for patients at any time, day or 
night. This might be because there are sometimes 
difficulties to find an appropriate major hospital/clinic to 
visit in case of an emergency in Japan [22] [23]. 
Confirmation on that, 65 (77%) participants would prefer to 
use telemedicine services in a state of a personal emergency. 
Regarding the fourth action, 20 (24%) participants 
recommended offering many value-added programs to the 
telemedicine patients as a part of their wellness programs. 
The fifth action, 18 (21%) participants clarified the 
importance of fast Internet speed for transmitting patients’ 
files, records, pictures, and videos. A study reported that 18 
factors inhibit the dissemination of telemedicine service in 
Japan, including network speed [24]. Most of the 
telemedicine applications require a high speed and reliable 
Internet bandwidth to run smoothly. Unreliable and low 
wideband Internet pose barriers in smooth delivery of 
telemedicine service [25]. Last action, 17 (20%) participants 
stated the necessity of considering telemedicine desires by 
age demographic because not all generations have same 
requirements towards telemedicine. A study reported that 
age plays a large role in consumer healthcare trends and 
telemedicine usage. Understanding consumer telemedicine 
trends by age group may be the key to increasing awareness 
and the use of telemedicine [26]. Based on the mentioned 
above, it can be said that telemedicine success and growth 
begin with the individuals’ satisfaction. Patients will start 
demanding more use of telemedicine that is when the 
service satisfies their needs and expectations. 
     Regarding the limitation of this study, the survey was 
conducted with limited number of Japanese participants. 
The results cannot be generalized beyond the participants of 
a study. The participants expressed their own perspectives to 
develop the current telemedicine platform, and these may 
not express views of the majority of Japanese people. 
V.      CONCLUSION  
     At present, telemedicine plays an important role to help 
individuals avoid direct physical contact and thus reduces 
the risk of COVID transmission. This study discussed 
public willingness to use a telemedicine program, and in 
what situations/cases it is preferable to use for. It also 
identified two approaches to promote the use of 
telemedicine program in Japan. The first approach aims to 
expand the scope of telemedicine, so as to address many 
issues which concern the society. Regarding the second 
approach, it focuses on developing a telemedicine program 
by understanding the public’s views and needs. Based on 
the participants’ feedback, this study pointed out that 6 
actions can improve a telemedicine platform, and possibly 
raise the rate of its usage. The key actions are concerning 
telemedicine usability, availability, value, and accessibility.      
     Overall, the growth of telemedicine requires fully 
understanding of the individuals’ needs. Therefore, 
additional studies are needed to explore the demands and 
perspectives of different groups of people, including elderly 
and people with disabilities.
