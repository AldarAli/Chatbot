Abstract—The
World
Health
Organization
Framework
Convention
on
Tobacco
Control
(WHO
FCTC)
has
effectively
controlled
tobacco
use
worldwide,
and
its
successful experience could be drawn to control obesity,
which poses increasing dangers to people’s health globally.
Although the policies and regulations included in the WHO
FCTC
could
not
be
adapted
for
controlling
obesity
wholesale, the WHO FCTC can indeed constitute a model to
constrain the market availability of unhealthful foods and
beverages for obesity control. The key measures suggested
by
the
WHO
FCTC,
which
are
economic
approach,
educational strategies, labeling measure, restrictions on
marketing as well as clinical intervention, can be applied to
restrain the market availability of unhealthful foods in
order to control obesity. However, the issue of obesity
control is more complicated than tobacco control, since not
all the foods are lethal, and the food companies are much
more powerful than tobacco companies. Governments and
organizations should cooperate globally and closely, and
apply those measures comprehensively to create synergy in
order to better control obesity. Though the potential model
for obesity control may face some challenges such as the
difficulty
of
implementation
and
obstruction
of
food
industry, it has already made some achievements at current
stage, for example, the WHO Global Strategy on Diet,
Physical Activity and Health has been endorsed, which
indicates that the future of the model for obesity control will
possibly be bright.

I.INTRODUCTION
The World Health Organization Framework Convention
on
Tobacco
Control
(WHO
FCTC)
has
enjoyed
tremendous success in restraining the market availability
of tobacco product, which is a lethal commodity and is
responsible for millions of deaths every year. It is
suggested that the model, seminal ideas and key measures
of WHO FCTC can be used to inform the policy-making
to restrain the market availability of unhealthful foods
and beverage in order to effectively control obesity,
which
poses
increasing
dangers
to
people's
health
globally. To explore whether the model of the WHO
FCTC can be applied in obesity control, this paper firstly
examines the achievements of the WHO FCTC in
controlling
tobacco
use;
secondly,
it
discusses
the
differences and similarities between tobacco and obesity
control; thirdly, it introduces the key measures which are
included in WHO FCTC and could be used in obesity
control;
fourthly,
it
discusses
the
challenges
and
achievements of the potential model for obesity control;
and finally it will come to a conclusion that although
there are differences between tobacco and obesity control,
and the policies could not be adapted in the movement of
obesity control wholesale, the WHO FCTC could indeed
constitute a model to constrain the market availability of
unhealthful foods and beverages for obesity control.
II. THE ACHIVEMENT OF THE WHO FCTC
The WHO FCTC is believed to have successfully
restrained the market availability of tobacco products. As
the
global
health
interdependence
accelerates,
the
governments and international organizations recognize
the necessity for cooperation to solve essential public
health problems, such as the non-communicable diseases,
among which tobacco is one of the most serious culprits.
Numerous scientific evidences have shown that tobacco
products are responsible for nearly six million people's
deaths every year, which accounting for about 10% of all
deaths worldwide (1). Both the WHO and its member
states have political will to fight against the harm caused
by tobacco products, and the WHO FCTC is the
achievement of their long-period negotiation. The WHO
FCTC, which entered into force in 2005, “has enjoyed
tremendous global success, with more than 170 Parties,
and is often called the most powerful tool in the fight
against tobacco related morbidity and mortality” (1,
p.847).

The WHO FCTC raises the states’ and international
organizations’ awareness of the benefits of using legal
instruments to achieve public health goals (1). The
achievements of the WHO FCTC have led to calls to
translate its successes to other global public health issues,
particularly to the non-communicable diseases factors,
such as the issue of obesity, which poses increasing
dangers to people's health globally (1).
III. DIFFERENCES AND SIMILARITIES BETWEEN
TOBACCO AND OBESITY CONTROL
Although the history of the epidemic of obesity and
obesity-related diseases is comparatively short, obesity
can exert negative impact on people’s health to a large
degree. It is one of the most blatantly global public health
problems at the current stage. Obesity is not only a
medical disorder, but also a harbinger of other diseases,
such
as
cardiovascular
disease,
type
2
diabetes,
obstructive sleep apnea, osteoarthritis, and several types
of cancer (2). It is one of the most important risk factors
contributing to the overall burden of disease and one of
the most serious public health problems of the 21st
century (3). More than one –third of American children
born in 2000 are expected to suffer from diabetes
sometimes
in
their
lives,
largely
due
to
expected
overweight or obesity (4). Besides, the mortality and
health care costs of obesity-related diseases in the United
States may possibly surpass those of tobacco-related
diseases in recent years (4). Therefore, a series of
measures and policies should be implemented to fight
against obesity. Figure 1 makes a sketch of “globesity”—
the escalating global epidemic of obesity problems.
Figure 1. The obesity rate of the chosen countries in 2000 and 2010.
Adapted from the OECD Fact Book 2013 (5).
It is argued that the approaches for obesity control must
be different from tobacco control. Tobacco product is not
necessaries for most people, and is a lethal commodity for
a much higher proportion of its users (6). While the
obesity issue, which is related to food and physical
activity, is much more complicated than tobacco issue.
Specifically and in direct contrast with tobacco, both
appropriate food and physical activity are essential to life
and must available to all people, and only the improperly
intake of food and the physical activity levels that do not
match energy intake could result in obesity, if regardless
of the genetic factor (1). Therefore, due to the inherent
challenges, it is suggested that the WHO FCTC cannot
constitutes a model in controlling obesity.
However, the obesity issue has numerous similarities with
tobacco
issue.
Firstly,
some
overweight
or
obese
individuals struggle with similar compulsive tendencies
as smokers by eating food for gratification beyond their
nutritional
requirement;
besides,
and
overweight
individuals as well as smokers are affected by social
influences and advertising pressures to consume much
more (8). Moreover, the profit-pursuing multinational
companies in both tobacco and food area play an
important role, which is obstructive and negative in most
times, in the tobacco control as well as obesity control (4).
Those similarities suggest that there may possibly be
overlap between the points involved in the control of
obesity as well as tobacco, and the successful experience
of the WHO FCTC can be drawn for obesity control.
Therefore, both differences and similarities exist between
the issue of tobacco and obesity. The WHO FCTC can be
used for reference in constituting the model to control
obesity. At the same time, when drawing lessons from the
success of the WHO FCTC for the efforts to control
obesity,
governments
and
international
organizations
should consider more about the nuanced difference.
IV. A MODEL FOR OBESITY CONTROL
The key issues to control obesity are to regulate the
policy in the food area as well as to encourage people to
do more physical activities, in which the former issue is
comparatively more important and complicated.
“The
template of the WHO FCTC can be used to consider the
components potentially useful to the development of
national diet and nutrition policies” (6, p.276). This part
generally introduces the key measures and provisions
included in the WHO FCTC and discuss their potential
82

GLOBAL HEALTH 2014 : The Third International Conference on Global Health Challenges

application to obesity control, in particular to the area of
food. The keys measures include: price and tax measures;
educational strategies; labelling requirements; restrictions
on
advertising,
sponsorship
and
promotion;
clinical
interventions.
A. Price and tax measures
The FCTC uses the price and tax measure, which is a key
approach, to reduce tobacco consumption. Economic
theory suggests that the demand for a product will decline
as its price increases, and adolescents
as well as
individuals
in
low-and-middle-income
countries
are
particularly sensitive to the increasing prices (7). That
theory can be applied in the tobacco control. The Article
6 of the WHO FCTC (8, p.7) points out that the “price
and tax measures are an effective and important means of
reducing tobacco consumption by various segments of the
population, in particular young persons”. In other words,
raising the tax of tobacco product is a very effective way
to decrease the affordability of cigarettes and to reduce
people’s demand and the behaviour to purchase cigarettes,
especially for those youngsters and adolescents that are
comparatively sensible to the price change (7). It is
estimated that a 10% increase in the price of tobacco
products will lead to a 3-5% and 6-10% decline in overall
consumption
in
high-income
countries
and
low-and-middle-income countries respectively (9).
The price and tax measures can be used in the food area
for obesity control. The governments could raise the taxes
on the processed food, snack and beverage while do not
raise taxes on or even subsidize fruit and vegetable, so
that the fruit and vegetable are more affordable (10).
Besides, it has been suggested that taxes on low-nutrient
foods could be used to reduce the consumption of them as
well
as
fund
health
promotion
programmes
(11).
Therefore, economic forces can clearly affect food
choices and consumption patterns, and deserved to be
used by the governments in the food area for obesity
control.
Numerous studies have already supported the positive
effect of the price and tax measures on obesity control
with solid data or evidence to a considerable degree. For
instance, to exercise or increase 10% tax for all of the
cheese and butter products, sugar and fat products, as
well as ready-made meals could decrease the body weight
by 1.3kg per year in France (12); to exercise or increase
20% tax on the solely salty snack food could decrease the
body weight by up to 0.17kg per year in the United States
(13); to exercise or increased 10% tax on solely sugared
soft drink could result in a drop in body weight by up to
1.4 kg per year in the United States (14); to increase the
price of meat, butter and fact by 5% and the tax on fat,
saturated fat and sugar by 15% could result in 8%
decrease of saturated fat consumption fat and 16%
decrease of sugar consumption in Denmark (15); to
increase the price of the fats and oils by 24% could
decrease 17.5% of energy consumption as well as 20% of
the fat consumption in Scotland (16).
Figure 2a
Figure 2b
Figure 2. The general trend in the relationship between the the increase
in price or tax on food and drinks causing obesity per year (the bottom
lines) and the decrease in the consumption (2a) as well as the decrease
in body weight per year (2b). Adapted from the studies of Cash et al
(12), Kuchler (13,14), Smed et al (15), Santarossa and Mainland (16).
However, the issues of price and taxation need to be
considered much more cautiously in the food area, which
is essential to life. Firstly, the price elasticity of processed
foods which is of low nutrient value is not clear (10).
Secondly, the low income groups are possible to be
83
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2014.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-359-9
GLOBAL HEALTH 2014 : The Third International Conference on Global Health Challenges

greatly impacted by the taxes on processed foods. Those
groups
of
people
are
likely
to
buy
the
food
of
comparatively low price, which includes the so called
“junk food” or the food of low nutrient value, so if the
price of such kinds of food increases, then those people’s
life could possibly be impacted. Thirdly, it is argued that
the taxation of certain foods may not sufficiently viable to
tackle the problems of diet and nutrition, and it needs
more research to assess the impact of the price and tax
policies. Therefore, the price and tax policies for the
obesity
control
are
rather
complex
and
should
be
considered prudently by the governments or the World
Health Organization.
B. Educational strategies
The FCTC uses education campaigns to raise people’s
awareness of health risks and to reduce the consumption
of tobacco products. The Article 12 of the WHO FCTC
stresses
the
importance
of
health
education,
communication,
training
and
public
awareness.
It
suggested that health education campaigns which contain
a range of public-determined messages can promote the
public awareness of health risks of tobacco use, and of
the benefit of tobacco-free lifestyle (10). Once people
receive the correct knowledge and alter their minds, they
would possibly change their behaviors too. Therefore, a
large number of people have been influenced by the
health education campaigns to different degrees, and
some of them decide to quit or not to start smoking.
Education campaigns can also be used in obesity control
and would probably exert great influence. Education
campaigns can be spread in schools, workplaces and
public sites, and then most students and adults could
understand the correct knowledge and information about
healthy food and physical activity in avoid being obese
(7). For the people who have already been obese,
education campaigns could inform them of how to eat
healthily and do physical exercise effectively to lose
weight. The education campaign can be taken in various
forms, such as posters, lectures, media programs and
public service advertisements.
However, education campaigns may not achieved desired
effect in the absence of external support. According to the
study of King (17), education campaigns have relatively
limited impact on the general public when being carried
out without other interventions. For example, if the price
of fruit and vegetable are comparatively higher than that
of the food of low nutrient value, people may still prefer
to purchase the latter one, even if they know the former
one is much healthier. Therefore, the government, food
industries along with the NGOs should cooperate jointly
to ensure that not only the health knowledge and
information are properly and effectively delivered to the
general public, but also the healthy choices become easy
choices (10).
C. Labeling requirements
The regulations on packaging and labeling of tobacco
products are also a method of the WHO FCTC to reduce
the consumption of cigarettes. Many tobacco companies
use deceptive descriptions such as “mild”, “light”, and
“low tar” on their products’ labels and packages to
mislead people, and use some lovely and charming
pictures which may create erroneous impression on the
cigarette cases to attract people to purchase. To deal with
the problem, the Article 11 of the WHO FCTC (8, p.9)
states that the packaging and labeling of tobacco product
should not “promote a tobacco product by any means that
are false, misleading, deceptive or likely to create an
erroneous impression about its characteristics, health
effects, hazards or emissions”. This measure is believed
to be rather effective and to achieve desired effect in
some countries.
The labels and packages of food can also be misleading
by using the confusing health claims, and need to be
strictly regulated and reformed. It is argued that the
nutrition labeling can always be difficult for the public to
understand, and it lacks unified nutrition labeling and
health claims both internationally or regionally (10). To
tackle with this problem, Codex Alimentarius, the Food
and
Agriculture
Organization
and
World
Health
Organization
international
food
code,
has
been
developing guidelines on health claims to supplement the
General Guidelines on Claims and Guidelines for Use of
Nutrition Claims; in which the former one establishes
general principles to ensure that no food and drink is
presented
in
a
approach
which
is
misleading
and
deceptive, and the latter one defines the health, nutrient
content and nutrient comparative claims (18). People
would eat food comparatively rationally and properly if
84
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2014.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-359-9
GLOBAL HEALTH 2014 : The Third International Conference on Global Health Challenges

the packaging and labeling of foods comply with those
guidelines and the science- supported criteria for health
claims. In other words, the consumer purchase behaviors
would be affected significantly by nutrient labeling (7).
However, the labeling measures may exert little influence
on consumer’s choices of foods and drinks in some
conditions. Foods are not like tobacco products and have
different tastes; sometimes people like to eat some foods
for just for their taste rather than nutrients. Therefore, it is
argued that if substitution effect is large, the consumption
of less healthful foods may not be changed by nutrient
labeling (7).
D. Restriction on advertising, sponsorship and promotion
To enforce restriction on various forms of promotion is
another strong measure of the WHO FCTC. The Article
13 of the WHO FCTC (8, p.11) requires all the Parties
“undertake
a
comprehensive
ban
of
all
tobacco
advertising, promotion and sponsorship” to reduce the
consumption of tobacco products. Before the WHO
FCTC came into being, to raise the awareness and
visibility of products in order to gain as much profit as
possible, many tobacco companies invest a lot into
advertising and promotion, and sponsor some public
games
and
events
(19).
The
FCTC’s
restriction,
preferably a complete ban, on all forms of advertising and
promotion have been supported by governments in many
member states of the WHO, and have reduced the tobacco
companies’ influence on the general public to a certain
degree (20).
Similarly, the advertising, sponsorship and promotion of
some kinds of food should also be restricted in order to
control obesity. Some food advertising, which includes
the snacks, soft drink and fast food advertisements, can
directly exert impact on the general public, especially the
children and young students. Some food companies place
the soft drink and snack vending machines within school
campuses; some food advertisements always interrupt
children’s television or radio programmes; children and
young students are comparatively vulnerable to those
advertisements and promotions, and buy the energy-dense,
nutrient-poor foods, snacks and beverages which could
lead to weight gain and obesity (21). Therefore, the
restrictions of some foods are needed. In fact, some
countries,
including
Canada,
European
and
Asian
countries, have already imposed restrictions on the food
marketing towards children in different degrees and
achieved success to a certain extent (7).
E. Clinical interventions
The FCTC also requires governments to use clinical
interventions to reduce the demand of cigarettes. The
Article 14 of the WHO FCTC (8, p.13) states that each
member state should take effective measures based on the
scientific guidance “to promote cessation of tobacco use
and adequate treatment for tobacco dependence”. To
achieve
the
goal,
each
Party
should:
design
and
implement effective clinical programmes in schools,
workplaces and health care facilities; include diagnosis
and
treatment
in
national
health
and
education
programmes;
and
facilitate
the
accessibility
and
affordability for treatment of tobacco dependence (8).
The clinical interventions can effectively increase the
level of cessation of tobacco use, and may rapidly decline
the morbidity and mortality from tobacco (7).
The clinical interventions addressed in the WHO FCTC
can also be applied for obesity control. The governments
could follow the methods introduced in the FCTC and
make another series of policies to provide more clinical
interventions
and
resources,
such
as
physician
counselling and pharmacotherapy, to help people to
control their weight by eating healthily and doing more
physical activities (7). However, at current stage, the
nutritional and physical activity counselling for obesity
control comparatively remains underused and imperfectly
designed. Successful clinical interventions for dietary
change
require
collaborative
goal-setting,
individually-tailored programmes, personalized feedback
and personalized follow-up (9). Therefore, when using
clinical interventions to control obesity, governments
should consider more comprehensively.
The above discussion suggests that the measures involved
in the WHO FCTC can be applied for obesity control,
while
it
still
needs
close
cooperation
between
governments,
international
organizations
and
civil
societies to create synergy. The obesity control still
cannot be dealt with by one country alone, many small
countries may not have enough authority and power to
implement the regulations and policies in the food
industries, for example, require the multinational food
85

GLOBAL HEALTH 2014 : The Third International Conference on Global Health Challenges

and beverage companies to include the specific health
warnings on their products' labels, as those companies
may simply refuse the governments requirements relying
on their high popularity and market share (4). "Only an
enforced international standard would change the balance
of
power"(4,
p.293).
Relying
on
the
international
resolution
and
the
support
from
the
international
organizations as well as civil societies, governments of
most countries can have more confidence and power to
restrain the market availability of unhealthful food and
beverage
in
order
to
successfully
control
obesity.
Therefore, an effective international model which is
similar to the WHO FCTC is highly necessary, especially
for those small or developing countries.
V. DISCUSSION: CHALLENGES AND
ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE POTENTIAL MODEL FOR
OBESITY CONTROL
The WHO FCTC and the potential model for obesity
control may have shared the challenges. This part will
firstly introduce the challenges of the WHO FCTC, and
then discuss the challenges of the potential model for
obesity
control,
and
finally
introduce
the
potential
model's achievements at current stage.
Similar to all the other ambitious political movements,
the WHO FCTC also has some challenges. Besides the
negotiating process is relatively slow and difficult, the
main challenges include the difficulty to enforce bans on
advertisements, and the obstruction of tobacco industry.
The first challenge is that the anti-tobacco campaigns are
difficult to be enforced. The Article 13 of the WHO
FCTC, which requires all the Parties enact comprehensive
bans on the advertising, sponsorship and promotion of
tobacco industry, is proved to be rather difficult to
implement.
Firstly,
the
anti-tobacco
advertising
campaigns cannot be effective unless they are run over
long periods (1). It is suggested that such strategies
should run for at least half a year to affect the public
awareness, and one to two years to have obvious impact
on people’s attitudes and behaviors (22). However, such
measures
are
expensive,
and
the
tobacco
control
programs may lack the sufficient resource, especially the
financial
support,
to
run
extensive
and
sustained
campaigns (23). Moreover, the tobacco industry always
tries to act against the tobacco control programs. Many
tobacco
companies
claim
that
those
programs’
information on tobacco use are inaccurate and misleading,
and
try
every
method
to
dodge
and
prevent
the
anti-tobacco advertising programs (23). The outcome is
that at the current stage, there are only 19 countries
enforce comprehensive bans on all forms of advertising,
sponsorship and promotions of
tobacco products (23).
The other challenge to the WHO FCTC implementation is
the tobacco industry. To fight for its existence and to
maximize
their
profit,
the
tobacco
companies
continuously
adapt
tactics
and
create
loopholes
to
circumvent the new policies and regulations controlling
their activities (1). A recent study found that when
opposing the anti-tobacco legislation and programs, the
tobacco industry always argue that those policies lack of
jurisdiction and accuracy, and impose technical barriers
to trade (24). Besides, tobacco companies have been
researching how to make new and more appealing
products. Therefore, the tobacco industry is the believed
to be the single largest challenge to the WHO FCTC
implementation (1).
Similar to the WHO FCTC, the model for obesity control
may also face those challenges. The first one is the
difficulty to enforce restriction on the advertising and
promotion of unhealthful food and beverage. As foods
and drinks are essential to people, and are much more
complicated
than
tobacco
products,
it
is
hard
for
governments to enforce bans on the advertisements of
some particular foods, and restrict people’s choices. The
second main
challenge is the food industry. Food
companies, especially multi-national food companies,
which are believed to have more power and influence
than tobacco companies, will consistently act against rein
and regulations in order to maximize profit. The third one
is
that
such
a
model
may
adversely
affect
food
availability due to the expensive and heavy handed legal
restrictions (7). Therefore, the model to control obesity
faces even more challenges and needs to be considered
more carefully when draw the lessons from the WHO
FCTC.
Although facing many challenges and difficulties, some
achievements have been made at current stage. Firstly,
the WHO Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and
Health (GSDPAH) was endorsed by the World Health
86
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2014.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-359-9
GLOBAL HEALTH 2014 : The Third International Conference on Global Health Challenges

Assembly in 2004. The Strategy has mirrored the
measures in the WHO FCTC, including the integrated
economic approach, more effective labeling and package
measure, tighter marketing and promotion control, and
intensive educational campaign (25). It encourages all the
Parties to make efforts and closely cooperate with other
countries and organizations to deal with the issue of
obesity. It is believed to be a big stride forward in
constituting a model to restrain the market availability of
unhealthful food for obesity control. Besides, under the
pressures from governments and organizations, some
multi-national food and beverage companies, including
Krafts and Pepsi, have made compromise to different
degrees. For example, Krafts announced that it would not
only eliminate the trans-fatty acids and improve the
nutritional content of its food and beverage products, but
also
stop
marketing
towards
children
(4).
These
achievements possibly indicate a good start and a bright
future for the model to restrain the market availably of
unhealthful food for obesity control.
However, a promising start does not indicate a smooth
process and a favorable outcome. Some difficult points
could still not be ignored. First, the GSDPAH has
comparatively weak restriction force on the governments
and public actors, and could only take measures in more
tender forms such encourages and suggestions instead, let
alone for the ambitious food and drink companies.
Second, implementing the price and tax measures could
possibly incur the public opposition and other technical
problems. Third, the unhealthy food is just one of, rather
than all of, the contributing factors for obesity; while
other factors, such as unhealthy lifestyle and the lack of
exercise, leave a very small space for governments to
control by mainly implementing economic approach and
advertisement-banning regulation. Last, unlike the desire
for tobacco, the desire for food, including the high-energy
and high-fat food, is probably the deep and instinctive
human nature, and thus make the obesity problems more
complicated. Therefore, governments could hardly walk
in the fine line when controlling obesity problems to a
considerable degree.
VI. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, although the policies included in the WHO
FCTC could not be adapted for controlling obesity
wholesale, the WHO FCTC can indeed constitute a model
to constrain the market availability of unhealthful foods
and beverages for obesity control. The WHO FCTC has
successfully controlled tobacco use, and the key measures,
which are economic approach, educational strategies,
labeling measure, restrictions on marketing as well as
clinical invention, can be applied to restrain the market
availability of unhealthful foods in order to control
obesity. However, not all the foods are lethal, the issue of
obesity control may be more complicated than tobacco
control. Governments and organizations should cooperate
globally
and
closely,
and
apply
those
measures
comprehensively to create synergy in order to better
control obesity. Though the potential model for obesity
control may face some challenges such as the difficulty of
implementation and obstruction of food industry, it has
already made some achievements at current stage; for
example, the WHO Global Strategy on Diet, Physical
Activity and Health has been endorsed, which indicates
that the future of the model for obesity control will
possibly be bright.
