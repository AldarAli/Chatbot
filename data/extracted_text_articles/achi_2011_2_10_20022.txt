INTRODUCTION
The wide study of personality theory and mental health 
has opened research directions to better understand 
personnel psychology. Companies are increasingly aiming 
to develop their human workforce by studying their 
employees’ individual characteristics. Robbins [1] identified 
four 
individual-level 
variables, 
i.e. 
biographical 
characteristics, ability, personality, and learning, which have 
effects on employee performance and satisfaction.
However, since the use of questionnaire-based objective 
tests for both personality and mental health has been widely 
established [2], the time required for employers and 
employees to carry out such questionnaires is increasingly 
becoming wasteful and troublesome. On the other hand, 
recent technology enables to visualize office workers’ 
interactions 
[3], 
identify 
human 
behavior 
within 
organizational situations
and obtain associated tacit 
knowledge [4][5] without privacy intrusion or major burden.
The purpose of this study was to propose a sensor-based 
methodology 
to 
estimate
behavior 
and 
to 
further 
demonstrate existing correlations between employee’s 
behavior and, mental health and personality traits. Building 
on the aforementioned findings, this study provides 
conclusions involving personality traits and mental health in 
the working setting with a minimum required burden from 
both employers and employees.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II contains an 
overview of related personality and mental health studies in 
the workplace. In Section III, it is proposed a methodology 
to estimate behavior based on sensory data, which was used 
in Section IV to analyze the relationship with personality 
and mental health. Section V includes a summary of the 
paper and presents future work.

RESEARCH ON PERSONALITY AND MENTAL HEALTH
Personality has been defined as the characteristic manner 
in which one thinks, feels, behaves, and relates to others [6]. 
Robbins [1] claimed that all our behavior is at some extent 
explained by our personalities and experiences. Traits in 
personality psychology have been used to describe 
consistent inter-correlated behavior patterns [7]. The study 
of personality traits has increased the understanding of the 
differences between people’s behavior in order to explain 
how certain personality traits better adapt for certain job 
types [1][8], how personality relates to the effective 
performance of teams [8][9][10], and how personality is a 
component of motivation [11]. 
With similar attention, mental health in the workplace 
has also been studied. A study has concluded that adverse 
psychosocial work conditions are predictors of depression 
worsening
[12]. This result was independent
from 
personality traits analyses, and demonstrated the importance 
of the study of mental health alone. 
A.
Personality traits in this study
The Five Factor Model (FFM) is a taxonomy, or 
descriptive model, of personality traits organized at the 
broadest level of abstraction in five factors or dimensions 
named: 
extraversion 
or 
surgency, 
agreeableness, 
conscientiousness, emotional stability versus neuroticism, 
and intellect or openness [7]. These traits became eventually 
known as the Big Five [13]. Extraversion describes traits
relating energy, dominance, sociability, and positive 
emotions. Agreeableness includes traits such as altruism, 
tender-mindness, trust and modesty, defining a prosocial 
orientation towards others. Conscientiousness summarizes 
traits which facilitate goal-directed behavior. Neuroticism 
describes anxiety, sadness or irritability, contrasting 
emotional stability. Finally, openness describes the depth of 
an individual’s mental and experiential life [14].
Locus of Causality traits are related to the motivation 
factor of an individual and it examines the source of the 
motivation when engaging on an activity. Locus of 
Causality’s intrinsic motivation refers to doing something 
because it is inherently interesting, fun, or enjoyable. On the 
other hand, extrinsic motivation refers to doing something 
because it leads to a separable outcome, or because it 
responds to external demands. Each motivation trait has two 
secondary scales. Secondary scales for intrinsic motivation 
22

are enjoyment and challenge. Challenge orientation is 
related to problem-solving, while enjoyment orientation is 
related to writing and art involvement. Secondary scales for 
extrinsic motivation are outward and compensation scales. 
Outward motivation entails personal endorsement and a 
feeling of choice. Compensation, on the other hand, 
involves mere compliance with an external control [15][16]. 
General Causality Orientation
is referred as the 
individual differences that can be characterized in terms of 
people’s understanding of the nature of causation of 
behavior [17]. In other words, these traits characterize the 
degree to which human behaviors are volitional or self-
determined. There are three causality orientations, namely, 
autonomy, control, and impersonal orientation. Autonomy 
orientation trait involves a high degree of experienced 
choice related to the initiation and regulation of one’s own 
behavior. Control orientation trait involves people’s 
behavior following controls either in the environment or 
inside themselves. Impersonal orientation trait involves 
people’s experiencing their behavior as being beyond their 
intentional control [17].
Self-monitoring people are described as showing 
considerable adaptability and behavior flexibility to external 
factors, being capable of behave differently in different 
situations [1].
Type A personality is the trait describing people which is 
aggressively involved to achieve more in less time. Highly 
rated Type A people are highly competitive, cannot cope 
with leisure time, and are continuously measuring their 
success [1].
B.
Mental health in this study
The mental health statuses considered for this study were 
depression and happiness. The viewpoint from which these 
traits were analyzed was to relate depression, and stress, 
against job satisfaction characterized by happiness in the 
workplace. 
III.
STUDY 1: ESTIMATION OF BEHAVIOR BASED ON 
SENSORY DATA
This first study proposed a methodology to estimate 
human behavior at the workplace based on objective data 
measured by sensors. An experiment was done in order to 
investigate the possibility of identifying human behavior. 
A.
Participants
Two male participants volunteered for this experiment. 
They were aged 25 and 44, and were all in sound health 
condition. 
B.
Apparatus
Business Microscope (BM) [5] developed by Hitachi 
Corporation was used in this experiment. Users wore BM
like a neck-hanging name-tag, and BM records data from its 
acceleration, face-to-face (IR), temperature, and voice
intensity sensors.
C.
Procedure
Each participant wore a BM device and acted out 
behavior categories for 2 hours as if they were engaging in 
daily office working activities. The characterized behavior 
categories were walking, talking, desk working, and not-
working related behaviors like sleeping, eating/drinking, or 
simply being unoccupied. These last were grouped, and 
hereafter referred as idle category. 
D.
Measurements
For the purposes of this study, this experiment only used 
acceleration and voice intensity sensory raw data with a 
sampling frequency of 50 Hz. Due to privacy concerns and 
to a limitation of energy consumption, each datum was 
observed for 2s long and was acquired once every 10s. The 
data captured by the device was wirelessly transferred to a 
server where it was stored. 
While wearing a BM device, participants acted out
behaviors, switching them from one to another. Every time 
they switched behaviors, participants marked the time, the 
location, the posture, and the behavior being acted.
E.
Results
Sensor data chosen from each behavior category was 
plotted for analysis to reveal distinctive characteristics
representing each acted behavior. Such information was 
used to build a method to estimate behavior. Such behavior 
was compared with the actual behavior characterized by 
participants to find out hit and false alarm rates. A hit was 
defined by corresponding predicted and actual behaviors. 
False alarm on the contrary was defined by a mismatch 
between them.
A graphic method, the Receiver Operating Characteristic 
(ROC), was used to evaluate and compare the performances 
of signal-noise discrimination [18]. ROC was used to 
portray the optimal criteria to detect behaviors and to select 
the most effective prediction thresholds. 
1)
Behavior detection criteria
In the walking category plot the amplitude and the 
frequency of the oscillations of acceleration data were 
calculated. The amplitude of the curve was calculated with 
the subtraction of the curve’s minimum data value from the 
maximum data value. As for the number of oscillations of 
the curve, it was used the zero crossing method. The zero 
cross line was determined as the data’s average line. The 
number of times the curve crossed the zero-crossing line 
were added up to obtain the curve’s frequency. 
Sound intensity curve was represented by temporal 
changes of sound volume. The data’s mean and the standard 
deviation was calculated and used to obtain thresholds for 
data characterized by sound representing a talking behavior.
For desk working behavior plot, back and forth 
acceleration data was investigated. It was found that the 
mean of acceleration data at time t, and the mean of 
acceleration data at time t-10s, tended to be comparable. As 
differences in mean values of these succeeding two time

points were limited in range, it was assumed that such 
behavior corresponded to small posture changes as those 
displayed by desk working behavior. Upper and lower limits 
of this range were calculated. Data found within this range 
was regarded as desk working behavior data. 
As for the idle behavior category, the acceleration data’s 
frequency of vibration was analyzed. The most suitable data 
for analysis was found along the acceleration’s vertical 
direction; therefore the zero crossing number was used to 
calculate this behavior’s data frequency. 
2)
Sequential detection method
The ROC curves for each behavior category are shown 
in Figure 1. The variance of dots in each graph represents 
the performance of criteria using various threshold 
combinations. The results showed that the best detection 
performance (represented by a red dot) was found in the 
following order: walking behavior category, talking, desk 
working, and idle behavior. For this reason it was adopted a 
sequential detection order which set the sensitivity [18] of 
each detection method as the detection order priority. Thus, 
walking behavior was the first category to be detected from 
the entire sensor data set. From the remaining data, talking 
behavior was detected, then desk working, and finally idle 
behavior category. 
IV.
STUDY 2: STUDY OF PERSONALITY AND MENTAL 
HEALTH BASED ON BEHAVIOR DATA
The purpose of this study was to analyze the 
relationships among personality and mental health, and 
behavior estimated by the method proposed in Section III. 
An experiment was conducted, and a correlation analysis 
was done in order to validate that sensory data can be used 
to assess personality and mental health.
A.
Participants
Ninety two Japanese participants, 77 males and 15 
females, ranging between 21 and 61 years old (M = 35.93, 
SD = 8.50), who worked as software developers at a certain 
company volunteered for the experiment. They were all 
capable of moving freely and perform routine office 
activities. 
B.
Apparatus
The apparatus for this study were the same as those used 
in study one. Refer to Section III.B.
C.
Procedure
Participants wore individual BM devices every working 
day for 71 days, time in which they engaged in normal daily 
working activities. Participants’ behavior was detected 
according to the procedure explained in Section III. Also 
participants conducted 8 sets of questionnaires, 5 relating 
personality, and 3 more relating mental health. 
D.
Measurements
To assess the big five personality, the Big Five Inventory 
[14], which consisted of 44 items, was used. The Work 
Preference Inventory (WPI) which consists of 30 items was 
used to assess Locus of Causality [16]. The 12-item General 
Causality Orientation Scale Questionnaire (GCOS) was 
used to assess General Causality Orientation [17]. It was 
also used the Self Monitoring trait questionnaire developed 
by Lennox and Wolfe [19], and the Type A questionnaire
developed by Bortner [20]. 
As for mental health, two scales for depression and one 
for happiness were used. Although these states could be 
related to a general happiness scale, in this study the term 
mental health was used to describe them. The Center for 
Epidemiology Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was 
developed by Radloff [21], and consisted of 20 items. Also 
the Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition (BDI-II) was 
used and consisted of 21 items. It is a self-administered 
questionnaire assessing the severity of depression in adults 
and adolescents [22]. The last mental health trait studied 
was satisfaction. The Oxford Happiness Questionnaire 
(OHQ) was used to assess this trait [23].
E.
Results
This study considered unitary behavior samples and 
behavior events as measurement units. A behavior sample 
was defined as each datum in a set of data corresponding to 
an estimated behavior category (one sample per 10s). A 
behavior event was defined as the sequential group of 2 or 
more samples under the same behavior category. A 
chronological summary showing the time series of estimated 
behavior samples and events was prepared for each 
participant. This summary indicated what type of behavior 
category a participant engaged in and for how long.

1)
Detected behavior
After analyzing the number of behavior samples of the 92 
participants, three outlier participants were excluded as they 
provided significantly less number of samples (< M – 2 x 
SD) due to their absence in the experimentation settings. The 
results hereafter report data from the remaining 89 
participant, 74 males and 15 females (M = 36.07, SD = 
8.56). From the total number of detected samples, 28% were 
detected as walking, 15% as talking, 30% as desk working,
and 21% were detected as idle behavior. There were a 5% of 
samples which could not be detected as any of the proposed 
behaviors.
2)
Behavior characteristic variables 
Characteristic variables were obtained for the behavior 
samples and events of individual participants. The behavior 
characteristic variables (BCVs) were represented by letters 
triplets. The first letter of each triplet represented the 
behavior categories. This is W, T, D, and I represented 
walking, talking, desk working, and idle behaviors,
respectively. The second letters in a triplet were A, T, E, and 
D, and represented time instances. A as a triplet’s second 
letter represented the entire time span. T as a triplet’s second 
letter represented the time ratio per day. This ratio was 
obtained by dividing a given behavior total time over the 
total time in a day. The letter E as a triplet’s second letter 
represented the number of events per day. The letter D as 
the second letter in a triplet represented the behavior events 
duration. If the second letter of the triplet was A, the third 
letters of a triplet were T or E. In this case T represented the 
time ratio, and E represented an event. However if the 
second letter of the triplet was T, E, or D, then the third 
letter of a triplet were A, D, or M, which stood for average, 
standard deviation, and median. 
Personalities like intrinsic or extrinsic motivation are 
estimated to be related to the variation of behavior. In order 
to assess this variation, the percentage of behavior-engaged 
time over all the experiment’s time span and the number of 
events per day was calculated. It was also calculated the 
average, standard deviation and median of behavior-
engaged time (time ratio T and number of events E) per day.
The concept of absorption is important for some 
personality traits and it is considered to be strongly related 
with uninterrupted behavior engagement. Therefore the 
average, standard deviation and median of the time 
continuance of each behavior were also calculated (triplets 
with “D” as the second letter). 
3)
Correlation among personality traits, mental health, 
and BCVs
Big Five personality scores and BCVs combinations 
whose correlations were significant are shown in Table I. 
Extraversion showed positive correlation with walking 
behavior variables. It was also found negatively correlated
with talking events (TEA, TEM) and desk working related

variables (DAE, DAT, DEA, DTA, DTM). These results
suggested that people who often walk, and often spent their 
time away from their desks were likely to be extraverted. 
Intrinsic Locus of Causality personality scores and 
BCVs combinations whose correlations were significant are 
shown in Table II. Talking related variables were negatively 
correlated with intrinsic locus of causality, and both of its 
subscales, enjoyment and challenge. It can be argued that 
intrinsically motivated people have a strong preference for 
working individually without talking or interacting with 
people around. However, as it is shown in Table II, idle 
behavior variables were found positively correlated with 
challenge subscale alone. It might be argued that the nature 
of intrinsic locus of causality and challenge orientation, 
motivate these people to find time to think and reflect about 
their own initiatives. 
Other results showed that extrinsic motivated people did 
not tend to stay in their desks or focus on their work for 
long periods as desk working related variable (DAT, DTA,
DTM, DDM) were all negatively correlated with extrinsic 
locus of causality and compensation subscale.

General Causality Orientation personality scores and 
BCVs combinations whose correlations were significant are 
shown in Table III. Talking related variables correlated 
negatively with the autonomy trait. On the other hand, 
impersonal trait correlated positively with desk working and 
idle behavior related variables. It can be argued that people
who do not actively engage or face external circumstances 
tend to spend their time at their desks. 
These results implied that people with high impersonal 
score, whose behavior is marked by decisions beyond their 
control, tend to follow directions as they are told. In other 
words, these people might not leave their desks or stop 
working. These findings are comparable to idle behavior 
variables being positively correlated with impersonal trait. It 
can be argued that as these people did not leave their desks, 
they might have time to loosen up, even in front of their 
desks. 
Self monitoring trait was positively correlated with 
walking related variables (WAT, WTA, WTM, WDA, 
WDM). This suggested that people with high sociability 
skills, or those rating high in self monitoring, engage for 
longer periods in walking behavior. High self-monitoring 
rated people are able to show striking contradictions 
between their public persona and their private self [1]. Thus, 
by the fact that self monitoring correlated negatively with 
talking related variables (TEA, TEM) it can be argued that 
even though these people regulate their behavior by walking 
or interacting with others, they might be reluctant to show 
their opinions by an apprehension of social disapproval. 
Type A trait correlated positively with the number of 
walking events per day (WEM). This suggested that people 
who tended to walk more often are likely to be competitive 
or involved in achieving more in less time. It might be 
argued that these people are often walking around, looking 
for self-improving opportunities.
Mental health scores and BCVs combinations whose 
correlations were significant are shown in Table IV. Both

depression scales utilized in this study presented similar 
results which highlighted positive correlation with talking, 
desk working, and idle behavior related variables (TEA, 
TEM, DAE, DEA, DEM, IEA). These results suggested that 
people who more often engaged in talking, desk working, 
and idle behaviors present higher depression or stress
scores. By the fact that BDI-II depression scale positively 
correlated with walking idle events related variables (WEA, 
IEM) it can be argued that both, unoccupied 
behavior people or persistently walking people, might 
display high work depression or stress.
The OHQ results showed that high talking, and desk 
working behavior people often showed frustration or 
discontent (TAE, TAT, TEA, TEM, TTA, TTM, TDM, 
DAE, DEA, DEM). It can be argued that people who talked 
for longer periods, would be able to cope with 
dissatisfaction. 
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The present study proposed a methodology to estimate 
personality from sensory data information. However studies 
pertaining personality with emphasis to the workplace are 
numerous, the established measuring method used by those 
studies were questionnaire tests. This study built up a clear 
methodology through which personality is
estimated 
unobtrusively and without the need of questionnaires, 
through
the use of acceleration and voice sensory 
information. 
In Study One it was effectively detected walking, 
talking, desk working, and idle behaviors, with hit and false 
alarm rates of 0.78 and 0.12, 0.82 and 0.19, 0.69 and 0.48, 
and 0.59 and 0.28, respectively. In Study two, the 
correlation analysis showed significant correlations between 
behavior and all personality and mental health traits studied 
except for openness. Personality variables that showed 
significant correlations with greater extent of behavior 
variables were extraversion, intrinsic motivation, challenge, 
and happiness.
Also, the behavior category which showed significant 
correlation with the greater number of personality variables

was desk working behavior category revealing 31 
significant correlations; while the behavior category which 
showed significant correlation with the least number of 
personality variables was idle category with only 18 
significant correlations. 
The results in this study suggest that it is possible to 
effortlessly assess personality and mental health, respecting 
the privacy of employees, and without the need of 
questionnaires. What has been argued as a benefit of the use 
of questionnaires (greater choice) is a major weakness; the 
use of questionnaires allows for questionnaire items' 
omission or misrepresentation, thus affecting the overall 
effectiveness and goals of the assessment. This limitation 
affects the informant himself who is the ultimate beneficiary 
of the research efforts.
Furthermore, personality is 
continuously shaped by experiences, and thus questionnaires 
are limited to cope with personality’s changing nature. As 
the methodology presented in this study is set
by 
continuously loading data, the personality and mental health
information obtained will always
provide
up-to-date
information. In addition, saving employers’ and employees’
time, is yet another benefit proposed by this study, which
opens a new behavior estimation research direction, and 
thus its continuation is essential. Future studies should 
deepen this study’s findings: it should consider additional 
working settings; the improvement of the behavior detection 
method including participants from both genders, and a 
larger set of behavior categories.
