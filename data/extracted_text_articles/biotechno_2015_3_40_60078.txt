Abstract—Laccase is a ceruloplasmin widely used in industrial
production. It is mainly used in catalytic degradation of lignin
and its catalytic process is safe and environmentally friendly.
Small molecule medium is not only commonly used as a
catalyst
in the laccase catalytic reactions,
but also can
participate in the reaction as a substrate. In this study, the
reactions of small molecules as substrates and laccase are
investigated by the changes in the absorption wavelength of the
reaction system recorded by ultraviolet spectrometer and
analysis of the reaction of laccase and small molecules using
MATLAB R2013a. It can be seen by the final results of
hierarchical
clustering
analysis
and
calculation
of
the
Euclidean distance that the entire medium system can be
divided into three categories, namely, (i) Cumaric Acid,
Sinapic Acid and HBT, (ii) Cumaric Acid and ABTS, and (iii)
Ferulic Acid and Syringic Acid. The results of this study
provide new ideas for finding and verifying potential medium
systems.

INTRODUCTION
With the progress of science and technology, biological
knowledge and technology are being gradually blended into
traditional chemistry to form the more and more popular
biochemistry. Currently, solving the pollution problem by a
variety of enzymes is a new direction; this approach has also
been shown to be an effective method. Through a variety of
enzymes,
the
final
products
from
decomposition
of
pollutants
are
often
simple
and
harmless
inorganic
compounds. Many biological toxic, low concentration and
difficultly degradable substances can often be decomposed
by means of biochemical processes. Among many enzymes,
laccase has the advantages of a wide range of substrates,
high catalytic activity and no pollution, and thus, not only
has great industry usefulness, but also has a very important
position in dealing
with
pollution problems. Through
continuous trials and studies, types and applications of the
small molecule catalysts that react with laccase have begun
to take shape. These small molecule mediators often play a
very important role in different fields, and greatly accelerate
the reaction efficiency. However, since laccase is an enzyme
with a very wide range of substrates, many small molecule
mediators are also within the scope of its substrates.
Originally as a catalyst, small molecule mediators may cause
some effect on the reaction when they act as substrates and
are involved in the reaction. Further, small molecule
mediators also show other characteristics in addition to
catalytic properties in the reaction.
Currently, there is not a clear classification for small
molecule mediators of laccase. By analyzing the nature of
small molecule mediators when reacting with laccase as a
substrate,
small
molecule
mediators
are
classified
by
biological information and mathematical methods, and the
role of small mediator molecules play in the reaction of
laccase can be more accurately predicted. Further, the
difficulty of predicting the nature of new small molecule
mediators can be reduced, and testing complexity can be
simplified.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section II
presents the experiments we performed. Section III explains
principal component analysis, as well as hierarchical cluster
analysis. Section IV presents the results and discussion, and
we conclude in Section V.

analysis data set and used for reaction analysis and
classification of mediators.

PRINCIPLE OF PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS AND
HIERARCHICAL CLUSTER ANALYSIS
A. Principal component analysis
In order to fully describe the system in analyzing the
current problems, analysts tend to select the relevant
indicators as thoughtfully as possible. In fact, many of the
social,
economic,
and
technical
indicators
have
a
synchronized growth trend. When an analyst intentionally or
unintentionally describes the feature of a system by namely
different indicators but actual relevant indicators, usually, he
faces the issue of multiple correlated variables. Multiple
correlations of variables imply artificially exaggerate certain
features' position in the system analysis, which affect the
objectivity of the analysis and impede decision makers' right
judgment.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [2] is a basic
method for overcoming multiple correlations of variables.
PCA is method to establish as few as possible new variables
for all variables originally proposed, so that these new
variables are independent and uncorrelated, and these new
variables
should
maintain
information
of
the
original
proposed variables as much as possible. By means of an
orthogonal transformation, PCA converts original correlated
component random vectors into relevant new random vectors
which are corrected to each other. This is manifested on
algebra as transforming a covariance matrix of original
random vectors into a diagonal matrix, and on geometry as
transforming an original coordinate system into a new
orthogonal coordinate system, in which sample points spread
in
the
most
open
p
orthogonal
directions.
Then,
multidimensional variables are treated by reducing the
dimension of the system so that variables can be converted
into a low-dimensional variable system in high accuracy.
The
low-dimensional
variable
system
is
then
further
transformed
into
a
one-dimensional
system
through
constructing an appropriate value function.
B. Hierarchical cluster analysis
Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) [3] is one of the
basic methods of exploratory research work. The so-called
clustering is clustering subjects of study into classes based
on the degree of closeness between the study subjects, and in
accordance with the principle of "Similar Together, Different
Apart".
The idea of hierarchical clustering analysis is that data
with higher similarity are closer to each other, have higher
tendency with similar properties, and therefore are grouped
into the same category. Data can be hierarchical clustered
according
to
the
Euclidean
distance
of
matrix,
and
preliminarily analyzed and classified.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Experiment results
The data collected by an ultraviolet spectrometer are
expressed in a matrix and formed an original 598 × 660
matrix, wherein each row represents the instrument data
measured in every 0.5s in the 190nm to 1850nm wavelength
range. Finally, the original matrix is cut, and data within the
wavelength range of 240-900nm are selected as the initial
data set.
Figure 1. shows wavelength changes for small mediator
molecules in the reaction system. Among them, there is no
significant similarity between each two data sets.
B. Principal component analysis[4]
•
Data with time information
Table 1 summarizes the first and second principal
component contribution rates and their sum of each
mediator by principal component analysis of the
experimental data containing time information. It can
be seen from the table that the sums of all of the first
and second main component contribution rates are in
excess of 95%. The results analysis illustrates that the
first and second principal components can be a good
representative of the relevant data sets.

After initial overlap comparison, it can be observed that
there is no significant similarity among the above images.
The corresponding one-dimensional matrixes of the first
and second main components are combined to form a
two-dimensional
vector.

the

dimensional

mediators.
It can clearly be seen through the above figure that in
all the data, some parts are intensively overlapped,
while the rest is very discrete. There is no significant
similarity and obvious trend among the data.
•
Data with wavelength information
Table 2 summarizes the first and second principal
component contribution rates and their sum of each
mediator by principal component analysis of the
experimental data containing wavelength information.
It can be seen from the table that the sums of all of the
first and second main component contribution rates
are in excess of 95%. The results analysis illustrates
that the first and second principal components can be
a good representative of the relevant data sets.
Wavelength data of the first and second principal
components are also plotted to obtain seven different
curves, respectively representing the properties of
the selected seven small molecule mediators in the
reaction of laccase. These seven curves are drawn
together to get Figure 4:
C. Hierarchical cluster analysis
From Figure 4, the tendency of each image and the
similarity between each other can be seen more clearly.
Among them, caffeic acid, Sinapic Acid and HBT as a
group, p-coumaric acid and ABTS as a group, and ferulic
acid and syringic acid as a group， have high degree of
overlap of curves within each group, indicating that the
nature of the reactions of the small molecule mediators
within each group has high similarity. On the other side,
there is significantly different tendency between each groups,
indicating that the grouping of mediators is qualitative and
efficient.
The wavelength changes during the reaction of small
molecules with laccase are shown in the reaction structure
diagram, wherein horizontal coordinate is the first principal
component and vertical coordinates is the second principal
component. Reaction structure diagram represents the full
nature of small molecules react with laccase, but there is a
large number of irregular curves overlap, and there is no
clear tendency. Therefore, principal components are re-
analyzed by transpose of the original data matrix, and the
first and second principal components are combined into a
vector. Then, hierarchical clustering analysis is done by
calculating the Euclidean distance. The results are shown in
the Figure 4, wherein smaller Euclidean distance indicates
the nature of the reaction chemistry and the catalytic
mechanism are similar. The slopes of curves in the figure are
similar, and the degree of correlation is high.
V.
CONCLUSION
When small molecule mediators as a substrate are
involved in the reaction with laccase, Coumaric Acid,
Sinapic Acid, HBT; Coumaric Acid, ABTS; Ferulic Acid
and Syringic Acid respectively have substantially the same
catalytic mechanism, and can be divided into three groups.
The selected molecules form different catalytic systems with
laccase and are divided to different categories of medium,
although many medium molecules may contain similar
functional group (such as benzene ring) or specific chemical

elements (such as nitrogen). Medium molecules may not
have the same catalytic reactions with laccase, although they
may have the same or similar groups. Medium molecules
may impact the catalytic reaction of laccase very differently,
there are belong to different groups. These three types of
catalytic medium in the catalytic system with laccase
exhibits different catalytic mechanism, changes in specific
wavelengths
are
also
different.
This
new
discovered
classification system can help study the reaction mechanism
of laccase and small molecule medium. The screening
method used in the study is based on principal component
analysis
and
cluster
analysis,
and
can
be
used
for
classification and clustering of unknown reaction medium
system of laccase. New small molecule medium systems can
also be incorporated into the above classification, and their
properties can be predicted by the categories they are
belonging to. Further, the classification can also be used as a
screening tool for small molecules that are suitable in certain
reactions. This rapid screening method can also be extended
to other fields, such as study of the reactions of other
enzymes and prediction of the properties of other reactants.
