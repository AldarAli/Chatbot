Abstract— Modern Earth observation satellites accommodate 
manifold combinations of Radio Frequency (RF) transmitters 
and receivers located at various positions on-board the 
satellite. To minimize the field strength generated by the Tx at 
the Rx position, one method is to shade the line of sight path by 
a metallic baffle leading to signal attenuation. This 
contribution shows the achievable attenuation in practical 
satellite design and compares the results obtained by field 
simulations to those obtained by a simplified model (knife-edge 
diffraction theory). Hereby, knife-edge theory has been 
expanded by inclusion of angle-dependent antenna gain. Due to 
the good agreement of the results, knife-edge theory can be 
used for first-order assessments and parameter studies. This 
approach minimizes the overall computation time and is 
currently used to optimize Radio Frequency Compatibility 
(RFC) on-board the future MetOp Second Generation 
(MetOp-SG) satellites.

 INTRODUCTION  
The European MetOp meteorological satellites currenty 
in orbit will be replaced after 2020 by follow-on satellites 
with advanced instrumentation. The MetOp-SG will ensure 
observations until approximately 2040 [1]. 
After successful finalization of ESA Phase A/B1 study 
by Airbus Defence and Space, the company has been 
nominated by EUMETSAT / ESA as prime contractor for 
the provision of the space segment of MetOp-SG. For this 
purpose, two satellites (Satellite A and Satellite B) with 
different scientific instruments are currently developed. Each 
satellite houses a variety of transmitters (Tx) and instrument 
receivers (Rx) being sensitive in the RF frequency range. 
The purpose of the transmitters is to transmit data towards 
the Earth while ensuring that the instrument receivers are not 
distorted by the emissions. Although the on-board 
transmitters are designed to radiate towards the Earth, the 
field strength around the transmitters is not negligible 
potentially leading to interference seen by the on-board 
receivers [2]. Limiting this effect is key to proper 
performance of the receivers. Reduction of unintended 
interference power can be achieved by, e.g., sufficiently 
large 
distances 
among 
transmitters 
and 
receivers, 
optimization of antenna patterns and inclusion of additional 
baffles to generate a No-Line-of-Sight between Tx and Rx. 
Figure 1 shows a preliminary model of “Satellite A” together 
with the positions of an exemplary transmitter radiating in 
the X-Band towards the Earth, the Microwave Sounder 
(MWS) instrument receiver, a baffle and the Nadir direction 
(towards the Earth during flight).

theory) to determine the baffle attenuation. Section III shows

angle-dependent antenna gain and compares the obtained 
results for the two approaches. Conclusions are given in

II. 
APPROACH TO DETERMINE BAFFLE 
INFLUENCE 
This section assumes a metallic baffle (e.g., wall) 
between a Tx and a victim Rx to limit undesired signals at 
the Rx position. The physics of electromagnetic wave 
propagation at RF frequencies is the reason for an undesired 
signal still present at the Rx position, albeit strongly 
attenuated: Signal paths originating from diffraction at the 
baffle can travel towards the Rx as a result of Huygen’s 
principle. In addition, further signal contributions may 
originate from reflections or scattering at objects in the 
vicinity of the Tx and Rx. The principle of this multipath 
propagation is visualized in Figure 2. Hereby, the shown 
diffracted path interacts with the baffle directly above the 
hypothetical Line of Sight path. In general, further diffracted 
paths are possible with interaction points along the top of the 
baffle.  
 
Figure 2.  Multipath propagation 
Since reflected and scattered paths can carry significant 
power levels, these contributions should be avoided by a 
proper design of the baffle (e.g., by an adequate height and 
an adequate length around the surrounding objects). In this 
case, the dominant contribution at Rx side only results from 
the diffraction at the baffle. Due to the physics of diffraction, 
the interfering signal decreases with steeper diffraction angle 
(e.g., increased baffle height) and frequency.  
The influence of a baffle on the received signal can be 
determined either by: 
• 
A simplified wave propagation model, e.g., theory 
of knife-edge diffraction. 
• 
3D field simulations: A simulation tool solves the 
corresponding electromagnetic field equations and 
determines the received field strength at the Rx. 
This 
method 
implicitly 
takes 
into 
account 
diffraction, reflection and scattering. 
A. Analytical Approach by Knife-edge Diffraction 
      The scenario related to “knife-edge diffraction” is 
visualized in Figure 3: It assumes a “knife-edge” obstacle 
between Tx and Rx and shows the diffracted path between 
Tx and Rx. Hereby, the obstacle subdivides the distance 
between Tx and Rx into d1 and d2. Two cases are possible: 
In case 1, the upper edge of the obstacle appears at a height 
h > 0 w.r.t. the Line of Sight (LOS). This leads to a “No 
Line of Sight” (NLOS) scenario. In case 2, the upper edge 
of the obstacle appears at a height h < 0 w.r.t. LOS. This 
leads to a LOS scenario.

resulting diffraction loss (“baffle attenuation”) as a function 
of v is plotted below for v = [-5 .. 5] as per [4]: 
 
 
Figure 4.  Diffraction loss of a “knife-edge” versus parameter v [4] 
The figure shows the level of the diffracted path in dB 
relative to freespace which is negative for v > - 0.7. Hereby, 
a level of “- x dB” corresponds to an attenuation of “x dB”. 
According to (3), v and h are proportional, hence,  
h > 0 (NLOS) is associated with v > 0, yielding a baffle 
attenuation of at least 6 dB (see graph).  
 
The above graph can be approximated, e.g.,  by the 
following piecewise function [5]:

To quickly determine the “baffle attenuation”, the 
approach is to determine v by (3) and then to apply (4) for 
the 
obtained

Figure 5.  Diffraction loss of a “knife-edge” versus h assuming d1 = 1.5 m, 
d2 = 1.5 m and f = 8.2 GHz 
The result reveals that the attenuation is very sensitive to 
the height. This behavior is due to the small wavelength 
which is only 3.7 cm in the considered case.  
 
The other way around, the theory of knife-edge 
diffraction reveals that the baffle attenuation in X-Band 
frequency range can be improved significantly by only 
slightly increasing the baffle height. In practice, constraints 
on the height are given by the required field of views of the 
transmitters and instruments. 
 
B. Simulation based approach (CST field simulation) 
      An approach based on solving electromagnetic field 
equations has the following advantages: 
• 
Result available for any baffle geometry (not only 
for simple objects like a “knife-edge”) 
• 
All wave propagation phenomena implicitly taken 
into account (e.g., also reflection and scattering), 
not only diffraction as in the “knife-edge model” 
• 
Environment (surrounding structure) can be taken 
into account   
 
       A well suited approach for satellite engineering is to use 
the simulation software “Microwave Studio” from the 
company CST. This tool has, e.g., also been used by Airbus 
Defence and Space to assess EMC/RFC for MTG satellites.  
 
     To determine the baffle attenuation, a dipole antenna is 
placed at the transmitter position and oriented in a way that 
the radiation towards the receiver position is maximized. 
The electric field strength in dB(mV/m) at a victim receiver 
is first simulated without baffle (reference, including Line of 
Sight path) and then with baffle. In both cases, the 
surrounding satellite structure is taken into account. The 
difference of the electric field strength in dB(mV/m) 
corresponds to the baffle attenuation in dB. 
 
     To obtain the simulation results reported in this paper, 
the integral equal solver based on Multi Level Fast 
Multipole Method (MLFMM) has been used. MLFMM is a 
technique based on the same principles as the traditional 
“Method of Moments” (MoM), but applicable to models of 
significantly larger electrical size. Given the geometrical 
dimensions 
of 
typical 
Earth 
observation 
satellites, 
simulations at frequencies as high as (roughly) 30 GHz can 
be performed applying this numerical technique. Higher 
frequencies (smaller wavelengths) require a mesh size 
which results in increased memory demand and simulation 
time. Should the need arise to overcome that constraint for 
practical limitations (e.g., memory size), the satellite 
structure can be restricted to a representative volume 
encompassing the Tx and Rx positions. 
III. 
COMPARISON OF FIELD SIMULATIONS W.R.T.  
KNIFE-EDGE THEORY 
     On Satellite A, the radiation of the X-Band transmitter 
towards the MWS instrument is reduced by a baffle.  
Figure 6 visualizes a part of the satellite structure including 
the phase center of the transmitter (modeled as a dipole) 
radiating at 8.2 GHz, the baffle as well as the MWS victim 
receiver. Hereby, two Rx positions (“Position 1”, “Position 
2”) are considered, where “Position 2” corresponds to the 
center of the MWS reflector plate. The figure also shows the 
position of the Sentinel-5 instrument.

“with baffle”.

Figure 7.  Simulated field strength at MWS assuming radiating  
dipole; f=8.2 GHz 
Observation: 
Position 1: The case “Without baffle” reveals a field 
strength of 90 ± 1 dBmV/m”. The case “With baffle” 
reveals 72 ± 1 dBmV/m. Hence, the difference is 18 dB. 
Position 2: The case “Without baffle” reveals a field 
strength of ≈ 77 dBmV/m”. The case “With baffle” reveals 
≈ 64 dBmV/m. Hence, the difference is 13 dB. 
 
      In a second step, the attenuation is estimated by 
applying the theory of knife-edge diffraction. As explained 
in the section on knife-edge theory, the baffle subdivides the 
theoretical LOS path into two distances (d1, d2) and a 
relative height h of the baffle. 
For “Position 1”, the values are: d1 = 1.07 m, d2 = 1.08 m,  
h = 0.16 m. Assessment at f = 8.2 GHz yields an expected 
baffle attenuation of 17.2 dB while 18 dB has been 
simulated by CST software according to the previous figure. 
This shows a good agreement between simplified theory and 
CST simulations. Assessment for “Position 2” (d1 = 1.05 m, 
d2 = 1.43 m, h = 0.218 m) at f = 8.2 GHz yields an expected 
baffle attenuation of 18 dB while 13 dB has been simulated 
by CST software. This behavior can be explained as 
follows: In contrast to “Position 1”, “Position 2” does not 
enable a path directly diffracted at the baffle towards the 
receiver position. The signal can arrive at “Position 2” only 
via multiple interactions, hence, the knife-edge diffraction 
theory based on a single baffle is not applicable. 
 
      Next, the radiation pattern of the transmit antenna is 
replaced by the measured characteristics of the physical X-
Band antenna which is a helix antenna. Figure 8 visualizes 
the 3D pattern as well as the antenna gain as a function of 
elevation angle Θ.

Hence, the difference caused by the baffle is 10 dB.

      The question arises if this value of 10 dB attenuation can 
be predicted by the knife-edge diffraction theory. To do so, 
the angle-dependent antenna data has been incorporated into 
the knife-edge diffraction theory. The approach is described 
hereafter:  
      First, the elevation angle is determined under which a 
propagation path leaves the transmitter. Figure 10 shows the 
principal scenario:  
• 
A dotted line indicates the propagation path in LOS 
direction which is present in absence of the baffle. 
The associated elevation angle is Θ1.  
• 
In presence of a baffle, a path originating from 
diffraction appears at an angle Θ2 < Θ1. Hereby, the 
interaction point with the baffle is inside the plane 
defined by the  Nadir direction and the LOS 
direction.

Figure 10.  Principal scenario involving diffracted paths  
      For “Position 1”, the elevation angles and the associated 
antenna gain according to Figure 8 are: 
• 
Θ1 = 89.9 deg, associated with a gain of -12.5 dBi. 
• 
Θ2 = 82.4 deg, associated with a gain of -7.3 dBi. 
Hence, the diffracted path runs along a direction with higher 
gain when compared to the LOS direction. Therefore, it is 
expected that the influence of the baffle is lower compared 
to the dipole case. The expected attenuation by insertion of 
the baffle corresponds to the result of the dipole, corrected 
by the delta antenna gain, hence, the expected value is 17.2 
dB – ((-7.3) - (-12.5)) dB = 12 dB.  
      For comparison, 10 dB attenuation has been determined 
using the CST simulation software. Limited differences in 
the result can be explained, e.g., by  
• 
Multipath propagation:  
While above consideration assumes only one 
diffracted path, further diffracted paths are possible 
along the top of the baffle. These additional paths 
occur out of the plane which is defined by Nadir 
direction and LOS direction. Possible additional 
paths are already visualized in the left part of  
Figure 10. In principle, all paths have to be 
weighted by the angle-dependent antenna gain and 
then summed up. As the knife-edge theory does not 
predict multiple paths and the associated elevation 
angles, only weighting of the diffracted path “in-
plane” is possible. A more complex channel model 
which predicts multiple paths and allows for 
insertion of an angle dependent antenna gain is 
Ray-tracing [7]. A disadvantage of this technique is 
however increased computational time. 
• 
Baffle geometry:  
The baffle geometry differs from the ideal “knife-
edge theory” as the baffle is bended and the 
distance between Tx and baffle differs along the 
baffle.  
• 
Approximation of Fresnel integral : 
Equation (4) is only an approximation of  (1). 
 
        To verify the effect of baffles on-board the MetOp-SG 
satellites prior to launch, early measurements are envisaged 
in the frame of ground testing. These so-called mock-up 
tests will use transmitters and receivers  with representative 
antenna pattern as well as a relevant part of the satellite 
structure. 
 
        A similar approach using an adapted knife-edge model 
is shown in [8] which considers the channel between a train 
and a satellite including a knife-edge obstacle that models 
structural elements on the roof of the train. In [8], classical 
knife-edge theory is expanded by only one antenna gain (the 
“train antenna gain”)  whereas the present contribution takes 
into account both the characteristics of the transmitter and 
the receiver.  
 
       Finally, a general remark is given w.r.t. field predictions 
when involving antenna patterns: The radiation pattern of a 
transmit antenna differs between the near-field and the far 
field where far field conditions are achieved at distances of 
d > dmin = 2 D² / λ  (D = antenna dimension). When using a 
far field antenna pattern in above approach, the distance 
between the transmit antenna and the baffle has to be at least 
dmin (fulfilled in above consideration).   
  
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
     On-board a satellite, strong decoupling between a 
transmitter and a victim receiver can be achieved by a baffle 
of adequate height and length so that the strongest 
propagation path results from diffraction at the top of the 
baffle. 
 
     The height of the baffle shall be large enough to  
• 
realize NLOS between Tx and Rx (and hence, a 
diffracted path towards the Rx)

• 
avoid reflexions at, e.g., high objects in the vicinity 
of Tx and Rx 
     The length of the baffle shall be large enough to avoid 
reflexions at objects next to the baffle which could carry 
significant power towards the Rx.  
 
      To determine the baffle attenuation for such a properly 
designed baffle, two methods have been studied: 3D field 
simulations and knife-edge diffraction theory (based on a 
single baffle), expanded by information on antenna gain. It 
has been shown that the results agree well when the 
diffracted path can travel directly into the Rx as per Figure 
10 (no multiple diffraction). Hence, the simplified theory 
helps to quickly assess the baffle influence prior to starting 
time-consuming simulations. This approach is currently 
applied by Airbus Defence and Space to ensure radio 
frequency compatibility on the future MetOp-SG satellites.
