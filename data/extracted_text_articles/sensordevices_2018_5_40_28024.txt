Abstract—Various device validation methodologies for activity
monitoring are growing in number, but the information about
the regulation and rules of recognition for the software and
hardware used with these devices is not presented. There are
different characteristics that should be evaluated to prove the
reliability of these devices, including different security and
privacy parameters. Activity monitoring can be performed
with mobile devices and other devices whose software versions
are updated regularly. That is why these devices should be
regulated,
including
the
devices
implemented
in
smart
environments, containing the ones implemented in furniture,
which are important for the monitoring of ageing people. The
regulation of these devices and mobile applications has been
discussed, but there are no specific rules. This study presents
some possible methods for the regulation of mobile devices and
applications for activity monitoring of ageing people, which
can also be influenced by environmental conditions.

I.
INTRODUCTION
Activity monitoring is a subject that has been growing
with
mobile devices and other specific devices. The
validation of these devices is important because it is
estimated that the number of ageing people and those who
need special assistance is increasing [1]. Compared with the
need for the validation of the medical devices, these devices
need to be validated by several rules for safety and accessible
use [1]. Some validation rules of the medical devices have
been created by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
[2] in the United States, and CE Marking [3] in European
Union (EU), but only few rules were defined for the
validation of the mobile applications according to the
severity level of their risks.
There are many studies about the validation of activity
monitoring systems, especially wearable technology [4].
Most research in this area has been done without mentioning
which regulation and software version was considered.
There are no concrete rules for the validation of the
activity monitoring devices and the mobile applications
available on the market. In 2010, Unites States of America’s
(USA) government started the regulation of mobile medical
applications. While the suggestion of regulation is rooted in
patient safety, concerns about limits on innovation and
discovery, as well as the evolving nature of both mobile
health and current healthcare delivery have emerged [5].
Currently, the EU countries are working on such laws [6].
Activity monitoring devices are very important for the
monitoring
of
ageing
people,
where
their
correct
functionality should be validated. In USA, FDA is validating
these devices and mobile applications, and this is subject to
reimbursement as a medical device [7]. These procedures
should be implemented in other countries in order to improve
the safety and correct use of this equipment.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
describes the different methodologies used for the validation
of the activity monitoring devices and mobile applications.
Section III proposes a validation schema for the mobile
applications and devices for activity monitoring. Section IV
presents the discussion and conclusions of this study. The
acknowledgment and references close the article.

Mobile medical applications are mobile applications that
meet the definition of a medical device and are an accessory
to a regulated medical device or transform it into a regulated
medical device [9]. Some mobile medical apps can diagnose
heart rate abnormalities by using an Activity Tracker, whose
software versions are updated periodically. For example, the
fitness watch Vivosmart HR uses the software Garmin
Express for synchronizing the date from devices. It updated
from version 2.10 to 4.30, so it is important to clarify which
version of the software was used in the research. Also, it is
important to control that a device does not update itself
during the experimental work.
In 2012, the R package ‘fda.usc’ was eliminated, which
included some utilities for functional data analysis. It also
contained functions to compute functional regression models
and basic functional principal components analysis [10]. In
2014, an article was published, which shows that “Electronic
and mobile systems play pivotal roles in healthcare delivery.
A classification system for healthcare applications should be
developed that recognizes and delineates the difference
between apps that support decision-making, and those which
purport to intervene in clinical decisions” [11].
In 2017, the FDA created a pilot study for the validation
of some products from large companies, including Apple,
Fitbit, Samsung and others [12]. The software and hardware
for activity monitoring should be validated according to
different perspectives, including Organizational Resource
Perspective, Customer Perspective, Learning and Growth
Perspective and Process Perspective, based on different
principles, including Patient Safety, Product Quality, Clinical
Responsibility, Cybersecurity Responsibility and Proactive
Culture [13]-[15]. The frequency of the updates of these
mobile applications and devices should be reduced to
guarantee their correct validation.
FDA was the first agency that started the validation for
medical devices and applications during the last years in
United States. Currently, in the European Union, the CE
Marking started the development of strict rules related to the
digital health application and devices [16].
Combining the information mentioned above, some rules
will be introduced in the next section related to high‐risk and
moderate‐risk recalls of the mobile devices and applications,
especially for the activity monitoring systems for ageing
people [22][23].
III.
RESULTS
This study presents a proposal of validation rules and
regulations for mobile and wearable technology that is used
by ageing people.
There is much research showing mobile devices or
activity monitoring systems validation, but they usually
present only brand names and do not demonstrate exactly
which tool was used for the experimental work, what was the
device serial number, generation, and date of issue [17].
Thus, it is important to clarify serial number, generation, and
date of issue of the user device in the research.
An important fact is that, when researchers validate
devices, they do not write about the software version of the
tool. Smartwatches use their own operating system and
mobile applications for synchronizing the raw data to a
server and the server gives us access to work with inputs. If
the scientist did not mention which software was used and
some reader will check artifacts of the study, the results will
not the same because programs of mobile applications and
device are updating themselves from time to time. So, it is
important for researchers to provide information on the
software version of the device and operation program for
synchronizing the data.
Commonly,
the
mobile
applications
and
computer
programs are updated from time to time. Sometimes, this
activity is happening during a very short period. So, it is
natural that the software version is the difference in the start
and end periods of the research. This case creates a
confusing situation, as the data from start steps is not the
same then data from the last stages of the study. Therefore,
the results of this type of research with be false, because the
start and end stages validation were done using a different
version. We suggest stopping software updates during the
experimental work of any study.
One example of a validated medical device that may be
used for activity monitoring is the Everion device, developed
by Biovotion [18]. It passed the rules from FDA and it is
validated as a medical device in the USA. However, this
validation is not valid worldwide. Therefore, common rules
should be developed for all countries.
Based on the validation rules created by FDA, the
validation process should be executed in three stages [19], as
follows:
1.
Process Design;
2.
Process Qualification;
3.
Continued Process Verification.
First, stage 1 should include the research about the
Building
and
Capturing
Process
Knowledge
and
Understanding, and the Establishment of a Strategy for
Process Control. Second, stage 2 should include the research
about the Design of a Facility and Qualification of Utilities
and Equipment, the Process Performance Qualification
(PPQ), the PPQ Protocol, and the PPQ Protocol Execution
and Report. Finally, stage 3 should guarantee the continuous
validation during software and hardware updates. The main
rules commonly adopted are described in [19].
Also, Boston Technology Corporation offers an end to
end mobile application testing services which include the
following [20]:

Testing Strategy should focus on two factors –
reducing testing costs and improving ‘Time to
Market’ for the mobile applications;

Functional Testing verifies that the Mobile
Application meets the functional requirements.
This testing step is critical to ensure that the
functionality built to meet the stated business
requirements and objectives works correctly as
designed.

require manual testing to effectively mimic App
user behavior;

Non-Functional Testing covers testing mobile
applications
for
usability,
performance,
scalability, security, as well as compatibility on
different devices and Operating Systems (OS)
platforms. This testing is typically done after the
application
has
been
tested
for
functional
requirements and provides insight into the
production readiness of the application. Non-
functional testing can be effectively carried out
by using testing tools, unlike functional testing,
which is largely manual. For this type of testing
to be effective, it is important to create specific
measurable test objectives [20].
IV.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The results and methodology discussed here are not
limited to regulation of mobile applications and wearable
technology validation. They provide the basis to develop this
field in European and Asian countries. The validation rules
and schema of this research are based on studies of U.S.
FDA Registration [21] and CE Marking [16].
Also, software problems in medical devices are very
frequent and have the potential to negatively influence
mHealth care. “Premarket regulation has not captured all the
software issues that could harm patients, evidenced by the
potentially large number of patients exposed to software
products later subject to high‐risk and moderate‐risk recalls”
[22][23].
The population using mobile applications and programs
for activity monitoring is growing every day. So, it is
necessary to address legal aspects for their validation.
The correct validation of these devices will increase the
confidence in them by patients and healthcare professionals.
The recognition of the activities can be a critical area,
because the recognition of the activities can be used for the
monitoring of risk situations, including the falling of ageing
people. In the future, the institutions for the ageing people
can be more proactive, combining several sensors for the
recognition
of
different
activities,
and
this
can
be
implemented with sensors available in the mobile devices
and sensors placed in the furniture, among others. The
validation of these devices should be specified and adapted
to their purpose, as their risks may increase with the creation
of intelligent systems to monitor and help ageing people
[24].
