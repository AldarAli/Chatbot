Abstract — This short paper compares 3D video image quality 
and perceived 3D video image depth of three present-day 
stereoscopic 
displays 
for 
home 
entertainment. 
These 
stereoscopic displays are represented by the commercially 
available plasma display panel (PDP) with active shutter 
glasses, digital light processing (DLP)  projection also with 
active shutter glasses and liquid crystal display (LCD) with 
passive polarization glasses. Subjective tests and assessment of 
3D video image quality and stereoscopic effects have been 
organized with help of 128 respondents in various age 
categories and 32 various 3D video or image sequences. The 
paper presents results of subjectively evaluated 3D video image 
depth and determination of the viewing conditions impact on 
perceived 3D depth. 
Keywords – stereoscopic display; 3D passive display; 3D 
polarization display; shutter glasses; circle polarization glasses,

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Today’s development of stereoscopic imaging and 3D 
video image quality evaluation is divided mainly into three 
branches. Testing methodology for 3D video image quality 
evaluation is the first one, which tries to define testing 
conditions and processing of data from subjective tests. 
These tests could be classical deliberation or behavioral 
evaluation [1], where the quality and fidelity of 3D imaging 
is evaluated by biological responses of tested subject. These 
responses are produced automatically such as postural 
responses, skin conductance or heart rate. The second way is 
to find possibilities how to describe projection of objective 
video image parameters to the space of subjective test results 
and to define metrics for their evaluation [2]. The third type 
of contemporary research in this area is focused on Quality 
of Service (QoS) determination in concrete application such 
as 3D IPTV [3] or wireless transmission is [4]. 
This paper describes subjective tests that we have 
recently organized and brings preliminary and partial results 
with their discussion. These tests have been quite complex 
and intended to investigate the subjective 3D video image 
quality and stereoscopic effect related to different display 
technologies, content parameters, light conditions, viewing 
angles and characteristics of respondents. This contribution 
selects only a fragment of our results. It focuses only on the 
influence of the viewer position on the Quality of Experience 
(QoE) for three present-day 3D display technologies.  
We have tested three different technologies, currently 
widespread on the market for 3D home entertainment 
(Table I). These present Plasma Display Panel (PDP) and 
Digital Light Processing (DLP) projection, both with active 
shutter glasses, and Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) with 
passive polarization glasses. Our analysis aims at the 
comparison of the technologies in terms of perceived quality 
of stereoscopic content and in terms of naturalness of the 
perceived 3D video image depth.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
summarizes relevant information about the mentioned 
display technologies and it needed for understanding the 
subjective test adjustment. Section 3 contains description of 
individual technical equipment used for testing and 
subjective tests arrangement. It also mentions the parameters 
of the tested 3D image video content. Next, Section 4 
provides some information about our respondents and also 
shows the results. Finally, in Section 5, the results are 
discussed and a brief outlook for the future work is given. 
II. 
3D DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY 
Time multiplexing is the most extended technique for 
stereo pair discrimination today. The display itself can be a 
classical 2D panel with higher video frame rate. The most 
important part of the system is synchronization of active 
shutter glasses, which switch light sequentially in time 
multiplex to both eyes. This approach has theoretically 
limitless horizontal and vertical viewing angles, in fact 
limited just by the display itself. However, in reality, the 
manufacturers admit some limitation in light separation, 
because of the directional characteristic of active LCD 
glasses [5] [6]. 
For this purpose, it seems very convenient to use a PDP, 
which has in principle no problem with fast refresh rate (e.g., 
0,001 ms - Panasonic TX-P42GT20E [6]). That is because 
the gas discharge ignition is practically immediate. In spite 
of this potential parameter, the current systems use only 
120 Hz frame rate for 3D. It leads to 60 frames per eye, 
which is a lower rate compared to what the classical 2D 
systems use today. Also it is not a problem for concurrent 
products based on LCD panels to reach the same parameters. 
Due to its simple configuration, the DLP technology is 
widely used for home 3D projection with time multiplexing 
of both halves of stereo pair. DLP technology can reach 
higher frame rate in comparison with LCD projectors. Frame 
rate is the same (low) as in previous system (e.g., BenQ 
W710ST, frame rate 119 Hz), but we can remark, that it is 
going to be increased in next generation of projectors.

Figure 1.  Principle of polarizated discrimination display demonstrated on cross section.
Generally, a characteristic property of projectors is the 
higher diagonal dimension of the image. 
In case of 3D utilization, it brings a higher parallax and 
consequently larger 3D effect in the same viewing 
conditions. This “advantage” should also cause problems, 
because the available content is usually calculated for 
smaller diagonal dimension and due to adaptive parallax [7] 
the 3D effect can be higher and perceptual depth can leave 
the comfortable zone. This could cause so called “dizziness”.  
Besides time multiplexing, the new implementation of 
the old known polarization technology celebrates success at 
present. Its novelty lies in using a patented system for 
circular light polarization called Film-type Patterned 
Retarder 
(FPR), 
which 
decreases 
production 
costs. 
Demonstrational cross section is shown in Fig. 1 [5]. 
Unpolarized light from Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp 
(CCFL) or Light Emitting Diode (LED) is in principle 
linearly polarized in the system of LCD panel. A half-wave 
row slice structure rotates the light polarization plane by π/2 
radians in case of odd rows of image. In this plane of the 
structure, the information for the left and right eye is

separated spatially and by linear polarization. Circular 
polarization, which is used for the intra-eye crosstalk 
minimization, is then obtained by quarter-wave plate. 
Separation of polarized light in glasses uses a reverse 
mechanism [8]. One advantage of passive system is of 
course the weight of glasses, which achieves 15 g in case of 
polarized discrimination glasses (LG) compared to 50 g or 
28 g for active shutter glasses (NVIDIA and Panasonic, 
respectively). The design of Panasonic glasses has been 
criticized for wearing discomfort by respondents.

Figure 5.   Previous experience with 3D television. 
Two independent signal sources were used, because it is 
necessary to generate separate video signals. One of them is 
time multiplexed for 3D projector – a PC with graphic card 
NVIDIA GeForce 8000 has been used. To control the other 
two displays, the home theater PC XStreamer Ultra with 
built-in SSD hard drive has been used.  
B. Laboratory Arrangement 
Fig. 3 shows a floor projection of the testing site. In all 
three cases, the same viewing conditions have been defined, 
especially the horizontal and vertical viewing angles. 
The viewing distance has been calculated as four times of 
the picture height (4h) in case of ideal viewing condition [9]. 
While horizontal angular displacement α has been set 
directly by the seat position, vertical displacement β depends 
on the tested subject height. We have asked for it in the 
evaluation form. 
 
The average height has been 180.2 cm (values from 166 
to 196 cm). These values lead to the mean vertical viewing 
angle β of 14° (from 11° to 18°) in case of LCD display, 
assuming the average distance of eyes (optical axis) from the 
top of the head is 12 cm. For PDP, the same value was 11° 
(from 8° to 14°). For projection, the mean vertical angle was 
2.5° (from 0.5° to 4.5°) in case of positive vertical 
displacement (standing observers) and 3.2° (from 1.5 to 4.3) 
in case of negative vertical displacement. 
C. 3D Video Image Content 
We have utilized three sources of content to evoke 
impression of standard home usage: Blu-ray disc, 3D 
satellite digital television broadcasting and amateur 3D 
camera captured sequences. Four sets of sequences have 
been prepared for testing. Three from the previously 
mentioned content types with an additional set containing 
static images, created from the sequences in the other sets.    
The sources used had variable native 3D format, 
compression and resolution. The original content was coded 
with Multiview Video Coding (MVC) format (for Blu-ray 
sequences), spatially compressed side-by-side and H.264 
encoded (for satellite television broadcasting) and spatially 
compressed and Advanced Video Coding High Definition 
(AVCHD) encoded (for amateur capture).  
For playback during the test session, we have converted 
all the sequences to spatially compressed (side by side) 
“Full HD” format 1920x1080/25p. The sequences were 
stored in YUV raw video format and played back with no 
compression. Native pixel resolution in Table I is calculated 
for one half of stereo pair of this input format. 
D. Test Session 
Structure of each set is done according to ITU 
recommendation ITU-R BT.710 [9], where 10 to 15 s of 
video sequence/static image is followed by 5 s of mid gray 
color. The sequences were played back in random order, 8 
sequences per format, resulting in the total of 32 sequences. 
After viewing the set of sequences on one 3D system, 
the observers were asked to perform the test on another 
system. The order of the sequences was different for this 
following test. We repeated the same procedure for all the 
three 3D systems under test. At the end of the subjective test 
session, the observers were asked to fill in a simple 
questionnaire including several personal questions and an 
overall judgment comparing the three systems in terms of 
3D effect quality and depth naturalness. The task was to 
select which of the three systems performed 3D display and 
according QoE the best [10]. 
E. Observers 
We have tested a sample of 128 people of age between 
20 and 74 years (Fig. 4). The yield of test has been over 
95 %. In total 74 respondents compared all three 3D 
technologies in their subjective tests.  
We have not done any training of our respondents; we 
have just allowed them some time to read the test form. The 
tested sample of people has consisted mainly of students 
(93%), which have no experience with video image and 
multimedia subjective quality tests at all. 
At the beginning of the test we have asked the subjects 
about personal information, including gender, age and 
employment. We have investigated for how long they watch 
TV per week, whether they suffer from eye defect and what 
their experience with 3D technology is. We have asked in 
particular about 3D home television/cinema systems, not 
about 3D cinema (Fig. 5). Scale has been four-level, where 
intermediate/great experience means, that the subject owns a 
3D display and watches 3D content sporadically/regularly.

The eye defects we distinguish among corrected ones as 
myopia/astigmatism, in that case were questioner classically 
processed, then serious defects as amblyopia, or disorder 
of spatial perception, where respondents has been discarded 
and daltonism, where only questions about perceived 3D 
video image depth has been taken into account when 
processing the results.  
IV. 
RESULTS 
In this paper, the answers for two questions from our 
complex questionnaire are only presented, associated with 
the technological aspects of the used 3D displays. 
A. Perceived Quality 
The first test question deals with 3D video image quality 
evaluation (Fig. 6). Percentage of respondents evaluating 
video image quality of a particular system as the best is 
shown by a gray bar. The colored columns show the 
proportion of respondents, who decided for a concrete 
horizontal or vertical viewing angle. This percentage is 
calculated among the respondents, who participated in the 
subjective test in a particular position [7]. 
The best 3D video image quality is given by, according 
to test results, the PDP system. This fact could be associated 
with the highest native resolution of the one displayed image 
from the stereo pair (Table I).

B. Perceived Depth 
The second test question discussed in this paper is which 
system and configuration provides the highest depth 
perception. The answer for this could be, unlike the 
previous, theoretically calculated from the known viewing 
position under the condition that the same 3D content is 
displayed on the compared displays (Table II).  
The perceived depth ratio, which we have defined for 
this purpose as our own and original measure, gives an 
objective comparison of the 3D systems under given 
observation conditions. It is computed as follows (Fig. 7). 
At first, the perceived distance (dp) of static stereoscopic 
parallax is calculated. The value depends on pixel disparity 
(D), defined viewing distance (4h) and horizontal 
displacement (α). The pixel disparity increases with the 3D 
display diagonal size. Perceived depth ratio is then defined 
as normalized value of the dp to the viewing distance. From 
the results, the rows and their order in the Table II show, 
that the DLP projection should provide the highest 
perceived depth and the best stereoscopic effect to the 
viewer. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
described 
calculation 
is 
in 
contradiction with the test results (Fig. 8). The tested 
76

subjects consider PDP depth perception the highest. One of 
the aspects, where test results correspond to theoretical 
computations, is the lowest depth of LCD polarization 
system. How to explain the general difference? One 
hypothesis says that the stereo effect of DLP system may be 
so strong, that the brain of some part of respondents can not 
process it. We may also suppose that level of light, which 
has been changed during the subjective test, but 
intentionally not discussed in this paper, degrades the results 
of DLP system. Lighting conditions influences the quality 
of experience for sure and they are important topic for 
forthcoming investigation. In fact, variety of illumination 
during the test was set from 10 lx to 500 lx, but light 
conditions have not been strictly complied with ITU 
recommendation [9]. They have been specified as a most 
common and comparable with home environment and 
scenario.  
V. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
In this short paper, we presented a comparison of 
performance of present-day stereoscopic display systems by 
subjective testing. The aim of this short paper was not to 
bring complete study and present all the results from our 
subjective tests, but only describe the present commercial 
3D display technologies and then our methods, technical 
equipment, laboratory arrangement, definition of 3D video 
image content and group of observers. The results are very 
brief and evaluate just answers to the two questions from 
our complex questionnaire for the 3D video image quality 
and its subjective evaluation related to QoE.  
Within the evaluation and subjective testing of 3D 
systems that was discussed in this paper, we have also 
measured some objective parameters of the individual 
displays. The technological limitations of the used 3D 
systems were taken, such as the maximum useable 
displacement or crosstalk between the halves of stereo pair.  
The aim of our future work is to find and quantify all 
technological aspects of 3D video image quality and image 
depth to improve these parameters. Of course, our findings 
could have some discrepancies with theory and the data will 
be statistically processed in a more complex manner to find 
hidden dependences.
