Abstract—This paper summarises the work on organisational 
and network learning process among hospitals in Germany. It 
is a descriptive analysis of learning processes identified by 
interviews with board of directors and observations in clinical 
wards. A shift from organisational learning to inter-
organisational/network learning could be confirmed. This 
paper mentions some of them and gives an outlook on further 
work. 
Keywords-health services research; organisational learning; 
inter-organisational learning; hospitals; Germany. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The increase of knowledge and information is a general 
phenomenon and thus also applies to healthcare. Emerging 
cooperation between health care organisations (HCO) and in 
addition, Mergers & Acquisitions by highly integrated 
health care groups extends the organisational knowledge 
base even more and results in inter-organisational 
cooperation. In addition, medical schools and medical 
university hospitals represent key actors in medical 
knowledge development [1]. 
Organisational learning routines are key factors for 
learning HCO like hospitals in general [2] and clinical 
wards [3] but also for larger network structures [4]. This 
paper will present some newly identified organisational and 
inter-organisational learning routines from field studies in 
two running projects in German hospitals. 
In section 2, both projects, the methodology and data 
assessment are briefly introduced. Section 3 contains the 
results so far, separated into organisational and inter-
organisational/network level. Section 4 discusses the 
weaknesses of the approach and the comparison with the 
state of the art, especially Lipshitz/Popper [3]. The paper 
closes with conclusion and outlook in Section 5. 
II. 
METHODOLOGY AND DATA ASSESSMENT 
The project “Network on Health Services Research in the 
Metropolitan Region Bremen-Oldenburg” started on January 
1st 2014 with duration of 2 years [5]. A framework for semi-
structured interviews has been developed on several health 
related topics like cooperation, gaps in healthcare provision 
and knowledge processes. The knowledge process related 
questions are: 
• 
Organisational 
level: 
Are 
learning 
routines 
established between the clinical wards?  
• 
Inter-organisational/network 
level: 
Do 
these 
learning routines exist between the hospital and 
other health care organisations like family doctors, 
rehabilitation centres and other?  
• 
What is the role of information and communication 
technology for these learning processes? 
• 
What is the role of learning processes for patient 
care? 
 
Due to the design of the project, which has as a strategic 
task the initiation of a (research) network, it was decided to 
conduct interviews instead of performing a survey. For 
networking reasons it was important to get in personal 
contact with the board of directors. In addition, the 
researcher aimed at raising the answering rate by personal 
contact. Between April and October 2014 data from 22 
hospitals have been gathered, by only having 3 hospitals 
with negative feedback not willing to take part in the study. 
Interviewed persons have been from the board of directors, 
mostly chief executives and medical directors, sometimes 
with the nursing director.  
In addition, there are observations and interviews in 
context of a doctoral study. Three HCOs (two hospitals and 
one rehabilitation centre) are analysed by 1-2 day-
observation of clinical daily routine, supplemented by 
interviews with personnel from the observed wards. Up to 
now, seven wards have been observed and four interviews 
have 
been 
conducted. 
Additional 
information 
on 
methodology and results on the doctoral study can be found 
at [6] and [7]. 
III. 
RESULTS  
In this section the identified learning processes are listed 
and, if applicable further literature is indicated. They are 
distinguished 
between 
organisational 
and 
inter-
organisational 
level.

organisational level only refer to processes inside of the 
health care organisations. Inter-organisational learning 
processes occur when at least one professional health actor 
from outside the health care organisation is involved. 
A. Organisational level 
The following learning processes have been identified on 
the organisational level: 
• 
Morning/lunch conferences: these interdisciplinary 
conferences take place one or more times a week and 
bring 
together 
physicians 
from 
the 
general 
disciplines of internal medicine or surgery. These 
conferences are across clinical wards, e.g., in the 
internal medicine conference physicians from all 
sub-disciplines 
like 
cardiology, 
geriatrics, 
nephrology 
and 
others 
meet 
and 
discuss 
interdisciplinary or organisational issues. Sometimes 
these meetings are enriched by small presentations 
on a specific medical problem [7]. 
• 
ELearning applications: eLearning applications 
from different sources with focus on physicians 
(CME – continuous medical education) or nursing 
are also part of the organisational level domain 
inside a hospital (e.g., for Germany see [8]). 
• 
Conventions/closed-door meetings: these kinds of 
meetings also occur in hospitals in different 
manifestations. One complete ward (e.g., the 
cardiological ward) or one professional group (e.g., 
all surgeons’ assistants) come together for one or 
two-day meeting abroad and discuss strategic issues 
for the future and review the past period. This 
meeting can also be used in integrated healthcare 
groups (inter-organisational/network level), e.g., all 
geriatric physicians of all hospitals from one 
healthcare group meet once a year. 
• 
Interdisciplinary 
case 
conferences/clinical 
conferences: these conferences are organised e.g., 
once a week and difficult cases are discussed in an 
interdisciplinary 
matter 
[7]. 
They 
can 
be 
distinguished 
between 
internal 
medicine 
and 
surgery, but also conferences between these general 
disciplines are possible. The typical process starts 
with a physician having a difficult case and signs up 
the patient to the clinical conference. During the 
conference the patient’s case is discussed involving 
all necessary data and information (x-ray, laboratory 
results, etc.) and in the end, a recommendation is 
given to the enquiring physicians. 
• 
Radiological 
conference: 
Clinical 
radiological 
conferences 
are 
a 
modification 
of 
the 
interdisciplinary case conference. During this 
conference the radiological ward demonstrates the 
recent imaging (x-ray, x-ray computed tomography, 
magnetic resonance imaging) and discusses the 
results with the clinical wards, e.g., with the 
neurosurgical ward on neoplasms located in the 
brain and how to proceed. 
• 
Interdisciplinary therapeutically pathways/clinical 
pathways: These pathways are derived from medical 
guidelines (developed by medical societies) and 
adapted to the unique clinical context of a hospital. 
The adaption and introduction process is performed 
by interdisciplinary team of physicians and nurses; 
afterwards an interdisciplinary monitoring team 
controls 
the 
execution 
and 
initiates 
slight 
adjustments [9]. 
• 
M&M 
conference 
(mortality 
and 
morbidity 
conference): these meetings aim on retrospective 
analysis of patient’s data. The focus can be on 
medical errors, as well as on the teaching value [3] 
[10]. 
• 
Idea management: Established idea management 
processes are also implemented in healthcare 
organisations like hospitals. As in other branches 
they are an important factor for organisational 
improvements. 
• 
Critical Incident Reporting Systems (CIRS): CIRS 
are used for reporting critical (nonlethal) incidents in 
an anonymous manner. The anonymous way of 
reporting is intended to raise the rate of reporting 
incidents and protecting the reporting person [11]. 
• 
Surgical operation reflection meetings: this meetings 
aim on interaction and reflection between physicians 
(surgeons,  
anaesthetist) and other personnel 
involved in surgical operations like surgical nurses 
or surgeon’s assistants [3]. 
B. Inter-organisational/network level 
The following learning processes have been identified on 
the inter-organisational/network level: 
• 
Conventions/closed-door 
meetings: 
similar 
to 
conventions/closed-door meetings on organisational 
level (see Section III.A.). 
• 
Tumour conferences/tumour boards: Tumour boards 
refer to oncological diseases and cancer and are 
often carried out as interdisciplinary meetings. They 
connect 
clinical 
oncologists 
with 
residential 
physicians (family doctors and oncologists) in order 
to improve the compliance of the patient and 
guarantee ongoing care after hospital treatment [12].  
In rural areas with a low physician and/or population 
density, these meetings can be carried as remote 
meetings supported by tele- or videoconferences 
and/or electronic medical records [13].  
• 
Rehabilitation conferences: these conferences are 
similar to tumour boards but focus on rehabilitation. 
In Germany, clinical care/hospitals and rehabilitation 
are separated into two different sectors. For example, 
clinical geriatricians and rehabilitation geriatricians, 
in some cases complement by residential physicians, 
meet one a regular basis and discuss patients moving 
from the clinical sector to the rehabilitation sector. 
• 
Diseases-related 
regional 
networks: 
many 
healthcare organisations are active in disease-related 
networks, often with a regional focus. These 
54

eKNOW 2015 : The Seventh International Conference on Information, Process, and Knowledge Management

networks differ from hospital networks, mixed 
hospital-family physician networks and networks of 
family physicians. 
• 
Advanced education with network organisations: 
usually the hospitals offer their advanced education 
programme to their employees exclusively. In this 
case, selected parts of the programme are also 
offered 
to 
resident 
physicians, 
e.g., 
regular 
radiological trainings for clinical and resident 
radiologists or nursing trainings for multiple 
hospitals. 
• 
Tele-diagnosis: tele-diagnosis is a tele-medical 
application and refers to remote diagnosis. This is 
often used in rural areas or areas with low density of 
medical specialist or hospitals [14]. 
• 
Common 
Quality 
management 
with 
network 
partners: 
quality 
management 
(QM) 
is 
an 
established process in hospitals for many years. 
These QM systems can also be expanded to network 
partners like ambulatory health centres connected to 
a hospital. 
• 
Common ward conferences: in integrated healthcare 
groups regular ward conferences can be expanded to 
all group hospitals, possibly scaled by regional or 
other parameters, e.g., a group-wide conference of 
all neurological wards. 
• 
Common leadership of clinical wards among several 
hospitals: in integrated healthcare groups several 
hospitals may have one head physician for e.g., all 
geriatric wards. 
• 
Network CIRS: hospital-wide CIRS (see III.A) can 
be expanded to all hospitals of one healthcare group 
or to other connected organisations like ambulatory 
health centres. 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
A. Comparison with state of the art 
Lipshitz and Popper [3] have identified eleven 
organisational learning processes in hospital environments 
(they call them organisational learning mechanisms) in their 
early work. Table I gives an overview on the processes 
identified by Lipshitz/Popper and the processes verified 
during the interviews, including the frequency of 
occurrence. The occurrence is wrapped up by the 
participating 
hospitals 
and 
not 
by 
the 
individual 
interviewees.  
In addition, the following organisational learning 
routines have been identified during the interviews: 
• 
Interdisciplinary 
case 
conferences/clinical 
conferences: one hospital, also validated by 
interviews in two clinical wards. 
• 
Interdisciplinary therapeutically pathways/clinical 
pathways: one hospital also validated by interviews 
in one clinical ward. 
• 
Radiological 
conference: 
two 
hospitals, 
also 
validated by observations in three surgical wards. 
• 
Idea management: one hospital. 
The organisational learning processes on an inter-
organisational 
level 
had 
not 
been 
focussed 
by 
Lipshitz/Popper in the past. In particular, the inter-
organisational processes identified by interviews are listed 
in Table II. 
All other inter-organisational learning processes have 
been only mentioned once, this applies to: 
• 
Conventions/closed-door meetings 
• 
Rehabilitation conferences 
• 
Advanced education with network organisations 
• 
Tele diagnosis 
• 
Common 
Quality 
management 
with 
network 
partners 
• 
Common ward conferences 
• 
Common leadership of clinical wards among several 
hospitals 
• 
Network CIRS 
Li et. al. [19] performed a systematic review on 
communities of practice and also identified learning 
processes on an organisational and inter-organisational 
level. In particular these are fostered interaction between 
students and expert physicians, informal learning clubs 
(both on an organisational level), health care agency 
collaboration, and virtual communities over organisational 
borders (both on an inter-organisational level). All these 
processes have been identified by the interviews. 
B. Weaknesses/Gaps 
The interviews focussed on the board of directors. This 
implies some weaknesses: 
• 
The medical directors are from discipline, either one 
surgical oriented or one internal medicine discipline. 
This mind-set has an influence on the discussion 
results, e.g., a surgeon will more focus on surgical 
reflection meetings. Interdisciplinary process should 
be focussed by both disciplines. 
• 
There might be more learning processes in the 
distinct wards not being visible to the medical 
directors in their role as a board member, e.g., there 
are some specific geriatric processes like the multi-
professional geriatric team session [7]. For a 
complete overview, the interviews have to be 
conducted with at least all chief physicians of the 
relevant wards. Since the project focusses on a first 
overview this approach is acceptable. 
• 
There might be also learning processes in the distinct 
wards which are not visible to the board members in 
their role as managers in their wards. This can be 
coped with observations in the wards which are an 
approach in the associated doctoral studies [7]. In 
addition, there are some learning processes being 
naturally covered by the daily work in the wards, 
e.g., daily physician rounds, and, due to this, not 
being mentioned by the board of directors.

• 
Both approaches (interviews with chief physicians 
and observations) have a bigger demand on time and 
personnel resources than semi-structured interviews 
with the board of directors. For practical reasons a 
good balance between resources available and study 
objects to analyse needs to be defined. In the 
associated doctoral studies the observations and 
interviews with chief physicians are focussed on two 
hospitals and one rehabilitation centre and, since the 
studies have a focus on geriatrics, on the geriatric 
wards and the wards with the most important patient 
movements. 
V. 
CONCLUSION/OUTLOOK 
A. Conclusion 
Organisational learning in healthcare has evolved from 
an 
intra-organisational 
phenomenon 
to 
an 
inter-
organisational/network phenomenon in Germany. This is 
similar to developments in other countries. For instance, 
since the mid of the 1990s cancer networks have been 
emerging and fostering the inter-organisational exchange 
between involved physicians [15]. 
Another 
reason 
for 
emerging 
inter-organisational 
learning processes is enhanced cooperation between 
hospitals for economic reasons; on one hand more 
cooperation between hospitals on a regional level, one the 
other hand more integrated healthcare groups (e.g., Helios 
or Asklepios in Germany). In these settings, intra-
organisational learning processes have been adapted to the 
new network environment, e.g., CIRS originally used in 
distinct hospital settings and now used in healthcare groups. 
B. Outlook 
The interviews in the project Network on Health Services 
Research in the Metropolitan Region Bremen-Oldenburg 
will be continued, same applies to the work in context of the 
doctoral studies. 
Next step is the modelling of selected learning processes 
with a combined approach of 3LGM2 (Three-Layer Graph-
based Meta Model; developed for clinical IT architectures 
and hospital functions modelling [16]) and KMDL® 
(Knowledge Modelling and Description Language [17]; 
based on the knowledge conversion of Nonaka & Takeuchi 
[18]) which has already started [7]. Based on these future 
findings the velocity of knowledge dissemination will be 
measured and, if necessary, process remodelling proposals 
will be suggested. A best-practice transfer is also planned 
among the participating hospitals.
