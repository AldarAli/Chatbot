Abstract— System and software development and testing have
become more and more complex on the one hand and cost and
time sensitive on the other. The capability to execute processes
in an organized manner, as well as to be flexible and customer
responsive, is key to business success. One challenge for those
who want to manage the capabilities of their processes is that
lots of capability and maturity models are in the market. This
makes it hard to understand their business value and the
impacts of improvement campaigns. This paper describes an
approach how to deal with this problem.

INTRODUCTION
Software
Process
Improvement
and
Capability
dEtermination (SPICE) has been an Information Technology
(IT) topic for over 20 Years. With the exception of
Automotive SPICE [1] in the automotive domain and
ISO/IEC (International Organization for Standardization/
International Electrotechnical Commission) 15504 Part 6 in
the Dutch infrastructure industry [2], it does not seem like
ISO/IEC 15504 / ISO/IEC 330## (SPICE) and Capability
Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) have a lot of visible
impact in modern system, software and testing businesses.
One observable key point is that, by focusing on formal
points and capability levels, the original message got lost.
Process improvement drives business success. The influence
might be direct, e.g., change of effort structure by reducing
budgets and capacity for error correction and expanding the
budget and capability to deliver new features. Or the
influence may be indirect, by reducing business risks rising
from poor quality of deliverables or delay of the delivery
itself.
As the benefits are so clear, why are SPICE Assessments
not as common as it could be expected? The answer is that,
often, process knowledge is concentrated in so called
Software Process Engineering Groups (SEPG), which have
an observable tendency to create an ivory tower. These ivory
towers have the tendency to create complete, cumbersome
process models which are frustrating practitioners and are
not maintainable or adaptable at all. These models were
always criticized [3].
Another challenge is the cost consuming approach of
capability analysis. As there are lots of models on the
market, an organization might try to extract the building
blocks of the relevant models and recombine them to define
the individual analysis and improvement approach [4], but
this approach might create a constant research program that
will never pay back on individual organization level. Or, an
organization might run lots of uncoordinated assessment and
improvement campaigns which might create misalignments
and disorganization at working and management level.
One of the drivers behind this challenge is that lots of
SPICE Models like ISO/IEC 15504 Part 6, Automotive
SPICE and TestSPICE [5] are very focused on a defined
topic. As a consequence, an organization might have to pay
for many assessments which have overlapping topics and
overlapping findings.
One of the proposed benefits of every capability
measurement framework is that the capability of processes
will
be
measured
in
a
comparable
way,
allowing
organizations to define targets for process capability that
support business benefits.
By using the original ideas of the SPICE model, to
abstract process content from capability measurement, an
approach can be created that combines the business relevant
processes of all models and brings them into one complete
model. To safe cost and to focus on the real important points,
the approach also contains scalability features.
The rest of the paper si structured as follows.

SETTING THE CONTEXT
In 2010, the SPI Manifesto [6] was launched. It shows
the modern thinking of Process Improvement (PI) describing
core values and principles, as indicated in Figure 1.

These values are explained by a set of principles (see
Figure 2.) that give guidance to improve the achievement of
these values. Each principle is explained in detail in a later
section of the SPI Manifesto.
Figure 2. SPI Manifesto Principles
The presented approach is based mostly on the principle
“use dynamic and adaptable models as needed”. By doing
this, the approach also contributes to the principle “support
the organisations vision and objectives”.
III.
TAKING THE SOURCES OF THE APPROACH:
INCORPORATED MODELS AND CAPABILITY FRAMEWORKS
The presented
approach
incorporates the following
models as a source:
1)
ISO/IEC 15504 Part 5 [7]
2)
ISO/IEC 15504 Part 6
3)
Automotive SPICE 3.1
4)
TestSPICE 4.0
It also incorporates ISO/IEC 33020 [8] as capability
measurement framework
A. ISO/IEC 15504 Part 6
ISO/IEC 15504 Part 6 (Systems Engineering) was
developed with a strong view on the organisations capacity
to deliver large scale projects. Therefore, this model always
had a strong focus on the business environment. The
assessment model is based on ISO/IEC 15288 [9] as process
reference model and incorporates the ISO/IEC 15504 Part 2
[10] as measurement framework. Due to the architecture of
the whole SPICE approach, this can be easily replaced by
ISO/IEC 33020.
The model shows the typical structure of process groups
and processes. This structure makes it easier to understand
the model and to set the right scope for process assessments.
The model contains the following process groups:

Organisational Project Enabling Processes

Agreement processes

Project Processes

Technical Processes

Tailoring Processes
The whole model is presented in Figure 3.
Figure 3. The process model of ISO/IEC 15504 Part 6
Reviewing modern literature about business agility,
portfolio management is reported as one cornerstone of
success [11].
B. ISO/IEC 15504 Part 5
ISO/IEC 15504 Part 5 (Software Engineering) was
developed with a strong view on the capacity to deliver
software projects of all types. Therefore, this model always
had a strong focus on the software development lifecycle.
The assessment model is based on ISO/IEC 12207 as process
reference model and incorporates the ISO/IEC 15504 Part 2
as measurement framework. Due to the architecture of the
whole SPICE approach, this can be easily replaced by
ISO/IEC 33020.
The model has the highest level of completeness
regarding systems and software development.
The whole model is presented in Figure 4.
Figure 4. The process model of ISO/IEC 15504 Part 5
The model is -as ISO/IEC 15504 Part 6- Departed in
Process groups and processes.
The following process groups are included:

Agreement Processes

Organizational Project Enabling Processes

Project Processes

Technical Processes


Software Implementation Process

Software Support Process

Software Reuse Process.
C. Automotive SPICE (3.1)
Automotive SPICE (newest version 3.1) is the process
assessment model of the German automotive industry. While
having incorporated the system and software development
processes of ISO/IEC 15504 Part 6, the model has a strong
emphasis on the acquisition processes. They are much more
detailed than in ISO/IEC 15504 Part 5 or Part 6. In addition,
the German Verband der Automobilindustrie, Qualitäts
Management Center (VDA QMC) developed a rating
guideline for Automotive SPICE which highlights many
interdependencies between the process components of each
level.
Automotive SPICE uses the ISO/IEC 33020 as capability
measurement framework. Earlier versions used ISO/IEC
15504 Part 2.
The whole model is presented in Figure 5.
Figure 5. The process model of Automotive SPICE 3.1
The structure of the model consists of processes and
process groups. The following process groups are defined:

Acquisition Process Group

Supply Process Group

System Engineering Process Group

Software Engineering Process Group

Supporting Process Group

Management Process Group

Reuse Process Group

Process Improvement Process Group.
D. TestSPICE (4.0)
TestSPICE (newest version 4.0) is an independently
developed process assessment model for testing processes,
based on the ISTQB Syllabus and the ISO/IEC 29119
process model.
TestSPICE
is
completely
focused
on
the
testing
processes, designed to plug in to other SPICE based process
assessment models.
TestSPICE incorporates the ISO/IEC 15504 Part 2 as
measurement framework. Due to the architecture of the
whole SPICE approach, this can be easily replaced by
ISO/IEC 33020.
TestSPICE also includes an agile extension to support the
assessment of agile capabilities.
The whole model is presented Figure 6.
Figure 6. The process model of TestSPICE 4.0
E. The capability measurement framework ISO/IEC 33020
The capability measurement framework of ISO/IEC
33020 consists of 6 Levels divided in 9 process attributes.

IV.
COMMON COMPONENTS OF SPICE PROCESS
ASSESSMENT MODELS
To create a combined approach of several SPICE models,
a set of common building blocks is needed that supports
adaptability and scalability.
The following components are common in all SPICE
models:
•
1 Process Assessment Model
o 1 Process Reference Model

1-n process groups
•
1-n processes (Specific / Overarching)

o
1 purpose
o
1-n outcomes
o
1-n process related indicators

Base practices

Input/Output Workproducts
o 1-n levels

0-n Process Attributes
•
1 Indicator set
o
1-n generic practices
o
1-n generic work products
o
1-n generic resources
ISO/IEC 15504 Part 5 or TestSPICE 4.0 use overarching
processes. An overarching process summarizes a complete
process group by using the processes of the group as base
practices (or an equivalent mapping). As an example, there is
an acquisition process, and there are sub-processes that are
linked to the overarching process by name (AGR.1 BP.3
“Select Supplier” to AGR.1C Supplier selection) or by
content base practices of the overarching process map to
base practices of the sub-processes, but sub-processes
provide more details.
V.
USING COMMON COMPONENTS TO ALIGN ASSESSMENT
MODELS WITH BUSINESS NEEDS
These common set of components allows several levels
of adoption combined into one approach:
1)
Combine
processes
of
several
models
(e.g.
acquisition
processes
of
automotive
SPICE
and
organisational management of ISO/IEC 15504 Part 6) to
have the right set of processes at hand.
2)
Define
the
target
capabilities
of
the
selected
processes in order to achieve the necessary or expected
business support (a standardized process supports fast acting
teams and allows to quickly reconfigure teams, but its
development might require some budget and its deployment
might restrict creative ad hoc solutions).
3)
Define if overarching or detailed processes will be
assessed.
4)
Define the in depth of process assessments. It
makes a huge difference in cost and effort if an assessment
team just checks if the process purpose is met and quickly
gathers strengths and weaknesses, or if the team has to
deliver an in-depth report reflecting purpose, outcomes and
all types of indicators.
This approach supports the way of process improvement
as described in ISO/IEC 15504 Part 4 or ISO/IEC 33014.
Both standards recommend to 1st check influences on the
business as given from the business ecosystem or from
technological innovations, and next define a target profile.
The profile can be expressed in capability levels, as
described in ISO/IEC 33020.
Having the targets set, an assessment team will analyse to
what degree the targets are met and if gaps create immediate
business impact or business-related risks.
VI.
CONCLUSION
Using
SPICE
Assessments
in
an
inflexible
and
bureaucratic manner was on potential cause of decrease of
usage of assessments. Consequently, binding SPI to business
success and using a very flexible way to plan and execute
assessments might be the first steps for a comeback.
