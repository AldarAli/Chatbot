Abstract—A Personal Health Record (PHR) is a promising 
technology for improving the quality of chronic disease 
management. Despite the efforts that have been made in a 
research project to develop a PHR for patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus in primary care (e-Vita), differences have 
been reported between the number of registered users in the 
participating primary practices. To gain insight into the 
factors that influence the implementation of the PHR into daily 
health care processes and into the possibilities to improve the 
content, interviews have been conducted with participating 
primary practice nurses and other stakeholders in the research 
project. A first impression of the interviews indicated that in 
many cases, the low impact of the PHR is due to a lack of 
information about the purpose, content and use of the system.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
A. Personal Health Records 
The aging population and increased prevalence of chronic 
care requires an integral approach to disease management 
that is well coordinated and consistent with (inter)national 
care standards in order to support a shift from 
institutionalized care to home care [1-3]. Disease 
management may be viewed as a set of interrelated services 
that spans from prevention and self-management to 
intramural care for patients with chronic diseases [4-6]. 
Information- and communication technology (eHealth) will 
play an important role in disease management, e.g. in 
providing online support for self-management, in improving 
information exchange among professionals and with 
patients, as well as in monitoring the performance of the 
disease management program [7, 8]. 
The electronic personal health record (PHR) is a 
promising technology for improving the quality of chronic 
disease management [9, 10]. A PHR can be defined as “an 
electronic application through which individuals can access, 
manage, and share their health information and that of 
others for whom they are authorized, in a private, secure and 
confidential environment” [11], a definition that is adopted 
by many researchers over the years (e.g., [12-14]). 
However, PHRs are becoming more complex and 
potential functions of current PHRs may not only include 
sharing clinical and personal data (e.g. history, test results, 
treatment, appointments), but may also include self-
management support, patient-provider communication, 
information about the illness, peer support or monitoring 
health behavior data [13].  
Potential benefits of a PHR include empowering patients 
in managing their diseases and the reduction of geographical 
and communication barriers. This may, in turn, lead to a 
transition from episodic to continuous care, which has the 
potential to shorten the time to address disease-related 
complaints that may arise [12, 13].  
Despite these benefits, the use of such systems in diabetes 
care has only led to small improvements in diabetes quality 
measures that were of marginal clinical relevance [9], and 
up to now, evaluations have only provided little insight into 
why a particular outcome did occur [15, 16]. Consequently, 
the added value of the existing evidence is often limited for 
decision making in relation to the strategic direction of 
implementation efforts [17]. To gain insight into factors that 
contribute to a successful implementation of eHealth 
technologies in daily health care processes, it is necessary to 
look for methodological approaches that go beyond a before 
and after measurement of health outcomes. 
 
B. The CeHRes Roadmap 
The CeHRes Roadmap [18] is a framework that can be 
used to evaluate and improve existing eHealth technologies. 
The roadmap states that eHealth development is a 
participatory process and that development is intertwined 
with implementation into daily health care processes. Also, 
it requires continuous evaluation cycles. Through a 
contextual inquiry and a value specification, a support basis 
can be created for the development and implementation of 
the eHealth technology.  
 
C. e-Vita 
The PHR e-Vita is an initiative of the Dutch foundation 
Care Within Reach, a partnership between Philips and

Achmea, a Dutch health insurance company. Currently, the 
main content of e-Vita consists of insight into personal 
health data (e.g., lab values, blood pressure), self-
monitoring health values (e.g., weight), education and a 
coach for reaching personal health-related goals. e-Vita is 
deployed in primary care in the Netherlands via a trial to 
study the effects of using a PHR in primary care for patients 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (ClinicalTrials.gov 
number NCT01570140). 
Despite the efforts that have been made to develop a 
technology that has added value in the treatment of patients 
with T2DM in primary care, we signaled differences in the 
uptake and impact of e-Vita between the participating 
primary practices in the research project. To gain insight 
into the factors that influence the use of e-Vita in primary 
care, an evaluation via interviews has been conducted. 
These interviews serve as both a forward (contextual inquiry 
and value specification) and a backward evaluation to gain 
insight into the uptake and impact of e-Vita, as well as into 
the possibilities to improve the content of e-Vita according 
to health care providers. The outcome of the interviews will 
provide critical factors for the improvement of the content 
and the implementation process of e-Vita in primary care. 
The main research question is: 
 
What factors influence the uptake and impact of a PHR for 
patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in primary health 
care, according to primary health care workers and other 
stakeholders? 
 
In the next paragraphs, we will describe the methods and the 
preliminary results of the interview study. In the discussion, 
we elaborate on future research. 
 
II. 
METHODS 
A. Participants 
The interview study consists of two parts. In the first 
part, primary care nurses (PNs) of general practices in 
Drenthe, in the north of the Netherlands, were invited to 
participate in an interview. In the Netherlands, PNs are 
responsible for educating patients about their disease, 
guiding patients with the use of medication and lifestyle 
changes and performing health checks. In the e-Vita project, 
all selected PNs are responsible for explaining the purpose 
of e-Vita to the participants in the study and administering 
questionnaires regarding the effects of the PHR. No 
guidelines for intended use in daily care processes were 
defined.  
To reveal the differences between the implementation 
processes of practices with high and low numbers of 
participants, potential practices were selected for the 
interview study by the means of an inclusion percentage 
(high, middle, low). The inclusion percentage was  
calculated as follows:  
Inclusion percentage = 
(number of included patients for e-Vita in the study / total 
number of patients with T2DM in the practice)*100. 
 
The aim is to conduct five interviews in every group, 15 
interviews in total. When primary practices have indicated 
before that the inclusion of participants was postponed due 
to explainable circumstances (e.g. long-term diseases among 
the staff), practices were not contacted to participate in the 
interview study.  
In the second part of the study, five other stakeholders in 
the e-Vita diabetes project (e.g. project leaders) will be 
invited to answer questions about their view on the topics as 
revealed in the first part of this study and the choices that 
have been made regarding these topics during the project. 
 
B. Design and Procedure 
First, 
semi-structured 
in-depth 
interviews 
were 
conducted among PNs that already take part in the e-Vita 
project. During the interviews, questions were asked 
regarding the purposes, reasons and incentives to use and 
implement a PHR in their primary practice, the use and the 
users of the PHR so far, the bottlenecks and barriers that are 
encountered or expected, the results so far and the way that 
a PHR will change the primary health care for patients with 
T2DM and their caregivers in the future. All PNs received a 
gift voucher of 50 euros for participating. 
Based on the identified themes, a second interview 
scheme will be prepared for other stakeholders in the e-Vita 
project (e.g., project leaders). These interviews will be used 
to test the topics as discussed during the interviews among 
the PNs. These questions are asked via e-mail and validated 
by telephone. Ethical approval for this study was obtained 
by the ethics committee of the University of Twente.  
 
C. Analyses 
All interviews (among PNs as well as the other 
stakeholders) will be transcribed and themes and categories 
will subsequently be coded via open coding, axial coding 
and selective coding [19]. In this way, recurring themes and 
items of interest regarding the implementation and use of 
eHealth technologies in primary health care practice can be 
identified.  
 
III. 
PRELIMINARY RESULTS 
A first impression of the eleven interviews among PNs so 
far indicated that, despite respondents’ enthusiasm, the PHR 
has a rather low reach.  In many cases, this is due to a lack 
of information about the purpose, content and use of the 
PHR. The participating PNs were mostly trained to 
administer the questionnaires in the research project and 
little attention has been gone to the content of e-Vita and the 
integration of the PHR in daily health care routines. Also,

PNs reported that they find it difficult to promote a platform 
they hardly know.   
Second, little thought has gone towards the integration of 
PHRs with other health care systems and the integration of 
the PHRs with national guidelines for the treatment of 
chronic diseases in primary care.   
 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
In the current research project, we signaled differences 
between the inclusion percentages of the participating 
primary care practices. The goal of this study is therefore to 
identify the factors that influence the uptake and impact of a 
PHR for patients with T2DM in primary health care. 
Because the PNs are responsible for promoting the PHR e-
Vita among their patients, we  identified the bottlenecks for 
the implementation of a PHR in primary care from the view 
of PNs.  
We believe that the development of eHealth technologies 
is an ongoing process that requires continuous evaluations. 
We therefore conducted both a forward and a backward 
evaluation in order to not only gain insight into the factors 
that influence the uptake and impact of a PHR, but also to 
identify possibilities for improving the content of the PHR 
in the future.  
To understand the choices that have been made regarding 
the process of development and implementation of the PHR 
so far, recurring themes in the interviews with PNs will be 
tested among the other stakeholders in the e-Vita project. To 
gain insight into the developmental course of the e-Vita, this 
evaluation cycle is planned to be repeated in the next two 
years.  
Because 
we 
feel 
that 
the 
development 
and 
implementation of eHealth technologies is a matter of co-
creation, we plan to involve both health care providers and 
patients as potential end-users. Therefore, we will also plan 
interviews with patients to gain insight into the factors that 
influence the use of the platform.  
At this moment (November 2013), the interviews among 
the PNs, eleven in total, are conducted. The results of the 
first part of the study are expected in January 2014. The 
results of the second part of the study are expected in March 
2014.
