Abstract — This paper describes the concept of the resource 
management strategy in ad hoc networks for rescue 
operations. The presented strategy is a result of the new 
outlook on the IEEE 802.11 networks capabilities and 
performance enhancement. The proposed solution is dedicated 
to real time services support and is based on the concept of the 
Resource Manager that organizes and controls the whole 
traffic in the network. Novel procedures were developed and 
applied in order to organize the network and manage the real 
time 
traffic. 
A 
method 
of 
the 
available 
bandwidth 
measurement and estimation was introduced. Large scale 
simulations for different numbers of Voice over IP (VoIP) 
sources and various voice codecs have been carried out. They 
show the increase of channel utilization reaching over 80% and 
significant growth of the network capacity.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
For over ten years a permanent development of IEEE 
802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) is being 
observed [1]. Among the many advantages they offer, users 
appreciated the convenience and simplicity when accessing 
the network and establishing high data rate wireless 
connection. Thanks to a low cost and a small size of devices, 
nowadays they seem too ubiquitous. WLAN drivers are 
embedded in many different devices like notebooks, mobile 
phones, Personal Data Assistants (PDAs), cameras, etc. 
Despite the fact that WLANs were originally designed for 
data transport, today it is also demanded of them to be 
efficient for real time services support. 
Another advantage of WLANs results from the ad hoc 
mode, which is a method for wireless devices to directly 
communicate with each other. Operating in ad hoc mode 
allows all wireless devices within each other’s range to 
discover and communicate in a peer-to-peer manner without 
involving the central access point. This mode offers mobility 
and communications between users in areas without 
infrastructure or in all places with damaged infrastructure. 
From this point of view, WLANs operating in ad hoc mode 
can be a very promising solution for users, such as the fire 
brigade, rescue team, police squad or small military unit 
[2,3]. The possible scenario is to use the ad hoc network for 
public-safety or search-and-rescue operations. 
An important issue for such network is the ability to 
support cooperation between two or more emergency 
services, e.g., the fire brigade, police squad, rescue team, 
medical service. On the other hand, it must be stressed that 
the performance of the network decreases as the number of 
wireless users grows. For that reason, a smart mechanism 
should be introduced, which allows topology control and 
network scalability [4]. 
The effect of the hidden node is one of the most difficult 
problems to solve, because it is intrinsic to the nature of the 
WLANs. The RTS/CTS mechanism is not recommended for 
the transmission of small packets, e.g. VoIP. A possible 
solution is to use an additional signaling channel, however it 
requires changes in the physical layer. This issue was widely 
discussed in [14,15]. 
When considering the hierarchical structure of the 
command system of the emergency services, different ranks 
of users should be taken into account. This will affect the 
priority of users, as well as the type of allowed services. 
Among many wireless solutions, IEEE 802.11 networks 
seem to be the most popular. Although the most common 
weakness of WLANs is the insufficient support of the real 
time services [5,6], the authors formulated a new outlook on 
the IEEE 802.11b network capability and possible 
performance enhancement. Despite the fact that there is a 
wide range of WLANs specifications, the issue of network 
optimization still remains open. QoS mechanisms were the 
subject of the IEEE 802.11e standard [7]. However, these 
mechanisms cannot guarantee the quality of services, 
although they slightly improve the network efficiency [8]. 
The voice capacity of IEEE 802.11 networks is gaining 
increasing attention in the literature. Methods of VoWiFi 
optimization, including voice codec negotiation, audio 
packets aggregation as well as the MAC protocol adaptation, 
can be found in many papers. In [8], the influence of the 
MAC protocol on the network performance was shown. This 
protocol operates in contention mode and thus inevitably 
introduces the PHY layer overheads, Backoff and protective 
periods, ACK frames and retransmissions in some cases. In 
[9], authors analyzed the effect of the coding rate and packet 
15

size on the voice capacity of the Distributed Coordination 
Function (DCF). 
In [10], dynamic CW adaptation was suggested in order 
to minimize the number of collisions. The idea of the voice 
coding bit rate adaptation to the available network bandwidth 
was described in [22]. Results of experiments confirmed the 
efficiency of the new scheme. The impact of different 
configuration parameters on the ad-hoc network performance 
was presented in [23]. Following parameters were analyzed, 
the type of codec, packetization interval and the data rate. In 
[24], authors presented the results of the capacity 
measurement of the IEEE 802.11e network for each access 
category. They also analyzed the effect of the TCP traffic on 
VoIP streams. In conclusion, they stated that 802.11e 
standard can protect the quality of VoIP if there is TCP 
traffic added. However, it can not improve the capacity of 
the network. 
Although proposed methods can improve network 
efficiency, the question as to how to guarantee the quality of 
services still remains open [13]. Furthermore, there is still a 
lack of an efficient Call Admission Control (AC) mechanism 
[12,13]. The present article is an attempt to fill this gap. 
This paper presents the general concept of the resource 
management 
strategy 
and 
provides 
information 
on 
introduced procedures. All proposed mechanisms are 
connected with each other and interact within a individual 
device as well as within the whole network. 
The rest of the paper deals with the concept and 
assumptions (Section 2), the description of the proposed 
mechanisms (Section 3), simulation results and their 
discussion (Section 4), conclusions (Section 5) and future 
work (Section 6). 
II. CONCEPT AND ASSUMPTIONS 
In the case under consideration, the aim of the network 
optimization is to get as high as possible number of VoIP 
streams with guaranteed voice quality. The assumed network 
operates in ad hoc mode and consists of small group of users, 
e.g., fire brigade or rescue team. In emergency situations 
they typically use voice communication. Therefore the 
authors made an assumption that there is only one type of 
service, namely VoIP. 
Users have different ranks, which determines some 
differences between priorities. Thus, the trade off between 
the available bandwidth, the allowed number and the rank of 
users is introduced intentionally. 
The network model assumes WLAN based solution. The 
authors decided to use the IEEE 802.11b standard as offering 
good throughput and modulations more resistant to 
interferences, which is a real advantage of the network 
operating in ad hoc mode. MAC QoS mechanisms defined in 
the IEEE 802.11e standard were also taken into account. 
These mechanisms are a good starting point to enable 
prioritization and bandwidth reservation in ad hoc network 
[12,13]. In particular, the authors introduced the adaptation 
of a Contention Window (CW) size to the type of  frame and 
the rank of the user. 
Another issue concerns the optimal balance between the 
traffic load and the services quality in ad-hoc networks. 
It is expected that the proposed range of adaptation and 
introducing of new mechanisms will not demand a high cost 
of implementation and will be feasible. 
Fig. 1 illustrates the concept of efficiency improvement 
of WLAN for VoIP support. The available bandwidth level 
is the main factor allowing assessment of the traffic load in 
the network. Cross-layer mechanisms are crucial for network 
performance improvement. They enable the RT traffic 
shaping or MAC adaptation if the available bandwidth is too 
small or if the level of service is not satisfactory. The CAC 
mechanism prevents new VoIP calls if the available 
bandwidth level is too low. 
 
 
Figure 1.  Performance enhancement of WLAN for VoIP support. 
In the proposed solution, the network consists of different 
rank users. For the sake of simplicity, high rank users shall 
be denoted as special users while the rest shall be referred to 
as commercial users. It perfectly corresponds to the scenario 
of the humanitarian aid, when volunteers help people in 
service. Another example can be the situation when the fire 
brigade, police and civilians cooperate within small groups 
while strengthening an embankment during a flood. 
However, if the available bandwidth is too small, special 
users prevail over the network. Eventually, the lowest rank 
users can be completely blocked. 
A separate question is how to assess the resources of the 
network, e.g. channel utilization. Since ad-hoc networks are 
bandwidth limited, not all measurement methods can be 
applied [15-17].

Fig. 2 illustrates the extended protocol stack with cross-
layer interactions. Bandwidth Prediction Control Protocol 
(BPCP) allows monitoring of parameters in the physical 
layer, to measure the channel utilization level and also to 
switch MAC protocol states, as explained in subsequent 
sections. RT traffic shaping relays on codec negotiation and 
audio packets aggregation. Closed Network Mode is based 
on the concept of the Resource Manager that controls traffic 
in the network. 
A. Bandwidth Estimation 
The available bandwidth is crucial for optimization of the 
Wi-Fi ad-hoc network. Therefore, the authors proposed to 
implement BPCP that enables to measure the channel 
utilization level and to estimate the available bandwidth. 
BPCP takes advantage of WLAN card drivers that enable 
the measurement of SNR in the PHY layer and BER 
calculation, and passing these parameters to the Data Link 
Layer. If nodes operate in promiscuous mode, they can 
receive all the traffic sent across the network. As a result, the 
bandwidth utilization is assessed in all nodes of the network 
independently and continuously for predefined periods called 
Sampling Intervals. 
From the PHY layer point of view, stations can detect the 
channel state (idle or busy - which means transmission) and 
if they operate in promiscuous mode, they can receive and 
process all frames. The type of received frames (RTS, CTS, 
DATA, ACK) is recognized in the data link layer. 
Knowing the bit rate and the length of received frames it 
is possible to calculate their transmission duration in the 
radio channel, denoted as tAF in (1).

Fig.4 shows the extended WLAN sublayer of the mobile

total traffic load as well as the available bandwidth.

To assess the network throughput in a contention mode, 
theoretical analysis was performed and simulations were 
made using the OMNET++ v4.0 simulation tool. 
For the purposes of analysis and simulation, the 
following parameters were assumed: G.711 voice codec; 
typical protocol headers (MAC header = 30B, IPv4 header 
=20B, UDP header = 8B); free space propagation model and 
lack of mobility. The issue of mobility is crucial for NRM 
determination and is the topic of further study.

The results of the simulation are presented in Fig. 5. 
Normal distribution of a throughput estimator was assumed, 
as well as a confidence interval with α=0.1 and β=1.64 (for 
cumulative distribution function equal to 0.9). 
The period of time required for the transmission of one 
data frame and the acknowledging frame takes nearly 1,8ms. 
For that reason it is possible to send 11 acknowledged 
frames during one second. Audio packets are generated by 
codec periodically every 20ms. Assuming that stations work 
synchronously, i.e., after the first one had transmitted a 
packet, the second one generates it, then it is possible to

obtain the network throughput equal to 1,3Mb/s, Fig. 5. 
Higher traffic load will cause an increase of the collision rate 
and a drop in network efficiency.

B. MAC Protocol States 
At the beginning of the operation, special stations can 
cooperate with commercial and use standard access schemes, 
until BPCP detects the insufficient bandwidth and initiates 
the Acquisitive Mode (AM).  
During AM mode, the Backoff interval is minimized 
according to the rank of the user. As a result, special stations 
prevail over the network. Only a small part of the bandwidth 
can be hard-won by remaining users. To determine the 
Backoff interval, the Contention Window parameter is used, 
however different values have been introduced, depending 
on the rank of the user and the type of frame (Control, Data, 
Broadcast or RTData). 
If the available bandwidth is still too small, BPCP 
triggers a mechanism called the Network Self-Organizing 
Mechanism, which is responsible for creating a Closed 
Network Mode. From this moment on, Wi-Fi network 
operates in a point-coordinated mode. Fig. 6. presents the 
states of MAC protocol for the proposed protocol extension 
 
Figure 6.  MAC protocol states. 
An important issue is to determine the proper level of 
channel utilization for triggering between MAC AM and 
Closed Network Mode. To resolve this problem, the authors 
applied the Pareto optimization approach. 
Simulation results obtained for 2Mbit/s data rate and 
G.711 voice codec are presented below. 
Fig. 7 shows the network throughput vs. traffic load. 
Triggering levels are also presented. If the throughput 
reaches limit denoted by B, the station switches from 
standard mode to AM. If it reaches another limit denoted by 
C, the station switches to Closed Network Mode. Fig. 8 
presents collisions vs. traffic load. The critical level of 
collisions is denoted by A. This information may be used 
additionally by BPCP.

Results of simulations performed in order to estimate the 
acceptable number of VoIP connections, depending on the 
type of voice codec and MAC protocol parameters in a 
contention mode, were widely discussed in literature 
[9,10,19,20]. However, the question where and how to 
implement the AC mechanism and how to manage the traffic 
in the network still remains open. The AC mechanism is 
necessary to prevent new calls if there is not enough 
bandwidth. In a contention mode, stations are not aware of 
the traffic load and try to transmit frames every time they 
have a packet to send. For this reason, a Closed Network 
Mode was proposed with a station named the Network 
Resource Manager (NRM) that manages the network. 
III. CLOSED NETWORK MODE 
A. Network Self-Organizing Mechanism 
At the beginning, all stations work in a contention mode 
with standard parameters, Fig. 9. In the background, 
Neighbor Discovery Procedure is performed, which is based 
on broadcasting Neighbor Request and Neighbor Response 
frames [21]. This procedure allows recognition of the 
surroundings by collecting data from other nodes, namely: 
received signal strength and noise, battery level and rank of 
the station. Based on this information, each station 
determines its own NRM Readiness coefficient, which 
describes whether the station is ready to play a network 
manager role. This mechanism is still under implementation 
in OMNET++ v4.0. 
18

If BPCP again detects the insufficient bandwidth 
coincidence, a station changes the mode to AM, while 
Neighbor Discovery Procedure is still in the background, 
Fig. 9. When a first station detects the insufficient 
bandwidth, it initiates Network Self-Organizing Mechanism 
(NSOM). Only stations with a certain NRM Readiness 
coefficient are allowed to participate in this phase. If 
necessary, information on the network topology is refreshed 
by sending Neighbour Request frame, which contains the last 
NRM Readiness coefficient of the sending station. When 
these frames are exchanged, the station with the highest 
coefficient sends a Request for RT frame. From this moment 
on, the network operates in a Closed Network Mode and all 
traffic is controlled by the resource manager till NRM 
Timeout elapses and the procedure for NRM Determination 
starts again, Fig. 10.

B. Real Time Traffic Management 
When the NRM station is determined, it sends a 
NRM Request broadcast frame informing that nodes are 
allowed to call for a bandwidth reservation. Some stations 
respond with RT Confirm frames if they have RT packets to 
send. The NRM Request frame is sent periodically to 
disseminate the list of queued stations and also the current 
queue limit, Fig. 10. A more detailed description of the 
algorithm can be found in [18].

If the queue limit is reached or NRM Req Timeout has 
elapsed, the NRM station sends a RT Queue frame 
containing: 
• 
queue size: number of STAs in queue, 
• 
number of cycles: number of queue repetition, 
• 
voice codec type, 
• 
data rate, 
• 
MAC address and order of stations in the queue. 
After receiving the RT Queue frame, the first station on 
the list is allowed to transmit after DIFS and receives an 
ACK frame after SIFS, Fig. 11. The next station in queue 
transmits data frame after DIFS. The number of cycles 
describes how long nodes will transmit data in a given order. 
After each transmission of DATA and ACK, stations 
decrease their TransmissionIndex and are allowed to send 
after it reaches zero. After a predefined number of cycles, the 
NRM station again sends a NRM Request frame to give a 
chance to transmit for stations that were out of queue during 
the preceding period.

An unpredictable NRM termination may occur, e.g. as a 
result of depletion of the battery, which should be taken into 
account. In such a situation nodes will detect a lack of frames 
from NRM for the assumed timeout. Since this moment on, 
the station with the second highest NRM Readiness 
coefficient starts playing this role.  
In order to organize a closed network and manage RT 
traffic, the following management frames were introduced: 
• 
Neighbor Request and Neighbor Response - for 
neighborhood discovering, 
• 
NRM Request - for initiation of the RT traffic 
queuing phase, 
• 
RT Confirm - for the bandwidth reservation, 
• 
RT Queue - distribution of RT traffic queue. 
The detailed description of the management frames 
structure can be found in [18]. Because all of these frames 
are of a broadcast type, all receiving stations are forced to 
process it in the data link layer, although acknowledgement 
is not sent. The structure of new frames is the same as 
defined in the IEEE 802.11 standard for management frames 
and consists of MAC Header and Frame Body containing 
information fields. The maximum size and capacity of 
frames are presented in Table III.

In order to assess the time required to organize the RT

assumed that NRM is determined, avg. Backoff is equal to

If the data rate is set to 1Mbit/s, one cycle required to 
schedule the RT traffic takes approximately 14ms and this 
period reaches 10ms if the data rate increases to 2Mbit/s. 
Assuming some collisions, this duration should not exceed 
20ms. 
Synchronous RT data transmission in a Closed Network 
Mode can be verified by using an analytical as well as 
simulation model. For the sake of convenience, e.g. in order 
to apply different input parameters, the authors used 
COMNET 3 simulation tool.  
The aim of simulations was to assess the channel 
utilization and the number of possible simultaneous VoIP 
calls as a function of the data rate. The following 
assumptions were made: 
• 
network stations with commercial voice codec 
(G.711) with attributes defined in Table I, 
• 
MAC/PHY parameters: SIFS = 10µs, DIFS = 50µs, 
PLCP Header + Preamble = 192µs,  
• 
packets with standard protocol headers: MAC  = 
30B, IPv4  =20B, UDP  = 8B. 
The channel utilization vs. the number of VoIP calls and 
various data rates was shown in Fig. 13 and Fig. 14. 
In the phase of synchronous RT data transmission, there 
are only two cases when the channel is idle: DIFS which 
precedes data frame transmission and SIFS between data and 
ACK frames.

Figure 14.  Channel utilization vs. number of VoIP streams for G.726 voice 
codec (32kbit/s). 
An increasing number of VoIP connections leads to a 
linear growth of channel utilization, up to 90%. Better 
channel utilization is unachievable. This is a result of the fact 
that although the number of frames sent in a given period 
increases for higher data rates, there are still constant idle 
periods that separate frames. 
The delay of RT packets results from the data rate and 
the sequence number of a given station in the whole queue. 
Thus, this delay does not exceed two dozens of milliseconds. 
When the data rate grows, the time needed for transmission 
of one frame becomes shorter, while DIFS and SIFS remain 
on the same level. Therefore it is possible to set up more 
VoIP connections, however the channel utilization cannot 
exceed 90%.When G.711 codec is used and the data rate is 
set up to 11Mb/s, up to 27 VoIP calls are available. 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
We have presented the concept of the resource 
management strategy in ad-hoc networks for rescue 
operations. This strategy is a result of the new outlook on the 
802.11 WLANs capabilities and performance enhancement. 
A set of novel procedures was developed with a view of 
organizing the network and managing the real time traffic. 
These procedures were validated analytically and by 
simulations, and results were included. The proposed method 
of the available bandwidth measurement and estimation 
works correctly.  
The procedure of RT data synchronous transmission in a 
Closed Network Mode was verified by simulation. Results of 
tests allowed estimating the channel utilization achieving 
over 80% when synchronous transmission was applied. If the 
number of stations in a queue is set correctly, the delay of the 
RT data frame transmission is limited to two dozens of 
milliseconds and results mainly from the data rate. 
The presented results were obtained under the 
assumption that only UDP traffic is transferred across the 
network. The impact of the TCP flows on the network 
performance requires further analysis. 
The proposed mechanisms were developed as a result of 
a completely new approach to the support of RT data 
transmission in 802.11 ad-hoc network. They enrich standard 
procedures and enable an efficient utilization of the channel. 
VI. FUTURE WORK 
In this article, we have only presented the resource 
management strategy to support VoIP traffic. We described 
the procedures enabling the organizing of the network and 
real time traffic management. 
For future research it would be interesting to study the 
effect of the TCP traffic on the network capacity for VoIP. 
Based on this work, we are going to investigate how to 
efficiently manage the network where VoIP streams are 
combined with the TCP flows.  
The issue of nodes mobility is crucial for NRM 
determination and will be the topic of further study. 
Furthermore, we would like to devote attention to the 
aspect of the distributed network management. This includes 
optimization of the scheme for determining the secondary
