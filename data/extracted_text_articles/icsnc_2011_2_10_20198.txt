Abstract—Thanks to the recent improvements in speed and 
capacity of data networks, we observe a proliferation of network 
video content services. From the user's perspective more video 
requires more memory. To address this problem, we propose a 
new content management that uses cached delivery and scalable 
content. Our approach uses a data transition process of scalable 
structure, and is based on elapsed time and content usage 
parameters. We present the analysis of the efficiency of the new 
model.

 INTRODUCTION  
In recent years, video content delivery services by Video 
On-Demand: 
VoD 
are 
beginning to 
spread 
by 
the 
popularization of network and improvement of the speed.  
Moreover, the environment to play videos always is ready 
without accumulating in user terminals for these services, 
considering copyright. Generally speaking, in every aspect of 
content services, there some issues to enhance the efficiency of 
network management and content management. For examples, 
the way to solve the delay caused by collisions and 
retransmitting for large number of contents, the data 
management schemes and the prioritized transmission for 
multi-quality contents in heterogeneous environment to play 
them. There are some content provider sites, such as NicoNico-
Douga [1] and YouTube [2]. Users, who are interested in the 
new content service using the network and streaming services 
by on-demand, are driving force of a service popularization. 
However, to solve the problems of the compatibility and the 
cooperation among some service systems is still insufficient, 
and there are some problems when they use their service in 
different systems. Considering the continuity of content 
services, an information management is one of the important 
tasks of communication technologies for their services. When 
the number of used contents exceeds a predetermined level, 
they have any problem because of the limitation of disk 
capacity. For example, it becomes very difficult to grasp the 
whole situation if the time passed, after they moved the content 
data to the external device. In other words, as they manipulate 
the information, which is beyond the ability of our memory 
because of the spread of the digital environment to make our 
communities more livable, we can say that there is a limit in 
the information management.  
To increase the satisfaction of users for their services, the 
reduction of content providing costs and the service time is 
required. Thus, the problem of pricing method and the high 
efficiency of contents distributed systems based on the priority 
orders had been studied [3][4].  On the other hand, we had 
studied about the cache delivery method considering the 
priority for each content [5] and content management system 
using scalable architecture [6].  In this paper, we paid attention 
to the contents management method in contents services of 
multiple qualities, and present the method using scalable 
structure and distribution systems supported quality.  In this 
study, we propose video content management methods for 
multiple qualities.  The overview of proposed schemes and the 
utilization models are explained.  Finally, the efficiency is 
considered.   
II. 
PROPOSED MANAGEMENT METHOD  
When the opportunity to use the content service increases, 
the management method is one of the important problems in 
video content distributed systems. In order to be able to play 
contents of multiple qualities quickly and browse them for 
heterogeneous terminals for video resolutions, it is needed that 
users keep them in user terminals themselves.  Here, the 
number of layered structure is set to two. First, information 
data of proposed system is defined.  In this system, we use 
content data and index information.  Data structure is scalable, 
and index data has IDs, qualities, usage time and so on.   
A. Data transition process 
We explain the data transition method which is used in 
management systems.  Generally, they use the reduction 
method for disused contents to save their contents in local hard 
disk of users’ terminals, which have limited storage capacity.   
If the system does not have the functionality of the auto 
reduction, we cannot record our video clips, or the scheduled 
program does not work well.   From the viewpoint of the user 
terminal, the condition of this system is considered.   Users 
want to keep as many contents as possible themselves after 
purchase,  because they watch some contents at any time and 
they would like to play some contents again.  They think that 
the convenience of service is important.  Moreover, they 
require the model that the lack of information can be acquired 
quickly by on-demand services.  The re-use contents’ data 
should be reduced temporally, or moved to the other device.

For these issues, in this study, the whole data of the content is 
not reduced, but the part data of its content only is done by 
scalable structure. We use scalable video coding architecture, 
such as, spatial scalability, SNR scalability and temporal 
scalability, etc. in international coding standard MEPG-2, 
MPEG-4 [7][8][9]. The gradual data by data transition process 
consists of layered coding architecture and the procedure of 
data transition is proposed and adapted to the content 
management system.  
 
Figure 1.  Data transition of scalable structure 
Fig. 1 shows the data transition process and their status.  
The status S0 shows the data structure of high quality, H and I.  
H is two layered data, and it has base layer of low quality (a1) 
and enhancement layer of high quality (a2).  L is only a1 for 
low quality. I information is index information.  The data 
structure is lower quality progressively from left to right.  The 
right status has only index information.   In addition, there are 
the number of layer for content quality, current status of data 
and content data itself, as management information.  According 
to the order of contents’ priority, we reduce the data quality 
and its data structure is changed from the original data structure 
of used data to right data.  On the other hand, if users access to 
high quality, the status is moved to the left side.  Here, scalable 
structure can adapt to the different quality representation for 
heterogeneous terminals.   
B. Procedure of data transition  
The procedure of data transition is explained.  The 
determination process of data transition uses the value function 
and the status of local disk space.  The order calculated by the 
value function also decides the reduction scheme in the 
management method. The definition of basic priority function 
based on data transition of scalable data structure according to 
elapsed time is shown by Fig. 2.   
 
Figure 2.  The priority function based on the elapsed time and the status of 
data structure 
We simply show that the figure indicates monotonic 
decrease.  It also shows that the value is related to the elapsed 
time.  The longer the elapsed time from the access time is, the 
lower its value is.  When they use the high quality content, the 
data status becomes S0. Meanwhile, when low quality, it 
becomes S1.  When they do not use them periodically, it is S2.  
It is the model when the number of use increases, the value is 
high.  
 
Figure 3.  Updating process of used elapsed time for some quality contents 
and transition state 
Final data transition is determined by the judgment of the 
priority calculated by the value function, some thresholds, and 
the utilization condition of local disk in user terminal.  
According to the space of local disk, it is decided whether the 
action actually is performed or not.   The content status transits 
from high level to low level, S0, S1, S2 in turn, based on the 
order of the priority.  Actually, the reduced target content is 
calculated by usage history of contents and the frequency of 
use. At this time, the utilization time table is used, and the 
priority order becomes low for long term of elapsed time. The 
high level transition is based on the usage of high quality. Fig. 
3 shows the relationship of updating process of elapsed time 
from used time for some quality and transition state. The 
horizontal axis shows an elapsed time, and repeated use is 
important to keep the data status in local device. The upper 
data level is decided by use of the high quality. In this figure, 
a)-f) show the transition status after use, and 0)-12) show the 
updating status of quality selection. The group of a) shows S2 
of initialized data. b): S0, c): S1, d): S2, e): S1, f): S2, g): S1. 
On the other hand, 0): No use, 1): High quality use, 2): Low 
quality use. 3) 4) 5) 11) 12) show that stored data return to the 
S0 structure after data transition, respectively. 6)-10) also show 
that stored data return to the S1. For instance, in 3), when they 
use H, the status is S0 and t=0 is set.  
C. Procedure of data management method  
Next, the content management procedure in local disk of 
user terminal is shown by Fig. 4. We simply explain the flow.  
In a periodical time, we check the number of the contents 
and the disk space in local disk.  However, in the case where 
the content does not exist in local device and in the case where 
the data space is sufficient, the data transition process is 
suspended. The order of the content priority is calculated by 
some information, such as, usage history, frequency, quality, 
and the value function using elapsed time. We treat the current

time and the used time of contents, and manage the time 
information and disk space for stored contents. The target 
number of reducing is calculated by disk space, and the data 
transition process is repeated until the disk space of new 
contents satisfies a threshold value. Finally, the content 
management method based on data transition is useful. You 
can see that the old contents, which are not available, are 
reduced in local disk. Here, these processes are treated as the 
first process at stated intervals. Some samples of the 
parameters of target contents are shown. Content data size: 
Dp[bit], Quality: H:a1+a2,  L:a1,  a1=a2,  the disk capacity in 
user terminal: S[bit]. For x[week],  Nu: the summation of the 
number of usage, y:limited number, Cux: the number of usage 
in one interval. The check functions of the number are defined 
by countH, countL, countI for high, low data and index 
information respectively. In this study, we put the frequency 
ahead of the elapsed time and the priority function is used for 
renewal period. If the renewal period is long, the frequency 
information is important. Meanwhile, if it is short, the time data 
is considered. The detail setting of the function is the further 
study.  
 
Figure 4.  The procedure of content manage method 
The calculating function of the target transition number: 
Pc(x) is defined by equation (1).  Here, g = a2/(a1+a2)=1/2.  In 
this function, when Pc(x)>0, the data transition process is 
performed according to the rank of the priority. Otherwise, the 
process is suspended.  
III. 
CONTENT USAGE MODEL 
The content utilization services and the usage models are 
described.   
A. Service model  
We think two hierarchical qualities as the content services.  
In high quality video, users watch home-TV in large-sized 
monitor, and they use mobile-TV in low quality video.  In 
addition, when they also browse video contents, low quality 
data is used.  They become a member of either-or content 
service of the quality, or both.  Here, when they download the 
content, which is required, after the data is temporally stored in 
home server, it moves to user terminal, such as, home TV 
terminal and mobile TV terminal.  That is to say, the home 
server relays their contents to user terminals.  
We can consider that there are three utilization forms, UTm,  
UTn and UTo for two qualities as services models. In this figure, 
the gray color means no members.   Moreover, once users store 
the contents in local disk of user terminals, they play them.  
The service model is shown by Fig. 5.  
 
Figure 5.  Service model 
B. Utilization model  
In this service, the simple access model for multi-quality 
selection is defined by Fig. 6. Users start utilization services, 
and browse the content list. After that, they actually browse 
some contents shortly. If you need the contents to browse them, 
the contents in local disk are retrieved. However, if not, the 
contents are downloaded from the server. They select the 
content number, and the quality in the determination processes. 
If they can find that in local terminal, they proceed to the play 
process. If they cannot, they proceed to the next process. They 
check the status of contents and the quality in local terminals. 
After the content search, calculating process of the different 
data and data transmission in turn, they update the status and 
index information for the content management. In the data 
exchange between the server and clients, once they execute 
login procedures, they access to the server. After they retrieve 
the contents by download process, they play them at any time. 
If they repeat to select, they return to browse. Otherwise, they 
finish the service. Moreover, we suppose that this system has 
two information management processors in both the server and 
user terminals. They can exactly know the current status of the 
contents, the frequency and the elapsed time from the access 
time for every user. Therefore, the status by scalable structure 
is changed according to the elapsed time and the utilization of 
the quality.

IV. 
CONSIDERATION  
Firstly, we define the utilization condition in proposed 
method. Next, the efficiency of this system is considered.   
A. Conditions  
Suppose that this system transmits the contents to each 
Terminal (HTT, MTT in Fig.5) for each quality. One of users 
plays the required content according to the above statement.  
We assume that he uses them in quantities of Cu units of 
average times per an interval, and the quantity of servers’ 
contents is enough to use.  However, we do not treat the user 
tastes of the contents in this study.  The number of browsing 
the contents is z units, before selecting.  The number of z is 
depended on usage history and the status of storage. Moreover, 
he uses the low quality data each to browse them, which are 
stored in local disk.  When the data is not stored in the local 
disk, the part of content data corresponding to only browsing is 
transmitted from the server to the user terminal.  The amount of 
content information is Dp[bit], the play time is Da[s] and the 
browsing time is Db[s].  The speed of transmission for users is 
W[bps].

Next, the required time of retrieving service is defined 
bellow.  It does not have the play time, and he plays the content, 
after the download process.  As the required times which 
everyone cannot ignore, there are browsing time and data 
transmission time.   The browsing time of Tp is shown by  ∙ .  
The transmission time to play one content is   /, the 
transmission time to browse it, Tb is shown by    ≤  ∙
/ ∙ /  and Tbrowsing = Tb + Tp. Therefore, the 
summation shows the whole service time.  It is the point that 
the rate of retrieving the low quality of stored content and the 
hit ratio are intimately related to the service time. The other 
processing times are ignored.   The service times are described 
by equation (3).

The service time 1 shows the case of no hit of use history. 
The second is shown that the content of use does not match the 
download content, but it hits the browsing contents.   The third 
is shown that it matches the browsing contents without the 
download content.  You can know that Dd of amount of the 
transmission data is changed by the status. zh is the number of 
hit contents.  If the service time is long, the cost is high.  When 
we consider the situations, we divide into two main cases, the 
case of utilization of single quality, and the case of utilization 
of multiple qualities both. In this study, theoretical approach is 
explained, but the experimental approach is future tasks. 
B. Single quality use  
This case is applied to the situation of UTn, UTo defined by 
the service system.  In single quality use, L has two transition 
statuses and H has three transition statuses.  The former boils 
down to the problem whether the contents are cached or not.  
On the other hand, the latter is related to the solution whether it 
is efficient or not when the part data of the contents is cached.  
At first, we consider the first problem to simplify the 
problem. It is indicated that the management method using the 
frequency of use is generally useful by reference [5]. 
Meanwhile, it is the point whether the efficiency of caching 
method partly can be expected. Here, data size of a1 is the 
same as a2.  
Here, for example, we consider the model in a uniform 
access model as content services.  In this case, the every 
probability of the content is the same.  Therefore, if the status 
of H moves to the a1, the rate of occupation in the used 
contents is reduced by half.  
We consider the uniform model in detail here. The 
frequency function of content hit ratio is uniform and the 
smaller the amount of transmission data is gradually, the larger 
the probability is.  The summation of the transmission for no 
hit content is defined by next equation.

(16)
Thus,  ≥  +  by equation (12)(16). You can know 
that the equality only meets conditions. We consider this 
condition is not available for hierarchical data. Figure 7 shows 
the relationship between transmission data and the probability 
of hit contents for cached contents. In this figure, the larger the 
ratio of hierarchical allocation is, the larger the summation of 
the transmission data by the probability of access. On the other 
hand, the smaller the ratio of hierarchical allocation, the lower 
the vertical value is. The higher the transmission data is for 
vertical axis, the larger the probability of hit is. In the other 
word, if q is bigger, there is the space of disk for cached 
contents, and the number of stored contents is larger. 
Therefore, the status is moved to right point. Meanwhile, the 
lower the transmission data is, the smaller the hit rate is 
because of decreasing scalable data. Since the movement by 
decreasing is occurred according to the slope of g(t), the 
gradient is high and the rate of increasing the summation is 
also high. However, you can understand that there is no 
transition of scalable data structure for the condition.  
This case is the uniform access model of used contents. 
Thus, the equal access for each content if you use the limited 
capacity of cached disk, full cached data structure is good. 
That is to say, it is better when non scalable structure is used.  
 
 
Figure 7.  Relationship between transmission data and the probability of hit 
contents for cached contents 
Consequently, to have an advantage, the processes only 
have to double the hit ratio. However, the ratio is not more than 
twice in theory.  Thus, there is no case when the efficiency of 
the transmission is improved.  Next, we take up the model that 
the popularity of content access centers on some contents.  In 
the same way, even if the number of stored contents is 
increased, the efficiency is not more useful. However, you can 
know that the browsing time is shorter by these processes.  As 
mentioned above, for the purpose of reduction of data 
transmission, this system is insignificant.  
C. Multiple qualities use  
This case is applied to the situation of UTm defined by the 
service system. We do not treat the situation of single quality 
for services.   
By Fig. 3, there are two cases that they use the low quality 
after high quality: 8) 9) 10), and that they use the high quality 
after low quality: 11) 12).  When the status S1 is changed to S0, 
it is the same as previous study [6]. It showed that the 
transmission of the difference data is efficient in content

distribution systems. Moreover, the statuses of the actual 
transition are 10)11)12). Te is defined as the elapsed time from 
the request of the content in 10).  Considering the transition 
time,  ≥  + .  
The way we can meet the conditions in 11) 12) is to set that 
Tp1 is larger.   We can say that it is available, if they reuse and 
browse the contents while the elapsed time is less than Tpl.  
Consequently, if we define that Tp1 is larger than Tph,  the 
probability of contents’ hit is higher and this system has an 
advantage of data transition.  In this way, considering the worth 
of time domain, if this system manages the content and the 
information for the quality, it is better than previous study, 
which uses the independent data for some multiple qualities.  
We can summarize that the efficiency of the data management 
is not expected by data transition process for only a member of 
Home TV.  It is the same way in Mobile TV.  On the other 
hand, if both qualities are used, when the number of the used 
content is hit for valid period of the status,  or when the used 
content is matched to the browsing one,  this system is more 
available by proposed methods.  Since we can use that stored 
data to browse the content, the cost of service is lower.

CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we proposed the content management method 
using data transition for multiple qualities in video content 
distributed system.  Users freely use the content for multiple 
qualities, and the elapsed time is used to reduce the 
unnecessary data in proposed methods. We explain the 
procedure of data transition, and consider the cases of the 
improvement of convenience and the low cost.  
In prospective conditions of the number of low quality used 
contents, when they use the content of multiple qualities, if the 
transition time is set to be long, proposed method is efficient. 
In addition, when they do not use the multiple qualities, it 
cannot be expected to reduce the transmission data.  However, 
there is some advantage of browsing.   
As the further studies, we continue to consider the detail 
models for multi-quality video, and evaluate the proposed 
system using access models in some experiments.
