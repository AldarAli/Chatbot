Abstract—Identifying important, inﬂuent individuals in a social
network has been, for decades, an interesting analysis, that
can lead in business contexts to a better understanding of the
community structure and workers’ behavior (considering, e.g.,
performance). In this paper, the focus is on social networks
extracted from event logs, and a more powerful deﬁnition
of leadership is introduced taking into account the fact that
leaders may have different importance inside the organization.
This concept is useful also in identifying peripheral workers,
that are far from leaders. In an assessment done on the BPI
Challenge 2012 event log, peripheral workers showed better
performance in comparison to other workers. This discovery has
been explained using Social Psychology concepts and considering
several characterizations of peripheral workers.

INTRODUCTION
An important information about the social structure of
an organization regards leadership. A leader is a person that
holds a dominant or superior position within its ﬁeld, and is
able to exercise a high degree of control or inﬂuence over
others. Much emphasis has been given by the literature to the
importance of leaders in the functioning of an organization.
Research on leader-member exchange [1] shows that normal
workers’ performance is inﬂuenced by the relation with their
leader. Other studies [2][3] show that effective leaders can be
generally found in the center of a social network, according to
a centrality measure (see for instance [4][5]). These studies are
sociometric. Sociometry [6] is a science that can be applied
in business contexts, like performance management [7][8].
Blondel et al. [9] is particularly interesting because it speaks
about a method to ﬁnd social leaders inside an organization
and how to use that information to increase the business
insights (improving the community structure and the graph
visualization).
In this paper, the focus has been switched from a socio-
metric approach (based only on relations between individuals)
to an event log approach, because it could be more powerful.
In doing so, only social networks extracted from event logs
[10] have been considered; they are particularly meaningful
in business contexts [11]. The notion of weighted leaders will
be explained (in Section 3), a simple algorithm to ﬁnd them
will be introduced (in Section 3) and, moreover, an improved
clustering algorithm, inspired by the [9] one, will be presented
(in Section 3). The concept of peripheral workers will then
be deﬁned (always in Section 3), showing that they usually
perform better than other workers (in Section 4), exploring
thanks to existing Social Psychology literature [12][13] various
types of peripheral workers.

BACKGROUND
Social networks in business contexts [10] may be built upon
event logs [14][15], which are collections of information about
events happening in the organization. These include the event’s
timestamp; the process instance in which the event is deployed;
the event’s originator (i.e., the worker who does the event). A
point that may need to be clariﬁed is that, in Business Process
Intelligence [16] terminology (BPI is the analysis of business
processes using IT systems), an event is always instantaneous.
The concept that many might be familiar with is the one
of activity. To understand the difference, To understand the
difference, we could think of “Cooking a pasta” as an activity
built of possibly two events: a start (instantaneous) event and a
completion event (in which, we declare to have already cooked
the pasta).
Like in [17], a social network can be deﬁned as a
weighted graph G = (V, E), where nodes represent individuals
(workers), and are identiﬁed by integers (thus V , the set of
nodes, is a subset of N); edges represent relations between
individuals, and are identiﬁed by couples e = (i, j) (where
i and j are identiﬁers of nodes; the set of edges E is a
subset of V ×V ); weights are associated to edges, and are the
strength of the relationship represented by the corresponding
edge (mathematically, they can be understood as functions
from E to R). Given an edge (i, j) ∈ E the associated weight
is denoted as w((i, j)) ∈ R).
To effectively build the social network, a weight (between 0
and 1) to relations between individuals has to be assigned. This
can be done calculating a metric between individuals. Van der
Aalst et al. in [10] propose several metrics, like the Handover
of Work (HoW) metric, that measures how many times the
work of an individual for a process instance is followed by the
work of another individual; and the Working Together (WT)
metric, that measures how many times two individuals work
together in process instances. In this paper, the focus will be
mainly on the WT metric, as the collaborative distance between
leaders and other individuals is considered (WT(p1,p2) is the
ratio of the number of instances in which both p1 and p2 do
events and the number of instances, contained in the log, in
which p1 do events). So, the value of the metric is high when
two individuals often collaborate.
Information can be mined from a social network using
a clustering algorithm, which groups individuals based on
their similarity, to extract information about the community
structure of the organization [18][19][20]. A clustering C of
G is a family of subsets of V such that each node is assigned
to exactly one cluster and a function C : V → N where
C(v) = i ⇐⇒ v ∈ Si (v belongs to the cluster Si) can be

deﬁned. There are several clustering algorithms [19][21]-[26],
but unfortunately the majority of them work on undirected
graphs. So, to use them on directed graphs, the graph has to
be transformed into an undirected one (i.e., making edges (i, j)
and (j, i) to have the same weight).
A difﬁcult task is to evaluate the quality of the output
of clustering algorithms. In the context of social networks,
the most popular criteria to judge the quality of a clustering
is modularity. Modularity is a concept, described in [21],
that aims to measure group cohesion inside communities
and separation between them. The higher is the modularity,
the better the quality of the detected communities is. Some
clustering algorithms try to maximize directly modularity (e.g.,
[21]). Also nodes centrality (degree centrality [27], pagerank
centrality [28], betweenness centrality [5]) may be an impor-
tant factor to understand which individuals are important in
their group and to ﬁnd overlapping communities [19][29].
Having an event log, however, means having more infor-
mation than the ones contained in Social Networks extracted
from the metrics: a Business Process Improvement analysis can
be done [15]. An interesting analysis might regards instances
completion times. Indeed, instances with an high duration may
be dangerous (for example, breaking Service Level Agree-
ments); while the ones with low duration may signal some
positive things inside the organization. This concept, in Lean
Manufacturing terminology, is called Lead Time [30]. Indeed,
focusing on a process, the mean (M) completion time of
instances, the standard deviation (SD) of completion times
can be calculated, and after ﬁxing a constant k (as example,
k = 1) one can consider as “positive” instances the ones whose
duration is below M − k · SD, as “normal” instances the ones
whose duration is between M − k · SD and M + k · SD,
as “negative” instances, or instances whose duration exceeds
Lead Time, the ones whose duration is above M + k · SD.
Another interesting Lean Manufacturing-inspired concept
is the Flow Rate. It measures the ratio of the quantity of
time in which the instance is actively worked and the instance
duration. In other words, it is a measure of how many long
“holes” there are between the completion of an activity and
the start of the next activity. So, instances with lower Flow
Rate are being worked in a more systematic way.

WEIGHTED LEADERS AND PERIPHERAL WORKERS
In this section, we will deﬁne the concepts of weighted
leaders and peripheral workers, and we will propose a method
to ﬁnd weighted leaders.
A. Weighted Leaders
Blondel et al. [9] have introduced a method to discover
leaders. However, the authors do not consider the fact leaders
in an organization may have different weights, i.e., there are
leaders which are more important than others.
Deﬁnition: A weighted leader is a couple (i, w) where i is a
(leader) individual and w is the weight (comprised between 0
and 1) that measures the importance of the leader.
This is meaningful because less important leaders may
have a less wide “sphere of inﬂuence” than the most important
ones, and this observation can be used to improve the com-
munity structure (clustering). Indeed, a clustering algorithm is
proposed, inspired to the one described in [9] and reported in
Fig. 1, that takes into account weighted leaders. It is described
in Fig. 2, and consists in inserting each node in the cluster
Blondel Clustering(G, L)
Require: A weighted social network graph G = (V, E, w)
A set of leaders L = {l1, . . . , ln}, li ∈ V ∀i
Ensure: A clustering C : V → N of G
C ← ∅ ▷ Clustering, initially empty
new C ← ∅ ▷ Ausiliar clustering, initially empty
i ← 0
for all l ∈ L do
i ← (i + 1)
new C(l) ← i
end for
while new C ̸= C do
C ← neq C
▷ π1 is the projection on the ﬁrst component
▷ So, roughly speaking, I are taking the nodes
for all n ∈ V \ π1(C) do
Ln ← {(k, w((n, k))) | (n, k) ∈ E} ▷ w(e) is the weight
of the edge
ln ← π1(arg maxLn π2)
new C(n) ← C(ln)
end for
end while
▷ After that, isolated nodes are inserted
for all n ∈ V \ π1(C) do
i ← (i + 1)
C(n) = i
end for
return C
Figure 1.
Blondel’s algorithm to cluster organizational social networks,
having in input the set of leaders
of its most (weighted) near leader. This method takes into
account both the (topological) distance and the power / weight
of the leader. In the Assessment section, there is a comparison
between this algorithm and the one presented in [9].
B. Peripheral Workers
The proximity of a worker to other workers expresses
how much the given worker is profoundly embedded in the
organization, and is expressed by the weight of the connections
of the given worker to other workers. Having introduced the
notion of (weighted) leader, there is interest in observing which
workers are far from leaders.
Peripheral workers are workers that are far, in the sense of
collaboration, from leaders. They can be found by calculating
for each worker a quantity, that is called leader proximity,
expressing the distance of the worker from the leaders. The
algorithm to calculate leader proximity, and to discover periph-
eral workers, is described in Fig. 3: the minimum topological
distance from a leader, considering also his weight, is found.
The peripheral workers concept is not strictly coincident
with other Social Psychology concepts, but two possible cate-
gories of peripheral workers can be considered:
- Newcomers are workers that are new in the organization,
or were previously assigned to different processes. They can
feed new energy to the organization, and new ideas (see
[12][31][32]). However, they can be considered marginal in the
organization because a new worker usually does not suddenly
collaborate with organizational leaders, and his initial collab-
oration network is usually strict. To enhance their position in
the organization, they usually start working harder than their

The algorithm to cluster organizational social networks, having in
input the set of weighted leaders
mates [33], and this suggests that peripheral workers of this
category may offer better performance than other workers.
Also, they may motivate old-timers to reﬂect on the group’s
work practices [34][35][36], and be a source of diversity
regarding the skills and values, which can stimulate the group
to consider new ideas and adopt new practices [32][37][38],
and this can also contribute to better performances.
- Workers suffering phenomenons similar to social exclu-
sion [39], so they are not, or are not considered by other
workers, full part of the organizational processes and work
force. Social exclusion usually leads to offering a lower
performance level [40]. However, possible reasons could be
asserted on why peripheral workers may not be full part of
the organizational work force, yet offering a good performance
level: they are external collaborators or consultants (so they
do not always work for the organization). They might have a
good working behaviour in order to convince the organization
to collaborate again with them. This category contains also
workers with expiring contracts that wish to be called again
by the organization. A second reason is that they might not
feel adequately considered by colleagues, and work hard in
order to improve their position in the organization (see [41]).

An interesting theory related to this is job embeddedness [42].
This theory explains why workers wish to be included in
an important network of relations inside the organization, as
the ones most embedded in the organizational social network
(i.e., having strong ties with other workers, and with leaders)
have the best chance to retain the work. Or, ﬁnally, they
could be members of the group that once were full members
but lost their position because they failed to live up with
expectations of the group (these workers were studied in [43]).
This could explain their good performances as an attempt to
being considered again. Basing always on [43], if they succeed
in re-doing a socialization, they may resume their activities as
full members.
The previous one should not be considered as conclusive
categories, but are useful to categorize part of the peripheral
workers, while some ones are out of these categories. In the
assessment we will see that peripheral workers offer however
a good performance, and this could be explained also by
other reasons. Peripheral workers, given their marginality in
the organization, are assigned to simpler instances. These,

then, require less time and less effort to be completed. They
might also be brilliant individuals, being able to work alone
without requiring leaders to control them. Peripheral workers
are less stressed than other workers: in the assessment, even
normal workers with a similar number of worked instances
perform worse than peripheral workers. Stress may be fault of
leadership [44] recalling all the time workers to their duties
and judging commitment. Finally, they might be more free
(in work) than other workers. Freedom in a workplace may
conduct to a better working behaviour and satisfaction [45].
C. Finding weighted leaders
In this section a method is proposed to discover leaders,
and to assign them a weight that takes into account the social
network and the event log. It is a very simple way, with some
insights on how to improve it described in the “Conclusion and
Future Work” section. The approach described in [9] (resumed

in Fig. 4) is brieﬂy recalled: given a node (worker), if the
number of 3-cliques (a N-clique is a subset of size N of the
vertices such that every two distinct vertices are adjacent) it
belongs to exceeds the number of 3-cliques neighbor nodes
(workers) belong to, then it is considered to be a social leader.
The approach proposed in this paper (described in Fig.
5) is focused on counting the number of process instances
worked by the resources. The workers with the greater number
of process instances are considered to be leaders. The weight is
1 for the worker with the greatest number of process instances
and, for other workers that are considered to be leaders, is
the ratio between their number of worked instances and the
number of worked instances by the worker with the greatest
number of process instances.
But how many of the workers, given they have been
sorted by that number, should be taken? One should consider
the number of the leaders that, according to the clustering
algorithm that has been previously introduced, maximizes the
quality of the obtained community structure, measured by
modularity. Indeed, the number of leaders that realize the
maximum represent possibly a good and synthetic covering
of the social network graph.
IV.
ASSESSMENT
The assessment has been done on the Business Process
Intelligence Challenge 2012 event log. This event log, taken
from a Dutch ﬁnancial institute and regarding an application
process for personal loans, has been made freely available to
invite business process mining specialists to work on discover-
ing possibly interesting business analysis, using any available
approach (including Social Network Analysis).
As explained in the background, social networks extracted
from event logs are being considered, so it is required to choose
a metric between individuals: the Working Together metric has
been chosen. Worker 112 is an automated resource, that is
present in almost all instances, and it has been excluded from
the analysis.

social network, using the proposed algorithms. Leaders (re-
ported in bold) are deﬁned using the criterion explained in
Fig. 5, considering the workers having greater leader weight
(this was, for completeness, reported for each worker). Then,
for each worker, (worked) process instances whose duration
exceeded Lead Time (which is set to be M + k · SD,
with k = 1.5) have been considered, calculating the mean
Flow Rate, and reporting also the percentage of “critical”
process instances over the number of overall worked instances.
Peripheral workers (which are emphasized in italic) are the
ones with lower leader proximity (in this table, the ones with
measure < 0.24 are considered).
The list of leaders was found using the algorithm described
in Fig. 5, with their number established trying to maximize
the modularity. For N = 15 there is a value of modularity
equal to 0.02431, which is better than the value of modularity
obtained applying the algorithm described in [9] (that produces
a modularity of −0.02834). So, the weighted leaders-based
algorithm manages to get a better description of the community
structure than the algorithm described in [9]. Also, this is not
due to the chosen number of leaders: Fig. 6 (line coloured light
gray represents modularity results for Blondel’s Algorithm on
these differently-sized lists of leaders; line with dark gray
colour represents modularity results for our algorithm) shows
us that, for any chosen number of leaders, the proposed algo-
rithm works better. It provides, in addition, better modularity
results than Label Propagation algorithm (that gets a 0.0000)
and Multilevel algorithm (that gets a −0.0186), which are
commonly used algorithms.
Using the set of (weighted) leaders, leader proximity has
been calculated for all remaining workers. The considered
peripheral workers are the ones with leader proximity < 0.24:
this threshold was chosen for the log because it separates the
ones which are peripheral workers from the other workers
in Table II. However, in a different log from BPI Challenge
2012 the ideal threshold for peripheral workers is likely to be
different. Peripheral workers have deﬁnitely a lower percentage
of process instances exceeding Lead Time and lower mean
Flow Rate.
In Fig. 7 and 8, peripheral workers are shown to perform
better than other workers when the focus is on process in-
stances whose duration exceeds Lead Time (that is set to be
M + k · SD, with k = 1.5): there is a lower percentage of
these instances and the mean Flow Rate is inferior. This is
not dependant on the threshold chosen to decide peripheral
workers, as in Fig. 7 and 8.
In Table III is shown that in many times peripheral workers
are also far from other workers, not only from the leaders.
This conﬁrms their substantial marginality in the organization.
These workers are not clearly part of any work group in the
considered organization (an hyphotesis may be that they are
external collaborators), running the risk of social exclusion
inside the workplace. Some insights could be given on a
possible “classiﬁcation” of some of the peripheral workers:
Worker 11304 enters the event log very late (Sat Feb 04
2012): this says that, relatively to the given process, he is a
newcomer, and he may perform great to let the others know
him.
Workers 10859, 11120 and 10880 are present only at the
start of the event log: this says that they are not fully part of
the organization. A hypothesis could be that they are external
collaborators, so they perform well to being “called again” by

the organization, or they have an expiring work contract so
they try to work at their best to get a renewed contract.
Workers 10188 and 10779 are not generally involved
much in the organization, registering a low number of worked
instances and low collaboration with others. They may perform
better in order to get more involved in the process (see [41]).
For workers 11200, 10971 and 10862, which do not fall in
the previous categories, a possible explanation can be provided:
the job embeddedness theory; they perform good in order
to improve their organizational ties and to strenghten their
position in the organization.
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper insights on organizational social networks
extracted from event logs have been proposed, introducing
the concept of weighted leader and showing how to ﬁnd
peripheral workers. Basing on these concepts, a clustering
algorithm has been introduced, that is similar to the one
described in [9], but is based on the concept of weighted
leader. Experiments have been carried out on the freely
available BPI Challenge 2012 event log, and the leaders
were found based on the simple, but effective, count of the
worked process instances. In this log, the proposed clustering
algorithm produced the best modularity results, and peripheral
workers were found to have better behaviour (relative to Flow
Rate and to the percentage of cases exceeding Lead Time)
than other workers.
The classiﬁcation of at least some of the peripheral
workers has been proposed, in some categories that come
from Social Psychology literature. The analysed categories
are the newcomers and the social excluded workers. In the
log there is at least one peripheral worker for both the
categories, and this lead to possible explanations about the
good behaviour (relatively to the considered performance
measures) of these workers.
For an organization, given newcomers good behaviour,
it may be convenient to involve new people in (existing)
processes, rather than being ﬁxed on a static workforce [31].
Also, recurring to external collaborators and contracts that
expires seems convenient in order to avoid workers to be
static on a process and, in the long period, to lose motivation
and performance [34][35][36].
The practical purpose of the proposed methods is to easily
ﬁnd, starting from an event log, high and low performing
workers,
doing
an
effective
evaluation
of
employees.
The proposed algorithms work on event logs: only few
organizations have a process-awareness level such that they
collect data in an event log, through Information Technology
systems. These logs often are private: there is a very little
number of freely available event logs and the chosen one (BPI
Challenge 2012, that collects event from a Dutch ﬁnancial
institute) is probably one of the most meaningful.
Also,
only
events
regarding
a
particular
process
(application process for personal loans) have been inserted
in BPI Challenge 2012: this limits the social network to
the people working for that particular scope. In addition to
that, one does not know anything other than the information
written in the event log. This has lead to a classiﬁcation of
peripheral workers that is plausible but must be seen like an
hypothesis, that could not be conﬁrmed given the information
in the BPI Challenge 2012 log.
It must also be remarked that information obtained here
regard only a process. So, the found leaders and peripheral
workers might be leaders, or marginals, only in the given
process, not necessarily in the organization.
An open question regards the possibility of a better
criterion to discover leaders in the social network. Some
ideas that are based on possible calculations on the event log
are about introducing some measures, and they are brieﬂy
reported:
•
A statistical measure of workload (number of things
done contemporaneously), searching leaders among
the workers having greater workload.
•
A notion of criticality among workers, that is high
when a worker does a type of activity with no or
few possible replacements in the organization. Leaders
often do exclusive activities, because of their role, so a
good criterion to discover leaders may be calculating
workers’ criticality and taking the ones with the higher
measure.
•
Measuring responsability through the in-degree of the
worker in the Handover of Work between-individuals
metric [10]. Indeed, if there are many handovers, it
means that many workers in the organization need
to consult the given individual, so there is a good
possibility that he is a leader.
•
Measuring worktime. Leaders usually have more re-
sponsabilities, so they work longer.
Analyzing the effect of these ideas, however, is a big task,
that goes beyond the purposes of this paper and, given the
effectiveness of the measure that counts the number of cases,
is left as future work.
