Abstract
Several
methods
for
the
acquisition
of
bidimensional
thermal
images
of
acoustic
fields
produced by ultrasonic transducers for therapy have
been described. A low cost technique used for the
characterization
of
ultrasonic
therapy
equipment
consists in placing a thermochromatic liquid crystal
(TLC) film in a cross-section of the ultrasonic beam,
forming
a
colorful
image
of
the
temperature
distribution. This method gives information about the
whole thermal pattern, which is related to the intensity
of ultrasound, offering a qualitative measurement. The
present paper describes the acquisition of a sequence
of
thermal
images
using
the
TLC
technique.
Diathermia
temperatures
were
induced
by
using
physiotherapy ultrasound equipment at 1 MHz in
polyvinyl chloride and polyurethane copolymer films.
Digital image processing and computer graphics were
used in order to get the mathematical model of the
monotonic relation between temperature and color in
TLC films for the temperature range from 35ºC to
40°C. 3D thermal beam-shape reconstruction for the
ultrasound therapy transducer was obtained for a
future medical parameter analysis such as radiation
beam pattern, penetration depth and effective field size.
A numerical method based on RGB color model and
Euclidean
distance
for
getting
a
quantitative
measurement of temperature rise in thermal images
was developed.

1. Introduction
As a coherent ultrasonic wave propagates through
biological tissue, it is attenuated due to absorption and

ALFA - Contract Nº AML/B7-311/97/0666/II-0343-FA-FCD-FI,

scattering. Absorption results from the irreversible
conversion of acoustic energy to local heat, and it is the
primary mode of attenuation in tissue. Ultrasound
ability to interact with tissue to produce local heating
has been known for a long time and nowadays
ultrasound physiotherapy is widely used in health care
to treat tissue injuries [13]. However, a large number of
therapeutic equipment does not meet international
standards. Rigorous quality control to verify whether
physiotherapy ultrasound equipment performance is
within acceptable range of acoustic intensity output
plays a very important role in this context [2].
Thermographic method of color analysis with TLC
films is a fast and simple way to evaluate the
bidimensional thermal distribution in an acoustic field
produced by the ultrasound physiotherapy equipment
[3].
TLC films temperature visualization is based on the
properties of some cholesteric liquid crystal materials
that reflect definite colors at specific temperatures and
viewing angles. These properties depend on their
molecular
organization;
they
are
composed
of
molecular layers, where each one has a light rotation
respect to the closest adjacent plane around an axis.
This propriety generates a helicoidal structure that
reflexes the incident white light [4]. Correspondence
between color and temperature is possible since liquid
crystals emit narrow centered bands around one wave
length and these bands change regularly for others
colors with temperature rise [5].
Color changes in TLC films are repeatable and
reversible as long as the TLC films are not physically
or chemically damaged. The time response of TLC
films is approximately 10 ms. Due to the reversibility
and the repeatability of color changes, TLC films can
be calibrated accurately and used in this way as a
temperature indicators [6].

Figure 1. Relative angles between the
molecules with the change of temperature [7].
The use of thermochromatic materials for thermal
distribution mapping is based on the fact that the
acoustic energy absorption by one medium and the
temperature rise, according to the temporal average
intensity of the ultrasound, is given by [8]:
A = 2αa I,
(1)
where A is the energy absorption rate in the material,
αa is the absorption coefficient and I is the temporal
average intensity of ultrasound.
As the intensity distribution is non-uniform in a
cross-section of the ultrasonic beam [9], it is possible
to observe changes in the intensity distribution or
temperature in a plane where the beam is intercepted
by the thermochromatic film [10].
Digital image Processing (DIP) allows visualizing
and extracting information from an image and it has
many advantages over analog image processing. It
allows a much wider range of algorithms to be applied
to the input data, and can avoid problems such as the
noise and signal distortion during processing [11].
Three-dimensional reconstruction is the process in
which a sequence of two-dimensional images taken
from a common scene is processed to create the planar
projections of a volume [12]. Changes produced by the
acoustic wave passing through a medium might be
interpreted
for
obtaining
the
geometrical
and
mechanical characteristics of the medium.
Temperature qualitative measurements using TLC
films have been described. They use DIP algorithms
based on the conversion of color images to gray-scale
images [12]. By using color models, an abstract
mathematical model describing the way colors can be
represented as tuples of numbers; it is possible to
obtain a relation between the temperature rise and the
color change in TLC films for a temperature qualitative
measurement [1].
This paper describes the acquisition of a sequence
of
thermal
images
of
physiotherapy
ultrasound
equipment with a thermographical system; a chromatic
modeling of TLC films in the temperature range from
35ºC to 40ºC; DIP for extracting a quantity that
represents color and obtaining a mathematical relation
between color-temperature for a quantitative evaluation
of temperature rise in ultrasonic thermal images and
finally, a tree-dimensional reconstruction for a future
medical parameters evaluation.
2. Methodology
2.1. Thermochromatic liquid crystal films
These
materials
reflect
incident
white
light
selectively due to their layered-molecular structure to
show bright iridescent color. Their color change, due to
temperature increases, usually from colorless to red at
low temperature, through the colors of the visible
spectrum to blue and colorless again (Figure 2)[14].
They are viewed normally against a black background,
and the materials have good long-term stability.
Figure 2. Color changes in TLC films [15].
The TLC film used in this work (R35C5W,
Hallcrest®) has a start temperature of 35°C and a
bandwidth of 5°C (Table 1) [15].

2.2. Practical implementation
2.2.1 Chromatic modeling
The experimental setup for obtaining the sequence
of thermal images is depicted in Figure 3.
67
International Journal On Advances in Systems and Measurements, vol 2 no 1, year 2009, http://www.iariajournals.org/systems_and_measurements/

Figure 3. Experimental setup.
A TLC film was immersed in a black painted water
tank (dimensions: 70 cm x 20 cm x 20 cm). In order to
avoid image distortion due to bubble formation,
degasified
distilled
water
was
used.
The
water
temperature was increased up to 45ºC by using an
aluminum water heater. A water pump was used to
avoid the temperature gradients formation. To get
thermal images, the heater was removed and the
temperature was monitored with an Hg thermometer
(Brannan®, 0.1ºC resolution). The sequence of images
started at 40ºC, with a temperature increase between
acquisitions of 0.5ºC, and finished at 35ºC. The
thermal images were viewed by using a metallic
reflecting film at 45º from the TLC film and recorded
by a commercial camera (Sony®, DSC-W55). A white
light illumination system (color temperature of 6500º
K) was used as floodlighting to control the white light
intensity.
Numerical methods were applied to each thermal
image to obtain the chromatic components in the RGB
color model. The values of the components were
between 0 and 255. The color was digitally represented
with 1 byte. The algorithm is illustrated in Figure 4.
Figure 4. Flow diagram of the algorithm for
image processing.
The image enhancement consists of spatial filtering
to reduce noise of the images originated by electronic
noise in the input device (digital camera) sensor and
circuitry, or particles in the medium. For doing that a
median filter was implemented.
The median filter, instead of the replacement of the
pixel value with the mean values of neighboring pixels,
replaces the pixel with the median of the neighboring
values. Neighborhood averaging can suppress isolated
out-of-range noise, but the side effect is that it also
blurs sudden changes (corresponding to high spatial
frequencies) such as sharp edges. The median is
calculated by first sorting all the pixel values from the
surrounding neighborhood into numerical order and
then replacing the pixel being considered with the
average pixel value. This filter is applied to each
matrix (3) that represents the image in the RGB color
model. The arithmetic average of the pixel values in
filtered
images
is
obtained
for
each
chromatic
component.
Figure 5. Median filter implementation.
Statistical
treatment
consists
of
obtaining
the
median value of the chromatic components on different
thermal image sequences to describe the tendency in
the color components with the change of temperature.
To obtain the polynomials that relate the change of
the chromatic components and the temperature, the
minimum quadratics adjustment is applied to the
median of the pixel values in the color components.
2.2.2 Thermal mapping
The experimental setup for exposing and viewing
the thermal imaging system is illustrated in Figure 6.
Figure 6. Schematic of the experimental setup.

Thermography system sensibility is related with the
temperature rise induced by the ultrasound intensity
and is determined by the absorbed ultrasonic energy
[8].
The use of low reflection and high absorption
attenuation coefficient materials enhances the heating
of the TLC film. Polyvinyl chloride and polyurethane
copolymer film with a water sonic wave reflection
coefficient of 0,06 ±0,01 and a sonic attenuation
coefficient of 23,5 ±1,02 dB•cm-1•MHz was used[10].
These values agree with the IEC 61161 regulations for
absorber materials [16].
A physiotherapy transducer (1MHz) and TLC film
coupled to copolymer film with acoustic gel; were
immersed in the black painted water tank filled with
degasified distilled water. To minimize standing wave
effects, ultrasound transmitted through the imaging
system was absorbed and scattered by an anechoic
rubber absorber positioned at the end of the system
(Ham A, National Physical Laboratory) [17]. For
mapping the temperature distribution on the copolymer
film, the temperature of water was fixed at 34.5°C,
below the start point of the TLC film. Circulation from
water pump was added to system for a homogeneous
water temperature.
Transducer
was
excited
with
a
physiotherapy
equipment (Ibramed®, Sonopulse) in continuous mode
at 1 MHz and nominal ultrasonic intensity was set up
to 2W•cm-2.
An algorithm for processing the bi-dimensional
thermal images sequence
and
for enhancing the
visualization of the registered thermal phenomenon
was developed. Figure 7 illustrates the processes of the
digital image treatment.

Once the images are filtered, the image sequence is
converted from color to gray-scale; three-dimensional
reconstruction cannot be used with images represented
with more than one matrix. The expression for the
conversion is given by [18]:
I = 0.2989R + 0.5870G + 0.1140B,

where I is the gray intensity, R,G,B represent red, green
and blue intensities for the transformed pixel.

out.

2.2.3 Temperature detection

taking into account color spatial point representation in
the RGB color model. A numerical method for
calculating Euclidean distance between evaluated pixel
chromatic components in filtered thermal image and

temperatures in TLC characterization was developed.

Subsequently,

2.2.4
Three-dimensional
thermal
pattern
reconstruction
Gray scale filtered thermal images for volumetric
thermal distribution reconstruction are used. The goal
is to create a three dimensional matrix with all the
processed images and to interpolate similar gray
intensity values.
Three dimensional reconstruction is divided in the
following four steps:

Volumetric data organization and processing.

Isosurfaces creation (interpolation).

Reconstruction
configuration:
color,
illumination and graphic texture.

Vision angle and perspective.
First, images in a three dimensional matrix V(x,y,z)
were organized, where x,y represent the coordinate and
gray intensity level for the image and z represents the
image number of the sequence. Manipulating the
matrix for just taking a part of it was possible; that
implies that it is possible to obtain cuttings of the
temperature pattern in any transversal section for
viewing the thermal distribution inside the volume.
Thermal image edge filtering was applied for a
smooth volume isosurface. Then, image outline pixel
values are interpolated with their respective gray
intensity level. This procedure allows creating the
volume geometry and giving a specific color to each of
the
interpolated
gray levels.
Finally,
perspective,
texture and illumination are configured. Figure 9
illustrates
edge
interpolation
carried
out
by
the
algorithm for reconstructing the thermal distribution.

3. Results
3.1 Chromatic modeling
The images were taken at different times. Nine
sequences of thermal images were taken. A median
filter with a 15 x 15 kernel was implemented to
improve the images. The arithmetic mean was applied
to
get
the
tuples
of
values
for
the
chromatic
components in the images. The tuples for the nine
measurements
were
treated
statistically
with
the
median and the standard deviation.
For the polynomial adjustment, the
minimum
quadratics adjustment and the median were used. The
polynomial degree was adjusted to the best fitting and
the lowest degree considering the behavior tendency of
the color component values.

chromatic red component.
Red components are higher in the range from 35ºC
to 36ºC. Red components have a non-lineal behavior
tendency (Figure 10).
The mathematical model for the chromatic red
components is defined by the equation:
R=-4.30t5+11.05t4-4.75t3-5.03t2+2.66t+0.69, (7)
where R is the intensity of the red components and t is
the temperature defined between 35ºC and 40ºC.

chromatic green component.
Green components are present in the range from
35.5ºC to 37ºC. Green components have also a marked
non-lineal behavior tendency (Figure 11).
The mathematical model for the chromatic green
components is defined by the algebraic expression:
G=-3.12t6+5.55t5+1.43t4-5.44t3+7.37t2-21.50t+77.3, (8)
where G is the intensity of the green components and t
is the temperature defined between 35ºC and 40ºC.

chromatic blue component.
Blue components are present in the range from
37.5ºC to 40ºC. Blue component has an almost-lineal
behavior tendency (Figure 12).
The mathematical model for the chromatic blue
component is defined by the expression:
B=-1.63t4+0.41t3-0.82t2+31.81t+127.72, (9)
where B is the intensity of the blue component and t is
the temperature defined between 35ºC and 40ºC.

3.2 Thermal mapping
Once the ultrasound beam was switched on, the
formation of a stable thermal image on the TLC film
took approximately 30 s. Measurements were made at
2 mm intervals up to 80 mm. Thermal images were
taken every 30 s so that the image was steady. At the
end a sequence of 40 images was obtained (Figure 13).

An adaptive Wiener filter with a 25 x 25 kernel was
implemented to improve the images; binarization was
applied with a 0.5 luminance level (Figure 14).

3.3 Temperature detection
A graphic interface was developed. This graphic
interface facilitates user interaction and avoids the
necessity of working with the programming code. The
algorithm is semiautomatic. Users have to take part in

Three-dimensional
thermal
pattern
reconstruction
For making three-dimensional reconstruction, each
image of the sequence was superposed one behind the
72
International Journal On Advances in Systems and Measurements, vol 2 no 1, year 2009, http://www.iariajournals.org/systems_and_measurements/

other in a three-dimensional array to interpolate pixel
values corresponding to the edge of each image with
the same level of intensity to create an isosurface.
Color map, color bar, illumination and material were
configured for the scene.
Radiation pattern gives information about the non-
homogeneities of acoustic intensity when they are
related to the gradients of temperature in thermal
images (Figure 17).
Figure 17. 3-D Temperature pattern
reconstruction.
Data of the three-dimensional (3-D) array was used
for taking a transversal section for viewing thermal
distribution inside the volume.
Figure 18. Temperature pattern
reconstruction.
The thermal distribution pattern in the radiated
copolymer shows a high temperature region distributed
throughout
z
axis
with
two
regions
where
the
temperature reaches its maximum point, between 25 –
60 mm of depth (Figure 18).
4. Discussion
One of the main advantages of the technique based
on TLC sheets is that the reflected light is within the
visible spectrum allowing viewing and photography by
using a rather conventional camera.
Chromatic
modeling.
DIP
was
used
for
a
qualitative measurement of thermal distribution in
gray-scale images [12]. In this work a sequence of
thermal images between 30-35 Celsius degrees were
obtained and a DIP algorithm was implemented for the
mathematically modeling in the TLC film using the
RGB color model. The use of a color model allows
obtaining a mathematic relation between temperature
and an abstract representation, as color is considered,
to get a temperature quantitative measurement.
Thermal
mapping.
This
method
applied
to
ultrasound fields was proposed by Cook and Werchan
[19] improved by Macedo et al. [10] and Gómez et al.
[12]. Coupling polyvinyl chloride and polyurethane
copolymer material to TLC film improves ultrasound
absorption, delays thermal equilibrium and enhances
system sensibility.
These techniques are dependent of the following
factors:
Surrounding illumination – Uncontrolled light
sources and possible reflections from surfaces in the
TLC may cause errors in the measured temperatures;
an
illumination
analysis
is
required
in
other
applications of the method.
Viewing angle – The TLC colors depend on the
angles between the camera and the TLC surface.
Controlled
temperature
conditions
–
It
is
important to control the temperature to achieve desired
accuracy and to avoid the temperature gradients
formation. Hysteresis is one of the problems when the
crystals
are
heated
above
their
clearing
point
temperature [7].
Digital resolution – The minimal number of pixels
needed per unit length of the TLC surface depends on
the magnitude of the temperature gradient: locations
with large gradients needing more pixels to achieve a
desired accuracy. There is a possible algorithm failure
when the thermal image resolution is increased. Time
of processing also increases when resolution increases.
Temperature detection. A classifier algorithm for
temperature detection was developed by using the
RGB color model and the chromatic modeling by
relating
TLC
film temperatures
with
colors
and
calculating
distance
separation
between
each
temperature and the evaluated pixel in thermal image.
73
International Journal On Advances in Systems and Measurements, vol 2 no 1, year 2009, http://www.iariajournals.org/systems_and_measurements/

Minimum separation distance was taken for estimating
temperature in the evaluated pixel.
Three-dimensional
thermal
pattern
reconstruction. The three-dimensional reconstruction
of ultrasound thermal beamshape gives the possibility
to know the radiation pattern (temperature distribution)
and penetration depth which are important medical
parameters for ultrasound physiotherapy treatment.
5. Conclusion
A thermographic technique based on TLC films to
obtain two dimensional thermal images was developed;
the practical implementation of the method is simple
and low cost, it is a suitable way for chromatic and
ultrasound therapy transducers characterization with
TLC films.
DIP allows image improvement by reducing noise
in thermal images and the possibility to manipulate
images
as
a
mathematical
representation
for
an
efficient obtainment of the required information in an
image. Adaptive filter Wiener implementation allows
reducing noise selectively enhancing definition in
thermal images and tree-dimensional reconstruction.
The color change in TLC films is related with the
chromic contribution of the components in the RGB
color
model
and
related
with
the
changes
in
temperature. The statistical analysis shows the non-
linear but regular change in the tendency for the RGB
components.
Tests
with
different
TLC
films
in
controlled environmental conditions are necessary
trying to find a general mathematic model that
describes thermochromic behavior allowing a higher
resolution and extending measurement range.
An algorithm for chromatic modeling in TLC films
based on RGB color model was developed obtaining a
mathematical relation between color and temperature
allowing a quantitative temperature measurement by
using
a
classifier
algorithm
based
on
Euclidean
distance. Neural networks are proposed for temperature
detection algorithm alternative technique.
The future work is to develop tissue equivalent
materials that mimic thermal and acoustic proprieties
for obtaining the thermal distribution and to detect
changes in beam uniformity for ultrasonic therapy
equipment.
