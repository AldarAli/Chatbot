Abstract—The progressing digitalization of factories coincides
with a growing amount of raw data being available in order
to create valuable, data driven application. The Edge Comput-
ing paradigm is one of the key enablers to realize beneﬁcial
solutions, since it helps overcome obstacles such as capacity and
latency restrictions or data privacy and protection requirements.
However, realized industrial applications of Edge Computing
Applications are rather limited as of today. Therefore, as part
of the Factory Automation Edge Computing Operating System
Reference Implementation (FAR-EDGE) project, a series of
expert interviews covering viewpoints from both industry and
academia was conducted in order to gain deeper insight on
limiting factors and development challenges and expectations.
The results are presented in this paper forming a brief snapshot
of the current perception of Edge Computing contributing to
the creation of an overall understanding of the needs of the
manufacturing industry.
Keywords–Edge Computing; Fog Computing; Survey.

INTRODUCTION
With the increase of raw data streams within factories,
the need arises to provide processing capabilities to transform
them into valuable information and act on that information in a
timely matter [1]. The rising Edge Computing (EC) paradigm
fulﬁlls this need by providing both hardware and software
capabilities [2]. There are currently three major reference
architectures with unique features in development that focus
on the challenges arising from Industry 4.0 [3]. One of them is
the FAR-EDGE reference architecture, currently applied in 13
active use cases, each focusing on one or more topics in the
ﬁeld of automation, analytics, and simulation [4]. Common
goals within the use cases are a reduction of latency, an
increase of data security and privacy protection, increasing
processing performance while maintaining a high level of
autonomy. An ideal solution would meet or even exceed these
goals while providing all services required by any production
environment. The development of such an all-in-one solution,
if even possible, requires a signiﬁcant amount of resources
and development time. For most industrial use cases, this
might be an overkill contradicting with the desire of industry
to solve their current challenges as soon as possible and
start migrating towards architectures supporting their continues
growth [5]. Therefore, focusing on fulﬁlling the requirements
of industry stakeholders is crucial for an efﬁcient adoption
and integration of the EC paradigm. While ”the research on
the emerging domain is still in its infancy” [6], and only a
few solutions being already deployed in industry, the question
which factors are most relevant and should be prioritized in the
development of reference architectures and software solutions
is left unanswered. The increasing amount of surveys on EC,
as well as similar paradigms [6]–[8], explicitly and implicitly
cover are a large variety of essential factors and beneﬁts for
edge. However, in most cases it is neglected to present the
current perception regarding the level of relevance and focus
within industry and academia. In this paper, the results of a
series of expert interviews conducted with both representatives
of industry and academia are presented. The aim is to de-
termine how EC is currently perceived within both domains.
First, ten relevant factors for EC are rated according to their
importance. Second, the necessary development distribution
over the software development process is estimated. Last, the
cost distribution throughout the life cycle is analyzed.

METHODOLOGY
This section will explain the interview questions in detail,
and deﬁne how these questions contribute to the survey.
A. Overview
As described in Section I, the project builds and realizes
its reference architecture in use cases deﬁned by two industrial
partners and a research partner within the consortium of the
FAR-EDGE project. The project consortium also consists of
several technology providers who provide software for the
use cases. To interpret how these use cases and the solu-
tions provided by technology providers match, nine expert
interviews were conducted covering all aspects differentiating
Edge Computing from Cloud Computing. The interviews are
organized for each partner individually. The interview ques-
tions were provided beforehand. However, none of the answers
of other partners were shared with anyone, whether they are
involved in the particular use case or not. The interviews were
recorded and the results transcribed accordingly accordingly
summarizing. The following sections explain the methodology
and speciﬁcally the interview questions in detail.
B. Deﬁnitions
This section will explain the questions that were asked to
both kinds of partners. The interview questions are separated
into ﬁve distinct sections. Although the questions were slightly
different for technology providers and the use case owners,
they targeted the same aspect from a different perspective. The
use case owners are namely Volvo Trucks Company (VTC),
Whirlpool (WHR), and SmartFactoryKL (SFK). Technology
provider names are obscured for reasons of conﬁdentiality.
It is important to note that the prepared factors fostering
Edge Computing applications and additional beneﬁts aim for

completeness. Even with a thorough investigation such a target
is challenging to achieve. Therefore, the interviewees were
encouraged to extend the list at any given moment if they
see the need for it.
1) Evaluation of Relevant Factors for Edge Computing:
The ﬁrst part of the interview was on the evaluation of relevant
factors for Edge Computing, that are preselected based on
prior experience, as well as literature [2], [9], [10], to measure
the use case requirements against the ﬁve imperatives of
Edge Computing, namely: latency, data ownership, autonomy,
quantity, and connectivity.
One of the key advantages of Edge Computing is to
overcome latency constraints which are one of the reasons
to prefer edge solutions over for a Cloud solution [11]. For
the use case owners, the question was the measurement of
the importance of the latency, whereas, for the technology
providers, it was whether the solution satisﬁes the latency
requirements of the use cases and if it helps improve the
latency.
Similar to latency, data ownership, or privacy and security
reasons are another cause for choosing an edge solution. Use
case owners were whether they have a security issue at the
moment and if the use case contains sensitive data. For the
technology providers, the question was whether the data they
work with is conﬁdential, and if it leaves on-premise servers,
which may cause an security issue.
Autonomy is the degree of being autonomous. In this
question, it was targeted to learn if the system can govern
itself without an operator, in case of a failure, etc. The use case
owners were asked how autonomous they desire the solution
to be. The technology providers had to answer this question
by evaluating whether their solution is autonomous or not, and
up to which degree.
Another beneﬁt of Edge Computing is being able to pre-
process the data at the ﬁeld tier, helping reduce the network
trafﬁc and reducing the raw data that is transmitted to the
Cloud. The use case owners had to answer how much data is
being generated at the ﬁeld tier, and whether this is a limit
to increase the Quality of Service (QoS). For the technology
providers, they were asked if the data being used needs to
leave the Edge for decisions, and the size of the data.
The last question in relevant factors was on interactivity
and connectivity. The use case owners were asked whether the
actual setup needs multiple machinery to be communicated
with each other for a successful production. The technology
providers needed to answer if their solution always relies on
the connection outside Edge, and if the solution allows even
sub-components of the machinery interact with each other.
2) Importance of Additional Edge Computing Beneﬁts: The
second part of the interview was to decide on the importance
of requirements of Edge Computing. These requirements were
reliability, scalability, extensibility, abstraction, and interoper-
ability, and partly taken from literature [10], [12].
An edge solution is intended to keep servicing without
an internet connection. Use case owners were asked how
important it is that the system works reliably, meaning how
the production would be affected if a failure occurs. For the
Individual Software Vendors (ISVs), it was asked whether their
software can recover itself in case of a failure, and how the
software affects the production in case if stops responding.
Scalability describes the capacity of the solution to adapt to
its increasing users and products, whereas extensibility is more
focused on the functionality. In scalability context, for the use
case owners, it is asked whether they foresee an increase in
the product and user base count. In the same context, the ISVs
answered whether their solution supports a big number of users
and products. Similarly, for extensibility, use case partners
were asked whether they plan to deploy new services, devices,
or functionality to their production plants. For the technology
providers, we asked whether their software is extensible with
minimum (re-)conﬁguration if such deployments were made.
Modiﬁcations in the production systems may require low-
level tweaks or conﬁgurations. These changes may break
existing solutions. Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
introduced by abstraction can enable more straightforward
conﬁguration and better backward compatibility. Use case
owners were asked if the plant structure is likely to change.
Furthermore, the intention was to learn if they develop internal
software which interacts with the edge solution. The technol-
ogy partners answered whether their software could be used
in legacy machines and if their solution introduces APIs to
abstract the complexity.
Interoperability is an essential factor for complex systems
since relying on a single proprietary solution may cause vendor
lock-in problems in case the solution is no more updated or
non-available. Working with too many solutions can also cause
compatibility problems, which may require additional adapters
and wrappers. The use case partners answered the degree
of interaction between existing components from different
providers.
3) Development Time Distribution for an Application: This
part of the interview targeted the estimated time distribution
(in percentage) of development for an application. Similar to
Section II-B1 and Section II-B2, the deﬁnition of an applica-
tion for both type of partners differ. For the use case partners,
this section focused on the AS-IS and TO-BE values during
the planning phase of the use case and the implementation
of the solution without an edge solution. For the ISVs, this
section took values for the designed or implemented TO-BE
Edge application.
Time distribution values were collected in seven categories:
(1) analysis, (2) design, (3) implementation and build (4)
deployment, (5) testing, (6) revision, and (7) training. In the
analysis, the use case partners report the time needed to
analyze their non-edge solution and the current production line
to create the ideas for their use cases. For the ISVs, this time
includes the period for analyzing the use case to look for the
solutions. Design for the use case partners includes the time to
design the use case, including its requirements. For technology
partners, the design time is the duration to plan the solution
considering the requirements of the use cases. Training for use
case owners represents the time required to train the workers
or operators before introducing the edge solution. For the
technology partners, it exempliﬁes the training time spent on
instructing the edge solution.
4) Development Cost Distribution for an Application:
Similar to Section II-B3, this part collected estimated cost
distribution (in percentage) of development for an application.
Costs are typically split among one-time costs (also called
upfront costs) and recurring costs. If the solutions require no
93

additional hardware apart from server hardware, usually, the
distribution of the cost is expected to be similar to the time
distribution. Upfront costs are analysis, design, implementation
and build, deployment, testing, and training. Maintaining or
revision costs are considered as recurring costs. As the Figure
2b shows, in this part, analysis and design costs are estimated
higher than other costs.
Since determining the cost for the development the edge
applications directly is challenging to upright impossible,
the interview questions are designed so that the only the
distribution of costs can be estimate based on the current
progress of the development. At the end of the project, the
estimated values will be compared with the actual numbers. If
a technology provider is involved in more than one use case,
the respective questions were repeated for each use case they
are participating in. Additionally, contingency costs, which
are unexpected costs, are going to be added after the project
completion, if any exist.
5) Hardware and Software Distribution: The last part of
the interview collected the distribution of the hardware and
software for the TO-BE solution, to decide the tendency of the
solution concerning hardware and software, in percentage. If a
use case is only software-based, then the hardware questions
such as reliability in Section II-B2, were unrelated.
The following section will summarize the results of the
interviews explained in previous sections.
III.
RESULTS
Figure 1 summarizes the answers given to the ﬁrst two
parts of the interviews. The scenario column contains the use
case owners, followed by the use case ID and the interviewee
(actual names are obscured for reasons of conﬁdentiality).
The next two columns contain the evaluation results for the
ﬁrst and second part of the interview, respectively. The range
from one to seven deﬁnes the importance of the attributes:
one meaning not applicable, and seven being crucial. The
presented attributes can be considered complete, as throughout
all interviews no interview partner saw the need to adapt those
in any way.
Third part of the interview is summarized in Figure 2a.
The ﬁgure shows the development time distribution of six
providers and three use case owners. Figure 2b depicts the
development cost distribution of the edge solution. Similar to
the development time distribution, the ﬁgure summarizes the
answers of six technology providers and three use case owners.
IV.
DISCUSSION
Interview results showed that the technology providers and
use case owners are well aligned concerning the chosen factors
for Edge Computing and solutions covering additional edge
criteria. The proposed list of relevant factors for Edge Com-
puting did not have to be extended based on the interviews.
Thus, the ﬁve chosen attributes - Latency, Data Ownership,
Autonomy, Data Quantity and Connectivity - can be considered
as sufﬁcient when assessing Edge Computing implementations.
As it may be noticed, one solution partner may rate the
importance differently for different use cases. This is the case
when the solution partner provided a different solution for that
use case.
Focusing on Figure 1, the results can be interpreted in the
following ways.
Unexpectedly, latency and data quantity factors were not
critical due to reported low data transfer rates outside the
factories. Only WHR use case requires that it has a very high
importance, since the whole factory generates high trafﬁc for
actions to be taken.
For data ownership, the industrial use case owners see
this criteria rather low, which might surprise at ﬁrst - In the
project, however, the agreement was made to not share any
data meaning that even very low would already mean that their

data will not leave the boundaries of their factory. However, the
test laboratory SFK contains hardware/software that is not yet
robust and is prone to cyberattacks from within the network.
This increases the necessity for each device/platform to contain
the data accordingly.
In automation use cases (VTC #1-#3, WHR #1, SFK #2-
#7), autonomy, and in analytics use cases, scalability and
extensibility factors have higher importance than others. Edge
solutions are given partial responsibility of the automation
tasks. This leads to Autonomy being a crucial feature in
the industrial use cases, except VTC use case #4. SFK is
not affected from this criteria, as the factory has already
been designed to work autonomously. Similarly, importance of
reliability is very high in average, for the industrial partners
and the solution providers. However, as SFK is a test labo-
ratory, the solutions are developed to test the new technology
inside, before applying them in the industrial world. Therefore,
reliability is not vital for the prototypical applications. SFK as
a test laboratory also requires very high extensibility, since
one of its goals is to provide modular factory with minimal
(re-)conﬁguration. Provider #6 in ﬁfth SFK use case seems to
provide no extensibility for this use case, however, it can be
discarded as the extensibility part of the use case is satisﬁed

by the Provider #3 in the same use case.
Abstraction importance is above high, as the solutions
are asked to reduce the complexity of the existing systems.
Vertically, except the fourth use case of VTC, which is a
simulation, based on models, for all partners, it is important
to increase backward compatibility for future technologies or
allow legacy systems to continue functioning properly.
Interoperability is very important or even crucial for some
partners. Except the ﬁfth use case from VTC, which is an
analytics use case consisting of only event identiﬁers, all use
case owners and use case partners require and give above high
attention to this factor. As the factories of the industrial part-
ners are composed of components from different companies,
interoperability will improve the efﬁciency once they scale, and
prevent vendor lock-in problems. SFK also aims to continue
the highly interoperable approach together with the solutions.
With respect to the development time distribution, the
results seen in Figure 2a can be discussed as follows:
The high percentage of time spent on analysis is expected,
as it means examination of the production plan for use case
owners, and analysis of the given use case for the software
providers. Similarly, design means sketching the use case for
use case owners and designing the software for the given
use case for software providers. The high training amount
in analytics use cases are due to user interaction via the
dashboard. However, the beneﬁts of using analytics solutions
reduce the time spent on evaluation of monitoring values,
directly affecting maintenance time in the future, hence the
costs. Less time requirement for deployment and testing can be
explained as the deployment is mainly the software installation.
Similarly, the project executes unit tests in component level
during development, therefore, only ﬁnal testing is conducted
after deployment. Likewise, results collected for the develop-
ment cost distribution shown in Figure 2b, can be interpreted
as following:
The
high
cost
requirement
on
design
and
build/implementation phase is directly related to the time
values. Since most of the solutions are software-based,
software development time is aligned with its costs. Use case
owners and software providers agree that most resources are

expected to be spent on designing and build/implementation
steps. Furthermore, the costs are desired to be minimized for
maintenance and upgrading after going for the edge solution.
Analytics technology provider foresees neither mainte-
nance nor upgrade costs after deployment. This is because
once the software is run, it can easily be scaled or extended
to service the needs. Moreover, they do not expect to provide
an upgrade to the ﬁnal solution.
As mentioned in Section II-B5, the last part of the interview
was to identify the percentage of hardware and software usage
by the partners. As it can be seen from Figure 3, the results
show that the use case partners, namely Whirlpool (WHR),
Volvo Trucks Company (VTC), and SmartFactoryKL (SFKL),
are the partners who contribute to the project with more
hardware than software.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Edge Computing is a recent paradigm, which moves com-
puting power, applications and services from centralized units
into the logical extremes or at the closest locations to the
source and provides data processing power there. Factory
Automation Edge Computing Operating System Reference
Implementation (FAR-EDGE) is one of the ongoing actions on
Edge Computing, which focuses on three functional domains:
automation, simulation, and analytics. In this work, interviews
were organized with all consortium members; ﬁrstly, to get
feedback from the partners and to ﬁgure out, to which degree
Edge Computing is a better alternative to the Cloud for speciﬁc
use cases. Secondly, comparing the answers from use case
owners and Individual Software Vendors (ISVs), to understand,
how many of the important factors have been covered by the
developed
or in progress
solutions. Thirdly, to identify the
driving factors and beneﬁts as perceived by both, solution
providers and use case owners. Finally, to give a breakdown
of the estimated development time and development costs to
assess which step takes the most resource during development
and the degree of decrease in the development time with the
edge solution.
The ﬁndings in the survey are depicted in the ﬁgures in
Section II-B3 and Section II-B4. Main ﬁndings from these
ﬁgures can be derived as follows: (1) the industrial partners
do not want to distribute their production related data, or they
only plan to distribute non-identifying data, which increases
the importance of data ownership, (2) except for simulation use
cases or the simulation sections of the use cases, importance
of abstraction is above very high, to support the legacy
systems and to provide increased backward compatibility in
the future, (3) automation use cases require that the autonomy
is crucial for the factories due to production rates, and to
reduce the amount of time for conﬁgurations or setup, (4)
the solutions provided for the industrial partners need to be
reliable as downtimes in factories reduce the efﬁciency and
the productivity, however, for the test laboratory the prototypes
can be deployed easier for further testing. Moreover, most of
the development time and the costs are expected to be spent
during the analysis and design time. Some of the use case
owners target reducing the deployment time whereas some of
the technology providers foresee that their solution will require
neither maintenance nor upgrade.
As mentioned in Section I, this paper described the report
of the initial evaluation results, which are going to be compared
with the factual numbers after project is completed. This
research included nine consortium members which is not yet
ideal to get a clear picture. In the future, it is planned to
increase the amount of participants to get a clearer view on
the criteria.
