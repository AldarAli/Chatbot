 INTRODUCTION  
It is well known that he Internet traffic has been 
growing exponentially and it is projected that the zettabyte 
level in data exchange will be exceeded in year 2017. It is 
also projected that the traffic from video services and peer-
to-peer file sharing will comprise the majority of the 
Internet traffic. The wireless connectivity through (4/5G+) 
mobile networks and widespread use of mobile traffic for 
social networking has also become an integral part of the 
overall networking picture since it provides a large 
contribution to the never ending bandwidth demand in 
optical networks.  
All applications mentioned above will demand an 
extremely large throughput in different optical networking 
segments (i. e., in access, metro and core), which means that 
high aggregate information capacity of optical links will be 
required. It is envisioned that current 100 Gb/s Ethernet 
(100 GbE) in converged optical packet networks will be 
eventually overlaid with 400 Gb/s Ethernet (400 GbE) and 
1Tb/s Ethernet (TbE).  Down the road, 1+TbE (specifically 
4 TbE) and even 10+ TbE) will become a relevant topic 
when talking about Terabit optical networking [2]. We 
should also mention that the total data traffic in aggregation 
(metro and regional) networking segment just recently 
exceeded the data traffic carried over by core optical 
networks. 
Demand for higher information capacity is closely 
related to request that the information bandwidth in next 
generation networks is more flexible and highly dynamic 
and elastic in nature. The elastic and dynamic behavior 
requires that the data bit rate and signal spectral efficiency 
can be changed dynamically based on the traffic conditions 
and/or signal quality along specified lightpath (which is 
commonly related to the optical signal to noise ratio 
(OSNR). The point is that an automated action should be 
taken to adjust the bit rate/spectral efficiency, which is done 
by change in modulation/multiplexing scheme or in coding 
strength. This adjustment becomes necessity for aggregation 
networks, since their dominance in terms of the overall data 
traffic [1]. Accordingly, we can say that a higher attention 
should be given to the metro networking in order to satisfy 
both high information capacity and dynamic connectivity 
requests.  However, the logic about capacity and 
connectivity applies also to other networking segments 
(optical access networks and data center networks, and core 
networks), which are all connected to the metro networks 
[3] [4].  
In this paper, we will discuss the advanced schemes 
enabling high information capacity of optical channels and 
develop scenario for design of future superchannels by 
using parallelism and multidimensional structure. The paper 
is organized as follows. In next section, we will analyze 
spectral efficiency of optical channels through employed 
basis functions and identify multidimensional modulation 
and multiplexing schemes that contribute to information 
capacity increase. In Section III, we will apply optimized 
channel design to scenarios related to aggregate and core 
optical networks. Finally, in Section IV, we will make the 
relevant conclusions.  
II. 
SPECTRAL EFFICIENCY INCREASE IN NEXT-GEN 
NETWORKS 
It is interesting to observe that the IP traffic growth has 
the same dynamics as the speed of processors (Moore’s 
law), which we illustrated in Figure 1. Having in mind the 
past connection between data rates of IP routers ports and 
speed of processors related to that, we can envision 
connection between projected dynamics of the speed (or bit 
rates) of serial optical interfaces carrying IP traffic and 
speed of processors, which is also illustrated in Figure 1.  
The key point is that both the driving forces and key 
enabling components are subjects of an exponential 
dynamics, which means that the speed of optical line 
interfaces (channels) should advance with the same pace as 
speed of processors.  Since we will be dealing with ultra-
high processor speeds and line bit rates, we can expect that 
both objectives will be achieved only if parallel approach is 
applied. 
The 
parallelism 
in 
design 
means 
that

multidimensional 
approach 
in 
signal 
processing 
is 
underlining factor for information capacity increase. The 
parallelism/multidimensionality in optical networks can be 
imposed through modulation and multiplexing schemes, 
which is not a trivial task since there are a number of 
parameters that can be incorporated in an optimum high-
speed optical channel design.  
 
 
The increase in spectral efficiency of optical channels is 
precondition for overall throughput in high-speed optical 
networks. Optical channel construction can be done by fully 
utilizing all available basis function (amplitude, phase, time, 
frequency, space, and polarization) through parallelization 
and arrangement that would maximize information capacity 
of fiber links. Generally, any set of real-valued energy 
signals {si(t)} can be expressed as a linear combination of D 
orthonormal basis functions {j}, as [5]

    (1b) 
 
 
where 
M 
relates 
to 
well-known 
amplitude-phase 
constellation diagrams containing M states where symbols 
can reside, while Ts specifies symbol interval. The 
parallelism in signal representation in (1a,b), should be 
translated to modulation format design. The illustration of 
basis 
functions 
commonly 
considered 
for 
channel 
construction is presented in Figure 2. 
When talking about increased spectral efficiency of 
amplitude-phase modulation formats with the constellation 
diagram of size M, it is possible to design some other 
structure different than conventional M-QAM formats. The 
design of these formats, also known as two-dimensional 
ones, can be done with respect to established constraints and 
optimization criteria (such as minimum mean square error 
(MMSE), minimum bit error rate (BER), minimum energy 
consumption, minimum latency, etc., as presented in [5] [6]  
[7]. We should outline that construction of advanced 
modulation formats based on specified criteria is still widely 
open research process.   
Two-dimensional modulation formats with amplitude 
and phase as basis functions is commonly extended to more 
complex four-dimensional form if polarization state is used 
as additional basis.  New format is different than polarization 
division multiplexing scheme since in four-dimensional 
signaling scheme only one mapper is used with four 
coordinates (amplitude, phase, x-polarization and y-
polarization), which  serve as inputs to corresponding I/Q 
modulators. With this approach, we can increase the 
Euclidean 
distance 
among 
neighboring 
points 
in 
constellation diagram and thus improve the OSNR, which 
can be essential in scenario with expected high impact of 
nonlinearities [5] [8].  
The 
further 
parallelization 
in 
optical 
channel 
construction can be achieved by including the frequency as 
the signaling basis function, while keeping the Nyquist 
orthogonality criterion represented by raised cosine function 
spectral shape. In this format, known as the orthogonal 
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) [5] [8] [9],  the 
total spectrum is arranged with multiple overlapping optical 
(sub)-carriers that form a single channel, commonly 
recognized as superchannel. It has been proven that, with an 
arbitrary number of optical subcarriers per superchannel, a 
multiterabit capacity per channel can be realized [10] [11]. 
The OFDM subcarriers in superchannel are spaced apart by 
fSC , which is equal to the symbol rate RSC of the signal 
applied to them leading to an aggregate bit rate of an OFDM 
based channel equal to RS = RSC NSC, where NSC is number of 
subcarriers (assuming the same rate for each subcarrier). 
The Nyquist based overlapping can be also achieved in time 
domain by applying Nyquist WDM scheme, which produces 
the most efficient way of the signal multiplexing in time 
domain [10].  
The orthogonal polynomials or orthogonal prolate 
spheroidal wave (OPSW) functions can be considered 
instead of orthogonal subcarrier [9], which is a promising 
way of introduction of the time basis function. If OPSW 
functions are used as orthonormal basis {j} in Eqn. (1), the 
pulse duration and the bandwidth of the OPSW functions 
will stay almost unchanged regardless of the associated 
order value. The OPSW functions are simultaneously time-
limited to symbol duration Ts and bandwidth-limited to 
bandwidth , which is essential property while considering 
spectral efficiency increase. They can be obtained as 
solutions of the following integral equation [9]

where the coefficient j  is related to the energy 
concentration in the interval [-Ts/2, Ts/2]. The use of 
orthogonal polynomials/OPSW means that two basis 
functions (in-phase and quadrature components associated 
with amplitude/phase arrangement) are replaced with the set 
of 2M basis, thus producing arbitrary multidimensional 
schemes that can be eventually combined with polarization 
as a basis function. 
The next dimension in parallel multidimensional 
approach aimed to increase the spectral efficiency is the 
space basis function employed through spatial multiplexing 
technique applied within the same optical fiber [13] [14].  
By using a novel class of optical fibers known as few-mode 
fibers (FMF) and few-core fibers (FCF), a number of 
orthogonal spatial modes can be supported. Since each 
spatial mode can be independently modulated with signals 
already employing other basis function mentioned above 
while essentially occupying the same spectral bands, the 
total spectral efficiency will be increased in proportion with 
the number Nmode of spatial modes. As an example, the MCF 
fiber with 7 cores is shown in Fig 2c, in which the central 
core is FMF supporting 4 modes.

The sophisticated forward error correction (FEC) 
coding applied on advanced multidimensional modulation 
and multiplexing schemes is an essential component that 
contributes to the information capacity increase. The FEC 
process means that some number of redundant symbols 
(which is inversely proportional to the code rate R<1; R is 
the ratio between input information bits/symbols and output 
coded bits/symbols) have been introduced [5]. They are 
inserted into data stream in accordance with the specific 
mathematical algorithms in order to verify the signal health 
and to make a correction of wrongly detected symbols. With 
FEC in place, the OSNR requirements for a specific 
information bit rate and modulation format are relaxed, 
which means that the channel capacity over specified 
distance is brought to be closer to the Shannon’s limit [15]. 
Although coding, modulation, and multiplexing are 
commonly considered as separate serial functions, they can 
also be performed in parallel manner through coded 
modulation approach. In such a way, the main functions that 
involve intense digital signal processing are effectively 
performed at much lower symbol rates [16]. Also, the coded 
modulation schemes are inherently adaptive in nature, 
which is highly desirable for applications in elastic network 
scenarios when dealing with changing network conditions 
(dynamic traffic flow and variable impact of impairments). 
In an adaptive coded modulation scheme, the appropriate 
code rate (error correction strength) can be selected based 
on information about the destination and link conditions to 
match to the required OSNR. Design of advanced coding 
schemes is still widely open research area, and there is 
expectation that the coding gain for more advanced FEC 
schemes will exceed 12 dB with coding rate R≥ 0.8, [17] 
[18]. It appears that a nonbinary low density parity coding 
LDPC-coded modulation is an approach for achieving a 
high coding gain. In an adaptive scheme, both the 
appropriate code rate (error correction strength) and 
modulation/multiplexing scheme are subject to adjustment 
based on information about the required data flow and 
transmission link conditions to match to the required OSNR 
[19]. 
III. 
MULTIDIMENSIONAL ASPECTS IN AGGREGATION AND 
CORE OPTICAL NETWORKS 
Currently, the standardized dual polarization (DP-
QPSK) modulation in predominant format used for creation 
of 100 GbE lightpaths in metro and core optical network 
segments. However, the need for 400 GbE and 1TbE line 
transport has become highly evident, thus requiring the most 
appropriate solutions in design of optical superchannels 
with an intention to reduce the number of subcarriers by 
increasing the size of constellation diagram. By using 
optimized multidimensional structure, we have developed 
implementation scenarios for future high-speed optical 
superchannels, with several options presented in Table 1. It 
quite realistic that practical solution will be based on 
400Gb/s rate per carrier in superchannel structure, while the 
number of amplitude-phase constellation points can vary  
depending on network conditions and transmission length, 
with possible interchange between formats. We envision 
that 32 constellation points are quite realistic in near future, 
which means that achieved spectral efficiency will be ~6.9 
b/s/Hz, while required OSNR will be ~23 dB. As for 1 TbE 
channels, if faster electronics is used for sampling and only 
a single carrier modulated with DP-32-QAM is employed, 
achieved spectral efficiency will be ~6.8 b/s/Hz with the 
required OSNR of ~27 dB.  Some other options for bit rates 
of various Ethernet interfaces (including futuristic version of 
4 TbE and 10 TbE) are also shown in Table 1.

If DP-32-QAM format is applied with the coding rate 
of 0.8, the required sampling rate would be ~295 
GSamples/s, while required OSNR value will be ~27 dB. In 
such a case, achieved spectral efficiency will be ~6.8 
b/s/Hz. If multicarrier superchannel is constructed for 4 TbE 
and 10 TbE rates bit rates, the required sampling rate can be 
reduced to be approximately (295 GSamples)/Nmode, where 
Nmode is the number of spatial modes that is used. This will 
also relax the OSNR requirements for at least 3 dB, if two 
spatial modes are used.

CONCLUSION  
 
Design of future high-speed optical networks is a 
challenging task. Optical channel design is essential and 
there is a number of possible options to maximize network 
performance while satisfying both the need for higher 
information capacity of optical links and the need for 
dynamic adjustment of data flows along the selected optical 
lightpaths. In this paper we presented methodology for a 
multidimensional channel design, which includes and 
intense signal processing in both time and frequency 
domains, and applied it to metro/core networking scenarios. 
We presented multidimensional design of future ultra-high 
speed 4TbE and 10 TbE interfaces and identified key 
parameters that would enable not only the highest 
information capacity, but a dynamic adjustment of date 
flows as well.
