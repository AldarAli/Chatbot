Abstract— The main objective of this study is to assess the
relative importance of the ten key requirements proposed by
Thomas H. Davenport that will help a firm capitalize on
business analytics 3.0. Drawing on data collected from 34
experts in the field through an online survey, the study assesses
the relative importance of each requirement and proposes a set
of new complementary requirements. Finally, implications for
business analytics research, theory and practice are discussed.

I.
INTRODUCTION
Big data analytics (BDA) and related topics have
attracted a huge interest from both scholarly and business
literatures [1] [2] [3], mainly due to their high operational
and strategic potentials. For example, the BDA market that
includes sales of related hardware, software and services was
estimated to about $18.6 billion in 2013, representing an
approximate growth rate of almost 58% over 2012 [4]. The
worldwide market of BDA is expected to reach $125 billion
in 2015 [5].
Recently, Thomas H. Davenport [1] pointed out that we
were moving into the ‘Analytics 3.0’ era, an era in which
‘big data will power consumer products and services’. Even
if business analytics 3.0 holds the capability of transforming
competition and thus competitive advantage, many managers
are still struggling to capture its business value. In order to
help a firm capitalize on business analytics (BA) 3.0,
Thomas H. Davenport proposed 10 requirements. However,
we know from the information technology (IT) innovation
history that the acceptance of any given IT innovation within
the business ecosystem depends on the change of the
perceived benefits or risks related to the said innovation.
Therefore, it is critical to assess the importance of the
proposed
10
requirements
as
enablers
of
competitive
advantage though the adoption and use of ‘Analytics 3.0’.
More specifically, the main objective of this study is to
answer the following questions:
•
What
is
the
relative
importance
of
the
10
requirements proposed by
Thomas H. Davenport
[1]?
•
Are we missing some important requirements?
The paper is organized as follows. After the introduction
in Section 1, we discuss some of the relevant papers for the
study, with an emphasis on business analytics requirements,
as well as a discussion on the 10 requirements proposed by
Thomas H. Davenport [1] in Section 2. In Section 3, we
present the methodology used in the study. In Section 4, our
results and discussion are presented. Finally, we conclude the
study and propose some future research directions in Section
5.

LITERATURE REVIEW
IT has been recognized as an important tool for firm
optimization
for
high
level
competitive
advantage
achievement and realization. However, we know from the IT
innovation history that the acceptance of any given IT
innovation within the business ecosystem depends on the
change of the perceived benefits or risks related to the said
innovation. The Internet is the classic example. Indeed,
developed in the early 1970s, Internet acceptance by the
business ecosystem only happened in the late 1990s mainly
because of the “change in the business perceptions of value
based on the advent of fast, reliable and low cost hypertext
markup
language
applications”
[6].
Radio
frequency
identification, another IT innovation that is considered to be
at the core of the so called ‘Internet of Things’ was expected
to transform how firms conduct their operations [7].
However, recent studies on the topic showed that the
adoption and use of RFID is slower that predicted mainly
because of technological, data management, security and
privacy, organisational and financing issues [7] [8].
In [9], the author suggests not starting a big data project
unless a firm has a clear business objective to achieve with
the adoption and use of big data. He further proposes to
make sure that any firm that is planning to access internal
and external data sources needs to secure this access (e.g.,
using Application programming interface, pricing in case of
external data sources), and develop mechanisms that ensure
of the data quality.
According to [10] : “big data isn’t just data growth, nor is
it a single technology; rather, it’s a set of processes and
technologies that can crunch through substantial data sets
quickly to make complex, often real-time decisions”. She
argued that big data analytics will require an “infrastructure
that spreads storage and compute power over many nodes, in
100

EMERGING 2016 : The Eighth International Conference on Emerging Networks and Systems Intelligence

order to deliver near-instantaneous results to complex
queries”.
In [11], the authors suggest that the realization of the
high operational and strategic potential of big data in the
healthcare context requires:
a clear understanding of user
needs and requirements of the various stakeholders of
healthcare
(e.g.,
patients,
clinicians
and
physicians,
healthcare
provider,
payers,
pharmaceutical
industry,
medical product suppliers and government), followed by the
alignment of this objective with big data technologies.
In [12], the author proposes the top 5 requirements that
make big data work for all stakeholders involve in an
adoption project, namely: (1) the necessity of having a good
big data infrastructure, (2) no need to pre-plan, pre-think, or
pre-limit your analysis, (3) the ability to analyze the data
universe, (4) pre-built analytics to do analysis faster, and (5)
easy to use with familiar, excel-like interface.
In [13], a scholar from the firm SAS highlights a seven
steps strategy necessary for realizing the full potential of big
data : (1) data collection from various data sources that are
distributed
across multiple nodes (e.g., a grid
which
processes a subset of data in parallel), (2) process that
analyses the data, (3) management of data (e.g. data needs to
be understood, defined, annotated, cleansed and audited for
security purposes), (4) measure (e.g., measure the rate at
which data can be integrated with other customer behaviors
or records, and whether the rate of integration or correction
is
increasing
over
time).
She
argued
that
“business
requirements should determine the type of measurement and
the ongoing tracking”, (5) consume. Here, Dyche [13]
argues that we need to make sure that “the resulting use of
the data should fit in with the original requirement for the
processing”, (6) store: for storage, Dyche
states that
“whether the data is stored for short-term batch processing or
longer-term
retention,
storage
solutions
should
be
deliberately addressed”, (7) data governance that includes the
policies and oversight of data from a business perspective.
For Dyche, “data governance applies to each of the six
preceding stages of big data delivery. By establishing
processes and guiding principles, governance sanctions
behaviors around data. And big data needs to be governed
according to its intended consumption. Otherwise, the risk is
disaffection of constituents, not to mention overinvestment”.
In [2], the authors defined BDA as a holistic approach to
manage, process and analyze the “5 Vs” data-related
dimensions (i.e., volume, variety, velocity, veracity and
value) in order to create actionable insights for sustained
value delivery, measuring performance and establishing
competitive advantages. Therefore, it is critical to look at
each requirement related to the BDA “5 Vs” to achieve
expected business value.
III.
METHODOLOGY
Given the exploratory nature of the adoption and use of
big data and analytics for improved decision making and
competitive advantage, as well as the scarcity of prior studies
on these topics, a web-based survey was used to collect data
among big data and analytics experts. The survey was
designed using the 10 requirements proposed by Thomas H.
Davenport [1]. Each requirement was measured using a
seven-point Likert scale with anchors ranging from strongly
disagree (1) to strongly agree (7). Also, all respondents were
asked to specify any new requirement they believed is very
important in achieving the expected business value from big
data and analytics. The data collection started on the
February 11, 2014 and ended on March 13, 2014. A
personalized invitation was sent to 37 big data and analytics
experts identified via LinkedIn specialized groups on big
data and analytics. Of the 37 invited experts, 35 agreed to
participate in the study. After a careful analysis of all
responses, we found that 34 questionnaires were correctly
filled out and appropriate for further analysis.
IV.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
TABLE I presents the analysis of respondents by age,
gender, and the level of education. From the table, we can
see that the vast majority of the respondents are aged more
that 50+ (18 (51%)), followed by 10 (29%) who are aged
between 34-41 years old. Also, we have 6 respondents (17%)
that are aged between 42-49 years. Only 1 respondent is aged
between 26-33 years. The same table shows that 86% of
respondents are males and 14% are females. Regarding the
level
of
education,
97%
of
the
respondents
hold
a
postgraduate degree (Masters or Ph.D.), and only one
respondent (3%) has an undergraduate degree, and thus
showing that the panel of experts is clearly dominated by
very
highly
educated
people.
Finally,
the
sample
is
composed of respondents with a range of profile and
responsibilities’ including: President or CEO (2), Assistant
Professor (2), Professors (Marketing, MIS, Operations and
Information Systems) (10), Assistant Commissioner (1),
Director (e.g., Operations and practice lead, Purchasing) (4),
Consultants
(2),
Associate
Professor
(4),
Partner
(1),
Doctoral Researcher (1). It should be noted that not all
respondents provided their title and responsibilities.

TABLE III presents a summary of the important points
related
to
the
assessment
of
the
10
proposed
BA
requirements.
From the table, we can observe that all respondents, by
and large, agree with all proposed requirements by [1]. All
the requirements have an average rating higher than 5 and 8
out of 10 of the requirements have an average rating higher
than 6. This suggests that the panels not only validate the
proposed 10 requirements but also agree with their relative
importance in capturing the business value from BA. Based
on the rating, the top 4 requirements are as follow: “R1:
Multiple types of data often combined” (1st), “R10: New
ways of deciding and managing” (2nd), “R2: A new set of
data management options” and “R6: Cross-disciplinary data
teams” both in the 3rd place.
From the answers of the respondents regarding new
important requirements that are missing from Thomas H.
Davenport [1], we generated a consolidated list of four (4)
high level requirements namely: 1. Corporate culture and
capability, 2. Social issues (e.g., ethic, privacy, legal), 3.
Analytics tools capability (e.g., data and results presentation,
visualization) and 4.Talent management (e.g., training,
skills). These are the four important requirements suggested
by our panel members (TABLE IV.).

Regarding the corporate culture and capability, for
example, our respondents believe that corporations should
develop their ability to analyse situations rather than making
decisions mostly on positional power, distinguish between
issues that require qualitative vs. quantitative analysis, and
evaluate and analyse information (e.g., widespread numeracy
in corporations). Also, corporate culture must view analytics
as a business decision instead of a technology issue and
should couple data science with business judgment in order
to leverage investment in analytics. Furthermore, corporate
success
in
deploying
analytics
should
be
to
answer
contemporary business questions with strategic impact.
Regarding social issues (e.g., ethics, privacy, legal), our
respondents believe that firms should start paying attention
to these important issues. They estimate that ethics is an
important issue in data gathering and use for big data. Also,
firms should consider legal and social ramifications (e.g.,
privacy and ethic) of new analytics techniques and results
when applied to big data (e.g., social media).
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
In this study, we were interested by the assessment of the
10 requirements proposed by Thomas H. Davenport [1] in
order to capture the business value from Analytics 3.0,
followed by the exploration
and the identification of
complementary requirements. First, the study confirms the
importance of all the 10 requirements proposed by Thomas
H. Davenport
[1] in capturing the business value from
Analytics 3.0.
Also, a set of four complementary requirements was
identified namely: 1. Corporate culture and capability, 2.
Social issues, 3. Analytics tools capability and 4. Talent
management. These requirements can be used by managers
to direct their effort when exploring the potential of
analytics 3.0.
While this list of requirements represents a starting point
for future studies, the list may not reflect a majority of
analytics 3.0 users across industries. In addition, the study
only focuses on key requirements of business analytics 3.0.
proposed by Thomas H. Davenport
[1]. Future research
needs conduct a robust literature review to identify an
improved list of key requirements of business analytics 3.0.
Also, it would be interesting to validate our final list of
requirements using a case study or a Delphi study. Also, it
will be fascinating to explore the importance of these
requirements
across
various
industries,
cultures,
and
countries.
