Abstract—Technology must help information professionals
collect data and analyze it. For this reason, a robot called
Chatcontext, programmed with Artificial Intelligence (AI), was
developed in order to promote interview mastery among
students in the creative industries. This technology responds to
the need to develop the ability to prepare clear and relevant
questions
that
address
various
types
of
sources.
The
information compiled must serve to generate journalistic texts
and research reports of a qualitative nature. Students of
journalism and qualitative research courses at Tecnologico de
Monterrey, Mexico, worked during the February-June 2020
semester
with
Chatcontext.
The
results
indicated
an
improvement in the ease of learning and the usability of the
chatbot tool. In this sense, it was observed that the use of
technology keeps university education up to date and facilitates
the evaluation of qualitative factors.

INTRODUCTION
It is common for students to be tasked with seeking
information
directly
from
a
primary
source
in
communication and journalism courses. They must conduct
interviews with their informants to collect data that will
allow them to write various articles and develop qualitative
research. In this data collection process, they face different
challenges because the interviewees do not always have the
interest or willingness to provide the information.
Based on this need, a chatbot called Chatcontext was
developed
to
help
students
practice
their
interview
techniques for research and journalism courses. This robot
aims to improve students' performance, reformulate their
questions using Artificial Intelligence (AI), and provide a
platform for several practices. As an educational tool, its
principal objective is to
help students improve their
interviews using robots to practice beforehand.
The use of technological resources in communication
and journalism courses allows students to work outside of
the
classroom
and
without
their
teacher's
presence.
Practicing with the robot can generate more commitment to
mastering the technique than simply receiving instructions
and recommendations from their teachers. This is especially
relevant
during
the
COVID-19
pandemic
because
autonomous practice is possible at any place and time.
The use of technology goes hand-in-hand with the
development of digital culture and communication skills
that allow a person to recognize the particular characteristics
of real informants; this is imperative in the journalism field.
Also, technological tools must be intuitive and easy to learn.
This paper presents the results of our study as follows.
Section II provides a theoretical background. Section III
gives a description of the methodology employed. Section
IV presents the research results and Section V presents the
conclusion of this work.
II. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
The technological competencies that students already
have equip them to work using their cell phones and other
tools, which, if combined with a chatbot developed for
academic use, would allow them to improve communication
and acquire ethical skills that are necessary post-graduation.
These competencies, aligned with the institution’s educative
model, are necessary for the multimedia and multi-informed
international society that awaits them.
Reen
and
Ramnarayan
[1]
conducted
research
at
Manipal University, India, with medical students who were
allowed to generate their learning products and add them to
the work on social media. The authors concluded that this
stance, coupled with technology, allowed the students
greater autonomy, promoted critical thinking, and was
conducive
to
immediate
feedback
from
teachers
and
classmates.
Sutcliffe and Albeanu [2] mention that the journalist
must also be able to create multimedia stories using mobile
devices having relevant applications. These are useful to
researchers, considering that much contact with informants
is through face-to-face or virtual interviews, where creating
empathy is vital to building trust and obtaining information.
The task involves practicing the technique, but it also
requires considering ethics because respect for the person
who becomes the source of information is indispensable.
III. METHODOLOGY
A. Overview of the research difficulties
This study sought to measure the ease of learning and
the usability of the chatbot using the Systems Usability
Scale (EUS from its name in Spanish), created by Brooke in
92

eLmL 2020 : The Twelfth International Conference on Mobile, Hybrid, and On-line Learning

1996 to measure this type of tool, and which was adapted in
Mexico by Hedlefs Aguilar & Garza Villegas [3]. This scale
measures ten aspects of using a robot developed with
Artificial Intelligence on a Likert Scale. The robot was
developed using the IBM-Watson system, and a hybrid
application for mobile devices was generated using the
system's resources. This application
was available in
ANDROID and iOS portals. The use of AI modules allowed
structuring a conversation between the student and the bot
as if it were a real conversation, mediated by technology,
between two people, the interviewer and the interviewee.
B. Procedure
The EUS was applied at two different times using
Qualtrics software [11] to 112 students from the Journalism
and
Qualitative
Research
Methodologies
courses
at
Tecnologico de Monterrey on the Monterrey Campus (see
Table I).
The students were previously informed about the privacy
of their answers and the objectives of the research project.
Two measurements were carried out in April and May
2020. Both measurements permitted observing the usability
of the chatbot and determining if it favored learning.

For the first measurement (see Table II), the bot was fed
a series of basic questions. The students could interview
four robots, two men and two women, about their opinions
on the importance and implications of two different topics.

In the second measurement, another four robots were
also programmed to answer what they thought would
happen in the near future regarding the topic.
The selection of the topics was made based on currently
relevant issues in Mexico. The choice of the robots' sex and
professions in the exercises followed what was customarily
associated with these topics. Doing this allowed verifying
whether the students chose bots according to gender or by
popular topics.
In both exercises, the students extracted information that
they later used to carry out class activities. These were
graded and weighted according to the academic objectives
of each activity.
C. Tools
The ChatContext access screen to illustrate how students
access the app is presented in Figure 1.

IV. RESULTS
After applying the EUS, the students' means improved
in the second interaction with the bot for both factors
considered in this study (see Table III). This is observed for
usability (means of items 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9),
denominated as Factor 1. Those that represent the ease of
learning (items 4 and 10) are grouped under Factor 2. When
analyzing the means with a T-test, it was determined that
there was a significant difference (t = -2.7, p = .007) for the
means of Factor 1 as well as a significant difference for
Factor 2 (t = -3.47, p = .001). It is important to note that in
the
interview
exercise
that
led
to
the
first
EUS
measurement, each student was assigned a particular gender
of bot for gender balance. However, in the second exercise

carried out a week later, the selection of both the topic and
bot gender was free-choice on the students' part.

A. Discussion
The
results
showed
that
using
a
chatbot
allows
immediate feedback about oral communication skills in the
interview because the bot contains prepared responses for
reacting appropriately in different scenarios. Qualitatively, it
can be seen that as the tool is used more frequently, the
students' knowledge of the platform increases, and the
results demonstrate this. The application of Artificial
Intelligence aims to achieve independent learning and self-
reflection, in line with the needs of professional life in the
21st century.
The practice of journalistic work inside the academic
field allows students to develop their skills to prepare for a
professional
environment
[4].
This
is
why
important
accreditors like the Accrediting Council on Education in
Journalism and Mass Communications [5] establish as entry
requirements
to
universities
a
balance
between
the
classroom and industry.   
Likewise, without renouncing the traditional values of
the profession, journalism schools must "incorporate the
resources and digital logic" to practice professional skills
"with, in, on and through the Internet" [6] because "in some
cases, students study journalism without the intention of
entering the profession. Instead, they learn high-level
information and communication skills to advance their
liberal arts studies or to pursue a related profession" [7].
Universities are committing to offer new educational
strategies and practices aligned with social changes and
trends. Through mobile applications, it is possible to
educate professionals on how to work with cutting-edge
devices
and
software
when
requesting
information,
manipulating the data, and making it known to the public.
B. Final thoughts
The confinement caused by COVID-19 has greatly
reduced student interaction; therefore, mobile technology
has become crucial. It is important to adapt to social
conditions and understand the resources that companies are
using more and more as part of customer service or for
interaction with employees. Therefore, updating educational
paradigms for future creators and information transmitters is
vitally important.
The results show a significant improvement in the ease
of learning and usability (according to the EUS) when
performing a second interview exercise using Chatcontext.
Artificial intelligence can impact the intrinsic learning of the
tool
and
favor
the
development
of
more
natural
conversations,
allowing
the
student
to
extract
more
information when doing class exercises.
V. CONCLUSION
The use of a robot to practice class activities is not just a
call to adapt to socially-distanced education; it also takes
advantage of the technological offerings in world markets
that promote the digital literacy of students who are
preparing to be future professionals.
As Mulrennan [8] points out, students in communication
and journalism, when using social networks through mobile
devices, can take a proactive role in acquiring their skills,
develop more confidence when exploring new technologies,
and apply them in various situations. This approach is based
on a heutagogical stance that promotes autonomous and
self-determined teaching by the students [9]. In this sense,
the introduction of a chatbot in academic activities is
relevant. It allows students to practice interviews at any time
and place without limiting time or repetition of exercises. A
greater amount of practice can promote mastery of the
technique and the ability to overcome difficulties when
faced with varying and challenging answers.
It is important to note that during 2019, Internet users in
Mexico increased by 4.3 percentage points and numbered
80.6 million users, representing 70% of the population over
six years old. On the other hand, households with fixed or
mobile Internet represent only 56.4% of the population [10].
This is an indicator that the university needs to work with
various types of technology and online resources for both
the school community and society.
This exercise used a robot to extract information during
practice interviews. The activity was limited to two different
subjects. However, without a doubt, enriching the chatbot
with more information and Artificial Intelligence will
provide the opportunity for measurements and assessments
in taxonomic areas, ease of use, skills development, and
implementation in work areas beyond those contemplated in
this research project. For example, the reported chatbot
could interact with students and offer parameters that allow
predicting student behavior based on the questions, their
character, how the students ask the questions, and if their
style corresponds to formal or informal attitudes. The
possible uses of Artificial Intelligence are infinite, so it is
relevant to carry out diverse research that impacts Social
Sciences and Humanities, where remote learning offers high
potential.
Given the results, it is worthwhile to continue exercising
this Artificial Intelligence tool and see if the learning and

usability levels increase among students in the creative
industries.
The data provided by the users facilitate analyses that
reinforce the relevance of the tool and lead to understanding
its benefits as an innovation in the classroom. Undoubtedly,
these times of change in education require new ways to
connect at a distance. Using robots can be considered as
supports for literacy and comprehension in multiple areas.
They offer the advantage of maintaining the students'
attention as they engage them.
The use of this type of technology highlights the
importance of updating education for future managers. The
universities have to offer new educational strategies that
encourage students to participate more while increasing
their self-efficacy [6]. The future communicators are today's
students; therefore, universities have to offer educational
strategies relevant to future needs.
