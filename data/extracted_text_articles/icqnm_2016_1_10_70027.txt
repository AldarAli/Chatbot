Abstract—In this paper, we show that an adiabatic cycle excites
Bose particles conﬁned in a one-dimensional box. We consider a
cycle, during which a wall described by a δ-shaped potential is
applied and its strength and position are slowly varied. When the
system is initially prepared in the equilibrium ground state, the
adiabatic cycle brings all bosons into the ﬁrst excited one-particle
state, leaving the system in a nonequilibrium state. The absorbed
energy during the cycle is proportional to the number of bosons.
Keywords–Quantum mechanics; Quantum holonomy; Ultracold

INTRODUCTION
The control of a physical system in at quantum level is at
the forefront of today’s physics research. Among the research
works, the population inversion in bosonic gas has a venerable
tradition, dating back to the early years of quantum mechanics.
The quantum population inversion has been studied for its
application to lasing [1]. The quantum control of atoms and
molecules has also been investigated to realize the popula-
tion inversion [2][3]. Recently, studies of the super-Tonks-
Girardeau gas, which also involves the population inversion,
have attracted a lot of attention in both experimental and
theoretical studies of nonequilibrium cold atoms [4][5][6][7].
In the super-Tonks-Girardeau gas, which may be described by
the Lieb-Liniger model [8] with strongly attractive interaction,
the population inversion is created through an “adiabatic”
process, where the interaction strength is suddenly ﬂipped from
inﬁnitely repulsive to inﬁnitely attractive [6][9].
Such a population inversion can be induced even by an
adiabatic cycle, which can be obtained with an extension
of the adiabatic process that connects Tonks-Girardeau and
super-Tonks-Girardeau gases both to weaker repulsive and
weaker attractive regime. The repetitions of this adiabatic cycle
transform the ground state of non-interacting bosons into their
higher excited states and achieve the population inversion [10].
This is counterintuitive, since there is no external ﬁeld to drive
the ﬁnal state of the bosons away from the initial state.
There have been studies of the excitation of quantum
systems by adiabatic cycles, which is referred to as the exotic
quantum holonomy [11][12][13]. We also mention, in studies
of atomic and molecular systems under the oscillating ﬁeld,
that an adiabatic cycle involving a level crossing may excite a
quantum system [14][15].
In this paper, we examine an adiabatic cycle that excites
a system consisting of Bose particles conﬁned in a one-
dimensional box. During the cycle, we vary an additional wall
adiabatically, while the interparticle interaction is kept ﬁxed.
This is in contrast to the scheme described in [6][10], where
the interaction strength between Bose particles is an effective
adiabatic parameter. In this study, we suppose that the wall is
described by a δ-function shaped potential [16][17][18]. We
show that the ﬁrst excited one-particle state is occupied by
all the bosons to achieve the population inversion completely,
if the system is prepared to be in the ground state. Namely,
the energy gained by the bosons during the adiabatic cycle is
proportional to the number of bosons.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, the basic
setup of our model is presented in the simplest setting of one
boson. Section 3 and 4 deal with noninteracting and interacting
many bosons, respectively. The summary and the discussion
are found in Section 5.

A PARTICLE IN A BOX WITH A δ-WALL
In order to examine N Bose particles in a one-dimensional
box with an additional δ-wall, we review the single particle
case, i.e., N = 1 [18], where the system is described by the
Hamiltonian
H(g, X) = p2
2m + V (x) + gδ(x − X),
(1)
where m is the particle mass, V (x) is the conﬁnement poten-
tial, and g and X are the strength and position of δ-wall. In
particular, we assume that V (x) describes an inﬁnite square
well with the length L, i.e., V (x) = 0 for 0 < x < L and
V (x) = ∞ otherwise [16][17].
We introduce an adiabatic cycle C, which consists of three
adiabatic processes CI, CII and CIII, as shown in Figure 1.
We suppose that the δ-wall is initially absent, i.e., g = 0 in 1,
and that the system is in a stationary state initially. In the ﬁrst
part of C, which will be called CI, an impenetrable wall is
inserted at x0 adiabatically. In terms of the δ-wall, the strength
g is slowly increased from 0 to ∞, while its position X is ﬁxed
at x0 during CI. Subsequently, in the second part CII, the
position X of the impenetrable wall is adiabatically changed

Bose particles. The strength and the position of an additional δ-wall is
adiabatically varied during C.

from x0 to x1. In the last part CIII, the δ-wall at X = x1 is
adiabatically turned off. At the end of the cycle C, the δ-wall
has no effect, again.
In Figure 2, we depict the parametric dependence of
eigenenergies of the single-particle Hamiltonian H(g, X) 1
along C. Throughout this manuscript, we indicate the eigenen-
ergy E using a normalized wavenumber ¯k
¯k ≡
r
E
Nϵ,
(2)
where ϵ = (ℏπ/L)2/(2m) is the ground eigenenergy of the
particle in the inﬁnite square well.
The adiabatic time evolution of the single-particle system
along C depends on x0 and x1. In the following, we explain
the case 2
5L < x0 < 1
2L < x1 < 3
5L, which may be explained
from Figure 2. A more rigorous argument is found in [18].
First, let us consider the case that the initial state is the
ground state |1(g = 0, X = x0)⟩ of the particle in the
inﬁnite square well, where |n(g, X)⟩ denotes the n-th adiabatic
eigenstate of H(g, X) during processes CI and CIII. We will
omit to indicate (g, X) in the following. After the completion
of CI, the state vector arrives at |R1⟩, the ground state of the
right well, since we choose the right well in CII is slightly
larger than the left well. During CII, there occurs a spectral
degeneracy between |R1⟩ and |L1⟩, the ground state of the
left well. This is because the size of the left (right) well is
increasing (decreasing) during CII, and these sizes coincide at
X = L/2. At the end of CII, |R1⟩ becomes the ﬁrst excited
state, which adiabatically continued to |2⟩, which is the second
excited state of the particle in the inﬁnite square well, through
CIII. Hence, the “population inversion” in the single-particle
system occurs if the system is prepared to be in the ground
state initially.
Second, we examine the case that the initial state is the ﬁrst
excited state |2⟩, which offers the “inverse” of the population
inversion. Through the adiabatic cycle C, the system arrives
at |L1⟩ after the completion of C1, and then arrives at |1⟩ at
the end of the cycle C. Namely, either |1⟩ and |2⟩ return to
the initial states after the completion of the adiabatic cycle C
twice.
Third, let us examine the cases that the initial states are
|3⟩ and |4⟩, which are the ﬁrst and second excited state,
respectively. Now C induces an interchange of these two
states, through the intermediate states |R2⟩ and |L2⟩, which
are localized the right and left well during the process II.
A similar interchange of initial eigenstates occurs as a
result of the adiabatic cycle C, as long as we choose x0 and x1
appropriately. In general, the level crossing of the one-particle
Hamiltonian 1 during the process CII plays an important role
to determine which pairs of eigenstates are interchanged by C,
while there is no level crossing generically during the processes
CI and CIII [18].
We make a remark on the stability of the present scheme
for the one-body population inversion. A crucial point is
the stability of the adiabatic time evolution across the level
crossing during CII. The level crossing may be lifted due to
an imperfection of the impenetrable wall, i.e., the δ-wall with
an inﬁnite strength. If the level splitting is small enough, we
may employ the diabatic process around the avoided crossing
to realize the one-body population inversion. It has been shown
that an open diabatic process made of time-dependent potential
well produces the second excited state from the ground state of
a bose particle [19]. This diabatic scheme is applied to create
collective excitations of interacting bosons [19][20][21].
III.
NON-INTERACTING BOSONS
We examine the case that the number of the Bose particles
is N, assuming the absence of interparticle interaction. It is
straightforward to extend the above result for N = 1, once we
restrict the case that N bosons initially occupy the one-particle
state |n⟩. Hence, the system is in an adiabatic state of the N
bosons
|n⊗N⟩ ≡ |nn. . .n⟩,
(3)
where the one-particle adiabatic state |n⟩ is occupied by N
bosons, during CI and CIII.
If there are no interparticle interactions, the parametric
evolution of averaged wavenumber ¯k for the adiabatic N-
particle state agrees with the one of the single-particle system.
This suggests that the adiabatic cycle C of the N-particle
system with no interaction delivers the ground state |1⊗N⟩ to
the excited state |2⊗N⟩, i.e., the complete population inversion,
as seen in Figure 2. The energy that the particles acquire during
the cycle C is proportional to the number of the particles.
IV.
INTERACTING BOSONS
We examine the adiabatic cycle C for N interacting Bose
particles. We mainly examine the case that the system is
initially in the ground state. In order to conﬁrm that the N-
particle population inversion really occurs, we need to examine
the effect of the interparticle interaction.
We assume that the interparticle interaction V consists of
two-body contact interactions. Namely, we suppose that V
takes the following form
V (x1, x2, . . . , xN) = λ
X
⟨i,j⟩
δ(xi − xj),
(4)
where λ is the interaction strength, and the summation is taken
over pairs.
We also assume that the interparticle interaction is weak
enough so that the topology of the parametric dependence
of eigenenergy remains unchanged, except around the level
crossing points of the noninteracting bosons. Namely, when

the gaps of the eigenenergies between neighboring levels in
the noninteracting system are larger than a constant value, the
interparticle interaction shifts the eigenenergy at most O(λ),
according to the standard perturbation theory. For small enough
perturbative energy correction, the corresponding adiabatic
time evolution of the stationary state of the interacting bosons
closely follows the one of the noninteracting bosons.
Accordingly, under the weak interparticle interaction con-
dition, the eigenstates of the interacting bosons can be labeled
by the quantum numbers of the noninteracting bosons. For
example, the ground state of the initial and ﬁnal points of
the adiabatic cycle C may be denoted as |1⊗N(λ)⟩, whose
overlapping integral with the unperturbed state |1⊗N⟩ is large.
Also, |1⊗N(λ)⟩ can be constructed by the standard perturba-
tion theory with a small parameter λ.
On the other hand, even a weak interparticle interaction can
strongly inﬂuence the parametric evolution of energy levels in
the vicinity of level crossings by making avoided crossings.
Hence, we need to closely examine the level crossing of the
non-interacting Bose particles.
In the following, we argue that the adiabatic time evolution
closely follows the one in the noninteracting system examined
above, if the number of particles is large enough. The key is
the selection rule for the matrix element of V in the adiabatic
representation in the vicinity of the level crossings of non-
interacting Bosons.
A. “Tunneling” and direct contributions of the interaction in
N = 2
We show that the effect of the interparticle interaction is
signiﬁcantly different, depending on whether a level crossing
locates either in CII, or in CI ∪ CIII, as for the two body
case. In the former case, the relevant matrix elements may
be small since it involves only tunneling processes through
the impenetrable wall. On the other hand, in processes CI
and CIII, the matrix element cannot be negligible. However,
it turns out that there happens to be no corresponding level
crossing that affects the population inversion whose initial state
is the ground state.
The parametric evolutions of eigenenergies of the noninter-
acting two particle system are depicted in Figure 3, in terms of
the averaged wavenumber ¯k (see, 2). The parametric evolution
of the eigenenergy that connects |11⟩ and |22⟩ has a level
crossing with two eigenenergies during CII. The initial states
of these energy levels are |22⟩ and |12⟩, which are |L1L1⟩ and
|R1L1⟩ during CII, respectively.
We examine the matrix elements of the interparticle inter-
action term V between the adiabatic basis vectors |R1R1⟩,
|L1L1⟩ and |R1L1⟩. Note that |R1R1⟩ corresponds to the
initial state |11⟩ of the adiabatic cycle
⟨R1, L1|V |R1, R1⟩=
√

{ψR1(x)ψL1(x)}∗{ψR1(x)}2dx,
(5)
for example. Since the single-particle adiabatic eigenfunctions
ψL1(x) and ψR1(x) are completely localized in the left and
right wells, respectively, the overlapping integral is zero, if
the δ-wall is completely impenetrable during CII. The level
crossing accordingly remains even in the presence of the
interparticle interaction. Thus the adiabatic cycle C induces

lines indicate the levels whose initial states are |nn⟩ (n = 1, . . . , 4) Other
levels are depicted by dashed lines. Parameters are the same as in Figure 2.
the complete population inversion from |11⟩ to |22⟩, as in the
non-interacting case.
Let us examine the case that the δ-wall during CII allows
the tunneling leakage of particles due to some imperfections.
Still, we may expect that the matrix elements due to the tun-
neling corrections are exponentially small. Since the resultant
energy gap of the avoided crossing is also exponentially small,
we may expect that the diabatic process easily almost recovers
the complete population inversion.
Also, during the second process CII, the left and right part
of the well may be separated. This allows us to make the tun-
neling correction arbitrarily small. Accordingly the adiabatic
limit that follows the extremely small avoided crossing would
be difﬁcult to realize.
On the other hand, if the level crossing appears during CI
or CIII, the interparticle interaction destroys the level crossing.
In Figure 3, such an example is seen between the levels whose
initial states are |33⟩ and |24⟩, which is delivered to |R2R2⟩
and |L1L2⟩, respectively, in the absence of V .
The matrix element ⟨33|V |24⟩ does not vanish in gen-
eral, since the relevant single-particle adiabatic eigenfunctions
extend the whole box. Accordingly the level crossings are
destroyed to form avoided crossing. Thus the adiabatic process
CI for example, delivers |33⟩ and |24⟩ at the initial point of CI,
to |L1L2⟩ and |R2R2⟩, respectively. This breaks the population
inversion whose initial state is a higher excited state, e.g., the
adiabatic cycle C delivers |33⟩ to |44⟩ in the absence of the
interparticle interaction.
B. Selection rule for N = 3
Here, we show that the interparticle interaction does not
suppress the population inversion for N > 2 due to a selection
rule of V .
We explain this with the case N = 3 (Figure 4). Let
us examine the level whose initial state is |1⊗3⟩ along C.
The corresponding ﬁnal state is |2⊗3⟩ in the absence of the
interparticle interaction.
First, the interparticle interaction has no, or exponentially
small effect on the level crossing during CII, as shown in the
case of N = 2.
Second, we examine the level crossing in CIII, where
the levels whose ﬁnal states are |2⊗3⟩ and |113⟩ exhibit
crossing. We examine the matrix element of the interparticle

interaction ⟨113|V |2⊗3⟩, which vanishes since V is a two-
body interaction, and the set of quantum numbers (1, 1, 3) and
(2, 2, 2) has no common quantum number.
Still, there may be a tiny avoided crossing whose magni-
tude can be explained by the standard second-order perturba-
tion theory. We may expect that the diabatic process induces
the complete population inversion whose ﬁnal state is |2⊗3⟩.
Also, even if the interaction strength λ is moderately large,
where the topology of the level diagram remains unchanged
except that the avoided crossing becomes noticeable, the ﬁnal
state should be |113⟩, whose energy is far larger than the
ground state. In this sense, a incomplete population inversion
should be realized.
C. The population inversion for N > 2
We shall prove that the adiabatic cycle C delivers |1⊗N⟩
to |2⊗N⟩ for N > 2, even in the presence of the two-body
interparticle interaction. Here we explain the selection rule for
arbitrary N (> 2), and examine each part of the cycle C. For
example, N = 4 case is shown in Figure 5.
We explain the selection rule of the two-body interparticle
interaction for N > 2. Namely, we examine the matrix element
⟨n′
1n′
2 . . . n′
N|V |n1n2 . . . nN⟩. The matrix element vanishes
when the two sets of quantum numbers (n′
1, n′
2, . . . , n′
N) and
(n1, n2, . . . nN) has, at least, three different elements, i.e.,
the number of the common quantum numbers is equal to
N − 3 or less. In other words, non-vanishing matrix element
has the following ⟨n′
1n′
2n3 . . . nN|V |n1n2n3 . . . nN⟩ where
(n3, . . . , nN) are the common quantum numbers.
We examine the ﬁrst part CI of C. We assume that the
system is initially in the ground state |1⊗N(λ)⟩. According
to the selection rule, it is sufﬁcient to examine |1⊗N−2ψ, φ⟩,
where |ψ⟩ and |φ⟩ are single particle adiabatic states, e.g. |2⟩.
Now we examine whether the eigenenergies of these states are
degenerate. This is equivalent to compare the eigenenergies
corresponding to |11⟩ and |ψ, φ⟩ of the two particle system.
As is seen in Figure 3, there is no level crossing in CI. In
this sense, there is no effective level crossing with the level
|1⊗N(λ)⟩, during CI.
As for CIII, we conclude from an argument similar to the
above, that the energy level corresponding to |2⊗N(λ)⟩ has no
effective level crossing.
Next we examine CII, where the system is in |R⊗N
1
⟩.
According to the selection rule, it sufﬁces to examine
|R⊗N−2
1
ψ, φ⟩ with single particle adiabatic states |ψ⟩ and
|φ⟩. To clarify the level crossing, we compare |R1R1⟩ with
|ψ, φ⟩. There are three cases. First, the levels corresponding
to |R1R1⟩ and |Rn, Rn′⟩ ((n, n′) ̸= (1, 1)) do not occur.
Second, the levels corresponding to |R1R1⟩ and |Rn, Ln′⟩
exhibits a degeneracy only when n = 1 and n′
= 1,
where the corresponding matrix element involves a single-
particle tunneling. Third, the levels corresponding to |R1R1⟩
and |Ln, Ln′⟩ exhibits a degeneracy only when n = 1 and
n′ = 1, where the corresponding matrix element involves a
two-particle tunneling. Since the matrix elements involving a
tunneling contribution is exponentially small, the resultant gap
should be also small. Hence, the diabatic process should occur
even when the speed of the impenetrable wall is moderately
slow.
V.
DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY
We argue here that the experimental realization of the
population inversion suggested in this paper is feasible with
the current state of the art. For example, we may utilize the
scheme [22] to realize δ-wall with an approximate Gaussian
wall.
Another possibility is to use a heavy particle as a wall,
whose position may be manipulated by, say, an optical tweezer.
The effective interaction between the wall particle and other
particle may be tuned by external ﬁelds.
We note that the present scheme may offer a way to
realize other exotic nonequilibrium states. Let us suppose, for
example, the state of bosons is in |2⊗N(λ)⟩, which can be
generated from the adiabatic cycle C. After the interparticle
interaction λ is adiabatically increased to ∞, the system arrives
the higher excited state of the Tonks-Girardeau system, which
may be described by the Lieb-Linigher model with the inﬁnite
interparticle interaction strength [23][24]. Similarly, after λ is
adiabatically decreased to −∞, the system now arrives at the
higher excited state of the super-Tonks-Girardeau system [6].
This state is a much more highly-excited state compared to the
super-Tonks-Girardeau state, because the initial state |2⊗N(λ)⟩
is a higher excited state of noninteracting bosons.
In summary, we have shown that the adiabatic cycle C
induces the nearly complete population inversion of the multi-
boson system, when the interparticle interaction is not too
strong. As pointed out in [18] for a single particle case, the
present scheme may be extended to the case of an arbitrary
shape of the conﬁnement potential V (x).
