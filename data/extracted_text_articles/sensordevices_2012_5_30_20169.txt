Abstract—This paper presents a study to identify the type and 
location of yarn periodical errors applying three different 
signal processing approaches based on FFT – Fast Fourier 
Transform, FWHT-Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform and 
FDFI – Fast Impulse Frequency Determination. The errors 
determination is applied for the mass measurement of yarn 
using a capacitive sensor and for the measurement of yarn 
diameter/hairiness based on optical sensors. Commercial 
equipment uses exclusively a FFT approach which is not able 
to clearly detect other types of common periodical yarn errors, 
especially impulse errors, as well as an inferior resolution than 
the 1mm used in this work. The theoretical description of each 
signal processing technique is presented, as well as their 
application to several simulated errors, namely, sinusoidal, 
rectangular, pulse and impulse errors, showing proper results 
and a more complete analysis of periodical errors. 
 
Keywords- capacitive sensors; optical sensors; periodical

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The existence of yarn irregularities occurring with a 
constant frequency is a dominant source of imperfections in 
fabrics. These defects appear as high energy peaks in the 
frequency analysis [1-3] of yarn characteristics. So, with 
spectral analysis, it is possible to detect periodic errors in the 
yarn production process. Hairiness [4-7] (protruding fibers 
released from the main body of the yarn) (Figure 1) and 
irregularities (thin and thick places and neps) [1-3] (Figure 
2a), are the major yarn parameters to be analyzed for the 
occurrence of periodical errors. However, there are two other 
types of errors [3, 8, 9]. The first type (Figure 2b) typically 
occurs due to the accumulated dirt at the stretching rollers in 
the drafting systems, or the displacement of the roller axis, 
producing a sinusoidal imperfection in the spun yarn 
diameter. The second type (Figure 2c) is generally due to 
imperfections in the surface of the rollers, generating a 
periodic impulse fault (imperfections in the raw material are 
seldom periodic).

To detect these yarn errors we have employed three

(Fast Fourier Transform), FWHT (Fast Walsh-Hadamard 
Transform) 
and

(Fast

Frequency 
Determination), instead of a single strategy, based on FFT, as 
is the case for all current commercial solutions [1-3]. As 
most of the yarn periodical errors are sinusoidal they are 
easily detected by the FFT. It is our intention to explore the 
use of the FWHT, as an alternative to the FFT, as it has the 
advantage of requiring a lower computational effort when 
compared to the others The FDFI detects impulse errors, as 
they are not clearly identified by the other techniques. So, as

impulse errors could appear regularly, it was of major 
importance to present a viable solution for their detection.  
This paper contains the following structure: the present 
Section I- identifies the problem and objectives of the paper;

hardware employed for signals capture; Section III- 
describes the signal processing approaches used; Section IV-

II. 
THE MEASUREMENT SOLUTIONS DEVELOPED 
To measure yarn irregularities, a parallel plates capacitive 
sensor was employed to detect yarn mass variations [3, 10, 
11], while a coherent optical signal processing technique 
based on Fourier analysis together with an optical sensor was 
used to measure yarn hairiness [4-7]. The measurement of 
yarn irregularities can also be performed considering the 
yarn diameter variation [12-14]. All employed systems have 
a sample resolution of 1 mm (Figure 3).

Characterization Sensor), DVS - Photodiode (Diameter Variation Sensor), 
HS - Photodiode (Hairiness Sensor), CS - Capacitor (Mass Variation 
Sensor), Src - Laser Source)  
A. Yarn Mass Variation System 
The yarn mass variation system employed uses a 1 mm 
parallel plate capacitive sensor based on the integrated circuit 
MS3110 from Irvine Sensors, allowing direct yarn mass 
measurements over sample lengths of 1 mm. The sensor 
adopts a differential configuration to assure a higher 
robustness to variations in temperature, air humidity and 
pressure. It integrates transducer amplification and signal 
conditioning, as shown in Figure 4 [15]. This sensor has a 
resolution of capacity superior to 4 aF/rtHz, difficult to find 
in other commercial solutions, being compatible with the 
measurements of resolution in the order of aF needed for 
proper yarn mass quantification and variation.

B. Yarn Diameter and Hairiness Quantification  
The yarn diameter and hairiness quantification, based on 
two single photodiodes (S1227-1010BR from Hamamatsu) 
configured for a 1 mm sample length analysis, uses an 
optical setup with a low-pass spatial filter, to perform the 
diameter measurement (eliminating the influence of 
hairiness, Figure 5a), as well as with a high-pass spatial 
filter, to perform the hairiness measurement (eliminating the 
influence of the light which is not blocked by the yarn, 
Figure 5b) [15-18]. Figure 5c presents the optical hardware 
employed to determine yarn diameter and hairiness. A 
coherent optical imaging technique is employed to obtain an 
optical signal proportional to the amount of hairiness present 
on the yarn being sampled.

A diode laser (Eudyna FLD6A2TK) was used as an 
illumination source. This laser emits light at 685 ± 10 nm in 
both a single transverse and single longitudinal mode, with 
an especially low aspect ratio of 1.3. Emitting in a single 
longitudinal mode, the coherence length of the laser light is 
expected to be greater than several metres. The light from 
this laser was collimated using a single plano-convex lens of 
40 mm focal length (L1). After illuminating the sample 
under study (O), the light passes through a 60 mm focal

length, 50 mm diameter plano-convex lens (L2) used to 
obtain the spatial Fourier transform of the object in its 
principal focal plane. A roughly 1 mm diameter opaque 
target (F) placed in the Fourier plane, blocks all spatial 
frequencies below 10 mm-1, corresponding to a characteristic 
size of 100 microns or larger in the object plane. The filter is 
chosen to pass all of the relevant information regarding the 
small fibres, while almost entirely eliminating the nearly 
constant background light due to laser light that is not 
incident on the sample. However, the amount of light 
transmitted by the spatial filter is relatively small, roughly 3 
to 4 orders of magnitude less than the full power emitted by 
the laser. A third plano-convex lens of 60 mm focal length 
(L3) is used to form a final filtered image (position of the 
photo detector in Figure 5c) (I/PD), which then highlights the 
sharp transitions in the object, basically the core boundary of 
the fibre and any small protruding hairs from the yarn core, 
allowing the measurement of hairiness. All lenses are 1 inch 
in diameter, except for the Fourier lens, L2, which is 2 inches 
in diameter. The lenses are carefully aligned to have a 
common optical axis. For the diameter measurements, 
basically the same optical hardware is used, with the 
exception that the high-pass spatial filter is replaced by a 
low-pass spatial filter, corresponding to a roughly 1mm 
diameter circular aperture, i.e., the complement of the high 
pass spatial filter. This filter blocks all spatial frequencies 
above 10 mm-1, resultant to a characteristic size of 100 
microns or less in the object plane. Afterwards, in order to 
obtain a voltage proportional to the brightness of the final 
image, a conditioning circuit was developed for yarn 
hairiness/diameter quantification. A high precision current to 
voltage converter based on a Burr-Brown operational 
amplifier OPA277P [19] was used between the output of the 
photodiode and the sampling board. Considering the 
hairiness and diameter measurement, the presented optical 
configuration overcomes the referred drawbacks of most 
available commercial methods [5, 20, 21]. The system also 
integrates a photodiode array (PDA in Figure 3), S8378-
256Q from Hamamatsu, to allow a precise characterization 
of diameter and hairiness. 
III. 
SIGNAL PROCESSING APPROACHES FOR DETECTION 
OF YARN PERIODICAL ERRORS  
This section describes the signal processing techniques 
employed for detection of yarn periodical errors in diameter 
variation, mass variation and hairiness variation. In order to 
detect these errors, three different approaches are applied, 
namely, the FFT approach for sinusoidal errors, the FWHT 
approach for rectangular errors and the FDFI approach for 
impulse errors. The results obtained are shown in terms of 
wavelengths ((m)), calculated according to (1) [2], as they 
give a more perceptive result to the yarn producer.

where, Lsample is the sample length (mm), fa is the

frequencies (Hz). 
A. FFT Approach 
The first approach is based on the FFT transform [11-13] 
with a narrow bands definition to aggregate the harmonics, 
due to the highly concentrated information of the spectrum. 
This can be considered a periodgram. All the wavelengths 
detected at the corresponding energy band, are added and 
then multiplied by the number of detected wavelengths, 
obtaining the final value of the energy band (2) [1, 10].

where, ke is the number of detected wavelengths in the 
band, w is the index of the detected wavelength and  is the 
wavelength amplitude at the index w. 
B. FWHT Approach 
The Walsh functions create an ordered set of rectangular 
waves presenting only two possible amplitudes, +1 and -1 
[14, 15]. Walsh functions are commonly classified using a 
notation in terms of odd and even symmetries. Two series 
are presented, the CAL series (even) and the SAL series 
(odd), which are very similar to the trigonometric series 
COSIN and SIN, respectively. The Hadamard order is the 
one used in this work, as it is computationally the most 
efficient. The Walsh Hadamard transform is given by (3).

where, X is the array of signal variation (0,…., ns-1) , ns

C. FDFI Approach 
The FFT and FWHT do not achieve good results in 
detecting impulse errors: the FFT cannot detect them and the 
FWHT do not distinguishes them from other errors. So, a 
new approach, Fast Impulse Frequency Determination 
(FDFI) [1, 8-10] was considered. In the impulse error 
presented in Fig. 2, if there are stretching rollers in addition 
to those responsible for the error, the error will be extended, 
causing an impulse error with a longer width. The FDFI 
Transform was developed [1, 8-10] to detect this kind of 
fault, following an approach which consists of the 
multiplication of an error signal by a coefficient matrix. The 
error signal is obtained comparing each sample with a 
predefined threshold. If the sample amplitude is outside the 
threshold, the error signal takes the ‘1’ value, otherwise, it 
takes the value ‘0’. Afterwards, a matrix is generated, where 
all the admissible error periods and phases (initial points) are 
tested (from ns / 2 to (ns / 4) + 1). As the ns / 4 period is 
multiple of the ns / 2 period, it is not necessary to test it.

IV. 
RESULTS OF SIGNAL PROCESSING TECHNIQUES WITH 
SIMULATED ERRORS 
A study on the application of signal processing 
techniques to simulated periodical errors in a hairiness 
variation signal [10] is presented. Periodical errors tested: 
sinusoidal error with amplitude of 20 % (Figure 6a); positive 
periodic rectangular error with amplitude of 40 % (Figure 
6b); a pulse error with amplitude of 100 % (Figure 7a) and a 
periodic impulse error with amplitude of 400 % every 384 
samples (Figure 7b).

A. Original Signal 
In order to test the signal processing approaches it was 
considered a real acquired signal: Figure 8 - original signal, 
is based on the signal of hairiness of a 100% cotton yarn 
measured by the photodiode DS (Figure 3). It considers the 
variation (%) of each sample of 1mm in reference to the 
average of hairiness measured. The results of FFT and 
FWHT of Figures 9-16 present normalized results in the Y-
axis.

approach for this situation, respectively. 
 
 
Figure 9.  FFT result for the original signal with the sinusoidal error 
 
Figure 10.  FWHT result for the original signal with the sinusoidal error 
Analysing Figure 9 (FFT), it is verified that a relevant 
protruding peak is now observed around 3 cm, detecting as 
expected, a clear sinusoidal error at this wavelength. The 
FWHT spectrogram Figure 10 also presents, mainly, two 
new protruding peaks around 3 mm and 6 cm. So, as 
expected, it can be verified that a sinusoidal error is also 
detected by the FWHT, but in several narrow bands. As 
known when an error does not match a tested waveform of 
the applied signal processing technique, it is reflected over 
several 
waveforms 
at 
different 
(usually 
harmonic) 
wavelengths (decomposition).

approach for this situation, respectively.

Figure 11.  FFT result for the original signal with the rectangular error 
 
 
Figure 12.  FWHT result for the original signal with the rectangular error 
 
Figure 11 (FFT) contains a relevant protruding peak at 
around 2 cm and three others peaks, with minor amplitudes 
at wavelengths near 2 mm, 3 mm and 5 mm. As expected, it 
can be verified that a rectangular error is also detected by the 
FFT over several narrow bands in which the main error 
component clearly protrudes over the spectrogram. The 
FWHT spectrogram (Figure 12) also presents several new 
protruding peaks around 3 mm and   5 mm, 3, 5, 7, 10, 25 
cm. However, the more relevant new protruding peaks are at 
wavelengths 3 mm, 5 cm and 25 cm. So, it can be verified 
that a periodic rectangular error is also detected over several 
bands by the FWHT as in the FFT, probably because the 
added rectangular error does not completely match a tested 
FWHT waveform. However, in the FWHT the protruded 
peaks which are also detected in the FFT have higher 
amplitudes, due to its close similarity to the FWHT 
waveforms.    
D. Original Signal with a Single Pulse Error Added 
Analysis 
Figures 13 and 14, present the results of FFT and FWHT 
approach for this situation, respectively. 
 
Figure 13.  FFT result for the original signal with the pulse error 
 
Figure 14.  FWHT result for the original signal with the pulse error 
No new protruding peaks are observed in Figure 13 
(FFT), highlighting that this technique is not at all sensitive 
to pulse errors. This situation was expected because it is a 
non-periodic error. In FWHT (Figure 14) a new protruding 
peak is observed around 5 mm probably because the 
simulated error matched a tested waveform of the FWHT 
technique. It can be concluded that the FWHT could be 
useful to detect pulse errors. 
E. Original Signal with a Periodical Impulse Error Added 
Analysis 
Figures 15 and 16 present the results of FFT and FWHT 
approach for this situation, respectively. As no new 
protruding peaks are observed in Figure 15 (FFT), this 
technique seems to be unhelpful to detect impulse errors. In 
FWHT (Figure 16), several alterations are observed: the 
main protruding peak of the spectrogram around 8 mm as 
well as several other, were severely reduced while a new 
protruding peak is observed around 2.5 mm. Finally, a 
reinforcement of the amplitude of the protruding peak 
around 8 cm occurred. It can be concluded that although the 
FWHT detects this type of error, it is impossible to 
distinguish it, in the spectrogram, from the pulse error. So 
the use of the FDFI is now considered.

As it can be seen in Table I, it is verified that the signal 
error is decomposed in 12 error rows, with initial positions in 
indexes 0, 384, 768, 1152 and 1536, containing periods of 
1152, 1536 and 1920 samples, resulting in a number of 
impulses between 2 and 4. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Different signal processing techniques based on FFT, 
FWHT and FDFI were tested using an experimental 
hairiness 
spectrogram 
for 
error 
detection. 
Artificial 
sinusoidal, rectangular, pulse or periodical impulse errors 
were added to the original signal. The previously described 
analysis allows us to conclude that: periodic sinusoidal errors 
are clearly distinguished using the FFT approach over a 
narrow band and in the FWHT over several bands where the 
main components are visible in the spectrum; periodic 
rectangular error is distinguished in the FFT approach over 
several bands, where the main error component clearly 
extends above the spectrum and in the FWHT, also over 
several bands, if the error does not match the tested 
waveforms of the technique (if a match is verified a clearly 
narrow band will protrude); pulse or periodic impulse errors 
are not detected by the FFT approach but are detected by the 
FWHT over a narrow band, considering the pulse error and 
over several bands considering the periodic impulse error. 
However, it is difficult to distinguish, an impulse error from 
a pulse error. For this it is more suitable to use an FDFI 
analysis; periodic impulse errors are clearly detected by the 
FDFI approach. 
The performance allowed by the FWHT in comparison to 
the FFT, is supported by the computational effort reduction 
associated to the less complex calculation of rectangular 
square waves in comparison to sinusoidal waves. 
For a complete analysis of given yarn with unknown 
error, we recommend the use of all three signal processing 
techniques as they are in many sense complementary. 
Future work will include the development of new 
optimized FDFI algorithms in order to reduce the associated 
computational effort as well as studies that allow the use of 
the FWHT in replacement of the FFT.
