Abstract—Magnetic Random Access Memory (MRAM) is an 
emerging 
memory 
technology. 
Among 
existing 
MRAM 
technologies, Thermally Assisted Switching (TAS) MRAM 
technology offers several advantages such as selectivity, single 
magnetic field and high integration density. In this paper, we 
analyze the impact of capacitive defects on the TAS-MRAM 
performance. Electrical simulations were performed on a 16-
words TAS-MRAM architecture enabling any sequences of 
read/write operations. Results show that writing operations may 
be affected by these defects. Especially, we demonstrate that 
some capacitive defects may have a local (single cell) impact on 
the functionality of TAS-MRAM while others, even if there is an 
effective coupling, do not change the functional operation. These 
results will be further used to develop effective test algorithms 
targeting faults related to actual defects that may affect TAS-
MRAM architecture.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Nowadays, Non-Volatile Memories (NVMs) are more and 
more integrated in consumer applications. Though widely used, 
Flash memories still have several drawbacks such as high 
supply voltage requirement, low speed and susceptibility to 
reliability issues due to high electric field for programming 
operations. On the other hand, Magnetic Random Access 
Memory (MRAM) is an emerging technology with high data 
processing speed, low power consumption and high integration 
density compared with Flash memories. Moreover, this 
memory technology is non-volatile with fair processing speed 
and reasonable power consumption when compared to Static 
RAMs (SRAMs).  MRAM probably is the closest to an ideal 
“universal memory” and thus may be used as NVM as well as 
SRAM and DRAM according to the 2011 International 
Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) [1]. 
MRAMs have the potential to mitigate almost all Flash 
related issues but they are prone to defects as any other kind of 
memory. Only few papers on MRAM testing can be found in 
the literature, and target mainly Field Induced Magnetic 
Switching (FIMS) MRAM technologies. Su et al. [2] present 
the Write Disturbance Fault (WDF) model, a fault that affects 
data stored in Toggle MRAM cells due to the amount of 
magnetic field applied during write operations on neighboring 
cells. Su et al. [3] identified two new faults related to the 
magnetic junction behavior and called Multi-Victim Fault 
(MVF), in which a cluster of cells can easily change their 
magnetization state due to process variations, and Kink Fault 
(KF), in which the hysteresis loop shrinks because of its 
relation with cell shape, thus changing MTJ resistivity. 
A thorough investigation and deep analysis must be done 
for testing MRAMs memories. In [4] and [5], resistive-open 
and resistive-bridge defect analyses are presented for TAS-
MRAM architectures. These studies have revealed the 
importance of electrical analyses of defects that may impact the 
performance of TAS-MRAMs. 
In this paper, we complete these studies by considering 
parasitic coupling, i.e., capacitive defects. Parasitic coupling 
between adjacent interconnect lines is a major limiting factor in 
deep-submicron ICs due to the injection of noise from 
switching lines to neighboring lines [6]. The trend of increasing 
the integration level of ICs has a negative impact on 
interconnect performance. The cross section is smaller in the 
scaling-down process increasing the line’s resistance. In order 
to reduce resistance while maintaining high horizontal 
interconnect density, the aspect ratio is larger than “1” 
increasing the coupling capacitance. In addition, the effective 
capacitance increases as the spacing between lines decreases, 
which causes an increase in the delay related to the RC 
constant. Moreover, crosstalk between lines due to mutual 
capacitance and inductance becomes worse. 
In this context, we fully characterize the impact of 
capacitive 
defects 
on 
the 
TAS-MRAM 
performance. 
Considered defects were selected based on the layout structure 
of the TAS-MRAM array. Simulations were performed in a 
TAS-MRAM architecture supporting any read/write sequences. 
Results show that capacitive defects have almost no impact on 
read operations. Conversely, write operations are affected by 
capacitive defects depending on the size and location. Such 
results will be helpful to define an efficient test algorithm to 
fully test TAS-MRAMs. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II 
provides the fundamentals and background on MRAM 
technologies. The proposed TAS-MRAM architecture is 
described in Section III. The capacitive defect analysis is 
provided in Section IV. Section V concludes the paper. 
II. 
MRAM TECHNOLOGIES 
MRAMs are Spintronic devices that store data in Magnetic 
Tunnel Junctions (MTJs). A basic MTJ device is usually 
composed of two FerroMagnetic (FM) layers separated by an 
insulating layer, as shown in Figure 1. One of the FM layers is 
pinned and acts as a reference layer. The other one is free and 
can be switched between, at least, two stable states. These 
39

states are parallel or anti-parallel with respect to the reference 
layer. When the MTJ is in the parallel state, it offers the 
minimum resistance (Rmin) while the maximum resistance 
(Rmax) is obtained when anti-parallel. The difference between 
Rmin and Rmax, quantified by the Tunnel Magneto Resistance 
(TMR), is high enough to be sensed during the read operation. 
 
Figure 1.  MTJ in parallel and antiparallel states 
A read operation consists in determining the MTJ’s 
magnetization state and can be performed by voltage or current 
sensing across the MTJ stack. A CMOS sense amplifier is used 
to retrieve the stored bit information. High TMR allows simple 
and stable sense amplifiers, improving reading accuracy [7]. 
Magnetization dynamics describes how the magnetization 
goes from one point of equilibrium to another one. This 
evolution of the magnetization in terms of time and space 
under a local effective field can be described by the Landau-
Lifshitz-Gilbert equation (1): 
 
𝜕𝑚
𝜕𝑡 = −
𝛾
1 + 𝛼! 𝑚×𝐻!"" −
𝛾𝛼
1 + 𝛼! 𝑚× 𝑚×𝐻!""  
(1) 
 
where 𝑚 is the unit vector along the magnetization of the free 
layer, 𝛾 is the gyromagnetic ratio, 𝛼 is the Gilbert damping 
constant and 𝐻!"" is the effective magnetic field. 
A write operation can be performed using magnetic fields 
or spin polarized current and depends on MRAM technologies: 
FIMS (Field Induced Magnetic Switching), Toggle Switching, 
TAS (Thermally Assisted Switching) and CIMS (Current 
Induced Magnetic Switching). 
Thermally Assisted SwitchingTM is an alternative 
switching method for MRAMs. In the scheme proposed by 
Spintec [8] and industrialized by Crocus Technology, the MTJ 
is modified by inserting an Anti-FerroMagnetic (AFM) layer 
that pins the storage layer while below its blocking temperature 
(𝑇!) that can be calculated by (2). 
 
𝑇! =
𝐾𝑉
𝑘! ln 𝜏!𝑒
!"
!!!
 
(2) 
 
where 𝐾 is the effective anisotropy constant, 𝑉 is the device 
volume, 𝑘! is the Boltzmann constant and 𝜏! is the attempt 
time. 
In AFM materials, the magnetic moments of atoms are 
aligned in a regular pattern, neighboring spins pointing in 
opposite directions. This organization vanishes above 𝑇! and 
the material becomes paramagnetic. When MTJ’s temperature 
rises above 𝑇!, the storage layer is freed and can be reversed 
under the application of a small magnetic field provided by a 
single field-line. The magnetic field is maintained beyond the 
heating voltage pulse to ensure the correct pinning of the 
storage layer. 
TAS approach offers several advantages compared to 
predecessors MRAM technologies. The selectivity problem is 
reduced since only heated MTJs are able to switch and all other 
MTJs hold their stable state as they remain below their 
blocking temperature. Although TAS-MRAM needs an 
additional heating current, this current is much smaller than the 
current used to generate the second magnetic field in FIMS-
MRAM technology. The integration density is improved due to 
thermal stability and the need of only one field-line. Finally, as 
the free layer can be pinned to any stable state, multi level logic 
can be achieved [9]. TAS-MRAM is for the moment the most 
promising MRAM solution as it mitigates most drawbacks 
from its predecessors. 
III. 
TAS-MRAM ARCHITECTURE 
Figure 2 shows the TAS-MRAM architecture we have 
developed for our study. The organization is done in a square 
matrix that has 2MR rows and 2NC columns, for a total storage 
capacity of 2MR+NC bits per page, where MR and NC are the 
numbers of bits used to specify the row and column address, 
respectively. In our case study, MR and NC are equal to 2 and 
the number of pages is 4; hence, the storage capacity is 64 bits 
(16 words of 4 bits). Each cell in the array is connected to one 
of the row-lines, called word-lines, and connected to one of the 
column-lines, called bit-lines. A particular set of MTJs can be 
accessed for a read or write operation by selecting its word-line 
and bit-line. There is only one field-line that connects all MTJs 
serially row by row passing through all pages in this 
architecture. 
During a read operation, the read driver applies a small 
voltage that generates negligible heat to both the selected MTJ 
and a reference MTJ. The reference MTJ is halfway between 
the high and low resistance values. The resistance difference is 
then sensed to determine the stored data in the selected MTJ. 
A write operation is performed as follows: 
• Initially, the write driver applies a voltage to heat the 
selected MTJ above its 𝑇! (about 150 °C). 
• Next, the field-line driver applies a current to generate 
the data zero magnetic field. While the MTJ is cooled 
down below 𝑇!, the magnetic field is maintained. 
• Then, the field-line driver inverses the current 
direction and the MTJ is heated again to perform the 
write 1 operation, if needed. When the MTJ reaches 
room 
temperature, 
the 
writing 
procedure 
is 
accomplished. 
This approach allows writing “logic 0” and “logic 1” in one 
cycle to different MTJs sharing the same field-line. Note that, a 
Write 1 operation (denoted W1) consists of applying both 
field-line current polarities (magnetic field for “data 0” and 
then magnetic field for “data 1”), while a Write 0 operation 
(denoted W0) consists of applying only one field-line current 
polarity (magnetic field for “data 0” only). These writing 
procedures are inspired by Flash programming procedures

where a write operation (write 1) is always preceded by an 
erase operation (write 0). 
 
Figure 2.  TAS-MRAM architecture 
Electrical simulations were performed using the TAS-MTJ 
model developed by Spintec [9]. This model is based on the 
physical equations of the MTJ and is calibrated with respect to 
the targeted TAS-MRAM technology. Moreover, this model is 
compiled in C language and is compatible with the Spectre 
simulator of the standard Cadence design suite [10]. 
Table I summarizes simulated fault-free characteristics of 
MTJ1,1,1 (MTJi,j,k with i ⇒ page number, j ⇒ row number and  
k ⇒ column number) in the second page, second column and 
second line of the TAS-MRAM architecture shown in Figure 2. 
The first column gives the four possible operations R0, R1, W0 
and W1. The next five columns provide all the MTJ’s 
parameters: 
• V – Voltage level at the MTJ interface. 
• I – Current passing through the MTJ during read or 
write operations. 
• R – Resistance of the MTJ. 
• T – Temperature of the MTJ during operations. 
• M – Magnetization state that is related to the angle 
between the two ferromagnetic layers. The parallel 
magnetization 
state 
is 
represented 
ideally 
by               
“1 ⇒ logic 0” and the anti-parallel magnetization state 
by “-1 ⇒ logic 1”. The magnetization state is 
correlated to the resistivity of the MTJ. 
Finally, the last column gives the sensing voltage (S) during 
read operation only. The two resistive states of the MTJ are 
1.48kΩ for Rmin and 2.80kΩ for Rmax during read operation. 
In normal operation the sensing voltage (S) is around 165mV 
for Rmin and 254mV for Rmax. During write operations, the 
current that passes through the MTJ is high enough to heat its 
temperature above the blocking temperature, i.e., 193°C for 
W0 and 193/183°C for W1. The MTJ’s resistivity is different 
during read and write operations even if the magnetization state 
is the same. This is due to the voltage applied to the MTJ as 
well as its operating temperature.

Figures 3 and 4 show temperature profiles for W0 and W1 
operations performed on a 16-bit fault-free TAS-MRAM 
memory page, respectively. Note that, MTJs are written row by 
row from MTJx,0,0 to MTJx,3,3. We observe that temperature 
rises twice during each write cycle in W1 operations and rises 
only once per cycle in W0 operations. This behavior is 
expected according to the writing scheme previously described.

CAPACITIVE DEFECT INJECTION 
The capacitive defect injection in TAS-MRAM architecture 
is depicted in Figure 5. Capacitive defects are inserted between 
interconnect lines based on the TAS-MRAM array layout as 
follows: 
• 
C1: MTJ’s bottom metal – Field-line 
• 
C2: Field-line – Word-line 
• 
C3: Word-line – Word-line 
• 
C4: Word-line – MTJ’s bottom metal 
Note that all resistive parameters are not represented in 
Figure 5 but are all taken into account in models (lines, 
transistors, drivers) used for electrical simulations. 
TAS-MRAM performance is affected by these capacitive 
defects in several ways. In the following sub-sections, we show 
a complete analysis of how these four capacitive defects impact 
the TAS-MRAM performance. Simulations were performed 
using the following write sequences:

For each capacitive defect, the capacitance range varies 
from the typical value to 10x the typical value. Larger 
capacitance sizes are unrealistic from process variations point 
of view. In those cases, other defect types, such as bridging 
defects, may appear. 
A. MTJ bottom – Field-line (C1) 
The current that passes through the MTJ is responsible for 
heating the device above its blocking temperature during write 
operations. This current is also important to retrieve the MTJ’s 
logic state during read operations. 
Tables II and III summarize the simulated characteristics of 
MTJ1,1,1 and MTJ1,1,x in the presence of a capacitive defect 
located between bottom metal of MTJ1,1,1 and field-line labeled 
as C1. Gray lines represent typical C1 capacitance size. From 
these data, we observe that only MTJs sharing the same bit-line 
are barely affected by this defect when the defect size is up to 
1fF. Consequently, there is no observed faulty behaviors for 
the considered defect range, i.e., from typical value to 10x the 
typical value.

Figure 7.  16 bits W1 under capacitive defect (C2=10fF) temperature profile 
The selection of word-line “1” is delayed in the presence of 
C2 as can be seen in the operation performed on MTJx,1,0.  Next 
three operations performed on MTJx,1,1, MTJx,1,2 and MTJx,1,3 
that share same word-line work properly as word-line “1” is 
fully selected. The operation performed on MTJx,2,0 has an 
undesired behavior as C2 delays the word-line “1” de-
selection. Regardless defective word-line selection or de-
selection only 1W0 sequence is not correctly performed. Such 
faulty behavior is modeled by a TF0 (Transition Fault 1 to 0). 
C. Word-line – Word-line (C3) 
Tables VI and VII summarize the simulated characteristics 
of MTJx,1,0 and MTJx,2,0, respectively, in presence of a 
capacitive defect located between word-line “1” and word-line 
“2” labeled as C3. Simulations were performed using write 
sequences previously described.

In Figure 8, we show temperature profiles for W1 
operations performed in one memory page under C3=10fF. 
This defect adds an extra delay when selecting/deselecting both 
defective word-lines. 
 
Figure 8.  16 bits W1 under capacitive defect (C3=10fF) temperature profile 
As observed for C2, the selection of word-line “1” is 
delayed in the presence of C3 (operation performed on 
MTJx,1,0).  Next three operations performed on MTJx,1,1, 
MTJx,1,2 and MTJx,1,3 that share same word-line work properly 
as their word-line is fully selected. The operation performed on 
MTJx,2,0 has an undesired behavior as C3 delays both word-line 
“1” de-selection and word-line “2” selection. Next three 
operations performed on MTJx,2,1, MTJx,2,2 and MTJx,2,3 work 
properly. The operation performed on MTJx,3,0 has an undesired 
behavior as C3 delays the word-line “2” de-selection. In 
addition to 1W0 operations, 0W1 operations are not correctly 
performed in presence of C3. Such faulty behavior is modeled 
by both TF0 and TF1 (Transition Fault 0 to 1).

These electrical simulations show that C4 defect does not 
impact the functional operations of the TAS-MRAM. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we have analyzed the impact of capacitive 
defect on the TAS-MRAM performance. Capacitive defect 
locations were extracted from the layout of the TAS-MRAM 
array and are simulated on a 16-words architecture enabling 
any sequences of read/write operations. Results have shown 
that writing operations may be affected by these coupling 
defects. Especially, we have demonstrated that some capacitive 
defects behave as transition faults while others, even if there is 
an effective coupling, do not change the functional operation of 
the TAS-MRAM. As future work, we plan to use these 
analyses results to guide the test phase by providing effective 
test algorithms targeting fault related to actual defects that may 
affect TAS-MRAM architectures.
