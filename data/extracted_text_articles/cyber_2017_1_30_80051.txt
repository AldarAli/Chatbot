Abstract— Air pollution is becoming a serious global health 
issue. We propose a risk communication method called 3D 
(detection, data sharing and discussion) to ensure risk 
awareness for environmental hazards for individual citizens. 
This paper presents a prototype system of a sensor connected 
to smartphone which detects PM2.5 (Particle Matter with 
aerodynamic diameters ≤  2.5 um). Preliminary field tests 
showed that PM2.5 concentration levels differed in the regions 
we tested in the East-Asian countries. As a next step, we plan to 
a conduct risk communication experiment through social 
media discussion involving local residents, experts and public 
sector, to ensure risk awareness and education of individuals.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
WHO (World Health Organization) estimated that 6.5 
million people are dying annually from air pollution [1]. 
Nearly 90% of the deaths occur in low- and middle-income 
countries in the South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions, 
as shown in Figure 1. Also, in 28 countries in Europe, 
around 400 thousand premature deaths still occur each year 
due to long-term exposure to PM2.5 [3]. The transboundary 
health impacts of PM2.5 pollution associated with global 
trade are greater than those associated with long-distance 
atmospheric pollutant transport [4].

Simultaneously, coal use is expanding rapidly, especially in 
Asia, for cheaper power generation. Koplitz et al. estimated 
that 15 thousand deaths will occur annually if all of the 
projected plants become operational in Indonesia by 2030 [5]. 
 
II. 
APPROACH 
Town-scale pollution mapping is vital for risk awareness 
in individuals from the local community, since PM2.5 
concentration levels differ, even in small areas, depending on 
the terrain, building structures or vegetation. Further, 
scientific communication is essential to educate citizens to 
take appropriate risk avoiding actions, involving public 
sectors and experts such as meteorologists, environmentalists 
or medical doctors. To ensure such citizen-centered and 
autonomous risk communication, we propose the ‘3D’ 
method as shown in Figure 2 (left). 
• 
Detection of environmental pollution by smartphone 
connected sensors for citizens under open source 
technology, which is mobile and cost-effective. 
• 
Data sharing for swift risk awareness using IoT 
(Internet of Things) and free cloud system to show 
clear evidence based on Web-based visualization.  
• 
Discussion on healthcare risk, hazard protection or 
reduction plan including citizens, public sector and 
experts through democratic social media.

We developed  ‘Pocket PM2.5 Sensor’ as shown in Figure 
2 (right) to demonstrate the 3D in real situation. A free App 
is capable to generate log data in CSV (Comma-Separated 
Values) or Google KML (Keyhole Markup Language) 
format, including GPS (Global Positioning System) 
information. The sensor has a laser LED (Light Emitting 
Diode), a PD (photodiode) sensor, a fan, amplifier and USB 
(Universal Serial Bus) encoder, as shown in Figure 3.

PRELIMINARY RESULTS FROM FIELD EXPERIMENTS 
A. Mobile Sensing 
Figure 4 shows pollution mapping results in Japan, China 
and Korea using a prototype of Pocket PM2.5 Sensor. In 
Tokyo, Japan, the Pocket PM2.5 Sensor showed a reading of 
22.5-25 ug/m3 in an area close to a public pollution 
measurement instrument installed by the local government, 
which reported 21 ug/m3. The two readings are considered as 
almost same. We found a high concentration level (60- 
83 ug/m3) in smoking and grill restaurants zones, which we 
call ‘hotspots’. In Weihai, China, the PM2.5 concentration 
was around 28-36 ug/m3 at the seaside and, in contrast, it was 
44-57 ug/m3 in downtown. Also, we found a hotspot  
(94 ug/m3) close to an exhaust connected to underground 
restaurants. In Seoul, Korea, PM2.5 concentration was 47- 
47 ug/m3 in downtown, and 30-35 ug/m3 in a garden area. 
The difference seems to be related to vegetation. 
B. Fixed Monitoring 
We conducted 24/7 continuous monitoring using the 
Pocket PM2.5 sensors combined with solar cells and 3G/4G 
network. The monitors have been installed in the vicinity of 
public pollution measurement instruments, as shown in 
Figure 5, in cooperation with the local government. The 
comparative experiments will provide accuracy and 
reliability assurance continuously.

CONCLUSION 
Pocket PM2.5 Sensor has a great potential for mobile 
citizen sensing and visualization. Its accuracy seems 
sufficient, but more assurance is needed by performing 
regular cross-checking with public monitoring instruments. 
We plan to conduct a data sharing and risk communication 
experiment through social media discussion involving local 
residents, experts and public sector, to ensure monitoring, 
risk awareness and education of individuals based on the 3D 
method.
