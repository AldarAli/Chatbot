Abstract—Embedded peripheral devices such as memories, 
sensors and communications interfaces are used to perform a 
function external to a host microcontroller. The device 
manufacturer 
typically 
specifies 
worst-case 
current 
consumption and latency estimates for each of these peripheral 
actions. Peripheral Activity Completion, Estimation and 
Recognition (PACER) is introduced as a suite of algorithms that 
can be applied to detect completed peripheral operations in real-
time. By detecting activity completion, PACER enables the host 
to exploit slack between the worst-case estimate and the actual 
response time. These methods were tested independently and in 
conjunction with Intra-Operation Dynamic Voltage Scaling 
(IODVS) on multiple common peripheral devices. For the 
peripheral devices under test, the test fixture confirmed 
decreases in energy expenditures of up to 80% and latency 
reductions of up to 67%.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Embedded systems are often constrained by timing and 
energy budgets because both factors affect the resultant cost 
and size of the system. Peripheral devices external to the 
microcontroller (MCU) such as those shown in Figure 1 can 
play a significant role in system-wide energy consumption. 
PACER [1] decreases dynamic power consumption and 
latency by exploiting slack between actual versus worst-case 
operation time. This contrasts with other methods that focus 
on decreasing static power usage of peripherals [2] [3] [4]. 
Device manufacturers derive and specify the worst-case 
operation duration by summing exacerbating factors including 
age, temperature and voltage. Using the worst-case operation 
time as a naïve guideline, the worst-case energy consumption 
of a given operation is characterized by (1).

power comprising the period between operation completion 
and the worst-case execution time. 
Most peripheral devices provide a mechanism for 
signaling that operations completed earlier than the 
maximum. However, using these mechanisms results in sub-
optimal power performance. For example, a common method 
of detecting write completion on external non-volatile 
memory relies on polling a status register. Performing this 
signaled method has power and energy consequences:

The components of 𝑃௢௩௘௥௛௘௔ௗ are highly variable between 
microcontrollers, systems and devices. The signal may 
involve protocol-level communication or it may be as simple 
as an interrupt pin and that signal may traverse PCB traces 
with considerable capacitance. 𝐸௢௣ି௦௜௚ can exceed 𝐸௢௣ି௪௖. 
Both interface methods incur a power penalty and the 
naïve worst-case method also incurs a latency penalty. As the 
energy cost of computation continues to decrease in modern 
microcontrollers, it becomes more rewarding to use onboard 
intelligence to minimize the impact of power and latency 
penalties. PACER develops adaptive timing, current usage 
and charge consumption heuristics for estimating or 
recognizing early completion of peripheral operations, thus 
reducing total latency and energy consumption. 
The prediction is verified in real-time against the actual 
state and the heuristic is updated with the results. In this 
fashion, the algorithms are resistant to variations in behavior 
that may occur across the lifecycle of the device. PACER is 
evaluated against a variety of embedded peripherals and is 
shown to significantly decrease both energy consumption and 
latency of peripherals with minimal computational overhead.

Figure 2 shows the current profile for the common 
peripheral operation of writing a page to EEPROM. The 
manufacturer-specified mandatory wait period is 5ms, 
beginning about the 1.75ms mark. As the device transitions 
through the Idle  Write  Wait  Verify states, it can be 
inferred from the current profile that the operation completed 
by the 4.75ms mark and that it was not necessary to delay until 
approximately 6.5ms per the specification. This 1.75ms 
differential is slack that can be exploited to decrease latency. 
There are a wide variety of peripheral devices with a 
correspondingly wide variety of completion determinism and 
current profiles. PACER introduces three methods by which 
the host MCU can estimate or detect early completion of 
peripheral operations while also minimizing computational 
overhead. Devices with highly deterministic timing respond 
best to the timing heuristic while those with variable timing 
respond best to current or charge heuristics. Through low-
overhead early completion detection, PACER is able to 
decrease both latency and system-wide energy consumption.

RELATED WORK 
Intra-Operation Dynamic Voltage Scaling [5] (IODVS) 
has been shown to significantly reduce the energy 
consumption of embedded peripherals (Flash, EEPROM, 
sensors, etc.) during their voltage-independent states. These 
states typically occur during mandatory delay periods while 
the peripheral completes a specified operation. When 
implementing IODVS, the host MCU and peripheral devices 
are placed on different voltage domains throughout the course 
of the voltage-independent state. Because of this, it is not 
possible for the MCU to poll the peripheral device for 
operation completion. Polling is also shown to be a rather 
costly operation due to (2) and (3). Without the ability to 
communicate to the peripheral device, PACER is necessary to 
achieve minimal operation latencies. 
A. Timing Heuristic 
Peripheral operations can vary in their latency or 
completion times due to a number of factors. Temperature can 
significantly affect the completion time for peripherals with 
deterministic timing requirements such as DRAM [6]. Device 
aging can also affect timing due to a number of issues 
resulting from fundamental semiconductor physics [7]. 
Furthermore, some devices simply have non-deterministic 
completion times due to features such as MMUs and caches 
that are implemented in various data storage devices like 
Micro-SD cards, or age and wear as they effect FLASH 
storage timing. 
Because the latency can vary significantly between 
operations, it is necessary to develop a timing heuristic that 
can adapt to slowly changing effects like age and temperature 
as well as rapidly changing factors like cache hits and misses. 
Adaptive delay estimation is not a new problem [8] and 
research continues to compensate for non-deterministic delay 
with different approaches for wireless communications, 
control systems and mass storage latency [9]. 
B. Energy Heuristic 
For devices with highly variable timing and dynamic 
current consumption characteristics, integrating the current 
consumption of the device throughout an operation can allow 
for better detection of completion. Some operations can be 
characterized by the amount of charge necessary to complete 
them. This technique is referred to as “coulomb counting” and 
is a common technique used to determine the state of charge 
in rechargeable batteries [10]. 
C. Current Heuristic 
The completion of some peripheral operations are easily 
detectable by their current consumption profile. These devices 
have a distinct and deterministic current profile that can be 
characterized and used to estimate the moment when an 
operation completes.

Simple and differential power analysis (SPA and DPA) 
attacks are performed by monitoring device current 
consumption with very fine grained detail. These attacks seek 
to undermine encryption techniques by monitoring the current 
consumption of the processor and detecting the moment at 
which the processor executes a branch operation [11]. The 
attacks have been performed on an ARM Cortex MCU using 
AES and required an extensive measurement setup to 
accomplish [12]. PACER is inspired by this previous work 
using fine-grained in-circuit current measurement and 
fortunately benefits from much more lenient sampling 
requirements. 
III. 
METHODS 
A. Timing Heuristic PACER-T 
Some peripheral operations exhibit highly deterministic 
timing qualities. Such a device is likely to be internally 
clocked and the operation is waiting for some number of clock 
cycles to expire before signaling that the operation completed. 
Such operations are typified Figure 3 in that neither the total 
energy consumed, nor the profile of that consumption are 
necessary to predict completion. Regardless of the power 
profile, the operation always completes within a deterministic 
window of time. Erases and write operations to EEPROM and 
flash are typical examples of this behavior. 
PACER-T uses the successive approximation algorithm 
shown in (4) to determine the optimal delay for an operation. 
The algorithm begins by executing an operation with the 
amount of delay specified in the device datasheet. After each 
iteration, if the operation completed earlier than predicted 
(Pass), then the amount of delay is halved. Otherwise, the 
operation was ongoing (Fail) and the next delay is increased 
by half the distance to the last previously successful operation.

Figure 3: Profile of Three Time-Deterministic Operations 
The algorithm is executed online and provides the tightest 
possible timing. Upon expiration of the predicted wait period, 
if the device status register indicates that the operation is still 
occurring, then the algorithm has yielded an early prediction 
and it is appropriate to continue to wait. This would be 
considered the ‘Fail’ case of (4) and future estimates are 
increased. Otherwise, if the device status register indicates 
that the operation is complete, then the algorithm has yielded 
a late prediction and it is appropriate to reduce future 
estimates. 
B. Energy Heuristic PACER-E 
Operations that consume a deterministic amount of energy 
are better characterized by PACER-E. For example, the 
operation might involve the charging of a storage element 
such as an inductor or capacitor. In any case, a certain amount 
of energy is required to complete the operation and once that 
energy requirement has been satisfied, the peripheral device 
considers the operation to be complete. Figure 4 is an example 
of an energy bound operation. 
The energy based heuristic was performed similarly to 
PACER-T in that successive approximation is used. The 
system multiply-accumulates voltage and current samples fed 
to the peripheral device. When the digital integration has 
reached the test value, the operation is ‘complete’ and checked 
for correctness. The mechanics of (4) are applied to PACER-
E, except that all T limits are replaced with E energy limits. 
PACER-E is slightly less precise than the timing based 
algorithm due to the time required to both sample and perform 
the digital integration necessary for threshold checking. 
The energy consumed throughout a test is calculated using 
the fundamental relationship shown in (5). The results were 
calculated offline via (6) and (7), where S is the state of the 
device, and Ts is the sampling period.

C. Current Heuristic PACER-C 
Some operations cannot reliably be defined in terms of 
time nor energy. One example of a non-deterministic 
operation would be communications tasks performed by 
Ethernet or wireless devices that have non-deterministic 
transmission latencies. Another example would be memory 
devices that incorporate an onboard memory hierarchy. In 
such devices, operations are affected by cache latencies. 
PACER-C provides recognition that the operation is 
complete by measuring the idle current usage of the device 
before the operation begins and marking the operation as 
complete after the current returns to idle. In order to 
accommodate operations where the current returns to idle and 
yet the operation has not yet completed, the algorithm 
incorporates both a minimum latency and an idle current 
percent threshold to mark the operation as complete. 
Algorithm 1: PACER-C 
1: ICT = (Idle Current Measurement) * threshold 
2: Execute Peripheral Device Operation 
2: While (t < Minimum Latency) and (I > ICT) then 
3:  
I = New Current Measurement 
4: End While 
PACER-C is described by Algorithm 1 and begins by 
taking a sample of the device input current while idle. Next, 
the operation is executed and the algorithm waits for a 
minimum latency period to expire. The operation is 
considered complete after the output current returns to the 
threshold percentage of its previous state. The threshold for all 
following experiments was set empirically at 110%. 
PACER-C is the most basic method to determine in real 
time if an operation is complete and may also be prone to false 
positives in some cases. There are many more advanced 
algorithms that can suit the purpose such as a multi-layer 
perceptron that is used in neural networks that could be used 
to identify features in real-time. It is notable however, that 
reducing the complexity of the detector is important so that 
the algorithm can ensure that it is keeping pace with incoming 
samples. Naturally, more complex algorithms could be 
accommodated by a more powerful host microcontroller. 
IV. 
MATERIALS 
PACER and IODVS are implemented on an STM32F429 
MCU supported by the STMicroelectronics DISCO board and 
hosted by the PRIME (Precise Real-Time In-Circuit Micro-
EMS) assembly. The board provides 64MB of SDRAM which 
allows for simultaneous sampling throughout the test suite at 
very high speed. All experiments were sampled at 1MSPS and 
the SDRAM allowed any individual experiment to last up to 
1 full second. All of the analog conversions as well as the 
device state sampling were performed via DMA. Therefore, 
the test fixture is expected to have had no impact on the 
operation under test. 
The PRIME assembly, shown in Figure 6, hosts a variety 
of peripherals (labelled in red as DUT: Devices Under Test) 
that are common in embedded designs. The board provides 
access to Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and a Si1143 proximity detector. 
PACER was evaluated on NAND and NOR FLASH 
memories, as well as a commercial EEPROM, temperature / 
humidity sensor and four independent Micro-SD cards. 
At 1 MSPS and 4 channel measurements and 2 bytes per 
sample, each test can result in up to 8 megabytes of data. 
Because repeatability is so important, each test was run 50 
times. Therefore, bandwidth became a limiting factor and a 
Hi-Speed (480Mbps) USB module was added to the board to 
allow for rapid development. Operating as a virtual 
communications port and using MCU parallel bus, actual 
bandwidth was realized at approximately 120Mbps. 
Each of the peripheral devices under test has some method 
of determining if an operation completed successfully. For the 
memory devices, a simple read-back verification is sufficient 
to determine correctness and is a common practice among 
embedded designs. The temperature and humidity sensor 
provides a status bit indicating if an operation is in progress, 
thus indicating that a requested operation has not yet 
completed. 
Power is provided and voltage is modulated to each 
individual device on the domain using independently 
configurable power supplies. The ASDM-300F module 
shown in orange on Figure 6 provides a high-efficiency buck 
power supply, followed by a linear regulator with a high 
ripple-rejection ratio. A high-precision and clean power

supply is important because PACER uses the current profile 
to make real-time decisions. If the power supply outputs a 
significant amount of noise, then it becomes difficult to 
acquire signal and determine activity completion in real-time. 
The ASDM-300F is also outfitted with a dual current 
measurement circuit using the Maxim MAX4377HAUA+. 
This circuit allows the host to measure both the input and 
output current of the power supply with high analog 
bandwidth. Figure 7 shows peripheral current output (PIOx) 
and peripheral current input (PIIx) along with peripheral 
voltage (PVx) routed to their associated ADCs on the MCU. 
Note that all signals are buffered to provide high-driving 
capability and therefore a fast response time. 
Ultimately, these measurements are used to determine 
activity completion with the PACER-E and PACER-C 
algorithms. It is important to note the gain-bandwidth product 
of the amplifier. High frequency content will be attenuated to 
some degree and the actionable data output would be of higher 
quality if a higher frequency device were available. 
 
 
Figure 7: Voltage and Current Measurements from ASDM-300F 
While measuring and classifying activity completion, it is 
important that each device be analyzed independently. The 
PPS-330D shown in yellow on Figure 6 allows the host to 
switch the voltage domain of an individual peripheral to any 
one of three domains, or disconnect the device entirely  
PPS-330D devices are connected to each peripheral, and 
while a peripheral is under test, the remaining devices are 
switched to an alternate voltage domain. Thus, each device is 
independently classified in-system without physically 
removing other devices that may affect current measurements. 
Once the devices are characterized, then their individual 
contributions to the power supply current output can be 
deduced through superposition. The PPS-330D is convenient 
for initial profiling, but unnecessary for a streamlined 
implementation. The ASDM-300F is necessary for an IODVS 
implementation, but PACER-E and PACER-C only require 
the current measurement component. 
V. 
RESULTS 
Initial IODVS results were repeated so as to establish a 
baseline with which to compare the results of PACER. 
Previous experiments required the results to be averaged 
many times over. The PRIME assembly provides high enough 
signal to noise ratio that averaging multiple test results is 
unnecessary and a simple 50-sample moving average provides 
enough filtering while maintaining a quick response time. 
 
 
A. MCP25AA512 EEPROM 
The Microchip EEPROM is specified by the manufacturer 
for a 5ms mandatory wait period following the write 
command and data. The full state transition diagram is shown 
in Figure 8. Upon receiving a write command and associated 
data, the delay begins and the operation completes after a 
verification stage. This operation is highly deterministic with 
respect to time, energy and current profile.

The current waveform of Figure 9 shows that the 
EEPROM write operation begins at t=1.5ms and indicates 
completion at approximately t=5ms instead of t=6.5ms as 
specified by the manufacturer. After applying the PACER-T 
algorithm, it is indeed true that the operation was complete at 
the 5ms mark, thus reducing the wait latency by 30.5%.  
Due to the deterministic nature of the operation, all 
algorithms identified activity completion with high accuracy 
as summarized in TABLE I. The PACER-E and PACER-C 
algorithms were also successful in identifying activity 
completion with latency reductions of 25.7% and 23.2%, 
respectively. The two algorithms do require additional 
computation to integrate or otherwise observe the current 
waveform. Given identical performance, PACER-T is the best 
choice in this application. 
B. Numonyx M25PX16 NOR Serial Flash 
NOR flash modules sacrifice byte-wise modification for 
overall capacity. The M25PX16 presents 16MBits of capacity 
in a small package, but the host must erase sub-sectors of flash 
(4K) to write pages of flash (128B). To perform a read-
modify-write operation, the host must read the contents of a 
sub-sector, modify the contents locally, erase the sub-sector in 
flash and finally write the modified contents back to the flash 
on a page-by-page basis. The complete state transition 
diagram is shown below in Figure 10. 
Both the sub-sector erase and page write have a worst-case 
delay specified by the manufacturer. PACER algorithms were 
run against both operations to find the comprehensive result. 
Although specified for 150ms, the current waveform indicates
 
Figure 10: Serial Flash Write State Transition Diagram 
 
Figure 11: NOR Serial Flash Write-Cycle using IODVS and PACER-T 
that the sub-sector erase completed approximately 65ms after 
it begins. Page writes are specified for a worst-case 
completion time of 10ms but through the application of 
PACER-T, they complete much faster as shown in TABLE II. 
The wait figure is the total amount of time spent waiting for 
the erase and the aggregate amount of time for each page 
write. The PACER-T algorithm delivered a 70% decrease in 
wait latency which yielded a 38.9% decrease in overall energy 
consumption. The worst-case manufacturer specification 
appears to be very pessimistic, although may be appropriate 
across both process and temperature variables.

C. Microchip SST26VF016B Serial NAND Flash 
The SST26 serial flash module uses NAND-like control 
logic to provide higher capacity and lower latency than the 
NOR serial flash. However, the device sacrifices the random-
access timing benefit of NOR flash. The serial flash module 
must therefore read an entire page of flash into a local buffer 
before providing read data to the host. This can result in non-
deterministic read and write access times. 
Despite the core logic differing from the M25PX16, 
PACER-T still performed the best. Application yielded a 
66.6% decrease in aggregate wait times and a 17.8% decrease 
in energy consumption due to waiting as shown in TABLE III.

D. An assortment of Micro-SD Memory Cards 
Onboard caches and memory management units cause the 
write operation of Micro-SD cards to have non-deterministic 
timing. In this case, PACER-C is the only algorithm that can 
reliably detect when the operation is finished. As with all 
memory tests, writes were performed with random data to 
random addresses throughout the memory space and so the 
cache performance is thoroughly exercised.  
Figure 13 shows the massive power and latency difference 
between a cache miss and a cache hit. The cache miss has an 
overall response time of about 150ms, while the cache hit has 
a response time of about 1ms. It is important to recall that 
PACER-C is effective in this situation because it samples 
current on the domain at 1us intervals and makes decisions 
with a 50 sample moving average. 
The SD-Card protocol is polling-based, as shown in the 
state transition diagram of Figure 14. There can be significant 
power-up and initialization delays. This prevents traditional 
dynamic power management (disabling the peripheral when 
not in use) techniques from being effective. Although constant 
polling is a good way to minimize latency, it results in extreme 
power increases. The analysis uses worst-case execution time 
(WCET) as the control group.

Figure 14: Micro-SD Memory Card Write State Transition Diagram 
The WCET for each Micro-SD Card was determined to be 
the longest-observed operation duration for the measurement 
set under consideration. This WCET typically corresponds 
with a cache miss on the device. 
Figure 15 helps to describe the performance differences 
shown in TABLE IV. The control delay is set to the WCET 
delay for each characterization, PACER-C allows the host to 
react to those operations deviating considerably from the 
control. Therefore, the Sandisk and Lexar cards benefitted 
considerably because they exhibit a bimodal timing 
distribution. The Swissbit card benefits decisively because of 
the mostly normal timing distribution. The Kingston card does 
not benefit as much because write timing exhibits a very low 
standard deviation. To present complete timing effects, a 
thorough latency analysis would need to be done on each 
device. Only energy results are presented here, but they are 
correlated with overall latency decreases.

The Sandisk, Lexar, Swissbit and Kingston cards were 
manufactured in 2007, 2008, 2014 and 2015, respectively. It 
is reasonable to infer that the technology within the card 
advanced considerably within that time and will continue to 
do so in the future. Another key-takeaway from the statistical 
distribution of write operations on random memory locations 
is that the associativity appears to be different between the 
cards. The Lexar and Sandisk cards appear to be set-
associative while the Swissbit appears to be fully associative. 
The standard deviation and response time was so low for the 
Kingston card that it cannot be determined what type of cache 
structure is used internally. 
E. Honeywell HIH-6130 Temperature / Humidity Sensor 
The Honeywell HIH-6130 communicates via the I2C bus. 
Therefore, the device must only match the host voltage during 
the host-read states which is convenient for IODVS 
application. As shown in the state transition diagram of Figure 
16, the host requests the sensor to take a measurement and 
then waits the manufacturer-specified 45ms for the 
measurement to complete. Finally, the host retrieves the 
completed measurement. PACER-E demonstrated the best 
performance among the algorithms, perhaps because of the 
capacitive nature of the peripheral ADC. The effects are 
shown in Figure 17 and the numeric results are presented in 
TABLE V.  
The PACER-T algorithm also produced impressive results 
with a wait latency of 31.66ms and wait energy of 254.14uJ. 
Compared with PACER-E, the result corresponds with a 
slightly increased latency of 0.5% and slightly increased 
energy consumption of 4.3%. For some applications, the 
simplicity of the PACER-T implementation may be preferable 
when compared to the best performing PACER-E algorithm.

VI. 
SYSTEM COST / BENEFIT ESTIMATION 
Application of the PACER algorithms results in moderate 
to extreme decreases in peripheral response time and power 
consumption. These algorithms do require that the application 
MCU perform some computation before and during the 
peripheral operation. All of the algorithms require a high-
precision (hardware) timer and PACER-E/C require active 
analog to digital conversion (ADC). 
Equation (1) of the introduction demonstrates the 
difficulty in accurately estimating the power consumption of 
a polling scenario. Fortunately, keeping the control group as 
the WCET does allow for an estimate of overall impact.

The resource requirements for implementing both the 
control group and the various PACER algorithms are shown 
in TABLE VI. Performance and power estimates of required 
peripherals among a few modern MCUs are shown in TABLE 
VII. The most important aspect of this data is the massive 
increase in CPU energy expenditure in order to enable high-
speed analog sampling. 
The PACER-E and PACER-C tests were completed with 
a 1us sampling period. The ADC results were transferred via 
DMA to a buffer where they were arithmetically manipulated 
in order to achieve the current and energy results as required 
by the algorithm. The Apollo2 MCU does not have a DMA 
unit onboard and therefore the sampling period would need to 
be reduced and CPU energy expenditure would rise. 
Fortunately, due to the sub-threshold switching nature of that 
MCU, the expected utilization increase would not result in 
substantially higher overall energy expenditure. 
Primarily, these tables indicate that PACER-T is generally 
the best algorithm to implement from a system-level 
evaluation. For non-deterministic peripherals such as the 
Micro-SD cards, only the PACER-C algorithm was able to 
detect early completions. In this case, a balance needs to be 
achieved between the energy costs of sample rate and 
peripheral latency/power reductions. 
VII. EXTENDED ALGORITHM RESULTS 
Previous sections presented only the result of the best 
algorithm. Complete results are presented in this section for 
each peripheral against each and every algorithm. 
There is an exception for the Micro-SD cards because 
those devices are non-deterministic and therefore the results 
presented in that section are already comprehensive. 
Note that the abridged results of the previous sections have 
had the final idle-phase of each test removed because that 
additional power consumption and latency is an artifact of the 
test fixture rather than real-world application. The following 
tables TABLE VIII through TABLE XV present the complete 
and comprehensive results of the tests run on each device 
under test.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS 
Applying the PACER suite of algorithms to a variety of 
common embedded peripherals resulted in significant 
reductions to both latency and energy consumption. The 
PACER-T algorithm performed best against time-bound 
operations and was very competitive in energy-bound 
operations. For non-deterministic operations, the PACER-C 
algorithm performed well. When measured against a median 
baseline, the algorithm performed even better as the 
operational latency increased in randomness. 
The PACER-T and PACER-E algorithms use successive 
approximation and the PACER-C algorithm uses a return-to-
idle measurement to determine activity completion. It is likely 
that the performance of both methods could be enhanced 
further through the application of more complex algorithms. 
PACER-T could be applied to memory operations with a 
bimodal delay distribution by first testing for a cache hit and 
then delaying for a determined cache-miss time. Likewise, the 
PACER-C algorithm could be modified online so as to 
identify the current waveform features corresponding varying 
latencies, thus allowing the MCU to sleep longer. 
The designer must be judicious in selecting the appropriate 
algorithm in order to minimize total energy expenditure. For 
most cases, the PACER-T algorithm provides sufficient 
performance improvements without the added computational 
and peripheral energy costs. For devices with a non-
deterministic operation execution time, then PACER-C is the 
only option. However, the designer can still adjust the sample 
rate so as to perhaps eliminate the need for DMA and reduce 
the duty cycle of the ADC. Reducing the sample rate will 
indeed increase the latency of the algorithm, but the overall 
implications and design tradeoffs should be handled at the 
system level. 
Combining the best aspects of PACER-T and PACER-C 
would be an interesting topic for further research. Predicting 
that a memory access will result in either a cache hit with 
minimal latency. Failing that, the algorithm could assume a 
cache miss and delay for a certain amount of time before 
resuming measurements to determine if current consumption 
has returned to the idle state. This method would strive to 
reduce the duty cycle of all three MCU energy consumers, the 
CPU, the ADC peripheral and the DMA peripheral. The 
algorithm could also eliminate the need to sample the voltage 
channel because only the current channel indicates activity. 
As the cost of computation in embedded systems 
continues to decrease, it is natural to devote more 
computational resources to minimizing system-wide energy 
consumption and latency. The PACER suite of algorithms use 
minimal computational resources and are shown to decrease 
latency by up to 67% and device energy consumption by up 
to 80% when compared to the naïve worst-case estimate.
