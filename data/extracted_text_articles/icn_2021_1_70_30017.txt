Abstract—In this paper, we present the performance of in-building 
small cells with the variation of carrier frequency from a low 
microwave band to a very high Terahertz (THz) band expected for 
the future Sixth-Generation (6G) mobile networks. We derive the 
average capacity, Spectral Efficiency (SE), Energy Efficiency 
(EE), and throughput per user of small cell networks. With 
extensive simulation results, we evaluate these performance 
metrics with a change in carrier frequency from a microwave 
band (i.e., 2 GHz), through a number of Millimeter-Wave 
(mmWave) bands (i.e., 28 GHz and 60 GHz), to a THz band (i.e., 
140 GHz). It is shown that due to the presence of Line-of-Sight 
(LOS) components and availability of large spectrum bandwidth, 
the high-frequency mmWave and THz bands can play significant 
roles in improving the above performance metrics and achieve 
both SE and EE requirements expected for 6G mobile networks 
by reusing spectrum of their respective bands for a certain 
number of buildings of small cells.

I. INTRODUCTION  
A. Background       
 
Exponentially increasing mobile traffic and high data rate 
demands, scarcity of the available radio spectrum, and 
limitations of the Base Station (BS) transmission power have 
caused Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) to move from large 
macrocell-only networks to Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets) 
[1]. In HetNets, small cells, typically deployed in indoor 
environments, cover a small area by reusing the spectrum 
bandwidth and play a significant role in serving high capacity 
and data rate within a short distance in mobile communication 
systems. To address the scarcity of available spectrum, the 
operating spectrum of small cells of one mobile generation shifts 
toward higher carrier frequencies than that of its predecessor 
one. As the signal propagation characteristics vary significantly 
with a change in carrier frequency, the performance of small 
cells also varies accordingly. This necessitates a deep 
understanding of how the channel performances within in-
building environments vary with a change in the carrier 
frequency of small cells.  
B. Related Work and Problem Statement  
      Numerous studies addressed the performance evaluation of 
small cells in multistory buildings, mostly in terms of signal 
propagation measurements, at different carrier frequencies. For 
example, the authors in [2] carried out propagation 
measurements in an indoor building environment at 900 MHz 
and 450 MHz. In [3], the authors presented a comparative study 
of two bands, below and above 6 GHz, including 3.5 GHz and 
28 GHz. Further, in [4], the authors presented 28 GHz and 73 
GHz millimeter-wave (mmWave) propagation measurements 
performed in a typical office environment. Furthermore, very 
recently, the authors in [5] performed channel measurements 
and path loss modeling in the Terahertz (THz) band.  
      Since the future Sixth-Generation (6G) network is expected 
to operate in low, as well as very high, frequency bands to 
address both coverage and capacity demands, instead of a 
certain frequency band discussed above, a common 
understanding of how the performance of small cells is affected 
with a change in the operating carrier frequency (and hence 
signal propagation characteristics) over a vast range, including 
very high THz band, is not obvious in the existing studies. To 
address this concern, in this paper, we present the performance 
analysis of in-building small cells over a vast range of carrier 
frequencies, from a low 2 GHz microwave band to a very high 
140 GHz band for an efficient utilization of the spectrum in 
these bands.   
 
In doing so, we consider a range of carrier frequencies that 
can cover the carrier frequencies of the former, existing, and 
upcoming mobile generations. More specifically, we start from 
a microwave band (i.e., 2 GHz used in the former Second-
Generation (2G) up to Fourth-Generation (4G)), through a 
number of mmWave bands (i.e., 28 GHz used in the existing 
Fifth-Generation (5G) and 60 GHz expected to be used in the 
enhanced version of the existing 5G), to a THz band (i.e., 140 
GHz) proposed to be used in the upcoming 6G mobile networks. 
However, due to a potential gap from one band to another of the 
above carrier frequencies, the channel characteristics in one 
band differ considerably from another. Hence, because of the 
occurrence of high small-scale fading effects, the Non-Line-of-
Sight (NLOS) channel model for the 2 GHz microwave band, 
whereas the Line-of-Sight (LOS) channel model for the 28 GHz 
and 60 GHz mmWave bands and the 140 GHz band, are 
considered and given for a distance d in m in Table I.   
C. Contribution 
Based on the above discussion and consideration, in this 
paper, we contribute the following.

GHz band to a very high 140 GHz band and derive the

D. Organization 
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we discuss 
the system architecture to evaluate the performance and derive 
performance metrics in terms of average capacity, Spectral 
Efficiency (SE), Energy Efficiency (EE), as well as average 
throughput per small cell user for all carrier frequencies. In 
Section III, performance evaluation scenarios are described, 
and extensive simulation results and performance comparisons 
are carried out. We draw a conclusion in Section IV.   
II. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND PERFORMANCE METRICS   
A. System Architecture         
We consider a simple system architecture for the 
performance evaluation as shown in Figure 1. A number of 
Picocell Base Stations (PBSs) are located outdoors, and all 
small cell BSs (SBSs) are located indoors within a number of

buildings situated over the coverage of a Microcell Base Station 
(MBS). A number of Macrocell User Equipments (UEs) are 
considered indoors and all other outdoor Macrocell UEs 
(MUEs) are either served by the MBS or offloaded to nearby 
PBSs. However, all Small Cell UEs (SUEs) are served only by 
in-building SBSs. Both MBSs and PBSs operate in the 2 GHz 
band, whereas all SBSs operate at either 2 GHz, 28 GHz, 60 
GHz, or 140 GHz band at any time.

2P ,
28
P ,
60

P
denote, respectively, the transmission power of a small cell 
when operating in the 2 GHz, 28 GHz, 60 GHz, and 140 GHz 
bands.  
M
P and 
PP denote, respectively, the transmission power 
of an MBS and a PBS. Let SM, SP, and SF denote, respectively 
the number of MBSs, PBSs, and SBSs per building. Because of 
the small coverage and low transmission power of a SBS, as 
well as low SUE speed, an indoor channel does not vary 
considerably within a short time such that we consider similar 
indoor signal propagation characteristics for all L buildings per 
macrocell.  
Then, by linear approximation, the system-level average 
capacity per macrocell of the MNO is given by the sum of the 
aggregate capacity of all macrocell UEs and the aggregate 
capacity of all small cell UEs in L buildings. So, using (4) and 
(7), the system-level average capacity per macrocell is given by

      Since SE is defined as the achievable capacity per unit of 
spectrum bandwidth, using (8), the system-level average SE in 
bps/Hz can be expressed as follows.

in Joule/bit can be expressed as follows.

3) Average throughput per SUE: Assume that each SBS 
can serve one SUE at any time in all carrier frequencies. The 
average throughput per SUE when SBSs operate in the 2 GHz 
band can then be expressed for SF  SBSs per building as follows.

      Following the above procedure and using (4)-(9) for the 2 
GHz band, the system-level average capacity, SE, EE, and 
average throughput per SUE when small cells operate in the 28 
GHz, 60 GHz, and 140 GHz can also be derived.  
III. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION SCENARIO, RESULT, AND 
COMPARISON  
A. Performance Evaluation Scenario         
Default simulation parameters and assumptions for SBSs 
are given in Table II. For MBSs and PBSs, detailed parameters 
and assumptions can be found in [10]. Note that, for fair 
analysis, we consider the same parameters and assumptions, 
wherever applicable, including system bandwidth, symbol 
duration, transmission power, antenna configuration, and 
antenna gain of all SBSs and UEs, for all carrier frequencies 
even though they differ from one carrier frequency to another 
in practice. RBs of any band are allocated orthogonally to SBSs 
in any TTI by the Proportional Fair (PF) scheduler to avoid CCI 
between SBSs. Moreover, for simplicity, we assume that no 
CCI effect is experienced by any in-building SBS when 
operating in the 60 GHz band due to coexisting with the IEEE 
802.11ad/ay, also termed as Wireless Gigabit (WiGig), access 
points.  
Further, we assume that each MNO in a country is allocated 
to a dedicated spectrum in the 2 GHz, 28 GHz, and 140 GHz 
bands such that no CCI effect is experienced by any in-building 
SBS due to operating in the spectrum by SBSs of another MNO. 
Such CCI can be either avoided using techniques such as the 
time-domain Almost Blank Subframe based Enhanced Intercell 
Interference Coordination (eICIC) technique for Long Term 
Evolution (LTE) systems or mitigated using techniques such as 
the underlay cognitive radio spectrum access technique, which 
we consider out of the scope of this paper. Finally, we generate 
the performance results by simulating all assumptions and 
parameters given in Tables I and II by a simulator built using 
the computational tool MATLAB R2012b version running on a 
personal computer.

B. Performance Evaluation Result   
      Figure 2(a) shows the path loss response for a SBS with the 
variation in distance d of its SUE. It can be found that the path 
loss at distance d from a SBS is the most when the SBS operates 
in the 140 GHz band, and the least, when it operates in the 2 
GHz microwave band. In general, with an increase in the carrier 
frequency, the path loss increases since a high-frequency signal 
gets affected more by the propagating environment than that of 
a low-frequency one. This implies that to address high capacity 
and data rate demands of the future mobile networks, the 
38

availability of large spectrum bandwidth in the high-frequency 
bands such as THz bands will play a vital role in serving high 
capacity and data rate demands within a short indoor distance 
from a SBS.   
      Figure 2(b) shows the response of the average throughput 
per SUE in different carrier frequencies. It can be observed that, 
for LOS signal propagations in the high-frequency bands, the 
average throughput per SUE over a certain time T decreases 
with an increase in the carrier frequency. This is because an 
increase in carrier frequency causes to increase in the distant-
dependent path loss as shown in Figure 2(a). However, the 
average throughput per SUE is the lowest when SBSs operate 
in the 2 GHz low-frequency band. This is due to the NLOS 
signal propagation that occurs from the presence of large 
multipath fading components in the low-frequency band unlike 
the high-frequency one with a LOS signal propagation as 
aforementioned.   
      Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show, respectively, the system-level 
SE and EE performances for the 10 MHz bandwidth of all 
MUEs. Recall that due to considering the LOS models, high-
frequency signals offer high average capacity, as well as 
average throughput per SUE because of highly directive signal 
propagation toward SUEs such that by forming appropriate 
beam width, the enormous amount of average capacity and 
hence SE can be obtained. Moreover, due to an increase in 
average capacity, the average energy required per bit 
transmission is also reduced, resulting in improving EE as well.

variation in the carrier frequency of in-building SBSs. 
 
Figure 3. System-level performances with a variation in the carrier frequency 
of in-building SBSs. (a) spectral efficiency and (b) energy efficiency. 
      From Figure 2(a), since the path loss increases with an 
increase in LOS carrier frequency, the system-level SE and EE 
improve with a decrease in carrier frequency. Hence, the 
maximum and minimum improvements in both SE and EE are 
obtained when SBSs operate in the 28 GHz and 140 GHz bands, 
respectively. However, due to the NLOS signal propagation 
effect, the 2 GHz band provides the worst performance in the 
average capacity (Figure 2(b)), resulting in realizing the worst 
system-level SE and EE performances in NLOS 2 GHz carrier 
frequency as shown in Figures 3(a) and 3(b). 
C. Performance Evaluation Comparison       
       Recall that unlike the low-frequency 2 GHz microwave 
band, which is affected considerably by the multipath fading 
effect from the reflection, refraction, and scattering 
phenomenon, due to the presence of LOS components and 
availability of large spectrum bandwidth, high carrier frequency 
bands can play significant roles in improving the in-building 
average throughput per SUE, as well as system-level average 
capacity, SE, and EE of the future mobile systems.  
      In this regard, assume that the prospective average SE and 
EE requirements for 6G mobile networks are, respectively, 10

times (i.e., 370 bps/Hz) [11] and 10-100 times (i.e., 0.3µJ/bit - 
0.03µJ/bit) [12] higher than that of 5G mobile networks [13]-
[14]. From Figures 3(a) and 3(b), it can be found that all high 
carrier frequency bands, i.e., 28 GHz, 60 GHz, and 140 GHz, 
can achieve both SE and EE requirements expected for 6G 
mobile networks by reusing spectrum in their respective bands 
for a reuse factor (i.e., L) of 26, 30, and 33, respectively.   
IV. CONCLUSION 
      Small cells deployed in indoor environments play a 
significant role in serving high capacity and data rate within a 
short distance in mobile communication systems. Due to the 
scarcity of spectrum, the operating spectrum of small cells of 
one mobile generation shifts toward higher carrier frequencies 
than that of its predecessor one. As the signal propagation 
characteristics vary significantly with a change in carrier 
frequency, in this paper, we have presented the performance of 
in-building small cells with the variation of carrier frequency 
from a low microwave band to a very high Terahertz (THz) 
band expected for the future Sixth-Generation (6G) mobile 
networks.  
       We have derived the average capacity, Spectral Efficiency 
(SE), Energy Efficiency (EE), and throughput per small cell UE 
(SUE) and carried out extensive simulation results with a 
change in carrier frequency from a microwave band (i.e., 2 
GHz), through a number of millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands 
(i.e., 28 GHz and 60 GHz), to a THz band (i.e., 140 GHz). It 
has been shown that due to the presence of LOS components, 
high-frequency signals offer high average capacity and hence 
SE, as well as average throughput per SUE. Moreover, due to 
an increase in average capacity, the average energy required per 
bit transmission is also reduced, resulting in improving EE as 
well. Since the path loss increases with an increase in LOS 
carrier frequency, the maximum and minimum improvements 
in both SE and EE are obtained when SBSs operate in the 28 
GHz and 140 GHz bands, respectively.  
      However, due to the NLOS signal propagation effect, the 2 
GHz band is affected considerably by the multipath fading 
effect from the reflection, refraction, and scattering 
phenomenon such that the 2 GHz band provides the worst 
performance in the average capacity. This results in achieving 
the worst system-level SE and EE performances. Finally, it has 
been shown that all high carrier frequency bands, i.e., 28 GHz, 
60 GHz, and 140 GHz, can achieve both SE and EE 
requirements expected for 6G mobile networks by reusing 
spectrum in their respective bands for a reuse factor (i.e., L) of 
26, 30, and 33, respectively.
