Abstract—In this paper, the trade-off on resource allocation 
between multi-hop backhaul and access is investigated. Multi-
hop, treated as a special case of mesh, is very useful in non-
contention based network. We assume in-band relay backhaul 
and access share the same resource. Based on calculation and 
simulation, the relationship among resource allocation, cell 
coverage and channel status is revealed under two relay 
schemes.

 INTRODUCTION 
Wireless multi-hop networks have attracted lots of 
attentions in recent years as the next evolutionary step for 
wireless data networks. It is more feasible and effective than 
pure mesh structure, especially in non-contention based 
wireless network. Non-contention wireless network contains, 
such as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access 
(WiMAX) [1], Long Term Evolution (LTE) [2], High Speed 
Uplink Packet Access (HSPA) [3] and so on. These networks 
carefully schedule the radio resource to avoid interference 
and efficiently utilize the radio resource. Pure mesh structure 
is not so easy to be implemented in such a network, due to 
synchronization, interference and so on. 
Currently, WiMAX and LTE both setup relay work 
group to study how to build multi-hop backhaul in access 
cell. 
WiMAX technology is becoming increasingly popular as 
a number of service providers are deploying WiMAX to 
provide wireless broadband connectivity to customers. IEEE 
802.16j work group is focusing on multi-hop relay networks 
that will enable multi-hop communication in mobile 
WiMAX (IEEE 802.16e) networks. In such a network, 
mobile stations or subscriber stations may communicate with 
a Relay Station (RS) instead of communicating directly with 
the Base Station (BS) [4][5]. 
Similarly, people also proposed relay system in LTE-
Advanced [6][7]. Generally, relay is essentially backhaul 
function plus access function in one node. LTE based 
wireless backhaul can be classified into in-band and out-band 
backhaul solutions. In-band backhaul, such as LTE in-band 
relay and IEEE802.16j [4][5], will share the radio resource 
with access. Out-band backhaul will use another independent 
radio resource from access. In this paper, we focus on in-
band multi-hop relay. 
In [9], the coverage and capacity of in-band relay in 
urban area were simulated. The realistic performance of 
relay in suburban area was illustrated in [10].  
In this paper, we will build an Orthogonal Frequency 
Division 
Multiplexing 
(OFDM)-based 
two-hop 
relay 
network to cover most cases, e.g., LTE, WiMAX. Then we 
will study the resource allocation balance between backhaul 
and access under different cell radius, various channel status, 
and different relay schemes. The performance will be 
compared in in-band and out-band relay, so as to indicate the 
respective use cases. 
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, system 
model is described and two relay schemes are defined for 
multi-hop backhaul part. Here, we will investigate a two-hop 
in-band backhaul system with access. The assumptions are 
also given. In Section III, the calculation steps are given and 
a static system level simulation is built to help get the final 
results [8]. The obtained results are analyzed in detail as well. 
In Section IV, we get the final conclusions. 
II. 
SYSTEM MODEL 
Since access and backhaul parts share the same radio 
resource, an efficient resource management will be very 
important to avoid congestion regardless in access or 
backhaul. Generally, there are two kinds of methods—
dynamic allocation and static allocation. 
Comparatively, dynamic allocation is more efficient. The 
system obtains the statistics of the access/backhaul 
requirement and the channel qualities, and calculates the 
resource trade-off between access part and backhaul part 
instantly. 
Here, we assume an ideal dynamic allocation to avoid 
any congestion or unbalance between backhaul and access, 
which means that BS knows all instant channel information 
of all links and allocation granularity is very small. 
We also assume two configurations at two-hop relay part. 
The first scheme is the traditional one, which means different 
relay backhaul links will use orthogonal resources. The 
15

second scheme allows relay backhaul links to utilize Spatial 
Division Multiplex Access (SDMA) to save radio resource. 
That means same resources can be spatially reused among 
different backhaul links with directional antennas. 
Details are as follows. 
A. Relay Scheme  1 
We assume a cell deployment structure shown in Figure 
1. All base stations (BSs) or relays are located at the center 
of hexagon cell. The access radio resource is separated into 
three parts as shown in Figure 2 and reused among the cells 
shown in Figure 1. Similarly, the backhaul resource is also 
reused as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. Different backhaul 
links will use orthogonal resources. 
Additionally, we call the central cell as egress cell. In 
egress cell as shown in Figure 1, all access traffics from 
these 19 cells are collected and backhauled to this egress BS, 
which is called Donor eNB in LTE-A [6][7]. We treat this 
node as wireless backhaul egress, since generally there will 
be a fiber connection on this node to continue to backhaul all 
traffics to core network. 
Around egress cell, there are 6 cells called 1st tier cells as 
shown in Figure 1. Around 1st tier, 2nd tier consists of 12 
cells. Backhaul links connecting egress cell and 1st tier cells 
are called 1st hop, while those connecting 1st tier and 2nd 
tier are called 2nd hop. 
Note that the first hop backhaul generally occupies more 
resources than the second hop due to the much more 
backhaul traffic. In Figure 1 thicker backhaul line means 
more radio resource occupation.

Figure 2.  OFDM subcarrier assignment for relay scheme 1. 
B. Relay Scheme  2 
We assume another cell deployment shown in Figure 3. 
Similarly, the access radio resource is separated into three 
parts as shown in Figure 4 and orthogonally reused in Figure 
3. Here, the backhaul resource is spatially reused as shown in 
Figures 3 and 4. Different backhaul links will use the same 
resource by for example Spatial Division Multiplex Access 
(SDMA) through directional antennas. Note that the first hop 
still occupies more resource than the second hop due to the 
much more backhaul traffic. In Figure 3, thicker backhaul 
line means more radio resource occupation.

C. Assumptions in System Model 
We assume that each cell has the same user density and 
the same traffic requirement of each user (calculated by 
Shannon Capacity). All cells have many users and are full-
loaded. 
Obviously, if a cell is close to the backhaul egress, the 
backhaul requirement will be much higher, because this cell 
has to backhaul not only its own traffic but also those of its 
child nodes. The cell close to the egress surely will consume 
more radio resource for backhaul. 
Here, we assume all cells have the same radius r. 
The other assumptions are as follows. All the cell access 
parts have the same path loss factor 
γ A
, and all the backhaul 
channels also have the same path loss factor 
γ BH
. Assuming 
carrier frequency is fc; the transmit powers for access and 
backhaul are PA and PBH respectively; the noise power is N. 
BA and BBH are the bandwidths for access and backhaul parts 
in the second tier and second hop respectively. The total 
bandwidth is B. E(.) is the expectation operation.

CALCULATION AND SIMULATION RESULTS 
Here, we build a static system level simulation, and use 
Monte-Carlo method to get the results according to [8]. 
We use Shannon Capacity to calculate the throughput for 
users and backhaul part.

Here, BA and BBH are the bandwidths for access in each 
cell and backhaul parts in the second tier respectively. GA 
and GBH are the antenna gains in access part and in backhaul 
part respectively. As shown in Figure 1, the backhaul link in 
the first tier will transmit more traffic, including its own and 
its child cells’. Therefore, the backhaul bandwidth in first tier 
should be 3*BBH, since it will backhaul three cells’ traffic. 
Finally, assuming the total bandwidth is B, according to 
Figure 1, we have

It is hard to obtain a close-form result of the left side in

Monte Carlo simulation [8]. 
 
An example is as follows. With the parameters in Table I 
and B=10MHz, according to Monte Carlo simulation, we 
have

According to (3), (4) and (5), we can obtain the 
bandwidth requirement for access and backhaul in the 
second tier as 
BA: BBH=6.014:1.91 
We use equal mark in (4) and obtain 
BA=2.18MHz   and  BBH=0.6922MHz 
For the egress cell and the cells in the first tier and the 
second tier, the resource for access in each cell is same, i.e., 
BA. For the 1st hop backhaul from the first tier to the egress 
cell, we require 3*BBH. For the 2nd hop backhaul from the 
second tier to the first tier, we require BBH. 
According to the mentioned example, we can calculate 
the bandwidth for access and backhaul in case of different 
parameters.

With the parameters in the mentioned example and 
different path loss factors 
γ A
 in access (gammaA in Figure 
5), we can get Figure 5. In Figure 5, the proportion of total

Here, BA and BBH are the bandwidths for access in each

According to (6), (7) and (8), we can obtain the 
bandwidth requirement for access in each cell and backhaul 
in the second tier as 
BA: BBH=6.014:1.91 
We use equal mark in (7) and obtain 
BA=2.53MHz   and  BBH=0.80347MHz 
For the egress cell and the cells in the first tier and the 
second tier, the resource for access in each cell is same, i.e., 
BA. For the 1st hop backhaul link, we require 3*BBH for each. 
For the 2nd hop backhaul link, we require BBH for each. 
 
With the parameters in the mentioned example and 
different path loss factors 
γ A
 in access (gammaA in Figure 
6), we can get Figure 6. In Figure 6, the proportion of total 
access bandwidth in case of different path loss factors in 
access is shown, i.e., (
)
3*
A
B
B . It is shown that we require 
more access resource with higher path loss in access. 
C. Simulation Results Analysis 
According to Figure 5 and Figure 6, it is shown that 
when access has bad channel status, i.e., high path loss factor, 
access will occupy more bandwidth. In this case, backhaul 
will consume little bandwidth due to good channel status. If 
we meet large cell radius, access will occupy almost all 
bandwidth as shown in figures. 
If access has relatively good channel status (
γ A
=3), i.e., 
low path loss factor, the proportion of access bandwidth has 
a peak value. As shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6, the peak 
value of scheme 1 is about 0.46 at cell radius equal to about 
4000 meters, while the peak value of scheme 2 is about 0.6 at 
cell radius equal to about 4500 meters. 
 
Figure 6.  Proportion of Total Access Bandwidth over Total Bandwidth 
for Relay Scheme 2. 
In this case, as cell radius enlarging, the proportion of 
access bandwidth will increase, but after achieving peak 
value, the proportion will decrease. The reason is that if the 
cell radius is too large, path loss in multi-hop backhaul part 
will relatively increase faster and require more bandwidth. 
In a word, the radio resource trade-off between multi-hop 
backhaul and access yields different characteristics under 
different channel status.

bps. With the parameters in Table I, we 
can get Figure 7 for scheme 1 and scheme 2. The capacity of 
traditional cell without in-band multi-hop backhaul (BH) is 
also shown (“cell capacity w/o in-band backhaul” in Figure 
7). 
Note that a cell without in-band backhaul can be a cell 
with out-band wireless backhaul or wired backhaul, such as

fiber, ATM, and so on. We also call this cell as traditional 
cell. 
In Figure 7, the real throughput requirements in each cell 
based on different traffic densities are shown (different D in 
Figure 7). It also shows the throughput provided by access 
cells in case of schemes 1 and 2. 
Obviously, only if the provided cell throughput is larger 
than the real traffic requirement, the user communication can 
be satisfied, i.e., the three red lines in Figure 7 should be on 
the upper of the other lines. According to Figure 7, we can 
get the coverage radius limit under different cases in Table II.

Thus in order to cover a specific area of 100km2, the 
required number of BSs is listed in Table III. Here, BS 
means BS or relay, i.e., any access node.

From this table, we can see that schemes 1 and 2, i.e., in-
band backhaul, are more suitable for rural area or the area of 
low traffic density, since in-band relay results in similar 
number of access nodes as traditional cells. 
In urban area, scheme 1 and 2 result in much more BSs 
than traditional cell, which may cause cost increasing and 
more handoff overhead. However, scheme 2 causes fewer 
BSs than scheme 1, which means that SDMA among multi-
hop backhaul is an efficient method to save radio resource. 
In rural area or semi rural area, comparison between 
scheme 1 and scheme 2 shows that SDMA yield little gain. 
Scheme 2 even results in same number of BSs as traditional 
cell. 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we studied a non-contention based OFDM 
in-band multi-hop system. Under two relay schemes, the 
allocation results for multi-hop backhaul and access are 
analyzed. It is shown that if access part has much worse 
channel status than backhaul part, the access will occupy 
more and more resources with increased cell radius. If 
backhaul part has similar channel status with access part, the 
access part will occupy more resources at the beginning, but 
the occupied resources will be decreased with continuing 
increased cell radius. 
If we use SDMA at multi-hop backhaul part, resource 
will be saved, and relay can cover larger area. However, it is 
much more effective in urban area than in rural area. Further 
study revealed that in-band relay is more suitable for low 
traffic density area.
