Abstract—Object of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of 
propriocettive Focal Stimulation on Gait in moderate 
Parkinson (PD) patients by a preliminary open multicentric 
study, using Equistasi®, nanotechnological device of the 
dimension of a plaster which generates High Frequency 
segmental vibration. The efficacy of Gait Analysis (GA) on 
evaluating gait modification on Parkinson’s Disease (PD) 
Patients is already well known. On the other hand, several 
studies have shown that Proprioceptive Focal Stimulation 
seems to be useful in symptoms amelioration in several 
neurological disease. Therefore, GA was recorded in a group of 
PD patients. Twenty-one PD patients (age 69,51 years, 
Duration disease 8.52 years, Duration Therapy 7,19 years; 
H&Y 2.46) at their best on therapy, were enrolled in the study. 
Two GA were performed always at the morning, before and 
after the treatment.  Three plaques devices were put on the 
skin: one at C7, one at the right and the left leg, on soleus 
muscle. Equistasi® is a nanotechnological device of the 
dimension of a plaster which generates High Frequency 
segmental vibration.  Clinical state was monitored by 
MDUPDRS part III. Parametric (One-way ANOVA and 
paired t-Student) and not – parametric statistic (Freidman 
ANOVA and Wilcoxon test) were used. The analysis of the 
Spatial –Temporal variables showed a significant improvement 
of Mean Velocity (MV) p=.002, Stride Lenght (SL) in right and 
left respectively p=.0013 and p=.017, Stance (STA) in right and 
left respectively p=.025 and p=.047 and Double Support Stance 
(DSS) in left and right stride respectively p=.034 and p=.033. 
MDUPDRS Part III was statistically reduced with p=0.017; 
furthermore the items 3.10, and 3.12 were statistically reduced 
respectively with p=.025 and p=.046. The results, in this group 
of patients, encourage to investigate the mechanical focal 
vibration as stimulation of proprioceptive system in PD. The 
effect of the device on patients may open a new possibility to 
the management of PD. The data indicates as the device 
ameliorates postural stability and gait performance and 
confirms the support that GA gives to underlight the 
modifications of gait in PD patients.

INTRODUCTION 
Parkinson’s 
Disease 
one 
of 
more 
diffuse 
neurodegenerative disease, second after Alzheimer’s disease, 
present four cardinal motor symptoms: tremor, rigidity, 
bradykinesia, and postural instability. Last sign is the more 
influent on the activity of daily living, because it induces 
falls [10]. Pharmacological therapy as well as surgical 
therapy are not enough to well control this symptom, and 
many times the postural instability may induce fear to fall 
syndrome, and the PD patient are confined in wheelchair 
[11].  It is already know the Basal Ganglia have golden role 
in the pathological progression of PD patients, but it is not 
really true for balance and postural instability, where the 
Supplementary Motor Area, seems to be an important role 
specially, 
on 
production 
of 
Anticipatory 
Postural 
Adjustments (APAs). Humans in fact use anticipatory and 
compensatory postural strategies to maintain and restore 
balance 
when 
perturbed. 
Inefficient 
generation 
and 
utilization of anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) is one 
of the reasons for postural instability [12]. SMA is a relay of 
many loops, not only cortical-subcortical loop (cortical-
BBGG- thalamic- Cortical loop), but also vestibular loop, 
and proprioceptive loop and is known that gait analysis is 
important for the clinical evaluation of PD patients [1]. 
Equistasi®, nanotechnological device of the dimension of a 
plaster which generates High Frequency segmental vibration. 
It is not really known how this devise works, there are some 
studies indicating that this focal stimulation modifies the H 
wave in the medulla [13] and in PD patients, the presence of 
Equistasi improves effects of rehabilitation [2]. Object of the 
study was to evaluate the efficacy of Propriocettive Focal 
Stimulation in moderate Parkinson disease patients by a 
preliminary open study.

centers in Italy: S. Lucia Foundation in Rome (principal 
center), the Auxologic Institute of Piancavallo Verbania, the 
Villa Margherita Clinic in Vicenza and the Mondino 
Neurological Institute of Pavia, each received approval from 
their ethics committee with protocol number respectively 
CE/PROG 478/15 del 19/11/2015, 58/16, 61/16, 60/16 After 
screening 
and 
enrollment, 
the 
patients 
receive 
a 
proprioceptive mechanical stimulation for 8 weeks with the 
Equistasi method [2], in the absence of any other 
rehabilitative trials. Informed consent was obtained from the 
participants. 
B.
Subjects 
Participants could be included if they had consented to 
participation, patients with rigid akinetik form of bilateral 
idiopatic Parkinsons Diseasei (Hoehn and Yahr 2-3) in 
according to current criteria [3] for at least four years with a 
good response to antiparkinsonian therapy and with stable 
drug therapy for at least 3 months. The exclusion criteria 
were: presence of co-morbidity that prevent safe mobility or 
exercise (including clinically evident neuropathy and 
important medical conditions such as malignant tumors), 
severe dysautonomia with marked hypotension, major 
depression of mood, dementia, pregnancy, caridac pacer 
maker, deep brain stimulation (DBS) or other conditions 
affecting postural stability (eg poor visual acuity or 
vestibular dysfunction). In addition, patients had to have a 
MMSE > 24 points [5]. 
C.
Instrumental assessment 
As primary measures of outcome for Gait Analisys 3D  
the main measures of the linear path (BTS Smart system 
with Davis Procol in all the Centers) were evaluated: the 
speed (Velocity), the length of the step (Stride Length), the 
percentage of support times (Stance) and the percentage of 
the times of double support (DST).  
D.
Clinical assessment 
Motor impairment was assessed with the parts III (motor 
examination) of the Unified PD Rating Scale [6] and Items 
3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 were separately evaluated for 
underlying data on gait, freezing of gait, postural and 
postural instability of PD patients. Other data collected at 
baseline included age, gender, body mass index (BMI), 
disease duration, Hoehn and Yahr scale, anti Parkinsonian 
treatment expressed as levodopa-equivalent daily dose [7] 
and cognitive status assessed with the MMSE. All adverse 
events such as injuries, were verified and recorded during the 
study.  
E.
Statistical Analysis 
This clinical trial used a sample of convenience, with the 
assumption that 21 participants would be ample to explore 
safety and feasibility. Given the small sample and the lack of 
normal distribution of most of the variables on Shapiro-Wilk 
test, nonparametric statistics were used. Treatment effect 
across time points were explored Wilcoxon signedrank test. 
we have also verified with Montecarlo method (MC) [12] 
[13], the adequacy of the p-value estimates. Categorical 
variables were compared by means of chisquare test. All 
values were expressed as mean and standard deviation were 
chosen to improve clarity of data presentation. IBM SPSS 
Statistics ver. 20.0 was used for all statistical analyses. All 
tests were two-sided with a level of significance set at 
P,0.05. 
III.
RESULT 
Twenty-one subjects were enrolled in this open study 
(Table 1) and we have observed the clinical and instrumental 
assessments before (T0) and after (T1) 8 weeks of treatment. 
No major adverse events or death were observed during the 
study period.

CONCLUSION 
It is already demonstrated that the vibration of the axial 
muscles, produces systematic change in the erect posture 
[15] and the in the orientation of the body [16], and it 
induces in an improvement of balance. The imperceptible 
vibration released from the Equistasi device, have already 
given a positive response in the rehabilitation of some 
neurodegenerative pathologies [2] [17] [18] and have also 
highlighted their capacity in the modulation of the spinal 
circuit [13]. Nevertheless, the data indicate a trend of 
improvement on all spatial-temporal parameters, as if the 
vibrations were acting even on different circuits from the 
dopaminergic. It is noted in literature how the rehabilitation 
of Parkinson’s disease is centered on the stimulation of the 
vestibule spinal reflex (VSR), can modify those components 
of the ambulation more correlated with the rhythmicity and 
the equilibrium [19]. Furthermore precedent studies put in 
evidence how in PD there a compromise sense of timing [20] 
and of the discrimination of the proprioceptive input [21]. 
Therefore, the focal muscular vibration (FV) not only have 
an impact on the circuit on the spinal cord, but also provide a 
notable proprioceptive influx to different parts of the central 
nervous system, thus influencing the precision of the 
execution of the voluntary movements [14]. This open-label 
study has the limit of not being controlled and the number of 
patients must be calculated appropriately to have a power of 
at least 80%. Nevertheless, the results, in this group of 
patients, encourage to investigate the mechanical focal 
vibration as stimulation of proprioceptive system in 
Parkinson’s disease patients, and open a new possibility for 
management of moderate PD patients. Moreover, this study 
confirms the importance of GA in the clinical approach of 
Parkinson’s disease.
