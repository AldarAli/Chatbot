Abstract— We revisit the theory and applications of the 
Projective Adaptive Resonance Theory (PART) neural 
network architecture for clustering high dimensional data in 
low dimensional subspaces and nonlinear manifolds. We put a 
number of PhD theses, research publications and projects of 
the York University’s Laboratory for Industrial and Applied 
Mathematics (LIAM) in a coherent framework about 
information processing delay, high dimension data clustering, 
and nonlinear neural dynamics. The objective is to develop 
both mathematical foundation and effective techniques/tools 
for pattern recognition in high dimensional data.

 INTRODUCTION 
In a series of studies starting in the papers [1] [2] and the 
thesis [3], the Laboratory for Industrial and Applied 
Mathematics (LIAM) at York University (Toronto, Canada) 
has been developing a comprehensive framework about 
information 
processing 
delay, 
high 
dimension 
data 
clustering, and nonlinear neural dynamics. The objective is 
to develop both mathematical foundation and effective 
techniques/tools for pattern recognition in high dimensional 
data. Some of the earlier developments have been reported 
in the monograph [4] and the survey [5]. The survey also 
provided a heuristic description of the philosophy about 
how the modern nonlinear dynamic systems theory 
(invariant 
manifolds, 
domain 
attractions, 
global 
convergence, Lyapunov functions etc.) provides some 
theoretical principles based on recent biological evidences 
for novel neural network based clustering architectures to 
speed up information processing to assist decision making. 
Here, we briefly describe the current status (Section II) and 
then summarize the interdisciplinary nature (Section III) of 
a high dimensional data projective-clustering driven 
academic-industrial collaboration based on nonlinear 
dynamics and neural networks.  
II. 
CURRENT STATUS 
Under the framework “Projective Adaptive Resonance 
Theory” (PART), we developed a novel neural network 
architecture and algorithm to detect low dimensional 
patterns in a high dimensional data set. These are the 
patterns characterized by the so-called projective clusters, in 
nonlinear subspaces or nonlinear manifolds. PART has 
received much attention by data science researcher and 
end-user community, and has formed the core data analytics 
tools of three Collaborative Research Development projects 
(CRD), funded by the Natural Science and Engineering 
Research Council of Canada (NSERC). In particular, the 
NSERC CRD project Enterprize Software for Data 
Analytics in collaboration with InferSystems Inc. is based 
on the application of PART to analyzing odd bidding 
behaviors in a real-time bidding auction; while the project 
An Online Integrated Health Risk Assessment Tool brings 
together a team of investigators with expertise for an 
interdisciplinary and multi-institutional collaboration to 
develop systematic analyses converging on a single number, 
modeled after the single-number Credit Score, to inform 
chronic disease decision making, both at the population and 
individual levels. These are also part of a newly funded 
NSERC Collaborative Research and Training Experience 
Program in Data Analytics & Visualization.  
 
The PART algorithm has since been used in a number of 
applications. It was used to develop a powerful gene 
filtering and cancer diagnosis method in [6][7][8], which 
shows that “the results have proven that PART was superior 
for gene screening". PART was also used for clustering 
neural spiking trains [9], ontology construction [10], stock 
associations [11], and information propagation in online 
social networks [12][13]. The PART algorithm has also 
been extended to deal with categorical data in the thesis 
[14]. 
 
The PART architecture is based on the well known ART 
developed by Carpenter and Grossberg, with a selective 
output signaling (SOS) mechanism to deal with the inherent 
sparsity in the full space of the data points in order to focus 
on dimensions where information can be found. The key 
feature of the PART network is a hidden layer of neurons 
which incorporates SOS to calculate the dissimilarity 
between the output of a given input neuron with the 
corresponding component of the template (statistical mean) 
of a candidate cluster neuron and to allow the signal to be 
transmitted to the cluster neuron only when the similarity 
measure 
is 
sufficiently 
large. 
Recently 
discovered 
physiological properties of the nervous system, the 
adaptability of transmission time delays and the signal 
losses that necessarily arises in the presence of transmission 
delay, enabled us to interpret SOS as a plausible mechanism 
from the self-organized adaptation of transmission delays 
driven by the aforementioned dissimilarity. The result is a

novel 
clustering 
network, 
termed 
PART–D, 
with 
physiological evidence from living neural network and 
rigorous mathematical proof of exceptional computational 
performance [15].  
 
Such an adaptation can be regarded as a consequence of 
the Hebbian learning law, and the dynamic adaptation can 
be modeled by a nonlinear differential equation using 
dissimilarity driven delay in signal processing. This links to 
the PhD thesis [16], which proposed an alternative neural 
network formulation of the Fitts’ law for the speed-accuracy 
trade-off of information processing, and its subsequent 
publications including [17][18][19][20]. When the delay 
adaption rates are in certain ranges, we observe nonlinear 
oscillatory behaviors (clustering switching) and this 
oscillation slows down the convergence of the clustering 
algorithm. How to detect and prevent these oscillations is 
the focus of the thesis [21] the studies [22][23].  
III. 
SUMMARY 
In summary, there have been increasing physiological 
evidences to support the idea of projective clustering using 
neural networks with delay adaption, there has been some 
theoretical analysis to show why such a network 
architecture works well for high dimensional data, and there 
have been sufficient applications to illustrate PART  
clustering algorithms are efficient. An interdisciplinary 
approach for high dimensional data clustering clearly shows 
the potential to develop a dynamical system framework for 
pattern recognition in high dimensional data.
