Abstract— A Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is used to evaluate 
the performance of an optical differential phase-shift keying 
(DPSK) communication system impaired by in-band crosstalk. 
The MC simulation results are used to study the validity range of 
an analytical work proposed in the literature addressing the same 
problem. It is shown that the performance estimates obtained 
using the analytical work become incorrect, whenever the effect 
of inter-symbol interference (ISI) is enhanced, for example, for 
optical filter bandwidths below twice the DPSK signal 
bandwidth. When ISI is negligible, a slight discrepancy is 
observed between the performance estimates of both methods, 
because the two formalisms consider different models for the 
random phase noise. 
Keywords – optical communication systems; Monte Carlo 
simulation; differential phase-shift keying; in-band crosstalk.

INTRODUCTION 
In the last decade, differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) 
modulation [1] has attracted much attention in optical 
communication systems, mainly due to its ~3 dB advantage in 
receiver sensitivity when balanced detection is used, in 
comparison with the conventional on-off keying (OOK) 
modulation. 
Additionally, 
the 
DPSK 
outperforms 
the 
conventional 
OOK 
in its 
robustness 
to transmission 
impairments and tolerance to signal power fluctuations. 
Regarding optical networking, it has been experimentally 
found that the DPSK signal with balanced detection has ~6 dB 
higher tolerance to in-band crosstalk than the OOK signal [2]. 
Crosstalk due to the imperfect isolation of optical 
components, such as optical filters, (de)multiplexers and 
optical switches, used in optical network nodes is considered 
one of the most important physical layer limitations in optical 
networks. The crosstalk signals may arise from distinct sources 
or from the same source of the original signal. When the 
crosstalk signal arises from distinct sources, it may have the 
same wavelength as the original signal or have different 
wavelengths, giving rise to in-band crosstalk and inter-band 
crosstalk, respectively [3]. In-band crosstalk is the most severe 
form of crosstalk, because the signal-crosstalk beating terms 
originated at the receiver cannot be removed by filtering [4].  
In this work, the influence of in-band crosstalk on the 
performance of an optical DPSK receiver is analyzed by Monte 
Carlo (MC) simulation. One major goal is to study the validity 
range of an analytical work proposed in the literature [4], [5], 
that addresses the same issue, keeping in mind that this work 
was developed considering an isolated DPSK symbol. The MC 
simulation, on the other way, considers a sequence of DPSK 
symbols, and takes into account the inter-symbol interference 
(ISI) effect on the performance. The impact of in-band 
crosstalk on the receiver performance is investigated for 
different receiver filters configurations, for an increasing 
crosstalk level, by taking into account the delay between the 
DPSK signal and the crosstalk signal, for different sequences 
of bits on the crosstalk signal, by considering receiver 
imperfections and for multiple interfering terms. 
This work is organized as follows: Section II describes the 
model used to characterize the optical DPSK receiver and the 
MC simulation implementation. Numerical results are obtained 
in Section III. The conclusions are outlined in Section IV.

B. Implementation of the MC simulation 
The main goal of this work is to develop a MC simulation 
tool capable of evaluating the performance of an optical DPSK 
receiver impaired by in-band crosstalk. The MC simulation is 
used to study the validity range of the analytical work proposed 
in [4], which was developed considering an isolated DPSK 
symbol. In the simulation, a pseudorandom deBruijn binary 
sequence with length 
b
N  bits is generated, which allows to 
study the effect of ISI on the DPSK receiver performance. 
Then, to obtain the DPSK format, the signal is encoded 
differentially, considering that for each bit ‘one’ the optical 
phase does not change, and for each bit ‘zero’ a π-phase 
change is introduced. The bits sequence on the DPSK crosstalk 
signal is generated randomly and the random phase noise on 
the crosstalk signal is generated considering a Brownian 
motion model [7]. Notice that in the analytical work [4], the 
random phase noise is assumed constant over the bit period and 
with a uniform distribution. In the simulation, the ASE noise is 
generated using a random number generator, which follows a 
Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance

At each MC iteration, in accordance with (1), a sample 
function of the ASE noise and a sample function of the DPSK 
crosstalk signal with random phase noise are added to the 
DPSK original signal obtained from the deBruijn sequence. 
Then, the current at the decision circuit input is computed using 
the MC simulator, by passing the field described in (1) through 
the receiver model (using the frequency domain description of 
the optical and electrical filtering), and it is sampled. After 
sampling, each received bit, that is corrupted by noise and 
crosstalk, is compared to the corresponding transmitted bit to 
find out if an error has occurred. The MC iterations are 
repeated, until a specified

attained. Then, the bit error probability (BEP) is estimated

RESULTS 
In this section, the results corresponding to the performance 
of the optical DPSK receiver obtained using MC simulation are 
presented and compared with analytical results [4]. The 
performance of the optical DPSK direct detection receiver is 
assessed in presence of in-band crosstalk, considering: 1) 
different optical and electrical filters with different –3 dB 
bandwidths; 2) different crosstalk levels; 3) different sequence 
of bits on the DPSK crosstalk signal; 4) different delays 
between the crosstalk signal and the original signal; 5) two 
types of receiver imperfections, responsivity imbalance and DI 
detuning; and 6) multiple interfering terms. All results have 
been obtained considering the parameters shown in Table 1, 
and unless otherwise stated, these parameters are used 
throughout this work.

A. Optical DPSK receiver without in-band crosstalk 
In this subsection, the MC simulation is used to evaluate 
the optical DPSK receiver performance impaired only by ASE 
noise. The MC simulation results are compared to the results of 
the analytical formalism [4]. The study is performed for 
different optical signal powers and for different optical filter 
bandwidths for the ideal receiver configuration. In-band 
crosstalk and receiver imperfections are neglected in this study.

Fig. 2 shows the BEP estimates obtained using MC 
simulation and using the analytical formalism [4] as a function 
of the optical signal power, Ps, for different optical filter –3 dB 
bandwidths,. As the MC simulation is obtained with a sequence 
of bits, it takes into account the ISI effect on the DPSK receiver 
performance. The analytical formulation neglects this effect, 
and due to this difference, for smaller normalized optical filter 
bandwidths (

shows that, for the same optical signal power, there is a severe 
increase of the BEP with the optical filter bandwidth 
enlargement. This occurs because with the increase of the 
optical filter bandwidth, the filtered ASE noise power is higher, 
and the DPSK receiver performance becomes degraded.

. As shown in Fig. 3, it can be assumed that 
the simulated results become sufficiently approximated to the 
analytical ones for BoTb = 2. This means that the ISI starts to 
lose its influence as the dominant source of performance 
degradation and provides a reference for the optical filter 
bandwidth above which, the accuracy of the analytical 
formalism, that neglects ISI, is ensured.  
Other receiver filters configurations have been studied and 
a good agreement was found between the BEPs obtained using 
MC simulation and analytically. A good agreement with the 
results presented in [9] was also found, which further ensure us 
that the MC simulation is well implemented.

B. Optical DPSK receiver impaired by in-band crosstalk due 
to a single interferer 
In this subsection, the performance of the optical DPSK 
receiver is analyzed in presence of ASE noise and in-band 
crosstalk, considering a single interfering term. The estimates 
obtained through MC simulation are compared to the estimates 
obtained with the analytical formalism [4]. Firstly, the BEP is 
evaluated for different crosstalk levels and optical filter 
bandwidths. Then, the influence of a delay applied on the 
crosstalk signal in relation to the original signal, of different 
bits sequences on the interferer and of receiver imperfections 
on the DPSK receiver performance is studied.  
Fig. 4 shows the BEP estimates from the MC simulation 
and from the analytical formalism [4] as a function of the 
optical 
signal 
power, 
considering 
the 
ideal 
receiver 
configuration with

b
B T =  1, 10 and 100, and a crosstalk level 
equal to –12 dB. The BEPs estimated from the MC simulation, 
which are represented by the solid green line, are obtained 
assuming that the random phase noise has a uniform 
distribution with constant phase along the bit period, similarly 
to the assumption considered in the analytical work [4]. The 
other BEPs obtained using MC simulation presented in Fig. 4, 
are estimated considering that the random phase noise follows 
the Brownian motion model [7].  
Regarding the methods comparison, Fig. 4 shows that for 
smaller optical filter bandwidths, as the ISI is dominant, the 
difference between the BEPs obtained using the MC simulation 
and the analytical formalism is enhanced. For higher 
normalized optical filter bandwidths (BoTb = 10 and 100), the 
BEPs obtained using the MC simulation with the Brownian

motion assumption and in-band crosstalk are slightly 
discrepant to the analytical BEPs. This difference is attributed 
to the Brownian motion model assumed for the random phase 
noise, since when the MC simulation assumes a uniform 
distribution for the random phase noise, the simulated and 
analytical curves become very similar. Random phase noise 
with uniform distribution is a good model to describe the 
crosstalk that impairs an isolated symbol. However, this model 
loses reality for a sequence of symbols, due to the phase 
discontinuity introduced between adjacent symbols. The 
Brownian motion model provides a physical description that is 
suitable to describe the influence of random phase noise in a 
sequence of symbols, due to its temporal continuity.

Fig. 5 shows the BEPs obtained by MC simulation and 
analytically, as a function of the crosstalk level with BoTb as a 
parameter considering the ideal receiver configuration and an 
optical signal power equal to –46 dBm. Fig. 5 shows that, 
whenever the ISI influence on the performance is dominant, the 
BEPs estimated using MC simulation using both phase noise 
models are discrepant with the BEPs obtained analytically (see, 
for example, the curves corresponding to

When ISI is not relevant (

) and the crosstalk level is 
above –18 dB, there is a slight discrepancy between the 
analytical results and the MC simulation results obtained with 
the Brownian motion model. When considering the uniform 
distribution, for a high crosstalk level (above –15 dB), for 
=10

, the analytical results tend to the simulated results.  
In the remainder of this subsection, all the MC simulated 
results are obtained considering the Brownian motion model. 
In the following, the performance of the optical DPSK 
receiver is investigated considering different bits sequences on 
the DPSK crosstalk signal. Until now, the bits sequence on the 
DPSK crosstalk signal was always assumed to be random. The 
next study aims to analyze and compare the performance of the 
optical DPSK receiver when the bits sequence on the DPSK 
crosstalk signal is: 1) equal to the sequence of bits on the 
original DPSK signal; 2) the negation of the sequence of bits 
on the original DPSK signal; 3) a sequence with only bits ‘1’ 
and 4) a sequence with only bits ‘0’.

for different bits sequences on the DPSK crosstalk signal 
considering an optical signal power of –46 dBm, and the ideal

B T =  2 and 10. As shown in Fig. 
6, except for the case where the sequence of bits on the DPSK 
crosstalk signal is equal to the original DPSK signal, the BEPs 
estimated using MC simulation, when impaired by other DPSK 
crosstalk signals with different bits sequences are approximated 
to the ones obtained considering the random bits sequence. 
When the bits sequence on the DPSK crosstalk signal is equal 
to the original DPSK signal, an increase of the crosstalk level 
results in an improvement of the BEP, because as the DPSK 
crosstalk signal is added to the original signal, there is a signal 
power reinforcement.

In order to understand the influence of the bits sequences 
on the DPSK crosstalk signal, the eye diagrams of the original 
signal impaired by different bits sequences on the crosstalk 
signal are shown in Fig. 7, considering: a random bits sequence 
(left); a bits sequence equal to the original signal (middle) and 
the negated bits sequence (right). The eye diagrams are 
obtained for the ideal configuration with BoTb = 2, for  
Ps = –45 dBm and a crosstalk level of –12 dB. 
 
Figure 7. Eye diagrams at the decision circuit input, for the ideal 
configuration, BoTb = 2, an optical signal power equal to –45 dBm, a crosstalk 
level of –12 dB and considering a random bits sequence on the DPSK 
crosstalk signal (left), an equal bits sequence (middle) and the negated bits 
sequence (right). 
As can be observed in Fig. 7, it can be concluded that the 
eye pattern shows a significant enlargement in the eye opening 
when the bits sequence on the DPSK crosstalk signal is equal 
to the bits sequence of the original DPSK signal. As a 
consequence, the BEP achieved through the MC simulation, 
shown in Fig. 6 is considerably lower.  
In the next study, the influence of a delay between the 
crosstalk signal and the original signal on the optical DPSK 
receiver performance is analyzed.  
 
Figure 8. BEP as a function of the delay between the original and crosstalk 
signals, for the ideal receiver configuration with BoTb = 2, an optical signal 
power equal to –46 dBm, and a crosstalk level of –12 dB. 
Fig. 8 shows the BEP as a function of the delay between the 
original and crosstalk signals, for the ideal receiver 
configuration with BoTb = 2, for Ps = –46 dBm, and a crosstalk 
level of –12 dB. To achieve an improved accuracy, a value of 
Ne = 1000 erroneous bits is assumed in the MC simulation. Fig. 
8 shows that, the influence of the delay between the crosstalk 
signal and the original signal on the performance of the optical 
DPSK receiver is small, since the BEP variation is not much 
significant. Nevertheless, Fig. 8 shows that the best BEP is 
achieved for a delay of half the bit period, and that the BEP has 
a symmetric behavior around this point. The worst BEP is 
obtained when the crosstalk and the original signals are 
aligned, which is in agreement with the worst-case situation 
usually assumed in the literature [4].  
Afterwards, the performance of the optical DPSK receiver 
is 
analyzed 
considering 
the 
effect 
of 
two 
receiver 
imperfections: the responsivity imbalance and the DI detuning. 
The MC simulation of an optical DPSK receiver impaired by 
imperfections without in-band crosstalk has been validated by 
comparison of its estimates with the analytical results of [6].

different interferometer detunings, for the Gaussian receiver configuration

Fig. 9 depicts the power penalty as a function of the 
responsivity imbalance with different interferometer detunings, 
considering a Gaussian configuration with 
o
b
B T =  5 and a 
crosstalk level of –15 dB. The reference for the power penalty 
is obtained with no detuning, K = 0 dB and without crosstalk, 
which corresponds to a BEP of 10–3 obtained for an optical 
signal power of –46.5 dBm. Accordingly with Fig. 9, it can be 
concluded that there is a good approximation between the 
power penalties obtained using the analytical formalism and 
the MC simulation. The small differences between the 
performances might be related with the random phase noise 
models. Without imperfections, the performance degradation 
due to in-band crosstalk is about 0.9 dB (taken from the MC 
simulation results). For K = 10 dB and no detuning, the 
performance degradation is enhanced to about 1.5 dB. Fig. 9 
also shows that the performance degradation due to receiver 
imperfections is not enhanced with the crosstalk influence. 
C. Optical DPSK receiver impaired by in-band crosstalk due 
to multiple interferers 
In this subsection, the accuracy of the MC simulation is 
analyzed in presence of multiple interfering terms in the 
crosstalk signal.

power with the number of interferers as a parameter,

CONCLUSIONS 
In this work, a MC simulator has been developed to 
evaluate the impact of in-band crosstalk in an optically pre-
amplified DPSK direct detection receiver and to study the 
validity range and the limitations of the analytical work 
proposed in [4]. This study has been performed for the scenario 
without in-band crosstalk and for the scenario with in-band 
crosstalk originated from multiple interferers.  
It was shown that when the ISI plays a key role as the 
dominant source of performance degradation, for BoTb < 2, the 
BEPs predicted by the analytical work became very discrepant 
from the ones obtained with MC simulation. As a rule of 
thumb,

provides a good bound for the normalized 
optical filter bandwidth, where the accuracy of the analytical 
work is still guaranteed. In presence of in-band crosstalk, it was 
concluded that even for large optical filter bandwidths, a slight 
discrepancy is observed between the BEPs obtained using both 
formalisms due to the fact that the analytical formalism 
considers that random phase noise has a uniform distribution 
constant over the bit period, whereas the MC simulation 
assumes a Brownian motion model for the random phase noise. 
It was also shown that a delay applied in the crosstalk signal (in 
relation to the original signal) does not have a relevant 
influence on the DPSK receiver performance. Furthermore, it 
was shown that, a DPSK crosstalk bits sequence equal to the 
original bits sequence leads to a performance improvement due 
to signal power reinforcement. We have also observed that, the 
performance degradation due to DPSK receiver imperfections 
is not enhanced with the presence of crosstalk.  
The influence of multiple interfering terms on the DPSK 
receiver performance was also analyzed, and it was seen that, 
with the increase of the optical signal power, the performance 
degradation induced by a higher number of interfering terms is 
enhanced. The discrepancies between analytical and simulated 
results, found for multiple interfering terms are similar to the 
ones obtained with one single interfering term.
