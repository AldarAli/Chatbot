Abstract-Nowadays, user is provided with many contents, 
which the previous search engines failed to find, thanks to 
various recommendation systems. These recommendation 
algorithms are usually carried out using collaborating 
filtering algorithm, which predicts user’s preference, or 
contents based algorithm, which calculates on the basis of the 
similarity between contents. In addition to the above 
algorithms, many algorithms using user’s context have been 
recently developed. Based on the previous researches, this 
paper proposes a new system to categorize contents 
information into various factors and learn user’s selection. 
First, we divide information of items into four types and make 
user preference pattern using each information type. The 
information types can express more various user preferences 
and user preference pattern can calmly deal with user preference. 
Then, we calculate the score for recommendation using user 
preference pattern. That is, our system is constructed on 
these three modules: item analyzing module, user pattern 
analyzing module and recommendation score module. Lastly, 
we provide entire system flow to show how they work.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
 
With the help of recommendation systems, people can 
access a wider range of contents, which was not possible 
with the old search engines. For example, when we listen to 
music or buy contents like DVD titles, books, and laptops, 
the recommendation systems provide a rich selection of 
items to aid our decisions. With the growth of the Internet 
society, web systems are now capable of managing and 
processing 
a 
large 
amount 
of 
information. 
The 
recommendation 
systems 
provide 
more 
intelligent 
information considering the user’s preferences. Google 
search engine and Amazon recommendation systems are 
well-known examples. 
The recommended items’ properties, the user’s 
properties, and the user’s current context are the 
fundamentals of the recommendation systems [1]. In the 
case of movie recommendations, the movie properties 
include genre, title, and cast. These properties are used to 
calculate the similarity between the movies. The user 
properties include the user’s favorite genre, actors, and/or 
directors. For example, if a user likes action movies, the 
recommendation system will include more action movies in 
the recommended set. The recommendation system sets the 
basic direction based on items’ properties and user’s 
properties of information [2]. The user context information 
represents the environment the user’s in, which highly 
influences the user’s decisions [3, 4]. For instance, people 
prefer to watch scary movies in the summer than in the 
winter. The recommendation system can provide better 
recommendations taking the user’s context information into 
consideration. 
Many 
different 
algorithms 
and 
effective 
recommendation systems have used items’ properties, 
user’s properties and user’s current context of information. 
Collaborative filtering is the most popular recommendation 
algorithm used in many recommendation systems [5]. This 
algorithm predicts the user’s interests based on the user’s 
preferences from the past. Many researchers tried to 
improve the algorithm using different approaches. The 
modified algorithms take the user’s temporal context or 
genre preferences into consideration. This paper proposes 
an analysis method to categorize the information types and 
a learning algorithm to predict the user’s item preferences 
based on the three information types mentioned above. 
In Section II, we check the previous researches on 
recommendation systems using properties and learning 
algorithms. In Section III, we propose a new method of 
analyzing 
contents 
and 
present 
our 
recommended 
architecture. Then, in Section IV, we show how our system 
works using the system flowchart. Finally, the conclusion 
is given in Section V

RELATED WORK 
 
A recommendation system compares a user profile with 
some reference characteristics and seeks to predict the 
rating or preference that a user would give to an item that 
they had not yet considered. There are lots of 
recommendation 
algorithms. 
One 
of 
them 
is 
the 
recommendation system based on the contents properties.

This system calculates a similarity between items and 
suggests contents to user using this calculated similarity. 
Another approach is learning algorithm. The learning 
algorithm analyzes the user pattern when user selects 
contents and applies these analyzed results to the 
recommendation. 
Our system is based on contents properties and learning 
algorithm for user preference. 
 
A. A recommendation system based on contents properties 
 
A recommendation system based on contents properties 
consists of three steps. The first step is to calculate the 
correlation coefficient using contents preferences. The 
second step is to choose neighbors of content A selected by 
user. Neighbors mean a group of contents that have similar 
rating with content A. The third step is to estimate the 
preference for contents based on the neighbors ratings. The 
detailed explanation is given in the followings. 
 
- 
Calculating the correlation coefficient 
 
To calculate the correlation coefficient of the contents 
selected by user, we use Equation (1) Pearson correlation 
coefficient [6, 7, 8]: 
 
 
    
    
         
∑     ̅      ̅ 
√∑     ̅   √∑     ̅       , (1) 
where 
- 
X is a content. 
- 
 ̅ is the average rating of X. 
- 
Xi denotes the rating of the ith  user for X. 
- 
Y is all the other contents 
- 
 ̅ is the average rating of Y 
- 
Yi denotes the rating of the  ith  user for Y. 
- 
ρxy is the Pearson correlation coefficient between 
X and the other contents Y. 
 
- 
Selecting neighbors 
 
In this step, neighbors are chosen using the results of 
Equation (1). A certain correlation coefficient value close 
to 1 is first selected as a threshold and contents with a 
correlation coefficient value greater than this threshold are 
selected as neighbors. 
 
- 
Predicting preferences 
 
The final step is to predict preferences based on the 
ratings of neighbors. This step uses Equation (2): 
 
 
   ̅  
∑
                 
∑
             
       , (2) 
where 
- 
 ̅ is the average rating of content X. 
- 
 Yi is the rating of the ith item by other users. 
- 
 Y is the average the rating of the given content by 
the neighbors of X. 
- 
ρxy is the Pearson correlation coefficient between 
X and the other contents Y. 
- 
 raters are a set of contents which have ratings.  
- 
 P is the predicted value of contents for a specific 
user. 
 
B. Learning algorithm 
 
Machine learning is concerned with the development of 
algorithms allowing the machine to learn via inductive 
inference [9]. This inductive inference is based on 
observation data that represents incomplete information 
about statistical phenomenon. One of machine learning 
systems attempts to eliminate the need for human intuition 
in data analysis while others adopt a collaborative approach 
between human and machine. In our approach, we use 
association rules for the learning method. 
 
- 
 Association rule learning  
 
Association rule learning is a popular and well known 
method for discovering interesting relations between 
variables in a large database [10]. Many algorithms for 
generating association rules were presented over time. 
Some well-known algorithms are Apriori, Eclat and FP-
Growth, but they only do half the job, since they are 
algorithms for mining frequent item-sets. Another step 
needs to be done after to generate rules from frequent item-
sets found in a database [11]. Association rules are usually 
required to satisfy a user-specified minimum support and a 
user-specified minimum confidence at the same time. 
 Association rule learning divides into two separate 
steps. In the first step, minimum support is applied to find 
all frequent item sets in a database. In the second  step, 
these  frequent  item sets   and   the minimum  confidence  
constraint  are  used  to  form  rules. Finding all frequent 
item sets in a database is difficult because it involves 
searching all possible item set.  
 
III. 
OUR APPROACH 
 
Users, generally, selects contents on the basis of a 
variety of information. For example, if a user selects movie 
Scream, we assume that user likes horror genre or series. 
Thus, analyzing the user selections can help to predict user 
preference.  
According to Korean Film Council (KOFIC) [12] 
survey, user considers genre, rating and casts when he/she 
chooses a movie. Table I shows the values that user 
considers when he/she selects movie. 
We suggest a new classification method of the factors 
of items. We divide information of items into four types, 
basic information, create information, property information, 
related information. Then, we make user preference pattern 
252

using each information type and calculate the score for 
recommendation using user preference pattern. Therefore, 
our system is composed of these three modules: item 
analyzing module, user pattern analyzing module and 
recommendation score module. 
 
A. Item Analyzing Module 
 
In item analyzing module, we first analyze properties of 
items. Then, we classify those analyzed factors by 
information  types. 
 
- 
Basic 
information is associated 
with basic 
information for items. Basic information includes 
three factors of item such as year, cast, country. 
 
- 
Create information is associated with information 
of the production. Create information includes three 
factors of item such as creator, director, producer. 
 
- 
Property information is associated with properties 
of items. Property information includes three factors 
of item genre, keyword, episodes. 
 
- 
Related information is associated with information 
related with items. Related information includes 
three factors of item awards, top250, soundtrack.  
 
B. User Pattern Aanalyzing Module 
 
This module produces user preference pattern using the 
result of item analyzing module. User preference pattern is 
the configuration of individual weights on the given 
information type. Each information types have two patterns, 
short-term preference pattern and long-term preference 
pattern. 
Short-term Preference Pattern (SPP) is the most basic 
pattern to define relation between items and user 
preferences. Preferences for items are defined by common 
factors between criterion item and compared item. SPP is 
calculated by each information type. Thus, the pattern has a 
total of four types, basic information pattern, create 
information pattern, property information pattern and 
related information pattern. These four patterns are used to 
calculate long-term pattern (LPP). Equation (3) shows how 
to draw the SPP. 
 
    
      
∑              , (3) 
where 
- 
SPP is Short-term preference pattern. 
- 
A is criterion item, B is compared item. 
- 
i is the selection number of compared item. 
 
Long-term Preference Pattern (LPP) represents learned 
preferences of user. It is configured about each information 
type and is determined by the average of the weights used in 
the past and short-term preference pattern of a selected item. 
Equation (4) shows how to draw the LPP. 
 
     
             
 
      , (4) 
 
 where 
- 
LPP is long-term preference pattern 
- 
i is the selection number of compared item. 
 
C. Recommendation Score Module 
 
The recommendation score module calculates the 
prediction score of items. It is value to determine 
recommendation item. Equation (5) shows how to compute 
the recommendation score. 
 
    ∑               , (5) 
where  
- 
RS is recommendation score. 
- 
i is item number. 
- 
Rating i is rating on item i.  
 
IV. 
SYSTEM FLOW 
 
Our whole system uses values gained from SPP, LPP, 
and RS in Section III.   Its system flow has two steps, 
shown in Figure 1. 
 
 
Figure 1. System flow 
In Step 1, when user puts the title of item into the 
system, item analyzing module analyzes it based on 
information type. Then, analyzed data are compared with 
other data. The system has three small steps. First, the 
system analyzes the properties of compared item. Secondly, 
it makes short-term preference pattern. Thirdly, the system 
compares between the compared item and input data to 
calculate recommendation score with the weights put on 
each information type.  Lastly, the system provides a 
recommendation list for user. For example, if user inputs 
the title Harry Potter, our item query module classifies its 
information, such as the genre Fantasy and cast Emma 
Watson. After classifying information of the item, user 
253

pattern analyzing module compares common information 
factors between Harry Potter and other movies and makes 
user preference pattern for recommendation. Through all 
these process, the system makes recommendation score and 
suggests a recommendation list. If the score is high in 
Property information type, then it recommends other 
Fantasy genre movies like The Chronicles of Narnia. Or if 
it is high on Basic information, it suggests Emma Watson’s 
other movies. 
In the Step 2, user pattern analyzing module operates 
right after user selects an item. First, it makes long term 
preference pattern comparing the weights of selected item 
and the weights in user profile. Here, the selected item 
becomes user input data. Ending this process, the system 
restarts step 1. In the Harry Potter case, if user selects The 
Chronicles of Narnia, then user’s property information 
weight increases and a next recommendation list has more 
contents related to the genre Fantasy or key word wizard. 
 
V. 
CONCUSION AND FUTHURE WORKS  
 
For effective recommendation, we have suggested a 
new classification and learning method. Using the new 
classification method, we have divided information of item 
into four types. Analyzed information types can express 
more various user preferences. We also have made user 
preference pattern. It is learned to follow up preference of 
user whenever he/she selects an item. Thus, our system has 
possibility to recommend items to user more precisely than 
other systems because we use more information in items 
and history of user pattern. 
In future works, we aim to test our system using large 
size of database such as IMDB and to verify our algorithm. 
And we will also expand our algorithm using user context. 
For example, we can check user preference variation over 
time or user’s feeling.
