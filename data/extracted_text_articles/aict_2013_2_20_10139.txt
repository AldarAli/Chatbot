Abstract —The expressions for joint probability density 
function (PDF) of the Switch and Stay Combiner (SSC) output 
signal at two time instants in the presence of Weibull fading 
are determined in the closed form. Then, in this paper, these 
equations are used for calculation of the outage probability 
and amount of fading for complex Switch and Stay 
Combining/Maximal Ratio Combining (SSC/MRC) combiner 
versus different parameter values. The results are shown 
graphically in some figures and the analysis of the parameters 
influence and different types of combiners is given.

 INTRODUCTION 
In wireless communication, the main causes of signal 
degradations are random fluctuations of signal envelope and 
phase, which are caused by multipath scattering (fast fading) 
and shadowing (slow fading) [1]. The multipath fading is 
modeled by several distributions such as: Rayleigh, Rice, 
Nakagami-m, The Hoyt (Nakagami-q), Weibull.  
The Weibull fading, named after Waloddi Weibull, is a 
simple statistical model of fading, is based on the Weibull 
distribution and used in wireless communications [2]-[4], 
particularly with mobile radio systems operating in the 
800/900 MHz frequency range [5].  Empirical studies have 
shown it to be an effective model in both indoor [5] and 
outdoor [6] environments. 
Theoretical model for a particular class of Weibull 
distributions was described by Sagias and Karagiannidis 
[7]. Also, they analyzed the channel capacity of wireless 
channels in the presence of Weibull fading [8].  
Various techniques for reducing fading and shadow 
effects are used in wireless communication systems. They 
are diversity reception, dynamic channel allocation and 
power control. Upgrading transmission reliability and 
increasing channel capacity without increasing transmission 
power and bandwidth is the main goal of diversity 
techniques. 
Multiple received copies of signal could be combined in 
different ways. Among the most popular are maximal ratio 
combining (MRC) and equal gain combining (EGC) [9]-
[11]. Their complexity of implementation is relatively high 
since they require a separate channel for each diversity 
branch. Selection combining (SC) and switch and stay 
combining (SSC) are simpler diversity combining models, 
because they process only one from L diversity branches. 
SSC combiner usually chooses between two receiving 
antennas based on comparation of the signal value or SNR 
of connected antenna with previously determined threshold. 
This is reflected in less complexity toward SC combiner and 
it is not necessarily at the same time continued to monitor 
the two antennas. Because of that there is some loss in 
performances.  
The probability density function (PDF) of the SSC 
combiner output signal at one time instant and the joint 
probability density function of the SSC combiner output 
signal at two time instants in the presence of Weibull fading 
are determined in [12].  
The authors showed that the error probability and the 
outage probability are significantly reduced if the decision is 
performed in two time instants. The analysis of the complex 
SSC/SC combiner over outage probability at two time 
instants in the presence of Rayleigh and log-normal fading 
is done in [13] [14] and the bit error rate for complex 
SSC/MRC combiner at two time instants in the presence of 
Rayleigh, Nakagami-m, Hoyt and log-normal fading is done 
in [15]-[18], respectively. 
The bit error rate for complex SSC/MRC combiner at 
two time instants in the presence of Weibull fading will be 
given in this paper since Weibull fading has great 
importance in the study of telecommunications systems. 
This investigation could be useful for designers of wireless 
telecommunication systems.

This paper is organized as follows: after Introduction, 
Section II introduces the model of complex combiner which 
performances will be considered in the next section. In 
Section III, the joint PDF of the SSC combiner output SNR 
at two time instants is calculated. Subsequently, in fourth 
Section the outage probability and amount of fading for 
complex Switch and Stay Combining/Maximal Ratio 
Combining (SSC/MRC) combiner are calculated and then in 
the fifth Section the numerical results are presented 
graphically. Final part of this paper is conclusion with an 
analysis of the obtained results. 
II. 
SYSTEM MODEL  
The complex SSC/MRC combiner, considered in this 
paper, is presented in Fig. 1. The complex combiner is with 
two inputs, at two time instants. The SSC combiner output 
signals are the input signals for MRC combiner. 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Model of complex combiner  
 
At the inputs of the first part of complex combiner the 
signals are r11 and r21 at first time moment and they are r12 
and r22 at second time moment. The first index represents the 
branch ordinal number and the other one signs the time 
instant observed. 
The output signals from SSC part of complex combiner 
are r1 and r2. The indices at the output signal correspond to 
the time instants considered. These signals, r1 and r2, are the 
inputs for the MRC combiner. Finally, the overall output 
signal is r. 
III. 
PERFORMANCE DERIVATION 
The joint probability density function of correlated 
signals r1 and r2 at the SSC combiner output, at two time 
instants, Weibull distributed and with same parameters Ωi 
and βi  [19], can be obtained in closed form from expressions 
in [12, eq. (15)-(18)] as

OUTAGE PROBABILITY AND AMOUNT OF FADING 
The outage probability is a very useful performance 
measure for diversity systems operating in fading 
environments. The outage probability is defined as the 
probability that the combiner output signal value falls below 
a given threshold rth, also known as a protection ratio. The 
outage probability

Amount of fading (AF) is a unified measure of the 
severity of fading for particular channel model and is 
typically independent of the average fading power, but is 
dependent of the instantaneous SNR. Amount of fading for

and correlation parameters, are presented in Figs. 2 and 3.

The family of curves for the outage probabilities is given 
in Fig. 2 for four different cases: 1) one channel receiver, 2) 
MRC combiner at one time instant, 3) SSC/MRC combiner 
at two time instants for uncorrelated case and 4) SSC/MRC 
combiner at two time instants for very strong correlation. 
 
 
Figure 2. Outage probability for different types of combiners for 
parameters β=0.7 and Ω=0.5 
One can see from this figure that SSC/MRC combiner 
has significant better performance for both, uncorrelated 
case and for completely correlated signals (ρ =1), regarding 
classical MRC combiner at one time instant and one single 
channel receiver. 
The outage probability curves for SSC/MRC combiner, 
for different values of correlation coefficient ρ, are 
presented in Fig. 3.  
 
 
Figure 3. Outage probability for SSC/MRC combiner for parameters β=0.7 
and Ω=0.5 and for different values of correlation coefficient ρ 
It can be seen from Fig. 3 that SSC/MRC combiner has 
better performance for uncorrelated signals. 
The amount of fading for one channel receiver, for MRC 
combiner at one time instant and for SSC/MRC combiner at 
two time instants, for uncorrelated case and for very strong 
correlation, is shown in Fig. 4. 
It can be seen from Fig. 4 that SSC/MRC combiner has, 
once again, the best performance for uncorrelated case then 
the other combiners. The worst case is the case with one 
channel, i.e., without diversity combining at all. 
 
 
Figure 4. Amount of fading for different types of combiners for Ω=0.5 
One can conclude from these figures that complex 
SSC/MRC 
combiner 
has 
better 
performance 
for 
uncorrelated case then MRC combiner at one time instant. 
For the value of correlation coefficient ρ = 1, the results of 
complex SSC/MRC combiner follows the results for MRC 
combiner. It is evident that usage of this complex SSC/MRC 
combiner gives better performance in the entire range, 
except in the case of strongly correlated signals. In this 
situaton it is not economic to use complex combiner. Thus, 
the advantages of utilization such type of complex combiner 
increases with decreasing of correlation between input 
signals. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION  
In diversity systems, SSC and MRC combining are often 
used techniques for combining signals. The performance of 
systems which make decision by two samples could be 
determined by the joint probability density function of SSC 
combiner output signals at two time instants. Then, they are 
involved in MRC combiner. Here, the joint PDF of 
SSC/MRC combiner output signal at two time instants in 
the presence of Weibull fading, derived earlier in closed 
form expressions, is used for outage probability and amount 
of fading determination. 
The results are presented in some figures versus 
different parameters. It is evident that system performance is 
upgraded by use the mannerism of this complex combiner 
and sampling at two time moments. Obtained results are 
better compared with classical SSC and MRC combiners

except for very strong correlation between signals. In that 
case the performance curves for complex combiner and 
MRC combiner are coinciding.
