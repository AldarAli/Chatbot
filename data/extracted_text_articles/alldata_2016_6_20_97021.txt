Abstract— In this article, we will analyze the effect of different 
retirement satisfaction predictors on each other and the 
retirement satisfaction level among men and women. The 
following factors will be used as predicators of retirement 
satisfaction: health; wealth; smoking and drinking habits; 
education; faith; income; impact of health on activities of daily 
living (ADL); frequency of activities; and the number of people 
in a household. A set of 858 retired men and 1179 retired women 
from a 2012 Health and Retirement Study database have been 
chosen and analyzed. A neural network was trained for each 
gender in order to predict retirement satisfaction; it also 
generated a decision tree that symbolizes the retirement 
satisfaction and its predictors. The results demonstrate that 
health, age, smoking habits, income, and wealth are the most 
significant predictors for both genders, while for men, education 
also plays an important role in retirement satisfaction.

 INTRODUCTION 
As the population of retired people is growing, retirement 
satisfaction has become a significant issue in aging and 
retirement research. It is predicted that around 24 percent of 
the United States' work force in 2018 will be at least 55 years 
old [1]. In addition to positive changes in lifestyle, 
retirement—as a major alteration in life for the elderly—can 
be the source of many negative experiences, such as 
loneliness, anxiety, and sometimes even psychological 
disorders [2].  
There is a large body of research on factors which may 
have an effect on retirement satisfaction—among which 
health and wealth, as the two most important predictors, have 
been shown to have a positive correlation with this kind of 
satisfaction [3-8]. A positive psychological condition is also 
shown to have a positive correlation with retirement 
satisfaction [6].  
Sexuality is also another analyzed factor in literature. 
Although there are many studies focusing only on men or 
women in terms of retirement satisfaction, the studies show 
that there is no significant difference among men and women 
in this category [6, 9-15]. 
Voluntary retirement, engagement in social activities, 
higher educational level, and having a spousal partner also can 
have a positive effect on retirement satisfaction [8, 12, 15-21].   
Although the retirement satisfaction factors have been 
analyzed extensively in literature, the inter-relational effect of 
these factors remains an unchallenged problem. For example, 
we know that wealth and health have a positive correlation 
with retirement satisfaction [5], but how will a high level of 
wealth and a low level of health affect retirement satisfaction 
simultaneously? Additionally, what level of each factor is the 
threshold at which retirement satisfaction may be altered? 
In this paper, using the data of 858 retired men and 1179 
retired women from the 2012 Health and Retirement Study 
database, we predict the retirement satisfaction level as a 
dependent variable and the health, wealth, smoking and 
drinking habits, education, faith, income, impact of health on 
instrumental and regular ADLs, frequency of activities, and 
number of people in a household as independent variables by 
using a multi-layer perceptron neural network. We then try to 
illustrate the effect of different levels of independent variables 
on retirement satisfaction simultaneously by using a decision 
tree for both men and women.      
In Section 2, we explain the method and data we use for 
analysis. In Section 3, the results of analyzing retirement 
satisfaction as an outcome of predictor variables are presented 
for both men and women. In Section 4, the overall conclusion 
is stated.

DATA AND METHODOLOGY 
A. Health and Retirement Study 
The data for this research came from the 2012 Health and 
Retirement Study (HRS), which was launched in 1992. The 
total number of randomly considered retired people chosen 
from HRS for this study was 2037, which consisted of 858 
men and 1179 women. Notice that only the respondents with 
no missing values in both dependent and independent 
variables were considered in this study. 
The dependent variable is considered to be retirement 
satisfaction. If a person is reported to be retired in 2012 he/she 
is asked the G136 question, “All in all, would you say that 
your retirement has turned out to be very satisfying, 
moderately satisfying, or not at all satisfying?" The answer to 
this question is supposed to capture the retirement satisfaction 
level for retirees. 
The independent variables in this research are the age (in 
months); years of education; belief in a higher power; self-
report of health (based on a 5-point scale in which 1 shows

excellent health and 5 shows very poor health); a binary 
variable which shows if the health limits the ability to work or 
not; level of difficulty in pursuing the ADLs (based on a 6-
point scale in which 0 shows no difficulty and 5 shows 
someone is unable to perform ADL); mental health (based on 
a 9-point scale in which 0 is excellent and 8 is very poor); a 
set of binary variables that show if the person has blood 
pressure, diabetes, cancer, lung disease, heart problem and/or 
arthritis; frequency of vigorous, moderate, and light activity; 
a binary variable that shows if the person smokes or not; the 
number of alcoholic drinks consumed per week; wealth; 
income; and the number of people living in a household. 
B. Methodology 
In this research for modeling retirement satisfaction and 
other independent variables, we use a multi-layer feed forward 
neural network. For illustrating this relationship in a symbolic 
structure, we will use a decision tree technique proposed by 
Craven [22] and modified by Young [23]. 
1) Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) 
ANNs are mathematical models that mimic the human 
brain. Besides being considered a “black-box” model, ANNs 
also have the limitation of requiring a large amount of training 
and cross-validation data, i.e., typically three times more 
training samples than network weights [24]. However, a 
systematic way of modelling complex non-linear patterns is 
proposed [25]. Since their resurgence in the 1980s, ANNs 
have been applied to a variety of problem domains such as 
speech recognition [26] and generation [27], symbolic 
learning [28], robotic design [29], medical diagnostics [30], 
game playing [31], healthcare systems [32], bankruptcy [33], 
credit cards [34], and estimation of functions as in forecasting 
[35-37]. Theoretically, it is possible to prove that a three-
layered NN can estimate the value of a function with desirable 
accuracy [38, 39]. Since the relationship of retirement 
satisfaction and other independent variables is not necessarily 
linear and can be considered highly complex, feed forward 
neural networks can be a useful tool for predicting the value 
of retirement satisfaction.  
There are many types of ANN topologies that have been 
comprehensively documented [40], and they range in their use 
and complexity.  One of the most widely used neural networks 
(NN) is the feed forward neural network (FNN). For example, 
Figure 1 shows the general structure of a FNN. The network 
shown is fully connected, since each layer is connected via 
previous layers. The first hidden layer’s neurons are 
connected to the second hidden layer’s, and the second hidden 
layer’s neurons are connected with all of the output layer’s 
neurons. 
There are two main paradigms of ANN training--
supervised and unsupervised learning. The primary difference 
between the two learning schemes is that in supervised 
learning, known outputs, or--“targets”--are used to adjust the 
network’s weights. In unsupervised learning, there is not a 
known output, and the method functions as a clustering 
algorithm.

2) Decision trees and TREPAN 
One of the main drawbacks of neural networks is the lack 
of explanation capability [42]. In order to represent the 
knowledge about retirement satisfaction learned by a neural 
network, we use decision trees. Decision trees classify data 
through recursive partitioning of the dataset into mutually 
exclusive subsets [43], which best explain the variation in the 
dependent variable under observation [44]. A decision tree 
model consists of logical tests, which result in possible 
classifying consequences. Decision trees have been used to 
aid decision makers in many real-world problems. For 
example, Leech [45] applied a decision tree to a chemical 
nuclear power plant process involving continuous feedback 
systems. Another use led a manufacturing company to reduce 
inventory levels and improve processing efficiencies, which 
saved the company ten million dollars in operation expenses 
a year [46].  
TREPAN is a novel rule-extraction algorithm [47] that 
utilizes the behavior of a trained ANN. Given a trained ANN, 
TREPAN extracts decision trees that provide a close 
approximation to the function represented by the network 
when there are issues of accurately calculating tree partitions, 
which are caused by limited sample sizes. TREPAN uses a 
concept of recursive partitioning similar to other decision tree 
algorithms; however, in contrast to the depth-first growth used 
by other decision tree algorithms, TREPAN expands using the 
“best first” principle. For conventional induction algorithms, 
the amount of training data decreases as a decision tree grows. 
Thus, there is less data at the bottom of the tree able to 
determine class labels accurately. In contrast, TREPAN uses 
an “oracle” to answer queries that determine decision tree 
splits better when sample instances are limited. One important 
aspect of this feature is the user-determined parameter called 
minimum sample. TREPAN ensures that splits are determined 
with a minimum number of sample instances. If the number 
of instances at a particular node, m, is less than the minimum 
sample allowed, TREPAN will make membership queries 
equal to the minimum sample from the ANN oracle in order 
to artificially create sample instances to meet the minimum 
sample requirement.  
TREPAN uses an entropy-based criterion called 
“information gain” to determine the best position in which to 
103

partition the dataset. TREPAN uses M-of-N expressions as it 
splits upon the dataset. In this case, N rules are created. The 
algorithm also determines a value for M, which represents the 
minimum conditions that must be met, which in turn dictates 
the preceding node or final classification. This approach 
allows multiple features to be present in one node. To prevent 
testing of all the possible M-of-N combinations, TREPAN 
makes use of the heuristic “beam search” process. This 
process begins by selecting the best binary split at a given 
node based upon information gain. Additional splitting 
conditions are determined based on the initial rule’s 
“complement” [48]. 
When sample instances are sparse, TREPAN interacts 
with an ANN oracle by means of membership queries. The 
goal of a membership query is to determine a new instance 
among a group of instances. To create appropriate sample 
instances, distributions of attribute values are created that 
conform to the decision tree constraints [49]. Once the ranges 
are determined, random pulls are made from the attributes’ 
distribution in order for the oracle to accurately estimate the 
classification output label. 
3) Retirement Satisfaction Model 
For this study, we train a feed forward neural network with 
two hidden layers. There are 15 processing units in the first 
layer and 10 processing units in the second hidden layer, as 
well as tangent hyperbolic and linear transfer functions for the 
hidden and output layers, respectively, that use back 
propagation algorithms in NeuroSolutions 6.20 software. The 
output of the network, i.e., retirement satisfaction – is a 
continuous number. In order to convert the output of the 
network into the categorical scale of retirement satisfaction, 
we divide the output into three categories of (-∞,1.66], 
(1.66,2.33], and (2.33,+∞], which are equivalent to not 
satisfying, moderately satisfying, and very satisfying. Notice 
that in the data we use the numbers 1, 2, and 3 to represent 
satisfying, moderately satisfying, and very satisfying, 
respectively. 
III. 
RESULTS 
Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the decision tree obtained for 
men and women regarding the relationships of the 
independent variables and retirement satisfaction. Notice that 
every rectangular shape in the decision tree shows a condition 
that, if met, the right branch should be followed. The left 
branch is for the case in which the condition is rejected. The 
oval shapes show the consecutive retirement satisfaction level 
in each branch. 
As it is depicted in Figures 2 and 3, not all of the variables 
are involved in predicting retirement satisfaction. The reason 
is partially because of the low correlation of some independent 
variables and retirement satisfaction, as well as the 
overwhelming impact of these important variables on the 
latter that makes the other factors neutral. Another reason is 
the structure of the decision tree itself. By generating a 
decision tree, we are trying to extract the knowledge of the 
neural network, and the generated tree is formed in a way to 
represent the most possible knowledge in the form of rules 
according to the neural network, which can cause us to ignore 
some of the inputs. 
A. Comparison with Literature 
All of the extracted rules in decision trees are consistent 
with the results in literature. Age has a positive correlation 
with retirement satisfaction [3]. This effect can be seen by 
following branches that point to older ages and comparing 
them to the other branches in Figures 2 and 3. High levels of 
mental and physical health correspond to higher retirement 
satisfaction [3, 4, 6-8]. Higher levels of wealth and income 
also correspond to higher retirement satisfaction [3, 5-7]. 
Years of education have a positive correlation with retirement 
satisfaction [20]. 
B. New Findings 
In addition to the result comparisons to previous literature, 
some new patterns can be deduced from the decision tree. 
Compared to women, the years spent in education for men is 
an important factor. In Figure 2, one of the parameters that 
affects the retirement satisfaction in men is education level. 
However, in Figure 3 the education level is not a condition in 
defining the retirement satisfaction, which shows that for 
women, it is not an important parameter. 
Since for men the wealth appears in higher levels of the 
decision tree, it follows that, compared to women, wealth for 
men is a more important factor. Following the same logic, we 
can see that compared to men, mental health is a stronger 
predictor for women. In addition, for women with poor health, 
wealth is not a predictor at all. Despite this, for men with poor 
overall health, age cannot predict the retirement satisfaction.  
Among all the health conditions analyzed, only diabetes 
plays a significant role in explaining retirement satisfaction. 
In both decision trees, i.e., men’s and women’s – having 
diabetes can cause lower retirement satisfaction, except where 
the income level is rather high. Although poor conditions of 
physical and mental health for both men and women can cause 
low retirement satisfaction, a high amount of wealth and 
income can ameliorate this situation.  
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, using the 2012 data of the Health and 
Retirement Study for 858 retired men and 1179 retired 
women, we trained a feed forward neural network to predict 
the retirement satisfaction, considering health, wealth, 
smoking and drinking habits, education, faith, income, impact 
of health on ADLs, frequency of activities, and the number of 
people in a household as independent variables. The 
knowledge of neural networks was represented in the form of 
a decision tree. 
The results show a very high consistency with previous 
findings in literature. Additionally, some new knowledge 
regarding retirement satisfaction was also revealed in the form 
of rules in the decision tree. It was shown that, compared to 
men, years of education is more important to women in 
regards to retirement satisfaction. Under the condition of poor 
health, age is an important predictor of retirement satisfaction 
for women. Among all the health-related diseases, diabetes 
plays the most important role in terms of predicting retirement

satisfaction. Additionally, a poor health condition can be 
negated by higher income or wealth. 
To the best of our knowledge, the use of decision trees in 
retirement satisfaction is introduced for the very first time in 
this article. The results show that this technique can be a very 
powerful method for revealing hidden relationships between 
the various predictors of retirement satisfaction.
