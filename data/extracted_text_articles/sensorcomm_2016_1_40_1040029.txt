Abstract—The state-of-the-art video-coding standard is High 
Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), which achieves significant 
compression performance relative to H.264/AVC. HEVC is 
designed for lossy compression, however, and it is not ideal for 
lossless 
compression. 
To 
overcome 
the 
limitations 
of 
conventional coding in HEVC, we focus on the improvement of 
entropy coding for lossless compression. In this method, 
entropy coding is modified based on the characteristics of 
residuals in a lossless environment. The experimental results 
show that the bit savings of the proposed entropy coding is 
1.46% on average when compared to HEVC lossless coding. 
Modified entropy coding with block-based intra prediction 
shows a bit savings of 7.99% on average. We observe that the 
combination of intra prediction and entropy coding is effective 
in screen-contents sequences.

 INTRODUCTION 
 
High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) is a state-of-the-
art video-coding standard that outperforms other standards in 
several 
ways. 
HEVC 
aims 
to 
achieve 
significant 
compression improvements in the range of 50% output bit-
rate reduction while still offering the same subjective quality 
as 
the previous 
video-coding 
standard, H.264/AVC 
(Advanced Video Coding). HEVC has been widely exploited 
for many uses, including in tablets, mobile phones, and high-
definition televisions [1-3]. 
Lossy and lossless compression are two major classes of 
compression [4]. When compared with an original image, 
some data loss in the reconstructed image is allowed for in 
lossy compression. In lossless compression, in contrast, the 
reconstructed image is identical to the original image. 
Although 
HEVC 
supports both 
lossy 
and lossless 
compression, most of the coding techniques that are used in 
HEVC were designed for the improvement of coding 
performance in lossy compression. It is thus difficult to 
improve on the performance of lossless compression in the 
current HEVC structure.  
Since lossless compression bypasses the transform, 
quantization, and in-loop filtering processes such as de-
blocking filter and sample adaptive offset (SAO), the 
remaining processes are prediction and entropy coding, as 
shown in Fig. 1. The roles of prediction and entropy coding 
are therefore key for achieving higher compression. Intra 
prediction can be divided into block-based prediction and 
pixel-based prediction. Since the reconstructed image is 
identical to the original image, pixel-based prediction is 
generally more effective than block-based prediction, 
although pixel-based prediction may cause harmony-related 
problems with block-based structures in HEVC.

Entropy coding in HEVC focuses on the efficient coding 
of the coefficients that occur in lossy compression 
environments. The coefficients in lossless compression 
environments have different statistical characteristics than 
those in lossy compression environments. Considering the 
statistical characteristics of lossless compression, several 
researchers have proposed modifications related to entropy 
coding [5-7]. 
This paper focuses on the improvement of compression 
performance. For the prediction setup, a block-based scheme 
was considered as the intra prediction in this work. In the 
case of entropy coding, the level coding setup was modified 
based on the characteristic of the coefficient in a lossless 
compression environment. When intra prediction and 
entropy coding are combined to maximize compression 
performance, some compression improvement can be 
expected. In this paper, a block-based intra prediction 
method based on differential pulse-code modulation 
(DPCM) and several modifications of entropy coding have 
been combined and tested experimentally. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2 explains related work related to the proposed 
algorithm; Section 3 provides the proposed method for the 
entropy-coding process in a lossless coding environment. 
Section 4 includes an experimental evaluation, and Section 5 
offers conclusions on the work.

RELATED WORK 
A. Block-based Intra Prediction 
 
In the case of block-based prediction, reference pixels 
that are located farther away than neighboring pixels may be 
used for prediction. In terms of prediction accuracy, block-
based prediction may be reduced because of the block-based 
structure. In order to solve this problem, several studies on 
applying DPCM to the residual signals have been conducted; 
the output of these studies is based on “residual DPCM,” or 
RDPCM [8-12]. While RDPCM is used to apply DPCM on 
the residuals to ensure pixel-based performance, it is also 
possible to maintain a block-based structure. 
When intra prediction in HEVC is applied, the prediction 
pixels can be obtained from the reference pixels. We may 
then acquire differences between the original pixels and the 
prediction pixels, which are denoted as the residuals r i,j (i,j 
{0,1,…N-1}).  
As shown in Fig 2, RDPCM can be applied to the 
residuals ri,j that are obtained after intra prediction when the 
intra-prediction mode is vertical or horizontal. Suppose an 
NxN array R with elements r i,j in an array that includes the 
residual pixels obtained after intra prediction. When DPCM 
is applied to the NxN array R, we may attain the modified 
NxN array R’ with elements r’i,j as a result of RDPCM.  
The elements r’ i,j obtained from the modified NxN array 
R’ can be represented as follows when the intra-prediction 
mode is vertical:

Algorithms related to RDPCM were proposed in [13-17]. 
To further improve prediction accuracy, the authors applied 
an additional prediction after the RDPCM process; they 
applied an additional prediction based on the spatial 
characteristic that the difference between neighboring pixels 
would be linearly increased or decreased according to the 
prediction direction in a block. 
  
B. Entropy Coding of HEVC 
 
After residuals are obtained from the prediction process, 
the residuals are then grouped into multiple square transform 
units (TUs). Though the basic unit of coefficient coding is 
TU, the coefficients are encoded per 4x4 sub-blocks. The 
syntax elements for the coefficient coding include 
sig_coeff_flag/coeff_abs_level_g1_flag/coeff_abs_level_g2_f
lag/coeff_sign_flag/coeff_abs_level_remaining. Each syntax 
element shows (respectively) whether or not (a) the 
coefficient is non-zero, (b) the absolute value of the 
coefficient is larger than one, and (c) the absolute value of 
the coefficient is larger than two; they also show (d) the sign 
information and (e) the remaining absolute-level value [18].  
For the remaining absolute level of coefficient (except 
for 1 or 2), coeff_abs_level_remaining is binarized by a k-th 
order truncated Rice and a (k+1)th order Exp-Golomb (EGk). 
HEVC supports a range from 0 to 4 for the Rice parameter k, 
as shown in Table 1. When an absolute level of coefficient is 
greater than the threshold, EGk is added. The initial value of 
the Rice parameter k is zero. During the coding process, the 
Rice parameter depends on the current parameter and the 
previously coded value of coeff_abs_level_remaining.

PROPOSED METHOD FOR LOSSLESS CODING 
 
In lossy compression, the magnitudes of the scanning 
position with a low index are relatively high compared to 
the magnitude of the scanning position with a high index 
[18][19]. The magnitude of each scanning position is similar, 
however, since lossless compression bypasses the transform 
and quantization processes. This means that the magnitudes 
of each coefficient in lossless compression are independent 
of the scanning position; it has also been observed that the 
range of non-zero coefficients in lossless compression is 
generally wide in comparison to lossy compression [6]. This 
insight allows us to know that the current design of the 
entropy coding in HEVC does not work efficiently in 
lossless compression environments.  
Several algorithms have been proposed to achieve 
efficient coding in lossless compression [5-7]; these studies 
include (respectively) changing the scan order according to 
prediction mode, extending the binarization tables for level 
coding, and changing the rule of binarization-table selection. 
A binarization table related to these algorithms is shown in 
Table 1. 
We propose a modified binarization-table-selection 
method based on the characteristics of residuals in a lossless 
compression environment; this method is based on decision 
the updated Rice parameter [6]. 
In HEVC, an absolute value of current coefficient is used 
for renewal of Rice parameter. In [6], the previous 
coefficients in addition to current coefficient are used for the 
renewal. The renewal is based on the weighting sum of the 
previous encoded coefficients. In calculation of weighting 
sum, the previous zero coefficients may influence according 
to distribution of non-zero coefficients. In the proposed 
method, only the previous non-zero coefficients of current 
coefficient position influence the prediction of the next non-
zero coefficient and the binarization-table selection. This 
point is different from that proposed in [6]. We explain the 
details of the proposed method in the following sub-section. 
We also briefly describe other modifications.  
 
A. Proposed Entropy Coding 
 
Absolute levels of previous non-zero coefficients in 
addition to the current coefficient are used to calculate ( )
i
T s  
in the proposed method. Since ( )
T si
 is considered for the 
prediction of the next non-zero coefficient, zero coefficients 
may have a negative influence on the prediction. In the 
proposed method, the absolute levels of the previous non-
zero coefficients are considered in the calculation of ( )
i
T s .

( )

for determining the level-
binarization table is described as follows:

In Equation (6), i and p denote the current scanning 
position 
and 
the 
past 
non-zero 
scanning 
position, 
respectively. In Equation (7), nzi is the number of non-zero 
coefficients that contain the current coefficient in a 4x4 sub-
block. According to nzi, the sharing value wi is then 
determined; in addition, p is influenced by wi. The (wi-1)-th 
previous non-zero coefficient is the starting position p for the 
summation. The parameter b for influencing wi reflects the 
sharing value and is determined empirically (b = 1).  
For the renewal of Rice parameter, the calculated T is 
used as the input value instead of |
|
x  in (5). According to 
the result, Rice parameter is determined for encoding of the 
absolute level of the next non-zero coefficient. In contrast 
with HEVC, the Rice parameter k for the binarization-table 
selection can increase or decrease according to the decision 
procedure.

Three scanning patterns are supported in HEVC: (1) 
diagonal upright, (2) horizontal, and (3) vertical [18]. The 
scanning pattern is adaptively determined according to intra 
mode. In lossless compression, a correlation in the prediction 
direction remains. As shown in Table 2, the adaptive-
scanning patterns are thus changed in our method [5]. 
Considering the characteristic that some coefficients with a 
very high magnitude will appear, the range of the Rice 
parameter k is extended from 0 to 6 [7].

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
 
In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed 
method, we implemented the method using HM 10.0 
reference software; the experimental condition was “Intra, 
Main,” which is one of the most common test conditions, 
discussed in [20][21]. 
In order to apply a lossless coding mode, the quantization 
parameter 
(QP) 
was 
set 
to 
0, 
while 
the 
TransquantBypassFlag, CUTransquantBypassFlagValue, and 
LosslessCUEnabled parameters were set to 1. The transform 
and quantization processes were skipped. Other details of the 
experimental conditions are shown in Table 3. Various 
HEVC test sequences were used for the simulations. In Table 
3, CU and LCU mean coding unit and largest coding unit, 
respectively.

Several techniques for lossless compression were either 
evaluated independently, or a combination of tools was 
evaluated. In terms of intra prediction, the block-based 
method [17] in addition to RDPCM was exploited in our 
technique. Three components of entropy coding from section 
3 were combined as the proposed entropy coding. In order to 
evaluate the compression performance, five categories were 
partitioned: proposed entropy coding (M1), RDPCM (M2), 
block-based prediction [17] (M3), a combination of A and B 
(M4), and a combination of A and C (M5). Table 4 
summarizes the experimental results of the bit-savings tests. 
The table shows the results of M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5, 
which are compared with HM 10.0 lossless intra coding.  
As shown in Table 4, the bit savings of M1 were 1.46% 
on average in total test sequences. Especially, the test did 
show meaningful results in class F. Class F shows that the bit 
savings were 3.48% on average. The sequences in that class

consisted of screen contents. Compared to natural images, 
screen-content images tend to experience many changes 
between adjacent pixels. Some coefficients therefore may 
have a very high magnitude. Since the proposed entropy-
coding method considers the characteristics in a lossless 
compression environment, the method can prevent wasteful 
bits from representing non-zero coefficients that have a very 
high magnitude.  
In the case of block-based prediction, the bit savings of 
M2 and M3 were 5.83% and 7.29%, respectively. Since intra 
prediction is comprised of pixel-by-pixel DPCM, intra 
prediction can provide better coding efficiency compared to 
HM10.0 lossless coding. M3 achieved a small improvement 
over M2, since M3 applies additional prediction after the 
RDPCM process. 
In order to 
optimize 
lossless 
compression, 
we 
experimented with a combination of intra prediction and 
entropy coding. As shown in Table 4, the bit savings of 
combinations M4 and M5 were 6.43% and 7.99% on average, 
respectively. When compared with M2 and M3, test results 
showed additional coding gains of 0.6% and 0.7% 
(respectively) on average in total sequences. In addition, M4 
and M5 showed significant improvement in class F of screen 
content. The difference of bit savings compared to M2 and 
M3 were 2.13% and 2.11%, respectively.

Table 5 describes the encoding time and decoding time of 
each method when each was compared with HM 10.0 
lossless intra coding. In the case of block-based prediction, 
there was no increase in coding time, since high prediction 
accuracy leads to the reduction of residual data to be encoded 
or decoded in our method. The proposed entropy coding, 
when combined with block-based prediction method, led to 
increases in coding time because of the additional processes 
we use related to entropy coding.

CONCLUSION 
 
In order to overcome the limitations of the conventional 
coding structure based on lossy coding, we have proposed a 
method for improving performance in lossless compression 
environments. In this method, entropy coding was modified 
based on the characteristic of residuals in a lossless 
environment. In comparison with HEVC, the experimental 
results showed that the proposed method achieved a bit 
reduction of 1.46% on average. Modified entropy coding 
with block-based intra prediction achieved bit reductions of 
7.99% on average. In particular, the combination of intra 
prediction and entropy coding showed good compression 
performance in screen-contents sequences.  
There is still a need to improve on the coding gains in 
some of the sequences, however. Further study is thus 
required to improve coding performance in lossless coding 
environments.
