INTRODUCTION
Technological innovation and customer demands for
sophisticated
technology
and
services
promote
the
emergence of new challenges, which make an increasingly
changing industry [1]. Many companies have started to use
Internet of Things (IoT) to have their devices interact with
each other. They succeed in the usage of smart devices,
RFID
(Radio
Frequency
IDentification)
technology,
programmed robots and other technologies to automate
many orders, make decisions and solve problems [2], with
real-time interactions between people, products and devices
during the production process. Hence, it was the beginning
of the fourth revolution of industry. The concept of Industry
4.0 (I4.0) appeared first in an article published by the
German government in November 2011 [2]. At this point, it
is the intersection of different technologies at a different
level. In addition to IoT, it includes the Cyber-Physical
systems,
cloud
computing,
smart
factories,
self-
organization, smart product, etc. (Fig.1).
Figure 1. Industry 4.0 technologies pillars [3]
In today’s competitive business environment, companies
are facing challenges in dealing with big data issues of rapid
decision-making
for
improved
productivity.
Many
manufacturing systems are not ready to manage big data due
to the lack of smart analytic tools [4]. Hence, the DM, with
its methods and algorithms, was the best solution for the
enormous volume of data. DM is the extraction of
knowledge from a large volume of data, found its place in
the research area, because of its importance in using the
wasted data that could support decision-making, chosen
from several directions and solve many problems. With the
help of DM techniques, computers are no longer limited to
passively store or collect data. They can also help the users
to actively excerpt the key points from huge amounts of
data, and make use of analysis or prediction [5]. This
concept was used for the first time in the 1990s. It was
developed
across
the
years
and
many
methods
and
algorithms were offered to science, prove their efficiency in
many fields.
In industry, precisely logistics, the tremendous volume
of data
in
the
industrial
environment
has
increased;
therefore, the use of DM as an analytical tool [6] was
necessary. The concept of big data and considerations of
how to deal with such large datasets is an intrinsic challenge
of any system operating in an I4.0 environment [6].

In this paper, we aim to reveal the location of research and
researchers in using DM for I4.0 in logistics and industry
field generally. We start with a brief background of both
industry and DM. A general statistical analysis was done, by
using documents from Scopus database after entering a
specific query; also a content analysis was discussed. After
that, we present a discussion and challenges that this area is
facing, finishing with a conclusion.
II.
BACKGROUND
A. Industry 4.0
The industry began simple and easy, and it depended
mostly on human work and simple machines. The first
mechanical loom was in 1784, to witness the assembly
lines; they used water, hydraulics and steam power. The
second revolution came at the end of the 19th century with
the introduction of electric powered mass production based
of the division of labor. This development made the
emerging automatic way of dealing with the processes
possible. The improvement and the novelty of technologies,
led the industry to a new era. The processes of the
production were totally automated using electronic, IT
systems and developed machines. The interaction of human
in the production process arrived to its end, but it was
limited to program the orders and deal with intelligent
machines, leading to the third revolution in the early 1970s.
The
I4.0
or
the
fourth
industrial
revolution
was
a
consequence
of
the
introduction
of
high
levels
of
technologies especially cyber-physical systems [7], where
physical
and
software
components
interpenetrate
on
different spatial and temporal scales, having multiple and
distinct behaviors and interacting in ways that change the
context of the whole system. We can also cite: IoT, cloud
computing and smart factory [8]-[9].
B. Data mining
The aim of DM is extracting the needed knowledge
(knowledge discovery) supporting decision making. The
terms knowledge discovery and DM first appeared in late
eightieths and have been used ever since [10]. DM appeared
basically from the development of statistic science where
Bayes' theorem helped in understanding composite realities
based on predictable probabilities. It was presented in 1763
in addition to regression analysis in 1805 [11] consisting in
a learning function that maps a detail of data onto a real
variable used for prediction. After that, Neural Networks,
generic algorithms, databases and clustering, Knowledge
Discovery in Databases (KDD) took place in 1989, and
conducted to introduce the term data science in 2001.
Today, DM is emerging by the novelty and high quality of
technologies
and
the
sophisticate
demands
of
clients
[12][13][14].
III.
METHODOLOGY
Aiming at identifying the recent and relevant research on
DM, I4.0 and logistics, a complex query was performed on
01/19/2020 in the scientific database Scopus. The query was
too complex to improve the relevance and to limit the
number of documents; it touched Industry 4.0, DM and
logistics in titles and keywords. Twenty-eight documents
were found, 75% were a conference paper (21), 17.9% were
a journal article (5) and only 7.1% were a review (2). One
conference paper was omitted because its content is
duplicated in a journal paper, one was omitted because it is
written in Russian. We processed then to descriptive
(quantitative) analysis and content (qualitative) analysis.
IV.
DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS
By observing the number of articles in this subject, it is
noticed from Fig. 2 that in the beginning of Industry 4.0, the
researchers
interact
DM
with
I4.0
and
logistics
systematically in analyzing big data by using one or more of
its methods or algorithms. Then after, the volume of data
had been increased, researchers began have more attention
to apply DM’s methods and algorithms in controlling and
analyzing big data in some technologies of the Industry 4.0.
In 2019, a considerable number of articles compared to the
previous years, reveals the strong relationship of I4.0 and
logistics with DM. Even though 2020 is at the beginning,
two articles were published according to our request.
Figure 2. Histogram of the number of articles by year.
While Germany was the first to announce the era of
Industry 4.0, it was the leader by 4 articles in this chosen
group of articles. Russian Federation comes next with 3
articles. Two articles were the outcomes for each of
Colombia, Finland, India, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and
Turkey and 1 article for each of the rest of countries, as it is
presented in Fig. 3.

Fig. 4 shows that the controller of this group of
documents in terms of the subject area was computer science
with 30.6% since applying DM is totally dependent on
programing languages and computers, while engineering was
next with 22.6%, considering that we are in the field of
industry. As mathematics is required in some problems along
with the integration of DM methods, mathematic has 11.3%.
The energy got 6.5% while each of business management
and
accounting, decision science, earth and planetary
sciences, environmental
science have 4.8%. Medicine,
physics and astronomy each of them has 3.2%, materials
science and social sciences have 1.6%. Those percentages
prove the involvement of DM in variant fields.

keyword was I4.0 (Fig. 5) because it was specified in the
title of papers, while DM was placed next, digital storage
and learning systems were equal in term of usage as
keywords. While many keywords of methods and concepts
appeared, it was not expected to be relevant to this subject.

CONTENT ANALYSIS
A. Content analysis in 2016
The objective of this analysis is to
identify the
improvement that could hint to Industry 4.0 by using
different technologies and methods particularly those ones
dealing with data sets. K. Sakornsathien [15] develops a
valuable framework for some organizations particularly the
individuals who purpose to execute I4.0 or the individuals
who previously incorporated it in their ventures. This
connection of information mining with I4.0 advances
assisted with improving the production network, to arrange
the market and to fulfill the customers.
B. Content analysis in 2017
R. Frischer et al. [16] clarify the changes that must touch
the metallurgical engineering to keep abreast of I4.0 and to
be compatible with "other world" systems. They pointed out
that, although the change already started along with putting
into
practice
new
approaches
to
human
resource
management, automation, data networks interconnections,
data storage, DM and much more in the context of Industry
4.0, the implementations and human stance to new ideas
will take decades.

M. Gokalp et al. [17] propose a framework handling
collection of data from IoT and Web based data sources,
implementation of big data analytics applications containing
machine learning and DM components, translation of
visually designed programs to platform specific ones,
management of jobs among processing units, and delivery
of results to people and services. It facilitates the integration
of big data analytics with business processes encouraging by
that the adoption of big data techniques as part of I4.0 vision
in future enterprises.
C. Content analysis in 2018
The
validation
is
necessary
to
data
management,
measurement,
retrieving,
storage,
organization,
data
processing and their presentation. G. DeMilia et al. [18]
present a practical case study related to a sensor-based
condition monitoring application for validation techniques
at the post-processing stage of the data management flow to
realize a better feature extraction for the classification
algorithm. It is applied in a complex mechanical system of
an
automatic
production
with
a
set
of
sensors
of
displacement.
K. Villalobos et al. [19] present a system called
I4TSRS1, available as a Web Application, that efficiently
guides a data engineer in the task of obtaining industrial
time-series data reduced representations that preserve their
main characteristics to reduce data storage and transmission
costs, without limiting the future exploitation of the data in
different
processes.
I4TSRS
recommends
the
best
techniques to achieve a reduced representation of time-
series captured in industrial settings.
Several works focus on application of DM and I4.0 in
logistics. E. Sternberg and M. Atzmueller [20] apply
knowledge-based
data
analysis
in
logistics
to
model
background knowledge in the form of knowledge graphs to
discover subgroup for identifying exceptional patterns.
Overall, the process and the results are well accepted by the
domain experts. In the same context, J.I.R. Molano et al.
[21] study the relation between I4.0 and supply chain in
Colombia and, propose a strategy based on I4.0 for small
and medium-sized companies to diagnose their needs and
solve them. The work of K. Chaudhary et al. [22] presents a
machine learning based adaptive framework for logistics
planning and digital supply chain growing, acclimate and
expand as its knowledge grows to provide a generalized
solution to all kinds of logistics and supply chain activities
J.I. Rodríguez-Molano et al. [23] analyze the man-
things-software communication and propose a metamodel of
integration (IoT, social networks, cloud and Industry 4.0)
for generation of applications for the Industry 4.0, and the
manufacturing monitoring prototype implemented with the
Raspberry Pi microcomputer, a cloud storage server and a
mobile device for controlling an online production.
D. Content analysis in 2019
The year 2019 was rich in this topic because of its
improvement and its quick spread in the mining field
transportation with the use of belt conveyors allows cost
reductions
and
increased
range.
It
also
allows
fully
automatic operation as well as remote monitoring and
control from the centralized control room. L. Jurdziak et al.
[24] introduce diagnostic systems and integrate data from a
number of sources in order to include the idea of conveyor
belt 4.0 into the digitally controlled conveyors 4.0. It is
reliant on several technologies, for example, it is depending
on a lot of information given by an expanding number of
sensors and identified with the activity of machines and
devices.
M. Kebisek et al. [25] focus on the utilization of neural
networks for paint errors classification in the area of
automotive industry, utilizing hypothesis, that outdoor
weather has significant impact on the number of paint
errors, as a basis for comparison of neural network
algorithms. Deep learning was from the used methods. They
concluded that neural networks algorithms are suitable for
this kind of analyses and data sets. While D. Penumuru et al.
[26], with the use of machine vision and machine learning
techniques, develop a novel generalized methodology based
on Support Vector Machine (SVM) to accurately identify
and classify flat materials being machined in a typical
manufacturing environment. They saw that the proposed
methodology will be applied to machine tools and robots
commissioned in smart manufacturing set up and that these
results will be made available in future communications.
M.D. Anuşlu et al. [27] used DM differently; they cluster 
countries using cluster analysis and group them within the
scope of significant impact areas of I4.0 using global
innovation index. They observed that the most important
supporting elements of I4.0 are creativity and innovation.
C.C. Osman et al. [28] introduced the difficulties that meet
up with I4.0 and proposed process mining procedures as
another methodology for business process examination to
help organizations to quickly adjust to advertise changes by
offering modified answers for clients. The study affirms that
the digitization is a key factor in I4.0 changing business
forms.
The study of J. Stentoft et al. [29] was based on 270
valid answers to a questionnaire-survey distributed among
Danish manufacturers. The study identifying potential
drivers and barriers for I4.0 and how to deal with respecting
different technologies such as data processing and big data.
L.A. Rodríguez et al. [30] propose a new architecture for a
web platform for management and inference of information
based on machine learning. The experimental part was
obtained
from
simulator
of
a
hydrogen
production
biorefinery. The designed platform uses methods and
algorithms of automatic learning and DM to receive process
and analyze large amounts of data that generates a
biorefinery which produces hydrogen from wastewater. The
authors
mentioned
that
improving
the
platform’s
architecture is worthwhile to use it in other complex systems
to support decision making and for the good reception and
storage of data in addition to displaying the results. A.
Edirisuriya et al. [31] identify gaps in the field of logistics in
applying lean and green concepts in the context of I4.0.
They
develop
a
conceptual
framework
enhancing
operational performance of logistics operations by applying

lean and green concepts with special reference to I4.0
technologies mentioning that realizing I4.0is becoming
critical for almost all the manufacturing industries existing
in the world.
A. Mayr et al. [32] compare different generic approaches
for identifying, selecting and implementing I4.0 use cases.
They present also a methodical approach in order to tap the
numerous
I4.0
potentials
within
the
electric
motor
production although that they see that the application of I4.0
technologies in this domain has hardly been examined yet.
They presented the DM and machine learning from the
fundamental
relevant
I4.0
technologies,
as
tools
for
intelligent data analyses.
S. Cho et al. [33] propose
semantic-driven
architecture
to
facilitate
the
real-time
update/control of incoming data together with the runtime
module and distribution of computers resources without
direct active management by users. The proposed approach
provides a novel method to open an efficient way to
manage/integrate data in I4.0 applications through the
semantic technology.
J. Para et al. [34] suggest a new methodology ASPPID
for efficiently selecting sensing equipment in industrial
processes and machinery essentially capitalizing on a
predominant role of the data scientist along the entire
decision workflow, not only within the stages where the
captured data are exploited. All decisions through the
proposed methodology are made towards minimizing the
costs and fulfilling the target benefit of the overall project.
F. Galati et al. [35] use text mining methodologies, to
discuss technological solutions at the core of I4.0. ‘Work
and skills’ stream of literature attempts to under the human
element
lurking
behind
the
scene
of
I4.0
regarding
opportunities and implications. J. Piest et al. [36] discussed
the problem of limited usage of real time data originating
from I4.0 technologies by Small Medium Enterprises
(SMEs) in the logistics industry. SMEs benefit from such
data and help them streamline their operational processes
and overall performance, by developing an intelligence
amplification framework in the context of SMEs in logistics
and overall performance of supply chain. The used methods
(KDD, SEMMAn CRISP-DM) could be limited therefore a
technical knowledge and extensiveness of the methods are
required.
K. Bertayeva et al. [37] studied the I4.0 concept in the
field
of
mining
and
suggested
that
research
and
development should be carried out to constantly support
projects such as “Virtual Mine of the Future”, “Virtual
Section of the Future”, aimed at optimizing the combination
of promising technologies, organizational, economic and
other solutions. In their opinion, implementation of the I4.0
project involves the creation of a smart industry that has
evolved evolution from the use of integrated information
and communication control systems to cyber physical
systems. Moreover, to achieve the positive effects of the
formation of innovative systems in the long term, it is
necessary to strategically plan the system of government
regulation measures, develop a set of measures combining
elements of industrial and innovation policies that stimulate
the innovative development of not only the mining industry,
but also related sectors and industries.
E. Content analysis in 2020
During the current year (2020), J. P. UsugaCadavid et al.
[38] contributed to the definition of a methodology to
implement machine learning for production planning and
control and proposed a mapping to classify the scientific
literature in order to identify further research perspectives.
In their opinion, classical methods like simulation and
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) perform poorly at the
operative level therefore the implementation of smart
manufacturing is required.
J. C. Kabugo et al. [39]
developed a concept of a process monitoring platform
aiming at highlighting the use of the state-of-the-art
machine learning methods coupled with big-data processing
tools and cloud computing technologies in process data
analytics. They applicate the developed platform on a waste-
to-energy plant as a study case to better predict of both
syngas heating value and flue gas temperature in this
process.
VI.
DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES
It appeared after analyzing the selected documents that a
remarkable attentiveness head towards using DM techniques
aiming to implement, develop and improve I4.0 in the
industrial field generally or even know barriers and the
constraints in front of this objective, and it is increasing
from year to another. Logistics and supply chain have also
benefited from DM and its technologies. The research
reveals also that relying I4.0 with DM makes it featuring
more technological systems and smart methods.
I4.0 faces different challenges and difficulties involving
many
aspects,
including
scientific,
technological,
and
economic challenges, in addition to social problems and
political issues [2]. The increase of using DM in the context
of I4.0 is a main challenge that can eliminate or even reduce
the previous challenges in different levels. Even though, due
to the complexity of I4.0 with various types, volumes and
uncertainty of data [8], it is well known that the simple use
of DM algorithms will not produce good results; very
complicated and efficient algorithms and methods need to
be used in order to catch the desired results using a high
quality
and
strong
potency
machines
that
would
be
expensive. Furthermore, it is difficult to generalize the
integrated DM in all the technologies of Industry 4.0; each
technology requires a specific algorithm or method.
VII.
CONCLUSION
The aim of this paper was to define where research is in
the field of applying DM in I4.0 and logistics. A quick
review about the background of I4.0 and DM was presented.
A complicated query was entered in Scopus database to do a
generic analysis on the resulting documents; furthermore,
the contents had to be analyzed to distinguish what was the
novelty given by each one. Through this research, different
challenges were observed and have been presented.
The analysis of the documents shows the interest in this
subject area increased through the years, and as it was

expected, Germany was the leader in the number of the
selected documents. The variant branches articulating this
subject confirms that the application of DM is touching
numerous fields and has the attention of many researchers.
The content of those documents showed the rapidly spread
of using DM in Industry 4.0, improving by that the supply
chain management and logistics industry. From the two
analyses, the improvement quality of the technologies that
are used in logistics and industry was noticed, concluding
that DM would give logistics and I4.0 a leap forward.
This group of documents was chosen according to the
query that was written to limit the search to our domain of
research; however, many other articles have discussed this
subject which could be analyzed and treat. Future research
may focus on dealing with the faced challenges; also other
challenges could appear by consulting other articles in this
field.
