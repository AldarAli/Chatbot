Abstract— Due to the growing demand for high definition 
music and video content, an overlay multicasting providing live 
streaming services has been gaining popularity over last years. 
In this paper, we focus on applying the overlay multicasting for 
delivering of critical data that require to be transmitted safely, 
intact and with as little delay as possible, e.g., financial data, 
software security patches, antivirus signature database updates 
etc. To improve survivability of the overlay multicasting, we 
propose to use dual homing approach, i.e., each peer is 
connected to the overlay by two separate access links. We 
introduce several tree construction strategies and conduct 
simulation experiments to investigate problem of providing 
survivability to both static and dynamic types of network. Our 
studies 
demonstrate 
that 
the 
additional 
survivability 
requirements do not have a significant impact on the overlay 
multicasting system expressed as the streaming cost.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Nowadays, we are observing a rapid growth in the 
popularity of multimedia streaming in the Internet. To 
emphasize the growing popularity of various video streaming 
services, we need to quote [1], where the authors claim that 
Video on Demand traffic will triple and Internet TV will 
increase 17 times by 2015. The total share of all forms of 
video (already mentioned) and P2P will grow continuously 
to be approximately 90 percent of all global consumer traffic 
in the next three years. Services such as internet radio, high 
definition video or audio streaming are very useful for 
network users, but often require a lot of bandwidth, which 
can be costly [1]. To reduce maintenance and investment 
cost, the concept of overlay multicasting is applied. An 
overlay multicasting technology is based on a multicast 
delivery tree consisting of peers (end hosts). Content 
transmitted by the overlay multicasting can be either 
streaming content with additional requirements like bit rate 
etc. [3], or data files. In many related works, the authors 
assume that users of a multicast network can leave the 
system. That kind of overlay network is called dynamic or 
evolving [4]. Among examples of such a system are popular 
protocols like Torrent [5], eDonkey [6] or Skype [7]. 
Another network type is so-called a static network, where 
hosts form static structure and are not allowed to leave the 
system, and which well-known examples are: 
 Content 
delivery 
network 
(CDN), 
e.g., 
Akamai 
Technologies, 
 Set-top box (STB) technology used in IPTV, 
 Critical information streaming, e.g., hurricane warnings. 
In our work, we apply the overlay multicasting in a dual 
homing architecture to improve network survivability, 
defined as the ability to provide the continuous service in the 
presence of failures. The dual homing approach assumes that 
all hosts (nodes) have two disjoint links (homes) to the 
network. Those links provide the network protection because 
of redundancy. The main contribution of the paper consists 
of: (i) a formulation of new strategies of creating link disjoint 
multicast trees in survivable overlay networks with 
optimization of cost and number of tree levels; (ii) a new 
modular simulator for testing introduced strategies in both 
static and dynamic networks; (iii) numerical experiments 
based on proposed tree construction strategies showing 
comparative results and other characteristics of the proposed 
concepts. Note that the concept of overlay multicasting 
protection by dual homing has been introduced in our recent 
papers [8],[9],[10] in the context of both streaming cost and 
maximum delay objective functions. 
The rest of this paper is organized in the following way. 
In Section 2, we present previous research on overlay 
multicasting and dual homing multicasting with a special 
focus on survivability and simulation. Section 3 introduces 
the concept of survivable overlay P multicasting based on the 
dual homing method. In Section 4, we formulate tree 
construction strategies for the survivable (link disjoint) dual 
homing overlay multicast. Section 5 includes description of 
the overlay simulator. In Section 6, we present and discuss 
the results of our experiments. Finally, the last section 
concludes this work.

RELATED WORKS 
In this section, we present previous papers related to dual 
homing and overlay multicasting. Dual homing is a subject 
of several articles. Jianping et al. [11] created the multicast 
protection scheme based on a dual homing architecture 
where each destination host is connected to two edge routers. 
Under such an architecture, the two paths from the source of 
the multicast session to the two edge routers provide 
protection for the trafﬁc from the source to the destination. 
In [12], a novel homing scheme called dual homing with 
shared backup router resources (SBRR) is introduced. The 
authors claim that their approach leads to savings up to 40% 
of the cost of traditional dual homing architecture. New ILP 
model for joint optimization of dedicated working and 
shared backup paths of anycast and unicast demands is 
introduced and is followed by extensive simulation research.

Another field of application for dual homing technology 
is Self-healing ring networks [13][14], where new network 
design methods and routing algorithms are designed and 
developed. An integer programming formulation and the NP-
completeness of the problem is presented. 
In [15], Jianping et al. introduce a concept of partial 
protection for the multicast dual homing network and a new 
algorithm PAS for finding the best partial multicast 
protection tree is proposed. The authors claim that simulation 
results show that the PAS algorithm achieves performance 
very close to the computed lower bounds. 
Wang et al. [16] studied IP-over-WDM network 
survivability with a dual homing infrastructure. The paper 
focuses on a problem of adding survivability to IP WDM 
multicasting networks for both static and dynamic traffic. 
The authors created and evaluated coordinated protection 
design. 
A scalable multicast protection scheme based on the dual 
homing architecture was introduced in [17]. The solution 
proposed by Wang et al. can be used to choose dynamically 
two edge routers for a multicast host. 
Thulasiraman et al. [18] addressed disjoint multipath 
routing in the dual homing network problem. An algorithm 
for constructing colored trees in dual-homing using colored 
trees is proposed. 
Overlay multicast (application-layer multicast) [19], [20] 
is a technology, which uses the overlay network topology, 
that enables multicast functionality for end hosts instead of 
routers. The authors propose a proactive tree recovery 
mechanism to make the overlay multicast resilient to peer 
failures. Simulations are used to prove that the proactive 
method can recover from node failures much faster than 
reactive methods. 
A P2P (Peer-to-Peer) simulators survey is presented in 
[21]. Naicken et al. tested the most popular P2P simulators 
and found that they lack some of the key functionalities and 
conclude that because of that the majority of P2P 
researchers create their own simulation environment. 
III. 
SURVIVABILITY FOR OVERLAY MULTICASTING 
Two methods are used in order to provide the network 
survivability: restoration and protection. The main difference 
between them is that restoration applies dynamic resource 
allocation while protection needs preallocated network 
resources. This results in different overall cost and 
restoration time. Well-known protection methods are: 
automatic protection switching (1+1, 1:1, etc.), p-cycles and 
backup paths/links. In our previous works, we proposed to 
use disjoint overlay multicast trees streaming the same 
content [8], [22]. Peers affected by the failure of one of the 
trees can use another tree to receive the required data in the 
case of a failure. This procedure guarantees very low 
restoration time. 
In this paper, we are studying the network survivability 
problem for the dual homing architecture. In Fig. 1, we 
present a simple example to illustrate our concept.  
 
 
Figure 1. Simple P2P multicast scheme. 
There are two disjoint multicast trees A, B that connect 7 
nodes - a, b, c, d, e, f, g. In the case of tree A, nodes a, d and f 
are parents (uploading nodes), while remaining ones are leafs 
(nodes that are only downloading data). We use the term of 
level to describe location of nodes in the multicast tree. For 
example, node a is on level 1 of tree B, nodes b and e are on 
level 2 of tree B and rest of the nodes are on level 3. 
The overlay multicasting is done in the application layer, 
i.e., end-hosts are connected using the overlay network. 
Connections between peers are established as unicast 
connection over the underlying physical layer. Each peer is 
connected to the overlay by an access link. We propose to 
use the dual homing approach to protect the system against a 
failure of the access link. The main idea is to create two 
overlay multicasting trees guaranteeing that each of access 
links carries traffic only of one of the trees. Since each node 
has two access links (dual homing), it receives the streaming 
data from both trees on two separate links. Thus, if one of 
access links is broken, the node still is connected to the 
stream, and moreover, it can upload the stream to subsequent 
peers located in the tree. 
A proper configuration of the overlay multicasting with 
dual homing protects the network from two kinds of failure: 
 Uploading node failure - failure impacts all successors of 
the failed peer in the tree, 
 Overlay link failure - overlay link failure comprises 
failure of both directed links between nodes. 
IV. 
A DISTRIBUTED APPROACH TOWARDS CREATING 
OVERLAY TREES 
In the overlay multicasting networks we consider, hosts 
connect to the system by their own. A node v willing to join 
the network contacts a host with information about the 
network (e.g., root node) and receives a list of possible 
parents already connected to the multicast tree. If it 
successfully connects to the system, the database of feasible 
parents is updated. In the other case, node v sends a request 
to the root for another set of feasible parents. Another case 
scenario occurs when the simulated network is dynamic, 
meaning that nodes already connected to the system can 
leave the system. CNF message allows all the parent nodes 
to have updated information about their children. When node 
145

v is disconnecting from the network, its parent informs the 
root node so that it can update the peers database. All the 
children of node v are disconnected from the network and in 
order to reconnect have to send the RQT message. It uses IP-
to-Location mapping prediction method and historical 
connections data to gain knowledge of approximate cost of 
all possible connections between nodes.  
In [8], in the context of streaming cost objective function, 
we introduced novel ILP (Integer Linear Programming) 
formulations of survivable overlay multicasting systems 
using dual homing architecture. As a natural continuation, 
below we introduce six tree construction strategies that 
include ideas related to ILP models. To formulate the 
problem, we use the notation as in [23]. Let indices 
v,w = 1,2,…,V denote peers – nodes of the overlay network. 
There are K peers (clients) indexed k = 1,2,…,K that are not 
root nodes in any tree and that want to receive the data 
stream. Index t = 1,2,…,T denotes streaming trees. We 
assume that T = 2, however the model is more general and 
values T > 2 may be used. In trees, nodes are located on 
levels l = 1,2,…,L. That gives us possibility to set a limit on 
the maximum depth of the tree. The motivation behind this 
additional constraint is to improve the QoS (Quality of 
Service) parameters of the overlay multicasting, .e.g., 
network reliability and transmission delay. If node v is root 
of the tree t, then rwt = 1, otherwise rwt = 0. Constant cwv 
denotes streaming cost on an overlay link (w,v), that can be 
interpreted as a network delay or a transmission cost. 
We introduce constant τ(v), which denotes a virtual node 
associated with the node v, what follows for the dual homing 
Nodes v and τ(v) form a primal node.  
Every primal node has in fact four capacity parameters – 
constants dv and uv are respectively download and upload 
capacity of the one access link and constants dτ(v) and uτ(v) are 
parameters of the second (dual) access link. Additionally, to 
be able to simulate both static and dynamic overlay 
multicasting networks, we introduce two constants – tsv and 
tev, which are respectively time when a host v tries to connect 
and to leave the network. The objective function is overall 
streaming cost (cost of all multicast trees). Fig. 2 depicts an 
example of the dual homing modeling. Dual homes are 
marked with a pattern of sequential lines and dots. 
 
Figure 2. Modeling dual homing. 
It is shown that streaming trees are using different 
connections to nodes. 
We propose six tree construction strategies for overlay 
multicasting with dual homing described in details in the 
following section. 
A. Tree construction strategies for overlay multicasting 
with Dual Homing 
In our strategies, we use specified type of messages 
between hosts and root node: 
 RQT – message sent from a host willing to connect to 
the overlay network to the root node, 
 LST – possible response to the RQT; list of possible 
parents for the requesting host (with length of 10). In the 
process of selecting possible parents root node is 
responsible of keeping multicast trees disjoint, 
 DEN – possible response to the RQT message; refusal of 
connection when there is no feasible parent; host can try 
again with RQT signal, 
 ATT – message sent from a host willing to connect to 
the network to a feasible parent with a connection 
request, 
 PER – possible response to ATT; the requesting node is 
connected to the network, 
 REF – possible response to ATT; the feasible parent is 
refusing connection, e.g., due to lack of free upload 
capacity,  
 CON – message from a host to the root node informing 
about successful connection, 
 DEL – message sent from the parent of a host requesting 
disconnection from the network to root node, 
 CNF – message sent from a child to its parent every 60 
seconds. If during 120 seconds the parent does not 
receive CNF, it sends the DEL signal. 
 
Figure 3. Example of communication process in overlay system. 
In Fig. 3, we present an example of the communication 
in our model of the overlay system. Host v is requesting a 
connection to the network, receives a list of possible 
parents, sends ATT message to feasible parent w, receives 
positive response PER, connects to parent node w and sends 
CON message to the root node. 
We developed the following six strategies for overlay 
multicasting with dual homing: 
 unprotected Cost Optimization (uCO) – node v willing 
to connect to the network sends RQT to the root node, 
receives a LST message with the sorted list of possible 
parents selected by minimal connection cost criterion 
and attempts connection to the first (the cheapest) node 
on the list. If the connection process is successful, node v 
146

sends a CON signal to the root updating information 
about the tree. Otherwise, the node sends RQT signal 
and receives another set of feasible parents; there is no 
level control; this strategy does not provide survivability 
because there is no requirement related to trees disjoint 
(nodes v and τ(v) can be in the same multicast tree), 
 unprotected Cost Optimization with Levels (uCOL) the 
aim of this strategy is to minimize the tree depth 
(maximum number of tree levels). For each tree, nodes 
requesting connection are connected to the root until free 
upload capacity of the root is available. When there is 
not enough upload capacity on the current tree level, the 
next level is started. Node v willing to connect receives a 
LST message with the sorted (by cost) list of possible 
parents located only on the previous level. On each level 
the cheapest possible connection is selected; no 
survivability provided, 
 Cost Optimization (CO) – analogous to uCO, but the 
root node in the process of selecting possible parents for 
the requesting node includes additional survivability 
constraints e.g., node v and its virtual node τ(v) have to 
be connected to disjoint multicast trees, 
 Cost Optimization with Levels (COL) – analogous to 
uCOL; survivability provided, 
 Random Selection (RS) and Random Selection with 
Levels (RSL) – those strategies perform similar to CO 
and COL respectively, but parent node is picked 
randomly from list provided by root node (also selected 
by random); both strategies provide survivability 
through disjoint of multicast trees. 
All strategies are able to connect requesting hosts for 
both static and dynamic networks. Note that random 
strategies (RS and RSL) follow from real overlay systems 
like BitTorrent and others [5], where peers are selected by 
random and the transmission cost is not taken into account. 
For RSL, uCOL and COL strategies, the main goal is to limit 
the number of tree levels and as a result make the tree as 
short as possible. The motivation is to minimize the 
consequences of the node failure. Differently, cost 
optimization strategies (uCO and CO), aim in minimizing 
the overall streaming cost of the network, where cost can be 
interpreted as a network delay, transmission cost, etc.

OVERLAY SIMULATOR DESCRIPTION 
After doing research on some well-known P2P 
simulators, i.e., p2pSim and PeerSim, we decided that it 
would be much more time efficient to create our own 
overlay simulator for dual homing architecture, than 
implementing this architecture and all the tree construction 
strategies into one of those simulators. The overlay 
simulator we developed is rather simple and concentrates on 
the process of creating trees. We believe that this approach 
is sufficient to examine the influence of survivability 
constraints on the overlay multicasting network. We focus 
on two criteria related to overlay multicasting: overall 
network cost and number of levels in multicast trees. 
Let constant LT denote time of life in seconds for 
simulating the overlay network. Starting from z = 0 seconds, 
we can distinguish two phases of this process: 
 Connection phase - all the hosts for which tsv = z attempt 
to connect to the network, 
 Disconnection phase – all the hosts for which tev = z 
disconnect from the system (only for the dynamic 
networks). If disconnecting node v was a parent in 
multicast tree t than root is remodeling the tree by 
reconnecting children of node v to new parents. 
After executing both phases simulator increments z by 1 
(second) and repeats above actions. System is working until 
z = LT. 
Pouwelse et al. [5] and Xiaojun et al. [24] study global 
characteristics 
of 
large 
P2P 
systems 
and 
provide 
measurements data useful in modeling P2P networks. They 
focus on phenomenon called flashcrowd effect, where peers 
join the network rapidly and after reaching peak number of 
host in network is decreasing gradually.  
In our paper, we try to model this dependency in case of 
dynamic type of network. We set LT = 10800 seconds (3 
hours) and during the first hour nodes are only connecting to 
the network. Between the first and the second hour, new 
nodes are still connecting, but there are also some that are 
disconnecting. In the last hour, nodes are only leaving the 
network. 
For simulating the static networks, we set LT = 7200 
seconds and nodes are only allowed to connect to the 
system, i.e., nodes do not leave the system during the 
simulation.

RESEARCH 
A. Comparing the tree construction strategies - experiment 
design 
To compare introduced strategies, we use our overlay 
simulator. We randomly generated 5 different networks, 
where 
V = 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000 
with 
two 
disjointed trees (T = 2). Each network consist of either 
symmetric nodes (100Mbps/100Mbps - 10% of all nodes) or 
asymmetric 
nodes (1Mbps/256Kbps, 2Mbps/512Kbps, 
6Mbps/512Kbps, 
10/1Mbps, 
20/1Mbps, 
50/2Mbps, 
100/4Mbps). Link costs are random values from the interval 
[1,100]. Overall, for both static and evolving type of 
network, we conducted the following three experiments and 
each of them was executed 50 times for different sets of tsv 
and tev: 
 comparing overall network cost and number of levels for 
different tree construction strategies and different 
network size (from 1000 to 5000 nodes), 
 increasing the streaming rate q from 128 Kbps to 640 
Kbps and verifying its impact on the overall network 
cost and the number of levels for different strategies, 
 based on results of previous experiments, check 
survivability impact on overall network size.

Additional criterion of comparison for our experiments 
was percentage of nodes that have not been able to connect 
to the network, i.e., the number of rejects. 
B. Comparing the tree construction strategies– results  
For the purpose of the first experiment, we set streaming 
rate q to 256 Kbps and L value to 100. In Figs 4 and 5, we 
show results of tree construction strategies for different size 
of the network. For all strategies, the overall network cost is 
increasing with size of the network. In terms of the overall 
network cost, strategies uCO and CO prove to be most 
efficient. 
 
Figure 4. Streaming cost as a function of number of nodes (static). 
 
Figure 5. Number of levels as a function of size of the network (static). 
uCOL strategy achieved lowest average number of levels 
in the multicast trees – 4,5. Results of strategies with 
survivability constraints (COL and RSL) were worse only by 
2,2%. Results of the first experiment are in line with our 
expectations, since uCO and CO are minimizing the overall 
streaming cost, while uCOL and COL number of tree levels.

In Table I, we show results of analogous experiment, but 
for dynamic type of the network. For each strategy and 
network size, we report the average cost and the average 
number of levels obtained in the final configuration. We can 
observe, that results for the dynamic case are similar to 
those for the static approach. Random tree construction 
strategies (RS and RSL) are much less efficient than CO and 
COL in terms of overall network cost. Surprisingly, CO 
strategy is creating trees with lower number of levels than 
strategy with no survivability (uCO). This is implied by the 
fact that the survivability constraints cause both multicast 
trees to connect the same number of nodes. For the 
strategies with no survivability constraints there is no such 
requirement, so one of the multicast trees can have more 
nodes than the other one and in effect have more levels. 
The next goal of experiments was to verify how the 
overall streaming cost and number of levels are influenced 
by the streaming rate q. For this experiment, we set the level 
limit L to 100 and chose network with 3000 nodes. Table II 
presents results related to comparison of the introduced 
strategies in terms of the overall streaming cost and 
maximum depth (level) of the multicast trees in the static 
environment. In line with our expectations, both the overall 
streaming cost and the number of levels are increasing with 
streaming rate q for all tree constructing strategies. 
For the streaming rate q equal to 640 Kbps, strategies 
with the survivability constraints were unable to connect all 
the requesting nodes, as shown on Fig. 6: 
 
Figure 6. Percentage of not connected nodes for q = 640 Kbps – static 
network.

Figure 7. Percentage of not connected nodes for q = 640 Kbps – dynamic 
network. 
Results obtained for the dynamic type of network are 
similar to those in Table II. Figure 7 shows percentage of 
nodes that failed to connect to the network for streaming 
rate q = 640 Kbps. 
We can easily notice that all the strategies were unable to 
connect all of requesting nodes. Strategies with no 
survivability (uCO and uCOL) had average number of 
rejects of 9-10%. Adding the survivability constraint 
increases this parameter by 20-25%. The main conclusion is 
that for highly constrained networks (e.g. low L limit or 
high q value) survivability strategies may more often not be 
able to find any feasible solution than strategies with no 
survivability constraints. Those findings are in harmony 
with our previous conclusions [10]. 
In the last experiment, we tested the impact of the 
survivability constraints on the overall streaming cost, i.e., 
we compare results of CO against uCO and COL against 
uCOL. Results are presented in Tables III and IV. Our 
observations are as follows: 
 The average cost (considering all experiments) of 
providing additional survivability was 8% for the CO 
strategy and 28% for the COL strategy. 
 As the number of nodes grows, the gap between 
strategies with additional survivability requirements and 
normal strategies decreases. This can be explained by 
rapid increase in size of the solution space. As a result, it 
is possible to find a cost efficient solution with the 
survivability constraints. 
 With the increase of the streaming rate q, the additional 
cost of providing survivability grows. Again, this is 
caused by the fact, that with increase of q, the solution 
space shrinks.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we focused on the survivable overlay 
multicasting systems with the dual homing architecture in 
both static and dynamic networks. We introduced six 
different tree construction strategies (of which four provide 
survivability constraints), along with the overlay simulator, 
and compare their results for different types of networks in 
terms of the overall streaming cost and the number of levels 
in the multicast trees. According to the obtained results, we 
can conclude that cost optimization strategies obtain results 
from 4 to 8 times better than random optimization strategies 
in respect of the streaming cost in all multicast trees. We 
observe that the average cost of providing survivability in 
all of our experiments was 8% and 28% for CO and COL 
strategies, respectively. Moreover, the additional cost is 
decreasing with the increase of the network size. We can 
derive that the additional constraints that allow constructing 
failure-disjoint trees do not influence significantly the 
performance of the overlay multicasting system in terms of 
the streaming cost. 
In future work, we plan to develop additional strategies 
that will provide even more survivability, like node and ISP 
disjoint trees, and conduct more experiments evaluating 
these solutions.
