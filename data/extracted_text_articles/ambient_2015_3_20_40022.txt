Abstract— The geolocalization is a technique which assures the 
determination of the geographical positions of individuals 
through their mobile equipments or elements equipped with a 
specific device. It has received research interest due to the 
success of the emerging wireless sensor network technology. To 
achieve some applications, such as environmental monitoring, 
military surveillance and disaster relief, node localization is 
fundamental and essential. Moreover, the availability of 
location information can enable a myriad of applications such 
as, intrusion detection, inventory management, road traffic 
monitoring, 
reconnaissance, 
health 
monitoring 
and 
surveillance, in order to insure an intervention in the suitable 
time and place. There are different methods of geolocalization 
able of resolving this problem. All these approaches are 
characterized by their own disadvantages and advantages, 
making them adapted to various applications. So, we always 
try to improve them by proposing a new approach with the 
aim of having a better precision and a more accurate 
positioning. This paper presents a new geometric method 
which can improve the poor locating performance of the 
typical Distance Vector-Hop (DV-Hop) algorithm, without 
increasing the hardware cost for sensors. We propose this 
approach to ensure the monitoring and the positioning of 
patients in medical environments for indoor use and to achieve 
a good compromise between positioning accuracy, computation 
complexity and energy cost. The influences of anchors on the 
algorithm and simulation results are also explored in this 
paper.

INTRODUCTION  
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) represent a very 
interesting domain of development that has become a new 
research focus in communication and computer fields [1]. 
They are tremendously being used in different environments, 
in a random way, to perform various monitoring tasks such 
as rescue, search, target tracking, disaster relief and a number 
of tasks in smart environments [2]. A wireless network is 
composed of plenty of nodes that are deployed in the 
monitoring field, and that have perception, processing and 
communication ability [3]. Each node is capable of sensing 
the environment and then communicating the measured data 
to its neighbours, and eventually to the external users. Many 
applications require geographical information to work 
effectively. Indeed, we cannot make decisions without 
knowing the locations of some persons or certain objects 
because there are information that depends on the positions 
of the users like the forecasts, the meteorological 
observations and also the road traffic [4]. Localization 
capability is necessary in most WSN applications, 
particularly for tracking patients in medical environments. In 
fact, the determination of a person location means placing it 
in a defined environment or finding its place in a space with 
Cartesian coordinates. So, one of the basic challenges in the 
WSN is node geolocalization, which is a particular case of 
localization [2][5]. It is the positioning of a person or an 
object using geographic locations. Thus, we can distinguish 
between so many approaches to assure the implementation of 
this process. These approaches commonly aim at positioning 
target nodes as accurately as possible. A localization method 
is a set of technologies implemented and used to perform the 
positioning task [4]. Its performance depends on some 
factors, such as the system accuracy, the costs of 
communication and the density of nodes. 
The purpose of this paper is to explain the principle and 
the interest of the specific localization case through 
geographic coordinates. The rest of the paper will be 
organized as follows: In the second section, we will present 
an overview of the geolocalization problem. A presentation 
of the problem in medical environments will be also cited in 
Section 3. Section 4 describes the basic DV-Hop algorithm. 
In the next section, we discuss a new geometric positioning 
approach based on DV-Hop algorithm. Section 6 presents the 
simulation results and analysis. Finally, we will conclude the 
paper in Section 7. 
II. 
WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORK GEOLOCALIZATION 
  Many applications use a random deployment of a large 
number of sensors. So, the localization phase is required to 
realize network operation and also to exploit collected 
information. We must then locate all the nodes with the best 
possible accuracy. Just like management issues of energy 
consumption, the problem of localization and specifically of 
geolocalization seems challenging and research works 
should focus on the development of effective positioning 
methods. In fact, the geolocalization in the WSN is 
considered as a typical case of localization. It presents a 
process that ensures the positioning of an object 
(information, a person, etc.) on a map or a plan through its 
65

geographic coordinates. It is also used in order to position 
mobile nodes. The realization of this operation is done using 
a terminal capable of being located by using a Global 
Positioning System (GPS) receiver or through other 
techniques and ensuring the publication of its geographical 
coordinates in a differed way or in real time [5]. Saved 
locations can be stored inside the terminal and extracted 
later, or transmitted in real time towards a software platform 
that provides the geolocalization. Sending in real time 
requires a terminal equipped with a telecommunication tool 
which its type can be radio or satellite, allowing it to transmit 
the positions during regular intervals. Thus, the terminal 
location can be visualized in a map by a geolocation platform 
which is often accessible via Internet.  
Geolocalization is needed today for the development. It is 
applicable in several levels. It allows tracking vehicles 
carrying people and goods and ensures their localization in 
real time and also the detection of problems. In fact, these 
are sensors with varied forms, making it possible to provide 
information according to geographical positions of the users. 
The geolocalization offers many services in different fields. 
For example, security services can find reinforcement in 
some positioning techniques. Thus, everyone is currently 
agreed on its important value. 
Before its establishment, the WSN deployment requires a 
simulation phase of the used protocol to ensure a good 
performance. There are so many solutions for WSN 
positioning that can be classified according to various 
criteria. These methods include Amorphous [6][7], Centroid 
[8], DV-Hop [9] and Approximate Point In Triangulation 
(APIT) [10]. These techniques are simple because they 
respect the material and energy constraints of sensor nodes 
and they also provide a low cost. However, their 
fundamental problem is the low accuracy. Thus, the main 
objective of this paper is to propose a geolocalization 
technique for tracking patients in health care settings, 
ensuring high accuracy without increasing the operational 
cost of the network. 
III. 
GEOLOCALIZATION IN MEDICAL ENVIRONMENTS 
In the sociomedical institutions, clinics and hospitals, 
ensuring the security and the protection of patients, as well 
as safeguarding mobile equipments, has become an 
increasing priority. Currently, monitoring and supervision of 
patients is done manually in hospital by medical staff and in 
a regular way [11]. This process of collecting information 
can be problematic. In fact, the collection is not done in real 
time (so many times per day) and hence the staff 
mobilization becomes necessary during a considerable 
interval of time. Thus, one often tries to solve these problems 
while benefiting from technological advances that provide 
advantageous techniques of care and assistance for the 
patients. The WSN is used in the medical field as it allows 
patient monitoring at a distance and the control of human 
physiological data, such as heart rate and glucose level [12]. 
Indeed, we can attach to the patient small sensor nodes able 
to carry out specific tasks, such as detecting heartbeats and 
the control of blood pressure. In addition, video micro-
sensors can be implanted under the skin in order to receive 
images of a body part in real time without surgery. 
Therefore, it will be possible to supervise the recovery of 
muscles or the progression of diseases. Several medical 
problems, such as cancer, can be then controlled. Wireless 
sensors permit also the detection of older people behavior, so 
one can intervene quickly in case of need [13]. Staff can be 
informed of the transmitter location and also the patient 
name, and as soon as a disorientated patient or a sick person 
suffering from senile dementia or psychic disorders leaves a 
protected area, staff will be warned using alert messages that 
can be sent via a wireless telephone, an alarm system, a 
pager or the call nursing system.  
The sensors are used not only for the wireless monitoring 
of the patients, but also for the monitoring and the control of 
the doctors within the hospital. In addition, they can be 
attached to drugs and medicines to be administered, in order 
to decrease the probability of giving bad treatments to 
patients and minimizing the possibilities of side effects 
caused by the use of inappropriate drugs. The sensor network 
is effective in the medical field, as the micro-sensors provide 
a movement ease for the controlled and monitored subjects 
and also a faster identification of some symptoms to doctors. 
We propose through this paper to perform a collection of 
information in real time and in an automated manner via a 
WSN. Our proposal consists of presenting a global method 
for tracking and positioning patients in health care settings, 
grouping several technologies, for an indoor employment.  
In the field of WSN geolocalization, we always try to 
guarantee a better precision with a low energy consumption 
and lower cost. We try then to benefit from the advantages of 
the various existed localization methods and we propose a 
new algorithm which solves the problems of the constraints 
satisfaction. This problem can be resolved by employing an 
algorithm which consists in making the combination of 
different techniques. Indeed, it exploits the good properties 
of the various methods by applying them to the problems 
that can be solved efficiently [14][15]. As a typical range-
free algorithm [4], DV-Hop algorithm has the advantage to 
localize normal nodes that have less than three neighbour 
anchors. Many works in the literature propose schemes and 
improved DV-Hop methods for many purposes. Since each 
was developed to fulfill a different goal, they vary widely in 
many parameters including accuracy, cost, configurability, 
security, and reliability [3]. 
IV. 
DV-HOP POSITIONING ALGORITHM 
Niculescu and Nath [16] have proposed the DV-Hop 
algorithm, which is one of the typical representatives of 
range-free localization algorithm. Its basic idea is that the 
distance between the unknown nodes and the reference 
nodes is expressed [17]. The algorithm implementation is 
comprised of three steps. First, it employs a classical 
distance vector exchange, so that all nodes in the network get 
distances, in hops, to the landmarks. Then, it estimates an 
average size for one hop, which is deployed as a correction 
to the entire network. Finally, unknown nodes compute their 
location by trilateration [18]. The complexity of this 
algorithm is higher than that of some approaches, such as 
Centroid [19] and Convex Position Estimation (CPE) [20], 
66

designed for normal nodes which have at least three 
neighbour anchors. The Centroid algorithm has a low 
computation cost, and does not increase the network traffic. 
It can also get relatively good accuracy, when the 
distribution of anchors is regular. However, when the 
distribution of anchors is not even, the estimated position 
derived from the Centroid algorithm will be inaccurate [21]. 
CPE has slightly higher localization accuracy than Centroid 
[3].  
DV-Hop is a suitable solution for normal nodes having 
less than three neighbour anchors. In the first implementation 
step, each anchor node broadcasts an anchor to be flooded 
throughout the network containing the anchors location with 
a hop count value initialized to one. Each receiving sensor 
maintains the minimum hop count value. Anchors with 
higher hop count values are defined as the useless and 
ignored information. Then, the rest of anchors are flooded 
outward with hop count values incremented at every 
intermediate hop. Through this process, all nodes in the 
network get the minimal hop count to every anchor node. In 
the second step, once an anchor gets hop count value to other 
anchors, it estimates an average size of one hop, which is 
then flooded to the entire network. After receiving the hop 
size, the unknown nodes multiply the hop size by the hop 
count value to derive the estimated physical distance from 
the anchor. Each anchor node broadcasts its hop size to the 
network using controlled flooding. Unknown nodes receive 
the hop size information and save the first one. Meanwhile, 
they transmit the hop size to their neighbour nodes. This 
scheme ensures that most nodes receive the hop size from 
the anchor that has the least hops between them. In the last 
step, when unknown nodes get three or more distance 
information from anchors, the trilateral measuring method or 
the maximum likelihood estimation approach is used to 
calculate their locations [3]. The average hop size is 
estimated by the anchor node i using the following formula

where (xi, yi) and (xj, yj) are coordinates of anchors i and

nodes i and j. It is assumed that (xu, yu) are the location of the 
unknown node u, (xi, yi) are the known location of the ith 
anchor node and dui is the distance between them. Then, the 
coordinates of u are computed by the following formula [17]:

Finally, the refinement process of locations is carried out. 
In fact, after estimating their positions, the sensors ensure 
their dissemination to their neighbors. Thus, based on this 
information and according to the different neighborhood 
relations, these sensors determine again their positions which 
are close to their actual locations. The sensors fix then their 
estimated positions after a definite number of iterations. The 
precision of the DV-Hop algorithm is low because the 
average distance of one hop represents an approximate 
estimation and it is difficult to know the exact values of the 
distances separating the nodes [23]. Indeed, this algorithm 
exactitude varies according to the precision of these 
distances. The second weakness is related to the type of 
nodes distribution; because the more regular it is, the more 
results are accurate, i.e., it is not applicable for the random 
distributions. However, the advantage of this method is that 
it doesn’t require additional hardware for the distances 
estimate and the determination of the unknown locations. 
This significantly reduces the economic and energetic 
localization cost and also it avoids the constraint imposed by 
Centroid and CPE (the requirement of a minimum of three 
neighbour anchors). Moreover, it employs a very simple 
algorithm that does not require too many computing and 
radio communication and processing operations, i.e., not 
much energy consumption. 
V. 
IMPROVED DV-HOP GEOLOCALIZATION SCHEME 
We propose through this paper to perform a collection of 
information in real time and in an automated manner via a 
WSN. Our proposal consists of presenting a global method 
for tracking and positioning patients in health care settings, 
grouping several technologies, for an indoor employment. In 
fact, one or several fixed nodes will form a backbone which 
is responsible for relaying the data collected by sensors that 
are placed on mobile patients. Fixed sensors must be 
organized in an efficient and robust virtual structure, whereas 
the other mobile nodes require being able to be adaptable to 
various displacements in order to broadcast the information 
in a proper manner. It is essential to use mobile anchors that 
will communicate with the other nodes to simplify the 
coordinates attribution to the sensors attached to patients. 
Generally, the existence of several reference nodes is 
compulsory to have a good accuracy and certainty in the 
determination of the positions but practically this is difficult 
because of the rising cost of these anchors. In the wireless

sensors network, anchors are necessary for the localization of 
nodes in a global coordinates system. These are ordinary 
nodes that know their coordinates a priori. These anchors, 
which play a very important role, can be affixed or carried by 
people working at the hospital (doctors, nurses, etc.) and they 
also can be inserted in medical equipments. Figure 1 shows 
this principle. 
 
 
Figure 1. Positioning method in medical environments 
Since their positions change over time, it is necessary to 
update them. To do this, we propose to employ Radio 
Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. In fact, it is 
based on remote research, extraction and storage of data, 
which requires the presence of an RFID reader, a tag and a 
database. It designates the recognition of objects and even 
people by radiofrequency transmission [24]. An RFID 
system includes a reader (interrogator) that transmits a signal 
to a radio tag or more placed in its reading field depending 
on a given frequency. This is a transceiver which provides 
the communication with the corresponding tag by 
electromagnetic waves. This latter is designed to receive a 
radio signal and then to return immediately another response 
signal containing relevant information. To perform data 
exchange, a dialogue is established between these two 
components using a communication protocol. Tags are small 
objects that can be incorporated into products or implanted in 
living beings like animals or the human body. They include 
an antenna linked to an electronic chip and this antenna 
allows them responding to requests sent from the reader. 
RFID system is illustrated in Figure 2.  
Figure 2. RFID system (reader+tag) 
Indeed, a set of RFID readers that are equipped with 
several types of antennas are placed in order to cover the 
entire desired area. This zone is then subdivided into cells 
with varied surfaces according to the power of the deployed 
readers and their number. If a person equipped with RFID 
tag is located in these zones, it will be possible that the 
system calculates its position based on the number of readers 
detecting the tag, and it will be able to deduce the 
approximate location of the individual on the basis of the 
established cutting diagram [25]. However, this technique 
remains very approximate in real time and its exactitude will 
only specify the hallway or the part where the person exists. 
This geolocalization technique is especially employed in 
hospitals as RFID readers can be positioned in the building 
doors in order to indicate if a person, equipped with a tag, is 
going through them. Then, we will choose to use powerful 
readers and passive tags, because they are characterized by a 
low cost and a small size and their functional lifetime is 
important. Each tag will be associated with an anchor and 
each time it will be awake by a reader, a dialogue will be 
established and data will be exchanged. An update of this 
anchor position will be made and we will be able to use it in 
order to geolocate the patients. Figure 3 shows this principle. 
 
Figure 3. Data transmission procedure 
In the field of WSN geolocalization, we always try to 
guarantee a better precision with a low energy consumption 
and lower cost. We try then to benefit from the advantages of 
the various existed positioning methods and we propose a 
new algorithm which solves the problems of the constraints 
satisfaction. This algorithm must find the most economical 
path and ensure a prolongation of the nodes lifetime [26]. 
Our approach consists in proposing an algorithm based on 
DV-Hop which is considered as a typical example of the 
category of methods that are at once distributed, anchor-
based and range-free [4]. Indeed, the DV-Hop method is not 
precise enough [22]. Thus, the localization accuracy must be 
further improved. Then, we seek to guarantee the reduction 
of our algorithm cost and to ensure assessment of the 
network load caused by the protocol which is associated with 
this algorithm. Consequently, we propose a new algorithm in 
order to realize a satisfactory compromise between location 
accuracy and computation complexity. Our improved DV-
Hop (Intersect DV-Hop) consists of four steps. The first two 
steps are the same as the DV-Hop method, while others are 
specific to our proposal.

In step one, all nodes in the network get the minimal hop 
number to every anchor. In step two, after obtaining the hop-
size, anchor node broadcasts its hop-size to network as a 
correction. In fact, at this point, each normal node Nx knows 
its hopi,Nx, which represents the minimal hop number from 
Nx to Ai. Each anchor Ai has also obtained hopi,k, which is 
the minimal hop number to any other anchor Ak. So, Ai can 
calculate its average distance per hop dhpi, and then 
broadcasts dhpi through the network. After receiving dhpi, 
the normal node Nx can use (6) to get di,Nx, which is the 
approximate distance between each anchor Ai and Nx.

Our aim in the third step is to determine the closest three 
anchors to the normal node Nx by comparing the 
approximate distances obtained at the end of the previous 
step. The node is then located in the coverage area of cells of 
these anchors. Let A1(x, y), A2 (x1, y1) and A3(x2, y2) be 
these three beacons, knowing that d1,Nx< d2,Nx< d3,Nx.  
 
 
Figure 4. Principle of Intersect DV-Hop 
We assume that the communication ranges of anchors are 
all the same as displayed by the circles of Figure 4. The 
normal node Nx locates in the overlapping communication 
region of A1 A2 A3. We determine then at the last step the 
intersection of the three circles of Figure 4 that their centers 
are respectively A1, A2 and A3 and their radius are 
respectively d1,Nx ,d2,Nx and d3,Nx. Finally we calculate S, 
which is the final estimated position of Nx. If the coordinates 
of three anchors A1 A2 A3 are (x, y), (x1, y1), and (x2, y2) and 
in the case where A1 is considered as the origin of the 
coordinates system, the cross point S of the three circles can 
then be calculated as displayed by (7). Finally, S becomes 
Nx’s estimated position which is the result of our proposed 
method.

SIMULATION RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 
 
In this section, simulation results are presented and 
analyzed. The obtained results during the evaluation of the 
DV-Hop algorithm and the suggested improvement will be 
presented. To achieve our simulations and to study our 
approach performance, we have developed the Matlab 
software. The sensor network that we have simulated 
comprises 100 sensors (ordinary nodes and anchors) which 
are dispersed in a zone with the fixed size of 100 X 100 m2 
(Figure 5). They are deployed according to a random 
distribution in order to test the performances of the proposed 
algorithm under conditions more similar to those real. The 
random placement of the anchors allows measuring our 
approach exactitude in a more realistic context.

Figure 5. Random distribution of the sensors 
The two most important parameters in our work are the 
error and the precision of localization. According to the 
various research studies already realized concerning the 
anchors influence on positioning, it was noted that the 
exactitude increases with the increase of anchors number. 
Therefore, we are interested in evaluating the variation of the 
precision and the error according to the number of employed 
anchors. The radio range of the sensors (R) indicates the 
communication range of nodes, which generally varies 
between 10 and 100 meters. Assuming the absence of the 
obstacles and the multiple paths, the antennas are considered 
to be ideal and the nodes keep the same radio range 
modulated by a circle that surrounds each sensor.  
In our work, R is set to 50 meters. To quantify the 
accuracy of a geolocalization method, we consider the 
localization error it makes. Even for the best techniques, an 
inevitable error is associated with each one of them. In our 
simulations, it is regarded as the distance separating the real

node position and that calculated using the geolocalization 
technique. The more this distance is considerable, the less 
the system is accurate. So, we consider the metric 
geolocation error (expressed in radio range percentage) for 
evaluating the performance of geolocalization accuracy. 
Geolocation error is defined as distance (estimated location, 
true location)/NB×100%. Here, distance (estimated location, 
true location) is the distance between a node’s estimated 
position and its true position and NB is the number of 
sensors. 
An anchor ratio is defined as the ratio of the number of 
anchors on the total number of nodes which is set to 100. In 
other words, it is the ratio of anchors among the network 
nodes. These ratios vary from 3% to 60%. We have 
simulated four algorithms: our Intersect DV-Hop algorithm 
and three existing algorithms, which are DV-Hop, Checkout 
DV-Hop [8] and Mid-Perpendicular algorithm [3]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 6. Geolocation error 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 7. Geolocation accuracy 
Through Figure 6, we can see that the average error of 
our algorithm is lower than that of other techniques. Then, 
we can conclude that the new method achieve better 
performance than Mid-Perpendicular, Checkout DV-Hop 
and DV-Hop. This idea is confirmed and also shown in 
Figure 7, which presents the positioning accuracy depending 
on ratio of anchor nodes for the four algorithms. We can 
notice that increasing the number of anchors guarantee the 
reduction of the localization error. For the same ratio of 
anchor nodes, position error is smaller when our improved 
method is applied in the same WSN environment than the 
DV-Hop algorithm and the two others. For example, with 10 
anchor nodes (10%), Intersect DV-Hop has an average error 
of about 42% R, while the others are more than 51% R. 
When the number of used anchors increases to 50, the error 
decreases and becomes 17%. In this case, the geolocalization 
errors of the other algorithms are approximately more than 
42%. It is clear from our simulations that the improvement 
provided by this new method is effective and that our 
algorithm is more accurate than the others, already 
mentioned. The Intersect DV-Hop performance exceeds the 
original DV-Hop location algorithm performance from our 
simulations results. 
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS 
 
In this paper, we proposed a new geolocalization 
algorithm for wireless sensor networks based on the DV-Hop 
algorithm. It was shown from the simulation results that our 
proposed algorithm can improve location accuracy than the 
original 
DV-Hop, 
Checkout 
DV-Hop 
and 
Mid-
Perpendicular. The proposed method adopts the distance 
reliability information to improve the convergence rate and 
the location accuracy using a geometric approach and 
adaptive iterative process. We have to find a solution to 
fulfill this paper objective, which consists in proposing a 
method of tracking and monitoring patients in order to 
determine their geographic locations inside a medical 
environment. Our suggested approach is mainly based on the 
improvement of the DV-Hop performance with the use of 
RFID technique that seems very beneficial in this case. It 
was shown that our contribution is interesting and that it 
guarantees a good improvement in the geolocalization 
accuracy. To accomplish our work, we aim to test our 
solution on the practical level. In fact, this test will put it 
under more real conditions and consequently we can refine 
the searched locations. Finally, we also aim to propose a 
strategy that guarantees the obtaining of solutions in real 
time once the problem is disturbed by the failures of some 
nodes.
