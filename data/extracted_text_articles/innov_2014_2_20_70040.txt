INTRODUCTION
Wireless
communications
can
be
regarded
as
the
most important development that has an extremely wide
range of applications. In this new information age, high
data
rate
and
reliability
features
are
required
for
any
wireless communication system. MIMO-OFDM (Multiple
Input Multiple Output - Orthogonal Frequency Division
Multiplexing)
is
the
most
recent
wireless
broadband
technology. This technology has gained great popularity for
its capability of high rate transmission and its robustness
against multi-path fading and other channel impairments.
Therefore, the combinaison between MIMO and OFDM
systems is proposed in 802.11n [1].
The OFDM [2] became a very popular multi-carrier
modulation
technique
for
transmission
of
signals
over
wireless channels. It converts a frequency-selective fading
channel into different parallel ﬂat fading sub-channels, thanks
to the FFT’s algorithm (Fast Fourier Transform) [3]. The
inverse FFT algorithm (IFFT) [3] is also used to demodulate
the message at the receiver. Hence, the bandwidth is utilized
efﬁciently in OFDM systems without causing the Inter-Carrier
Interference (ICI). OFDM combines multiple low-data-rate
subcarriers into high-data-rate with a long symbol duration in
order to eliminate the Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI).
MIMO exploits the space dimension to improve wireless
systems capacity, range and reliability. It offers signiﬁcant
increases in data throughput and link range without additional
bandwidth or increased transmit power. MIMO achieves
this goal by spreading the same total transmit power over
the antennas to achieve an array gain that improves the
spectral efﬁciency (Spatial Multiplexing (SM)) or to achieve
a diversity gain that improves the link reliability (Space Time
Coding (STC)).
The SM transmits independent data rates over different Nt
transmit antennas in order to increase the throughput between
the transmitter and the receiver. Foshini [4] has shown that
the theoretical capacity of the MIMO channel, with Nt
transmit antennas and Nr receive antennas, increases linearly
with min(Nt,Nr). The STC is increasing the performance by
sending redundant data over different transmit antennas [5].
In this paper, the MIMO-OFDM system is based on the
STC technique. In order to improve the link reliability, we
will focus on Space-Time Block Code (STBC) Alamouti
code [6] [7].
A major challenge for MIMO-OFDM system is the
synchronization between transmitter and receiver. Two types
of synchronization are necessary, namely, the timing and the
frequency synchronization. The coarse timing synchronization
is to detect the beginning of the OFDM frame and the ﬁne
timing synchronization is used for coherent detection of
OFDM symbols. The frequency synchronization is to correct
the phase error caused by the mismatch of the local oscillator
(LO) between transmitter and receiver [8]. In this paper, we
will focus on timing synchronization.
In the literature, several synchronization approaches have
been proposed for MIMO-OFDM systems [9] [10]. Most
of the timing synchronization methods are preamble based.
Therefore, the synchronization preamble should have a good
correlation function in order to detect the packet arrival at the
receiver.
In this work, based on [11], we propose a new tim-
ing synchronization method for MIMO-OFDM systems with
CAZAC sequences. Furthermore, Constant Amplitude Zero
Auto-Correlation (CAZAC) sequence [12] has constant am-
plitude and zero autocorrelation for all non-zero shifts. The
main characteristics of CAZAC sequences are their correlation
functions. They have a good autocorrelation function and their

crosscorrelation function is near zero. Due to their orthogonal-
ity, CAZAC sequences reduce inter-code interference between
multiple antennas and have a lower Peak-to-Average Power
Ratio (PAPR). As a result, CAZAC sequences are regarded
as optimum preamble for timing synchronization in MIMO-
OFDM systems.
Based on CAZAC sequences, a compact preamble design
for synchronization in distributed MIMO-OFDM systems
has been proposed in [10]. Training symbols, based on
exclusive subband, have designed. The main drawback of
this approach is the number of transmit antennas. When
this number is increased, the length of the synchronization
sequence decreases, and hence, the timing synchronization
performance decreases. As result, [10] shows a good timing
synchronization with an SNR of 15dB. Furthermore, using
the same simulation parameters and the same propagation
channel delay, our proposed method shows a perfect timing
synchronization against the proposed method in [10] at low
SNR.
The aim of this paper is to present a new timing synchro-
nization method for MIMO-OFDM systems with CAZAC se-
quences. Section II brieﬂy describes the MIMO-OFDM system
structure based on STBC. Our proposed method and preamble
structure are presented in Section III. Simulation results and
conclusion are done in Section IV and V respectively.
II.
SYSTEM MODEL
The combinaison of MIMO and OFDM systems is one of
the most effective techniques to improve spectral efﬁciency of
radio communications. In Figure 1, we consider a MIMO sys-
tem using OFDM modulation and Nsc subcarriers per transmit
antenna, where the transmitter and receiver are respectively
provided with Nt and Nr antennas (Nt, Nr ∈ {2, 4, 8}).
In the following, we describe the MIMO-OFDM system
presented in Figure 1.
A parallel data stream is passed through a digital
modulator. This modulator encodes the data stream with
16-QAM constellation. The complex symbols are then fed
into an STBC encoder in order to encode the data stream with
Alamouti encoder. Then, symbols pass through the OFDM
modulator. This modulator can be done by using a simple
Inverse Fast Fourrier Transform (IFFT) algorithm. In which,
the output signal of OFDM modulator, is in time domain. After
the IFFT, a Guard Interval (GI) block is presented in order to
append the Cyclic Preﬁx (CP) at the beginning of each OFDM
symbol. It refers to a copy of the last portion of the OFDM
symbol appended to the front of the symbol, in order to reduce
the ISI. Letting Ts is the total symbol period (Ts = Tg + Tu),
Tg is the period of cyclic preﬁx, Tu is the period of useful data.
The synchronization block is used in order to insert
a known synchronization preamble at the beginning of
each OFDM frame. This block could be presented in time
domain [13] or in frequency domain [11]. In this paper,
we focus in the second approach. At the receiver, the
synchronization is performed in the time domain.
The second part of MIMO-OFDM system is the receiver.

The ﬁrst block of the receiver is the synchronization block.
This block is presented in time domain. After a good synchro-
nization, a CP removal block is applied in order to remove the
CP from the beginning of each OFDM symbol. The OFDM
symbols are demodulated using FFT algorithm. Equalizer
and channel estimator are the ﬁrst two blocks in frequency
domain in order to estimate and detect the channel coefﬁcients.
After equalization, the STBC encoder is implemented using
Alamouti decoder. After the QAM demodulator, we get the
data stream.
A. Transmitted signal
At transmitter, xk is the symbol on the frequency fk.
The OFDM transmit signal si(t) transmitted over ith transmit
antenna can be expressed as follows [14]:

where Nsc is the number of sub-carriers.
B. Channel
The transmitted signal reaches the receiver, by undergoing
many effects, over several different paths. The multipaths
fading channel between transmit antenna Ti, i ∈ {1, Nt} and
receive antenna Rj, j ∈ {1, Nr}, is written as:
hi,j(τ, t) =
Pij

where αp(t) is the attenuation factor for the signal received
on the pth path with the propagation delay τp(t).
C. Received signal
The transmitted signal si(t) from ith transmit antenna
undergoes fading by the channel before reaching the jth
receive antenna. The received signal rj(t) is written as:
rj(t) =

PROPOSED METHOD
Based on Rachini et al. [11], a new timing synchronization
preamble is presented, in this section. This structure is used in order to
estimate the beginning of the OFDM received frame and to detect the
beginning of useful OFDM symbols in each frames. This preamble
structure is generated in the frequency domain, as shown in Figure 2.
Let i is the transmit antenna in MIMO-OFDM system and C is
a CAZAC sequence. C is given by the following equation:
C(k) =

where LC = LF F T /2 is the length of the CAZAC sequence, n ∈ N,
M ∈ N is a prime number with LC and k ∈ {0, LC − 1} is the
index of the sample.
In this structure, we combined a CAZAC sequence with its
conjugate. This combinaison gives a time-domain complex envelope
form that have a good cross-correlation and autocorrelation functions.
This combination retains the orthogonality between different pream-
bles over different transmit antennas. Figure 3 shows the preamble
structure in time domain.

In Figure 4, each preamble contains a CAZAC sequence C
mapped on the odd subcarrier and the conjugate of C is mapped on
the even subcarrier.
At receiver, a correlation function is applied between the received
signal rj and the local sequence seqj, in order to detect the timing
synchronization peak. The correlation function Rrj,seqj is calculated
as:
Rrj,seqj(n) =
L
X
n=1
[rj(n) ∗ seqj(n − τ)]
(5)
where n is the index of the sample, equivalent to the subcarrier
index.
The timing synchronization estimator, d
indn, is given by:
d
indn = argmax
n
{∥Rrj,seqj(n)∥}
(6)
The d
indn is the timing estimate where n is considered as the
timing synchronization point.

SIMULATION RESULT
Simulation results have been conducted to validate the perfor-
mance of the proposed preamble structure, in both AWGN channel
and multipaths fading channel. In order to evaluate the performance
of our proposed preamble against [10], a SISO-OFDM and MIMO-
OFDM systems up to 8 × 8 transmit and receive antennas were
simulated.
A. Simulation parameters
An OFDM system was developed, with 512 and 1024 subcarriers
(LF F T = 512, LF F T = 1024 resp.) was considered in Rayleigh
multipaths fading channel with 6 paths sample-spaced with Ts (Sam-
pling Time) suggested by the IEEE 802.11 Working Group [15]. The
parameters used for the simulations are summarized in Tables I and II.

The correlation function Rrj,seqj, at the jth receive antenna,
is calculated in time domain. Due to the frequency distribution of
CAZAC sequence, C and C∗, in each preamble, the Rrj,seqj may
have a high peak’s value. The timing synchronization estimator, d
indn,
detects the beginning of each OFDM received frame once the value
of the correlation peak reaches a deﬁned threshold value.
B. Results
In this section, the acquisition probability (PSY NC) is evaluated
in term of different value of SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio). PSY NC
represents the probability of successful timing synchronization. Sim-
ulation parameters are shown in Tables I and II.

Figure 5 represents the acquisition probability, in term of SNR,
for different OFDM systems (SISO-OFDM 1 × 1, MIMO-OFDM up
to 8 × 8) using CAZAC sequences where the length of preamble is
LF F T = 1024.
Figure 5 presents a good timing synchronization for a low
SNR. For an SNR = −5dB, the PSY NC ≥ 90% for all MIMO-
OFDM system up to 8 × 8. Therefore, for an SNR = 0dB, the
proposed timing synchronization preamble shows a perfect timing
synchronization for SISO-OFDM system. The PSY NC ≥ 97% for
MIMO-OFDM system 2×2 for the same SNR. For a MIMO-OFDM
system 4 × 4 the PSY NC ≥ 96% at an SNR = 5dB. On the other
hand, for MIMO-OFDM system 8 × 8, the acquisition probability
PSY NC reaches 98% at an SNR = 10dB.
Figure 6 presents the performance of our synchronization
preamble of length LF F T = 512. In this Figure, the acquisition
probability PSY NC is greater than 97% for both SISO-OFDM
and MIMO-OFDM 2 × 2 systems at an SNR = 0 dB. Therefore,
PSY NC ≥ 90% for MIMO-OFDM 4×4 system at an SNR = 0dB.
In the other hand, the PSY NC reaches 80% at an SNR = 5 dB for
MIMO-OFDM system8 × 8.

In Table III, the simulation results of Figures 5 and

are summarized. It can be shown that the performance of our
timing

method
increases
with
the
length
of
LF F T . Moreover, the results of Figure 5 (LF F T = 1024) show a
good performance against those presented in Figure 6 (LF F T = 512).
In order to evaluate the performance of our proposed method,
we conducted an extensive comparison of our approach with the
synchronization scheme of [10]. Hung and Chin [10] Wang used
a subband-based preamble based on CAZAC sequences. The main
drawback of this method is the number of transmit antennas. As the
number of transmit antennas increases, the length of synchronization
sequence, on each transmit antenna, decreases. Therefore, the value
of the synchronization peak at the receiver decreases.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The major challenges in MIMO-OFDM communication systems
are the synchronization and the channel estimation. In this paper,
we proposed a new timing synchronization preamble structure, based
on [11], in order to detect the timing frame synchronization. At the
receiver, a correlation function, between received signal and local
sequence, is applied in order to detect the beginning of OFDM
received frames. Hence, due to the combination of CAZAC sequence
C and C∗ in the synchronization preamble, the correlation function
shows a good frame detection as the number of transmit antenna
increases. Simulation results of our proposed method presents good
timing frame synchronization against the subband-based preamble
timing synchronization method in [10]. Therefore, this preamble
structure shows a good timing acquisition probability at a low SNR.
