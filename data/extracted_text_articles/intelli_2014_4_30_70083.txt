Abstract—Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) is one of the most 
deployable methods for detecting and predicting incipient 
faults in power transformers. For predicting faults, DGA uses 
tools such as Doernenburg, Rogers and IEC methods. The 
presence of missing values in a DGA dataset may affect the 
diagnostic performances of these three methods. This study 
applies the 
mean, regression, expectation-maximization, 
multiple imputation, and k-nearest neighbor methods to 
replace the missing values with estimated values in a DGA 
dataset. Using the number of unresolved diagnoses, the 
number of wrong diagnoses, and the number of correct 
diagnoses as the criteria to evaluate the effects of the 
imputation methods on the DGA diagnostic methods, this 
study 
shows 
that 
k-nearest 
neighbor 
increases 
the 
performances of  Doernenburg, Rogers and IEC methods the 
most on two datasets with actual missing values. Experimental 
results show that imputing missing values in DGA datasets has 
increased diagnostic performance of the three ratios methods 
of DGA

 INTRODUCTION  
Power transformers are a must-have item for any power 
utility company to increase or decrease electrical power for 
transmission and distribution throughout interconnected 
power systems. Because of prolonged usage and as 
transformers age, their internal conditions degrade when 
faults such as short-circuit, arcing, partial discharges or 
overheating occur during operations. These faults will 
release several gases commonly known as the fault gases: 
hydrogen (H2), acetylene (C2H2), ethylene (C2H4), methane 
(CH4), ethane (C2H6), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon 
dioxide (CO2) that stay dissolved at above threshold values 
in the insulating oil of a transformer. A faulty transformer 
must be removed from operation, sent for repair and/or 
replaced. These processes are costly and time-consuming  
but are necessary because if left unattended for long, a faulty 
transformer may trigger worse impacts such as explosions, 
loss of human lives, or environmental disasters. Recognizing 
the need for checking the serviceability of transformers, most 
utility companies perform preventive maintenance either 
periodically or conditionally to detect these faults.    
      Among the many existing techniques to detect these 
faults, Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) is recognized as the 
most effective method and is practiced universally today [1]. 
It involves a few sequence processes as follows: a) sampling 
of oil from the transformer, b) extracting the fault gases 
dissolved in the oil, c) calculating and analyzing the 
concentration of these gases, their gassing rates and the 
ratios of certain gases d) finally, the identification of the 
fault types. Currently, traditional diagnostic tools such as 
Key Gas [1], IEC ratios [2], Rogers ratios [1], Doernenburg 
ratios [1] and Duval Triangle [3] are widely used in the 
fourth process of DGA method. These ratio methods 
identify fault types using the ratios of certain fault gases and 
each ratio is assigned to one or more numerical thresholds. 
These thresholds are coded and mapped to specific faults. 
However, in some cases, gas concentrations may be 
incomplete which lead to combination of ratios that do not 
match any predefined threshold. As a result, fault that 
occurs inside a transformer may be classified unknown or 
inconclusive - a well-known shortcoming of the DGA ratios 
methods as documented in [4].  
       One of the reasons for incomplete gas concentrations is  
missing values for some of the fault gases. Missing values in 
DGA occur for various reasons, such as acetylene 
evaporates quickly, or the existence of contamination on the 
surface of the platinum alloy of a gas meter, and some 
transformer faults generate only a few fault gases [2]. Such 
samples containing missing values were usually manually 
deleted and excluded from subsequent analysis [5-6]. 
Majority reported only complete-case samples of DGA data 
[7-9]. Only researchers in [10] estimated the missing values 
in a DGA dataset using Support Vector Machine regression, 
which increased the accuracy of their Naive-Bayes 
classification algorithm. However, there are very few 
published literature concerning missing value estimation for 
DGA data especially with the objective of improving the 
diagnostic performance of the gas ratio methods. On the 
other hand, certain fields such as microarray analysis [11-
12], medical [13-14], and social sciences [15-16] have paid 
more attention to this issue. Consequently, statistical 
analyses or machine learning algorithms that were 
subsequently applied after filling in  the missing values have 
shown better  results. 
      The aforementioned scenario  motivates us to fill-in the 
missing values in DGA datasets with estimated values 
("imputing") to minimize the inconclusive diagnoses of the

gas ratio methods. Fortunately, there are many imputation 
methods to choose from [11,17-19], ranging from simple to 
complex solutions, and statistical to machine learning 
methods. In this paper, we propose imputing missing values 
in a DGA dataset using a few established methods 
Mean/mode (MEAN), linear regression (REG), expectation-
maximization (EM), multiple imputation (MI) and k nearest 
neighbour algorithm (kNN) are the selected imputation 
methods, and Rogers ratios, Doernenburg ratios, IEC ratios 
are the DGA ratios methods to diagnose the transformer 
faults. A "before and after" experiment is conducted to 
compare the diagnostic performance of each ratio method 
applied on the original datasets with missing values and that 
applied on the complete datasets imputed by each 
imputation method. 
     In Section II, we provide related work on missing values 
and the application of imputation methods. Section III we 
briefly described the DGA method and its ratio-based 
diagnostic methods. The compared imputation methods are 
described in Section IV. Section V presents and analysed 
experimental results. Section VI concludes our findings. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
     According to [17], a missing value indicates a lack of 
response. “Don’t know”, “Refused”, “Unintelligible”, and 
“Nil” are some of the possible codes for missing values in a 
dataset. However, why worry about missing values? Two 
major negative effects are reported in [20]. First, missing 
values reduce statistical power. Second, missing values 
could result in biased statistical estimates in several ways. 
Before deciding which imputation are suitable for the 
incomplete datasets, researchers should ask whether the 
pattern of missing observations is random or not ("patterns 
of missingness"). Little and Rubin [21] distinguished 
randomness 
into 
the 
following 
categories: 
Missing 
Completely at Random (MCAR), Missing at Random 
(MAR), and Not Missing at Random (NMAR).  
      MCAR exists when value(s) are missing because of 
uncontrolled events, which are totally independent of the 
potential values of both the observed and the missing 
variables. In the case of DGA data, acetylene is a very 
soluble and reactive gas, and disappears fast from 
absorption; thus, acetylene sometimes does not appear in the 
collection sample. On the other hand, when data are MAR, 
the probability of a missing value on some variables is 
dependent on the value of the observed variables. However, 
the missing value itself is not the cause for the missing. For 
DGA data, a fault such as high-energy arcing releases high 
quantities of hydrogen and acetylene. Such a pattern is 
considered to be MAR, and most missing data treatment 
methods are assumed to be MAR Finally, NMAR occurs 
when the probability of missing a value is a function of the 
value itself. NMAR is very unlikely to appear in DGA data; 
because gases are released as a result of faults in power 
transformer. 
    Statistical analysis with missing data has been noted in 
the literature for more than 70 years. Walks [22] initiated a 
study 
on 
the 
maximum 
likelihood 
estimation 
for 
multivariate normal models with fragmentary data. 
Thereafter, extensive discussions on this topic continue. A 
useful reference for general parametric statistical inferences 
with missing data can be found in Little and Rubin [23]. 
Litwise deletion (LD), pairwise deletion (PD), REG, 
MEAN, EM, and MI are some statistical tools available for 
imputing missing values. LD and PD are deficient in several 
aspects. Despite their simplicity, both are inefficient  [24-
25]. LD, in particular, can discard an enormous amount of 
potentially useful data. PD may be more efficient than LD in 
many cases, but for some data structures it is known to be 
less efficient [26]. MEAN, because of its simplicity, is 
commonly used in the social sciences as a fast alternative to 
LD [14]. Also, it is often used as a base for other proposed 
imputation methods such as in [27-28]. EM and MI, 
currently represent the state of the art, have been applied to 
various problem domains. Researchers in [29] estimated the 
missing values of leaf area index , a biophysical variable, 
using EM and helped reduce the root mean square error of 
the Gaussian Bayes Network output. In the medical field 
[13], MI was found to preserve observed and real data better 
than complete-case and dropping a particular variable 
approaches when predicting for deep venous thrombosis in 
patients. 
     Machine learning algorithms have also garnered large 
followings as the choice for data imputation. The Naive 
Bayes classifier, which is the least sensitive to missing data, 
learns effectively without the need to treat missing values, 
especially if the missing rate is less than 30%. It makes full 
use of the observed data and, thus, is the most adaptive to 
missing data [30]. In [31], kNN was used to impute missing 
values in software project datasets. They found that the k-
NN imputation can improve the prediction accuracy of 
C4.5, particularly if the missing data percentage exceeds 
40%.  A comparison of various imputation machine learning 
methods has also been published [32].  They concluded that  
self-organizing map and multi-layer perceptron performed 
slightly better than regression-based imputation and nearest 
neighbour method. Comparisons were performed between  
statistical and machine learning imputation methods in [14] 
for imputing missing values in breast cancer datasets. Their 
findings show that machine learning based imputation 
methods outperformed the statistical ones.

DISSOLVED GAS ANALYSIS 
During 
normal 
operation, 
oil-insulated 
power 
transformers produce gases such as hydrogen and 
hydrocarbon, albeit in very small quantities. However, when 
they 
experience 
electrical 
disturbances 
or 
thermal 
decomposition, the chemical reactions of the insulation 
involves the breaking down of carbon-hydrogen and carbon-
carbon bonds. During this process, active hydrogen atoms 
and hydrocarbon fragments are formed. These fragments

can combine with each other to form gases: hydrogen, 
methane, acetylene, ethylene, ethane, carbon monoxide, and 
carbon dioxide. These gases are usually referred to as the 
fault gases, which stay dissolved at above threshold values 
in the presence of fault(s). The composition of these 
dissolved gases is dependent on the type of faults that occur 
as shown in Table 1 of some common power transformer 
faults. 
      DGA uses this strong relationship between certain 
combination of dissolved gases and their associated fault as 
the underlying principle in identifying incipient faults in 
power transformer. In general, a DGA dataset is built by 
taking oil samples over a period of time at regular interval to 
discern trends and to determine the severity and progression 
of incipient faults. Generally, daily or weekly sampling is 
recommended after start-up, followed by monthly or longer 
intervals. Routine sampling intervals may vary depending 
on application and individual system requirements [1]. 
      This study briefly describes the ratio-based diagnostic 
methods mentioned in the Section I that map the dissolved 
gases found in the oil sample with corresponding fault. 
Compared to other tools, these ratios methods have become 
a standard to diagnose fault based on DGA results [1]. 
These methods employ an array of ratios of certain key 
combustible gases as the fault type indicators. These five 
ratios are: 
Ratio 1 (R1) = CH4/H2 
Ratio 2 (R2) = C2H2/C2H4 
Ratio 3 (R3) = C2H2/CH4 
Ratio 4 (R4) = C2H6/C2H2 
Ratio 5 (R5) = C2H4/C2H6

A. Doernenburg Ratios 
     This method suggests the existence of three general fault 
types namely, thermal, partial discharge, and arcing. This 
method requires significant levels of the gases to be present 
in order for the diagnosis to be valid. The method utilizes 
Ratios 1, 2, 3, and 4 and  the ratios in the order Ratio 1, 
Ratio 2, Ratio 3, and Ratio 4 are compared to limiting 
values, providing a suggested fault diagnosis as given in 
Table 2.  
B. Rogers Ratios 
     This method utilizes Ratios 1, 2, and 5. The method does 
not depend on specific gas concentrations to exist in the 
transformer for the diagnosis to be valid. However, it 
suggests that the method be used only when the normal 
limits of the individual gases have been exceeded. Table 3 
gives the values for the three key gas ratios corresponding to 
suggested diagnoses.  
C. IEC Ratios 
This method also utilizes the same three Ratios 1, 2, and 5 
as in the revised version of Rogers Ratios. The key 
differences are  the range of code assigned to each ratio and 
the number of suggested faults.  The IEC Ratios fault 
interpretations can be divided into 9 different types and they 
are shown in Table 4. 
IV. 
METHODOLOGY OF  STUDY 
This study imputes the missing values found a DGA 
datasets using the four established methods mentioned in the 
Introduction section with the objective of reducing the 
inconclusive diagnoses of the gas ratio methods. Fig. 1 
shows the methodology of this study in meeting this 
objective. 
A. Mean Imputation 
One of the most frequently used methods. This method 
consists of replacing the missing data for a given attribute by 
the mean (quantitative attribute) or mode (qualitative 
attribute) of all known values of that attribute. This study 
chose the mean because DGA datasets contains continuous 
variables. It is easy to execute as well as suitable for all 
patterns of missingness. However, this approach also 
introduces biases. The main reasons are that it shifts the 
possible extreme values back to the middle of the 
distribution, and it reduces variances in the variable being 
imputed. 
Sample 
sizes may 
be 
overestimated 
and 
correlations may be negatively biased, also, when applying 
this technique [17]. 
B. Regression Imputation 
     This can be accomplished by regressing the variable with 
missing data on other variables in the data set for those 
cases with complete data. The estimated regression equation 
is then used to generate predicted values for the cases with 
missing data. This technique assumes that the data are MAR 
or MCAR, which makes it suitable for imputing DGA

datasets. There is, however, a general tendency to produce 
underestimates 
of 
variances 
and 
overestimates 
of 
correlations [33]. 
C. Expectation Maximization 
This algorithm was introduced by [34]. It capitalises on the 
relationship between missing data and the unknown 
parameters of a data model. The basic algorithm consists of 
two steps: expectation (E step) and maximization (M step). 
First, separate the data into missing and observed, and 
establish starting values for the parameters ( mean, variance, 
and covariance). In the E step, using these parameters, 
compute the predicted scores for the missing data (the 
expectation). In the M step, using the predicted scores for 
the missing data, maximize the likelihood function to obtain 
new parameter estimates. Repeat the process until 
convergence is obtained. EM assumes that the data are 
MAR. EM requires a fairly large sample for the estimates to 
be approximately unbiased and normally distributed [17]. 
D. Multiple Imputation 
This method was proposed by Rubin [35] in 1987. The 
whole MI procedure is made of three steps. They are 
imputation, analysis, and pooling processes. We applied only 
the first step, imputation process, of the three steps because our 
interest is to fill in missing values with estimated values. This 
simulation method replaces each missing value with m > 1 
plausible values, which are drawn randomly from their 
predictive distribution. m is the number of repetition. 
Imputing a missing value with m simulated values produces 
m apparently completed datasets and then the mean of m 
imputed values was filled in the missing value. Post-
imputation, MI allows analysts to proceed with familiar 
complete-data techniques and software. Another positive 
point is that a large number of repetitions is not always 
necessary to obtain precise estimates. For example, with 
50% missing information, m = 10 imputations is efficient. 
However, like EM, MI does rely on large sample 
approximations but works better than EM in small to 
moderate sample sizes. MI also assumes that the missing 
data are MAR [17]. 
E. kNN Imputation  
We use the k-NN algorithm to determine the imputed data, 
where nearest is usually defined in terms of a distance

function based on the auxiliary variable(s). In this method a 
pool of complete instances is found for each incomplete 
instance, and the imputed values for each missing cell in 
each recipient is calculated from the mean or median of  the 
respective attribute in complete instances. Mean is used with 
continuous attributes, whilst median is suitable for discrete 
attributes. This study chose mean as DGA dataset contains 
continuous variables. For the kNN method, two parameters 
need to be determined for achieving high estimation 
accuracy: the number of nearest neighbour (k) and the 
distance metric:  the choice of k, the number of neighbours 
used and the appropriate distance metric. Simulation results 
have demonstrated that for small datasets, k = 10 is the best 
choice [36], while [37] observed that k is insensitive to 
values of k in the range of 10-20. Therefore, this study 
replaced the missing values with estimated values from 1-10 
nearest neighbours depending on the size of datasets. The 
distance metric used was the Euclidean distance as adopted 
by [37].  
The advantages of the kNN imputation are [31]: 
 
It does not require to create a predictive model for each 
feature with missing data. 
 
It can treat both continuous and categorical values. 
 
It can easily deal with cases with multiple missing 
values. 
 
It takes into account the correlation structure of the 
data.

EXPERIMENTS AND RESULT 
A. DGA Datasets 
Two DGA datasets, with different percentages of actual 
missing values, are imputed and classified in this study. The 
first DGA dataset (named MAL) is obtained from  a local 
Malaysian 
utility 
company 
which 
manage 
various 
transformers located throughout Malaysia, whilst IECDB10 
[38] is the second. The characteristics of the datasets are 
shown in Table 5. A sample of DGA data consists of a 
number of dissolved gases in oil and the corresponding fault 
type as shown in Table 6. Dashes in Table 6 represents 
missing values ( missing gases). Using a gas chromatograph 
equipped with suitable adsorption columns, the dissolved 
gas concentrations are measured from the oil samples  in 
parts per million (ppm) by volume of (specific gas) in oil. 
B. Experimental setup 
      This study used SPSS [39] to impute missing values 
using the MEAN, REG, and EM methods. Meanwhile the 
MI and kNN methods were applied using SOLAS and 
MATLAB [40], respectively. For the EM method, a normal 
distribution ( the default) of the data was assumed and the 
default iterations (25) was adopted. This study chose normal 
variates as the random component to be added for the REG 
estimation task. For the MI method, this study chose m = 5 
because according to [16],  the MI method does not need a 
large number of  repetitions for precise estimates. Because 
both datasets in Table 5 were quite small in size, this study 
chose k=1,3,5,7,10  as explained in Section IX.E.

    After independently  filling in the missing values in DGA 
datasets using the compared methods, the three ratios 
methods were then run independently on each imputed 
dataset. The effectiveness of each imputation method were 
evaluated based on the number of unresolved diagnoses 
reported by each ratio method, the number of wrong 
diagnoses made by each method and the number of correct 
diagnoses predicted by each method.       
C. Case Study 1:IEC10 Dataset 
Table 7 shows the result of diagnoses for each k of the kNN 
method on the IEC10DB dataset for each DGA diagnostic 
method. It is observed that when k=1, all of the three ratios 
method gave the highest number of correct predictions. 
Similar observation was seen for the number of wrong 
diagnoses, all three methods were the least wrong when 
k=1. For the number of unresolved diagnoses, the Rogers 
and IEC reduced the unresolved cases the most when k=1, 
but Doernenburg did the same when k=5. Overall, higher 
values of k do not increase diagnostic performance of the 
ratio methods on this dataset. It can be explained that the 
inclusion of complete instances that are significantly 
different from the instance of interest can decrease accuracy 
because the neighborhood has become too large and not 
sufficiently relevant for the estimation task.    
 Table 8 shows the result of diagnoses for each ratio 
method on imputed datasets obtained from each imputation 
method compared in this study. INCOMPLETE is the 
results of diagnoses from each ratio method before the 
missing values were estimated by the comparative methods. 
For the kNN method, the result from k=1 was used for 
comparison with the other imputation methods. It can be 
safely said, for this dataset, replacing missing values with 
estimated values from each imputation method reduce the 
unresolved diagnoses compared to INCOMPLETE. The 
MEAN was the most effective in reducing the number of 
unresolved diagnosis for Doernenburg. For Rogers and IEC, 
it was the kNN. Consequently, the reduced statistics of 
unresolved lead to an increase or decrease of wrong and 
correct predictions for all of the ratio methods. It is seen 
that, among the compared imputation methods, kNN 
registered the highest number of correct guesses  and the 
least number of wrong diagnoses.  Interestingly, four 
methods (kNN, EM, MI, REG)  helped increase the 
diagnostic performance of all the ratios method in guessing 
correct faults compared to INCOMPLETE. MEAN however 
fared worst than INCOMPLETE when applied with Rogers 
and IEC but did better than INCOMPLETE in Doernenburg. 
Unfortunately, the number of wrong diagnoses increased for 
all ratios when combined with the imputation methods in

comparison with INCOMPLETE. But this is expected 
with the reduced number of unresolved diagnosis when 
imputed datasets were used for fault diagnosis. 
D. Case Study 2: MAL Dataset 
Table 9 shows the result of diagnoses for each k of the 
kNN  method on the MAL dataset for each DGA diagnostic 
method. It is observed that when k=3, two out of the three 
ratios method (Rogers and IEC) gave the highest number of 
correct predictions. The number of unresolved cases were 
reduced the most when k = 3. However, higher k ( 10 for 
Doernenburg and Rogers, and 5 for IEC) were needed to 
record lower wrong diagnoses. It can be said that for this 
dataset, the best k needed to improve the performance of 
each ratio method varies from one ratio method to another. 
If the number of unresolved guesses is the most important 
criterion in evaluating the effectiveness of the imputation 
method, than k = 3 was the best. Table 10 shows the result 
of diagnoses for each ratio method on imputed datasets 
obtained from each imputation method compared in this 
study. For the kNN method, the result from k=3 was used 
for comparison with the other imputation methods as it 
reduced unresolved diagnoses the most for all ratio methods. 
For this dataset, the effect of each imputation method in 
reducing 
the 
unresolved 
cases 
as 
compared 
to 
INCOMPLETE varies. While kNN, EM, MI, and REG met 
the aforementioned criterion for the three diagnostic 
method, MEAN, however, only did so for Doernenburg and 
IEC. For Rogers, MEAN increased the unresolved cases 
than INCOMPLETE. In increasing correct guesses against 
INCOMPLETE, only kNN, REG, and EM (albeit very 
slightly) were successful when paired with all of the three 
ratios individually. MEAN and MI had mixed results 
depending on the ratios used. Similar with IEC10DB 
dataset, kNN  registered the highest number of correct 
guesses and the least number of wrong diagnoses for all of 
the ratio methods on this dataset. This made kNN registered 
the highest number of wrong guesses because the reduction 
of unresolved were significantly huge compared to other 
imputation methods.   
E. Analysis 
As stated above, different experiments are executed on two 
different datasets and the results show that: 
a) imputing missing values in a DGA dataset reduce the 
number of unresolved diagnoses reported by the three 
established DGA ratios method when predicting the 
incipient fault in power transformer. Unresolved 
diagnoses are a well-known issue with the DGA ratio 
methods. 
b) among the established imputation methods, kNN has 
the best effect to the diagnostic performances of the 
three DGA ratio methods on both of the datasets. The 
number of unresolved cases were the least and correct 
diagnoses were the highest for both datasets. kNN also 
outperformed INCOMPLETE in these criteria. 
c) only REG and EM are as consistent as kNN in reducing 
the unresolved guesses produced by the ratios method 
on both dataset as well as in increasing the number of 
correct guesses when compared to INCOMPLETE. 
d) MI, and MEAN have varied effects to the diagnostic 
performances of the three ratios methods depending on 
the datasets used. However, MEAN is the worst 
performer especially in increasing the number of 
correct guesses for both datasets for two (Rogers and 
IEC)  ratio methods against INCOMPLETE. 
e) kNN outperforms the other methods is expected 
because estimated values are calculated from observed 
samples having the most similar characteristics with the 
sample of interest ( contains the missing value). kNN is 
a non-parametric method and requires no assumption 
with regards to pattern of missingness.  kNN takes 
account correlation among data structure which coulld 
be the reason behind its best performance . 
f) 
Interestingly, REG comes second to kNN. As 
mentioned in Section IX.B, REG is suitable for MCAR 
and MAR data. Using the chi-square test, both datasets 
are proved to be MCAR, with p-values <=0.001. This 
could be the possible reason behind the comparable 
performance of REG with kNN. 
g) EM and MI are state-of-the art imputation methods 
which motivate us to use them with DGA dataset. 
Experimental results show that they fare behind kNN 
and REG.  According to [16], both assume data are 
MAR. Because both DGA datasets are MCAR 
compliance, we assume this could be the reason behind 
the lesser quality of imputed values produced by them.  
h) For both datasets, EM performs better than MI. 
According to [16], MI estimates better on smaller 
datasets  than EM, but the results using DGA datasets 
were the opposite.  
i) 
Doernenbug method benefits the most from the 
imputing procedure where the number of correct 
guesses increase against INCOMPLETE for most of the 
72

experimental settings ( only MEAN failed in the MAL 
dataset). 
j) 
For IEC10DB, the combinations of kNN and Rogers 
ratio gives the highest correct guesses, whilst for MAL, 
they are kNN and IEC. 
 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
The main objective of this research was to investigate the 
effects of missing values imputation methods on the 
diagnostic performances of the Doernenburg, Rogers, and 
IEC for predicting the incipient faults of power 
transformers. From the experimental results, we can safely 
say that, in general, imputing missing values can reduce the 
number of unresolved diagnoses faced by the three 
diagnostic methods as shown by four out five methods 
compared in this study. However, the number of correct 
guesses obtained by the ratios methods vary according to the 
combination of imputation method and the ratio method. 
Some combinations increased the correct guesses than 
INCOMPLETE while other combinations did the opposite. 
It is to be expected that the number of wrong guesses 
increase with the reduced number of unresolved cases. It is 
found that kNN brings the best effect to the performances of 
the three ratio methods compared to the EM, MI, REG, and 
MEAN methods. The experimental results show that 
imputing missing values found in a DGA dataset can bring 
positive effects to the performance of three established 
DGA diagnostic methods especially in reducing unresolved 
diagnoses - a common drawback faced by these diagnostic 
methods. We would like to undertake the study on the 
impact of imputing missing values to the performance of 
machine learning algorithms that learn from historic DGA 
dataset to classify fault in power transformer for future 
research.
