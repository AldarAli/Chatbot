Abstract—When a ﬁber Bragg grating strain sensor is embedded
inside a structure, the interaction of the sensor with the host
material can lead to spurious results if the radial strain is
neglected. In this article, we use numerical simulations to show
that the axial and radial strains can be simultaneously measured
with a single ﬁber in which a Bragg grating and a long period
grating are superimposed. Moreover, we present an optimal
architecture of the sensor.

INTRODUCTION
Fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) are made of periodic modu-
lation of the refractive index of the core of an optical ﬁber.
As a consequence they behave as bandpass ﬁlters and reﬂect
a very narrow spectral band of the incoming light, centered
on the Bragg wavelength : λB = 2neﬀΛ0 where neﬀ is the
effective index of the light propagating inside the core and
Λ0 the period of the grating. Any change in the period of the
grating or in the effective index induces a shift in the Bragg
wavelength.
FBGs are often used as strain sensors (see for example [1]–
[5]). Indeed, when the ﬁber is strained, the period of the
grating is modiﬁed. Moreover, due to the photo-elastic effect,
the effective index also varies. What should be underlined is
that the variation of the effective index depends on the strains
in all directions. There is a tensorial relation between strain
and refractive index change.
When the ﬁber is glued at two points on the surface of the
monitored structure, its axial strain, ϵz, is exactly the same
as the strain of the structure. Moreover, as the ﬁber is free to
deform in the transverse plane, its radial strain ϵr is driven
by the axial strain: ϵr = −νϵz, where ν is the Poisson’s ratio
of the ﬁber. In this case, the axial strain is the only unknown
and the measurement of a single Bragg wavelength shift is then
sufﬁcient. This is why FBG strain sensors are usually mounted
at the surface of the structure.
When the ﬁber is embedded, it is not free anymore to
deform in the transverse plane. Its radial strain then depends in
a non trivial manner on the interaction between the ﬁber and
the host material. It can not be deduced simply from the axial
strain. Consider for example a sensor embedded in a cylinder
of heat hardening resin (Young modulus: 3100 MPa, Poisson’s
ration: 0.4; thermal expansion coefﬁcient: 114×10−6 K−1)
as used in the composite material. The initially liquid resin
is heated. During cooling, it imposes mechanical stress on
the ﬁber axially as well as radially. Assume that a drop of
100 K in temperature is imposed on the structure, with two
different boundary conditions (BC): BC 1: the cylinder is free
to undergo axial and radial deformation; BC 2: the cylinder
external surface is free to move radially while the upper and
lower sections are ﬁxed. Table I shows the calculated axial
and radial strains together with the radial strain that would
be measured by a single FBG under the assumption that:
ϵr = −νϵz. These results show that a single embedded FBG

gives at best approximate measurements (BC 1) and sometimes
erroneous measurements (BC 2). A real case is in between
BC 1 and BC 2. This underlines that the axial and the radial
strains must be simulteaneously determined. Then two linearly
independant measurements have to be performed at the same
point. It has been recently proposed to use the superposition
of a long and a short period grating to achieve this task [6]. In
this paper we study numerically more deeply this architecture
and show that some conﬁgurations can fullﬁll the following
requirements:
•
The sensor has to measure simultaneously the radial
and axial strains with the same precision on the axial
strain as the FBGs mounted on surface.
•
The transmission spectrum of the sensor has to exhibit
only two peaks in the range [1400 nm; 1600 nm], one
associated to the FBG and one to the Long Period
Grating (LPG) in order to avoid any ambiguity in the
order of the mode of the LPG.
•
The response of the sensor must be linear in the range
ϵr,z ∈ [− 5000 µϵ; + 5000 µϵ].
Section 2 is devoted to the description of the sensor and
of the principle of measurement. In Section 3, we present the
evolution of the behavior of the sensor as a function of relevant
parameters and we determine the best architectures. Then we
conclude and discuss brieﬂy the results in Section 4.

THE DUAL GRATING SENSOR
In this section, we present the structure of sensor and we
describe the principle of measurement.
A. Architecture of the sensor
The sensor is made of the juxtaposition of two gratings
of same length inside the core of a ﬁber, surrounded by two
concentric claddings (see Figure 1). Both gratings can be
written using UV light with the same phase mask technique.
The best is to write ﬁrst the Bragg grating with one mask and
then the long period grating with another mask [7].
We call a1 the radius of the core and n1 its refractive index,
a2 the radius of the inner cladding and n2 its index, and a3 the

radius of the external cladding and n3 its index. In order that
only one mode propagates in the core of the ﬁber, the values
of a1, n1 and n2 are ﬁxed to that of a classical SMF28 ﬁber:
a1 = 4.2 µm
and
n1 = 1.0036n2

0.069066µm, λ2 = 0.115662µm and λ3 = 9.900559µm [8].
The ﬁrst grating is a classical ﬁber Bragg grating. It reﬂects
a narrow bandwidth of the incoming light centered on the
Bragg wavelength λB. As a consequence, its transmission
spectrum exhibit a hole around λB. The value of λB is given
by the condition of resonance:
λB = 2ncore

the effective
index of the mode that propagates inside the core. It is given
by the dispersion equation [9]:
Fc (a1, n1, n2, ncore

The second grating is a long period grating which couples
the mode inside the core to resonnant inner cladding modes.
The wavelengths of resonant cladding modes are given by:

the grating. It can be choosen arbitrarily in the range [1.; n2[.
We use the value n3 = 0.95n2 compatible with silica. The
period of the Bragg grating is ﬁxed to 501 nm in order to
obtain a Bragg wavelength of 1.45 µm. Finally, the only free
parameters are a2 and ΛLP G.
In order to determine the best couples of parameters
{a2, ΛLP G}, we proceeded to a systematic exploration of the
parameters space, with ΛLP G varying from 100 µm to 500 µm
by steps of 5 µm and a2 varying from 15 µm to 70 µm by
steps of 0.5 µm. Values of a2 smaller than 15 µm were not
considered because in this case the inner cladding is not large
enough to isolate the core mode from the outer cladding.
For each couple {a2, ΛLP G}, we ﬁrst determined the
wavelength of the resonant cladding modes of the unstrained
sensor using (5) and (6). We only kept the couples for
which only one mode was present in the range [1400 nm,
1600 nm]. Then we applied a radial strain comprised in the
range [−5000 µϵ; +5000 µϵ], the axial strain remaining null.
For each strain, the new radii and indices were calculated with
the help of (9), (10), (4) and (6). This led to the new λB and
λLP G from which were deduced the shifts ∆λB and ∆λLP G.
Then a linear regression gave the sensitivity α1r of the Bragg
wavelength and α2r of the long period grating to the radial
strain. The same procedure was used to calculate the sensitivity
of the FBG and the LPG to the axial strain.

RESULTS
Figure 2 shows a cartography of the coupling coefﬁcient
κ and the parameter D for the ﬁrst ﬁve odd cladding modes,
as a function of a2 and ΛLPG. Even modes are not considered
since their coupling coefﬁcient is almost zero.
The white areas in each graph correspond to conﬁgurations
where λLP G is outside the range [1400 nm; 1600 nm]. For
each mode and for both D and κ, the shape of the coloured
area looks like a comma, which tip is close to the lowest ΛLPG
and the lowest a2. Above mode 5, the tip is splitted into two
parts, with a dead zone where no mode falls in the desired
range. The sign of D changes throught the critical zone and
the coupling coefﬁcient abruptly falls to zero. This corresponds
to a change of modal properties of the cladding.
As stated by (13), the highest sensitivity is obtained with
the largest values of D. For each mode, the largest values of
D are located in the tip of the comma, i.e., for the smallest
values of ΛLPG and the smallest values of a2. What is very
interesting is that the highest coupling coefﬁcients are also
localised in the tip of the comma. This means that a couple
{a2, ΛLP G} can provide at the same time a good resolution
and a good coupling.

However, it is not possible to choose the conﬁguration with
the highest D since others speciﬁcations have to be fullﬁlled.
In particular, the shifts of wavelength must evolve linearly
with the strain in the range [−5000µϵ; +5000µϵ]. In order to
quantify the linearity of the behavior of the long period grating,
we use the estimate Cmoy = (|Cϵr| + |Cϵz|)/2 where Cϵr and

ﬁrst modes. All these gratings present very similar sensitivities
α2r and α2z and close periods ΛLPG. In contrast, they exhibit
quite different coupling coefﬁcients. The coupling coefﬁcients
of mode 1 is almost twice the coupling coefﬁcient of mode
9. Moreover, the radius of the inner cladding for mode 1 is
smaller than that of other modes which makes it less sensitive
to bending. And that is an other interesting feature.

The ﬁgures 5 and 6 show the transmission spectrum of

wavelength as a function of the period of the grating: the
straight line correspond to variation when the grating is at
rest and the dashed lines to the maximum red-shift and the
maximum blue-shift. The lengths of the gratings have been
choosen to maximize the depth of the hole in the transmission
spectrum. For LPG1, the mode 1 is the only one resonant in the
desired wavelentgh range. In fact, no other mode is resonant
in the [1300 nm, 1700 nm] for the considered range of strain.

We ﬁnally present on Figure 7 the whole spectrum of the
sensor with LPG1. The red line correspond to the sensor at rest,
the blue line to the strain that gives a maximal blue-shift and
the red line to the strain that gives a maximal red-shift. We can
notice a slight shift of λLP G in the absence of strain. This shift
is due to the juxtaposition of the FBG. We can also notice the
apparition of several narrow holes for wavelength smaller than
λB. These holes correspond to the coupling between cladding
modes and the core mode induced by the FBG. However
these complementary holes do not induce confusion since their
wavelengths are always smaller than λB.

the FBG and the LPG as a fuction of εz and εz. As expected,
the response of the sensor is quite linear. The deviation from

strain of 5000 µϵ, i.e., 1%. The sensitivity of the FBG to the
the axial strain is α1z = 1, 068 pm/µϵ, and that of the LPG

radial strain is α1r = −0, 555 pm/µϵ and that of the LPG is
α2r = −1, 895pm/µϵ. From this values, and assuming that the
smallest measurable wavelength shift is 1 pm, we deduce from
(13) that the smallest measurable radial strain is ∆ϵr = 1, 4µϵ
and the smallest measurable axial strain is ∆ϵz = 0, 85 µϵ.

CONCLUSION
In this article, we studied an optical ﬁber sensor designed
to discriminate axial and radial strains when embedded in
a material host. The sensor is made of the juxtaposition of
a ﬁber Bragg grating and a long period grating inside the
core of a three layer optical ﬁber. The speciﬁcations were to
obtain a linear response of the sensor and a resolution similar
to classical strain Gauge for the axial strain resolution, i.e.,
1 micro-strain. Among all the parameters we identiﬁed two
relevant parameters : the radius of the inner cladding and the
period of the long period grating. We then searched optimal
values of these parameters and found several conﬁgurations.
The most promising are associated to cladding mode orders
1 and 3. These conﬁgurations present smaller radii of inner
cladding which makes the sensor less sensitive to bending,
and higher coupling coefﬁcients which allows smaller lengths
for the gratings. They allow to measure the axial strain with a
resolution of 0, 85 µϵ and the radial strain with a resolution of
1, 4µϵ. This result is a real advance in strain measurement since
a classical embedded strain ﬁber sensor can not discriminate
axial and radial strain. Moreover, the resolution on axial strain
of a FBG mounted on surface is of the order of 1µϵ. The range
of measurable strain with a linear response is [-5000 µϵ;+5000
µϵ]. In this range, the deviation from linearity is less than 1%.
All these properties can make this sensor a very usefull tool
for the measurement of strain inside structures. The next step
is to investigate its sensitivity to bending.
