Abstract—This paper discusses the relation between two emergent
features of most complex networks: community structure and
high sensitivity to attacks. More speciﬁcally, we consider how
the former can support mechanisms to mitigate the latter. The
main point stressed here is that information about the community
structure can be useful to detect and mitigate vulnerable topo-
logical conﬁgurations w.r.t network connectivity. We demonstrate
this through an attack and failure protocol that considers the
importance of central nodes regarding their roles connecting
nodes, either inside or outside communities. We also propose local
mechanisms for evaluating topological conﬁgurations based on
community information. The strategy for minimizing the impact
of central node failures to network connectivity relies on the
creation of redundant paths between communities. The networks
evaluated exhibited a signiﬁcant improvement in their robustness
regarding connectivity maintenance, being almost unaffected
by failures of central nodes. The experimental benchmark en-
compasses both real complex network datasets and networks
generated by well-established construction methods.

I.
INTRODUCTION
Complex networks exhibit unique characteristics that are
often discussed in the literature, as the small-world effect,
the clustering coefﬁcient and the degree distribution [1]–[4].
Beside them, community structure is one of the main properties
of real complex networks undergoing studies. Its features
can support the understanding of the network formation and
evolution processes, the collective and individual behavior, the
information dissemination, among others, thus, being useful
for a broad range of applications, from disease spreading to
marketing.
Despite some nuances deriving from topological charac-
teristics of each network, it is known that some property
values combinations, which occur in several real networks,
can produce robust networks regarding failures. On the other
hand, when the most central nodes fail, the topology of
complex networks is fairly affected, compromising the network
operation [5]–[11]. Despite this eminent feature being well
stated, mechanisms to evaluate and mitigate such states are
mostly neglected. Analytical approaches for global robustness
estimation are presented in [12][13]. Wang et al. [14] propose a
global approach for supporting the design of networks through
mechanism for detecting and protecting those links which are
crucial for the network robustness.
Based on this, our approach explores community structure
information for detection and mitigation of vulnerable topolog-
ical conﬁgurations. For that, we evaluate the impact that links
connecting elements in the same community (inside links),
different communities (outside links) or both, have on the
network topology when they fail. The results demonstrate that
nodes connecting different communities indeed play a central
role regarding the communication among network elements.
Taking advantage of this information, mechanisms to identify
possible harmful topological conﬁguration and to promote
adjustments on the network are proposed. Such mechanisms
are based on previous work presented in [15], which considers
a node as the main agent for detecting vulnerability and
local efﬁciency as the measure for representing the state of
vulnerability. Here, we propose using the community local
efﬁciency for both goals. Differently, Yang et al., in a very
recent paper [16], use community information for supporting
a global link rearrangement procedure, as a possible way to
improve the network robustness, without taking into account
the detection of harmful conﬁgurations or methods to precisely
revert them.
For benchmarking the experiments, we rely on real network
datasets and networks generated by two constructive models:
Barabasi and Albert’s [2] and Klemm-Euguluz [17] models,
plus a protocol to promote perturbations on the network and
classical topological measures, such as the global and local
efﬁciencies, and the size of the giant component. The ﬁndings
are that concepts related to community structure can be used
to improve the surveillance of communication and service net-
works in case of failures and attacks. In addition, they can be
applied for maintaining/reinforcing the channels of interaction
among agents on business, social and professional networks, or
for supporting decision making in topology control protocol,
w.r.t which connections should be preserved.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section II
presents the benchmark and the experiment protocol adopted
to evaluate the network sensitivity to attacks and failures.
Section III discusses the results of the new protocol to evaluate
the role of community links in the network communication.
Section IV presents the adaptive mechanisms proposed and
their evaluated performances. Finally, Section V summarizes
the conclusions and contributions, and point out some issues
for future research.

BENCHMARK AND PROTOCOL FOR NETWORK
ASSESSMENT
A combination of models and metrics provides the bench-
mark for assessing the exposure of complex networks to
failures and attacks, and for supporting a targeted analysis.
This section outlines the framework applied for carrying this
analysis. The main components are the network models, the
centrality measures, and the simulation protocol.

A. Complex Network Models
The interaction among agents in a complex system tends
to create efﬁcient networks at global and local levels, often
under a scale-free degree distribution. Based on this, many
researchers have proposed different models to create networks
with particular topological properties as convenient simulations
of real networks. For our study we consider two of the most
widely used models: the Barabasi and Albert’s (BA) model
[2] and the Klemm-Euguluz (KE) model [17], referred from
this point on as BA networks and KE networks, respectively.
Table I presents the models main topological properties
values: the number of network nodes (n) and edges (|E|), the
average degree (⟨k⟩), and the global (Eglob) and local (Eloc)
efﬁciencies - see Section II-D for technical details on how the
efﬁciencies are computed.

C. Failures and Attacks Protocols
This work is based on the assumption that community
structure can be worthwhile to support the evaluation and
mitigation of vulnerable topological states. Thus, the network
target of analysis has its nodes classiﬁed according to the
community they belong. The approach to ﬁnd and update
communities is presented in [19].
For simulating failures, nodes are considered autonomous
agents that can leave the network at random with a uniform
probability distribution. On the other hand, to reproduce a pos-
sible scenario of attacks, central nodes must be removed from
the network. There are several criteria to rank nodes according
to their positions in the network, in general, the Betweenness
Centrality (BC) has been considered as a convenient mea-
sure of centrality w.r.t. communication. BC establishes higher
scores for nodes that are contained in most of the shortest paths
between every pair of nodes in the network. In fact, considering
communication networks, nodes with this feature are likely to
be crucial to maintaining the network functionality.
For a given node i and a pair of nodes j, l, the importance
of i as a mediator of the communication between g and l
can be established as the ratio between the number of shortest
paths linking nodes j, l which passes through node i (gjl(i)),
and the total number of shortest paths connecting nodes j and
l (gjl). Then, the BC of a node i is simply the sum of this
value over all pairs of nodes, not including i [20]:
BC(i) =
∑
j<l
(gjl(i)/gjl).
(1)
For assessing the relevance of community structure infor-
mation to detect and mitigate vulnerable topological network
conﬁgurations, a protocol for attacks and failures concerning
the role of central nodes in the community structures were
applied. It encompasses: 1) ranking nodes according to BC or
random criteria; 2) removing links of the most central node
from the network considering its role in the node community:
inside, outside or both; and 3) computing the target properties
values. At each iteration, the node ranking is updated until a
previously deﬁned fraction (f) of nodes become disconnected
from the network.
The adaptive mechanism must compensate the central node
failures with addition of new links. Thus, for its performance
evaluation the most central nodes are completely removed
from the network. For validation purposes, three heuristics
were deﬁned considering the constraints of creating new links
according to their roles: inside or outside the community, or
both. For model-based networks, the results were averaged
over ﬁve realizations.
D. Evaluation Mechanisms
A network is modeled as a graph G = (N, E) deﬁned by
a set of nodes (or vertices) N = 1, 2, ..., n and a set of links
(or edges) E ⊆ NXN. A connection between vertices may be
absent when there is no direct relationship or communication
between them, or it may assume a value in [0, 1] representing
the strength (weight) of the connection. Only undirected and
unweighed networks are considered here.
The impact assessment is supported by classical topological
metrics related to the most important topological features
found in real networks, as follows.
1) Global Efﬁciency: Latora et al. [21][22] introduced a
measure of efﬁciency which computes how efﬁciently nodes
exchange information either in a local or global scope, inde-
pendently of whether the network is weighted or unweighted,
connected or disconnected. For a given pair of nodes (i, j), its
contribution to the global efﬁciency is inversely proportional to
the shortest distance between them (dij), therefore eij =
1
dij .
The global efﬁciency Eglob(G) of a graph G can then be
deﬁned as:
∑
i̸=j∈G
eij
n(n − 1) =
1
n(n − 1)
∑
i̸=j∈G
1
dij
,
(2)
and therefore, Eglob(G) ≥ 0. From this point on, we
normalize this measure, considering the ideal situation Gideal
where all the possible n(n − 1)/2 edges are in the graph, this
9

PESARO 2015 : The Fifth International Conference on Performance, Safety and Robustness in Complex Systems and Applications

is the case when Eglob assumes its maximum value. Thus, the
normalized efﬁciency is:
Eglob(G) =
Eglob(G)
Eglob(Gideal).
(3)
2) Local Efﬁciency: The local efﬁciency is deﬁned as the
ratio between the number of edges that actually exist among
i’s neighborhood (not including i itself) and the total number
of possible links. If the nearest neighborhood of i is part of a
clique, there are ki(ki − 1)/2 edges among the corresponding
nodes, where ki is the degree (number of links) of node i.
Formally,
Eloc(G) = 1
n
∑
i∈G
Eloc(Gi),
(4)
where
Eloc(Gi) =
1
ki(ki − 1)
∑
l̸=m∈Gi
1
dlm
.
(5)
and Gi is the subgraph induced by the nodes directly connected
to i.
3) Giant Component: In most real-world complex net-
works, it has been observed that there is a large connected com-
ponent, often called giant component, together with a number
of small components containing no more than a few percent of
the nodes [23]. A connected component of a graph is a set of
nodes such that a path exists between any pair of nodes in this
set. Its analysis may provide valuable insights for quantitative
analysis, for instance, on how information dissemination and
percolation in Epidemiology-related systems are affected by
the disconnection or loss of nodes [23]–[29].
Notice that the size of the largest connected component is
often equated with the graph-theoretical concept of the “giant
component”, although technically the two are the same only in
the limit of large graph sizes [4]. For the sake of simplicity, we
adopt herein the denomination “giant component” whenever
we refer to the largest component. As a matter of fact, the
connectivity of a network G can be estimated by the relative
size S(G) of the giant component, given by the fraction of
nodes in the network taking part in the largest connected
component:
S(G) = nGiant
n
,
(6)
where nGiant is the number of nodes in the giant component
and n is the number of nodes in the network.
III.
COMMUNITY-BASED NETWORK ROBUSTNESS
For assessing the role that central elements play in the
community structure concerning robustness to failures and
attacks, the protocol for link removals (see Subsection II-C)
was applied. The results are depicted using blue, red, and green
lines representing the removal of node’s link(s) according to
inside, outside and both (inside and outside) criteria, respec-
tively.
Figures 1 to 4 show the evolution of global efﬁciency and
the giant component (y-axis) during the process of attacks,
represented by the fraction of nodes removed from the network
(x-axis). The results stress the importance of links between
communities, emphasizing that losing channels of communi-
cation between communities may be potentially harmful to the
network connectivity. It means that those nodes responsible for
linking communities may be the key elements for evaluating
and mitigating topological states of vulnerability.

In turn, the intra-community bars represent those links that
are connecting nodes belonging to the same community. They
are computed taking into account the entire network (on the

despite the fraction of intra-communities links considering
the entire network is around 0.3, they were the majority of
links lost. Furthermore, they were those which more severely
affect the network connectivity (see Figure 1), highlighting the
importance of these links to the network connectivity.

The property values of BA networks (dashed lines) showed
the same pattern that real network topologies. On the other
hand, for the KE networks the removal of both types of links
were necessary to actually impact the network connectivity,
thus deviating from most of the results achieved for inside
and outside strategies, even for some other real networks not
presented in this paper.
IV.
ADAPTIVE MECHANISM
The approach proposed here is based on the previous work
presented in [15]. It considers nodes as the main agents for
controlling the necessary information and procedures respon-
sible for evaluating and promoting changes in the network
topology. For that, some nodes are assumed to be more likely
to affect the network connectivity according to some likelihood
status, and thereby, nodes in their neighborhood can be deﬁned
as in a vulnerable state. Here, the unit of analysis changes from
nodes to a higher hierarchic structure according to the graph
partition generated by the community detection technique [19].
A partition P is a division of a graph into clusters, such that
each vertex is assigned to one and only one cluster. Even
though some approaches consider vertices belonging to two
or more clusters simultaneously [30], here each node takes
part of a single community/cluster.
A community C is classiﬁed as in a vulnerable state if
some speciﬁc property value is lower than expected. Two states
are thus deﬁned: vulnerable (VC,t = 1) and not vulnerable
(VC,t = 0), according to:
VC,t =
{
1
if δC,t >= γ
0
if δC,t < γ
where δC,t represents the target property value for community
C at a speciﬁc time t. The threshold to set a community as
vulnerable is given by the parameter γ. Both the target property
and the vulnerability threshold can be set out as convenient for
the vulnerability problem being handled.
The adaptation process is straightforward. It encompasses
two main functionalities: the vulnerability assessment and the
creation of new links. In compliance with the attacks and
failures protocol, after each node removal, every community
C assesses its vulnerability state. If applicable (i.e, when
δC,t < γ) new links are added in the network to try to reverse
or minimize the adverse effects of the resulting topological
conﬁgurations. For validation purposes three strategies were
implemented:
•
inside: adding connections between nodes belonging
to the same community,
•
outside: creating link(s) between node(s) from the
vulnerable community to other(s) neighboring com-
munity(ies),
•
both: the combination of inside and outside strategies.
The criteria for the deﬁnition of new connections are tied to
the vulnerability property. According to the results discussed
in [15], the local efﬁciency is a potentially good estimator for
detecting and mitigating vulnerable states. Consider then the
concept of local efﬁciency (5) at the community level:
Eloc(Ci) =
1
kin(Ci)(kin(Ci) − 1)
∑
l̸=m∈Ci
1
dlm
.
(7)
where kin(Ci) is the number of nodes belonging to community
Ci.
For new inside links, the non-connected nodes exhibiting
the lowest and the highest local efﬁciency are connected. As
the probability of sharing common neighbors is higher inside
the community, this new connection tends to enhance the local
community robustness.
The outside strategy considers that each vulnerable com-
munity (source community) should reinforce its connection
with the neighboring communities with which it is weakly
connected. Considering C as the set of communities in G and
Ci the set of nodes belonging to community i, the neighboring
of community Ci is N(Ci) = {(Cj ∈ C|ev,u ∈ E ∧ v ∈
Ci∧u ∈ Cj} and kout(Ci,j) the number of times a community
Cj appears in N(Ci). For a vulnerable community Ci, the
lowest community degree value min(kout(Ci,j)|Cj ∈ N(Ci))
is the threshold to deﬁne the neighbor community(ies) to create
a connection. It means that those neighboring communities
11

with fewer connections are the targets for new connections,
thus creating an alternative path between them.
The strategy to identify which nodes will receive new
connections in both source and target communities is the
same: the priority is for choosing nodes without any link with
other communities. In the case of absence of nodes showing
this feature, those nodes without connections with the target
community are selected.
The both strategy combine the inside and outside proce-
dures.
A. Results
For performance evaluation, the vulnerability threshold
was set to γ = Eloc(G) ∗ 0.5. This deﬁnition relies on
the assumption that communities with local efﬁciency below
the network local efﬁciency (see (4)) are more likely to be
vulnerable.
Figures 7 to 12 present the adaptive mechanisms perfor-
mance. Each line shows the evolution of global efﬁciency (on
the left) and size of the giant component (on the right) during
the process of attacks regarding different adaptation strategies:
H is the original heuristic [15], Eloc(outside), Eloc(inside)
and Eloc(both) are for the outside, inside and both strategies,
respectively. For benchmarking, G depicts networks without
any running adaptive mechanism.
As expected, the improvements accomplished by the
Eloc(inside) strategy were irrelevant. The results for the
original strategy demonstrate that its performance is related
to the network local efﬁciency, mainly because the creation
of links depends on the existence of non-vulnerable nodes.
It means that vulnerable states can be detected, but the re-
quirement to add links is not fulﬁlled. The evolution of both
global efﬁciency and size of the giant component for Football,
UStransportation and KE networks, which exhibit the higher
scores for local efﬁciency (see Tables II and I), demonstrate
that.
On the other hand, Eloc(outside) and Eloc(both) strategies
produced signiﬁcant results for all networks evaluated and
were able to maintain the majority of nodes connected to
the giant component. It is important to notice the inﬂuence
of the initial network conﬁguration regarding its sensitivity
to attacks. For instance, the Football and Dolphins networks
are less affected by attacks, so the adaptive community-based
mechanisms were able to maintain the global efﬁciency and
nodes in the giant component for most iterations, with the
addition of a few links (see Figure 13). In turn, for more
sensitive topologies, such as Protein Interaction and UStrans-
portation networks, a small fraction of nodes was not able to be
maintained in the giant component, despite the number of links
created in the beginning of the adaptation process. Therefore,
considering these networks sensitivity, the community-based
heuristic improved the network robustness.
Figure 13 shows the proportion of new links created at
each iteration. Notice that for the Football network a few
nodes were added to the network considering the community-
based heuristic. Regarding the Protein Interaction network, the
proportion of new links for outside and both strategies at the
beginning of process are around 0.40 of the total number of
links in the network.

Global efﬁciency and giant component — Adaptation - USTrans-
portation network.
As highlighted before, this network topology is quite
sparse, exhibiting low scores for efﬁciencies and average
degree, so it is necessary to create more links to provide a
more robust network. However, after the initial adjustments,
the network was able to accommodate perturbations and to
maintain its global efﬁciency and the size of the giant compo-
nent.
V.
CONCLUSION
The ﬁrst aspect highlighted here is that central nodes
are probably those connecting communities and, therefore,
information about the community structure can be worthwhile
to design networks that are more resilient to failures and
attacks. Taking this premise into account, community-based
mechanisms to evaluate and mitigate vulnerable topological
conﬁgurations were proposed in this paper. The solution
comprises three main components: community identiﬁcation,
vulnerability detection and vulnerability mitigation. For the
ﬁrst component, a well-established method was applied [19].
For the second, a mechanism based on previous results from
[15], but adapted to communities instead of nodes, was pro-
posed. It considers as vulnerable those communities exhibiting
local efﬁciency below the network local efﬁciency. Finally,
the proposed heuristic to mitigate possibly vulnerable states
relies on the creation of additional links between communities.
For reinforcing the importance of the community structure,
three different strategies were evaluated, considering creating
links inside or outside the communities, or both. The outside
and both community-based heuristics outperformed both the
inside community strategy and the original method based on
node information. Furthermore, they showed less sensitivity to
the network topological properties. Thus, the community-based
heuristics showed to be a good prospect towards robust mech-
anisms to deal with the vulnerable topological conﬁgurations
w.r.t. network robustness to attacks. Future works comprise
the evaluation of local mechanisms for communities detection
and parameter estimation, as well as the model validation
considering larger datasets.
