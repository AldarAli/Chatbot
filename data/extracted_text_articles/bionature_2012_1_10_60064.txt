Abstract—Innovation towards a scalable and viable microalgae 
industry for renewable and sustainable bioenergy is greatly 
assisted by the application of life cycle assessment as a 
benchmarking tool to guide the process. This work examines 
existing studies in the field that have attempted to assess either 
the environmental impact and/or commercial viability of the 
microalgae value chain. Existing literature tends to omit 
established conventions of life cycle assessment practice, 
and/or lacks a common approach to boundary definition, 
functional units and impact assessment that would enable 
more effective comparison of options. A move towards a ‘level 
playing 
field’ 
methodology 
would 
enable 
strategic 
prioritization of research efforts to emerge that could lead to 
more rapid development of preferred products, cultivation and 
harvesting technologies, and downstream processing pathways. 
Keywords: microalgae, life cycle assessment, life cycle impact 
assessment, value chain, techno-economic assessment 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool within the broad 
discipline of life cycle management (LCM), “a business 
management approach that can be used by all types of 
businesses (and other organizations) to improve their 
products and thus the sustainability performance of their 
companies and associated value chains” [1]. LCA is 
commonly used as a means to benchmark and compare 
designs, processes and systems, with a view to continuous 
improvement. Based on standardized methods published by 
the International Standards Organization (ISO 14040/14044 
[2006]), it can provide valuable insight into the overall 
efficiency and impact of discrete energy and material flows 
that are relevant to processing and manufacture of a product 
across its various life cycle stages, and for assessing the 
aggregated impact of these as a whole. 
The benefits of conducting LCA include the ability to; 
1. identify and hone in on environmental and economic 
risks or ‘hotspots’ within a products’ life cycle.  
2. gain an understanding of both the upstream and 
downstream implications of various design choices. 
3. inform and guide decision-making as part of an 
innovation program. 
4. communicate 
more 
effectively 
and 
credibly 
regarding environmental claims. 
5. benchmark, report and track on progress over time. 
6. apply a common life cycle impact assessment 
(LCIA) method to effectively compare the overall 
product, system or process ‘footprint’ with its 
relevant alternatives. 
A common criticism of LCA studies based on the last 
point above, including those relating to biofuels, is that they 
often have no collective basis for real comparison of results 
and are not based on a shared set of assumptions or 
assessment methods [2, 3]. As such, LCAs are sometimes 
criticized of being manipulated to justify environmental 
claims, or to retrospectively produce favorable or biased 
results of products. Likewise, many published LCA studies 
often present little more than an energy and greenhouse gas 
(GHG) audit, or life cycle inventory (LCI) only, with no 
impact assessment methodology applied at all. As such, the 
relative impact of various identified or documented flows of 
energy or materials at a macro-scale can be either absent, 
obscured or misrepresented, even where large flows for 
instance may be immaterial to the overall outcome (or vice-
versa). 
While this paper presents a selection of published LCA 
studies relating to microalgae biofuels, it is not the intention 
of this review to query specific numbers or findings, as such, 
or to comment on the veracity of results. However, the 
purpose of reviewing existing studies is to underscore how 
differences in LCA methodology make it difficult to achieve 
collective progress towards commercialization of the 
microalgae biomass value chain in the absence of shared 
methods for framing of studies and presentation of relevant 
data, including assessment of environmental impact.  As 
such, the purpose of this investigation is to highlight the 
many variables inherent across the life cycle, from species 
selection through to processing and delivery of downstream 
products, with a view to recommending a more strategic, 
industry-wide 
collaborative 
approach 
to 
LCA-driven 
innovation, based on agreed standards. 
The structure of this paper is based firstly on presentation 
and discussion of the US DOE’s microalgae biofuels 
industry roadmap, followed by a review of existing LCA 
studies, focus on the various methodological orientations

taken, discussion of co-products and allocation in LCA, and 
finally, conclusions and future work.

METHODOLOGICAL CHALLENGES  IN MICROALGAE 
LCAS 
The following section outlines the industry roadmap and 
describes the many differences that exist between published 
studies, research pathways and areas of commercial 
endeavor that influence LCA modeling and interpretation. 
A. Prospects for a common approach 
The US Department of Energy published a National 
Algal Biofuels Technology Roadmap under the auspices of 
the Biomass Program in May 2010 [4]. This document sets 
out the broad parameters within which techno-economic 
assessment and innovation of the algae biofuel product value 
chain can and should occur, in order to drive towards full 
commercialization. It advocates the integration of recognized 
LCA methods, with a specific focus on leveraging previous 
biofuel feedstock studies.  
Additional aspects considered in the DOE report include 
the opportunity to leverage GIS technology to identify 
specific areas suitable for scalable microalgae cultivation, 
based on availability of non-arable land and proximity to 
necessary process inputs, infrastructure and markets. The 
report also reflects on co-location with synergistic industries, 
such as stationary power generators or wastewater treatment 
plants, as a means to explore innovation in the sector. 
The DOE roadmap provides a conceptual framework that 
highlights the importance of LCA as tool that can contribute 
to commercialization efforts. Notably, the report also 
observes that in addition to measuring net greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions, LCA “can also assess impacts and 
tradeoffs associated with utilization intensity for water, 
energy, nutrients, and other resources.” [4] 
Overall, the roadmap presents a critical challenge for 
LCA, namely that there are multiple cultivation and 
processing choices that can be made, spanning from species 
selection, through to cultivation, intermediate constituents, 
conversion processes and end user products and markets. 
The inference being that without at least some degree of 
harmonization of data collection, boundary definition and/or 
assessment methods, effective comparison, prioritization and 
innovation across multiple pathways will be extremely 
difficult. 
B. Review of existing studies 
The existing published works reviewed here are related 
to microalgae LCA and are divided into three broad 
categories. The first covers the spectrum from energy, 
greenhouse gas and mass balance calculations, to high-level 
‘scoping’ LCA studies [5-7]. These do not report beyond a 
limited set of metrics and/or do not appear to apply or 
present any discrete LCIA method. 
The second category of studies appear to be based on 
more traditional LCA reporting practices that take a more 
comprehensive approach to LCIA [8-11]. Nevertheless, they 
do not generally share a common set of goals, system 
boundaries, assumptions and/or impact assessment methods, 
and only the overall approach and structure each adopts is 
similar, at the very highest level (as proscribed by the ISO 
standard). 
The final category sees LCA results and ‘life cycle 
thinking’ either directly or indirectly implicated through 
techno-economic assessments (TEAs), that seek to primarily 
address the commercial feasibility of the process overall [12, 
13]. These may or may not include an approach designed to 
also measure, assess and report on environmental impacts, 
however their consideration is necessary to appreciate the 
growing body of work in this area. While a TEA is a 
fundamentally different proposition to an LCA, it must be 
based on relevant assumptions of productivity, as well as 
material and energy flows, that enable a fully costed model 
to be assembled. As such they do share common data 
elements with LCA, although the approach to data 
collection, interpretation and validation may well be quite 
different. 
Since microalgae is posited as a sustainable alternative to 
fossil sources of material and energy, those concerned 
primarily with assessing the environmental impact of 
industrial microalgae production seek at a minimum to 
ensure that the overall value chain leads to a net carbon 
reduction [14-16]. Those interested in techno-economic 
studies seek, in the main, to establish the capital and/or 
operating cost profile of an end-to-end process, to ensure 
economic viability of the proposition. Ultimately, integrated 
assessment from both perspectives is necessary in order to 
realize the goal of a scalable, ecologically sound, socially 
responsible and yet commercially viable solution, surely the 
intent of sustainable development [15, 17-20]. 
However, reducing capital and operational costs and 
adequately assessing environmental impact is complex as 
fully scaled commercial operations are essentially non-
existent and lab scale findings must often be relied upon for 
extrapolation [10]. Cultivation and harvesting technologies 
for instance are mostly immature and yet to be realized, 
hence many studies represent, “a prospective LCA of a non 
existing process” [8], and very few published studies have 
even gone on to consider human resource demands of 
operation, such as labor implications [21]. 
One study seeks to overcome the nascent status of a 
scaled microalgae industry by suggesting a bulk growth 
model that will enable more accurate LCA studies to be 
formulated [22]. This uses a series of mathematical models 
relating to light intensity, nutrient uptake and lipid 
accumulation for instance, to predict maximum thresholds of 
productivity, also applying a sensitivity analysis to develop a 
level of confidence in results. The approach put forward also 
makes allowance for differing geographic locations, since 
this impacts directly on growth and is a key aspect often 
overlooked 
in 
existing 
microalgae 
LCA 
studies. 
Comparability of algae LCA studies also depends greatly on 
consideration of a common species, since a biochemical 
profile is fundamental to achieving productivity goals and 
downstream refinement into desired end products [23].

Critical differences between LCA and TEA studies create 
challenges in constructing an integrated picture since they 
each have slightly different conventions and overall 
orientation. In an LCA, it is common to specifically exclude 
the impact of fixed assets and infrastructure, since 
experience has shown that it is the environmental impacts 
related to the operational phase of a product value chain or 
process that dwarf all else. On the other hand, a financial 
assessment seeks to encompass all assets and operational 
costs (including labor), as accurate capital and operating 
projections are fundamental to building a business case, 
raising project finance and to calculating tax benefits such as 
depreciation. In this way, the veracity of LCA data is often 
far less ‘complete’ in terms of the precision of actual 
numbers than the ‘line-by-line’ accounting approach taken 
by a TEA. Nevertheless, sensitivity analysis, coupled with 
LCIA, can reveal credible scientific insights based on LCI 
results, without the need for absolute certainty on the volume 
of individual flows, especially where their variance is found 
to be inconsequential to the final result. 
The existing body of work designed to assess the 
industrial-scale microalgae prospect also seeks to compare 
and contrast findings from a diverse number of analytical 
viewpoints (Table 1). For instance, some reports use the 
intermediary or end products (e.g. FAME, carbon abatement, 
MJ equivalent) as the basis of comparison [5], whereas 
others use the cultivation system [13], or perhaps both [27]. 
There are several trade-offs to be considered in design of the 
entire system, though it can be generalized that the greater 
amount spent on capital equipment and infrastructure (such 
as comparing open pond systems with photobioreactors), the 
higher the biomass productivity per unit area that can be 
expected [14, 15, 17, 28, 29]. Hence, a key position many 
studies attempt to establish is the point at which this trade-off 
is no longer justified. 
A comparison of select studies, further highlighting the 
fundamental differences in approach to system boundary 
definition, is presented in Figure 1. All of these positions are 
equally valid however contribute to general confusion 
regarding system boundaries, goals, functional units, impact 
reporting categories and/or methods that would otherwise 
make fair and transparent, ‘level playing field’ comparison 
of value chain options across the innovation landscape 
possible [5].  
C. Functional units, comparability, inclusions and 
exclusions 
A study comparing the life cycle impact of cultivating 
microalgae in open ponds versus photo bioreactors (PBR) 
proposes a focus on net energy ratio (NER) as a functional 
unit, wherein the construction process and materials used, in 
addition to process energy, are collectively taken into 
account when making inferences about their relative 
suitability and efficiency [28]. However, the environmental 
impact of their respective operational lives, in this case 
mostly related to the energy used in pumping, mixing and 
CO2 delivery, as well as possible impacts associated with 
process nutrients, will far outweigh these calculations 
relating to infrastructure [9], hence this metric appears 
questionable.

Figure 1. Examples of contrasting system boundary definitions in 
microalgae biofuel LCAs and related system studies (ref. Table 1) 
Another illustrative work targets LCA of algae biodiesel, 
suggesting through this analytical approach that for every 
1kg of algal biodiesel produced, approximately 1.4kg of co-
products are generated [26]. This study is notable for several 
reasons. Firstly, it adopts the RMEE method wherein data 
relating to specific unit processes is assembled prior to the 
selection of system boundaries with the intent of avoiding 
arbitrary exclusion of certain items. The functional unit 
chosen relates to 1000 MJ of energy, based on a ‘well-to-
pump’ system boundary. Mass, energy and economic value 
ratios are calculated for each input, with a cut-off ratio of 5% 
chosen as the sole basis to exclude items. This has the effect 
of neglecting the imbalance that often exists in relation to the 
type and volume of certain flows and applying a sensitivity 
filter before any impact characterization is undertaken carries 
this risk. That is, the environmental impact of certain 
industrial chemicals for instance are often disproportionate to 
the volume of their flows, hence this LCA approach could 
overlook such inventory items that would otherwise be 
captured under the terms of a more comprehensive study.   
Another ‘problem oriented’ study coupled wastewater 
treatment and high rate algae ponds together to solve both an 
environmental and commercial problem. This is proposed as 
an example of the means to close the competitive price gap 
between the cost of biofuel production and incumbent fossil 
fuels [30]. In addition to removing nutrient from the water (a 
useful process input for algae growth), the capital and 
operating cost of a conventional wastewater treatment plant 
can be redirected to algae ponds and process water is better 
utilized overall. 
Of 
particular 
relevance 
to 
realizing 
full-scale 
commercialization 
of 
algae 
biomass, 
biofuels 
and 
bioproducts is the establishment of a ‘level playing field’ 
approach to synthesis and interpretation of LCI results, that 
enable them to be interpreted in a meaningful way. This is 
essential in order for such studies to be comparable across 
the industry itself, regardless of the desired output product/s 
[31]. 
A comparative study of microalgae systems modeled 20 
different cultivation scenarios, with a view to evaluation of 3 
key 
parameters, 
namely 
chosen 
material 
for 
PBR 
construction, source of nutrients and source of CO2 [11]. A 
further temporal dimension was added to this analysis to 
view the impacts of various scenarios in terms of length of 
operation of 3 alternate timescales. The LCIA method used 
here was based on the Tool for the Reduction and 
Assessment of Chemical and other Environmental Impacts 
(TRACI), from which 9 impact reporting categories were 
selected and reported against. The functional unit in this case 
benchmarks all LCIA results against the ability of a 
standardized PBR design to deliver a calculated yield of 
algae biomass over time (essentially based on productivity 
potential), with a view to downstream conversion to 
biodiesel. The standardization of reactor design in this work 
provides a useful anchor point, and leads to the observation 
that choice of PBR materials has a significant impact in 
relation to several environmental metrics, where this capital 
infrastructure is included in the model. 
Production of algal biodiesel is assessed in a UK-based 
study, wherein the avoided impacts, or ‘reference systems’ 
are also modeled in order to establish the quantum of benefit 
[32]. LCIA is based here on a recognized, consistent 
reporting method, EDIP 2003, which adds gravitas and a 
degree of comparability to the results. In the case of liquid 
fuel substitutes, extending system boundaries to include 
combustion is necessary given that in this case, algal biofuel 
properties will differ when compared directly with their 
fossil alternatives [10, 29]. 
D. Co-products and the challenge of impact allocation 
Since microalgae systems present an opportunity to 
remediate wastewater streams, address the emissions 
intensity of stationary power generators and heavy industry, 
as well as offset fossil resource consumption, this prospect 
offers potential environmental advantages when considered 
from an attributional LCA perspective, albeit from one that 
addresses multiple problems simultaneously [14]. This has

important and possibly controversial implications for 
allocation of environmental impacts and suggests that more 
of a ‘consequential’ LCA orientation would neatly sidestep 
the inherited burden of the upstream processes (such as coal-
fired power) that feed into it.  
Attributional LCA by definition only really assists with 
answering a question based on the environmental impact of a 
burden at any given moment in time, largely based on 
average production practices. This is useful for simplified 
benchmarking 
and 
certification 
of 
environmental 
performance however fails to recognize the positive flow-on 
effects that a value-adding solution such as microalgae might 
deliver over time.  Consequential LCA takes on a much 
larger scope by effectively trying to model scenarios over 
decades, including coupled flow-on effects and marginal 
changes, however adds significant additional complexity to 
the process. 
Some published algae LCA studies that take an 
attributional approach conclude that algal biofuels are likely 
to perform poorly when compared with terrestrial biofuels 
from an environmental perspective. This is mainly reflected 
in the results for CO2 and nutrients, hence the clear 
preference towards wastewater and emissions intensive-
coupled growth systems as drivers of industrial microalgae 
commercialization [14, 16, 33]. Further, since water is also 
identified as a critical limiting factor for many potential 
algae cultivation sites, exploitation of wastewater for growth 
of freshwater algae species is likely to be essential to achieve 
any significant scale of production [34]. 
A thoughtful discussion of allocation methods in a study 
of algal biodiesel suggests direct substitution (consequential 
allocation) as the preferred approach, before concluding that 
byproducts and their impacts (where they only substitute 
existing waste byproducts of other processes, such as heat) 
should be avoided [32]. The reflection is that economic 
allocation is the simplest and best method to apply, in this 
case an approach to LCA that is in line with the demand 
cycles of the open market, albeit perhaps in conflict with the 
more optimistic, future-oriented view that a consequential 
orientation would deliver, in terms of assessing long terms 
impacts related to sustainable development. 
Of critical interest to allocation in the microalgae context 
is the extent to which the downstream cultivation of 
microalgae (where CO2 from an adjacent power station is 
utilized for growth) is considered an inherited environmental 
burden to the overall process. An undesirable outcome may 
result through application of an attributional LCA method, 
where burden is passed on and distributed proportionately 
down a value chain, whereas a consequential approach may 
lead to a more favourable assessment over time. 
III. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
It is clear that LCA can be a valuable tool for innovating 
across the microalgae value chain with a view to full 
commercialization. However, there needs to be greater 
methodological consistency between LCA studies to guide 
this effort. In the case of algal biomass, allocation is a key 
methodological issue that needs to be strictly consistent in 
relation to assessment of all technologies and pathways, as 
this enables more balanced decision making to be made 
based on both utilization of wastes and generation of co-
products. Future work should address the issue of 
harmonization of agreed system boundaries and LCIA 
methods, collectively benefitting the industry and enabling it 
to benchmark and report on multiple value chain options 
with greater confidence and comparability, based on a ‘level 
playing field’ approach. This effort should draw on the 
experience of other industries in establishing a common 
approach, in particular those that have already developed 
such LCA-driven methods, such as the Building Products 
Innovation Council (Australia) and The Sustainability 
Consortium for benchmarking of consumer products.
