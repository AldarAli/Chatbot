Abstract— This paper proposes a novel estimation scheme of 
the 
timing 
offset 
for 
orthogonal 
frequency 
division 
multiplexing transmission over multipath fading channels. We 
first design an impulse-like correlation function and obtain the 
sample standard deviation of the correlation values, and then, 
develop a decision metric based on the reciprocals of the 
sample standard deviations for the timing offset estimation, 
which has the maximum value when the timing offset is 
estimated correctly. Unlike the conventional schemes, the 
proposed scheme exploits the change in statistics by the first-
arriving path rather than the magnitude itself of the first-
arriving path. Numerical results show that the proposed timing 
offset estimation scheme offers a performance improvement 
over the conventional schemes in various multipath fading 
channels. 
Keywords- OFDM; timing offset estimation; multipath fading 
channels; decision metric; standard deviation

 INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORKS 
Compared with the single carrier communication systems, 
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has 
many advantages such as simple equalization and high 
spectral efficiency [1]. However, the OFDM is very sensitive 
to the timing synchronization error [2]: Specifically, the 
timing offset causes an error in determining the starting point 
of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) window at the receiver, 
eventually resulting in a serious Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) 
degradation [1]. Although several timing offset estimation 
techniques [3]-[7] were proposed, all of them do not perform 
well under the influence of the multipath fading common in 
wireless channels, since they often mistake one of the 
timings of the delayed paths for the (correct) timing of the 
first-arriving path, i.e., they suffer from a problem of 
ambiguity in timing. Thus, the timing offset estimation 
techniques alleviating the influence of the multipath fading 
were developed: [8] takes the earliest among the paths with 
magnitudes exceeding a pre-determined threshold as the 
first-arriving path, and on the other hand, [9] and [10] 
perform a preprocessing based on power normalization to 
increase the relative magnitude of the first-arriving path to 
those of the delayed paths. Although these techniques offer 
an improvement in timing offset estimation to some degree, 
all of them would perform poorly when the first-arriving 
path is attenuated severely or when the first-arriving path is 
not the strongest one. 
In this paper, thus, we propose a novel timing offset 
estimation scheme with a higher degree of robustness to the 
multipath fading, where we exploit the change in statistics by 
the first-arriving path rather than the magnitude itself of the 
first-arriving path, unlike in the conventional schemes. 
Specifically, we estimate the timing offset based on the 
change in the reciprocal of the standard deviation of the 
correlation samples of the OFDM symbol. From numerical 
results, the proposed scheme is confirmed to provide a better 
estimation performance over the conventional schemes in 
multipath fading environments. 
In the following sections, we describe the OFDM system 
model in multipath channel environments (Section II), 
propose a novel timing offset estimation scheme (Section III), 
compare the performance of the proposed and conventional 
schemes (Section IV), and finally, conclude this paper with a 
brief summary (Section V).

 It should be noted that the

compared with the variance, due to it being expressed in the

I d
and thus, the standard deviation 
would offer a better performance in detecting the variation 
over the variance. Since   is the smallest value of

sub-interval III and (

NUMERICAL RESULTS 
In this section, the timing offset estimation performance 
of the proposed scheme is compared with those of the 
conventional schemes in [3]-[10] in terms of the Mean 
Square Error (MSE) and detection probability in multipath 
fading environments. We assume the following real 
transmission parameters: The IFFT size 
N = 128,
the CP 
length 
NP = 8,
the carrier frequency offset 
f = 0.1,
and 8-
path multipath Rayleigh fading channels with exponential 
(E-) and uniform (U-) PDPs having the average power of

 and 1/ 8, respectively. In addition, the 
probability of false alarm and   are set to

respectively.  
From Figure 5 showing the MSE and detection 
performances of the timing offset estimation schemes as a 
function of the SNR defined as

  over the 
multipath fading channels, we can clearly see that the 
proposed scheme provides a better performance in timing 
estimation over the conventional schemes as expected. 
Especially, from the figures, it is observed that the difference 
in performance is more significant with the E-PDP than with 
the U-PDP of the multipaths, which stems from the fact that 
the variation in statistics by the first-arriving path is more 
pronounced compared with those of the delayed paths with 
the E-PDP than with the U-PDP of the multipaths, and thus, 
the advantage of the proposed scheme based on the change 
in statistics by the first-arriving path is more prominent with 
E-PDP over the conventional schemes based on the 
magnitude itself of the first-arriving path. In addition, the

difference in performance increases as the value of SNR 
becomes larger. This is because the influence of the 
multipaths becomes more dominant over the noise in high 
SNR region, and thus, the advantage of the proposed scheme 
(designed to alleviate the influence of the multipaths) 
becomes more obvious than it is in low SNR region. 
In short, we can conclude that the proposed scheme 
overcomes the multipath fading more efficiently than the 
conventional schemes. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have proposed a novel timing offset 
estimation scheme for OFDM transmission in multipath 
fading channels. We have first designed a correlation 
function having an impluse-like form, and then, have 
developed a decision metric based on the standard deviation 
of the correlation values to estimate the timing offset. From 
numerical results, it is confirmed that the proposed scheme 
provides a better MSE and detection performance compared 
with the conventional schemes in various multipath fading 
environments. Our future work is to verify the applicability 
of the proposed scheme to more realistic channel 
environments.
